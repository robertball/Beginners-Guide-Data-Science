Maybe it's because I'm so used to eating vegetables this way that I found this good, but only average. I can tell you, however, that even as an Italian familiar with pancetta, I'll take regular old American bacon over it any day! Unless you're familiar with pancetta and really like it, I think I'm safe to suggest you substitute bacon here and in any other recipe calling for pancetta.  I've even forced myself to try to like it and just can't. I tried again in this dish, tasted it and started over again, the second time with bacon.

I made this low calorie and fat free.  I used olive oil flavored Pam and liquid smoke instead of pancetta.  The flavor was great and it is healthy!

I definitely recommend adding heavy cream toward the end. I also threw in sliced mushrooms and sprinkled with Parmesan. Oh my lord, SO good!!!

This was a great recipe for brussel sprouts. The only change I made was I used bacon instead of pancetta.

I love this recipe, but I added a half a cup of half and half at the end and let it simmer for a bit. It made it even better! So creamy and still had that salty pancetta taste.

Wonderful! Next time I'm adding onions too. DELICIOUS! Oh and I used fresh proscuitto from the deli cut in 1/4 inch slices and diced it myself. Much more flavor and a lot less fat than pancetta. GREAT RECIPE

This was an excellent way to turn boring old brussel sprouts into a restaurant quality side dish. My hubby particularly liked it. A keeper.

I did not have pancetta on hand so I used regular bacon in this dish.  I'm sure the pancetta would have made the taste even better but this recipe for brusell sprouts was the best I have had so far.

This was a big hit!  I used Turkey Bacon instead of pancetta; after the bacon was cooked, I removed it from the pan and added about 2 Tblsps of chopped Shallots  with the garlic and they browned nicely together and gave a little sweeter taste to the Brussel Sprouts.  Will definately use this recipe again!

I was looking for something last minute to use up a package of frozen brussels sprouts I had and stumbled on this.  Considering I had to use frozen ones and bacon as I didn't have pancetta on hand, it was still pretty good.  I can't wait to try it with fresh sprouts and pancetta!

Very tasty, even though I used regular bacon.  I thought they were lacking a little bit of oomph, so I added some fresh lemon juice and zest at the last minute, and thought that was a wonderful fresh addition.

I have never eaten or cooked Brussel Sprouts before this recipe and all I can say is WOW! Cooked this for our family and a friend, everyone loved them, except my daughter, who wouldn't go near it, but I think that's normal for a six year old, lol. 
I followed the advice of fellow reviewers and cooked with half and half and sliced baby portabella mushrooms. Had to substitute the pancetta for bacon as I couldn't find it at my local store. Still turned out wonderful! I doubled the recipe to feed everyone, but I think I'll need to triple it next time! That way everyone can get as much as they want.

This was excellent!  I've never had enjoyable brussel sprouts before, but this is a KEEPER!  After trimming the ends from my brussel sprouts I cut an X in each one.  Then while the sprouts simmered I sauteed the garlic.  I didn't have the bacon so I used the left over Christmas ham, diced.  Also added extra garlic powder.  Followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  Thanks for sharing!

I did not use bacon at all but rather, four tablespoons of saved bacon grease.  These were incredible!  I could make a meal out of just these and an added bonus, my kids LOVED them.  Thank you!!!

So good!  Like other reviewers I used bacon, which worked really well.  I also halved my sprouts before I cooked them to save time.  I will make this again and again!

I personally loathe Brussels Sprouts, but Husband doesn't mind them. He thought this was a great new way to serve them. The only thing I did differently was to use regular center cut bacon (couldn't find pancetta). Thanks!

So good.  I made two pounds of sprouts and subbed bacon as it was what I had on hand-- I used about half a package of low sodium bacon.  I also salted the water and boiled for the full 7 mins and they were perfect for us.  I didn't think my picky 6 year old would even try them, but she ate most of them (with a little encouragement).  I will be making this again for sure!  Thank you!

This is the way I make them except I leave out the boiling step. I cook the panchetta and garlic, cut the sprouts in half and throw them in the pan. Cook till just tender. Soooo good. Only way my family wants them.

made it twice, very good, go easy on the procuitto, you can add ham or a couple pieces of bacon instead. made sure the brussel sprouts are not cooked to much you want them just about to turn soft before frying.

I used bacon instead of pancetta.  I had never tried brussel sprouts before so I thought that a recipe where they are coated in bacon grease would be a good starting point.  Well guess what?  They tasted like bacon!  Delicious bacon.  Maybe the pancetta would have been a little more subtle but overall if you want brussel sprouts but don't actually want to taste them, this is the recipe for you.

Yummy! They were great. Make sure you do not fully cook the sprouts when boiling or they will become mushy in the skillett when sauteing.

I really like this recipe!  Like others I use bacon.  I also steam the sprouts instead of boiling and add some finely diced red onion with the bacon and garlic.

Yay you, Jasmine! Out of 6 kids, I only have 1 that will eat Brussels Sprouts. :( My hubby and I love them, and I was determined to figure out a way to get the little "darlings" to at least try a leaf! Well, this one did it! The one thing I did different was to slice the sprouts into a few pieces instead of just half after only blanching them. For some reason, my kids were less taken aback by them, and cleaned the bowl out! Thanks for sharing, and this will now put those little green fellows into a regular rotation!

We liked this a lot - seemed kind of like a lot of meat for the amount of brussel sprouts, I might do less next time. The texture was just right for me, but apparently my husband likes them better when they are all melty inside. The flavor was really good, and the recipe was easy to make. Overall, I loved it, and the husband liked it a lot, so that's pretty good.

Way too much salt ... I'd eliminate the extra salt altogether and just let the pancetta flavor come through. I also added an extra garlic clove. Finally, I steamed the sprouts instead of boiling out all the flavor and nutrients. (Side note: I never boil any vegetables unless absolutely necessary.)

This is definitely the best brussel sprout recipe that I have fixed. My only alteration to the dish was substituting baccon for pancetta. I look forward to making it again soon!

I made this recipe using pancetta and it was absolutely delicious.  In fact, it was the only dish that completely disappeared at the dinner table on Thanksgiving.  I did add one small onion, sliced thinly, which I sauteed with the pancetta.  I also recommend using freshly cracked black pepper.  I made the dish a couple of hours ahead of time and then put them in a warm oven for about 20 minutes before we sat down to eat.

I didn't use the extreme amount of salt that this recipe called for and subbed with bacon as I didn't have any pancetta in the house. All in all a delicious way to cook my favorite vegie. Thank you!

I'm giving these five stars because I think if you prepare them in the manner that's stated they will be awesome. I used regular bacon and they were just so-so.  Don't use regular bacon... Pancetta probably makes the dish.

I make Brussel sprouts quite often and this is a great combo! I did not boil the sprouts first though. I cut them in half, sautéed them in olive oil with mushrooms and garlic. After about 7 minutes, I added the Pancetta. Cooked for another 5 minutes or so. Then added some beef broth, covered and simmered until everything was cooked together. Definitely recommend. Bacon would be a nice substitution for the Panetta as well!

I made some changesm I use regular bacon, alot of people didn't like tha pancetta, I did but some people are picky, I also added some chopped ham about a 1/4 cup and don't add the garlic until the end it only takes a few seconds to cook the Garlic or it will burn and give you a sour biter garlic taste. I also used a 1/4  teaspoon of garlic salt and onion salt. It makes it much more flavorful. Slced mushroom work well too. you can make asparagas the same way.

Made for Thanksgiving (and other times) and there were none left! Great flavors and so simple! You can easily substitute bacon for the Pancetta but Pancetta can be cut into chunks and IMPP much more tastier than fried bacon.

This was my first time ever having brussels sprouts and off this recipe I loved them! I added some chopped onion with the pancetta and garlic (because I love onion) and I cannot wait to get more brussels sprouts and make it again.

this is a pretty good recipe, but, I make a variation of this for Thanksgiving every year and the two things I do a bit differently are...I add some finely chopped shallot along with the panchetta and I also add about a tsp of butter to the panchetta/shallot mixture while I am sauteeing it.

This has become a staple in my house. Since we eat it so often I have started making it w/o pancetta or bacon and added a bit more garlic - still wonderful. The only thing I have found is that not steaming the sprouts first gives them a nice crunch and they brown a bit on the outsides, which I love!

I didn't see that the water was supposed to boil and then add the sprouts.  So my boil time was off.  They definitely needed to cook the whole ten minutes.  The flavors were good.  I will definitely use this recipe again ( and cook the whole time ;) ).

This recipe reminded me of amazing brussel sprouts we had in Spain.  Used chopped uncured bacon and a healthy shake of garlic powder. Served with fusilli and meatballs and was a delicious, satisfying meal! A repeat for sure!

Best brussel sprouts I have ever made!  I did do as suggested to make it lower fat and used 98% fat free ham and alittle liquid smoke and some olive oil along with the garlic.  I browned the sprouts just a bit.. was yummmm!

Yum. I'm not a big fan of bacon in a recipe (I prefer my bacon unadulterated), but it was good.

Absolutely delicious as is.  I am sure bacon would bring another flavor, but the pancetta hit the spot.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Great recipe and very forgiving...Adjustments I made... 1. Let the cook (boil) a little longer for tenderness...(I added 1/2 and 1/2 water and chicken broth) 2. I also added sliced roasted chicken sausage. 3. Didn't have bacon or panchetta so I rinsed of 2 slices of salt pork and cut it up. 4. Cooked it a bit longer because I like a tender sprout full of flavor and cooked well.  It turned out AWESOME!

These had great flavor and were pretty easy to make.  I didn't use the bacon and I covered the brussel sprouts after sauteeing for about 10 mins to get them to my taste of doneness.

This was absolutely delicious!  I used bacon, as suggested by other reviewers.  When I make this again, though, I will boil the sprouts twice as long, as I like my veggies very soft and well done.  If I were a crispy vegetable kind of person, I'd give this 5 stars.  Everyone else at the table loved it, and there were no leftovers.

I made these as a side dish for our Prime Rib Christmas dinner and they were a total hit!!  I haven't been successful with Brussel Sprouts in the past, but this recipe is a total keeper!!  I will use this recipe over and over again.

I really liked this recipe.  I modified it slightly by mixing chardonnay in with the water used to cook the brussel sprouts.  Then, using bacon (only because I didn't have the pancetta), I deglazed the garlic and some green onion whites with a little of the same chardonnay and thickened the "sauce" with a little bit of corn starch.  It coated the brussel sprouts and was perfect.

The variation using half-and-half sounded really good too.  I'll have to try it next time.

This was very, very good BUT I doubled the brussel sprouts and still used 8 oz of pancetta and it was fine!  I also drained about 1/2 of the drippings before adding sprouts and additional olive oil.  Was fabulous with crockpot sauerbraten and sauteed red cabbage!

I had never had brussels sprouts before this. Good first experience. The bacon seemed to take away from the earthy taste that I've heard about. Will make again.

Excellent! Gives the brussels sprouts and extra little bite in flavor with the pancetta. Only change was that we didn't feel the need to add the remaining oil called for in the recipe. Loved the flavor combo in this recipe and a nice change from simple roasted or boiled/steamed brussels sprouts. Will make again! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I've done this before, but without boiling the brussels sprouts in the water.  I've also used regular old bacon.  I used to think I would serve this as a side dish, but have found it's almost too good for that, so now I eat it as the main course with a nice piece of crusty french bread (buttered, of course) on the side.  Yummy!  I will have to try adding the cream at the end, as one reader suggested.  (How could that be wrong?)

Very delicious (and I'm not ordinarily fond of brussel sprouts)!  I compiled all the reviewers suggestions and made it my own.  4 oz. bacon instead of 8, cooked sprouts in a combo broth/water mixture, added about 1 T. cream at the end and sprinkled with parmesan, cut back about half on  the salt and pepper.  Yumm-o.

I admit to using frozen sprouts as that is all I had on hand.  Also used regular American bacon.  Turned out pretty tasty, and am sure it will be even better with the fresh sprouts.  Will definitely be making again.

I did use reg bacon and wonder if the flavor would have been better with the pancetta bacon. this recipe was good. probably great for the sprout lovers. My boyfriends father is a fan so i made this recipe to impress. The night befor i made brussels roasted in the oven with aged balsamic, topped with toasted pine nuts and goats cheese. I perfered these flavours together. stay tunned, will perfect and submit recipe.

This was ok. I had frozen brussel sprouts and bacon on hand, so i used instead. Maybe it will be better with fresh sprouts, I'll probably give it another try

This was a very tasty recipe! I added a little heavy cream toward the end and let it simmer for a few minutes to make it a creamier dish. It was wonderful. My husband and even 2 of my boys liked it!

Simple.  Quick.  Delicious.  This is very similar to the brussel sprout recipe I already use.  I also use bacon since that what we like.

Oh WOW.. this was great !  I didnt want to make the same old brussel sprouts, and looked here to find something new to try.  Luckily I came accross the recipe and had the ingredients, so gave it a try.  I followed the recipie, except for subsituting capocolla ham for the panchetta.  I added a dash of half-n-half at the end, just to make a creamy sauce, but I think it would have been great without it.  I have a new favorite veggie dish !  Thanks so much !

Made this adding shallots to the garlic, bacon instead of pancetta, and parmesan when served. My husband and I both thought it was delicious, but found it to be a little bland, so we also added a little garlic salt.

Fabulous!  I used 2 slices of bacon and a drop or two of liquid smoke and then added about 1/4 c. of cream at the end.  Sinfully good.

Great recipe.  I also substituted bacon since I had no pancetta on hand and added a few shaved almonds as I am a nut freak, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I don't eat bacon so I substituted kosher hot dogs, sliced diagonally. I cut back on the salt and pepper unintentionally, but it came out delicious.  It was a hit!
