Very very good! Fast and easy too! First off, I NEVER use chicken breasts because I feel they are too dry, and lack flavor.  I ALWAYS substitute boneless skinless chicken thighs in all recipes that call for chicken. I trim off most excess fat from the thighs. I used fat free half and half for the heavy cream and then just thickened the sauce with a LITTLE cornstarch.  Also, I prepared extra sauce to pour over the pasta when served. I think the sauce is best made THE NIGHT BEFORE so the flavors can blend through(it's also easier that way if you're potlucking at work as we often do). Keep the sauce and pasta separate until serving or the pasta soaks up too much of the sauce. I agree with many about bumping up the Pesto.  I make my own Pesto so it packs plenty of flavor punch. Fast, easy and not fussy to make.  A hit with the crowd.

The best pasta dish I have ever had! I love pesto so I added a couple extra tablespoons of that and I used 1 cup of half and half and 1/4 cup chicken stock to cut some calories.

Since I served this as a side dish with stuffed chicken, I omitted the chicken in this recipe. Wowie--I was blown away by this!  I always make my own pesto, as  I did this time, but this was the first time I've ever mixed it with cream and I was SO impressed that I probably will always make my pasta with pesto like this from now on. I also liked the fact that the recipe calls for a subtle amount of pesto and it was just right.  Too often I've experienced such a ton of pesto in dishes (restaurants, actually) that it is literally sickening. Not this time--and I think after this dish my husband has actually made friends with pesto!

Soooo good and easy!  I didn't use the butter and used less olive oil than called for.  Pesto has enough oil in it!  I also used skim milk with a tsp of cornstarch wisked in instead of the heavy cream. It still came out GREAT!  I added artichoke hearts just because I love them and they went so well with this dish. YUMM!

Very quick and easy to make but just an okay recipe for us.  There are way too much noodles for the amount of sauce.  Recommend doubling the sauce or cut down on the pasta.  Thanks

This is pretty good.  I didn't have heavy cream or penne pasta so I used half & half and rotini pasta instead.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp of chicken bullion granules when added the pesto.  Next time I make this, I will try adding some fresh, sliced mushrooms and possibly some chopped red/green bell peppers for color.  Thanks Mary.

Very good and super easy to make! I used Knorr Pesto Mix and made a pesto sauce before boiling the pasta and it came out just fine. The sauce is rich and tasty and this was so easy to make! I think next time I may marinate the chicken in garlic powder for a few hours before cooking. Thanks Mary for posting this!

Made as stated with the exception of using Low Fat Evaporated Milk in place of the cream and adding a tablespoon of chicken base.  Good flavor and a nice change from the typical.  Used the "Pesto Sauce" recipe from this site.  Thanks for a yummy use of all that basil growing like weeds in my garden!

This was very yummy!  I didn't have some key ingredients and took a risk and tried to make it a little different.  It was excellent and my husband absolutely loved it!  I didn't have heavy cream, butter or milk. I used just olive oil for cooking the chicken.  For the sauce I used jarred pesto, around 1/2-3/4 cup cream cheese, double amount of parmesan, a little mozzarella, and a 1/2 cup rice milk.  I was lucky and it turned out wonderful!!! I also added some broccoli to get our greens in there as well.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and made a few adjustments. I sub'd boneless skinless chicken thighs for the breasts, I used half and half in place of part of the heavy cream (little less than one cup) and 1/2 cup water with chicken bouillon and cornstarch. I doubled the amount of pesto used and added in a few cups of sliced mushrooms. This was a huge hit in my house, they were quite literally fighting over who got to take leftovers for lunch the next day! I will definitely be making this again.

I left out the chicken, served a garlic breaded chicken on the side instead - this made an AWESOME side for the chicken. It was very rich, and a little went a long way - we'll have lots of leftovers and that's a good thing! I'm stuffed and I can't wait to digest so I can eat more. Maybe I need therapy? Regardless, this is AWESOME.

Wow! Super easy fast and tasty. To reduce calories a smidge I used half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I also added about 3-4 cups of fresh baby spinach which reduced to almost nothing, just a few flecks of green in the sauce but did add nutrition, color and flavor. I also added a few diced sundried tomatoes to the sauce and doubled the pesto. Five stars for a wonderful base recipe which tolerates modifications fabulously.  This one will definitely enter my rotation.

This recipe is really good as is. One tip: Just before serving, break off Feta cheese chunks in the dish.

I made this exactly as the recipe states but I took the complaints of others into account.  Instead of doubling the sauce I made 1/2 more, and cut the penne down by removing one cup from the 16oz box.  I don't feel I had too much of one or the other and had enough sauce to soak up with a nice crusty bread.  The flavor was good, but I wish I would have thickened the sauce with maybe more cheese.  It was a little thin.  Would make again though.  When someone says not enough sauce I believe them.  A big Italian chain restaurant never gives enough sauce so I don't go there.  Who wants dry pasta...

Awesome! Added pine nuts, mushrooms, and spinach. Used half and half and a tad more pesto and cheese.

I always chuckle when folks totally change a recipe and then say they loved it, but I am going to do it now.  I read a review that said to add sun-dried tomatoes, so I did.  Then I saw a pint of cherry tomatoes sitting in the fridge and decided to throw those in.  First, I cooked the cherry tomatoes separately with some oregano.  Once they had popped I mashed them and added them to the chicken.  Finally, I added the cream, actually fat free half-n-half, and the parmesan cheese.  We loved it.  Very tasty.  My husband told me to take the serving dish of pasta off the table before he ate it all!

this is a very easy meal to cook when you are short on time or not in the mood to really cook.  it comes out like you spent allot of time on this meal. I always have it with a salad and french bread. My family loves it.  I have made it so many times that I don't even measure anymore.  I highly recommend this recipe to any working mom!

Yum, I suggest using the recipe entitled "Pesto"  for the sauce.  I just make a bunch and put it in the fridge. Works out nicely.

I used a jar of Classico Alfredo instead of the cream as some of the others have suggested. It turned out to be a beautiful dish. I used multi-coloured bow tie pasta, as well as some mushrooms and brocoli. Next time I will add a little more brocoli since it complements the dish so well. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was pretty good.  I made it with chicken broth to reduce the calories. I think next time I'll put in some mushrooms, but all in all, the recipe is a good one.

This recipe was good when I cooked it the first time meeting the specifications listed. I cook this recipe once a month now and my wife and I love it. But I do add more parmesan cheese, use slightly less chicken, add more garlic, and more pesto sauce to give the recipe a richer taste with better green color. I would easily suggest trying this recipe if you like pesto and/or pasta.

YUM YUM!  I made this tonight with some very garlic-y chicken strips I wanted to use.   I sauted the chicken strips with onions in butter.  I wanted more sauce, so I poured in 2 c cream(from the top of raw milk), and added about 1 c leftover peas and simmered them together.  I added a heaping 1/4 c of home made pesto I had frozen in ice cube trays this past summer and heated the whole thing through.  We mixed the sauce and chicken into 1  pound of penne right as we were ready to serve it.  This was a huge hit, very quick and easy, and I will likely serve it regularly.  Thanks MARYSTEVE!

This is great, been making it for years but use bottled Alfredo sauce which works just as good and less calories than the cream.

Love this recipe! I give it four stars because we LOVE pesto and I double the pesto called for in the recipe. Perfect amount of creamy goodness in the sauce! Yummy!

This was so good! I try to cut calories and add vegetables when I can. So, I cooked reduced the butter and olive oil by half. I also added chopped red pepper and mushrooms when the chicken was almost done. I used 3/4 cup table cream (18%) and 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of 1 1/4 cup  heavy cream. I also added some cooked broccoli toward the end. Since, I added so many vegetables, I also used less pasta. This will definitely be appearing regularly in my dinner rotation. Thanks!

I thought this was unbelievably good!  I used jarred sun dried tomato pesto.  I also doubled the sauce and did half heavy cream and half chicken broth.  I added in some broccoli to round out the meal.  Super delicious!!  My kids want me to make this every night!

Very good, I used half and half and added a little more since I added some chicken for more of a main dish meal.  Very good, thank you for the recipe.

Have you ever seen a 12 year old boy DIVE off his chair to get to a piece of chicken before the dog can? Thanks to this recipe, I have!! This simple recipe lets each ingredient shine and those enjoying the meal say YUMM!! The only change I made was using a 1/2 cup (or so) of white wine to deglaze the pan after frying the chicken, which I then added to the sauce.  This added a very good flavor our family enjoyed.  Don't hesitate to try the recipe--you won't be disappointed!!

So easy and so yummy. I used already baked chicken breasts from the grocery so I just had to heat the chicken in the oil/butter/garlic before adding the sauce. I did add a bit more pesto and a bit more parmesan cheese because we like extra. The whole recipe only took 12 mins from pan to table!!! Great when you work long hours but still want a home cooked meal. This one is a keeper.

This is a very good starter recipe and easily customized. I took advice from other reviews and added more cream and more pesto. I also added a half can of garlic, oregano and basil seasoned diced tomato. 

Next time I'll use a less pasta and more chicken simply for personal preference. I'll also use some of the lower fat & calorie suggestions as well. This was very enjoyable.

Yum!  This recipe was so delicious, I couldn't stop myself from getting more and more!  My kids loved it, which is always a plus.  I used regular milk instead of cream, and added artichoke hearts and mushrooms.  I like spicy, so I added some crushed red peppers to my plate as well.  This was fantastic and I'll make this again and again!

I added sliced onions and asparagus spears, just to sneak in some vegetables and make it a one-pot meal. I added a lot more parmesan, too. What a great recipe!

Yum!  I followed the recipe, mostly.  I used a pint of fat free half and half and a couple generous scoops of pesto.  The sauce was runny so I mixed in some cornstarch dissolved in water.  Then it was too thick so I put in some 2% milk.  Then I needed more pesto and parm.  :-)  What I'm getting at is this is a very forgiving recipe that took no time at all and tasted delicious.  Will keep this in the rotation for sure!

This is so yummy! Did substitute half and half for the cream and made my own pesto but you could easily use the pre-made stuff you buy at the grocery store. I have doubled and tripled the pesto before and its good with a little or a lot. I sauted 3 chicken breasts in the pan before making the sauce then set aside. Then in the same pan made a double batch of sauce, and then sauted for a few minutes while the pasta cooked. Then I mixed together the chicken and pasta into the sauce. Unless your going to decrease the amount of pasta used, then I would recommend doubling the sauce. This is so easy and delicious, I will be making again.       **one side note is that this dish is best finished on the night it is prepared because the leftovers cannot compare. The pasta absorbs all the yummy sauce and leave behind only olive oil.

This was really good! I did make changes however, adding more pesto and lots of parm. My test subjects were pleased, and really enjoyed this dish. I ran out of penne n just added some other pasta that i had.... will def. make again, just not too often, this seems to be a very fattening dish.... but quite yummy:)

This recipe is the best!  The only bad thing is that you can't reheat it or take the leftovers for lunch, due to the oil separating.

...and YES I have used the exact same Classico brand olive oil and from MY experience it does not reheat well.  I've found that twice the flavors were not the same, it became dry and loss flavor.  Kudos to you experts who can reheat this dish.

I've never made a pesto-pasta dish before, since I'm a big fan of tomato, but I was very pleased with the way this turned out.  I used milk instead of heavy cream, and added about 3-4 tbs of corn starch, plus extra parmesan, to thicken the sauce which worked nicely.  I also put a sprinkle of shredded mozarella and fresh romano on top.  I'm excited to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks.

This is an excellent recipe, but I can see why some reviewers thought it to be a little bland. The secret probably lies in the intensity of the pesto. I used a homemade variety which is rather mild and had to use twice the stated amount. Also used a little extra garlic and parmesan.  But after that, even my picky boyfriend had seconds.  Flavor this dish intensely and serve with a garden fresh salad, french bread and a crisp white wine and it will be a winner!

This was my first attempt at cooking something that didn't come from a box or the freezer. It was a little bland (my husband made me follow the recipe to a tee), but we added some green onions, another two tablespoons of the pesto sauce and a few shakes of shaved parmesan. It was delish! Thank you!

Quite good as written, and even better the day after. I choose to eat smaller portions rather than a larger amount of fat-free, so instead I reduced the serving of pasta, and had a large side of steamed broccoli and cauliflower. Good and filling.

This recipe is really delicious! Followed the advice of other reviewers because I like a lot of flavor. I added extra crushed garlic, used fat free half n half to replace half of the heavy cream and 2 tbls of water.  The flavor was outstanding. Even my foodie daughter loved it!

We enjoyed this pesto pasta dish for dinner.  I followed the sprit of the recipe but did make changes to suit my family amd the ingredients I had on hand.  I used 2lbs of bnls/sknl chicken breast, 1/2lb whole wheat penne, 1c heavy cream, 6T basil walnut pesto (homemade-- recipe from AR), two handfuls pecorino Romano, 4c steamed blanched broccoli florettes, 10 Sundried tomatoes reconstituted and cut into thin strips.   My family really enjoyed this meal and the littlest geek said that I could make it again (before he even finished his dinner-- he's planning ahead!)  Thank you MARYSTEVE for the inspiring recipe! :)

Wow! What a quick, easy, and delicious recipe! Followed the directions as written except I substituted half and half for the cream and thickened it with cornstarch. This is definately a keeper! I love how quickly it all comes together

This did not work at all for me. Take note, make sure the skillet is well cooled before adding the dairy. My sauce curdled and was barely edible. I will try again.

This was simple and delicious. I changed things up a little bit. I added some Italian seasonings to the chicken while it cooked. After the chicken was cooked I removed it from the pan and added 1/4 cup white wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth and let it reduce. Then I added 1/2 cup pesto (instead of 1/4 cup the recipe called for) and the other ingredients. I added the chicken back when I put the pasta in. I also added some pasta water to help thicken the sauce. I used bow tie pasta because I didn't have penne. I will be making this again and perhaps trying the low fat substitutions suggested.

Nice flavor, loaded with flavor, is enough.  Whenever recipes call for 2 cloves of garlic, and I don't have huge cloves in the bulb, I double the garlic, which was the case with this.  Also, probably only used 13 or 14 oz. of penne, rather than the full pound, and used just one cup of heavy cream.  Finished it topped with more fresh grated parmesan, and a little extra salt.  Will probably add some blanched broccoli (or asparagus?)at the finish if I do make it again...

I made this for my family and my brother loved it! I also thought it was really tasty. We usually buy this dish frozen at the store and microwave it, but this homemade version was so much better. I will defiantly make this again.

Really good!  I actually made it without the chicken since I was using it as a complementary dish for some chicken.  I will say, though, that I used more pesto than recommended and I still feel like I'll use even more next time.  The flavor isn't very strong.  Still, a tasty pasta dish that I'll be making many times more~

This was probably one of the best dishes I have ever made. The perfect blend of flavor. Only thing I changed was I used fettucine noodles. This was also delicious the next day as a leftover, but it is definitely not as creamy. I added just a bit of chicken broth the next day when I reheated and it still had a great taste. I may substitute some of the heavy cream for chicken broth the next time I make it just to cut down on some calories.

Perfect it you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.
I made mine with Rotini pasta, and added finely grated carrots and extra garlic cloves. I didn't put as much cream as the recipe called for to cut down on the richness. It was so good that I plan to keep this in my memory bank and make it more often!! Super easy and affordable to make.

This is a great and easy recipe to add ingredients and make your own. We often make it with mushrooms. Discovered it when I was looking for a recipe that included pesto and similar to a pesto cavatappi.  Definitely a big hit! My husband and I always save enough for leftovers...as they are just as good or better after the flavors have time to come together! Next time I might take some of the previous reviews into mind to make it a bit healthier.

Very good...family loved it.  I used half and half and increased the sauce.  Next time, I will double it, because as it cools the sauce get's soaked up.  Thanks!!

I made this and I loved it, it was very easy to make.  I did add some cherry tomatoes to the sauce to warm them up before I poured the sauce on the noodles. I would recommend making this.

Kinda bland. I substituted half and half for the heavy cream as other reviewers suggested to cut the fat, so that might have been the reason for the blandness. It was definitely missing something.

I thought this dish was very good. But to give it some more flavor, I sauteed some onions and mushrooms and spinach, before adding the minced garlic. Then I added a hint of chili powder, garlic powder, and lemon juice. I also stirred in a little pesto into the cooked pasta along with some dried parsley before mixing it together with the sauce. For the sauce, I also substituted the cream for the chicken stock but I added 2 tablespoons of fettuccine Alfredo just to thicken it up a bit. This turned out FABULOUS and my hubby loved it!

oh this was delicious, even after reheating the next day. I used shrimp instead, and it turned out just as good as with chicken, and used like 1/2 cup of pesto. Next time I think I will add some black olives sliced, pine nuts, artichoke hearts and maybe some sundried tomatoes, to make it more like a mediterranian meal Ive had at a fav restaurant of mine. I would give it 10 stars if it was an option!! Tasty Tasty!

Wow, this was very good.  I did make a few additions...  I used the Knorr pesto package, two of them actually.  I tossed in some fresh cut-up portobello mushrooms, chopped onion and only a handful of chopped green pepper.  Than after I loaded the plates, I tossed in some cut-up grape tomatoes.  My kids loved this and I was shocked at how good it was too.  Next time, I will cook this just like I did and add even more mushrooms and Parmesan cheese.  May have to try to omit the chicken and use crab and shrimp too!  YUMMY!

I cut the recipe in half and served it over a large amount of wilted spinach. Used fat-free half and half (who invented the stuff, and why did I buy it?) Next time might go with low-fat sour cream instead of heavy cream.Went the easy way and used fresh relish tray on the side and homemade apple crisp with vanilla bean ice cream for dessert. Yup, more fat cal than I needed, but the spinach and veg helped. Everyone seemed to like it.

We've had this a couple times and we really like it. I like to top it with chopped tomato. I think I end up using more pesto than called for.

Instead of heavy cream, I used fat free half and half and also added some white wine to the sauce. I got rave reviews and will make this again.

Nice!  As others have mentioned, there isn't a lot of sauce to generously cover the pasta (I used angel hair instead of penne).  However, I like pasta sauce to be really light, whether it's tomato or white, so the amount was absolutely perfect for me.  The only changes I'd make next time would be to use more garlic and more pesto.  I bought a wonderful artichoke pesto from Wegmans and it was delicious with the sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

Good, simple recipe. It needed a little something to be a very good or great recipe. Maybe more parmesan cheese? Or maybe just more sauce for the amount of pasta? I might try it next time with just 12 ounces of pasta.

We just had this for dinner tonight and all I can say is YUM! Even my 2 year old son LOVED it. The only thing I would do differently next time is double the sauce because it was just a tad dry and we like things more saucy. Other than that it was fantastic. My hubby said this was a definate keeper and it is.

This is so good. I wasn't sure my boys (22 and 15) would like it so I halved the recipe. My mistake!! Those boys at every bit and sopped up the sauce in the skillet with bread! This is definately a keeper. One thing I did a couple times is add broccoli florets in tiny pieces. Delish!

A "taste good" recipe is what the kids call this. I used a home made pesto that was a little messy, but fun to make. One that I got use of my overpriced food processor. An inexpensive and good tasting dish that would make again.

My husband loved this recipe!! I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted half and half. Still turned out great!  My husband is on a no carb diet so I actually used tofu pasta for him and it was still a hit.  I followed directions to a tee.

This was really good.  I didn't add as much cream as the recipe called for, b/c I didn't have it.  I think I will try to tweak it to make it healthier.  Very yummy, though.

This recipe was okay. I substituted half and half for the heavy cream and sauteed some red bell peppers with the chicken and garlic. There's a flavor missing from this dish that I can't quite put my finger on, but it's worth messing with the recipe to figure it out. My husband is super picky, but he really liked it regardless!

It was decent.  I used lactose free milk with a little cornstarch in place of the cream (not only did it cut back on fat/calories, but I was able to eat and not get sick!).  It was decent, but wasn't quite the taste I was looking for.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly as it was stated and it was very good.  Next time I plan on using half and half to make it a little healther.  I may also toss in some red pepper flakes and roasted red peppers for some color.

This is a great pasta dish!  It was good warm and would be good chilled too!  This will be my new weeknight dinner and picnic meal go to.  Will use some of the heavy cream subs next time to make more healthy.  THANK YOU for this!  You could add pine nuts for fun too.  YUMMEEEEEEE!!!!!

Very good.  I used half cream and used chicken broth for the other half.  I added a little more parmessan and finished the dish with pine nuts.

I'm clearly in the minority here, but I just didn't think this was all that fabulous, especially considering the amount of calories and fat in this dish.  I did use more pesto than was called for- I'd have rated this even lower if I hadn't, because it would have been pretty bland otherwise.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad and my whole family (even the three year old) ate it, but no one was too excited.  On the plus side, it came together pretty quickly and uses ingredients I usely have on hand.  However, there are so many other pasta recipes out there that we love, so I don't think we'll try this again.

OK, well I have made this at least a million times by now and you just can't goof it up!  It is by far, my teens favorite dish.  Also, if ya'll are feeling adventurous, one day I had taken out some shrimp and cooked that in the garlic, removed it, cooked the chicken, added the shrimp and WOW!  Adds a whole new dimension.  We are lucky enough here to have pre-cooked marinated frozen chicken here at one of our grocery stores, so this dinner takes me about 15 minutes.  We have it at least once a week!  Oh yum!!!  Add fresh grated romano cheese...can't get any better!

Well I am the person who submitted this recipe.  I love all the hints and I am going to make the Al Fredo version with broccoli this week.  Thanks!  Mary p.s.  In my opinion even just 2 tablespoons of cream gives any cream dish that 'on the tongue' feel that milk or half & half can't do.

This was a very good way to use up the homemade pesto. I had to double the amount of pesto called for because it wasn't as strong as jarred and I added an extra clove of garlic. Next time I think I will use 1.5 cups of liquid for a little extra sauce. Added broccoli and sun-dried tomatos too. Yummy.

Very good, but very, very rich.  I halved the recipe and used jarred Barilla brand pesto.  I used half and half rather than cream and also substituted cubed cooked rotisserie chicken from the deli to save time.  Delish!  Next time I'll add broccoli or maybe a handful of green peas.

This was great!  Very easy and yummy.  I added some broccoli to the penne the last 4 minutes of cooking.  I did also thicken the sauce a little with some cornstarch as one other person recommended.

I'm giving it 10 stars for flavor!  However, I did find that it was a little short on sauce - next time I will halve the amount of pasta and make the same amount of sauce.  I made my own pesto as my basil is a bumper crop this year so it was as fresh as I could get and it was tasty!  We topped with fresh-grated parmesan cheese at the table.  I steamed broccoli to go with it and there was just enough left for lunch the next day.   I'll be making this again - maybe try with shrimp next time.

We have this literally once a week in my house! It's so easy and fast!!! Over the years I have cut back the heavy cream and it's still fabulous!! Doesn't affect the flavor at all. I half the heavy cream it calls for and use 2% milk for the other half... or sometimes light cream.... works either way! So delicious

Easy and delicious!  I sort of "eyeballed" the proportions to make it a bit saucier and pesto-heavy.  Cooked the pasta in one pot, sautéed 2 chicken breasts (bite sized pieces) with chopped garlic and pepper in another, and 1 cup chicken broth, heavy cream and pesto warming in a saucepan.  Dumped them all together, added some parmesan cheese and mixed. Sprinkled grated Romano cheese and red pepper flakes on top before serving.  The red pepper flakes gave it a nice bit of pizazz!  Will definitely make again.

This was great. I went with suggestions from other reviews and tripled the sauce. I used 1 1/4 cup heavy cream, and 2  1/2 cups chicken stock. I then used 4 tbs butter melted and mixed with 3tsp flour to thicken the sauce. Also mixed in 1 cup Romano cheese. Also added in just a bit of onion powder. The whole family loved it - which is a rarity in this household of picky eaters!

As an experienced cook, I wasn't quite sure this simplistic recipe was going to produce a 5-star dish, but it exceeded my expectations. I make my own pesto, and it took this dish right over the top. I didn't change a thing with the sauce. However, I didn't serve it with pasta as we watch our carbs. Had it been served with pasta, I'm sure we would have wanted more sauce. Delicious; thanks, MarySteve!

Started making this recipe two years ago and now it is part of our dinner rotation. I always try to follow the recipe but often end up using milk or half and half instead of the cream if I already have it on hand and that tastes great too. No complaints!

I used cream of chicken with herbs, didn't use pesto, and use garlic salt. It made on my dinner list. Love it

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. Never had pesto before I tried this recipe. Now, I make my own. I am actually making this tonight for dinner. This will be our 8th time making it. It just gets better and better. Thank you!

Very good and easy. I halved the recipe to serve just 3 of us and used regular cream and extra garlic. Once the chicken was cut it literally took only 10 min!

Pretty good! I liked this, and didn't really change much other than using garlic salt instead and leaving out the Parmesan. I used a pack of knorr pesto sauce and had no problems with too much pasta for the sauce. My lactose-intolerance seems to be protesting the heavy cream though, so I may try reducing it and subbing in some chicken broth next time. This is a great recipe for adding that little extra for improving on plain old pesto.

Followed the recipe expect I marinated the chicken in the 'absooluteky fabulous greek dressing'. A recipe I found here and I trimmed down the recipe for 3 servings.I used one chicken breast diced and 1 1/4 cup of pasta.    It was so tasty.  Looking forward to lunch tomorrow since some reviewers indicated it tastes even better as leftovers :)

Been looking for more pesto recipes and this one hit it! Cut the chicken and pasta in half for the two of us, sautéed garlic,added onion and asparagus spears cut up, when soft added chicken till almost cooked through, transferred to a convention oven. Continued to make sauce until thickened, used smart balance milk and added cornstarch to thicken the sauce also added more pesto to taste. Hubby said to add it to the rotation that says alot!

This was very good. I substituted half & half for the cream & whisked in a big tablespoon of flour to help it thicken. The family liked it very much. I soemtimes toss pasta with pesto sauce but I think that this was much better.

Delicious! Made more sauce than called for. Otherwise my pasta wouldn't have been as saucy as I like it. Only other change made was using chicken thighs rather than breasts.

Soo good! My mom usually just makes pasta with the pesto sauce from this jar, but this was 10 times better. We used light heavy cream, and added a little flour. Also increased the amount of pesto. Awesome, easy recipe.

Great and very time friendly!  Didn't have pesto so added 5 strips of fried bacon and sauteed some mushrooms.  Did not use the butter and only half cup of heavy cream . added 3/4 cup chicken broth.

We found the cream competed with the pesto so it ended up being quite bland. We added extra garlic and a yellow pepper which helped alot. We'll give this another shot using chicken broth instead of the cream and a red or yellow pepper...

My whole family loved this recipe.  My husband really raved about this one.  I was trying to find a comparable recipe to the Noodles and Company's Pesto Cavatappi, and this one hit the jackpot.  I just added fresh tomatoes and more Parmesan cheese at the end.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful! But for me it was time-consuming to assemble. Still, excellent. My mistake was in overcooking it a bit. I didn't check until 40 minutes baking time and by then it was a bit dry inside, and crispy on top. I'll make it again but check after 30 minutes baking time. Wow, was this ever good! Could be b/c I used home made pesto and home made alfredo sauce, so bottled stuff may yield a different result. Maybe better, maybe not....

Yum! The pesto I had to make first took much more effort than this--it was so easy! I used farfalle because it's what I had, and also had to use evaporated milk because I don't keep cream on hand, but that single substitution makes this a go-to meal--I have all the ingredients on hand all the time! Well done, and thanks for sharing!

SO SO good! I added a little more pesto, and substituted the heavy cream with chicken broth, and used a flour mixture to thicken it up a bit. Came out great! Will definitely be making this again soon.

This meal was super quick and tasty.  I followed the recipe as it was written with one exception.  I substituted the 4 boneless chicken breasts with two 6oz boxes of the precooked Butterball Chicken Breast Strips to save time.  We will be adding this recipe to our regular rotation because my husband and little ones LOVED it!!

I made a few adjustments due to not having some of the exact ingredients. I substituted 3/4 c. milk, 1/3 c. melted butter and 1/4 c. chicken broth for the heavy cream and I made a pesto recipe from the Taste of Home April/May 2010 issue. I increased the Parmesan to 4T. and topped each serving with more Parmesan after we dished up. It was a little on the bland side, so I will probably increase the salt and add more garlic next time. Otherwise, we liked it. My son is actually finishing his second helping right now.

Awesome!!! Doubled the sauce, used Milk and Chicken stock instead of the heavy cream. Added broccoli and a few sun dried tomatoes! LOVE IT!

I have never tried using pesto before this was a major hit with the entire family. I did not make any changes to this recipe next time though i'm going to use a different noodle. I also used a jar of pesto since i did not have the time to make it from scratch. Will definatly be using this again.

i made this with the chicken broth subbed for part of the heavy cream to reduce the calories.  My family devoured it.

This recipe came out good but lacked flavor. Add some salt and don't be afraid to double the pesto.

Loved this, especially my hubby and I...the kids not as much.  I didn't have heavy cream on hand so I used fat free half and half and it was still delicious!  Great recipe!

This recipe was great.  I followed the recipe listed, and used the "pesto sauce" recipe here on allrecipes.  The only things I changes was that I used a little more garlic, probably 3-4 cloves, and I used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Sure to become a regular in my house!

This dinner came together easily and we enjoyed it.  Didn't really knock our socks off, but it was quick.  I made the chicken and sauce earlier in the day and then made the pasta closer to meal time.

This turned out great! Very simple, very tasty! I used spaghetti noodles in the place of penne because that's what I had in the pantry. I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings. Yummy! Will make this again.

Maybe I made a mistake, but mine turned out runny and kind of bland.  My husband thought it tasted like a Stauffers dinner.  Update:  This is much better the second day!  The noodles absorbed some sauce so it wasn't runny anymore.  It went from 3 to 4 stars for me.  My husband now says he'll eat it again.  He wouldn't have said that the day before.

This is FABULOUS!! I don't usually cook entree recipes (more of a dessert person). But I was craving my favorite chicken penne that I eat at Romano's Macaroni Grill. There were other similar recipes to the chicken penne at macaroni grill.. but I decided to go with something easier. And wow, I was surprised at myself! My penne, although, soaked up all the sauce.. I used half & half and added a 3/4 teaspon cream of tartar. I was going to go with the chicken broth. But I remembered last minute, and it was frozen. Will definitely try this again.. and maybe tweak it a little for a creamier texture. Oh, and instead of using parmesan cheese, I used FRESH mozzarella that I grated on the spot. MMMM!! It just melted through the hot pasta (I added it on top too).

YUM!!!!  We absolutely loved this.  There are only two of us so I used 1 large chix breast and 8 oz of pasta but kept sauce ingredients the same.  I followed the recipe but added a little more here and there to taste.  A little more cream and pesto and just a wee bit more cheese.  We still have enought left over for another meal and we are most definitely looking forward to eating it!

This is a great recipe - quick and easy.  I modified it by using only 8 ounces of penne pasta, chicken that had been grilled yesterday, and half and half instead of heavy cream.  I also added a pinch of cornstarch to help it thicken.  It was WONDERFUL!  We like our pasta with lots of sauce, so this worked out perfect.  I served it in a bowl, topped it with shredded parmesan, and garlic bread.  This will be served many times in the future.....yummm.

Used half & half instead of heavy cream and a little extra pesto. Let simmer for 15 min or so until it thickened. Tossed with spaghetti (all I had). Delicious! My friend, who never compliments my food, only thanks me, said "this is awesome!!". Very rich so a light salad with vinagar and oil would be the perfect side. Easy, fast and yummy dinner!

This was delicious!  I love all things pesto, and was pleasantly surprised how tasty this dish was - at first I thought it might be "too dry", but not so, as the flavour migrated into the pasta and chicken.   In fact it was a nice change for a pasta recipe to have texture as opposed to being ozzing with sauce.    Leftovers were just as delicious the next day.  I used half and half cream, sprinkled some parsley and more parm cheese on top, and served it with peas.

OMG...can we say good! I loved it, and my 2 year old son can't get enough of it! Instead of cream, I added whole milk. I also added way more garlic, I'm a garlic fan. I put about 1 more tablespoon pesto then the recommended. But overall the best pesto pasta I have tried.

This was great but I thought it definitely needed a significant amount of pesto more than the recipe called for. Also I omitted the chicken and added sundried tomatoes and mushrooms and made it vegetarian...delicious!

I couldn't believe that all 5 family members loved this dish! I added some color with chopped tomato, yellow squash and green zucchini. I also used half&half. I have one vegetarian so made a separate dish using the same veggies/garlic/cream/pesto. One of my pickiest eaters said she was going to take the leftovers to work for dinner all this week! In her 20 years she has never said this! Thanks!

Yum!  This dish is easy and very versatile.  I cooked the chicken breasts whole and chopped up after.  Used white wine to deglaze the pan, but couldn't resist a touch of cream (hang the calories), which made the difference between good and great.  Can easily make this with salmon or just veggies or even beef.  I will be making this again!

I didn't have penne, so I used egg noodles, and I didn't have cream, so I used some unflavored yougurt that I needed to use up.  Fantastic!!  My 11 year old son was leary of it, but after a taste insisted on seconds!!  I'll put this in the monthly rotation.

Mmmm!  I really enjoyed this.  It was the first meal I cooked with all the kitchen goodies I got for my wedding, and I made it again yesterday.  I used half&half, since the Trader Joe's near me didn't have heavy cream.  I also upped the garlic and parmesan cheese, and added minced onion (sauteed with the garlic and chicken) and diced tomatoes, for color.  Tasty!  Thanks!

This was really good!!  I made this recipe for 4 servings but still used the same amount of pesto for the full 8 servings (1/4 C) and I think it could have still used one more spoonful.  Also, I added crushed red pepper flakes because it was missing just a little kick for me and it was perfect after that!

I made this dish for a potluck. It was great. It's easy to make and to tranport. The only problem I had was the pasta soak up all the suace during transportation, so it was a bit dried at the end. Other than that, this is definitely a keeper. Thanks.

While this was a fine recipe, I thought it lacked flavor.   I like more zip to my pasta.  I fixed this by adding red pepper flakes. I did not use heavy cream- too many calories.  I used half & half with some cornstarch as was reccomended by someone else. I used @ 10-12oz.of pasta since someone also said that there was not enough sauce.  The family liked it so I will probably make it again.

Great recipe.  I left out the heavy cream and used some chicken broth, Neufchatel cream cheese and extra pesto.  It was wonderful.  My 18 month old even gobbled it up!

EVERYONE asks me for this recipe!  The first time I made it, I had invited some frineds over for dinner and was trying to find something quick and tasy to make them.  There was not an ounce of sauce left in my apartment after people got through with it.  Although everyone had seconds, most for up and had thirds.  Later I was up visiting some friends in Boston who decided they were pretty hungry.  I dug around in their fridge and found the ingredients to make this (or at least enough ingredients to make something close enough).  So I threw it together.  There weren't many of us, and yet people still fought over it.  To date this is still the recipe I get the most requests for.

Overall a good recipe. It was just lacking "something" - I couldn't tell what, exactly. I added some peas and some walnuts to the mix. Makes a lot. Good for lunches all week.

This pasta was very good, however, I did make a few changes to lighten it up a bit. instead of heavy cream, I used part fat free half and half and part chicken broth. I added extra parmesan cheese to thicken the sauce a bit. Rather than sauteing my chicken in the pan, I seasoned it, threw it on the grill, then sliced it up and added it to the saute pan with the garlic and olive oil/butter comb.

This was so good. I made this for my husband and i.  We both loved it.  I Only used 1/2 the pasta and 2 chicken breasts since it was just us eating.  I kept the sauce recipe the same.  For the pesto, I bought a package of fresh basil leaves and used the recipe on the basil packaging in my magic bullet.  This was easy to make and delicious.

Very good recipe. For healthier version: I used extra garlic, half & half instead of heavy cream, Smart Balance light instead of regular butter and whole wheat penne. Even with all this changes
it turned out really good and the whole family enjoyed it.

This was a quick, simple, and delicious recipe.  My picky eaters compiled of my husband, five year old and three year old cleaned their plates.  I used frozen chicken tenders instead of breasts and cooked them through.  I removed them before making the sauce and returned them at the end.  As a footnote I usually always replace the heavy cream in a recipe with half and half to cut the fat.  Turns out beautifully.  Another mention is that I used a 14.5 oz box of pasta and only ended up using two thirds of it, otherwise sauce is scarce and I like sauce.  One last mention is that I probabaly ended up using 1/4c of freshly grated parmesan cheese, it needed more to thicken up the sauce.  None of these things changed the recipe, just personal preferences.  It was great, easy and delicious.

This recipe was easy easy easy. Tasted great. I used sun dried tomato pesto. I would definitely suggest that you season the chicken with salt before browning. I am not a salt lover but It really needed a little something to give it a kick.

LOVED this recipe!  I made some minor changes...to make it healthier I used 1 cup of table cream (18% fat, aka light cream) and 1/4 cup of chicken stock in place of the heavy cream.  I also added some diced sun-dried tomatoes (at my husband's request).  

This is such a delicious, simple and fast meal, using ingredients I always have on hand.  It's versatile too...I think I'll add some mushrooms or broccoli next time, or my daughter suggested some bacon.  5 stars all the way!

Very good!  Very easy!  Very quick!  Made a couple of alterations...didn't have heavy cream so substituted skim milk with a little extra butter.  Added extra cheese to help with the creaminess and it turned out wonderful.

The sauce turned out a little thin for my preference.  Next time, I will use only 3/4 cup of cream, 1/3 cup of pesto, and more parmesan.  Overall the flavor was wonderful.

Delicious!!! But I did make some changes (I know, I know...giving a recipe 5* when you make changed, but they weren't drastic!) Okay: I made this w/o the chicken. So, if anyone else wants to try that, here's what I did. I used a 6.7 oz. jar of pesto (Spice World brand), which I mixed with the cream, olive oil, garlic, Parmesan cheese (used 5 T.), and a dash of grd. pepper. I cooked this until it was thick enough to be a sauce (which took about 15 minutes on medium). It was delicious, mixed with the penne pasta and had with the 'Soft Garlic Breadsticks' from this site & veggies. Wonderful! :)

It's a keeper!  My boys are so picky and they all play lots of sports so my time in limited and so are my meal options since they are so picky, and they loved this!  I add a little more pesto and parm because we love those flavors but that's it really.  It's simple, quick and very tastey!  Winner, winner, chicken pesto pastta dinner!

I've made this a few times for different crowds, and each time people have gone up for thirds.  This is one of my favorite recipes to make!
A made a few changes.  First, to keep the chicken moist, i dredged it in a flour, basil, and pepper mixture before throwing it into the pan to brown.  When making the sauce I also throw in a couple of chicken bouillon cubes, skip the salt, use a fourth cup of cream, a cup of skim milk, some flour and throw in some mushrooms at the end.  Next time I make it I want to try it with sun dried tomatoes.

simple recipe, we've tried this one several times, and found that we like it better without the heavy cream, we haven't found a pesto sauce we really like, but we keep trying. It seems to be a good kid recipe as it goes over well with my to young sons (ages 6 & 3) they like the color.

Absolutely fantastic.  I made this for my wife and I two nights ago and found it to be very easy to make and very delicious to eat!  We both enjoyed it very much.  Add the garlic with the chicken at the beginning for a more subdued flavor and toward the end for a stronger flavor.  5 Stars all the way!

My hubby's favorite. Followed the suggestion of using half cream and half chicken broth. We have used trumpet and bow tie pasta.  Homemade pesto makes it even more yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

Perfect!!!! The only change that I made was to add more pesto, other than that, everything stayed the same. I always season any meat that I am going to cook before hand so I never have any problems with my food being bland, Goya adobo works great. I can also say that I use the Classico pesto and have never had a problem with reheating this dish. I have passed this recipe around and everyone loves it!!!! Definitely a keeper ;)

This had great flavor. The sauce did turn out pretty runny and I tried to thicken it up, but my husband and I were so hungry I just gave up and we ate it as it was. I'd read a few reviews saying it was bland, so I added 2 chicken bouillon cubes to the sauce as it was cooking. I also added extra pesto. This will go on our dinner rotation for sure.

I've already rated this recipe but wanted everyone to know that you CAN reheat this! Another reviewer stated that the oil separated, I didn't have that problem, I used Classico brand Pesto, so you might want to watch what brand you use~

This recipe is easy of course as everyone says and a good base, you can add anything you like, I added halved cherry tomatoes and it was very nice.  I would recommend not eating it as the solitary dish but add a side dish of foccacia, a salad and some red wine of course.

I cut the butter and olive oil in half and used lowfat half and half instead of the cream.  It still had a good flavor and my husband had seconds, so this will be a keeper.  Maybe next time I will use a little flour to thicken it a little more.

Oh my God was this good!!!  I am from the south so I was not use to cooking with pesto and olive oil.  My 22 month old is so picky it is a miracle getting her to eat anything.  She actually ate some of it.  I read some of the reviews and added some things.  I didn't measure anything though I went based solely off of what I thought looked yummy.  I added flour so that the sauce would not be runny, I added sundried tomatoes, and lots of parmesan cheese.  It was delicious!  I will definantly make this one again.  I think that I will cook something other than Mac and Cheese, fried chicken, and tons of greese.  Of course I won't leave my soul food completely out!!  :)

I ended up using 3 cloves of garlic with this dish and 1 cup of fat free half in half and 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  I added cornstarch to the half and half to obtain the thickness.  During the simmering I decided the sauce wasn't enough, so I doubled what was called for.  I added some shredded cheese and about a TB of sugar because with the added cheese and doubling of the sauce the dish was a bit too salty for my taste.  I immediately ate the food, but determined that my second helping was MUCH better than the first-during the time it set the flavors melted together more and gave such a stronger flavor.  Overall, it was a good dish and I'll make it again.

Make this dish often, so good! I use alfredo sauce instead of cream and  toss with angel hair pasta.

This is a favorite family recipe. I use Classico Alfredo sauce instead of cream but double the amount and use more garlic.  Packaged shredded Parmesan is better than the dry type.  My granddaughter wanted the recipe, I gave it to her but did not tell her about the changes I made to the recipe, she likes to wing it too.  In my opinion this receipe deserves 20 stars not five.

Wonderful, simple recipe.  We absolutely loved it.  I cut the cream in half and substituted chicken stock as others have suggested.  I also added a package of sliced baby portabello mushrooms and doubled the amount of pesto and tripled the garlic.  I used corn starch to thicken the sauce because mine was rather watery with the juice that cooked out of the mushrooms and chicken.  This is definately a dish I will cook again!

I fixed this tonight during the Super Bowl.  It is YUMMY!  So fast and easy - this will definitely be made again, and I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

My family really liked this and I was taking a chance because my husband doesn't eat pesto often.  I'm going to try adding some petite-diced tomatoes  next time I make it.

I didn't like this.  It had too much of the chicken juice in it because it tasted wrong.  The recipe obviously doesn't call for you to drain the juices.  For all of the calories and fat in this, I could have made my delicious chicken alfredo.

This was a great recipe to make. The only substitution I made was to use 1/4 less heavy cream and increase the parmesan to 5 tablespoons.  Family loved it!

I made homemade pesto from my basil this summer, and proceeded to look for recipes to use it in.  This was a very good, fast, and easy dish to make.  I only gave it 4 stars, however, because mine was a bit bland and dry until I added extra pesto and more liquid.  Afterward, though, it was very delicious.  I agree with other reviewers that using chicken broth in place of some of the cream would be a good idea for less fat and as well as extra flavor.  I'll try it next time.

Great recipe! Very quick to make. I did add extra pesto and a little extra heavy cream to make it more flavorful. Without extra it may be slightly bland.

This was just okay.  To be fair, I did use half and half instead of heavy cream, but I can't imagine that it made that much of a difference.  It wasn't good enough for me to make again.  I would rather have a healthier dinner and then splurge on a piece of cheesecake for dessert for the same amount of fat and calories!

This recipe was AMAZING! I used 1 cup of half and half and 1/4 cup of chicken stock instead of the heavy cream, and I think this is why my left overs where a bit dry. Netx time I will use heavy cream. It tastes incredible with black olives!!! Everybody loved it!! even my boyfriend who is the pickiest man alive. Thanks for the recipe! =)

Smelled amazing BUT the chicken was swimming in oil. Next time I’ll put in just enough butter to keep the garlic from sticking to the pan and rely on the pesto for any additional oil.

Decided to do the breasts whole, rather than cutting them up before cooking.  This extended the cooking time to 20-25 minutes.  I recommend adding extra Parmesan to the mix (helps with flavor), and use a REALLY big pan - remember that the Penne pasta will be added to the chicken mix.  You want to be able to stir it all together without having it slop over the edges!  Delicious dish.

This was a great recipe!
Since I have a big family I always Have to quadruple the recipes to make enough for everyone, this one is nice and simple, making it very easy to up scale for my family.
I changed the sauce recipe with another one I found and added Adobo to the chicken, it turned out marvelous!

Very filling but not in a way that makes you feel sick. The sauce is light enough that its creaminess doesn't feel fattening. I may be biased because I love pesto but this recipe is a keeper.

On low sodium diet. I subbed 1/2 cream with low sodium chicken broth to cut calories, then added Mrs. Dash Italian seasoning instead of salt and pepper. Two tbsp of flour in a bit more broth served to thicken up the sauce nicely. Served with fresh green veggie and rolls. It was a hit!

I made this with milk instead of cream and it still turned out great!   Adding this to my rotation because it is so fast, inexpensive, and delicious!   Tip:  I always boil my chicken breasts instead because they stay very moist, and then add at the end.

Needs more sauce in my opinion but other than that it was pretty good! The best part about it is the time and the small amount of ingredients!

This is a great chicken pasta dish with a simple to follow recipe. 

It has a bland pesto flavor.  But it's a good bland.  A great basic recipe that can be expanded upon to suit one's taste or just to fix as is.

I made this for my me and my wife. We had the pesto and this was absolutely delicious. Next time we may add mozzarella cheese to top it off. We highly recommend this one. Very tasty and filling.

Made it with Chef John’s Proper Pesto. Delicious. I did reduce the cream by a 1/4 cup and added three more tablespoons of Parmesan. Don’t rinse penne. The starch will help to thicken the sauce.

I only had pre-cooked caprese chicken sausage on hand so I used that. Easy and crazy good. I also tried with recipe after reading other reviews about lightening it up by replacing heavy cream with half and half and little chicken stock. Was a little too runny for my taste when I did that so I added a bit of cornstarch and it was perfect.

I add 2 TBSP of cornstarch mixed in with the heavy cream then add pesto sauce and mix all up before adding to the chicken while sauteing it. I like the sauce a little thicker.  Also, I add strips of red bell pepper to saute with the chicken.   I use more pesto sauce 3/4 of a cup. .  My 3 year old granddaughter loves it!!

I didn’t have penne so used spaghetti noodles, also didn’t have Parmesan so used Feta. I made with chicken broth instead of cream since my boys are lactose intolerant. Added a little flower, but still was a little thin on the sauce. I used full sauce recipe, and half amount of noodles and added extra garlic. Was liked by all.. will make again!

Excellent flavor, very easy and quick.  I made it with already cooked Costco chicken. I didn't have cream so used 2%milk with some corn starch.  It was very good!

This is wonderful. My husband loved it and he can be difficult to impress. An important step for turn out in my opinion is that you mix the sauce with the pasta...add the pasta gradually so you can determine the ratio you prefer (I prefer saucy). This way the sauce does not seem overly runny because some of it soaks into the pasta. 
The oil separates when you heat up leftovers (or at least mine did). I didn't mind but husband called it weird but delicious.

I added mushrooms to the meat when it was frying, and sherry to the sauce. Delish!

I used almond milk instead of cream to keep it healthy and that's what I had on hand. I added some fresh spinach to add veggies. My 6 year old and husband both liked it. I think next time I'll add more parmesan for a little more flavor because I never buy cream.

YUM!! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I probably used twice as much garlic, I didn't measure.  I only made 12 oz(dried) penne pasta and that was plenty.  I used 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup Classico Pesto Sauce. I also made a small cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce a wee bit. Other than that I made it exactly as directed and loved every single mouthful.  Enough left over for lunch tomorrow too.  Thank you so much for posting this, it's a new fav for sure.  Very tasty.

This was very good.  Its hard to find a recipe that my whole family will eat (I have 4 kids ages 1-10), but they all loved this.  I was a little scared wen I saw the green pesto in there, I didn't think the kids would eat it if they saw it, but once they tasted it, it was great.

It was good but bland. Maybe I didn't add enough pesto?

Simple fast and easy.  Great flavors!
I used turkey I had leftover instead of chicken and changed the heavy cream to half cream and half milk. Added some sauté beet greens and spinach to the pan with the garlic.
Since we are cheese lovers I also increased the parmasean to  1/3 cup which help to thicken the sauce.

Delicious, I used half n half and toasted the pecans.  I used the faux pesto recipe from this site.  Also to makes it faster used store bought roasted chicken.

I stayed pretty close to the original recipe, but did use half chicken broth and half cream as several others suggested. And next time will definitely use boneless, skinless thighs for a more tender protein. The sauce was delicious- we could have licked the skillet clean. Very good.

I make something very similar to this (don't measure much but this is very close) but I  add a can of diced tomatoes gives it more substance, color and sauce.

Too greasy. Next time I wouldn't add olive oil and butter. I like things full fat and even I followed others recommendations and used only half cream and thickened some chicken broth. We added onion and green beans to veggie it up. I wish I would have added sun dried tomatoes. Also I only had 1/4 cup pesto and it needed more. We also ended up adding a little more garlic. But some garlic is very strong and some milder so to taste.

I made this tonight, with a homemade Basil Pesto recipe (that I got off the food network) and it was delicious! I did not have any penne so I used shell pastas and otherwise did not change a thing. I used the cheese that this recipe called for AND the cheese for the Basil Pesto recipe and it pretty much tasted like a light pesto alfredo pasta dish. Wonderfully garlicy!!

Picture looks great, but I see red things on the dish that look like they could be sun-dried tomato bits. They would certainly work here, but I see no mention of anything red in the recipe.

I love this pasta dish. The sauce by itself is just wonderful.  If you want to try it without chicken, just add a tablespoon of chicken flavored "Better Than Bouillon" to the sauce...but watch the saltiness.  D'Lish! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is a go to easy weeknight meal for me. I pretty much make it as the directions say. Sometimes I use butter sometimes just oil sometimes both. I tend to cook the garlic a tad before adding the chicken but not much. I don't really measure out the pesto, cream, or parm anymore but it's always delicious!! I tried doing the "lower fat" version recommended with chicken broth but came out a lot more watery. Might as well enjoy it the way written cause I do!!

Simple and delicious! I had some asparagus I needed to use up so I cut it up and boiled it with the penne for the last 5 minutes then tossed it with everything else. Everyone loved it. Even my super picky 7 year old, who complained and said he didn't like it, cleaned his plate. (He's not fooling anyone)

Great taste. I did not have a heavy cream on hand so I used 2% milk and  added a bit of corn starch as another commenter posted. I may have added too much pesto but the results were still tasty. Thank you for the recipe.

Only changes I made was using leftover rotisserie chicken cut up, farfalle pasta, and added some sauteed mushrooms. I did increase my garlic as they were small cloves and a bit more pesto, but so yummy. Very fast

Used, like another reviewer, milk and cornstarch to substitute for cream; also omitted chicken broth and used bit more pesto and spices (including potassium salt instead of table salt). Finally, I served the chicken and sauce over spiralized zucchini. It was delicious! Thanks for a great base recipe that I could adjust to our dietary needs! Will definitely make it again.

Probably one of the nicest pasta dishes ever! So creamy and moist with hunks of flavour. I added extra pesto of course as it's my fav ... Hubby said to throw in some peas or broccoli next time to add some garden greens to the dish, oh but I did add spring onion which gave it some crunch xx

Excellent base recipe! I made this dish with just a few modifications and it was so delicious. I used Perdue frozen chicken strips instead of chicken breast. I marinated the strips in a garlic-based marinade overnight. The next morning, I made the sauce. I substituted Classico Four Cheese Alfredo sauce for the heavy cream and added diced Mezzetta Sun-Ripened Dried Tomatoes for colors. I let the sauce "sit" for several hours to let the flavors go through. I also added twice the pesto called for in the recipe because I love pesto and added garlic powder/red pepper flakes for additional seasoning. By the time, I prepared the penne, the sauce had thickened nicely and the flavor was superb! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Loved it...my boys loved it also.  I added green onions (just for color) and extra pesto and garlic, just cause we love those...over all, it was great.  I wish I could find something that would replace the cream but not change the flavor, just due to the high content of calories/fat.  Otherwise, fabulous, and I agree I would probably add red bell pepper for color.

This recipe was pretty darn good! I did, however, follow the advice of one reviewer and doubled the sauce recipe. I think if I hadn't, the poor noodles would've been somewhat naked! :( But since I doubled it, it turned out really well. Next time I make this, I'll be adding more Parmesan cheese though!

Made as stated above however I did double the sauce as a lot of people said there just wasn't enough and I cut the chicken in to pieces instead of strips just to make it easier to eat. The sauce never really tightened up in the pan but as it sit it did. My hunny was less than impressed with it until I reheated it for a midnight snack with which he ate it all for me. I think if I make again I will make the day before I am serving and just reheat

This was fantastic! As usual, I added a little more garlic than the recipe called for, as well as a little extra shaved Parmesan but I'm sure it would've been just as good without it. In this house, If it passes the picky 4 and 6 year old eater's tests its a winner and this was thumbs up all around!

I've made this so many times that I don't even need the recipe anymore. A few changes I make:

1- I use a full cup of pesto sauce. (We love pesto- the more flavor, the better.)
2- I add a tablespoon of flour to the sauce to help thicken it. It takes approximately 15-20 minutes of stirring over low heat to get the consistency we like, but it's worth it.
3- Sometimes I cheat and use the pre-cooked and pre-sliced chicken breast meat.

This also reheats well for leftovers. I admit it's not the healthiest recipe, but it's certainly a delicious one!

This was great the first time I made it, but I made the following adjustments and it was even better:  added fresh spinach, pine nuts, extra pesto, and extra garlic.  I also used 2% evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream.  Next time I'm going to try it with lemon zest and artichoke hearts.

Really good! Like something you would get at Olive Garden or Carrabba's. Made it as-is except substituted half and half for heavy cream because I didn't have any, and probably doubled the Parmesan cheese 'cuz we like our cheese!

This dish did not turn out as creamy as I'd hoped. There was basically no evidence of the cream in the finished product. Maybe I would use additional cream next time.  I added a bit more pesto as suggested in other reviews but it was a bit overwhelming. I'd stick with the original 1/4 cup if I tried again. Also, 1 tablespoon oil would have been plenty, 2 TBSPs was a bit much. AND there were too many noodles in this recipe.

I've made this twice, with my favorite pesto recipe, and it is very good. The only difference being that I don't use the butter when cooking the chicken, and use olive oil only.

I thought this was a quick and easy recipe.  I made just a couple adjustments based on previous reviews.  I like a lot of chicken, so I put in an extra chicken breast.  I also thickened the sauce a little with corn starch.  Great recipe when you need a fast meal.

Soooo easy and delicious. I needed something quick and this was the best thing I have found for a busy week night. I used a rotisserie chicken and classico's basil pesto to make it even quicker. Whole family loved it. I got this recipe by using my allrecipes spinner app. Love that app.

Wow, is this recipe ever good! I did follow it almost exactly but I would say that next time I will try to use the part cream/part chicken broth adjustment because it is extremely rich with just the cream. As per my husband, I just 'have to' make it again.

For years I have always wanted to make a nice creamy pesto, and never tried to make one from scratch. This was incredibly delicious. I only used one chicken breast (next time I will try 2). I added a bit of extra cheese though, and went with a mix of Parmesan and Romano. The Romano gave it that extra bite, that sent this dish over the top! I can't wait to make it again.

This is DELICIOUS!  Like "from a restaurant" delicious!  The only things I did differently were I used the Perdue pre-cut grilled chicken strips because I just hate cutting raw chicken, it's a chore and time consuming......I just cut the strips into bite-sized pieces.  Then I'm really just "warming" them with the butter and garlic and not really cooking them.  Also I used sun-dried tomato flavored pesto instead of normal pesto....only because my hubby does the grocery shopping and I wrote "pesto" on it and that's what he came home with.  It was WONDERFUL so that's how I'll make it from now on!  A+

Just finished making this for our potluck lunch before the football game! Absolutely amazing! I added carrots and peas for a little color and didnt have enough parmesan on hand to double the sauce so I used about 1/4 cup of shredded italian cheese blend! So Yummy! Thanks for the recipe, definitely a keeper!

Halved the pasta and doubled the sauce, using extra garlic, chicken broth, and flour to thicken. Came out great! I'll be making this again

Loved it!  I added tomatoes and mushrooms, which were yummy, but the taste would be there without.  I also ripped apart a cooked rotisserie chicken because I was in a rush and that worked well too.

Just the right amount of pesto and cream.  Very easy to make.  I used canned salmon (what I had on hand) and it was good.  My kids gobbled it up, and my husband (who is usually picky about creamy sauces) liked it too.  Highly recommended!

Love this Dish! Its my "Get out of Jail Free Dish" With my girlfriend. I have my tweeks in the dish like i like to season the chicken before adding it to the noodles. But other than that the recipe is perfect. Ps.. Goes great with Garlic Bread.

quite nice - I used twice as much pesto as the recipe called for but my family still felt it lacked punch.  If I make it again I will add diced salami or some other spicy meat.

I followed this exact recipe, I usually try to do that the first time with all recipes. It was really good, but I found that there was not enough sauce for all of the pasta. It is also a dish you can't really warm up the next say because the oil from the sauce will seperate when heated up. Pretty good dish, I may make it again sometime.

It's a keeper.  Could maybe add some mushrooms next time.  We used less that a full box of pasta and 3 chicken breast and there seemed to be ample sauce.  I think a little more than 1/4 cup of pesto used too.

Excellent! Made this with 2 chicken breasts and about 1/2 box of medium shells. Used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup whole milk. Also added some cherry tomatoes from the garden, sliced in 1/2 - added to chicken before adding cream,pesto etc. My 2.5 year old loved this, even as leftovers.

Excellent and so fast and easy!  I followed the recipe, but used low fat half and half and more pesto. Hubby raved.  Great time to make this with the summer basil coming in so well this year! Definitely will make again, and might add mushrooms and onions if I happen to have them.

Good base recipe- I used 1/2 half-and-half and 1/2 milk instead of all the heavy cream, and added a bit of flour to thicken it up.  Turned out pretty good!  I would probably make a bit more sauce next time.  Added some onion and spinach to the sauce which probably made it taste a bit dryer but were good additions.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was easy to make and really good.  However I did double the sauce recipe like the other ladies suggested and used half/half I think whole cream is a bit too rich for my taste buds.  It was a great recipe and thanks for sharing.

Just finished a plate of this and it was HEAVENLY!! I didn't have enough penne so had to use some spaghetti, which was ok, but I can see the penne being the one to use. Anyway..everyone had a fit. My son said he would try it later, but after listening to us moan and groan he had to have a plate! lol It was so simple to put together and we felt it was restaurant quality, at a much cheaper price. Like others I added more garlic and pesto, which didn't hurt one bit. I think next time I will try it with some grilled shrimp. Thanks for sharing with us.

Great recipe, I used it for a nutrition class and everyone loved it, though I made some substitutions like more olive oil instead of butter. Also, it was easier to cook the chicken and then mix it in with the sauce, it prevented overcooking the chicken

sooooo GOOD!!  used already cooked left over chicken that was breaded (another good recipe from best foods)... so I just diced it and followed the directions but cut the time down... otherwise followed to a T.  my 12 year old LOVED it.  will make again with and without chicken depending on the nights menu.  This one is a keeper for sure!

Wow, we loved this pasta! I did add some mushrooms and marinated artichoke hearts. Since I had already baked the chicken in the oven before finding the recipe I sauteed the mushrooms and garlic in 2t of butter and skipped the olive oil.I like really saucy pasta so made double the sauce since I added some things. Turned out perfect. Nice pesto flavor without being overwhelming. I will certainly make this again.

This meal was really easy to make and was excellent! I did use 1 cup of half in half and 1/4 cup chicken stock instead of heavy cream and that was perfect. My only recommendation would be to maybe double the sauce recipe if you want it to feed more than 2 adults and 2 children. I like to have leftovers, so I will double it next time. I also did not add the pasta to the sauce, I just poured it over each individual one when serving. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this recipe the first time and now my husband wants it every week.  I add double the garlic and use chicken broth instead of the heavy cream.  I season the chicken and let it marinate in the frig for a few hours before cooking.   Top it off with parmesan cheese and we eat it all until its gone.  Yummy!!

This just wasn't as good as it could have been.  Even my pasta loving kids weren't all that impressed.  We decided it was too heavy and rich.  If I make it again I think I would add lemon and maybe some asparagus.

Dish was a little dry.  Next time I would want a lot more sauce with it.  I used linguine, which I don't think worked real well with everything else.  I bumped up the pesto to almost double what the recipe called for; gave it some great flavor.   My wife loved it!

Awesome!  My 9 year old daughter LOVES to cook and this was a perfect recipe for her to assist and take most of the credit!  Definately a keeper in our kitchen.  I, like others, added fresh baby spinach to the mix to add a bit of color.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  I used cheese tortelloni instead of penne. I used leftover chicken, made the sauce earlier in the day to let the flavors blend, reheated it right before serving.  Doubled the pesto, added more garlic.  Tasty!

I used half and half which still turned out too rich for my taste.  However leftovers the next day were great as the sauce had more time to meld together.  I used chicken tenders which is white meat but has very little chance of drying out like regular chicken breast meat.  If I make this again I'll probably use half cream and half chicken broth as others have.

Another hit with the hubby & kids!  Used pre-cooked, frozen chicken and subbed 1/2 cup of half & half & the rest skim milk because it was what I had.  Delicious!  This will for sure make a return in my rotation.

This was good.  I liked the flavor.  Next time I am going to use less Penne.  It seemed like there needed to be more sauce with the amount it called for. It doesn't taste as good warmed up either.

This tasted really good, but wasn't very pesto-y. I realize that being made with cream it wouldn't have a traditional pesto flavor. I made it with a 1/3 cup of pesto, and it still needed more.

I followed this recipe almost exactly. I used all the ingredients called for but I added a little more cream, and eye-balled pasta amount. I think I added a little more pesto b/c it didn't look "green" enough for me LOL. I was worried about low ratings saying it was bland/dry but I thought it was great! I would make this again. TIP: keep sauce and pasta separate, and just add sauce to your liking, don't combine all at once.

Excellent... with a few changes for us.  We used more pesto, and spaghettini pasta instead of penne.  And we went with the chicken broth instead of the cream.  We will definately have this again :)

A quick and tasty evening meal which was especially enjoyed by my picky youngest daughter. I used an extra clove of garlic and added it in when the chicken was half cooked as I have a habit of burning garlic. I also used extra parmesan. Thankyou for the recipe Marysteve

This dish was absolutely delicious!!! I will definitely be making again and again! I used half and half instead of the heavy cream and added a dash of white wine. I also added some broccoli and cauliflower towards the end of cooking. Make sure to use shredded parm and not grated!! I only had grated on hand, and it did not melt well. Made the sauce look lumpy, but it still tasted wonderful! I also doubled the sauce and added a bit more pesto than called for.

I've got to be honest, we were not fans.  I give it 3 stars because I think it has potential, but we felt like the chicken was pretty bland and when the recipe is pretty much chicken and pasta, flavor in both is key.  If I ever try this again I'll definitely add some more flavor to the chicken and add some veggies or something.

This was delicious!!!!!  Per others, I also added more pesto (my own homemade recipe).  I also shredded a whole roasted chicken because I had one on hand, and added freshly grated blend of asiago and parmesan (which is what my boyfriend and I always do with pasta).  Easy to make and so so good to eat!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Great base recipe, try adding 1/2 cup whipping cream and 1/4 cup pesto.  It makes it saucier and has a strong pesto finish.  Perfect when eating with bread.

Excellent....I doubled the sauce and added a can of artichoke hearts.  I used basil pesto and add a bit more parmesean cheese.  This option depends upon how much you like cheese.  Taste and adjust has always been my way.

Very good.  Like many others, I doubled the sauce and put in a lot more parmesan cheese.  I lost track of how much cheese.  My girls even liked it!!!

I decreased the pesto to 1/8 cup since my husband isn't a big fan it, and used 3/4 cup of chicken broth and 3/4 cup of low-fat half and half in place of the heavy cream.  The sauce was still very tasty. I also added cooked broccoli florets, and decreased the pasta to 12 ounces.  I thought the recipe was great with my few changes.

I made this last night for me and my husband.  He will usually eat anything. We did not like the taste of this dish at all. Too strong on the garlic and way to much noodles (there wasn't enough sauce). It ended up being very dry.  We stuck some pizza rolls in the oven!

Hubby was skeptical about this recipe, but then ended up inhaling dinner. I loved that it was easy enough for a weeknight meal, but it's also fancy enough for guests. I added some portobello mushrooms, which was a nice addition, but not necessary. Next time I make this I would like to add sun-dried tomatoes to see how that tastes. Very good.

My chicken did not turn out so well (my own fault), but this is a great sauce.  I would add more pesto next time, and leave out the chicken all together, or maybe grill it prior to adding.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Very tasty.

I love this recipe! It was so easy! I actually made it for lunch and ate it again for dinner. My family had rave reviews. I also took advice from some other reviews and used half and half. I used more chicken stock to make more sauce and it came out perfect! This is definately a favorite on my list.

We had family over at the last minute and I already had the chicken out to cook.  I must admit that when I read this recipe I though it sounded to easy.  When all was said and done everyone complemented on how good it was.  Even the kids loved it! This is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe,incredibly easy. I agree with an earlier review,it needed salt and pepper. I added a little more Parmesan cheese. I also tossed in some pine nuts and sprinkled it with fresh basil. A definite keeper. Thanks for an easy week night dinner.

This is very easy to make and has a good flavor.  I used store bought pesto, (only because i was short on time)  added 1/3 of a small onion chopped,used fresh minced garlic from a jar, half and half rather than heavy cream -adding a little cornstarch- and added only half of the cooked penne, which was more than enough.  Over all, very quick and easy and definately something I will make again.

Great easy recipe. Exactly the taste I was looking for. I used the author's suggestion of half chicken stock, half cream. I thickened it with a bit of flour. My toddler LOVED it and my husband had seconds.

I am a huge pasta fan, but i get tired of eating the same pasta dishes all the time. This is a great option! It came out perfect and my boyfriend loved it. I would suggest adding a little more pesto than it calls for though. Thanks!

Delish! I used milk instead of the cream, omitted the parmesan, added three finely chopped sundried tomates, and upped the garlic to four cloves (big fan) but otherwise followed the recipe. I will definitely make this again; might add a little bit more pesto next time.

Loved it!  I used the half&half with flour and then used extra pesto and parmesan like others suggested.  Works well with shrimp too (check out the Creamy Pesto Shrimp recipe).

This dish was okay.  I followed it exactly, but I didn't think it had much flavor.  My fiance spent most of the meal shaking the sauce off of his because he felt like it was too creamy.  If I ever make this again, I'll be doing some significant alterations to the recipe.

Super yummy for the entire family; I added   broccoli, mushrooms, two chicken thighs, and 1/2 cup more of the half and half and two tblspns more of the grated cheese.  It was delicious!  Next time, I think I'll add cherry tomatoes; with me the more vege's the better and I think (whole) cherry tomatoes cooked in with the broccoli will really give this dish an extra kick of flavor.

Awesome!! (And, quick 'n' easy!!) Added in red onion, frozen chopped broccoli, extra Parmesan, and Penzey's Black & Red (cayenne / black pepper).  Used Barilla Rotini Plus noodles. Topped my portion with red pepper flakes and Romano cheese. (Even the kids ripped this up!)

This was easy and delicious.  I substituted fat free half and half for the the heavy cream.  I added whole wheat flour to thicken it up.  I used a  homemade pesto recipe from "The Joy of Cooking."  I also added chopped spinach, sundried tomatoes, and 1 can of drained diced tomatoes.

This was quick, easy and very tasty.  The only thing I would do differently is to mix the sauce up seperately first and then pour over the chicken and use more pesto than called for.  I added some sliced fresh mushrooms and this made for a great lunch.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  Almost tripled the pesto - we like Pesto in this house - and it was perfect.  Used whole wheat and enriched pasta - perfect for this recipe.  Good stuff - great for entertaining.

I tried someone's suggestion to use half-and-half instead of cream and the sauce came out much too thin.  Perhaps I'll try it with the cream next time.

This recipe is quick and easy, which I love.  My family enjoyed it.  I used parmesan-reggiano cheese instead of just parmesan. I bet asiago cheese would be good too. I will try that next time.

This was good.  I used fat free half and half with more parm.  I also used a package of pre-cooked chicken to save time.  I thought it needed more than a 1/4 c of pesto.  I added more than 1/2 c and I could have added more.  I will make again.  oh I also added mushrooms and a few sundried tomatoes.  yum

Yum!  I ran up to my computer to try to find a quick dish to use cooked chicken, pesto, and bowties that I had in the kitchen.  I tossed the chicken and garlic in olive oil for a few minutes and subbed in skim milk for the cream because that's all I had.  I doubled the pesto and added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken.  All this took less than 20 minutes and my husband thinks I'm a genius.  I am, thanks to you!

A nice change to the typical Pesto Pasta.  I used fat-free half & half instead of heavy cream and it turned out well.  I just simmered a bit longer to reduce the sauce.

WOW this was so good, and a huge hit for an evening with friends.  my friend isn't so big on super creamy, so i substituted the chicken stock for half of the cream and low fat half and half as I heard from others - but it ended up a little on the runny side.  i added some flour and it turned out perfect and stuck to the insides of the rotini noodles i had on hand.
the pesto, parmesan, garlic and cream combo is so wonderful and delicious!  we're adding this to our rotation for sure.

I'm not normally a fan of cream-based sauces but my fiance is and I love, love, love pesto so I thought this recipe might be a good one to try.  We weren't disappointed!  I mixed in a handful of sun dried tomatoes and some frozen veggies (green beans, broccoli, asparagus and edamame).  He absolutely loved it and is looking forward to the next time we have it for dinner.  I want to try it with less cream next time--we'll see if he notices.  :)

Really yummi. Tried it with smoked turkey instead of chicken and that really gives it a punch. I would recommend using slightly more pesto, say 90 g instead of 60.

A great addition to this recipe, also adds a great smokey flavor is apple smoked bacon. Just fry or microwave up about 6 slices and chop into bits and add with the cream and parm. Gives the pasta a little more substance and adds an amazing flavor!

EXCELLENT!  My family loved this.  I did make a little extra sauce because I was worried it would be too dry.  It was perfect with a little more sauce.  This will be a favorite! THANKS!

I'm a new bride who is just learning to cook. This recipe was very easy to assemble and follow, although I would have liked it to be a bit more flavorful. Next time I'll increase the sauce porportions and look for something to add more flavor.

Great Recipe!  I use milk instead of heavy cream to cut back on calories and the dish was still very rich.  I'm making this again tonight and will make extra because there was none left last time!

Very quick and easy for a more "complicated" tasting meal!  To make it healthier, I substituted fat-free half and half for the cream and homemade spinach pesto for reuglar basil pesto.

Soo good! Substituted heavy cream with Clasico Alfredo Sauce, and added Baby bellas and broccoli.  It was a big hit for the family, and very easy to make!

Excellent taste and easy to make.  I used skim milk rather than cream, and then just thickened it a bit with a cornstarch slurry.  turned out great.

I may be the odd one out here, but I did not like it. I tried making this for my boyfriend as a lighter healthier meal (ok maybe not that healthy.. but..). It tasted ok the first time, but it wasn't that great after eating too much of it.

I thought this was great! It was fast,easy and delicious. I was going to half the cream and put in broth like suggested but didnt have it like I thought, so instead I added a little cream of chicken soup and some extra garlic and pesto. I never knew I liked Pesto until now! Hubby who's a picky eater loved this too. Definitly a keeper!

My family loves this recipe!  I use just a little more heavy cream and pesto so we have plenty of sauce.  Otherwise, great as it!!!!  My 13 year old (picky eater) cannot get enough of this dish!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was good, but next time I'll try  less heavy cream,
add chicken broth, more parmasean cheese
Add diced ham or procuitto, cooked broccoli.  I had to thicken the sauce with corn starch.

I thought this was good, but nothing too exciting. However, my fiance loved it! I added a handful of sun-dried tomatoes to the sauce. This gave it some zing and I would definately recommend it.

This was excellent!  I was so happy about how it turned out.  I used a bit less pesto and a bit more parmesan, but that's just to my taste.  I would make this again and often - in fact, my family may get tired of it because I liked it so much!

My family absolutely loved this recipe. It's almost a restaurant quality recipe. My brother is visiting and said that he didn't like pesto and I said ok. We'll we'll just try it and he wanted me to make it the next night as well. I didn't put as much pesto as recommended though and it was still very yummy. I'm making it tomorrow for my mother-in-law!

Its a really good, really easy recipe.  As everybody else though I modified slightly.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used milk.  I added cornstarch to thicken.  I also added some marscarpone cheese, maybe 1/4 cup.  It really seemed to bring the sauce together, mellow out the flavour a little, and thickened it a tiny bit too. I also used lots of parmesan cheese!
Thanks for the recipe!

I make this almost once a week!  My husband and I love this dish, and I love how easy it is to make.  I put 4 or 5 cloves of garlic and substitute chicken broth for half of the heavy cream, as Mary (the author) suggested.  Delicious!

Made this last night and I thought it was great. All I had was bow tie pasta, so that is what I used. Also added more garlic. Even my daughter who had dinner before ate some because it smelled so good, Thanks for the recipe.

This was fast, easy and delicious. Sundried tomatoes would make this a 5 star recipe. I used bow tie pasta which made it look more appealing. Could be a main dish or a side dish.

This is a quick and easy recipe for something that tastes delicious.  I left out the chicken and used farfalle (bowtie) pasta to make a wonderful side dish.  Very happy with this one!

I have been looking for an easy chicken recipe that tastes great, and this is it!! I used a mix of heavy cream and light cream, but I think next time I will try either all light cream, or half light creamand half chicken broth to cut the fat a bit. But as written...YUMMMYYYY!!!!

This recipe was awesome!  I did tweek it a bit.  I marinated my chicken in Italian Dressing over night.  I also used 1/2 C chicken broth and 3/4 C heavy cream.  I used the pre made pesto by Digorno.  It was delicious!  Thanks Mary - definately a keeper!

This recipe was okay.  I made the sauce with 1/2 chicken bullion, but it seemed dry to me.  I probably won't make it again.

I should have followed the recommendation to substitute chicken broth for half of the cream.  It was way too heavy and an artery clogger if I've ever tasted one.  The pesto was really the dishes only redeeming feature and frankly I've had better that incorporate other flavors and vegetables such as the inclusion of sun dried tomatoes.

This was ok. I would cut down on the heavy cream to make it thicker. It would taste better if you followed the recipe for creamy pesto shrimp (substitute the shrimp for chicken). Also, fresh pesto is better than jarred.

Excellent!  I did substitute 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 milk for the heavy cream.  Also added some red pepper flakes and some Cajun spice. Just delicious!

This was the biggest hit of the night during an Italian Buffet Party I had -- People loved this. I did incorporate some roasted chicken tortellini from Sams Club. A winner! I cannot wait to make this again.

My family really liked this dish.  It was quick and easy to prepare and had a very good flavor. This is a good recipe for busy weeknights--easy to keep the ingredients on hand and quick to put together.  I used sun-dried tomato pesto and it was very good.

I did NOT think this recipe was that great.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it came out a bit bland and boring.  I expected more from all the great reviews this recipe got.  It was quick and easy, but, with all of the other great recipes on this website, I will not be making this again.
