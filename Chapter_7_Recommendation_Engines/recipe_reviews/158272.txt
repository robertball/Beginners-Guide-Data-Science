I gave this a 4 only because I think it could use a little bit more "oomph" in terms of taste but I think once I play with  seasonings this will become a 5 in my book. My husband and I are no longer wheat-consumers due to allergies, so I used rice pasta instead which worked out really well, I couldn't even tell the difference.  I thought a cup of olive oil was a bit too much so I used less, but I think next time I will use the whole cup--the olive oil not only adds moisture but some of the flavor it was missing as well.  This salad might be even more interesting with some chopped olives thrown in, and maybe a little bit of chopped onion.  All in all this is a recipe I'll definitely make again--it was quick, easy, was satisfying, and made at least 4-6 servings which surprised me.

We really enjoyed this - even the kids.  I used a little less olive oil than was called for - maybe around 3/4 c., but everything else I did as directed. 
I will definitely make this again - but next time I'll add some tomatoes and maybe some sliced avocado!  Yum!

This recipe is great. I am not much of a fish person, but we received a very large smoked salmon as a gift. Needless to say, I had to find several salmon recipes to use all of it, and this one was, by far, the best. I actually added some tomatoes and I used about 2/3 cup of oil. My husband and I loved it!!

This was very, very good. I was looking for something to make with a can of salmon and pasta and this was perfect. I didn't have broccoli so I saut√©ed a zucchini instead; I also added a chopped tomato and half a can of chick peas and a bit of chopped onion. I couldn't believe that a cup of olive oil wouldn't be too much so I only used a half but I think next time I will try a cup. This made a huge bowl of pasta salad and the dressing was readily absorbed. It was still good though with half the oil so suit yourself.  Nice with a good grated cheese on top. This is a very flexible recipe. Thanks!

So light and refreshing, the perfect summer recipe! I used orzo pasta because it's what I had on hand. I also omitted the soy sauce (because I forgot it), lightly steamed the veggies before adding, used only 1/4 olive oil, and used lemon-infused white balsamic vinegar in place of the red and lemon juice. To punch up the spice I added Italian seasoning and a generous amount of Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb blend. Finally, I topped each serving with sliced grape tomatoes. Super yum!

An excellent luncheon recipe for a hot summer day.  I only used 3/4 cup olive oil and that was plenty.  I also used 3 tsp soy sauce.  As another reviewer suggested, I added small cubes of cucumber.  Fast and easy to make and best of all there were no leftovers!

YUM. This is so tasty... I was out of olive oil so I had to used vegetable oil and minced garlic. I also used steamed zucchini and yellow squash instead of carrots and broccoli. It was so good! Thanks!

I would agree that 1 cup olive oil is more than needed.  I used 3/4 cup and added extra vinegar.  I would agree with other reviewers that it was a little bland, so added Garlic Pepper, Italian seasoning.  Next time I will add something else, probably more vinegar.  I also added capers and olives.

Tasty, even tho I changed it somewhat.  Having no red wine vinegar, I used balsamic, also used that refrigerated lemon juice in a plastic squeeze bottle.  And it worked fine to thaw two bags of frozen broccoli florets w/other veggies.  Also tossed in some cucumber.

Made this with some day old silver salmon from the Kuskokwim river in western Alaska.  I was short on olive oil and used a blend of olive and canola.  Also didn't have red wine vinegar so I used a mix of white wine vinegar and red wine.  Maybe it was the oil, but we did not care for it.

I really like this.  It was simple to make, and has a basic flavor which will appeal to kids.  However, as a grownup, I think I'd like this dish even more if it had a little bit more zip, say, red pepper flakes, chiniese five spice, or szechuan spices.  But this definitely going into my summer repertoire.

This was a very nice way to deal with some leftover cooked salmon!  In addition to the salmon, the only other change I made was to use whole wheat farfalle.  Served on spinach with tomato slices, I discovered that the tomatoes gave it a nice zing of flavor.  I wish the dressing had a bit more depth of flavor, as well.  These are generous servings.

It was easy and really good, but I put only 1/2 cup of olive oil and added some dill. Perfect for lunch.

Good starter recipe - can use whatever veggies you have on hand (I went with edamame) and the dressing is quite good but just a little too much oil (3/4 cup would be just about right).

I thought this recipe was just OK.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than using rotini instead of bow ties.  It was tasty enough to eat, but I don't think I'd make it again as written.  There was a bit too much red wine vinegar for my taste, and I thought it was missing something.  I don't know what.  Maybe black olives or fresh diced tomatoes or chopped green onions or some fresh herb or another.  If I make this again, it will be with some doctoring.

Having made this recipe a few times (including twice this week), I thought it was time to rate it.  This is a great recipe, with the entire cup of olive oil.  I first made it with less, but it made the dressing too sour.  Definitely make the dressing as written, but taste as you add it to determine how much you need.  This will be one of my basic recipes.

I didn't have soy sauce or red wine vinegar. I used balsamic instead,plus used Mrs Dash for salt/pepper. I sauteed the garlic in oil and added to the dressing. It tastes better that way. I added lightly cooked spinach for color and nutrient value. Tasty from the start. Probably be incredible after a few hours.

As written, this is a good start.  I think the farfalle isn't sturdy enough for a pasta salad so I used cellentani.  I'm not a fan of canned meat so I used salmon filets.  Next time I won't cook the broccoli and carrots, and  I thought the dressing was too oily.  The next day I added some bottled greek dressing, calamata olives, feta cheese and grape tomatoes.  It was much better with the Mediterranean spin on it.

I was looking for a recipe with canned salmon and found this recipe that my family loved!  It is a delicious recipe that can be as versatile as you want it to be.  I sauteed vegetables that I had on hand and tweaked the dressing by adding some herbs.  I also kept the pasta, dressing, and salmon separate and let everyone add as much of each as they wanted.  I will definitely make this again!
