This was a great recipe that is simple and delivers a nice kick!  The chili came together quickly and the longer it simmered the nicer the flavors settled in to a flavorful chili.  We grilled the dogs and served with chips!  We loved it and will be making it again for summertime outings!

Who doesn't like hot dogs with chili on top? I'm glad to have an easy recipe to make from scratch. I did think the chili was a little dry and needed to be a little sweeter.

What's more all-American than a hot dog?  We liked the flavor of the chili topping, but it needs a bit more "oomph" to be truly Texan, lol!  The mild chili flavor is perfect for kids, though.  For adults, the addition of more chili powder and, definitely the jalapenos, would add a touch of heat.  I was worried that the chili had no salt, but it didn't need it, once everything came together.  Solid chili topping for dogs--Go, Ball Park Buns!  I'm an Allstar, and I received a coupon to try Ball Park products.  The opinions are my own.

The whole family loved this recipe! Only one was able to handle the jalapeños. Great flavor and clearly, it was piled high with toppings and the buns didn’t get soggy at all! This will definitely be a staple Summer meal for sure!

I wasn’t a fan of the onion and bell pepper inside the chili- otherwise it’s a good chili recipe. I’m a wimp and left out the jalapeño. Pretty good chili dog!

Delicious and perfect for our 4th of July celebration!  The chili was simple to put together and a perfect complement to the hot dog.  Next time I would leave the jalapeno  off, but, other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

7.2.18  I did add some red pepper flakes to the chili to kick up the spiciness a bit.  Served with Frijoles a la Charra (also from this site) and some corn chips  Tasty chili dog, enjoyed!!

Husband and I both loved this recipe!  I made as shown and was worried some flavors might be stronger than others, but not at all!   So good and will make again!  Thank you for sharing!!  Us Texans do like our chili :)
