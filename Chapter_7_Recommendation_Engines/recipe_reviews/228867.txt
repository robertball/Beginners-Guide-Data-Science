This was........interesting. Not bad, just interesting. I did add some fresh ground pepper but other than that, I kept to the recipe.

I used garden fresh chives and radishes. I shredded the radishes and added pepper. I used it as a dip with pretzel thins. I think next time I'll use more radishes.

Way to bland  - I added seasoned salt and cajun seasonings which still didn't help. Thanks anyway.
