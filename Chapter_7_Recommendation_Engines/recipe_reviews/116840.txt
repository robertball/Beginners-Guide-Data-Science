What I love about Fajitas are the veggies, and this dish has them. I love the taste of the peppers and onion together, but I like more seasoning. This was a little bland with just the cumin. I've made these a few times and like adding taco or fajita seasoning packets in place of the cumin. Also add avocado, black beans, black olives and jalapenos on occasion.

This was very good - perfect light meal for a hot summer day and a great way to use peppers.

I made these for the first time tonight and they were FABULOUS!! The filling was more than enough for two burritos, so I used the rest as a side dish (which was tasty in itself, as it was cheesy, creamy and flavorful). I didn't modify the recipe, except for that I added some cayenne pepper and seasoning salt since my BF and I like our Mexican food on the spicey side. I served refried beans along with this easy-to-prepate dish. DEFINITELY making this one again!

This was okay. I think if I made it again, I'd just forget about the burritos and serve the filling as itself as a side. The changes I made were that I added some sliced crimini mushrooms to bulk it up a little and substituted chopped leeks for the onion.

Good recipe, perfect for summers when you have an abundance of peppers and want something quick for dinner. Four stars only because it is rather mild, I had to double the cumin and even after that I added some fajita seasoning to give it the kick I wanted.  The brown rice is good in this burrito, makes the whole thing more filling.  Thanks for sharing!

Really nice burritos.  I'm not a fan of rice in burritos usually, but this I didn't mind at all and actually really liked.  I may not have added the rice except I had leftover Brazilian White Rice with peas and I wanted to use it up.  I didn't have enough tortillas either (I used smaller, blue corn tortillas, but the leftovers are good as a side dish as well.  These burritos are really good with salsa, and I'm glad I found a vegetarian burrito that I like.  Thanks for the recipe!

Nice burrito recipe.  It is a very mild filling, so if you're looking for spicy, look elsewhere.  I didn't have as many peppers as it called for so I added some frozen corn and it tasted very good.  Served it with mango salsa and black beans.  We enjoyed it and I will make it again.
