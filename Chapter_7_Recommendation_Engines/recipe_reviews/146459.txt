The only change I made was to puree one of the cans of beans before adding it to made a thicker but less chunky soup.  Delicious!

I added more cumin, chili powder, garlic and another cup of chicken broth - yummy!  Every drop was eaten.  (I used 1 tbsp or chopped jalapenos instead of the chiles).  Will definitely make again soon.  Easy to prepare.

Very good!! I was a bit unsure about this, as I am not a 'bean' person.  But the Chili/Mexican flavoring, along with the cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips, made a believer of me!!! Based on this recipe slightly modified, I further made these modifications to the recipe: 7 T. flour, 1-1/2 tsp. chili powder, 3 cans of chicken broth, 3 cans of Northern beans, and 1 pkg. boneless/skinless chicken, cooked.  Seemed like more chicken than beans, which isn't all bad. Very good!

i love this chili and make it often for my family. The only thing i do differently is omit the chiles and as much cumin as it calls for.

Perfection as is. Has been a favorite of ours for years as the recipe has been printed on Bush's can of Great Northern Beans. Have made it for other families in time of need (illness or "new baby") and all have asked for the recipe. Low cost especially for a large family. To stretch it, have added one more can of beans.

I was certain I'd forgotten an ingredient in this, but I hadn't. It was SO bland! It was salvaged, however, with the addition of 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. oregano, some lime juice, salsa (mixed in), and cayenne. Also some cilantro. Then it was ok!

It's great if you double the cumin and add a little chili powder. I don't add the chilies though.

As written, 4 stars. However, after tasting while it was simmering, I added extra cumin, some garlic powder (would have used fresh at the beginning, but didn't have any), salt/pepper and some southwest seasoning from Pampered Chef...and the end result was DELICIOUS! 5 stars for the end result!

Good chili. I actually let this simmer on real low for 1 hour. I added a 2 cans of chicken broth and a can of pureed white beans and 3tbsp of cornstarch instead of flour thicken it up. I also added minced garlic and cilantro to the pot. Topped it off with sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Yummy.

It needs some heat... top with jalapenos if you're into heat.  Goes great over nacho chips (Tostitos Gold were really good with it).  I would probably give it 4.5 but it's not quite as good as one I had in a tavern nearby, hence the 4 star rating.  FIVE STARS for ease of cooking, though!

Excellent chili.  I follow some others' suggestions and add additional cumin/chili powder and serve with corn bread, sour cream, and monteray jack cheese.  For some added flavor, try a few dashes of Texas Pete hot sauce in your bowl....delish!

This was a good base for a chili, but the seasoning needed serious work.  I love cumin, but it was far too sweet in this dish.  I ended up adding: salt, rosemary, garlic powder, chili powder, and some curry to bring down the sweetness of the cumin.  After that, it was great!

I love white chicken chili and this was no exception.  Followed recipe except sauteed a clove of garlic with the onion and added a dash of garlic, onion and chili powder.  Used rotisserie chicken which made it even easier.  It turned out perfect for me and I'll definitely make again.

I love this recipe.  I have made it so many times.  Sometimes I add a can of carrots and/or frozen corn.  Serve with a good french roll and it is so yummy - and always a hit!  I also like to top with shredded cheese.

This is a HUGE hit at our annual SuperBowl party!!  And so easy to make.  We like it best with shredded chicken, as opposed to diced, and often grill the chicken first for extra flavor.

Downright excellent!  I doubled it and added a can of corn and used ~4 C of water with a chicken Ramen flavor packet as I didn't have chicken broth and I also left my chicken in chunks and had it over rice, and it was amazing!  Great recipe.

This recipe is wonderful!  It's very quick and easy to make and quite tastey! With the green chilies you can add or subract to suit your families taste for "heat".  My family likes the milder side ... :-( but the one small can is just right for them.  Serve it with cheese and sour cream .... Yummmmm

I have made this recipe twice now. After I made it the first time, my husband kept pestering me to make it again, It is fast, easy, cheap, and healthy. It's everything I could want in a recipe. It's also mild enough that my kids can eat it, as long as I drain and rinse the chilis. My husband and I usually add some more heat at the table. I tend to be more heavy handed with spices in general, so I may have upped the cumin a bit. I will be making this again and again.

A very good basic and quick fix.  I used left over pork loin instead of chicken.  I also enhanced with a bit of fresh garlic, fresh cilantro, and minced scallions.  Instead of flour, I used corn muffin mix which added a great masa flavor.  Some black beans and whole kernal corn would further enhance.  This is a great basic recipe to have fun with!  Thank you Bush's!

I found the basic recipe a bit bland, I added a total of 3 tsp. cumin, a pinch of fresh cilantro, and a splash of green tabasco.  My wife who does not enjoy spicy meals never mentioned the spices but it made for an enjoyable meal.

I omited the green chiles because I have small kids, but I followed the rest as directed. This is so tasty! I made it for a chili cook off at our church and everyone LOVED it! I should have tripled the recipe!

HIT THE SPOT! Don't add any salt. There is already enough from the broth.

This is the best! My family loves it. I use a store bought roasted chicken and Better than Bouillon instead of chicken broth. I also double the receipe but i use 6 cans of beans because it makes it more hearty! We top with cheese, cilantro,sour cream! Love It!

Good but not 5 stars; I thought it was too thick; didn't see the need for the flour. Although husband drained the beans, he did not rinse them, and this didn't help. Thought it wasn't spicey enough, although it was easy to put together and I would definitely make again. (maybe my ancient cumin didn't help). My favorite so far is the "White Bean Chicken Chili" on this site.

Yum! I made this exactly as directed & garnished with finely diced jalepeno peppers (jar) and sour cream. This was so good on a cold winter's night. I will make this again!

This is a good base recipe, but needs some extra help too. I added 1/2tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1 diced bell pepper and 1 can of Rotel. THEN it was yummmmy!!

Delicious and easy! I used frozen pre-cooked diced chicken breast - microwaved four minutes then chopped up a little more - to make it even simpler. My family loved this. Served it with corn muffins.

This was delicious... After reading all the reviews I decided to add 1 tablespoon of cumin and to blend one of the cans of white beans to make it thicker. The whole family loved it.

This is soooooo good! I make this soup every winter and my family loves it. What I like to do is to put the chicken breast in whole and cook it all in the crock pot all day with an extra can of chicken broth. After about 4 hours the chicken can be shredded. I just like the texture better. We crumble tortilla chips and Monterrey Jack cheese over the top, a few shots of Tabasco and a dollop of sour cream.....oh my! My picky kids even eat it. This is a must try!!!

The boys love this chili.  We spice it up by melting an entire block of jalapeno jack cheese into the chili before serving.  If I am serving to "milder" souls, then I add regular monterey jack cheese.  The cheese melts into the concoction quite easily and tastes wonderful.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was my first time making this. I added a bit of garlic to the recipe as well as a little bit of cayenne pepper for the heat, since I didn't have peppers. We froze the leftovers and can't wait until we can have them again!

Yummy and so easy.  I was scared to make this since my husband is not a big cummin fan, but after taking one bite he said, "This is awesome!"  Since then I have started to make it with a little less cummin and we are really enjoying it.  I just had some friends over and my neighbor loved it.  Surprisingly enough her 5 year old son ate it all up.  She said that never happens.  Yeah!

Very bland.  I couldn't find Bush's beans at the store in this variety so I had to get the unprepared ones.  It took a lot longer and really lacked flavor.  It just had an odd taste.

Both my husband and I loved this recipe.  It was very bland however and I had to add some seasonings to it.  Instead of the canned chilis I used a fresh jalepeno, 1 tbsp of cumin, and a few dashes of salt/pepper, seasoned salt, and chili powder.  I also used half of the beans it called for.  Very Very good, next time I'm going to make a double batch :)

This was really great.  I doubled the liquids to make more but kept the chilis the same.  I also used three cans of Great Northern Beans but pureed one to make the chili thicker.  I served it with a crisp salad and corn bread.  Everyone loved this and I will certainly be adding this to my permanent recipe box!

Made this for co-workers and they raved about it!  I loved it, too. Served it w/ corn muffins and fresh fruit salad...it was a hit! I also added some fresh cooked corn off the cob which added texture and sweetness.

This recipe is good but could use more kick. I think a can of Rotel would do the trick, I had to add cajun spices so because the pepper would be too hot for the kids. If you are only cooking for adults I would try adding a diced jalpeno. Will make this one again.

I am giving this only four stars, because, as written, the recipe is a little bland.  I made it the first time for my family following the recipe exactly, then when I served it I followed others advice and included tortilla crisps (just did them in the oven).  It was really bland until I remembered to grab the salsa, cheese, and sour cream.  Despite being a little bland I just made it again yesterday for some friends, but this time I used 1 Tbsp cumin, and a dash of chili powder and cayenne pepper.  I also added a clove of garlic to the onion as it cooked.  I didn't measure the amount of chicken, I just cooked 1lb of chicken breast.  This time we used store bought chips and remembered all the toppings, and with only four adults and an 18mo, my husband and I didn't even get seconds!  It was great.  My husband says to put it on the "regular" list.  Also, just a word of caution, there is no way my large pan could hold everything they say, so I started in the pan, but then later transferred the chili to a larger pot and then used the same pan to cook the chicken.  Happy cooking!

Excellent white chicken chili recipe. Have been making it for years, customizing it by subbing one can of garbanzos for one of the cans of great northerns, adding two minced garlic cloves, several dashes of commercial (green) tomatillo hot sauce, one bay leaf and two sliced celery stalks. I don't know anyone who doesn't love this chili and we live on the Texas-Mexico border.

This recipe was easy and quick. My family enjoyed it, and even our 3 year old devoured his bowl of chili. I added a bag of frozen spinach for a vegetable, a link of turkey sausage for flavor and left out the green chilis. This recipe has become a weekly addition to suppertime at our house.

This chili is SO EASY and so healthy and so yummy.  I just throw everything in the crock pot and let it cook all day, then take out the chicken breasts and shred them.  How easy is that?  My whole family likes it!
