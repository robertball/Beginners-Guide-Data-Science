This is really good! I made it the night before thinking it would be a good morning caffeine drink, but it didn't last that long--the pitcher was completely empty by the next morning! The empty pitcher was, however, still in the fridge...MEN!!!!

This makes a wonderful alternative to the alcoholic version.  My kids can't get enough of it!

This was an excellent recipe. I am a sangria connoseur and I can't believe there is no alcohol in this! I just made it to a lunch party and it was a hit. I mixed all the ingredient except the soda and left it in the fridge overnight and the flavors mixed beautifully. The hardest part of making this is putting the puree through the strainer, but it is worth it. I also squeezed some of the citrus a bit into the mix but next time I will not, as it takes some of the attention away from the rest of the flavors. Thanks to allrecipes.com for giving me another favorite!

I really enjoyed this because it was the right blend of sweet, but not too sweet.  I used 12 ounces of rasberries.

This is such a good recipe! I've made it as it states and with subs like apple juice, ginger ale, and peach tea, and frozen strawberries and it still came out delicious. Thanks for such a good one.

Amazing hit at our party.  I recommend doubling (or even tripling) the recipe as this will be gone in an instant!

Made this, upon request, for a Jamaican themed 14 year old boy's birthday party. It was loved by the adults and my son, but the teenagers wouldn't even try it. After it sat for a day, it was thick. We added lemon-lime soda to each glass as we drank it. A glass of this is like having a meal. It will fill you up. The next day, me and the hubby added some gin and had cocktails.

I made it as the recipe called out, and the kids enjoyed being able to drink it, but I had white wine on the side for the adults.

Yummy!
So I blended a mix of strawberries and raspberies in my magic bullet, didnt get it fully puree but it was good enough.  I used one lipton tea bag for the tea.  I made the recipe with the sub of OJ & 7UP, i'd like to try it with orange soda next time but still was good.  Thanks for the recipe!
