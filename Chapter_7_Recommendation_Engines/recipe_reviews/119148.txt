I made this recipe recently for a large group and it was well received.  I did add more almond extract to the batter and additional almonds on top.  My kids also loved them.  Good recipe, thanks

This was a very good cookie to make, and it tastes very good, too! I prefer mine a little sweeter (hence the four stars), but they taste great! They were a great addition to the cookie gifts I gave for Christmas. I did double the almond extract, and I'm glad I did- the almond taste was great!

This cookie tastes best if made a day in advance. Gives the flavors time to develop. DEFINITELY use twice the amount of almond extract! If I'm making an almond cookie, I want to taste the almond flavor! Also, roll out the cookie into bigger balls.

This is a good, light cookie to have.  I really wanted something with almond in it and this did the trick.  After reading other reviews, I did double the amount of almond extract in them, and they came out beautifully.  This is definitely one I'll be using again.

This recipe was very quick and easy. In 5 minutes they were in the oven and tasted just like from our favorite chinese restaurant. I did add a few sliced almonds to the recipe because I love nuts. Thanks for sharing!

I don't know what ever possessed to try this recipe. Yes its a easier version of an almond cookie but you loose a lot when you edit for ease and it lacks in flavor an consistency. I upped the almond extract to 1 tbs and added chopped almonds. they were puffy and not at all like the real thing. I think I'll opt for the recipe that requires chilling overnight or just used the cookie part from the raspberry almond shortbreads.

These were very good. They're about the consistency of pie crust, so I couldn't roll them into a ball without the whole thing crumbling apart. Instead, I rolled it out so that it was very thin and cut it into circles with a cookie cutter. They were a lot prettier that way.

These were really good. They had a wonderful flavor and texture and looked beautiful. Next time I will probably double the amount of almond extract and maybe add some ground almonds to the dough. Yummy, Jane! Thanks!

I loved this recipe! After my first (and failed) batch, I had a friend come over and help me. This time, I decided not to listen to the other reviewers and add only one teaspoon of almond extract, like the recipe said. When it came out, my two kids tasted it again and they could not stop eating, even if we were supposed to save it for my kids' Christmas party!

I doubled the almond extract as suggested. I thought the cookies were good, but not excellent.  They are very crisp, even when you remove them from the oven early.

My family really liked these- they were easy to make too.  I liked eating the dough as much as the finished product!  :)  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I doubled the vanilla extract and I brushed on the egg whites before sprinkling the almonds on top, 'cause they would just fall off when I tried it the other way.  Thanks for sharing this!

I think these cookies are good - do they taste like I remember the restauarants serving in the 40s and 50s - not sure but I do know that they did need more almond.  I added the 1 tsp. amount and would increase it to 2 tsp. I did add 1 tsp. of vanilla -and probably would do that again along with the 2 tsp. of almond flavoring.  Also not very sweet which for me is OK.  Instead of sliced almonds I put one salted whole almond from a can I had - and it looked more like I remember the cookies looking as a kid.  I also put the egg white on before the almond as suggested by another reviewer and then did it again after I put on the almond piece.  Would recommend this recipe.

I made these and the only thing I did different was I added blanched, diced almonds to the batter and then baked them.  Everyone loved them and there wasn't a crumb left.  Can't wait to make them again.

Be careful not to put too much egg wash on, otherwise you can taste the egg, and I'm pretty sure cookies aren't supposed to taste like egg. LOL. Still- 5 stars!

These were delicious!  I was assigned to make 130 cookies for a community dinner, and I chose these.  I made a small batch first and decided to double the almond extract in the next ones.  I also used slivered almonds on top.  When they were done they were buttery, crisp and very good!

This is an excellent and easy cookie.  I followed the recipe exactly.  There is definitely a light almond flavor if you use 1tsp of flavoring, similar to the cookies that you would find in your Chinese restaurants, but for those of you that are wanting a really strong almond flavored cookie, then you may want to increase it to 2tsp like other reviewers did.  I really like the fact that the saltiness very gently stood out, giving it that salty/sweet flavor.  My husband loved them and mentioned that they tasted "just as I would expect them to taste". He said they would be good in the morning with coffee too.  My only recommendation would be to go very lightly on the egg white rub.  I got a little carried away, and made it a little too thick on a few cookies, which caused a blotchy, brown appearance.  Just give it a very light, equal coating and it will give a nice shiny appearance on top.  Great cookie!!!
