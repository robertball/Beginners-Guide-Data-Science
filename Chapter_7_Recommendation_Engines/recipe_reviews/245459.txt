This is a delicious bruschetta found in an Allrecipes search for an appetizer with pimiento cheese- go figure! No wonder nobody has ever reviewed it in five years! The sweet squash tangy slaw and blue cheese crumbles create a nice balance of flavors. My grocery didn t have radicchio so I used purple cabbage. Radicchio would have been nice but the cabbage worked fine too. I bought a decent balsamic reduction which was a nice shortcut. Also don t be timid with the seasoning of the squash!
