With the exception of adding 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon just as a taste preference, I guess I'm one of the few who made this recipe as written--no substitutions, no modifications. (Cornstarch in a muffin batter?) Even after mixing them up, baking them and, finally, eating them, I can confidently tell you these are a perfect strawberry oatmeal muffin, and the recipe needs no tinkering or tweaking to make them so. Tender crumb, just the right amount of sweetness for a muffin, beautiful light brown color,  and bursting with plump little chunks of red strawberries. These are perfectly rounded, moist and delicious with a pleasant and delicate pairing of the oatmeal and strawberry flavors. Thanks for sharing the recipe for these Wendy!

These muffins are fabulously moist and delicious!  I decided to make these muffins because of the rolled oats.  My 5yo son has borderline high cholesterol and oatmeal can help reduce it naturally and he will not eat just oatmeal.  Firstly, I doubled the recipe because I have 5 children and 12 muffins wouldn't have lasted for more than 5 minutes in our house.  I took some suggestions from the other reviewers and changed the recipe in the following ways:
I substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 the amount of regular flour; I used one mashed banana for 1/2 of the amount of oil; I added cinnamon along with the soda, powder and salt.  If I had egg substitute on hand, I would have used that instead of regular eggs.  I also used fresh cut strawberries.
These muffins are delicious and so much more healthy than the standard fare...great source of fiber!  Thanks for submitting such a different recipe for strawberries!

Yumm! As others suggested I made a few changes: juice of 1/2 a lemon and 2%; cut the oil in half and used a 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce (great flavor!), zest of my 1/2 lemon, 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg, a generously rounded tsp. cornstarch, and about 2 Tbsp of flax seeds for a healthy kick. I used a bunt pan instead of muffin tins and it was ready in about 17 minutes. I want to try it with whole wheat flour. But it was gorgeous when it came out of the oven, a good gooey center, not too mushy but I might add a little more cornstarch next time to combat my juicy berries.  I will defiantly make this again, perhaps with cranberries and orange zest!


Okay I just had to come back to change my rating, I did the recipe again same as above except this time with a Tbs of corn starch, FANTASTIC!!

I made this recipe with my oldest son. We used lactose-free milk that we "soured" with lemon juice. I taught him to mix the buttermilk with the oats and let it "sit" for 15-20 minutes before adding the rest of the wet ingredients. We did substitute one mashed banana for the oil and we cut the sugar back to a half cup. We made no other changes. I did make a judgement call and asked him to let the batter sit just a little longer, maybe ten minutes because it was quite wet even though the oats had soaked up a lot of the buttermilk previously. My son and I kept leaning over the bowl to smell the batter because it smelled wonderful. We baked the muffins at 350* for 20 minutes. They turned out very nicely--chewy, dense muffins with the perfect amount of strawberries. I'm really glad we substituted the banana in place of the oil, it was a nice combination with the strawberries. NOTE: For all those wanting to make this recipe, watch your batter. You might have to let it sit a while to get the oats to soak up some of the liquid, too.

This was definitely a keeper - but I DID make some changes:  As suggested by others, I added some corn starch. I then doubled the baking soda.  I used a white/whole wheat blend (altho next time I may go all whole wheat.  I used vanilla soy milk with a tbls. of cider vinegar instead of buttermilk, which I seldom have on hand.  Because of that, I did not add vanilla.  I did, however, add a lot (how much?) cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also added coarsely chopped pecans and tried go-go berries instead of raisins or craisins.  Finally, I added an equal amt of maple syrup instead of sugar.  These came out a tad too sweet for me, but hubby loved them.  I used just-bought fresh strawberries and they were not at all mushy.  The consistency was perfect, the tops were rounded.  Next time I will use whole grain flour, apple sauce or bananas instead of oil, and I will mix/match nuts & dried fruit.  But definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

I made these muffins this morning and they turned out moist.  I was a little afraid because I don't usually like strawberries baked in things because of their tendency to get mushy.  I chopped the strawberries small to avoid big, mushy pieces.  The muffins had a good flavor, kind of like strawberry jam baked into the muffin.  I have had better muffins (ones with more butter/sour cream) but these are very good considering they are a little lower in fat. Because they were so moist, I might try reducing the oil a little next time.  I doubt I would miss it.  I also made it all in one bowl.  I started with the oatmeal/buttermilk, let it sit a few minutes, added the wet ingredients on top, blended well, and then added the dry ingredients on top of that.  I stirred just until moist and then folded in the strawberries.  They were fine!

These were tasty - I definitely recommend them!  I did make a bunch of recipe modifications based on previous reviews and my daughter's egg allergy, which is why I gave the original recipe four stars instead of five.  I used 2% milk soured with vinegar instead of buttermilk, substituted 1/3 cup whole wheat flour for the white flour, replaced the egg with a mix of 1 Tbsp flax meal and 3 Tbsp hot water, plus added 1 Tbsp cornstarch, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a handful of raisins.  I baked them for 17 minutes.  These were light yet moist and fluffy in the middle - not gummy at all - and the strawberries were tasty!  These are definitely going into my regular rotation.  Thanks for giving me a good recipe to work with!

Had a hard time cooking these all the way through and still after 25 minutes the strawberries were making the inside soft.  I guess the cornstarch others recommended would eliminate this.  I will try it again.

This muffin was pretty good! It wasn't the best but almost. I really didn't do anything different. I only added a few more strawberry's and some nutmeg. Also, I added a tbs. of cornstarch to help them rise better. I cut the recipe in half and they worked great!

VERY good. I'm making all things "healthier" these days, but even with changes, these muffins are light and fluffy, which is not what I expected. I used half whole wheat flour & half white, replaced half the Canola oil with applesauce, used only half cup brown sugar (we don't like things too sweet), and I DID add 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Also added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts -- healthy oils!

I used strawberries that were a little dried up after sitting open in the frig a few days - no mushiness!  Also used all whole wheat flour.  Will make again.

Smelled wonderful as they were baking, and tasted just as good!  I substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour, cut the oil in half with applesauce, low-fat buttermilk, no-calorie Sugar Twin brown sugar substitute, and fresh frozen raspberries instead of strawberries.  No sugar, low fat and high fiber! Turned out great!

Wonderful Muffins!
I am a flax meal fan, so I added 1/4 cup along with a bit of wheat germ.  This is a very hearty and healthy muffin!
My family and co-workers loved them.
Thanks Wendy!

4 stars as is, make it a 5 star by adding a teaspoon of cinnamon. Others reviewers complained about a lack of flavor but with the cinnamon they were delicious. I used white whole wheat flour and half applesauce/half oil and chopped the berries fairly small. Great breakfast treat, thanks!

This is my new favorite muffin recipe! I used organic wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, apple sauce in place of vegetable oil, and skim milk instead of buttermilk. I added blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries along with the strawberries in different batches...they all came out great!

I followed the recipe with a few exceptions: 1) I substituted 1/2 of the oil with applesauce, 2) I didn't have buttermilk so I used whole milk, and 3) I added a little cornstarch as recommended by another user.  The muffins turned out fine, not as mushy as I expected after reading other reviews.  The taste was OK, I will probably try a different recipe next time.

I thought this recipe was WONDERFUL!!  My 3-year-old son decided that he wanted to bring strawberry muffins for snack to school & I had never heard of such a thing.  I found this recipe and followed it exactly (THE BUTTERMILK MAKES IT SOOO YUMMY), except that I used extra strawberries and I added a Tblsp of cornstarch & pecans.  They were flavorful, not gummy.  The kids and the teachers LOVED them!! Thank you, Wendy!

The strawberries made them a little mushy, but I didn't mind.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular milk with some lemon juice in it.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and used whole wheat pastry flour.  They turned out just fine.

These are delicious and pretty healthy too.  I followed the recipe almost to a T--just added more strawberries, some cinnamon, and used a buttermilk substitute (lemon and milk).  Next time I will try adding the corn starch as the strawberries do get kind of gooey.  But even so, these are some of the best muffins I've had.  Really great even my girls liked them!

After trying multiple muffin recipes this season, I am so glad I stumbled on this one! It is moist but in a climate like ours where it is VERY dry, that is a good thing.  I changed very little but did double the Baking powder (a trick I learned from my Newfie friends) so they rise better. I also added Raspberries as I didn't have a full cup of strawberries,  Wonderful! Next will be to try it with whole grain flour instead of white and apple sauce instead of oil. Oh yeah...and blueberries!  What a great base recipe!

Really good. I used a mix of frozen strawberries and blueberries. My husband is a diabetic so I replaced the white flour with Whole Wheat Pastry. For the sugar I used 1/4 cup packed brown sugar & 2/4 c. Splenda. I sprinkled in some of my homemade Pumpkin Pie Spice and 1/2 cup walnuts. It only made 10 muffins so I must have made mine bigger. Good snack for hubbie though, thanks!

I don't make muffins very well, I usually overmix the batter.  3 things happened with this recipe - I intended on doing it by the recipe.  1 I oversoaked the oats, I think it just made them softer and they rather disintagrated when I mixed them in. 2) didn't have buttermilk so I did the vinegar in milk - does that change the flavor? 3) I didn't have brown sugar so instead I used the same amount of white sugar as called for.  It turned out to be a lovely muffin and I could have eaten the whole batch by myself.  It's sweet enough but not overly sweet..  I'm sending this recipe to my friends via facebook..

Wonderful recipe! I added a 1/4C applesauce for half the oil, used egg whites only and whole wheat flour and finally added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cinnamon. In one batch I added a bit more than a cup of freshly cut strawberries and in the other blueberries. Both came out wonderfully flavorful. These are yummy and super healthy and pass wonderfully for comfort food so my family loves them!  If you are looking for something healthy AND tasty then this is it but if you want a more pastry-like fluffy muffin to indulge your sweet tooth, then you might not like these. A useful hint is not to use the really juicy strawberries because they will turn to mush and make the muffins too wet.

DELICIOUS. Hopped online to find a good way to use my farmer's market strawberries for breakfast. Glad I looked no further! I can't help but fiddle... so I subbed half whole wheat flour, used Lactaid instead of buttermilk, sprinkled in some cinnamon + nutmeg and added chopped walnuts. Baked 20 mins= turned out scrumptious. Think I'll go grab one now...

Yum! This turned out great. I doubled the batch and baked it in two large loaf pans, which took considerably more time to bake but was well worth standing in front of the oven for. I used half wheat flour and half white flour, and I'm enjoying the fruits of that labor right now with a huge cup of coffee! Thank you!

Fabulous moist and tasty.  I ground my own wheat berries for the flour, thus was using whole wheat not all purpose flour and used 1 cup raisins instead of strawberries.  Also left the oats soaking 15 min. in the buttermilk the second time around.  (First time I tried the recipe it seemed too runny that is why I tried soaking the oats longer, it worked.) Definitely flour the muffin tins.

This is a great, easy recipe. I didn't feel guilty eating these because they are not high in fat or sugar. I didn't have buttermilk so substituted regular milk with vinegar added. My co-workers loved them too!

I made this with my mom. We used lactose free milk and soured it with lemon juice. We used one mashed banana instead of the oil and cut the sugar back to a half cup. The batter smelled like a patch of vanilla strawberries. I had fun making this with my mom. They turned out AWESOME!!!!!!!!

These are good.  I was looking for a nice way to use up some strawberries for breakfast and didn't want to make smoothies again!  Make sure to chop your berries up small, so they won't get mushy.  I added a tsp of almond extract, and mashed a banana to substitute half of the oil.  I think if I just add a streusel to these they would be a winner for sure.

I was afraid these would be dense due to the oats, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Added chopped walnuts and mini semi sweet choco chips.

Great, easy recipe.  I doubled the recipe, might as well as I had the buttermilk. I made one half with chocolate chips and the other with the strawberries.  I also added the cinnamon and used corn oil.  Great turn out.

These were a little bland for our taste. The texture was good, I used white whole wheat flour and substituted ground flax for half the oil. I don't care for things too sweet and try to reduce sugar in most recipes but I don't think I could do that with this one. Next time I'll add some citrus zest or cinnamon.

These were just ok for me.  I have been looking for a perfect strawberry muffin for my hubby, and haven't found it yet.  I used quick cook oats and they still had a pretty good texture.  I also added 1 T of cornstarch to combat the juices of the strawberries.

My family LOVED these muffins. And they are so healthy in comparison to normal muffins that are filled with sugar. I also took some of the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of AP Flour + 1/2 cup of Whole Wheat Flour. Everything else I left the same. So good. These are definitely going to become a staple in our house. A fabulous way to use up strawberries.

Having followed the recipe just as written, I would give these 3.5 stars. They would not brown up on the top crust as nicely as I would have liked and were a little 'too' moist and delicate. They might actually benefit from the addtition of some whole wheat flour for part of the white. The flavor was fair, being just a little flat, despite the large amount of salt called for. Though lacking somewhat in flavor overall, they were indeed too salty. In short, if I made these again, I would include those changes.

These were good. Very tender and moist. The only changes I made was using low-fat buttermilk because it's all I had, using dried strawberries and adding frozen blueberries. They were prepared really quickly which I like, they were ready to bake in the time it took for my over to pre-heat.

I made the recipe exactly as stated.  I didn't like these.  The strawberries became moosh and rather unflavourful (my first time baking with strawberries and possibly my last)  and the muffin was too soft-- like perhaps it needed more flour to firm it up.

My 8 yr. old really liked these muffins. But for me they were not sweet enough. They didn't rise and give a nice high dome top that I like in muffins either. It didn't get mushy from the berries, just  moist. Thx for the recipe.

These were excellent.  I might try them next time with peaches.  I also might substitute yogurt for the buttermilk.  This is an excellent recipe.

Just had to update my review.  This has become one of my FAVORITE muffin recipes of all time.  I make them with whole wheat flour, finely chopped walnuts and blueberries usually, but often stick with strawberries, too.  I make them for company, too, and they're always a hit.  Such a great, nutritious recipe!  Thanks for sharing.
---------------------------------------------
I really enjoyed this recipe.  The flavor was excellent, and I think this batter could be a great base for things besides strawberries--like cranberries or blueberries...You could really get creative.  DH came home from surfing and ate 5 of these in one sitting!  LOL.  I will definitely be making these again!

I really enjoyed these muffins, very moist. I made a few changes... I added a tablespoon of corn starch, put a tsp. of baking soda, used applesauce instead of oil and used whole wheat flour instead of white. (Also added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg) So, so good. Only thing, the dough around the strawberries turned sort of dark purple. Maybe because of the corn starch? Dispite the odd color, it was wonderful. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing!

I was searching for an oatmeal and buttermilk muffin recipe.  I didn't have
any strawberries on hand, but I did have
soft-dried apricots and blueberries, 
dried sweet ginger, dried pineapple core
slices and walnuts ( I chopped all of that up ).. and to all this I added
a bit of strawberry extract, cinnamon and a conservative handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips.    This is a GREAT base recipe for muffins and I cannot wait to
make it with fresh strawberries.  As someonelse said.. not too sweet .. just right.  TY for posting!  I'll be using this recipe over and over and over again.

Wonderful!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp of corn starch and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I was all out of vegetable oil, so I used olive oil - I didn't notice any taste difference. :) Otherwise, no changes.  They came out light, fluffy, and with nicely rounded tops.  This is definitely a keeper!

I really liked this moist muffin. I didn't have oats so instead I used up some of the sugar free, cinnamon apple instant oatmeal packets I had. 3 packets = 1 cup. I think it hadded some flavor to the muffin. I also used half a bag of frozen mixed berries which turned out fine. I will make this again!

These muffins reminded me of a girlfriend I once had in college: flat.  They were worth trying, but I didn't fall in love with them.  The same was true for my ex-girlfriend.  I give the muffins and her three stars out of five.

I tried, but I was not one of the lucky ones and even followed the directions carefully.  They didn't have rounded tops at all but flat and were very gooey, even after I increased the cooking time several more minutes after checking.  The taste didn't impress me either.  I did do a small test group to which I added cornstarch and they did have more rounded tops, so maybe cornstarch is the secret for that.  However, overall I was disapointed and don't think I will make again.

These are excellent, just the way the recipe says. Of course strawberries go a little mushy when cooked, but I think they're supposed to. Just make sure you cut them up in small pieces and they turn out just great!

These were ok. I used strawberry flavored applesauce instead of the oil, and used half wheat flour, half white flour.  The strawberries were mushy when cooked and the kids didn't care for them.

I thought that the base recipe was great, but I'll try another fruit such as blueberries next time - the strawberries didn't have enough flavor.  I also added a few chopped pecans to the mix and that worked well.  I will definitely be making again!

Wonderful muffins! I didn't have buttermilk, so I added about a teaspoon of vinegar to my skim milk. Also, as suggested by someone else, I cut the oil in half and added a mashed banana. These turned out moist and delicious and were even better the next day. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These were very good and healthy too.  I even substituted 1/2 cup WW flour for the all purpose flour to up the fiber level a bit.  The strawberries kept the muffins very moist.

Delicious! Really good muffins. I cut the salt in half because my doctor advised me to do so for every recipe (high BP) and there was plenty of sodium in my buttermilk. It took a total of 25 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean, but I didn't have the problem that other reviewers decided to rectify with corn starch. Lovely flavour, and they got rave reviews in my house.

This is a great muffin! I make them gluten-free and change up the fruit - adding blackberries and nectarines/peaches to the strawberries - and tend to add extra (1/2 - 1 cup) to make them more filling and yummy.  Very good recipe! I've been doubling them to make 16-18 jumbo sized muffins.

easy, simple delicious recipe.   The only change I did was to add a very small amount of cinnamon and blueberries instead of strawberries.   My kids liked it a lot.  Very moist muffins and a total surprise how good they were...

I was a little over zealous with strawberry picking this year,  so I needed to find recipes to use them in. This was a really good muffin. I did not change a thing, and it is light, sweet, and just the right amount of strawberry. I did chop the strawberries up small. This is a sweet muffin;  a nice change from my normal banana muffins. I think next time I will try and make it healthier by replacing the oil with banana or applesauce and using whole wheat flour. But it is really, really good the way it is. Thanks!

They are not sweet at all like I think of when I want to eat a muffin. It reminds me of corn bread when I initially bite into them. I believe it would be better with half the salt. Not bad, but just not what I was expecting.

these are really good. They had a nice strawberry flavor.  I did use quick oats since that is all i had and i added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon (that another reviewer had done) because it sounded good. Just be sure to let them cool or around the strawberries will be mushy. They're not bad mushy either if you don't want to wait lol.

Very good.  I used frozen strawberries, with very good results.  Also instead of buttermilk I used powdered milk and water, in a ratio richer than the standard ratio.  So about 3/4 C dry milk to 1 cup water instead of 1/3 C dry milk to 1 cup water.  This added just a little richness without fat (non-fat dry milk).  Great recipe - thank you!

this is a sweet and very moist muffin!  I added about a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for taste.  next time I might bake them a few mins longer (I hate a dry muffin, so I always take them out a little early, especially the first time I'm trying a recipe).  I think I might add maybe 1/4 - 1/2 cup more oats.  I'll be making these again!

I thought these were good, but next time I will stick to the recipe as is without tweaking as others have suggested.  This time around I used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour and the wheat taste was just too overpowering.  They tasted "healthy."  The muffins were VERY moist and fluffy, so next time I will just stick to the original recipe.  Thanks swizzlesticks!

These are the best muffins I have ever made. I didn't have fresh strawberries, so I used a half-cup of frozen berries (all I had left in the freezer), plus a half cup of frozen cranberries, and added 1 tbsp. of flour. Also topped them with a streusel mixture of equal parts of flour, butter, and oatmeal plus 1 tbsp. sugar, blended in my food processor. Then baked them in a jumbo muffin pan; I have six of the biggest and most beautiful muffins, so tender and delicious, that I have ever made.

These are really good. The only change I made to the recipe was to add an extra 1/2 cup of strawberries. They baked perfectly in my oven at 19 minutes, and turned out moist and wonderful. They browned beautifully, and came out of the pan quite well - I let them sit for five minutes after baking. They have a wonderful strawberry oatmeal flavor and I will definitely be keeping this recipe around to use again!

These were okay but they just didn't turn out how I had expected. They were very moist, almost too moist and very tender too. The word mushy comes to mind with the texture but I think that's the oatmeal in it. (Or maybe just my aversion to oatmeal) My teen ate several of these and only asked what was in them as the buttermilk gives them an odd flavor. At least we didn't care for it. I had fun trying out a new recipe nad eating a new food. These will make a nice quick grab and go breakfast for our son on his way to school.

Amazing muffins....I made one batch following the recipe exactly (which I never do) and they were amazing. I also made a batch substituting 2/3 cup mushed very ripe bananas for the strawberries and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg...they were the best. I loved the flavor.

These muffins are fabulous! I used frozen strawberries and added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the flour mixture (thanks naples34102). Remember if you don't have buttermilk you can use 1 cup yogurt OR 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar plus enough milk to make 1 cup.

These are great muffins - moist, not too sweet.  I added chopped pecans.  And easy!

Good recipe.  Eat right away - they kind of get soggy if put in a zip loc.

these are very tasty.  My kids love them. I put raspberries instead of strawberries with 1/4 cup chocolate chips. I've also made them with 3/4 cup raisens and 1/4 cup choc. chips.  And with 3/4 cup cranraisens and 1/4 cup choc. chips. Think the ones with raspberries and cranraisens would also taste great with white choc. chips.

I MAID THESE LAST NIGHT AND THEY ARE GREAT, I DON'T USUALLY EAT SWEETS BUT THESE HAVE JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SWEETNESS. I DIDN'T HAVE BUTTERMILK SO I MIXED SKIM MILK WITH 2 TABLESPOONS OF VINIGAR. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND MADE LARGER MUFFINS AND BAKED FOR 50 MIN. WILL MAKE AGAIN!!

These didn't rise very well, and had sort of a gummy texture.  My husband and older daughter liked them well enough, but I didn't care for them at all.  I don't know if the proportions were jazzed up somehow, but the muffins just didn't seem to bake up properly.

These muffins tasted just okay.  I followed the suggestion to use a mashed banana in place of half of the oil.  I also soured 2% milk rather than used buttermilk and decreased the salt by half.  The batter was soupy and did not result in nice rounded muffins.  I have not found a strawberry muffin recipe that I love; they tend to be bland, which is disappointing because fresh strawberries are so sweet and delicious.

These are very good and I’m not usually a fan of strawberry muffins. I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. I also added some lemon and cornstarch, as suggested by other reviewers. They’re very moist and tasty!

Made the receipt exactly as directed. No subs and no adds. My family and I really enjoyed them, especially my small kids that prefer less strong flavors. However, they could use some extra flavor like cinnamon, cardamom or lemon zest (for my taste) but I’m rating this recipe and not one I made up myself lol

I made an account just to show this recipe some love. This came out awesome without straying from the original recipe. Here are some tips:
1) you can use a blender or whatever machine to whisk the sugar,  egg, extract and oil if you want, that's fine, BUT it says to *stir* in flour mixture just until moistened. This is important so you dont  overwork the flour. Also gently folding in the strawberries is important. 

2) I used thick cut rolled oats. It says to let the oats soak into the buttermilk for 5 or 10 minutes (dont remember which one, im writing this the next morning) but tbh i just let the oats soak until i needed them.  When i got to that point, the oat/ buttermilk mixture was quite thick and it worked out rly well. I reccomend letting thick oats sit with the buttermilk til thick.

3) the 15 minutes for a cooking time is a joke lol. Both my batches were 23 and 20 minutes [20 mins ones werent filled quite as much as the first batch]


Anyway i hope these tips help out the next person. These are pretty good :)

Very good. Yes, I modified it a bit, but I doubt it altered the original recipe much. We have a Type 1 diabetic in the family, so I try to alter recipes to make them healthier. I used old fashioned oats (not quick cooking), 1/2 cup coconut sugar instead of brown sugar (on a whim, my brown sugar was dried out), subbed 1/2 of the AP flour with whole wheat flour, and used 1/2 t salt. Added 1/2 t cinnamon. Chopped the strawberries into small pieces. I counted the carbs = 22grams of carbs in 12 muffins. I got 12 muffins out of this recipe. Also made in paper liners and the muffins did not stick too bad.

These muffins taste amazing...my husband never likes my muffins but he can't stop eating these :-)   I did not have buttermilk so I used 2% milk with a little lemon juice and vinegar.  I also added about 5 extra frozen cut up strawberries in addition to the one up of fresh.  This may have made it a little too moist because they didn't raise too much...so next time I may add a little more flour.  However, still very good!

Best ever! Was thinking I was going to make some changes to recipe  based on readers comments but glad I didn’t! This recipe beats all my previous muffin recipes hands down! They are super moist and the strawberries did not sink to the bottom. This is now my go to muffin recipe. Thank you!

The only thing I changed was I substituted almond extract for vanilla extract. Still good!

These were good, but they weren't too sweet. Maybe it because I didn't pack the brown sugar or had frozen strawberries instead of fresh? I did have to add a bit more flour and oats to soak up the extra juices....I'm going to try it again with some tips from others who have tried..

OMG...delishious!  Do as others did - add some cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of corn starch (for the strawberry juice).  Cut strawberries up small.  Outstanding.  I also did 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white.  This will be a monthly repeat, esp during strawberry season, but don't make more than 1 batch.  They don't keep well.  The strawberries leak juices and make them soggy and mushy after a day or so.

These are truly delicious and--dare I say--foolproof? :)
I moved into my boyfriend's apartment, and my baking resources here are ... umm ... limited, to say the least. Add his lack of measuring cups and a fussy oven to the mix and, wow, I was really taking a gamble! HOWEVER, I wanted strawberry oat muffins badly enough to try my hand at them using substitutions and eyeballing a few things. I'm not going to lie--the odds seemed stacked against them, but, lo and behold, they honestly turned out terrific. Give them a try; if they turn out anything like my "experimental" version, you'll love them! :) 

1 c. buttermilk = 1 T squeezed lemon juice + milk to make 1 c. 
(also added the liquid that was in a open container of sour cream).
1 t. baking powder = 1/2 t baking soda + 1/2 t cream of tartar. 
1 c. fresh strawberries = 1 cup frozen strawberries, scant
(added a little extra flour because they were quite liquid-y).

1 c measuring cup = glass tumbler.

I baked on the bottom rack because the oven's "bake" setting can't keep a steady temp. I had to switch to "broil" every so often to bring the temp back up to the 375F range, then switch it back to the bake setting. Phew!

So good!! The only thing I may do different is maybe cut the strawberries smaller next time, and maybe add some cinnamon, but I made them as is, with the exception of doing the milk & vinegar for buttermilk because I didn't have any. No modifications needed!!

These were good, but not a repeat. 
They turned out really doughy.
All 3 of my kids said they were alright, but didn't have much flavor.
If you are going to make them, I highly recommend adding cinnamon and/or nutmeg.

Not very sweet, even though we added a little honey.  Did add just a little powdered sugar and flour to the strawberries before stirring them in to absorb some of the juices.  The berries are moist in the muffing, but not what we could call soggy.  We really liked these muffins.

thanks for recipe and the valued reviewed, i don't like muffins that much, every time i try one it turns not as expected, this time i was encouraged doing it after going through most reviews, so i followed most of the recommendations: adding 1/4 cup honey, 1 tb cornstarch, 1/2 amount whole wheat, raisins, walnut, blueberry, cinnamon, and nutmeg .. but the salt was too much i reduced it to 1/2 ts still tasted salty, i liked the texture and fluffiness .. thanks alot .. have posted in my instagram for all family to follow :)

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and they turned out great with 20 minutes in the oven.  I used blueberries in place of strawberries because I needed to use them up.  I just dumped a cup of frozen blueberries in and they baked up really well.  I'll make this again, especially when I'm trying to use up buttermilk.  I will freeze a couple and see how they thaw.

These were okay but not great.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and made sure to measure exactly one cup of chopped strawberries.  They didn't rise at all and yes my baking powder and soda were fresh.  They were lacking flavor and the texture was heavy.  I'm sorry this one just didn't work for me.

The first time I tried this recipe, I followed it almost exactly, with the exception of using 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour, and frozen strawberries.  The batter was very soupy, and the muffins were caved in at the top, and very moist.  I would probably have abandoned it had it not tasted so good -- I really wanted to make it work, because the strawberry/oat/brown sugar combination is great.  to the recipe as shown, I *added* the following:  1c wheat flour, 1/4t baking powder, 1 egg, 1/4c brown sugar, and 1/2t vanilla.  I set my oven to 350F and let the oats soak for 10 min.  This time, the muffins are muffin-shaped and still have that great texture with plenty of moisture.  Batter was also easier to work with.  I tried it with blackberries this time around, but I wouldn't recommend it; definitely going back to strawberries.

I made these last week-end and they turned out quite well, I did make a substitution using splenda instead of the regular sugar. Since I made a larger batch (had more strawberries that needed to be used up) I didn't have enough muffin tins for all so made 12 muffins and 2 loafs I liked the muffins better than the bread, the bread did not slice well and was to moist in the middle, still yummy tho!

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I made it exactly as stated, and it came out fine.  Next time I will probably try substituting 1/2 whole wheat flour and using some sugar substitute.  I think some cinnamon would be a good addition as well. The recipe made 30 mini muffins, which I baked for about 13 minutes.  You could use this recipe with pretty much whatever fruit or nuts you have on hand or prefer, and it will come out great!

I'm going to say i was disappointed. Strawberry muffins just never turn out good! the muffins became too moist and mushy by the end of the day. Mine also turned out gummy like some reviewers said.. but i dont think that is the fault of the recipe. i wanted to be healthier so i substituted yogurt for the oil. the yogurt is what makes for a gummy treat. If there is such a thing as strawberry extract i would use them in these because it lacks the flavor or fresh strawberries. sorry but this was no good!

Very yummy, I used half whole wheat flour and replaced the brown sugar with sucanut/rapadura (healthy brown sugar).  They were moist, delicious and I could have eaten all of them.  They didnt rise all that much but I wouldnt say they were flat, just fill up your muffin tin almost to the top.

Very tasty.  Whole family loved them.  Like others suggested,used wheat flour, added cornstarsh, used 1/4 unsweeted natural applesauce with a bit of cinnamon, and added two handfuls of organic chocolate chips.  Great alternative for preschoolers birthday cupcakes.  Thanks for the beginning of a very yummy muffin recipe.

These seemed kind of soggy after the first day.  They didn't have a ton of flavor, but they were good.  It was nice to make a different kind of muffin.

These are great muffins.  Hearty, but not heavy.  I added some wheat germ into the mix, and used half wheat flour.

I made the recipe exactly as written and we really enjoyed the result. Sure, a little soft, but we don't mind that at all. I'm afraid, though, the moistness might not work with freezing these, so I am going to add 1 T of cornstarch next time. I'll also try the recipe with blueberries when those are in season, and I'll used whole wheat flour, 1/2 the amount the next time and then the full amount after that...just because it might make for more fiber.

It tastes good, but it sure has a soggy of texture.  It's weird!  I'm not too sure if I'd make this again.  I used chopped, fresh strawberries for this recipe.

The water in the berries made these muffins mushy. They tasted OK, but the berries lost their firmness.
