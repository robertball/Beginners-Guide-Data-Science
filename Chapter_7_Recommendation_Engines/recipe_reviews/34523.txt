This was wonderful!!!!  I used a 6 pound double smoked, fully cooked picnic ham and put it in the slow cooker with 1/2 the amount of water in the recipe.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours.  2 hours before the time was up I removed the drippings, skimmed the fat of the top and added the honey and brown sugar and cloves.  I did not use liquid smoke or worchestershire sauce.  I actually doubled the amount of glaze as I had two cups of drippings and didn't see the sense in wasting them.  I poured it back over the ham and let it cook for an hour and a half.  I then turned the crock setting to high and removed the lid and basted the ham cooked for half an hour more and pulled the ham out to rest.  I then took the drippings and boiled them on the stovetop gently to reduce.  I served this with baked root vegetables, a salad and some steamed green beans and the glaze reduction on the side which was excellent for adding onto the root veggies and the ham.  Everyone loved the ham and I have only enough left to make a casserole with!

If I could give more stars than 5, I would. This ham was amazing! It was so tender, I could not pick it up out of the pan without it completely falling apart! Here's some secrets that I did. First, I used a 8-pound smoked picnic ham rather than a shank ham. I put it in a dutch oven without a rack. I put the water in as directed. I PUT THE HAM IN FAT SIDE UP! This allowed for the fat to penetrate and "baste" the ham while cooking. I put the lid on  it and forgot about it for 7 hours (1 hour per pound) at 275 degrees. Then I poured all of the liquid out, glazed the ham, anc baked it for another hour. I will definately make this again. It was a hit with my husband who is always looking for that meat to fall off the bone. Now if only I could make a roast this tender....  :-)

Wow.. This was AMAZING! I even used a small, boneless, presliced, alredy cooked ham and it was still Amazing! I just cooked it in the water for an hour to get some of the juices in the water and than I followed the directions for the glaze exactly like it's stated and than poured it over the slices and covered it and cooked it for another hour... and like another poster said the meat that was submurged at the bottom of the pan was the best... We were all fighting over those slices! This is definatly a keeper and I can't wait to try it at Easter w/ a real ham.  THANKS!

This ham was so good, it turned out extremely tender.  I used a fully cooked 18lb ham for easter.  Put it in the oven with the water and let it cook slow for about 3 and a half hours.  I didn't debone it, but cut a checkerboard pattern on the top of the ham and poured the glaze over.   returned the ham to the oven for another half hour and sliced.  So good, everyone had compliments.

This was awesome!  We did a ham for New Year's and I actually did this in my slow cooker.  I put the ham in, cooked for about 5 hours on high, then added the glaze and cooked for 1 1/2 hours on low.  The only problem I had was trying to figure out how to get it out of my crock pot!  The sauce smells and looks a little weird when you mix it up, and I was leery because I'm used to the regular honey/brown sugar glaze, but once it's had time to cook on the ham it's perfect.  I made this with the "potato casserole" (recipe submitted by JeremyBeeler - also a five star recipe... just don't check the nutrition information!)which I've made from time to time over the years and green beans with almonds.

I just made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  It was a tad sweet for my taste, but that's just me.  It was the first time I've made a ham and didn't realize how much fat is on a shank ham, so when I pulled it out of the oven after 8 hours I was shocked at how little meat was left after removing the fat.  I had a 10 lb ham and was planning to feed 13 people.  What was left was not enough to do that so I had to grill 6 chicken breasts and we ate every bit of both.  It was easy though, and a hit, so I will make it again with the knowledge that I need about 1 lb per person.

Used this recipe with a precooked spiral sliced 9lb. ham. As suggested, I cooked for 1 hour on 250 degrees, then followed the recipe, pouring the glaze over the ham. I patted some brown sugar over the top, but that's just my preference. It cooked for about 2 hrs more and was done and delicious. Thanks!

Very good.  I cooked it for Easter, for a family of die-hard baked ham (the $60.00-specialty store kind) fans.  It was a big hit, from waking up in the morning to the delicious smell (cooked over night).  It fell off the bone.  I will say I was nervous baking my own ham, but it was worth it.  The ham was different than any store bought ham I had ever had.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.  I will make it again, and I won't wait until next Easter.

First, let me say this:  I am a NON-HAM person.  With that being said, my boyfriend said  "Hey, let's cook ham for Christmas Eve".  Here's is what we did:  We used an 18 lb supermarket bone-in, precooked ham.  We cooked it for 3 1/2 hours at 275 degrees in water (about 2 inches in the roasting pan), tightly covered in foil.   We took the ham out of the over, kept 1 cup of the "ham water" to add to the glaze recipe (made exactly as directed) and poured out the remainder of the "ham water."  We DID NOT remove the bone.  The ham was recovered tightly with the foil, returned to the oven (still at 275 degrees) and cooked for 30 more minutes.  When finished, it was AMAZING!  The meat literally fell from the bone.  We stood at the stove, peeled pieces of the ham off, dipped the pieces in the "glaze water" at the bottom of the  pan, and looked at each other with big, goofy smiles.  My boyfriend (who IS a Ham Person) thought it was fantastic, but would have liked the glaze to be a bit thicker--maybe not add the "ham water" but brush the ham with the glaze, as is?    Maybe use a thickener like cornstarch?  He wasn't sure.  Needless to say, I have become a "Ham Convert", thanks to this recipe.

This is the best ham I have ever made. I served a very picky family & everyone raved about it!  Out of a 10lb. ham, I only have about 5 pieces left! This was absolutely wonderful and so simple.

I made three 8 lb. raw (butt portion) Smithfield  brand hams for our Easter meal this year and doubled the glaze recipe.  Two were roasted in the oven @ 275 for 5.5 hours and one in a crockpot on low for the same amount of time. All three were good, however, I was surprised I preferred the crockpot ham over the 2 oven roasted.  The color was pink and more appealing and didn't look overcooked as the oven method.   I made the hams ahead of time on Saturday, refrigerated them and sliced with electric knife on Easter.  Baked in the oven with the glaze mixture but added 1/4 cup white wine and  2 Tablespoon honey dijon mustard.  Excellent with the recipe submitted by "nik" for Scalloped Pineapple, Pat's Baked Beans, Cheesy AuGratin Potatoes and a great salad.

This was soooo good! I also had a small fully cooked boneless ham. I cooked in in my crockpot for 4 hrs on high. There was just over 2 cups of water/drippings in the pot, so I took it all, doubled the other ingredients and put it all back in. I then cooked it on low for about 1 1/2 hrs longer. This was the most tender (falling apart) ham I have ever had, and with a wonderful flavor! Yum!

Wish I could give this way more stars. I have made this twice in the last four weeks and will probably make it again very soon. Followed the recipe exactly, no changes required. A moist flavorable ham that is very simple to prepare. Don't worry about the amount of liquid smoke, it does not over power the dish. From now on this is the way I cook ham. Thank you Connie for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I was looking for a glaze to go on our ham for Easter and came across this recipe.  Wow..were we ever in for a treat.  The flavor from this glaze was delicious and family went back for more.  I used a 10 lb. bone-in butt ham...only needed 3 hours of cooking time at 325.  So, I followed the glaze directons and took it out about a 1/2 hour before completion, added the glaze and then cooked for the remainder 30 minutes. Again..wonderful.  I was looking forward to a lot of leftovers...not much left...it was about gone.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Boy did this recipe save my bacon (pun intended)!!  I picked up a 12 pound ham on sale for $0.070/lb at the store earlier in the week not knowing that there was actually such a thing as an uncooked smoked ham!!  Good thing I read the tag on the ham that said "cook for 18-25 minutes per pound" early in the morning before we left for Christmas Day Mass. Luckly, I had all the ingredients in the pantry (it's a law in Texas to keep liquid smoke in the cupboard!).  Anyway, the flavor of the ham after adding the glaze was mild and perfectly spiced witht he ground cloves and Worcestershire.  The meat fell right off the bone.  Also, adding the 2" of water made lots of great broth that will (along with the aforementioned bone) make for some incredible bean soup.   My daughter just told me this is the best ham ever and told me never to buy a spiral sliced ham again!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe Connie!!

WOW! I was really impressed with this recipe. It was the best ham I have ever had and the best part is there was so little work. Just like in the other reviews people who usually don't like ham really enjoyed this. I used a roasting bag instead of a pan and it worked great. Don't expect to serve the ham by carving it because it falls apart. I went ahead and shredded mine before serving and I didn't even need a knife. So tender! I think nest time I will double the glaze because the shredded meat in the bottom of the dish I served it in that was just laying it the juice was the BEST!

I cooked the Ham in the oven for 8 hours at 160 degrees. It was amazing... but very rich... we ate teh left overs, but took awhile cause it was hard to get past how rich it was... but once again we were pleasently surprised by the left overs. and I also did not use the Liquid Smoke nor the worchishire sauce

OH MY GOSH!  I have only ever gotten sprial-cut hams so I never gave any thought to the price.  This recipe's ham was HALF the cost and TWICE as delicious!  At seven hours the bones gently slid from the ham.  The ham was so outrageously delicious at that point I was hesitant to put the glaze on it, but I'm SO glad I did.  I asked my husband to come in to cut the ham, he took one look at it and said, "With what, a spoon?"  (So if you like pretty slices of ham, you wouldn't have liked this. It fell a part with no need to cut which I found to be a bonus.  No meat was left on or around the bone and wasted.) When the leftovers went into the fridge, I made sure that all the leftover glaze went into the container, too. Now the meat has been soaking in it overnight.  Like others, I had been a bit worried about cooking a raw ham, but for $12 for a ham that feeds 3 adults 3 times, with virtually no effort other than opening the package, there's no doubt we'll be buying these throughout the year.  Thank you for the recipe!! It was the crowning touch to my Easter dinner.

This was Awesome!  I think it's the best raw ham ` do ahead recipe out there! I did the slow cooker bit, just because I wanted to cook something off my list so I wouldn't have as much to do on Easter.  I think you could even to the sauce ahead, really. The ham was "like butter" (so sayth my husband, who can be trusted for his honesty!) and the flavor was just right - not too bland, not too hammy - just plain ole great!  (I did add a slug of molasses, just becuase I didn't feel like grinding my whole cloves.  In hindsight, I could have plugged them into the ham before slow cooking it, but the ham just fell apart!! in the cooker, and I would have hated to have to fish them out...)  Anyway, 5 stars isn't enough!

This is a classic. I have used a variation of this recipe for years. I add ground mustard to the mix. I cook the ham in the sauce (all ingredients) for 10 - 12 hours at 200. I then thicken the sauce and use as gravy. Delicious, this turns me on!

I was disappointed in this;  I tasted the ham before glazing, and liked the flavor without the glaze better than with it.  I used a cooking bag instead of a covered roasting pan, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The liquid smoke and/or Worcestershire were just too strong;  maybe cut them in half so some of the honey flavor can come through.

Glazed Ham Haiku: "Oh my gosh, this rocked. Served to guests who ate it up. Sad, no leftovers!" My ham was "done" in about 5 hrs., so I prepared the glaze, didn't debone, and left it covered tightly in the oven on very low for another couple hrs, basting often. Let it rest on the counter, covered, for another hr., again w/ lots of basting, prior to serving. There wasn't any carving necessary, as it fell into wonderful chunks, which my guests happily devoured. Very good, easy glaze which made an otherwise dull (but inexpensive) shank ham super tasty!

Very good ham.  I did not use thye liquid smoke but instead added 2 TBS dijon mustard to the liquid/sugar mixture.  Very tender and tasty.  I did not find it overly sweet at all.  In fact, after we sliced the ham we sprinkled a little of the sweet juice from the bottom of the pot on top of our ham before serving...  Thanks for the recipe.

This was just too easy to get the amount of compliments it got. Very impressive! I did soak my ham in a clean garbage bag of water for several hours to remove some of the salt content. Turned out perfect. Thank you.
AGAIN..awesome. Made this again this year and because of holiday chaos I accidentally left the slow cooker on too long and then supper was delayed so had to reheat again. By the time it was sliced the glaze had almost blackened and it still was complimented over and over again. None left over and it was a BIG ham. Amazing and simple. Love love love it!

I love eating ham at friends and family get togethers but have never made it myself. I made this recipe recently for a family get together and my ham beats every other ham I have eaten hands down!!!  This recipe rocks AND it got rave reviews from all of my in-laws :) This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I used an 11 lb shank ham. Cooked 6 hours in the oven, cut and removed the fat. I cooked the last hour with the glaze in my crockpot. It was delish!!

I'm  not sure what I did wrong but this was definitely not the moist ham that everyone else seemed to make. I followed the directions exactly and the meat did not fall off the bone. It was tasty but not succulent. I bought the shank with its skin on and that's how I cooked it. I only removed it right before adding the sauce. I did like the sauce though that's why I gave it 4 stars. Thanks for the recipe. Next time I'll try cooking it without the skin.

This was really good.  Seeing as my husband usually smokes the ham in a smoker I was skeptical it wasn't going to be close,  I was worried that it might be dry but it wasn't.  I used a smoked ham- from the butcher- not precooked.  It was soooo tender that to get the bone all I had to do was grab it with my tongs and it fell right off.  I didn't use the ground cloves, I used whole ones and stuck them in before I put it in the oven.  I made  the glaze and the left overs for gravy.  I have never had baked ham this tender and juicy.  It was about a 7 pounder and I cooked it for about 7 hours total add doing the whole glazing bit around the 6th hour.  Fantastic.  I would still prefer to have it smoked but all in all a really good recipe if you want to imitate what smoking can do. :)

This was an awesome change from plain old baked ham with cloves and pineapple.  My family loved it and had second and third helpings!  I was hoping for leftovers for taking to work, but alas, none was left!

Excellent recipe!! I marinated a precooked butt portion shank ham in an oven bag with it and a splash of white wine, then baked the ham according to the directions on the label. Wonderful flavor and not a bit dry. We'll definitely use this again - thanks for the post!

Was simple and good.  I added pineapple chunks to it with the juice and cut back a little on the water.  But watched it close to make sure it didn't dry out.  Nobody minded leftovers all week!

Delicious flavor, sweet and smoky.  I reduced the Liquid Smoke to about 1/2 and added about a 1 1/2 tsp. of dried mustard.  This is now my favorite Easter ham recipe.  Thanks!

I made this recipe for my family for Easter. I was a little nervous since I've never cooked a raw ham before.  It turned out beautifully!!  It was a smoked ham, so I left out the liquid smoke, but kept everything else the same.  Not only did everyone enjoy it during the meal, but my husband finished ALL of the cold leftover ham later that night.  I would recommend this recipe and will make it again.

New family favorite! I used a pre-cooked ham, cooked it at 275 for one hour with water, then made the glaze as directed. Cooked it at 275 for a few more hours until it reached 140 degrees. We also used the glaze as a topping for the ham after we sliced it.

I used a 12 lb. Shank Cut Ham and I am pleased to say it was DELICIOUS! I stuck to the recipe, to be safe, and after rave reviews I wouldn't change a thing! cooked for 8 hours on 275 in oven. Poured mix over ham and let it sit out at room temperature till my au gratin potatoes cooked. Ham was fall off the bone fantastic. Popped back into oven last half hour with potatoes and the rest is history......Best ham ever!

I made this recipe last Easter and used a raw ham; everyone said it was the best ham I ever made; not salty at all and very good flavor.  It does take a long time to cook, but it's worth it.  You can get a raw ham from BJ's.

I didn't care for this recipe. Sounds like 90% of the 5 star reviewers didn't really use a RAW ham (which is actually a fresh leg of pork, sometimes called "fresh ham" - very lean meat and shouldn't be cooked for 6-8 hrs), but they used cured, cooked hams.  I have a Wolf oven and used a heavy copper-clad roasting pan, so my equipment was not at fault.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  When I took the meat out after 7 hrs and deboned it, I noticed the top half was dry and tough, while the bottom that sat in the water seemed very tender.  I put all the chunks of meat back in the pan, poured on the sauce, which was watery (1-1/2 cups of overly sweet liquid), covered it as called for, and after 30 minutes ALL of the meat had become tough, floating in a sugar liquid.  Why is this called "Glazed Ham"?  You can't get a glaze when something is braised/steamed after being covered for 7-1/2 hours.  The cooked meat of a "fresh ham" is not pink, it is gray, so I don't think the creator of this recipe had a raw ham in mind, as the picture accompanying the recipe shows pink (cured) ham.  I'm blaming myself for not thinking harder about how all that thin liquid could possibly become a glaze after 30 mins under cover.  Think I'll stick to recipes I watch being made on the various food networks, or Food & Wine magazine.  $25 piece of meat wasted.

Sooo good. As per another reviewer, we agree the bottom part that cooked in all the liquid was to die for. I started with a 7 lb bone in picnic ham and used 1 cup of water (per label directions). Cooked for two hours at *350* (not 275) then did the glaze part and cooked for another hour. I didn't have liquid smoke but it was amazing even without it. I wonder if the smoke flavor would have detracted from it anyway... I will never make ham any other way again.

By far the best ham recipe ever!  I leave it in for almost 7, sometimes 8 hours...the longer the better.  I then take it out and shred it and toss the sauce on all the shredded peices and pop it back in the oven for about 30 minutes and toss about 2 or 3 more times during the 30 minutes.  So delicious!

My husband got up at 4am to start this ham, thought he was nuts but it really paid off.  This was by far the best ham I have ever tasted, just about melted in your mouth, could cut it with a fork.  Everyone loved it.

Kudos, Connie! Easy prep...I start before going to bed... sleep through the cooking time...awaken to an aromatic house! Try this as a glaze variation: To a Cup of ham juice add 1/2 C brown sugar & 1/2 C pancake syrup (instead of honey).  Add stone-ground mustard to taste... I use about half a container of Plochman's (about 5 oz).  
You've made many people you don't know very happy with this recipe!

This ham was perfect! I made it for my work Christmas party last night, and out of a 13 lb. ham and 9 people, there is all of two pounds left. It was very sweet and smoky. I ran out of honey and used two tablespoons of molasses, and it was just awesome.

I printed up this recipe for a coworker that wanted a simple way to bake a ham for Thanksgiving. After the holiday, she told me that her entire family ranted and raved about how good it was. So, I decided to give it a try today and she was right, it was totally awesome! Two thumbs up! I'll probably bake most of my hams this way from now on.

This is a terrific ham recipe. Everybody raved about it. I wonder about the added water though. I put in the 3 cups but part way through the water was almost half way up my roaster. I used a Cook's ham, and maybe it was one of those that they pump up with water (or worse), but I had to siphon a lot out.

I make this every Easter. Everyone loves it. I cook it for at least 12 hours so it falls off the bone. I also add cinnamon. I just shake some in so maybe 1/2-1 tsp. People rave about it. It is soooooo good. Way better than honey baked ham.

I typically can't stand the taste of ham.  When I got married I still felt the need to carry on the traditions of my parents so I bought a ham.  Not knowing how to cook it, I went searching and found this recipe.  I am in love with it.  I still don't like ham unless it is cooked this way.  Nice job on the recipe!

This was awesome tasting and SOO easy to make. My kids all loved it and they are 6,3 and 1. Served with au gratin potatoes and spinach, great meal. Had the leftovers the next day in cheese quesadillas for lunch and at night for sandwiches with BBQ sauce. The rest is in the freezer. Makes a lot so stock up on the freezer bags.

This ham is wonderful.  The only thing that i do differently is I don't add the smoke to it.  It still tastes wonderful.  I cooked this for my wedding reception, and everyone loved it.

This was a huge hit at a party I had 8 months ago....people are still talking about it!  The ham turned out to be kind of like candied flaky chunks when done.  Very easy and tasty.

I tried this recipe about 2 years ago and the group loved it. I used a pre-cooked bone-in ham and broke the ham up into chucks before returning to the pan. I also doubled the sauce. This allowed for the pieces to absorb more of the flavor than would have if I left the meat in a large hunk. What little leftovers I had got eaten on sandwiches the next day. I am Sooo glad that I was able to find it again.

I could not find a raw ham and so had to use a smoked shank ham and it was SOOOO good. I will always make my hams with this recipe. I did cut down on the cooking time because the ham was smoked and wished I hadn't, I think it would have been even more tender.

I only gave 4 stars because I'm not a fan of liquid smoke and therefore used my own glaze. That being said, the slow roasting in water gave me one of the best hams I've made in years! It really reduces the saltiness of the ham and the meat was very tender. So whether or not you prefer to use your own glaze, the roasting method is wonderful.

Love this sauce!  My only recommendation would be to cook your ham according to the type and weight.  I usually buy a picnic shoulder which needs to be cooked on the stove top and for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Other than that the sauce is perfect just the way it is.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe, Connie.

This is a very tasty glaze! I used a precook turkey ham which I sliced and placed into a small casserole to reheat. I added a little water in the bottom of the casserole. Once heated, I poured the glaze over the ham and covered with an aluminum foil and heated in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The glaze is sweet with a hint of smoky flavor. There was nothing overpowering at all in the glaze. In fact, I liked it so much that I poured a little glaze over my rice too. I served this with, "Creamy Sweet Corn, "Double Cheesy Au Gratin Potatoes," also from this site.

Fantastic Ham!!!! I did a 12 lb ham. I thawed it the night before and I cooked it at 350 for 3.5 hrs the morning of. I forgot to cover it and realized it in the middle of church. I got home to check on it, thought I had ruined it cause it was a little black.  I took it out, turned it over and put my glaze mixture on the bottom. I did not remove any of the drippings. I put it back in uncovered and the ham turned out perfect in the end! It was a hit and was nearly gone with 11 people eating on that 12 lb ham!

I know that the main reason that I am so mad at this recipe is because I should have used better judgement, but I hope that my mistake can help others.  The four cups of water is WAY TOO MUCH!  I put this in the oven to cook overnight for a big Easter dinner party and woke up at 4 am (5 hours into the bake) when my ham drippings came over the edge, baked onto the bottom of the oven that I needed to use all day, and filled my home with thick smoke.  I had planned my day to the minute to prepare a big dinner on time and that planning did not allow for an hour of oven cleaning and a ham that ended up a little dry anyway.  If I did this again I would use an oven bag and much less water.

This was my first year celebrating Christmas with my husbands family.  I made the entire meal.  Cooking a ham was something I have never done, I made a spiral ham using this recipe and it turned out amazing. The only bad part was there were no left overs! Great recipe!

Never made a ham a day in my life, but I really wanted one and I used this recipe.  FABULOUS! Now, 2 tbsp seemed like a bit much so I used 1 tbsp and it was very good.

OMG, I have never made a ham before in all my years of cooking because I don't really like it but I have to say this was the best ham I have ever had, I wanted to cook this for as long as the recipe stated but I didn't have the time so I cooked it for 4 hours the day before Christmas, I removed the glaze from the panand refrigerated it until Christmas day, I sliced it up and put it in a roasting pan with some of the glaze covered it and heated it up while we carved the turkey and everyone raved about how good it was. I love ham now and this will be the only recipe that I will use, thank you

I thought this was fantastic. The best part is the smokiness you get from the liquid smoke. It's way better than just an ol' fashioned sweetened ham.

I inadvertently meant to buy a baked smoked ham & just use the honey baked ham recipe on this site to make it but I erred & bought a raw ham on New Year's Eve! Oh vey. The next day I made this (using the other honey baked ham glaze w/brown sugar rather than dark corn syrup) and it was the best ever! I hated ham b4 but now I love it. I can't wait to run to the store to get a ham today.  I slow roasted at 275 a 10 lb raw ham using a temp guage & then used other recipet once baked to "honey bake" it for 1 1/2 hours on high temp.  II am an excellent cook (pro actually) but shyed away from hams but that ha now changed. I used leftovers (although my husband and I didnt leave that much leftovers0 for scalloped potatoes - cheese soup w ham & others.

Crazy good - used a pre-cooked ham and cooked it in water for about 1.5 hours before following the glaze recipe.  My husband asked for the leftovers for dinner the next night - a sure winner.

Although I did not slow roast my ham, I still made this glaze and poured it over my ham and it was delicious! I also didn't have any cloves to add, but it was still a great glaze!

I used this recipe for our Easter ham yesterday and it was delicious! I cooked a 9.5 lb ham in the slowcooker. I think the slowcooker is a better idea because it seems to keep more of the moisture in and you can keep an eye on it more easily. I cooked it on high for 3 hours and then 4 hours on low. It was "melt in your mouth" delicious!

This was excellent.  The ham fell off the bone, the glaze was awesome.  Now I'm taking the hambone and making ham & beans tomorrow.  I will so completely make this every time ham goes on sale.

Used a cooked spiral cut ham so baked for less time, maybe two hours, then added the glaze and cooked for another hour.  Smelled and tasted great.  Lots of compliments at my holiday brunch today. Can't wait to use the bone and scraps left over for split pea soup.

This was GOOD!!!  I made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe to a tee and was REALLY satisfied with the results!! I'm currently cooking up the leftovers in a batch of split pea soup (can't wait to try it, smells heavenly). Next time I may decrease the brown sugar and honey from 1/2 c. each to 1/3 c. each.  Give this ham recipe a try and you won't regret it!!

Tried this recipe for the first time on Christmas after reading all of the great reviews.  I cooked a 10lb. shank ham overnight, placed in the refrig in the morning and reheated it and served about 15 adults in the afternoon.  There wasn't a piece left!  Absolutly delicious!! I received endless compliments on this ham and I will probably be asked to make this ham each holiday!! I would not change a thing about this recipe!  Perfection!

Positively the tenderest ham you will ever make! The meat slide off the bone. I omitted the cloves and took the advice of others and cut down the liquid smoke to only 1/2 tsp. Took it to a church potluck and everyone was asking who made the delicious ham!! This one is a keeper for sure as it could even make an inexperienced cook look professional! EASY!!!

I am not fond of ham but rest of family does so this Christmas I tried this recipe in my slow cooker and it turned out amazing! I had a spiral fully cooked 8 lb. ham and it was done in 4 hrs. on low. I only used about 2 cups of the water and left out the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke since I was out. Still turned out amazing, fall off the bone and I was nibbling every time I basted it. I will be buying ham again.

Made it Christmas night for my gf and her family. Some of the best ham I've ever tried, didn't have liquid smoke so I went without it. It's probably even better with liquid smoke, can't wait to try it and see.

This recipe made a wonderful glaze! I didn't have liquid smoke, so my ham was wonderfully sweet and caramelized, but I would have loved to taste it with the added smokiness. I used the original glaze recipe, but changed the approach. About 20-30 minutes before serving, I began to spoon the glaze over the ham in 5 minute increments, and did not cover it again. This created a nice caramelized color (its not burnt!- its CARAMELIZED!!) that I love to see in a ham, along with making a nice crunch on the outer layer of ham. It also kept the Ham extremely moist while it rested on the counter before cutting. I have added a hard copy of this recipe to my recipe box, where it will be used on many hams to come! Thanks!!

well, my glaze was more akin 2 juice. but it's great juice! just wish it would stick to my ham! next time i will use  less liquid and hopefully that will make it workout out. my ham was juicy though, not dried out. i made sure to flip the ham every hour so that each side sat in the  juice. other than the very liquid like glaze, it was good. i will try again w/ less juice, maybe 1/2 cup and then update my review.

So Delicious. My husband doesn't like ham but likes this recipe. I don't add the cloves but only because I don't like cloves. We use the left over ham in a ham and bean soup.

We absolutely loved this recipe. The ham was really tender (cooked for 7 hours). The glaze was marvelous. My fiance hates honey baked ham but he loved this. Thanks for a great recipe! I will definitely make it again.

I can't give more than five stars. If I could, I doubt I'd ever stop. The ham was wonderful on it's own, but the glaze really took it over the top. This will be my new ham recipe from now on. Bravo, Connie. Even my picky husband couldn't stop raving about this. Sorry, no pics. My camera died this morning.

Made this for Easter, Everyone Loved it. So flavorful, great combo of smoky and sweet flavors. I will definately use this everytime I make ham, the only thing I did differently is I added a few slices of pineapple and a couple cherries when combining all the other ingredients and I used a fully cooked ham so I didn't cook it as long.

I will admit I liked this recipe better than the beer ham on this site. It seemed to cook up juicy and everyone enjoyed it. I will be making this again.

My favorite baked ham recipe. Please don't waste your money on a spiral or smoked ham. It works best with a regular uncooked ham. Sometimes I add some pinapple chunks with juice. Always gets compliments.

This was a very tasty ham.  I followed the idea given of using a crock pot which worked quite nicely.  I didn't use the liquid smoke flavoring since my family doesn't care for it all that much. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

The BEST! After cooking and cooling, I shred the meat by hand to ensure maximim exposure to the glaze. My son likes me to double the glaze, so all the pieces get a thorough coating. I always omit the liquid smoke; personal preference. I really like that I can make this ahead of time. It's a sure thing for Christmas and Easter, but it's too good to have *only* then. Do yourself a favor and buy some extra hams when they're on sale, to freeze and cook throughout the year! After shredding and glazing, I place the ham AND all glaze in a Zip-lock bag for storage in the fridge. It's great to have on hand for those busy days when everyone seems to be eating at different times. When they're hungry, they can just make themselves a quick sandwich. A family favorite for sure! I've made this over and over. Half a ham sounds like a lot, but I have repeatedly seen this get eaten up in the blink of an eye. From now on, I think I'll cook a whole ham! Keep this one in mind when you're taking a meal to someone. They'll love it too!

This was my first time cooking a ham so I had no clue what I was doing.  For those of you in the same situation my advice would be not to cook a pre-cooked, spiral cut ham for 8 hours.  Most of my ham was so dried up it was like pork jerky.  The only thing that saved some of the pieces was that I left some submerged in the juices left in the pan.  Those pieces were unbelievably delicious.  I will definitely make this ham again but not cook it as long.  Lesson learned :)

Terrific!  Although I started the temp at 275 as directed in the recipe, I eventually raised it to 375 to bake another dish and then lowered it to 350 to bake yet another dish.  The ham still turned out moist and delicious!  I was a little skeptical about how much flavor the ham would absorb from the sauce, but it turned out perfectly - mildly smoky and sweet.  Since other reviewers compained about the sweetness, I was prepared for something like a Heavenly Ham, but it was definitely not THAT sweet! Can't wait to serve this at our next family holiday gathering!

This recipe is awesome!  I went on the reviews alone to fix it for my Christmas Eve dinner.  My family raved about how good it was!  They said it was the best ham they had ever had.  I have to agree, even if I did fix it, it was the best tasting ham I have ever had.  I would highly recommend this recipe!

Very easy, very tasty!  Great for hot ham and rolls since the ham just falls apart.  The glaze was more of a tasty sauce, it wasn't soupy but not really a glaze.  Will be making this again!

This was my first ham to make. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit. It was so tender and fell to pieces and the deboning was quite simple it just pulled right out. If your friends and family like the flavor of bbq then they will enjoy this recipe. Thanks so much Connie

I had never cooked a raw ham before.  Although the meat fell apart, this did not taste like ham at all, it came out more like a pork roast.  I cooked this for Easter and it was very disappointing because it did not taste like ham like I expected it to.

This was the best ham! It just fell off the bone and tasted great even before I put on the glaze. I ususally don't care for ham, but after tasting this one I couldn't get enough. I didn't have worchetshire (sp) sauce and didn't even miss it. Everyone in my family loved it, even my three year old!

This recipe is for ham, not pork.  It does not call for raw ham, I use bone in smoked ham and it is always amazing. I remove any ham that I plan to use  for other recipes (that would not be good with sweet ham) and then add the sauce to the remaining ham and stir occasionally until done.

I wish I could give this more stars! This is the absolute best way to cook a ham ever. The first time I made it was Christmas dinner and I was pressed for time (increased cooking temperature to 350 degrees for 4 hours) and it was still very good.  But making it today for New Years Eve celebration and cooked overnight. WOW! I have never deboned a ham so easily.  This will be a family tradition at our house. Thanks for the recipe.

i made this for a group of moms and their kids, and they all LOVED it!  one friend even asked me to make a glazed ham for her son's birthday party.  it was a great outcome for so little effort.  this recipe is simple. straight-forward and very yummy.  children can be the toughest of food critics!  and they gave it two thumbs up.

This ham was tender, full of flavor, and super delicious!!! I omitted the cloves because my husband hates them and halved the honey (I ran out....oops). I also added a 1/4 cup of pineapple juice to the marinade mixture. Once I poured the mixture of the ham I layer pineapple slices on top and put it back in the oven as directed. My family raved about this ham it

I made this ham for a very skeptical family, cooking my first real Christmas dinner. It was fantastic! Even mom admitted it was the most tender, moist ham she'd ever had! Thanks so much for a great recipe, and for saving my hide on Xmas! :)

I had a small Trader Joe's ham that I needed a marinade for.  This was very tasty and I will definitely use it again at Easter.  Thanks!

OMG.  THIS WAS THE BEST.

I got my ham for 98cent a point.  It was a semi boneless ham.  After reading the reviews, I decided to mesh directions.  I put 4 cups of water in an oven bag and with the ham and cooked it at the temp and time on the label on the ham (actually a little under time--I cooked it for 12 lbs and the ham was almost 13).  Then I drained the bag, set the ham aside and poured the drippings in a bowl.  I took the ham off the bone, put it back in the pan and made double the glaze after seeing how much meat there was.  There wasn't a lot of fat, so I didn't skim.  I poured the mix and reduced heat to 275 and baked for 30 min.  It wasn't a glaze as much as a au jus, but it was so so moist and yummy.  I put leftover meat and glaze in a freezer bag for a crockpot dump meal.  The kids can't wait to have it again!

Served this for Easter dinner, rave reviews. I didn't have to talk anyone into taking left overs home. I followed the recipe exactly (a shocker to the family). I thought that the flavor was great. However I thought that the meat was on the dry side. Having said that I should also mention that I have a new stove due to wifes insistence to go with a new kitchen. I sure miss the old one. Anyhow will make again, and probably use a baking bag, and keep a closer eye on it. Thanks for sharing.

I usually just use pineapple juice and brown sugar for a glaze but did not have pineapples so I tried this recipe.  From now on, I will only use this glaze for any hams I make  Thank you Connie.

This was a delightful change from what we usually do with our hams.  It had a slight smokey flavor but not too overpowering like some people said.  Everyone that tried it loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.

I cooked this for our Christmas lunch and I have never cooked a raw ham before as we typically buy a Honey Baked Ham (that cost WAY more than a raw ham!)  This came out different than I expected, more like pulled roast versus sliced ham, but it was really good.  It was pretty salty, but it had a great flavor.  My family did go back for seconds at lunch.  My husband loves spicy food and made several sandwiches w/ the ham adding Pete’s Extra Hot sauce.  I would make this again!!!

Very good,although not quite what I was expecting. I have quite a bit of drippings and bones to use for other recipes. The kids prefer a precooked ham simply sliced and pan-fried.

I used this recipe just for the glaze.  It has to be the best ham glaze I have ever used.  I used a boneless ham and scored it and placed the cloves.  I then basted every 15 min. with the glaze.  My family used this recipe at Easter after I told them about it and everyone loved it.

Made this for my Easter ham this year and I know I'll be keeping the recipe to use every year.  Delicious!  We couldn't stop eating it.  The only down side was burning my fingers while trying to debone the ham.  I ended up using two forks and that worked great, but I still burned myself trying to pick the fat out.  All in all, a few burned fingertips were worth it.  I can't wait to have the leftovers tonight.  Like other reviewers, I used a fully cooked ham, and it was still delicious.  I was worried that it would dry out, but it was very moist.  Great recipe!

Great!  I fixed it for Easter, it was delicious!  Everyone loved it and couldn't quit eating it.  I did mine in the crop pot over night and in the morning drained off water, kept the one cup as instructed and mixed with other ingredients and poured back over ham and kept on low for another 2 hours.  Will fix again and again!

Easy, moist, and tasty. My husband couldn't keep his hands off of it while I was trying to cut it up before glazing. I was going to serve it with baked yams, but I didn't have time to cut up the yams - I had to hurry up and serve this ham before my husband got full from "tasting" it. So I "whipped" up some instant mashed potatoes and canned corn and there was dinner. If I knew that baking a ham could be this easy, I would have been doing it a long time ago. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I wasn't fond of this recipe as the sauce overpowered the ham flavor.  Way too sweet.  Followed the recipe exactly.  It was tender but not to my liking.  Sorry.

This was a very tender roast, but wayyyy too sweet for my family. My 7 lb "fresh pork shoulder ham" was done in 6 hours and I had a hard time lifting it out of the pan. Finnaly just pulled the bones out with my fingers and scraped the fat off with a spoon. I've never cooked an uncured ham before and it wasnt the pink color you expect. It tasted like pork loin roast. Mine was on sale for 59cents a pound so I would probably make again but with a different glaze.

This was the first ham that I've ever made.  Everyone told me that it was the best ham they had ever eaten.  The only change I made to the recipe was skipping the cloves (not a fan).  This disappeared quickly...

This ham was very tender, but the sauce was too much.  You cannot taste the ham flavor because all of the other flavors overpower it.  I prefer ham to taste more like ham--this was sort of like barbecue.

This was scrumptious! Used an 8 lb pre cooked butt portion. Baked only 1.5 hrs then returned to bake another hr.
We don't eat ham very often d/t the salt content but will be using this recipe when we do.
Thanks for submitting this delicious recipe.

Yummy---reminiscent of Mom's ham.  Just the right mix of flavors.  Very easy, too.

Husband made this at the firestation for an Easter lunch and it went over very well.  Lucky for me he brought some leftovers home and I know I will be trying this one myself.  Yummy!!! Best ham I've had.  Thanks Connie.

I made this for Easter and used two 12 lb. bone in hams. We put them in the oven at 275 for 6 hours.... and used the recipe (tripled it because had 24 lbs. of ham) and followed it exactly. My family raved about it. Heard many "this is the best ham I have ever had."  Will DEFINETLY make again. Loved it.

Fantastic!  Everyone said it was the best ham they'd ever had.  I used apple juice in the slow cooker within 3 inches of the top.  Had to cut pieces off the ham and fit them around. Then I set it on low and went to bed. In the morning the aroma of the ham was so nice and it was fully cooked (8 hours). I carefully took the pieces out and placed them on a cutting board.
Then I poured the drippings into a large bowl and set it outside in the cold for the fat to congeal so I could discard that part of it. Meanwhile I cut up the ham and placed it back in the cooker and poured the glaze over that I made the day before. I changed the servings to 18 so used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup maple syrup, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. liquid smoke, 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce, almost a tsp. of ground cloves, all heated up for a bit. When you're ready to use it, add 1 cup of the drippings to that and pour over the ham. Cook on low with cover on for another hour or two and that's it.  You'll think you died and went to heaven. I saved the rest of the drippings and froze that for another time when I want to make ham gravy. It was very easy to bring the ham in the cooker to a potluck because it was already sliced and ready to eat. Thanks for a winner!

I used a fully cooked ham for this.  I mixed all the glaze ingredients with a little water to make a nice paste and slathered a little over half of it on the ham.  I put about a cup and a half of water in the bottom of the pan, covered the pan with foil and put it in a 350 degree oven for one and a half hours, basting the ham twice.  After that time, I took the foil off and spread the last of the glaze mix on the ham and cooked the whole thing for another half hour.  It tasted great.  The flavors weren't over the top.  Instead, they complimented the taste of the ham.  I know I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this ham for Thanksgiving this year.  It was by far the best ham I've ever made.  The family loved it and it is now the new tradition.

We made this for Easter Sunday dinner.  We didn't have any leftovers!  It was so juicy & tender.  My husband said he'd never tasted ham this good before!  I even forgot the liquid smoke & it was still wonderful.

I used a fully cooked half ham for this recipe and thought it was pretty good. I warmed it in the oven covered with foil and 1" water in pan. Then with the water "drippings" I made the sauce. I sliced the ham, poured the sauce over and cooked for another 45 minutes. Not as good as others have said with the longer roasting time on a bone-in ham that makes it so tender.

The glaze flavor was good.  I used a pre-cooked ham in a slow cooker as some others had tried and mine turned out really dry.

An excellent, easy recipe. This was my first time cooking a ham, and it was so simple! I did not use the liquid smoke but it turned out great and the ham just fell off the bone. Will make again.

We really liked this recipe.  Our ham was falling off the bone done after about 5 hours so we took it out of the oven and just let it sit in the roaster for the last hour.  

The only other changes that we made weret0 cut back on the liquid smoke to less than a table spoon and using a Splenda blend brown sugar.

Very good recipe.  Moist, tasty, and tender.

Very tender and juicy.  I cooked shank, bone in ham, in foil roaster covered with foil overnight, about 6 hours.  Ham just fell off the bone.  So easy!  Pour drippings into bowl and place in freezer until it gels to easily skim fat off.  I left out the liquid smoke and cut back on the worchestershire sauce.

This recipe was so easy and added great flavor.   The glaze packet that comes with store-bought hams has a funny, chemical taste to it, so I was very glad to find such a tasty alternative.  I will definitely use this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this ham!  It is so tender and juicy.  It literally just falls off the bone.  It is so easy to make.  The only hard part is getting all of the fat cut off when I'm deboning the ham.  I don't bother to put it back in the oven since it dries it out just a touch.  The maple sauce was pretty good, but I prefer using my own family recipe for a pineapple sauce.  Also, because the ham is much bigger than we need, we chop up the leftovers and freeze them in 1 cup increments.  Now, we always have one of these little bags of ham in the fridge.  It is perfect for making a chef salad, or wraps, or throwing on a homemade pizza, etc.  So tasty!!!

The only part of this recipe that I did not enjoy was cutting up the ham.  Rather messy but all in all it was worth it.  Followed the recipe exactly and it is delicious.  I spent about $15.00 on my ham.  Normally I get one of the more expensive hams (with the honey glaze)about $50.00 from a vendor.  Never again.  My family just loved it. Only had enough for dinner the next day.

Great ham -- I did 11 lb butt portion for 5 adults & 2 kids..Only have enough left for a few sandwichs! Only thing I did different was I did not use the liq smoke or cloves, in place of them I did 4 slices of fresh pineapple spun in the food processer. VERY good. Will definatly make again & again.

This recipe was wonderful. I have never been able to bake a moist flavorful ham, so I scoured the recipes here to find one. My family (kids) loved this ham. My daughter who really doesnt like ham ate it for lunch and late night dinner!  I think the next time I will try to make the glaze a little thicker to make more of a coating on the ham.

I used the glaze on a precooked  ham, reducing the Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke by half, because I thought it seemed like a bit too much salt for us. Very good. I will make it again.

We loved it!  The juices/glaze was excellent.  I had a 11lb ham (fully cooked-non spiral) .  I cooked at 300 for 4hrs and then poured on glaze and cooked another 1hr @ 300. This time we just had small bowls of the glaze next to our plate and dipped out ham in it.  Sooo good! Next time I want to figure out how not to have the glaze so thln though.  The only thing I would change.

Super easy recipe to make! I made this for our Christmas Day dinner and it was a hit. I had a smaller ham, so adjusted the cooking time and it turned out perfectly!

So delicious and so easy. We used it on a boneless ham because we were only cooking for 2 1/2 people. Had a friend come over who doesn’t normally eat ham and he even said it was delish.

Turned out wonderful. I did add some (probably about a half of a jar) cherry juice from a jar of cherries and cooked it all in the crockpot! Yum! Everyone loved it.

This is the only way I'll make a ham now. I cooked this in the oven until the ham was falling apart. The next day, I then made ham & noodles with the leftovers. Mmmmm!

very nice sauce, not to sweet and enhances the flavor of the ham..I pre made it with chicken broth and added it over the ham while cooking about 1/2 hour before it was done. After carving the ham I added sauce over it on the serving dish. yum!

Very good. Started out with a double smoked 15  pound specialty ham so it was much drier than the ones you get in the grocery store. I added liquid 3 times and did the glaze at the end like it said. Made double glaze because the ham was so much larger than the recipe stated.

This ham was amazing!  Fall-off-the-bone amazing!  I cooked an 8 pound bone in game at 250 degrees for 5 hours.  I had to turn off the oven and leave the ham for 3 more hours.  I took it out, made a glaze of the drippings and a cup of brown sugar, coated the deboned ham and heated for another 30 minutes. Everyone loved it!

This was incredible! I used half water and half apple juice and cooked the ham in my pc deep covered baker. We couldn't stop wandering into the kitchen and grabbing more ham!

I thought this was yummy! I had a 5 pound fully cooked boneless ham.  Put it in the crock pot for a couple hours to get some juice from it.  Made the glaze, minus the liquid smoke because I didn't have any.  I didn't miss it though!  Baked it in the oven for about an hour.  I think it would have been better had I just skipped the crock pot part, but overall it really was good, and I will use the glaze recipe again :)

This is a great recipe.  I just tried this for Christmas dinner and my Dad was telling me how I needed to cook the ham and that what I was doing was wrong (he had never even cooked a ham before) well when he tasted it he said now that's the way a ham is supposed to taste. I added a little beer in the cooking water for extra flavor. It was so tender and delicious.

Great ham recipe.  I have made it twice with good results.  Next time I may substitute maple syrup for the honey.
