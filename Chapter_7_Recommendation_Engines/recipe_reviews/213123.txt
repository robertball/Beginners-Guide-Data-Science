Good base recipie for filling that part was tasty, but you end up with a heavy load of dough on top and the filling tends to squeeze out. Going to retry with a jellyroll method spreading the filling over the whole bread and rolling like a jellyroll.

Very good and very easy.  I used 4 b/s chicken thighs instead of breasts, cooked in the slow cooker with bbq sauce then shredded.  I also substituted green onion for the bell pepper.  Got very good reviews at my Super Bowl party.

This recipe is fabulous!  :)  I halved the amounts of most ingredients because we were only 2 people eating.  I used refrigerated dinner rolls because I have never seen crusty french bread in a can in Canada.  It was perfect.  I popped one roll in the bottom of a greased (with bacon grease, duh) muffin tin, topped with some chicken mixture and topped with another roll.  They were like little individual chicken stuffed buns.  YUM!  I replaced the green pepper with shallots (personal preference) and omitted the egg wash, because I couldn't be bothered.  I also used the BBQ sauce we received with our AllRecipes AllStars Canada Mystery ingredient box, which was a little spicy and super delicious.  I'm sure I will make these again!

This recipe is a fantastic base/concept recipe that I will be experimenting with in the future.

Obviously the BBQ sauce is key, so pick a good one!  We used Blue Ribbin' (a phenomenal Canadian artisan brand).

Like a previous review said, I've never seen French bread in a can so I used refrigerated dinner roll dough.  I made two versions: little buns and one big loaf of bread (I rolled the dough out).  We definitely preferred the little buns - very portable!

I doubled the cheese (we LOVE cheese) and added onions.  Next time I would cut the BBQ sauce a bit.  

One note about baking time: you need at least a half hour (per the recipe) - regardless of the dough baking instructions.  This does NOT taste good when it is under baked!

Finally, next time I would saute the green pepper and onion a little bit and make sure to assemble the mixture when the veggies and chicken were still warm.  This should make sure the cheese melts in the center (surprisingly, it didn't the first time I made it).

A good concept that I will be sure to try again in the future.  My guy loved it!
