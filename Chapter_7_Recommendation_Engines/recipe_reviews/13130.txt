This was a great way to use my leftover leeks.  I didn't have any cream, so I just used milk and a full cup of Cheddar cheese.  I love the idea of blending the soup to make it creamier, because I don't have a food processor.  My friend said this soup tasted very British.  My boyfriend was unsure of the leek/mustard comb, but when he tasted it he was only too happy to finish the pot.  It was FANTASTIC scooped up with toasted french bread.

What a unique combo of flavors! I decided not to puree the soup, because I enjoy the potato chunks. Toward the end of simmering, I still thought it tasted 'not quite there' - so I added perhaps 2-3 TBSP of apple cider vinegar. Sounds odd - but it gave it just the right tang and added a bit more depth. I recommend!

I made a few modifications of my own and came out with the best soup I have ever made!!! Probably not the healthiest but delicious for sure.

First, I cut up some Bacon (about 12 strips), fried it in the soup pot first... removed the crumbles after they were crisp and then used the bacon fat to fry up the veggies. I added some veggies from my garden... Bell Peppers, Onions, Leeks... after they were cooked tender, I added corn starch and made a rue with the bacon fat... added water and milk and instead of using mustard powder, I squeezed in some dijon mustard. Then added the carrots and potatoes.

After it was all cooked through, I used the immersion mixer and blended all the veggies. I used a shredded 3 cheese blend that I already hand in the fridge, also added some additional spices for a little extra flavor. Cayenne, paprika, Cumin, a little nutmeg and some basil...

At the end I added the bacon crumbles back into the mix... YUMMY!!!

This is a great recipe with the most interesting flavor. This is most definitely the most fattening recipe for soup ever! My husband and I loved it, though. 

*Tip*
Try it as a creamy sauce for pasta.

I liked it, but my husband didn't care for it.  Leeks are a little high in are area, so I don't think I will make it again.

I added more mustard and was glad I did, as otherwise it might have been a little bland. But overall my husband I really enjoyed the recipe and will definitely make it again. I also used milk instead of cream and was pleased with the result.

I made this yesterday and it was okay.  A little bland, even with some extra mustard.  It doesn't need the cream at all, since it purees to a nice texture.  I would add a bit of spice and maybe something else (not sure what) to pick up the flavour.  I used a very sharp cheddar, and it was still a bit bland.

Couldn't taste the mustard. Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. Used cream cheese (what I had on hand) instead of Gruyere.

I made this for lunch. I didn't add the cream had it handy but just felt it didn't need it. I also used just cheddar as I forgot to buy the gruyere. Instead of the cream I used a splash or two of milk and it was still creamy. We had this with cheese herb bread from this site. Thoroughly enjoyed it thanks.

Please take this review with a grain of salt, because I did not make it EXACTLY as written.  However, I will say that we LOVED it, and it's definitely worth giving it a try.  I didn't make huge changes.  I basically omitted the onion (I felt as though the leeks were enough of that flavor profile) and added some frozen peas before pureeing.  It was fabulous.  Thanks!

I made this but it didn't impress me that much.  I gave it 3 stars because it includes Leeks, which are so healthy and not many recipes use them.  I didn't think the mustard flavor came through well enough, I would double that, and also the specialty cheese was not available at my grocrey store, so I just had to use all cheddar instead.

I made this for dinner tonight and found it absolutely divine and DH thought so too! The only changes I made were half and half instead of cream, and when I read the bacon idea I had to do it :) And btw, Trader Joe's sells a Gruyere/Cheddar brick chesse that is fabulous for this!!! Served with toasted Rosemary rolls =Perfect!

The recipe was a home run, even for my partner who does not care for soups.  Not only is it easy to make, but as others have said, it can be tweaked to the consumers' preferences.

Mmmmmmm!  My 9-yr-old picked this out and LOVES this!  She prefers milder tastes.  We added some spicy roasted pumpkin seeds as a garnish- WOW!

I did not have the Gruyere cheese, and used instead a cheese called La Creme De La Creme made in France by Supreme, of about 1/2 lb with the white covering removed and discarded. I used only 1/4 cup of half and half in place of the heavy cream because the cheese is so heavy in fat and cream.  I grind the mustard seeds, so they would be very fresh tasting. I weighed the leeks before chopping, and after chopping.  These leeks weighed more before the chopping.  In other words, I weighed out 1 1/2 pounds both ways.  I think a person writing down a recipe should take such into consideration, and note how many cups of leeks and about how many leeks (or other veggies).  The chopped leeks weighing 1 1/2 pounds were around a cup and half less.  Yes, they were weighed on a vegetable weight.  I do not use black pepper because of the toxin in black pepper called piperine that contributes to arthritis. Piperine may have other health benefits, but those people that have cut it out of their diet suffers less with attacks of arthritis along with omitting chicken and eggs. Cayenne pepper is not the same in effects as black pepper.  I rated this recipe a 5 star because other items on hand can be substituted for an item that one may be out of, and it is very healthy with leeks having so much potassium.  A good way to use leeks instead of just the potato soup with leeks.
