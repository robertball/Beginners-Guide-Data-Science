perfect, I've searched for several years to find this Vinaigrette.  It's all about portions and ingredients. Maille Dijon is a must!

This is a perfect vinaigrette for potato salad or a main dish salad.  This is a beautiful change from mayonnaise dressings.   Thank you for posting this recipe.

I added this easy dressing over roasted orange beets, cooled them in the fridge and served them with parmesan crusted basa filets. The cold and hot contrast is wonderful!

Very good as is.  Then, I also added some pureed frozen peaches and fresh basil leaves to it, just because I had some those on hand.  Excellent salad dressing.

I was looking for a base  with mustard in a dressing to knock off my french friend's homemade dressing. He mixed French mustard (closest thing i have is Dijon), Balsamic, Honey, and Olive Oil, Salt/Pepper. I did this recipe's measurements and added 1 TB honey. Voila! Great recipe!

I have used mustard in dressings before and never tasted it, but in this one it was a little too over powering for me and my husbands taste since we are not fans of mustard.

This was delicious. I didn't have the honey dijon dressing so I used regular dijon and some honey. I purchased some Maille honey dijon this week so I'll try it again as written. We all loved it.

Wow this was so good!!  I didn't have any honey Dijon mustard so I used Dijon mustard  and added a bit of corn syrup to it.  I served over mixed greens, mushrooms and topped with chopped mixed nuts.  I wouldn't change a thing; thanks for posting.

How much is a splash? 1/4 tsp?  1/2tsp?  I may have "splashed" a little too much lemon juice because I felt the need to add a few grains of sugar.  However, I enjoyed this dressing and would make it again.
