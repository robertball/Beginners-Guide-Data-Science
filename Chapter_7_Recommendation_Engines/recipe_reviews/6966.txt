I don't ususally bake.  Therefore,  I was mortified when my gourmet club gave me the task of making soft prestzels for our German meal.  They were fun and easy to make.  I have become the "pretzel Queen"!  They tasted GREAT and I got so MANY compliments.  I served them with honey mustard dressing and that was a hit.  

In less than a week I am making them again.

Thank you for sharing your recipe Anne!

These pretzels taste wonderful, however I had a difficult time twisting them into the classic pretzel shape.  Also, I think using whole egg yolk, instead of just egg white, for brushing on top would give them a shinier appearance.

These pretzels expanded to about three times their original size and didn't taste like pretzels.  It was more like a heavy bread dough.  I don't recommend this recipe (the Soft Pretzel I recipe is better).

This recipe is delicious! I brushed them with olive oil instead of the egg, It made them more shiny, and the salt on top stuck better. My family LOVES these!

Bakes up soft. My 12 year old son made these and they were great. We used sea salt for the outside of the pretzels before baking.

this recipe was frusterating. First the dough was too dry and I had to add in some extra water for it to be workable. After letting it rise the dough was sticky. and when I baked them they stuck to the pan. I've made soft pretzels several times before, but it was my first time using this recipe. I would not use it again.

It was good for me to do since it was my first time using yeast! Instead of putting kosher salt on it, I coated mines with cinnamon-sugar. My family loved them.

These turned out hard and tasteless.  I suppose from all the good reviews it may have been human error, but I followed the recipe and am usually a decent baker so it was disappointing.

My little girl and her friend had a blast making these.  The did rise a lot, so maybe we need to make them thinner next time, but they taste very good.

As I am someone originally from Philadelphia, the home of the soft pretzel.  I can tell you that these are so easy to make and they are delicious.  I didn't do the seeds but I will next time.  Now I am going to be making these for every family function.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

On their own as pretzels, they are simple and only ok... a little too breaddy for my quench of soft pretzel... However,if you take 4 links of spicy Italian sausage, quarter them and roll them out into long thin links (half-way brown them and let them cool to room temp), then wrap the dough around the links (tightly), let rise for 5 minutes (long enough to dissolve 1/2 cup baking soda into 4 cups of (really) hot (nearly boiling) water), dip, turn and replace onto baking sheet, sprinkle sesame seeds on them, bake them for the regular time at the regular temp. You end up with a pretzley piggie-in-a-blanket on steroids of awesome.

We loved it, but you wanna make sure you roll the ropes into 1/2 inch like it says or they will be big puffy pretzels and make sure you check them at about 12 minutes.  15 minutes to bake made our first batch too hard!  DELICIOSO!

I love this recipe! These pretzels are soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside! This dough was also perfect for bagels i just shaped them into balls, poked a hole in the middle, and then tossed them into boiling water one at a time until they flared to the top.  They came out perfect and so Yummy!

These are AMAZING!  I did make minor adjustments after reading all of the reviews.  I only used 4 C of flour and 1 packet (1/4 oz) of yeast.  I slowly drizzled in a bit more water than called for so the dough was the right consistency.  I made pretzel bites so there would be plenty to go around.  I agree that the temp was a bit high and dropped mine to 400.  Don’t hesitate making; fairly easy and really yummy

These were so good. I made little pretzel balls. And I added basil, oregano, garlic powder and some dry mustard and they tasted just like focaccia bread. And I made a cheesy dipping sauce to go with it.

It worked really well.  Was easy and tasted great, grandkids loved them.  I changed the baking time to 12 min to keep from getting too firm.  Will definitely make more, especially with cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top.

This salted pretzel came out better than my local mall's pretzel. I also tried another set by adding cinnamon and raisins.

I thought these pretzels were pretty good although they did not rise as much as they were supposed to so were a little dense but still good i made a herb abd cheese dip to go with them and they make a good pair. I have not used yeast very much but found this dough pretty easy to work with it seems too stiff at first and is hard to knead but once you work with it about 5 min it starts to soften up. Over all i really liked these and will probably make them again

Though my pretzels never look as good as the picture, these are a great snack for everyone! I melt butter and garlic for a great addition - have also topped with parmesean cheese!
