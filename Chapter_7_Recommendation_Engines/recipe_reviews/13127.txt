Like another reviewer, I omitted the tomato juice since I was using my slow cooker and I like a thicker chili.  Other than that, I followed this recipe.  I cooked it on low for 9 hours.  The flavor was excellent, especially for such a simple recipe.  I was very pleased with the results and will definitely make again.  This would be an easy recipe to tweak to your personal taste.  This made 4 VERY generous servings -- probably more like 5.

*****ETA: Several years later, I'm still making this chili, but I've made a couple additional changes (beside omitting the tomato juice) to make it even thicker.  Now I use an extra  1/2 lb of ground beef and instead of using 15 oz of tomato sauce, I use 8 oz of tomato sauce and 6 oz of tomato paste.  This chili is good the first night, but the leftovers are GREAT.

This is a yummy and easy recipe. I made it at a work potluck and everyone loved it. It tasted better the longer it stays in the crockpot.

Best Ever! I made this for a football party last weekend. I was totally bummed because there wasn't any left over! I used only 1 can of beans & V8 for the tomato juice. My husband wanted it a bit spicier so next time I might try the "hot" chili seasoning. The green chili's added superb flavor this was the best chili I ever tasted. My mother in law thought so too!

I gave this 4 stars since I tweaked it some and it wasn't the original recipe. We like a thicker chili and not TOO spicy because of the kids. Here's what I did: 1 lb. ground beef 1 can dark kidney beans (undrained) 1 can MANWICH sauce 1 pkg chili seasoning mix Salt; pepper; garlic powder; minced onion Brown the ground beef with salt pepper garlic powder and minced onion to taste. Layer kidney beans ground beef chili seasoning and MANWICH sauce in crockpot. Give it a stir to blend all ingredients and set on LOW for about 5 hrs. (Just long enough for flavors to blend and heat through). I served it with Pillsbury Garlic Butter flavor rolls. Even my kids thought it was good and not TOO spicy!!

This is a great recipe. I omitted the tomato juice and added a bottle of beer instead because we like the beer flavor and instead of chile spice I just used crushed red pepper and chili powder. Delicious! Served with fried bread for dipping.. Perfect for a cold day!

This is basicly the way I make it. I use 1lg. onion chopped about 3 stalks of celery chopped 3 pds. ground beef. 2 cans- 1 each dark red kidney beans and light red kidney beans rinsed and drained. Also one can of chili beans. Not drained. You can throw diced peppers in it to with your onion and celery. I do if I have them. Then whole tomatoes diced tomatoes tomatoe soup tomatoe juice. Whatever you have tomatoey. If you like it hot put some hot pepper flakes in it. I serve those on the side husband likes it hot children do not.Also my husband likes elbow macaroni in his chili. It doesn't bother me so I do it. Make it in a Dutch oven. If it dosen't look like enough and some water with some more spices you like. You can also scale it down for a smaller version.

Yeah! I have finally found a chili recipe that is super simple to prepare and tastes great! I followed the recipe with a couple of minor adjustments. I used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef (instead of 2 pounds - I like a soupier chili). I used 1 can dark and 1 can light kidney beans undrained (instead of the chili beans b/c that's what I had on hand). I didn't use the 10 oz can of tomatoes w/green chili peppers (forgot it). And used 2 packages of chili seasoning mix (instead of 1 package). This tasted great and I will definitely make this chili again!

I loved this recipe so easy. It wasn't quite hot enough for my husband (although it was plenty spicy for me). Next time I'll spice it up more with another can of HOT green chile peppers or some red pepper flakes or even some cayenne pepper... I'll keep this one!

I cooked mine in the slow cooker. I don't like to add the beans until the last hour to keep them from turning to mush. I used beef broth instead of tomato juice and also added cumin because the chili seasoning pkg. didn't have enough cumin taste for us. When ground meat was thawed I just cooked drained and added it to the pot. Served with rolled flour tortillas filled with melted grated cheese.

Yummy!!!! Leave the cover off the crockpot because there is not an inch at the top to spare therefore it spilled over. The can sizes (ozs.) were different from what I had therefore I used only 6 oz tomato juice to: 2 lbs ground beef 1 large onion chopped 2 (15.5 oz) cans chili beans 2 (8oz) cans tomato sauce 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes w/grn.chili peppers 1 (14.5 oz) can peeled & diced tomatoes 1 (4 oz) can diced green chilis 1 (1.25 oz) pkg dry chili seasoning mix

This recipe was great. I have been searching for a GOOD chili recipe without alot of chunky tomatoes- since my husband dosen't like them.....so I did this recipe with a few slight changes- I put the diced tomatoes and green chilies in the mini food processor first; Also did not use the tomato juice; Added fresh garlic to the meat as cooking; substituted some Tomatoe puree for the can of diced tomatoes.....cooked on low in crockpot for 2and 1/2 hours-DELICIOUS!

I thought this was great super easy and the kids enjoyed it too. Since I didn't have the tomato juice I substitute 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and left out the tomato sauce to compensate. Definitely a keeper!

Really good! I followed the recipe exactly except added a little extra hamburger and a little less tomato juice. I served it over some elbow macaroni and it was excellent!

The picture shows macaroni noodles yet the recipe doesn't list any. I'm confused. I want kind of a chili mac dish and it doesn't say when or how to add the noodles.
