Everytime I make pancakes I use the Bisquick Melt in Your Mouth Supreme instructions. (Stir in 2 Tbsp Sugar, 2 tsp. Baking Powder and 1 tsp. Vanilla). Then we let the creativity loose!  One time we add a mashed banana, some chopped walnuts and some mini chocolate chips!  The next time we add a mashed mango and some blueberries!  Everytime they are delicious! We make enough to have some leftover so the kids can take them in a Tupperware container in their lunches for school. This is a quick, easy and economical way to make a healthy and yummy breakfast (or lunch, or dinner!) Eat up!

Bisquick has a blurb on the back of the box under the original recipe for "melt in your mouth" pancakes. It calls for baking powder, lemon juice and vanilla. It truly makes the fluffiest pancakes ever!

I'm with LINDA MCLEAN on this... If you absolutely MUST use Bisquick to make pancakes, the only way to do it is the "MELT IN YOUR MOUTH" way.

OK, so I am usually one of those people who will make any sort of baked goods from scratch and avoid using a mix as often as possible. BUT. I grew up eating Bisquik pancakes. That's what my Mom made and that's ALL that tastes right to me now! Pancake batter doesn't need sugar as far as I'm concerned, that's what syrup and jam are for! And the texture is just right, fluffy but not like a sponge. I wish I had some pancakes right now....

I am trying to pull some frozen breakfasts together for my mother in law quickly before we go on vacation. (She does not cook. Like, ever.) I agree with those reviewers that say making it the "melt-in-your-mouth" way is the only way to go. I used the Walmart off-brand pancake mix this way and they turned out perfect. And in a matter of minutes. These will be frozen in portion sizes for my children so all my mother in law has to do is stick them in the microwave or toaster. Wa-la, no cooking for her. Crisis averted.

UPDATE: Apparently there are a lot of versions of "Melt-in-your-Mouth."  I found one that (in addition to this recipe) incorporates 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tsp baking powder.  Maybe the added acidity did something, but this version with the lemon juice was much better and the pancakes were not as thick.  If I use Bisquick, this will be the version I use from now on!
ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have made the pancakes this way and with the Melt-in-your-Mouth version (by ANISSA925).  The one above is somewhat plain, but with some things thrown in (ie berries) much improved.  The Melt-in-your-Mouth version is a bit too thick for me.

I used the lowfat baking mix and it turned out just fine.  I did add a little more milk to thin the pancakes out, but that's probably just a personal preference.

As previously suggested, I added 2 tbs sugar, 2 tbs baking powder, and 1 tbs vanilla.  They only thing I did differently was beat the egg whites separately, then folded into the batter.  Delicious!

This is a good recipe but I like the "melt in your mouth" version better. They are lighter and have better flavor.

How people managed a 1-star recipe out of this, I have no idea. This is basic and foolproof. So many variations, so easy to do. I keep Bisquick around SOLELY for pancakes as it's the only way my husband will make them for me! I have experimented with hundreds of pancake recipes over the years, and for the flavor yield you get back from how LITTLE effort is required, you can't beat these. We like them with chocolate (or other flavor) chips or berries cooked inside!

I had put my Bisquick in a Tupperware container, and lost the instructions. I'm glad I found this "starting point" recipe. As-is, it was too thick, so I had to add more milk. The pancakes themselves were just not sweet enough, and a little too dense for our liking.

These are great for a fast and easy breakfast. I'm venturing into homemade pancake recipes so I hope 1 will be better than this recipe.

I disagree with the other rater. I think they do not taste wonderful. I have tried a few variations and they all leave a bitter taste in the back of my mouth. There are many better recipes out there that are not much more difficult.
