I used Seagrams Seven Dark Honey whiskey and diet Sierra Mist soda. I made no other changes. VERY good. Lynchburg Lemonade is one of my favorite cocktails--the honey whiskey made it even better!

Wow this is crisp and refreshing - a perfect drink for those hot summer nights! It's like lemonade with a bit of a kick. This recipe is a spot on so if you're a fan of Jack Daniel's give this a try. You won't be disappointed. I would definitely shake vs. stir. Just garnish with a slice of lemon and add a straw. But, be careful because these go down easy...

One of my favorite summer time drinks.  I add lemon slices into the pitcher and glass and a maraschino cherry or two.  When I want it a little sweeter I add some of the cherry juice!

a great drink, but I highly suggest SHAKING instead of stirring. it tastes so much better because the ingredients are more thoroughly mixed than if stirred. also adds to the overall "lemonade" effect

This was pretty good. I couldn't fit all of the soda in my glass, so it was a little strong. I used top shelf whiskey and subbed zero calorie lemonade for the sweet and sour mix.

This is such a great Summer time cocktail.  The only change I made was to use Cointreau in place of triple sec (same thing really, just more proof).

Had this on a camping trip where we did a round robin. the lemonade is awesome of its own, but if you add raspberry ice tea it takes it to a whole new level.

No changes, except I backed off on the triple sec, just about half, PS it's not LYNCHBURG lemonade with Seagrams

Jack Daniels used to sell this in a six pack, looked all over and couldn't find it anymore. This is it, exactly as I remember. Big thanks for the recipe!
