Overall: 4 stars as written, 5 stars (and lactose free!) when made to taste

The ingredient count did not yield enough topping/bottom crust to impress me. It seemed chintzy almost. 

REVISIONS: 
-I doubled the mix, substituting 1-2 tablespoons of honey for some of the sugar (makes that 'fried' ice cream taste)
-Added 1/2 t cinnamon, nutmeg
-Added 1/2 cup crushed pecans (also key to the fried ice cream taste)
- Added chocolate chips

RESULT: The dessert was DELICIOUS and everyone loved it. I used Lactose Free Breyers vanilla because it is a bit softer but tastes exactly the same. The softness allowed me to cut these much more quickly and for the littlest kids to be able to bit into these without have them melt.
Give it a try- you won't be disappointed!

A family favorite!!!
If you like the 'fried ice cream' served at Mexican restaurants, you'll like this.  No, you'll love it and won't be able to stop eating it!!
I increased the amount of rice cereal/brown sugar/etc. topping, because that is my family's favorite part.  I also added cinnamon to that mix and it was even better.  
Finally, we have tried it with homemade caramel sauce on top, honey drizzled over top, and even chocolate fudge sauce.  All great ways to make the dessert even more decadent.
