I made this EXACTLY as listed and give it 5 stars. If I had made any changes, I could not give it any stars since it would not longer be the recipe at hand. I don't understand you people. You decide to try a recipe but make an inordinate amount of changes to it FIRST, then rate it. Aren't you just rating your own version of this recipe? Why don't you people just follow the original recipe, rate it, then make the recipe again with your changes. Is there no honestly around at all that so many would rate highly a recipe, no less, that they have changed and personalized?

This was a VERY good enchilada casserole!  Definitley a keeper for me!  As other reviewers, I eliminated the first 3 ingredients and simply purchased red enchilada sauce at the store.  Also, instead of the can of refried beans I used a can of black beans, drained but not rinsed.
For the beef mixture I added cumin and chili powder, as well as part of an envelope of taco seasoning.  At the end before I put the last layer of cheese on I poured about 1/2 a cup of enchilada sauce over the top.  I also used more cheese than called for, and used the 4 cheese mexican blend.
Makes a TON of food, but I'm looking forward to leftovers tonight!!!
UPDATE:  Sept. 2008 - I love this recipe!  What I do now is brown the pound and a half of beef (90/10 sirloin), drain MOST of the grease, and add one package of taco seasoning (I like McCormicks) and whatever amt of water it calls for.  Cook this for a few minutes and then add a can of diced green chiles, a can of drained black beans, and a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  Cook this all together for a few more minutes, and theen layer with LOTS of cheese, and the tortillas dipped in the sauce.  Top with EXTRA sauce, and lots of cheese!
Also, when I make this I make it in TWO square glass dishes, and put one in the freezer.
Serve this topped with some chopped romaine lettuce, fresh pico de gallo, and sour cream.

My whole family loved this casserole. I made some changes that were suggested and they were right. I baked the tortillas for about 5 minutes to get them crunchy and I was glad I did and I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce instead of the packet seasoning, I might use 3 next time and I used double the amount of cheese. Next time I make this dish I am going to use green chiles and diced tomatoes, and maybe even some olives. Great recipe.

I have made this twice now with a few changes. I used the premade can enchilada sauce instead of a packet mix. Instead of adding the onion and garlic spices to the hamburger I added some taco seasoning. Turned out great and the reheated leftover tasted just as good. I will be making this one alot! Be sure to spray your pan with a nonstick spray, helps with the cleanup.

This was a quick, easy dinner. I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan - and that made two big dinner servings for me and the boyfriend, with two nice-sized lunch portions leftover! A few modifications: 1) browned the ground beef with 1/2 diced onion, a 4oz can of green chiles (drained), lots of chili powder, cumin, and garlic salt. I used about nine corn tortillas (just tear them to make them fit into the pan) and did not "brown" them as others suggested - enchiladas are not crispy, so I didn't see any reason to crisp up the tortillas. I layered as suggested, but used a total of 2 cups of pepperjack cheese (so, double the cheese called for since I cut the recipe in half). Also, I had to bake it for 30 minutes to get it hot all the way through - 20 minutes wasn't enough. The only change I will make next time is to add more enchilada sauce - I did pour some over the top of the casserole, but there should be a layer in the middle as well for extra flavor and moisture. Overall, a tasty and easy recipe!!

I took the advice of several other reviewers and made mine using 2lbs of extra lean ground beef, jar of medium enchilada sauce. I added 1/2 c chopped onions, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp chili powder to meat after browning. Added a lot more cheese. Topped with extra cheese and sliced black olives. Served with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced jalapenos, and chopped onions. 

Very good, the whole family liked it.

This recipe has good structure but I found it needed more texture. I made a few adjustments by adding 1/2lb more meat,a little more sauce,green and white onion, black olives and diced bell pepper for flavor and color through-out. Tweek this to your personal taste and you've go a winner!

This was absolutely wonderful!  My grocery store doesn't sell the dry packet of enchilada sauce so I used one can.  The only other thing that I did differently was use flour tortillas since I'm not a big fan of the corn tortillas.  It was delicious.  Next time I think that I will serve it with lettuce, tomato and salsa to serve on top.

This was very good! I also used canned enchilada sauce instead of powdered, and put taco seasoning in the hamburger. Instead of layering the tortillas I filled them with meat and rolled them. I then covered with green chiles, olives, red sauce, and cheese on the top. For the last 5 minutes I uncovered so the cheese would be bubbly like it's served in the restaraunt. I served with spanish rice and sour cream. My family loved it!

A favorite of mine. I can remember my Mom making this when I was a kid. It isn't "authentic" or anything fancy, just comforting food. I usually add a can of drained kidney beans and sliced black olives to the layers for a little more flavor and texture.

I did this recipe and was very pleased with it just as it was written.  I may make some slight changes to suit my own compression ratio but that's what we all do. I have to agree with CatGoverness when she writes about people should not rate the recipe after they decided to make their own changes first. Do it as written, then rate it. Then modify it.

We all loved this but I tweaked it a little bit after reading some of the reviews.  Here are the changes I made that made it PERFECT: I browned the ground beef (I used about 2.5 lbs)and used a packet of taco seasoning, along with the garlic salt and onion powder.   I sauteed half a white onion (diced), as well as a can of drained sweet corn, and added that to the meat.  I mixed it with a can and a half of refried beans. Instead of the tomato paste mixture, I just added a large can of enchilada sauce to the meat.  I took another large can, and reserved half of it to dip in tortillas and the other half to top over entire casserole.   Also, I used quite a bit more cheese than it called for (we loooove cheese in our family). It came out great!!!  The corn and onions added the extra flavor and crunch!  Topped it with a dollop of sour cream and it was amazing!

Normally, if I change something, I will not post a review, but this time, it was only because I had already put chicken breasts into the crockpot, figuring I would find SOMETHING to do with them, after work!!  I did--this recipe!  So, all I did was switch the (shredded) chicken for the ground beef; next time, I will try it with the beef.  Anyway, TO DIE FOR!  My pickeiest eater went back for THIRDS!

Great dish!  I think this could easily be adapted to whatever you have on hand.  I had to make a few changes but it still came out delicious and the whole family enjoyed it.  I love dishes like this, thanks for sharing.

Great recipe - very, very kid-friendly.  The only thing that makes it a little bit easier is to use canned enchilada sauce, rather than mixing up your own.  I did the recipe both ways, and found it was easier to skip that one step.  You tend to need at least 3 cans (10 oz) of the sauce as it is very thin.

This was an excellent recipe … thoroughly enjoyable.  As others had suggested, I used pre-made enchilada sauce.  For the ground beef mixture, I upped the ground beef to 2 lbs., replaced the garlic salt and onion powder with 2 packages of taco seasoning, added 2/3 cup water, the ½ cup of enchilada sauce, used 1 can drained black beans instead of the refried beans and added about 1/8 tsp. of ground cumin.  I also doubled the amount of cheese.

My family said to make this casserole again so I did!  I used a large can of enchilada sauce instead of dry packet and I added about 1/3 cup frozen corn to the bottom layer.  One more note, I made two of these ahead of time and froze them and they tasted great!

This is a football season favorite to have when friends stop by.  I add chopped black olives to the mixture, and top it off with a dollop of homemade guacamole.  Simple and delicious.

I make this recipe a lot. I add green chiles and a little jalapeno to the meat. I also use enchilada sauce instead of the tomato paste mixture. The first few times I used the tomato paste mix, but the enchilada sauce is easier and more flavorful. This is my husband's favorite of all my meals and he asks for it all the time.

I used about 1 1/4 lbs ground beef, browned, added taco seasoning, 1/2 can diced tomatoes and about 3/4 cup Pace Picante sauce and 1 can refried beans and 1/2 of a very large onion put in late so it would stay somewhat crispy for the meat.  I had 6 1/4" corn tortillas.  I used 1 can Old El Paso Mild Enchilada Sauce.  Used my deep white pyrex dish and 1 1/2 of the tortillas covered the bottom.  I did 3 layers of the tortillas each dipped in sauce before I did the first layer of meat (so 4 1/2 tortillas covered the bottom, then I used 1/4 of the meat, then 1 cup cheese, then 4 1/2 more tortillas (making 3 layers of tortilla) 1/4 of the meat 1 more cup cheese.  Then I just did 3 tortillas (making 2 layers of tortilla) and poured the rest of the can of sauce over and then another cup of cheese.  Next time use a full can of refried beans and maybe a little more salsa?

This is a great recipe!  You can make this with whatever you have on hand.  I generally omit the enchilada sauce and beans (serve it on the side for those who want to add it)and tomato paste (doesn't need it) due to preference in my house; I usually cook 1-2 lbs of ground beef and one small onion, then mix in taco seasoning as per package directions.  I make a cup of Minute Rice and add it to my hamburger mixture.  Rice is so great in this!  It also bulks up the hamburger mixture and extends it out a bit for more layers.  I layer mixture on bottom, cheese, tortillas (flour in our house--yes I know it's no longer an enchilada--its now a burrito) then repeat.  Top layer gets an extra handful of cheesy goodness!  Cover with foil, heat through and serve with black olives, salsa, enchilada sauce, guacamole, sour cream....endless possibilities!

I used mild salsa instead of the enchilada sauce.  Dipped tortillas in the salsa and added 1 cup to meat with 1 can black beans and 1 can corn instead of refried beans, also added 1 tbsp minced garlic and pepper instead of garlic and onion powder.  Drizzled fat free yogurt over cheese in the casserole to make creamier.  Big hit with my family. Large casserole so leftovers for lunch!

I was craving Mexican Food but didn't want to run to the store- I had everything for this recipe except refried beans. I used black beans instead and I think it turned out just fine! I will make this recipe again as written with refried beans next time. Overall a quick and easy recipe and the household liked it, but no one RAVED about it.

Great recipe.  I used the canned enchilada sauce instead of the mix, tomato paste and water.  I also used black beans instead of refried, and they were really good in the casserole. I had some trouble with the tortillas, and you may need more enchilada sauce if you're dipping them completely in there, but overall the outcome was deliciousss!

This was great and so easy! I scaled it down halfway and it was still a ton of food. Added a can of green chiles to the beef and used a packet of taco seasoning instead of the spices and onion. Buy the canned enchilada sauce. Followed the advice of others and put the tortillas in the oven to make them crispier.

Good enough to make again.  A few recommended changes/additions:  use two cans of enchilda sauce instead of dry mix, water and tomato paste - the dish needs the extra to put some moistness in it.  I used 1 lb. ground chuck (used the recipes garlic salt but went with 1 small chopped onion and added two chopped jalapenos), 1 can black beans (drained) and 1 can refried beans.  I also added 4 oz. of chopped black olives to the meat/bean mixture before layering.  I baked the casserole covered for 15 minutes and uncovered for an additional 10 minutes.  Served with spanish rice and garnished with guacamole and sour cream.  Rating is based on base recipe.

Love this recipe. After reading the reviews, I knew it would be a good one to add to my recipe box. I choose recipes that can be modified according to what I have on hand without losing the integrity of the dish. Many reviewers suggested crisping the tortillas, so I used tortilla chips to save time. I didn't have refried beans, so I used Ranch Style Jalapeno Beans instead. I also sautéed a diced medium onion then added the meat and taco seasoning. Next I added the enchilada sauce as instructed and a small can of diced green chilies. The dish turned out superb. If I'd followed the recipe exactly, it would still get a big thumbs up!

This was a huge success!  I did add about a cup more of water to the sauce mixture because it was really thick.  It came out great and my husband who's a picky eater loved it!

I minced half an onion, half a green bell pepper and half of a red bell pepper and sauteed that in olive oil. I only had 1 lb. of ground beef 
(I think 1 1/4 would have been great). I seasoned that with freshly ground pepper and garlic powder and browned. Added ground cumin and chili powder once meat was browned and drained. Tastes great with reduced fat Mexican blend cheese, canned Las Palmas enchilada sauce (mild-I had that on hand so I used that instead of preparing sauce according to recipe), and fat free refried beans. Serve with light sour cream. I also used homemade corn tortillas. I found an easy recipe on Pinterest that I made the day before. Overall, this recipe was easy, healthy and very tasty!

Used  can of red enchilada sauce, rather than dry pkg mix, added can of green chilies, some cumin, and cilantro, as we like these flavors in our enchiladas. Seemed a 4 star for me, because of the refried beans texture, but that's a personal taste thing, and the rest of the family really liked it. Thanks!

Did add more seasoning (cumin, dried onions, cayenne pepper) Substituted Kruner brand black beans with cumin for refried beans; used canned enchelada sauce.  Used 2lb shredded mexican cheese and made 2-9x9 pans (cooked one and froze one).  First time in a very long time that everyone in family ate and asked for seconds.

I used a family members homemade enchilada sauce recipe instead of the dry package one--that was a lot of work, so next time I'll probably buy a jar.  My husband love it with the refried beans.  I also added half a diced yellow onion, a jalapeno pepper, small amount of minced garlic, and diced black olives.  I served it with guacamole chips and fat free sour cream on top!

My family did not like this.  After dinner when I try a new recipe we "rate it" on a scale from 1-10, it got a 3.  Everyone agreed it was flavorless.  I did what another reviewer suggested and changed out enchilada sauce mix for a can of enchilada sauce.  Maybe that was the problem??  And I added sliced black olives.  I won't be making this one again and I am not sure what I will do with the leftovers.

This was SOOOOO easy to make and tasted deeeelish!  Had a bit of a 'kick' to it since I used the mild enchilada sauce in place of the first 3 ingredients as recommended by others.  Easy to 'tame' with sour cream and other fixin's.  I made this for my family of three and had leftovers for another 1 1/2 meals...Very filling too...thumbs up!

THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!! I've made it probably 4 times since I snagged the recipe a couple of months ago. Try adding a little (I use a couple of tablespoons worth) salsa/cheese dip to your mixture. It makes it creamy!! ... YUM!!!

This is easy and yummy.  I added two pounds of ground beef and used two packages of taco seasoning, because that is all I had on hand.  I added extra garlic salt and onion powder.  I added two cups of fried onion rings on the top before I added the last bit of cheese.  It was a hit in our home!

This is a good base recipe.  I think the next time I will not add the refried beans to the meat, maybe it will be a little more stable if they were added as a separate layer.  I also sauteed onions, green peppers and minced garlic then added the meat to that mixture and used taco seasoning.  I served this with pico de gallo, good thing I did.  I think that saved the dish.  Nontheless, thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was just ok.... I only had canned enchilada sauce and followed the rest of the directions with the exception of adding fresh diced onion and fresh minced garlic to the ground beef. I layered the ingredients as directed, but after it was cooked and cooled for about 10 minutes, it ended up being a huge blobby mess! If I make this again, I would double layer the tortillas to make it more "layered".

This is yummy, hubby loved it.  You need twice the sauce, so next time I may just use a can of sauce.  Other than that the perfect quick, cheap, and easy family meal.

This turned out very well, though I did make alterations to the original recipe (per others' suggestions). I used 1.2 lbs. of ground sirloin (added a packet of taco seasoning after browning), a large can of enchilada sauce (skipping making my own mix), a can of black beans instead of refried beans (drained, unrinsed), and also added a can of Rotel tomatoes and green chiles. The cheeses I went with were sharp cheddar and a Mexican blend, using almost 3-4 cups total. This needed to cook for 30 minutes at 375 to warm throughout. The taste was great, and even my partner enjoyed it. I served this meal alongside freshly diced roma tomatoes, avocado, and sour cream. His primary complaint was the sogginess of the corn tortillas, and he suggested in the future omitting them entirely and instead serving this meat/bean/cheese mixture over tortilla chips.

Made as directions listed and said to do. Not anything I'd make again. Noticed that most pictures for this recipe have added ingredients. Very dry as is. So use this as a base and add to your liking within the layers. My family thought this to be very  dry. If I was to make this again, I'd use onions while browning the meat and either salsa or taco sauce to the enchilada sauce mix. To me, the tomato paste and water was not enough.

This recipe was boyfriend-approved.  I will definitely be making it again.

Some alterations I made: canned enchilada sauce instead of dry.  sauteed the ground beef with taco seasoning, then added diced red pepper, green pepper, and onions.  Also added canned corned to the beef.  The additional ingredients in the pan lent great flavor and color.

Also, this is one of those dishes that taste better a day later.  Preparing the dish at least several hours before serving is probably best.

¡Muy delicioso!  I couldn't find the powdered enchilada sauce mix so I used to cans of the premade stuff (one mild, one medium).  I also substituted whole black beans for the refried beans to cut down on the lard -- my husband LOVED it!

Very tasty and easy.  I  have benn making a version of this casserole for many years and the best thing is you can change it up and add/take away ingredients to your liking.  We enjoy sour cream and salsa on top.

Omg, so deelish, and I've had lots of different recipes.  In the layers, I added a layer of whole green chilis, that I sliced open so they layed out flat.  I also used 2 lbs of ground beef and mixed in a taco seasoning packet before adding the beans.  It was to die for!

I loved this recipe! I took it with to a potluck and it was a huge hit. I used fat free beans, low fat cheese and low fat tortillas but no one even noticed. I agree it could use a little more meat mixture in it though and I think it's really wonderful if you use the black beans with a hint of lime in them.

Very good recipe.  Even my picky nephew liked this.  Used fat free beans to cut down on the fat and couldn't tell any difference.  Chopped up a few green chiles and added between the layers.  There didn't seem to be enough meat mixture so next time I will take into account some of the other reviewers suggestions.  Will try to bake the tortillas next time...

This was awesome!! I made it for my boyfriend and he couldn't get enough of it! I took some other peoples advice and seasoned the meat with taco seasoning. Made it super tasty! I also used canned enchilada sauce (Get 2 cans!! You will want it!!) I sauteed mushrooms with the meat and then stirred diced tomatoes and black olives into the meat mixture right before layering it in the casserole dish. It gave it a nice texture and some extra flavor. I didn't try the original recipe before playing with it but I certainly give this one 5 stars with a few "tweaks"!! :)

this turned out very good.  I made spanish rice and placed in bottom of a 9x13 then followed this recipe layering on top of the rice. It made a huge 1 dish dinner that everyone gobbled up.

Tasty gets 4 stars, .. BUT... enchilada sauce definitely needs doubling (ran out and had to send someone to the store, delaying dinner with other "timed" dishes I planned to serve this with). Would be easier to buy a couple of large jars of enchilada sauce and call it a day. Also, there is confusion on the cook time per recipe as printed. Header says cook time is 35 minutes, instructions say cook 20 minutes then let sit for 5. 15 minutes can be a BIG difference in many dishes. Split the difference and cooked for 30 minutes. Rated 3 stars for recipe inconsistencies.

Absolutely mouthwatering delicious.  My picky 6 yr old even loved it.  I used shredded chicken instead of beef only because we had beef the night before.  I also used the canned enchilada sauce as other reviews had mentioned.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys mexican, and if you don't, I would give it a try anyway.

This is a very "white" style enchilada casserole. I used black beans instead of refried, canned enchilada sauce and I used the taco cheese mix. I tasted ok, but I wouldn't make it again.

This was very tasty.  I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce instead of the first three ingredients.  I also used black beans instead of refried beans.  I used a can of green chilies and a can of sliced black olives.  I also used a lot more cheese than the recipe calls for.  Very good.

This enchilada casserole was very good and we have had it several times already.  The first time I made it exactly as written and there was not enough sauce at all.  The subsequent time I made it I used a 28 oz. can of enchilada sauce instead and there was much more to spread around and so it was not so dry at all and very tasty.

Awesome casserole.  I too, like many others used the canned enchilada sause.  I was afraid of using to much as my 4 year old was going to be eating this too.  And didn't want it to be to spicy for him.  So I just slapped on extra sour cream on his.  I also tried it with ground Turkey instead of beef. Even reheated this is good.  Definately a keeper!

Excellent, easy recipe.  The only thing I would change is to double the sauce recipe because it didn't seem to be enough and the casserole was a little dry.  Doubling the sauce recipe should fix that.

I made this for Cinco de Mayo and it was a hit at our house. I used canned enchilada sauce as many others have suggested; about 2 1/2 cans and I also used Krafts Cheddar Jack shredded cheese which has Jalapenos. I did bake the tortillas for about 5 mintues and it all came out perfect. Leftovers reheat very well too. I served this with mexican rice.

I took this to a friend who just had a baby and she really liked it.  I thought it was a little sweet for my taste.  I will make again, but I will use more seasoning in the meat like chili powder, ciliantro and diced tomatoes. I also think it would be great to add pepper jack chesse instead for Monterey and a side of lime for some extra zest.  Thanks for the idea!

This is a great recipe! I make it quite frequently and it is always a hit; sometimes I substitute shredded chicken in place of the ground beef. Also, I serve it topped with sour cream and sprinkled with green onions and black olives. Delicious!

We all love enchiladas, but time is always an issue.  This is an excellent alternative.  What I do is take a bag of tortilla chips *flavored or not*, crumble them into bite size pieces and then layer it.  My meat/onion is seasoned with half of the sauce before I add the refried beans. I add the remaining of the sauce on top, cheese and onion. I tend to make the chip layer thick so that there's some crunch to it.  You can also use turkey, pork, venision....instead of ground chuck/beef.

This was good Kathy and even hubby, who likes but doesn't love Mexican gobbled this up. I made my own enchilada sauce from this site and to avoid soggy tortillas, I crisped them up in the oven prior to assembling. Used ground turkey with this recipe and fat free refried beans. Healthful and delicious. Thanks!

I used canned enchilada sauce, easier, and took the advice of previous reviews and added black olives between layers.  Very good. Everyone liked it and froze leftovers, which freezes well.

I used tomato sauce with the enchilada powder dry mix, and layered with refried beans, mild green chilies, onions and olives.  It was really great.  I would make it again, definitely!

I added a can of Rotel tomatoes to make it spicier. I also didn't have the dry enchilada sauce mix. I just eliminated the water/mix and replaced it with a can of enchilada sauce. The whole family loved it.

I used a can of chili beans in place of the refried, and added 1 cup frozen corn to that layer.  I ended up using more jack cheese than the recipe called for, and we thoroughly enjoyed the casserole. It seems the dish can be adapted to suit many tastes.

This is a recipe the entire family enjoyed.  My son (who, given the choice, would subsist on instant mashed potatoes and ramen noodles) has requested this dish on several occasions.  Leftovers don't last more than a day unless we double the recipe!  We made it as written the first time, but due to my husbands aversion to red meat, subsequent meals have been prepared with turkey instead of beef. Both preparations have been very enjoyable with a side salad and some Mexican style corn.  

Yes, we'll continue having this casserole again and again!

Delish! My husband loved it and we have plenty for seconds.  I think I might try adding corn the next time and see what happens.  I also used ground turkey instead of the beef, and added a beef bullion to give it a beefy flavor.  I also used the Taco seasoning from one of the reviews and used black beans.  I will also be adding more tortillas next time.  I only added one per layer, I think I had to put more.  But thank you for the recipe!  A keeper.

Not too bad, I made alterations; hint of lime white chips broken on the bottom, hominy sub. for corn, taco sauce instead of tomato paste and on the top layer I added jalapeno slices before the cheese topping. I tend to work with what I have on hand.
Excellent & Spicy!

I used a can of Old El Paso enchilada sauce, instead of the dry mix and it tastes a lot better. I only used half a can of refried beans, since I don't like a lot of beans. I also added a small can of green chilies and a small can of chopped black olives to the meat mixture and used taco (seasoned) cheese and cheddar cheese instead. It was delicious and I'll definitely make this recipe again!

I rated this 5 stars because of the easiness to prepare and the taste.  I had a lot of leftover taco meat in the freezer from a party and couldn't decide what to make for dinner.  I came across this recipe and decided to try it, although I don't make casseroles very often.  I did substitute the dry enchilada mix and tomato paste for canned enchilada mix.  I didn't use the spices, since the meat was already seasonsed.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone liked it, even the picky kids.  This is great to throw together when you are short on time, yet very filling also.  Having the taco meat already prepared did help immensely with the time.  I will definitely add this one to my recipe book.

Followed as directed but with 2 cans enchilada sauce instead of the mix. I also added chopped onion to the meat mix and on top after baking. Loved it! Will make again using the enchilada sauce recommended just because it sounds good

This was fantastic! I have a very picky three year old who is experiencing "dinner boot camp" where he must eat two bites of everything on his plate. He asked for seconds and thirds!!!! I even made this with fat free retfried beans and reduced fat cheese. Amazing! Thank you!!!

I found this to be kind of dry. Very good flavor and texture. I would use more cheese and more sauce. I also think it could use black beans, fire roasted tomatoes for more moisture, maybe even black olives. It just needs something else but can't quite decide.

This wasn't near as good as I expected it to be.  First of all, a couple of shortcuts could have been made--instead of substituting tomato paste and water in the enchilada mix, tomato sauce would have been fine.  For that matter, canned enchilada sauce would have been fine.  Dipping the tortillas was a bit messy too.  By the second layer, I just poured the enchilada sauce on top.  If I were to make these again, I would double the enchilada sauce, because the casserole was a little drier than I would have liked.  Otherwise, it was good topped with lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream.  My picky boys liked it.

Very good.  I took the advice of others and used black beans instead of refried beans and I mixed them with some white rice and sauteed green peppers. This was a light mixture and the black beans maintained their integrity, (did not get mushy)I browned the beef with a chopped onion. I then began the layers with rice and bean mixture on the bottom over the tortillas  then the beef then the cheese and I repeated it as per the recipe. I used taco seasoning packets with the tomato paste (coudn't find enchilada sauce) and added onion powder and salt to the rice and beans. Adding a layer of rice and black beans gave the dish more body and it held together nicely and was not dry. It became sort of a Mexican Lasagna. My son loved it.

I added 2 Tbsp of 'Taco Seasoning I' mix to the meat mixture and also a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  It made a lot, and the leftovers disappeared quickly.  I think next time I will add a can of black beans instead of the refried, as per one reviewer, just to give it a nicer presentation.  Thanks for this recipe - we really enjoyed it.

FABULOUS!  I made some changes like others.  I browned the hamburger, then put taco seasoning on it, as well as the garlic powder, and I exchanged the onion powder for onion flakes.  Doubled the cheese like others suggested, and I got RAVE reviews, especially from my husband, who is EXTREMELY picky. :)  LOVED IT!!

My husband and I liked it very much. And, I don't even like Enchilada.  I used a can of enchilada sauce instead of the powder stuff and tomato paste & water.  (I cannot even find the enchilada sauce mix)-so I don't know which is better??? I added chopped onions and bell peppers along with additional seasoning such as salt and chille power. This is a very good easy recipe. Thank you for shareing.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was more work than I'd like to put into a casserole dish like this.  Flavor was excellent but it had a mushy texture that I didn't like.  It seemed more like something you should stuff a chili pepper with.  I didn't like it as a main dish.

This casserole was very good.  I added a can of chopped green chilis and onions while cooking the meat, and I used extra cheese.  My only problem was with the sauce.  I made 2 packages of enchilada sauce and still ran out, and the casserole tasted like it could use some additional sauce.  Next time I will either fix the enchilada sauce the traditional way or add more water with it.  In either case, I will have a 3rd sauce packet ready.  And I may try refried black beans next time.  I will make again.

I make this casserole frequently (whenever I'm in the mood for mexican food).  Which, just happens to be frequently :-)  I add/mix sour cream with the meat mixture.  I use ground chicken (in lieu of ground beef) quite often.

I thought this was really easy & tasty. Changes I made: canned enchilda sauce; ommitted the onion powder and added sauteed onion and green pepper; added some fresh cilantro to the meat mixture, and sprinkled some on top for color. Delicious & simple!

I used a can of enchilada sauce. I also added some diced tomatoes and green pepper to the meat mixture, as well as some taco seasoning. I also used 4 kinds of cheese: chipolte guda, cream cheese with jalenpeno and a little taco seasoning, a little bit of shredded cheddar, and a little bit of mozzerella.It was so creamy and good.

This is a favorite of my 8-year-old. I made it the other night and she absolutely loves it! When serving it, we topped with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and sour cream. Wonderful!!

this was really good. i had only used black beans to make enchilada casserole before this recipe. i loved the refried beans. i used less cheese, added black olives, served it on a bed of shredded lettuce, and topped it off with diced tomatoes. my husband really liked it also.

Very good and easy to make. I also used black beans.  I found it easier to "paint" the sauce onto the tortillas with a silicon brush rather than dip them in the thick sauce.  This recipe is a keeper for us!

This recipe was GREAT. I did make some changes to it.  I used 2 1/2 pounds of ground meat.  I added my own spices to it, also added finely chopped onion.  After draining the meat, I added a can of refried beans, black beans (drained and rinsed), 2 cans mexican corn (drained), 1 can rotel (drained) I used about a cup of enchilada sauce with the meat mixture, the rest went to the shells and poured on top.  I used 2 cans of bought enchilada sauce 28 ounces each. I then followed the recipe and dipped the shells, I didn't saturate the shells, I didn't want them to be mushy.  I also bought 2 packs of shells because only 9 came in a pack. I also bought two packs of mexican cheese for a total of 4 cups. I used a 13x9 pan and everything fit perfectly. I used foil, but sprayed first with Pam so the cheese did not stick. I baked it for about 25-30 minutes. I made this recipe to fit my family, that is what is great about this recipe.  Add or delete. Make Mild, Medium, or HOT.  I made ours medium, because I have a toddler. I did use mild enchilada sauce and rotel, but added my own spices to give it a bit more kick. I served with chunky salsa, sour cream, and also had scoop chips.  My toddler actually ate 2 full plates.  This recipe has found a home in my recipe box.  Thank You for the recipe.

I hesitated to add this to my recipe box because I thought how will this be different from any other mexican recipe that have the same basic ingredients, cheese, ground beef, refried beans, some sort of taco shell.  Well, this was really good!  My sons really liked it too.  I did have to change something (sorry) because I could not find the enchilada sauce it calls for at my grocery store, so i had to follow some suggestins from other reviewers and use the taco meat powdered stuff, but it was still very good.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Great recipe! I also added a small can of diced green chilies, olives and a can of diced tomatoes. I used the spicy enchilada sauce because the husband likes it spicy.

This was ok as is, but to make it 5 star I used prepared enchilada sauce and only used 2 layers of corn tortillas (one on the bottom, one on the top, and covered the top one with enchilada sauce and cheese.) because otherwise it was too much. I also added a half packet of taco seasoning in with the refried bean mixture, as well as some chopped green chilies for some kick. Like that, it's one of the most requested recipes in my house!

Pretty good.  Used Maltese Mom's comments.  Added fresh cilantro on top.  Had to cook 30 minutes.  Could use some hot sauce in my opinion.  Not enough spice for me but a good, easy weekday meal.

I made this with chicken and no beans. I spread sour cream on the tortillas and added a package of taco seasoning to the meat as I layered it. I put creamed mushroom soup over the entire thing. It is very good eaten with salsa on the side.

Great!  Easy and delicious! I did tweak it a bit to match the ingredients I had on hand.  I used tom. paste with about 1&1/4c. warm water and 1/4 tsp. each onion pwd and garlic pwd. instead of enchilada sauce.  
I cooked 1 lb. ground turkey and mixed it with taco seasoning as per the  directions. Then mixed in 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed, 1 can diced tomatoes, some chopped pepperoncini instead of the chilies, 1 can refried beans, 1/2 tsp onion pwd, 1/2 tsp garlic pwd., and some salt.  
Used 1 lb of cheese, shredded.
Baked in small roasting pan in small oven 25 min.
Kids loved it!

We don't eat casseroles at all, but when in a pinch during sports seasons I found this and everyone loved it. I will be keeping this on hand for quick dinners. Thanks for a great recipe!

really really good!  so much easier than making enchiladas, which always fall apart for me.  we used 1.5 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breasts, poached in a spicy seasoned chicken broth all day in a slow cooker then shredded, in place of ground beef.  I also used pre-made enchilada sauce, old el paso brand specifically, I originally bought a Mexican brand but the flavor was not to our liking, more peppery, with no tomato flavors.  next time I might try their green enchilada sauce for something different.  great with sour cream.  so easy, try this tonight!  thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used canned enchilada sauce (green), and I also made chicken instead of beef.  I also added refried beans to the casserole.  I read a review that suggested baking the tortillas for 5 minutes to crisp them a bit.  This didn't work for me.  Also, it takes about 35-40 minutes to heat this casserole up.  I served this with California Style Spanish Rice and Apple Enchilada Dessert - all in all this was a great meal and I got wonderful compliments from my family.

Very easy and very good.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I used bottled enchilada sauce (3 bottles) and still didn't have enough.  I added one bottle of taco sauce to round it out.  I also used ground turkey as well as reduced fat cheese - although I doubled up on the monterey jack for make a 2:1 jack:cheddar ratio.  I cooked it a bit longer - closer to 45 minutes as well.  Very satisfying meal and an quick and easy change for the family.   I will definitely make this again.

This was GREAT!  I made it tonight and I thought I'd have leftovers. Wrong! Between my husband and my son's 8-year-old friend, it is all gone. They both had 3 servings. Like other reviewers, I modified the recipe slightly and used 3 cups of cheese and a 28 oz. can of enchilada sauce versus the tomato paste, etc. I also used taco seasoning mix, with a little extra cumin.  This will become a regular dish in our home.

This recipe was very good but I made some minor alterations instead of making one dry enchilada packet like the recipe calls for I made two packets and had just enough, and when I was frying up the hambuger meat I added a tsp. of cumin my picky husband loved it will make again.

Very easy and tastes great.  Even my 10 month old wanted a bite, then wanted more!  The tomato paste really mellows out the spicey bite you would ordinarily find with packaged enchilada sauce.

This was a HUGE hit at my house.  I have made this several times.  I add more cheese to the top than it calls for and increase cooking time since I make it in a 9x13 pan- good as left overs too.

I thought this was a super recipe. It is easy, very filling and great for leftovers. I substituted the canned enchilada sauce for the dry mix and tomato paste, and thought it was excellent. Be sure to serve with sour cream, lettuce and salsa.

This was easy and tasted good. I just think the meat and refried beans needed a little more flavor. Next time I am going to make the meat like taco meat to add some more flavor.

Given the average review on this recipe was 4.5 when I came upon it, I was hoping that making this per the recipe with tomato paste and water would make a nice, rich flavor that would elevate this dish.  But it was actually quite BLAND.  Then reading some of the other reviews I realized that many had made significant adjustments to suit their palates, then rated this recipe based on an effectively different recipe!  Not helping!

The only change that I made to this recipe was using a can of enchilada sauce.  The flavor of this dish was pretty good but it was the consistency that made it disappointing.  It ended up to be perfect baby food mush for my one year old who ate it right up.  I think it was the refried beans which I thought was an unusual ingredient in enchiladas, but decided to try it anyway.  Over all I would say that the flavor was good, but I will not make  this again.  My husband was disappointed that  I didn't just make regular rolled up enchiladas, and since this didn't save that much time, I tend to agree with him.

I had trouble finding powdered enchilada sauce mix.  So, I used a can of enchilada sauce and added some tomato paste to it.  This recipe was extremely delicious, with a very addictive savory taste and mushy yet hamburger-y texture.  The refried bean and hamburg mixture is enjoyable to make because it comes together very nicely.  You could make a million types of hot Mexican-style dips using that technique.  The only suggestion I have to people making this recipe, is that if you are looking for something HOT, you should add additional spices to the base recipe.  Comforting, savory, simple food at its finest.

Almost like the enchilada casserole I had growing up, which is good, I've been trying to find a recipe as good as that memory.  I realized that what I had as a kid had shredded potato in it so the second time I made this I used frozen shredded potatoes (hash browns) instead of refried beans and really preferthat alteration.  Thanks somuch for supplying this recipe!

Since I'm vegetarian (stiving to be vegan), I used soy ground beef and soy cheese.  Also added extra water to sauce to make it a tad thinner, and added olives on top of the cheese layer.  My husband, son, and guests loved it!

This was a great recipe but i did also use 2 cans of enchilada sauce vs. the dry, and a small can of diced hot peppers.  I added some leftover rice pilaf to the meat/refried beans mixture.  I added a little more red sauce because i added the left over rice.  My family loved it.  I will probably cook the meat with peppers and onions in the future.  I personally like more veggies in my recipes and thought about putting spinach in there too but i wasn't sure if i would get away with that with the kids.  Overall, it was really tasty....i do agree to cook it at 350...the middle really did take unusually long.

Liked by the whole family!  We lightened it up using light cheese, fat free refried beans and 98% lean ground beef.  No difference in the taste!  Just a side a vegetables is all you need!

Not sure about the whole enchilada sauce prep. Seemed pointless to me and I didn't think it would affect the flavor too much so I made the sauce my normal way. A little too much beans for me. And too little cheese. I swapped out the beef for left-over cooked chicken making this pretty easy to throw together. 375 is too hot to cook this casserole at. The middle was cold while the edges and bottom were getting burnt.

This would be 5 stars if it was a little less salty. I will make it again, it has potential with some adjustments. Next time I will definitely just used the canned enchilada sauce. It seems like the powder made the final dish sort of dry and (brand depending) may be why it was too salty. The family loved it though!

I just made this for dinner tonight. I loved it! My family on the other hand would have preferred it cooked a bit longer. The only change I made is that I didn't have any hamburger on hand, and so I substituted steak instead.

While this dish did not turn out pretty by any means, it was absolutely delicious.  The whole family quickly devoured it.  I did have to use canned enchilada sauce as that is what I had on hand.  Will definately keep this one handy.

My husband and I did not enjoy this dish at all.  It lacked flavor and was uninteresting.  I won't be making it again.

I made this for my family of picky eaters and they loved it.  I have a hard time finding casseroles that DON'T include tomatoes, onions or peppers, the 3 things my husband will not eat.  This was perfect.  We will definitely make this again!

I subbed ground venison for ground beef. I needed to use the venison, but it didn't work in this dish. However, aside from the deer, the rest of the dish was quite good.

Great recipe. I used canned enchilada sauce like many other reviewers and worked fine.  Did not care for it reheated though.  Too mushy and dry when reheated.

I'm substituting TVP (a vegetarian meat substitute) for ground beef, tofu for half of the cheese (tastes like ricotta here, less fat, lots of protein) and throwing in a layer of chopped mixed veggies and maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup cooked quinoa. Maybe a dollop of plain yogurt instead of sour cream (sounds gross, but is surprisingly the same flavor). Couple slices of avocado could accompany nicely. And black olives. Yum!

Husband and I both loved this.  I used canned enchilada sauce instead of the first three ingredients.  I also used taco seasoning with the ground beef to give it more flavor, and used black beans (drained but not rinsed) instead of refried beans.  I served it with sour cream, Chalula sauce, and sliced jalapenos on top.  This will be kept in the recipe book for our household.  Thanks!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I used suggestions from other users and added diced tomato.  I also used fajita seasoning instead of taco seasoning (my husband's preference).  Everyone ate it, even my picky oldest daughter.  It made 2 whole casseroles, and there is enough left over from tonight for another meal.  Thank you so much!!!

This was awesome, but I made some changes.  I used no fat black refried beans, and canned enchilada sauce.  I added half an onion and half a green bell pepper both diced to the ground beef (extra lean) and then added a small can of diced green chiles.  Also, I used 2 cups of low fat Mexican blend cheese.  I baked it for 25 minutes covered and 5 minutes uncovered so the top turned out a little crispy.  It was very tasty and my husband really enjoyed it too!

This is a great recipe and easy to modify according to your tastes.  Like most other people, I used canned enchilada sauce, but I used green sauce instead of red.  Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey to make it more healthy and cooked up the turkey with diced onions and diced green chiles.  It ended up tasting great and the recipe will definitely make it into the rotation.

I loved this recipe but my picky hubby just liked it. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added onions and green chili peppers to the meat. The only thing is my enchilada sauce came out too thick I think? Maybe I didn't add enough water? Overall it was very tasty and easy.

It was ok, but I don't think I would make it again. I think the beans made it to dry.  Maybe using only 1/2 a can might have made it better.  You definately need the sour cream to give it some moisture.

Why have I been slaving and rolling enchiladas all these years??? This had all the flavor, but much less cleanup than traditional enchiladas and my husband and boys loved it just as much!  I love the beans incorporated into the mix....My 11 year old HATE beans, but managed to plow through three huge plates of this stuff!  Thanks Kathy, this is awesome!

I needed a quick dinner idea, searched and found this one...it was a hit! I did make a few changes...used ground turkey, added black beans, taco seasoning and sour cream. I added the sour cream to the refried beans, which I spread on top of the meat in layering. Next time I plan to add green chiles or rotel, spicing it up just a bit. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good, but done my way. I used leftover roast, which I seasoned up. Then, spread the beans over the tortillas, and THEN spread a layer of sour cream. That gave it the perfect tang!

Love this recipe! It turned out great. I also used canned sauce just cause it was quicker but everything else I kept exactly like the recipe as I am not good with experiments. My family ate every bite and I am still eating it for lunch!

Great recipe!  I make something similar, but this one is way easier.  The only modification I made is I used flour tortillas, I added green chilis to the meat/bean mixture, and I used taco seasoning and dry onion soup to spice up the meat.  My picky 9-year old had two plates!

This recipe is the BOMB!...Yummy :) My 6 year old cleaned her plate and asked for more...that speaks volumes. My daughter won't eat beans and she never noticed they were in the enchiladas, so great way to sneak in some fiber and protein. I followed the recipe exact, except I used taco seasoning in the meat. This recipe is also perfect for social gatherings.

I found this recipe while I was trying to figure out what to do with an extra pound and a half of ground turkey that I had after making tacos the night before (I accidentally defrosted the whole 3lb package!)  I used a can of enchilada sauce instead of the powdered mix, and because I already cooked the ground meat with taco seasoning I just added the onion powder and garlic salt when I added the sauce.  Definitely a keeper :o)

Loved this recipe!  I did substitue 2 cans of medium enchilada sauce instead of the dry mix w/tomato paste as I could not find it at my grocery store.  I also added some cumin to the seasonings while browning the ground beef.  I served with mexican rice and some shredded lettuce & diced tomato.  I also like a dollop of sour cream on mine although husband does not.  I'll be making this again this evening for my son at his place.  After giving him a piece to take to his work for lunch he phoned me to tell me that "it's bangin'", lol!  UPDATE: 3/22/16  I haven't made this in a while and just made it tonight.  I forgot how good this is!  I sautéed diced onions with the ground beef instead of onion powder and again used canned enchilada sauce and added cumin.

This was easy to make and very good.  My family loved it!  I couldn't find the dry packet of Enchilada seasoning at my grocery store, so I bought 2 cans of sauce.  I also doubled the cheese because my family loves cheese.  Really, really good.  I will be making this for my family alot!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is very good, but why bother with a packet of enchilada sauce mix and a can of tomato paste when you can easily make a homemade enchilada sauce (I found a simple and delicious recipe here, for "red enchilada sauce") instead?  I did that, added a can of diced green chilies to the ground beef mixture, and topped with a dash of Frank's Red Hot sauce and a dollop of sour cream.  This was delicious, and even better the next day!

This is in the oven as we speak. It was super easy & looks delicious! I tweaked a few things. I added a little onion, cumin & chili powder to the meat mixture. I also bought these cans of green chili enchilada sauce one time & I have never used them so I added a can of that to the dry enchilada mix & tomato paste & water. This made a perfect amount of sauce. I broiled the tortillas in the oven to crisp up just a tiny bit with a little Pam spray on them. I put tons of cheese in each layer because we love cheese. I topped this dish with olives, & some lettuce & sour cream. YUM!!!!

This is such a tasty dish and it's become a new favorite with us. My husband and I like to add a lot of "extras" to recipes for more protein, vitamins, etc. So I added a can of seasoned black beans in addition to the refried beans (Hello, Bean-o!). We also added diced tri-color peppers. We thought it needed two cans of the red enchilada sauce instead of one, and I threw in some salsa between layers. This was absolutely scrumptious and we've already made it twice so far. I'd recommend this one to anyone!

LOVED this!! We just ate this for dinner and it is so absolutely yummy! Okay, so I did make a couple of changes. I added a pack of taco seasoning instead of doing the garlic and onion. I also used about 3 cans of enchilada sauce instead of making it from a pack, and lastly used a can of drained/rinsed black beans instead of refried beans. Delicious! I absolutely will add this to our Saturday night Mexican/movie night rotation!

I thought this recipe was very good. My husband on the otherhand said it did not have much taste.  Maybe I should have served it with salsa and sour cream. I did make spanish rice and a tossed salad. I think I will make this again tho.

I sauteed a chopped onion and fresh minced garlic with the ground beef, and added a can of chopped green chiles.  I also used canned enchilada sauce as did some of the other reviewers.  I baked it in a glass covered corning ware dish for 45 minutes, and let it sit for 10 minutes before serving.  It sliced beautifully and all the layers were visible.  It was a nice and easy casserole for a week night supper

This was good but a little plain.  I think the refried beans made it a little too soft.  I would have prefered pinto or black.  I added diced onions to the meat mixture.  I also ran out of sauce before I could dip the last layer of tortillas so I sprayed it with olive oil and covered with cheese.

THIS IS DELICIOUS!!  I just made it for the first time and went with the canned/jar of enchilada sauce and was generous with the cheese in between layers and on top!!  I added green chiles and some chopped onions to the meat as it was browning.  I cooked it for 25 minutes then removed the cover and browned the top.  The result was fabulous and my husband can't wait to eat the left-overs tomorrow night!!  Definitely will make and can't wait for a family get together to show it off.

My husband loves this dish. I used can enchilda sauce (instead of package sauce and tomato paste) and made with flour tortillas and corn tortilla - both delicious. Everyone who has tasted this wants the receipe.

I used canned enchilada sauce and only cheddar cheese and it turned out great!! Definately easier/quicker than rolling the tortillas. Even the leftovers were yummy!

YUMMY! For people who say the tortillas were mushy, if you're using the right tortillas (soft corn) then of course they're not going to be crunchy. I think the tortillas really added to the flavor! I used green chile enchilada sauce.

I took the advice of others and cooked the beef with a packet of taco seasoning and used a can of enchilada sauce.  I got mild sauce, but for some reason it was still really spicy.  Despite that fact we loved this casserole.  I probably will try it with olives and green chiles next time just because I like them.  I thought this tasted kind of like Taco Bell's enchurritos.

Yum! I was impressed at how good the beans were in this recipe. I would not think to add them in enchiladas. I did like others and added a can of prepared enchilada sauce instead of the first few ingredients. This will be added to our usual recipes. Thanks!

Exellant! This is the first main dish I made all by self, and it turned out great! I used about half a bag of both of shreded Gouda and Edamer, instead of the other cheses. I also used a can of Mexican corn and beans and a can of big purple beans. I used their juice and added it to the paste, and only added a little bit of water. I also had chili mix, instead of enchilida mix. And I forgot to add the onion powder, although the chili mix was strong engongh that I believe it made up for it. All it all, it was delious, and the mistakes turned out for my bemifit. If I added the onion powder it probably would've been too spicy. i ate the left overs willingly!

So easy to make and so good.  I did cheat and use canned enchilada sauce.  If you use canned sauce, you'll probably need at least 20oz. or more.  This is a new family favorite!

Despite its humble ingredients, this dish  pleased the whole family--from the one who dislikes corn tortillas to the picky palate. We topped it off with sour cream (and for some, salsa), and the meal was a success! I used the recipe for Red Enchilada Sauce found on this site, and I even used ground turkey instead of the beef. One other substitution that worked out fine: I ran out of cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses; I used Parmesan in the layers, and I combined the mexiblend cheeses with the Parm for the top layer--it was not greasy and still tasty. I suspect that substituting ingredients to your taste will only enhance the dish for you.

This was great and easy to make.  I strayed from the recipe and used canned enchilada sauce from other reviewers suggestions.  I also added hot taco seasoning to my ground meat as well as one can of chopped green chilies and fresh diced plum tomatoes.  Mixed the refried beans in and also added Texas Pete's hot sauce.  I used mexican blend shredded cheese...yum!  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will go by other users suggestions of crisping the tortilla chips first before layering and baking.  Served with salsa and sour cream!  All in all this was a great recipe, especially on Cinco de Mayo!

I LOVED this and so did my family. When I made this I used a can of Las Palmas Red Enchilada sauce (mild) instead of making the sauce. I even poured some on top after I sprinkled the cheese on top. Serve this with rice and beans--it's fabulous! I plan on making this again tomorrow night!!! You could even kick it up a notch and use the Medium or even Hot Las Palmas sauce if you like it spicy!

Great for a Sunday dinner!  I added onion, green onion, cilantro and spices to the meat, and I added a lot more cheese.  I used the Ten-Minute Enchilada sauce recipe with some modifications and it turned out great.

Awesome. My boyfriend and I gobbled this one up... but I wouldn't recommend using a mix for the sauce. There's a really great, easy Enchilada Sauce on this site... called "Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce." Totally worth it.

This recipe was good but it did need more sauce.  I will double the sauce next time as I ran out on my very top layer plus the extra sauce in the meat would make it much more tasty.  I also added a can of green chilies to the meat mixture.

This is a great dinner the first night and makes great freezable leftovers.
For those who like spice, I add a can of green chilies and 1- 2 cans of chopped jalapenos to the meat mixture. I also topped it off with sliced jalapenos rings and sour cream. If the sauce seams too thick add more water, the original recipe was dry when I made it.

I think this recipe needs something. I followed it exactly and it just wasn't very good, it was dry and tortillas were mushy, guess I should have read the reviews first. Sorry, I am going to keep looking for an enchilada casserole recipe.

One of our favorites!!  I use about 2 cans of enchilada sauce instead of the water/paste mix.  I also double the amount of cheese and use ground turkey. Yummy!!  Also - great leftovers!!

I used real garlic and real onion and sauteed them with the meat.  I also added 1/4 tsp. cumin powder to the meat/refried beans mix.  Easy and REALLY tasty!!!

This is very good!!  Pass the sour cream!  I do think that the enchilada sauce needs more water; it was too thick and not enough.  I will make more sauce next time.  I too used black beans instead of refried and I think they make it really good.  KEEPER!

After reading the reviews, I decided to substitute a can of drained/rinsed black beans for the refried beans. I scaled the recipe to 10 servings, too. My family went back for seconds and everyone wanted the recipe! There were only 2 pieces left! yum!

Very good! This is a great basic recipe for any mexican-type casserole. You can be so creative with this! I used Chihuahua cheese for an authentic mexian flavor, and topped with pico de gallo and fresh cilantro when it was finished baking. Great dish, very filling, and rather on the healthy side too.

The taste of this dish was good however the look was not very appetizing.  I would also suggest putting diced jalapenos in this for some added spice since the recipe is kind of bland.

My 12 year old son made this dish for his cooking project at school.  He had no problem making the dish AND it came out splendid!  He served it with a chicken/tomato bouillon rice, a little lettuce salad on our plates and had salsa and sour cream to put on the casserole. The whole family loved it. Oh & he got an "A" on his project!  I will make this again, myself.

My family did not like this recipe.  Everything seemed to melt together - it had little flavor and no texture.

My husband and I love Mexican dishes and this one was very good!  After baking, I did add shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and sour cream for extra flavor.  Was very filling and the left-overs tasted just as great heated up.

I was not impressed by this.  I found it way more trouble than I'm willing to go through for a dish that did not have much taste.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I have tried it with a pork roast that I cooked in the crockpot the day before and also chicken.  Both were wonderful.  I couldn't find the dry enchilada sauce so I just used cannned - everyone loved it.  Thank You!!

We don't eat a lot of mexican in our house outside of the typical taco.  This was good, did have to use flour rather than corn, apparently in Upstate NY no one thought about corn tortillas, turned out just as good, served with another recipe for mexican rice, I would recommend that too.  Heats up nicely.

I was looking for something a little different and I found this My husband and I love it. Great dish when you love Mexican dishes but want something a little different and easy. Awesome taste, we are cheeses lovers so I added a little bit more of cheddar.

5 stars as written but this is a completely versatile recipe. This time I had to make some substitutions because of what I had on hand. I sautéed one white onion in a little bit of olive oil then added 2 lbs of ground beef and homemade taco seasoning mix (from an allrecipes recipe). I then mixed a can of refried beans in, half of a can of enchilada sauce and a can of black beans. Dipped corn tortillas in enchilada sauce and put them in the casserole dish topped with the beef mixture then cheese and repeat. Topped with extra cheese, baked 30 minutes and broiled an additional 5 minutes to get the top layer nice and crispy. One of the best recipes I’ve ever made and so incredibly filling.

the tomato paste was too thick and the refried beans were overpowering. if I make again will definitely loosen up the sauce and cut down on the beans.

Much easier than preparing individual enchiladas and everyone can have as much as they want.  I always double the cheese and usually need more sauce too!

This was ok, I should have taken another reviewers suggestion and baked the corn tortillas to crisp them up.  I think that would have made a difference.  It needed some more spice or something to ramp up the flavor.

This is a good and easy recipe for a cool rainy evening. All the ingredients I had on hand. I added about 1more cup of cheddar cheese and baked it for 25 minutes and it was great.

I made as written and it was very good.  Made for my parents who love enchiladas but not heat, so much, so it was perfect for them but also enjoyable for me!  Sometimes simpler is better.

This is a GREAT recipe.  I added corn and olives because I like them, but otherwise, did not change the recipe (and I usually do).  It is perfect as is.  I had extra beef mixture that I will freeze for tacos at a later date.

Made this for the second time with the addition of one can of sweet corn divided equally between layers along with the other ingredients. The added sweetness was noticable and a compliment to the recipe. With or without the corn, it's a great dish.

I scanned the suggestions before making and used 1-1/2 cans enchilada sauce instead of a mix and an envelope of taco seasoning in the meat/onion mixture in addition to the spices already called for. I also pre-baked the tortilla shells as was suggested by someone else. Served casserole with sour cream, guacamole, jalapeños and chopped lettuce on the side. Was hearty and filling but not that flavorful, even with the additions. Just ok. Curious to see if the leftovers are better the second day.

I've made this several times and it's a great comfort food when you're craving Tex-Mex.  My family loves it.  To make the tortilla "dipping" easier, I pour a little  enchilada sauce in the bottom of the dish and spread it out with a spatula, repeating for the top of each tortilla layer.  I cut some of the tortillas into halves and quarters to make even layers.  I find I need much more sauce than the recipe calls for so that it isn't too dry, so I buy a large can rather than making it from mix.  We often eat it with lettuce shreds, salsa and sometimes avocado slices on top.  Yum!

I followed the changes that used canned enchilada sauce, fired roasted tomatoes, and chilles and did not cook the lettuce but served it as a side.  It was delicious but terribly filling.  I served this for 4 and had enough left over to feed the 2 of us twice more.  Company loved it.

As recommended by several reviewers I used a 28oz can of red enchilada sauce. Other than that I made the recipe as written. It was easy to put together and the end result had a lot of flavor. Thank you for sharing.

I made slight modifications, I put pinto instead of refried and used fresh onions instead of the onion powder. But we all loved it and I will make it again!

Used pre-made Old El Paso Enchilada sauce.  Added another 1/2 cup of cheese and can of corn.  Next time will add some rice.  Such a fast and easy recipe that will be great as leftovers.  Thanks for posting.

I have never made anything like this before and was really excited to try this.  The end result however was a dish that was mushy and mediocre.  My family was able to eat it, but no one raved about it or ever wanted to have it again.  I feel like this recipe needs a little work to address the texture issues and i felt like it was lacking in a lot of other flavors such as sauteed onions and peppers that would have added additional layers.  I will keep looking for another recipe instead of trying to doctor this one up.

I made this for dinner for my family today, and like a lot of other people used canned enchilada sauce instead of making my own packet version of it. It was good, but it needed a little more umph to it in my opinion. I think I shall try adding a few more things to it next time like some olives and canned green chiles just to add a bit more flavor to it.

Soo good! Very easy to make, simple , and quick. My family love it. I make this in place of taco Tuesdays, big hit! I add chopped mild green chilis for extra flavor into each layer.

Really good, but next time I will add chilis and top with onions. It needs a little more spice.

Edit: Chilis and black olives makes this 5 stars!

I tried this recipe last week and followed it just as the directions stated.  It was great and my husband loved it!  He took the leftovers for lunch the following day.  The only thing I would suggest is doubling the sauce so that there is more than enough (I did not have enough so I had to use regular tomato sauce for the remaining tortillas because that is all I had).  My husband also said that next time we should add black olives and green onions, so we will try that next time.  Great recipe... it's a keeper in our home!

This recipe is good and easy to make.  However, I like a little bit more of a kick when I make it.  Depending on what's in the cupboard I'll either add rotel tomatoes (drained), green chilis (drained) or sliced jalapenos to spice it up.  I also add a little sour cream on top.

Very good, I used black beans instead of refried and added some chopped bell pepper.  My husband and I liked it, will try it again with more sauce, was a little "dry" thanks for the recipe

A very easy casserole that you can really play with the ingredients. I used jared enchilada sauce and toasted the tortillas in the oven for about 10 minutes when the oven was preheating. Then I just spread the enchilada sauce over each layer of tortillas. I used 2-3 on each layer. Also added black beans on top of the refried beans. Great taste for not many ingredients and had to serve with sour cream. Maybe a mexican corn to it next time!!

Very good recipe. I used other suggestions and used an envelope on taco seasoing and the water it called for and cooked for a few minutes and then added a can of black beans and diced tomatoes and let simmer for about five minutes. I also doubled the cheese!!! Very good and will surely keep this in my recipe book.

This was super easy and it was good.  My kids and husband loved it.  Anything my 7 year old asks for seconds of is excellent in my book.  I forgot to save 1/2 the sauce to dip the tortillas in (I mixed it all in with the meat), but I can't see that it would make any real difference. Next time I'll try to remember.  We'll do this again.

I loved this recipe!  I stuck with the original recipe only adding a little cumin and chili powder per recommendations.  I added a can of enchilada sauce to the mixture when I saw I was getting low, and I used refried black beans because I prefer them over regular refried beans.  This recipe had fantastic flavor and texture.  I was a little wary about adding the beans to the meat, but once it was all put together, it was really good!

I made 2 changes-cooked the hamburger with fresh onion and garlic, and used Taco seasoning.  I don't think this really changes the essence of the recipe, which is awesome!  My hubby put sour cream and salsa on his, I ate mine the way it is. Either way, it's a hit.

Easy and delicious, leftovers just as good!  Like others, I also used canned enchillada sauce for ease.  Based on some reviews that the tortillas were a bit mushy, I fried them first in a small amount of vegetable oil for @25 seconds each and dried them on paper towel.  Used several tortillas for each level and did not coat them with the enchillada sauce.

This is a keeper. I too used canned enchilada sauce and black beans like other reviewers. Everyone who tried it liked it. To spice it up for those that wanted it a little hotter I placed sliced jalepenos on a portion of it.

I used Old El Paso canned enchilada sauce (two hot and one mild) because I prefer my food with a little kick rather than the first three ingredients.  I also used ground turkey breast because that what I had on hand.  I found this recipe to be good, however next time I think I will probably double the amount of tortillas I use because I felt like I was eating only meat and beans.

This recipe was just okay to me. I didn't necessarily like the cream of chicken taste.  May try it again with a few variations.

My husband and son absolutely loved this recipe. The only thing that I did different was to use  fajita size flour tortillas for the top that I sliced in 1/2 and laid over in place of the corn ones. It got rave reviews !!  I also used the encilda canned sauce instead of the mix.

Easy to throw together and really good!  I also used a can of enchilada sauce instead of the first three ingredients.  Great recipe!

Very good--everybody liked it. I added more spice to everything, but could have done with more tortillas according to the family. Next time will do two or three times the amount of tortillas. Other then that delicious!

I made this over the weekend and it was a hit and even was eaten for left overs.  I used 2lbs hamb. added taco seasoning(2pks), 2 Rotell's, 1-black olive(not much of a fan) and 1 can enchilada sauce, I did fry the corn shells in oil like suggested and then dipped in enchilada sauce and used PLENTY of cheese like 6 cups, and it made sooo much that I will end up freezing some because it was alot. But was good

Everyone loved it.  Used flour tortilas; maybe try the corn next time. Made enchelada sauce with tomato paste, water onion, cumin, chilie powder, garlic & italian spice.

Very nice dish. Threw some cumin in with the beef. Used pre-shredded Mexican cheeses. Used black beans, (minus liquid) instead of re-fried beans.

This recipe was excellent. I took the advice of those who reviewed the recipe before, and was very happy with the results, more so than I though I would be. I too used pre-made enchilada sauce, taco season for the meat and olives, green onion, and green chiles on top. I made enough for four servings but I think I will get much more out of it. The leftovers were just as good as when it was fresh out of the oven. To all the previous reviewers, thanks for the extra tips!

This was great.  My husband loves Enciladas, so I tried this recipe.  My three year old loved it to.  I did use the canned enchilada sauce instead of the dry.  It was an great with Spanish rice on the side.

This was good  - and easy enough to prepare for a weekday night. Mild enough for the kiddies. Definitely could have used some sour cream on the side, though. I wasn't jumping up and down over it - but I wouldn't have a problem making it again.

Delicioso! I used shredded beef (heated up a Tyson microwave roast beef dinner in the skillet), chopped green chilis and a good amount of cumin and some hot sauce while cooking the meat. I stirred the refried beans right into the meat. I also doubled the amount of corn tortillas and cheese, and about 1/2 lg. can of Las Palmas sauce. I actually assembled the casserole and refrigerated it for several hours before dinner time, popped it in the oven (covered with foil) for 20 min and the removed the foil and cooked for another 5 min til cheese melted. I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch today :-) Served with corn and mexican rice, this was a very filling meal!

I really enjoyed this dish!  I will never make regular enchiladas again.  It was easy and very tasty.  I used taco seasoning in the ground beef.  I think it would have been way too bland had I not done that.  I think the cheese was a bit strong.  I don't really care for cheese, so maybe it was just me.  I will cut down on the amount next time.  All in all this was a fantastic dinner and something I could make any night of the week.

I had some corn tortillas that I needed to use up and this is the recipe I chose to try. It was really easy to throw together. I used the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce from this site, as well as the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site. I added corn and cilantro to the meat layer, and I used chipotle refried beans to add some heat. I ran out of enchilada sauce, so I smeared some salsa on the top layer of tortillas. This dish is even better the next day!

Very good recipe.  I made a couple changes.  I bought a 28 oz. can of enchilada sauce and used 2 packages of corn tortillas.  I also bumped up the beef to 2 lbs and also 2 cups of each cheese.  When it comes out we top it with sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, sliced black olives and sliced jalapeno peppers.  YUMMY!!

I thought this was good, although I would definitely recommend making your own sauce versus buying it.  I've made the red enchilada sauce recipe from this website and it's good sauce.  I added hot sauce and taco seasoning to the beef as well as sprinkled some sliced olives over the beef.  I'm not sure that I'll make this recipe again.

This WAS super easy, and good. My boyfriend really enjoyed it. I did as others did and used 1 can of enchilada sauce (which was plenty, I'm not sure how others used 2..) and taco seasoning. ALso used turkey and reduced fat cheese. Cooked a little longer, about 30 minutes, wasn't warm all the way through after 20 mins.

This is really good and pretty easy to make.  It made a lot of food, which is fine for me and my husband, as we can take the leftovers to work for lunch.  Next time I will definitely use the canned sauce, as well as more cheese.  And I used tortilla chips for the top layer of tortillas, which I will definitely do again.

Followed suggestions to eliminate first three ingredients and use 1-2 cans of enchilada sauce. Used blacked beans rather than refried, used fresh diced onion, added one 4oz can of diced green chiles. To add some heat and flavor: cumin, ground cayenne red pepper and tabasco sauce.

This should really be called a Burrito Casserole since Enchiladas rarely have refried beans in them.

We felt the beans added an undo heaviness to the recipe.  I baked the tortillas beforehand and still felt they turned out too mushy.

Will keep searching for a better recipe.

I loved this dish. I made my own enchilada sauce though. I added a layer of cottage cheese with the shredded cheese and roasted poblano peppers. I served it with sour cream, chopped onion, chopped tomato and salsa. For a side dish, I made spanish rice with Goya Sazon and a salad.

It was very good.  I did subsitute the powder enchilada for canned, and put taco seasoing instead of the garlic and onion salt. Even my 2 1/2 year old and husband ate all what was on their plate!

This recipe was okay. The tortillas were not soggy at all, and that was my only concern. I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce ( 10 oz each ) and it could have used one more can. I added more cheese as well. I seasoned the beef with a taco seasoning recipe on this site. All in all it was a decent recipe.

This recipe is so easy and so good.  I like mine spicy so instead of enchilada powder-I use a 16 oz can of spicy enchilida sauce.  I also do not use any water.  As suggested from other users..I top it with green onions, black olives and sour cream...yummy!  Thank you so much for posting this one-definite keeper!

As others I skipped the first 3, used enchilada sauce. I added a can of diced tomatoes to the meat mixture as well as cilantro and a small can of diced peppers. When I removed the foil for the last 5 min of baking I added black olives and green onions both sliced. Was fantastic!!

I also used the 10 minute sauce on this web site.  This was REALLY good!  I used low carb tortillas, fat free refried beans and extra lean ground beef.  I used sliced black olives over the top and chopped green onions.  It's a keeper!

Really good and filling.  It didn't seem like enough sauce to cover the tortillas.  May need to double it or use the canned enchilada sauce that others have suggested.

We ignored the three first ingredients and used a can of enchilada sauce instead, and we also used chicken breasts cubed instead of beef and added salsa to the chicken/bean mixture. It turned out to be one of the best mexican dishes we've ever had! Unfortunately, we pretty much created a different dish, so I'm only going to rate it 4 stars. Thanks for the idea though!

This dish was excellent! Used more cheese then stated and didnt have any tomatoe paste so used about 1/4 cup tomatoe sauce. I also added some chopped onion to the hamburger while it cooked. It was a great dish for our cinco de mayo dinner! Cant beleive someone said they threw it out..must not be to savvy in the kitchen!

Sorry, None of my family liked this.  We ended up throwing it out.  Not much flavor and the corn tortillas were soggy and mushy.  I'll have to keep looking for an enchilada recipe.

We loved this!  I made it vegetarian with Garden burger crumbles and it was yummy!  We served it with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, olives, guacamole and sour cream and more shredded cheese.  I used jar enchilada sauce- just so easy.  The leftovers were delicious as well!  Definitely a favorite from now on.

This recipe is very easy and tasty!  I can now see how to vary the recipe with chicken as well as beef.  One suggestion is to add more fire to it - I think it could be kicked up a notch (this is coming from a spice weakling!) Thanks!!!

My kids ate this, which is a plus. . . but it tasted and felt more like a filling to something else than a dish unto itself.  Bland flavor, so good for kids who don't like spicy things, but not so great for those of us who do like flavor.  Actually would be better as a dip for tortilla chips or something.  I felt like I was eating straight bean dip.  The search for the perfect enchilada continues.
