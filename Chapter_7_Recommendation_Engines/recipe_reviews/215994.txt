Awesome good. Not nearly as good as what we've enjoyed in Rome, but then again there they use fresh locally grown artichokes, good, fresh pizza dough, fresh mozzarella and a minimum of fresh tomato sauce. But this isn't Rome.  I used mozzarella rather than the Colby-Monterey Jack.  We loved it right down to the last bite. The only thing I'll do differently next time is use my own, simple, unseasoned tomato sauce.

This was delicious! I used Jays signature pizza crust for this recipe. This was a nice change from the usual pepperoni, and sausage.

So yummy!  I used a flat bread crust and a spicy tomato sauce.  Loved it!
