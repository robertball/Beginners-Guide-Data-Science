This is a very good recipe..  made it twice.  I tweaked it to my own likings the second time.  Left the cranberries out and added more nuts.  So good and very moist!  I baked in a dark teflon tube pan so I reduced the temp down to 315 degrees and shortened the cook time 10 mins less.   DELICIOUS!

It is the best and only Fruit Cake I will ever eat.  I make it in small cake tins and give them as presents to my friends and family.  My Grandsons get excited when they hear that I am making this.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  One review mentioned they left the cranberries out.  I soak the cranberries in Brandy for a day or if you are in a hurry pop them in the microwave for 2 cycles of 30 secs and let them sit for 20 minutes.  We love this recipe.

I made as cupcakes. Yum! subbed cranberries for raisins. Used maraschino cherries halved for candied cherries. 
Sure will repeat next Christmas

This recipe was a HUGE disappointment. I can't help but think that there is something missing in the recipe. The cake, described as incredibly moist, was so dry that it was inedible. I followed the recipe to the letter and, since I could tell it was getting brown on the top very quickly, I did not bake it the full one hour and 15 minutes, but more like an hour. It was still inedible. My oven has just been calibrated so I know the oven was not the problem. Has anyone else had the same result with this recipe? I was really looking forward to tasting this very easy fruitcake and was extremely disappointed.
