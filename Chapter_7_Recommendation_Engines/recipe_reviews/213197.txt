These were very good. I was really hoping for more blue cheese flavor, but it didn't really come through. These did not become crispy in the allotted baking time, so I baked them a little longer, then a little less after dunking in the sauce. We enjoyed these on Super Bowl Sunday.

This was  a good recipe, I wanted it a little sweeter so added some honey. I  really, like the sauce but , think it will work better for a dipping sauce for chicken tenders. I plan on making it again soon for the tenders. I had to turn up the oven to 400% for about 20 minutes to get it more crispy.

These wings were really good! I baked them at 375 for about 45 minutes then dunked them in the sauce and baked for an additional 30 minutes until they were a dark mahogany color. My husband devoured them. He just called me to say he ate the leftovers for breakfast and they were even better. He likes them cold! Next time I'll make a full batch so we have plenty for the next day. It's a keeper for sure! Also I mixed cayenne and black pepper so they wouldn't be too spicy and they were just right. Hot but not too hot.

This is my favorite recipe to bake wings. As I use frozen wings I have adjusted the oven temp higher and the cooking times to longer but the taste is awesome!

Used Buffalo ranch instead of blue cheese. Family loved it.  Less spicy next time

Mine turn out a little soupier, but I LOVE IT!  I could probably get them crispier if I turned the oven up during the first cooking phase, but have enjoyed them just the way they turn out.  Meat falls off the bone, sauce is wonderful and I can't wait to make them again on Sunday for the game.
