I'm not a fan of black-eyed peas, but my wife is Southern and I wanted her to fulfill her New Year's requirement.  This soup is incredibly delicious.  I did substitute beef broth for the water / bouillon and I left out the chilies, otherwise I stayed true to the recipe.  The Ro-Tel tomatoes brought the perfect amount of heat for us.  This soup is very meaty and the black-eyed peas play a supporting role, bringing a pleasant complexity to the flavor.  If you really like them I think that you could easily add another can without overwhelming the soup.  I made Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread to go with it.  Tomorrow's leftovers will be with rice.  I can hardly wait.

Excellent!!!  I didn't have pork sausage so I ground some pork sirloin with my Kitchen Aid mixer and used that.  Since it wasn't seasoned as sausage I added about 1/2 teaspoon sage and extra garlic salt.  That's the only change I made and this stuff is wonderful!
I'm serving with cornbread and can't wait until time to eat!  Try this, it is excellent!!!
edited...Dinner is over and we enjoyed every bite!  I'm almost afraid to try it with the sausage since the ground pork was so good!  I will, however, try the sausage next time and report back.  :)

Had black eyed peas left from New Year's Day and thought I'd try something other than throwing them in w/ a pot of vegetable soup. So glad I tried this! Daughter #1, who HATES and despises black eyed peas, came in from work and ate two, yes, two bowls and pronounced it delicious. I did have about a cup more peas than the recipe calls for, but hey, it's soup, right? Absolutely not too many. Wouldn't have a problem w/ more. In my opinion, it needed much more time on the stove. 45 minutes is not enough time to mingle and marry the flavors. After tasting, I felt it needed more kick. Now, please understand that I do not like things too hot, just spicy. I added extra salt and pepper and a gracious plenty (as Mama always said) of Frank's Original hot sauce. Practically perfect in every way. When I added a 14.5 oz can of tomatoes and chilies, abovementioned daughter and I were practically dancing w/ joy. Now, that I've reviewed original recipe, I'm probably going back to the kitchen to add a few cans of other beans, not, and I repeat NOT because the soup needs it...just cuz I'm trying to add more vegs to my diet. I make lots of soups and freeze them in one serving bags to take to work for lunch. Very delicious, healthy and frugal. I'm looking forward to having this one. Cornbread essential.

Absolutely delish!!  This is a quick and easy meal that tastes fantastic!  My husband and the kids loved it.  We served it with salad and corn chips.  The only change I made was adding pinto beans and navy beans instead of the black-eyed peas.  It is all I had on hand.  Black-eyed peas are beans anyway so I can't imagine the taste would be that much different if I had used the black-eyed peas.  This recipe is absolutely worth making.  It is so easy and uses ingredients that many people would have on hand.  YUM!

This was delicious! It was a last minute meal and I happened to have 3 cans of black eyed peas!   The only change I made was adding 2 cans of Rotel, and not the extra can of green chilies.  The whole family liked it - 11 and up.

This was very good!!! I can see adapting this with a different bean for those that are not fans of black eyed peas. I served over cornbread with a dollop of chow chow. I am posting a picture and took like 10 shots, it does not photograph well!!!! but don't let that deter you from trying it as 5 stars is in order! This is perfect for good luck on New Years Day, bet it would fabulous served over rice too, thanks for sharing!!!!!

Just had this dish at a friend's house for a church meal fellowship gathering.  Could not stop eating it.  Can't believe it is so simple yet so tasty--just my kind of comfort food.  two thumbs up.

Awesome recipe, even approved by my picky grandson. I inadvertently left out the big can of tomatoes, but it was still great. Next time I think I'm going to add frozen okra.

This is the best black eyed pea recipe I have tried.  The best part is that it is so easy and quick to make!  I didn't have to spend hours boiling beans and ham hocks.  Only change I made was to add 3 (14.5) cans of tomatoes with chiles instead of the 2 plain/1 peppers called for.  This was a big hit with all!!!

This is the third year I've made this soup for New Year's Day.  My mom always told me black-eyed peas were good luck for the new year.  :)  This year's batch was the best ever.  My 6 yr old even gobbled hers up in record time.  Having heard that canned tomatoes are killing us (like most everything else we eat these days), I bought a box of chopped tomatoes.  They came out more like a chunky sauce than diced tomatoes, but I guess that was just what the recipe needed because it was delicious.  I froze half and still have enough for lunch for the next couple of days for me and my family.  Looking forward to lunch today for sure!!  :)  (Note: I still used Ro-Tel.  A southern girl can't live without her Ro-Tel.)

My family & I Loved this recipe. I did make some changes as we don't like hot & overly spicy foods. I used low sodium beef broth instead of the water and bullions. I also switched this to 2 cans of light red kidney beans and 2 packages of frozen black eyed peas. No spicy tomatoes or chillies, just 2 cans of petite tomatoes but, I did add chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder, and tomatoe paste. A half hour before it was done I mixed corn starch to broth and added to the pot to thicken the sauce. Basically I turned this into a black eyed pea-chili recipe. I served this with grated cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and scoopable corn chips. It was fantastic. I usually try to stick to any recipe I try but, there was no going around this one. This turned out better than my usual chili and everyone said so. This was our New Years dinner (as I'm southern & black eyed peas is a family tradition). I have tried so many different recipes in the past and my family says this is the one they want every year on the first! Thanks for a great one!

I don't think I've ever had black eye peas before, let alone cook with them... So why did I have a bag of frozen ones in the freezer?!? This dish was delicious! I substituted a few things based on what I had: a bag of frozen black eye peas for canned, two garlic cloves instead of garlic salt, omitted the salt, and (accidentally) crushed tomatoes for the 28 oz can, beef broth for water and bullion

So good and so easy to put together.  I made this using all pork sausage and precooked dried peas in place of the canned.  We loved it!  I can see myself making this again very soon.

I love this recipe!! We have dried black eyed peas that we got on sale and I had to find a way to use them since I've NEVER cooked with them. Also, we have a new year's resolution to save money by not eating out and strictly limiting our grocery budget. I made this batch for just under $4.50 and definitely tweaked it based on my liking and what I had available in my cabinet. This is what I did differently: We used the full 1 lb package of dried peas, replaced both the sausage and beef with ONLY 1/2 lb of beef that we bought on sale, I skipped the Rotel and can of green chiles and replaced them with about 6 large roasted green chiles instead (where I live in CO we buy them by the bushel every fall and freeze them). I also voided using molasses because we simply didn't have it. I added a bit of chile powder to add more flavor… it is so delicious!!!

To cook the dried peas I boiled them for 10 mins under 3 inches of water, turned off the heat and let them soak for an hour. I then drained them and followed the recipe says to (I allowed the soup to simmer for a bit longer to accommodate the extra time needed for the dried peas). So good and we are DEFINITELY making it again--especially since it only costed us 75 cents per serving!!

I didn't care for this soup at all, but the men of the house loved it. I just durn like the flavored of beef and sausage mixed together. I'd do it again differently if the guys want me to, but otherwise I wouldn't make a new attempt.

This is delish! My whole family loved it. I only used a pound of meat (beef) but will try sausage next time.  Used homemade bone broth instead of the water and bouillon. Didn't have enough Black Eyed Peas so I used one can of Black Beans and one of Kidney beans.  2 cans of Black Eyed Peas since one reviewer said it could handle more beans.  Don't have garlic salt so used about 5 cloves of garlic and sea salt (1tsp)  Increased the other spices and Worchestershire after tasting. Used honey since I didn't have molasses.  Added some carrots and about 1/2 a head of cabbage.  My new favorite soup!

I was looking for something with black eyed peas for New Years Day.....came across this - with all the awesome reviews, decided to try it.  This soup is AHHHMAZING!  We made just as the recipe states with one addition.....we sub'd one can of black eyes with a can that had jalapeños.  When i make again, i think i will add 2 cans with jalapeños.  Served this with cornbread - shared with neighbors and they said the same thing.....AWESOME soup!  Happy New Year....grab this recipe and make it - you won't be sorry!

Made this to use up black eyed peas, and liked it more than I expected to! Good flavor, but both my husband and I felt it needed another component - maybe diced potatoes? Had  to make a couple substitutions: maple syrup for molasses, and used all pork sausage (but it became the dominant flavor so I would do half and half next time, or my husband suggested strips of pork). Hearty, great winter soup!

This is a very good recipe.  My two oldest children, who don't otherwise like black beans, both had two bowls.  I prepared the recipe as above but added kale towards the end.  The kale went nicely in the soup and gave it some color. The soup is great with cornbread.

This has become our go to New Year's Day meal! After years of trying different ways to incorporate Black-Eyed Peas into our NYD dinner I'm glad we finally found a mainstay. I use bulk Italian style chicken sausage rather than pork sausage and that lowers the fat content while keeping it wonderfully delicious. I also subbed beef broth for the water/bullion and used some frozen/roasted/diced Hatch Green Chile's rather than canned... love this stuff!

What a great recipe! We cooked up a 1lb bag of dried black-eyed peas to use for this. Also added a couple cloves of garlic with the onions. Didn't have enough beef boullion, but did have fresh turkey stock, so used some of that, plus the water from cooking the peas, then let it cook down to more of a chili consistency.  Smells heavenly as it cooked and tasted DIVINE.

Tasty!  I had to make quite a few substitutions due to my pantry stock, but still turned out good and was a bit fresher.  Will hope to try as original recipe to compare.  Substitutions included: pork to 1/4c bacon bits, Worchester sauce to Steak sauce, garlic salt to 2 garlic cloves plus sea salt  and  molasses to syrup.  Used frozen black eyed peas and beef stalk instead of caned and added water with bouillon.  Good tasty soup...would prefer it thicker (original recipe may be so) or served with rice or cornbread.  Maybe add some crushed tomatoes for thickening next time?

Very hearty, delicious soup. I did add 3 tbsps of tomato paste and 2 cans of rotel because I only had a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. That makes sense right? Also I was using dried black-eyed peas so cooked longer of course. Didn't have the green chilies so omitted.

Tried this recipe. So Good. Used organic coconut oil to cook the onion and sausage. Used Scorpion pepper instead of chillies. Instead of Worcestershire sauce used angustura bitters. instead of garlic salt used fresh garlic.

I realized after making this soup that I need to purchase a bigger dutch oven!  I used what I had or only ingredients that I liked.  Instead of regular onion I used a red one.  For the black eyed peas I used homestyle with bacon flavor 2 cans and regular plain ones for 1 can.  I used better then bouillon beef and bc I did not have molasses I used light brown sugar instead.  I also don't like a lot of tomatoes so I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers.  I used both hamburger and mild sausage.  This soup is hearty and  was very delicious.  I am going to have to freeze some for later but I would definitely make it again.

I thought this was quite tasty! I subbed ground turkey for the beef and sausage, but added Fresh garlic and sausage seasoning for flavor, and I also subbed no salt added beef broth for the water and bouillon.  I liked that this was not super spicy, but still very flavorful.

I cut the recipe in half, left out the meat, there is protein in the black eyed peas. I added 5 tables of medium heat salsa to give it a kick. Serve corn muffins on the side with it.

This is what my family calls Hoppin’ John, and we serve it with cornbread. The only difference is that I add sausage and chicken broth to the mix, but it’s also good without them, just our preference. It’s very good, very easy to make and feeds many.

Easy and delicious.  I used beef broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes.  I did not have molasses so left that out.  It was great and it makes a lot.  Update:  This is even better the second day.

Excellent recipe. I of course added 2 large cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of Turmeric! I had uncooked peas so I preboiled them and added everything just like the recipe called for! I will definitely fix this again and again!

This is the best soup we have ever had!!  I had to use mild Italian sausage because that's all I could find, and I did not add the salt.  The rest was exactly as shown in the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

This is amazing . I've been searching for a good black eyed pea recipe, and this is it! I did increase the cumin to 1/2 tsp, didn't add the salt because I felt the added sodium wasn't needed. I used Owens hot breakfast sausage. I felt like the large can of tomatoes was going to be too much, so I only added about 3/4 of the can. Hindsight, the whole can probably would have been good. Was taking to my brother's for New Years party, so I was in a hurry. There were no leftovers to bring back. Even the non pea eaters loved the dish.

I needed a healthy,  easy way to make black eyed Peas for the new year and this was a good choice. I did make changes just because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of Rotel.  I skipped the extra can of chilis. I used ground turkey sausage and ground venison burger. When I make it again I will cut the molasses in half because it was a little too sweet. Definitely use all of the spices,  and add a pinch of sage,  which sounds weird but brings out the sausage flavor.   I also let it simmer for hours.

This recipe was amazing.  I was looking for something different for black eyed peas and ham.  This did the trick.  To save a trip to the store and buying  ground meat I used left over cubed ham from Christmas and added a ring of Andouille sausage cut up.  I used soaked black eyed peas instead of canned and it required a longer simmering time somewhat like an all day chili would, and it came out perfect.  Thank you for sharing.  I'll be making this again!!

I made this for my family for New Year's Day eating Black-Eyed Pea tradition. It was amazing. I had venison sausage to add with the beef and I followed others' suggestions and used beef broth instead of water and bouillon.  I cooked it all day in the crock pot and it was getting spicier so I added honey to calm it down for the faint of heart at our table.  This definitely will be made many times this year.

I made this for a group of 12 people and they all loved it.  I doubled the recipe, and there was just enough left over for 2 bowls, which two of the men grabbed for their lunch the next day! Slight changes I made: Chicken Sausage with Italian Seasoning instead of Pork Sausage; Beef Broth instead of water with beef bouillon cubes; dry black-eyed peas cooked on low for 45 mins beforehand; left out the add'l can of green chilies.  The Rotel with the ground cumin gave it just the right amount of heat.

I used 2 lbs turkey instead of beef and pork.  I used real beef stock.  I used dry black eyed peas (1lb) I cooked them separate for 1 hour then added them to the other ingredients for another 30 minutes.  I also used curry instead of cumin.  I added allspice.

Perfect for New Year's Day!  Delicious!  I use a bag of dried black-eyed peas to cut down on the sodium, and I add in kale in the last few minutes of cooking.  I also use beef broth instead of the water and bouillon.

I first saw this recipe in a magazine and my husband likes it better than chili.  It is definitely a keeper for our family.

Delicious!!  I omitted the hamburger and used homemade salsa instead of the Rotel tomatoes.   I will make this again very soon!

This recipe brought back memories of my grandmother and her ever present pot of beans or peas.  Tasted great - just substituted ground venison for the beef.  This will be making it into our family meal rotation.

As the only southern in my home, I forgot to cut the recipe in half. Now I am glad I didn’t. The only thing I change is that I didn’t use ground beef. Who’d have thought that using bullion and molasses would make such a difference? Wow! Next time I will put in another 2 cups of water. The soup/essence is incredible!

This is really easy and makes enough for an army.  I was within a 1/2 inch from the top of my dutch oven.  Warms up very well.  Freezes nicely also. I made it exactly as stated...no need to change up on perfection.  :)

Absolutely delicious.  Made the recipe as written with the small exception of using frozen black eyed peas instead of canned.  This will go into my rotation of quick and easy wintertime recipes.  Fantastic!
