This was pretty good. I don’t have an instant pot so I mixed it all into an oven proof glass bowl and popped it into the oven at 350’. Every so often I checked it and stirred it up. It was in the oven for about 45 minutes. It’s a very thick, chunky cheese sauce and it has a pleasant taste to it.

I made this exactly by the recipe, and loved it.  The cherry tomatoes was a great addition to the taste.  I wondered if one could substitute the artichoke hearts with spinach?  It's a keeper!  (It's obvious a printing error was made about the ham in the instructions, but, surely people can figure that out)?  No big deal.

Still haven't figured out what pizza in the name has to do with anything.  I left out the  ham (there is no call to add it in the instructions anyway) and the artichoke hearts eliminating a lot of the sodium.   At that point it made a tasty spread for crackers.
