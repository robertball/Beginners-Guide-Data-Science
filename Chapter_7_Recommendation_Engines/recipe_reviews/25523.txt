I would give this 5 stars if it didn't say "crockpot", if you are gonna make this in 30 minutes (one hour is better), use a dutch oven or big skillet, cover, put it on low (not simmer) and you will be in kielbasa heaven, in an hour! I serve this with buttered noodles or rice.  If you are using a slow cooker, do it in the morning, put it on low, it will be perfect in 5-6 hrs!

As far as good, easy recipes go, it's hard to top this one - after a few changes. I find the sauce way too sweet as is. I add extra Worcestershire and lemon juice. I also add a few spoonfuls of minced garlic. This recipe makes plenty of sauce for 2 pounds of kielbasa.

YUMMY!!! I used about 4 tbs. butter and 2 Tbs. of vinegar instead of the lemon juice. WOW!!! This smelled fantastic. Towards the end, I couldn't help myself and dipped chunks of bread in the sauce. Served over rice and had a salad to go with it. WONDERFUL!!

I added 2 tsp garlic powder, used only 3 TBSP butter, reduced the ketchup to 1 cup, used 2 TBSP apple cider vinegar in place of lemon juice, for the onions I used 2 slices of a vidalia 1/4 inch thick and spread the rings around the pan, and for the last 10 minutes of cooking time I added carrots (peeled and sliced at an angle to make ovals) and pre-cut broccoli both of which I had already steamed. I served this all over quick cook white rice and it was fantastic! There was a fight for who was getting the leftovers for lunch the next day!

I found that if you don't have lemon juice, you can substitue with vinegar.  1 teaspoon of lemon juice = 1/2 teaspoon of vinegar.  :)  Hope that helps!

Thank you for sharing this recipe and thank you to all the reviewers for your input! I sliced the kielbasa thinly and fried in a pan with a 1/3 cup of diced green pepper, a half cup of chopped onion and thinly sliced fresh garlic until the veggies were soft. I set this aside and began on the sauce. Following others advice, I used only 1 cup of ketchup, 2 tbsp of butter, omitted the water and added 1 cup of crushed pineapple with the juice. I also added a tbsp. of flour to thicken a bit. When the sauce was done, I added the kielbasa with veggies back in. Oh my! The taste is soooo good. I served on a bed of yellow rice. I was looking for a tasty way of adding zip to my kielbasa.  Try this and you won't go wrong!

I followed this recipe to a T, and it was just not at all what I expected.  The ketchup was too overwhelming and that's just pretty much all I tasted.  And the cooking time of thirty minutes in a slow cooker on low, was not enough time. I suggest cooking it for a bit longer.

I'll give this a 3-1/2 stars. A big, big waste of ketchup. Much, much, too much sauce. Or, another 1 to 2 pounds of kielbasa should be added.

Very good!  I cooked it on the stove, used less ketchup like someone suggested, but everything else was pretty much the same.  My kids loved it-even the picky one!  Served over rice.  Used two pounds of kielbasa, and still had more than enough sauce.

I added 2 pounds of sausage instead of the one pound called for as there was more then enough sauce to cover. Very tangy and very good. Sauce is great over mashed potatos.

This......was.....so.....awesome! (Read that with the sing-song awesomeness it was intended to have.) :) I did make a few changes as per some of the other other reviews. I used 2 packages of turkey kielbasa, only 1 cup of ketchup, only 4 tablespoons of Best Life Spread, and I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic. The rest remained the same. Put it in a large pot on the stove, brought it to a boil then simmered while the rice was cooking. When the rice was done, the kielbasa was done. And the sauce is most excellent on the rice! I also served sauteed bell peppers. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Super easy and delicious! Made exactly as is, the sauce is excellent! This is the way I've always made it, didn't think it was too ketchupy at all. This recipe makes A LOT of sauce, I made 2 lbs of kielbasa and it was good, probably would've been fine with 3 lbs. Next time I'm going to try using lil smokies and it will make it even easier! This went over very well at my potluck!

So in love with this recipe!  My 4 year old loves kielbasa (one of the few things he will eat) and I got sick of just frying it.  This was sweet and tangy and wonderful!  Read the other reviews to see substitutions.  Less ketchup, added gr peppers and pineapple.  YUM!

No offense intended. But this was the weirdest combination of ingredients I have ever put in one dish.  We all ate it and thought it was tasty, but I'll never make it again. Truly, no offense, I'm just more traditional, I guess. Hope the inventor doesn't hate me! I just joined and ahere I am giving a somewhat bad review.

Was easy to follow and turned out great. Definitely don't need the crock pot. Heat it up and reduce to a simmer on the stove for about an hour. I cut the Ketchup almost in half due to the amount of sauce it makes. Added additional package of kielbasa the 2nd time we made it as well.

I just made this for a potluck at work and I was given several compliments and these aren't guys who are known for their complimenting. The general consensus was "these are awesome" "can I have the recipe". To me they were just okay. I made 1 1/2 times the sauce and put in 3 kielbasas. There was more than enough sauce for at least 4. I simmered everything on top of the stove until the onions were tender and used the crockpot to keep it warm. Next time I think I'll start out with less water and add as needed. It was pretty soupy. I served them without pasta or rice.

This was really good. I served it on top of rice. Instead of two cups of ketchup, I only added one and then added three bay leaves, some rice vinegar (just a splash), sliced garlic and more worcestshire.  I also browned the kielbasa before putting in the cooker and then cooked it for an hour and a half.  It was heavenly!

I followed this recipe loosely since I already had my kielbasa, garlic, sauteed onions and mushrooms in the skillet. I added some ketchup, Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, honey, butter and pepper. It was mildly tangy served over cellentina pasta. Everyone had seconds. Thanks for this recipe!

I just cooked this for supper.  I've been waiting for the perfect chance to give it a try.  I made the recipe exactly as is. The sauce was so excessively sweet, it was difficult to eat more than a few bites.  Keep in mind that I LOVE anything sweet.  I love ketchup (I put ketchup on everything!).  I love brown sugar.  This was just far sweeter than is necessary.  IF (BIG IF) I were to make it again, I would cut the ketchup and brown sugar in half, and even then I just don't know.

This is an ok quick recipe. A lot of the ingredients I have on hand most of the time, so I've made it a few times when I was in a bind. My cousin makes an AMAZING sweet and sour kielbasa and I didn't have her recipe and thought it would be close, but really wasn't. The ketchup is a bit overpowering, so I added an extra pound of kielbasa and used a little over a cup of ketchup and cut the water in half. Also used half as much butter, didn't really see the need for 6 tbsp. Ok when you're in a bind, but not amazing.

This is pretty tasty, and super quick to put together. I did cut the sauce in  half , which I highly recommend doing because there was plenty, and we love extra sauce. Definitely serve this over rice or noodles, or if you want an appetizer, cut the the kielbasa into thick slices/chunks and that would be perfect. Thanks for sharing this different method of preparing kielbasa :)

I always try the recipe exactly as written then I review it. I could only give this recipe 2 stars one star is for taking the time to post the recipe that deserves at least 1 star. Like others said too much of a ketchup taste, too much sauce for the amount of kielbasa. I tweaked it when I made it again and realized I had an entire different recipe from this. Thank you for posting but for me this recipe just didn't cut it. But it did allow me to make one of my own that worked so much better for my family than this one.

Very delicious. I added white vinegar instead of lemon juice, some red bell pepper and fresh parsley leafs, over buttery white rice. I did not used measurements though i just eye balled everything.

Big hit at our summer pool party, this was the only thing eaten in its entirety!  I did add an extra pound of kielbasa and still had plenty of sauce, probably could have added even more!

Wow this was great and simple to make.
I changed to serving to four but still kept the one pound kielbasa. And I didnt have lemon juice so per another review I used vinegar (apple cider) and I simmered it on the stove top for about 45 mins.

This recipe was great!  I used turkey keilbasa; I found this made the meat very juicy, much better than pan frying!  I imagine this would be great for a potluck with 'lil smokies!  We served it over rice; it made a great sweet sauce for the rice!

I made this for dinner tonight with rice and it was AMAZING I was really surprised. This would be awesome on chicken, steak or anything really. I didn't use the crock pot I just cooked them slow in a cast iron pan on the stove. 
WE WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN

This just tastes like hotdogs with ketchup.  Not a meal.. but maybe an appetizer.. So in an effort to save this (so my husband would eat it, I dumped out part of the sauce and added a can of beer and boiled the sausage for about 30 min.  It has a much better flavor now!!

This was a good recipe for a fast dinner. I read some of the reviews and followed what they said I used 2lbs Kielbasa and soy sauce and I added pineapple also. My 8 year old didn't like the Kielbasa and my boyfriend didn't like the pineapple but they loved the sauce. I thought the sauce was a bit sweet and salty not sour. There was a lot of sauce left over.

I wouldn't say this was "amazing" for taste, but it was good and very easy to make with ingredients I have on hand.  This was a last minute dinner for us and worked out well.  I halved the sauce for 1 pound of kielbasa, and this was plenty of sauce!  I made the sauce according to the recipe except I used dried minced onion and added some garlic powder. I made this on my stove, brought it all to a boil, added about one tbsp corn starch to thicken it up and voila!  Done in about 30 minutes exactly.  Served over white rice.  Note* my bf said this would be a 5 star meal if it was a teeny less sweet and a little bit spicy. Thanks for the recipe!

My family thought this was awesome!!  I do agree with the other reviewers as it does make A LOT of sauce, I used 2 lbs of Kielbasa, I also added a bit of minced garlic as another reviewer suggested.  Great & Simple, I used the stove not slow cooker.

This sauce definitely is sweet and sour.  I halved the sauce and still put in 1 pound of keilbasa.  I also left out the brown sugar and added in some garlic.  I prepared everything the night before then simmered on the stove for an hour when I got home.  Served over rice.  I was so so on it--but keilbasa isn't my favorite.  Bf liked it a lot.  Bf said I gave him too much sauce but he ate it all minus a bit of the sauce.  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I did was to cut down a little on the ketchup (based on prior reviews) and it turned out perfect. I cooked a little longer in the crock pot and the meat was so tender. Served with brown rice & a tossed salad. Will definately make again, maybe next time will try meatballs and kielbasa!

This recipe is a keeper!   I didn't have much ketchup left, so I only wound up using about 3/4 of a cup, but it turned out to be the perfect amount. Instead of using a crock pot, we just simmered them covered in a sauteing pan for about a half an hour.  I served them over rice with chopped carrots and broccoli.  It was absolutely delicious, and I will be making this again often, keeping the ketchup at 3/4 cup.

This was a nice change from just normal kielbasa sausage.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  Like others, there was a lot of sauce.  I was pleased with the flavor and consistency.  Will make again.

I have made this recipe many times. Sometimes using kielbasa, and sometimes using cocktail wieners. Both are very good and great for parties. I throw it all in the crock pot to simmer and can never make enough. People gobble them up! When I want to change it from a 4 star to a 5 star recipe, I add prepared horseradish to the mix. It gives it a perfect taste and thickens it as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this the other night for myself and the hubby.  I served it over white rice and with grilled corn on the cobb.  I cut the ketchup amount in half after reading other reviews and it was still extremely saucy/soupy, HOWEVER, the taste was great!  It didn't have an overwhelming sweet or sour taste, I thought it was just right.  Maybe next time I'll just add another lb of sausage to the mix to take away some of that "soupiness"

Thank you for this recipe everyone loved it.  The only changes I made were for health reasons.  Splenda brown sugar & smart balance for the butter.  No children but my fussy 97 yr old mother said, "I'm glad I didn't die before I had that to eat".

We thought this was very good.  I only used 1 cup of ketchup and 2 pounds of kielbasa.  Everything else I did exactly as written.  I will make this again but next time try ommitting the water and putting in crushed pineapple instead.  We ate this as an appetizer but it would be good with rice as a meal.

This is JUST like a dish I had back when I was 15, and have tried until now to find something that would "match the taste in my mind"! I did this on the stove, simmering for about an hour, and used turkey smoked sausage instead of kielbasa. I also added about 1/2 cup of diced green pepper and an 8 oz can of pineapple chunks (with juice). Served it over rice and it was sooo good!!

We really, really liked this!  It was very flavorful.  We used turkey kielbasa and served it over brown rice.  I did half the recipe for the sauce and still had plenty for 1 lb and was running tight on time so cooked it for about a half hour on the stove.  Will try it in the crockpot next time.  Thank you!

This was awesome! The first time I followed this recipe exactly. It was a swimming in ketchup. The second time I kinda "eyed" it and it came out perfect! I find myself craving this one some days!

My whole famiy LOVED this, and it's so easy to make! I add 1 T. of minced garlic, slice up the kielbasa (I've also used German Sausage, yummy!) and threw it all in a pan. I cook it longer, about an hour minimum, and on the stove. I serve it with pan fried potatoes. Wonderful!

I cooked this in my slow cooker on low for 6 hours. It made the sausage so tender, and the sauce turned out excellent. So easy to make, and tasty to boot!

Unfortunately, like some of the previous reviews, I found this was heavy on ketchup flavor even though I cut the ketchup in half. Just so so. It was ok for me but the family didn’t care for it

I really liked this a lot.  The only thing I changed was that I first cooked the kielbasa in some simmering water to get some of the fat out before adding it to the sauce mixture.  I also halved the sauce recipe because I didn't need all that extra sauce for 1 pound of sausage.  And, finally, I cooked it all in a pot over the stove because it only needed to cook for 30 minutes over medium heat, not in the crock pot.  Worked great!

This is the perfect kielbasa recipe. My children and husband are always asking for seconds. I follow the recipe as is and typically serve it over rice, although it is yummy with egg noodles, too. Definitely a must-try!

It was delicious,  but was still cold after the 30 minute cooking time on low in the slow cooker as stated. Since dinner was running late I dumped  it into a saucepan until thoroughly heated.

This is a recipe I will definitely make again. The only thing I would do is half all the ingredients that are in the sauce, add cider vinegar instead of lemon juice, and add two tsp of garlic. And it is also way easier to just brown the onions and sausage in a pan, then add in the sauce instead of putting it in the crockpot.

I liked it and will make it again, but as another reviewer stated, there was a lot of ketchup!  I had to add more Worcestershire, brown sugar and lemon juice.  Next time I will cut the ketchup in half.  Also, I thought 1/2 c water was a lot, so I will cut back on that as well.  Also, may be important to state that I cooked it in the oven at 350, covered with foil for 1 hr.

This was very good!  I had took the advise and used 1 cup  of ketchup and instead of 1/4 cup of brown sugar,  added three tablespoons of it and 1/4 cup of coca cola instead of water. I sliced thin carrots,  onions,  green peppers,  and  garlic and sautéed in butter.  Then added the sausages and mixture.  At first I taste nothing but ketchup but after simmering for an hour....the taste was great.  I can definitely add this to my comfort food list.

I really enjoyed this recipe, though I made a few minor tweaks. I tried it once before and got horrible results, since I did as directed and put WAY too much ketchup. I usually try to do a recipe to the T before I mess with it, but the first time it was just overpowering. This is what I did this time: I fried an onion on the stove first in a little butter. Then I tossed the kielbasa in there, adding a bit of brown sugar to it as well. It coated it in a crunchy, sweet coating. Then, I added about a fourth cup ketchup and a half lemon into the crock pot, along with a pinch of salt. Then I did the rest as the recipe said. It was so much better this way, I really enjoyed it!

I used the base recipe, and added more Worcestershire, a teaspoon of minced garlic, and the crowning touch, a tablespoon of Sriracha hot chili sauce. I also put in 2 lbs of kielbasa and had plenty of sauce left over. My husband poured some out into a bowl and used it as a dipping sauce for the rolls we had with dinner. Yummy! This one's a keeper in our house.

I added a green pepper and simmered on the stove for 30 minutes instead of a crock pot. I can't see how it would be ready so quickly in a crock pot anyways. I also reduced the butter to 3tbs. Next time I think I will omit it altogether or at least cut it down to one tbs. Its packed with flavor and all the butter seems to do is add fat and calories. Perfect served over rice!

This recipe was SO easy! I just cooked it on the stove though and I didn't use any onion. It turned out delicious! I served it with steamed white rice. MMM MMM!

Eating this for dinner tonight, just waiting for my rice to finish cooking. I love kielbasa and this is good recipe if your looking to try something different. I did change it up a little bit and followed others suggestions. I cooked my kielbasa on the stove for an hour. I only used 1 cup of tomato sauce(i'm out of ketchup!) and only 4 tbs of butter an 2 tbs of viniger. No lemon juice and added an extra tbs of worchestor sauce an extra tbs of brown sugar. I forgot to reduce the amount of water so my sauce is thin but it still tastes great! I will definetly make again :)

This recipe was just "ok" for me.  However, I believe that I cooked it for too long.  I may try it again in my dutch oven when I can supervise it better than leaving it in the crock pot while away on errends.

This meal is a fast solution for a piece of Kielbasa you don't know what to do with.  It's too sweet... and really only tastes like glorified ketchup.  We followed all the 5-star recommendations and this was a VERY mediocre meal.  Compared with all the other meals on allrecipes.com which have recieved 4 and 5 stars, this is at best a 2 star meal.  It's edible, I'm not hungry... end of story.

This is a good recipe.  I put mine in the slow cooker for about 5 hours and it was great. I also cut the sauce in half because everyone was saying there was so much sauce.  It was plenty.  I ran out of ketsup so I was only able to use 1/2 a cup rather than a full cup.  I will probably use that same amount next time.  Served over mashed potatoes with carrots and broccoli and it was a great meal!

I thought this was great... I try to cook with kielbasa but it is never wonderful to me but with this recipe it was.  I poured it over jasmine rice and I altered the recipe a little to what I had.  I didn't have brown sugar so I used 3 tbs of splenda with 2 tbs of honey, I also added minced garlic and 1 tbs of balsamic vinegar.  I didn't use onion because i didn't have one but I don't think it needed it anyways.  Definitely worth a try!

Thought it sounded sweet and left out the sugar and added 1 tsp of garlic powder.  It still came out way too sweet - next time I will do 1/2 the ketchup.

This recipe was delicious! I had to use regular sugar and molasses since I was out of brown sugar, but it all worked out just the same! Highly recommended recipe for a twist on Kielbasa.

Made this the other night for dinner and my 17 month old gobbled it up and my husband said "I like this better than any other way you made kielbasa before"  I did use only 1 cup ketchup as others suggested, and put it over egg noodles. I will definately make it again soon

This was delicious! I only made a few minor changes to it. I followed the advice of others and substituted the lemon juice with apple cider vinegar--which really brought out the tanginess! I also added a 8 oz can of pineapple chunks and used 2 turkey kiebasa links (1 package).  I slow cooked it on high for a couple of hours and served it over rice.  The sauce was sweet and tangy and absolutely fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent! Per other reviewers suggestions, I doubled the ketchup, added a tsp. of minced garlic, chopped up a whole sweet onion (small), used cider vinegar instead of lemon juice, replaced the water with an 8 oz. can of pineapple chunks and their juice and increased the kielbasa to 2 lbs. Prepared this as a meal and served it over mashed potatoes (using the yummy sauce as a gravy). Will make again and again this way - the whole family loved it.

This tastes good but takes FOREVER in the slow cooker after an hour and 1/2 I gave up and I just cooked it in a pan on the stove then added the sauce and let it simmer for awhile.

Wow! This is so sweet and yummy! Not so much sour. Next time maybe I will add a little more lemon juice. I would have given it five stars but the hubby didn't care to much for it but the rest of the family did, my sister even wanted to take the left overs home for lunch.This is definitely a keeper! Thanks!

I hate to not try a recipe as written, but I deviated from this recipe by eliminating the water, lemon juice, and butter.  Instead I added a can of pineapple rings and the juice.  I cooked it in the crock pot for about 5-6 hours and served with parmesan risotto.  It was delicious!

This was a decent meal, with rice cooked in the sauce (added extra water).  It's more "sweet" than any "sour."  Flavor is okay.

This was not the right flavor for me.  The ketchup stands out too much and it is too sweet.  To me this tasted like a not very good barbecue sauce.

This was very good. My two year old even ate it and he doesn't usually eat a lot of meat. I served it over mashed potatoes and doubled the recipe so we could have leftovers. It was even good reheated. Thanks for a tasty recipe that was easy to make.

I found this recipe to be far more mediocre than I anticipated.  I tried this as a main course and would definitely use two pounds of kielbasa next time as I had a ton of sauce leftover.  I thought the sauce was taste less like ketchup than it did, this was still the predominant taste.  I didn't mind this recipe, but probably won't make it again.
