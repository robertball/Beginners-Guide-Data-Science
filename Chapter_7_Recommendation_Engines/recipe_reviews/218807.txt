This recipe turned out really well for me.  I used liquid egg whites, but I did use regular sugar, as I didn't have any substitute on hand.  I used about 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I made my own spice blend of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, mace, and I forgot the cloves, but it still turned out great!

Warning:  when I mixed it up, I thought it was too runny.  In fact it made too much mix and I had to dump some of it out so it would fit in the pie pan.  I may try cutting back on the evaporated milk (maybe using 1/2 the can) next time.  It baked well, though:  I did the first 30 minutes uncovered, then draped a piece of foil over it.  I think I ended up cooking it another 30 minutes before I took it out.  It still wasn't quite set, but it set while it rested.  My pie crust was a standard recipe that I use for all of my pies (I got it from The Pioneer Woman's blog, her Pam's Pie Tutorial).
