Simple and perfect, basic vinaigrette with the correct ratio, in my opinion, of oil to vinegar - about three parts oil to one part vinegar. Many vinaigrettes call for way too much vinegar which tends to overshadow, rather than lightly dress, the greens. This is also good using balsamic vinegar, or using a combination of vinegar and lemon juice. Nice dressing!

Perfect!  I cut the recipe in half and can't wait to experiment with honey mustard or balsamic vinegar.  Very versatile recipe!

Nice dressing. Proportionally, I added about 1/4 t white pepper and 1/2 t or less sea salt.  I also cut the dijon down just a bit.

This is an excellent recipe, as written.  I'm a spice freak, so the second time around, I added 2 tsp minced onion flakes, 2 tsp celery salt, and used Jack Daniel's Horseradish mustard (as that was what I had on hand).  As the writer indicated, you can adjust garlic, salt and pepper to taste.  I added part white pepper and part black pepper, & minced garlic (adjusting accordingly.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Monica!!!

Very easy to put together with just a few ingredients.  It was a little tangy but tasted even better the next day.  Will make again.

Great garlicky flavor!  The only thing I modified was the oil content...I used 2/3c.  I have used this on a great salad with beets, lentils and feta, as well as blanched green beans and tomatoes...very tasty!

it was great i loved the flavor, i did not have enough extra virgin olive oil so i had to use a little bit of both extra and regular olive oil i don't know if that caused the dressing to be too oily or not but the flavor was great so i'll probablly adjust the ratios a bit

Perfect vinaigrette for a light salad! The vinegar and dijon mustard adds the kick I like in a dressing! You could even do a 1:1 ration with the oil and vinegar for a lighter version :)

Pretty good; I guess I'm just not a huge fan of Dijon mustard.  I like the vinegar:olive oil ratio--I was taught to use three oil to one vinegar while growing up.

As written, we didn't like this much, and we're not very picky about salad dressings. I had to add a good bit of honey to it before we could tolerate it; it was just too sour before! I wanted to like it; sorry :(

I LOVE this dressing.  It's the only dressing I've eaten in the past few months b/c I'm hooked on it! The flavor of the honey mustard blended with the garlic gives it very unique and satisfying flavor.  A++!

This is a good and easy recipe.  I cut down the oil by 1/3 cup and added some flat leaf parsley b/c it was use it or lose it.  I used it to drizzle over mixed, steamed veggies.  A Keeper!

Awesome! Added another clove of garlic and did a 1:1 ratio of the vinegar and EVOO. PERFECT for my sandwiches and salads!!
