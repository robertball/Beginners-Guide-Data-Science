Suprisingly, I had to add a lot of additional spices to give it some more taste.  It was very bland despite the beer.  I would also use grnd pepper, rather than the peppercorns, as no one really wants to bite down on a spoonful of those.  Also, I recommend using a larger dish, as my 3qt dish was overflowing before I finished adding all the ingredients. Although it did smell great while cooking, I won't be making this again.

Nice easy recipe.  I also added some Worcestershire sauce to the gravy for the second night re-heats.  Serve with pasta or rice to make it go further.

Easy! I did add a little cornstarch to thicken. My family loved it and it's all gone.

sorry, this was really bad! I've cooked with beer (and wine) before, but this was way too much beer taste for me! i ended up dumping out the broth and starting again. i will not make this recipe again.

Bland.  And not a stew but soup consistency.  Won’t make again.  There is NO seasoning in this recipe and I even added some of my own.   Nope

I think I might have liked this better had I added other spices.  I also didn’t like the flavor the beer added to the soup,. Or the whole peppercorns.  No one likes to bite into a while peppercorn.

This was pretty good. I made a few changes-used only one beer and ground up the peppercorns, added 1/2 cup beef broth in exchange for the beer. I also added garlic powder after trying this stew-it needed a little more taste.
