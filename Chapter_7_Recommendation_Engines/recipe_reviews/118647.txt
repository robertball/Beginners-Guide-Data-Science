I used more potatoes, maybe because mine were small--eight organic reds. I used my own homemade ranch dressing mix and I warmed my milk before using it. I didn't use the whole cup, just under. These were good, but I think it could use a spoonful of sour cream. It paired well with Mozzerella Meat Loaf and broccoli salad.

Loved them.  I used boiled potatoes and mashed them and didn't measure the butter or milk, just added to get the right consistency and then stirred in seasoning mix.  Made them with herb rubbed sirloin tip roast from this site and the potatoes were so good nobody used the gravy!!

Delicious! Plus it's a great way to perk up regular 'ol mashed potatoes!  I used red potatoes (more than called for) left the skins on and just eyeballed the milk and butter until I got the consistency I wanted.  Another quick and easy way to use Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix!

I haven't made this exact recipe, but I make one very similiar that's awesome!  I peel and boil potatoes, then mix in 4 oz cream cheese, butter, milk, and the ranch seasoning, and then whip until smooth!  Very yummy : )

This was my first time making homemade mashed potatoes. I'm usually a box person but I thought what the hey. This recipe came out fabulous. I put in 2 packs of the hidden valley and I didn't measure the butter or milk just poured to my preference and whipped them with my hand mixer. It came out awesome. My husband and children loved them. I served with pot roast and gravy. Thanks for the idea!

This was a very quick side dish to whip up at the last minute. I thought it was a bit dry but my family loved it and even my mom wanted the recipe to use for Easter dinner. I topped with ranch dressing and baco bits for a creamier flavor.

The kids (12, 10) gave it 5 stars. I loved that it was so quick. I used 6 red (new) potatoes and nuked for 8 mins, which was perfect. I added 1 cup milk and 3 tbsp homemade ranch dressing mix from AR; served with After Work Pot Roast. Keeper!

Very good, did not wow but did not disappoint either. The full packet of ranch added too much tang for me. Would definitely try again maybe use 1/2 packet.

We liked the flavor of these - it was a nice change from regular mashed potatoes.  My only problem with this recipe was it seemed pretty dry.  Next time I'll add more milk.

If you like ranch and mashed potatoes, these are for you.  My husband said he'd give them 9/10, but we can't give half stars. I boiled my potatoes in chicken stock instead of microwaving them.  Also used sour cream plus a little water instead of milk (ran out).  These were quite good, but I'm still stuck on creamy garlic mashed 'taters.

I used a two ounce package of ranch, but didn't think the potatoes tasted ranch-y at all. I had to add a splash more milk and more butter for the amount of potatoes I ended up with.

Made according to the recipe, it is way too strong.  This would be good with double the potatoes.

I made these to go with dinner tonight. At first I thought the ranch seasoning was a little strong, but then I started to like them more as I ate them. I didn't have a 1 oz packet but a larger container of seasoning, so I used 2 1/2 tblsp. of the seasoning. I liked how quick and easy they were to make in the microwave and no messy pot and water. I did lighten them up with whipped butter and low fat milk. The only down side is they were a little too salty, but I have that issue with all seasoning packets. I have seen recipes on here for homemade ranch powder, I may have to try one now.

This was an amazing recipe for delicious mashed potatoes! It was extremely easy, and I served it with a marinated pork tenderloin. It was the first mashed potatoes that I have made for my fiancee and they were a hit! Very rich flavor, and these will definitely become a staple in my weekly menus! Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

Very tasty taters.  These went great with our ranch meatloaf.  I like the fact that they didn't have a lot of added fat. I used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup low fat sour cream just to make these creamier.  The sour cream added a little more flavor as well.  Great recipe!
