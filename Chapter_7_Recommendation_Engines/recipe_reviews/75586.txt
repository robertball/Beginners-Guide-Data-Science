This was really kind of inedible and tasteless.  I probably won't make this again.  I had to make a separate recipe for my husband because he doesn't like mayo or sour cream.

Very good.  I like the taste of this a lot better than regular green bean casserole.  I used canned snap beans but followed everything else exactly.  Very delcious.

wow made this for Mother's day along with roast beef, and there is nothing left.  Wasn't really measuring the beans or the cheese just poured in until it looked like enough.  Used frozen whole beans too and it worked great.  We will use this again and again

My family really liked this. As usual I made some changes due to time and pantry limitations. First I used 2 cans of drained green beans, 3/4 of a cup of chopped yellow onions and one link (6 oz) of smoked sausage chopped, 1 cup plain Greek yogurt with a pinch of sugar,(as a sub for the sour cream) 1/3 cup miracle whip and 1/2 to 3/4 cup shredded cheese.   I dumped it all together in a casserole dish, laid some triangles of sliced cheese on the top and baked it for 30 minutes at 350. As you can tell I'm a shortcut cook and while that doesn't always work this came out great. I think I could have gone with only 1/2 a link of smoked sausage, it was a dominant flavor, but still delicious! I think this was a great dish and very forgiving, also the addition of herbs might give this a whole different character. Thank you so much for a good solid side dish!

This was great. Everyone loved it. Were big green bean fans in this house. I love the bacon grease mixture. I'm a big fat and grease user.

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner this year and I got many compliments.  Everyone loved it!  I used 2 cans of green beans and I doubled the bacon.  It is a nice change from the condensed soup version.

I made this for a potluck for the holiday weekend and got many positive comments.  I added the topping from Grandma's Green Bean Casserole (also on this site) to give it something extra special.  I added some seasonings to the green bean mixture...garlic powder & onion powder.  I will make this one again.

Yummy!  I substituted non-fat plain greek yogurt for the sour cream and mayo, used turkey bacon and no onion (family preference).  Even my toddlers who hate green beans ate these!

This was really good. I didn't have enough sour cream so I used some cream cheese, and omitted the green onions, so it isn't exactly the same. It was simple, but I think it took a little longer in the oven than stated. I like that it is also Keto friendly. I will definitely be saving this recipe and making it again.

I used yellow onion instead of green onion. I also used about 3 times as many green beans as the recipe called for. I replaced the sour cream and mayonaise with plain greek yogurt. I didn't follow the directions to the T for the green beans to be cooked for 1 minute, so they came out a tad crunchy. not much, but enough. also, all i tasted was the yogurt. nothing else. 
I will make it again, but i need to mess with it.
