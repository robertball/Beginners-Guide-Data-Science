"Not too mild but not too hot" is the perfect description for these. Great as written. Tip: instead of dropping the wings in the sauce and flipping, place your done wings in a large bowl, pour sauce over them, and toss to coat.

It's the best sauce for hot wings, not to hot, but very tasty.Bill from Stony Plain, Alberta.
