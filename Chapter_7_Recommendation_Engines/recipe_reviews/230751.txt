Lots of leftovers on this one. Too much cinnamon and cardamom. I was smart enough to cook the rice separately. Even so, it needed more moisture.

I used Brussels sprouts and a brown rice/quinoa blend. Very tasty, don't be afraid of the smoked paprika, it works very well, all 1 1/2 tsp of it!

The cup of rice is supposed to be COOKED rice - just an FYI so you don't spend as much time as we did trying to figure that out.

We used venison in place of the beef.

This is very flavorful and hearty. We've tried it with the rice mixed in and on the side and like it both ways.

Wonderful! Wasnâ€™t sure what 5 black cardamom seeds meant because my cardamom came in husks and there were 8 or 10 little black seeds in each husk. So I probably put too much cardamom but it was still delicious!!

This was excellent and I used leftover roast beef instead of the ground beef! My husband loved it and it didn't take that long to make either. I served it over brown rice to my husband, but I try to limit my carbs so I just ate the stew because it had enough sweet potatoes in it. I will make it again!
