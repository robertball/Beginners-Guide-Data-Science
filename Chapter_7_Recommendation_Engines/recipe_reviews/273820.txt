I love to be able to put ingredients in a slow cooker and come home after a busy day to a great meal! These fajitas were delicious. I realized I had used my canned tomatoes already, so I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes and omitted the jalapeño pepper. My husband added chopped jalapeños to his, but I’m a heat wimp and didn’t add them to mine. I did need to add a little more salt than what was called for.

Pretty dang Good! Thank you for sharing Your recipe.  We added 1/2 juice from a  lime. Drained off the juices before serving- Gone in 30 minutes! Ill make this again with a couple minor modifications. Add lime again and zest of 1 lime- personal preference.

Made it today (11/4/19) just as the recipe stated.  Absolutely mouth watering.   Everyone devoured it, including kids.  My husband also had it on a delicious fresh roll and it was great.  Highly recommend.  

I saw one review saying the tomatoes turned it into a soggy mess.  It was definitely a very líquidy consistency but I got a strainer spoon and strained it before putting it on the tortillas.

I would definitely recommend placing them on a cookie sheet and broiling them for 20 to 30 minutes to add a crispiness to the meal. JUST SAYING

I made this recipe. However, I used Beef fajita meat that’s seasoned, added my own seasonings I like & that I got from our City Market. I also chose to slightly sauté my bell peppers and onions and then add them to the meat. I also am not a huge fan of flour tortillas, so I put the mixture over rice and my family absolutely loved it. I already had this idea in mind. But, the slow cooker option makes the meat more tender. Thanks for the slow cooker idea

It was good, a little bland.  Thinking next time to sauté the onion and peppers first to bring out more favor.  Maybe a second jalapeño too as the one I used was not that big.  Overall though it made a cheaper cut of meat good.  I’ll try it again.

Could have used a bit more flavor but that could just be my personal preference since I like things with a kick..  I will add Rotel instead of the chopped tomatoes next time and see if that adds the little extra I am looking for.

These had a decent flavor,but it wasn't something I want to try again,due to the heavy broth in the slow cooker that some would claim is the 'cats pajamas.' However the method of crockpot fajitas just didn't do it for us. I might try another reviewer suggestions and crisp the fajita meat in the broiler,or my cast iron skillet than place the meat in the slow cooker. I'm on the fence on this one!

I followed the recipe precisely. The fajitas were bland and the vegetables were over cooked.

Good lord! If you had asked me yesterday "what is the most labor intensive way to ruin a steak?" i would not know how to answer. But as i loaded beautiful pieces of flank steak into the crockpot it felt wrong. The end result was unappealing. I did not care for this recipe at all.

My whole family enjoyed it. I was worried about it being too spicy so I left out Jalapeño pepper & added more chili powder. My daughter doesn’t like things too hot. Served on flour tortillas with refried beans & all the typical fajita sides. I just drained well before serving. Easy to make & I love the crockpot as my kids have different schedules with sports.

This was very delicious! I was worried about the peppers being too soggy but they weren't. It was the perfectly blended amount of flavor and texture. I will definitely make this easy recipe again. It was a huge hit in my home.

This recipe was just okay for me, and that is after I followed the advice of some other reviewers and did not add the tomatoes.  The recipe just didn’t have the taste of grilling that sets fajitas apart.

Flavours were fantastic and meat was tender but the whole dish was far too runny for wraps. I ended up popping the left over mixture into small ramikins, adding grated cheddar on top and then topping with puff pastry.  As pies , it was delicious  and j in would make it as a pie filling again but not as a filling in wraps

I didn't use the canned tomatoes and they were not missed.  We had fresh cubed tomatoes to add as we were make our fajitas.  Served with sour cream, shredded cheese and Guacamole. The only thing I found off putting about the recipe was the liquid, dripping into my plate.  Glad I didn't add the canned tomatoes. Next time I will drain the fajitas out of the liquid before servicing.
