Wonderful drink, I make it just a bit different though. I use 1 oz each of orange juice, coconut rum, and creme de banana. I also use about 2 big tbs coconut cream and about 1 1/2 oz peach schnapps. I thinks it tastes better this way but I am incredibly happy I have this recipe.

My only complaint with this drink is that it makes a very small amount. I had to double the recipe to fill my highball glass. That said, I made it a double and enjoyed every drop of this drink.

We didn't have any orange juice or banana liquor, so I improvised with the juice of a couple cuties/clementines and a couple inches of fresh banana. I increased the peach schnapps a bit to make up for the loss of alcohol from the lack of banana liquor, and it was still a nice strong drink. Cuties don't give off very much juice, so it definitely would have been good with more o.j. I think the fresh banana instead of a banana liquor gave it a nice refreshing flavor though. And I just poured it over ice, since I don't like crushed ice drinks. (So basically, I didn't follow the recipe at all, and it was delicious.)
