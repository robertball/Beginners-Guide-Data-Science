I thought it was good, as did my husband.  My 18m old daughter loved it!  I made a few subs based on what I had on hand (ie: 12oz tri-color rotini, 24oz jar spaghetti sauce) and I added some chopped onion and garlic powder to the meat, and it came out fine.  Maybe a little dry, but still good.  Perhaps next time I'll cover with foil for 15-20 minutes, then uncover for the last few minutes.  I think I'll make it again!  Oh - I also recommend spraying the baking dish with non-stick spray to ease clean up.

I made a few changes, I used ricotta cheese in the middle and spaghetti for the pasta. A new favorite for me and my husband.  So good and so easy to do!

Very good as written.  Quick, filling, and pleasing.  Add a tossed salad and garlic toast for a great and easy meal.  I've used ham, pepperoni, sausage as meat variations; used ricotta, cottage cheese, mild cheddar for cheese variations; and salsa for sauce variations. A handy go-to recipe.  Thanks for the idea and inspiration LaDonna!

I thought this recipe was great. I always use some basic seasonings on my ground beef (cumin, oregano, chili powder, and garlic) and it added some extra good flavor. I also added some sliced olives that we had on hand, and it added a nice touch. It was also very quick and easy to prepare for a family of 6!

I ended up using a container of cottage cheese that I had decided I would never eat for the middle layer and a few handfuls of shredded cheddar on top since we didn't have mozzarella on hand. I also put a can of basil, garlic and oregano chunky tomatoes in with the beef after it was cooked through and let it simmer and reduce before adding the spaghetti sauce. It turned out amazing! My husband loved it and said it's better than regular lasagna! That's an excellent review from him!

Very easy and tasty. I used penne pasta instead (on hand) and  added onions, fresh garlic and some other spices to the meat/sauce mixture.  Served with garlic bread. My husband loved it.

This was easy, fast, and delicious.  I had everything on hand already and wanted a quick meal that was "homemade" and not out of a box.  I did add some garlic and onions to the meat for more flavor, but other than that followed the recipe.  Thanks for the post...a definate keeper.

I make this all the time, we call it spagetti ghoulash. But never thought about baking it with with mozzarella cheese. I didnt have rotini, so I used small elbow noodles. It's a total please on those nights where you just don't want to make spagetti sauce from scratch and this is a quick fix.

I added minced garlic, chopped onion, and a variety of other spices to the meat.  I used a combination of cheddar and mozzarella since I didn't have enough of the mozzarella.  I think it would have turned out better with Italian sausage or pepperoni added to the meat.  Another reviewer suggested adding ricotta cheese to the middle layer, which would definitely have improved this casserole.

I've been basically making this same casserole off and on for years.  It's stick to your ribs satisfying, and something most everyone will enjoy.

It's fairly easy, even for the beginner cook and affordable.  Goes great with garlic bread and a salad.

HUGE portion!  Slight additions for flavor:  We browned ground beef with a bit of onions & added dried Italian spice mix.  Our family of 4 will be eating this for 2-3 meals (with sides of salad & biscuits).

We enjoyed this tasty, simple to prepare meal tonight. I served it with fresh steamed broccoli & whole grain bread rolls. Thank you for the recipe.

I made it as written. Next time I will include fresh onions & garlic during cooking the meat to give it flavor though. I will also try another reviewers suggestion of adding a layer of ricotta cheese in the middle.  My husband also requested lots more sauce next time, so I'll put two jars of emerils chunky marinara sauce, it was a bit dry with only one jar of sauce once it had baked & absorbed.

This recipe is GREAT! My husband and I both loved it! It'll definitely remain on the menu! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it came out a little dry! I just realized that the jar of spaghetti sauce I used was actually only 24oz though! Next time I'll use the 28oz jar or maybe even a little more!

Ummm...Yummm!!!  My whole family LOVED this, and it can feed an army!  With growing boys, that's a huge plus for us.  I took someone else's advice and put a layer of ricotta cheese in the middle (that's why I gave 4 stars instead of 5)...that really sealed the deal for us.  A lot like lasagna, but half the work.

I was very skeptical of this recipe due to the lack of spices and its simplicity...but I like to try the recipes the way they are written before I make any changes so...I cant believe it didnt need any spices! My entire family loved this and requested we have it instead of spaghetti or lasagna! 5 stars! (The only thing I would add is some diced tomatoes) :)

This turned out very well and tasted great. It was far better than I had expected. I seasoned the hamburger with some crushed red pepper, italian seasoning, garlic, and SeasonAll while it was browning. I ran out of Mozarella and used some shredded parmesan to make up the difference. Great easy recipe, thanks for sharing La Donna, this really doctored up jarred food and made it almost homemade.

The beef needs flavor. So we added half an onion in a skillet with 1tsp of garlic cooked til translucent, added the beef and 1 tblsp Adobe All Purpose seasoning.  That really added to the flavor to include adding garlic salt to the noodles for a bit of noodle flavor.  
A little on the dry side, we just added half a 14oz jar of water (to get all the sauce) and to wet it up a bit.  
Based on current recipe, we give it a 3.  After additions, we give it a 5.  Even our 5 year old enjoyed. Thanks LaDonna for putting this in our hands, we will definitely make this again.

Could use some more pizzazz, but still tasty. I think next time I'll add some garlic, onion, and bell pepper for a little extra flavor.

I really enjoyed this!  I did add some onion and garlic to my ground beef, and a little extra garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the spaghetti sauce (it was generic and I thought it needed something extra).  My daughter thought it would be better with a little more sauce.

4 stars for ease of prep and cook time! One of those recipes that doesn't take that long, as you can brown the beef and shred the cheese as you're waiting for the pasta to boil. I didn't have rotini so I used penne. I would recommend chopping onions and fresh garlic to cook with the beef, as it was a little on the bland side, but I like my foods to be really bursting with flavor. However, my test subjects (husband and friend) both loved it as it was. It also comes out looking good, like restaurant quality. It took a little longer than 25 minutes for baking but I just waited until the cheese was golden brown on the top layer. I also used a smaller casserole dish and had leftover pasta and beef for the next day as I didn't reduce the recipe amount.

This was a good recipe, but I made a few changes to make it great.  I added two jars of spaghetti sauce, as I could see it would have been too dry (as others have mentioned) with only one jar.  I also added three cloves of garlic and a bunch of onion to the ground beef.  I also added a few spices to the ground beef.  I put in a layer of cottage cheese as well.  Everyone raved about the end result.  I only gave the recipe four stars because I had to tweak it quite a bit.

Yum!  My family really liked this recipe.  I did a bit of tweaking it, though. I used pepper-jack and mozzarella for the middle layers, and mozzarella and cheddar for the top.  I am sure I used about 4 cups of cheese, as we love cheese in my house. I spruced up my spaghetti sauce with garlic, black pepper, and italian seasonings.  Even my super picky almost 2 year old liked it.

This is a great recipe that's quick and easy to make!  I only add some additional spices to my sauce to make it a bit more flavorful.  It takes well to freezing and re-heating.

I never thought I'd like such a simple recipe, but this was great! It is also a good base recipe to start with and then customize. This time I halved the meat and added an onion, used Colby-Jack cheese (all I had), and reduced the amount of rotini a bit. Next time I would add olives and mushrooms. This has endless possibilities! Thanks!

Yummy! Add a can of petite diced tomatoes to the pasta mixture. It was really good with "olive oil and garlic" pasta sauce. I used mini penne. A great way to change the look of regular old spaghetti! Don't forget the texas toast!!

Delicious recipe! Husband said it was like lasagna but better. I made a few additions by adding cottage cheese and feta to the middle layer. I also added a little of Worcestershire Sauce for a little more flavor.

This is an excellent fast dish to prepare. Instead of hamburger I used 1lb hot pork sausage and approximately 1/2 cup bacon bits. My family likes sauce so I substituted two cans sauce and baked in a 13x9 cake pan..mui bueno..delish!

A good, simple, meal with ingredients one typically has on hand. Definitely adding this to my list of regular meals. I added some parmesan cheese and garlic salt for a little more flavor; substituting homemade tomato sauce would probably be an awesome addition if time is available.

Very good basic recipe, I followed the other reviewers advise and added onions, bell pepper, garlic & mushrooms. I used the colby/monteray jack blend cheese for more flavoring and to the sauce beef mixture I also added 1 teaspoon of mustard (you don't taste it and it helps minimize the jar taste)

It's just ok!  My husband loved it though!  I sauteed onions and minced garlic then browned the ground beef.  I then followed the rest of the recipes' directions except I covered the dish with foil before putting it in the oven.  It still ended up being a little bland.  I am excited to see what it will taste like tomorrow - I am hoping some spices might have set in with it being refrigerated over night!  Either way, I will make it again because my husband really liked it!

Yum, that was about all we could say while eating!  I added onion & garlic to the ground beef while browning!  I didn't have any mozzarella cheese, so I used the bag of shredded Italian cheese I had.  I made it early in the day and put it into the fridge - with a lid on it, all mixed together.  Heated it up a little bit longer and we couldn't be happier!  What a simple and delicious meal!!!  Thank You LaDonna for sharing!

This will certainly be a go-to recipe, thank you! I made some adjustments and it was delicious! Instead of using spaghetti sauce I used fire roasted diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers and tri-color rotini. I added garlic, onion, and green peppers while browning the meat and a spice mix of onion salt, cumin, chili powder, paprika, and garlic powder. I took another suggestion to cover for the first 15 minutes of baking. I also included parmesan cheese with the mozzarella. This was really filling and delicious with LOTS of room to adjust for what I have on hand and didn't flavors!

After reading lots of reviews I took the advice of others and added different spices so it wouldn't be so bland. I added onions and garlic in with the hamburger and sprinkled chili powder over it as well. It ended up being a meal my husband and young girls liked.  It is a great replacement for spaghetti if you are looking to change up "pasta" night in your menu.  But my standards are pretty high so without the spices I added this wasn't a "five star" meal in my opinion. The other issue I had with this recipe is that it says "4 servings."  I should have looked at the dish it said to bake it in. Anything baked in a 3qt dish is not 4 servings! More like 8 servings.  But on the up side, we like leftovers so there you go!

I made this following some of the other reviewer's recommendations- I cooked onion and garlic with the beef and added Italian seasoning and pepper to the meat. The only cheese I had was one of those shredded multi-cheese things so I used that. I didn't use all of the noodles because it seemed like it was too much. It turned out very tasty- much better than I thought it would be after scrounging for ingredients that I had on hand. GREAT idea to make with whatever you have available.

With this one I added some chilli powder to the meat while cooking it and also a little to the sauce.  Instead of just mozzarella I used a mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  My family really liked it, very filling.

Like most others, I sauteed fresh garlic and onions.  Also, I used the very leanest beef but did not pour out the juices.  Tastes awesome.

This was fantastic!  Our baby is only six weeks old, so it's just me and my husband eating this casserole, and we ate it til it was gone (usually we'll have a serving as leftovers and then be done with whatever casserole it is, not the case with this one.)  A few things:  I used a mix of mini-wagonwheels and bow ties, didn't have rotini, and I liked the effect it had on the casserole and would do it again, i made 16 oz of pasta total and did not need nearly half of it, but my casserole dish (corningware) was a little less than 3 quarts.  Also didn't have enough mozzarella on hand, so i mixed in parmesan and some provolone, and on top  melted a few slices of white american (basically because i didn't have enough cheese otherwise, but it was really good)  This was a nice easy recipe that is easy to improvise with, and pleasantly different despite the somewhat common/few ingredients.  Give it a try!  Oh, i was also worried that one jar of sauce wouldn't be enough, but it was perfect, it didn't need to be very saucy.

I added diced onion, 2 cloves of fresh garlic, we like ours a little saucier so I used roughly 1.5 lbs ground *deer meat* and 1 26oz can of 4 cheese spaghetti sauce and 1/2 can of pizza sauce (all we had), cracked red pepper, salt, pepper, italian seasoning all to the meat sauce mixture and mixed in with the pasta. I used some mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese and parmasean cheese for the layers as well. This was delicious! I have 4 very picky kids and 3 out of the 4 actually ate this very well. My 2 year old had 3 plates!! Goes great with garlic bread and brocoli with cheese!! We will definitely have this again!!

I added a layer of fresh baby spinach in the middle. So YUMMY. Then I got a little more creative and added smashed corn tortilla chips. Even better! Thanks for the easy recipe!

Quick and easy! This was so simple and a nice change from regular spagetti. We call it Spatini in our house since you use rotini noodles.

Very good family dish.  Both the kids and the hubby loved it.  I made it as it's written and it's very easy to do.  Has the potential for lots of variations as you could add just about anything that your family really likes.

Made it for my family since I don't eat meat but we have ground beef in abundance since my side of the family raises it (go figure LOL).  It was super easy and cheap (which is a big huge plus in our house!)  And the meat eaters gobbled it up.  They said it was a huge change from the burgers and hamburger helper.  :)

Very easy.  Very tasty.  I used small elbow macaroni, that's what I had in the pantry.  I didn't use a full jar of spaghetti sauce, I had about 3/4 of jar in the fridge that I wanted to use up, flavor didn't suffer.  VERY GOOD!

Used 1/2 the noodles but just a bit less of everything else. Added Lawrys seasoning salt to hamburger. Plenty of cheese. We liked it; will make it again.

Made exactly as the recipe.  I would make it again but would make some changes.  I would half the pasta next time (or double the meat) and add some more flavours, perhaps a few dashes of chilli sauce, as we found it a little bland.

My son and I have sensitivity to the acidics in tomato sauce.  So i heated up the spaghetti sauce and mixed in 16oz of sour cream.  I also used some Cheddar Mozerlla mix on top.

This was really good!  A family favorite, comfort food and easy to prepare.  The only thing I would say is how about some more sauce?  The pasta soaks up the sauce very quickly and you're left with a meaty, cheesy dish that needs more sauce (in my humble opinion).  So, haven't tried it yet, but wonder if would be good to add more pasta sauce and add a little salt, pepper and some red pepper flakes, so a little less bland.

I made this for my family, but I did make some changes.  I added garlic salt, basil oregano and onions to the meat. I also added some parm cheese to the end product.  All in all, I would say it was good and super easy.  Perfect for a beginner cook!

I made it one evening for a quick dinner, only thing I added was some garlic and some onion, black people and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture. Cover with foil and baked it along with some garlic bread and made a salad. Dinner on the table in no time.

We thought this was pretty good.  I took other's advice and added another jar of sauce.  That turned out to be the best advice. Otherwise, it would be too dry.  I also used the ricotta as was recommended, and that was good too. I think this dish is as good as the tomato sauce you use.  In other words, if you use a bland sauce, the meal will be bland. I took great care to season the beef properly with a little salt and Italian seasoning. I found a jarred sauce that had roasted garlic in it.  My suggestion is to taste your jarred sauce before using it. Make sure it has the taste you like, and add something if you think it needs it. Be aware that this recipe makes ALOT. I did not have a 3qt casserole dish, so I ended up using two, 2 1/2 qt casserole dishes. Both of these dishes were full. We are a family of four, so this will feed us for two nights. Overall a good, fast recipe.

This was the perfect, no fuss, easy to put together meal. Husband loved it and I loved not spending an hour in the kitchen preparing! Didn't have quite enough sauce so added some diced tomatoes and was great. Used tex mex shredded cheese as well cause that was all I had. Still great.

I made this with just a few tweaks.  I used a little seasoning salt and a little Italian salad seasoning and recipe mix.  I followed the cottage cheese suggestion between layers. Served it with a green salad and mozzarella bread sticks.  Boyfriend really liked it.  Would definitely make it again.

I'm giving this a 3 because it's more kid food than anything as the recipe calls for. However I added chopped garlic, onion, green peppers, salt, pepper and it made it a little better. Definitely put foil on top and uncover for the last few minutes.

This was really good and so very easy.  I subbed Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage for the ground beef, and it added such flavor. With only 4 ingredients, its a winner

I replaced the ground beef with Johnsonville ground sausage. I also added about a cup of chopped mushrooms and a chopped yellow onion, which I sautéed with the browning sausage. Because the sausage is seasoned it gave the recipe some much needed spice. I would suggest using only 8 ounces of pasta as the sauce tends to be dry when you use a full pound because it gets absorbed into the pasta as it bakes.

This was pretty good with the addition of extra spices in the meat, as well as more spices and a teaspoon of Splenda in the sauce. My family of four ate the whole thing with garlic bread.

Was very good with noted changes. All 3 sons ate 2 helpings each, and my husband liked it too!  I added  minced garlic, diced onion, and Italian seasoning to the meat while it browned. My jar of pasta sauce was 24 oz., and I only used approx half the 16-oz. box of rotini.  It would have been very dry if I had used the whole box!!  But this is a very good, EASY base recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!

It was good - a little dry for my taste.  I used Boca ground meat substitute and added onion and garlic.  Otherwise I kept the recipe the same.  It was delicious served with fresh bread.  Also, you could use any type of pasta but the rotini really holds the sauce well.

I used a vodka sauce and took the suggestion to add in a layer of cottage cheese. I also threw in some frozen spinach on on top of the cottage cheese. Topped the whole thing with 2 cups of mozzarella. Will make again!

needs more seasonings to be delicious, but good as is. added a can of diced italian tomatoes (mostly drained) because noodle/sauce mixture seemed dry.

Instead of rotini pasta I used lasagna bake noodles. It was great except for the upper layer of noodles.  It was something different and my family liked it.

I wouldn't call this Mozechilli Casserole...a chilli needs to have chilli powder and chilli ingredients, other than the ground beef it does not have either of those. It would have been almost tasteless if we didn't add our own herbs and spices to it. It's pretty much just baked spaghetti with a different kind of pasta.

A good, basic recipe which leaves lots of room for improvisation. I just wanted to make something quick on a brain dead Friday night, using my ground beef up and this fit the bill! Next time I will definitely expand on ingredients, especially after reading others' input. The portion size, however, is outrageous! 1/4 of the recipe is one serving?!? That is a recipe for obesity. I follow Weight Watchers and according to that program, one portion would be worth 27 points, which is basically the total point allotment for one day! I would recommend having a much smaller portion! On the plus side, my 11-year-old son loved it and I will definitely add it to my repertoire, keeping in mind that additional ingredients will definitely improve on this solid basic recipe.

Pretty good.  An excellent dish when in a hurry and little inclination to  fuss;-)  I prepared it exactly as written & agree with others -it needs a little something extra for taste.   One would think that the spaghetti sauce would provide enough flavor but it doesn't.  I'll cook the meat with 1/2 tsp each salt and minced garlic next time.

You pretty much know the taste you are going to come out with just by reading the recipe.  It is a spagetti dinner taste that most Americans enjoy.  It is pretty basic.  So because it is a basic familair taste we all enjoy I rate it about a 3 and for ease and the ability to tweak it to make it your own I give it another star, making it a 4.  I added a pasta /pizza spice that you grind on and a few mini pepperonis to mix  through.  Turn out very enjoyable.  This was a tasty dinner and an even tastier leftover.  Enjoy.

Wow!  Talk about a great way to use leftover spaghetti sauce!  I can't believe how easy this was to make, and my family really enjoyed it.  My homemade sauce already had ground turkey, onions and spices in it (plus some cooked carrots in a tomato base), so I didn't even need to brown any meat.  This is definitely a keeeper!

I thought I made this up, just using stuff I had on hand when I hadn't made it to the grocery in three weeks, but I found this when I searched the ingredients.  We were really surprised at how well this turned out, all things considered, and even the leftovers were eaten (which rarely happens in our house).  This dish definitely goes into the rotation!

Yummy, easy to make and sure to satisfy picky eaters (read 'children'), however a bit too much pasta for the amount of meat. I used less pasta, and it was still too much. With that adjusted, I'll make it again, but add some spices to the meat. I also sprinkled sharp cheddar on top, as I ran out of mozzarella, and it turned out nice.

This was Delicious!  My husband raved about it and told me to make it a regular.  I think I may add a little italian sausage with the ground beef next for more of a kick.  But it was great as is.

The best thing about this recipe is the quick and easy preparation.  Our family liked it, but it wasn't a keeper.
