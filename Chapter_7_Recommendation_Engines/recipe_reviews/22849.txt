i'm not even sure where to start....
if you don't like like hot (spicy) food, then use ingredients which don't have a high heat index, such as chile powder, or cumin, or mild salsa. please don't bastardize mexican cuisine by using ketchup as the base sauce for your taco filling.

ANYTIME you see a taco recipe with ketchup just move on.  Seriously, this is terrible and a travesty.  Yuck.  Stick with cumin, garlic, maybe some paprika and fresh cilantro and you'll be wayyyy better off.

A ketchup like Heinze 57 works excellent because of the spices they use, but don't use so much. Use just enough to cover the meat, when it heats it makes a nice sauce. I've been using this receipe for 30 years now. You'd be surprised how much people love it, especially kids. They will ask you for the receipe and then be surprised that it's only ketchup.

While I have no problem with depatures from regular tacos this is about as far from cooking as you can get.  Its a  lump of ground beef mixed with ketchup and warmed up.  Yikes.  On a whim, my girlfriend and I tried it (exactly as shown in recipe) and it was as bad as we expected.  Don't waste good taco shells by filling them with this mixture!    Ironically, allrecipes.com recommended I pair this with Cuervo Especial tequila.  This suggesstion is an insult to gooed tequila.

Its, easy so ill give it 2 stars, beef and ketchup doesn't equal taco meat, try cumin, chili powder, salt, pepper and some water after you brown the meat. The trick to good mexican on the stovetop is cast iron.

I enjoyed this recipe but I agree to use less ketchup then what it says to use.  The taste of ketchup was a bit much.

If there was half a star available, this is what this recipe deserves. Also if you are not worried about your sodium intake than this is the recipe for you.

If I could give NO star I wouldve. Never ever ever EVER use keychup in a taco or Mexican meal like that. A less spicy seasoning could have been easily accomplished with smoked paprika which has less heat but much flavor,some cumin,and garlic and mild chilis,or even sweet chilis. This is not so much a taco recipe,as it is a bunch of mashed apart meat loaf meat shoved into a tortilla. I have successfully made dozens of mild not spicy mexican dishes in life without ever using ketchup,ketchup should be left for your fries and burgers,It has no place in Mexican food.If youd like a bit of tomato flavor,use actual tomato or s good premade mild salsa,or make some salsa.Even canned tomatoes are better off than ketchup. I am sorry. I rarely leave bad reviews.

Just no...... You don't use ketchup in tacos. Ever!! There are so many spices that you could use instead of this. I'm sorry, but you can't call this Mexican food.

These were just fine. I had a 1/2 small can of chipotle sauce that I used along with the ketchup, I'm not afraid of spicy tacos :) Actually, the ketchup helped sweeten them up which was nice!
