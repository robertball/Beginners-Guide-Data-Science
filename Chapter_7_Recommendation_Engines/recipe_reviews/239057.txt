Lovely bread.   A tad crumbly, but it could've been my wheat flour.  I didn't add in the preservatives--didn't have them, and didn't feel like searching the stores for them.  It still turned out really well.  I mixed the dough in my bread machine for convenience and baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

As another reviewer did, I made this as dough in my bread maker, then transferred it to a pan to bake in the oven (I followed the rising and baking instructions from the recipe after it was in dough form). Didn't have lecithin, but followed everything else. Turned out great! Using it to make ham and cheese sandwiches for my kids after school. Will definitely be using this recipe again. Great bread!

I made my dough in the bread machine and then baked at 350 for 30 minutes. It is a nice tasting loaf, but a little on the heavy side. I left out the lecithin and vitamin C. *Update-I just changed my rating from a 4 to a 5. My family really liked this bread. It lasted for days. My husband liked how dense it is, and it tastes great.
