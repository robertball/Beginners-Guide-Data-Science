This cake was just perfect. I doubled the recipe and bake it in a 9x13 inch baking dish and it was the best dessert at Thanksgiving!

This is a great base recipe to build on. It yields a delicious, moist cake that isnt too pimpkiny or too sweet. Needs more spice to add depth and I think next time I will put wayyyy more bourbon in the caramel glaze and add a little powdered sugar and maple extract to the frosting. Quite tasty as-is but with a little tweaking this could be top shelf delicious!

Doubled the recipe and added a tiny bit of sugar to the whipping cream, along with a bit more bourbon. Delicious! Everyone asked for the recipe.
