This is the ultimate perfect and easy punch..I use it for everything! Rasberry sherbet makes pink, Lime makes a light green. And of course, orange is orange..lol I do not recommend rainbow sherbet, because when mixed together, it turns a brownish color.:( Still tastes great though! I use a potato masher and then a whisk..Very frothy & so yummy! No need for all those other punch ingredients, this one is the BEST!!! :)

The kids...and adults loved it! This punch recipe is a real keeper. Skipped the pumpkin and threw it together in a punch bowl with a frozen lime hand and some gummy worms on the rim.

Terrific easy recipe! I Love the pumpkin idea, only I cleaned mine out and slid my punch bowl inside then decorated the rim of the pumpkin with spiders and worms

This punch looks great and tastes nice. Both sweet and tangy. I also skipped the pumpkin and served it in a bowl.

This was super easy. I didn't use the pumpkin to serve it in though I'm sure it would have been really cute. Everyone loved it, kids and adults .
