I thought it turned out a bit flavorless. The bread baked well, but even with some additions the bread was bland. I plan to make it again because I have another can of pie filling, but with some adjustments.

I made just using what was left from making my pumpkin pies, no sweet potatoes.  I thought it was good.  I just wished you would had included a picture.
