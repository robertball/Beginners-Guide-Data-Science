so excited that i found this recipe! my mother made this for me growing up and i was craving it. it's so simple and healthy. i soaked the mung beans overnight which caused them to retain a lot of water so i only added 4 cups when cooking. i didn't have palm sugar so i just used 1/2 cup of organic cane sugar. i thought it was sweet enough. you can always add more after tasting. thank you for this recipe wiley!

My parents used to make this dish during the summer.
Instead of having the soup hot, it was a perfect dish served cold. I much prefer this to sweet red bean soup.
