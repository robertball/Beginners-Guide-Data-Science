A bit putzy to make, with stuffing pecans in dates, but they taste good! They aren't the prettiest cookies with that date lump in them, but they are really tasty, and my husband liked them. That's what counts most. :-) I had to cook them a little longer than stated; my oven may run a little low. I had more frosting than I needed, even frosting the cookies generously. It will be good on cinnamon rolls another day though.
