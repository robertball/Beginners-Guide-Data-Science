Served this with grilled chicken and all I can say is WOW! Flavors are clean and tropical.  Perfect foil to the chicken.  Highly recommend.

I served this with homemade pita chips and it was huge hit! All of the people that I served it to were impressed by the complexity of the flavor seeing as it was just a simple fruit relish.

I had a taste test with friends with this recipe and three other fruits salsas. This one came in first! I served it with Mahi.  It's a perfect compliment with fish.
