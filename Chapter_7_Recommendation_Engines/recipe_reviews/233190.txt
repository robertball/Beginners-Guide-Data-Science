The first statement I need to make is that I really love the new Herdez Cooking Sauces that are making their way to your grocery stores this week.  If you are a recipe purist who thinks one should follow the recipe exactly, just stop reading now!  I did make a few changes to this recipe.  First of all, I used leftover flour tortillas from my freezer from the Tequila Party I hosted for AR friends in April!  Then I used my leftover Roast Sticky Chicken (still a favorite from this site).  I had some leftover Herdez Tomatillo Verde Cooking Sauce (my very favorite of the four new cooking sauces), so I used that along with a little beef broth (leftovers from my Drowned Beef Sandwich the other night).  The corn I cut from the cob was very sweet, and that was a perfect complement to the spicy sauce.   We loved this dinner.  We didn't eat all that much because it is rich, but we did have a green salad to go along with it.  Delicious!  Totally yummy!

Very good! As you can see, I really like color. In my decorating and in my cooking. Food can be art, and we eat with our eyes. Presentation is everything! I used chopped tomato for a nice contrast with the cilantro and sour cream. Tastes as good as it looks!

I tried this recipe tonight, and I must say that this sauce has an authentic enchilada flavor.  We really enjoyed it.  I know that sour cream and olives would be great, but I served it with a simple fresh tomato salsa.

I made these last night and they were very good. My husband liked them so much he wanted some of the leftovers for breakfast this morning. They were even better the next day. I normally like a bit more sauce but these were very good.

Just got these out of the oven-very, very good.  I loved the idea of putting the cheddar cheese on top to bake on-made it really good.  The cooking sauce was excellent-will make again.

This went over well at our house!  Instead of cubing the chicken, I shredded it to make sure all the flavors mixed into it.  I cut fresh white corn off a cob.  I wrapped the enchiladas in a flour and corn tortilla which tasted fabulous.  I loved the mixture of cream cheese and sauce for the top...that was really great.  In the future, I may mix that in with the chicken and Herdez sauce.  Then, I'll use enchilada sauce under and over the top.  I would've loved more sauce with this, but it was good as it was!

Unfortunately these were not a big hit in my house. They were ok but not out of this world. The filling mix was missing something but my entire family couldn't name what. The corn was a unique addition. After 4 years in El Paso and the southwest I don't think I ever saw corn in an enchilada. The sauce mixture could also stand to be doubled. My entire family agreed it could use more.

Unfortunately, my husband doesn’t like spicy food so I rarely make Mexican food.  This was my first attempt at making enchiladas, and it came out very well if I say so myself.  I reduced the amount of HERDEZ® Roasted Pasilla Chile Mexican Cooking Sauce, but it still came out tasty, so much so, that my husband had seconds.  Who knew?

4.5! My husband says 4, I say 5. I really like these and you had tough competition. Everyone loves my own enchiladas.

I loved the addition of adding corn into the mix. I also made the mistake of using 8oz of cream cheese instead of 4oz. I wasn't upset about it though! 
My husbands complaint was that they were missing something, although he couldn't tell me what. (sorry, not helpful!) 
All and all, these were great. Thanks for a great recipe.

My little dinner party tripled when the rain finally cleared enough to have the fireworks display tonight.  I didn't have enough Pasilla sauce to make enough to feed everyone so I used the Herdez Chipotle sauce to make half of the enchiladas.  I added a bit of chili powder, cumin and garlic powder as I sautéed the chicken.   I served these with Mexican Rice II and guacamole.  As my guests arrived they all commented on how good it smelled and they all agreed the food lived up to the promise of the aroma.  Thank you, arich01, this recipe is a winner!

I liked this although my family didn't seem too crazy about it. I served this with Goya Rice and a side salad. What I really liked about this recipe was using the sauce and cream cheese. Maybe next time I will put some of that mixture inside of the tortilla instead of only the outside.

I halved this recipe for just my husband and I and it made the perfect amount and we even had one left for another meal. I loved the ease of this recipe. I had one very large raw chicken breast I put in a stainless steel sauce pan with a few tablespoons of water and coated it in homemade taco seasoning, covered the pan and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes until it reached 165 degrees (turned out perfectly juicy) before chopping. I then added a little (about 2T) cream cheese to my filling mixture and sprinkled with a little taco seasoning and added some of the shredded cheese because when I tasted it I felt it needed something. When done baking I garnished with thinly chopped lettuce, tomato, black olives and sour cream. These were good but, as another reviewer mentioned, I think it was missing something but couldn't tell what. I think these would also be good with Herdez' Traditional Chipotle instead of the Pasilla. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband is not a huge fan of Mexican cooking, but I am slowly converting him...these were a big hit, served them with Mexican rice!  I also added in a can of refried beans to the chicken mixture!
