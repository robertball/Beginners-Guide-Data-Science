I made quite a few changes, but this was such an awesome beginning recipe that I gave it 5 stars.  Here's what I did: Sauteed the chicken in olive oil with an onion and two crushed up bay leaves.  In another pan, sauteed in olive oil 2 shredded carrots and 4 medium-sized shredded potatoes, plus two stalks of celery.  I added a little rosemary and some dried minced onion while the veggies were cooking.  After both pans were finished cooking, I combined them and added black pepper and 1 cup of chicken broth and two more bay leaves.  A pre-fab pie crust from the refrigerated aisle finished up this easy dish.  One last note: The pie took over an hour to bake fully, but was perfect in the end.  Can't wait to share this one!

My family did not care for this recipe. It was dry and had no gravy in it. It was too bland.

I shredded the vegetables with a food processor, including some onion instead of the onion powder.  I also added about a cup of cheese and additional chicken broth.  Shredding that way is faster than chopping and cooking them is a lot faster too.  In addition my kids found the shredded veggies more palatable.

great place to start!  also, just a note for the folks who keep complaining that it had no gravy or that it's not a good chicken POT pie...well, that's the thing.  it's not a POT PIE.  it's chicken pie.  pot pie has a gravy, chicken pie does not.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and absolutely loved it.  My husband found it a little bit dry, so the next time I made a roux and added that to the mix before baking, and this time we both loved it!  This is a definite keeper!

As written, a four - but as made, a 5-star. My husband made this for me, it was excellent. He used 1 cup of broth, added two stalks sliced celery, only used 3/4 tsp salt, and used fresh onion, not minced. The recipe fails to mention time needed to saute the chicken (or assumes you're using pre-cooked) - he seasoned it with basil. Also, took 35 minutes to bake, not 25.

I used extra broth and real onion and I also added salt and thyme.  Very very good!

worst chicken pot pie I have ever tasted.  I must have done something wrong because it was inedible and we had to go to McDonalds!

I used canned corn instead of carrot, this was fabulous!  My husband and teenage son raved over it!

This was not a success I'm afraid. I usually make sure my chicken recipes have a little more moisture. It's so
