This recipe is great, however I've made a few modifications that have made it even better! 
1. it's not really necessary to use as much bacon as the recipe calls for. If you cut the bacon in half it still tastes the same, and is not quite as bad for you!
2. always drain the bacon grease before adding the onions, and always drain the sauce from the canned beans before adding them, or the recipe comes out too soupy.
3. I think the mustard taste is a little strong, so I cut back on the mustard just a tad.

I've made this recipe several times for about 20 people, and everyone loved it!

I rarely give out 5-star ratings, but this recipe deserves it, I think. Not only was it very tasty, but it's quick and easy to make, too.
This was probably the first time in my life I'd taken canned baked beans (I used Bush's "Original"), which I like by themselves, and fixed them up to make them even better.
I'm not a big fan of mustard, but I had a jar of Hickory Farms Sweet-Hot Mustard which I wanted to use up. It was a 2.25 oz. jar by weight, and it was probably less than 1/4 cup, but more than 1/8, I think. And I couldn't find 15 oz. cans of beans, so I used 2 16 oz. cans.
Therefore I made this with a little more baked beans, and a little less mustard, than the recipe called for.
For the onion, I used a large, sweet Vidalia. After I "finely chopped" it, I thought there might be too much onion in the recipe, but the end result was just right.
I did drain the oil after cooking the bacon and onions, though.
In the end, this was a nice, thick, not too sweet, and only slightly mustardy dish. I loved having lots of bacon and onions in there too. Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved these!  Sweat out the onions in the bacon fat and put everything in the crockpot for the afternoon.  I added about a tablesp. worcheshire and a pinch of crushed red pepper.  Great homebaked taste!

First, let me start by saying I'm not a baked beans fan.  My mother makes them all the time and they are simply not good. I made these beans for Easter and this recipe made me a baked bean lover!  The flavors blend so great together, and I was worried about the ketchup/mustard combo, but it really works.  I made this exactly as the recipe is written and got lots of raves. They taste like you really put a lot of work into them and baked them all day.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I have several baked bean recipes, but this one is definitely the best!  I would recommend NOT using Bush's regular baked beans as they make the disk too soupy.  I made this again with B&M, and it was much better.  This recipe is a must try!

Mmmm, really delicious.  I've never really done anything to baked beans before but this really added to them.  I cooked the bacon and then removed it and poured out the grease.  I then carmelized the onions in the same pan (just a hint of bacon grease in the skillet).  Then I added the bacon, beans, ketchup and mustard.  I know it seems weird to add ketchup and mustard but it tastes great.  I only added about a tablespoon of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.

This is pretty much the recipe I use and that has been a part of my family ever since I can remember. There are some minor changes I make. First, 2 28oz cans of Bush Homestyle beans will make a good amount for a crowd. For my family of 5, just one can will do. I do NOT DRAIN THE CANS!!!!! You will lose flavor! Take out that nasty piece of salt pork or whatever it is. Dump the beans in a crock pot. I don't bother sauteing the onion or cooking the bacon before hand. I just cut up my bacon (1/2 lb for the 2 large cans I mentioned) and onion and put it right in with the beans. I eyeball the ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar, but I know that my ratio is different. If I had to guess, I'd say I probably use about 3/4 cup ketchup for the 2 cans of beans I mentioned earlier, 1 (maybe 2) tablespoons of mustard, and 2 or 3 loose handfuls of brown sugar. Let it cook all day on low. About an hour or so before you want to serve it, give it a taste to see if it needs anything, and if seems soupy, just turn the crock pot up for that last hour. These are the only baked beans I will eat.

Our family loves baked beans in the summer months!  I only used half the bacon specified in the recipe (and it was turkey bacon).  Cut the brown sugar in half and added a small amount of cooked ground sage sausage.  Instead of cooking in the oven, placed in crock pot and cooked on low for 2 hours.  I really like adding leftover hamburgers or meatloaf crumbled up the next day in this.

Good stuff!  I used that orange catsup and the beans looked horrid, but tasted splendid!  Used Bush's Original baked beans and tasted great.  Family liked them, just glad I didn't use that green catsup!

This is amazing - now a must to bring to every picnic.  My friends won't let me come without it.
WORD OF CAUTION - WAY TOO MUCH MUSTARD.
Almost ruined it the first time - had to cut it down to taste.  Once decreased - DELICIOUS!!  Gave it 4 stars only because of the mustard

Made this recipe for a cookout, and received nothing but rave reviews.  I used a bit more onion and bacon, but I also added another can of beans.  I still used 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. mustard and 1/4 c. ketchup.  This one is a keeper!!

I grew up on beans and I love beans. These beans are my favorite. If we have leftovers they are gone the next day. The only thing I changed was the mustard to 1 teaspoon prepared. My kids fuss when they are all gone. Thanks for this recipe.

I agree with halving the bacon.  I used 4 oz. bacon, maple syrup instead of sugar, and, since I'm the only one in my family that likes mustard, reduced the mustard to 1 tsp.  Delicious.

These were quick and easy!  I did make them twice; once as directed and the second time I had to improvise.  The second time around, I was out of onion so I added about 2 tbsps. of dried chopped onion.  I was also out of bacon so I decided to omit it.  I do have to say that it tasted better with the bacon just for that extra crunch, but no one really noticed until I mentioned that I'd left it out.  Definately a keeper!

This is all most like the recipe I use from my Grandmother. The one difference is I use 2 tsp or to taste of dry mustard instead of the yellow mustard. Tastes wonderful!

LOVE IT!!!  I took this to a school function...twice.  Each time; there were no leftovers.  I use busch's baked beans with maple syrup.  The best part you can make this a day ahead and it actually tastes better.  Has time for the flavors to mix together.  Best beans I have ever made.

This was a really good recipe.  Will definitely make again.  Mine turned out a little soupy.  I used Campbell's Pork & Beans.  I used turkey bacon for the bacon and a sweet vidalia onion.  For the mustard, I used Spicy Brown Mustard.  I was surprised it didn't taste mustardy.  It was a really good balance!  I also didn't have regular brown sugar so I used the Splenda brown sugar blend.    The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the fact that is was too soupy for my liking.  I will try with a different brand of beans next time to see if that fixes the problem.

I have probably only had baked beans maybe once in my life but I wanted to make them for my fiance who likes them.  I started out with 2 16oz. cans of vegetarian baked beans (I have a phobia of canned meats so I didn't want pork in them, plus you add bacon).  I browned the bacon in the oven and only used a teaspoon of the grease to saute the onion.  I added both to the beans along with the ketchup and mustard.  Then I tasted them.  They were already pretty sweet and bland so I omitted the brown sugar and added 2T. of worcestershire sauce, 2T. barbeque sauce and 1 tsp. cider vinegar.  My fiance thought they were worthy of 5 stars which he rarely gives.  I thought they were pretty good but I don't really have much to compare them with.  So, in the end after making a completely different recipe we rate these beans 5 stars.

Hey Dooper, these beans are awesome! I needed a quick stove top "baked" bean and these fit the bill. Great flavor, nice smoky taste from the bacon. I'll fix these again when I want a fast stove top bean.

This recipe calls for way too much mustard which gives it a funny taste.  The other ingredients are great so I think if the mustard was cut way down it would be fine.

Very, very good recipe.  I did, however, all just a bit more brown sugar because I prefer my baked beans just a little sweeter.  Overall, excellent results

Taste as good, if not better than what my mom used to make.  Sorry MA!  Anyway, simply the BEST.  I would make again, and again, and again.  Everyone loved it, even people who don't eat beans!  Thank you for this one!

This is a great way to dress-up canned baked beans.  I started them when my husband started heating up the grill and they were ready when the chicken was :)  I'll use this recipe all summer.

These were great-and it was so helpful that they could cook on the stove (and relatively quickly) while the meat was in the oven. I ended up only putting in half of the brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard and we thought it had lots of flavor. Just finishing up the leftovers now!

These beans were very good. I made it with Turkey bacon instead to cut down on the fat.  Next time I would put a little less mustard in.

I used only 5 slices of bacon, cooking 4 in the microwave and only one, chopped up, in a pan with the chopped onion.  I used 2 28-oz. cans of bush's original baked beans. Put in my slow cooker on low for 2 hours. Delicious!

This is now my family's favorite "baked bean" recipe (even though you don't have to bake them).  I love that you don't have to heat the oven up on hot summer days. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the same recipe my husbands grandma made. The only difference I see is she only used 3 strips of bacon and added 1 T vinegar. It has been in his family for years under the name bootlegger beans.

Good recipe.  I made a few changes to make this a little lower in calories.  I put 2 large cans of vegetarian beans in a crockpot on low heat.  I used thin sliced center cut bacon.  I then cook the onions before throwing them in with the beans.  I used one-carb ketchup and Splenda brown sugar.  I used a very little amount of mustard. I added in a pinch of cayenne pepper for a kick.  Cooked in slow cooker for about 4 hours.  Turned out wonderful.  Family didn't know it was low calorie.

This recipe turned out very good, after I drained the excess liquid off the top and cooked for couple of hours.  Without doing these two things I had baked bean soup!  I used store brand beans that may have been a little more liquid than a more well-known brands.  After I had drained (and they had simmered awhile), they were delicious!

These beans have the best flavor. I fixed them for Christmas and they were a hit. I did add bell pepper to the onion and bacon and sauted them together. I only add a tad of mustard and more brown sugar than called for. They were great!

I liked these beans, and they were fairly easy to make, but the family didn't seem to like them too much.  Like some of the other reviews, I think the mustard should probably be cut down a bit.

Great quick recipe. I omitted the brown sugar since canned (Bush's) baked beans are already too sweet for our taste. I also added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce. Awesome. Thanks for this recipe!

Very good and easy recipe.  I didn't have any onion, but it still turned out pretty good.  I still prefer the thickness/stickiness of oven-baked beans, but these are great in a pinch!

These Baked beans are easy easy easy and soooo good.

My 6 year old son LOVES them.  Whenever I am cooking for carry in dinners or to have people over he ALWAYS asks if I will make these.  

I chop the onions up REALLY fine so that the kiddos don't notice them so much but it still infuses the flavor!

Thanks for sharing this recipe

Great recipe.  I loved that you could cook them on the stove instead of the oven.  They still had a great taste and consistency.  I transferred them from the pot to a baking dish and nobody knew how easy this was.  I also loved the brown sugar and bacon, just the right flavors.

Great southern BBQ!  I was used to more traditional brown sugar/syrup recipe, but I am looking forward to making this more often. It was a bit heavy on the mustard for me, but even so I really enjoyed this.  I fed it to my picky BBQ friend, and he LOVED it.

Yum.  I added a couple extra slices of bacon and it was a hit.

These baked beans are excellent! I baked them for my family, and everyone loved it! The bacon really adds a great taste, too!

These beans are delicious and much easier and quicker than the beans my Mom makes. I cook a lot and am always trying new recipes but this recipe remains one of my family's favorite dishes that I make.

Delicious perfect baked beans! I used about a tbs Worcestershire instead of mustard. Baked 350 for an hour. Will make again! Thanks for sharing!

It was really good and easy to make.  I followed the other's advice and cut down on the mustard.  I will make this again.  Everybody raved about the flavor.

This was probably one of the best quick "homemade" baked bean recipe I've had in a while.  Though simple it was delicious!!
