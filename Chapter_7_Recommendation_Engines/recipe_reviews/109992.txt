Definitely a 5 star for flavor but 4 stars for the way the recipe is written! The first step should be to whip the cream. Also, in case people don't know the bowl and beaters should be chilled in fridge for a while. Use a metal bowl..I just put the entire bowl and beater from my Kitchen-Aide mixer into the fridge for 15 minutes. Also, how frothy should the egg yolks be? I made mine frothy but when I stirred in the chocolate I did get some lumps. I kept going with my wire whisk and eventually they evened out. Probably should have used room-temp eggs.  I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate which came out a tiny bit bitter. It was either that or the rum I used instead of the Irish Cream. I'd love to try this recipe with white chocolate or milk chocolate and Frangelico (hazelnut liquer). Finally, make sure you beat your egg whites until stiff and dry, not just stiff. Mine were a little too damp and I ended up with some lumps in the final mousse. It really did taste great with whipped cream and fresh strawberries on top. It was 10 times better the next day! The time in the fridge must have allowed the texture to get fluffy but still thick and creamy. Definitely chill the mousse for a couple hours..that detail was left out. Thanks for sharing a great recipe..overall it was delish!

Wow, wow, wow! :) This is an awesome dessert. I had never made a mousse before but it was really easy and looks super impressive. It was a huge hit with my dinner guests and I will definately make it again. I did use a big extra splash of booze and I garnished the top of the cream with a sliced strawberry. It turned out so beautifully that I can't wait for my next dinner party!

The chocolate mousse was very nice but I would add a extra tablespoon of irish cream.  Also, it is better if you add the whipped cream just before serving so that it does not go hard.

Unbelievably tasty, and not nearly as hard as I thought it would be.  The Bailey's doesn't really come through that strongly, which is a good thing and a bad thing.  If you like it boozy, double or triple the amount in there. Otherwise, it will just be a hint of taste-- which is just lovely, too.  As for the comments about the serving immediately or refrigerating, I refrigerated for a couple of hours and it was firm, but still wonderfully light and fluffy.  I would definitely recommend letting it sit in the fridge to firm up for a bit before serving.  Makes dinner prep easier, too!  :)  Thanks for this recipe!

I added extra Baileys and the flavour was fantastic! Although the texture was a bit strange, you could really feel the whipped egg whites. Probably won't make again as no one really enjoyed the texture.

I really liked this mousse, and i've found that if you place the ready made mousse and whipped cream into your glass, and place it all into the freezer overnight, you'll have a Vary Vary good frozen treat!

5 stars with a few revisions. Whip the cream first adding about 1-2 Tablespoons of sugar to the cream very gradually. I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate chips and melted them in the microwave. I used 1/4 c Irish cream too. If you use a folding utensil the mousse comes out very smooth and creamy. Garnish with fresh mint or a chocolate mint tiny candy for a green color.

I used ghirardhelli double chocolate. This was very good but not much of the irish cream flavor (I used a homemade recipe....Original Irish Cream from this site) came through. I think next time I may drizzle a bit over the set-up mousse before topping w/ whipped cream & chocolate curls. This was a perfect finish to our St Patrick's day dinner...thanks!

Good, but with some tweaking it could be great!  I made it as is, this first time, but next time I will add more sugar to the whipped cream and add more Irish cream (at least 3 tablespoons).  Recommend using a double boiler for the chocolate, and make sure the egg white are beat very stiff and dry.  Nonetheless, it was light and fluffy (perfect after a heavy meal) and will be my go to St. Patrick's day dessert!

Very easy recipe to make. I think I would use milk chocolate next time with cherry or raspberry brandy. I am not a fan of dark chocolate.  But overall good! My teenage son LOVES it, he scraped the bowl!!!

I made this with my class, and at the last minute I had to exchange Irish Cream  with raspberry. They loved it, and even I did--I don't really like chocolate!

This was a little too bitter for me.  The mousse was the right consistency and easy to make but needed lots of whipped cream to add sweetness.

It's good.  Not life altering, but good.  Perhaps I should reveal I'm not a chocoholic.  Maybe that makes a difference....Textures was pleasing, and I would make again for a company's coming buffet situation.

My first attempt failed because I let the chocolate get too cool after melting.  The second time I made sure to get the yolks at room temperature and the chocolate was still a little bit warm.  Neither the whipped cream nor the egg whites folded smoothly and I ended up using the mixer.  In spite of all that, the texture and taste was very good.  I think the recipe was just a bit advanced for my skills.

This was a great recipe, creamy and smooth. I did add extra irish cream and I think I will use a milk chocolate next time. Not to much of a dark chocolate fan but everyone else really enjoyed it. ;o)

5 with changes. I gave it a 4 because the changes were noticeable. Increased Irish cream from 1tb to 4. Added 2 Tb of sugar to the whipped cream. Without changes is a bit to bitter and cant taste the Irish cream much. I incorporated all the whipped cream into the mouses instead of half of it. I incorporated it all with a whisk beater on my kitchenaid mixer...had no problem with incorporating the eggs etc and it did not come out eggy. I am not sure if I will makeit again though just due to the salmonella risk using uncooked eggs. OTOH  the family loooved it....I served it topped with fresh strawberries. This says it makes 4 servings. It is so rich though that I really got 8 out of it. 4 is a large serving.

Texture is light and fluffy, and the taste is good.  I couldn't get the beaten egg whites incorporated very well (at least to my satisfaction) into the chocolate mixture.  Tthe egg white texture dominated which shouldn't be the case in a well-made mousse.  And it did end up a bit lumpy.  Overall, it was a nice dessert, but it didn't WOW any of us as I hoped it would.

I would recommend this recipe for dessert when entertaining. It's so easy to serve straight from the refrigerator to the table.  

The only change I made to this recipe was to the remainder of whipped cream (the part you dollop on top of the dessert after folding in the half cup into the mixture). I added 1/4th to 1/2 of a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of finely granulated sugar and whipped it again until dissolved. 

The mousse itself was a little stiff, but I do keep my refrigerator pretty cold (37-degrees F). Easily solved: Set on counter about 10 minutes before serving.

I was a little worried initially while I was making this recipe that the serving size was going to end up being TEENSY...but by the time I folded in the egg whites I realized that it made a perfect serving size - not too large; not too small.  

Tip: We don't normally indulge in Irish Cream liqueur, so it was kind of hard to swallow spending $30 for a bottle from which you only need a tablespoon of liqueur for taste.  So call up a neighbor and see if you can split a bottle! Otherwise you'll have that full bottle of liqueur until doomsday!

This was a hit.  I doubled the amount of Irish crème because I love the flavor.  It's perfect in serving cups or choux pastry.

this is a WONDERFUL recipe!  I read through all the reviews for recomendations and did change it up a bit ... I used ghiradehlli semi-sweet chocolate chips 'cause that is what I had in the house an increased the Baileys to 1/8 cup... I doubled the recipe and was the hit of the St. Patrick's Day party that I brought it to.  My husband doesn't like sweet desserts and he LOVED this - beautiful texture and flavor ... I highly recomend this

super easy ( remember to let your eggs sit on counter for about 30 to get to room temp before using ).  I used amaretto instead of Irish cream.  Family loved it!

i did only half of the Bailey's and added Kuala for the other half to make Mudslide parfaits.  Everyone at my work loved them and they were the first flavor to disappear.

I completely screw up this recipe!! But what ever I did make was delicious!! So go give it a try! You can't ever go wrong with chocolate and booze!! I also served mine in cut icecream cones, like little shot glasses! excellent!!
