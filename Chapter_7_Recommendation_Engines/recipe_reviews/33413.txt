The sandwich was excellent but I am surprised that no one mentioned that you cannot use parchment in the broiler. I found out the hard way. Next time I will use foil.

I mixed the italian seasoning and a little garlic powder into the ricotta and then spread it on the tomato.  Sprinkled with sea salt when I put the sandwich together.  It was really good and is something we will be making often.

Just a note about the parchment paper: It is MEANT to be used in the oven. If you are having issues with it smoking/melting, you're probably using WAX paper. :) Recipe is fine as written.

This is my first review and I have used this site for at least four years. I usually make the recipes on here as directed or used other reviews to help me tweak it. I was a bit adventurous this time and instead of using more cheese (provolone) on top of the ricotta I used some balsamic vinegar. On my first sandwich I just drizzled some on the tomatoes before putting them in the broiler but it wasn't enough. So on my next sandwich (yes, I ate two : )  I poured a SMALL puddle into a shallow plate and put a slice of mulit-grain bread face down.  Did the same with the next slice and then proceeded with the recipe.* *If you are concerned with the bread being soggy, put in the broiler on it's own before putting mayo and ricotta on it.  I like this recipe as is, but with the Balsamic - YUM!

I just made this as a late night snack.  It was very tasty and very simple.  Instead of provolone, I used cheddar since that was all I had.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to sneak in some fresh basil between the tomato and ricotta.  Can't wait to try again.

This is good with "Trim" cottage cheese, too. I skip the mayonnaise only because the cottage cheese is enough for me.

This was very nice for a quick, light lunch. I switched a few minor things up, by using fresh thyme and basil rather than the Italian seasoning, and simplified things by just putting the sandwich all together and broiling the whole thing. I left it open face and substituted fresh parmesan for the provolone I didn't have. Great sandwich.

Pretty good. Added the italian seasonings and garlic powder, as well as pepper to the ricotta before putting on the tomatoes. Very light and yummy.

I made this with low fat cheeses, lite mayo (and used a bit less of it) and a whole grain English Muffin instead of bread slices.  It turned out great and I liked it a lot.  The only problem is that it is a very messy sandwich - the moment I bit into it, little bits of tomato and ricotta started falling out!  I think next time I will reduce the amount of filling I used to help prevent this problem.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I think it would be better in the summer when the tomatoes are really good. In N.J. in mid Feb. with mediocre greenhouse tomatoes as the only option, it was OK, not great. I was looking for ideas for using up the leftover ricotta from a lasagna I made recently.

Amazing! Easy and delicious. I grilled my bread instead of toasting it, and it think it was a good decision. I used potato bread because it was what I had but I think the original wheat bread would have been better. Definitely will make this again!

This was a tasty sandwhich!  I did add a little bacon just to give it a little meat, and I only had swiss cheese.  I'll make this again sometime when I have some left over ricoatta cheese that I need to do something with.

Found this recipe on a search for "ricotta" that I had left over from making lasagna.  I'm not that familiar with the various uses of ricotta, so needed a little inspiration.  Anyway, this was so basic of a recipe that it showed me that you can pretty much do whatever you want with it.  I used olive bread which added another layer of flavor and kept it open faced since I don't usually use two pieces of bread for a sandwich.  This also eliminated the need for mayonnaise.  It was a quick, tasty meal.

if ppl r smart, they wont use THAT much ricotta. i love the stuff, but if every sandwich had as much as on the picture, that'd be such a waste. it seems better as a spread than the entire content.

I always say the messier the sandwich - the better!  These were pretty good and I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I think I will cut down on the ricotta and use some garlic powder, salt and pepper!

Somewhat messy. Next time I would salt and pepper the tomato first and peel it.
