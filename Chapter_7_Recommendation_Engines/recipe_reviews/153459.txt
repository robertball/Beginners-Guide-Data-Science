Volunteered to make Hot cross buns for Easter breakfast at church, so I picked this recipe to try since this was a first for me - made them small so there would be more and they were a hit - very light in texture with a hint of sweetness.  I don't have anything to compare them to, but they're definitely a keeper for my recipe box.

Every year on Good Friday we make hot cross buns. I had some buttermilk on hand, so I thought I would give this recipe a whirl. So glad I did! We will absolutely be using this next year. I made some slight alterations. For the flour, I used a 50/50 combination of whole wheat flour and bread flour. I mixed the wet and dry ingredients separately (after proofing the yeast and this made a very easy, workable dough! Also made small slits on the top before baking, so they had lovely cross ridges in the top. I topped them with royal icing, so the crosses were predominant.

These were good but they tasted more like dinner rolls than hot cross buns.  I probably won't make them again.

Excellent results just as written, although I used currants instead of raisins. This was a boost to my yeast-bread baking confidence! I did make my own frosting with powedered sugar, milk and few drops of almond extract.  Always a sentimental favorite at Easter.

This was my first time making hot cross buns, or any yeast dough.  They came out great!  Soft and moist, and the icing added just the right amount of sweetness.  I left the raisins out because my family doesn't care for them.  I also made the recipe the night before, and let it rest in the refrigerator after letting it rise both times.  Came out perfect!

Our family has an egg allergy so this is a great alternative to the traditional recipe since it does not require any eggs.

One of the reviews stated the buns were more like a bread mixture, and I would have to agree with them. They rose beautifully, but after baking them, they were not high at all.  I probably needed to make the temperature higher and not as stated in the recipe.

these were excellent! didnt have buttermilk so added 1tblspn cider vinegar to sweet milk instead, and i sprinkled the sugar with the yeast, allowing it to proof for 10minutes till creamy looking. made a sweet dough  for the crosses after they were baked. for those like me who have egg allergies, this is the recipe for you! they rose beautifully and were light and delicious!

These were yummy! I made a gluten free version with cranberries and cherries instead of raisins, and made my own icing. Will definitely save this recipe to make again.

pretty good. made these in the bread machine, but basically followed the recipe. used butter instead of margerine; tried to chop raisins in 1/4 c. flour, but they stubbornly refused to be ground up. baked them in 2 9-inch sq. pans, 9 to a pan, brushed with egg wash for shine. they were almost too light and airy - i think i would have preferred a somewhat more dense and chewy texture.

Made this in practice for next Easter Sunday.  Everything is better with buttermilk.  Easy recipe, and they came out soft, fluffy and tastey.  I don't know what they are tradionally supposed to taste like, so I doubled the sugar based on other comments.  Still baked in 9x13 pan, but they separated easily.

This recipe is simple but takes a while to prepare as the dough has to rise. I used the 9x13 pan as indicated but found the 18 portions ended up smaller than I expected as there wasn't that much room to expand. I also used raisins and dried cranberries for mole flavor. Would definitely make it again.

This was a wonderful recipe. I followed the ingredients and method almost exactly. I didn't let it rise as long as suggested. I let it rise 30 minutes to start and then about 15 minutes the second time. The buns were light but just enough body for me to really enjoy. I made me own frosting with icing sugar, vanilla and milk. Really good.

I used currants instead of raisins and made my own icing with powdered sugar, but those were the only changes I made. The buns turned out great but not as rich as I expected, probably because of the lack of eggs. I like lightly sweet much better than overly sweet but the currants were not enough to make me feel I was eating a sweet pastry instead of savory. I may up the sugar just a bit next time. I will probably also bake them on a baking sheet instead of a 9x13 pan since they smashed together as they baked and look like pull-apart rolls instead of the round hot-cross buns I remember from when I was a kid. Still, this is a good basic recipe and great for when I need to bake for a family member with an egg allergy.

Nice, moist buns. I doubled the sugar and used 1 cup wheat flour. They rose really well. ... I didn’t want to use the icing cross so I made a mix of 1/4 c flour and 3 Tbs water. It put that in a zip lock and cut the tip, then piped on the cross.

Always stayed away from using yeast.   So this was my first time using.   I was expecting the more cakey type of bun, but this one was smooth.   I used over the counter frosting for the cross.  Work well.  Proud of myself that I might try yeasting again!

These are not traditional hot cross buns, which have an egg and a little more texture. These also lack the dough baked-on cross, currants, and cardamom which, to me, are necessary ingredients that distinguish a true hot cross bun from all others. Some also contain a small amount of candied fruit. The only reason I am giving three stars is because it is fine as a plain every day dinner roll. Chef John has posted a nice recipe on this site if you are interested in experiencing an old country tradition.

These were really, really good. I didn't have buttermilk, so I subbed 3/4 cup plain fat-free Greek yogurt mixed well with 1/4 cup water. And dried cranberries because raisins are the worst things ever.

This is my new go-to recipe! I tried it exactly as written and it came out perfect! The rolls tasted good and were soft and slightly chewy. I made my own icing because I didn't want an open can of frosting sitting around: stir together 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1/2 Tbsp milk and 1/2 Tbsp melted butter. This makes just enough to make crosses on all 18 buns.

This is a fabulous recipe. . . . It is relatively simple and very delicious.  I have never made hot crossed buns before but volunteered to make some for our church, this year.   This recipe has truly 'saved the day' !
