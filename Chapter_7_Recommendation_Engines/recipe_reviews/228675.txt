This cake is a great use of zucchini from your garden.  I made half the recipe using an 8x8 pan.  I didn’t realize the applesauce I had was super chunky until I added it to the cream cheese mixture¸ a pleasant mistake because despite beating it very well, it remained slightly chunky and looked very appealing spread on the cake.  The flavor of the applesauce in the frosting was wonderful, the perfect compliment to the cake.

This was a great recipe to start with but we made a few changes. I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup melted butter for the vegetable oil, used 1 cup sugar instead of 2 cups (applesauce adds sweetness), 2 cups whole wheat flour for 2 1/3 cups white flour, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp, only used 1 1/2 cups zucchini, and added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinnamon. The cake is sweet enough without adding any frosting. The kids I baked this with are 2 and 4 and they love it.

Delicious! The cake was moist and flavorful. I added in about 6oz of walnuts, which really kicked it up a notch. I also tossed in a couple shakes of nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter. The icing was sooo tasty, but it is more like a drizzle than an "icing" because it didn't harden much once refrigerated. I recommend making this for any occasion!

I and my cousin both made this cake, which was excellent.  Moist and flavorful.  However, the icing is more like a cream soup. the only way to make it stay on the cake is to keep it in the fridge before and after it is frosted.  Could it be something is missing from the recipe?

Frosting wasn’t bad flavor, but was like icing even after using only 1/4 cup. We did not care for the cake at all. I wanted to like it but it had a jelly like layer on the bottom I think from to much oil 1 cup seems like a lot. I may make again with a few adjustments.

I just made this.  The cake turned out moist and delicious! The frosting turned out a little runny even though I cut back to a quarter cup of apple sauce, based upon other reviews. I plan to keep the frosting in a separate container and "frost as I go".     I'm not sure if wringing out the zucchini is necessary.  I was not very exuberant with this step and I never do it with zucchini bread when I make it.

I've never made anything with Zucchini before but this was the perfect first recipe to try!  I was surprised to see it made an entire 9X13 cake. It was still classically moist like zucchini bread but lighter and fluffier.  I tried it first without the icing and I'm glad I did; it was sweet enough on it's own, I think the icing would have taken away from that.

Yes, it's late winter but the grocery store has plenty of fresh "zukes". This turned out so good !  I did sub 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, used coconut oil for 1/2 of the oil. Afraid I was not able to squeeze out enough of the zuke juice so I added another 1/2 cup flour.  I like to sub spiced rum in place of vanilla (in all my cakes) and did so in this recipe. The cake turned out so good, didn't even need frosting.

I was looking for a recipe that was kind of like my grandmothers zucchini cake that she use to bring over, I missed it so much, this came pretty close I think I may have possibly over beat the frosting because it was a little bit loose but other than that fantastic.

The cake is great. I have made it twicw. As a round layer cake and a 9x13. This time I did the 9x13 pan. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup lt brown sugar. (I ran out of white) Anyways, it was really good. 
This time I tried the frosting. Don't do it!! The apple sauce makes it like soup!

This was a great recipe. Though it took me a while to get the consistency of the icing correct, it was truly divine. It also tastes very cook with a cup of chopped walnuts. I will definitely be making this cake again!

Wonderful cake!  Grated the zuke with a fine setting-didn't squeeze it dry just poured a little of the extra lid off.  I used 1 3/4 cups of brown sugar instead of white sugar and 2/3 cup of oil with 1 snack size cup of applesauce.  Added 1 cup of crushed walnuts, cinnamon, nutmeg & extra cinnamon to batter.  I also cut back on the amount of applesauce in the icing so it wasn't runny and added extra nutmeg/cinnamon to that as well.  This was a WONDERFUL cake so very very moist and not too sweet.  You may want to go with 1 2/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar if you have a sweet tooth!  Thank you for the fantastic cake recipe!

This is a good cake but the frosting isn't to my liking.  It was soupy and overly sweet.  Everyone else in the house loved it.
