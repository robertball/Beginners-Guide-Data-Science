After trying these bars many different ways, this is the modified version we liked best: Combine all dry ingredients first, then cut in butter with 2 knives as for pie dough. Press with fingers to form a solid mass. Use seedless fruit only preserves for filling. Bake in an 8X8-inch pan lined with buttered foil. Increase baking time by 5 minutes. Serve with vanilla ice cream. This is our personal favorite, but any way you make them, they're great!

This is our favorite bar cookie.  We've tried many types of fruit, and apricot is our favorite.  To make a breakfast oatmeal bar, I double everything except the sugar and jam, which makes a bar that is less sweet.

This is the 2nd time I've tried this recipe. The first time, they turned out flat,crumbly and the fruit was rubbery.
The next time, I doulbed the recipe, used seedless jam, and put about 1-2 tsp of evaporated milk into the oat mixture. It was much easier to press into pan, yet still able to crumble on the top. Much more flavorful. So simple and quick to make I have to keep the recipe!!  Thanks!

I really think this recipe works better if you make it in an 8 or 9 inch square pan. If you want to use a 9x13 pan you really need to double the recipe. I doubled it and added 2T. milk and 2t. vanilla as suggested by another reviewer. I cooked 1C. dates, chopped, in 2C. water until thickened and used this as the fruit topping. Sprinkled cinnamon and ground cloves over it and baked as directed. Really great tasting, healthy snack for my family... not too much refined sugar and lots of fiber. Thanks for a keeper recipe :)

Excellent and easy recipe.  Instead 
of using jam, you could substitute one 
cup water and 1/2 cup dates boiled until 
you get a thick jam like consistancy.  
That way you don't end up with too much 
added sugar in the recipe.  Also I added
a little vanilla and it was great.    
Thanks for sharing this recipe.  :o)

I found these okay but a little dry.  I doubled the butter, melted completely.  My favorite filling is an apple butter/applesauce mix with pumpkin spice added (however much you like).  I also add about a fourth cup dry oats to the top layer mix and make sort of crumbly.

Very Good! I put the whole recipeon the bottom of the pan them covered in jam. I made a streusel topping or cinnamon, flour, brown sugar and oats and sprinkled on top.

I made this a year ago, trying to "copy", or should I say, figure out how to make grape bars.  I live in the Finger Lakes and also work in vineyards.  Anyways, one of my bosses got me hooked on these grape bars, made with concord grapes, a lady in Naples NY makes them and sells them, but I still can't find a recipe for them (I'm sure it's secret) LOL But......I came pretty close when I made grape pie filling on top of stove, then poured on top instead of jam.  It was close, but I just read a review (which I'm going to try), that said double the oatmeal recipe and increase time, I think it will work.  All and all, though, the base tastes like what I was looking for, ty

Make sure you use high-quality jam at room temperature, or spreading it will be difficult.

This is a great tasting and easy recipe, I just combined all the dry ingredients in my food processor.  I doubled the recipe and substituted sucanat for the brown sugar and it was wonderful, I made it at the health food store that I work at and it was a BIG BIG hit.

Served these bars alongside cupcakes from the local cupcake shop...amazingly, the bars disappeared first. For best results, follow the recipe for the "dough" part (feel free to experiment with fillings). I tried to do a "healthier" version with applesauce and whole wheat flour - they were not nearly as good.

Made these a while ago, apparently my review didn't save?? I'd suggest you double the topping, or halve the jam. We halved the jam...because we ran out of jam lol...but it was just right, a full-sweet (store-bought) jam would be OVERWHELMINGLY sweet if you used 1.5 cups. So use home preserves or use less than called for in the jam department. But the crust is delish and everyone enjoyed these. Warming.

This recipe was good in regards to general quality and texture. (I doubled it for a 9 x 11 pan.) However, it needed a touch more flavor more than the strawberry preserves that I used.  I suppose this would depend upon the specific preserves... Next time I'll add some cinnamon to the recipe and maybe even more brown sugar to the top crunch layer.

We loved these!  They were super fast to make.  We followed the review about using the apricot preserves and they were super-yummy.  We also doubled the recipe and used the 9x13 pan.  Next time we will try the bit more healthy approach and use Smuckers Simply Fruit apricot preserves.  I will say that they are messy to make.  Even after cooling for an hour, if I tried to cut them, they would fall apart, so finally I put them outside on the porch (in the dead of winter) and the next morning I was able to cut them apart without them falling apart.  We also followed the part about buttering the foil, but this didn't work.  The foil ended up sticking to the bars in the corners and I was peeling it off it little bitty pieces.  Total pain.  Next time I might try baking on parchment?

This is a bit dry and definitely needs a 9x9 pan instead of a 9x13. Very easy though. Would make again in a crunch.

Perfect 'as is,' no changes to the ingredients. My only suggestion is for prep, namely that the dry ingredients be combined first, then cut into cold butter as 'trufflebun' suggested. People can skirt the "thin layer" without doubling anything by using an 8 x 8 pan. Never had rubbery issues using preserves or jam, seedless or not. Really simple, fast and easy to make. This is the recipe I use all the time.

Delicious!!!  The buttery crust was perfect with the tangy apricot/pineapple jam that I used.  This was very popular in our house and barely lasted more than one day.  Will make again with other flavors of jam - raspberry and blackberry would go very well in this recipe.

I cut these into little squares and freeze them in sandwich bags, 4 to a bag.  I pop them into my daughters lunch bag in the morning straight from the freezer and they make a perfect morning snack!

I love these! It's all I can do not to eat half tyhe pan as soon as they come out. I amended the recipe to add about 1 tbsp of ground cinnamon, and it gives it a more rich flavor, but otherwise, I think this recipe is one of my new favs. My husband constatly asks me to make some more.

I was looking for a shortbread-based bar cookie recipe & found this. Trufflebun's advice to "combine all dry ingredients first, then cut in butter with 2 knives as for pie dough" works well. I used an 8 x 8 glass pan lined with buttered foil. For the filling, used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce that had been kicking around the pantry since last Thanksgiving. Added some toasted chopped almonds to the top layer of crust. It came out of the oven quite moist, and I would have eated it in a bowl with ice cream if I had any. Next time I'll try jam for the filling. Still looking for a shortbread-based bar cookie recipe.

This was pretty good. Don't expect them to be like convenient, store bought bars. You have to cut them out of the dish like pie and they will be sticky. But they are tasty!

This recipe is fantastic!  Followed to near exactness. I just substituted 1/2 cup 100% wheat flour for white to add a little more nutritional value. We used homemade peach jam I canned this summer. Not too dense and I love how well the salt off sets the sweetness. The kids and I, and more importantly, the hubby, are fans!

These tasted pretty good, not too sweet, which I really liked.  Extra points for being SUPER easy and using items I keep on hand.  Try throwing a little cinnamon in the oat mixture and using Apple Butter instead of jam, was very good this way!

I thought these were very good.  After reading other reviews I made them in a 9 x 9 pan, and added a little extra butter.  They are very sweet, and when I make them again I will use all fruit jam with no added sugar.  They were a hit at my office, however!

Made this at daycare with the kids and they loved it! I did 1 and a half sticks of butter, because mixture seemed dry, and made with strawberry jam. It was a huge hit!

These are very tasty. I replaced the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour and used Polmars all fruit seedless blackberry preserves. I will make these again!

My jam was hard to spread but that was just the type I had, so it didn't get even.  I used an 11x7 pan based on reviews that it was too thin in a 9x13, but they were kinda thick, I think the 9x13 would have been fine.  35 minutes was too long, I should have checked sooner and the oatmeal was browned too much.

I'd been wanting to make these and was happy to find the recipe and suggestions. I doubled the top & bottom ingredients for a 9"x13" pan and it turned out well. My tip is to give the oats a quick spin in a blender or food processor. You get all the benefits of oatmeal, but it's less chunky for family members who may not love oatmeal's texture so much.

Good, tasty, versatile recipe.  However, it does make a very thin layer.  I would make extra for the crust next time.  It held together very well, though, for how thin it was! (Not too crumbly like many are.)

I added about half a cup of peanut butter (I used all natural) and decreased the butter to about 1/4 cup, and that worked out great.  I do agree with others, though, that the 9x13 pan makes the bars rather thin.

These were so simple to make, required no eggs, and used up some jam that wasn't getting used otherwise. Nice flavor, sweet, and made a lot of bars.   They were a bit on the dry side though.

Very good, but too dry so I shall add a little honey and/or some fruit juice to the mix next time. tasted just like a granola bar though which is what I wanted. Was so dry though it was impossible to cut into actual squares as it just broke apart randomly. I never ever use salt in any baked good as I have found over the years doing is useless as it adds absolutely zilch to any baked good. I added cinnamon and mixed dried berries as well as vanilla paste and slivered almonds to the batter.

These are tasty, but don't expect them to transport well out of the pan. Based on previous reviews, I added 1 tablespoon of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the crust and made them in a 9x9 pan. I also cut the dry ingredients together with the butter (based on trufflebun's review) before adding those additions, which worked quite well for the crust. They came out pretty well that way, but they must be incredibly thin in the original 9x13 pan called for, given that I wouldn't call them desperately thick in a 9x9 pan. You ultimately end up with a tasty soft and gooey (from the jam) bar that would be best served warmed up with ice cream, in my opinion. More like some cobblers I've made as opposed to bars, given that we couldn't easily pick them up and eat them with our hands. (However, still more bar-like than an actual cobbler.) So while these are definitely tasty and were enjoyed by my kids, they don't work well as a snack to take places as I was hoping. I'll be trying other recipes for something along those lines.

What a quick and tasty recipe! I made a homemade peach apricot preserve instead of using store bought jam. In a sause pan, I combined 1/2 a cup of water, and added 1 1/2 cups of  fresh peaches and dried apricots. Brought it to a boil and let it sit to cool and thicken up. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and maple syrup. Thanks for the recipe!

If you follow this recipe and use a 9x13 pan, the bars come out REALLY thin.  I used all of the mixture on the bottom of the pan, otherwise there wouldn't be enough to fill the bottom of the pan.  Next time I will double the recipe to use a 9x13 pan.  Good bars, tho.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these, and because I am VERY critical of my own cooking, they didn't turn out right. I think the butter needs to be melted, not softened. I followed the recipe, and my 'dry mixture' was clumpy. My daughter said it was good, but she's 14, she thinks everything is good. Melting the butter, as u would with a cheesecake crust, will make it 'press better'. Was tatsy though.

The proportions of this recipe are off.  When used in a 9x13 pan the bottom crust is too thin and it is difficult to cut into bars that remain in bar form.  Doubling the crust to filling ratio should correct the problem.

Yeah..I did several changes for this recipe. Such as, reduce the sugar (i use only brown sugar), I use 85:15 ratio for Applesauce : Butter than using the full butter recipe. Also multiply the recipe 1,5 times since the crumble dough of the original recipe only enough for the base. So, i made half recipe more for the top crumble. Additional cinnamon powder also added here to enrich the spice of the this chewy non gooey cookie bars. I suggest this marvelously fruit bar eaten cold rather than warm with companion of cinnamon ice cream...Heeemmmm, FANTASTIC!!

I had and lost a different recipe for oatmeal fruit bars, but this one seems a pretty close match.  My old recipe said to press the crumb mixture into the pan and bake for about 10 minutes until golden brown, prior to adding the preserves.

A great recipe -- I love to take these cookies as snacks for hiking.

This is super easy and my kids love it!  Instead of spreading the jam on I stirred the jam up a good bit before then kinda drizzled over the bottom layer.  After I put the top layer on I gently pushed the jam around a little more and it was Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit with a few mods. Like others I found the batter too dry to work with, so I added applesause to the mixer. This made it too moist to 'sprinkle' on top. So I used the batter for the bottom only. This made a nice fit or the 9x13 pan. I chose Mrionberry jam for the fruit layer. Then I made a basic crumb topping for the top layer. 
The whole pan was gone by the next day!

Oh, these were JUST what I was looking for!!  And YUM!!!  I did as suggested and combined two types of jam (two different home-canned ones that the kids wouldn't touch!!), and substituted whole wheat flour for the white.  Six kids later, and now I have to make MORE!  THANKS SO MUCH!

Excellent.  I used low sugar jam in 2 different flavors and it was great.  I also added some chopped pecans to the mix and it gave it kicked it up a notch.  I've made them several times in the past 2 weeks because they keep disappearing.

I followed the recipe but put in a 9”x9” pan to get thicker bars.  I used raspberry jam and sprinkled semisweet chocolate chips over the jam and then topped with remaining crumbs. Easy and delicious!

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for to use some of our fresh fruit. I made a double batch and used freshly made, slightly tart yellow plum jam as the filling. I will put some in the freezer so we do not over-indulge. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. Did it in a 9x9 tray as suggested by many commentators and decreased the amount of jam

I made this as written.  It tasted good but the oatmeal bottom was dry and the top fell off every bar.

Absolutely a treasure!  An old-fashioned, deeply satisfying, wholesome recipe.  I did use 3/4 stone ground whole wheat flour to 1/4 white all purpose flour.  I pressing two cups of the batter into the bottom of my stoneware, I added 1 cup of sliced almonds and 3/4 cups of whit choc chips to the topping before sprinkling it over the fruit filling.  For the fruit filling, I only had blackberry preserves, so I spread those over 1/2 of the pressed down layer, and then spread apple butter over the other 1/2 , before sprinkling the topping on.  After it cooked, and cooled for 30 minutes, I swirled white almond frosting over the top for decoration.
Excellent!

So good!  I used half pureed fresh strawberries and plums mixed with half apricot jam and it was wonderful.  I like extra cookie batter on the bottom, so mixed up an extra half batch to sprinkle on the top, too.

I really liked the oatmeal crust part though wasn't all that impressed with the recipe itself.  It was too sweet for me.  I used an 8 X 8 pan and did part strawberry jelly and part apricot jelly.  I think you'd definitely have to double it to make enough for a 13 X 9 inch pan.

This is really simple and quick. I added milk like some suggestions said. i also added a 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour to replace some white flour. i used fig preserves and a little honey, vanilla and nutmeg. yum. they were still a little crumbly, so i'm wondering about adding an egg.

I tried this recipe and it did not turn out well. The bars were flat and when they were perfectly browned on top the center was gooey.  When the center was done the edges were burned.  Overall I think I will try a different recipe next time.

Had a hard time spreading out the jam.  I used seedless, all-natural preserves at room temp. as was suggested on another review.  Otherwise, delish!  Could probably use less sugar, though.

These taste nice, but look rather flat and dull. I followed the recipe and used raspberry jam, but these are average. Not sure I'd make these again, although perhaps following some of the other reviewers' suggestions may help.

My family loved these.  I used date filling.  I modified this recipe to make a little healthier and used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 cup homemade apple butter(you can use applesauce as well) and only 1/4 cup butter.  They turned out chewy and great flavor.  I agree with previous reviewer, the mix was not enough for a 9x13 pan but was just right for a square pan.  I'm still giving 5 stars because the recipe itself was perfect.

These tasted pretty good, but were much flatter than I would have liked. My husband wasn't crazy about them.

Soooo easy the kids even helped. Boy did they gobble these up. The sounds of mmmmm went on for several minutes. This is a keeper, easy and yummy; you can't go wrong! Bye the way, be sure to let them cool all the way before you cut them.

I had raspberry, strawberry and apricot jams that needed to be finished off, so I tried this recipe. It came out a little crumbly, so I decided to cut them in squares and wrapped them in plastic wrap and put them in the freezer. They taste great out of the freezer, the jam is chewy. I also added walnuts to the oat mixture which is really good too. Good recipe if you need to use up extra jam!

This is a GREAT recipe, and about as easy and foolproof as it gets. I made them for a pot-luck and they were delicious, and I would most definitely suggest using raspberry jam.

These did not turn out for me.  The mixture is very dry which makes it difficult to spread the jam, so my end result was dry.  May try again.
