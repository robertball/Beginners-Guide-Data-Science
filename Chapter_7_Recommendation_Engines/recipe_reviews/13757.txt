Easy, but VERY sweet.  I would cut the sugar by 1/2 at least.  I was more like dessert.

I have made this for years to go along with a Sunday barbque. I never have any left for lunch
on Mondays. My only problem is this is mothers secret recipe (or so I was told). She has prepared
this for years for family gatherings. **Tip*** prepare early in the morning and place covered in fridge then bake for extra 10-15 min ( do not increase cooking tempature )

Yummy!  Everyone loved it!  I accidentally picked up crushed pineapple instead of chunks.  It was still great!

Fell in love with this delicious dish several years ago at a large potluck dinner but did not get the recipe.  I was thrilled to find it in Allrecipes.  I made a double batch for our church Christmas Dinner the other night and 8 people asked for the recipe.  What everyone says is true; goes great with ham, taste like a dessert and is easy to make.  I cut the sugar in half as several other reviewers suggested and it was still sweet.  I might try making it with Splenda to cut the calories.

This is one of my favorite recipes!  It goes great with Ham, Chicken and BBQ.  I fixed this for a Women's meeting and everyone loved it.  I make my cracker topping a bit different by adding melted butter to the crumbs.

This is a family favorite that pairs especially well with ham. The recipe I have from my mom differs just slight--I use pineapple tidbits instead of chunks, 5 tbsp flour, 1.5 cups cheese, and just 1 stick of butter.  These instructions also don't specify what the butter is used for--I pour it over the Ritz crackers.  My mom mixes the crackers with the butter and then spreads that over the top.  Either way works, but I find it difficult to spread the butter-cracker mixture as it's kind of clumpy.  I also don't divide the cooking time--it all gets put together and cooked at the same time, included the cracker topping.

I've made this several times for company and family - and enjoy it every time. We especially like it using crushed pineapple versus pineapple chunks... The combination of pinapple and cheddar cheese is a surprising taste match. I've served it with Ham or pork chops. With the summer heat - I've even baked it in the microwave and it came out fine. Enjoy. Thanks Lynette!

This was such a strange combination but really good.  My only complaint is that it is too unhealthy for our family to eat so we made it for a potluck and then no one knew if it was dessert or a main dish.  Had only crushed pineapple on hand but it still worked well.  Used splenda too but still too much butter and ritz crackers are not that healthy.  Why must all unhealthy foods taste so good! ??

I made this as a side dish to bbq last night for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, he loved it and picked up right away on the "odd mix of ingredients". I followed the advice of other reviews and cut the sugar in half. Also, I'd use half of the butter when I make again for the crumb topping.

This was very good, and everyone loved it. A good friend of mine makes a version of this that is wonderful. It got 3 stars because I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup as someone suggested and even lowered the amount of butter, and it was very very rich.  I cannot imagine how sweet it would be with the full amount of sugar.

Delicious. I use sharp cheese and more of it.  The cheese and the pineapple is soooo good together!  A family favorite and so easy to make.

Odd combination.  I followed the advice of others and cut the sugar in half.  It was still very sweet -- almost could pass as a dessert. It goes very well with the saltiness of ham.  I would probably make this again.

Our family loves this casserole every Easter, served with ham. We give it 5 stars!! I have used 1 (20 oz.) can of Pineapple Chunks, and 1 (20 oz.) can of  Crushed Pineapple, instead of 2 cans of chunks. I used a whole sleeve of Ritz crackers (35 crackers)...as in this case, more was better. Had lots of comments on how yummy it tastes and compliments the ham. I love handing out the recipe for this delicious dish~~

The flavors didn't really work for us. My husband loves to add pineapple to his pizzas. So I thought he would like it at least, but he didn't. The flavor combination was just weird!!!

This was just 'okay' for me. It is really sweet and seems to have too much butter. It turned out a little soupy even though I drained the pineapple well. Won't make this one again.

This is wonderful and very easy to make.  I've made it 3x now and have come up with a few slight modifications...  I reduce the amount of sugar as it was too sweet for my taste, I use 1/2 tidbits and 1/2 chuck pineapple, I add a bit of dehydrated onion.  Delicious!

I made this last weekend to put out with our bbq spread.  I doubled the recipe and I must tell you-- everyone just loved it.  It was the first dish to empty (in the first 15 minutes). I will definitely make this again... yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly (I think) but this didn't work for us at all. It just tasted like pineapples and cheddar cheese which didn't go together for our house. I won't try it again.

More like dessert.  Not really much flavor other than pineapple and bits of the cheese/cracker crumbs.  Not sure if would make again.. BUT if I did would use this to serve ice cream over it only.

I first had this dish in college - I almost passed over it because of the strange ingredient combo, but was starved for homecooked food... and now its my favorite side dish and a staple at my house!!  The only difference is that I use club crackers, not the ritz. I also think that a sharp cheddar is preferable to mild.  Try it, you'll like it!

I made this for our Christmas dinner, and it was excellent with ham.  I read the other entries suggesting to cut the sugar in half, but I made it as stated in the recipe, and it was a big hit.  It was a bit sweet, but again the taste was great with the ham.

Made this for one of my Christmas casseroles and the entire family had a fit over it!!!  It is sweet enough to almost be a desert. The cheese didn't quite melt completely...so I had to cook a little longer..GREAT RECIPE!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a goofy combination of cheese and pineapple but turned out fantastic.  My family loved it and it was the perfect compliment to ham.

This has been a fav of mine since I was a kid! Only adjustments I make are using one can chunks, one can crushed, more flour and a little less sugar, but the best part is mixing the crumbled crackers with some of the pineapple juice and melted butter! Oh yummmmmmy!!!

This recipe is great. I did read other reviews and cut the sugar in half. Even my picky children enjoyed it. No leftovers and husband requested it again 2 days later. A real keeper.

This was good. Was a little rich, next time will cut down on the amount of sugar and use a reduced fat cheese.

This is always a hit at potlucks - disappears very quickly.  It's very sweet for a sidedish, but it's perfect with ham.  I followed the directions exactly.

This was a bit different than I was expecting...it almost tasted like there was cottage cheese in the mix. 
It came out a tad sweeter than I would have liked, but everyone ate it.

Very good, but extremely sweet.  If not serving to a large crowd I would consider cutting the recipe in half.

This was pretty good.  I only used 1/2 the sugar called for and this was still quite sweet.  Next time I'll just use a couple of tablespoons of butter. 1/4 of a pound made this very greasy.

This recipe is good however a friend of mine makes the samething and with her recipe she mixes the butter with the cracker crumbs it tast much better that way. Also I took the advice of some of the reviews and only used half the sugar and I thought it need more sugar I use pineapple in it's own juice if that makes A diffrence.
