If you are looking for a quick, easy to prepare stir fry, then this is it. However, it is quite bland and has almost no flavor, so if you are looking for something spicy and sweet, this is not the best dish for that. It would be fine if you want a mildly flavored, light stir fry meal, but either doctor it up a lot or try something different if you want something that will tantalize your taste buds. This recipe will not be added to my family's menu, but it could very well please yours if your family prefers lightly seasoned dishes. I prepared this meal exactly as written.

Used 1/3 cup wine, added a few shakes of Tabasco. A little string on the sesame, but still needs something, maybe a few drops of fish oil next time. Added 1 Tbs of corn starch to thicken as others suggested, worked well.

I made as written and think there is room for improvement. The first being to use all fresh vegetables instead of frozen.  I found 15 minutes to be way too long cook time for the vegetables and also thought the dish could have used more color. Maybe use red bell instead of the green since you already have the broccoli and peas.  The main problem I had was that the sauce never thickened. I ended up having to mix a cold water and cornstarch slurry together to get it to thicken up.  I think this recipe has potential but as written I can only give it a 3.
