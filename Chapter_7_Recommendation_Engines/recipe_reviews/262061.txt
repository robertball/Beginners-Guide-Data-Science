Awesome. Instead of onion powder I used a full packet of onion soup. Loved it!

This was a big hit! The only things I did differently were I cooked the beef in sautéed onion then added mushrooms. I also added an extra half cup of milk (because that’s what I had left and didn’t want to waste it). Oh, and I added pepper. It fed 4 of us, including two teenage boys and there were no left overs! Simple and tasty, my kind of meal!

I made this recipe hoping it would be super quick and easy for those nights when everyone's tired and just wants to get dinner out of the way. I was not disappointed. The recipe was super easy, and to my surprise, super good. I liked that it didn't use cream of mushroom soup, because I'd have to make my own. Only thing I added was a couple chopped up mushrooms and more cheese. I also sprinkled cheese on top to make it look fancy. Thanks! I will make it again!

Really good, clean, easy recipe! Wanted to make something other than burgers with the ground beef. Love stroganoff! Tried this recipe for 2 reasons: 1) had all the ingredients :) and 2) not 'processed' ! Yay!  I did add dried mushrooms which were tasty, and added extra milk and beef broth as I probably added too many noodles, but otherwise made as directed. Will definitely make again!

After looking at the reviews and using this recipe as a guide, I made the following substitutions:
Gound turkey instead of ground beef,
Italian Seasoning blend instead of dried parsley (it's what I had on hand), 
1 tbsp minced garlic instead of garlic powder
1 med-large chopped onion instead of onion powder
Heavy cream instead of milk

I sauteed the garlic and onions, then added the meat to that pan, seasoned, used the stock to deglaze and went from there. 

My husband is very picky and has asked me to make this two more times.

Thank you so much! Sometimes we just don’t have all the ingredients for the traditional recipe. This shows how we can use what’s on hand. Great solution and big time saver! I didn’t have egg noodles but used spaghetti noodles.

Loved that it is a quick, easy, one pan meal, but I would add a vegetable or something else to it. I feel like it just need something else . . . will definitely make it again though, just adding a little something.

I made this as the recipe called for except I used a full cup of sour cream as it seemed a little dry. I thought it was very good and my husband liked it. I will be making this one again.

The change I made was sweating down garlic, onion and mushrooms prior to cooking the beef then instead of beef stock( didn't have any) I used chicken stock with liquid beef concentrate.  It was engulfed by my 2 teenage boys.  No box required.

I used real onions, added 1/2 cup of water and put in a frozen bag of peas and carrots to make this a real meal.  It turned out great.

I will definitely make it again.  Didn't have parsley so I just used Italian seasoning.  Instead of garlic and onion powder I used dried onion and a cube of crushed garlic.  Okay last thing...I used gluten free pasta (Pasta de'oro).

Super easy to make, my boys and daughter loved it. I added a little extra of each seasoning and I also added a season all to the meat while browning added graded parmesan on top delicious. And of course a little extra cheese in the mix??

I was looking for a  recipe for making an easy stroganoff without using a can of cream soup, and this recipe did the trick! I made some adjustments in meat , noodle , and spices. Sautéed mushrooms are a great addition.

I like mine thicker so we did what the recipe called for and extra side of cornstarch, flour, and water mixture. I added mushrooms to mine and added extra garlic salt. I probably will do heavy cream instead of milk next time.

Substituted powders for 1 onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Added black pepper as well as diced red and orange peppers to ground beef for colour. Used fresh parsley, fresh dill and fresh chives for green colour. Now it's a 5 star!

This was delicious and affordable. I added some mushrooms that were on sale and used onion soup mix. I also used penne because I didn't have egg noodles.

This was a hit with my family.  I made the dish with bison meat instead of ground beef & it came out very well.  I forgot to add the parmesan cheese at the end, but nobody noticed & we didn't miss it.
This is a great recipe to use mostly pantry ingredients.
Personally, I will cut back on the salt next time as I prefer lower sodium in general.

Used Better Than Bouillon and no extra salt - really good. Next time I’ll add mushrooms, onions and fresh parsley and decrease the amount of noodles.

Will definitely make it again! Like rural chef, I am trying to do away with "boxed dinners using ground meat" (you know the ones), but my husband believed that they were the end-all and be-all...emphasis on WERE. I used fresh mushrooms and leeks, dried whole milk powder and water (I had sour cream, but no fresh milk!) And served with Kosher egg noodles and the three vegetable blend of fresh broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. Complete in 45 minutes, tasty, fresh and low sodium!

The kids liked it. Said it was similar to the box version which they like.
