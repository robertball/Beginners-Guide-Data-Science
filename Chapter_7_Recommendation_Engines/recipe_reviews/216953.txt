Not a dough maker, this came out perfect. The dough was. A little dry so I just added a little more warm water. I did some w/eggs.  You should use small eggs, as you will have more room for filling. I also only needed 27 seconds in my microwave. At 40 sec they blew up.
My husband loved them and we served with Tapitio.

By making this gluten free, I could not roll out the dough and shape it.  I found that I could roll each piec into a 4" diameter circle, then I baked it.  It turned out to be a piece of good tasting bread with the beans and egg!

Thank you so much Nurit Cusack for submitting this recipe!  My husband is from Israel and grew up eating sambusaks all of his life made by his family, especially his Savta Chana!  When I sent him to one of our Israeli grocery stores here in Dallas, they did not have the frozen ones.  So I found your recipe and it was so easy!  My husband said these are the real deal and very authentic!  The only thing I changed was we didn't have the coriander so that got left out.  Savta Chana also put turmeric in the filling while cooking it so that's what we did.  SO yummy!

Can't wait to try this. The cornstarch is a nice addition for a lighter crust. I may even try a breakfast version with the whole egg! Thanks for the recipe

This was super yummy and surprisingly easy to make. I, did however, leave out the eggs because it seemed like too much extra work. I also used olive oil to fry instead of vegetable because it was all I had. I added extra water as well (1/2 cup total) since other reviewers mentioned the dough was a bit dry. That seemed about perfect! YUM!!! Thanks!

This dough was so dry my sambasks fell apart while frying.  I tried using water/olive oil to help seal the edges, then I used the fork again to crimp.  I'm so disappointed.  I think the dough definitely needs more than 1/3 c water....
