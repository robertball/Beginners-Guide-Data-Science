A very good alternative to store-bought, which allows you to adjust the flavors to your prefencence and ingredients to your diet. I soaked the chilis in some water beforehand and think this helps the mixing process as well as texture in the end. I also used fresh lemon grass and turmeric. Being allergic to shrimp, I used fermented bean paste and some umami seasoning instead of shrimp paste. Thank you for the recipe.
