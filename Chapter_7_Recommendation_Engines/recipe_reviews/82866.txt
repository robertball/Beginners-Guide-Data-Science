I regularly make Stephan's broiled Salmon Pesto and always have leftovers.  Reheated  salmon never tastes right to me so this recipe is perfect for the leftovers.  I used yellow onion instead of red, dill pickle instead of celery as I didn't have the recipe ingredients on hand.  I also added a little garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper.  Lettuce or cucumber on the sandwich isn't wholly necessary to enjoy it, but it does add a wonderful texture.

Oh, this is so good!  I lightened it up a little with light Mayo and by tossing a few egg yolks out.  You can play with the amounts to suit your tastes.  I also added the juice of half of a lemon and fresh dill which really brightened it up.  This made a great Sunday lunch with Spinach Salad with Kiwi and Strawberries (from this site).
