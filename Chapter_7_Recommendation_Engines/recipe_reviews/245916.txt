This is so easy and forgiving. I was dreading making brown rice away from home where the rice cooker makes it simple. The rice produced with this recipe is better than I get from the rice cooker and cleanup is much quicker. That cooker may go to a new owner!

Add seasonings and vegetables to your liking and this could become a pilaf.

This is a fantastic method. The bane of my life is boiling rice because it always a guessing game. With this method, in one hour you have light, brown rice that needs no supervision. One hour at this temperature rendered a slightly al dente grain. Thank you for the recipe.

as advertised, the rice comes out perfectly fluffy and perfectly cooked. It is, however, pretty bland. Would suggest using beef stock rather than water to give an extra flavor, and perhaps add in garlic or other spices, to your liking.

This is the only way I will make rice now. I hate sticky rice and I love how this comes out not sticky. I do use veggie broth instead of the water. Thanks for the easy recipe!

This turned out good (though not perfect) as far as flavor goes and the method of cooking.  Mine was crusty around the edges and a little dry even though I did add a little extra water.  This problem was not mentioned in any of the other reviews, so I am wondering if I goofed up somehow, even though I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little extra water which I am now glad that I did.   Next time I will be adding at least 3 cups of liquid.  Also, this is a great recipe to doctor up by adding (peas, carrots, onions, garlic, etc) or substitute other ingredients (chicken broth, beef broth, french onion soup, etc).  Thanks!

What an incredibly easy, delicious idea for making rice! The author suggests having fun with variations, so I did. I've been making rice lately by heating oil and sauteing  the rice and spicing until really hot, then adding the liquid, rather than boiling the liquid, adding rice, then simmering. It comes out a little less sticky or clumpy. Add vegetable bits toward the end of cooking, and you have a delicious pilaf! With this oven recipe, I put about a tablespoon of olive oil in the baking dish, along with a bit of ginger, garlic and basil pastes, (fresh, grated would work too), lemon zest and a squeeze of the juice, and stirred everything until the rice was completely coated. Then I proceeded per the recipe. Most  delicious brown rice I've ever made! I'm definitely going to try this method with basmati, jasmine and plain long-grain rice, too, just adjusting the liquid and cooking times. Thank you!

I used a high grade olive oil instead of canola, used a teaspoon of classic pesto. instead of brown rice, I used Lundberg Wild Blend rice and one cup of Mahatma Jasmine rice.  I used salt free Swanson's cooking stock-chicken. Cooked it for an hour, fluffed it and it's fabulous!

This is a great method for cooking brown rice easily to the ideal consistency without taking up a burner on the stove or buying a rice cooker. It’s easy to tailor the seasonings to your tastes and for the meal you’re making. I make a smaller portion, using 1 cup rice and 1 3/4 cups broth. I use olive oil, a large smashed garlic clove, salt/pepper and herbs to complement whatever I’m making, and I add all that right in the broth while I boil it. I use cooking spray in the baking dish and just one layer of foil (don’t know why you need two). It’s been perfect 3 times now :)

I did not totally love the texture of the finished product. Flavor was good with the addition of chicken stock and garlic flakes.

I have NEVER been able to make rice that wasn't sticky and gross despite numerous attempts, yet this recipe was a no-brainer.  The rice came out fluffy, tender and delicious, it was also very forgiving.  I initially forgot to cover the rice while baking and after an hour it was still uncooked, so I covered the dish tightly w/ foil and placed it back for another hour.  Perfect!

This is an amazing way to cook rice. I've made this recipe three times now and I've been impressed every time. Last night I replaced the water with chicken broth because the pork chops my husband was making did not have a lot of sauce. Delicious! I don't think I'll ever cook rice on the stove top again.

Guess I need to rate it 4 stars because I altered it, but with a few recommended changes, it is really terrific.   I subbed half chicken broth for the water, added pinches of black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder before baking, and it was great!  I will alter seasonings based on the accompanying dish.

This is very easy and the rice comes out perfect every time.  Sometimes I make it with different rice blends and add some spices, tasty!

Easy!  Also a great time save when you are already roasting veggies or meat.  I used broth to give it added flavor.   Veronica you are supposed to comment on the recipe not the cooking style of the submitter.   Your 3 stars was unfair.

The ONLY time I use stove top for rice any more is when weather is really hot and I don't want to turn on the oven.  I choose not to clutter my cupboards with extra one use only appliances when there is a better option.  I also use oven heat of only 235 - 250 degrees if I don't need it hotter for another dish.  Rice only has to simmer and 212 is boiling.

Works beautifully.  I usually use stock or broth instead of water for extra flavor, salt, pepper and a bit of butter.  Works great with Brown & Wild Rice mixes that I like.  Thanks!

Just had to modify measurement.  Amazed at how well it turned out; used 1/2 & 1/2 beef stock and water.  Great idea when you need the stove top for cooking other things.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent way to cook rice, perfect every time! Why purchase another appliance (rice cooker) to clutter up the kitchen when you can just pop this in the oven and forget it? If only clean-up was easier....next time I may try lining my dish with foil first, as well!
