Hard to believe that something coming out of cans can be this good! Perfect recipe! Added a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and only half of the hot sauce. Also added 3/4 of a cup frozen lima beans. Wonderful and I’ve already made it twice. This recipe is a keeper! (Castleberry‘s pork and beef barbecue works really well and has less fat with better shredded texture).

So was looking for a Brunswick Stew recipe that was close to the one I have made for years but now can't seem to find the canned pork and beef in the BBQ sauce.  So, I did like a couple of other reviewers and used a rotisserie chicken and pulled BBQ from a local restaurant.  I also used their BBQ sauce.  I left out the tomatoes because my recipe doesn't include that.  I left out the hot sauce but did add a little cumin and the juice of one large lemon which adds a little acidity to balance the sweetness of the cream style corn.  My husband LOVED it!!!!

This does exactly as stated. It makes a really good stew and it is very easy to make. You don't have to use a slow cooker, but this is definitely a dish that gets better day to day as the flavors marry. Even still, we ate it right away as soon as it heated up (Since nothing in this requires cooking) and was really good. Reminded me of the days getting in from the roadside BBQ places in the mountains.

Very tasty.  I used minced onion and added garlic.  I also added a tablespoon of cumin and 2 teaspoons of chili powder.  Since i can't leave well enough alone, i used a small can of diced green chilis instead of hot sauce  and 3 heaping tablespoons of pickle relish.  A cup of brown rice and simmer for 3 hours.  A whole meal in itself.  This is a recipe you can have fun with.   I made a big batch to can the leftovers in pint jars.  45 minutes to process in the canner.  I will have wonderful stew all fall.

I have made this several times and it is awesome. Due to the canned bbq pork I can buy being a little overly sweet, I have substituted unsauced cooked pork bbq (12 oz) and double up on the chicken (20 oz). This also allows me to add/use my favorite bbq sauce to my own taste and it turns out wonderful! I also have added carrots and green beans which also makes a nice addition. I like this recipe for the ease it is to make and it definitely tastes better each day as leftovers. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

Fantastic! I had to make a couple of changes....I couldn’t find beef in bbq sauce so I fried some gb and added kc bbq sauce. Also, we had our own smoked pork butt so I chopped that up and it turned out great!

A solid, simple stew put together with some left overs. I did not use packaged meat, but rather some leftover pulled pork and rotisserie chicken. I also added some celery. 

Next time I will add some more spices to increase the flavor depth.

Made this for my Aunts and Uncles who are great cooks!
They had never had Brunswick Stew before.  They really enjoyed it and wanted the recipe.  It was a wonderful version of this southern stew.
