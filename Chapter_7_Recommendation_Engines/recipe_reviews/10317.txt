This cookie is a little bland. I had to add 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract to add more zest to my second batch. Also there was too little butter to the amount of flour needed. (Ijjy)

I followed the recipe exactly except I added about 2 tbsp of cocoa powder (because we all know how good friends orange and chocolate are). They tasted pretty yummy but the texture was all wrong! They were like little cakes. I like my cookies chewy and a little crisp. These were neither fluffy and puffy. I won't make these again. Ever. Unless I need a good cake recipe.
