This was a great recipe and a great way for my husband to eat spinich.  I added whole mushrooms as well when I cooked the onions.  I also used beef broth instead of water to give it a rich flavor.  This is will be a go to for me!

This was very tasty!  In addition to the onions, I sauted mushrooms too.  I added garlic and cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  I omitted the tomato and served over a bed of rice.  This is something I will definately do again!

This ones a keeper! But I did season meat prior to sauteing, added a can of drained diced tomatoes, substituted beef broth for water, thickened sauce with a lttle cornstarch and served over rice. Yummy!

I really liked this recipe.  But I used peoples advice.  I used lawrey's salt, garlic, sliced mushrooms instead of tomatoes, added some sour cream, added a good amount of cayenne and served it over noodles.  Make sure you don't over cook steak in first step.  Very good.

I did what other reviewers said and added garlic and cayanne pepper to the sauce.  I also added about 3/4 C sour cream.  Seasoned the steak with Lawrys seasoning and served over egg noodles instead of the tomato.  Next time I will add sauteed mushrooms as well.  Very good after the adjustments!

I would leave out the tomatoes on the bottom next time but other than that this was really good. I did use the advice of the reviews.

Great dish. I substituted chicken breast browned and sliced into bite size pieces for the steak and doubled the rest of the ingredients. This was a real hit. and nothing left. It looks good too, per the picture.

I made this just as the recipe said, but I omitted the tomatoes and added mushrooms. It was very bland. I will try again, but I will follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and add some seasoning to the steak!

This was very good. I would say it is not something I would serve to company but if I am tried of the same old same old I would definatly make it again...The reason I found the recipe is I needed to use up some steak and some spinach and this recipe did the trick and was tasty...the only changes was I subed Rice for the tomatoes, threw in alittle yellow pepper i needed to use up and I added alittle white wine. I didnt measure anything just scaled everything as I was making it for one. also...I think this only took me like 15 min to make...max

So simple to make and so good. Something I would of expected on the menu of a fine restaurant, but with a home cooked twist. Fantastic!

This was ok, but a little strange to eat. It was soupy and I couldn't decide whether to eat it with a fork or spoon. It was very easy to make.

This was pretty good. I used cream of mushroom and garlic soup and added some extra seasonings. It was super easy and came together in less than 20 min.

I made this tonight with a couple of changes. I added garlic, replaced water with beef broth, and chopped the tomatoes and added with the spinach and served it all over egg noodles. Overall, it was just ok. I will make it again, as it was quick, easy and hubby liked it, but next time I will add some Italian seasoning or some other herbs to give it a little more flavor.

The flavour of this dish was wonderful, however, instead of the sirloin, I splurged and used beef tenderloin instead, and sauteed it until very rare....I find sirloin too tough once you slice it and the tenderloin was more tender - though I did not slice it very thin (and on purpose, of course).

This was okay... I didn't LOVE the taste but it wasn't bad. I used a good sirloin with it but it just didn't taste like I thought it should... I'd try it again and probably use garlic mushroom soup to enhance the flavor.
