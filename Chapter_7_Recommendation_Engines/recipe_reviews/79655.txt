I love this recipe, although the one I have is a little different. I use one 12oz bag of semi-sweet choc. chips and one 12oz bag milk choc. chips, with 1/4 block of para wax. The was does make the choc. not so thick, and it also helps keep them fresh/crunchy for a longer period of time!

Good taste, but a bit frustrating, the chips tend to break apart easily if you don't use the larger thicker ones.  My variation/remedy was to spread the chips on wax paper and then drizzle chocolate over the tops.  Easier and less irritating.

I really liked the idea around this recipe - I've always loved chocolate and chips so this was a perfect union in my eyes!  The only change I made was adding a little parawax to the chocolate so it wasn't so thick - it was easier to work with this way.

YUMMERS! I have been making these for years. I use pringles because they are more uniform in size and I'm anal that way. ;) Also I half dip them and drizzle w/ white chocolate for a pretty presentation. If you like the combo of sweet and salty, you will LOVE these! :)

Rigded/rippled chips are a must. I scraped off some of the chocolate with a spoon, otherwise it was too thick with chocolate. Don't make them too far ahead as the chips get soggy after a day or so. This really impresses everyone!

I haven't tried potato chips this way, but pretzels are awesome! Easier to keep without breaking (if they last that long!) too. In a nice container, they make an unusual and tasty gift for the holidays or a hostess gift.

Just as good as the kind you buy in candy stores! 

I popped mine in the freezer about 5 mins to get them to dry quick. It was so warm in my house from the other baking going on!

I made these exactly as written.  It's a good 'launching point'...the flavor is good and it's pretty easy.  My 3 stars is based on the recipe as written.  The second time I made them, I did so based on what I learned from the first time: I used candy coating discs with just a handful of chocolate chips thrown in. Great flavor and they set up much firmer than straight chocolate chips.  No need to worry about the temperature...just whisk and 'nuke' til fully melted.  I used ridged Kettle chips.  They're sturdier, hold up better to the chocolate and you actually get a potato chip flavor afterwards.  I held an end of the chip, dipped all but about 1/4 of the chip into the chocolate, gently wiped the excess chocolate off on the side of the bowl, laid the chip on a cooling rack (laid over a jelly roll pan) and added just a SMALL pinch of popcorn salt across the top.  We're huge fans of the salty/sweet combo and this is the 'icing on the cake' for that.  Allowed them to 'set' and stored in an airtight container.

This is a good recipe but I ended up microwaving my chocolate and I dipped half the chip in. It easier to handle.  I then heated white chocolate and drizzeled that over the milk chocolate.  They are very delicious.  I stored mine in the frige to keep the chocolate nice and cold.  Its a nice treat when you need that chocolate salty crunchy taste.

I found it was easier to use a microwave to melt the chocolate.  There were directions on the bag of chocolate chips.  If I would have had a decent set of tongs I would have used them but I used my hands and just made a mess.  I used a spatula to scrape off the excess as well as using it to add to the chips when I was just about out of chocolate.

Absolutely wonderful.  I only covered half my chip.  The whole chip was a little too rich for me.  I covered some with white chocolate and they are now my favorite.  I have taken these to 3 christmas parties and one man said he didn't know that potato chips could be improved on but I had done it.  Thanks so much

Been making these for a few years now and we prefer to use Wilton Candy Melts.  The texture is better and you have holiday colors to add making them more festive.  We also prefer to use a thick cut potato chip with ridges.  Thin chips do not provide enough contrast between the salty and sweet flavors and the chocolate over powers in ratio to potato crunch.  These are fun and easy to make and make a nice addition to our holiday cookie trays.

Good stuff! I've always been a huge fan of the sweet/salty combo, so these were right up my alley. I only dipped half the chip just to make it a little easier on myself since I was in a rush. Thanks :)

I make large cookie trays for the holidays and these are one of the most popular things that I include.  I usually have to make a double batch and hide half because my husband loves them.    You can ald dip the chip in half dark chocoate and half white chocolate.

I really like the way a chocolate potato chip can taste, but I sometimes want a little more salt, so I swapped in pretzel chips, dipped them half way, and let them set up on a nonstick rack that allowed drainage. It worked out great, just the right balance for me. Will definitely make again.

I saw one of the reviews to use para wax and I completely forgot to buy it, but I went ahead and did it without, but I added coconut and it was DELISH! I am going to try with pecan pieces also but try using the para wax.

This recipe was delightful. Using two 12 ounce bags  of milk chocolate chocolate chips made two cookie pans of these chocolate chips. They do break if you don't be gentle with the chips. To be gentle with the chips. Take a spoon full of melted chocolate and gently smother it on one side of the chip. Then turn it around then do the same thing with that side and put it on the cookie pan. Repeat that until the chocolate is gone. Let the chocolate eventually come to a hard like a candy bar. Another way to harden the chocolate in a fast way. Is to put in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.

Have been making these for 15 years...without a recipe!!  How did I manage. I use good chocolate wafers not baking chocolate chips. Bagged potato chips are too thin even the ridged. They do not hold up. Used to use Pringles but the stopped making the ridged.

Just finished making these. I LOVE Sanders dark chocolate chips, so I used a mix of dark and semi sweet chips. I couldn't find any parawax, so I thinned the chocolate with a little canola oil. My only change was to use lightly salted chips and add sea salt on the dipped chips while still wet. This is a must!!! It takes the chocolate to a whole other level!! Will make again!!

Super easy... I didn't temper the chocolate so I'll just keep them in the fridge which is fine. Nothing fancy, just cute
