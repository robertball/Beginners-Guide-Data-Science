This salad is a nice combination of flavors and textures.  However, I believe the salad dressing would benefit from the addition of some sesame oil, and maybe a dash of chili garlic sauce.

To tell you the truth, I didn't actually eat this salad.  I hurriedly took it to a potluck because I had the ingredients on hand.  The party organizer had so many requests for the recipe that she emailed me for it, so it gets five stars.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine because that's what I had.

Love this salad. It's super easy but looks sophisticated. It's the perfect item to bring to potluck - a guaranteed success! Just leave the ramen noodles and pecans in a separate bowl so that people with nut allergies can enjoy the salad as well.

Add pomegranate seeds to make a "Wreath Salad" for the winter holidays. Great texture mixing romaine, broccoli, and green onion. You can add 1/2 the Ramen seasoning packet to the dressing as well.

This is so tasty.  Everyone loves it when I make it.  The only thing I change is olive oil instead of canola.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner with our family and everyone loved it.  I used balsamic vinegar as I didn't have wine vinegar, and margarine instead of butter.  Really nice crunch to this salad.  Will definitely make this again!

This was really good.  Was asked for the recipe by all.  I used half the amount of sugar and just a dash of sesame oil.  Definitely can go with less sugar if you want because it was still delicious!

Lovely recipe!  My dear friend prepared this salad for us to enjoy on my Victorian porch on a warm summer day and it was perfect!  She added tender grilled chicken and it was wonderful. I highly recommend this salad.

I make this every holiday. It's such a nice detour from regular ranch or French. It's sugary so if you're diabetic this probably isn't a good option. But I love the combination of flavors.

Excellent salad! I make it all the time. I cut down the sugar in the dressing by half,-ish, and it's still great! So much of the salad derives it's taste from the dressing, the actual veggies one includes are versatile. I 'll often throw in avocado and sliced grape tomatoes as well! The broccoli adds a nice crunch.

My hubby & I dearly love this salad & I usually don't care for sweet dressings, but we could make a meal out of this salad & have in fact even eaten it  instead of dessert!!! I don't change a thing; it's wonderful just like it is!

This was superb! We even ate it for two days after. It did get a bit wilted, though it still tasted great! I did change one thing and that was to reduce the sugar down to 1/4 cup. It was still sweet enough for me.

I've made this salad several times,  its a pot luck favorite of everyone. But instead of ramen noodles I use crunchy chow mein noodles instead. I break them up and add them just before serving and adding the dressing.

My only suggestion is to cut way back on the sugar.  I used 3/4 cup instead of one cup, but it was still a bit too sweet.  I notice that one reviewer said 1/2 cup was fine, and next time I will do that.

What a hit!  Made just as directed and it is amazing!  Makes plenty of dressing that this can be stretched out for several batches of salad.

I have made this for many summer get togethers.  I did you walnuts instead of pecans and added a little more sugar.  It was a hit and the bowl was empty every time.

Love this!  Had something similar at a Packers game party, and have been wanting to make it for awhile.  I used olive oil, and didn't have red wine vinegar so I used half rice wine vinegar, half white wine vinegar, and a splash of balsamic vinegar and some sesame oil.  I also added fresh chopped cilantro.  The sesame oil really adds to it, IMO.  This will be a staple!

I didn't have any broccoli, so I used small pieces of diced celery.  I didn't have romaine, so I used a mixed bag lettuce, and a little baby arugula.  I used agave for the sugar, but all other items remained the same.  This was an amazing salad.  The dressing made a lot, so I will be able to use it for several lunches. Thanks for a great recipe!
