I am the submitter to this recipe. No need to line your cookie sheet. Allrecipes did not include that you must use a cookie sheet with raised edges, make sure it is THICK sliced bacon, the thin will burn too quickly and to be very cautious when taking the bacon out of the oven. I usually drain mine before TURNING it after 7 minutes. I hope that this helps. Enjoy!

This method of cooking bacon when you're either cooking a big breakfast or when you're making a lot of bacon is like having a kitchen assistant! More important, it turns out beautifully. However, I always use an oven temperature of 400 degrees, and find it takes 15-20 minutes. I've heard of brushing the bacon with maple syrup or sprinkling on brown sugar during the last few minutes of baking, but I've never tried that. Thanks for passing this easy cooking method along to others.

I have been doing this for years as I learned it in a restaurant I worked at. I line my baking sheet with foil. I didn't see any one mention this tip: Lay a sheet of foil over the top loosely to prevent spattering all over your oven! Remove top foil about 5 minutes before its finished baking for final crisping(I pour off the excess grease at this point,too.)

I will not use a frying pan ever again after using this method! I always place my cooling rack over my sheet pan and place the bacon on top. That way the grease drips through the rack and my bacon comes out crispy every time.

This is how I cook my bacon only I don't use thick sliced and I put my oven at 425 because it gets crispier...and I find turning it once helps both sides to be crispy....It's easy and you can just throw away the foil....

Wow. I am excited about this recipe! I love bacon and usually make it every weekend. If I'm pressed for time I'll do it in the micro but that is not as good. This morning I decided to try this recipe. Since it was just me (the cat had a piece too and she loved it) I only made a few pieces so I decided to make it in the toaster oven. I don't think 350 is high enough, so I did 450 for 10 minutes, then flipped it and cooked it for a few minutes more. It was perfect!! Crispy, flat and evenly cooked. Plus, cleanup was a snap (I used a sheet with edges). It was even easier to pour the bacon grease into my glass dish I save the grease in!! I don't know that I'll ever fry bacon again. One other great thing about making it this way is no odor lingers. Great recipe. Even if you're not baking for a crowd. By the way, you don't HAVE to use thick cut bacon. In fact, I used the lean Oscar Meyer Center cut. TRY THIS!!! Oh, and for a special treat sometime, when the bacon is almost done sprinkle it with a little brown sugar and a dash (just a dash) of cinnamon. This is also fantastic if you baste with just a little bit of maple syrup. Wow! Told you I'm excited about this recipe!!:))

Great idea!  So simple a caveman could do it  : ).  One extra thing that I do is save all that grease, pour it into a 8x8 cake pan lined with aluminum foil, mix in some corn meal and sunflower seeds.  Once it becomes firm you can cut it into four 4" squares and you have suet cakes for our fine feathered friends.  Everyone benefits!

I love bacon, but I hate frying it on the stovetop.  For myself, I generally nuke it to reduce some grease/fat, but DH is not a big fan of nuked bacon.  I'm so glad I stumbled across this "recipe" (more an alternative cooking method, than recipe).  So simple.  I place a wire rack in/on a cookie sheet and lay the bacon on top so the grease drips below.  I can only fit 6 pieces of bacon per cookie sheet (not touching...could prob squeeze 10).  I do not drain or flip, just bake at 400 for about 10-15 minutes for flat perfectly crispy bacon.

Thank you for a great way of cooking a bunch of bacon! I tried this on top of my broiler pan, to let the fat drain off, and I tried it as written. It is much better and cooks much faster as written! This is my new way of cooking bacon!

Love it!  This is such a great way to make bacon and it comes out picture perfect.  Each strip comes out uniform in shape and crispy.  I'll never make bacon in the frying pan again.  This was so easy.  I had to drain it a couple of times, put the oven at 400 and watched it carefully.  The results were definitely worth it.

I gave this five stars because it gave me the idea to put bacon in the oven.  After reading all the reviews, I tried mine two ways - first on a cookie sheet and then on a cooling rack over the cookie sheet.  I used thick sliced bacon and found that it cooked best on a cooling rack over the cookie sheet at 400 degrees.  It took about 15 minutes and I turned it once during cooking.  What a great way to cook bacon!!  I then let it cool completely, after draining it on paper towels, and stored it in single layers separated by waxed paper in the freezer.  Now, if we want bacon, we pull out the slices we need, microwave for about 30 seconds, and it is the best bacon ever!  Thank you so much for this wonderful idea!!

This method of cooking bacon is a keeper. It's way easier that frying up multiple batches in a frying pan. It also cooks them up perfectly and crispy (something the microway is not good at). It also frees up your cooktop and your hands for other stuff.

I go one step further.  I place a cooling rack in the cookie sheet and lay the bacon on the rack.  I place a second rack face down over the bacon.  The bacon stays in place and I can flip the racks over wearing oven mitts.  The excess grease drips down off the racks.

This is the only way I cook bacon now. No more turning, no more hot bacon fat splatters, (ouch) no more babysitting while it's cooking and it's done in a quarter of the time. Greatest idea ever Joyce and thank you!

My husband learned this fast, easy way to cook a lot of bacon while he was in the Army.  One suggestion I haven't seen here is to CRUMPLE your foil before lining the baking sheet to help the bacon drain as it cooks.  Oh, set the temp at 400 instead of 350, also.  If the bacon starts to pop, cover it loosely with foil until just before it is finished cooking.

I owned a catering and meal prep facility and this is how we cooked bacon all the time.  I did not use foil and we saved the bacon fat for flavoring other things we cooked.  As written I give it a 4 because of two things - the oven temp (as noted by some other reviewers) is too low - I bake the bacon at 400 F and you can use regular cut bacon - just keep an eye on it.  Someone said use a broiler pan but that's double work to clean and there's more room on a cookie sheet with 3/4" sides.  Thanks Joyce for posting.  It's a simple but great idea.

I ran a B&B for many years and used this method to cook great quantities of bacon.  I always used a rack on a rimmed baking sheet, lined it with tin foil and cooked at 400 for about 12 minutes.  Then I froze the bacon flat in single layers in plastic bags.  I could then take out as much as I needed and reheat in the oven for about 5 minutes .  It always came out crisp and flat for great presentation.  Our guests never left any on their plates.

If you like a leaner bacon, do not preheat oven.  The heating stage will help render more fat from the bacon.  Watch closely after the oven comes to temp (I use 400 degrees), the bacon goes from yummy to burnt very quickly.  Also, I never line my baking sheet (less waste), but I do use a rack to keep the bacon above the fat.  If not over cooked, the bacon fat is good to reserve for baking cornbread, frying eggs, seasoning beans, etc.
I've quit using a rack, it was just too hard to clean.  Otherwise, I still do not line my pan.

I love this recipe! I use it all the time when my family comes from out of town to visit. I always cook it at 400 or 425 degrees depending on how rushed I am! LOL I never bother to turn the bacon or drain the grease while it is cooking. As long as you use thick, good quality bacon you shouldn't have a problem with leaving it unturned. I hardly ever made bacon for a crowd before I found this recipe because it was so much hassle. I love that I can do it this way now! FYI: A friend told me that this is the way she has always seen restaurants make bacon. Guess that's why bacon on cheeseburgers in restaurants is always so yummy and crispy!

Tried this method over the holidays, and I will NEVER fry bacon in a skillet ever again, lol...I finally know how to make bacon crispy without being burnt like my husband likes it. I too line the pan with foil, use a spritz of pam on the cooling rack, and bake at 400 for about 20 minutes...and perfect bacon!

I found that if you do not preheat your oven, the bacon comes out as perfect flat strips. Crisp too. Works great.

I actually thought my husband must have posted this recipe..lol  This is EXACTLY how we have made bacon for 20 yrs!  It is PERFECT and SO easy!  The other step that should have been added is the clean up...if you have lined the pan thoroughly, the greatest part of this method is that you can let the bacon grease solidify and simply remove the foil & discard!  (We wash our cookie sheet, too, but it isn't covered in bacon fat!)

I have been doing this for years now, and not just when cooking for a crowd.  I cook the bacon until almost done, drain completely, set on paper towels or waxed paper and roll up, storing in a ziploc in frig.  Then, when I want bacon for breakfast, a BLT, or as a salad or recipe ingredient,  i take what I want, zap it in the microwave, and in a matter of seconds it's ready, without stinking up the house with that "fried bacon" smell.

I have used this method several times and really love it!  As stated by other reviwers, 15 minutes at 400 degrees does the trick when using thick cut bacon.  A reviewer's tip to line a cookie sheet with foil and then place the bacon on top of a cooling rack is genius- no flipping required!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Do not let bacon sit on baking sheet once it is done. It reabsorbs some of the grease and gets very unappetizing.

I've been doing this for years.  I learned it from the cook at a dude ranch we used to go to.  Great way to cook for a crowd.  One other thing I do is this...I cook two or three pounds of bacon (not all at the same time, but one sheet right after another) so I only have to "smell" up my house once in a while.  I freeze the cooked bacon and then just take out what we need and zap it in the microwave for a few seconds.  I've also done this for years and it works whether you are stove top, microwave or oven cooking your bacon!

This is the only way I cook my bacon!  I learned from a restaurant as well.  I don't use foil, however.  I use parchment paper - 375 - 20 to 25 mins.  Thin sliced bacon only for me.  (just my preference)  Thanks for posting!

I too have made bacon like this and I love that you don't get hurt with the popping splatters of bacon.The recipe I had said bake at 425 for 10 min. then take pan out and drain off grease, sprinkle with brown sugar, chili pepper and pecans. I've never tried the pecans but using the other two is amazing. Not sure if I got the recipe on this site but I use it all the time. Just have to be careful or my son will eat an entire pound of bacon by himself!

I married a man from the south (Northen Mississippi) I'm from the high desert, where everything worth eating WAS cooked in grease.. even grease..
My Southern mother'n-law taught me this baking-bacon method and I've never turned back!  It's the BEST!
I like to take mine out and drain them on paper towel then toss the whole plate into the microwave for 30-60 seconds for a final crisping!  
If you're not cooking for a crowd, this is still awesome because the left over baked bacon is PERFECT on a sandwhich the next day!  Or try recrisping for 90 seconds for bacon bits for salads.
The only "hang up" is you gotta clean the pan right away.  If you leave the PAN for tomorrow, the bacon trails will just as well have chemically bonded to your cookie sheet.  But while warm, a few swipes with a paper towel and a quick warm water dishpan and clean up is just as easy.  
I was SO GLAD to see this recipe here!  genius.. really!

What a great way to cook up lots of bacon at once without the worry of bacon spatters! I did need to cook for closer to 30 minutes, and next time will turn the heat up to 400 degrees to see if that will work better. Perhaps I put too much bacon (slight overlap) on the tray. Next time I will place on 2 trays, and swap shelf location halfway through the cooking time.

Made this tonight for a breakfast for dinner. Oh My Gosh!!!! This was amazing.  Used a large sheet pan and lined w/ foil and put a cooling rack on top. I used thick cut bacon and the entire package fit perfectly! Several reviewers said to up the temp...I just went to 375* and after about 12 mins I raised the temp to 400*.  Next time I will start at 400 or prob 425* (and there will absolutely be a next time!)  I took a Tblsp of brown sugar and sprinkled it over the bacon when there looked to be about 5 min of cooking time remaining.  It was delicious. My husband said it was the best bacon we had ever had.  Along w/ the French toast we had, it was a wonderful dinner.  Thanks for the new method of cooking an old favorite!!

This is a great way to cook bacon for a larger family. I found out by trial and error though that when I did it without the liner, the bacon stuck to the cookie sheet. I used thin cut bacon and it broke when I tried to remove it because it was stuck on. I did it again with parchment paper and it worked out better. This made the whole package of bacon at one which made meal prep so much faster!

This is the method I use, whether cooking for a crowd or not.  I use a 300 degree oven, line with foil for easy cleanup, and cook for 30 minutes or so, while everyone is waking up - this gives them time to get hungry for breakfast.  With this method, the bacon comes out just right, whether I use thick or regular.

I've found this method works best when you don't preheat oven. I have been cooking bacon this way for some time and learned the following: I line sheet w/parchment paper (but foil works fine too). This makes for easier clean up plus avoids my experience: The one time I didn't, my pan was left with ugly permanent cooked on bacon shapes. 
My personal pref is to flip the bacon (after 10 minutes) and drain off any excessive grease at that time (carefully tilt/use corner of pan.) I agree with many others, at 350 this requires much longer cook time then written (even regular slice) so I go with 400 degrees. I check every few minutes after flipping. Note: I've only had smoke issues if going over 400 or excess grease not drained off. Don't cook for a crowd?  Roll up extra in p towels - put in zip bag and refrigerate or freeze to have pre-cooked bacon you can re-heat in a snap. Sorry, didn't plan to get long winded about a method to cook bacon, got carried away, LOL.

I always have cooked my bacon like this. It is super easy and frees up my time to do other things in the kitchen. However, I cook mine at 400 degree for 20 minutes.

easy way to get more done at once, and the foil makes for a quick and easy cleanup. I also put a piece of foil on top of the pan, loosly, to avoid splatters as another reviewer mentioned. Would preffer less grease though, although I did drain anyway. May look into a metal rack as others suggested.

I finally cooked bacon this way. Love it!! I only give it 4 stars because it needs way more time. I finally turned it up to 400 like suggested. Did 4 pounds in two batches. Put in down on foil, I debated about using a rack but didn't. Worked out fine without, just crimped/folded two sections of foil together and covered the pan. Thanks Joyce!

This is the best way to make bacon!  The only thing I do differently is to cook it on my broiler pan that way the grease drips into the bottom pan instead of sitting on the bacon.  This also reduces splatter in the oven so I don't have to clean it as often.  We are only a family of two.  I cook up my bacon this way then freeze it in a single layer on cookie sheets, bag it up in a freezer bag after they are frozen. It will keep this way for several months.  I reheat as much bacon as I need wrapped in a paper towel in the microwave for 30 seconds to a minute.

This is great for me.  I crumble it and freeze it in a jar.  Then have it ready all the time for quiches,soups,frittatas.
I also save the bacon grease for those occasions when I need both the bacon and the drippings. A real time saver.

I have cook like this for many years, but I would use broiler pan, but even better now I always place my cooling rack over my sheet pan and place the bacon on top. That way the grease drips through the rack and my bacon comes out crispy every time and you don't have to turn the bacon

I can make this recipe even better. Don't use a baking pan, use a broiling pan. The fat drips down into the bottom, and the bacon gets crisp.  I haven't used a pan to fry bacon unless I was camping!!! YOU WILL NEVER USE A FRYING PAN AGAIN -- OR A BAKING PAN!!

Most restaurants cook their bacon in the oven and that is where I learned.  400 degrees is the preferred temp.  The OP said that regular thickness bacon will burn but this isn't true at all.  Between home and restaurants I'm sure I've cooked way over 1000 pounds of regular sliced bacon at 400 degrees.  Flipping the bacon half way through helps it cook more evenly but it's not absolutely necessary.  Separating any overlapping slices is a good idea though because they will really stick together as they crisp up if you don't.  

I should add that in restaurants and at home I have used a convection oven @ 400 degrees which helps it cook faster.  400 to 425 In a regular oven works well too.

I love this!  It beats out the microwave and stovetop pan methods by far.  From here on out I will cook bacon using only this method!  The only thing is that we found it may take 20 minutes depending on the thickenss and number of slices you're trying to cook at once.

I cook bacon this way often.  No greasy mess to deal with on the stovetop.  I used to fry on the stovetop and use a splatter screen but found it inconvenient because of the need to situate & turn frying bacon.  I discovered the cooking instructions on the packages for the oven and rarely fry it now.  Most packages of bacon indicate a 400* oven for 10-15 minutes.  I put the bacon on a rack to help eliminate the bacon sitting in the grease and there's no need to turn for even cooking & crispness.

I line a jelly roll pan with foil and bake at 375, checking after 12 minutes. I bake the entire package in batches and place the extra on paper towel and roll it up and place in a gallon ziplock back and freeze, then if I need a few slices of bacon I can easily remove them and reheat in the microwave for 15-30 seconds.

This is the best way to prepare bacon for use in recipes. You can easily prepare the rest of the dish while the bacon cooks and cleanup is a breeze... no bacon splatters all over your stove. I always use this technique when making bacon for BLT dip or anything that calls for crumbled bacon. I always line my pans... who wants to scrub bacon grease if they don't have to? :)

This is a great way to make bacon instead of hanging by the stove flipping every few minutes. Also, no grease around the stove to clean up. But keep an eye on them. For me it seemed a fine line between being perfectly done and starting to smoke.

I've cooked bacon like this for years, but use a cooling rack over the backing sheet.  This way the bacon doesn't sit in the grease!

This worked out really well for me. I used thick cut peppered bacon and layed them slightly over lapping on a rack on top of a sheet pan. I cooked them until they were very crisp, about 25 minutes at 400° and they came out perfect for our BLT club sandwiches. I also double lined the pan with foil for an easy clean up. So much easier than the huge skillet I usally use.

I used regular cut, not thick and baked at 400 on a rack on a baking sheet. It still took over 15 min and wasn't done to my liking but the smoke prevented me from baking it any longer. I'll finish it in the micro if necessary. I didn't think this was worth the mess/smell in the house, I'd rather just use a skillet. I'm glad I tried it but I probably won't use this method again.

This makes cooking bacon so easy!  I don't like cooking it on the stove b/c the grease splatters, but this eliminates that problem!  Don't forget to cover the top lightly with foil so that it doesn't splatter all over your oven.  Oh, and this usually takes 25 minutes to get the bacon as crispy as I like it.

Turns out great this way, but BE CAREFUL!  I keep a box of baking soda on the back of the oven always and have never needed it until my husband started cooking bacon this way.  The splatter can ignite your oven, so be prepared!  It only happened one time but that was enough!  This method doesn't burn the grease and causes fewer bacon "crumbs" so I prefer this since I run the grease through a coffee filter and refrigerate it for use in other recipes.

Oven baking the bacon is my family's favorite way to eat bacon. I did bake the bacon at 400º  I did use foil on the bottom which made for a quicker clean up.  The time will vary depending on the thickness of the bacon. I start watching the bacon around 10 minutes. When you see bubbles on the bacon, watch closely because the bacon is almost done.

This is a great way to make bacon. Since I found out about this method, I've never gone back to the frying pan. I don't bother to line the pan with foil. I've also found that you can really crowd the bacon in--it shrinks as it cooks.

Awesome method.  I learned this a few years back at a trail ride place we visited but I couldnt remember the time/temp and was just curious if anyone had posted a recipe and was happy to find this.   So nice when you have alot of other stuff going, just one less thing to worry about and they turn out perfect every time - all by itself - no turning needed.  Just be sure to set your timer.

Perfect, no-mess way to cook bacon! We used this method every day in culinary school and they do this in other restaurants I've worked at. We've always just popped the bacon in the oven, regardless of the temp...just cook until done! At home, I like to flip it over about half way through to make sure it gets crispy.

Much better than frying.  I put parchment paper on top to prevent splatters and leave it on the whole
baking time.  I also put foil on cookie sheet and throw drippings and foil away.  No mess!

Used this oven method and was skeptical but it worked great!  I placed one pound of regular sliced bacon on the rack in my broiler pan.  Preheated oven to 400 degrees and baked for 20 minutes - bacon was crisp, didn't curl and was delicious (all of the grease drained into the pan).  Biggest problem I had was keeping everyone away from the bacon (they kept wanting to eat it). Made BLT's - easy on a hot summer day!

You do not have to turn the bacon.  It will completely cook.  I cook mine for at 13-15 minutes at 425 degrees and it comes out perfect every time.  I line with foil to minimize cleanup.  This works for thin bacon as well as thick.

Pardon the pun, but this recipe has saved my "bacon" many a time!  Like other viewers I bake it on a cooling rack and found that thick sliced bacon works best.  Thanks, Joyce, for submitting a recipe that helps cooking breakfast for company easier.

One Sunday while baking frozen biscuits  the biscuits needed 25 minutes,I decided to put the bacon in the oven 
 I used an ex-large cookie sheet with sides & lined it with parchment. It took 25-30 minuts at 375deg to bake, we like ours extra crispy. I did turn the bacon after removing the biscuits, but sometimes I just leave it...this is much easier than cooking it in the microwave...

Easy, so convenient.  I often can get overwhelmed while preparing breakfast because I like to serve everything hot... I decided to try this since I was making 2 other items at the same time.  I followed the recommendations.  I used regular bacon and lined a cookie sheet with non-stick foil.  Cooked in 400 degree oven, turned and drained fat midway.  The result was crispy and delicious.

If you put the bacon on a baking rack on a baking sheet the fat will drip off and you don't have to turn it at all.

My mother showed me how to cook bacon this way years ago.  I don't preheat my oven though. I line my cookie sheet pan with foil and lay down the bacon, preferably not touching the sides.  I put it in the oven and set the temp on 400.  I set the timer according to the thickness of the bacon.  Thick sliced is usually set around 18 to 20 minutes and thin sliced around 15 to 18 minutes.  You may have to experiment a little on your oven to get the right time. I check on it close to the end to make sure it's not burning and I never turn it.  Once done, I carefully take it out the oven to avoid any grease spills and then place the bacon on paper towels.  I also put a paper towel over the top and press very lightly to remove as much grease as possible.  Works like a charm every time.

What a great method!  I agree with others- feel like my house smells a bit less by cooking in the oven!

So much easier to make bacon this way and does not smell up the house as much.  I have found with 2 trays of bacon it takes about 30-40 minutes to get crisp.  Everyone loved it, nice and flat, perfect crispiness and great flavor!

I wanted to cook 3 lbs in a big batch for later use. I've been cooking bacon in the microwave for over 20 years with no issues.  I have it down to a science.  Modifications:  Raised edge cookie sheet with  cookie rack on top to drain grease while cooking, 11-12 slices Hormel Black Label "Thick Cut" (which is not very thick), 400 to 425 degree oven.  Results:  425 degrees works much better than 400 degrees (1st batch) for crispiness.  Overall cook time for 11 - 12 slices was about 15-20 minutes.  Turn over bacon with tongs or fork at 10 minutes!  (Note: I tried the foil on top to cover splatters during 1st batch @400 degrees, but that did not really do anything except frustratingly lengthen cook time. The bacon doesn't splatter because it is pretty lean.)  Pour off grease that falls into the cookie sheet between batches.  Remove bacon from cookie sheet rack and drain on paper towels over another another rack. Use or freeze flat for later use. Verdict:  Use micro for small batches at 1 slice /minute.  Use oven for large batches as described. Bacon was flat and restaurant worthy.

My chef son told me about baking bacon. I run it though flour before putting it on parchment paper on cookie sheet at 400 degrees for approx. 20-25 mins., perfect every time!

Can't believe I never reviewed this!! This is the only way I cook bacon anymore. No splattered stove top to clean. Line the pan with foil. Let the grease cool, fold the foil and toss! I also notice I don't have the linger of bacon in the air for 2 days. Great idea!

This is the ONLY way to cook bacon! My husband and I have been doing it this way for years, and it's such a wonderful no mess way to get crisp, delicious bacon. you can still save drippings, too. 
We do line the baking sheet with foil, because I'm lazy, and love throwing away the mess, giving the sheet a quick zhuzh with soapy water...voila!
I do find if I want to do more than a pound, I change the foil after each pound.
The only down side to this is you may find yourself cooking more bacon than ever before!
Thanks for submitting such a great idea!

Gee, I thought I invented this! lol
Actually, I love this method as well.  I use parchment paper, and it works beautifully, too. I love that it makes a lot of bacon at the same time, which as another reviewer mentioned is great for BLT's! It also works well if you want to make some bacon bits for potatoes or salads.

I love cooking bacon t his way!  I use a metal cookie cooling rack placed in the lined cookie pan.  This allows the grease to drip off during cooking and the heat to reach all sides of the bacon.

I have been doing this for years. I use the cookie sheet with an edge, line it with parchment paper and my stove has an convention roast setting that I set to 400 degrees. After cooking and removing the bacon I lay two sheets of paper towels in the grease and a few minutes later I just fold up and discard the parchment paper and put away the clean cookie sheet. Love this method.

I use a slightly different oven method and it works every time.  I heat oven to 375.  I use my broiler pan; that way the grease goes into the lower pan.  I bake for 10 minutes then turn the rashers and cook another 10 minutes.

Just cooked up a pound of regular cut bacon. Started out at 7 min at 350. Opened oven to turn it - wasn't necessary. Cooked another 7 min. Not cooking fast enough. Still did not turn it. Up'd oven to 425 and set timer for another 7 min. No turning and no draining - set another 7 minutes. 28 minutes total - perfect bacon. This is a keeper. It would be great to cook bacon this way if you are timing it to be ready with other dishes. Bacon is brown, moist and perfectly flat! Thanks!

This is the only way to cook bacon if you like it crispy. Pluss How has a pan that can do a whole pound at once.
MAKE SURE TO COOK ON A WRIE COOLING RACK ( ON A COOKIE SHEET) SO YOUR BACON IS NOT SITTING IN THE GREASE.

I hated making bacon before but now, to my family's great delight, it's a cinch and I don't mind at all!  Whenever I tell people I make our bacon in the oven they are flabbergasted.  Great, great idea.

So easy! What took me so long to try this?!?! Well, we don't eat bacon very much. I did use the foil which makes clean up a breeze! However, this took me at least 25 minutes at 375. I turned them over half way through. Thank you for this recipe!

Super great idea for fixing bacon.  When I fix bacon I always fix at least three pounds because I don't want to cook bacon again for awhile.  With this recipe I no longer have to stand for an hour turning and getting splattered with hot grease, plus the mess is almost non-existant with the hints from other reviewers (laying foil over the top & putting the bacon on a rack).  I cook the bacon until it's done but still limp.  Then put it into plastic sandwich bags and freeze it.  That way I just grab a bag out of the freezer, put the amount needed for breakfast in a paper towel on a plate and microwave it for about 25 seconds.  If I want crispy bacon for a sandwich placing it on a griddle on the stove it's ready in a jiffy with no mess or splattering because most of the grease is already cooked out of it.   Joyce...Thanks ever so much for the posting.  Mary Jane

My bacon turned out perfectly cooked, not all curled up, and there's no mess to clean on the stove top!  I didn't use thick cut, just regular sliced, and it still took about 20-25 mins to crisp up the way we like it.

The TEMPERATURE and TIME are way off base.  After 1/2 hour, I read some reviews.  I didn't think I had to with a 4 1/2 star recipe.  By the time the bacon was done, the rest of the meal was cold.  I'm giving it 3 stars because you can get great results by turning the temperature up and watching it closely; and, I will be making it this way again.

I will use this method from now on! I read the other reviews first, and I did bump the temp up to 400 as suggested by some. My thick bacon turned out perfect. I set the timer for 10 minutes, turned it, and then put it back in for another 10 minutes. Excellent!

I haven't tried the oven version yet, but when I cook my bacon in the microwave, I put it on top of paper towels that I have sprayed with a no-stick cooking spray. This way you don't have a lot of grease to pour off and your bacon isn't swimming in a lot of grease. Probably fewer calories, too. Then again, you might want to save the grease to cook in something else, like greens, or bean soup. Katherine Aug. 3rd 2009 I have made this recipe several times since my first review. I put a cookie cooling rack in a cookie sheet, I put the paper towels on top of the cookie rack, spray the paper towels with cooking spray. Make sure paper towels are inside of cookie sheet. If not, the grease will drip on the oven and smoke. Once I left the bacon in too long and it got to crispy to serve. I crunched it up for bacon bits and put it in the freezer. Katherine Dec. 7 2008

My father in law was a cook in the navy and had always cooked bacon this way. So, I too have been using this method for many years now. In my opinion it is the only way to cook bacon! There is no hot grease splatters everywhere,nor burns on you from the grease,easier clean up, and the bacon does not shrink up as is common with pan frying nor does the bacon curl up. Just try this method...

I've been using this method for many years.  I use 400 degree oven for about 20min.  I've used thick and thin bacon and both work well you have to watch thin bacon more closely.  Thank you for posting - many people can now be set free from babysitting bacon! :)

Cooking in the oven makes the best bacon ever!  I use a 9X13 glass pan.  No need to line with foil.  No need to turn it.  No need to drain it.  I just put it in there and time it for 20 minutes at 375 and it turns out perfect every time.

I tried to follow this exactly, but the bacon wasn't cooking fast enough at this baking temp... (might just be my oven) so I used the same temp and broiled.  Also, I used a standard broiler pan lined with foil to catch the drippings...just because I hate to clean up! Regular bacon worked fine...though a couple pieces that were not overlapping did cook quicker than the others.  I just pulled those out sooner. I've used this idea twice now in the 2 weeks since I found it (frees up the stove and saves time while making pancakes)... I'm so glad you posted this Joyce! Thank you!!

WOW! I'm so glad I found this recipe. My husband loves bacon, but I hate to make it. I am not a fan of hot grease popping on me or around my children. I made this bacon for my husband this morning and he loved it. The best part was no messy clean up. I just threw the foil in the garbage. I did up the temp on my oven to 400 degrees and I had to leave it in for 25 min., but my husband likes his bacon almost burned. I will be making this again for sure.

I've wanted to try this technique for a while now and finally got my chance tonight. The bacon turned out crispier than when I use the microwave and it was easier than frying. I followed other's suggestions and cooked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. I like my bacon very crispy.

I lined the rimmed cookie sheet with foil and preheated oven to 400. I also put a metal grid style cooling rack in the cookie sheet and put the bacon on it. This allows the grease to drain while baking. Took about 15 minutes and no flipping was needed. It is the Best way to cook bacon.

This turned out great, I did as another reviewer suggested and put foil over the top so it would not splatter.  Great concept especially if your making a lot for different recipes for a party.  You can even throw in some diced onion or garlic to cook along with it.  Thanks so much for the post.

I put the bacon on my broiler pan and lined the bottom with foil and then baked it and it was great! I will make my bacon in the oven from now on! It was nice to be preparing the french toast and eggs without having to "babysit" the bacon! Also, I only had thin sliced bacon and it was still quite delicious!

After reading a lot of the previous reviews, I used a foil lined cookie sheet with a rim and cooked 1 pound of thick cut lean bacon.  I also  turned the bacon over half way through.  However, I did use a 400 degree oven and it took about 25- 30 minutes before it was done and crispy.  This could be due to the lean cut since I did not have enough bacon grease to even warrant draining.  Before discarding the  foil, I used the same foil lined baking sheet and roasted Brussel Sprouts in the bacon drippings (I did toss with olive oil and seasonings first).

Wonderful way to cook bacon.  Evenly cooked, unlike on the stove.  I used this recipe for thin and thick bacon and it worked for both.  When I cooked the thick bacon, though, I followed the suggestions of others and turned up the heat of the oven.  It took too long cooking it at 350.  Thanks.

I tried a different spin on the recipe in that I placed the bacon on the broiler pan which lets the grease drip down into the pan and keeps the bacon free from the polling of the grease.  same directions otherwise.  The bacon doesn't shrivel up and curl up like it does in a skillet.  Great results.

Best bacon ever! I got a small rack from the $tree and put bacon on that on cookie sheet. Because of reviews I put temp between 375-400, cooked for 20 min, turning once. Not even enough grease to soak paper towel. I cook for myself and will use this always. Crispy, non-greasy bacon.Yum

I have been cooking bacon like this for about 15 years.  I will never go back to frying or a microwave, the oven is the best and easy clean up.  I use my broiler pan and jelly-roll pans with a cooling rack placed inside it.  If I have time I will flip the bacon but if not it still turns out great.  I have done it low and slow, 275 degrees and it takes about 2 hours or high and fast, 400 and it's done in 15 minutes.  Whatever you schedule requires.  Just experiment.

I'm cooking the bacon as we speak. I have already cooked bacon 25 mins and think it needs another 5-10 mins. Smells wonderful. I guess I like my bacon cooked longer than the original poster. I like my bacon crisp so this may not be the best method for cooking it. I do thank the original poster for the recipe and the idea to cook bacon in the oven. Love the less mess part of this!

I made this bacon for my husband and actually ended up using it in a breakfast burrito. It ended up needing to be cooked for about twenty minutes but that might've been because my husband likes his bacon extra crispy. I'll be making my bacon like this from now on.

I have been cooking bacon this way for years, but I heat my oven to 400 degrees if it's regular cut bacon, or 425 degrees if it's thick cut.  Thin takes 12 to 15 minutes, thick, closer to 20.  I also use a broiler pan, lightly sprayed.  If it's just my husband and I, I use my toster over, more than that, I use my regular one.

This will change the way I make bacon. Thank you! It cooks evenly and the foil makes clean up so easy. Plus no grease splattered on my stovetop. But the best part is I can stick it in the oven and not need to mess with it until it's done. so easy!!

I have been baking bacon for years. I live alone so I cook one or two pounds at a time but I  don't  cook it until it crispy and well done. I take it out of the oven just before it reaches that stage. I cool it and put the slices into a large plastic bag. Then when I want bacon, I can microwave a few pieces or fry it until done in a frying pan.  It will keep in the fridge for a long time.

I used thin-cut bacon and placed on a broiler pan at 425, with a little water in the bottom of the broiler pan, and baked for 15 minutes. I turned the pieces over and baked for 15 minutes more. Although a few pieces in the middle looked raw, they were crunchy and wonderful. Note: I overlapped the pieces, since my bacon had a thin side and a thick side. I alternated placement so a thin piece was next to a thick piece, and it was perfect for our "breakfast for dinner." Keeper!

9/10/14* This made making bacon easier. Cooked a pound at a time for sandwiches. Clean up made easy also. Will be doing bacon this way from now on. 10/13/15* Also wanted to say this way the bacon does not curl and shrink. I used thick bacon so it did take maybe 10 minutes longer..WE LOVE IT!!! Thank you Joyce.

I used thick bacon just like the recipe called for BUT after 15 minutes they weren't done enough. I put them in for another 5 minutes and it was pretty good then. So I would CHANGE IT TO 20 MINUTES INSTEAD OF 10-15. It was so easy and nice not to splatter oil on the stove or on me and not get the frying pan out and then have to watch it. A great way to save time is to freeze the bacon after you cook it like this. When you need a bit of cooked bacon for say a burger, breakfast taco or baked potato then voila! There it is!

Even better - put a rack in your sheet pan & put the bacon on it.  The bacon comes out very crispy and all that bacon grease can be poured into a jar or into the trash, your pick!

I've been doing this for years, except I do 400 degrees and use a 
broiler pan. Doesn't sit in grease. Cooking time depends on thickness
of bacon and how crispy you want it. For thick sliced, approximately 20 minutes.

This took double the time...about 30 minutes total.  Tasted great though!  I like the way it's not soaking and cooking in grease the whole time!

I can't wait to try this way.  I have a family of 7 so cooking bacon for that many is a chore.  But we love our bacon on the weekends.

I have been doing bacon like this for years as well. Definitely the easiest way that I've found. I do line my cookie sheet with aluminum foil, not only for easy cleanup, but it also is an easy way to save all that wonderful bacon grease. I just make a spout with the one corner and pour the grease into a jar.

I like this method! I had to cook mine longer though, about 22 minutes or so. Even then, it wasn't as crispy as I like. I used Oscar Meyer bacon and it said to cook at 400 degrees for the oven method. I'll do that next time and hopefully my bacon will be very crispy. Thanks Joyce!

Following the recipe/method exact....my bacon actually took 32 minutes to cook, and a couple more minutes for 2 pieces that were in the middle of the pan. I think I'll try a higher temp next time & see if I can get it to cook quicker cuz I love the idea & the flavor was good. Minimal shrinkgae & no curling of the bacon.

This worked out great.  The bacon laid nice and flat, and the clean up was quick and easy.  The only change I would make is to use a hotter oven next time because I like my bacon dark and crispy.

I have also been doing this for years...but I line my pan for easy clean up and I put my bacon on cake rakes...a lot less grease...I even do mine the night before and reheat in the microwave...works great!  Just be sure to put paper towel underneath when reheating...

This recipe has intrigued me for a few  years.  Today I finally gave it a go and I'm so glad that I did.  Goodbye smoke- filled, grease-spattered kitchen!!  This is the way I will be makin' bacon from now on.  I used regular bacon (not thick)and I adjusted my oven to 400.  PERFECT :)

dark pan - use foil or thin bacon will burn.
light pan - no foil OK, but clean up is easier with foil.
I've never experienced spatter as noted in one review, no need to cover

This is the absolute best way to make bacon!! I always line my pan with foil. Easier to clean. It turns out perfect every time. Mine usually takes longer than 10-15 mins though.

I haven't tried this yet but sounds good.  I have cooked my bacon for years in the microwave between paper towels. I cook a pound at a time using 6 layers of paper towels for about 10 min. then I take it out remove the paper towels, put fresh ones down with bacon and cook for 4-5 min. more. CRISP and no grease or splatter.

I line a baking sheet with parchment paper, start in cold oven set to 400 and when the oven comes up to temp set the timer for 5 min - depending on the thickness of the bacon - no muss no fuss no shrinkage and if you have a convection oven all the crisper.  Clean up is a breeze just toss the parchment paper and wipe down the pan and you're done.

i use this method tho i use a metal rack over the backing sheet and you dont have to stop and drain i thinki it goes faster too. just line the strips on the rack not the pan so it drips down. the heat surrounds each slice and as far as coating the bacon ive done montrael steak seasoning on the bacon and also brown sugar both still work this way

This makes cooking bacon a lot easier, especially when I have to make a lot of bacon. It also allows me to keep from getting splattered by hot bacon grease. I usually use the leftover grease in the pan to mix with barbecue sauce.

I've cooked bacon like this for years. I think the cooking time is way off in the recipe. I cook mine, without turning it, in 425 for about 25 minutes and it is not really totally crispy cooked even then. I cook mine, drain it and bag it up in paper towels in a large zip lock bag and refrigerate it. Every morning I pull out 2 pieces per person, wrap them together in a paper towel and stick it into the microwave for 45 seconds. It comes out perfectly.  For clean up I just put a cup or so of soapy water into the jellyroll/ lipped cookie sheet and stick it back into the still warm oven. Gets it out of the way and when I do get around to it, it pretty much wipes clean.

I've been making bacon like this for the past few years!  I have started placking a cooling rack on the baking sheet (with raised sides) and cook the bacon on that - no need to drain the grease off.  Try sprinkling on brown sugar the last 5 - 7 minutes ... yummy.

One more tip - place a couple layers of paper towel under the foil-lined jelly roll pan;  cut a few slits in foil. Place bacon slices in pan either leaving flat or crimp up depending on texture desired.  Product fries up nicely in oven, and partially drains  off excess grease.  Clean-up is a breeze - from a studio stylist.

The pre-cooked bacon is much easier (and more expensive).  But if watching spending it is a good way to make a large amount.

So easy and SO helpful.  My husband and our roommate are bacon FIENDS, so I actually have to cook a pound of bacon on Saturday and half a pound on Sunday.  Cooking the bacon in the oven allows me the time to work on the rest of the meal so that everything gets done together.  I will sometimes use real maple syrup on the bacon if I am making pancakes or waffles.  Not much syrup though because I would have a mutiny, lol.

I will never cook bacon any other way again.  This was super easy and quick.  When I mentioned cooking bacon this way again, my oldest daughter thought it sounded gross....until I told her this was how I made it last time and she remembered it was the best bacon she'd ever had.

Wow...I will never cook bacon any other way, be it for a crowd or even just the 5 in my house!!  I did turkey bacon, set the oven at 400, lined my sheet with foil and cooked for about 15 mins, flipping half way!!  Fantastic!  A super easy way to cook the bacon and it comes out evenly done :)

WOW, this is so easy and so good. I never had the patience to do it on the stove top to get it all nice and crispy. Now I can get my crispy bacon every time, with so little effort. I love this recipe! Thanks for sharing the secret :)

I used regular bacon and skipped the foil- My bacon did curl. I think it would be better to bake at a higher temperature for a shorter period of time. Tasted just as good as doing it on the stove-top though, and I saved the little bit of grease for future use.

I have been making bacon like this for a short time, however instead of just placing the bacon in a shallow pan I use a rack and no turning is needed. After lining the pan with foil I place a wire rack on the foil lined pan and then spray it with a little Pam to ease in cleanup. After cooking I just put the rack in the dishwasher and it cleans up great. I have also found that to make it to my liking I need to bake the bacon for at least 25-30 minutes minimum as I like crispy bacon.

I use this method all the time.  There is just my husband and I at home now, but I will do about 3 pounds of bacon this way.  After I have blotted between paper towels, I store in a cake size plastic container with a sheet of wax paper between each layer, and freeze!  All I have to do when making breakfast is remove the # of slices I want and return the rest to the freezer.  We have ready made bacon for months this way :)

This is a GREAT  way to make bacon. I do line the pan with aluminum foil - easy clean up. Also, I cut the bacon in 1/2 slices prior to cooking and store in freezer container and take out as needed. Frozen - crumbles easily for recipes calling for crumbled bacon.

What an easy way to cook bacon and without the mess! I used oscar meyer turkey bacon and lined the entire baking sheet with aluminum foil, cooked on 350 degrees for 12 minutes until it was done. The bacon did not curl or burn, just crisp and brown and flat. what I like the most is that I don't have to get splashed or splattered by grease anymore when I fried it in a pan. I used this for, "BLT," "Lorraine's Club Sandwich," also from this website.

Excellent every time.  Just cover the aluminum foil with parchment paper (or just use parchment by itself or a silpat)  to avoid aluminum contamination and all the health problems that come from that.

Baked for 15 min then had to turn over for another 5 minutes to get somewhat crispy bacon.  I found this to be an easier way to make a lot of bacon.

A perfect way to cook a large amount of bacon at one time. For a variety you can sprinkle brown sugar on the bacom before baking. Or drizzle with maple syrup....Either way, you cant go wrong!

this is the method I always use, unfortunately though if you like crispy bacon 350 degrees won't do it, I use 450 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes on my broiler pan so it is less greasy and it makes it nice and crispy!

I've cooked my bacon for a crowd this way for a couple years now - it's THE ONLY way to go!  I have a black gas stove and cooking bacon on the stove just means another chore after doing the dishes - ugh.  I always cook up about 4 pounds and freeze just before we take our summer camp trip; makes breakfast at camp a snap!

This is a very good cooking method.  I probably won't pan fry my bacon anymore.  It doesn't make a huge grease splatter mess and if you use good bacon from your butcher it won't shrivel up into nothing, or curl up into weird shapes.  If you use your broiler pan, the grease will drip into the bottom leaving the bacon extra crispy and not soaked in grease.  Mine took about 25 minutes to bake, using the broiler pan and extra thick bacon.

Wow, that's all I can say!  I have mentioned to my fiance many times that I hate frying bacon and want to learn how to do it in the oven.  He protested saying it wouldn't be the same.  Well he ate his words after I made this!  I baked it at 400 for 10 minutes, then flipped it and baked for another 8-10.  I lined the pan with tin foil and made it come up the sides a little to prevent splatter on my oven walls.  This is great and didn't leave my house smelling like bacon for the rest of the day!

This is my preferred cooking method for bacon, exactly! I got the "recipe" from the back of my Oscar Meyer package though. The bacon always comes out perfect--flat and crisp, but melts in your mouth.

I've been cooking bacon this way for 30+ years--I married a chef, and learned many "tricks-of-the-trade". If you order bacon at a restaurant, this is basically how it was cooked. Home ovens can vary in temperature, especially if you have had yours for a while. Raise the temperature a bit on this recipe if the bacon isn't cooking as fast as you'd like. Turn on the exhaust fan while the bacon cooks. I drain the fat off the bacon half-way through the cooking time. I don't remove the bacon when I do this, I just carefully tip the baking pan at one end and drain the fat into a container. I turn the bacon once during baking, but this is just a personal preference. I also line the pans with foil.  I have a large extended family, so that when we all gather for our traditional Christmas morning abelskiver breakfast, I bake six packages of bacon the afternoon before, refrigerate it until morning, then re-heat it briefly before serving. My family never knew that I did it this way, and they couldn't tell that it had been cooked earlier. You can cook the bacon without the foil liner, but it saves washing a greasy pan.

I have to give Joyce 5 stars just for thinking of submitting this cooking method for Bacon.  I have been cooking  bacon in the oven for a few years now after seeing Emeril do it on his show one time.  This method is adjustable based on your needs of course.  I set the oven to 400 degrees and sometimes even 450 if I want it to get done faster.  Either temp works well.  And I use a sheet pan with edges of course, you don't want grease all over your oven.  Also line it with foil for easier cleanup.  Sometimes I turn it, sometimes I don't.  If you really put a lot of bacon on and the pieces are touching, you might want to turn before it sticks to the piece next to it.  The bacon shrinks less than it does when you fry, but it shrinks enough that the pieces won't be touching after a little while.  Have never tried the racks or the paper towels ideas that some reviewers have suggested.  Will experiment with those as well.  I do like saving the bacon grease for later seasoning or if we are having eggs, I just put it in a pan and use it to fry the eggs.  There is no downside to using this method.  Have used with with thick bacon, thin bacon, peppered bacon(yum), uncured bacon, brown sugar bacon.  Any kind of bacon works.  I will never fry bacon again!

What a great way to cook bacon! No frying! I had to turn my oven up to 400 degrees. When everything was done, you have a nice crispy flat piece of bacon.

JOYCE, YOU ARE THE QUEEN!!!!! This recipe is SOOOOO easy. I can't believe I've been frying bacon in a skillet for as long as I have! No more splatters (my stove is right next to my wine glass rack - every time I "fry," I spend at LEAST a half hour cleaning everything afterwards). I won't be cleaning or wincing from grease splatters (ouch is right!) anymore :) I did find that 350 degrees was not hot enough to cook the bacon to my liking in the 15-20 minute suggested timeframe. I think I will increase my oven temperature to 400 next time (I had the same problem JR did; it took me nearly 30 minutes to cook my bacon thoroughly, but that could be because I also placed too much bacon on my baking sheet). I used aluminum foil for easy cleanup, and drained my bacon on a cooling rack set on top of a cookie sheet. Perfect! Oh, and I also saved the bacon grease (I poured it in a Ball jar) for later! It seems as if I never have the "correct" amount of bacon grease my recipes call for, even after following the directions exactly!!! This was especially perfect for makig BLT salad (Mooney). It called for exactly 1 lb. of bacon! Again, thanks JOYCE for sharing your idea with all of us :)

I put mine on a baking rack on a cookie sheet covered with tinfoil, baked at 350 for about 30 minutes, I kept checking if often so I wouldn't burn it up. Worked out great!

This is the only way I cook bacon now. So much easier and less mess than frying on the stove. I can get this started cooking and still have the burners free for eggs, pancakes, etc and I don't have to keep turning bacon.

I have to give this a low rating as-is. I followed it to the "T", and 350 just doesn't seem to be hot enough.  After 20 minutes I still did not have crispy bacon.  However I love the idea of doing it in the oven, so I will follow another reviewer's tip next time and try it at 400 degrees.

I bake between 375-400.  Medium sliced bacon is done between 15-20 minutes.  We like bacon on the crisp side.  Will never fry in a pan, or microwave, again.  Thank you

I made this recipe using kretchmar regular sliced bacon and decreased the cooking time. The bacon was some of the best I have ever eaten. A bonus was if you save bacon grease for use in other recipes the grease was really clean. Very good way to fix alot of bacon in a hurry.

I have been cooking bacon this way for years (mom taught me)  I line my jelly roll/cookie sheet with foil simply to make clean up a snap. It is not necessary.  I reheat any left overs in the toaster oven.

I made bacon this way for the first time on Christmas day.  Even though I forgot the foil liner, the bacon cooked up crisp and it was much easier and less messy than cooking it in a pan and having bacon grease splattered all over the stovetop.  Because I used thick-cut bacon, it took longer, so next time I'll increase the oven temperature to 375 or 400 degrees.  I'll never cook bacon the old way again!

This is the perfect way to cook Bacon. After cooled, I enclose numerous pieces in parchment paper and then put all in a 2 gallon plastic bag and freeze. When I need bacon, I take out portions and reheat in Micro and it's ready for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  I cook it just slightly underdone..so when i micro it it won't be over cooked as it does cook more when reheating. 
I made F-toast and Pancakes and freeze so Breakfast is a snap for these things..just take out and micro and serve. Hubby comes in for breakfast, (never at the same time whenever he can break free) so I can have him served in a couple of minutes. Heat the syrup too.
Thanks for posting so I could contribute.

Great way to make bacon. It took me longer than 15-20 min to bake but it was a good easy way to make bacon esp when making a big breakfast that requires a lot of stove top cooking.

My husband has been cooking our bacon in the oven for years.  He puts it on a broiler pan so that the extra grease drips below.  The bacon cooks longer than this recipe states, until it is crisp.  It melts in your mouth!  We wait for it to cool completely and then we freeze the bacon (we make 3-4 lbs at a time).  To thaw you can either set it out, or microwave a few slices for about a minute.  It's perfect for those recipes that call for just a few slices.  I also take some of the drippings and freeze them so that I will have them for a recipe that needs the added flavor of bacon grease.

No more frying on the stovetop for me...I really hate frying bacon and this recipe is almost perfect.  Tips:  if you overlap the bacon, it takes longer to cook.  I also had to turn up my oven to 425 like some of the other reviewers, but I was also using my Pampered Chef stoneware, so that could also be why it took longer for me.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

As the recipe is written I can only give this 4 stars - 350 gave me rubbery bacon after about 25 minutes in the oven. I may try upping the temperature as many others have in the future, but I think I still prefer frying the bacon in a skillet. Thanks for sharing.

awesome, made for BLT's last night and my husband wanted to know how I got the bacon so flat! Perfect, did have to cook a bit longer then called for, but my oven tends to either be too hot or too cool. make sure you dont over lap the edges too much.

Love this! I will never make bacon any other way again! I used regular bacon (not thick sliced) and a 400 degree oven. It took a little longer than I thought, and I turned half-way thru. I like mine extra-crispy though!

This worked out great. Did take me more around 30 minutes for it to cook on 400, I believe that was due to leaving the foil covering on for too long. It crisps up great and it's nice to not have to fight with the popping grease! Thank you Joyce!

I buy a 3 lb pack of bacon and bake it all up in several batches.  After draining well, I refridgerate for up to 3 weeks and as needed, reheat in microwave and it is as good as if it were just cooked.

This is the only way I make bacon now.  I found that microwaving bacon made it too crispy and I would burn it if I tried making it on the stove top.
I put the oven temp at 400 and use a jelly roll pan (raised edges) and I spray it with pam prior to placing the bacon slices in the pan.  After the bacon is done I drain the grease through a strainer and save it in the fridge to use it for other recipes like making homemade dog biscuits!  
If you havent tried bacon in the oven you should try it soon!  You can make all the other goodies while the bacon is in the oven!  How easy is that?  Not to mention cheaper than the ready to serve bacon in stores.

Instead of lining the baking sheet, I sprayed a cooling rack and placed that on the baking sheet, and then placed the bacon on top. This seemed to remove as much fat and grease as possible.

thanks for sharing. I work in a lunch bar and this is how we cook our bacon to serve on eggs.
At home, I put the bacon on paper towels and then microwave it. The grease goes into the paper towels and you end up with crisp bacon. Do not walk away from your microwave, it goes fast!

I have been doing this a long time BUT I put the bacon in the cold oven at 400 and by the time my gas oven heats up the bacon is nearly perfectly cooked.  Sometimes it may take a few more minutes.  I won't fry bacon in a pan ever again!

This IS the ideal way to cook a lot of bacon. Along with using a cookie sheet with sides (to contain the grease), I also put the bacon on a cooling rack (smaller size). It fits inside the cookie sheet  and saves turning over the bacon. After cooking, I spread paper toweling out, lay the bacon in a single layer, roll up the pieces of bacon, put in a zip lock plastic bag and store in the refrigerator or freezer. A brief warmup on lower temperature in the microwave really speeds up breakfast (or BLT’s).

I made this to go with our breakfast for dinner. Great way to cook bacon. I wanted ours really crispy so I  upped the temp to 400 and cooked it for ten minutes, flipped, and cooked it for another ten.  I seldom cook bacon but when I do I will use this recipe! Thanks for the recipe.

Been doing this for years. This is how restaurants do their bacon... for easy clean up line your baking sheet with parchment paper. It makes clean up a breeze I let the grease cool on sheet then throw sheet away. No mess left on cookie sheet

I always do bacon this way - except I lay it on a rack so that it drips through.  I never need to turn it.

I have done this for about 5 years ~~ Works great for a crowd! 
 Through trial and error, I have found if you use a cooling rack set in the cookie sheet (with sides) to lay the bacon out  the bacon does not cook in the grease, rather the grease drips down and is collected n the foil that is lining the pan.  I line the pan because it is easier to clean.  I also use a cooking spray on the rack.  Hope these ideas help

I've been doing something similar for the past several years. 
Not just for a crowd, but to always have bacon on hand for sandwiches, salads, snacks, doggy training treats, etc.

Try to catch sales of large family pack of thick cut bacon.
I cook on it a baking/cooling rack that is elevated over a cookie sheet so that the bacon doesn't saturate by sitting in its own grease.

Afterwards I store the  cooled bacon in my fridge in a freezer storage bag with a slice of stale bread (it absorbs any residual grease).   

Just put a few pieces in the microwave for 20 seconds to reheat.

I set my oven to 400F and turn about halfway through. I don't use a wire rack because it just makes for more dirty dishes and if you remove the bacon right away and place on paper towels the grease isn't a big deal.  By far the best way to cook bacon!

I always bake my bacon and trust me, if you're using thick cut bacon, it takes longer than 10-15 minutes at 350. I use thick cut bacon on a half-sheet pan, not lined, at 425 for 15-20 minutes because I like my bacon crispy, not chewy. It could be my oven, but I've done this in 2 different apartments and it works for me at  425 for 15-20 minutes in both places.

I used one of the suggestions and slightly crumpled a layer of aluminum foil to put the bacon on and raised the oven temp. to 375 degrees.   This idea was great getting my daugter and her husband a breakfast before they had to leave early to catch a plane this past week.  Didnt have to worry about splatters as put a loose layer of foil over the top and didnt have to "baby sit" the bacon  while I fixed the scrambled eggs and biscuits and fruit cups.

I have used this method for years.  I set the oven at 400.  I don't use aluminum foil, but instead use a pampered chef  baking pan with about  1 inch high sides. when done, tilt the pan slightly and all the bacon grease runs to one corner.

Good way of doing a quantity of bacon in one shot.  We dont use bacon frequently, so after it drains on paper towels, I put it in a plastic container and pop it in the freezer.  Need a couple slices for breakfast....toss in a pan to heat up before cooking the eggs.  Need some for a burger, throw it on the grill or in the pan while the burger cooks.
This process keeps the bacon from spoiling when it sits in the frige too long.

You can even use this method with turkey bacon. Here is what I did: I use the baking rack and just lined the bottom with voile I didn't even use a cookie sheet this allows the grease to dripped down and then you can just throw away the foil. Using the rack makes it so you don't have to flip the bacon. I also cook it on a much higher heat using the broil setting. You have to watch it very closely avoid getting burnt but it cooks fast and crispy

omg so much better than pan frying. I did thick cut bacon cut in half and 350 degrees. i did have to do it longer than it said but mine still turned out floppy, which we love. I did a total of 22 min in the oven and flipped 5 minutes before i took them out. used with foil underneath and a curled up the edges of the foil to catch the bacon grease. SO happy I tried this. Never gonna pan fry bacon again

This is sooo easy.  We had BLT's tonight and with a husband and teenage son, that's a lot of bacon. I did pour off the grease half way through cooking to prevent any overspills. I used someone's suggestion to brush it with maple syrup, which turned some good thick bacon into the best BLT's we've had.

I always do my bacon in the oven.  Less clean-up.  Usually I will do 1/2 of it as is and the other half I will sprinkle with coarse ground pepper.  I love that on a BLT.

This is a much cleaner and easier way to cook bacon.  I like mine fairly crisp so cooked it at 400 deg. instead of 350.  I also needed to bake it closer to 30 minutes.  (The suggested 350 deg. for 15 minutes won't produce a crisp bacon.)  In any event, I won't be cooking it in  a frying pan in future!

I love this method! I bake up the whole pound of bacon. Then I store it in the refrigerator.
 I warm the bacon back up in the microwave...or place it in cold skillet and let the bacon warm up as the skillet warms for eggs. The bacon gives off just enough grease to cook my eggs for breakfast.

I place a rack over the cookie sheet that allows the bacon to cook without soaking up all the fat.  If you spray your rack with pam it makes the clean up easier.

I have baked my bacon this way for years but put a cooling rack over a sheet cake pan that has been sprayed with Pam, this way the grease all goes to the bottom. Then  baked in a 375-400 degree oven till browned and crisp. I like to bake a lot, then freeze the baked bacon for when I need.

I do 2-3 pound packages of lean bacon every couple of  weeks (1/2 lb per pan) on a broiler pan. I drain the fat after every  pan into a jar and keep it for seasoning greens and such .  I drain the cooked bacon on paper towels and store it in the fridge for a week or two with no problem. I take a few pieces out and microwave the between paper towels for 30 seconds to crisp them up. This makes very crisp bacon, the kind my family really likes. The advantage is that the fat is almost gone and we don't feel as guilty eating this very crisp, very tasty bacon. I usually time my "bacon day" to when I am going to have roasted vegetables or roast chicken for dinner. The bottom pan is drained, but not washed, and used to flavor the evening roasted meal.  My whole house smells great on bacon days!

I've done bacon like this for years. I heat my oven to 425 and line the baking sheet (with sides) with parchment. Remove the bacon when it reaches the doneness you prefer, I like it quite crisp so I cook mine about  20 minutes.  Drain on paper towel lined plate. I let the grease left on the parchment cool til it soldifys and then throw it out. Such an easy way to cook bacon.

I've never heard of baking bacon until now. Just tried this and wow! Easy, no grease splatters, and it cooks perfect. I will never fry bacon on top of the stove ever again. Thank you for this winner of a recipe.

This is how I cook my bacon and it is a big time saver when I cook for a crowd.  For make ahead times, I oven cook the bacon, drain on paper towels and freeze in freezer storage bags.  When I need bacon, I simply take out what I need and microwave until warm and ready to eat.  This works great when my whole family is around for breakfast!

This is the only method that I have ever used for years.  Besides, who fries bacon in a frying pan anymore?  My only tip is that I let the bacon cook for about ten minutes and then place the strips on a baking rack and finish cooking for another five minutes.  This gives added crispness .  Be sure to save the drippings to season other food.

Try placing the bacon on top of foil, with the cooling rack on top of the bacon...keeps it flat.  I foiled the cookie sheet, but next time will try a crumpled layer to sit the bacon on top to raise it from grease and lay cooling rack on top of it...great for e.g.g sandwiches with bacon.

This is the way we did bacon for our Canadian Thanksgiving for breakfast the next morning.  There was 20 of us and the bacon was done in a snap.  When cooking for a crowd, this is the only way to go.  Oh, but we didn't line the cookie sheet.  I didn't know this till now, but it would have been a quicker clean up.  Oh and I didn't turn it either but it was a convection oven..  Mmmmmmmm, bacon!!!

The ONLY way to cook bacon! Even if you are a family of one, like me. I, too, use a rack, but still line the pan with foil for easier cleanup. My favorite:  make a mixture of brown sugar and a little cayenne (or any chili powder, ancho is good) and press into both sides before baking. Delicious, perfect bacon, whether plain or "candied."

I use this all the time. I use parchment paper to line baking sheets. I cook the whole pound then freeze any strips that I don't use in a resealable bag. Then I can have bacon ready with a quick zap. I also bake at 400 degree F.

I've been cooking bacon this way for years (thank you Mom!). Only suggestion I have is to use a broiler pan so grease drips into pan below - I line the pan with foil for easier cleanup and I also use higher temp of 400 degrees.

Works like this on the grill too. Keeps the bacon smell out of the house so there won't be whining and complaining from your family members who are sensitive to smells.

This is the only way to make bacon. Perfect way to cook it the way you like. Not as long for softer bacon or a little longer for extra crispy. Can make everyone the perfect bacon cooker.

I have been doing bacon like this for years...
I use my roasting pan,..top sprayed or oiled,
Pan lined with foil for easy cleanup.
I sprinkle bacon, whatever thickness, with a mixture of
pepper,raw sugar and finely chopped fresh rosemary...
Sprinkled on and patted in.. Place in cold or heated oven at 375*
Check after 15 min. maybe raise heat ?  
Depends when my guests come in for breakfast.
I have a B&B and everyone loves bacon esp. this way.
If I serve something else they request this for the next morning !
P.S.  For the 2 of us I do it in the toaster oven.
M...   SUNSET/SUNRISE B&B

Next time I will go back to cooking in the microwave.I tried baked the bacon for my family.  It didn't save time like I expected.  The grease was messy and started smoking and it didn't save time.  Bacon tasted okay.

I liked this method - much less mess.  The bacon did turn out nice & straight which I really liked. Cooked evenly too.  I agree with the other reviewers - I had my oven on 425 and it still took about 30 minutes.  I also used regular bacon (not thick sliced) and it worked fine.  You can get other things done while your bacon is cooking in the oven.

It was a little limp when following the recipe "as is", but then I started reading the reviews!!  Worked great but I had to add about 10 minutes to the cook time.  I used a lined Airbake cookie sheet with an edge, the Airbake may have made a difference too.  I will bake at 400 next time.  And add a minute at a time if it needs longer.  Awesome way to cook up the whole package and have leftovers for other recipes or salads.

I lined my two aluminum cookie sheets with foil and laid 1/2 lb. of bacon on each pan. Cooked for 10 mins. on each side at 350 and I drained the grease in between and it still wasn't done. I cooked another 10 mins. and it was done. Not crisp but done and good. A simple acceptable way to eat and serve bacon but not my favorite method. I will use this again for simplicity.

It, turns out beautifully. Why did I wait so long, to make the bacon in the oven? I did cook it longer only because I wanted it crisper. Thank you for you recipe. Much appreciated! Sorry no Photo , we ate it to fast!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but . . .  After 20 minutes in the oven, the bacon was just starting to cook and I had to transfer it to a frying pan to complete before I grew too old to enjoy it!  I'm sure it will work, but is quite a slow process.

I have been making my bacon in the oven and much easier.  When I do it I make large batches...cool it down and put it in sealed packages in the freezer.  Then I can take out the amount I want and I am always ready with bacon for BLT's especially in the summer with fresh garden tomoatoes. I makes a quick easy meal when the bacon is already prepared.   If you prefer to fry bacon my mother always said to run cold water over the slices, drain on paper towel before you fry.  It keeps the bacon from curling and shrinking.  I tried it multiple times and it has always worked for me.

I work in a home with three developmentally handicapped adults and use this method to prepare breakfast when we have bacon on the menu.  I fix an entire lb of bacon at a time, slightly undercook it, then put the extra pieces in the freezer.  They can be used later.  When reheated in the microwave for a few seconds, they are not crispy but that's a good thing in this situation, and kitchen shears snip the bacon into the 1- or 1/2-inch pieces required for our folks.  BTW I use allrecipes.com on my smartphone for good, healthy, easy to prepare and adapt for our special people.  It's not unusual for one man to get up really early when I start fixing breakfast because he is so excited about what we might be having.  Breakfast is never boring but always healthy and appropriate for their individualized diets!  Love this site and all the folks that contribute!

I used to be a Pampered Chef recipe a couple of years ago.  This was my favorite tip for seasoning a new stonware pan (but only the ones with raised sides.)  The bacon is delicious and perfect and the pan is uniformly seasoned and ready for non-stick baking of all kinds of tastey treats after it's cooled and cleaned.

This is a great recipe/ idea.  The bacon cooks perfectly.  The entire house does not stink of bacon grease for the rest of the day!  Finally, clean up is a breeze as you just remove alum foil and wash the baking sheet (instead of having to scrub relentless grease splatters!).  Thank you for this!

I turn the over to 425 and cook for about 15 mins.  Sometimes I take it out after 12 mins and brush maple syrup on the bacon then put it back in for 3-4 more mins. Turns out great!

This took longer, but is very efficient.  I used the thick-cut bacon and it tasted a lot like cracklins.  I will try it with regular bacon soon.

Took longer than the 10-15 minutes - I guess it depends on the thickness of the bacon.

I have cooked bacon like this for years.  To reduce the lingering bacon smell place a small bowl of vinegar beside the oven vent (not inside the oven).  Or I have also cooked it on the BBQ, same temps but a little less time as the bacon is closer to the flame.  No smell in the house this way but you drive your neighbors crazy!!!

My husband has been doing this for years, except he uses the broiler pan so the grease drains off the bacon into the lower pan while it's cooking.  Delicious, crisp bacon every time!

I've been oven baking my bacon forever and know that if you use the directions in this recipe it will never get done!  425 degree oven for 20-25 minutes will give you fully cooked bacon that isn't burned.  Adjust time if you are baking thick sliced bacon.  It also helps if you have a self cleaning oven. :)

Used this for years - my oven works best at 425 for 20-25 minutes.  I crumple the foil before laying it out on the sheet. Lifts the bacon out of the grease like using a rack.   Use a generous enough piece of foil to form a pouring spout on one corner before putting it in the oven.  The grease does spatter, so the tip to use foil on top is way better than frequent use of the auto clean button!

I don't cook bacon any other way anymore (unless I only want a few pieces which I then throw in the microwave).  I have cooked both thin and thick bacon at the 350 temp and the 400-450 temp.  Both work fine as long you watch your bacon - LOL.  It's always personal preference how long you leave it in the oven.  I always heavily pepper my husband's half and spread brown sugar on my half before I put it in the oven.  Mine turns out like candy.  I would rather eat this than any candy made.  I also put a cooling rack with a sheet of tin foil underneath in the pan.  It keeps clean-up to a minimum and my bacon out of the grease.

4 stars for the method! Definitely love making bacon in the oven now. I did the wire rack over the cookie sheet method and I think it made the cooking time longer because I had to cook an additional 10 mins. Also, I cooked it at 400 but then the last 10 mins I cooked it at 425. Next time I'll just cook at 425 the whole time.

I've been cooking bacon this way for many years.  My grandmother cooked it this way but she dregged the bacon in flour first and then cooked it in the oven.  It gives it an ever more chrispy and crunchy taste.

Another tasty bacon treat is to dip the bacon in chocolate!  YUM,  YUM!

I've used this method of cooking bacon for years.  I always use a rack though so that the bacon is not sitting in grease.  It cooks very evenly that way. With a rack, you can cook thin or thick  cut bacon. Just keep an eye on it.   The cooking time will vary.  My cooking temp has always been 350-375.

Turned out beautiful. I used a rack and covered the top of bacon for 15 min then uncovered until desired crispiness. Have to tell you that mine took almost 30 min at 350. Didn't want to increase temperature because we don't like really crispy bacon.

This is officially the only way I will ever cook bacon. The bacon is so perfectly crispy everytime. It is worth the extra time to prepare it this way. Plus there is less of a greasy mess.

This turns out great every time!  I have tried both thick and thin slices and prefer the thin. If you do use the thin slices I would suggest lining your cookie sheet with wax paper and reducing the baking time-keep an eye on it! Also, as previously mentioned----a cookie sheet with raised edges is a must in either case thick/thin!

The first time I made bacon this way, everyone commented on how good it was! (they were all still sleeping when I made it, so they had no idea it was a different method). The big problem I had, however, was that cooking at 350 degrees in my oven took about 40 minutes which was discouraging. I have since upped the temp to 450 degrees and it still takes close to 15 minutes. In the end, this is the best way to make bacon. No more pan frying or microwaving which is akin to watching water boil! Time saving, delicious, five stars!

This is how I've been making my bacon for years.  A couple of tips, though: if you line your pan with enough foil, then cleanup is a breeze!  Also, it makes it convenient to reserve the bacon drippings for later use in other recipes.  Lastly, I like to turn the slices once so that they cook evenly.  I find that 7-10 minutes per side (depending on thickness) works best in a 400-425 oven.

There are so many benefits from this method!  Bacon doesn't curl, no more grease spatters and best of all the house isn't taken over by the bacon smell!  I found it took a good 20 minutes to get it a little crispy but it is so worth the extra time.

Couldn't be easier.  I use a broiler pan to catch the fat and eliminate spills or draining, also no spatter this way.  Picked up a spanking new extra broiler pan at the thrift store for $2 bucks to double up, baking both pans  at once. I usually do regular cut bacon and need more time to get it to crisp the way I like it.

I love the bacon cooked in the oven, but I love thick sliced bacon, so I found that I need to increase the oven temperature and extend the amount of time that I cook my bacon to get it cripsy the way that I like it. My husband likes his bacon to fall over when held out and I like mine to stand up, so this works well for bacon cooked for him. Thanks

AWESOME!  I'm 61 years old and have from the South.  I've fried a lot of bacon! This is the best idea EVER! I don't line my baking sheet but do cover it with tin foil and am very careful not to spill the grease when taking it out.  You young people keep the ideas coming.  We old dogs can learn a lot.

It was perfect - it lies in a bunch of grease unlike cooking it on a paper towel in the microwave but you take it right off and onto a paper towel.  Cooked beautifully!

This took WAY longer to cook than stated, and I used regular sliced, not thick.  I turned it, and eventually separated the pieces (from the recommended layers) and eventually turned on the broiler to crisp it up.  I like that it doesn't curl up, and it is very easy to do this way.  I will do it again, especially for a crowd, but I will take the time into better account.  Luckily, turning on the broiler at any point speeds up the process.  Overall, great way to do bacon.

This was the easiest and best way I have ever made bacon. I typcially use the pre-cooked stuff because of how much I dislike frying it up. But, this makes perfect bacon without the mess! I used a cooling rack on top of a foil lined cookie sheet to ensure crispiness.

I cranked the oven up to 425 and it baked in half the time.  My family likes crispy bacon and this did the job with minimal work!

I hate frying bacon.  I tried this method although I started out with the oven set at 375- the bacon cooked for about 15 minutes when I realized it was going to take too long!  I upped the oven to 420 for about 10 minutes and the bacon still looked  undercooked.  So, I turned my broiler on high for about 3-5 minutes and the bacon ended up coming out Perfect!  Tasted wonderful with very little effort on my part!  Yay!    I will cook my bacon this way from now on.  Thanks!

I have been cooking my bacon like this from 1971. When I cooked in a military px. also saves bacon fat for for seasoning later, it freezes great.

This is awesome! I've done this several times now and I love it! I think I'll cook bacon like this from now on. I just stick it in my counter-top toaster oven at 400 degrees and let it cook away. Certainly beats getting splattered with the grease when frying it on the stove-top.

I was so excited to try this recipe.  I followed the instructions exactly...only to open the oven after 20 minutes and the bacon still needing to be cooked atleast another 15-20.  I had very disappointing results.  I ended up having to fry it anyway.  I looked at the reviews and I'm going to next time turn the oven to 400 and hopefully the results will turn out better. Update:  I increased the temperature to 400 and used regular bacon and it came out PERFECT!!  I'm going to make it again and again this way!  Thank you!

I am entirely too impatient to make bacon in a pan or on a griddle. Using this method, I'll make bacon! I used center cut bacon (not thick) and flipped half of them halfway through cooking. I did not use foil and I did not drain them halfway through. I cooked them for a total of 14 minutes. All of the pieces were great but the ones I flipped were crispier - just the way I like bacon. We just planted tomatoes, and I can't wait to make BLTs for a crowd. Update: I love EMSEV333's suggestion for using a cooling rack over a pan.

This was an easy way to make bacon especially for a crowd but my bacon didn't come out crispy.  Maybe I didn't cook it long enough (30 minutes)so I will try it again but I was a little disappointed.

This is an excellent way to cook bacon!  I will do it this way from now on.  The bacon was nice and flat, cripsy and very tasty!    I used thin sliced bacon because that is what I had on hand and cooked it at 385 degrees for about 25 minutes to get it crispy.   Super good.

YAY to this cooking method!!! I used thin bacon, and watched it closely toward the end. Half way though, I flipped the bacon and soaked up most of the grease with paper towels (easier than trying to drain a huge cookie sheet with hot bacon sliding around!). My advice, as others have stated: Lay a piece of foil loosely over the bacon then remove close to the end. Also, DON'T have the bacon slices touch or else you won't be able to get them apart. Woohoo! No more icky bacon grease splatters everywhere!

Brilliant!  This is the only way I will cook bacon from now on!  I turned the oven to 400* and checked the bacon every 5 min. or so until it was just right for us (around 15 min.).  I placed the bacon on a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet with raised egdes.  The bacon was flat, evenly cooked, and had no chewy fat pieces because the fat just melted off onto the pan.  Since it was raised by the rack, the heat could circulate all around and there was no need to turn the bacon either.  My husband and I agreed that the bacon even tasted better this way!

I used this method on a 10-pound box of slab bacon I bought. I cooked it all at once (it took 3 hours!) but froze the cooked bacon for later. Some I purposely undercooked so that it would finish in whatever dish I plan to use it in. In addition to that, I ended up with several packages of strips, a package of chunks for recipes, and a package of bits to use with salads. I will probably do this every six months or so. Now I always have bacon ready to use! Thanks for the recipe!

Great idea!!! Will have bacon more often!  Placed it on a foil lined broiler pan, so clean up was REALLY a breeze. I did sprinkle mine with some brown sugar prior and turned it after awhile in the oven.  I can't remember how long it cooked as I just eye-balled it but it did take much longer than 10-15 minutes and it wasn't thick bacon, but good ole Oscar Mayer bacon!

My bacon didn't crisp up following the recipe; I increased the heat to 400 for an additional 10 minutes (after 15). It was way too greasy sitting in its own fat the whole time; I even drained it twice. Might be better on a rack so the fat can drip off.

I made this for a Broccoli cheese Soup from this site and wanted to add bacon so Id figure Id kill two birds with one stone and try this one out. While I thought it was a good idea I think the temperature needs to be higher. My Bacon didnt get too crispy. It was in there for 10 mins drained the fat than another 15 mins. Will use again but adjust the time or temperature.

I should have read more reviews before I started!  As is, this recipe will leave you with raw bacon.  Mine was in for 45 minutes and was still not crispy enough.  I took it out, put on paper towels for a few minutes and microwaves for 90 seconds.  That got it to a good crisp.  Will definitely do this again, but now I know to raise the temp or leave for more time in the oven.

I hate frying bacon in a pan and usually just microwave it, but end up using a ton of paper towels.  This was an easy, no-frills way to cook bacon.  It came out AWESOME.  I can't believe everybody doesn't do it this way. 

PS.  I used thin-sliced bacon and the oven on 400 degrees.

This is the only way to cook bacon.  I have been doing this for years.  I bake at 375 degrees for about 15 to 18 minutes.  The bacon turns out perfect everytime.

I love bacon, but hate frying it. This makes it so easy!! And it turns out crispy just like I like it. I cooked regular bacon at 400 degrees for about 25-30 minutes. Some pieces were done before others, just removed them as they were done. Cooking in the oven gave me time to work on other items I was cooking. Great idea!!

This is the best way to do bacon. My mom showed me this and I will never go back. The bacon stays flat and cooks evenly, and best of all there is no splatter!

My bacon turned out just right, not too crisp but done.  I am amazed that it took me this long to try this method.  I turned one piece over after 10 minutes and found no difference in what I did not turn.  I did use the foil and will again as it made the cleanup a cinch.  It did take at least 20 minutes using thick sliced bacon.

Worked well, i accidentally left them in a little too long but they are still yummy, but that was my fault! I hate having to clean up bacon grease off the skillet. with this all i did was crumble up the tin foil and i was done. To the person who said it wont get crisp this way, you obviously didn't try it b/c it does. Thanks for the great tip!

I've been baking bacon like this for quite a while and will never go back to the old way of doing it....standing in front of the pan while it spatters me with hot grease. And the aluminum foil is a must. Not only does it not cook right without it, it also is insanely easy to clean up this way.

This is a great technique, although it's better at 400 degrees. We don't turn the bacon, just bake it on a cookie sheet about 17 minutes, using thick-sliced bacon.
TIP: Partially freeze bacon package to make it easier to carefully cut it in half with a sharp knife if smaller pieces work better for you. (We use Arkansas' own Petit Jean bacon-the best!)

This works very well, especially for bigger crowds!  I use a Pampered Chef bar pan. You can also pour pancake mix onto a bar pan and bake then cookie cut or pizza cut the pancakes when done! Another crowd pleaser!

I use a stone bar pan and preheat the stone to 400 degrees.  Then cook the bacon for 13 minutes on one side and flip for an additional 4 minutes or so. I also use thick bacon.  My family absolutely loves bacon prepared this way.

I love this way of making bacon! Ina Garten did it this way on one of her shows and I do it often unless I don't feel like using the oven. Thanks for the tip of using thick bacon, I will try it next time I do this!

I started baking bacon years ago and still do for a big crowd.  another tip you might try is to place one or two cake cooling racks on the cookie sheet on which to place the bacon.  It keeps the strips free of most of the grease!

If you do not mind the time requirement, the energy consumption (argueably greater with the oven), and the comparative inconvenience of oven-cooking versus microwaving, this oven-method of preparing bacon in relatively large quantities is fine. However, I prefer our years-old but still available Nordic Ware Slanted Microwave Bacon Tray - "in stock" at Amazon.com . With properly layered paper towels, I can easily handle up to 0.5 lb of halved bacon strips. Each layer consists of 4-6 such individual, non-overlapping strips. For my wife and myself, I place 4-6 strips on a paper towel and then cover the strips with another paper towel. With a little experience, you can easily determine the length of microwaving-time required per strip for a desired degree of bacon crispness or non-crispness. The time-range for our 4-6 strips with our microwave is usually 4-6 minutes depending on the doneness desired - from undercooked to crisp (usually the latter).

I have been making my bacon like this for years but I love to rub on some brown sugar.  Yum!!  Just keep an eye on it as with the brown sugar it can burn quicker and take it off the foil right when it comes out of the oven, drain on paper towels and remove right away to a plate b/c it will stick and break if you wait to long to take it off.

My family loves bacon on everything but I hated to cook it til now. I'm gonna make it like this all the time. I took the advice to use the wire rack to elevate the bacon (cookie cooling rack) and put down foil underneath. Clean up was a snap and I saved myself from hot grease splatters!

Definately much easier than standing over the stove.  Hubby likes his a little undercooked and I like mine a little more done.  A great way to make this without having to watch and see where the kid is.  Thanks for the post.

I really wanted to try this because I hate frying bacon and it turned out perfect. I did like another reviewer and lined my baking sheet with foil then putthe bacon on the rack that fits in the pan. Didnt have to flip it or drain the grease.

This was OK, but I really like CRISPY bacon so I had to cook for quite awhile in order to get it as crisp as I like.  I took it out a couple of times & flipped it around and such while cooking too.  It was nice b/c I didn't have grease splattered all over my stovetop & I didn't waste a lot of paper towels as I do when cooking it in the microwave!  My husband loved it b/c he thinks I get it too crisp when I cook it in the microwave as I usually do.  I will probably make again though.

I hate frying bacon cause I always end up getting splattered on. Normally I make my husband fry the bacon up, but now I'm happy that I've found a better method!) And I like that I can cook up a bunch to keep in the fridge for sandwiches.

Glad to see someone put this idea on the website. I've been making bacon this way for over 20 years, and recommend to everyone I know. I use a foil lined cookie sheet, but set the oven at 425. Since some like it crispier than others, I just remove it when it's at the desired doneness for each individual preference.

Super easy and clean-up was a snap with a foil lined pan.  I used thick sliced bacon.  It came out evenly crisp.  Increased the temp to 400 and checked it every 5 minutes.

Followed kaysa42's suggestion of cooking on a rack.  I also put foil on my jelly roll pan.  This took longer than the time stated in the recipe.  I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, turned the bacon over because it still wasn't all cooked and crispy and baked for about 7 more minutes.  I thought at first my oven was off temp, but the thermometer in my oven said it was at 400.  My cooking time just took longer - Go figure.

This is a good way to cook bacon. The time listed is a bit off. I used just basic thin sliced bacon at 400 and it took almost 20mins to get brown and crispy.  I didnt line my pan and baked it on a rack. The pieces came out nice and flat. I'd give it a 5 except the time was off.

easy way of cooking. And a ton of flavour. Gotta love bacon. Thanks. Only thing was it took more than the recommended time for cooking. And I did flip them 1/2 way through.

5 Stars for concept 3 Stars for instruction.  My bacon (thin one even) took 25 minutes.  We were done eating breakfast and the bacon was still in the oven.  Even bumped up the temp.  My bacon wasn't flat either, no big deal.  I'll be making my bacon this way from now on with a bit of experimenting on time and temp.  Another great thing about baking bacon in the oven you don't get the bacon smell in your house for days.

Finally, I was able to try this today when I had to make a bunch of BLTs. I started the bacon off at 350 for about 10 mins, then upped the temp to 400 for another 7 or 8 to make it crispy. I used very thick cut, quite fatty bacon, and had to drain it 3 times. Turned it a couple of times too. Extremely convenient. Thanks!

This is the only way I'll cook bacon from now on.  I lined a baking sheet with foil and placed a rack on top.  That way the grease drops down below.  I also increased the temperature to 425 for 12 minutes.  The bacon was crispy and delicious and clean-up was a breeze!

I prefer my bacon a delicate balance of crispy and chewy, so I left it in the oven for exactly 10min. I accidentally overlapped some of the bacon so it was undercooked, I left it on the pan after I took it out so it would continue to cook. Also added pepper to the bacon before cooking cause we love peppered bacon!

I lined the bottom half  of my  broiler pan with foil. Then I laid a large cookie cooling rack on top. Then I laid the bacon on top. (I had to overlap it a bit.) I cooked at 400 degrees for about the same amount of time as the recipe.  *ovens can vary so it’s best to check bacon for doneness. It turned out perfectly cooked!

Followed the directions exactly and bacon came out flimsy and still uncooked. Had to end up finishing them on the frying pan.

I've made mine like this for years, but use a well-greased  cooling rack above the foil covered pan instead of letting the bacon cook in grease. Also this way you don't have to flip them over.

Get a metal cooling rack for baked goods, and place bacon on the rack to cook so you don't have to turn the bacon to get both sides cooked.  It also separates the bacon from the grease while cooking.

This is how we always make bacon.  Regular or thick sliced.  However, I use wire cooling racks and place them on the cookie sheet and then put the bacon on those.  That way the grease drips off and the bacon isnt sitting in it.  When the grease has cooked slightly, I pour it into a container to completely cool and dispose of it. I also cook at 400 degrees and I keep an eye on it.  Sight and smell are the best timers.

I increased the temperature to 425 degrees and baked it for 28 minutes, but I was doing 2 trays and switched them at 11 minutes. The bacon was perfect and it disappeared with 13 family members! I used thick sliced applewood bacon and cooked just over 2 lbs.

Came out great using suggestions others made. Started in cold oven ai 400 degrees for about 12 minutes. Sprinkled a little brown sugar on it. Never tried that before and it was good. ALSO, I happen to love the "fried bacon smell" in my house!

Much easier than frying in a skillet; however, my grandsons wondered why it was "dry". They are used to their bacon being fried in its own grease. I prefer my bacon baked, like this.

I tried this last night as written......  Next time, I will make a few changes based on reviews.  First, this is SOOO much easier to cook bacon this way, vs. in a frying pan!  My challenge was that, after 15 minutes at 350, and laid out right on the baking sheet, the bacon could only be considered done if you like it really tender.  I added an extra 5 minutes for my son, and 10 for my husband, who likes it crispy.....  What I will do next time is try a hotter oven (400?), and use the tip to bake it on a cooling rack set over the baking sheet, so the grease drips free of the bacon.  (My son loves the idea of using the left-over grease to make suet cakes for the birds! We will try that, too!)

This method was really great because I wanted to make heart shaped bacon for a Valentine's Day theme. I cooked the bacon right along with some cinnamon rolls that I was making. I had to cook the bacon about 25 minutes for mine to get as done as I wanted. In the future I will put the oven at 400 degrees. I made some regular slices along with my hearts, and even though it was "thin" bacon, it turned out just fine.

I almost always bake my bacon, we are a family of 6. It is the easiest way to make bacon. I did try to make as this recipe as written but I think I will go back to my usual method. Cooking at 350 the cook time listed was not long enough and I kept checking every 5 minutes until it was done enough. I typically bake mine at 400 for 15-20.

Time & temperature are off on this recipe, baking at 350F took me 5 times longer to cook until crisp (about 1 hour). I would recommend a higher temperature, maybe about 425, or just make sure to set aside a lot more time than what this recipe describes.

I line my pan with foil, then  set strips of bacon on the foil.  I then place the pan in the oven, cold, before I turn it on.  I set the temp to 415 degrees, and set the timer for 14 minutes.   The temperature reaches somewhere between 405 degrees to 415 degrees in that time, and if not crisp enough in 14 minutes, watch as you do not want to burn the bacon.   Sometimes it is ready in 14 minutes, and sometimes it takes a minute or 2 longer.
I seldom cook bacon in a skillet after learning about baking it.    Superb way to cook bacon!

I cook bacon like this almost every time. It’s so much easier than babysitting it on top of the stove. I usually cook it’s at 375 though because I’m usually doing other dishes while it’s baking. I always line the cookie sheet with foil for easy cleanup and if you’re not rushed for time you can fold the foil accordion style and lay the bacon on top and the grease will collect in the pockets helping the bacon brown more evenly and crispier.

This is the only way I make bacon. So much easier. I use a broiler pan so the grease can drip down and catch in the pan underneath. I find it help the bacon get a little more crispy also.

just tried it in the oven for the first time.   Did mine at 400 degrees and it honestly took closer to 30 minutes for mine.  (and I use my oven frequently for cake baking so not sure what the heck happened on the timing except maybe the rack was too high in the oven)   Will try again to adjust my recipe properly

2 stars for user error.  I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I have been doing this method for weeks now and it is never ready at 15 minutes. As of right now it’s been in for 30 minutes at 400. Perhaps my oven is faulty. Any advice? I sugardale thick sliced, with foil at bottom and a cookie rack. Did not preheat. Clearly user error.

I have been making bacon this way for a long time and learned the process from a sous chef friend. He taught me to use parchment paper on a raised edge pan. Also, cooking times will vary gas vs electric ovens, but 15 minutes seems to be the average. A little longer if you like extra crispy. Just keep an eye on it after the 15.

This is a good technique, more efficient and less messy than frying on stovetop. But it takes MUCH LONGER than described, even for thin-sliced bacon.  It seems to speed up cooking to drain the grease.  I turned each slice about every 5 minutes (after the initial 15 minutes).  Even after it looked done and had been drained (after about 35 minutes with two pans in oven), it was not crispy so I put it back in, trying to get each piece to stand on its side. Took way more hands-on time than I'd anticipated, but still less work than stovetop method.  Next time I'll try higher temperature.

It's very tasty and cripsy this way. It's less messy too. You just need to put your bacon strips on a foil sheet, on your cookie plate and let it bake at 400 degrees for 15-2 minutes.

I have done this for years, I use parchment paper
Instead of foil and grate fresh pepper on bacon before cooking and always turns out awesome

This is a great way to cook bacon for a crowd.  I do have a helpful hint.  I used parchment paper on a large cookie sheet with sides.  I then placed the bacon on top and covered with another sheet of paper.  I THEN placed another same sized cookie sheet on top of it all.  Baked for about 10 min. then turned the bacon over, replaced the paper and pan and finished cooking.  This keeps the bacon from curling up.  The result was nice flat crispy bacon that my guests really enjoyed.

I've made bacon this way at my B&B for years.
Put the bacon on the baking sheet (foil or not---it's all the same clean up)
Cook it until half done.
Turn over.
Then sprinkle "brownulated sugar" over it all generously.
Cook until done to your liking.
Drain on BROWN PAPER---not paper towels--or you'll get fuzzy bacon.

I have been doing this for a long time. It's so much easier than pan frying. I do line my baking sheet though. Makes it easier to clean up.. Just let the grease cool, fold it all up and toss. OR, drain it into a clean jar and stick in the fridge. Bacon grease, goooood!

I've been bakin' my bacon for several years.  You need a MUCH hotter oven!  I typically set it @ 425 and cook for 17-20 minutes.  I recommend cooking spray on top of the foil and yes,  definitely a raised-edge cookie sheet.

This absolutely works; however, I place the bacon in a cold oven and then turn the oven to 400 degrees....no preheating needed.

Ever since I discovered oven bacon, I've never gone back to frying on the stove. This method produces perfectly cooked slices that don't curl. I tried a half pan with the bacon touching/overlapping like this recipe calls for, and the other half pan like I normally make it without the slices touching.  I have to say I'll just stick to my previous method, since the strips tend to stick together and they can be difficult to separate using this recipe's method.

Love this method. No turning bacon in front of splattering pan. I turn my pan halfway through to ensure it's evenly cooked since my oven has hot spots like many do.  I cook mine longer than 15 minutes to get it crispy but not burnt. At 15 minutes it's still not cooked enough. I now recommend this to others.

I have made lots and lots of oven bacon in my time. I use a quarter sheet pan and a wire rack. Raise the temp to 375 degrees . Bake 15 to 20 minutes. A little more crispy? Cook longer.
Also, for a jacked up bacon, you can brush on some maple syrup and sprinkle with a little brown sugar, and for an optional kick sprinkle with cayenne or ancho chili powder.

I used 350 for 15 minutes and it was not crisp enough for me. Turned oven up to 375 and it definitely made a difference. In my oven will prob use 375 to start with. Will definitely use this method again

I didn't use thick style  bacon used black label bacon with the recipes  that was written.  In the time allotted hit was  still not crispy.  I think I let it cook another 10 min and it was done.    Myself I don't eat bacon except if is crisp and cut up in something.  This went in a pasta salad add cheese, onions, eggs, and buttermilk ranch  dressing.....it walked off the table

I use a cookie sheet with raised edges lined with heavy duty foil (it's wider) and cake racks. This eliminates splatter and having to turn the bacon and traps the grease, this way I can wait until the pan has cooled.

This is the ONLY  way to cook bacon perfectly.  It did not turn out as well when the pan was not lined with aluminium foil (that is a must) and I cook it at 375 instead of 350 and I turn it after about 7 minutes.  It is perfect and even my 10 year old granddaughter loves making it for her family on a Saturday morning.

Learned this method many years ago when I took food and beverage management and have always used this method for cooking a large amount of bacon for the family.   I use a broiler pan (the 2 piece one with the grated top) and line the bottom to make clean-up easier.  Being a southerner, I save and refrigerate the bacon grease for seasoning other foods.

This is awesome.. it came out so tasty.. I noticed a couple things though.. one, doesn't work well on the cheap stuff.. also, I followed the instructions, but I like melt in your mouth crispy bacon so I turned the bacon and cooked it for a bit longer.. worked great.

Excellent! I've cooked bacon from another recipe this way, and it sure beats standing at the stove. They come out better, too, flat and crisp. I did use a 400 deg F oven, it it was ready at about 20 min. I did half the lb of bacon for this recipe and the other half using the Candied Bacon recipe, which is also very good.

This is a good start to cooking bacon for a crowd-
I use cookie cooling racks on thick rimmed baking sheets:
all the fat drains through, the bacon is flat and it gets crispy on both sides
And you can save the bacon fat in the freezer for future use
(makes delicious home fries,green beans,etc-everything is better with bacon right?)

This is the only way to make bacon.  I put it on foil and lay foil over top.  It takes 25-30 minutes at 400 degrees. I turn it at the halfway mark and dump some grease.

This is so easy!  Makes cooking bacon a breeze!  I frequently make 8 slices of bacon for my husband and myself for breakfast (high protein!), and this method cuts down on clean up as well as no bacon splatters on my range!  Thanks!

I put cookie cooling racks on a foil covered baking  sheet.  The bacon grease drips off, and the bacon is perfectly crisp -- as greaseless as you can get. (I got the cooling racks at the dollar store, and just use these for cooking bacon.)

I've been cooking bacon this way for a few years. 400? works best. And I do crumple the foil. I have also used a broiler pan. Both work fine....just depends on how much I'm actually cooking that determines which pan I use. I've also used many different types of bacon, thin, thick, in between. The only difference there is length of cooking time.

Was there any other way to cook bacon? If you're making more than a few slices, this is the only way to go.

Thin sliced bacon, pan lined with foil, 375 for 25 minutes.  Perfect!  I like the thin sliced bacon best because it is so crisp.  Use what you like, it will turn out fine.

Super easy. Warning - line pan with foil for easy clean up. I read reviews that said it wasn't necessary. While that may be true for cooking, it's definitely necessary for a quicker, easier clean up. 
I set oven on 400 degrees for crisper bacon. After turning the bacon half way, I placed a piece of parchment paper gently over the top to prevent grease splatter in the oven. Cooking this way was very helpful!!!

I like my bacon pretty crispy so I ended up baking mine for about 30 minutes.  There is a lot of grease that ends up on the cookie sheet, but just let it cool and then carefully dispose of it or strain it and save it in a glass jar for those time you want/need bacon grease.

I had thick-sliced bacon so I cooked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. I flipped it over halfway. Loved the idea of using foil, super easy clean up! Perfectly crisp bacon!!!!

I tried this and it works great! I used parchment paper and easily poured grease off and flipped 10 minutes into it and cooked another 10 minutes. Probably didn't need to. I just didn't want splatter because using gas oven. My husband loves crisp bacon and I will make it more often now because it's easy and no mess. Super easy. My husband loved it.

This the only way I cook bacon.  When I want  to have bacon,I cook a whole package and put what' s left in the frig in a zip lock bag and take out what I need.  I put it in themicrowave to heat up.

This is the only way I cook bacon now!  Use parchment paper a little larger than your pan instead of aluminum foil though.  Crease it along the edges to create a barrier for the grease. When the bacon grease cools, simply slide the paper into the trash and put your pan away.  I don't even have to wash the pan, no grease gets under the paper.  Love this method!  I can't understand the low reviews, what's to mess up here?

I've been doing bacon this way for years, so much easier and no splatter, bacon doesn't shrink much either.  I do use the aluminum foil liner tho, easier clean up.

I put 4 slices on 2 layers of paper towels.  Cover them with one layer of paper towels.  Microwave for 5 minutes.  Allow one minute to sit in the microwave.  It's PERFECT bacon!  Give it a try!!

I made this but patted a little water on each slice prior to baking - keeps it from curling.  I also used regular sliced bacon and cut back on the baking time.  Will make it this way from now on.

I have always made my bacon in the oven using a jelly roll pan. (My 91 yr old mother still thinks I'm crazy!)  But, instead of foil, I use parchment paper.  It makes it much easier to remove the bacon because it doesn't stick.  Most bacon packages have directions on how to bake it in the oven in the fine print on the back.

I do not preheat the oven. I put the thick bacon on a sheet pan, then into the oven, then turn it on to 400 deg. Crisp usually in 15 to 17 minutes. Bacon always seems better from a cold start.

I do this with my oven's broiler pan. I line the bottom with heavy duty foil and spray the top with cooking oil.
When it's done. the grease is on the bottom tray, and you just lift the foil out and dispose. This is the least messy and the quickest way to clean up. Plus the bacon is much less greasy, and it's crisper.

I put the bacon in a 400 degree oven on a cookie sheet with raised edges, also used a rack so the bacon wasn't cooking in it's own grease. Resulted in a crisper bacon.

We have cooked bacon this way for ages and it is just as tasty as frying, without all the curling, splattering and time issues. It works just as well for regular sliced bacon. We like our bacon crisp but not burnt. Regular bacon takes 20-22 minutes.

Just OK. I did finish off in the Microwave for a min. or so. There's just something about  pan-frying that gives you that crisp and flavor. Since I don't have bacon often I think I'll stick to the pan-fry method.

We buy the dry rub black forest bacon from Whole Foods, and once you eat that, you'll never have regular bacon again! It is a bit spend he, so I wanted to make sure it turned out perfect, and this method certainly did the trick. I lined the cookie sheet with aluminum foil, and I did  turn it over after 11 minutes, and went an additional four minutes after that, but this is a thick cut bacon. I'm going to use it for Cobb salads tomorrow when we have company over, I can't wait to see their faces when they taste it!

I baked it for 15 minutes and the bacon came out nice and crispy. I learned from other reviewers the bacon can be frozen and then microwaved for 30 seconds. It tastes the same as when it's fresh from the oven. You don't really need to line the pan. It didn't leave any burn marks.

This is the way I always make bake bacon.  However I frequenly put it in a cold oven, use a pyrex dish ( its ok if the bacon over laps a bit. as it cooks it will shrink.) and set  the oven at 300 degrees. then even cheap bacon doesnt burn.  Maybe it takes a bit longer that way...I usually do it the night before I need it.

I've always used this method for cooking bacon.  One poster said to use thick sliced bacon in lieu of thin, as it will burn.  Not so.  I use thin sliced all the time.  I love this method as it does not leave that lingering smell and smoke up the house.

I cover the rack of my broiler tray with aluminum foil, tucking it firmly around the edges then I  run a knife in the slits to make holes. Put the rack on the broiler tray and put in the oven.  The bacon drains into the lower tray and the bacon is crispy.

My family and I love bacon, but I never used to make it because of the spatter. I have been baking bacon for a while now, and I won't go back to pan frying (unless it's outdoors on a camp stove)!

A note - cleanup is much easier if you line the baking pan. Crumple the foil first and then sort of smooth it out. The ridges will keep the bacon from swimming in grease. And it takes a lot longer than 15 minutes for the slab bacon to get nice and crispy. Allow at least 30 and sometimes longer.

The bacon is nice and flat and doesn't shrink as much, but it doesn't get as crispy...what helps me is I lay a sheet of paper towel over the bacon as it cooks. And no, it does not burst into flames. Really cuts down on the greasy mess in the oven.

This is the only way I cook bacon. However, the only difference is I cook it on my broiler pan. I line the bottom with aluminum foil and place the bacon on the top of the slatted portion. That way all the grease leaks through to the bottom. No need to grease the pan. Takes about 20 min. at 400 degrees. No need to turn bacon. It browns perfectly and is crispy on both sides. Remove bacon from the pan as soon as it comes out of the oven so it will not stick. If you stick the pan In a sink with hot water and dish detergent it will clean up very easily with a little SOS.

I first saw this on a cooking show on TV and have been cooking bacon like this ever since.  I heat the oven to 425 degrees and sprinkle the bacon with black pepper.  Delicious!

I have been making bacon like this for a few years now after watching an episode of Alton Brown.  The other thing that  he does, and works really nice is putting the bacon on a cooling rack and put the rack on the aluminum lined baking tray (rimmed).  The fat drains down so your bacon is not sitting in fat and there is less splashing in the oven.

I have been making my bacon this way for years.  I line my cookie sheet with parchment paper though, as it will not stick like it can with foil.  Another method I use on weekends, is to take it out to the gas grill, which eliminates the cooking aroma from inside the home.

I always do my bacon this way, however I use a baking pan with a wire rack, or a broiler pan. Place foil on bottomed of pan then place the wire rack or broiler top, put bacon strips and place in a 400 oven. Clean up is easy because of the foil and the bacon is not greasy and does not even need to be drained on paper towels. Love my bacon this way.

I've been cooking bacon in the oven for years.  However,  put the bacon on a rack over the pan.  This allows the grease to drip off, and makes for a crisp bacon on both sides, without having to flip it.

Best way ever to make bacon. I also turned my bacon a half leave through. I like to use parchment paper. With just a little over hang.  So when the bacon cooks the edges of the paper fold up a little.  . When  The bacon is done take it off and drain on paper towels. I either poor and save the fat. Or leave the fat on the parchment paper to solidify. Then just fold up the parchment paper and toss it in the garbage.

This bacon did come out straight.  Which was what it said it would do.  But it took much longer to bake than it said.  Maybe because I put it on the bottom rack.  Bacon is Bacon!  Delicious in every which way!  But even given 20 minutes in the oven it didn't come out crispy.  I had to use it for my egg sandwich and would've have liked everything to be done together.

This was so much easier than the traditional frying.  I used one suggestion and brushed on pure maple syrup, yum!  Although I have to say the clean up on my baking sheet has been more than I wanted to do.  I did remember to sprinkle Cream of Tarter on it when it was damp and semi clean, did help brighten it up.  Next time I will line it with foil to make clean up quicker.

Yes, cooking bacon in the oven is a good way to cook it if you need 8 or 9 slices.  I've cooked bacon just about every way possible over the years. I have a house full of kids and other things to tend to, so I set out to figure out a better way to cook bacon using either the stove-top, oven or microwave. After considerable thought and research, ended up developing the Bacon Pro bacon cooker for the microwave. This cookware has twice the cooking surface and cooks twice the bacon in less time with less energy consumption than any other method. The microwave is perfect for cooking bacon on a Bacon Pro. I have to admit, using a Bacon Pro does not evoke emotional sentiment of days gone by or fond cooking memories. It merely gets the job done better. It's all about enjoying the bacon.

We enjoyed this less messy way of preparing bacon. I found baking it at 400 on the cooling racks sitting on the foiled cookie sheet  for about 15 minutes was about right for us. Thanks for this recipe& the helpful reviews.

I am all about not getting popped by bacon grease, so I was eager to try the oven method of cooking bacon.  It took longer, a lot longer to cook the bacon crispy and it made a greasy mess in the oven.  However, it beats getting popped..

The bacon was delicious and I like cooking it in the oven, but mine took much longer than the recipe states.  I had to keep checking in and it took almost 45 minutes.  This may be due to the fact that my oven heats very slow, so ovens vary and your time may also vary.

This did not work for us at all.  The bacon cooked unevenly and took FOREVER.  In the end it was chewy like leather and didn't come close to crumbling for my next recipe.  Life is too short - microwave your bacon.

I wish I could figure out the secret to this, but it just doesn't work for me. I wanted to use this for broccoli salad so I could stick the bacon in the oven while I prepped the rest of the salad. I tried this a year or so ago and I ended up removing it and finishing it in the microwave after about 40 minutes. I tried again today with a 400 degree over per some of the reviews. Still didn't work. After 30 minutes, the edges were starting to burn but the center wasn't even close to done. Sorry, but it's back to the microwave for me. It cooks more evenly, is crispier, and doesn't come out dripping in grease. And I can cook the whole package (just not all together) in about 15 minutes.

I never knew making bacon could be so easy.  I use a raised baking pan with a cooling rack to hold the bacon.  Making large breakfasts was a hassle because I could never fit enough bacon in a pan on the stove.  Now I save a burner for other things and end up with a far superior product because they are cooked (mostly) evenly.  And there isn't nearly the mess which is a huge bonus.

I bake my bacon all the time!  Love it, agree with your reasons for doing so!  I use the edged jelly roll type cookie sheet pans, and sit my cooler racks inside them, lay the bacon on top, and all the grease drips down---leaving my bacon, to cook faster, and not sit in the grease.  Gotta love any way to make bacon easy!!!

My 5 star rating is with the following changes: 

1. I sprinkled brown sugar and coarse ground black pepper all over the top of the bacon prior to putting it in the oven

2. I cooked bacon on 350 degrees for 25 mins to get it to desired crispiness. I think 10-15 mins would work if the oven was set to 400 degrees.

Tip: Do not overlap areas of bacon. Place them side by side. Overlapping will result in that portion of the bacon not cooking to desired crispiness.

I will definitely make it again. I did find, however, that it took more like 20-30 minutes to get crispy.

Every oven is different.  Know your oven.  When I cook bacon in the oven I set the temp at 425(anything less and you'll be waiting forever) , and it usually takes 10-15 minutes.  Remember the bacon will cook an extra minute or so on the baking tray after you pull it out IF you don't remove it immediately.

We make a lot pizza and sandwiches at home and this recipe for bacon "in bulk" is great for our family. It ended up taking 34 minutes in our oven, with two cookie sheets of bacon, to get to the crispness we like. The mess was minimal and I packaged the cooled bacon in twos and fours and froze them. It's a quick 20 seconds in the micro to have some ready for a BLT, a a club sandwich, breakfast or a pizza. Thank you for posting as I dislike cooking bacon the regular way so much that I never did it. My kids are thrilled,mad is the hubby as they all LOVE bacon!

I found that 25 min at 400 was better for me; the bacon was succulent in a way I've never had! Hubs would have preferred another 3-5 min for crispier bacon.

I think I will always make bacon in this manner.  I drained the bacon grease and used it later.

Awesome, super QUICK as well as EASY BREEZY! While the bacon is cooking you have more time to focus on the rest of your meal with no worries about turning and/or watching the bacon constantly! Love love love it!! Thanks a bunch! :)

bacon came out almost perfect.. i used naples34102's oven set at 400 but i noticed my bacon a little overdone at the ends.. i'd probably stick to 350 or maybe 375 next time.. like many others i checked at 10 minutes, drained, flipped and cooked for another 5.. i thought about using a cooling rack for cooking but i didn't want another dish to dirty.. i like using the foil for the easy clean up.. ty for the method

This is how I make bacon now and then freeze unused portion. I bake at 350F for the first ten minutes, then increase temp to 400 F and bake until it is browned. I remove from oven to let the residual heat in the pan finish the browning.

My favorite way to cook bacon. I like to lightly sprinkle with brown sugar before baking. The pan I use is one of those roasting things with the drip catcher bottom and the slotted top - it works great and drains the bacon automatically.

I have also used this recipe for years. I also sprinkle sugar on the bacon, but I cook it in the oven on grill pan so 
The grease drains off. I love my bacon crispy and grease "free".

I always cook my bacon this way. I love Ronnie's idea of using two cooling racks & flipping the racks instead of turning each piece of bacon. Thanks, Ronnie - good idea. Fabulous way to enjoy bacon!

I have been doing bacon this way for years now! I love it as its so crunchy. I also line my cookie sheet with foil and just give it a light spray of Pam or whatever you use. Such an easy clean up! I have never brushed anything on it before..but I will try that. I also use just regular bacon or even turkey bacon like this. However with the turkey bacon I do season it with lots of black pepper just to help with the taste!!

This is the perfect way to make a lot of bacon for a crowd. But it is so easy and relativy mess-free, we'll be using it for times when we cook just a normal amount of bacon, too.

I always cook my bacon this way, though at about 400 degrees. Thickness doesn't matter, just cook for less time. Also I line the bottom of the cookie sheet with aluminum foil to make clean up a snap.

My family loves bacon, but I hated making it because of the clean up. Now it is so much easier! This has saved a lot of time and work in our house and still delivers delicious crispy bacon.

This is the method that we use for our large family.  It is a great time savor (get it savor!!!) and once you try this way of preparation you will never use the frying pan again!!!  We also like to indulge in turkey bacon and we pop it in the oven too at 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes...you have to watch it though, it can easily burn...take the turkey bacon out just before it looks crispy and it will turn out perfect.

I have been doing this for 30 years!  It really is the best way...just didn't realize so many people weren't aware of this method. Adding maple syrup or cinnamon and a bit of brown sugar is something I haven't tried yet, though...going to next time I treat myself to bacon! :)

Came out slightly greasy but much better then cooking on the stove.  Next time I will use a rack to lift bacon off of the baking sheet.

This was fantastic - the whole family was home and for once the bacon was done at the same time as the french toast. Won't go back to cooking it in the skillet any time soon.

I was a little skeptical of this way of cooking bacon. I was pleasantly surprised at how tender it came out though! I usually eat my bacon very crispy. I did have to cook it much longer than the recipe called for but it was well worth it! I used part of the bacon for a soup and it was pefect!

MMMM I love bacon!  This is a great way to cook it.  I had to cook 4 pounds for Christmas Brunch and this was very time consuming.  Each batch took about 20 minutes.  I will for sure use this method again for a smaller amount.  Mmmmm did I mention I love bacon??!!

This took about half hour to cook and still wasn't "crispy."  However, I used a broiler pan so the fat would drip down through the holes.

I've been doing my bacon this way for years and it is great. I set my oven to 400 degrees F and use a 14 x 22 x 2 baking pan. This just fits on one rack from front to back, and side to side. I am able to cook a lot of bacon at one time with no mess.

The directions on bacon show an option to bake, but how many have ever read it?  This is the best way to cook a whole lb without all the mess.  I dont always use foil but I do spray the pan.  As long as you overlap, the whole lb will fit on a big cookie sheet. Just watch closely at the end cause is gets crisp quick.  I dont ever use thick bacon.  Any will work as long as you watch it. I bake at 400.

I worked in restaurants for quite some time and this is the way we always cooked bacon. It takes very little effort and almost always ends in perfectly cooked bacon.

I always cook my bacon this way, it is so easy and it turns out great every time. The only thing I do differently is I put the bacon strips on a rack and then the grease is below the bacon. Delicious

This was a great way to cook bacon! 400 for about 10 minutes.  Here are my tips for fast cooking:  Line pan with foil, turn half way, use lower racks,  do not use cooling rack in pan.  I made two pans of regular sliced and put one on each oven level. The lower cooked MUCH faster, as did the bacon that was just on the foil.  Thanks for a great method!

Fantastic.  My Mom always cooked bacon in (on?) a broiler pan, but the grease was always a mess and the bacon wasn't perfect.  This method (lined with foil) made fantastic, uniform and tasty bacon.  Thank you for my new fav bacon cooking method.  And, yes, do use foil on top of the pan, cuts down the spatter and I think the bacon just cooked better covered.

Normally we eat less crispy bacon but this was a great way to make crispy bacon for cooking. I suggest cutting the bacon in half just so it is easier to work with.

This was great, turned out perfect. I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes without preheating the oven. Excellent and no fuss. I did drain on paper towels as I don't like greasy bacon. It was all nice and flat, no curling, just as the submission said.  I'll be making my bacon this way in the future.

Flat - yes. Crispy - no. If you like your bacon chewy rather than crispy, this is the way to cook it. I baked mine at 425 for what seemed like forever (about 35 min.)  poured grease out once and even flipped and it did eventually get crispy, but I think I prefer the stove top method. Grease splattering and all!

I also cook my bacon this way. No greasy mess all over the stove, plus it allows you the chance to cook the rest of the meal without constantly flipping bacon over or getting splashed with hot grease.  It's almost like an extra set of hands in the kitchen helping out. So easy yet so obvious.

This is a great way to make a lot of bacon, but the temperature and the timing are way off.  I bought 3 lbs. of extra-thick sliced bacon and spread it across three cookie sheets lined with foil, just barely overlapping the strips to get them to fit. I loosely covered the sheets with foil, as suggested by another reviewer. With the oven at 400 degrees, the bacon was nowhere near cooked in 15 minutes.  At about 30 minutes in I removed the foil from the top of the pans to let the bacon crisp up and cook for another 5-10 minutes. So it took close to 40 minutes to have the bacon sufficiently cooked, but it did turn out delicious and was a big hit at the party we brought it to!

I will never fry my bacon in a skillet ever again after finding this recipe. I've been baking it for a few months now but have always forgotten to leave a review until now. I do find that 400 degrees works better for me but then again I like mine really crisp.*********update 2/11/15******This is the only way I have made my bacon since discovering this recipe. For something fun, roll a slice of thick cut bacon as tight as you can and insert a toothpick width wise and place toothpick side down on a baking sheet. Because they are rolled and not laying flat, the bake time will be a little longer but they make the cutest little bacon rosebuds you have ever seen. For that extra touch, put some artificial flowers in a vase and pop the fake flower off and replace it with the bacon rose. It makes for a fun presentation.

awesome way to cook bacon and didn't make my house smell all bacon-y all day!  I had to bake much longer, which is weird, because my oven runs hot, but this method rocks!  no more tending to a fry pan and getting curly bacon for me! :)

What can I say...great!  I have always microwaved my bacon but this method has no clean-up.  Let the grease cool on the foil, wrap up the foil and dispose.  No wasted paper towels (except for draining after cooking)  and no disposing of hot grease in some old jar or can).  What could be easier.  Use your judgement re: the cooking time and if you need to turn over your bacon, as oven temps (my oven operates a bit cooler that the actual temp setting) and the thickness of bacon may differ.

this method worked like a charm!! at 350 I did have to cook it a little longer and I also turned it halfway through.  Great taste with minimal effort!

I typically use center-cut bacon and it doesn't get as crispy as I'd like, but it's still a good idea for cooking a lot of bacon at once.

Bacon did not come out very crisp.  It did however make clean up easier and the kitchen did not smell like bacon all day.

My kids had a snow day today so I wanted to make them a good breakfast. My husband makes great bacon in the frying pan but I don't have the best of luck with that method.  Tried this way and the bacon came out perfect.  The kids and gobbled it up!  Thanks!

I always bake bacon, even if I'm only doing a few pieces for my husband and I.  I use a jelly roll pan (basically a cookie sheet with sides) and line it with foil, for super-easy clean-up.  All you have to do is let the grease cool a bit, wrap the foil up, and toss it.  I bake mine at 400 degrees usually for about 10-12 minutes.  I don't turn it.  I have also made candied bacon by sprinkling the bacon with brown sugar before baking it.

The first time I made this bacon I put it on a rack over a pan and it smoked terribly.  But now I just layer the bacon right on the baking sheet and it cooks up great.  I have to cook it about 30 min to be how I like it.

I decided to bake my bacon this morning because I just cleaned my kitchen and didn't want to make a mess. I wasn't sure about the recipe but I will never fry bacon again. I cooked on 375 for 1/2 hour and put the bacon on a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet so all the bacon grease would drain onto the baking sheet and leave crispy bacon. It turned out perfect!!

I really like this method, but like the previous reviewer I had a few issues.  I put the oven on 400 from the start but had to cook about 20-25 minutes anyway.  I needed a portion of the bacon relatively quickly, so I ended up pan frying that portion the rest of hte way.  However, the bacon that I left in the oven did crisp up, just slowly.  I really think that my issue was the bacon I used.  I had homemade, hand cut bacon from bf's family farm, and it is THICK, which makes me think it's the bacon.  I love the method, though, so I'll definitely use this again and just give myself more time if I have the same type of bacon again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I can't believe that you awesome cooks still heat up your oven (& house) especially in the summertime cooking thick bacon! Please join the me in the new frontier.  I learned this, by accident, when I bought my first TURKEY BACON, put it on 2 folded sheets of paper toweling. covered with 1 sheet & used my God given MICROWAVE at FULL POWER! 2 Slices - 1 & 1/2 to 2 minures, 3-4 slices - 3 & 1/2 to 4 minutes! And so on & so forth! You can use a flat glass oven pan & just put them directly on the heavy glass turntable!  My home stays COOL! How Cool is this ?????

I must admit, I shy away from cooking bacon for breakfast for my family soley due to the mess it makes.  If we are tring to get out of the house for our daily activities it just seems a chore.  I tried cooking the bacon in the oven and I will never cook it on the stove again.  I lined a cookie sheet with 2 layers of foil, and it turned out excellent.  After the bacon grease hardend a little, I rolled up the foil and threw it away!  No greasy stove either, hooray, my family can eat bacon again!  Also I did use thick cut bacon.

This is the way we have done thick sliced bacon at work for years! I tell everyone to do their bacon like this for less shrinkage. We don't overlap or place anything over it and we serve hundreds of people during the day. It really helps if you use a good quality thick bacon like Wright's brand. For some reason it always seems to taste better done this way and we always sell more of it when it is prepared like this than any other way we've tried.

I, too, have been cooking bacon in this way for many years.  I use a large jellyroll pan (sides), place double thickness of paper towels in the bottom and a cake/cooky rack on top of that.  Place as much bacon as you can crowd onto the rack, single thickness, and bake.  Grease drips onto towels.  Bacon easy to turn with tongs if you need to do that. Very easy cleanup.

I have been doing bacon like this for awhile, (since it was mentioned at a Pampered Chef party) on my stonewear cookie sheet. I too use center cut bacon and cook at 400 degrees or so. I love this method but hadn't thought of the rack like another reviewer suggested...good idea! It does come out perfect every time!

This is great and I've been doing it for about a year now.  I hate cooking bacon in a skillet on the stovetop, so this is perfect!  I'm not sure about anyone else, but I actually cook mine at 425 degrees for about 25 to 30 minutes (start checking it at about 25) and it comes out crispy and perfect everytime.  I LOVE BACON!!!

I have no idea why I just heard about this from a friend this year.  I used this method with turkey bacon and it is perfect.  I am telling everyone now.  Plus it is quick.  I like it crispy so I do it for 20 minutes at 350.

I've been doing this for years too and the only thing I will add is: Cook it on foil, put the baking sheet in the refrigerator (after you remove the bacon) and let the grease harden (30 mins). Fold up the foil with the hardened grease and toss in the trash! How easy is THAT!

The only problem with the recipe was the timing of baking.  I had very thin bacon and it still took 25 minutes at 350 to bake to crisp.  Can't believe thick bacon in 15 min would be any where near done.  My oven temp is perfect.

Very good, I used a broiler pan so that some of the grease could drip off. Also halfway through I blotted some more grease off with papertowels. The end result was delicious, no more grease splattered pans for me!

I LEARNED THIS FROM MY MOM WHO HAD TO FEED A LOT OF HUNGRY FAMILY- SHE WOULD ALWAYS USE A RACK SO THE BACON WOULDN'T SIT IN THE GREASE- IT ALWAYS TO ME HAS HAD A DIFFERENT TASTE AND TEXTURE DONE THIS WAY-- YUM....  MMMMMMMM BACON-  ALOT OF TIMES I DO IT IN A BOWL IN THE MICROWAVE 'COZ MY FAMILY DOESN'T LIKE OVERCOOKED OR CRUNCHY BACON- THEY LIKE IT "WET"-  FOR A LOT OF YOU IT WOULD BE UNDERCOOKED

The middle of my bacon slices stayed rather soggy and the crispy ends even end drained on paper towels retained way to much of the grease I assume for basically boiling in it in the oven. I may try this again in the future with turkey bacon or on a broiler rack to get it out of the fat.

This was such a great idea.  The bacon really does cook up flat this way.  This made it so much nicer than getting grease all over the stovetop.

Yep!!! This makes crunchy crisp bacon and it is oh so good. I would agree with the comment that this is the best way to make bacon for a crowd and is a much healther and cleaner method than frying. (That's if any method of eating bacon is healthy - smile) :-)

This is a great way to cook bacon. Usually I'm cowering at the pan because of those sporadic splatters but NO MORE! I did cook for a bit longer (15-20  minutes longer) to get the crisp desired for 4 lbs of bacon.

Finding this recipe was great because I don't eat meat and subsequently was scared to fry bacon on the stove top, not really knowing very much about how to tell when it's done. Can't say if it tasted any better or different obviously, but having times and temperature did make it possible for me to serve meat at brunch. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to increase the temp to 400 and it took closer to 30 mins to cook it. I think I'll stick to my skillets.

Such an easy recipe and great way to cook bacon!  I always hated pan frying or cooking in the microwave and having the whole house smelling of bacon.  I kept the temp at 350, and baked for close to 30 minutes before it got to the crispyness that we like.  It was nice to throw in the oven and go about making other parts of dinner.  I lined my pan with foil and put a baking rack on top of that to let the grease drain down.  I didn't need to worry about flipping the bacon since it was sitting up.  Thanks for the great recipe and we'll definitely be having bacon more often!

This was good, but I had to double my cooking time! If I had a lot going on and didn't have much time to stand in the kitchen - this would be worth it.  Otherwise, I prefer the taste of fried bacon.  Baking it just changed it somehow?!

I cooked this as directed, with just a half a pack of bacon and it was definitely not crispy after 15 minutes. Per the top review, I drained the grease and flipped after 7 minutes and put them back in the oven for 8 minutes. Next time I will turn the oven temp to 375 and try cooking for the same amount of time. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe. I put my bacon on a rack in the broiler pan and loosely cover with foil in 400. We have a large family and I cook 2 packs at once, the pieces do overlap, but they all come out nice and crispy. Also, I use regular bacon, not thick cut. So EASY!!

This is one of the best tips I have ever received on cooking bacon!  I used to break out the huge iron skillet and the bacon press ... NO MORE!  Cooking the bacon this way leaves my hands free to make the rest of the meal.

I can'y believe that I had this recipe saved in my recipe box for such a long time and waited so long to try it. It just can't get any easier! I used regular sliced bacon and followed the directions as written for the exception of longer cooking about 10 minutes more and flipped them one time. If you saved it, then you must try it, don't wait!

I loved the idea of this....but it did NOT work out as easy as the recipe indicates it should....I used 'regular' bacon- and ended up cooking at 450 for about 15 minutes...and ended up setting off the fire alarms.  It was good- but only for the amount of bacon 1 pan can hold (I used a cooling rack on a foil covered baking sheet).  Thanks anyway, but I'm sticking with the microwave.

I work in a hospital where the bacon is so good I crave it on my days off.  I finally found out this is the method used to cook my favorite bacon.  I agree that you need to increase the oven temp to 375 & the cooking time to 25-30 minutes if you like crispy bacon.  I don't turn it or drain it until it's done.  I immediately place on lots of paper towels to drain really well.

I will NEVER fry bacon again!  This worked fabulously.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you don't HAVE to use thick cut bacon (just watch it) and also it took longer to cook, plus had to be flipped three or four times instead of just once.  Overall, though, the bacon was cooked evenly and I was able to get two pounds done in the time it would have taken to do half a pound on the stovetop...and without the mess all over the stove!  Thanks for a great, simple recipe :-)

This is way more convenient, but it took about 45 min. to get it crispy.  I had to overlap the bacon on the pan to get it to fit and that made it all stick together.  :(  Next time, I think I'll split it up between two pans. Update: Today I did 400 for about 20 min.  Good but not super crispy.

I started off following the original instructions but ended up increasing the temperature to 375 and cooking the bacon for about a half hour.  The mess was minimal and I'll definitely do this again, possibly upping the temperature to 400 next time.

My brother-in-law taught me this last year, except he grinds fresh black pepper on the bacon before putting it in the oven. It's the best tasting bacon ever! I use the thick slices on my pampered chef large bar pan.

I use this method & pan frying depending on the mood I'm in. Baking it in the oven is the perfect way to get nice, evenly cooked, straight bacon. You can fit more on a cookie sheet than in a skillet. When pan frying, you almost always have big pieces of fat that get picked off & thrown away. In the oven, it all gets nice & crispy & edible.

a huge time saver. i was making breakfast tacos for my husband's class, and this made it easy. i used thinner bacon and it still came out fine. it did take me longer both times i did this; i turned the bacon halfway but didn't bother draining until it was done. thanks!

even better, use a cast iron skillet in lieu of the foil lined cookie sheet.  Using the drippings for other recipes or for gravy.

I use a jelly roll pan lined with foil, and even though the recipe submitter says you have to use thick bacon, I NEVER do, I use regular ole oscar meyer. LOVE this method... no splatters, no mess, just let the grease set and fold up the foil and throw it out. I also do not ever turn mine... I just let it cook. Love it!!!

This idea is actually on the back of some bacon packages. I LOVE it and no longer fry bacon in a pan whether I'm cooking small or large quantities. I haven't used foil and the results were fine but I may  try it next time.

I use this method whenever I need more than a few slices of bacon because it is faster and takes fewer papertowels than microwaving it.  If I am having a brunch, I make it ahead of time (take it out a couple of minutes early when it is still slightly limp), drain on paper towels, then layer it between paper towels in a large microwable container.  The day of the brunch, I microwave to heat and finish crisping.  This leaves the oven for my breakfast casseroles.

Try sprinkling with brown sugar before you bake.  The hardest part is not eating a whole pound of bacon all by yourself.

This was great for making BLT's. The bacon came out nice and crisp and all done at the same time. I lined it with foil and cooked it at 400 - turned and drained it twice. It took about a half hour. Thank you for sharing your recipe :)

This is an awesome way to cook bacon. Comes out perfect! I use parchment paper to line my baking sheet so it doesnt stick like it sometimes does w/ tinfoil. 
As others have stated, make sure you use a tray w/ sides so the grease doesnt drip off.

Sorry, wrong review.  This bacon is fabulous and easy to make, it's nice to not have to stand over the stove and a greasy pan!

Four stars for as written, 5 stars if you follow suggestions.  I foil-lined a jelly roll pan, used a cooling rack for one, broiler pan for the other.  Both work.  Took ~25 minutes for medium-sliced bacon.  The 3 men I served were very complimentary about the flavor but lack of grease.  Great recipe!

Wonderful idea. It did take much longer than the recipe indicates to finish baking, though. Overall, I'll do it again when I have a crowd and the time to wait on it!

I've used this way to make bacon for years.  I line the cookie sheet with foil.  I put the bacon at 400 for 7 minutes on each side, and then wrap them in paper towels to blot away the extra grease.  Draining isn't necessary either if you use the paper towel method.

This was good but I prefer to fry it better. Thanks anyway.
