My family really enjoyed eating this and my grandchildren loved helping me make it. So easy. Be sure to refrigerate after making. It sets up beautifully. For a bit different mix use the peanut butter chocolate chips instead of the plain chocolate chip kind. Everyone liked this. It made quite a bit. Not super sicky sweet either like alot of fudge recipes are. You can't go wrong with the recipe.

Super easy! The small jars of peanut butter are two cups so I just add a small jar of peanut butter a cube of butter and a bag of chocolate chips. It is very soft.

I just made it for a bake sale on short notice it tastes amazing! Just like reeses cups I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet ones and topped it with walnuts. It's easy to follow quick and delicious.

This is a must recipe for our family every year. This year I didn't do all of the baking I normally do but I had to make this one at the request of all my children. If you follow the recipe properly it works great. And you have to keep it refrigerated. If it didn't work you didn't do it right. We have been making it for several years. You can make it healthy by using natural peanut butter and sugar free chocolate (or low sugar chocolate) and it still tastes great.

Very good and very simple did mine in an aluminum disposable pan with parchment paper. Gone in 5 minutes.
