I halved the recipe and it still made quite a bit. It is very spicy, adjust to personal taste, I omitted the jalapeno and would reduce the cayenne next time. I replaced the garbanzo beans with vegetarian baked beans as my son doesn't like them. You cannot taste the pumpkin, it just makes it very thick. Topped with sour cream and shredded cheddar.
