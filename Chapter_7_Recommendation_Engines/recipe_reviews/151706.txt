5 stars with a bit of tweaking.  Instead of the puff pastry, try pre-made phyllo cups - so much EASIER! Also, add half a red grape on top AFTER cooking for a pretty presentation.  The fruit brings out all the flavors, too.

I'm giving this a 5 even though I changed it a bit. I think the changes I made were not big enough to affect the final outcome, and I can never stick to a recipe! I used frozen tart shells instead of the other pastry because I was unable to find the pepperidge farm stuff. I used herbed brie and left the rind on. After cooking I topped with half of a red grape.  I served these at a large party and had MANY requests for the recipe. It was a hit!

I used the mini phyllo cups and added half of a red grape per recommendations.  The grape was a nice touch but I think next time I will spend the extra time and use puff pastry.  These would have been so much better with the buttery taste of the pastry compared to the crispness of the phyllo.

Ah, can you say savory and yummy?  Perfect with a glass of wine.  I made these as a trial for one of the dishes I will be bringing for Thanksgiving dinner to a friends-I will definately be bringing these.  I used an Herbed Brie.  The smell as they are cooking is to die for!
Great recipe. Make sure you use a good quality Dijon mustard.
I made this again using a regular flavored Brie and they were not as good as the first batch- I will make again only using the Herbed.
The guests at the dinner scarfed them down but I knew that my trial batch was better!

Let me start by saying I'm not exactly a genius in the kitchen, but...instead of using puff pastry sheets, I used the pepperidge farm puff pastry shells because I thought going through all that with the sheets wasn't worth it when all you needed was a pastry cup. Bad idea. I didn't realize they come flat and raise in the oven.  They have to cook for 20 minutes, per the package instructions. So I cooked them for 15 minutes and cut out the middle. (You can't take off the top and fill them. When you take off the top, most of the pastry comes off and there's no "well" to stuff). When you cut out the middle, the space is so tiny. It was hard to judge how much nut mixture vs. cheese to get in there. I put them back in the oven for 5 minutes and the cheese melted. Having said all that, they were just okay.  I thought the mustard was too strong (I used grey poupon). And don't chop the nuts too small or they just get lost. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't use the sheets as directed and maybe the filling would have been more balanced (more cheese vs. mustard mix) and tasted different.  Another reviewer used phyllo cups and had success. The silver lining to this attempt is I found puffpastry.com and they have some recipes there that I'll try.

When I made this for my guests, I dipped the brie in white wine before placing it in the tart.  They loved these!

This dish was o.k..  None of the flavors really stood out.  I had to add a lot more mustard to this dish to give some more kick.

First off, this tasted really good. 2nd off, it was super easy to make. It was so easy, that I had read the recipe a couple days before off the internet, then made it 2 days later when my internet wasn't working. I was worried at 1st but I somehow had the recipe memorized (because it's so easy) that even without the recipe, these turned out great! I made no changes..I liked the puff pastry. I used 1 of those small brie cheeses you buy at the store, the whole circle. Anyway excellent :) I am going to make it again soon. Oh the only reason I rated it a 4 and not a 5 is that mine did not turn out looking as good as the picture lol...maybe more practice with the puff pastry.

Very sweet nut combination overtakes the yummy taste of Brie cheese. Probably won't make again although my guests enjoyed them more than I did.
