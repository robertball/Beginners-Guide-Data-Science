Great recipe. Had most of the ingredients on hand. I didn't have green pepper and I added garlic to the veggies in the skillet. I also increased the vinegar and lemon juice, and added some leftover roasted chicken I wanted to use up. This recipe makes a lot of food and the leftovers were delicious too. Thanks for sharing!
