I have been making this recipe, without nuts or raisins, since the beginning of time, OK since 1970 (when I was 9).  My instructions were to combine all dry ingredients, make a well in the center, add all the wet ingredients, then mix.  Also, the instructions were clear about cooling, wrapping in plastic and refrigerating the loaves overnight for optimum moistness.  I have also tinkered with this endlessly to make it more Weight Watchers friendly (low fat, high fiber).  For the low fat version, change the 3.5 c flour to 2 c white, 1.5 c whole wheat flour.  Reduce sugar to 2 cups.  Reduce oil to 1/4 cup.  Add 3/4 c unsweetened applesauce.  Increase water to 3/4 cup.  No nuts or raisins.  works every time.  Makes a zillion muffins at 2 points each.  Or bread, makes 2, 9x5 loaves.  But who can eat just ONE slice?!

This is the same recipe I have been making for about 8 years, after one bite of my "Aunt Eva's Pumpkin Bread".  This recipe is very moist, flavorful and comes out every single time.  I would suggest the following minor alterations - increase water to 1 C and decrease oil to 2/3 C.  Pour the 1 C of (boiling) water over the raisins to plump them up, then use the raisin water for more flavor.   I have been making it this way for 8 years and everybody loves it!

This is the best pumpkin bread!  I have made it dozens of times and it's always a hit.  I have even made it as a cake: double the recipe, take two bundt cake pans and prepare as directed, bake as directed, allow to cool, cut off the tops of each to make them flat so they will fit together when place with cut sides place together, it should resemble a pumpkin, ice with cream cheese icing (colored orange).  So cute!

We love this recipe!  After perusing many of the reviews, I made some modifications to increase the recipe's "healthy factor."  Here is my ingredient list:  2c white flour, 2c whole wheat flour, 2c sugar, 2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp allspice, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/4c canola oil, 3/4c unsweetened applesauce, 3/4c water, 4 eggs, 15 oz can pumpkin puree.  Combine the dry ingredients, blend in the wet ingredients, then bake. Yummy and I feel good about giving it to my toddler.

I made three 5x3 loaves and one 9x5. I decreased the sugar to 2 cups, put the juice of one orange in a measuring cup, and filled it to the 3/4 cup mark with water, added the zest of the orange, used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened homemade applesauce, and used 2 cups of unbleached flour and 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour. It was so yummy! Using the orange juice and zest gave it a really good flavor. My whole family loved it! I didn't put nuts or raisins in it because I don't like them.

I enjoyed this recipe and had lots of compliments on it.  I made some with and without pecans.  It makes a lot - I gave some away.  I also left the raisins out only because my family doesn't like raisins.  It was very enjoyable though.  Very moist and delicious.  I recommend it!!!

My Grandmother always made pumpkin bread around the holidays and this recipe reminds me of hers.  It was very moist.  I cut the recipe in half, added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and baked in a 9x5 inch glass baking dish.  It was done in 1 hour and 5 minutes.  The smell was wonderful and filled the kitchen!

Definately a great recipe although I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I left the raisins out. The bread came out very moist and smelled wonderful while baking. However, this bread was just a tad bit too sweet for my liking; next time I will reduce the sugar to maybe 2 3/4 cups instead of 3 cups. Excellent fresh from the oven spread with butter or cream cheese!!

I do not normally eat pumpkin but have enjoyed
pumpkin bread before so I thought I'd try
this recipe.  It came out beautifully.  Very moist
and yummy!  I do not add the walnuts to mine and it
was still delicious.  I recommend it!

I have been using almost this exact recipe since the late 1970's.  I LOVE it.  My nephews call it pumpkin bread cake.  Family members ask for it during the holidays.  I have made many variations.   I prefer chopped pecans and use 1 TBSP of cinnamon, and omit the raisins.  For healthier pumpkin bread, I reduce the sugar to 1 cup and use 1 cup of the baking variety of Splenda.  I use Peanut, Walnut, or Grape Seed oil for Omega 3's, reduce oil to 1/4 cup and add 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I also replace about 1/2 cup of flour with 1/4 cup each of ground flax seed meal and wheat germ.  You can sugar the oiled pans for a nice texture on the outside of the bread. For adult tastes, I make Rum Raisin Pumpkin Bread out of this recipe.  Using my adjusted recipe from above, with the addition of the raisins and some rum.  Put the raisins in a bowl and cover with rum.  Put the raisins and rum in the microwave for a few minutes or so to plump the raisins until they are very soft.  Let them cool for awhile and grind them in a blender or food processor before adding to the bowl with the other wet ingredients. For a change, try adding a cup of flaked coconut or white baking chips.

I cut the recipe in half. I cut the sugar back in half again, only using 3/4 of a cup. Instead of plain water, I used a stewed/cooled cup of unsweetened honey vanilla chai for a little more flavor. I made no other changes.  I made muffins out of this recipe--I got twelve muffins that were a little on the small side. These turned out okay, but for us, they weren't really pumpkin-y plus they turned out a little dry. I think had I not added the chai, they wouldn't have had much flavor, either. This was a decent recipe but next time, I'll make something with more spices and more pumpkin. Maybe it was cutting the recipe back? I really don't know and I don't have the extra ingredients to re-try this recipe.

This was a great recipe.  I made it pretty much as is except for the spices.  I used 2 heaping tsp of pumpkin pie spice, a heaping tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp cloves.  The pumpkin pie spice is pretty much the same as the spices called for in the recipe so it worked out really well.  I also baked in 2 9-inch loaf pans instead of the 3 7-in pans.  I had to bake for another 20 to 30 minutes but the bread still came out moist and delicious, and the top didn't get too brown either.  I sprinkled the tops with powdered sugar right after I took them out of the oven which added a nice touch.  I loved this recipe, it has definitely become a favorite!

This is nearly identical to a number of other pumpkin bread recipes and so it’s as good and as dependable as the others are.  There might be a very slight variation in the amount of water (or orange juice) or flour among them (however, sugar always seem to prevail at three cups and oil at one cup) and with the seasoning as well –generally five or so teaspoons of a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, pumpkin pie spice and/or allspice.  Therefore, you can make this one confidently, as it is a general, basic recipe that has stood the test of time.  I have nothing against walnuts or raisins but I substituted about 1-1/2 cups of fresh, whole cranberries since I had them to use.  I baked this in two 9x5” loaves for 60-65 minutes.

Excellent recipe. You can modify it easily for things you might have on hand (Craisins or chocolate chips vs. raisins). Good flavor. I cut back on some of the white sugar and some of the oil and it still tastes great!

This is a great recipe. Following others suggestions I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  Left out raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts.  The recipe makes 2 good sized loaves.

This pumpkin bread was my first ever attempt at making bread at all, it was really good!! My 9 year old was helping me so I got a little distracted and forgot to put in the vegetable oil, but it still wasn't that bad, the only things I did different was 2 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar, and I didn't have ground cloves so I added 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I opted out of the walnuts and raisins and used chocolate chips instead, it was delicious!! I also used 8 mini loaf pans and baked for about 40 minutes! (just a tip, this is really good if you take a slice, spread a little butter microwave for about 10 seconds, add a few slices of banana on top and drizzle some chocolate on top) YUMMY!!!

Great! I took the others suggestion and only used 2 1/2 cups sugar. Couldnt even tell that was a change. I also was out of nutmeg and it was perfect, not missed at all.

I made this pumpkin bread for the first time over Thanksgiving and my brother sent me a text asking for some more for Christmas!!  It was melt in your mouth delicious.  I did steam a leftover pumpkin that didn't make it to a jack-o-lantern instead of using canned puree.  My very large family just loved it!!

I've made this for years... Always a winner.  Great it yields 3 loaves (can even make four smaller ones).  Once went too heavy on the raisins which was a mistake bc they stuck to the bottom and burned.  Overal- YUMMY!!

I  started making this bread and I put all the sugar in the bowl. Talk about an eye opener. I couldn't in good conscience serve this to anyone. This recipe has way too much sugar. I chose a healthier bread.

I have made this twice now.  It's not super spicy or pumpkin-y either one, though it does taste better and more flavorful the next day.  (There's really nothing wrong with it being less spicy.)  So good overall.  Here's my problems though.  I've cut the recipe in half, which fits perfectly into an 8x4 pan, but it doesn't get done in the middle without overcooking on the outsides and then ending up dry.  I have also used my little 3x5 pans and it does get done more easily in those, though you want it *just* done as it can get too dry easily.  It appears to work better in smaller pans, though I've never seen a 7x4 in my life.  (Since it makes a lot and you may want to cut back, do it yourself instead of the auto thing here, which screws stuff up.)  The other issue I have is the ingredients all out of order.  The first ingredient used is listed last!, one spice is totally out of place with the others, the pumpkin (used w/the wet) is behind all the dry stuff.  Etc.  This makes it difficult to follow and make sure you get everything in there.  And I absolutely will never understand what is so difficult about putting them in order... it's not rocket science.

These came out great. Used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar. Omitted the walnuts and raisins. Used 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce.  Made the mistake of adding a whole tsp of ground cloves. Still wonderful bread.

Great basic recipe! I split the batter into batches and added dried cranberries to one and dried chopped dates to the other. Excellent.

This  is the best pumpkin bread ever. I doubled the recipe and it made 9 small loaves and 11 large one. I only put in 3 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown and it was still sweet enough. My family doesnt want me to give it away as gifts. It will be a holiday tradition from this day on.

This bread was good, but it was a little too "spicey" for my southern tastebuds. I got my Grandmother's recipe out and saw that her's was similar but did not use ground cloves and only used 1/2 a tsp. of the nutmeg and allspice instead of the 1 tsp this recipe calls for. Her's also added 1 tsp of vanilla. I think that made the bread! Also, this recipe doesn't give good directions for adding the wet and dry ingredients together. If you just "add" them, the batter is lumpy. Mix the dry together in one bowl, the wet in another and slowly add the wet to the dry as you stir.

I used 2 cups of sugar instead of 3, used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce, and a little extra of each quantity of spice. I also used pumpkin puree from our pumpkin carvings. It turned out amazing!

WOW! This is the first pumpkin bread recipe that has won my whole family's approval! My kids took it to school EVERY DAY for their snack and their teachers sent them home asking for the recipe! My husband took a loaf to work, and came home with 12 people asking for the recipe as well! This a very generous recipe, I made two huge loaves that were VERY moist and spicy. The only alteration I made was adding a whole 30 ounce can of pumpkin puree instead of the 15 oz can it called for. I wanted to make sure it had a lot of pumpkin flavor, and I wasn't disappointed in the least. This will be the recipe I choose to make everytime we have a craving for pumpkin bread! Thank you!

I made this bread for Christmas gifts and my friends and family love it.  I use dried cranberries instead of raisins, and I only had 2cups of white sugar, so I added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  It turned out GREAT.

This is the best pumpkin bread recipe I've come across. Very easy to make, flavorful, and moist. And, not to mention if you make it plain, and add some cream cheese frosting you have a fabulous cake!!

Very moist and flavorful bread. I made this for a special project at work, 200 1 pound loaves! Due to cost, I omitted the nuts and raisins. I got 5 pans out of one recipe. It was a huge hit with the recipients and coworkers. I kept them in the foil pans and wrapped them in both plastic wrap and foil for the freezer. Some of the loaves were left over and after a year in the freezer they were still very moist and delicious. I love this recipe and have made it several times since then and it is always a treat.

I skipped the raisins and nuts (not a huge fan of in cakes, etc) and it was still delicious.  Just threw everything into the Kitchen Aid and voila! Couldn't have been easier, and it came out perfect.  Thank you!

Here is an alternate for those of you who like your pumpkin bread EXTRA pumpkin-y. I added some extra pumpkin, using a whole 29 oz can of pumpkin, cut down the water to 1/3 cup and added 1 cup of sweetened flaked coconut to the basic recipe plus used walnuts AND raisins (I like lots of stuff in my quick breads). 

This makes 8 small loaves of bread. This loaf is great for gift giving to eat for breakfast with tea or coffee.

This was tasty, but even though I followed the directions, it was still undercooked. I had to bake it an extra 20 minutes at least just to make sure it was cooked all the way.

Wow! totally wonderful and delish! I added 2 Tbsp of honey to the recipe and reduced the suger by 1/4 cup.  I used 2 9x5 loaf pans and baked for 1 hr 20 mins, probably could have taken it out 5 min earlier. Nice and crispy around the edges but not burnt.  Try it, you'll love it, packed full of flavor.
Thanks Denise!

This was pretty good.  I followed a couple of suggestions the first time and didn't care for the results.  I used pumpkin pie filling and used more than the recipe called for.  I did add a little more spice although not as much as the recipe called for.  The spices were too strong and the bread was very heavy & dense.  I decided to give it another try and following the recipe exactly turned out much better for my tastes.  Good flavor & texture.

After going pumpkin picking, I decided to try making this recipe with fresh pumpkin.  I had given a loaf of this pumpkin bread to my neighbor and a coworker.  I've gotten nothing but great feedback on it.  Everyone wants the recipe.  This is a great recipe, makes enough to go around, and it doesn't last long.  Thanks for sharing this and I HIGHLY recommend this for everyone to try.

Best pumpkin bread ever!!! I've been making this for years and it's always a hit!!! I use all whole wheat flour, and you can't tell.  I even add wheat germ.  I also substitue chocolate chips for the raisins, since my kids aren't big fans of raisins.  Heavenly!  This bread is so moist and yummy!! Love it.

This is the best pumpkin bread I've ever made.  I used 1/2 cup OJ, 1/2 cup water, and 2/3 cup of oil.  I accidentally doubled the oil and had to double the recipe but the 6 loaves came out perfectly.  I baked 3 with raisins and 3 without.  The raisin loaves are definitely better.

Mmmm good! a little note for those a little inexperienced (like me).. Fill the loaf pans maybe 3/4 of the way.  I filled mine up a little too close to the top and while baking.. it overflowed.  Also, instead of raisins and nuts, I added chocolate chips.  Yum.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will definately use again and again.

Amazing! I didn't have the smaller loaf pans, so I just used two 5x9, and they turned out great. Oh, also I used all whole wheat flour because it is what I had, and although I'm sure they were more solid with the wheat, they were still moist and yummy!

This is a great tasting pumpkin bread. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and it turned out great. Very moist and flavorful!

I tried this bread as soon as it came out of the oven and my first thought was that it did not taste sweet. After it sat and cooled for about half an hour though, the sweetness came through and it was excellent.

This is the first time I've ever made pumpkin bread, and it turned out delicious!  I didn't have allspice, so I used pumpkin pie spice instead and the results were great.  Great recipe!

I made this bread for Christmas presents this year and received rave reviews!  My only complaint is the bake time.  My bread turned out a bit on the dark side, so I think I would decrease it by ten minutes.  Other than that, it was beautiful and very tasty!

This bread would be great for people who love bread with fruit and nuts in it, but we don’t. it had a good flavor, nothing was too strong. There were many ingredients and therefore a lot of clean up. The baking time was perfect, the bread was moist and golden brown.

This was by far the best bread ever! I exhanged the egg out as my son is allergic for 1/2 tsp dry yeast to 1/4 cup warm water to set up in and I changed the white sugar out for Splenda. The bread came out wonderful and I am dieting so I have to watch myself. VERY VERY GOOD! It is a keeper by far

This is so good I usually make it several times over the holidays, and not usually the same way twice.  You can substitute dried cranberries for the raisins, pecans for the walnuts, it all works!

With an abundant supply of fresh pumpkins, I browsed the net for ideas - and this is what I found. Wow!! I have made this several times over with a few adjustments - honey instead of sugar; wheat + plain flour, half and half; soak raisins in hot water and then use the flavoured water. A master piece that my husband and I love to indulge...lol. Thank you!

This was what I was wanting.  I didn't add the nuts or raisins because I don't like those and I only did one cup of white sugar and 2 brown.  I just prefer that taste.  This is a great recipe and the spices were just right for me.  I'll be making this for gifts for the holidays.

Delicious! I had no idea what I was going to do with half a can of pumpkin (leftover from pumpkin cheesecake), so I decided to scale and make this recipe. I got rave reviews. As with all "cake-breads", I cooled it wrapped in foil to keep the crust soft. Delicious. Thanks.

I baked this recipe at my nieces' request for pumpkin bread, and they flipped for it. (My sister, finishing the last piece before church this morning, loudly proclaimed that this is the best bread I've ever made.)  ***Used pecans instead of any lesser nut and golden raisins for regular raisins.***  Guess you could say Holiday Pumpkin Bread was a hit...but why save this recipe for a holiday? I vote for baking this any time you find a can of pumpkin in the back of the pantry!

This Pumpkin Bread was an awesome recipe. I would have given 5 stars, but......I had to add double and some times triple the amount of measured spices (cinnimon,alspice,cloves,etc...) I made 75 loaves for family and friend's for Christmas, they RAVED over the Bread! GreatRecipe!!   Sincerely,   Countrygypsy

I searched for a pumpkin bread recipe that was moist and with lots of flavor without over powering you. This is the best one I have found. I only adapted this recipe by adding a tsp more of cinnamon and cutting the cloves to 1/4tsp for my own personal taste, but the original recipe is still great

I gave this recipe 5 stars! It really is easy and good. I did change oil to 1/4 and applesauce 3/4 cup. Added 29 ozs. of pumpkin and decreased water to 1/3 cup. I used 2 cups of sugar . My husband has been on Weight Watchers for a year so I do try to make it somewhat healthier! This will replace all pumpkin bread recipes I have.

This recipe was very tasty, but the suggested cooking time was a bit too long.  It is a little better when slightly under cooked, 40-45 minutes in the oven is better than 50.

This was a great recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because of the sugar amount!!  Holly cow!!  I used 1 cup of sugar and added the zest of 1 orange, and 2/3 C. of orange juice instead of water.  The bread tasted amazing!!  I'll bet it would be good with cranberries, blueberries, or even some grated carrot...yummy!!  Thank you for the recipe!!

The only thing different I did was I use a large can (29oz) can of pumpkin for more of a pumpkin flavor with the rasins and nuts..my co-workers love it! This is a great receipe. I'd love to try it using applesauce in place of something! (Ps.>I did not change the amount of the other ingredients)

yummy and moist, left out raisins, and sprinkled nuts on top for a more decorative look, subbed out some of the flour for some ground golden flax and oat meal, also left out some of the sugar, and added extra spices because I like it that way. added some ginger and turmeric to. just for a little added health kick.

I've been using this recipe for about 2 years and LOVE it! Changes I've made are as follows. I usually double the batch because I am usually giving some away or I freeze it for instant breakfasts for my children. When doubling, I use 7 eggs, 1 1/4 c of water, 4.5 cups of sugar, I don't add salt, only use cinnamon and a lot of it, and I use coconut oil in place of the vegetable oil. It comes out light and fluffy yet a hearty bread that sure is filling. Love this recipe and it is a staple in our house!

I baked this for Christmas to give away to friends. It was wonderful! Moist and easy to make. I substituted only 1/2 c of applesauce for 1/2 c oil and used pecans. I think this is a versatile bread and will try experimenting next time.

Loved it so did the people that received it as gifts.  I added  chunks of fresh apple to see what it would taste like instead of raisins.  Very good.  This is an easy excellent recipe. Thank you

This bread got rave reviews.  Very moist.  I increased the water to 1 cup and heated it and poured over the raisins as suggested.  Also added 1/4tsp to 1/2tsp ground gringer.  A little struddel (brown sugar, chopped walnuts & cinnamon) gave it a nice topping.

Loved it!  I made my own pumpkin puree and prepared the pans with Baking Pam spray, but other than that I kept everything else the same.  Everyone loved it and said it wasn't overwhelmingly "pumpkinish" (as these holiday breads can sometimes be).

This was WONDERFUL! Following the advice of the first review, I made this weight watchers friendly. Left out nuts and raisins, added chocolate chips (still only 4 points each muffin--2 each without chocolate), and made into muffins. KIDS loved them, FRIENDS loved them! Will make again, without chocolate chips and with a maple glaze...YUM. This is a keeper for sure! Love it! :)

I don't make pumpkin bread very often but when I do my recipe is very similar (a bit less sugar and oil).   I always substitute orange juice (fresh) for the water.   Gives it an interesting taste and everyone loves it.

This is by far my fav pumpkin bread! I never have allspice so I made it w/o it and it was still sensational! I live in high alt. 7500 ft and I had to adjust it a little. I added a tad more liquids, less sugar and a tiny bit less baking soda/podwer.

I LOVED this recipe, as it makes so many loaves at once. One loaf can have nuts, one can have raisins and one can have mini chocolate chips.I substituted Cinnamon applesauce for the oil and thought it gave it some extra zing.

This was super moist!  I made a couple changes that my family loved. First, I cut the sugar to 2 2/3 cup and instead of oil, put in 1 cup applesauce.  We don't like raisins or nuts, so we left those out.  Instead of all loaves, I saved some of the batter for mini muffins and topped each muffin (before cooking) with a few choc chips.  My kids loved them!

This is really good. The bread is really moist and to be honest it was really easy to make. I'm not the best when it comes to following directions, and have in fact burned water. I always tried to help my mom make bread any type of bread and this seems very similar to what she always made. I also did not put any nuts or raisins in it, as the family doesn't really like them that much.

This bread was the most delicious pumpkin anything that I have ever devoured. Being a horrible klutz in the kitchen, this was impossible for even me to mess up. I overfilled one of the bread tins by accident but saved the top from burning in the oven by covering it with foil during the last 10 minutes of baking.  I made a separate batch of mini-muffins at 170 C for 20 minutes. The bread especially was super moist.

Wonderful recipe.  I substituted applesauce for the oil.  Bread was incredibly moist and fragrant.  Will definitely make again.  Great as mini-loaves for friends!

This is a really easy, delicious recipe!  I would have liked for it to be a little more moist, but other than that it was great!  I don't like raisens, but love nuts... so I put two packs of walnuts.

I have been making this recipe for 2 years now and it is an amazing hit for my family. I accidentally made it the first time with 1 tap of each baking soda and powder and loved it because it was a heavier bread. I made it the way the recipe says and I didn't love it as much so I stick with one tsp. of each. Other changes I've made is, it doubles really well and they freeze really well! I made several batches before having my son (he was born in November ) and it was awesome to have breakfast and snacks ready in minutes! Lastly I have used coconut oil in place of the oil and it is amazing and much healthier! This is a staple in my house with my 3 kids!!

Always moist and amazing. I use pumpkin spice for the total of spices. If I use individual spices, I might double the amount. I have made without allspice since at a time I didn't have available and it was still great. I don't use raisins and sub 1/3 to 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar. I also increased the salt  if a taste test shows that it needs more saltiness. You can bake on small loaves and give as presents for the holidays.

Right on point with flavors. I cover with tinfoil at 45 min or else it gets too dark on top. It was done around 55 min. I used slightly less sugar but didn't change any other spices. Excellent made 2 standard bread pans

Absolutely amazing! I loved this recipe, I personally added 1/4 nutmeg, 1/4 cinnamon, and 1/4 allspice and I didn't use raisins or nuts because of family allergies. I was also using pumpkins from our garden so we puréed the pumpkin and I used that, but I added another half cup of the purée. And it turned out great, my batch made enough for a bunt cake pan and a loaf pan! I will have to try it again and maybe add some cranberries and raisins! I also made my own glaze for the cake.

I wrote a review on a similar recipe but this is actually the one I use. Very small different though. The salt is less on the other one and the spices slightly different amounts. Minor with good results either way but I prefer this one. I have made this since 1970!! It freezes very well if properly wrapped.

One of my favorite recipes! I cut the sugar down to 2 cups,increase the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons, and add 1 tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients. The texture is so soft and fluffy. The taste is delicious. I have made them as regular size muffins (baked 22 minutes) and mini muffins (15 minutes). Highly recommend!

I followed the ww-friendly recipe offered by another user and it was DELICIOUS!  I ended up making this recipe twice because I'd given too much of it away the first time!  As an added benefit, it made the house smell wonderful.

I cut the sugar to 2 cups and it was still sooooo sweet. Next time I will try 1.5 cups. I think I filled my large bread pan too full. It did not bake all the way through. Maybe  cuz I used the baking powder without aluminum? Oh well I would rater eat soggy bread than have my brain coated with metal.

Yummy!! I cut this recipe in half, because I just didn't want to make that much.  Used craisins instead of raisins, and did as another reviewer suggested: plumped them in warm water, then used that water in the recipe.  I made a big mistake and used a whole can of pumpkin.  That's ok,  I cooked it a little longer.  So moist!

P.S. If you are going to change the recipe (not follow it), and you don't like how it turns out, don't leave a bad review.

This is the most delicious pumpkin nut bread I have ever made.  I was a bit skeptical of the many poignant spices in the recipe that it would taste too strong.   It turned out just perfect and spices are not over bearing.   I used craisins instead of raisins.  I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups instead of 3 cups as I was concerned about it being too sweet.  Turned out great! I have baked two batches recently.   Definitely will bake again.

Very moist and easy to make. My family enjoyed it as did I; however, I thought it needed more spice. Maybe less allspice and more cinnamon or maybe some pumpkin pie spice.   I will try that next time. Good recipe.

Any suggestions for adjusting the baking temperature and time if baking in small disposable foil loaf pans (the kind you use for giving small   gifts)?
