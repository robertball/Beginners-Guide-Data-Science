I think instead of just using salt and pepper to season the chicken, something Lawry's like seasoned salt should be used to give the meat flavor on the inside. I would definitely make it again!!!! (I don't have kids, so I'm not sure how to rate that part.)

Fairly easy and tasty. This made a nice meal with orange cilantro rice.

Absolutely awesome! I was really skeptical (my mother chose the recipe), and even while it was cooking I still wasn't sure I liked the smell. But after the first bite, I was 100% sold! The flavor was absolutely awesome, and the chicken was tender & juicy. We accidentally omitted the butter, and honestly don't think we'll use the butter next time because we didn't miss it at all! Definitely will be a family favorite (even the picky 3-year-old gobbled it up!).

This recipe is the best i have made it about 5 times now and will be making it again tonight.  My brother is 15 and he loves it my 1 year old niece loves this also. I say if you use some garlic salt very sparcley it gives the chicken a great taste.

I liked it enough to eat what I made, but not enough to make it again. My husband thought it was pretty good, though.

This is an easy, delicious recipe! I wasn't sure about using the molasses but it tastes great. This is going into the regular rotation. Thanks Julia!

This was sooooo good!  I only had chicken breasts so I cut down the cooking time.  The sauce makes this dish!  Hubby loved it!

I should have known Molasses was going to throw it, for my tongue. The few times I have made honey mustard chicken I did enjoy it. Since I like Curry I figured I would try this out. Next time I would omit the Molasses and maybe add in some cream and bake the chicken in the flavor instead of just basting it in the sauce at the end.  Was okay but I wont make it again.

Made this last night for my husband and myself and other than cutting back on the butter, made it as is.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!!  Will make this again and would certainly serve to company.

I loved the sauce (I'm a big curry fan)so I think this would be more enjoyable with tenders where you can really taste the sauce with every bite.

Definitely a "make again" recipe!  I swapped the molasses for brown sugar (1:1), and increased the curry by 1 1/2 times for a little added zip.  I used boned & skinned chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken, so reduced the cooking time by about 15 - 20 mins.  Chicken was moist & flavourful - even my very picky hubby said this was a recipe worth keeping!

I love curry, but have to admit I wasn't overwhelmed with this dish.. IT needs more of a curry kick.... will try again but add more than a teaspoon of curry...
