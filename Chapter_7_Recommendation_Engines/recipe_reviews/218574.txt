I had less rhubarb and more peaches, so I used 3 cups of each (still equaled the same 6 cups of fruit).  I increased the sugar to 2 cups in an effort to counteract the sourness of the rhubarb but in hindsight I think I would leave out the extra half-cup of sugar next time, it was quite sweet, my own fault.  Despite that, it was extremely delicious!

Needing to use up rhubarb in my freezer, I came across this recipe.  Not having tried this combination of rhubarb and peaches, we found it delicious!  There is quite a bit of topping on this dessert, so the next time I make it, I am going to add another cup of peaches to mix.  We enjoyed this best, served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Although, my DH did enjoy it a room temp for breakfast the next morning.  This is a great recipe, and will be made again with fresh rhubarb about in season.

I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I might do heaping tsps next time. Tasty base recipe to use.

Great recipe.  I used a few more peaches but would cut back the sugar to 1 cup next time it was plenty sweet.

I liked this. I found that amounts called for were not ear enough for a 9 x 11dish. I used a 9X9 and that wasn't any too big. The recipe itself was delish!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out fabulous. It was a great dessert for our family dinner of six adults served with French vanilla ice cream. There was just enough left over for my husband who declared this was his new all-time favorite dessert!

This was delicious!   I cut the sugar from 11/2 cups to one cup and added 2 peaches instead of 1.  It was very easy to make.

Very good. I only had 3 cups of rhubarb so used 3 cups of frozen mango since I didn't have peaches.

Everyone loved this! We all agreed that peach is a surprisingly wonderful match for rhubarb.  I added cinnamon and vanilla like others suggested.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

The combination of peaches and rhubarb is delicious!   I used three cups of peaches and three cups of rhubarb and only one cup of sugar and it was the perfect  combination.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

This is a combo I hadn't thought of trying.  It makes a very flavorful fruit crisp.  I used more peach and less sugar than the recipe called for.

Used two peaches as there is plenty of topping. Preparation time is more like 1 hr. & 15 min. if you have to chop the peaches and rhubarb. Results well worth the time. :o)

Just made this for a woman's lunch. I made a half recipe. As a previous reviewer mentioned, I added toasted coconut to the topping and also some toasted pecans. Everyone raved.  Very tasty.

Um, yeah. Instant hit. I've made it three times already. Feel free to throw in a few strawberries if you got 'em. We also double the topping and save the extra for topping muffins.

I really liked yhis recipe, but admit to making it my own.  I followed a lot of the recommendations and reduced the sugar to one cup, but I also recommend adding a dash of cinnamon, ginger and allspice to both the fruit and the crumb top.  I also toasted 1 1/2 cups of coconut flakes in the preheating oven for ten minutes and mixed it into the crumb top before adding the butter.  Mmmmm.

This was absolutely delicious! Next time I'm thinking of changing the proportions of peaches to rhubarb to 4 to 2, rather than 5 to 1. I would like it a bit sweeter. But very good nonetheless! :)
