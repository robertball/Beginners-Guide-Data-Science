Delicious flavor and minimal prep time!  My only alteration would be to purchase a larger slice of ham if you want to serve four people.  (My family, husband, college-age son, and self devoured the 1-pound ham, and we're not big eaters.)

I've made this many times! The ham flavors all the vegetables.  Keep your potato and carrot pieces relatively large -- like 2 inch chunks -- and they won't end up so soft.  I like to prepare this meal ahead then cook it right before dinner.  Couldn't be easier!  and so yummy!

First thing I ever made in my pressure cooker and it turned out well.  I followed the advice to use 2 hamsteaks and didn't have any dried onion so I minced 3tbs of fresh (and a clove of garlic) and sprinkled it over the veggies along with some pepper.  Skipped the salt since there was plenty in the chicken broth and ham.  Good, quick weeknight dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first time I've ever used a pressure cooker and I'm so glad I broke it out to use this recipe!! My boyfriend asked me if we'd be having it again tomorrow night! The ham had such an amazing flavor. And it was very tender. We used new potatoes, green beans, and carrots from our garden. The cost of this recipe for us was only the cost of the ham!

This is delicious. I didn't have chicken both, so I just used water and it still was tasty. The veggies were done to perfection. I used a Fagor 6qt pressure cooker.
I made this again when my family was visiting, they loved it. I used low sodium vegetable broth and used baby carrots this time. Yummy!

This is a keeper and very easy. Don't over cook or  you will have mush for potatoes. I've made this many times now.

Fantastic, fast, and you get a full meal only dirtying one pot.  I love the tenderness of the ham, and even my kids will eat the vegetables.  We like to have leftovers for my husband to take to work, so we'll make more than 1 lb. of ham in the future.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Easiest meal ever! I use organic ham breakfast steaks over potatoes, carrots, and broccoli. I have tried many vegetable variations and they all come out perfect. I would never have thought something so simple could taste so amazing. Thanks for sharing!

This gets high marks for being quick, easy, and flavorful.  I skipped the addition of salt since I felt the ham and chicken broth had that covered.  Four minutes was just a tad too long in my pressure cooker; the ham was a bit dry and the veggies a little more done than we like.  I will definitely make this again, though, for a busy weeknight meal with an adjustment to the cooking time.

That's my kind of Sunday Dinner! To be on the safe side I let it go 5 minutes but didn't need too. Next time I will put the potatos on the bottom, then carrots, then beans.

I am new to pressure cooking and I am not very creative when it comes to recipes for the PC.  This was so easy and good.  It took me longer to peel and cut up the veggies than it did to cook it.  I had all fresh veggies on hand from my garden and just had to purchase a $5 ham steak to complete the meal.  Healthy, quick and inexpensive meal!

What a fantastic flavor. Tasted healthy with the fresh veggies. Make sure you don't overcook and cool quickly. I cooled the cooker under running water in the sink and it turned out perfect. I will definately be making this all winter, doubled the recipe for my family of 5 and had plenty. THANK YOU for the recipe it was awesome and my kids thought it was good also. Very quick and easy!

This was the easiest dinner ever, however it needs a little more flavor for my taste.  I will definitely make this again but will tweek it a bit with some garlic and black pepper at a minimum.

Great recipe. Just a heads up: Hopefully no one will forget to add the chicken broth necessary for the pressure cooker to operate safely, since it was omitted in the directions.

Easy and excellent. I used a reg pot to boil it in chicken broth and then boiled potates and vegt for 15 minutes and then put ham slices on top for 5 more . . . my Aunt taught me this a long time ago and I forgot about it! Thie is what we called a "farm dinner" LOL

So good!  But I agree with another reviewer that a larger ham steak would give better portions, or at least allow for leftovers.  Other than that, great meal.

The ham was tasty but the veggies were mush.
