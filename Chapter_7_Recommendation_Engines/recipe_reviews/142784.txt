This is a good basic recipe, but I substituted dried canberries for the dark raisins and used toasted slivered almonds.  I also added celery and some toasted almond oil. I did cut back on the oil. Loved the name of the recipe.  Will make it again.

It tasted okay, but also healthy. But it wasn't overly tasty or exciting. It probably would have been better with Imae's suggestion to add things like cranberries and celery as suggested. The apple started going brown quickly so I added a little lemon juice to stop it. I also replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil and cut down on the amount of it.
The kids didn't enjoy it, but ate it reluctantly (only because I told them I spent a long time cutting and grating the ingredients). But definitely would probably appeal more to health conscious adults than kids.

This is a YUMMY salad! I made this up for a Thanksgiving potluck dinner with friends and EVERYONE was raving about it and asking for the recipe!  I love how I was able to make the salad last night, leave it out on the counter overnight and throughout the entire day today and the salad is still as fresh and tasty as if I'd just made it.  GREAT salad.  (I don't usually say that about stuff that is so good for me!  So you know this has to be good...)

This is a great way to prepare raw carrots- surprisingly tasty for such a simple/easy recipe. I too added lemon juice and just a splash of olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I used my food processor- so it came together very quickly!

VERY good! I also used dried craisins, then raisins, apple, cranberry and slivered almonds. No salt (restrictions), but I added black pepper and onion powder. I also used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Thank you for such a wonderful-and tasty- idea!

This was surprisingly good! I made this as part of my mom's birthday dinner, and all the guests loved it. I substituted dried cranberries for the golden raisins, added one chopped celery stalk (for extra crunch and color), and only used a splash of olive oil instead of the 1/2 cup vegetable oil. I will definitely make this again!

Added toasted slivered almonds, celery and lemon juice.  Skipped the vegetable oil and raisins.  Delicious.
