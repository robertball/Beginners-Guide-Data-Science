This was a complete waste of fresh rosemary.  Even after four hours in the fridge, the steak was still flavorless.  They were salvaged only after we put some mustard on.

Used filets; added seasoning salt and used lemon juice instead of lemon peel. Decent flavor but not all that different.

I didn't find there was any real flavor and the rosemary burned.  I won't make again.
