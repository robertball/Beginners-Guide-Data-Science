Very good !!!  Amazing flavor !!!  I will make just the meat mixture for sandwiches or to be served over rice. It tasted good wrapped up in the phyllo  pastry, but  I won't make it like that everytime. This is a keeper for sure !!! Thanks Chef John !

This was spectacular!  Not fond of lamb, so I used ground beef.  The spices were spot on.  Used a pastry cutter to "crumble" the meat, and that made quick work of it.  This is an excellent company dish -- very dramatic looking and you can make the filling in advance.  Another A+, Chef John.

I made this recipe as it is written.  I liked the borek and will make it again but I thought it was a little bland.  The yogurt topping is essential and makes all the difference.  After all was said and done, I made 4x as much as was suggested.
   Just the same, I will look at other recipes and may add spices based on other recipes.
   It really is not as hard as it looks and is fun to make.  It looks beautiful when cooked and makes good leftovers.

It was good and added something to the list of things I could cook but it wasn’t something I see myself cooking often. My kids liked it and the yogurt sauce was good, I’ve been trying to make new and unique foods lately to get out of making the norm. My fiancé said “this is weird, but it tastes good.” I will say, not enough sauce is made as my fiancé is a sauce crazy person so I had to double up on the sauce.

This is a great dish. Flavorful and easy to make.  It's the easiest use of filo dough ever!  I think using the egg wash on it was what makes it easy to work with.
