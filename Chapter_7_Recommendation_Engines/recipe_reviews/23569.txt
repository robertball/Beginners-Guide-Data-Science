This is a very good dish!  I used white fish instead of tuna and it turned out very tasty.  It is quick and easy to prepare.

Surprised more people have not tried this recipe. Quick and easy with great results for a tuna fan! Not a big tuna fan myself, but my family loves it. I added seasonings according to their taste buds. Here are the extras I used to make a one dish meal. 

* I sauted the onions slightly with a dab of butter before placing with the potatoes. 
* Added just a touch of Ms. Dash with salt and pepper to taste.
* Brocolli and sliced mushrooms to give more variety for a one dish meal.
However, any vegetable or add in could be used to acheive the one dish meal, use your favorites. Try using Cream of Chicken -or- Campbell's makes a Cream of Chicken and Mushroom together. They have many varieties available now. 
* Instead of just pouring the sauce mixture over the top before baking. I tosssed it lightly among all the ingredients.

Thank You Sara for the recipe. Even my picky 6 year old liked it. He will only eat tuna salad, but tried this and ate seconds. I will be trying this again, maybe mixing it up for other meats, add ins etc...

This could be good with more seasoning and a little less onion.  

May try again.

we added some left over seasoned salmon, and it added some a lot of good flavor.  we also added some fresh mushrooms, i'd recommend that if you like them.  make sure to add the flour before you add the milk, the sauce thickens very slowly, since it took about half an hour, so i would make the sauce first.  the casserole turned out great, but there wasn't a lot of spice to it.  next time i'll try using dijon mustard to see if that gives it a little extra kick.

Although we do not care for spicy foods, my family and I found this recipe a bit bland. (Seasoned salt helped.) However, since there are so few recipes for potatoes and tuna, it was about the best we could do.

I made this according to the directions and didn't like the texture and the taste. I ended up just making quick hot dogs for my family instead.

The recipe was very easy to make and was very good! I would recommend this to anyone as a healthier alternative to most casseroles.

This recipe is good but ONLY if you add something of your own, I added some jalape√±o juice and some swiss cheese that made the trick, if not is too insipid

This recipe was not good at all. Potatoes and tuna do not go well together and it was EXTREMELY bland. It needs way less mustard, sub the tuna with a different type of meat, and major seasoning.

I took 6 potatoes and sliced with mandolin, and ended up using 5 cans of tuna. This dish did need some extra seasoning, so I added salt and pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasonings. I also didn't have the mushroom soup, so I made a roux (melted butter and flour) and added 1/2 cup milk to that, then added the rest of the sauce ingredients. I definitely would have added cubes of cheese throughout, but was out so I topped with parmesan. Wasn't bad, but it could still use some changes.

I have made this for years and we love it.  Sometimes I just make the sauce like a gravy.
I make the potatoes then layer American cheese and then top with the sauce.  We like it with ham instead of the tuna. To me this is like comfort food and so simple.
