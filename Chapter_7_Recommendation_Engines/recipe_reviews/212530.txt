I thought this was a little to bland for my taste buds, sorry.......I did a little changing by adding in a few extra ingredients to go with my taste. I added in garlic (thats a must for me) about 4 cloves very finely chopped, chives  and about 1/4cup chopped walnut mixed everything in and shapped it into a ball. Its even better the day after.

I liked it... not sure what you all are talking about, but my family said it was really good.  I made it and then let it sit overnight. I think that's why yours was "bland"- you need to let the flavors set for awhile.  Also, if you eat it when it's cold, it won't have as much flavor as if it's room temp.
