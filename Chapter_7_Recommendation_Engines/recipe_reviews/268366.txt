This turned out pretty good. I made another Mozambique recipe from this site last night as well and I have to say I preferred a couple of things about the other one over this one. The other only used half of the beer which made it less soupy and then it was served over rice instead of the rice mixed in which gave it a prettier presentation. What I liked better about this one was the white wine instead of lemon juice. Overall this is a great recipe and one I would make again with a couple of small changes.

What's with leaving the shells on in your shrimp recipes? I suppose it photographs well, It certainly doesn't add enjoyment while eating.

My picky husband loved it.  (Didnâ€™t use hot sauce but did a few hot pepper flakes)  We had enough for 2 meals.  I am not a good exact  recipe follower but mostly did.  Will definitely do this one again.  Thank you

Easy and delicious! The only thing I would change is to take the shells/tails off first.  Too difficult to eat when you have to keep stopping to peel them off and all the rice is sticking to the shrimp, messy.  Otherwise, my kids loved it and requested it again.
