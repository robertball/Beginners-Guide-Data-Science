I'm from Las Cruces, NM and was looking for a good green chile stew recipe.  This one was great!  Like other suggested, I used Bueno's roasted green chile instead of fresh roasted.  I used 3 of the 13 oz tubs. I drained them before I added them  Also, I omitted the serrano peppers.

Tasted like I was back eating on the farm in Espanola, NM. I changed a bit and have tried with both ground beef or ground Turkey. Both equaly good. Beef was just as rich as using pork.

Wow, was this ever good!  I used Bueno frozen roasted chilies as someone else suggested and beef broth because I didn't have vegetable broth.  Served it with cooked pinto beans and flour tortillas.  Absolutely wonderful!  Will definitely make again and again.  Reminds us of the pork green chili stew from a small Mexican restaurant where we used to live.

Excellent.  Highly recommended.  I lived in Santa Fe, NM for 13 years and can attest to the fact that this stuff is the "real McCoy!"

Excellent flavor! I omitted the pork and added blue-corn posole. I added another 12 oz of broth for the posole to simmer in, but it didn't dilute the flavor at all. I decided to leave out the serranos after tasting it with the chilies--it was plenty hot for us at that point (and we love spicy food). A note on roasting the chilies: These don't peel like roasted bell peppers; because the flesh is thinner, they fall apart and it's difficult to find the edge. I found it works best to work from the inside and scrape the pepper from the peel, rather than trying to pull the peel off the pepper. Also, I'd suggest wearing gloves--my fingers were still burning this morning. I'm usually a snob when it comes to using fresh vs. frozen/canned, but this was so time-consuming and tedious, I'll try the Bueno frozen chilies next time. (And there will definitely be a next time!)

I'm with you Lola7272!  Pueblo chiles are even superior to Hatch chiles.  Having relatives in Colorado Springs allows me to make my annual visit to Pueblo, CO and load up with 2-3 bushels of Pueblo green chiles.  After returning home, I fire up the grill and spend a day roasting/peeling/seeding/freezing the chiles.  They are heavenly right off the roaster!  I skip the serrano's and add 2-3 habaneros that have been seeded and minced.  I skip the potato and thicken with a roux and add frozen sweet corn.  The sweet corn and habaneros work well together.

Great recipe. I would use low sodium chicken broth and add cilantro, but you nailed it.  Of course New Mexico Chiles are the only chile to use here.

I used Pueblo peppers instead of Anaheims.  It turned out really spicy, but well worth it!

You could get away with using only 1lb of the chilies - I didn't care for this dish very much, my honey liked it but he too thought there were too many chilies even for something called green chile stew...  I thought it was bland - go figure.

Make as written with minimal preference changes.  I used chicken instead of pork.  Used 4 cups chicken broth, 1 1/2 lbs roasted Hatch Green Chile and instead of roma tomatos (which I didn't have)  I used one 15oz can of petite diced tomatoes WITH juice.  PERFECT!  Thank you for the recipe!

Soooo good! I thought I had already found our green chile stew recipe, but thiswas excellent!  I though the hubs was going to lick the pot! Followed recipe to a T except I used chicken broth and added a can of pinto beans to make it a little more hearty.  I ate mine with a squirt of lime juice and spinkle of chopped cilantro - DH had his over leftover white rice.  This will be a staple this winter!

This was very good! I was lucky enough to find some roasted hatch chiles here in So. Cal.and decided to use this recipe. I did have to change it up a bit due to what I had on hand.  I used chicken instead of pork, chicken broth, Rotel instead of tomatoes.  I also used 2 cans of Northern beans instead of potatoes.  Threw everything in the crock pot and cooked on high for 5 hours.  Delicious!

I'm not a wimp when it comes to heat, but I found that the serranos were a little too much for this recipe, distracting from the taste of a great stew. Still I loved it. I added a can of hominy to the recipe. It was OK, but the next time I make it, I will leave it out along with the serranos. Thanks for sharing this!

This stew is awesome! I doubled the broth, and still had to add a little water. I doubled the pork because my husband is a big meat eater. I also didn't have any roma tomatoes on hand, so I used a can of mild rotel. Excellent consistancy and flavor. I actually forgot to add salt, but it really doesn't need it!! I thought I had a killer chile recipe, but this one gives me a nice 2nd option!! I would definitally recommend this! For the chiles I used roasted anahiems that I purchased from a roadside vendor and had in my freezer. Also, didn't have any "mexican" oregano, so I just used regular oregano, and increased my cumin to 1 1/2 tsp - because I like cumin!! Thanks for the recipe, I'll make it again soon, I'm sure!!!!

Really, really, really good!  I just went with the anaheims (omitted the serranos), and it was perfectly spicy (just enough to make you sweat, but not be overbearing).  Awesome.  Need to double the recipe next time...  I only wish we could get the hatch (NM) peppers in Michigan.

This recipe was excellent! I was born in Santa Fe, but I haven't had green chile stew since I was 10, so I don't quite remember how it's supposed to taste, but this was pretty darn tasty. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because I wish there was less broth, but that's the whole point of the stew right?....not really the recipe's fault. :P

I took this recipe to a chili cook off and won!!!  The only change is that I omitted the oregano as I am not a fan.  I am a New Mexican no longer living in New Mexico but I get a supply of frozen green chili every year at harvest time and it is sooooo worth the trip.

Great recipe...pretty close to the one I have used for years. I am from Pueblo Colorado so am a fan of southwestern food. This chili is great for topping any mexican dish & even great over mashed potatoes. Green chili is a family staple.

Very good, but one important warning - test your chiles before adding all of them!  They vary widely - we used NM chiles that were HOT (and I love spicy food, these were a stunner). Thank goodness I had made cornbread & had sour cream on hand to stir in as a "tamer."  And that was with about 6 chiles!

I used two (2) lbs of pork tenderloin chops, cubed, two (2) 32 oz jars of home canned tomatoes with juice, two one (1) lb bags of roasted (Medium and Hot) Hatch chiles, regular Oregano, NO salt, three (3) medium potatoes, no Serranos.
Smells delicious.  Someone needs to make me some homemade, with LARD, tortillas just like my Grandma made.    
I can't wait.
YUM!

I had Anaheim peppers and cubed pork for stew that I was looking to use and found this recipe. It turned out excellent! I know I can always find a recipe on allrecipes my go to website! I did have a few changes. First, I had a busy day ahead, and I knew the pork would not be as tender as I'd like it in 2 hrs. I decided to use a slow cooker, I browned the pork with spices, onion and garlic, put in slow cooker with water on high for 6 hrs. I didn't intend to be away that long, so add more than the required liquid or cook on low, because I had to add more water when I got back. I boiled the potatoes before adding to slow cooker along with chilies and tomatoes and let it cook the last 2 hrs until the tomatoes softened up. I also put 1T cornstarch paste to thicken it a bit. the meat was so tender and the favors were amazing. I have saved this recipe! Thanks! 

One more thing, I did not add Serrano chilies, but I may add chipotle in adobo next time!

I'm giving this five stars because it ROCKED.  The recipe was REALLY flavorful and easy to put together.  I had never had this dish before, but made it for friends that have and they raved about it.  They had only had it with beef, but said they preferred it with the pork.

I did not have vegetable broth, but substituted with vegetable bouillon and it worked perfectly.

I loved this although I didn't have all the ingredients so, it's not exactly the same. I used a slow cooker, 3lbs of pork and chicken stock. I didn't have or use the tomatoes, potatoes, or the serrano chiles. I also took a blender full of sauce out and pureed it and put it back into the pot. I also stirred in some cornstarch to thicken. I served this over cheese enchiladas. So, Yummy!

I think this recipe has potential but I used about half the chiles called for (I roasted fresh aneheims)and it was way too spicy. I tried adding more broth to dilute it but it just turned it into soup. The flavor however was really good. This recipe as is would make a good sauce for any mexican/southwestern meal but on it's own it's almost inedible.

I'm making this now for the 3rd time - it's just awesome. I bought roasted/peeled/chopped/frozen hot Hatch chili's at Sunflower Market  - comes in a 2lb bag (about $6) so I'm hoping they work - I've used up all the fresh roasted ones I bought at a roadside stand here in Denver. Also bought for about $6, a 4lb tray of cubed pork from King Soopers (I freeze half for next time).--- Towards the end of cooking, I used a potato masher and mushed it just a little in the pot to make it a bit thicker - seems just the potatoes get smashed which is perfect. Serve with a splop of sour cream and it is just lovely - perfect for a winter night.

WOW! The best green chile stew ever! Thanks! I did substitute Hatch frozen Hot Green Chile, but all you really need is 1/2-3/4 cup of this Chile (note: taste as you add, there is a fine line between amazing and AGH!) I also added 3 TBS of cornstarch to an extra cup of cold chicken broth (instead of the veggie broth), then added it after I tossed in the tomatoes. The consistency was amazing!

I have struggled for a long time to find a good, authentic New Mexico style green chile recipe so was excited about this!  I actually made this in my crockpot and used about 2 pounds of boneless pork loin.  However, be careful because this came out HOT.  I love spicy things and can really stand the heat, but this was a struggle even for me to eat--had to load it with sour cream and tortillas to make it edible.  If you're using canned green chiles (which, truly, would be a shame!) I think you can get away with putting more in, but if you're using 2 pounds of real roasted chiles, be careful.  Perhaps the recipe means to be understood as 2 lbs. of chiles (weight before roasting?)  Try to visualize this as what it would translate into for cups instead once roasted or you might be surprised by the heat!

Fantastic find, I made a triple batch five days ago and have been eating it for lunch ever since. I rarely follow recipes exactly but this one is excellent as-is, a great stew for a warm day. My only changes were to use half Anaheims, half Poblanos, to use half vege and half chicken broth  and to use half pork, half chicken for the meat. This is an all-afternoon affair, don't skimp on the ingredients.  Fire up the grill, crack a beer and grill the fresh peppers - you'll be glad you did.  I would advise that you make sure the potatoes are getting tender before you add the peppers and tomatoes.  I might skip the potatoes altogether next time and add some corn and beans.

I love spicy food but this is way too spicy. I used only a pound of anaheim chiles. It was quite a dissapointment in flavor as it didn't quite tasted like the one we used to have at the rstaurant we frequent. It was kind of bland flavor-wise. I just ran to the store to get something else to fix for a quick dinner.

I'm from Albuquerque and make this stew often.  I have used Hatch green chiles from the can (last choice) or the Bueno frozen chopped green chiles to make this easier.  You can vary this by using beef broth and no serranos.  It is a very forgiving recipe. I've even used ground meat in a pinch. Best served with flour tortillas.

Very good.  I used fresh roasted Hatch chiles and I added 1 can (15 oz) of basil, garlic and oregano diced tomatoes, undrained.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe.

I am a New Mexican and this is my FAVORTIE, green chili stew recipe. I cheat and use frozen Burno green chilis that are preroasted. I also add a can of green chili enchilada sauce for a touch of more flavor. Yummy, yummy! I serve with fry bread.

Excellent stew! Just like I've had in Santa Fe. I omitted the serranos to keep it on the mild side for everyone's taste. I used fresh roasted chiles so the flavor was not compromised.  The chilies make the stew!!!

Delicious. If your dish is too spicy it is because you can buy at least 4 different hot levels of hatch chilies. Just got back from Denver and bought 5 bushels, but mostly mild because they have a great flavor without all the heat. Now I just need more recipes!

Excellent flavor but do be careful (like other reviewers mentioned) with the heat level. I used a 30oz bag of frozen chiles from the market based on another reviewer who used 3 130z tubs of Bueno. My first batch was waaaay too hot so the next day I made another batch without the chiles and added it to the first batch. I didn't use serranos in either batch and it still ended up hot as hell. Delicious flavor with quite a kick. I will use this recipe again.

Here's an option. Leave out the potatoes & just make the green chili. Use it to "smother" enchiladas, burritos, scrambled eggs, etc.  I live in CO and going to the farms on the Mesa east of Pueblo is a tradition. You can get your chiles freshly roasted, bagged and smell them on the ride home. Wonderful!!!

Very good soup. I only did two serranos, and put the seeds in the soup, and it made the soup quite spicy, but my husband and I enjoy spicy so it was fine for us. I bought green chiles already roasted at the store since it is now season for it, and that made prepping easier. Also, I bought two bone-in pork shoulder steaks and cubed the meat myself.

Followed recipe except for beef stock versus veggie stock.  Used 36 Oz of frozen hatch chiles, a mixture of hot and mild. Best bet is to test heat level of chiles before adding to stew. I've tried a lot of recipes for this stew but this is by far the best to date. Fabulous!

Made it with skinless chicken thighs and chicken broth, only used one serrano because I was skurred of more. Othewise, followed the recipe just needed less cooking time since it wasn't a hunk o'pork. Love it! Super spicy, using a mix of medium and mild roasted Hatch peppers but some rice and sour cream can calm it down. Great recipe, everything was spot on - thank you!

My honey and I loved it! I always add my own touches but the outline is perfect! I just use what I have which was chicken better than boullion red potatoes and jalapeños. Everything else was the same. I served it with brown rice and quinoa with kale . Definitely a keeper.

This was a great way to use a lot of Anaheim peppers I had on hand.  I left out the Serrano pepper and used a pint of chopped tomatoes I had canned earlier this year.  Yummy with corn tortillas and some sautéed squash or pinto beans

I live in ABQ and I never make green chile stew the same way twice! I made some with lamb yesterday and added some okra. Now that's tasty!! No need for stock since the lamb has plenty of flavor on its own. This is also good with goat meat.

Made it it was awesome!  It is very hard to find Hatch chile so when I finally found some it really tasted good.  Took it to work and It was overwhelming success.

I used jalapeños rather than serrano peppers because that's what I had on hand; otherwise, followed the recipe precisely. This is a glorious stew, full of lovely heat but not overwhelming (maybe an 8 on a scale of 1-10, but it will vary depending on individual pepper heat). Perfect consistency: not too runny, not too thick. The russets were an inspired choice--lent it a bit more texture than a red potato would have.  Would love to have this once a week, but it is undeniably labor intensive. Peeling the roasted peppers took over an hour (but I am not very experienced at that). Still, it was a beautiful way to use up the final pepper harvest of the season!

I had lived in New Mexico for almost 20 years and had already roasted some Hatch green chiles for the year.  This recipe is wonderful.  It turns out I got some really hot chiles and had used only eight ounces roasted and seeded.  The family likes hot green chile stew but I had to put the pinto beans (I had planned on serving on the side) into the stew to tame it down some.  Everybody loved it.  I would add another potato in the future.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I had everything to make this recipe except the veg broth.  I used a can of chicken broth instead.  This is the best recipe I've tried so far for green chili pork stew.  It is absolutely delicious and we will have it again tomorrow night!  Update, I've made this three times now.  The reason it calls for 2 lbs of chiles is because after roasting, peeling and de-seeding, the finished product weighs out at 1/2 lb.  When I ran out of hatch I switched to a mix of poblanos and anaheims and roasted them myself under the broiler.

I found this while looking for a chili recipe for my hot "Sandia" New Mexico chile peppers.  Even though this is for a stew, I swapped the potatoes for beans.  I also swapped the pork for grass fed ground beef as I don't like having to cube meat.

Since my New Mexico peppers are hot, I used a little less the 1 1/2 pounds instead of the 2.  If you have milder New Mexico peppers or Anaheim peppers, the 2 pounds would probably be good.  

This recipe was the basis for the best chili I have had in a long time!

If you don't want to roast peppers, you can order them pre-roasted online.  Just Google "hatch new mexico chile peppers".

We got some roasted chiles from the Denver flea market.  Looked for a recipe to use them in.  This one was highly rated, and I now know why.  Very good recipe.  Made the recipe with only one change, used the chicken we had instead of pork.  The three of us finished off the entire 6 serving recipe.  No leftovers.
