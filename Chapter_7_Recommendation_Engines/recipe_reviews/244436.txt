There is a major problem with this recipe, you just can't stop at eating a couple of these addictive meatballs. I will definitely make these again and per the footnotes add some red pepper flakes.

I followed the directions but doubled the recipe. It turned out to taste & smell overwhelmingly like orange juice. So I chose one of the listed optional additions of brown sugar & apple cider vinegar but it didn't help much. I like testing new ingredients & applications and think this recipe was a good idea but it's just not for me. Sorry.

Turned out pretty good. I would have liked them to cook a tad bit longer in the sauce before serving. That was my error.  Everybody really liked them.
