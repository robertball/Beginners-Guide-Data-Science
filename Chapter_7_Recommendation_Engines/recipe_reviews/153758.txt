Exactly what I was looking for! Sweet, creamy, with a nice vanilla flavor. I sometimes add raisins. You can decrease the sugar if desired to 1/2 cup and it's still great.

Mmmm... Very good and makes the whole house smell delicious but I modified it by adding 2 tablespoons cinnamon into the mix, chopped pecans, white raisins, and I had to add a little more butter (3 tablespoons) and 2 more eggs because after I mixed it all together, it was too dry to bake. Also I substituted the sugar for splenda because thats all we have in the house and I didnt want to go out and buy more and it tastes fine! My man is going to be so excited when he comes home and finds this waiting!

Thank you for this simple recipe. I wanted to make a kugel with ingredients I already had in the house. I just finished making it. It tastes very close to the kugel my Bubby used to make. I can't wait till my son tries it. He never got to meet his great grandmother, but at least he can experience the delicious food she used to make.

Best kugel ever!   Would maybe add raisins as a variation and a little more cinnnamon in the middle.   Wonder if brown sugar would be just as good as white sugar...not sure but will try this one again for sure!

not bad. This is compared to a favorite recipe from an experienced Jewish caterer though, not sure if it's fair.  I really would take the time to use fresh grated apples in place of the applesauce though.

Yummy, sweet noodle treat! I've never eaten kugel before so I have no experience with how this *should* taste, but I made it exactly as written and it came out delicious! (although I reduced the baking time as my oven is pretty powerful) It is decidedly sweet, and the applesauce gives it a fresh, fruity flavor. This would seem to be a great side dish with pork chops and roasted veggies.

This is a very good recipe, but I've made a few changes so it tastes more like my Bubbeh's... I've added raisins, mixed the cinnamon into the recipe instead of only on top, added an extra egg so that all the noodles are covered, and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup so it is not so sweet.

Had this exact recipe in a Jewish deli 20 yrs. ago and fell in love. I've made it many times and always add raisins. (With raisins you may want to cut the sugar back by 1/4 - 1/2 cup, I can't taste the difference). Hot out of the oven I eat as is.  As a left over I drizzle caramel sauce over the top and reheat.....it's divine!  I've also used 1 1/2 cups of smashed ripe bananas in place of the applesauce.  This is one of those recipes you can play with and it always seems to work.  Thank you Jewish Soul Food!

The flavor was excellent.  However, I tweaked the recipe a bit, I reduced the sugar slightly and added honey and a dash of ginger.  The only thing I would do differently is bake it in a 9x9 pan because the one reccomended in the recipe-  I like mine thicker and more custardy.

This was delicious. I added an extra egg, used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup raisins and added one teaspoon of cinnamon to the recipe. Came out amazing. My husband loves it and keeps giving me praise every time he eats it. Thanks!

I had a sweet tooth and wanted to make something with ingredients I had on hand. I have only had kugel once before, but this was very good! I used butter rather than margarine as that is what I had. My applesauce was unsweetened, so I used the whole cup of sugar, but I would add less in the future. I tossed in a handful of golden raisins and some extra cinnamon. A perfect, quick dessert.

Since reading all the mostly great reviews I am simply making my remark as not so good-mine was very dry followed exactly and was looking  to having a taste. I would have loved mine to turn out as others attested to a very tasteful dish.

I was craving my grandma's luchen kugel (noodle kugel) but didn't have her recipe. I looked around for a non-cheese kugel since my grandson is not a cheese fan. This recipe is easy and delicious. The dish came out perfectly. I wish I'd taken a picture, but it disappeared too quickly.  I used Splenda in place of the sugar (only have as much as the recipe called for) so that my husband who has diabetes could enjoy it, and golden raisins.  The  recipe offered a perfect road map and the outcome couldn't have been better.

Yummy! I made this with apple cinnamon applesauce, which made the pudding too sweet. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar, probably to 1 cup. I added 1 small box of raisins but left out the cinnamon. I'm going to a Christmas in July party tomorrow, and my friends love it when I include my heritage.

My husband's brother emailed this recipe to us, so I started off figuring that it was probably pretty authentic - I mean, Jewish boys growing up with Bubbie's kugle, they would know.  Me, I don't really care for kugle, but I made this for my sweet husband.  So: made per recipe except added one egg based on a reviewer's comment.  I thought it came out a bit chewy, even though I boiled the noodles a ways over 5 min. I'm going to soak half of the pan with some milk and refrigerate it overnight and see if that doesn't "soften" it a bit.  Stand by.

I made a few changes: I only used 1/4c sugar, and I added 1 small can of crushed pineapple w/ a little juice - this allowed me to cut back on the white sugar, and about 20oz of 1% small curd cottage cheese - next time I'll use the full 24 oz.

Also, next time I will grate the apples instead of using apple sauce and add some cinnamon into the mix instead of just on top.

This stuff is always better the next day and it's also good cold so I'm looking forward to tomorrow! :)

In my opinion, a 1 lb bag of noodles wasn't enough for a 9x13 pan, so I added made an additional 1/2 bag. I also added an additional 5 tbsp of butter, 3 eggs and extra applesauce, sugar, cinnamon, etc. It still came out a little dry but not horrible. It tasted pretty good though!

Yummy side dish if you like the sweet flavor.  Sometimes I add raisons or diced apple.  Gives a nice extra fruity flavor.
