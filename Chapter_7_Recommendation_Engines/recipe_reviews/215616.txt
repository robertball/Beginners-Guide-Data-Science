FREAKING YUM, Jen. I used ground turkey that I spiced like pork sausage would be spiced, homemade marinara sauce (The Best Marinara Sauce Yet, which is also from this site), whole wheat lasagna noodles and I used "trim" cottage cheese instead of ricotta only because a)we don't care for ricotta and b)I'm quite cheap. My egg white was from an organic egg. I had a few bites but my family inhaled the rest....even my littlest who LOVES lasagna. He couldn't tell there was zucchini in it!!! No leftovers. None. I'm low on money so I served this with homemade cornbread but next time, I'll be sure to serve this with garlic bread to sop up some of the sauce from the plate. I'll for sure make this again. I'm impressed.

This was excellent! Will definitely make this again! I added onion and garlic (because I nearly always do) and I had a bunch of cherry tomatoes that really needed to be used up so I added them quartered, but they didn't alter the taste much. I used sweet italian sausage, removed the casings. It really tasted great, we all loved it. Thanks jennkl!

Delicious!  I made a couple substitutions based on what I had on hand- no ricotta so used cream cheese(not a perfect substitute but it's still tasty- cottage cheese would be a better sub), lower fat mozzarella and sausage,  organic pasta sauce (lower sodium) and whole wheat noodles. I also added garlic to the sausage/zucchini.  If it was this good with the healthier substitutions I bet the original recipe is to die for!

I made a large pan of this last week for family and was a big hit. The only thing different was that I added more sauce (I don't like dry lasagna) for when I reheated it later....I love left overs. First of all the flavor is excellent and when you reheated it, it tasted even better. It is a very filling and satisfying dish, which is great for the cooler weather coming.

Loved it! The kids had no idea there was zucchini in it, and they ate their entire servings (even the picky kid). It doesn't happen often so THANK you :)

Really Yummy! I used ground Turkey and diced up onion and minced garlic. I substituted low fat cottage cheese for the ricotta. I used a whole egg.

I made it exactly as written, it was very good and filling.  I'll probably add some onion and maybe some green chili to it next time just to add some kick

Delicious! I used ground chuck and spiced it up instead of using sausage. It was very good, but will use spicy sausage next time :)

Delicious! My husband never wants to eat lasagna with ground beef ever again.  I use extra spaghetti sauce; probably 1 1/2 cups each layer instead of one cup; and I used an Italian cheese blend for the top (romano, parmesan, asiago, mozz) to make it extra cheesy. Yum, thanks Jen!

I made a few changes, but sooo good!!! I used ground turkey instead of pork sausage and added minced garlic, paprika, thyme, rosemary, and pepper to make it taste more sausagey. I used chicken broth instead of oil. However, I probably didn't need anything extra due to the amount of moisture already in ground turkey. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I only had the lasagna noodles that you boil first, so I used those. I used Classico's Spicy Tomato Basil spaghetti sauce and I added extra mozzarella on  the top of the lasagna along with the parmesan. Since the noodles were already cooked it only needed to be in the oven for 20 minutes. I will make this again and again!

I used 1/2 hot and 1/2 mild sausage, added one more zucchini and a chopped onion.  I skipped the egg white in the cheese mixture.  I really liked the added flavor/texture from the zucchini!

This is definitely one recipe that's going in our regular rotation.  I've tried other recipes that contained veggies, but this one was super easy to prepare and even my pickiest 5 year old son liked it.  (even though at first he claimed he didn't, but he polished it off eventually)  My 3 year old said this was "tasty!"  I used a premium pork sausage from Aldi.  I also used a tomato basil spaghetti sauce.  Overall, the flavor was seasoned enough I didn't really have to add any more salt or garlic.  Next time I'm gonna try the low fat ricotta if I can find it.  If not, this recipe is fine just the way it is.

Used pepper jack cheese in place of ricotta and tossed in a blend of colored bell peppers. Sausage adds a nice touch.

I loved this!  I have been in the mood for lasagna for a while now but don't add meat to mine.  Hubby likes his with meat and I thought sausage would be nice for something different.  We all inhaled it.  Thanks!

Loved this! Came out great! I used turkey instead of the sausage and added green chiles for a little kick. I've never made lasagna before and had no idea what I was doing - haha - but I followed the recipe and it was a success!

Fantastic! I'm not sure what "no-boil lasagna noodles" are so I used regular and cooked them first. Wonderful meal. Loved by all including 2 kids.

I love the ease of this recipe and the flavor is spectacular.  You can mix it up to go low fat or not. I choose not and use 2 cups total of mozzarella.  I don't mix it in with the ricotta, but layer it on top of the sauce. At the end a cup of mozzarella goes on top with the Parmesan. I also use the whole egg. I think the key to this recipe is the moisture from the zucchini helps to cook the noodles.

So yummy! I adjusted by adding one red bell pepper vs two zuchinnis. I also added a bit of marinara sauce with water to veggie/sausage mix. 

My hubby totally dug this lasagna.

This was really good. I think I would shred the zucchini next time, but there will definitely will be a next time for this recipe.

This is very good!!  Really easy as written, delicious and filling.  I make adjustments and modify it sometimes when I feel up to playing in the kitchen longer, and I can't ruin it.  :). I add sautéed mushrooms and onions, and olives,
Or make another layer.  I like to save left over roasts, pork and beef, and shred those and throw them in too.  Add jarred red peppers sometimes.  But when I'm low on energy or time, this recipe rocks, as it is!  Try it. You'll love it.

Yum yum yum!! This recipe is great as is, but I added mushrooms, onions and spinach because I had it on hand and wanted to sneak a little more veggies into it. My 4 year old LOVED it and asked for seconds!

This is good because it has Italian sausage as opposed to ground meat.  It's not spectacular.  Don't get me wrong, it's lasagna and lasagna is yummy BUT I gave it four stars because if you're looking for a knock your socks off lasagna, you may be disappointed like I was.  The 5 stars reviews are misleading.  I almost gave it 3 stars, but thought that was being a little too tough on it.

My zucchini went crazy in the garden this year, so I made 4 of these at one time, and oh my goodness I can't stop eating it!! I substituted turkey as well, browned onions and garlic in the oil prior to putting in the turkey and zucchini, and covered everything in Italian season and salt and pepper. So delicious I have already had requests for more so people can freeze it!

Love this. I have made it several times, using Italian sausage like a reviewer suggested.

Made this tonight and it was excellent.  I followed it to the letter.  Next time I would make it with half ground beef & half sausage, and hald cottage cheese half ricotta only because I'd like to make it healthier.  Would also add garlic next time but honestly it tasted great without it.

Fantastic!  I like a full-flavored dish, and thought it might need more spices, etc, but I was wrong, it's perfect the way it is!  I also thought it would taste just like lasagna, but it has a different flavor and is lighter, which is nice.  A real keeper.
The only change is that, instead of a 9X13  pan, I made 2-8X8 dishes, and it worked perfectly. I'm going to try freezing one of them next time.  Great recipe!

Delicious!  Used up the surplus of zucchini from the garden and my husband said it was the best lasagna he's ever had!
