Very delicious.  I used a 10 inch pan so the brownie layer wouldn't be too thick.  I added extra mini-chips to the batter (tossed with a bit of flour to keep them from sinking to the bottom) and made a glaze with chocolate chips and milk for the top.  Yummo!

I had to make 10 cheesecakes for a wedding, and this was one of the recipes I used. I coated the chocolate chips in flour, before adding, so they wouldn't all sink to the bottom. It was a huge hit!

Really good!!!!  I didn't make mine a choco chip cheesecake though... i did buy ghirradeli dark choco chips and i put them on top of the baked brownie. then i put raspberry swirls into the cheesecake and also whole raspberries.  I thought the brownie had been cooked too long but it was perfect after cooking the cheesecake.  I put a pan of water on a different shelf in the oven with it.  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I used a 9x13 baking pan and drizzled chocolate syrup on the top for a garnish. It was very, very rich but everyone loved it! My daughter who does not like regular cheesecake said it was great. The brownie bottom is a good addition for picky kids.

About my 5th attempt at cheesecake & I finally got it right! At the suggestions of other reviewers I: 1) baked the brownie for 25 minutes, 2) placed a dish of water on the second shelf while baking the cheesecake, & 3) when my 50 mins. were up, I turned the oven off, opened the door and let my cheesecake set for 30 minutes gradually cooling down. Cooled and additional 30 min out of the oven & refridgerated. What an awesome birthday breakfast treat for my cheesecake obsessed husband!

This cheesecake is so good but I had to bake it much longer than it said to, Almost a half hour longer.

This was my first cheesecake, and it turned out perfect the first time! I didn't even have to try! I didn't have springform pan, so I used an 8x8 square brownie pan, and just cut squares. I took out about 1/2 cup of the brownie batter so the crust wouldn't be too thick. No one can get enough of this desert!

This is a very good and very easy cheesecake recipe. The only change I made was to melt some chocolate and drop/swirl  on top. This recipe is very rich so cut very small pieces.

The combination of the brownie and cheesecake works really well together and very easy to prepare.  I jotted down the recipe ingredients quick and didn't realize until late in the evening when I was putting it together that the topping shown in the picture is not included in the recipe.  I was very disappointed in this - wish I had known, I would have also picked up some sour cream for a topping.  Luckily I did have some unsweetened chocolate in the cabinet and the box it came in has a simple recipe for chocolate frosting.  I did this and then added more chocolate chips - looks great.

I didn't have much faith in my cheesecake making ability. And, I know it may be a shocker I've never been a fan of cheesecake.  But, after successfully making this, serving to a wild crowd of computer geeks, and tasting it I have been converted.  I did about a half cup less of brownie mix and it was perfect!! I will proudly make this again.

USE A BROWNIE MIX FOR AN 8x8 INCH PAN!!!  So many reviews were saying that the brownie mix was way too much and ended up really thick.  Some people even used only half the brownie mix.  My guess would be that they used a box mix for a 9x13 pan instead of a mix for an 8x8 pan.  I used the Pillsbury fudgy brownie mix for an 8x8 in my 9 inch spring form pan and it fit perfectly.  I did cook it about 7 minutes shorter then called for and when it came out of the oven I flatened it a bit with a spatula before pouring on the cheesecake batter.  It ended up the perfect size crust!  This is a wonderful cheesecake but I can see it would be way to much brownie and too sweet with a thick crust so look the boxes over to make sure your buying the small one!  Hope this tip helps!

This is great. I made with an 8x8 size brownie mix and it was perfect for the crust. The only change I made was to mix the choc chips with about 1/4 cup of flour first.. it keeps them from just sinking to the bottom.

I've made this recipe 5 times and it's always a huge hit! I cut the cooking time to 45 min. and I turn off the oven and let it sit with the door cracked for half an hour. This cuts down on the cracking. If there is cracking it looks very pretty drizzled with some melted chocolate chips.

To Make These Mini:
Recipe will make more than 24 muffin sized cakes, I just put the rest of the brownie mix in a pie pan and add the surplus cheesecake mix to it as directed. Bakes for less time obviously.  The main trick to getting these to work as mini's is to use a small cookie scoop to divide the brownie batter into muffin tins, use less than you think you need. They'll bake up with a dome in the middle, so take a spoon and carefully remove the dome making a little well in the centers. You should have roughly half cheesecake that way if you fill the cheesecake batter nearly to the top of the tins. Other than making them muffin sized and baking for less time  I follow the instructions for the recipe as given with excellent results.
9/2/2012 Made these again today, the yield was 24 mini muffin sizes, a dozen regular sized muffins and a regular loaf pan about half filled. 
Another tip, turn the temp down 25 more degrees, it gives you a longer window of time to pull them out while the cheesecake is not yet cracked and still really moist. And especially if you're winging it with several different sizes and having to guess and check! lol

I LOVE cheesecake and this is one of the BEST and easiest cheescakes I have ever baked. The combination of the brownie and cheesecake was so incredible!! I took the advice of the other reviewers and used Ghirardeli triple brownie mix with the chocolate chips. I accidently baked the brownie on 325 instead of 350 for 35 mins and it came out perfect. I also baked the cheesecake with a pan of water for 50 mins and left it in the oven with the door cracked for an hour afterwards. It came perfect - no cracks!!! I baked this 2 days before Thanksgiving as other reviews suggested.  I will definitely make this for every occasion.

I was surprised that this recipe got a 5 star review as this was not edible. We had visitors in town, one of which was my dad, the biggest sweet eater I know (other than myself), and neither of us could stomach it. I would say maybe it was just me, but I made the Chocolate Cookie Cheesecake first and it turned out excellent. I think the ingredients on this one was to blame; where's the sugar? None of these ingredients sweeten the cheesecake enough to call it a dessert; it was more just like cooked cream cheese.

Really good!  This was my first attempt at cheesecake, and it came out great.  I used Duncan Hines brownie mix and generic condensed milk.  Instead of mixing the chocolate chips in the batter, I just sprinkled them over the top before putting it in the oven.

This is a very easy cheesecake to make; no water bath is needed.  The brownie layer is fudgy and the cheesecake layer is creamy and smooth.  If you have never made a cheesecake before this would be a great one to start with.  I recommend using a brownie mix for a 8x8 pan as I thought the brownie layer was a little too thick.

I never rate things, but this?  This I had to.  Decided to make cheesecake the other evening as it's the one dessert my husband actually likes.  Wanted a different way to do it, but everything was so time consuming and difficult.  This recipe was perfect!  Quick, easy and the most amazing cheesecake I've ever made!  Everyone that has tried it (it made a lot! so I've been sharing) has fallen in love with it.  I did follow others advice and used Ghiradelli brownie mix.  Cooked the brownies for 35 minutes in a 9" round pan, let them cool completely before putting the cheesecake mixture in.  Cooked that for 50 minutes with a pan of water underneath it, and then cracked the oven door for an hour and let it sit.  Turned out perfect.  No cracks, nothing.  Let sit in the fridge for twenty four hours, then drizzled melted white and dark chocolate on it.  Yum!  And everyone loves the brownie crust.  I'll be making this again and again.

WOW!!!  I have never made any kind of cheesecake and i was a little worried that I was gonna mess it up, but I did just what the recipe said and it came out GREAT!!! I did leave out about 1/2 cup of the brownie mix and then after the brownie was cooked I pushed it all down in the pan too make extra room form the cheesecake part and it worked out nice.  Anyways big hit and my sweets and mom loved it.

My family loved this recipe! I made it this year for Christmas and everyone thought it had to be bought from the Cheesecake Factory because it was that good! I used a chocolate glaze to swirl on the top and sprinkled chocolate chips on top of that. Wonderful! I will make this again and again!

Easy and very tasty. I added chopped pecans to the brownie mix. Drizzled it with caramel sauce once baked, added the cheesecake topping. Then decorated it with more chopped pecans, chocolate sauce and caramel sauce once done. I called it turtle cheesecake and it was very good!

Absolutely wonderful! I made the crust a little bit thinner, and only used about 2/3 of the batter. I cooked the extra batter in a small pan, then I mixed some crumbled brownie into the batter, and sprinkled the remaining brownie on top. This made it pretty rich, but very delicious!

WOW!!!  This was amazing!  i've never made cheesecake before and it came out perfectly!  My sister-in-law said that it was possibly the best cheesecake she had ever had.  I added peanut butter chips to the top, and may add some caramel sauce next time as well.

Not bad! Very easy to make, and was pretty good for a homemade cheesecake. Probably better if I had used a different brownie batter, little plain. Does anyone find it weird that you bake the brownie's twice? I thought they were going to burn, but having faith in the recipe they didn't burn.

I made this for the first time for my stepson's birthday, everybody loved it!   I did coat the chips in flour as suggested which kept the chips from going to the bottom of the cake, and also put a pan of water in the oven as I cooked it.  It turned out beautifully, no cracks, looked like I had bought it at a bakery!  This definitely deserves 5 stars!  Thanks for a great cheesecake recipe!

i left out the chocolate chips, and this is phenomenal. i baked the brownies less than the suggested time because i thought it would be way too hard by the time it was finished, but that was not the case. it turned out gooey instead, so next time i'll follow the directions!

Good but it could be better. I had a 10" spring pan (good thing because the filling wouldn't have fit), so I used the whole brownie mix. Also used Ghiradheli double chocolate brownie mix based on the reviews, baked it at 325 for 20 minutes (next time I'll use my favorite browine mix and will prob bake 15 min). Wish I knew what is on top of the cream cheese in the picture. I left out the choc chips in the cream cheese fillling and instead put them on top of the cheesecake after baking. This is VERY RICH and although my family did like it (especially my grandkids), I think it needs more tweeking. I will prob make it again but will change a few more things.

Awesome recipe! The only thing I changed was I made the brownies from scratch and only used half the batter. I also used regular chocolate chips instead of mini, dusting them in flour so they don't sink to the bottom.

I have used this recipe for years.  It is great!!  I really love it.  I bake my brownies just until they are set which for my oven is about 20 minutes. I follow the recipe exactly.  The cheese cake part of the recipe is great on its own with a gram cracker crust or with a strawberry swirl. Yum!!

This is soooo good!! Couple of things I did different just because I didn't have all ingredients. I replaced the sweetened condensed milk with 1/4 c flour and 3/4 c sugar, and I only had 2 1/2 pkgs of cream cheese so I added a 1/2 c of sour cream to make up the difference. Based on other reviews, I took out 1/2 c of brownie mixture for the crust. Can not believe how good the brownie crust is. Not hard at all, but soooo moist and yummy!! May be my new cheesecake recipe.

I have made this recipe about 15 times, and this is what I have found.  Only use Philadelphia cream cheese.  Never use western family, great value, or Kroger.  There is a huge difference.  If you find that your cheesecake has cracks in the top, it is because you are not allowing it to cool at room temperature for long enough.  I always add 2 cups of mini chocolate chips.  1/2 cup is just not enough.  You can either make the whole cheesecake in one sitting, or you can make the brownie crust a day ahead of time.  It makes no difference.  It has no need for whipped cream, chocolate syrup, etc.  I usually have to bake my cheesecake for more like 1hr and 10min.  I wait until I can see little brown areas on the surface.  I have under cooked this plenty of times, and if there are not brown spots, it is undercooked.  When in doubt, leave it in the oven!  This is an expensive cheesecake, and you don't want to waste all those ingredients.

This was my first cheesecake and it was GREAT! Everyone loved it. I do have a few suggestions: In order to make it more of a cheesecake, only spread half of the brownie batter on the bottom of the pan. The brownie layer was thick and took away from the actual cheesecake. Second, in order to prevent the cheesecake from cracking I placed a small glass bake dish with a cup and a half of water in the oven when baking the cheesecake. This added moisture. Will bake again!!!

This recipe was ok. Very creamy cheesecake. I didn't actually use chocolate chips. I reserved some of the brownie battr to make a seperate batch of brownies that I cubed and coated with flour, and added to the cheesecake batter. I then swirled choc. syrup on top and mad a marble pattern before baking. Not a bad recipe at all.

First off i would like to say this is my first cheese cake. (Ever) So i made this last night for my Elders. Here at work we do not have spring form pans so i used two cake pans and divided and conquored. I also didnt want this to be too sweet and rich like most cheese cakes. My people are mostly diabetic. SoooOooo i used a little less cream cheese and a little less sweetened condensed milk. It turned out very well. I was able to get 16 servings by dividing it the way i did. It was a huge hit. I cut my slices and added a dolop of whipp cream and drizzled a little chocolate syrup over it. Tasty!!!

Didn't get a chance to taste, fellow employees ate it all. Everyone asked for the receipe, several claimed that it was the best cheesecake ever. I used only 3/4 of the brownie mix. The cheesecake stuck a little on the side of the pan, next time I/ll grease sides.

Just a little tip. If you don't want the chocolate chips to sink to the bottom and want them to be visible throughout the cream cheese layer, toss them in a bit of flour or cornstarch before folding into the batter!!!

I am actually baking this again as I type! I don't have a cheesecake pan so I use a 8x8 and I set aside a little over 1/2 a cup the brownie batter so my pan won't overflow and when the cheesecake is about done I drizzle some of the remaining batter and some chocolate chips on the top and it looks amazing finished and is in all honesty the best cheesecake I have ever had!

I put it in a 10in pan, decreased the baking time of the brownie crust by about ten min, cooked until the  edges were firm and center still had a little jiggle to the center, cooled and chilled overnight. PERFECT! a keeper for sure

Wonderful! I had to modify to make it gluten free. I used a brownie recipe from Gluten Free Goddess site. I cooked the brownies til almost done in a 8x8 pan and put them in the spring form pan hot and used the bottom of a glass to tamp it down some. Reason was the batter was a bit thin for the springform and I felt it might seep down. This did not make the crust too dry, it was perfect, since the brownies were quite moist when I put them in. Also I used a spoonful of cornstarch to coat the chips before putting them in so they would not sink. Could not help myself, used 1 c of chips.  Also the brownies had walnuts in it.  Rave reviews ate the dinner party.

Excellent cheesecake recipe!  I've made this on three occasions and it is so easy and delicious!  I used another brand of condensed milk but kept everything else the same.  Can't wait to find another reason to make it again ....

This was really good.  I made a few changes though.  I made the brownies from scratch & I didn't add the chocolate chips to the cheesecake filling. I used cool whip & shaved chocolate as garnish.  I was concerned at 1st that the filling wasn't sweet enough but when it all came together it was perfect.  My family & friends really enjoyed & I will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Amazing! The first time I made it with the regular brownie mix, it was good. The second time I made it, I used a dark chocolate brownie mix and it was incredible! Super rich & delicious. A tip so it doesn't crack is to put it in a water bath & then let it sit in the oven with the door closed for an hour after it's done. No cracks!! I also did not cook the brownie for the whole time. I pulled it after 28 minutes and the result was perfection. Very fudge like, which is what my family likes. If you prefer it more crust like I guess you could bake it for the full 35 minutes.

My wife asked what desert I wanted for Father's Day, & I picked this. OMG, this thing is SO good. She made it in a 9X13 pan & melted the chocolate chips on top. I seriously have gained 5lbs because of this thing, but it was so worth it. I sure am looking forward to next years Father's Day so I can taste this again.

I made this as written except for using a 10inch springform and tossing the chips in flour first.  It turned out very yummy!!!   I'm glad I used 10inch, the brownie layer was still almost 1/2inch thick.  Plenty!!

I made this wonderful cheesecake and it was a huge hit.  I will definately be making this one again very soon.  I used whipped cream and sprinkled the mini chocolate chips on top.  The brownie layer was moist and the cheese cake layer was perfect.  I don't like my cheesecake tangy, so the flavor and texture was creaming and just sweet enough.  Several people requested the recipe.

It was very good, but a little too sweet for my taste. I think the brownie is what pushed it over the edge.

Delicious and easy!  I made this for Father's Day weekend.  Took other's advice and used Ghiradelli brownie mix (which I normally use when I use a mix).  Better made a day in advance.

I made this for the first time yesterday.  I used Ghiradelli triple chocolate brownie mix for the crust (using a 9-inch springform pan).  I didn't find that the crust was too thick.  I baked it for 35 min. as the recipe stated, but next time I think I'll bake it for only 30 min. since it seemed slightly overbaked.  I floured my chocolate chips, but they still sank to the bottom.  Does anyone know what the trick is for that?  Does it require a lot of flour?  I baked it for 50 min. and even though it was still jiggling, I turned off the oven and opened the door a bit.  I left it like that for about an hour.  I also had a pan filled with hot water on the rack below during baking.  There were no cracks and the baking time was perfect.  It is a very creamy cheesecake.  This time I just sprinkled more chocolate chips on top, but next time I think I'll make a chocoate drizzle for the top.  Overall a very good recipe.

I made this last night using No Fudge Pudge Brownies (trader joes) and low fat philly cream cheese. This was soooooooooooooo good. Defiantly give yourself at least 4 hours for it to set and chill. I tasted it after 3 hrs and it was too creamy, after chilling overnight perfect. Also next time I will leave out the chocolate chips in the batter too rich. I drizzeled a design with chocolate syrup on top and baked. The hubbie loved it, will def make again was super easy and good. Also if u use lowfat ingredients you dont taste the difference at all.

I really loved the texture of this cheesecake. Very dense, not as creamy.  My family likes the creamy better like (Chantals) on this site.  The brownie crust was a bit too hard, however, I believe that was my fault.  As you can see in my picture, it was starting to brown around the edges. I should have taken it out sooner.  All in all, I really liked this and will try to make it again sometime.

Well, this was good - but not what I expected.  It was REALLY sweet, and definitely didn't need the extra chocolate chips in the cheesecake batter - next time I will probably leave them out.  I'm still undecided as to whether the brownie and cheesecake combination worked for me...I didn't love it, but I did like it.  I will probably make this again, but alter it from the original recipe.

Taste was delicious and it would have been extremely easy if it fit in the pan.  I was in a hurry and didn't read the other reviews first like I usually do.  Therefore, my brownie mix rose to fill most of my pan so that I couldn't fit but about 1/4 of the cheesecake mix, and I ended up removing the brownie mix from the pan, greasing the bottom of the pan well and then cooking the cheesecake layer by itself in the same pan.  After I refrigerated the cheesecake layer overnight, I was able to remove it from the pan cleanly, and then put it on top of the brownie layer.  So I had to make each piece separately, but once it was sliced and plated, it was barely noticeable that it was 2 separate pieces.  It was very good, but next time I will use half of the brownie mix, or use the small bag of brownie mix for an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13 pan.

I feel like the texture of this cheesecake was strange. I am attributing it to the condensed milk.

I made this cheesecake in a Dutch oven on a campout (see photo). It was a complete hit. The only changes I made were: using a different brand of brownie mix, mixing the mini chips with a little flour as suggested by another reviewer, and adding a topping of sour cream mixed with a little vanilla and sugar. For anyone interested, here's what I did: I mixed the cheesecake batter at home because I wasn't going to have a mixer at the campground. At camp I made the brownie mix and poured it in the bottom of a 12" Dutch oven (with feet - important!) lined with a parchment paper liner trimmed to fit the oven. I baked the brownie part for about 45 minutes with 7 coals on EACH the bottom and the top. I then let the brownie cool for a little bit while I mixed the flour-coated chips into the cheesecake batter and got some more coals going. I poured the cheesecake batter over the brownie crust and baked that for about an hour (started checking it at about 50 min.), this time with 6 coals on the bottom and 8 or 9 on top. At about 40 minutes I had to add a few more coals to the top (but none to the bottom, as I didn't want the brownie to burn). When the cheesecake was set I removed it from the coals and set it aside to cool with the lid slightly ajar, for about 45 minutes. At that point I put on the sour cream topping, sprinkled the top with more mini chips, and placed the whole (now cool) Dutch oven in a cooler with ice. I let it chill in there for a couple of hours before serving. Voila!

Made this for Easter... It was a HUGE hit!!  I used a Ghiradelli Double Chocolate brownie mix which I pressed down with the bottom of a glass tumbler while it was still warm (it didn't compress much but I think the little bit of space gained was needed).  All other ingredients used were per the given recipe.  I took a few hints from other reviews and coated the chocolate chips with flour before adding.  I also put a bowl of water in the oven a few minutes before adding the cheesecake, baked 50 mins then turned the oven off and propped the oven door open leaving the cheesecake in the oven for another 50-60 mins.  It was PERFECT!!!!  It was easy to make, done perfectly, beautiful and delicious!!!  I did not garnish as my family was too impatient to wait for that once I pulled it out after Easter dinner! Hahaha  Everyone LOVED this and said it is a keeper!!

This was my first baked cheesecake and it was delicious. Thanks to other reviewers for suggesting a pan of water in the oven with it and for coating the chocolate chips in flour to keep them from sinking. I added peanut butter to the brownie mix (didn't really measure but probably about 4 tbsp and used less oil since the peanut butter has plenty of oil in it) and I also made a glaze to drizzle over top by melting about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips with a few tbsp of peanut butter in the microwave. It was so good but very rich so you only need a very small slice.

This was my first cheesecake. I made cheesecake cupcakes and cheesecake bars before, but never the real deal. It turned out great. I did increase the cook time by 15 minutes. This may have been unnecessary, but the middle was just too gooey-looking. Also, I cracked the oven door and left it in there for 30 more, the top cracked a little, but tasted perfect, maybe a tad bit dry; that is probably my fault for altering the cook times. I used more chocolate chips and mixed them with a little flour, and they did not settle at the bottom.  Also, I doubled the chocolate chips and put some on top right before baking.  I used Gihardelli brownies and undercooked them by 10 minutes (28 min) since I was afraid of a super tough crust. This worked out well. I topped it with peanut butter sauce, hot fudge and whipped cream. I'm glad I tried this simple recipe; I'm ready to put my springform pan to use making all kinds of cheesecakes.

Great idea. I think mine would have turned out ok if the water bath hadn't soaked into both the crust and cream cheese. I did the aluminum foil trick which worked in the past, but even with two layers of foil, no such luck tonight. Why, oh why, Cheesecake Gods, hath you forsaken me?

I made this recipe in a 9x13 glass dish with a normal brownie mix and made it exactly as written and it was FABULOUS!!!!!  So easy.  I didn't need a pan of water in the oven.  It didn't crack at all.  It came out perfectly and was absolutely delicious!!!!!  My daughter is already asking me to make it again for Christmas.

I'm not a fan of cheesecake so I really liked the brownie addition. Husband liked it quite a bit. To me there are better cheesecake recipes out there. Thank you.

I fix cheesecakes all the time and this one is super easy and delicious.  A few tips use a 10" springform pan, use a creative brownie mix (not just plain brownies), bake the brownies 5-7 minutes less that way you can bake the cheesecake 5-10 longer and fold the chocolate chips instead of stirring.  I garnished mine with chocolate cool ehip and chocolate chips

I made this cheesecake as directed, only changing the pan.  I used a 10x13 pan so that the brownie crust would be spread out and not too thick, I dusted the mini chips with flour so that they wouldn't sink.  After it cooled, I drizzled the top with chocolate syrup and sprinkled on a couple of handfuls of the leftover mini chocolate chips.  Huge hit in our house.  Delicious!

This is a great cheesecake! Everyone loved it. I was worried about the brownies getting too hard because that seems like a long time for brownies too be in the oven but it turned out perfect! Just be sure to only cook them for 30-35 minutes and not the 45-55 recomended on the back of the brownie box. also cook the whole cheesecake for an extra 15 minutes because 50 minutes isnt long enough. for those that said it wasnt sweet enough or too dry, you did something wrong because its very rich and not the least bit dry.

This is a very easy cheese cake recipe.  Great combination with the brownie bottom, and instead of chocolate chips, I used Reese's peanut butter chips.  I spread the chips on the baked crust then poured the cheesecake batter.  I would only use a half of the brownie batter though, and make a small brownie with the remainder.  In 9" round cake pan, brownie "crust" turned out too thick, so I had to hallow out a lot of it, which we enjoyed by itself.  This way, I can still use the 9" round pan, which gives a beautiful end result, and fit all of the cheesecake batter.  Plus, I will have a small pan of brownie.  I guess I could call this a "two in one" treat recipe!

I have made this recipe over and over again. Having a brownie base actually makes it so much easier to make than making your own cookie crust. I do tweak it just a bit though. I use fat free or low fat cream cheese and usually use a low-fat brownie mix as well. I also add between 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup of sugar after adding the eggs to help with the texture. I have taken it to work potlucks several times and no one would ever guess that it's a low fat version. I never have to worry about leftovers either!

Oh my gosh!  This recipe is not only easy to prepare, it is very rich and oh so good. I just made this for a combined birthday party for one person that wanted brownies and another that wanted a cheese cake.  They both loved it tremendously. They now want this for all their cakes! I prepared this exactly like the original recipe too.

Amazing!! I'm going to cook the brownie mixture in half the time next time because it was a little over done. Then poor the cream cheese mix on top and finish cooking...that way the brownie under is still soft and gooey

I'm not to sure on how to rate this. This was my million't time at attempt to make cheese cake. Every time I've suffered the same results, my cake always comes out grainy, every single time. But this is a good recipe to try, If it had cooked properly this would have been an awesome cake.

Simple and scrumptious! As someone who has only been cooking for a year or two, I had no problem following the recipe and everyone loved it. For an AMAZING variation, first eliminate the chocolate chips. Before putting the cheesecake batter on top of the baked brownie, add a layer of Hershey's chocolate syrup then a layer of crumbled Reese's cups. Pour the batter over the layers and continue following the recipe. For garnish when finished, drizzle more Hershey's syrup on top and crumble more Reese's over that. Best (and richest) dessert I ever made!!!

Family loved this cheese cake and begged to take leftovers home. Personally, I thought it was a little dry.  I made a raspberry sauce to go with it and it saved the day.

I made this yesterday for Easter and....wow! It came out absolutely perfect and tastes great! I'm sure it'll get rave reviews today. The only change I have to mention is it took longer than 50 minutes to bake. More like 90. The edges were done at 50 minutes but the middle was still soupy. 90 minutes had it completely done and after cooling it in the fridge and tasting it, my husband said how good it was and my daughter loved it. Amazing recipe!

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!!  I made this as a request for my 10 year olds birthday.  The only change I made was I topped it with homemade whipped cream.  It was delish and my 10 year old requested this for next year!

I tried following recipe but had a few problems--not recipe's fault.  I had a rare bad baking day.  Didn't affect the RAVE reviews I received for the cheesecake, and the untraditional brownie bottom.  Brownie batter leaked out of springform pan (my fault) so had to clean it & oven.  Transfered brownie batter into pie plate and baked it in that. Scooped out some of finished brownie to make room for cheesecake batter & to look more like brownie pie shell. Overbaked the cheesecake--my fault/3 yr old distracted me.  Also baked with pan of water on lower shelf in oven, leaving oven door open 1 hr after it baked.  Had trouble cutting/serving into presentable slices at first. I should have served with a can of pie filling to help with the overbaked part and hard to slice pieces but no one cared.  Plates were empty and no cheesecake was left.  I used regular size semi sweet choc chips because I didn't have mini's on hand.  I'm only writing review so that others will know that in a pinch, a pie plate can be used.  And even though it was overbaked, ordinary people who love cheesecake didn't mind--after all, it wasn't a boxed version & homemade is always better. I do plan to make this recipe again.  I'm curious to see how mini or individual cupcake pan size cakes will be.  Maybe will try a pan of cheesecake squares (cookie sheet size) during the holidays.  I think this recipe is versatile, so don't be afraid to experiment with pans if you don't have springform pan.

Great recipe.  I made it for my niece as a bithday present.  The only thing I did different was to put all the chocolate chips on top of the cheesecake and then cut them in gently with a knife to help keep them from all sinking to the bottom instead of mixing them in the batter.  This did help to have them distributed through the cheesecake.

So good!  I followed the recipe exactly, put cool whip and mini choc. chips on top, like the picture.  I used the other reviewers suggestions and baked for 50 min. and then left the cheesecake in the oven with the door cracked for an hour longer. I chilled it for about 5 hrs. but it was definately better the next day. So I would suggest making it the day before, and letting it chill overnight.  Very good though!

I was skeptical about the condensed milk; however, it turned out nicely.  You do need to bake it a lot longer; I baked mine for about 1 hour and 20 min.  I have made this twice; both times were for special occasions and everyone gave it rave reviews.  I highly suggest using Gheridelli brownie mix instead of the Pillsbury; you may also sub the reg chocolate chips with higher quality chocolate.  Coat the chips with flour to prevent them from sinking.  I topped one with cherry pie filling, the other time I left it plain.  Excellent!

Fantastic! I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and 1/3 fat cream cheese and it turned out PERFECT. To cut back on fat/calories, next time I might try a chocolate graham cracker crust. I did as the others suggested and baked it with a pan of water in the oven and then let it set/cool in the oven for 4 hrs before chilling in the frig over night.

Made as directed... yummy!  As others suggested, I used a water bath & left in oven to cool for an hour before putting it in the fridge.  Served with whipped cream, garnished with choc shavings.

I used regular chocolate chips that I tossed in a little flour to ensure they would not sink to the bottom.  Everyone really enjoyed this.

This was my 1st attempt at a cheesecake. it was awesome, everyone loved it.  i was very impressed with myself...lol
i used the 9X13 brownie mix and made brownie muffins with the extra mix.  i cooked the cheesecake for 50 minutes with a bowl of water on the bottom rack, then turned the oven off and opened the door, let it sit in the oven for 30 minutes then let it cool off for about 2 hrs before putting in fridge.  had no cracks at all. i will be making this again soon.  i topped the outer circle with chips and served cherry pie filling and whipped cream on the side.

This recipe was very good.  I used a dark chocolate brownie mix, yummy.  The "cheesecake" component was very creamy and flavorful.  I will not add the chocolate chips next time.  Even though I coated them in flour, they still "sunk" to the bottom of the cream cheese "layer".  So there was a top layer of cheesecake, a middle layer of choc chips and a base layer of brownie.  Truly too much chocolate - and I didn't think there was such a thing!!!  Will use again. Thanks!

This cheesecake was very good and easy to make!  After reading some of the reviews, I did not use the entire amount of brownie batter for a 9 inch pan (I made mini "muffin" browines with the remaining batter) and I was glad I did.  I would say I used a little over half of the batter.  The only other thing I did differently was that I tossed the mini chocolate chips with a little flour.  I also read that people baked it longer..some as much as 20 minutes!   I only left mine in an additional 5 minutes.  I turned the oven off and left the oven door ajar and let the cheesecake cool/setup in the oven.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This cheesecake is delicious! I followed the directions without any changes. I topped the finished cake with a sensible layer of Cool Whip before sprinkling with extra mini chocolate chips. It was beautiful on a serving plate and I got only great compliments on its taste! Will definitely make this one again. Thanks!

Since the recipe doesnt include the topping seen in the picture i just took a guess and used some coolwhip and topped it with the mini chips! YUMMM! 5 STARS!!!

Delicious.  You don't need flour to keep the chocolate chips afloat in the cake.  The only thing that I did notcie was that it needed to be cooked a little longer.  This is a definite keeper.

I went home for Thanksgiving and forgot my springform pan.  I made this in a 9x13 and it turned out awesome.  I reduced the baking time for the cheesecake by about 10 minutes, and I didn't have a super thick layer of brownie.  It was enjoyed by all.  Great recipe!

Great recipe! Pretty much followed it to a T, but floured the choco chips as several recommended so they wouldn't sink. I did have to cook the cake a little longer then the recipe suggested. The sweetened condensed milk adds lots of sweetness to it, which is why sugar isn't an ingredient in this recipe. Had no problems with the cake cracking and did not use a water bath.

Made by my 10 year old daughter.  A few instructions are lacking that would have helped:  1) state in parentheses "not family size" when listing brownie mix.  I realize it states size by ounces but based on reviews, she's not the only one who missed that.  2) somewhere state that the "prepared pan" includes the brownie in it.  3) if there is frosting in the picture, include in the recipe.  She was a bit disappointed.  It did turn out to be a fun family dessert and a teaching moment of why we practice recipes prior to inviting guests, which we will do next time.  Thank you.

Followed recipe exactly at written. It was just OK, didn't have any wow factor like a cheesecake should. Wasn't bad, just not worth making again. There are a lot of better ones out there.

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake. It was absolutely amazing. Very rich yet tasty. I tossed the chocolate chips in flour as recommended by other reviews. My mother in law even said this tops any dessert she's ever made. Thanks for making me look like a great baker!

I made this for a work gathering and it turned out fabulous. I read a lot of the prior reviews and made a few personal modifications. I used a19.5 ounce Guiradelli brownie mix and mixed per package instructions baking for 25 minutes in a square springform pan. I baked the entire cheesecake at 300 degrees for 45 minutes then I turned off the oven and opened the door letting it cool there for 30 minutes. I let it cool on my counter for 30-60 minutes more. I decided last minute to top it with a chocolate ganache. 2/3 of a cup of heavy cream heated to simmer on low heat. Mix in 8oz. Of chopped bittersweet chocolate plus about a table sppon of mini milk chocolate chips. Stir chocolate and cream until the chocolate is melted. Turn off heat and stir in 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter and 2 tablespoons of the liqueur of your choice. I used Jameson Whiskey this time and maybe I used a little more then 2 tablespoons. Allow butter to melt and let cool to room temp. Pour over cooling cheesecake and let cool overnight until ready to serve. I will definitely make this again.

I've been making cheesecakes for a long while, but this has got to be the best ever. So smooth and fluffy....delicious. Gave it for a birthday gift to my son's girlfriend, and she said it was the best cheesecake she had ever tasted.
Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe exactly, and the brownie part was hard as a rock and totally not edible.  I ended up cutting off the bottom. The cheesecake part was fine.  Next time I would save the time and money and use a regular crust.

the best cheesecake i've ever made!! it was easy, didn't crack or fall, and everyone gobbled it up! the fudge brownie crust made for a rich and creamy dessert that no one had seen before, and they couldnt believe it was homemade!

Delicious!  Made this for a pot luck and everyone loved it.  I used about 2/3 the brownie mix and it was still too thick (in my opinion).  Next time I'll use half the mixture and bake the other half in a small pan.

I followed the recipe step-by-step and it did not turn out well at all. The brownie crust ended up being too hard, making it difficult to cut and eat. The cheesecake layer also doesn't stick to the brownie layer, it's like eating two separate desserts. The taste isn't bad though, which matters the most. I'm going to have to try and cook it again to see what might have went wrong.

Great!  Loved it!  Only suggestion - would decrease the amount of the brownie mix -- or use a larger springform pan.  I also frosted with a cream cheese/whipped cream topping.  Yum!

I made this for Easter Dinner. My family loved this cheesecake! They thought the filling was very delicious. I liked it, too. But the next time I make it, which will probably be soon, I will use a smaller brownie mix, as the crust was very thick for my springform pan.

Beautiful and Easy! Was a huge hit. Followed the recipe and it was a success! Thanks for this one! I used a water bath per other reviewers. I believe that helped and I left it in the turned off oven (per other AR suggestions) and I was really proud of this!

I really wanted to love this cheesecake, but it wasn't to be.  I like a dense NY style cheesecake and it was more of a "fluffy" cheesecake.  I also don't think the flavors of the cheesecake and brownie worked together very well.

AWESOME!!!  I've always been intimidated by chesecakes ... no more, this was so easy. I undercooked the brownie but it still turned out great. Great tidbit on flouring the chocolate chips to keep from sinking to the bottom..worked like a charm.

I had to burn the brownie base just to get the cheesecake cooked. It was thick and the flavor wasn't great. Not a wonderful recipe. I won't be making it again.

ok I made this & rate it as Very Yummy! & Very Easy! Note: the recipe does not include instructions for the topping shown here. I just sprinkled the remainder of the chips on top and it was fine but didn't look as nice as this picture.

I did not think the cheesecake part of this recipe was good at all, it was heavy and not very tasty, I think it calls for too much cream cheese and should have sour cream or some other ingredient in it.

I really enjoyed this....of course i had the mini version..to me that was probably the right portion size for the layers..i dont know...but it was good.  The oppisite of what i thought it would taste like...it had a mellow taste...i thought it would be rich tasting with all that fudge and cream cheese...but no i was wrong...im glad i tried this one out. THANK YOU FOR SHARING :)

Excellent recipe, but I was confused as to whether you should let the brownie layer cool completely before adding the cream cheese layer. I did let it cool, and when I served it the brownie layer was almost like an oreo cookie. I don't know if that is the way it normally is, but it was delicious none the less.

Everytime I make this it's a bit hit. Sometimes the top comes out picture perfect, sometimes it needs a chocolate cover-up job, either way it's very yummy as is. I rarely use the Pillsbury brownies though, I usually just go for whatever looks appealing in the baking aisle.

Very easy to make &  excellent flavor.  I use a Duncan Hines dark chocolate fudge brownie mix & 2 pie tins but ended up tossing out enough filling for a third pie.  I didn't have mini chips so I left them out & drizzled the top with melted semi sweet chocolate chips.

Very good!!! I used the Ghiradelli triple chocolate brownie mix.  I topped it with sweetened whipped cream with a Ghiradelli Bittersweet ganache on top! I tossed my chocolate chips in flour but they still sank. I think that since I used the above mentioned brownie mix (that contains chips) I won't add them the next time!

Absolutely amazing. I loved the thickness of the crust. Baking the brownie fully works great, cause then some of the liquid from the cheesecake part seeps down and makes it really moist and fudge-y. My whole family loved it! It does make a really thick, rich cheesecake.

This is some really good cheesecake!  It disappeared from our firdge in about 24 hours! Scarry!!  The best thing about it is how easy it is!  I think the brownie crust was too thick (next time I'll use 1/2 the mix) and add some chocolate chips to the crust to make it gooey.  I didn't think the chocolate chips added much to the cheesecake part.  I want to add some melted caramel next time too.

This is easy and delicious, and simply amazing! I used Ghirardelli brownies and did take the 1/2 cup out, floured the chocolate chips, did the cool whip topping. It turned out perfect. I got so many compliments and have to hand out this recipe to numerous people.

DELICIOUS!!!  I made this for a CubScout PotLuck so I used a 13x9.  Baked the Brownie until set (not quite all the way cooked,) poured the filling over Brownie,  baked for 45 min, Chilled well overnight, froze for 30 min before cutting.  Excellent, easy, will make again and again.

The best! For the brownie I used the Giraldi Brownie mix from Costco. Once cool I drizzle the top of the cheesecake with chocolate fudge Decandant !!! Everyone at work LOVED it!

Very easy to make, came out perfectly. I didn't use the full amount of brownie batter, like some previous reviewers. Gave me the right amount of crust to cheesecake ratio. Also dusted the chocolate chips with flour so they didn't sink in the batter. Got rave reviews!

The perfect cheesecake, no topings needed.  I used a 10oz package of brownie mix, and regular chocolate chips that I put in my food chopper (because I did not have the mini) and it turned out perfect.  I like the cocolate chips chopped up small, they did not sink to the bottom of the cheese cake.  I cooked it for an hour and then cracked the door because my oven has a standing pilot.  After four hours I took it out of the oven and ran a knife along the edges of the pan and chilled it overnight in the frig.  It was great, my family loved it.  My first cheesecake that did not crack yeah!!!!!  I will be making this again.

Came out great, I changed the recipe to add a crust around the cheesecake made of crushed oreos and butter. The recipe actually took about 1 hour and 20 minutes for it to cook through for me.

This is a great cheesecake.  I make it gluten free by using betty crocker's brownie mix.  I also don't add the chocolate chips. It is perfect without them.

This was awesome! It was the first cheesecake I have ever made and it turned out perfect. All I got were good reviews. Instead of the traditional brownie mix I used the Ghirardelli brownie mix that had the chocolate chips already in it and I didn't add any to the cheesecake batter. I will definately make this again!!

This is a keeper recipe.  Make sure your brownies are fully cooked before you add the cheesecake.  Mine was a little under done and I figured it would finish cooking during the time the cheesecake cooked.  I was wrong!!  My brownie didn't cook any further, so it was a little under done.  With that being said I left the chocolate chips out of the cheesecake mixture and instead sprinkled them on top.  Everyone said it was DELICIOUS and looked like it was from a professional bakery!

This cheesecake was a huge hit for Christmas. No one wanted the other pies! I used a Ghirardelli brownie mix with a fudge packet in it that I put on top of the cake. I also used the water bath while baking as recommeded by others. This was so much easier than the other cheesecakes that I have done before that I will never go back to the old ones!!

This should be titled "Best Ever Brownie Chocolate Chip Cheesecake"!  My son requests this at least once a month, if not more.  I would love to know what the topping is on the submitted picture, though.

Great recipe! This was my first cheesecake.
I followed the recipe exactly, with a water bath, and my cheesecake turned out wonderfully. I coated the outside edge of the cheesecake with fudge frosting and mini chocolate chips for extra flavour and to hide my cracking sides (we all have our tricks).

I never knew cheesecake could be so easy to make. The brownie bottom made it extra easy, and it was soooo delicious. I left out the choco chips, and added caramel sundae topping for the finish. It was a perfect complement to the cheesecake. Will make this again.

This was awesome! The brownie crust is such a good idea and compliments the cheesecake very well. I used a 10 inch springform pan and used all the brownie mix and cheesecake mix and the cake turned out perfect! No need to cut back on either. I covered the cheesecake, after cooled, with chocolate covered strawberrys and drizzled the cake with chocolate sauce. Which is just melted chocolate chips with whipping cream. The strawberrys really complimented the chocolate flavors very well. Awesome recipe, YUM!

I love brownies and cheesecake, so I figured together they would be awesome.  This was pretty good, I even swirled in some melted raspberry preserves.  Next time I will probably just stick to a graham crust.

The best cheesecake ever! I had to cook the cheesecake layer an extra 20 minutes... I also added cream cheese icing on top and more mini chocolate chips. It went fast and I got tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. Will definately make again.

i really liked this recipe. it took a bit long, but then again, doesn't all cheesecake? i was a bit cautious about the brownie mix because it tends to make dry brownies but it turned out well! i topped it with chocolate glaze while it was cooling and i really liked the results. though it is not the best cheesecake i've ever had, i will probably make again.

This was an ok cheesecake for a quick and easy one.  True cheesecakes do not have sweetened condensed milk in them and also tend to have several blocks of cream cheese, it deffinately gives it a different flavor.  I did use Ghiradelli brownie mix as suggested but next time I would use half of the mix, the base was very thick.  It also needed extra bake time.  I baked mine an additional 15 minutes and it still needed longer.  I wouldn't use this recipe again, Ive made several and there are much better recipes out there

It's a good cheesecake but the brownie crust made it extremely difficult to slice. I used a Ghirardelli double chocolate, chocolate chip brownie mix because it makes the most delicious brownies, but it's very dense, so next time I will probably just go with a graham cracker crust and put more chocolate mini chips in the cheesecake itself. Also, I would like to know what topping is on the one in the picture.  I used whipped cream on mine, but I think the one in the picture has something other than whipped cream  on it.

I've been making cheesecake for years but this is the first time I've used sweetened condensed milk instead of sugar. I was very skeptical!  It. Was. AWESOME! Very dense and rich, but not too sweet. I'll never use sugar again. I'll convert all of my cheesecake recipes to use sweetened condensed milk. Super happy! (which is like regular happy except you get to wear a cape!) A side note to Mrs. Crawdad ... are you sure you used sweetened condensed milk and not evaporated milk? It was plenty sweet.

Yum and scrum! I made it exactly according to instructions, including extra mini chocolate chips on top before baking and it turned out beautiful, professional and delicious.  It was the hit of the party I took it to. Definitely a keeper!
Tip:  The cooking spray, dripped through the pan and caused little sparks as it hit the heating element - next time, I'll put foil under it when I make the brownie portion.  I used the Ghirardelli brownie mix for an 8 x 8 pan  - turned out great.  No need for frosting - like the picture shows.

Loved the recipe. I used 3/4 of the brownie mix. -for our own taste I didn’t use the chocolate chips- instead I crushed a sleeve of Oreos. I also baked the cheesecake in a water bath. Fantastic recipe. Will definitely make over and over.

It was not very good at all. I was shocked. Too bad I didn't try it before Mother's Day gathering. It was disappointing.

I made this before. It is really good. The only question I have is what is the topping on the cheesecake? I would like to know so I can add it next time.

Great recipe but I did add an extra can of the sweetened condensed milk, otherwise the cheesecake wouldn't have been sweet enough. Topped with a semisweet ganache and white chocolate drizzle, it's a crowd pleaser.

I really like this recipe. I questioned the condensed milk but that make a really big difference. This is the first time I ever made a cheesecake. I want to make one of these with strawberries as well.

I have made this several times and it has always been well received by family and friends.  It is easy to make.  I have had to bake it longer than suggested.  Also note that the recipe does not include the topping as shown in the picture.  I would recommend this recipe.

The cheesecake part of this was delicious and I would definitely make again. The brownie base was good but there was too much of it. I'd probably make it with a graham crumb or Oreo crumb base next time.

The taste, texture and presentation is perfect. I brought it to Easter dinner, and everyone loved it. I noticed some reviewers said "There's no sugar in this recipe" ummmm the condensed milk IS the sugar, and this cheesecake is definitely sweet enough...if you need it sweeter..then you got issues lmao

Tips: Grease springform pan before adding in crust & filling, or else it will stick.

Also, let it cool completely and refrigerate it before unlocking the latches, if  it cracks in the middle just cover with whipped cream and decorate with chocolate chips ;)

I used a 10 inch springform pan.  I recommend using Philidephia brand cream cheese for this, and any other cheesecakes for that matter.  The first time I made it, I used an off brand, and despite my high quality mixer, I couldn't manage to get the cream cheese completely smooth and creamy.  Every other time I have had no problem.

This was awesome! Everybody absolutely loved it!  It is a very rich cake which meant we actually had some leftovers because people were so full from Thanksgiving dinner. I'm happy to say that I took the leftovers home. Here are the modifications that I made after reading everyone's reviews:

  I used about 1/2 cup less brownie batter and pushed the brownies down after baking. Next time I may actually add more brownie because I would have preferred a slightly thicker brownie crust. I added 2 cups of chocolate chips and coated them in flour prior to mixing them in with the batter . 

 I greased the sides and the bottom of the springform pan. I did not have any issues removing the cake when complete. 

 I placed a pan of water in the oven on a separate rack and cooked for exactly 50 minutes. I then cracked the oven door and let the cake sit for another hour. I removed the cake after an hour and let it sit for another 30/40 minutes on the counter.  there was not a single crack on the cake! 

 I  put the cake in the fridge overnight and then the following day I melted chocolate and drizzled a swirly pattern on the top. 

 everyone was very impressed with this cake! I look forward to making it again!

This is a VERY delicious recipe! Although I had quite a bit of batter left over (since I used a smaller springform pan) so I just finished the batter as mini cheesecakes in a cupcake tin. They turned out great! I highly suggest using this recipe!

Pretty good. I thought it tasted nice, but i didn't really like the chocolate chips in the batter I would have preferred them on top or gone altogether. I also thought it was very rich and very sweet. Maybe cut back a little on the sugar.

I was running behind schedule and asked my 15 year old who is just learning to boil water to help me make this.  She ended up taking over, using a caramel brownie mix and practically made it all by herself!  She was SO proud!  It was the Grand Finale to our Christmas Dinner.  We melted chocolate chips and drizzled to top because we were afraid it would be way too sweet adding even more chips.  It was perfect.  Everyone devoured it and could not believe someone who can't cook made it.

I believe this recipe is missing sugar at least add 3/4 cups I almost followed this recipe until I compared to others and I also used sore cream this site has never failed me before but I was really unsure when I read one of the reviews but I did follow the brownie directions.

My husband absolutely loves cheesecake. He has always preferred a graham cracker crust, but after having this he said that he would never want me to make anything but a brownie crust. This was so easy and SO good! My only comment would be to let the brownie crust cool a bit before pouring the cheescake mix in. I poured it in right out of the oven, and pieces of the brownies dislodged and ended up in the batter. Still good though!

This was great, made it for my sis for mother's day and she loved it.  I think next time I would make the brownie layer not so thick though, was just a bit too much for me.  Top it with sour cream…yum!  Thanks

Great cheesecake, even better after I left it in the fridge a day or two.  I couldn't make it as the recipe asks since cream cheese isn't available in my area and neither are brownies, I had to make everything from scratch.  I used homemade labneh (yogurt cheese) and made the brownies from a recipe I had.

I've made this cheesecake 3 times in the last month. 2 times by request. Everyone at work loved it and so did my husband. I made in a 9x13 pan the third time and it worked out great.

Your search for a perfect cheesecake ends here!  This recipe is hands down the best I have ever had.  I have used this base for years and always gets rave reviews.  If you are not a big chocolate fan try using a homemade grahm cracker crust and feel free to leave out the chocolate chips.  Really wonderful!

So we made this to take to a friends house.  We cooked it as directed, stuck it in the fridge and then tried it about 4 hours later to make sure it wasn't awful...it was.  It was gross gross gross.  The cheesecake was a weird texture and too watery.  We ended up bringing ice cream instead.  The next night I tried it again and it was great!... I guess it has to sit for quite a while in the fridge, so if yours turns out watery and awful, give it a second chance before you throw it out!  I used a 9X13 pan and the brownies came out a little bit too thin and a tiny bit burnt, if I make it again I am going to either use more brownie mix or a smaller pan.  Make sure you take the advice of other users and make the chocolate sauce.

Delicious!!!  I used a brownie mix for 8x8 and precooked that for 15 minutes.  It came out perfectly!  I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  After the 50 minutes, I turned off the oven and cracked the door for about an hour.  It was cooked perfectly!  I used the Food Processor Chocolate Whipped Cream Frosting from this site and sprinkled additional mini chips on top.  Beautiful and tasty!

I made this for my friend and her 11 year old son's birthdays.  It was awesome!!!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and after the baking time I turned the oven off, cracked the door and let the cheesecake sit in the oven for 30 minutes to set.  It turned out beautifully.  I will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe! I didn't have the brownie mix so I used a Krusteaz chocolate chunk cookie mix for the crust, which I overcooked a bit but it still turned out fantastic. I also made a topping out of dream whip, milk & chocolate pudding, basically a mousse that was the perfect compliment. I served this for my anniversary dinner dessert & my husband loved it!

This is an excellent recipe. I decided to use Reese's peanut butter chips instead of chocolate and also drizzled some peanut butter icing I made over the cake after it had chilled. It was great balance of peanut butter, chocolate, and cheesecake flavors. I would definitely make this again.

I made this for my husband's meeting and it turned out good.  It was easy to make.   I made my own whipped topping and it balanced the sweetness of the cake..... They all said it melts in your mouth.  I would definitely make it again.... I used 9 x 13 pan and it called it Brownie Chocolate Chip squares.  Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe.

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made.  I was delicious.  I did a test run a week before a dinner party we were hosting.  Brought the first one to work and everyone raved!!!  I did not think it was done after 50 minutes so I cooked another 15.  I think it was done, it was just creamy so I could not tell, second time cooked exactly 50 minutes came out great.  Will definetly make again!

I took some of the other reviews and used a brownie mix for an 8x8 and followed the baking instructions from that. I also used a 10' pan. A little thin for a cheesecake but tasted great.

Overall, the recipe was great! I've never done a cheesecake before and it came out perfect, after reading a couple of the other reviews and keeping their comments in mind.  For a 9 inch springform, I had to cut the brownie batter down a little, and the cheesecake had to cook a LOT longer than 50 minutes, like others had said. Other than that, everything was perfect and delicious!

I loved this.  I had never used condensed sweetened milk for a cheesecake before but it turned out very well.  I had a larger pan to I added one extra tub of cream cheese and added white sugar to make up for the condensed milk.  For the topping I mixed heavy whipping cream, sugar and confectioners sugar until peaks formed.  After I spread it on I spinkled chocolate chips on the top and it looked just like the picture.  I got compliments on the topping as well as the cheesecake. It was amaaaazing.

This is a perfect mixture of cheescake and chocolate. I followed directions exactly, but served it without any topping. My father, who is NOT a chocolate lover, has asked for this at Christmas * he just had it at Thanksgiving!

This turned out perfectly.  The cheesecake didn't crack or sink.  It looked as good as it tasted.  I topped it with chocolate curls and served with raspberry sauce.  I skipped the chocolate chips only because I forgot to buy them.  I did put a pan of water on a lower rack of the oven while baking the cheesecake portion.  Partly to prevent cracking and partly to catch any leakage from the springform pan.

Absolutely delightful. When I made it for desert, it was gone before I could have seconds! I used less brownie mix and cream cheese and it came out wonderful, not to rich or to tasteless.

Very very simple to make. I improvised with regular brownie mix and it worked quite well. I also chopped regular sized chocolate chips instead of using minis. Overall it was great, looks good, tastes delicious. I recommend a small piece because it is a tad bit rich.

This was good! My first cheesecake. When I make it again I'll probably use a 10-in pan (like another reviewer said) the brownie crust was pretty thick. Also, make sure you make chewy brownies- mine were kinda tough.

This was really good.  I did find the brownie bottom a little too thick for my liking.  Several people found the bottom to be a bit too rich when combined with the cheesecake.  It did take longer to bake all the way through also.
