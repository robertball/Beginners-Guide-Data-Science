Bacon, Potatoes and Cheese. How can it be bad? The taste was great and I received a lot of compliments. Everyone loved this. I did have a couple small problems that I will keep in mind when making this again. The butter, although only 1 Tbs. is not necessary and only adds to the bacon grease that pools on the top/sides. I had to drain A LOT of grease from these before taking to the table. I didn't use 18 slices of bacon, closer to 12, but should have expected this. The baking time was approx. 20 min longer in my oven and could have stood 5 - 10 min longer but everything else was done and waiting so I just went with it. The bacon on the bottom was not crisp or brown at all. Next time, I think I will just arrange the bacon across the top. I will also add more cheese next time.  The fontina got a little lost. Most of these things can be fixed easily and as much as everyone commented on these, I will definately be making them again. Thanks for sharing!

Like most reviews I've read on this site, this recipe was changed a little. I used cheddar instead of fontina and I poured 2 beaten eggs (mixed w/milk) over the first layer of potatoes (I customized the recipe for 2 people). It was scrumptious!

I pre-cooked and mashed the potatoes before mixing in the other ingredients (specifically the cheese) and baking. I also used HAM instead of bacon. The FLAVORS melded wonderfully. Turned out to be a genuinely nice side dish to my Porterhouse Steak (my husband's boss, his wide + 2 others) presentations.

I had a little trouble with this recipe. It took way loger to cook than stated and my bacon started to burn on the edges before it was done in the center, so that I had to cover the edges with foil. Still, the flavor was really good and I think I can rig it to work. I'll update you when I try it again. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have trouble with the potatoes baking, although I did expect it.  Not sure if it's the type of potatoes I used (small red potatoes) or how thinly I sliced them (I used a mandoline) but they were done in the stated hour.  I did bake them covered on the bottom shelf of the oven during that hour.  I used turkey bacon since that's what we have.  I don't consider this a side dish--it's more of a filling main dish to me!  With some veggies it's definitely a full meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow this was great.  How can you go wrong with bacon and potatoes? ;)  I used a throw away loaf pan which worked nicely for the bacon. It folded over the potatoes perfectly and looked beautiful when I pulled it from the oven.  I thinly sliced the potatoes and sprinkled with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder with a light sprinkle of parm cheese.  I made to accompany steaks but this would be great with breakfast as well.

I put this into a baked crust in a tart pan & served with sour cream on the side. Very, very good & a nice change from a plain old baked potato. I served this for my morther-in-law's birthday & she loved it!

This was delicious! I made it with my Kitchen Aid mixer using the Slicer&Shredder attachment. SOOOOO easy!! Just slice up onions, potatoes and cheese all into one bowl and toss. Skip the butter you don't need it. I used swiss cheese too because it was what I had.

Simple and delicious.  I just used cheddar, and it did take a little longer to cook, but I just covered it with foil and turned the temp. down for the last little bit.

I wasn't too crazy about it however, my boyfriend loved it.  The bacon cooked up beatufully and it looked terrific when it came out of the oven.  I think it was the fontina I wasn't keen on.  I might try it again sometime with cheddar.  I would recommend using a little salt and a good amt. of pepper on the potato layers.

I decided to try this and once I did my kids went crazy over it!  I have to make it at least once a week now.  I do add a bit of milk to the potatoes and add onions in with the potatoes and cheese for extra flavor.  I've used different kinds of cheese and think I'll try turkey bacon to try and cut down on some of the fat.

Will make again, but will add some onions and will be sure to put the bacon on top so it actually cooks and the fat seeps downward.

I found this to be too "greasy" for my tastes when using the bacon as the tart "crust" and I wasn't able to serve it straight from the oven given the build up of the grease in the areas where the bacon edges curled away from the edge of the tart pan.  On the plus side,  I was pleasantly surprised that my young (picky) niece and nephew went back for 2nds of this -- hard not to like bacon and potatoes!

I served this to our gourmet club and everyone asked for the recipe.  But, I used turkey bacon for one of the pies and added a little butter on top before cooking.  It was great.  Actually, some of the people who tasted the pork bacon version and the turkey bacon version liked the turkey better.  As the potato pie cooled, the turkey bacon held the pie together to a point that people picked up a piece and ate it like a tart.  I had sliced it in small pieces so people could try both.  I'd like to try it again in a 9 x 11 pan.

This was wonderful, don't need to add the butter, the fat from the bacon does a good job, i used swiss and fetta cheeses and then 2nd time i made it used farmers cheese and swiss, both times was great, a new family favorite.

Very good, however I had to cook almost twice as long as they recommended in my gas oven. No one wants raw bacon!

This recipe wasn't so great, it was obvious there would be problems just by reading it. No seasoning and the way they did the bacon was sure to leave a lot of unwanted grease, so I fixed it so it works much better. I made it in a pie pan and used a bottom pie crust. I cut the bacon while raw into small strips about 1 inch and cooked them first then dried with a paper towel. I used a mandolin slicer to slice the potatoes which made them cook much more evenly. I layered the paper thin potatoes with the crumpled bacon, cheese and I added sweet onion also sliced with the mandolin. Add just a pinch of sea salt, black pepper and italian (or french) mixed herbs. If you can't find fontina just use shredded swiss. This came out so flavorful and tender without the greasy mess.

Loved this recipe! I did add onions and some more spices but outer than that I didn't change anything! Make sure you slice the potatoes nice and thin and you'll be good to go. I even loved the fontina cheese, it was all delicious. Definitely will be making this again.

Loved it.... although it took much longer to cook! 

(The edges started to burn... so I covered it with foil)
