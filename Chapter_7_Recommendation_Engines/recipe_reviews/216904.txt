I grilled the steaks because it was a beautiful night and I much prefer the meat grilled!  I hadn't made this for a long time but now looking forward to summer to enjoy this more often!

I braised the vension in some of the merlot to give it more flavor.  I think this sauce is amazing, but it needs a little more so that there is enough for each steak.  I used tenderlion pieces instead of steak and the meat was so tender with this sauce on top I fell in love.

I don’t make a lot of reduction sauces, so I really didn’t know what to expect given the fact that this recipe does not contain any herbs or spices.  Suffice to say, it was fabulous!  I did not have any blackberry jam, but I did have a bottle of Manischewitz Blackberry Wine.  I used that in place of the red wine and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  Did not add salt, but seasoned with ground white pepper.  This was good over the venison, but I can envision this sauce over a bacon wrapped filet Mignon and topped with sautéed mushrooms.  Will be making this one again.

Made this sauce exactly as written, including the cornstarch addition.  None of the ingredients stole the show.  The sauce was delicious over medium-rare grilled venison steaks.  This is worthy of making for company.

I made this using onions and Cab. Sav. and Venison Backstrap. This sauce was so good that I plan on using it for steak as well. Simple flavorful sauce. You won't be disappointed. I also looks so upscale for how simple it is to make!  Thank you Web Spinner

Made this with pork tenderloins wrapped in bacon. Delicious! Needed to thicken the sauce a bit at the end though with a touch of corn starch. Definitely a company worthy dinner.

I chose to use fresh blackberries from Oregon state along with an Oregon based Pinot Noir "Firesteed" which has cherry and berry flavors to make the fruity blackberry pop even more.

I cut two back straps (whole tenderloin) in to thirds, salt/peppered them, and then grilled them medium rare.  Cut them into medallions, put on a platter, drizzled a little of the sauce and garnished with blackberries.  It was great and served 9.  Next time, I may add a little chopped up chili pepper to the reduction for some heat.  I probably added more jam than called for, but this was great.

Sauce was amazing. Seared the venison in butter, than simmered in wine, then wrapped and broiled it in maple bacon in the oven. Topped with sautéed mushrooms, sauce and berries. Served with potato wedges and arugula goat cheese salad. Delicious!

What a great change.  Even made it so that those that have always said, "I don't like venison." all of a sudden take a second look... and a second helping.  That is a good thing with picky eaters!
