This is similar to my mother-in-law's Seven Layer Salad.  The lettuce would  be on the bottom, followed by a layer of celery, green onions (or bell pepper) followed by a layer of frozen peas (much tastier than canned peas), layer of your favorite dressing (mayo, miracle whip or you could do ranch or caesar), shredded cheddar and bacon bits..seven layers.  When you use the frozen peas, it helps keep everything below the peas stay fresher longer and it can be made ahead by even a day with no problem.  It was/is  always one of my favorite salads.

My mom made this salad for years, and its a holiday favorite.  So easy because you make it the day before.

I love the original version (I am the author); but, Stacy, your ceasar version sounds YUMMY! I will try it! Save it as a custom version so others will see it as well!

I tried this recipe with the "canned peas."  Not nearly as good as when made with frozen peas.   The lettuce layers are not pretty either.  Eye appeal is very important to me.   I'll not make this again.

This is a great summer salad. Something cool when it's hot outside and you just don't want anything hot to eat.

Awesome idea, got me to thinking of other directions I can go with salads, serve in a larger mason jar instead of bowls, would be fun mixing and eating the salad that you like.  Great idea!

Love the ease of making this the night before. I'm with some of the other reviewers, frozen peas work better. Also, I added tomatoes and green onions, this recipe is awesome because of all the veggies you can add to it. Thanks!

I liked this. I only had fresh English peas I bought from Trader Joes which came in a 14oz bag. As a result, I made 1/4 of the recipe and layered the salad in 4 small glass dishes creating mini arranged salads. I cooked the peas in the microwave for 10 minutes in some salted water. I used regular mayo and sugar in the raw. I like something crunchy in my salad. I didn't have any croutons, but added some corn chips. This really did work well. ty

This was delicious and a hit at our family Christmas gathering.  I used the canned peas and found it worked well.  I think the canned allows for better blending of flavors. Recipes you can make ahead are great for me!  Loved it!!

I made this with frozen peas.  They are so much better.  Also, I reduced the peas so that it was a solid layer of peas.  75 ounces of peas was too much in my opinion.  I layered it with lettuce, green peppers, peas, Miracle Whip, cheese and then bacon on top.  I thought it was as good as I've eaten before.

I made it  with frozen baby peas, omitted bell pepper, and used  real bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled. I did not include bell pepper because not all in the group like it. I definitely would make it again because it went together very easily and everyone liked it!
