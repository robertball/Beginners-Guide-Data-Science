Just wanted to add a comment as I live in Mexico and cook Tinga alot and one of the main ingriedents of Traditional mexican tinga is Cinnamon.  The cinnamon is very important as it plays a huge part in the flavor. Best to use a few pieces of cinnamon stick rather then powder.  
Also you really only need 1-2 chipotle´s from a can depending on how hot you want it. A whole can would be VERY hot!!
I would also add some chicken stock, for more flavor.

I put frozen chicken breasts in my crockpot and covered with the sauteed onions and the tomato / chipotle mixture, then cooked all day on low.  When I got home from work, I shredded the chicken (really, practically all I had to do was POKE at the chicken, it was just falling apart!), and added some salt and garlic powder (definitely needs salt).  I'm going to let it simmer for another hour or so until my boyfriend gets home from work.  Pretty good and totally easy.  It's spicy, but not too spicy.

I have tried this recipe several times, each time reducing the chipotles, and it's still too hot, even for my husband who loves very spicy foods.  However it is tasty if you can stand the heat!  I am making it again this week with half of a chipotle, so hopefully that will make it manageable.

Just wanted to clarify something. Please note that the ingredient list says "chiles to taste". If you are not accustomed to eating very spicy food begin with 1 or 2 peppers and some sauce. Taste it, if you want it hotter, add more! Also, someone mentioned using cinnamon. They do not use cinnamon in it where my in-laws are from in Mexico. I got the recipe from them. Remember that mexican food is very regional. It's taste varies from state to state. Thanks to everyone that took the time to try this recipe and rate it!

I was really worried that this wasn't going to come out to our liking after tasting the adobo sauce (my first time having it). However, it tasted really nice after everything simmered together for a while. I used a couple teaspoons of the abobo sauce and only one of the peppers as I was worried it would be too spicy for my wimpy tastebuds. I did throw a clove of garlic in the blender when I pureed the pepper and tomatoes and followed the suggestions of adding a cinnamon stick while simmering. I served these with a little bit of a shredded Mexican cheese blend, sour cream, and chopped cilantro on top. We really enjoyed this recipe, thank you!

Mil gracias, Fredda. Had this years ago and lost the recipe.  I prepared it in a large, deep black iron skillet and used chicken tenders. I also used canned, fire roasted tomatoes and halved the can of chipotles since I was making it for guests and everyone's take on how hot something is is so relative.

This was an excellent recipe.  The only modifications that I made were from how I have cooked this before and instead of using canned tomatoes, I boiled fresh tomatoes and put them in my belnder with onion, garlic and the chipotle peppers. This was delicious!!

OMG!!! This was SOOOOO yummy! I am headed back to work tomorrow after a long (actually, too short) holiday break. I'm looking at piles of laundry and tons of dirty dishes right now (ugh!) and knowing myself, there's nooo way I'll be spending much time preparing dinner because of it. Freda's tinga met my needs exactly - it's cheap, easy / quick to prepare and delicious! I've actually had this recipe in my in-box for quite some time, but it wasn't until my recent trip to Cancun that made me anxious to try it. The resort my hubby and I stayed at had tinga on their buffet. I gave it a try and LOVED it! Fredda's recipe was just as good, if not better. :) The addition of cinnamon (I added a cinnamon stick, broken in half) made this ever so slightly sweet, but in a good way. My only other changes were subbing a shredded rotisserie chicken for chicken breasts and adding a couple "glugs" of chicken broth halfway thru the simmering step. NOTE: I found 2 chipotle peppers / 2 t sauce to be spot on. Served on tostada shells with Boston Bibb lettuce leaves, shredded cheddar cheese, fresh pico de gallo, salsa verde and a dollop of crema (the BEST!) and Mexican rice / pinto beans on the side, this was a SUPERB and eye-appealing meal (the green lettuce, tinga mixture and bright pico looked lovely, almost Christmas-like!). Authentic Jarito's sodas were a perfect accompainment. My hubby commented that I should make this again - SOON! Thanks for sharing, Fredda O! :-)

I'm Mexican and I have cooked Mexican food since I was 12! I love cooking Mexicand and I hav also studied the evolution of Mexican food. This recipe does not need any cinnamon as another person wrote; the recipe is quite authentic. The chipotle part it has to be added little by little until you find what is suitable for your taste buds.  When I make this at home I only use one chipotle pepper and one teaspoon of the adobo sauce. Don't rush to use the whole chipotle can, it is easier to add more than to take out.

This is a good recipe, but a bit too hot for my families taste as made.  Next time I will reduce the Chipotle in Adobo sauce.

Yummy! I'm a wimp and couldn't handle a whole can of chiptole in adobo, so I only used about half. This is tasty stuff...I'll definitely make it again. *EDIT: I've made this over and over and over now...it's one of my favorite AR recipes ever...love the tingle of chiptole! My favorite way to eat this is in a flour tortilla with some sour cream, but I'm sure the tostada way is great too. I've read some reviews that say it's not authentic, but even if it's not, I don't give a rip...it TASTES great!

I used a package of 3 boneless chicken breasts, poached and shredded it, and was shocked to find the cooked meat weighed only 10 oz.  Needless to say, my tinga was extremely spicy as I used most of the 7 oz can of peppers.  Half the can for 3 chicken breasts is probably too much.  Despite that, my husband enjoyed this and he's really not a big fan of Mexican cuisine.  Instead of buying ready made tostada shells, I baked corn tortillas on a cookie sheet until crisp, and with the addition of shredded cheddar, sour crean and spinach leaves, this was a tasty meal.

WOW an authentic Mexican dish!  This is awesome, I'd forgotten about this dish until I saw it here. Learned how to make it years ago, glad I saw it again. IF you can find real Mexican cream instead of sour cream it's worth it!

This was really good and easy.  Because I wanted to cook it in the crockpot, I just threw whole chicken breast halves in the crockpot  and covered with the onion/tomato mixture.  I sauteed the onions first and blended in the tomato/chipotle mixture.  After several hours, I took the chicken breasts out and shredded them.  Then I put the shredded chicken back in to cook for awhile and soak up the liquid.  This was my first time using tosdadas and we really liked it.

I love this! My husband said it was the best Mexican dish ever, even better then the restaurants.   I slow cooked mine it came out so tender and juicy! I blended a can of diced tomatoes, about 3-4 chilies with all of the adobo sauce. I put that in the crock pot then added a can of chicken stock low sodium.  I spiced it up a little with pepper, cumin, and diced Garlic. I sliced up half an onion and added that to the pot. then put the chicken in about 4 breasts then added a cinnamon stick.  After it cooks for about 6 hours I took the chicken out and put it into a bowl and shred it, then i added some of the juices that it cooked in to my liking. (the more you add the spicier it is!)  I made tacos, fried up some corn tortillas, added cheese and sour cream, I can't stop eating them!! Also served with Mexican rice.

My mom makes this for us all the time, but somewhat different. She usually uses a whole chicken and boils it until done and reserves some of the broth. For a whole chicken, she'll use 2-3 medium/large onions and fresh tomatoes. We like it with a lot of red color so she'll dice up about 5 tomatoes or more depending on their size. When the chicken is almost done cooking, she'll sauté the tomatoes and onions in olive oil with a couple of bay leaves and oregano. After she’d shred the chicken, she’d put it in the same pot she cooked it in and added the sautéed onions and tomatoes and some chicken broth. She never measured how much broth, but she added just enough to cover about ¼ of the chicken. Then she added 2 chipotle peppers and some of its sauce and salt and allowed it to simmer and voila! Love this recipe!

Like other reviewers mentioned, the original recipe would have been much too spicy even as someone with a high tolerance for spice!  I used 4 chipotles with the seeds removed, which was the perfect amount of heat for my fiance and I.  I put the chicken mixture over polenta rather than the tortilla, and topped with guacamole, and it was delicious!

This is very good! It is very easy to make and will definitely be a keeper! I use chipotle peppers all the time and always keep them on hand because they give wonderful flavor. I used three peppers from the can and about 2 tbs of adobo sauce. It's not too spicy, I would add more but have to please the whole family. I also added cilantro and a little chicken broth. We used it for taco filling and everyone loved it with a little drizzle of lemon.  Thanks for sharing!

I can attest to the authenticity of this recipe!  I lived in Mexico City in the early 1990's and I was taught many recipes by my Mexican sister in law while there.  Tinga was one of them.  The only thing that I would add is that I was taught to make the tinga using equal amounts of onion and chicken (not by weight, but by volume).  My sister in law was very specific about this...She said, "if you use a pile of chicken this big, you must use a pile of onions this big!"  We always sauteed the onions in a small amount of butter until transparent then added the chicken and the tomato/chipotle mixture.  Always served atop a tostada with a dollop of Mexican crema.  My SIL was born and raised in Oaxaca - so perhaps her onion rule was a regional one.  I've made this for my immediate and extended family on many occassions, and they all keep coming back for more.  A huge hit!

I needed to use up a nearly full can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce so I added it all, warned my family it would have some heat (which it did) but they loved it. My husband took the leftovers, mixed them with some homemade southwestern ranch dressing and used it as a dip for tortilla chips. Will be making again.

This dish turned out great! I browned the chicken first, onions and garlic and added to the crockpot. You will have to add the chipotle peppers accordingly to your taste. I was afraid of making this dish too spice, so I only used 1 chipotle pepper and some of the adobo sauce, I’m glad I did it otherwise it would have been too spice for us. Once ready, I added some fresh cilantro.

Mexican Tinga Haiku: "Terrific tinga. Simple, spicy flavor's great. Don't change a ThingA." I followed the recipe exactly, although I think I may have used 1/3 can of chipotles, knowing that otherwise, this would've had a bit too much of a punch for us. I thought that I'd serve it w/ a selection of toppings (grated cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped tomato, avocado and what-not), but truth be told, this was absolutely perfect served simply as written - w/ a plop of sour cream on top. Cannot wait to make these again!

This was really, really good.  I used 3 chipotle peppers, which I removed the seeds from first, and put everything in my crock pot on low for about 4 hours.  This was great with refried beans, cheese, and veggies over tostada shells, but I think the meat would also be delicious in tacos, burritos, southwestern eggrolls, or almost any Mexican/southwestern dish.

Delicious! I made 4 chicken breasts and cut everything in half. This had quite a bit of heat but wasn't too spicy, I'd say medium sweat. The sour cream tamed the fire and was perfect with this. I added shredded lettuce, parmesan and shredded Monteray Jack cheese. All I was missing was a little sliced avocado on top. I don't like onion pieces so I put them into the blender too after I cooked them til soft and translucent. This was so easy and so amazingly fantastic! I simmered this about an hour. Thanks for sharing, I loved it.

The main thing that is missing from this recipe is all the delicious toppings that REALLY make these delicious!  My husband is from Mexico and we usually spread the sour cream on the tostada, heap on the tinga, top with Mexican crumbling cheese, chopped lettuce and salsa! These additions make this excellent rather than just good. The tinga itself is delicious, although there is really only need for one pepper to make it gringo style :), or kid friendly.  I would have liked two, but anymore than that and it would have been too hot, so add a pepper, blend, taste and add another if you think you like more heat, just don't dump the whole can if this is your first time making it!  Enjoy!

A friend gave me her tinga recipe years ago and is almost identical to Fredda's. It is now an oft-requested menu item around our home.  If short on time, an already baked rotisserie chicken is super easy to shred.  Our preference in preparing the chicken breasts is to poach them until almost done and then shred into the sauce mixture for a final simmer of flavors.  Thankfully, we were advised early on about the power of chipotle peppers in the adobe sauce.  After making tinga numerous times, we've slowly increased the chipotle pepper to sauce ratio.  I tend to make more sauce than the recipe calls for my simply adding another can of stewed tomatoes.  IF EVER TOO HOT - Add honey.  I now keep my honey jar right at hand when making this treat.  You have to taste test it, right?  And if too hot, immediately dab honey on your tongue. Then add honey, little bit at a time, to the tinga mixture.  Those mild mannered tongues in your family will thank you!  Honey is a better treatment for "heat on the tongue" than milk or bread, in our opinion.  Thank you for this recipe treat!  Oh - if anyone in your family thinks they "hate" onions, try pureeing one and then cooking the pureed onion in a bit of olive oil with nutmeg (yes - nutmeg!).  This will temper the oniony taste and, chances are, they'll never even notice that you've added it to the sauce mixture.

Love this for leftover roast chicken.  Cinnamon sticks added to the mix are a must.  One or two chipotles in adobo are more than sufficient - a whole can would be too much for even the most hardy Mexican!

We really liked this recipe! I used 3 chipoltes with some sauce and the heat was perfect! I added a dash of cinnamon, 2 chicken bouillon cubes and about a half cup of water to the sauce.  Served with refried beans, sharp cheddar cheese, sour cream lettuce and tomato along with the warmed tostada shells.  Very yummy! Thanks!

This was really tasty and really good with ranch on top at the end and lots of cheese, I only did half the recipe cause it was just for me and my husband, but I look forward to using the left overs in a salad, in the future ill use this for nachos and like someone said Tacos would be super yummy!

Thank you thank you for this recipe! I made this for hubby and I for dinner and it was a big hit. The only change I made was I added only 2 chipoltles but other than that followed as directed and it turned out wonderfully. Will be making this again. Can't wait to use it in tacos and enchiladas too. Very yummy :)

I followed the recipe and they were good but didn't have any WOW factor for me. Hubby strongly disagreed and talked about this recipe for a week. I think my taste has changed and I no longer care for the chipotle/adobe flavor but if you do like it then give these a try. Hubby would have given 10 stars if he could.

Very delicious. But I only used one pepper out of the can & that was PLENTY! I had to add an 8 oz can of tomato sauce though to turn down the heat just a tad.

Loved this!  I only used three chipotle peppers (about 1/3 of a 7 ounce can) and it was plenty spicy.  The submitter suggests added them to taste and I agree, I don't think many people could tolerate the heat if you added the entire can.  I topped mine with sour cream, Cotija cheese, and avocado.  Thanks for sharing this fantastic dish, I'll be making again and again!

This was very good, and my husband loved it, which always makes me happy. Because I am a wimp, I only used about 3/4 of a chipotle pepper, and it was delicious. The best suggestion I took, though, was to simmer a cinnamon stick along with the mixture--added a very subtle but amazing depth of flavor that made the dish!

I gave this 5 stars because I made as directed and my hubby and i thought it was delicious. It's like Mexican BBQ sauce or something, sweet, smoky and spicey. Warning though!!! It's crazy hot! I had to mix sour cream in it along with putting some on top! It was honestly a little to hot for me but I gave it 5 stars because the flavor was delicious and the hotness factor is personal preference. I will DEFINTELY make it again, but not for the kids!! :-)

This was a good recipe. I did add salt and put refried beans on the bottom of the tostada shell. Next time I think I will add can of green chilies, powder chili in the mixture.

I made this today as part of an early mother's day meal and WHAT A HIT! I made it with half the peppers, but all the sauce that way it'd appeal to most people. Instead using preshredded chicken I slow cooked 1 lb chicken breast and 1 lb of chicken thighs in the over at 250 for 4 hours (shredding 2.5 hours in) with the satueed onions and pepper and tomato puree. I added salt since I saw a lot of comments saying it needed salt. No one complained about it being too salty. Also, since I didn't have canned tomatoes i took two tomatoes and some chicken stock and used that.

I make my tinga exaclty the same. For the reviewers who love spicy the more adobe the better!!! I add corn to mine and when placed on the tostadas I like to add cute lettuce with the sour cream then and sometimes I'll add some alvacado salsa to it.

Turned out pretty good. Myself, not the biggest fan of chipotle but my honey ( who is mexican) loved it. If your wanting to lessen the spicyness, I'd suggest 3-4 chipotle chiles vs what recipe calls for.  I used the leftovers the next day in hoagie type sandwiches.  Yum!

My family enjoyed this and I will make it again.  I threw all the ingredients into the Slow Cooker with 2 lbs of frozen Chicken.  I used 2 chipotle peppers (including seeds) plus 2 tablespoons of sauce and it was just a tad spicy - perfect for my family.  I also threw in a stick of cinnamon, broken in half, and I really enjoyed the slight flavor this imparted.  I cooked the chicken on low until I got home from work – apx 8 hours.  I shredded the meat and returned it to the Slow Cooker for another 2 hours.  I served this as the picture shows – with a large leaf of Bibb Lettuce on a Tostada Shell which made for a nice and new (to us) presentation.  My family won’t eat sour cream (I love it), but I bet if I stirred some Mexican Crema or Crème Fraiche into the meat just before serving it would be even better and they would never know.  :-)

Loved this recipe (as did my entire family).  I used half the required chipotle peppers and it was a little spicy but the chipotle flavor was amazing.  Goes great with a Corn & Black Bean salad.  Two of those having it have already asked for the recipe.  Of course, the easiest thing is simply emailing them the allrecipes.com link.  :)   LOVE IT!!!

made twice.  Very good, but very hot if you use all the peppers!!   I normally put this in a crockpot and let it cook all day and then shredd the chicken.  I freeze it in single serving containers and take it to work along with all the taco fixings!

Nice recipe, if you don't like it that spicy just add sour cream at the end as a topping along with lettuce, cheese and other mexican toppings.

I admit that I changed this recipe quite abit, but man it was great!!! I used "Mexican Style" stewed tomatoes to add extra spice (The can includes mild diced chilies, cumin, and coriander.). I also I added a little salt and garlic powder as another reviewer recommended. I placed four diced chicken breast in crock-pot with the rest of the ingredients on high for 4 hours. Being lazy I didn't even saute the onions before hand.   The flavor was excellent! The smokiness of the chipotle peppers really adds a wonderful dimension to this dish. I might use a few less peppers next time since the dish was pretty hot, but this problem is easily tamed by some sour cream, cheese, and avocado. I will definitely make this dish again.

I made this for a Cinco De Mayo party.  A few changes...add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the onions while they sautee.  Also, cut the peppers down to 3 and seed them.  A whole can unseeded will ruin this recipe.

Loved it! It was perfect and delicioso :)

First time I made it as is.. second time I made it with beef and processed the grilled onions with the tomatoes and chipotle peppers because my husband hates onions. Both were excellent and he loved the beef one better. I thought they were both fabulous. I'll be making this again and again!

This is a wonderful recipe. The only thing I changed is I pureed the onion also. Makes a great burrito, tamale & enchilada filling.

Delicious dish that is being added to our rotation of favorite Mexican dishes. This was our first time having Tinga and we are hooked! I followed the recipe as is except I added a quarter of a large onion and garlic glove to the blender, which I used while boiling chicken breasts. I’m rating the recipe 4 stars as I think the ingredient list or the instructions should have been more specific as to how many peppers to use. I knew chipotles would be hot, but for someone who doesn’t know how to use the peppers, the dish would be too hot using the whole can. We layered our Tostadas with Refried black beans, Tinga, shredded lettuce, sliced avocado, Queso Fresco (crumbled), a dollop of sour cream, and fresh salsa. RECOMMENDATIONS (based on what I did): 1) Start with 1 chipotle pepper in 1 tsp adobo sauce, add ½ pepper plus ½ tsp adobo sauce at a time and taste as you go to get to your preference of spice. 2) If too spicy for you, try blending in chicken broth (1/2 - 1 cup at a time). I used 3 peppers in 3 tsp adobo sauce and ended up adding about 2 cups chicken broth to reduce the heat/spiciness. Results in excess sauce-don’t add all of it to the shredded chicken! 3) Boiled 1.6 LB chicken breasts for 40 minutes with 1 tsp salt, 1 clove garlic, a quarter of 1 large white onion (peeled), and about 5 cups water; removed chicken and let cool, then shred the breasts. Reserved broth for other dishes I was making (Refried black beans and Spanish rice).

Very good! The whole family liked this. Even though my husband could have easily handled the heat from the whole can (he loves "kill me hot" foods), I only added three of the peppers and all of the sauce so that we could all eat it. Thank you for such a great recipe! This will be a regular for us.

Rating as a work in progress - as in I've already made the chicken and am simply waiting for hubby to come home for dinner.  So simple!  I don't know whether we're going to have it on tostados (DH has a toothache) or simply serve with Spanish rice or with tortilla chips - but either way, I simply love the chicken and the versatility of this dish.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I make this often pretty much the same way for people who like beef you can use a roast instead and also if its to spicy use the adobo sauce without the chipotle same taste not so spicy also put lettuce and cheese on top either queso fresco or Mexican Parmesan which is called cotijà

I could look at this and read reviews and see where things could go wrong. I used about 1/2 Tbls of the chipotles and I am used to very spicy food and that was just the right amount. I also added a 1/4tsp of cinnamon as one reviewer stated and salt and pepper. I also hit it with 1/2 tbls of my own mexican seasoning which I think I used Emerils recipe on FN. After those changes, it was great! This made 6 tingas, not 16. 4oz of chicken per tinga and one ounce of sour cream per. The picture is not a good representation of the actual recipe either but it does give you the general idea and something to look at.

So we made it again with fresh tomatoes and corn oil and it made a huge different just switching those two out. We also made the tostadas. Make your own chipotle peppers and it will be over the top!

WOW! This meal was incredible. I did not stray from the recipe much, I just added a few adjustments. First off, I used 2 chipotles and 2-3 tablespoons of adobo sauce. I also used crushed tomatoes because the store was out of stewed. I had a "happy accident" of not cooking the chicken first before adding it to the sauce/chipotle mixture. After 30 minutes simmering in the sauce, I removed it to shred it and it just FELL APART!. To make sure it was well-flavored, I put it back in the sauce, added about a teaspoon of salt, and let it simmer again for another 10 minutes. Topped the Tostada with Mexican Crema, shredded chicken, shredded cheese, and cilantro. SO AMAZING. THANK YOU!!!!

these are good enough and easy enough that i do plan on making again but they are lacking some "Zing".  I followed another reviewers suggestion and just added everything to a crock pot.  I cooked on high for 3 hours (shredding after 2).  I jused 3 chipotle peppers and some adobo, it was a tad too hot for me so I also added a splash of tomato juice to mellow it out.  It had some head and smoke but no real flavor.  needs something, maybe cilantro and a splash of lime juice??  topped mine with shredded Mexican cheese lettuce, sour cream and a cilantro salsa and the bites with the salsa were definitely better than the ones without.

My family loves this! Best served on a tostada shell spread with refried beans sprinkled with shredded cheddar, then a layer of the tinga, topped with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes. You'll need a fork and a knife but oh so good!

delicious! especially with the cinnamon added and make sure to cook the chicken in a crock pot before hand.  I may make a double recipe of the sauce next time too....because it gives you a ton of chicken and not so much sauce

Very good. Use one or two chipotles and a little adobo sauce. I used half of a whole boiled chicken I had left over. Definitely put refried beans on the tostadas. I accompanied this with a salad with a garlic, lemon & olive oil dressing.

I was really scared that this was going to be too spicy for my kiddos, and it was for my 7 year-old son.  But my two older daughters loved it, and said that I was just being wimpy.  I do have slightly wimpy taste buds, and did think this was on the spicy side, but it had such terrific flavor, I couldn't stop eating it.  This is so different from the usual mexican chicken that we are used to  eating using taco seasoning.  This recipe was quick, simple, and so good.  Thanks!

Very good, used 3 chipotles and it was perfect. We also chose to top our shells with coleslaw before topping with the chicken which was excellent although probably not authentic.

I made these for my family and it wasn't a hit at all...make sure that you and your family like the taste of adobo sauce (the sauce with chipotle peppers in the can) because it was extremely overwhelming and i didnt use much. I didnt like this recipe at all.

i used canned tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes because that's what i had on hand. when i made this i only used about two of the chipotle peppers, i can't imagine how spicy a whole can would be! really easy recipe and tastes great too.

This is a great recipe, but where I am from we add margarine to the oil.  Trust me it gives it a great taste.  Try it!

Absolutely LOVED this! So quick and easy, yet tastes like you've spent hours in the kitchen working over a hot stove.  It's hot, but in a good way and the heat grows on you.  I only used 2 chipotles at first, but by the 4th batch I was up to 6!  I eat it like a burrito and by the time you add beans and toppings, it takes away most of the heat.  Is a 7oz can too much?  Yes, but my guess is the recipe was written that way because it's probably the smallest can you can buy.  My can was a 12oz and because this was such a huge hit, I've been making batch after batch and freezing it.

Very tasty authentic mexican dish! We pureed the chiles in adobo seperate and spooned only 3Tblsp. into the pureed stewed tomatoes and it was very spicy. We also added blackbeans and rice to make burritos and they were delicious!

I first had Tinga at a Mexican wedding, and I asked the Bride what it was and how I could make it.  I then found this recipe online and it is delicious.  There are many ways to enjoy this recipe.  I have made nachos, con queso dip, on salad, burritos, and as it is pictured.  I have used chicken and pork.  I don't, however use all of the chipotle peppers as that is quite spicy, but I do use all of the smoky adobo sauce.  I looked for the mexican cream in Shop N Save and could not find it.  But I mix fresh cilantro with the regular sour cream and it adds a nice fresh flavor. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very easy and very good. After reading that cinnamon is a traditional spice for tinga, i too added a cinnamon stick while it simmered.....A whole can of chipotles?? Is that a joke or just a typo? I can not imagine what an entire can of chipotles will do to ones mouth!! I only added 3 peppers and i thought even that was really spicey. Anyways, loved this and will make again :)

Ok, I have alot of things to add... We cook a chicken flavored white rice to put on the tostada before we pile the meat on, it's great. As for the chiles, I use 2-3 for 2 1/2 lbs. of shredded chicken. Be sure to use all of the adobo sauce from the can though. Sometimes I substitute the stewed tomatoes with tomato sauce or fresh, cooked tomatoes. We also top with queso fresco, shredded lettuce and sour cream (definately mexican). I always add 1 stick of cinn. while it is simmering. I pull it out when it's ready.

I made this recipe for the guys my husband works with, so I tripled it and made it in the slow cooker. I added 5 cinnamon sticks and bought the mexican sour cream as suggested. The night I made it, with only one can of Chipotle peppers it was VERY hot! The next morning it was only slightly spicy, and by lunch time it was not hot at all. If you plan to cook this for a long time, use the whole can that the recipe calls for. Everyone at work loved it and I will be making this again!

This was excellent!!  The only thing I did differently was that I didn't have a can of chipotles in adobo sauce but I do have a jar of dried chipotle chile flakes.  I added 1 tablespoon and it was wonderful, pretty spicy too.  I also used a can of fire roasted tomatoes (so much better than stewed - in my opinion anyway) I will make again and again.

This was a great basis for a nice spicy dish. I made it in my slow cooker with some chorizo and black beans added in for more protein. I love the chipolte sauce, so spicy good. I used chicken thighs.

I was in a hurry tonight, so I made this with canned chicken. I know real shredded chicken would be way better, but it still turned out good. It was too spicy for me but Husband enjoyed it. It would be even better with some fresh cilantro too. Thanks!

Recipe was spot on.  Quick and easy to make.  I saved some time by using leftover rotisserie chicken I had from night before.  Yes, a whole 7 oz can of  7oz chipotle pepper makes it s little spicy, but that suits our taste.   Also, I added a couple teaspoons of cinnamon powder to mis while it simmered in pan for 20 minutes.  Kids loved it.

It was ok. The recipe makes a really big batch good for parties but I only used half the chicken suggested since my family is small. It’s spicy so I would not add the whole can of adobo right away. It’s better to chop the onions smaller otherwise it’s tricky to eat. It was easy and simple. But not something I grew up eating so it’s not something I’m used to. I don’t think I’ll make this again.

Very good flavor.  Very easy to make.  There's quite a kick to it.  I like spicy, but next time I may cut down on the peppers just a bit.  Sour cream is a must.  Thank you!

Unfortunately, the stewed tomatoes make it very sweet and if your palette isn't used to it, can be off putting. Like ketchup chicken. Possibly consider not using canned stewed tomatoes if you don't want it to be so sweet.

This is wonderful with just the right amount of heat.  I use this tinga for making lettuce wraps.  I top the lettuce with the tinga, bean sprouts, shredded carrots and chia seeds.  Great tasting and thank you Fredda for posting.

I loved this recipe.  Our family is Mexican American, but I don't remember anybody ever making this one.  Will definitely try using canela in it next time like the other poster mentioned.  (Used my hand mixer to shred the hot chicken, worked really well!)

This was GREAT! My first time making it, and I followed directions, but also followed the advice of other reviews by adding a little extra salt and cinnamon. FANTASTIC! The only thing I would do different is add some creamy avocado slices on top and drink a ice cold tecate with it! ;)

This is really good. I just cooked the raw chicken breast in the sauce then shredded it. I didn't think it was too hot, on the contrary, I added more hot peppers. This freezes well! Thank you for the recipe.

One of the first recipes I tried from this site, and I keep coming back to it time and again.  We use half a can of the peppers for slightly less heat, but otherwise don't change a thing!

Followed advice of others, didn't use the whole can of adobo peppers. Instead I used 4 and a little of the sauce. I like heat and it was plenty hot, perfect w/a little cotija. I added a 1/4 tsp cinnamon, also as suggested. Smell was great, but the dish seemed sweet as a result. Will use less next time.

Now this is a classic! I absolutely love this recipe, and it IS how momma used to make it....except for one thing. I would highly recommend adding some already cooked chorizo to the onions before adding the Chipotle and Adobo sauce. Trust me, you will LOVE IT! Adds a bit more flavor to the dish.

Loved this! Delicious flavor. We like a little bit of spice so just 1 1/2 peppers and three teaspoons of adobe were perfect for us. Will definitely make again.

this was really good and really easy. Note to self though, do not use stewed toms that are in chiles and green peppers. WAYYY to spicy for me. We used this to make tortas and it was so delicious! Will be also using it for sandwiches and salads since it made a lot. Made with a guacamole salad and it was divine! Thanks!

Like some others I mixed it up a bit we like spice but I took advice of "to taste" and started out with two chipoltes and some of the sauce, using the crockpot. Also used some Adobe seasoning, thin sliced sweet onion, minced fresh garlic and some green tomatillo verde,(which means green tomato) instead of the stewed tomatoes. Did use the rest of the recipe as written. We had them as hard and soft tacos, with fresh lettuce, tomato and crema- delicious. I've spent a lot of time in Mexico and have yet to meet a Tinga (chicken, pork, beef, ground beef) I didn't like. I know someone said cinnamon, but I've never tasted that in the Mexican regions I've had Tinga in.

Chicken tinga is one of my favorites and this is a great recipe!  I added a couple of  garlic cloves and some sea salt which helped cut the acid from the tomato and the dish was superb.  Aside from topping this on a tostada this is also a great filling for tacos and tamales.  One of my favorite Mexican joints in LA rolls this up in a burrito and it's insane!

That's a lot of chipotle!  I only added the adobo sauce and it was still too spicy. Next time I'm going to add a little bit at a time until it's just right.

thank you so much, fredda.  I have never heard of tinga, let alone tasted it.  I read the recipe and decided it was something my family would love, and I was right.  I did change it up a bit by cooking it in a croc pot, adding juice of a lime, abt 2t of cumin, and a small bunch of chopped cilantro.  this was soooooooooooooooo delicious and easy, I can't thank you enough.  used tostada shells, then placed a bit of shredded lettuce on the bottom, then some chopped roma tomatoes, the tinga, and topped with some Mexican crema, a spoonful of guacamole, a spoonful of salsa, and some chopped green onions.  hot sauce available for those who wanted it.  soooooo good.  thank you so very much for sharing this family recipe.

We love, love, love this recipe for leftover chicken!  This is easy and delicious.  We like the heat, so it works for us.  If you don't like it spicy, you might not want to use much adobo sauce,and don't use any of the peppers, before tasting it.  Do what your diners like as far as heat goes.  Great recipe!  Thanks Fredda :) Got any more family favorites for us?

Delish! Only change I made was to add fresh tomato to the chipotle mixture and when boiling the chicken I added onion and garlic to the water.

My husband liked it, and he hates eating chicken. I used Mexican crema instead of sour cream and also garnished with avocado. That cut some of the heat. It was very spicy, but my husband is Mexican and doesn't like food unless it hurts! I used about 5 or 6 of the chipotle peppers. I also added a cinnamon stick (considering the other reviews) during the last 10 minutes of cooking. I would've added it sooner but was hesitant because I wasn't sure if my husband would like the cinnamon. I just didn't tell him it was in there!

Instead of canned tomatoes, I just boil 3-5 fresh tomatoes in the chicken stock for about 3-5 minutes (until the peels crack for easy removal). Then I puree with only 1/4 of the can of chipotle.  Additional toppings: cotija cheese or fresh goat cheese, and shredded lettuce.  Also, try smearing the sour cream on the tostada shell before topping it.  Great recipe though.

This was delicious and so easy! I used a rotisserie chicken which made it super fast (and tender). I used half the can of chipotle, and the spice level was perfect. I followed the recommendation to put a cinnamon stick in, but probably didn't put enough (only a 2.5 inch stick), so I might try more next time. I don't like tostadas, so I just put the mixture on soft corn tortillas with grated cheddar, cilantro, and sour cream. My fiance loved it, and he's the foodie between us!

SUPERB!! Absolutely delicious! I used fresh tomatoes and put it all in the crock pot for about 5 hours on low. Once the meat cooled, I discarded the fat, bones and skins and shredded the meat by hand. I then returned the chicken to the tomato sauce that it cooked in. I made tostadas with this meat topped it off with avocado & queso fresco. AMAZING!!!!  I will be making this again and again!

Very easy to prepare and tasty! I was in a rush and did not puree the tomatoes with the chipotle peppers. I minced 2 chipotle peppers, added them in the stewed tomatoes and added about 1.5 Tbsp of the adobo sauce in the mixture. Great tasting! Would definitely make it again, and thanks for the recipe!!

Very good. I stuck the chicken into a crockpot and the peppers, and added an extra can of stewed tomatoes, and then the sauteed onions in it. And I cooked it on high for around 5 hours and it was delicious. Except there were WAY too many peppers in it for my liking, but I brought it into my Spanish class for a fiesta, and my professor LOVED it. As did everyone else in the class that enjoys spicy food. My professor said it was just like back home, and absolutely delicious. So maybe next time I'll only put in like one or two of the peppers and see how it goes!

OMG! Great recipe! Both my husband and I loved it. I will be making this recipe again and again. The only thing that I changed was instead of canned stewed tomato's I cooked my own tomatos in some water. And it worked out great.

This was a great, easy recipe. Nice and spicy. The meat is great for tacos too, or by itself. I'll make this again for sure.

I made this exactly as written.  I added 2 cloves of garlic and used half of the chipotle can.  I thought it was going to be uber spicy, but it was not.  I did think it was a little flat and next time I will add salt and some more spices.  I also did this in the crock pot and it worked well.  Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor!!  A nice change from the regular tostadas!  Loved the flavor the chipotle peppers give.  Served with avocado slices, shredded cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and green sauce!!

Loved this idea, and used it as a springboard for what I had on hand.  I just took the meat off a roasted chicken from the deli, chopped it in the food processor, put it and 1 1/2 c. salsa, 1 can tomato sauce, 2 TBS taco seasoning in a sauce pan and heated it up.  Served on a tostada with lettuce, tomatoe, cheese and sour cream.  Yum.  No, I didn't make this recipe, but it was a great idea starter!!

This was made for a dinner party and was very well received. Used one small can of "Herdez" Chipotle and it was hot, but would only give it a 7/10 on the heat scale. We will make this again, but if you dont like spicy food, this isn't for you.

I wasn't a big fan of this, and hubby just flat out refused to try it. I only used about 4 chipotle peppers, and it was too spicy for me. I was really excited about trying this recipe, so I'm not sure why it didn't go over well.

Very tasty.  I just suggest to cut back pretty significantly on the peppers if you are not accustomed to hot food.  We only used about 2/3 of the can, and it was still very hot.  We will cut it back more next time.

I have a friend who used to make tinga and I always loved it. I made this recipe the other day and it was really good.  I used just under half of the can of chipotles and adobo sauce and it was spicy but not unbearable. I would probably use even less if I made this for guests. I just boiled and shredded a few frozen chicken breasts and added them when called for in the recipe. This is definitely one of my new favorite recipes and it is really easy!

Yummmmmy!  I only put in 4 of the adobo chilies to control the heat.  I pureed them with the tomatoes and sauteed onions. I also added a clove of garlic.  Then threw this into the crock pot with the chicken and one can of chicken broth for about 6 hours.  The chicken literally fell apart and it had an incredibly wonderful flavor!!!  I served on the tostada shell with lettuce and a southwestern (corn, tomato and black bean) salsa.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

This was really good! I used maybe 2 chipotle peppers and some sauce and also made rice to give people options. In addition to just eating it with warm corn tortillas, it was good with rice added to the tortillas and just on top of rice. Will be making again!

Very good base, but needs a little something more to make it a 5 star.  I am thinking of making a black bean/corn combo up and adding it to the tortillas with the meat.

I live in France now and I really crave Mexican food. I decided to make this for my husband and his French friends and they loved it!! It is a delicious and authentic recipe. I just added a bit of salt and pepper and a dash of chicken bouillon when I mixed it. Voila!

This was good. Needs salt. I actually like it better using left over rotisserie chicken.  I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of just plain stewed tomatoes. I can't imagine using all the chipotle though. I love it, but I actually just use the sauce that the chiles are in. Really helps tame the heat but still nice and smoky. To cut back on fat I baked corn tortillas at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes. I lightly sprayed them with olive oil spray first. They came out nice and crunchy. I have made this many times on the stove. When I attempted to use the slow cooker, I wasn't happy with the results. It came out way too soupy.

This dish is super easy. It is spicy in a smoky kind of way. I layered refried beans and corn on the tostado (with the chicken mixture and sour cream) and it was great! Warmed up great the next day as well!

Would have been a five if I hadn't had to alter the recipe slightly.  On the advice of the other reviewers, I used less chipotle, only half of the 7 oz can.  Because I also didn't have enough chicken to make the full batch, I threw in a can of black beans, which was a yummy addition, though this would certainly still be excellent without it!

Really good and very easy to make!  I poached some skinless boneless chicken breasts and they fell apart (shredded) very nicely.  It is very spicy and leaves a nice after burn! This is too easy and yummy for you NOT to try! :D

This recipe has become one of my favorites. I make this often with baked chicken leftovers.  I have recently started making burritos with this mixture and some white rice and black beans, it is fab that way. 

Very glad that I stumbled across this recipe!
