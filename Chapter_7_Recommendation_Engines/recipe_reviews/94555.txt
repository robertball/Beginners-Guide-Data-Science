I took the seeds from 2 large pumpkins and rinsed them off in water in a colander.  then I poured some vegetable oil in the colander and quickly swished the seeds around to coat them.  you could do this easier in a bowl but I was hurrying.  I then spread them on two large cookie sheets with parchment paper on them and liberally sprinkle McCormick's Season All (seasoned salt) and then bake in the oven at 300.  I put one sheet on the bottom rack and the other on the top rack and swtich them every 15 min.  total roasting time is about 45 or so as I like mine on the crispier side.  I do not take the time to remove every shred of pumkin from the seeds as that is my favorite part when it roasts.  it is a nice addition to the crunch of the seeds to have the "fried" pumpkin strands there too.

This was very good! Okay...I didn't have any Old Bay Seasoning, so I used seasoned salt instead. I loved it!!! Never thought to use anything but plain old salt. Now I'll have to try other pumpkin seed recipes. Maybe I'll use smoked paprika next time! Also...I didn't need to use any oil because I lined a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Worked great!

I gutted our 40 pound pumpkin this morning for my hubster to carve tonight and went looking for a different seed recipe. I didn't measure my seeds and just added what I thought was a nice amount of Old Bay. I wanted different and this it was! Really good Jolly-Holly and thank you!!

This is a good seasoning for pumpkin seeds.  Although they have more flavor if you don't rinse them.  Just clean them as best you can, allow to almost dry. I use a couple tablespoons of butter instead of spray.  Also, saw a reviewer trying to separate the seeds from the shell.  Just pop em in your mouth, no need to remove the shell!

Old Bay is good for more than just seafood! I used 1 1/2 tbsp of butter instead of spray and they were YUMMY! We will make these again next Halloween.

Delish!!  My new favorite.  I did use a little olive oil instead of the cooking spray because I thought the seasoning would stick better.  I'm going to go cut open some more pumpkins!!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Really nice twist. The seasoning gave it a interesting blend of flavors. If I try this again, I will soak the seeds before roasting them to make them more plump.  I didn't soak them, so the seeds were very small & hard to separate from the shell,but yummy anyways :-)

I would suggest not rinsing the pumpkin seeds.  You will be amazed at how delicious they are with the pumpkin 'goo' still on them when they have been roasted.  I actually just pull the seeds out of the pumpkin, remove the strings, sprinkle with salt and into the oven they go.  When golden they are ready to eat.  Try it, it is really good.

Haven't ever made pumpkin seeds before.  Super easy and tasty.  Didn't have Old Bay, so as some noted I used seasoning salt. Lacked a little flavor, just need to over do the seasoning a bit and they'd be perfect.

I didn't dry the seeds after I rinsed them.  I had 2 cups of seeds.  Used 1 tbsp butter + 1 tbsp olive oil + 1/8 cup of Old Bay and tossed that along with the seeds  in a bowl to coat all of the seeds evenly before spread them evenly on the cookie sheet.  Flipped the seeds half way (approx 15 min) through the cooking time.  Great idea on a twist to pumpkin seeds - thank you!

Tried this recipe for the first time Halloween 2011.  My husband, who claimed to "not like toasted pumpkin seeds" all of a sudden had a change of heart after tasting this recipe!  In fact, here it is November 13th and we spent a good part of the day trying to find a farm market still selling pumpkins so we could whip up another batch!  I melted 2 tbsp. butter and tossed with the Old Bay.  I toast mine for about 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees to bring them to crunchy perfection!  Love this recipe and will pass it down to my kids!

Using paper towels to dry pumpkin seeds is a BIG mistake. The seeds will stick and will be ruined. A better idea is to let air dry on waxed paper.

These are good.  Hard to rate pumpkin seeds as great, but we enjoyed these.  Didn't really measure it out, but they turned out fine.

Great flavor if you want to try something different.  I soaked the seeds in salt water for a few hours then dried them off.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  My husband loved them.  Super easy!  Thanks.

My (12 yr old) step-son wanted to carve a pumpkin this past Halloween just to roast the seeds.  This was easy and fun to do and he LOVED eating the seeds.

I will definitely make these again! I love Old Bay and it is a perfect seasoning to pep up regular old seeds.  I roasted them for 35 min and they're perfect.

Pumpkin seeds with a kick. I put a little extra in my double batch. They are popping like rice krispies right after I took them out. They are awesomely delicious.

Living in Maryland I'm familiar with the taste and relationship Old Bay  has in Maryland homes and restaurants. Yet this was a first for me. So yummy and easy. My family LOVED it.

I found it very difficult to keep the Old Bay on the seeds, and in the end had seeds which didn't have much flavor. They would likely be better if the seeds were soaked in oil or butter with the Old Bay before cooking.
