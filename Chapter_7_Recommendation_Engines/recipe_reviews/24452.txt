I love this recipe!  I use 4 cups of flour, instead of 5 to give them a bit more of a chewy texture.  Sometimes I add 1/4 cup of lemon juice to give them a kick!

This is VERY (granny's calls for 4 1/2 cups of flour)similar to the recipe my grandmother has made for decades.  The nutmeg is the best part of these tasty cookies.  It isn't Christmas without them.

I was trying to find a sour cream cookie recipe like my mom used to make.  This seemed pretty close so I tried it. I did not care for this recipe at all.  The nutmeg is overpowering and the cookie has a strange consistency.  We made these on Christmas Eve last year and my 4 year old was afraid Santa wouldn't leave her any toys because the cookies were "so yucky".  My mom has since found her old recipe and sent it to me.  No more yucky cookies for Santa this year.

I used butter instead of margarine and they came out with a nice, soft texture with a great buttery flavor. I ended up putting the dough in the fridge and not baking them until two days later, and they still turned out really well. I used fresh grated nutmeg, too. We really love these cookies--the sour cream really makes them soft, and the nutmeg gives these a really nice subtle flavor. I'll make these from now on--they also kept their shape really well.

I used this recipe to bake cookies for some friends and they were a huge hit!  The cookies kept a great shape after baking and they stayed soft for several days (until they were all eaten ;).  The nutmeg in the recipe is also a nice touch.

I loved these cookies!!  They're REALLY good when you roll the cookies out thick.  They reminded me of the Christmas cookies my family made when I was a kid.

I had misplaced my recipe for sugar cookies with sour cream. I think I have found a new family favorite. YUM! This is a tender, sweet with a hint of nutmeg cookie. Thank you!

I thought these cookies were awesome.  They need a lot of frosting for flavor.  They are very fluffy and soft.  Easy to work with.

I hadn't had nutmeg in sugar cookies before, and I didn't particularly like it.  I wouldn't try making the cookies without it, though, because they would probably be really bland like so many sour cream sugar cookie recipes are.  The good thing is that they bake up very well.  The cookies really hold their shape instead of spreading and getting too poofy.  They're also a nice, soft cookie.  But I'll stick with my normal sugar cookie recipe because I just didn't like the flavor of these that much.  If you grew up on sugar cookies flavored with nutmeg, you might like them more than I did.

This recipe turned out pretty good. I thought that it was a little bland, so I gave them 4 stars. The cookies tasted better the next day.

Great recipe!  Two things: Use almond extract in place of vanilla; the flavor is heavenly.  No exaggeration.  And I used plain yogurt (I was out of our cream; it worked fine).  One last thing: I used whole wheat flour (I use ww flour for everything.) And they turned out great.  For the ww newcomer, you might try half white, half whole wheat.  Any recipe with sour cream or yogurt in it is ideal for whole wheat; milk products keep whole wheat cookies soft.

I really liked this recipe for cut out sugar cookies.  I used the "sugar cookie icing" from JBS Box for the icing and the cookies turned out amazing!  They looked so professional. The dough for me wasn't the easietst to work with, but I found the it truly needs to be chilled for a few hours. I used 1/2 confectioner's sugar and 1/2 flour to get the dough not to stick.  In my opionion, any cut out cookie you make requires some common sense when working with the dough.  Whatever recipe you work with, be prepared to put some time and effort into it.  Also, I loved the nutmeg flavor.  It reminded me of cookies from my childhood.  My new stand by recipe!

These cookies are great! They're very soft and stay that way for days. The dough is pretty hard to work with though. Make sure you do refrigerate it overnight. I roll my dough out on wax paper sprinkled with powedered sugar instead of flour. Too much flour will make them hard. I omitted the nutmeg and used 1 Tablespoon of orange rind. This gives the cookies a great flavor, and it smells so good! I prefer to frost them with a fluffy buttercream frosting flavored with vanilla or almond.

I thought these were perfect cookies. I like them because they are not too sugary. I didn't think they were too bland. They were just right when you put a little frosting on them. I can see that they might not be as good if you didn't add a little frosting, but why wouldn't you? They held their shape well. We also didn't want to wait over night and stuck the dough in the freezer for a bit, and they worked pretty good.

Pretty good, the nutmeg was really strong.  Next time I will use less (as other reviewers suggested) or omit all together.

I'm sorry but I wasn't very impressed with these cookies.  I followed the directions completely but the dough smelled like Play-doh and the baked cookies had a bland taste and weird texture.  They weren't like any sugar cookie I had ever tried.  I do have to give them three stars because they definitely held their shape during baking and were easy to decorate.

I have been searching for this recipe!!!  It is delicious.  An elderly lady used to make these for me and bring them into my workplace every Christmas, and they were always so wonderful!!!  Unexpectedly she passed away and I was never able to ask her for her cherished recipe.  Now I will think of her even more at the holiday time while I am making these with my children now.

This is definitely a new holiday staple. I used almond in the royal frosting and in the cookie dough which added a surprising delight. Eyebrow raising delicious! I agree that frosting is necessary on this one.

I love this recipe. It's my go-to for sugar cookies. They stay light and chewy, rather than harden. I omit the nutmeg, just for personal preference.

I did not care for this recipe. Made exactly as wirtten.  My dough was refrigerated overnight per recipe.  Very skeptical after I made it if it would work and to my dismay, it didn't.  The dough was sooooo crumbly I could not get it to come together enough to roll out.  Sorry, I had high hopes for it too. Ended up going with "Christmas Cut-Out Cookie" recipe instead.  Which worked for me.

Great recipe, My mother-in-law was a great baker. She has passed now and I never did get her recipe but this is so close. I omitted the nutmeg and added 1 teaspoon almond extract. Really close to hers!!! Merry Christmas!
