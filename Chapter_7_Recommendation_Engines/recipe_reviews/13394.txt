I made this about two weeks ago and forgot to review! I used a whole cooked chicken from the deli department at the supermarket and shredded as much meat as I could while my two children attacked the wings and legs. I like more chicken in my soup. I absolutely adore the chinese restaurant's version of this and I have to say that this is exactly the same! I added the sesame oil a drop at a time and it added a lovely smoky flavour. I would have only used about 10 drops. Follow this recipe and you'll have a delicious chicken soup. I froze the remainder in freezer bags and just put it in a large bowl with cold water to cover to defrost and have it for lunch. Yum! Oh and I didn't have cornflour so I used regular and had to add a lot more to reach a thicker consistency. To do this make sure you put the flour in a bit of cold water first and mix it up before pouring in the soup.

I thought this soup was very good! I love eating this at chinese restaurants. Yummy!

I followed the recipe as directed except for a few minor things. I used 2 small chicken breasts which equaled about 1 cup of shredded chicken instead of 1/2 c. I used black pepper instead of white as that is what I had on hand. I also used two egg whites instead of one. 

I don't think these changes altered the taste any, just made the soup more hearty!

I did make one tactical error. I added the whole tablespoon of sesame oil at once instead of adding it a drop at the time. For our personal tastes I think the 1 T is a little more than we like, so you might want to follow the directions and add a drop or two at the time. 

This is a definate keeper for us. Thanks!!!!!

My husband and I had this soup in a chinese restaurant in Canada and my husband just LOVED it and kept on asking if I could find a recipe to make that same soup.  This soup is EXACTLY like that soup we had in Canada, the restaurant also served it with the vinegar and chili peppers.  I think that makes the soup even better.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This soup was very interesting! "It tastes like a soup option at a Chinese restaurant." I had some cooked chicken already in the fridge. It took less than 10 minutes to make this. For the broth I mixed 2 cups of water up with a couple packets of no-sodium chicken broth packets and then added my own salt to taste. I still thought it was a tad salty though, I am guessing from the creamed corn. There is not much chicken or whole corn in this. It is more like egg drop soup with a little bit of those two added ingredients. I chopped up the green onions and added them on top. I then just added the rest to the pot. I liked that this made only 4 servings, even though I seemed to eat half of it. Don't subtitute the sesame oil, it gave it a characteristic taste.

I have made this soup several times for my husband.  He grew up eating chicken corn soup and had such a hard time finding the soup that I decided to make it for him.  He absolutely loves it and cant get enough of it.  The recipe is extremely easy and just about fool-proof.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Wow!  This was fantastic!  Much better than what we had recently bought at our little Mom-and-Pop Chinese restaurant.  And so easy to make.    I doubled the chicken.  It was still pretty thin, so I added a can of whole kernel corn  over and above the creamed corn.  I doubled the amount of egg white as well.  I guess we like a full-bodied soup.  Mama liked the soup plain, but my husband and I both loved it with both the scallions and the pepper infused vinegar added to the bowl at the table.  Thank you for such a fabulous, quick, and easy recipe.

Made as directed in the recipe. The kids all liked it. Instead of chicken, I would use crab meat for variety. Thank you for posting.

I love this soup. I first had it at a California Chinese cuisine chain called Chin-Chin, which added ground chicken meat and glass noodles, so this is how I make it. Both the glass noodles and the ground meat cook really fast, so make sure to add them close to the end, but before the egg. As per another reviewer's suggestion I added the egg after the cornstarch, which I thought was a mistake. I actually like those clumpy eggs in my soup, isn't that how egg flower soup is supposed to be? Top this with some chopped green onion for an amazing taste explosion.

I make this soup at least 2 times a month.  I love soup and this is definitely high up on my list because it is so easy to make.  I add a teaspoon of vinegar and some fresh scallions to each bowl before serving.  DELICIOUS!!

Pretty easy and good.  My only complaint is it kind of lacked flavor. Maybe I'll try a little more sesame oil or something.  Still, very good!

This was a very good soup although I did alter the recipe to suit my own taste.  I used one 36oz. carton of chicken broth and 1.5 c of cooked chicken.  I also added a little onion powder and about 3/4c. each of chopped baby carrots and frozen peas.  Next time I might add an additional can of creamed corn.

we just loved this soup. I had some extra grilled chicken breast in the freezer, I thawed these out and shredded them and added to the soup. I will be sure to grill extra chicken from now on. This soup was even great the next day for lunch.

This was very simple to make.  Instead of just 1/2 cup of chicken, I used 1 12.5 oz can of shredded chicken to save time.  I also I added a few cups of kale to mine for some extra veggies.

I have made this twice now. The first time accidentally with beef broth, but we love it with beef or chicken. My husband and I eat the whole pot of it every time. It's so fast and easy, and the ingredients are ones that we have on hand most of the time. I used a rotisserie chicken for the meat. Thanks for sharing.

This soup was great! I did make some adjustments. I listened to other reviewers and used only a few drops of sesame oil. I also added 1 cup of shredded chicken, 1 cup of diced ham, 2 eggs, and 1 (8 oz.) can of corn, drained.

I made this for a teacher's dinner today, out of 5 soups, my soup was the only one that's all gone!! Thank you for a great recipe. I did not add sesame oil and egg white, and I add another half can of cream of corn soup and half can of corn kernels. And I use chicken stock instead of chicken broth, and use chicken stock instead of water to dilute the cornstarch.

Wow is all I can say!!!!  For the simplicity of this recipe, it really is outstanding!!!  I added a lot of extra chicken - probably a full cup shredded.  Also, I went way over on the egg whites - probably added around four.  It was absolutely delicious and my teenage sons did not leave a drop for leftovers.  Thanks abuch for this great recipe!!!

This was great - I added less sesame oil and more pepper since I like it that way.  I also added a little more egg whites.  Tastes like the restaurant version

As close to restaurant food as you can get.  We really enjoyed this recipe!
I did like the other raters and used 1 cup of chopped chicken, 2 egg whites and added the sesame oil to taste.
Thank you for this keeper.

I love this! it's just like my favorite Chinese restaurant. Sometimes chicken cirn soup can be a bit bland, but thus is perfection. 

I tend to use it as a main dish rather than a side, so I'll add more chicken and more egg white. I pair it with cucumber salad or green salad with ginger dressing.

I used ingredients I had so I cooked 2 chicken breasts inthe oven for 20 minutes then cut themup & added to the soup. I threw in some orzo pasta (1/2 cup) and boiled for 7 minutes before I added the sesame oil and cornstarch mixture.   I also added red peppers that I sliced and cooked with the chicken.  I didn't have cream corn so I used a can of regular corn drained.  At the end I just added a little bit (maybe 1/2 cup) of whole milk.  It was delicious!  Loved the color the red pepper & scallions added to it, just wish I took the time to take a picture of it first!

Delicious! I used black pepper instead of white, & I used smoked salt.  I agree that 1 T of sesame oil was too much - will use half next time.  Chopped the chicken up very finely to blend with corn & scallion bits.  The perfect soup for a night when I'm not supposed to chew due to dental work! Enjoy!

Quick to make and delicious, what's not to love? I don't like spicy food, so this soup suited my taste very well. Chopped green onions on top are a must though. I will definitely make this again. Maybe I'll add noodles, since my daughter missed them.

This soup was okay & Hubs liked it, but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the corn that I didnt like...it seemed to clash with the sesame oil in my opinion.  I never eat creamed corn and bought a can specifically to make this soup...maybe I just don't like the flavor of it.   I think I will stick with plain egg drop soup without the corn.  I like that it is low fat, but think I prefer similar soup without corn.   Sorry SONA86...

making again, so easy. Will add more corn this time as suggested. My husband kept going to freezer looking for more. I froze in bags as suggested. Made triple batch this time.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have the sesame oil but otherwise I made as written, doubling the recipe.  Next time I'll make the vinegar mixture.

This was easy to make and really good!  Only change I made was adding a few drops of soy sauce to my bowl for added flavor.
