A good meal easy to prepare for busy nights and to please mac and cheese lovers. My kids enjoyed it very much. They love Kraft's mac and cheese. I cut the amount of bread crumbs almost in half as, in my opinion, the amount was excessive. I only used half of the spam meat that is suggested in the recipe.

I made this recipe but tweaked it a little. I used a small box of elbows Macaronis. I added a little more milk into it as well. The spam I cooked it a little in a pan. I added cheese into it as well. The family loved it. The reason why I gave it a four stars is because Iâ€™m not a spam person. Besides that hubby and son loved it. All in All I would make it for them again if they asked. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

We weren't sure what to do with our leftover spam but this recipe jumped out at me just in time.  I added a pit of pepper on a whim and it was loved by all.  The whole fam and the dogs enjoyed this dish!!!!

This was an easy and an "if you're ever in a pinch" go to casserole...I just tweaked it a bit by browning the Spam (low sodium) first then adding Italian seasoning and almost an entire can (14.5 oz.) of petite diced Italian tomatoes. I only had plain bread crumbs on hand, but with adding the seasoning in another way, it worked out. It was quick and good. Another thumbs up from my hubby so , I'll keep this one too! Thanks!

We eat Spam alot and knew this would be a winner with our kids.  We used the Kraft Deluxe dinner , two boxes, and one whole can of Spam 25% less sodium. I did sautee the Spam cubes first as my family loves it cooked and it gave it a bit more depth of flavor. This was quick, easy and my teens were cheering! Paired with a green salad,  you have a great go to meal.
