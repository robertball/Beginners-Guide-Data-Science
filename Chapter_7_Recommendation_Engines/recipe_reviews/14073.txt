I wonder why some people said it has no flavor?  I suspect that they may not have used fresh basil.  I did use chiken broth instead of water and added a little extra garlic, which I always do and it was smooth and creamy.  Not spicy, but everything doesn't have to be!

I added chicken broth instead of the water and eliminated the salt. I also added some shrimp and it was great. Very simple to make. The milk adds a creamy flavor and texture. I will definately make this again.

FABULOUS!  Everyone who I've made it for LOVES it.  I add much more tomatoes and a bit more corn so everyone has a bite of vegetables.  I also add more sliced basil to the final product.

As suggested, I made this w/ fresh corn, tomatoes and basil.  VERY tasty!  I'd do about 1/2 cup less water, but otherwise this was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good! I used frozen corn, but a fresh tomato and it turned out well. I only gave it four because I have had mushroom risotto that is better, but this is a nice alternative.

Great taste, easy to make and like an Italian restaurant, does not reheat well as a leftover.

This was good and I felt that it was flavorful. I used fresh tomatoes, frozen corn and extra basil. I also increased the parmesan cheese from 1/2 cup to 1 whole cup. Very good but was a little time consuming having to keep stirring and waiting for the liquid to absorb

I do not like tomatos, so I ommitted those.  Still, this came out almost perfect.  I thought it had plenty of flavor - just not spicy flavor.  Next time I think I need a little more liquid, because (if possible) it is too creamy...  I plan on serving it tonight with the recipe for Mozzarella Parmesean Chicken.

I agree with others that milk is not part of a traditional risotto, but I liked this method.  I did feel that the flavors were not great together and there was far too much corn.  I subbed broth for water, doubled garlic, and increased white wine.  Next time I will render a couple of tbsps minced bacon or pancetta with the onion, reduce corn, and leave out the tomato and basil altogether.  Another tip - soften onions on a medium flame, increase to high just before adding rice, toast 2 minutes, then follow recipe as written.  Cook time for me was about 30 minutes.  Perfect with shrimp.

This gem of a recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for ten years!  I could have been enjoying it for all this time.  In any case, I am glad I took the opportunity to whip this up - it is amazing!  I forgot to pick up fresh corn, so used canned sweet corn, and it was still sooooo yummy!  I did use a fresh tomato and basil from the garden. It is creamy and delicous and not difficult to make!  I'm thrilled to have discovered it!

I thought this was just ok. Risotto shouldn't get its creaminess from milk or cream but from the type or rice used (arborio or carnaroli). Also, I didn't think corn was the best complement to basil and parmesan. Definitely not that much corn, anyway!

very good! As suggested, I used chicken broth instead of water and omitted the salt.  Next time I will chop the tomatoes smaller. Very nice flavor...not too heavy as some risotto recipes tend to be a bit on the salty/overly seasoned side.

This is a very nice little recipe. I followed most directions, except, I made the water vegetable broth, and used frozen corn and canned tomato. Came out great!  As per other reviews, there is NOT too much liquid in this recipe. This dish takes about 45-50 minutes to soak up all of this liquid, so perhaps it's the author's timing that's throwing people off. Be patient.

Not a bad base, but needs a little help. I started with using veggie stock instead of water, but the risotto still had little flavor while cooking. I added a lot of pepper, a couple sprinklings of herbs de province, and a few twists of this "italian seasonings" grinder. I also added a fair bit of salt to it. I used 2 smaller tomatoes and a LOT of basil. Instead of 1/2c parm, i used a small handful of grated romano. I skipped the corn. The finished product is super tasty, but it did need a lot of help. I recommend it as a great place to start, and it is yours for the tweaking.

Change 1 of the cups of milk to 1 cup whipping cream. Add chicken. Instead of wine, use a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. We used dry basil instead of fresh, and powdered garlic instead of a clove (it was what we had--it would be better with fresh). Also, we just used regular white rice. Delish!

Excellent!  I used canned corn because it is winter! I also used monterrey jack cheese (I know it sounds weird but I have a favorite restaurant that makes a jack risotto that we loooove... try substituting jack for the parm).  Came out soooo well.  Thanks for this excellent idea.  A low budget crowd-pleasing side dish.

This recipe is labor intensive for a side dish.  If you want to give it a go make sure your main dish can be popped in oven and left on a timer. The the recommendation of other reviewers and use chicken broth instead of water.  Bump up the cheese if you like it really creamy. Also, be sure to use a fresh tomato.  Canned tomato turns the rice pink (even if you drain the juices).

I love the basil flavor of this recipe! The only thing I might do differently next time is cook with chicken broth instead of milk. In my experience, it tends to thicken quicker and adds a little more flavor.

This was a great recipe! We don't like mushroos so this recipe was perfect for risotto.  Since it uses milk instead of cream it doesn't have as much fat. I also made this when corn and tomatoes were fresh which made it that much better but will make it again in the winter!

This is fantastic!  Thank you!  I didn't have tomatoes so I put in some salsa instead and also added shrimp.  The texture of the rice was fantastic.  I will definitely make this again!

Wonderful!  It had a great balance of flavor - we didn't have fresh basil so I added a handful of dried, and I used a drained can of corn (it was a bit much, so less than a can next time!) and substituted a bit of chicken broth for the wine.  Added double the Parmesan cheese for our tastes, and it was something the family gobbled up.

It turned out amazing I changed a couple things.  Instead of milk and water I used 5 cups of water and 2 cubes of chicken bouillon  I think it made the rice a lot more flavorful

I never seem to have white win when I need it so I didn't use that, substituted chicken stock for water, a pack of homo milk and a pack of 2%. Half way through before I even added the tomatoes or corn it already tasted so good maybe because I burnt the onions and garlic a bit. I added some left over shrimp to it, which makes this a good leftover recipe also like if you have rotisserie chicken or salmon. Yummy!

This recipe is wonderful! Very flavorful if you use mostly fresh ingredients. I used frozen corn, but everything else was fresh.   I would not reccomend following Julia Child's advice that more butter is always better. This is quite rich so I would reccommend using the prescribed amount or slightly less. You can also use a little extra veggies too.   I would just advise that you be patient if you have not made risotto before, because this can take about an hour. If you want leftovers, double the recipe, and follow the instructions of putting basil in RIGHT at the end before serving. You could put a lot of extra basil in and it would still taste great.   Oh, and I agree with the other reviewers who replaced water with chicken broth.

I usually subscribe to the "don't post about all of the changes you made to the recipe", but I wanted to share the alterations I made (some not planned) that resulted in a super tasty dish.  I used chicken stock instead of water, which I think gave it a pretty robust flavor considering I used skim milk.  Also, I killed the tomatoes while I was trying to chop them, so the next logical step would be to replace the tomatoes with bacon, right?  Boy was it good!  Knowing that this recipe should have been made during the summer rather than the end of September, I couldn't find fresh corn in the grocery store, so I used frozen corn, and it seemed to be a good substitute.  I think I may try using sun-dried tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes in the winter, particularly since I wasn't successful in peeling/seeding/chopping the first time around.  Would make this again in a heart beat!

This was fabulous!  Definitely worth the time it took to make.  The milk broth makes it rich and creamy.  Even my two-year-olds loved it!

OUTSTANDING. I hardly ever give five stars. Bursting with tomato and corn flavor. I added some cooked, peeled shrimp in the last five minutes, just to warm up. Yumyumyum!

I used sun-dried tomatoes (which I let rehydrate in the risotto while cooking), kernels from some leftover BBQ roasted corn, a whole pack of fresh basil, and canned vegetable broth. I wanted to lick the bowl.  I have been cooking risottos regularly for several years,and this is now in my top three (along with a simple asparaus and lemon, and butternut squash and sage.) Use fresh produce and real parmaigiano reggiano.  Soooo good.

This is a delicious recipe! I only had 1/2 cup of milk so I used chicken broth to make up for the milk I didn't have and it came out great. Definitely have to use fresh basil in this, it's fabulous.  I might throw in some chicken and balsamic vinegar next time. I think this recipe can be played around with a lot, very versatile.

I have mixed reviews of this one. This recipe was very time-consuming, but didn't taste too bad. Note, you might want to use all fresh vegetables for this dish. Risottos just aren't the same when the veggies are canned.

I thought this recipe was really delicious. I didn't have any basil, but I used sundried tomato and basil flavoured mozzarella instead of the parmesan and a good sprinkling of Italian seasoning, so that seemed to work instead.
The only complaint I have is the use of milk--risotto always gets creamy without milk, and I didn't find the milk made that much of a difference. It just made the dish heavier than it needed to be. I'll make this again for sure--but with chicken stock instead of milk.

I used frozen corn with this one, and added chicken to it. It's alot of stirring, and time, but is well worth it! It's so creamy, and delicious! I would recommend trying this one! Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  I have never used milk in risotto before.  I did add 2 chicken boullion cubes to the water-milk pot; knowing that milk and water alone wouldn't flavor the rice.  Just by making that tweak the risotto came out beautifully.  It was as very DELISH treat.  I will make it again.

This was my first ever attempt and risotto and it came out awesome!!  Only problem was that I don't think I had the heat high enough because I still had about half the milk mixture left after 15 mins of cooking the risotto.  The heat needs to stay at med-high.  As many other reviewers suggested, I did double the garlic and also used chicken broth instead of water.  I served this with italian sausage.  Hubby loved this and my 4 year old daughter enjoyed it as well.

No flavor at all. It might have been better with chicken broth instead.  The shrimp I added couldn't help the flavor. I will throw out the left overs, not worth saving.

Inedible due to ratio of corn to rice and tomatoes, way way too much corn.  Risotto itself is good, made much better by replacing water with chicken broth, replacing 1/4 cup of milk with white wine.

This dish is AMAZING and has so much flavor! I have given the recipe to my mother and sister who make it regularly. I make it exactly as is and have superb results everytime. And do not be afraid - this does not take nearly as long as you may think and find that I am able to prep a salad while the risotto cooks. Thanks for the recipe!

I went right by the recipe with the exception of the corn and Parmesan (I added more of both).  Served it with a store bought rotisserie chicken (which could be added to the dish itself) and it was a hit with the family.  I will definitely make this again.

This is the third time I have made risotto. The parm is delicious.  Make sure you use a large shallow skillet as opposed to a large pot. (I use a dutch oven.) It was creamy and you just have to keep stirring and slowly adding the liquid.  I would have given 5 stars for taste but having to stand in front of the stove for 35 minutes stirring is not a five-star recipe for me. Next time, I will add some crumbled sausage (or leftover grilled chicken) to make it a one dish meal.

This is the first risotto recipe I've ever used, and it was easier to make than I thought! All of the flavors work so well together. We didn't have Arborio rice, so I made it with white rice and it still turned out great!!

This is a good recipe.  It has plenty of flavor with fresh basil.  Next time I am going to try toasting the fresh corn prior to adding it.

This was delicious!  Both my husband and I thought it was great.  I used fat free milk and light butter and it had a nice creaminess.  I also used fresh corn and tomatoes from the farm share and fresh basil.  I will say I did cook it about 15 minutes after adding the veggies and next time I might cook it longer before adding them (20 or 25 minutes instead of 15).  Thanks!

I love risotto, even though it takes time and love to make it right - and this one reminds me of a risotto we had at Emeril's restaurant a few years back.  I did substitute half and half for the milk to make it creamier and frozen corn to keep it easy - otherwise, this is a wonderful dish we've enjoyed several times.

This was really good.  I could eat it several times a week.  The only suggestion I have is to be careful of how much liquid you add to the risotto.  If I would have put all the remaining liquid in the risotto like the recipe suggested, I would have had risotto soup.  After 15 minutes start tasting it to see how close you are getting to the correct consistency.   The add the remaining liquid as necessary.  I almost forgot...I substituted chicken broth for the water for additional flavor.

This is a nice risotto, on the sweet side thanks to the wonderful addition of corn.  I din't peel the tomato, just seeded and chopped it and added it in for the last few minutes.  Next time I'll try substituting chicken broth for the water for a little more savory taste.  Be sure to allow more cooking time than the recipe suggests; it took me about 50 minutes from start to finish.  Don't add the liquid too quickly or cook it over very high heat to try to speed up the absorption of the liquid; risotto always takes a while, but it's worth it!

This was pretty good. I doubled the garlic and didn't put onion (personal preference). My advice would be: DO NOT PANIC at the amount of fluid that goes into this recipe. It should all absorb in the end. Other than that, good recipe-- I will probably make it again.

This is a really marvelous risotto recipe.  I've made it twice...the first time left out the onions just because I didn't have any, and it was absolutely delicious!  I used fresh tomatoes and basil with canned corn (vacuum-packed for extra crispness). BF raved about it, said "this is the best tasting food I've ever had in my mouth!" This coming from the guy who always compliments my cooking; however this recipe bumped me up to 'gourmet chef' status.  I made it again a week later, followed the recipe exactly, except substituted homemade chicken stock (from a rotisserie chicken) for the water.  I didn't think it was possible, but it was even better this time!  BF said "all food should taste like this".

It was delicious and easy to make.  I didn't get tired at all from the stirring.  I used frozen corn, which I didn't think mattered.  I loved the fresh basil in this recipe.

Like the previous reviewer I left out the milk and used vegetable stock. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. A very good risotto which I used as a main dish for the vegetarian in my family and a side for the rest of us. Thankyou.

We're big fans of this recipe.  It is toddler friendly and the fresh corn, tomato and basil make it sooo good.  I used raw corn cut from the cob and added it in to make sure it cooked earlier in the process. Turned out great.  It may give you gas though!  Thanks!

This was the very first time, I ever attempted making risotto.  The final product was absolutely fabulous!  Perfectly creamy, with a rose type sauce, deliciously cheesy, and with the right hint of basil!  I added 1 pound of shrimp, peeled and deveined, with the corn and tomatoes to make it more of a main course entree.  Scallops and salmon would also be fantastic additions. I would like to try it with 2 tomatos the next time I make it.  I used fresh corn on the cob, and a garde fresh tomato.  If I closed my eyes, I could have imagined I were in a fine italian restaurant.

I did make some changes, but what a great idea.  I could have eaten just as the recipe was written, but... I also tweak things to be my own.  I did add fresh tomatoes and corn from the cob - also added a little extra of both.  Used Chicken stock (NOT broth) instead of the water.  Salt the rice when you add it so it absorbs it - just like pasta, you have to salt the water you put it in.  Arborio Rice acts like a pasta.  Fresh basil is the only way to go with this, dried will not give you the taste this dish calls for.  i also used Romano Cheese instead of Parm, I like the pungent taste of Romano - Asiago would work really well too!   At the end, I topped it with diced crispy bacon pieces.   AMAZING!!  This dish is very versatile - thank you so much for your recipe!

It was delicious! But it took longer than 15-18  minutes. I would say more like 30, I use scallions instead of the onion just because I wanted to use them up. Will definitely make again.

This was a good change of pace for risotto. I didn't have fresh corn, so I used a can of chargrilled corn. I also added more garlic and more salt and pepper. I wouldn't use milk in the future. Stick with white wine and chicken broth for a well-flavored and very creamy risotto.

I made this without the corn. I have basil growing like weeds and was looking for a new way to use it.  Instead of water I did use chicken broth like others suggested, as well as a little extra garlic.  This was sublime.  I think it's my new favorite dish.  It's very light for a risotto, full of flavor, and makes you sad when you've taken your last bite.  :(  What do you mean it's all gone??   THANK YOU!!!

I've made this twice in two weeks - I love it!  The only real changes I made was using almond milk the first go-round and a combo of buttermilk and almond milk the second go-round.  I also added some mushrooms that I needed to use to the second batch.  I used veggie broth instead of water, also.  The basil really makes these flavors pop and the leftovers are great.  I will say the first time my husband and I ate the entire dish for dinner so I doubled it the second time for leftovers.  We were eating this as a main dish, though, and were very hungry - ha.
I will make this over and over.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe--it's even better after a couple of days in the fridge.  I didn't bother peeling or seeding the tomatoes, and I used a bit more garlic and corn (used frozen); it was still great.  Since I have a child who has an allergy to casein, I replaced the butter with ghee (casein-free clarified butter), and the milk with plain soy milk.  We just sprinkled the parmesan on top for those of us who could have it.  Next time I might try chicken broth instead of water, as GRANDESA mentioned.  But, either way, this is a beautiful, rich side dish that could even be served as a main course for meatless nights.

I ditched the milk and made this gluten and dairy free - using broth instead of water, canned diced tomatoes instead of milk, and coconut oil instead of butter. I added kale, zucchini, and peas for my veggies. Added some cayenne powder, thyme and Montreal veggie spice in addition to basil. Was a hearty, great tasting meal!

I make risotto often and always start with olive oil so that's what I did here.  I did use the milk and water but halfway through I pulled out some chicken broth and started using that because that's what I'm used to.  Jessica deserves 5 stars because of the wonderful mix-ins, I never would have thought of them on my own, I just prefer a non-dairy risotto (I'll save my dairy for ice cream.)

This was delicious with some changes. First, I didn't add any salt. I used chicken broth instead of water (suggested in other reviews) I used less parmesan cheese because I thought it was a little overpowering. Lastly, I added sauteed chicken and spinach. I'll definitely make this again!

Loved it. I used chicken stock instead of water. It was fabulous.

I made the following changes: 1) used chicken stock in place of the water, 2) used white grape juice in place of the white wine (didn't have any), 3) used 1 cup fresh corn kernels (which was plenty), 4) omitted the Parm (to cut down on the calories), 5) added about 1 cup sliced mushrooms (for a richer flavour), and 6) used used 1 tbsp pesto in place of the fresh basil (didn't have any). Like another reviewer said, this was pretty good, but I've had better risotto. I may make again, with my changes plus a bit more tweaking, including reducing the liquid by 1/2 to 1 cup, as mine turned out rather 'saucy'. Also, I think using chicken stock was a good idea, but I will not add extra salt at the end next time. My biggest issue was the consistency: as mentioned, there was too much sauce, which was very thick, and the rice itself was a little mushy (maybe I overcooked?).  However, flavour was good and overall, a good basic recipe.

This was so good! I prepared this dish as directed with the exception of replacing tomato with zucchini. It turned out fabulous. I ended up stirring it for over 30 minutes, but it was well worth it!

I have tried other corn risotto recipes, and this one beats them all.  Very creamy and full of flavor.  Be sure to salt the fresh corn and tomatoes to bring our their full flavor.  Thanks Jessica!

WOW! I have never made risotto before and this turned out great! It takes a lot of time but is well worth it in the end. I will for sure make this again. ***MADE THIS AGAIN AND USED CHICKEN BROTH IN PLACE FOR MOST OF THE WATER AND I THINK IT HAD MORE FLAVOR.  I JUST LOVE THE FLAVORS IN THIS RISOTTO. IT TASTE LIKE SUMMER****

Very good! I doubled the garlic and put extra basil in it. I also added about half of a container of sliced mushrooms at the same time as I added the corn and tomatoes...awesome!

yum! i used 1.5 times as much butter and 1.25 times as much parmesan. also used frozen corn and veg broth in stead of water. with the amount of water called for, it took a very long time to absorb it all. i would recommend not using as much water as the recipe calls for.

Oh my goodness, this was fabulous!  Absolutely the best risotto, restaurant or otherwise, that I have eaten.  The only change that I made to this recipe is that I did not have fresh basil, so I used dried.  When my husband saw me making it, he turned up his nose because he does not like tomatos and even he licked his plate clean!  Will add this to our "fav" collection.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe ! I've made it about 10 times now, but I sub in chopped broccoli for the corn, and toss it in about two minutes before adding the tomato. I also cut the onion back to 1/2 cup. I use 1/2 tbsp dried basil if I don't have fresh, and after grating fresh Parmesan cheese for this recipe, I'll never go back to the packaged grated stuff !

This is a great recipe!  I really enjoyed the flavors and it felt like summertime in the middle of winter!  I used what I had, 1 can diced tomatoes, frozen corn and used chicken broth in place of water.  It turned out very well for us!  I had crumbled bacon on hand and threw them in, too, it was nice.  I could see this being a sturdy side or a light main course...  I would increase the herbs and add the garlic towards the end for a deeper flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night to pair with sundried tomato feta and spinach stuffed chicken breasts.  I used 3 chicken boullion cubes with the water but other than that made the recipe as written.  This was a lovely recipe and I received rave reviews from our dinner guests.

Much easier than I thought but I definitely recommend prepping EVERYTHING ahead of time.  The risotto requires so much attention while absorbing the liquid that you can't multitask.  We liked it better with less corn, more rice (and therefore more liquids), and chicken.  I used chicken broth instead of water and no milk.  All of the reviews were helpful except the ones that said it wasn't good.  I'm an ameteur cook and mine came out amazing (so says my picky husband).  Now that I've learned the basics i'm going to make this with sausage, basil and onions.

This risotto was incredible!  The taste even tops the risotto I always order at a great Italian restaurant close to home.  The only downside is it makes my husband and I fight over who gets to take the left overs to work the next day.  I definitely recommend trying this recipe!

I don't like cheese much, so I just put a sprinkle of Parmesan in mine.  Very yummy.  Loved the sweet bite that the corn brought.

Absolutely incredible - I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so used organic canned diced tomatoes and since I didn't have fresh basil I used italian seasoning. I have also made a number of modified risotto dishes, using this technique as a base and it has always been a hit

Jessica, I can't thank you enough for providing this wonderful recipe!

I had never had risotto before and so many recipes call for broth which I cannot have right now (MSG, among others).

It definitely is a labor of love.  I added some shrimp like others suggested and had to use frozen corn niblets, but it was fabulous!  The husband loved it too!

This recipe has quickly become a family favorite. We use vegetable broth for the liquid and use lots of garlic.

Excellent!  I changed this a bit and made mine in a more traditional way-I substituted vegetable broth for the milk (wasn't wild about the milk idea for some reason).  I did everything else almost as indicated-didn't peel the tomato (too much work and not necessary!), added extra parmesan, and stirred in a pat of butter before serving.  Topped with basil and more parmesan and it was great!!  Very fresh tasting risotto because of the corn and basil-every last grain of rice was gone!  Thanks!!
