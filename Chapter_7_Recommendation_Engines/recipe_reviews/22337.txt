Maybe it's just me, but I didn't really like the taste of this dessert.  It was pretty enough and not as difficult as I thought it would be.

I really liked this recipe and so did my whole family.  We like a sweeter custard so I added a little more sugar and it was great.  There was too much meringue though--one egg white would have been sufficient and that is all I will use in the future.

this happens to be the recipe that my husbands grandmother used when he was growing up in france.  some recipes call for raw egg.....use this recipe instead.....poached is the way to go.  we drizzle with caramel.

Flavour was a little weak, but wasn't too bad. If you have a problem with lumps in the custard, make sure that your not over cooking it....you don't want scrambled eggs, and strain it right away when you take it off the stove. That cools it down enough to stops lumps from forming.

This recipe is fairly easy, though 
I had a hard time with lumps.  Maybe I over cooked it? I like it enough that I have tried twice now to get it right and am getting closer. I added half of a vanilla bean to the batch and really like the flavor.  This is breakfast food right?

When I baby-sitted my nephew, Randall, I made this! First he looked at me and asked my what it was, i told him. He ate it and all he could say was: "Auntie Jennette do you have anymore!"

It came out really good. I cooked it very slow on a very low fire and it did not lump up for me. I added some cardamom into the egg whites (the floating islands things). That came out pretty good, though next time I think I'll add nutmeg into the custard base instead.

Yes, you found the right recipe.  Some recipes call for raw eggs.  Definatley you need to poach the whites as stated.  Traditionally, drizzled with caramel.

I made this to take to a 1950's theme party.  The only change I made was tripling the amount.   It is time consuming and you need to watch every step carefully ... BUT... definitely worth it.  
Unlike when I made  "Floating Islands" in school cooking class,  these Islands floated.  Give it a try.
