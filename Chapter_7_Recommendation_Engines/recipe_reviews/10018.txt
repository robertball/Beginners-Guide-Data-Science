This was a huge hit with my family!! I found the filling to be too thin for my liking, so I added more powdered sugar than called for. My son was passing them out to the neighbors telling eveyone to "taste these!!"

Easy to make...tastes terriffic...they were a big hit!  I dropped the dough by tablespoons, not teaspoons and the recipe made 20 servings, not 12.

I've been searching for a good Whoopie Pie recipe that had marshmallow in the filling so I tried this one. The cookies came out great after baking them for 8 minutes. The filling was okay...it isn't that typical sugary sweet filling that I am used to but nonetheless, very good. I will continue to search for the perfect filling but in the meantime will continue to use this recipe!

We really liked these, though the filling was different than any I've had.  Very light. The only thing I'd do different is make more of the filling.  There wasn't really enough.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were really good! The cake part is great. The filling I ended up adding the whole 7 oz of marshmallow creme and probably and extra 3/4 cup (or so) of powdered sugar. This helped bulk it up so I had just enough to fill all of them.

I found the filling to be very bland.  I used 1 tsp ov vanilla instead of only 1/4 tsp.  It gave the filling more flavor.  A great recipe, my grandchildren always asks for them.  I always have them in the freezer.

I used just the cake portion of this recipe, and used the frosting from the "Whoopie Pies VII" recipe. I followed the recipe for the cake exactly and the cookies came out very well - good amount of moisture and an adequate chocolate flavor, although not super strong.

This was a good recipe. Made it to go with the children's book, Jimmy Zangwow's Out of this World Moon Pie Adventure, by Tony diTerlizzi. My first graders loved them...I did find that they tasted better the next day, after the filling flavors had a chance to meld together. I also added more vanilla to the filling. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the slight crispness of the chocolate cookies, but the flavor was somehow lacking.  Not sure why.  The filling was pretty good, but again, not terribly flavorful and not that light, creamy filling I was hoping for.  Regardless, they were easy to make and had great presentation.  I put each one in a baggie and brought to a potluck and all the kids snatched them up immediately.

They were simple to make and I had exactly enough filling for my 14 cookies. They didn't take that long to make and everyone loved them. I'll definitely make them again. Great recipe.

The cookie had an excellent moist texture but the flavor was lacking. It just doesn't have that rich chocolatey flavor of traditional whoopie pies. I didn't care much for the frosting but that may just be me. I am not a fan of so much shortening in my frostings. I will probably alter the cookie part of the recipe to add more flavor but I am still on the hunt for the perfect filling.

Like others I added a TB of vanilla to the filling. I also used a full cup of sugar. My husband likes peanut butter, so I added a 1/2 cup of PB to half the frosting, and it came out delicious. To add more of a chocolate taste to the cakes I added an extra 2 TB of cocoa. Yummy!

This seems to be a fool proof recipe.  Loved it.  For me, the convection oven worked better than traditional.  And, using parchment paper worked MUCH better than directly on the pan which is stone.  Even the first cookies that didn't come out looking all that good still tasted fabulous.  Hard to screw this up.

These Whoopie Pies were very good! This was my first time making them. Very simple recipe. I did make a few adjustments to the frosting..I used 1 C of Marshmellow Fluff, 1/2 C of butter, 1 C confectioners sugar, 1 Tbsp milk, and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. It was the perfect accent to the chocolate cakes!

Fantastic cookie. Still looking for the perfect filling.Even though I used butter and extra sugar and vanilla it's still missing that PA magic. The very best Whoopie pie I ever had was from Ashcomb's in Mechanicsberg,PA.

I only made the cookie portion of this recipe. They were pretty good, although they didn't puff up very much and were a little crumbly (not dry, just fell apart easily). I discovered that they need to be baked on a greased cookie sheet too. All that considered, I thought they were good and would make them again.

The cake was very good but the filling was very heavy on butter and didn't make enough for all the pies. I needed to add more than double the marshmallow and confectioners sugar.

The frosting in these is heavenly.  However, the cookies seem a bit dry & small to me.  I have a recipe from my mom & the cookie part is more cake-like, similar to Suzy-Q's.  We call them gobs.  I'll have her send it to me & post it.

The cake part is OK, but the filling just doesn't taste right. None of it is bad, but this recipe did not match my memories of "authentic" whoopie pies.

Everyone loves it when I make these! The only differences is that I only use .5 tsp of baking soda in the dough and I add 2/3 of a package of cream cheese.

I used heart-shaped cupcake pan to make these for Valentine's Day. They were yummy and adorable. My son is allergic to eggs so I used Ener-G egg replacer for the cake and instead of marshmallow cream(which has egg in it)I melted small marshmallows in the microwave and voila marshmallow cream. Yummy and so cute
