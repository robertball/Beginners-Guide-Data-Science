I made this for supper last night for the hubbs and I. Neither of us liked it. It was unappetizing to look at and the amount of chili powder called for made it bitter. It's not unusual for me to cook 1x and eat 2x, which it will be leftovers for supper.
I will add a can of tomatoes and maybe  a pinch of garlic and hopefully we'll finish the dish up so it won't be wasted.
