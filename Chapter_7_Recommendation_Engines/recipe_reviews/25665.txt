AWESOME! I served this for Bunko and the ladies all loved it and asked for the recipe! The first batch I made I followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group, and made some changes for the 2nd batch which made it even better (I think!). I reduced the milk to 3 cups whole, 2 cups 1% (cuz that's what we have on hand), and 1 cup chicken broth. (Because the soup is so darned thick and extremely rich!) I also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two, then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender, then put in a minced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute. Pureed the entire thing in my Cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese, et al. Gave it even MORE flavor--totally over the top! I then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot! I put chopped green onion, bacon, cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wanted. Yum!

Excellent soup.  I used non-fat milk, lower fat cheese and light sour cream.  And I kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking (definitely no need for whole milk.)  I added more black pepper, no salt (didn't need it) and used real bacon pieces.  I also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest I chopped more finely.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  It's a keeper.

This was excellent, everyone loved it.  I only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and I slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled.  Then once I had the soup base thickened, I threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked.

Wonderful recipe for people new to making soup. It's also an easy recipe to accomodate to your tastes. I'm a vegetarian, so I took out the bacon. I also substituted vidalia onions for green onions and replaced the whole milk with skim. You can try soy bacon bits, but I find they become soggy. Also try adding chopped potato skins (it has all the nutrients) to the soup to make it chunkier, or add milk continuously to thin it out. Even though I now need a full membership to the local gym due to this soup, it's worth it. Thanks!

Thanks for posting such an easy recipe. I have made this twice, and I've made the following changes.....I added a can of golden mushroom soup (plus a can of water) I substitued chives for green onions, and I doubled the bacon. Delicioso!


++++++++++++++

p.s. I have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of Butter and Olive Oil for the butter, 1% milk for the whole milk, and substituting canadian bacon for bacon. I also used 8 oz. fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese (3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor) for the shredded cheddar......just as good, and maybe better!!

This soup is wonderful.  I have tried many recipes, but this one is JUST right.  I reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream, using skim milk rather than whole milk, reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces, and only used 1/2 cup flour.  It tasted just like restaurant potato soup.

This recipe was super easy and tasted great!  I modified it a little by using skim milk and fat free sour cream, but it still tasted rich and creamy.

This recipe turned out way too thick. I added extra milk but think that if I make this one again I will try chicken broth. The extra milk made it to rich.

Excellent soup!  Although to make it even yummier, I used real bacon and tripled the bacon, green onion and cheese.  Also- I baked the potatoes in the oven.   Additionally, I did not add any salt to the soup as the bacon provided the sodium.

I have made this recipe 10 plus times.  People go crazy over this because it is both a gourmet and comfort food.  I always double the recipe and freeze 1/2 in a zip lock. The most important key in this recipe as another reviewer mentioned is to sub out 1 or 2 of the six cups of milk with a cup(s) of chicken broth.  It sets this soup over the top.  Otherwise it is just too rich.   I add garlic and chopped carrots to this recipe which add color and flavor. Also, the other trick is to pour in the milk/broth slowly to give it time to thicken.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I had a a little more than half of a bag of organic red potatoes I needed to use or lose. Perfect time to make potato soup. Because I'm watching my weight/carb count, I used mostly organic chicken broth in place of the milk (1/4 cup of fat free half-n-half was plenty and I used a one-32 ounce carton of broth), turkey bacon in place of the real bacon and I cut the cheese and sour cream by at least half. I added chives, garlic and onion to my potato soup, too, for more flavor. That's not reflective of the recipe, it's just something to lighten it up for me and make the recipe more personal. If you are short on time, the potatoes and broth can go into your crockpot and cook away on high for a couple hours until the potatoes are fork tender. Then, you either mash it with a potato masher (for a chunkier soup) or puree it with a immersion blender (for a thinner soup) and add all your bacon bits, onions, cheese and sour cream before serving. The great thing about potato soup is it's super bendable to whatever your dietary/budget needs or time restraints are.

This is just the best soup.  I've been making it for years and just now got around to reviewing and taking a photo of it.  I usually use 2% milk instead of whole milk and I think I've even made it with skim, but we like the 2% version.  It's still rich and thick, but with less fat than whole milk.  Otherwise, this soup is perfect as is!  Serve this with a salad for a satisfying meal.

Loved it!!! I made this for my fiance and my two kids and they ate every bit! I of course did things a little different because I am the type that doesnt EVER follow directions - I tend to make recipes my own and more simple. I cut a good amount of the sour cream, a few table spoons was enough. I cut out ALOT of the flour and made a roux when I cooked the bacon and onion together while boiling the potatos in chicken broth. I also used alot of bacon because my kids love it! Sprinkled some cheese on top instead of adding into it! WE LOVED IT! Will make again and again and again!

Loved this soup!  Potato soup is a favorite and this recipe made it just the way I like it.  It was actually my first foray into making a homemade soup and it turned out wonderfully...the husband gave it a hearty thumbs up!  Will definitely be adding it permanently to the recipe box at my house.

Love, Love, Love potato soup!  Espescially with all of these added goodies.  However, I have always used a chicken stock and fat free half-n-half mixture.  It cuts fat, but I still use a butter/EVOO mixture w/ flour to thicken and I promise you cannot tell a difference.  Also, another trick I use (which some of you may cringe about) are using frozen cubed potatoes instead of prepping the taters myself.  Again, I promise no one will be able to tell the difference.  I just thaw them (or even microwave them for a few minutes) and then saute' them for just a bit w/ some garlic and onions.  Then sprinkle flour and add liquids.  It helps in the thickening process!  A great bowl of comfort!!!

i first cooked this soup for a group of friends, not quite sure if it would go over well.  It turned out to be a GREAT success, and there were no leftovers to be had (which caused much complaining among those who were too polite to rush the pot for seconds).  Thanks!

I absolutely LOVE IT!  I ended up putting aside 3 of the potatoes, cubed and cooked them so I would have some chunks of potato in the soup, it also helped to thin the soup a bit, as it is very thick.  The best tasting soup EVER!  Don't forget to garnish with some leftover green onion, cheese, bacon bits and a dab of sour cream in the middle, YUMMY and looks beautiful.  My kids loved it as well.

Yummy absolute delicious! I halved the recipe and left out the bacon since I didn't have any. Used lite sour cream and 2% milk. Added a little extra on the green onions because I like them! Was very thick but I liked that!

I made adjustments to the original recipe, or I would have probably given this the full five stars.  Making a half batch, I used 1 1/2 c skim milk and originally 2 c vegetable broth. Having put in everything but the sour cream and cheese, I then put this in the crock pot on low for about 4 hours, then added the cheese - and this could still use another c vegetable broth or milk to thin it out. I'm sure that with the original recipe, the rich thickness of the soup is part of its tremendous appeal... it's just a bit too much for me.  Otherwise, thanks much for an awesome starter - this will definitely be kept around for future use!

Boiled the potato and cut into chunks. Used 2% milk and real bacon. Added more pepper. Next time, I'm thinking of adding some rosemary, thyme, or sage to the mix.

I took the other reviews into consideration before making this recipe, and I'm glad I did. I used real bacon, low fat sour cream, 5 cups of fat free milk and 1 cup chicken broth, and did not add any salt. I also baked the potatoes in the oven after lightly coating them with olive oil and a little salt. It retains the nutrients better, and after scooping out the potato out of them, I cut up about half of the skins and added them to the mixture. Hence..with the bacon and skins, no salt necessary. It will be sure to be a huge hit at the superbowl party today! Thank you!

Wonderful recipe. I placed the potatoes in the oven for 40 min instead of the micro. And added more green onions.

This was very good.  Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was too thick--even though I added extra milk at the end.  Also,  I cut the recipe down to 4 servings instead of 12.  I see other reviewers added chicken broth instead of milk.  Another alternative maybe would be to cut the thickening agent in half.

Super creamy and good! I halved the recipe, used 2 cups 2% milk and 1 cup fat-free half and half and it was thick, rich and delicious. Even my husband who adores this soup in restaurants loved this version.

All 4 family members loved the recipe.  I used low fat cheese, skim milk and substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream.  It was quite rich and yummy with all of these substitutions.  I did thin it with some chicken broth reconstituted from a powder.  It worked well.

Very tasty, thick soup.  Very filling!  Will definitely make again.

Used fresh cooked crumbled bacon in place of bacon bits.

This is a time consuming recipie and also makes a mess of the kitchen.   The overall soup is tasty- however, it seems like it is missing something.  This is a recipie that makes ALOT of soup.  You will have lots of leftovers.  The soup is also EXTREMELY thick!  I recommend serving this in a bread bowl on a snowy day.

This is an absolutely FANTASTIC recipe!  It's easy to make and really delicious just the way it is.  The possible additions are as numerous as your taste buds:  steamed broccoli, sauteed mushrooms, pretty much anything you would put on a baked potato.  Yum!!

Its a good base, wish I would've read the reviews sooner. Although I halved the recipe I still ended up using a whole quart of milk and still needed chicken stock. Made better Mashed Potatoes than soup. Rather tasteless too. I won't be using this recipe again.

I love this soup! I've made it with low-fat yogurt in place of the sour cream to cut calories, and I don't bother with whole milk. I also am way too lazy to scoop the insides of the potatoes out, so I just chop them bite-sized with the skins on and dump in - it's delicious!

I wanted to LOVE this, but it was just ok for us.  I followed the recipe, though I did use 1% milk in place of whole.  It was VERY gluey (I'm guessing due to variances in potato size?).  I ended up adding quite a bit of chicken broth to even out the consistency.  Mr. LTH enjoyed it and deemed it *substantial* enough for him to count as a meal (w/home made bread), though we never ended up eating the leftovers, so that kind of speaks for itself.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is declicious and easy.  I made some alterations from other viewers.  I only used 5 Cups of milk and added 1 Cup of chicken broth.  It still came out a little too thick.  I think I will try to use 1% milk next time to reduce the fat content.

This was excellent.  I made it as stated except used about 1/4 tsp onion powder rather than the green onions and double the pepper because I like my potato soup with a nice peppery flavor.  Only reason I didn't give it 5* was because it turned out a bit too thick.  Next time I will reduce the flour a little bit.

Fantastic soup.  Had last minute company coming for dinner with no time to shop so needed to make something with what I had on hand.  Followed ideas and used half milk/half vegi broth.  Also used my summer time trick.  Baked the potatoes in the oven.  Cut each in half and inserted a couple of garlic cloves. Wrapped in foil and baked.   (Who said garlic mashhed were the only way to go) Great flavor. Thanks TLNATION for this great recipe.

More like 4.5 stars, Very rich soup. I made a few modifications; used only 1/2 the amount of potatoes mine were very big, used about 4 cups milk and 2 cups chicken broth, used real bacon and cooked some onion and garlic with the butter. Overall very good, rich and filling so serve with a nice green salad so you don't feel so guilty about eating it  :)

Wonderfully delicious! I did saute some celery, onion and garlic in some butter before I made the roux. Other than that followed the recipe. It was simple and pretty quick to prepare. I know I'll be making this alot through the cold winter months. Thanks for sharing.

Yummm! Changes I made: Bolied potatoes, smashed half, left the other half cubed, much faster and easier. Added more S&P, garlic powder, and onion powder with butter and flour. Turned out perfect...not too thick. Will make again and again.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I made some changes after reading other reviews.  I baked 8 potatoes in the oven the day prior to making the soup.  I scooped the potatoes out and left 4 shells-I figured I could make twice-baked potatoes with any extra potatoes.  I didn't peel them.  I made the soup with 1/2c butter, 1/2 cup flour, 2 c chicken broth, 4 cups 2% milk.  I made the soup portion and threw in some garlic salt and dried diced onion.  The potatoes I just threw in until it was the thickness my husband and I like.  I added a large spoonful of sour cream at the end.  This was really good.  The husband had the soup with just crackers, I had it with crumbled bacon and cheese.  This could easily be adapted to make chicken corn chowder and things like that.  Thanks!

I made so many changes to this recipe, that it's hard for me to rate the original one.  I thought the original recipe would lack in flavor and there were too many potatos.  Here is what I did. 

I used 3 large potatoes, I blanched them until they were half cooked, then cubed them.. so they would cook the rest of the way in the liquid. 
I used 3 cups of milk, and between 1-2 cups chicken broth.  Milk alone would be too bland. 
I cooked one small yellow onion in the butter before adding liquids.  I only used a few tbsps of butter.
I used at least 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, I kept tasting it and adding more. 
I stirred a few tbsps only of sour cream in at the end, and I think the bacon gives great flavor.   My batch made enough for 4-6 dinner sized servings.  This recipe has potential, but I did a lot of tweaking.

I made this recipe for a family contest for the best comfort food.  This recipe won in a land slid.  We made the recipe as is but then put toppings on the side for each person to top as they saw fit.  Along with the cheese and bacon we also used salsa, sour cream, and jalapanoes.  We made the recipe in advance and then froze a container of it.  It was just as good defrosted.  We plan to make the recipe again.

This was a delicious soup - loved by the whole family! I used a package of pre-cooked Hormel bacon, threw in all of the cheese & most of the onions, and used 1% milk. It made a huge amount for our family of 5 - I will make it again soon!

This recipe was good, and my husband especially loved it, but it was just okay for me.  I baked the nine potatoes that the recipe called for and then just stopped adding them when I reached the consistency I was looking for.  The first time I made it I used nine potatoes, the second time I only used six and a half.

This is a very rich filling soup with good flavor. I suggest having something lite to eat on the side and iced tea. It does taste like a decked out baked potato. Thankyou for the recipe :)

Totally delicious!  I put in extra bacon and cooked the green onions a little before adding the milk.  Also I gradually added an entire can of chicken broth to thin it out (I needed to add even more when I reheated it).  Thanks for the recipe!

This should be re-named HEAVENLY POTATO SOUP!
It is the closest thing to Houlihan's I've found, which is my all time favorite! I used skim milk & cut back on the roux part of the recipe too so that it wouldn't be too too thick. It turned out
GR8! Try it~ you're gonna like it if you like chunky potato soup....

Baked potato soup has always been my favorite.  Waiting for my local TGIFridays to have it is not how I like to spend my time, I'd rather spend it making this soup.  Yes it is a little thick, I cut back the flour and add a little bit of milk when I reheat it on the stove.

This soup was easy to make & came out great!  I followed the advice of others & used 1/2 cup butter, a little over 1/2 cup flour, skim milk, & reduced fat cheddar cheese & it was still really great.  I also added red pepper & made the sour cream optional.  It was even better the 2nd day.  I will make this again!

This is the best potato soup I've ever had. After making this, I swore off every other potato soup recipe I have.  This is fabulous and it's so easy to make!  I made a double batch so we could re-heat it and have it several times during the week.

I don't understand how these potato soup recipes got so many 5 stars.  I was unsure of making a soup with 2/3 cup of four, but the top three recipes all had the same amount of flour.  The outcome was a pasty flour taste.  The lack of spices also make this rather bland.  I will have to locate another recipe I used to use that was similar to this, but with the roux being made with 2 TBLS of flour.  It also had chicken broth, hot sauce, and basil.

Excellent Recipe! I did not use microwave for potatoes as I think baked potatoes should be baked! =) Don't be afraid to double the bacon( use real bacon) and definitely triple the scallions. I also used extra sharp cheddar cheese and an extra potato or two. Outstanding soup. Make a double batch!! Reheats beautifully. Thank you TLNATION!

Baked potato soup was absolutely delicious! I made a few minor changes... instead of cooking the potatoes in the microwave I peeled and quartered them, then boiled them for 10min on the stove (Cooking them in the microwave THEN scooping out the flesh seemed too time-consuming). Then I mashed them leaving them a little lumpy. Also, instead of using bacon bits I cut strips of uncooked bacon into small sections then fried them on the stove. *When reheating leftover soup ---> Adding a dash of half & half or milk before microwaving or reheating on a stovetop gives it a more soup-like consistency because after being refrigerated it thickens up* I personally think it tasted better the second day :-*

Thanks for the recipe.  It is delicious.  It was a little thick for my taste.  Next time I make it I will make the roux to milk ratio more like a white sauce (one tablespoon butter, one tablespoon flour for each one cup of milk).  I have saved this recipe and look forward to making it again very soon!

i make this all the time with no changes. my family ABSOLUTELY LOVES this stuff. when i have guests over, i make it for 18 servings, which usually comes out really thick, and then i just add hot chicken broth after the soup is finished cooking to warm the soup back up for everyone and to thin it.

This really is a fantastic potato soup. I didn't follow it exactly but that's what's so great about it--it's very versatile. For example, I sauteed a diced small white onion in the butter for about 10 minutes on medium and then added 3 minced garlic cloves for 1 minute before I added the flour. I used 1% milk and still had to add a lot more skim milk later on to thin it out because this is a really thick base. I also used real bacon and probably added way more than the recipe called for, as well as more green onions. I will say that the sour cream at the end really added that extra something it needed. This soup is easy to make in a lower fat version and when I'm just cooking for our family that's how I'll make it but I never cook low fat for guests (it's just bad form) and this recipe really is better when you go all out so if you have the chance and aren't afraid to splurge on calories just once in a while, I recommend using the whole milk, real bacon and regular sour cream. You won't be disappointed!

This was too thick. Taste is good and its a straight forward recipe. Skipped the sour cream (not a fan) and added half 2% milk and half chicken broth. It still needs extra liquid when reheating or it becomes mashed potatoes.

Good recipe - I let the baked potatoes cool and then cut them into chunks with the skins on which adds color and nutrition.  I add more milk and use real bacon. 

I also double the potatoes, bacon, onions and cheese and then separate half and food saver it and put it in the freezer so the next batch goes even faster!

I pretty much follow the recipe i add a little more bacon and cheese into my soup.  Also! I split the milk quantity in half...i use 3 cups of milk and 3 cups of chicken broth.  It gives it a little more flavour! This is the best baked potato soup I have ever had! My whole family loves it!!!

I gave this recipe a 5 star rating because its a great starter recipe.  Taking the advice of other users I fried bacon to start, then used the bacon grease to sautee carrot, celery, onions and garlic. I also used a french onion sour cream and added that to the soup once the recipe calls for it.  All in all this came out AMAZING!!!

This soup was very easy to make. I am glad I read some of the previous posters comments. The soup is VERY thick and I ended up using chicken broth to help thin it out a bit. I didn't use whole milk, since we drink 2% that's what I used. I also used light sour cream but stuck with the regular cheddar cheese. I also back the salt down to 1 1/2 teaspoons since the bacon has enough salt in it anyway. I used my dutch oven pot since I knew it wasn't all going to fit in my largest sauce pan. Big hit with the family. Will make this again!!

Yum!  I loved this soup.  I had to make some alterations based on available ingredients.  I omitted the green onions and used real bacon vs bacon bits.  I also used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  Over all, I liked it very much.  I only rated it with 4 stars rather than 5 because I am not a bacon bits fan.  Maybe that is personal preferance, but still real bacon would make this a much better recipe.

This recipe is very tasty! I made a couple changes ...I sauteed some finely chopped onion and garlic in the butter before I added the flour. I also did not add extra salt and I used red potatoes. That added some very nice flavor. I would just like to point out that I did not pay attention to the servings yield amount, because this makes a LOT of soup. Especially because it is so thick and so rich. I would recommend mixing in a little bit of chicken broth to thin it out a bit and it would also add some nice flavor. Overall very tasty but only small servings were needed because of its rich taste.

This was delish!! I thought it was much too thick at first, but it is easily thined out with extra milk. No need for whole milk, 2% works just fine! I added much more bacon and onion. Salt and pepper to taste! Saltines for dipping... A must!

This soup is AMAZING!  A couple of notes though....I used 2% milk as I never buy 'whole'.  Have only bought skim as far back as I can remember so 2% seemed indulgent enough.  In fact, this soup is so deliciously thick and wonderful, when I made the soup a second time the next day, skim worked perfectly - as thick and yummy as ever. My husband added clams and bay shrimp to his portion of the pot to make 'slumgullion'.  I can't wait to try this with half the amount of taters, then adding a bag of sweet corn and a can or two of green chilies - there are 1,0o0's of ways to change up this great soup...think ham, sausage, roasted garlic and peppers and onions!  SO many things to toss in!  PERFECT soup.

Wow!  What a delicious recipe.  I did use 1'/. Milk instead of whole and fat free sour cream, added extra pepper since we like zing, a little onion salt and parsley..perfect for our cold fall days in the great Northwest. This will definitely be a fall and winter staple in our home.

This soup may be heavy....and not so good for you....but it is SO worth every mouthful.  It tastes exactly like somebody liquified the best baked potato ever made.  You will never go back to any other potato soup recipe again.

Absolutely delicious.!!! I used 4 cups fat-free milk, and 2 cups chicken broth. No need for sour cream if trying to lower calories. Might try using evaporated fat-free milk with the broth next time and see how it turns out. Excellent soup.

Delicious! I peeled and cubed potatoes, cooked them in low salt chicken broth,drained and rough mashed instead of baking them. I pan fried diced bacon instead of Bacon Bits. Great soup. This recipe is a keeper.

I combined this recipe with another one on the site (the first Baked Potato Soup) which added real bacon, half-half, basil and hot sauce, and it was really quite yummy!  Creamy and warm - exactly what I was looking for on a January day.  I added smoked gouda because I had some leftover from another recipe and it added a really nice flavor.  I froze most of it and will be thawing it for lunches the rest of winter.

I followed the recipe exactly except I baked my potatoes in the oven because the texture is so much better than cooking in the microwave.  We thought this was quite bland and too thick.  I am going to try again using only 1/3 cup of butter and 1/3 cup of flour and leave out the sour cream reserving it as a topping.  I am thinking this will cut down on the extreme thickness, will also use garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I think the garlic will work wonders.

Made this last night. Downsized to 3 servings and followed the recipe exactly except baked the potatoes in the oven rather than the microwave. Also forgot to get Bacon bits at the store, so didnot add those. Came out extreemely thick so had to add additional milk. Wife said it was 'alright' but I did not like it at all. Will definitly not be makeing it again.

Very good! One of those soups that tastes like it took more time to cook than it actually did! It was so quick and easy. I did make a few adjustments, but mostly because I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand. I used red potatoes, quartered, and I left the skin on. I also used 1% milk. I opted to use a small Vidalia onion, sauteed, and added that to the soup mixture (instead of the green onions), and I used real bacon, cooked, and chopped into pieces. I dumped it all in to the crock pot, and let it sit. It was great! The only quantity adjustment I made was the salt. It wasn't nearly salty enough for my liking. Overall, a truly great, thick, hearty recipe.

Delicious! Made this for lunch for company today because of the picture on the main page. Was fast and easy to prepare and tastes fantastic! Our company even asked for the recipe. I made it with skim milk and low fat sour cream and it was still very thick and rich. I did substitute some broth for a bit of the milk like what was previously suggested. I may even add a little more milk to it to make it a little thinner. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

The flavor of this soup is excellent, however, a bit too thick for me and I only used 6 potatoes.  I can't imagine 9 and I even added some chicken broth cuz I could see it coming.  I did use reduced fat sour cream and milk.  Almost like eating mashed potatoes.  This is easily fixed so because of the flavor and ease of this recipe I would make it again and adjust some things to compensate for the thickness issue.

I will now stop searching for a perfect potato soup recipe. It's so good that I served the cheddar cheese on the SIDE--I didn't put ANY in the soup because it was good enough without it! The beginning step of making a roux is so, so, so, so, SOOOO much better than using instant mashed potatoes or cornstarch to thicken the soup that I have no words to express how much better this is. With that said, the only changes I made were to add extra green onion (I love them) and a little vegetable base from a jar (I love that too) and about 6 ice cubes of homemade basil chicken stock (because that would add more flavor than water and I needed to thin it out a bit at the end). Thank you SO much for submitting this excellent, fabulous recipe!

I think I used too much flour and not enough cheese.  My daughter liked it, she put more cheese in it.  I will try it again and see if it was just me that messed it up.  ( It probably is me)  Lol.

Love, love, love this recipe. It is a bit of work because of the constant whisking as you slowly add the milk (but it gives it the great thickness you want in baked potato soup).   Husband and I used 1% milk, low fat sour cream and it did not alter the taste at all.  We also didn't have bacon. Love it and will make over and over. Thanks for sharing!

My whole family loved this soup.  I gave it 4 stars only because I made some changes, 5 stars for taste...definitely a keeper!    I used 6 lg. potatoes (microwaved, cooled slightly and peeled.  Broke up with pastry blender.)  Melt 1/2 c. margarine & add 1/2 c. flour & 2 T. bacon drippings. Stir in 6 c. milk (2 c. at a time) until well blended.  Stir in potatoes, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 16 oz. pkg. of cooked and crumbled bacon, and 10 oz. shredded cheddar cheese; heat through.  Add 1 c. sour cream; heat through.  I topped bowls with the remaining 2 oz. of a 12 oz. bag of shredded cheese and chopped green onion.  Wonderful soup and it wasn't to thick.

Very good! I followed some other instructions.  I cut down on the roux to 1/2 cup each of butter and flour. I used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 milk, and added 1/2 tsp each of onion and garlic powder. I didn't have any already baked potatoes on hand so I diced raw potatoes and boiled them in the broth first. I might use less sour cream next time.  Overall great though! Very easy.

This is very good.  Potato soup is supposed to be thick, so I'm a bit confused on the comments left.  I did use real bacon, 2% milk and about 8 "fist" sized potatoes. I suggest cooling the potatoes down before scooping them out, burnt my fingers a few times.

The recipe "as is" would probably border 3/4 stars - but with alterations it would be worthy of a 5 star rating.  Recipe calls for TOO much of nearly everything...  I used 4 large baking potatoes - pierced them with a fork all over and baked in the oven (microwave may be quicker but I wanted the true baked potato flavor) - once cooked I peeled them and cut the potatoes in bite-sized cubes.  Cut both the flour and butter to 1/2 cup and made a roux (cook butter/flour over low heat for 5-7 minutes whisking constantly).  Since the roux (butter/flour) would be the thickening agent I used all 2% milk.  I also used a regular yellow onion instead of green onion (didn't have any green on hand) - sauteed in a little butter until tender.  Once the milk thickened I added the potatoes, onion, cheese and two heaping tablespoons of sour cream (salt/pepper to taste).  Reduced heat to low and heated through.  The soup definitely needed to be thinned - so I ended up adding 2 cups of chicken broth until the soup was just the right consistency.  Since I had quite a bit of potatoes - I blended/pureed a pitcher full of the soup and added it back to pot.  Topped individual servings with a little shredded cheese.  Despite all the extra work - it was definitely tasty!

My family really enjoyed this recipe!  My husband said it was the best he ever had!  I added a little onion and celery to the butter and some chicken broth to the milk mixture.  We also had some leftover ham from Easter dinner that I through in as well.  I will definitely make over and over!

This soup is TERRIFIC, with MINOR modifications to our taste.  I suggest you guys try this for variety.  Instead of Bacon(because we don't like it soggy once it sits), I used 16 oz package of Ekrich skinless smoked sausage.  I fried in a pan until golden brown and added at the very last minute of cooking right before serving, also the same time you add the sr cream.  I also substitute skim milk for whole milk.  PLUS I add one can of chicken broth.  Otherwise make as directed.  By using the skim milk it's not too thick and by adding one can of chicken broth it tastes great!  The smoked sausage is REALLY what makes this recipe AMAZING!  The flavor is incredible!

My family loved this soup!  I added a 14 oz can of chicken broth as reccommended by other reviews.  I also cut back on the flour and butter because 2/3 cup is more than is needed to thicken this soup.  Adding the sour cream at the end made the soup luscious and we all enjoyed it.

This soup was much too thick. I served it for lunch on Christmas day to 12 people (it does make a lot) but half didn't come close to finishing. It is missing something-maybe a can of chicken broth would add flavor; and I would definitely cut back on the amount of potatoes used. I have made Baked Potato Soup III from this site and it is better--should have stayed with that recipe.

This is incredibly rich and a filling meal by itself.  I used a mixture of Russets and Yukon Gold potatoes because I like the creaminess Yukons add to the soup.  I used 6 cups of 1% milk instead of whole to cut the fat and the Yukons replaced the creaminess the whole milk added.  Instead of mixing the green onions, chives, bacon and cheese into the soup, I served the toppings on the side and let everyone add as they want.  Other suggested toppings: blue cheese, chili, hot sauce, and sauted mushrooms.

This was a good soup and easy to make!  I cut the recipe in half, since I live alone, and always make meals ahead of time to eat during the week, so the leftovers will be welcome!  I made a few changes, namely to lower fat content. Since I used salted sweet cream butter, I omitted the salt and used fat free sour cream and 1% milk instead of whole milk.  I also used Butterball thin and crispy turkey bacon instead of actual bacon, and it doesn't taste like I messed anything up.  Also, I didn't have scallions, so I just diced up a handful of chives and threw them into the pot.  Tasted marvelous, if I do say so myself.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Awesome, filling soup! I've made it many times and practically know the recipe by heart. Sometimes I add chicken or carrots for a different taste. It's good with some cream cheese add for an even thicker taste.

I used about a dozen small red potatoes and halved the recipe. Also, I'm a bit of a calorie counter, so I used 2% milk, fat free sour cream and low fat cheese, and it was still excellent. I also used 6 slices of crumbled bacon instead of bacon bits. Wonderful on a cold winter night! I think next time I would experiment with broccoli!

I loved this Soup!  You need to be careful to keep the ingredients correct.  I think mine was a bit thick because I got generous with the amounts.  I needed to add some milk the second day because it was more like a good bowl of mashed pototoes otherwise.  Great comfort food!  Easy to make.

Very good!  I used 1% milk and omitted the sour cream as the soup is thick enough.  Also added about 1 extra cup of milk than required.  Served in bread bowls!

Excellent recipe!! In the course of a month I've made the soup 3 times and given the recipe to 4 people. The only thing I did differently was cook the green onions with the butter in the beginning (and then added the flour and continued on). Fabulous!! You'll get lots of compliments. I did!!

What a delish, thick & hearty soup! I've already made it twice this month - including for Xmas dinner. 

There's absolutely nothing "low fat" about this recipe - although you could sub skim milk, reduced fat cheese and sour cream to bring down the fat and calorie content. 

It's super thick! I added about half a can of vegetable stock to reduce the thickness a bit & I hit it with my stick blender to take out the potato lumps and make it creamy. 

This is now our family potato soup recipe!

This potato soup was the first and last recipe I have ever made.  I is so thick and creamy.  It doesn't seperate when refrigerated then reheated also.  I also like to throw in a little chicken broth for flavor and to thin this lucious soup down.  You will never eat that stuff out of a can once you see how easy and tasty this recipe is.

This is fantastic.  So easy and tastes just like soup at your favorite restaurant.  Many of the reviews say that the soup is too thick and they had to additional milk or broth, but I just used skim milk and fat free sour cream and it made it the perfect consistancy.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is the best potato soup recipe.  It's just like the soup they have at Houlihan's Restaurant.  I used half and half instead of milk to make it richer, though I probably wouldn't have had to.  Excellent Tammy!

Make sure when you scoop out the cooked potatoe, it is not in big chucks.  Chop it up a bit.  The flavor is fabulous though.

What a fantastic recipe!!  I have to admit that I changed a little as I went along. I used 1% milk instead of whole, to cut fat, and it was still fantastic!  I also used real bacon (prefer the flavor to bacon bits), and at the end, while tasting, I decided not to add any sour cream into the pot, but only to garnish/top my own portion!

If you like Stuart Anderson's Black Angus's Baked Potato Soup, you'll love this!!

I added about two cups of chicken broth at the end. (Also added chicken broth when reheating the next day).  Also added garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  It was awesome!  Guests raved that it was the best potato soup they ever had.  Entire family loved it!  Bake the potatoes in the oven.  It smells better.

This soup is wonderful!  I didn't have whole milk or green onions.  I used skim milk and half a cup of sweet yellow onion.  The soup was still very thick with the skim milk.

This is a great, easy recipe, and it tastes MUCH better than Campbells soups! It is very good for kids(I am only 13) and my brother (who is VERY picky) LOVED it!!!

Substituted red onions for green onions and used 1% milk. Added chicken broth to thin it out.  Used chopped potato skins (it has all the nutrients) to the soup to make it chunkier. Added tarragon and chopped cilantro too.

Delicious, but I’ll make a few adjustments next time. My potatoes weren’t soft enough so I’ll microwave them a little longer. I’ll also add more salt and pepper and 2 cups of chicken broth to make it more soupy.

My family LOVED it!!!!!! My son can be rather picky but he was full and satisfied with this thick and hearty soup!!! Probably won't be one of my fave recipes to make but for a non cooker, recipe follower like myself it was definitely do-able......just not a fan of scooping out potato flesh or the constant stirring!!! But def felt better knowing it would EVENTUALLY thickening, I did worry for a sec that I messed it up!!!! End result was amazing!!! Leftovers for days though lol!!!

I'm not a cook, but I made this awesome! Cooked potatoes in chicken broth, sauteed onions and 2 garlic cloves, then dumped them all in. My husband is so used to eating burnt/crappy food, he's about to have a heart attack at how good it is! thank you!

AMAZING!!!  I used 2 c. heavy cream, 3 c. 2% milk and 1 c. chicken broth; 9 potatoes peeled and chopped raw.  Added a bit more black pepper and the salt because I did not put the bacon in the soup.  2 handfuls shredded colby jack and 8 oz sour cream.  Brought to consistency on the stove with the potatoes al dente.  Then put in crock pot on low to finish cooking for 1 hour.  Then on keep warm for 2 1/2 hours until all were ready to eat.  FANTASTIC!!!  Absolutely wonderful soup!  Garnished with crisp bacon pieces, shredded colby jack and green onion.

Great recipe, turned out delicious!! It's very thick, so if you want some liquid, add more milk throughout process and blend well for a more soupy soup!

Since most of the Bennigan's in our area closed years ago, I have been trying for most of those years to duplicate their "Ultimate Baked Potato" soup.  Sadly, this was not it. I followed it to the letter, and it was bland, at best. It was way too thick, and the flavor just wasn't there.   I don't think I'd even try to "doctor it up."  I'll just keep my search for a Bennigan's clone going.  Sorry about the negative review.

Really good, but I changed it up a bit.  I didn't have 9 potatoes, so I used 5.  Used 6 cups of 1% milk instead of whole, and 2 cups of fat free half & half. Used 2% cheddar, and low fat sour cream.  Soup takes a long time to thicken, but after you add potatoes, you can mash a few to thicken, plus it will thicken overnight in fridge.  Best served with cheddar bay biscuits!

This was super yummy!  I made about 1/3 of the recipe to feed just my husband and I (with a few extra potatoes - mine were on the small side).  I added some yellow onion when I added the milk (used 1%) which I think was a huge boost in taste.  And I didn't have any bacon so I microwaved some peperoni to make it crispy and used it instead.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very delicous, i think tho it might have been easier to just peel, cut up and boil potatoes, and then mix up a bit instead of baking in microwave and trying to hold the hot potato to scoop out the insides! Definately a recipe im going to use again tho

In terms of flavor, this soup is AMAZING. It is so comforting and creamy; a fantastic comfort food. The great thing (for me) was that I could use light sour cream, 2%milk, and cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and still have great results. I didn't add bacon (I'm a vegetarian). My only problem is with the amount of liquid. It simply didn't call for enough liquid; as written the recipe is so thick its hard to stir and definitely not "soup." I just added some veggie broth and *ta da*! perfect :) That's not a big problem in my book but it is something I hope others look out for. Regardless, this is a soup I will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice and both times it was just ok. My kids love it but it's a bit bland for my taste. Yes it is thick....the person who posted even says it's thick in her description. I used skim milk since that's what my family drinks. I think whole would have made it too heavy (well, heavier than it is already) The prep is longer than 15 min. I used 5 very large potatos which equaled about 9 regular and it took 40 minutes for them to cook in the microwave. I cooked 3 for 2o and then 2 for 20. While those cooked I made the bacon, diced green onion and shredded the cheese. From start to finish it took me about and hour and a half. If you can cook your potatos ahead of time, the prep will be much faster. Great for the kids since a lot of kids don't like a ton of spices.

I have made a recipe like this for many years.  I dont use as many potatoes, maybe about 5 med ones, i do prefer the Yukon gold. Also, i use at least 7 cups of milk so as not too thick. You can also use light sour cream to help with calories, i have not tried fat free yet. I am not sure how skim milk would be, i am afraid it would make it too thin, so i do use 2 percent. And lastly, i do use about a pound of bacon crumbled.  It is an absolutly delicious soup, esp on a cold night !!!

This recipe turned out fabulous, with some tweeks!  I baked the potatos the day before and I used 6 large potatos.  I then sauteed half an onion, some baby carrots and a clove of garlic in butter; they were all diced. Puree those once you are finished.  I then followed the recipe for the butter, flour, adding the 6 cups milk and whisking until thick.  I then added my potatos, which I chopped, so the soup was chunky- but small chunks and the cheese etc. also then add the onion, carrot mix at this point.  Let the soup get mixed and warm-then pop it in the fridge until ready to serve.  When ready to serve heat up the pot on the stove (soup will be thick)  add 2 cups of chicken broth and the sour cream (I used a little less than the 8 ounces). It will be amazing!!

Great soup!  My husband has me making this almost weekly!  Only adjustment I made was to cook bacon and then add part of the grease in place of the butter.  I have also used 2% milk, low fat sour cream and 2% cheese....still tastes awesome!

Thick, hearty and amazing.  I did make a few changes, mostly for flavor.  I used 4.5 lbs red potatoes since that is what I had in my garden.  Used an extra cup of milk, only 8 oz of cheese, a whole pound of bacon and added a tablespoon of dried mince onion and a tablespoon of garlic salt.  It was thick, reach and creamy and amazing.  I thought about making it lower in fat and calories but decided that goes against all rules when it comes to potato soup.  Great recipe, thank you!

Fairly bland and thick.  The first time I made it, I added extra cheese, bacon, and green onions, and it was still bland.  The second time I made it, I used half the flour  to try and thin it a bit (still was super thick) and then to make it more flavorful, I substituted bacon grease for part of the butter and tripled the bacon, salt, pepper, cheese, and green onions.  It was still very bland, so I added an entire packet of onion soup mix.  That made it pretty good.

Great Recipe.  I made a couple of alterations.  I added an additional cup of milk to thin it out a little bit.  I also doubled the bacon and used half of it in the soup for a little bit more flavor.  Prep before you begin and always use oven baked potatoes this soup comes together quickly.

This soup is AMAZING! Taste just like soup from a resturant.  I did make a few changes based off of other reviews.  I added one cup of chicken stock in place of one cup of milk, used microwavable bacon, added salt to taste and did not add sour cream to soup but instead served it on top.  This is a must try!!

I made this recipe without changing any of the ingredients, the only thing I did different was cubing the potatoes after I baked (microwaved) them.  It came out awesome, and makes a wonderful meal in and of itself - as it's very filling!  It's not for anyone who wants a low fat/low cal soup, but it is for everyone else.

This was a good Soup recipe, instead of throwing the potatoes in the microwave, I chopped and boiled the potatoes. The soup recipe seemed a little bland So I also added 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder, 1/2 tsp Onion powder 2 minced cloves of Garlic & One Medium White onioin. everything turned out perfectly.

My family LOVES this soup.  I make it several times during the fall/winter.  I just made a batch for the teachers at my daughter's school.  I usually bake the potatoes the night before or earlier in the day and then after they cool off, I peel & cube.  I think it keeps the soup from getting gummy as some reviewers mentioned.  Will try 2% milk next time per other reviewers suggestions as that is normally what I have in my fridge.  Love this thick soup!!!

I tripled this soup for a luncheon and it went like wildfire!  My family loves this soup, thank you so much for the recipe.  I didn't add any green onions or bacon to the soup, just left them as toppers.

For 2/3 of the milk, I used skim, and for the remaining 1/3, I used water (to make it less fatty). I think next time, I will do as other reviewers suggested and use chicken broth instead of the water. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee. Be careful to cook the potatoes enough, ours were a little bit harder than we would've liked. Overall, it was very good though.  Didn't make the best leftovers in my opinion...

I thought that it could use a little more salt and a lot more green onion and bacon as i am big on onion and my hubby is big on bacon, other than that, it was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe

Was VERY thick, even after I added about a cup of chicken stock to thin it out. Next day leftovers were like potato paste. I prefer my soup to be more soupy, and less like a stew, but my fiance loves it, the thicker the better. Had good flavor. I sautéed some white onion with some garlic and good that up with the pieces of bacon I cut up for bacon bits. Was very good.

This soup is amazingly delicious, and being a novice cook, I finally got it right after the sixth try.  Tries 1 thru 5 were still awesome, but the soup was more like sludge.  So for the beginner, these are the changes I made.    1.  I cooked the rue for atleast 6 minutes on LOW heat. 2.  After adding the milk and cooking on medium low heat for 10 minutes, I added the potatoes - most broke apart into small pieces after I nuked them and took the skins off.  I'm not a skin person. 3.  After 5 minutes, I added the scallions and continued cooking until the soup JUST STARTED to thicken. 4.  I added the bacon and let it cook another few minutes.  I used the already cooked bacon and just warmed it in the micro first for about 40 seconds.  I used the whole box of bacon. 5.  I added the cheese at the end once the soup was at the consistency I wanted.  I increased the cheese to 1 1/2 cups since we like cheese.  I never boiled the soup, it really only got to a simmer and it was the best!

I had leftover potatoes from Thanksgiving and used them to make this soup.  My only deviation was using real crumbled bacon.  I thought it was quite tasty and will defnitely make it again.

Excellent, Restaurant quality!  If you like it a little less thick, just stir in more milk before serving and heat through.  2% is just fine, and I see no need for the sour cream.  This is a keeper!!

Excellent flavors in this soup, but it is very thick and very fattening!

Although simple and quick, this soup is too thick and bland.  I have another recipe that I swear by, but it uses a lot of ingredients and takes a while to cook so I decided to try this alternative. I did not use the bacon and I adjusted the recipe to yield just 1 quart.  To me, it tasted like plain mashed potatoes (it had the consistency of it too!)

YUM YUM!  This was so delicious that there was not one leftover to be had!! I used skim milk and took others advice and replaced some of the milk with chicken broth which still resulted in a thick and creamy soup! I also added a bit of liquid smoke and come cayenne for a bit of kick. Absolutely wonderful and thank you!!

This was WONDERFUL.  I made it for company and was upset when there were very little leftovers for the next day.  I plan on making this again SOON!

This soup was amazing!  The only modifications I made were to use one 16 oz can of chicken broth in place of two cups of milk, and I also sauteed (in butter) some minced baby carrots with some garlic and then pureed it before adding to the soup.

Came out great. I heard it was gonna be thick but I was still surprised. I used nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream. I'll definiately make it again.

I thought this was pretty good, although I also altered it like many. I know it's called Baked Potato, but I boiled the potatoes, skin on. Then whipped them with the sour cream (fat free). Instead of whole milk, I used 2 cups half & half and 4 cups non fat (that's what I had on hand). Next time, I'm going to use 6 cups of non fat milk instead. I also did not add bacon and used colby cheese instead of the cheddar and used about twice as many scallions and added parsley. Very yummy!  I also used quite a bit more pepper - freshly ground. This was an incredibly easy recipe.

great soup base! Have made this as directed and it was good. Second time I did my own thing. For us there wasn't really enough for how many we had to feed so I used 7 cups of milk and another 4 cups of chicken broth! I also added some cooked ham & my signature Filet Mignon broiled & cut into pieces into the soup :) Celery or corn would also go great in this! I loved that it was pretty basic so I could add my own seasoning preferences! (we love garlic and really herby things so I went all out) And for future reference, green onions are chives in most countries :D And they were tasty!

Quite good.  Mine was a bit thick, but that was prob due to reading the directions wrong and adding too much flour.  I used 3 cups milk and 1 cup water (I had halved the recipe) to cut down on creaminess.  Also added a couple cloves of minced garlic.  Still, tasted just like a baked potato.  Kids wouldn't eat it, but I think they just didn't like the look of it.

This is a  good soup, I used 3 baking potato and the rest regular and I used 2 cups of half and half then veggie broth mixed with it and I still had to use more later to thin it! I don't think you need to use all those potato's but whatever you want, this is a good soup on a winter's day.

Fast, easy, and good!!!  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and I did not peel--I just cut them in large chunks.   The most time-consuming part of this recipe is waiting for the potatoes to cook in the microwave.

Out of this world!!!  I actually only use about 4 or 5 potatoes instead of 9.  I use about a whole pound of bacon.  Also, I saute the green onions before adding them to the soup so they will be tender. My whole family loves this soup!

Good basic overall recipe that can be tweaked to a person's preference.  I followed others advice and sauteed a bit of onion and garlic in the butter.  In the end, I still thought this soup needed a bit more flavor, maybe could have used garlic salt or onion salt.  I'm thinking it would be easier to peel, dice, boil, and then just drain the potatoes since microwaving them caused mine to have a few hard spots in them, though I may have microwaved them too long.

Just made this tonight. Delicious! The only things I changed was I cubed the potatoes after cooking them, used real bacon that I cooked and crumbled and used skim milk and lite margarine. Very good!

Excellent recipe and easy to make with all the ingredients that I normally have at hand any way. Very rich and creamy soup even when I opted for light sour cream and skim milk instead. Coupled the soup with a crusy bread ... Shared the soup with my retired neighbor who is known to be an excellent cook and she asked for the recipe! The thumbs up also came from my rather picky of an eater daughter who said the recipe is a keeper :)

I loved it!  My kids enjoyed it too. Dad can't wait to come home and try it. The only differences were, I used 2% and plain yogurt (since that's what I had).  I only microwaved the potatoes for 6 minutes/ three.  I think I would do a tad longer next time, but not much.  Also, I chunked them instead of just scooping them out. Peeled the skin first.  I can't wait for the leftovers.

Oh so very, very good.  I'm crazy for a super thick potato soup and this fit the bill perfectly.  I did all of my potatoes in the oven for an hour (from other reviews, sounds like the time is about equivalent).  I made half of a recipe (still SO much soup!), using Brummel & Brown yogurt-based "butter," 2 cups of 2% milk, 1 cup of skim milk, and low fat sour cream.  Plenty thick and rich, even with the lighter dairy products.  Used fully leaded cheese...I just don't think the low fat stuff melts right!  This was incredibly easy to make...thank you!

Heavenly!  I followed the recipe for the most part, but sauteed an onion and added that to the flour, margarine & milk mixture, and later added low fat cheese, scallions, bacon & a tablespoon of low fat sour cream.  This soup does need a bit of additional salt & pepper.  I used skim milk to cut down on some of the fat, and replaced the butter with margarine (reduced the amount, too).    It was so good that I had it for breakfast the following day!

This is a great and super easy soup!  Delicious.  I made it really easy by using a bag of cubed hash brown potatoes.  Just thaw and add when the recipe says.  thanks for a yummy recipe!

One word - YUM.... total comfort food. I used fat free milk, reduced fat cheddar cheese, low fat sour cream, real bacon. This was the richest soup, can't even imagine using whole everything. One bowl is more then enough. Was worried the soup wouldn't get thick, because the milk and flour didn't thicken - boy was I wrong. The soup was thick, but not too thick. Oh my, soooo good....

Excellent!  We used real bacon instead of bacon bits, both times we made this.  I'm sure it improved the flavor.  It was wonderful and adults and children enjoyed it!  Thank you for a great recipe!!

I thought this was good.  I subbed non fat milk, reduced fat cheese and reduced fat sour cream with no problem.  I cut down on the butter & flour to about 1/2 cup each beacuse other reviews had said the soup was thick.  It was still really thick so I added some water.

Very satisfying.  I used 5 large russet (baked) potatoes.  I carved out the insides as well as added some skin into the soup.  I also used 4 cups of 1% low-fat milk and 2 cups of chicken broth and used less cheese (8oz instead of 10oz).  Family loved it.  Definitely a keeper!

This is the best potato soup i've ever had! And I am picky. It's so thick and delicious and the best part is that it's relatively easy. you could microwave or bake the potatoes in the oven. And i always try potato soup when i get the chance and i've yet to find one better than this recipe!

Our new family favorite soup.  Will never make plain old potato soup again.  Definitely don't have to use all that flour and butter!  1/3 c of each is perfect.

This is a great soup.  I see that a lot of cooks complained about this being too thick and that they tried to remedy this with more milk.  It's not the milk that makes it thick it's the roux (flour and butter mixture) reduce it and it'll be less thick.

I am rating this a 4star because I think that the fat and calorie content is insane!  It's a great soup that can be easily modified to be healthier.  Trust me; you definitely don't need whole milk!  I used 3 cups of skim milk and 3 cups of chicken broth, light sour cream, and a combination of light butter and olive oil and it still turned out ridiculously rich.  I sauteed onions in the butter along with some diced celery at the start of the recipe to add a little depth and flavor.  This really got rave reviews at my house and is worth the effort but you really don't have to clog an artery to enjoy this soup.

Absolutely phenomenal! I fried the bacon and used the grease for the gravy in place of the butter; it gives the soup an ever richer taste. This soup is FANTASTIC! Better than any restaurant soup we've ever had. And to think I was just shooting for 'pretty good.' My husband says it's the best soup he's ever had. :) YUM!

delicious soup! I did use some vegetable broth to get it to my desired consistancy as well as chopped up some carrots and celery very finely just to add a little extra nutrition for the kids. Everyone enjoyed it, even my picky kids! Served it with crusty bread! A delicious hearty tummy warming soup! I'll make this often!

Mmmmm, very good! I did put it in the crockpot prior to adding the sour cream. It was in for about 5 hours and it did stick some to the sides...We weren't home, but next time I will watch it closely if using the crockpot.  Definitely will be making again!

We've been making this recipe for over a year now, and absolutely love it.  We make half a batch, usually, which makes 4 generous servings.  For leftovers, we just add a little bit of milk to the soup and heat.  This soup is perfect with sandwiches or a crusty bread for dipping, and is better than what you'll get at a restaurant.  No advice for tweaking - I think it's perfect as written! Thanks!

This is a great potato soup recipe.  It was a little thick for my family so I added some chicken stock to thin it out some.  Turned out fantastic!  We will have this again soon.

Soooo Yummy! I don't usually like to make recipes that so many reviewers have had to make changes to since it's a little intimidating to me as a new cook. But, I followed a few suggestions by using real bacon, 7 potatoes, only a 1/2 cup of flour and 8oz of cheese. Based on my personal preference in milk, I used 2 cups of 2% and 4 cups of 1% rather than the suggested 6 cups of whole. Great taste, great consistency and definitely something I will be making again in the near future. (I only gave it 4 stars because I did not follow the recipe as listed. However, the final product deserves 5+ stars!)

This recipe is good but a bit too heavy for us to have on a regular basis so I started tinkering with it. Now when I make this soup I start off by mashing the potatoes and using skim milk in them. Then I saute a clove or two of crushed garlic in the pot, add chicken broth as my liquid instead of whole milk and then add everything else.

This was great soup and so easy to make.  I do wish I'd taken one reviewers advise and substituted some of the milk for chicken broth.  It was a little too creamy and rich for us.  I also added the garlic and minced onion and I only put in about 1 cup of cheese.

This is a good recipe, but a bit thick. No biggie, just thin it out with chicken stock. I did add a bit to the ingrediants and the method. I fried up 1/2 Lb. of bacon and then removed it from the dutch oven.  In the bacon grease I added a Tbs. butter and then sauteed diced onion, celery, and then garlic. Thickened with flour, and then seasoned with quite a bit of pepper, and a bit of salt and garlic powder. For the liquid I used 2c whole milk, 2c half and half, 1 cup skim milk and 2 cups stock.  I also added corn, and only used 1/2 the sour cream. I tend to use a lot of veggies so I uped my qty's on all of those.  Very hearty!

Creamy, tasty, quick and easy.  I didn't have whole milk, so I used 1 cup heavy cream and 5 cups 2% milk.  The dried spices and hot sauce add just the right amount of flavor.  Used the leftover potato skins to make potato skins as an appetizer.  Just season and deep fry (or brush with oil and broil) top with cheddar, bacon bits and green onion and bake until cheese is melted. Serve with sour cream....my guys loved this meal.

Wonderful, filling soup! I loved not only eating this hearty meal, but as a novice, it couldn't have been easier to make. I did alter slightly: 1/2 cup flour, eight ounces of cheese (packages of shredded cheese come in 8 and 16-ounce portions, so there you go), and the freshly cooked and crumbled bacon (six strips) was the right choice over bacon bits. Perfection!

I made this today and I did as others suggested and cut down the flour to 1/3 cup and it was plenty you have to remember that the potatos and cheese will help to thicken it up as well.  Also I thought that 9 bakeing potatos was a lot so I bought and baked  6 and I only used 3  so I belive that if your using large bakeing potatos you dont need but 3 or 4 you may use 9 if all you have are the little ones. The taste was great and this is a keeper for cold and rainy days.

Excellent recipe..but I did make some adjustments.  I used only 1/3c flour (believe me-it's enough) and I sauteed half an onion and 4 or 5 cloves of garlic and added it to the soup.  I also cooked half a package of real bacon (low sodium), substituted chicken broth and skim milk for some of the whole milk and added all 4 stalks of green onions into the soup.  I also found it needed more salt and cheese than called for.  And lastly, I used yukon gold potatoes (left the skins on).  It turned out fantastic!

After reading all the reviews that this soup was a little TOO thick, I cut back on the roux (used 1/2 cup flour and butter)and added extra milk (actually, I used half & half). If you want to eat this as a stew-type meal, leave it as is; if you're counting on a chowder-type soup, dilute it a little. A tablespoon or so of powdered chicken bouillon will give it a bit of extra flavor. I liked the suggestion to serve the cheese, bacon and scallions on the side; this keeps the soup "pure" and people can doctor it as they like. This was really tasty and great for these cool autumn days!

I have made this recipe a couple of times and LOVE it! It is creamy and has the chunks of potatoes that I really enjoy. My husband who is not a big fan of potato soup really enjoys this as well. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is a great recipe, however when I looked over the nutritional value, I found the calorie and fat content to be rather high. I am on Weight Watchers and when I calculated how many points I would be using, it came to 11 points!! That is a lot just to use on one serving of soup. I converted to using lighter versions, e.g. fat free margarine instead of the butter, low-fat cheddar cheese, skim milk instead of whole, and reduced fat sour cream. The lighter version cuts 157 calories and 22.4 fat grams, for a total of 6 points per serving. MUCH healthier for you with the same great taste!

FABULOUS. I've made this for my family several times and we LOVE it. It is better with real bacon though, but it's great with the bottled bacon pieces too.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I changed a few things by adapting it to a crock pot. I slow cooked the potatoes in chicken broth for a couple of hours with the bacon and onions. Close to serving I added the cheddar and sour cream. YUM! We loved it.

this really wasn't very good. it was VERY floury. it's basically a roux gravy with potatoes & other ingredients stirred in. it was good enough that i finished my bowl, but i'm not going to make it again.

This was very good and very easy!  The recipe doesn't say how to take the potatoes out of the the skin (mash or cut up)  So, I peeled the potatoes after they were microwaved, and then cut them into chunks.  They do cook down in the soup.  I also didn't have any cheddar cheese on hand, so I used about 8 oz. of Velvetta (processed cheese spread).  And it worked very well.  I did throw all the bacon (I used real bacon cut up) into the soup.  Just remember to cook the soup on a very low heat, and don't let it boil (it can cause the cheese and milk to seperate).  It does thicken very quickly.  Very good recipe, thanks!

This recipe was amazing! it was the perfect consistency just like the restaurants. My whole family loved it. I made a double batch and only put in one can of evaporated milk and it still was creamy and just thick enough. Great recipe for those cold nights!

This soup is so good it's addicting.  It goes together pretty quickly because you can microwave the potatoes while you are starting the soup.  My potatoes were a little on the small side so I used 11 instead of nine.  When I scooped out the flesh, I left them in nice chunks and didn't mash it so we didn't have the mashed potato flavor that others have said.  I made this with cheddar bay biscuits (from this site).  I will be making this again and again.

The soup was great and I received lots of compliments.  I made a double batch for tailgating.  It does take a long time to make.  And I made the mistake of putting it in the fridge overnight.  DON'T DO THAT.  It will be a large pot of mashed potatoes the next morning.  I had to add about 1/2 gallon of milk and some chicken broth to thin it out. My mistake, But everyone loved it anyway.

As it is this recipe is bland. I added pressed garlic, garlic salt, seasoning salt, black pepper, salt, extra green onions (white and green parts). You do need to add seasonings/spices to your liking, which helps to make it a flavorful soup. Not bad after you add a lot more seasonings.

I was worried about using so much milk instead of cream, as a recipe a relative gave me called for cream, but truthfully the soup came out more perfect than I ever imagined. I doubled the recipe and made the soup for an even at work. The success was huge, my soup was the most eaten out of five other choices! People are still complimenting me the next week several times a day. The only thing I did differently is add cornstarch to achieve a thicker, creamier consistancy. The soup was not bland, but I have thought about it and would like to add a small amount of onion powder and a good amount of garlic powder next time to make the flavor even more full and well rounded. Awesome Recipe!!! You WILL be impressed. Oh, and who knew microwaves would make excellent baked potatoes?

This soup was wonderful.  I added a packet of the Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing and Seasoning mix to it.  It added just the right extra flavor.

This was pretty good, but a little bland. I think it would be better w/ some carrots and/or broccoli--would also give it some color. It came out super-thick. I had to add more milk to it. This would be great on a cold winter night. One bowl fills you up. One more thing, this recipes makes lot's! You'll have enough for the next night. I will make again adding the veggies. Thanks for sharing.

If you want a delicious & filling stick-to-your-ribs soup, this is the one for you.  I halved the recipe, used 3 potatoes, a little less flour than called for, and skim milk.  Also, I added some extra milk towards the end to make it a little more soupy and left the potatoes in small chunks.  These things combined made for a perfect consistency-- since previous reviews clued me in that it tended to be a bit thick.  VERY VERY tasty though...it's got a permanent spot in my collection.

SOOOO GOOD!  I took some others advice and used 1% milk and fat free sour cream, then used chicken broth to thin it out because even then it was very thick.  Also, I cut the potatoes in chunks and kept skins on instead of using just the insides...kept it from becoming "mashed potato-y". Very filling and very good! The leftovers were great as well!!!

We've tried several potato soup recipes, and this is one of the best. 
My changes: omitted the sour cream and scallions (didn't have them), and added a few TBSP (to taste) of french onion chip dip.  I also added about a half cup of chicken stock to thin it some, but would've been Ok without.  Delicious!

Very thick soup!  I used 5 cups 1% milk and 1 cup chicken broth, did not add bacon and used less cheese than recipe called for.  Baked and scooped potatoes day before and that was a time saver the day I made the soup.

My mom made this first, we loved it!  Very thick but makes a great meal.  I tried it today, didn't have cheddar cheese so I substituted with the four cheese italiano...great flavor.  I will make it again and I have passed the recipe on to friends!

This was just too rich for me.  My husband liked it better than I did, but we wouldn't make it again.

This was really good! I didn't think it was too thick at all, but I used skim milk instead of the whole, which probably thinned out the consistency a bit.

I had been looking for what seemed like ages for a great potato soup recipe and I finally found it.  This soup was more like a stew it was soo thick. I didn't have any bacon or green onions so I just omitted them. I added 1oz of Monteray Jack cheese in addition to the cheddar cheese and I subsituted a cup of 1/2 & 1/2 for a cup of the whole milk. I also seasoned the potatoes with garlic powder, a little onion powder and some creole seasoning before I added them into the soup. I chopped up some frozen broccoli spears and tossed them in when I mixed in the sour cream. It was sooooo tasty, I can't wait to make it again. My picky fiance even liked it!!! Leftovers the next day were really chunky and he said that it would be great as a dip for some crackers. Hmmmmm he might be onto something there, if I try it I'll let everyone know. But this is definatly a keeper in my "recipe" book.

Quite delicious!  We only used 8 (rather large) potatoes.  As others have mentioned, it is a fairly thick soup.  We left our potatoes in good sized chunks, and used reduced fat versions of the dairy products.  I think these things helped it remain soupy rather than mashed-potato-y.  Only other note is that we used real bacon rather than bacon bits.  Very yummy, thanks!  ETA:  the leftovers (we had TONS left as there are only 2 of us) were NOT too good.  It did get thick and mashed potato like and kind of icky.  The bacon got soggy...blah.  I'm not taking away a star in my rating, because I did really enjoy it when it was first made.  But if you're like me and like to have some leftover for lunch or so you don't have to cook dinner the next day, this isn't the recipe for you.  In the future, I'll only make this for a large group of people (or make a much smaller batch for just my husband and I).

This was yummy. My all my boys loved it. I would however modify for next time. It needs a bit more seasoning, perhaps more salt as it is somewhat bland tasting. And it needs more milk. Mine was the consistancy of mashed potatoes. Overall a great recipe and very workable. Totally hit the spot since its pouring outside. Also put some fresh crusty french bread on the table to dip with!

I haven't tried this recipe but it is almost exactly like my baked potato soup recipe that I adapted from a million recipes I had tried over time.  The only difference I saw was that I only use about 2lbs. of baking potatoes.  It is usually only about 3 potatoes. I would imagine 9 would make a very thick soup.  The sour cream is the most important secret ingredient to good baked potato soup.

This was EXCELLENT!!  My husband has a new favorite.  I recommend that you have a can of chicken broth on hand in case you do not like the thick consistency.  This is great for a cold night.

Great soup!  I lowered the butter and flour mixture and used a combo of 2% and skim milk.  It still came out extremely thick and I had to add even more milk to thin it.  I added about half of the cheese and sour cream to the entire soup mixture and left the rest to put on top of individual serving bowls.  The next day leftovers were the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Still yummy but I think next time I might cut down to using about 6 potatoes and only skim milk.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

There is a local rasturant that used to make this once a week or so and I always stopped in to have it for lunch. Sadly, I don't get to stop in for lunch anymore but now that I have this recipe I won't have to miss it anymore!!! I agree if you want to save some for later then wait to add the sour cream until just before serving.  Don't hold back with the toppings in the end!!!!  DELICIOUS THANK YOU!

Absolutely delicious.  I agree with other posters, though, that it was too thick.  I thinned it with one cup of chicken broth, but next time, I think I'll try it with half the roux.  I used skim milk and light sour cream, 1/2 the pepper, along with real bacon and the flavors blended beautifully.  Can't wait to have it again!

My fiance and I are grateful for this recipe.  We dared to make many substitutions because he cannot have dairy:  the milk for rice milk, the butter for Smart Balance butter, and we reduced the amount of sour cream (we actually used soy sour cream).  Even I, who is in LOVE with real potato soup, really enjoyed this soup with the alterations.  Thank you!

This potato soup is a big hit in my house!  My family now thinks I am the best soup cook around!  I did change one thing, I replaced 1/2 of the milk with half and half.  This made it a little bit richer, as if it really needed to be. Thank you.  Murene

This soup is extremely thick, even when substituting skim milk for whole milk. It has a chowder or stew like consistency. Great with white corn added. Very easy and good!

It's a delicious recipe, but the potatoes weren't scoopable even after 9 minutes in the microwave so I had to peel them with a knife...that's the most painstaking part of this recipe. I also subbed unsweetened almond milk for the whole milk and it was great!

This was a bit bland but made a nice base. If you add onions and celery, white pepper and chicken stock it helps make a tasty thick soup.

I added some vegetables to the mix: shredded carrot, sliced celery, and diced onion.  Before adding the vegetables in with the potatoes, I sauteed them separetely in a pan with some bacon fat that I had saved.

This was more like the thickest mashed potatoes I can imagine. I added more milk and more chicken broth but it was still extremely thick, even for mashed potatoes.  We will not make it again.

Love it! I had all ingredients on hand except for green onions, so just omitted. Used red potatoes because I had a 3 lb bag I had to use up. Used 2% milk, and less cheese because I only had a third of a bag. Turned out great!

It turned out beautifully. Tastes so creamy and cheesy yet I can still taste the potatoes. Only thing I added was ground thyme. Love this recipe.

I cut this in half because I didn't need so much soup. It went together beautiful and I loved using pre-baked potatoes. So easy. Then I added the cheese and the entire thing globbed up into a mass of goo like mashed potatoes. Tasted ok, but the consistency was way too thick. Not too sure if it was the temperature or the cheese, but I probably won't make this one again. It would make a good topping for shepherds pie.

By far the best potato soup recipe I’ve completed. Don’t let the simplicity of the directions fool you. At the end you get a delicious soup with the right flavor profile and this can easily be altered to jazz it up. I recommend first making it as described then adventure with your modifications. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

I used 5 medium potatoes washed and poked with a fork. I baked them in an oven for 45 minutes at 425. I chopped them into 1 inch cubes with the skin still on. That made this soup so much better!  I’ve always done the microwave and scooped out and had mush. The soup was delicious tonight!

Thought this recipe was very easy and delicious! Took off a star bc it is extremely thick! I used 2% milk and a cup of chicken broth and still very thick... I’m not one to deviate from a recipe but I imagine if you cut the roux down it will be less thick. I will try that next time... I did add more chicken broth to my left overs, about 2 cups to less than half the leftover and it was awesome! So if not cutting down the roux just keep adding broth until you have the consistency you like. Enjoy!

Really great soup! I reduced butter & flour to 1/2 cup for the roux. Used 2 cups milk & 1 quart low-sodium chicken broth. Part of the broth used used to pre cook finely chopped carrot, celery & some onion with about 1/4 tsp of minced garlic. Chopped 6 strips of crisp bacon to add. Used only 1tsp of salt (will use less next time). Yum!,

Good flavor, but too thick. I recommend leaving out the flour as potato starch is a thickening agent on its own.  Additional milk water or broth would help as well. The cheese also gets lost in the soup so i would recomend adding more to the top and not worry about the mixed in cheese.

So delicious! Everyone went back for seconds and has become one of my family's favorite meals. I did follow the advice of others by adding chicken broth as well. You can tailor the thickness/thinness to your liking without affecting the flavor and it's so quick and easy to make.

Delicious soup! Tweaked just a little (of course) Sautéed chopped celery, onions and few carrots (for color) in the butter before proceeding with recipe. Fried bacon instead of store bought bacon bits because I think they taste better. Also used 2 cups chicken broth and 4 cups milk.  This is now my "go to" potato soup recipe!

Liked it a lot!  Great base recipe.  For a variety of reasons had to make some changes.  Already had a lot of leftover oven-backed potatoes - much more flavorful than microwave baked IMHO.  Used regular chopped onion in soup, no bacon, added tblsp  Penzys Fox Point seasoning, no cheese in soup, no sour cream at end, added chicken stock to thin at end.  Nobody wanted any toppers other than pepper.  Received high praise for a great meatless Monday soup.  Will make again when we have leftover baked potatoes.

This soup is amazing!! Used 2% milk instead of while milk and crumbled up fresh bacon. Otherwise followed to the letter and it was perfect. My boyfriend and I both went back for seconds... ok, fine - thirds! ;-)

This soup ROCKS!  My son and husband both love it (so do I) I have made it exactly as the recipe calls for and also split the milk in 1/2 with chicken broth and a little chopped celery and carrots (2 of each) cooked the broth with the celery and carrots then combined them and cooked for about 10 mins (the rest of recipe and cooking as called for) it is truly amazing!  One last compliment... My son had the leftovers the next day and said to me, "mom, you know how some things are better the next day... Well this is one of those things, this is one of my favorite things that you have ever made!" Props to the chef who came up with this!!! OH AND IT IS SIMPLE TO DO, FAST AND MINIMAL CLEAN UP INVOLVED which is even better :)

This was a good soup. I used 7 potatoes, 1% milk and subbed 2 cups of chicken broth for some of the milk.  Also added less salt.

Loved it!  It is very thick so keep some milk handy to thin it out a bit.  Added some garlic powder for extra flavour.

VERY good soup! However, i was quite thick and seemed more like a regular baked potato. Maybe it could've used more milk? Also, I sized the recipe down to 5 servings rather than 12 for just my husband and I and those 5 servings lasted almost a week! I make A LOT of food, but it was just as great as left overs!

Overall good soup.  I only used 8 ounces of shredded cheddar but will probably cut that down to 5 ounces as it was a little too cheesy for my taste.  It gets really thick so I think to reheat leftovers I will add some chicken broth instead of milk.

This is my favorite soup! It's so easy to make! I usually substitute with slim milk, crumbled turkey bacon and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It is still rich and creamy and very easy to make.

This soup is super simple and delicious!  I did make a few changes though. I used 4 cups of whole milk and 3 cups of chicken stock. I also used real bacon and also added ham. I will make this again!

Delicious! Finally a soup my husband loves!  I cut the potatoes into small chunks and boiled them instead of using the microwave. Then, drained most of water and mashed about a third of the potatoes. I also made my own bacon bits.

I made this recipe exactly as written after reading a number of reviews.  I usually tweak recipes but not this one.  I made it for our annual open house and it was fantastic.  Served it with dishes of bacon bits, sour cream and chopped green onion on the side.  It was gone long before anything else and I've had multiple requests for the recipe.  It was super thick and was just what I was expecting.  Thank you for this recipe!

Wow, talk about rich!!  Way too rich to eat more than a single serving (and a small one at that) in one sitting.,  I used light butter and skim milk and it was very rich, however I added a bit more cheese when making the soup.  I did not add sour cream because my family is split on it - it was easy enough to add for those who wanted it.    If you have super large potatoes, like I did, you most likely will need to add additional milk.  It did require a lot more salt and pepper than the recipe stated - I have no idea how much I used, just did it to taste.  We will have again when but more as a starter, like with a grilled steak and vegetables.  Definitely a hit with the kids though.

So good - I'm not a good recipe follower so this one is great - 2% milk, bunches of smaller potatoes, left the skins on!!  Add some other spices and more water because it is thick!!  But the kids love this just like baked potatoes because they get to add the toppings that they like!!!

11-08-15 ~ Great potato soup!  I had a bunch of leftover baked potatoes and was looking for a way to use them up.  This soup is a winner.  We loved the thickness of the soup.  I used 1% milk in place of the whole milk and skipped the bacon since I knew we would be having leftovers and I don't like wimpy bacon, as I knew it would be after the first eating.    I will certainly make extra baked potatoes the next time, just to make this soup again.

Delicious!! Rich and thick, just the way I like it! Instead of bacon bits, I used real bacon and I also diced a yellow onion and sautéed it with some crushed garlic. It was fabulous!! My family loved it!

Very good! I did "tweek" it a bit to my liking. I used half 2% milk and half chicken broth, eliminated the cheese only because I didn't have any, and used yellow onion cooked in vs. the green onion. Very tasty!

Tasty soup. Made it with my mom. We baked the potatoes instead of microwaving, and we used two cups chicken broth and three and a half cups milk. Didn't have green onions, so we threw in some dried parsley for color. Came out well, and family enjoyed it. Was an easy and quick meal for a weekday night.

My family loves this recipe.  Instead of using bacon bits, I use lean bacon. I also substitute 3 cups of the 6 cups of milk with chicken broth. Absolutely love this recipe.

I cooked my potatoes in chicken broth . After my potatoes were cooked I drained the water from it and kept it in a separate bowl. I minced 1/2 a sweet onion and fried it. Next, I made my roux and added the milk slowly, then brought it to a boil. I placed most of the potatoes, black pepper, celery, fried onions, parsley, garlic powder, some of the roux and milk mixture, and some of the remaining broth in the blender on the highest setting. I then poured the mixture back into the pot and added the rest of potatoes to it. It turned out great!

Excellent!!  I agreed the recipe by using one stick of butter and omitted the cheese. This was by far the BEST loaded potato soup I've ever made!!!  Delish!!

Based on what others said, I used low-fat versions of the sour cream and milk.  I diced the potatoes and boiled them, using the water as the base. (I made the roux separately and added it in.)  I used the salt to flavor the potatoes as they boiled.  My family loved this and we'll definitely be making it again!

Loved this recipe, with this one addition. We took the potato skins, lad them on a cookie sheet, sprayed them with pam, sprinkled with season salt & baked for 10-15 minutes until golden & crispy. We ate them with our soup instead of bread.

Okay, everyone will probably get mad bc I changed the recipe just a tad. I peeled, diced, and boiled my potatoes in chicken broth until they were tender. I also made a roux with the flour and butter. I gradually added the milk and would whisk the white sauce as it thickened. I also added some of the potato water with the chicken broth to the sauce( maybe 2 cups total) My husband and I love cheesey potato  soup so I diced a 1/3 log of velvetta (bc I like to use velvetta in soups and sauces). I added the cheese a little at a time to incorporate it into the sauce. When the sauce was done, I mixed the potatoes and the left over 2 cups of broth into the sauce. I let it simmer on the stove for 30 minutes and added the sour cream. I served the bacon, green onions and shredded cheese on the top. It was divan. The only difference was adding the cheese and broth. I would have to say the next day it was thick but still yummy. It's the best potato recipe I have found so far and now I am done looking.

This is a very great base. I gave it a 4 star because it's not perfect. The following changes made it just right for my taste:
-substitute 2 cups of milk for 2 cups of chicken broth
-If using whole milk, dilute it by substituting maybe 1/2 cup of it with water
-Add Créole and more Salt to taste

Perfection. Likely the best soup I've ever made. The only thing I did differently was bake the potatoes in the oven but ingredients were exact to the recipe. It was SO simple and absolutely delicious. The consistency with the scooped out  baked potatoes vs. cut up was perfection. We will definitely be making this again and again.

I love this recipe although I don't recommend doing the potatoes in the microwave if yours is tiny like mine. I did it that way the first time and almost killed my microwave. Otherwise, the only change I make is to use 2% milk instead of whole because I just don't have any other use for whole milk. Excellent soup and everyone always wants the recipe.

Made potato skins the night before, used the potato flesh for the soup next day. EXCELLENT! Recipe is very thick, but can be easily thinned down if preferred with some extra milk without altering the flavor outcome of the dish. Do yourself a favor and use the whole milk, then use some low fat milk to thin the dish as necessary and some sea salt to flavor. REAL BACON PLEASE! I left out the cheddar cheese and just used it for a garnish at the table.  This soup is very easy to make and at  least as good if not better than any you will get at the better restaurants you will eat at.

I love it! Instead of putting the potatoes in the microwave, I just boiled them. Then when the potatoes were done I put them in a bowl and mashed them slightly. Then I followed the rest of the directions. Instead I used ham then bacon. I also added broccoli, garlic, basil, celery, and yellow onions to the soup. Super yummy! I served it with bread on the side.

Delicious! I ended up saying forget it to the salt and pepper in the giant bowl and told people to salt and pepper it themselves because it wasn't getting the just right amount that I wanted. It was thick and when I put it in the fridge for leftovers it ended up looking like mashed potatoes, but if you microwave it its fine. I also added more cheese on top than actually in the big pot of it. I think next time I would add a tad less sour cream, it was a bit too much but that's personal taste, and I'm a vegetarian so I did not use the bacon so that may have made a difference in the sour cream strength. I will definitely be making this again. Also, I used low fat milk and it turned out just fine.

This is my favorite soup recipe.  It makes a very thick and rich soup.  At first I was not pleased with how much I burned my fingers cooking and peeling the potatoes in the microwave as directed.  I recommend peeling and cubing the potatoes then cook them in boiling water until they can be pierced with a fork.  (I usually can get all the other ingredients cut, grated and measured out about the same time the potatoes are ready, give or take a few mins)  Then strain and slightly mash with a fork or potato masher.  No burnt fingers!

Loved it! I will say I thought it may have been hazardous to my microwave... next time I will oven bake the potatoes rather than microwave them. I used real bacon, and substituted as much bacon fat as I could for the butter in the recipe. It needed extra milk to thin it out (and it's still super thick). Added a little parsley and onion powder for flavor. Turned out very well, will make again! Thanks.

I have to agree with others that, as written, this soup comes out way too thick, for our liking.  I had to add quite a bit of water to get it to a somewhat "soup-like" consistency.  In addition, for our tastes, it did not have much flavor and I ended up doctoring it up with several spices.  I did appreciate the method of microwaving the potatoes, as I found that to be a great time saver, especially since I cut the recipe in half and only had to nuke four potatoes.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, TLNATION!

Excellent!  Entire picky family loved it.  I made some changes to decrease the fat content by using skim milk and cut the sour cream in half.

The whole family loved this- even my youngest who is very picky! Only a couple tweaks- I used 6 potatoes, chopping 4 and grating 2. I also grated a carrot to add color. Thanks for a new staple meal for our family!

This soup was fantastic! Couple things to change though:

When mixing in the milk (I used 1% for a healthier option) with the flour, I noticed that the milk was not thickening! All I did was add the potatoes and the rest of the ingredients and put the lid on and viola! The starch from the potatoes thickened the soup. 

Another problem was that I was in a bit of a rush and I therefore didn't microwave the potatoes, instead I let them boil in the soup mix when I added them! Turned out great!!

Thank you for the base of the soup.  Made this gluten free by using GF flour and a tablespoon of arrow root.  Made the rough, added a diced yellow onion, sauteed for a few minutes and added some minced garlic. Baked the potatoes in the over for an hour prior to beginning.  Lastly subbed out a cup of milk (1%) with a cup of homemade vegetable stock.  

I cook a lot and normally need to tweak recipes.  This was a really good one and only required a few changes for me.

This is sooooo good! I used skim milk and still came out nice and thick! Don't know if it matters but I used white potatoes. Also, used an extra teaspoon of pepper and a couple dashes of cajun seasoning since we like our foods spicier. This is company worthy and will definitely be making this again!!!! Better than restaurant!

Best potatoe soup-ever!
I made a few tweaks. The potatoes I had were small so I doubled up.  I didn't have as much chicken broth on hand and did 1 cup chicken broth, 6 cups of milk and the viscosity of the soup was perfect. I used fellow reviewer's tip of adding a celery stalk, carrot and onion. But I grilled them up using same pan I used for bacon and used the juices from the bacon with veggies. Plus...I added cream cheese (about 4 oz) and a little Parmesan cheese. I did use low fat for sour cream and cream cheese to curb some calories.  I always appreciate everyones' reviews and tips, so I wanted to be a contributor. Enjoy-perfect for a cold fall day!

This is my 2nd comment on this soup.  Made it for my folks who are both under the weather. They LOVED it!  My mom is an amazing cook so getting her ok says a lot about this recipe.  As a note:  I use skim milk because that is what I have in the house. Whole milk certainly works but using skim is ok too.

YUM!!!!! Total 5 stars. I did make some changes. With the changes it is the perfect potato soup. We cooked the potatoes and cut them into chunks. I used real bacon that was cooked to a crisp. We also used about 1 cup of regular onion. Everything else we did exactly the same.

This is a delicious recipe!!!! Made it tonight and my husband and three kiddos loved it. I how ever used both bacon grease and chicken broth to make the roux. Outside of that would not change a thing. Thank you!!!! And just a little note it is a lot so if you have small family you may want to cut it in about half there is 5 of us and plenty left over.

I change this recipe quite a bit to make it somewhat healthier - 3 Sweet Potatoes, 1 head of cauliflower, 2 regular potatoes w/skin for the potatoes (cut in chunks and roasted first); 2 cup broth and skim milk for whole milk; low fat sour cream.  Then I ruined it (ha) by using real bacon cooked on a George Forman grill until crispy - and then the fat dripped off.  VERY THICK - really almost like milky mashed potatoes.  Froze in individual containers for reheating in the microwave for work lunch.  Very yummy - but with my changes you definitely get more of a sweet potato taste!

This soup is delicious and easy. I do recommend baking the potatoes in a regular oven if you have a whimpy little microwave like I do since mine nearly died after doing three batches of potatoes. Oh, and make sure you have milk on hand to thin it if you end up with leftovers because it does get quite thick.

Tried this tonight. Made a half recipe for my boyfriend and I. Didn't have enough milk, so I added 4 ounces of cream cheese and 1 1/3 cups of chicken broth instead of the last cup of milk! Accidentally forgot the sour cream, but it didn't matter. Best home made potato soup I've ever made!

Not bad! It turned out to be a kind of a cream soup for me. I used turkey bacon, but unfortunately I didn't have cheddar cheese or chives, though I'm sure it would have made it fantastic. It came out really thick, as other people have stated, but adding some extra milk would definitely help thin it out. Anyway it kept us full and made a lovely quick new years eve dish. I'll problably make it again, thanks TLNATION!

It almost tastes like your eating a really yummy cheesy baked potato.  But I used turkey bacon, which for the future I think you need to cook it and then crumble it and fry again so it stays extra crispy.  I also used 2% milk and I would wager to say you can drop down to 1% milk with no issue.

Delicious. I only made a couple of changes.  Added one minced onion to the butter and sautéed. After I put in the milk and potatoes, I put half in the blender to puree. Added it back to the rest of the soup. That made it thick without adding flour. I did add a tbs of chicken "better than Bouillon" to enhance the flavor. My family loved it!

Super thick!  I even halved the milk and used half chicken broth thinking it would thin it out a little since so many of the reviews commented on how thick it is. Next time I think I'll leave out a couple of the potatoes.  Tastes fantastic though!

I loved this easy soup. It is a big hit with my family too!  It is very thick, which is how my husband likes his potato soup.  The left overs were too thick to reheat as soup, so I mashed them into my mashed potatoes the next night and they were awesome also!  Thanks!

I used 12 potatoes since that's what was in the bag.  I left the skins on, and just cut in large chunks then used my immersion blender to make creamier.  I added 1 cup chx broth to thin since I added extra potatoes.  I used 2 c whole and 4 c skim milk.  This was fine.  The family enjoyed it, but it was not a "top 10."

It's very good, but my husband didn't like the thickness.  Next time I make it I'll try less flour.  I used 1% milk because that's what I had.
He has to take some soup to a guys weekend and I think I'll send along a can of chicken broth to thin it out when he warms it.

Super easy and delicious, it's a keeper!  Instead of cheddar, I used Sargento shredded Pepperjack cheese, try it, you won't regret it!

True, the last baked potato soup recipe you'll need!  I used two huge baking potatoes, halved the remaining ingredients, and omitted sour cream (because I was out) and it was delicious!  The only thing I don't get is the 1+ hr prep time-this is fast, easy and wonderful!

Very good soup. Not a good choice for those watching their caloric intake. This recipe makes a very thick soup, but nothing a little more milk can't fix (or chicken broth as others have said). Hits you like a ton of bricks quickly, so this works perfect if you have family members with a bottomless pit. Perfect for cold, blah days.

This is one of those recipes where I have to wonder where the top photo for the recipe came from. Mine looked nothing like mashed poatoes. My potatoes were a little small, possibly, but my soup looked like soup. I wanted to lower the fat/sat. fat content so I used all low-fat dairy products and even used half the amount of cheddar cheese called for. I am so glad I did that, because with half the cheese, it tasted like a soup version of cheesy potatoes. I did also just add a couple sprinkles of black pepper to as I am not a fan of it. It is a little work to make, but I liked that I could microwave the potatoes while I did other things. It even gave them time to cool before scooping out the potato. I also used pre-cooked bacon to save time that I microwaved until crisp. I wouldn't call this a traditional tasting potato soup, but I am sure it will all get eaten.

You have got to add a teaspoon or two of Cayenne pepper or you're just not having potato soup. Yum!

Super.  I did make a few changes.  I took the advice of others and used skim milk.  I used low fat sour cream and only 4 large potatos.  I also added a large onion, which I sauteed in the butter.  We still thought it was too thick, so I added about a cup of chicken stock, which was an ingredient I saw in the restaurant-quality baked potato soup.  I also stole a couple other things from that recipe and added 1/2 teaspoon dried basil and 1/8 tsp thyme.  This is creamy, cheese and amazing.

I so wanted to, but I couldn't get it to work.  Perhaps I could have salvaged it with a lot more time.  But all I had was milk with potato lumps.

Love, love, love this soup recipe.  The only change I made was to use American cheese instead of Cheddar.  I prefer the taste of American and it doesn't get stringy.  My family loved the soup too.  I usually make the Cheeseburger soup recipe from this site,however, this is just as good.  Will definately make this one again, and again, and again!!!!!!!!!!

This is far and away the best soup I've ever eaten at home or in a restaurant.  For the cheese, I used a chunk of Stilton that I had on hand and it couldn't have been better.  Served it as an entree with fresh, out-of-the-oven olive bread. Perfect cold weather comfort food.

This was good!  I went ahead and baked my potatoes earlier in the day since I had time.  I used olive oil and coarse salt and baked for about 1.5 hours.  I then diced up real bacon and browned it and then poured out most of the grease, added flour to that for the roux.  I also added in some mexican velveeta near the end because I needed to use it up.  Oh, and 2% milk because that's what we drink.  Crusty bread and a nice salad rounded out the meal.

We love this soup. I followed one of the reviews and sauteed one grated carrot, some chopped celery, 2 garlic cloves sliced and 1/2 chopped onion in the butter.  Only used 1/2 cup butter, and 1/2 cup flour.  Used 2 cups chicken broth and 4 cups 2% milk.  Pureed vegetables, leaving butter in pan to thicken flour.  Pureed 1/2 the potates in the chicken broth and left some in chunks.  This soup will be a regular recipe in our house.  Didn't want to cook the bacon so we had it without and it was great.

I would love to give ths 5 stars, but I changed it slightly...I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth in my crock pot, then added the roux and milk, along with some bacon and green onion.  It was the BEST potato soup I have ever made, or eaten.  It tasted just like a steakhouse potato soup.  This will be a staple this winter!

Made this exactly as written (but doubled it) for a church soup supper.  Used real butter, sour cream, etc.  It was a huge hit!  I will make this again and again.  Absolutely delicious.

I will NEVER go to Panera Bread again! This soup was DELICIOUS!!! I added an extra potato, because I thought the potatoes I was using were kind of small.   Also, I found it very difficult to mix all of the flour in with the butter. I thought the mixture would get way too dry, so I just added as much of the flour as I could and then added the rest as I added the milk. I used margarine, self-rising flour (that's all we had), and whole milk. The soup came out very thick. Next time, I will add some chicken broth.  This soup was SO delicious though, and super easy. Great recipe.

I made the soup and modified it a bit I used 3 cups 2% milk and added 3 cups chicken broth to that I did not use green onions orthe cheese but would have if we had them but it was great without them best potato soup ever I do think the chicken broth made the difference.

Excellent soup.  All 6 family members loved it and asked for seconds.  I too used 2% milk and reduced fat sour cream and cheese.  Also added a cup and a half of chicken broth at the end to thin it a bit - it is very thick and filling.  Wonderful and will make again.  Thanks!

Excellent flavor! A little thick, but can be thinned with a little chicken stock/broth.

OMG!!! This was amazing. I went to Houlihans for their baked potato soup, then made this. I don't need to order it there anymore. My boyfriend and I loved it and will be making it again often.

This soup was delicious but I agree with the other reviewers that it is way too thick when made as the recipe calls for.  I added a cup of chicken broth to then and you could still eat it with a fork.  Overall, it's a great recipe but be sure to have milk and broth on hand to thin to soup consistency.

Did I miss something? This was good, but was lacking seasoning or something. It was also real thick. It was like eating a loaded baked potato in a bowl with a spoon, and calling it soup. Is that bad? NO WAY! I just don't know what step I missed to make this amazing. It was also pretty high maintenance in my opinion; less can be so much more. I feel mean on this rating, but being truthful.

Just made this for tonight's dinner.  The texture was wonderful, it was easy to make though it did take me much longer than 15 minutes.  That's because I baked the potatoes in my advantium oven instead which was a complete waste of time and I cooked real bacon instead of using bacon bits.  My only complaint and the only criticism from my family was that it was a little bland.  I even added more salt and pepper and it still needed a "kick".  Will definitely try again and just change the seasoning.

AMAZING soup!  I try to make it a bit healthier with turkey bacon,  fat free cheese, fat free sour cream, skim milk, lighter butter...  and it is still one of the creamiest, richest, most delicious things a person can eat.

This wasn't restaurant-quality like I expected.  Not a lot of flavor at all.  This is almost identical to Baked Potato Soup III, on this website.

This was a great soup. The only complaint I had was that it was a bit too much like mashed potatoes...too thick. Definitely a keeper!
Second attempt: I cut the flour by 1/2 and added one cup of chicken broth. This was more consistent with soup yet still tasted of 'baked potato'. My family loves it! Again....definitely a keeper!

This is one of the best soups I have ever had.  It to me is restaurant quality.  The only change I made was I used 2 cups chicken broth and 4 cups of milk.  I have used skim, and 2% and it still is outstanding!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.  My son who is quite picky loves it.

Great recipe.  I changed it up a little bit and used some chicken broth instead of just milk.  Also used lower fat milk.  Instead of putting the sour cream in  during cooking, I waited till right before serving to mix in sour cream, bacon bits, and green onion.

My family ate this without complaint, always a good thing, although when I asked how they liked it, nobody had strong feelings one way or the other. I was trying to replicate potato soup I had in a restaurant but this wasn't quite it. I added extra milk as it was a bit thicker than we like.

I've been making this recipe for about 3 years. It's my absolute favorite soup. I do substitute lower fat milk most of the time. I also cook 1 lb of bacon & crumble for the soup and for topping. It's delicious!

Very good. I used half cream and half skim milk. It was still a little too thick so I had to add some more milk. I also used real bacon that I had fried up instead of bacon bits. Both my husband and I really liked it though. And it made great leftovers.

This was a little too thick for me. I think next time, I would use the flesh of half the potatoes and use boiled chunks of the other half. The soup was a little bit too much like mashed potatoes.  The flavors were good though!

As a vegetarian, married to a meat eater, I am constantly looking for recipes that can be modified to please both, and this definitely worked.  Just before adding the bacon, I split the soup into 2 pots, added bacon to his, and not to mine.  I added artificial bacon bits to mine just before serving, and oh my so good!!!   It is great with or without sour cream as well, depending on how you like your baked potato.  Nice hearty soup, easy to make, easy on the wallet, and easy to modifiy to taste without sacrificing flavor.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

Hubbys favorite soup and he LOVED this one.  This is very hardy and thick.  Used 1% milk and everything was just fine.  Next time I will set my oven to cook the potatoes while I am at work so they are all set when I get home.  Waiting for the microwave to cook the potatoes was the most difficult part of this recipe!

This was fantastic!  Followed recipe exactly.   I used the potato skins to make appetizer potato skins the day before and was happy to finally be able to use the insides.  Thank you so much for sharing.  This is a family favorite for sure.

I made this soup last week for a cold winter day and we loved it.  A week later went to make it again and mistakenly used another Baked Potato Soup recipe that had basil in it.   Big Mistake!!!  They said that recipe was the best but I think this one is more like a baked potato and would therefore qualify as THE BEST BAKED POTATO SOUP (in my humble opinion)

this is sooo good, even my 11 month old kept eating and eating and eating it he loved it! i love thick soups so i kept smashing the potatoes on the sides of the pot with a fork leaving a few chunks in it but it was just a LITTLE too thick for me, so i'll probably add a little more milk next time, very very good and easy soup though!

This is the BEST potato soup.  It is as good if not better than Bennigan's restaurant quality.  Was hoping to have leftovers but the whole family loved it and it's all gone!  I did cut the recipe in half.  Only added a little more milk to the consistency we prefer.  Excellent recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe, the only flaw I found was in the amount of potatoes the recipe called for...If you are doing the original recipe which calls for 9 potatoes, use 9 smaller ones otherwise the soup is thick, almost like mashed potatoes.  If you want to reduce the fat, cook bacon on a George Forman grill! It's definitely better with real bacon!!!

Great soup. Didnt have green onions, but I did add onions to it. I did not change anything or ingredients, and it was great, big hit, and everyone wants me to make it again, just in bigger portion. Very creamy, and filling, great smell in the air, and brings family and friends together on those cold days. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh yes, writing a review about this is making me  crave some. Exactly what the title says, it's a baked potato in soup version. Had it with ribs and it was the bombbb. I got a little worried when I put the milk in and the flour was all clumpy but it was nothing a few minutes of stirring didn't fix. Also it is a very thick soup, I ended up adding a couple cups of milk and water.

Excellent!  Thank you for the best potato soup recipe ever.  I tried others but never liked them. I followed the recipe with a few minor changes...I used 4 cups of milk and 1 can of broth and I omitted the sour cream.  Other than that, I followed the recipe given  and the soup came out "restaurant quality".  YUMMY!!!!!

Great Recipe.  Followed it actually except used what I had on hand (ham instead of bacon and 1% milk).  I did add chicken broth like others suggested and it was still good and thick.  Everyone enjoyed it and overall very easy to cook!

This was fabulous!  Yes, it is very thick but who wants a runny potatoe soup.  Made a few slight adjustments since I like it creamy....Used 3 cups half in half and 2 cups chicken broth instead of 6 cups milk.  Then added broth, a little at a time,  until it was my desired consistency.  Added some garlic powder for flavor and only 1 cup of sour cream.  Stopped at 1 cup sour cream because we were happy with the consitency, could add more if like.  Also, only added 5.5 ounces of shredded cheese.  We felt it was enough, but add to your liking.  Didn't add any on top either, thought it was cheesy enough.  It was delicious, and a little bit goes a long way!!  Didn't need anything else to go with it!

Fantastic!  Loved by the whole family, and the neighbor's kid too.  Followed the recipe as written this time.  Next time I will make with lower fat milk.  This is one seriously thick soup!  I will be making this again.

I made this tonight & we LOVED it! My only changes were I used 2 cups milk, 2 cups heavy cream & 2 cups veggie broth. The heavy cream was unnecessary but I had it in the fridge & it needed to be used. I also added minced garlic.

I made this by cooking real bacon, then browning the onion in a small amount of the bacon fat (and reducing the butter accordingly).  I also found that if you don't have quite enough baking potatoes, you can add a can of whole potatoes.  This is  quick and easy enough for a weeknight supper.

Wow, this soup is fantastic.  Saw the recipe on the website this morning and decided to give it a try.  The pot is on the stove and it's not even time for dinner yet, but I can't keep my family out of it!  We will be making this a lot this winter.

Very delicious! Since I didn't have enough green onions for the recipe, I used regular onion instead. I also added 2 cloves of garlic (I made a 4 serving portion) and omitted the bacon bits to make it vegetarian. Definitely a repeat recipe!

I get asked to make this so much, such a crowd pleaser. Who dosent like a baked potato anyway?  I always bake my potatos the morning of and scoop them when they are cooled for easier prep later. I also use 1% milk, 1/2 containter of sour cream, real bacon chopped, and add garlic for added flavor.  One of my favorite soups for fall and winter!

Wow- this was EXCELLENT!  I didn't have whole milk and just used the Lactaid milk we had.  I added some garlic to the butter before adding the flour.  Everything else I kept the same- but I probably added a little more cheese than what was in the recipe.  It was really easy to pull together and it turned out delicious.  I will definitely make again this winter!!!

Sooo goood! This was the perfect soup for a cold evening. I didn't have as much milk so I substituted some home made cream of chicken I had and I think it gave it a very nice flavor. I also added a pinch of rosemary. Delicious!!

This soup recipe is awesome. But, I changed it a bit. I sauteed the onions in the butter, until transparent. Then made the rou and wisked in milk (little at a time) and stirred until thickened. I then cubed up about 3/4 cup of Velveeta Cheese and added that too milk mixture. Once cheese has melted into soup base, I then added my spices, bacon bits, and potatoes. When serving, I garnished with shredded cheese, bacon bits and green onion. Delicious!

Four stars on behalf of my husband, I would have given it three. This soup is good, not great. A little bland. It is VERY thick!

I used real bacon instead of bacon bits, and this was the best baked potato soup recipe! Everyone loved it!

I have never made a potato soup before an this one was super easy and very tasty.My picky 3 year old even loved it. I did however add about another cup of milk,onion and tomato to make it thinner and add more flavor.

This soup was so great, especially to be so easy! Great for left over baked potatoes, but it's even worth cooking the potatoes just for the soup!

Wow, this blew me away! I used real shredded bacon, 1% milk, and added some freshly minced garlic. It reminded me of the ham potato casserole my mom used to make when I was a kid :)

My sister-in-law gave me a recipe similar to this last year.  Her recipe omits the onion and only uses 4 potatoes.  Her recipe and this one are way too thick for us.  I followed the directions except added 1 cup of chicken stock hoping that would keep it thinned down some.  By the time it was almost finished, I used a half gallon of milk.  It makes more soup but that is fine with us!  We love it this way.  Also, only used 5 really large baking potatoes which was plenty.  If I had not used the entire half gallon of milk it would have been way too much potato.  This is the first time the soup has turned out perfect for us.  From now on, I will always use the entire half gallon of milk and 1 cup of chicken stock.  Totally forgot to put in the sour cream but we couldn't tell it lacked anything.

delicious. I took the advice of some other reviwers and reduced the roux for a soup that wasn't as thick. I will likely use the same technique for a creamy veggie soup too--omit the bacon and add a bunch of veggies--mmmm!

Definitely needed to add chicken broth to thin out the soup (otherwise we'd be 'slurping' mashed potatoes). That done, it was delicious! MADE AGAIN: I made half the recipe and this time, added a can of golden mushroom soup and 2 cans of water, instead of the last cup of milk.  I did not add any cheese or sour cream because it was already thick and didn't want it too rich.

Boiled the potatoes (chopped with skins)instead of putting them in the microwave.  I added extra butter and salt because I like more flavor :)

I have tried several potato soup recipes from this site and this has been the best so far.  I was a bit skeptical about microwaving the potatoes but it was great and super easy!  I used real bacon and fat free milk (b/c that's what we had).  This is a keeper!

This is a very good soup.  My family all loved it.  Like many of the others have previously stated, it is very thick...especially after it has been refrigerated overnight and reheated the next day.  I am going to cut the butter and flour in half the next time to see if this helps.  I think it should.

I love this soup. This is the second time I have made it. The first I followed the recipe exactly except using 2% milk as opposed to whole, so I am sure that is why it was not as rich as it was for others. This time I adjusted the "toppings" to my family's taste... double cheese, bacon, and onion!! I freeze half and get about 6 servings within the half. Its great to have on hand when you don't feel like cooking. The only thing I will say is that I added way more salt and some garlic powder. Do yourself a favor and make the full calorie version at least once!

This soup is wonderful but you really need to thin it out when heating it up after it's been refrigerated.  I thinned it with a little chicken stock and milk while heating it up.  It really sticks to your ribs!!

Soooo cozy and delicious. I used 2% milk to make it lower-fat, and also used just 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup flour. After cooking the potatoes in the microwave, I cut them into chunks and left the skin on because I love potato skins. I didn't have any green onion, so I put in some dried, chopped chives and dried, chopped onion. It was so good. It did end up a little too thick, though, so I added a little more milk at the end of cooking.

We love this recipe!  I microwaved potatoes and used 1% milk.  Followed the rest of the recipe as is and turned out great.  I froze half of the soup and will plan on thinning with milk or broth and adding a few more fresh baked potato chunks when we reheat.

Wow!  This was incredible!  At first when I had the butter, flour and milk I didn't think that it was going to be thick enough.  But then I added the sour cream and cheese and it came out amazing!  A+

This is by far the best recipe I have found for this.  After microwaving potatos and making the base in a saucepan I cubed the potatoes and through it all in the crockpot!! AMAZING recipe!  I will make this over and over and over!!! Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This soup was delicious.  The only thing I did different was to boil the potatoes, then mash them up a little. MMMM Good!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. My husband is not a soup fan but says this is the best soup he's ever tasted. He loves the chunks of potatoes and how thick it is. It gets really thick and with all roux--practically can cut it with a knife when it cools. Very tasty and I would recommend it.

I made this in a larger batch for our church youth group's progressive dinner at our house.  The teens, chaperones, and us all loved it.  Tastes like the delicious soup we get sometimes at restaurants.  Now I do admit, it was time consuming to scoop out all the potato mush, but it was worth it.  The teens liked passing around the toppings and adding what they wanted.  Oh, obviously I did not use the microwave, I prefer baking them.  Does anyone ever keep the potato skins on in the soup?  I wondered how that would taste.

WONDERFUL!! Although this recipe was a bit of a hassle on the stove, it tasted marvelous. Next time I'll slow cook it b/c it was just soooo much food! It is a little on the thick side which I love but if you wanna thin it out use a couple less potatoes and sub. c. broth for some of the milk! I loved it the way it is! The only things I changed: I baked my potatoes and I sauteed white onions with the bacon. And I added more spices....including some rosemary, parsley,and basil...not too much! The green onions definately give this some color! Thanks soooo much. This is now the only potato soup recipe I'll use! First and last!!!!!

I have made this several times and it is a family favorite.  After making once or twice, I started experimenting and know make the following changes: I use 1% milk instead of whole milk (sometimes substituting chicken stock for some of the milk)and cut the butter and flour for the roux in half.  It is still plenty thick and decadent enough with these calorie reducing changes.  I let each person top their own bowl tableside with bacon, green onions and cheese rather than adding directly to the soup.  Cubed ham is also a delicious addition.  Leftovers reheat well and if to0 thick, I thin with chicken stock.

Awesome and easy!  I used 2% milk and it was plenty rich.  Also did not have green onions, so minced some white onions and sauteed in butter at beginning of recipe.

Soooo good!  I used 2% milk because I am trying to race the expiration date on the gallon in my fridge. I think the soup was plenty rich.  Can't wait to make this on a cold winter night! Thank you!

This was very easy and very good. I scaled it down to 8 servings and added a little garlic to the butter. Microwaving the potatoes and using pre-cooked bacon cut down on prep time. I used 2 cups whole milk and 2 cups skim. I also added 2 cups of vegetable stock and it was still nice and thick.

What a wonderful recipe.  Like many others, I tried to cut the calories by using skim milk and lowfat cheese.  It was delicious! So I can hardly imagine how good it was using whole milk!  Thank you very much for this recipe.

I liked this recipe a lot. I've made it probably three times now and the only thing that I change is the amount of milk. I like mine not too thick and not too "runny" so I just gauge the milk as it is cooking and sometimes have to add more/less flour or more/less milk. Other than that, this is a hit.

I enjoyed the taste but agree with other reviewers that it's a bit thick. I cut the recipes in 1/2 and still had more than enough. I also added a bit more onion and bacon (real bacon, not bacon bits). Next time, I will try adding more milk to make it thinner.

This was good, but not very soupy.  More like a very thick chowder, and that's even after I added an extra 1/2 c. milk. I also think it was lacking onion flavor.  Adding additional onions to cook right in the soup would probably improve the flavor.

This is a great soup. I baked the potatoes instead of microwaving because I believe they have a better flavor. I also added a lot of chicken stock and used chopped yellow onions instead of green. I sauteed them in the butter just enough to soften them. This make a lot of soup, so you might try cutting the recipe in half. It filled my large crockpot to the brim.

Amazing! I did use Sharp Cheddar and about a 1/4 cup more milk, to thin it out a little. The second time I made it, I added some ham instead of bacon. This really is a great recipe. My family asks for it all the time! A keeper!

I did not care for this soup at all, but my family seemed to like it. I made enough for eight people. Therefore,I changed a few things: increased the flour and butter to a full 1/2 cup each,used 1 tsp (increased) of black pepper,used 8 potatoes instead of 6, used skim instead of whole milk & ended up adding 2 extra cups to thin the soup out a little, and finally at the end of the cooking I added some saute vegetables. For the vegetable saute, I cooked 1 minced carrot for 2 minutes in 1 Tbsp butter, then added 1/4 cup dried minced onion and 1 minced stalk of celery, then let them cook in the skillet until veggies are soft; remove from skillet and puree them in a food processor, then add to soup when adding sour cream. I doubt I'll be making this again.

This soup is great! I made a lower fat version by substituting light margarine for the butter (same amount), skim milk for the whole (same amount), 8 oz of fat free cheddar + 4 oz of 2% cheddar for the 10 oz of regular cheddar cheese cited in the recipe, and reduced fat sour cream instead of regular. My soup was still thick (but not too thick like some of the reviews said) and rich with less than half the fat and calories of the original recipe. It tastes great without completely throwing off my diet.

This recipe was ok but be prepared that it doesnt serve 6 it serves 18!  I had soo much left over I dont even know what to do with it.  The recipe is a good base but next time I will try it with less sour cream I think you only need about 2/3 of a cup and a little more butter.  Also I used 1% milk and it came out just fine so dont be scared =)

This was a tasty soup, but I had to add WAY more milk than the recipe calls for.  It would have been lumpy mashed potatoes if I went exactly by this recipe.  It was super good the next too.  I served this soup in french bread bowls.

Delicious!!! This is the perfect recipe for those cold winter Sunday afternoons!  I used the bacon dripping and added just a touch of butter to make the flour base....definitely not for you if you are on a diet....but great for those days when you need to cheat with a great comfort food!

Amazing dinner! I used 3 cups 1% milk and 3 cups whole milk. Also, I would DEFINATELY only use real bacon. This soup is so filling and it really warms your bones. It's a new favorite.

This soup really thickened up on me.  I may make it again but find a way to lessen the thickness.

Delicious!  This should be called "loaded baked potato soup".  It makes a huge amount, so I have some in the freezer for the next time it's really cold and I don't feel like cooking.

The taste of this soup was awesome...even my husband who isn't a soup lover like me said..."hey, this is really good." It was really thick, more like soupy mashed potatoes and I do think that I would add a little more milk next time I make it. I also sauteed an onion first before melting the butter since I didn't have green onions. I plan to give the rest of the soup to a friend since it made so much...I hope her family enjoys it as much as we did!

Great soup!  I forgot to buy sour cream so left it out and it was still terrific!  I think it needs a little extra salt than called for.  I used Hormel ready to use bacon bits.  So easy, fast and wonderful!

I baked the potatoes, takes longer but I like them better from the oven.  It was an excellent potatoe soup!  I also used heavy cream instead of sour cream based on personal preference (finace doesn't like sour cream)

Recently I've been using a lot less of potatoes than the recipe calls for and it comes out great.  When I make just two servings for myself I use just half a baked potato and after the bacon sour cream, it's plenty thick.  Just how I like it.

I had a little trouble with this recipe.  The baked mashed potatoes were a big clump and I was having trouble breaking them up in the pot with a whisk when I added it to the butter, flour, milk mixture, so I used my immersion blender to puree the soup.  It got really, really thick.  Too thick really for soup, and we like thick creamy soups.  I also added a small block of cubed Velveeta to the soup when I added the sour cream to make it cheesier.  I think next time I'll skip the flour.  I think the pureed potatoes will thicken the soup just fine.  VERY rich and VERY filling!  I baked the leftovers in a casserole dish, topped with shredded cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon and green onions and served as a side dish the next night.  Awesome as a casserole!  Tasted just like twice baked potatoes with out the skins.  My 14 year old gave it two thumbs up.

This is just an AWESOME soup!!! Instead of the bacon bits, I fried up some real bacon and chopped it up. I also added 2 T. chicken soup base to it and it was out of this world! It has the perfect consistancy. Definate make again!!

I love this soup recipe and so does everyone in my family.  I have made it several times and have found that you can easily lighten it up- using skim milk, reduced fat cheese and sour cream- and it still tastes fantastic.  I have also needed to use chicken stock to thin it out, but it adds a great flavor to the soup.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum I love this! I used real bacon and put it in while the soup cooks so the bacon flavor really infuses into the soup. Great with crusty  bread!

This came out like chunky mashed potatoes.  I had to really add a lot to make it good.  I doubled the cheese and bacon.  It still didn't have much flavor so I added 1/2 cup of ranch dressing.  This made the flavor perfect, but the consistency still wasn't a "soup", so I had to add *a lot* of milk.

It's a good base recipe, but does need some fixing up.

First of all, I cringed when I read bacon bits in this recipe.  Change it to real bacon (and more of it!) and this recipe is a HUGE hit!  I do bake my potatoes instead of microwaving them, but I suppose that would work if necessary.  I also added more cheese than called for (I always do!).  This was creamy, rich, and comforting.

My husband, a potato soup connoisseur, absolutely loved this soup and compared it to his favorite restaurant soup.  My daughter and I thought it was a little bland, next time I'll "spice" it up but the consistency was perfect!  Overall, LOVED IT.

This was really rich and creamy; great comfort food.  I subbed 2 % milk no problem, and used real bacon.  Next time, I'd add all the bacon and chives as garnish, if I wasn't going to finish this the first day, as they aren't as nice the next day (both get soggy).

i gave this soup 4 stars the first time around....it came out too thick to really be called soup. it was more like very mashed potatoes! but the next time around i added an extra cup of milk to thin it out, and it was a very good consistency. cut the potatoes lengthwise and use them for potato skins after you scoop out the insides! mmmm.

This is by far the best baked potato soup I have ever had.  I left out the bacon bits and baked the potatos in the over rather than microwave, but other than that I followed the recipe as stated.  Again - Excellent!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I did not even eat soup before this recipe. And this is the only soup I eat! However I like to use Red Potatoes becuase they have a richer flavor and I use the microwave bacon too. It is really good with garlic or cheesy toast or bread.

This recipe tastes like stuffed potatoes in a soup, my family really enjoys it. Also, I bake the potatoes rather than microwave, they taste better.

This was pretty good.  Didn't have quite the taste I was looking for.  I found it was better the next day when I added chicken broth to it to thin it out.  It was quite thick after being in the fridge all night, like mashed potatoes.  Adding the chicken broth really enhanced the flavor.

Very good, very thick, best if you use good, thick bacon.  I grated the hot potatoes and some of the skin was included for more texture.

This is very good. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, which I regret, so I will do so next time. I added too much flour, so the soup was too thick. It turned out to be like really runny mashed potatoes. But that was my fault, not the recipe. I added broccoli and carrots to this soup, to make it more nutritious. I will definitely make this again. I will caution you, however, about the servings. The recipe as written serves 12 people. That's a lot of soup! I converted mine to a 6 serving recipe and it was still a lot.

This soup was delicious!!!  The changes I made were only to make it healthier but not tastier...I used 1% milk and it still came out nice and thick and I also used diced ham instead of bacon.
Yummy!!

I am really sad to give this 3 stars, esp after reading all the reviews, but it was just missing something.  I added 2 garlic cloves and more cheese, and it still wasn't I was hoping.  BEWARE: the prep time is extremely long..if you microwave the potatoes in 3's it will take almost 45 minutes of micro time.  Not a fast recipe.

Was delicious.  A little thick, so I'm still changing it each time I make it.  I used less flour and boiled the potatoes.  This needs very little flour with all the starch from the potatoes.  Everyone loved it.

This soup was excellent and so easy to make!  I did make a few changes: added garlic powder and used shallots instead of green onions (it's what I had).  When I told my husband I was making this, he was a little nervous but after he tried it, he couldn't stop raving about it!  Will definitely make again and again!

Very good, but I scaled it for 1 serving and used a little less than 1 potato. I'll try the whole crockpot next time. Definitely take the time to use real bacon, chopped into bits... it makes a big difference. A very easy soup!

This is a Great recipe. I substituted real bacon and used the grease to make the roux. This packed in a whole lot more flavor. I also sauted a few of the onions with the bacon. Overall, I think the kids will absolutely love this soup.

So very perfect on a cold day!! I used real bacon bits from a baggie instead of the fake-n bacon bits. The sour cream really throws this recipe onto a whole other level!! So yummy!!

This is a good base,although quite bland. I added cornstarch as my soup wasn't thick enough.  I also used 5 green onions in the soup and more for serving on top.  I used 8 oz s cheddar in the soup.  I put an entire 16 oz container of sour cream in the soup and 1 teaspoon of salt.  This soup freezes well.

This soup is delicious!  The only change I made was to boil peeled potatoes instead of cooking them in the microwave.  I was just careful not to over-boil them so they were not too soft.

There is a local restaurant that has potato soup everyone raves about.  Now, I do, too!!  I added some heavy cream because I used skim milk and added some extra salt/pepper and some butter.  WOW, this was good!

Not bad - but be sure not to use too much potato.  I used the correct number, but they were large potatoes so my soup was too thick. There was something missing in the flavor, but I don't know what.

I felt extremely guilty serving this fattening soup to my boyfriend, but i must say, AWESOME!  The texture was perfect. I used sharp cheddar, i got the ocar mayer bacon bits, and added chicke nbroth at the end to thin it out. after everything was in the pot in was done very quickly. Also, i do not feel you really "need" the sour cream.  i put 1/2 of what they said to put in, but i really didnt make a diff. reheated nicely with teh addition of soem chicken broth. Will make again for a nice winter dinner with salad or a nice steak.

This was delish. I even kept out the sour cream (husband doesn't like) and let the kids add it in seprately. I love Potato skins so this was perfect for me. One thing...keep this for a winter night. Something just wasn't right, eating it on a summer night, but I had lots of potatoes to use up.

This soup was great!  I had to add a little milk in because it was so thick, but everyone loved it!

This recipe is wonderful.  We had it on a very cold winter day, and it really hit the spot!  I used real bacon though, rather than the bacon bits that it called for.

What a nice addition to any recipe box.  Nice soup on a cold evening and a change from the ordinary beef stew and vegetable soup.  Thanks for the recipe.

I loved the taste but I think that I did something wrong because it ended up
being like mashed potatoes.  I think I have to cook the potatoes for a lesser amount of time next time I make it.

Hubby said this best soup I've ever made.  Super simple.  Send to several friends so hope they enjoy as much as we did.  I cut recipe down to 6 servings and will make again for our cold winter months.

This is a great recipe. I only used 6 rather large potatoes and left out the sour cream. I added 1/2 a can of chicken broth at the end to thin the soup out and add a little extra flavor. This is the first time I have made my own potato soup and it turned out so well I know I will be making it a lot this winter! Thanks for the recipe.

I can't believe I made this!  It was very good.  too think for a summer dish though. I added onions and a little whit wine because it was a tad bit too starchy for me. Other than this, very easy to make and very tasty!
