I made this for my club meeting and there wasn't a crumb left.  BUT I made it in a 13x9x2" baking pan and baked it for 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  When the cake was thoroly cooled, I topped it with 2/3rds of the Cool-whip mixture.  I used the balance of the topping for dipping fresh strawberried, slices of apples, nectarines and peaches...yummy!!  Many thanks for sharing this great recipe with us!!

Very easy recipe.  I made this toddler-friendly by substituting the oil for pureed carrots (leftover homemade baby food) and used pineapple juice instead of water.  I omitted the nuts, and halved the frosting recipe (also added a touch of cinnamon)- worked great for 30 cupcakes.

I made a carrot today for my sisters b-day dinner tonight (carrot cake is her favorite) I used this as a guide somewhat as it was the only recipe I could find made with a box mix, I used a store bought carrot cake mix,substituted some of the pineapple juice for some of the water in the cake recipe,added shredded coconut and used walnuts instead of pecans, & less shredded carrots, my cream cheese frosting was butter, cream cheese, confectioners sugar & vanilla, then I decorated it with fine ground walnuts & "carrots" made from frosting that i dyed orange & green  used a baggie with a corner snipped. It looks pretty & I am sure it will taste just as good as it looks!(see photo) I'm giving a 5 star rating to myself!

You couldn't make a tastier carrot cake and it's SO simple! I only had half the pecan pieces called for and divided them between the batter and topping the cake. It looked pretty and we didn't miss the other half a cup at all. I also skipped the whipped topping and the icing was scruptious. I baked two 8" rounds for about 30 minutes. Forgot to mention that I used the pineapple juice as part of the water called for in the cake mix.

This was incredible!! I made it for my 3 year old sons birthday party, and it was incredible how many compliments I got. I also got a lot of "make me one of these cakes please!". So hands down way better than store bought!

Great, quick carrot cake!   I added some raisins and a handlful of shredded coconut.  I also opted for the traditional cream cheese frosting because many have said that is what makes carrot cake.  You cannot tell this was not made from scratch.  I have cupcakes out of this too and piped the frosting and they were pretty as well as delish.
