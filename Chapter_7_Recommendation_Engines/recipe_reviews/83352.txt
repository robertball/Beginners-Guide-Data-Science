just to add that mustard being crushed in the bowl like that will be bitter always.originally people in bengal use a special grinder of a stone make to grind mustard to make mustard fish(bhappa ilish). add cumin powder also pls.just try grinding 3 tbs mustard with some  2 tbs peanuts and1/2 tbs(adjust salt later in the gravy)  salt in a mixer,(can increase the content to help rotate the grinder,refigerate the leftover and use for a gravy paste to another one)it will not match the original taste but it will be not bitter,and who are allergic to peanuts they can use cashews instead.another method my mother-in-law do is ,she make dry  mustard powder in bulk in a grinder about 7-8 tbs of mustard.(or enough to make rotate the grinder) and when the fish is done(steamed fish) add mustard powder+green chily paste+cumin powder+turmeric powder+bit of salt+red pepper powder+oil+water to make a smooth paste add at the end and cook for 5 mints .

Being experienced in indian cooking, I was intrigued by the ingredients and simpliciy of this recipe. It was bland and very bitter from crushing up the mustard seeds. I never heard of crushing up mustard seeds for anything in cooking, only in making prepared mustards. We ate it so I gave it a 2. But then again, we were really hungry. I washed off the fish pieces the next day and gave it to my dogs, they liked it.

As a rule I do not like fish, but I thought this recipe was very good. The textures and the flavors complimented the fish nicely and I have recomended it to my mother to try.

I was just going to experiment and try this recipe out so I only used one salmon fillet so obviously I reduced all the other ingredients. And I didn't have any green chile peppers so I used about a tablespoon crushed red peppers in it's place. and 1 tablespoon mustard powder. That time it tasted WONDERFUL. So I decided to make more and used the 3 tablespoons of mustard powder and I see that's where the recipe goes wrong. It's too much mustard seeds they're saying to use and not only does it eclipse the other flavors, you can't even taste the salt when you add as much mustard seed as they tell you. So just add 1 tablespoon for the flavor (maybe less).

I used cod as mentioned in the notes and after reading the reviews I decided on mustard powder instead of the seeds. This turned out GREAT with no bitter taste whatsoever. I liked this much better than I anticipated. The fish ends up tender, rich, and none of the ingredients are too pungent at all. Not even the chile pepper. Great recipe and one I recommend with my one change.
