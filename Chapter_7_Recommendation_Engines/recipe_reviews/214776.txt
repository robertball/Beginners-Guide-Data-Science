The first time I made this, it turned out terribly. The cookies were a thick, chalky, doughy mess. The next time I had leftover pie crust (not from this recipe, actually a storebought roll-out kind since I was in a rush, eek!) I rolled out the leftovers, spread it with crisco, mixed some extra crisco, cinnamon and sugar together, and spread the paste onto the cookies, rolled, and sliced. I sliced them about 1/4" thick instead of 3/4", sprinkled a little extra cinnamon-sugar mixture on top and baked for 6 minutes at 425 degrees. They came out tiny and crispy and flaky with a caramelized bottom... absolutely irresistible and impossible to stop eating! Fantastic recipe, the main thing is SLICE VERY THIN BEFORE YOU BAKE!

I grew up with these! My mum made them every time she made pie, or anything that involved pie crust. They are a fantastic, tasty way to use up left over crust! We always called them "pinwheels". She used brown sugar instead of white and butter instead of the shortening inside.

I am french Canadian and I grew up with these tasty bites.  The secret is to brush the dough very lightly with either butter or water to make the sugar and cinnamon stick.  We have used brown sugar, white sugar and hot chocolate mix for different variations.  Yummmmm!

Childhood memories! My mom made these every time she made pie, which was often. I've made them as well since then, and I'm 65, so it's been many batches of "piggies" (which we called "thingies" - but I like "piggies" better). As time has gone on, I've jazzed them up by using a combination of white and brown sugar and I add chopped pecans or walnuts to the cinnamon-sugar mixture. I make an entire extra batch of pie crust dough just to make these. They are delicious - and very easy.

I used to make these when I was a teenager. I got the recipe from home ec class. We made these one day in class and they went over big time. I lost the recipe many, many years ago. Thanks for publishing this. Got my first boyfriend with a plate of these.

These cookies are simple and wonderful.  My toddler loves them and I love that they are easy to make and that because I am making them from scratch I know exactly what is in them.  Fantastic!

Love them, especially right out of the oven.  They are quick and easy to fix even late at night when you're craving something sweet.  I use unsalted butter instead of shortening and add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar to the dough. I use my Ninja to combine the flour and butter, works like a charm and is super quick and easy.

The cookies are amazing!  However, when I took the cookies off the pan I put them onto paper towel - they STUCK to the paper towel!  So, I will try them another time and let them cool longer on the pan before putting them on the paper towel.

My grandma would always make these for the kids she babysat when she made pies for people. I use to just call them pie cookies. I didn't roll my into swirls I just rolled it out like a pie crust then spread with shortening and cinnamon sugar and then I just break off the cookies when I want them.

I used to help grandma bake when I was a little guy just to be able to be first in line to get my "cinnamon bites" as grandma called them. Thanks for the memories and a recipe I've hunted for.

My granny was a professional baker and she called them cinnamon rolls. (Imagine my surprise as a child to see a real cinnamon roll, compared to what I knew.) 
We used butter instead of shortening. She also rolled them into small logs (about 3 inches) which I prefer over the thin version given in this recipe.
Very, very easy to make and well worth it.

Nice and easy to make.  The only thing that made me nuts (and I should have known better) was putting the slices on paper towels to cool, like the directions said...made them all stick to the paper towels.  A nightmare!

These were ok - great if you have nothing else on hand, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make them. It was a neat idea, thanks for sharing!

My Mom always made these type of cookies for us after she made a pie. The only thing that she did different was to spread the dough with butter and jam then sprinkle with the sugar and cinnamon. Yum..... They were the best!

My Grandmother made these, too.  They were called cimmitty-coo (when my Dad was little, he couldn't say cinnamon cookies).  They're wonderful. Thanks so much for the damp smile!  Off to the kitchen with me...

An easy way to get rid of scrap dough. These weren't as sweet as I was expecting them to be, but they were still delicious. I will definitely be making these again!

My mom used to make these with leftover pie crust.  I think the trick is to roll the dough thin and slice them about 1/2 inch thick.  Delicious childhood memories!

I had forgotten about these cinnamon cookies until I saw this recipe.  My grandmother used to make these for me when I was a little girl from scrapes of pie crust and biscuit dough.  I will make some tomorrow.

They were good but mine didn't look like the picture. I cheated and used frozen pie crust. I guess I did something wrong because mine came out the size of half dollars!! Cute and tasty. My husband loved them.

I haven't tried this version, but my mom made a similar dessert for us when we were kids. But she rubbed it with butter or margarine  and then sprinkled it with a cinnamon sugar mixture.  Also, I only make pie crusts with Butter flavored Crisco. It makes a much flakier crust.

These cookies were easy to make and a great use of shortening lying around! These cookies are great with a napkin and a toothpick and are the cutest cookies ever! Suggestion: Try these with a thin, brown sugar glaze!
Tip: Bake these for the same amount of time, but check every minute or so as these can burn quickly!
Enjoy!

I was craving something sweet and had scant ingredients in the kitchen so I went on the hunt for a recipe for something I had ingredients for. I ran across this one and wow was I excited! I went straight to the kitchen and made these amazing little cookies. I used margarine in place of shortening since it was all I had, but they came out like a dream. I also added brown sugar to the filling and cooled them on wax paper rather than paper towels. I was afraid the paper towels would stick. I will definitely make these again!!

Just finished making these & we are half way thru eating them already!  I'd like to think that means the recipe didn't make a lot but truthfully it made about 2 dozen slices. They're just That delicious. Will make again, and again!

I really had high hopes for these, as both me and my husband love a good homemade pie crust. - I soon learned that even the best homemade pie crust though just doesn't amount to the tastiest cookie, in my opinion. Maybe I didn't add enough cinnamon or sugar or something, but they were dry and bland!
