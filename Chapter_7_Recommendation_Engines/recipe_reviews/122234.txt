Just reading through the recipe I knew I was going to love this – what a sandwich!  I cooked the chicken breasts in a skillet grill pan and instead of French bread used the ciabatta rolls I had on hand. Since I am fortunate to have it in my garden now, I used fresh dill rather than dried.  (If you really wanted to go decadent, I could see this chicken breaded in Japanese Panko bread crumbs and fried).  You just couldn’t ask for a more appealing and tantalizing combination of flavors, colors and textures. Hubs was not enthused about a sandwich with cream cheese spread but he was perfectly happy to eat his without, so it is still easy enough to serve this sandwich for lunch or supper and please everyone. This is a “gourmet” type sandwich you’d expect to find on the lunch menu at nicer restaurants.  Save yourself the $12-15 you’d pay for it there and make it at home!

I did the chicken on the grill, so I seasoned it with dill, garlic powder and onion powder before grilling.  I doubled the cream cheese spread which was very good.  These made great chicken sandwiches - perfect for a quick meal.

I was looking for something to cure winter food blahs and this did the trick and then some! It was wonderful! The whole family loved it and declared that it was better than any fast food chicken sandwich they had ever tried. A keeper for sure! Five stars doesn't even begin to cover how good it was. We have two in our family who aren't fond of cream cheese so instead of serving the sandwiches already done up I spread everything out buffet style and let everyone do their own. One of my crew chose to use mayo instead of the spread and said it tasted just fine. The cream cheese is what makes it, though! No complaints from this cook! Thank you for such a great contribution! :)Update: This also works great to cook and put in the fridge to use for a cold chicken sandwich in a lunchbox! Just put the breast in a container, wrap up an untoasted bun, send along some lettuce and tomato in a baggie, and a small jar of the sauce (or mayo) and taa-da LUNCH! :)

These were really good. We loved them and thought they were a nice change from just a normal chicken sandwich.

These are simple to make and soooo tasty.  I made too much of the cream cheese mixture and ate it the next morning on a bagel and that was amazing too!

You can not go wrong with this recipe.  Be careful with the garlic and don't cook it on high heat.  Like cream cheese and chicken with a little lemon and dill could taste bad.  Delicious and easy to do.  The only difference was that I had soft deli sandwich bread instead of french bread...still delicious.  Thanks for the post.

I was looking for a quick recipe for chicken sandwiches and found this recipe. It was absolutely delicious. Used chicken tenders and hoagie rolls I had saved in the freezer, but besides that followed the recipe exactly. My husband was in love! He had two and wished he had more. I'm pretty sure we'll be making this many times to come!

This chicken sandwich is the best one I've had, ever!  I followed the recipe, don't need to change a thing ingredient wise. To solve the burning garlic problem, just make sure not to cook over to high heat.  My garlic was perfect, but I only cooked on med. heat, even though it seemed my chicken took forever.  Be sure to pound flat your chicken, (to about 1/2 inch) so as to quicken cooking time, and also I discovered if you cover your pan while cooking chicken it seems to help speed it up. We will be having these regularly!

Easy and quick, although the spread was a bit strong for us.  Maybe decrease on the dill a little.

Such a delightful sandwich in the middle of winter.. I used quite a bit of fresh dill (we love dill!), and added more lemon juice than the recipe called for.  I also used wheat bread instead of french. The cream cheese spread is really delicious and adds something special to this chicken sandwich. I'll be making this one again.

I made these sandwiches for dinner last night and they were wonderful.

I used fresh dill - about 1 tbsp split between the spread and the pan.  I also added some minced garlic to the spread.  

I took one reviewers advice and cut the chicken breast in half to decrease the thickness instead of pounding.  I decreased the oil/butter in the pan by about half and cooked with the lid on.  I cooked for 3 minutes on each side and then removed, wrapped in foil and let sit for 10 minutes, perfect and flavorful.

I will be making these again.

I didn't have regular cream cheese so substituted cream cheese with chives. It was very good but next time I'd like to try regular cream cheese.

I have been making this recipe ever since I first saw it in Taste of Home years ago. It's always a big hit! I found that to make it easier for large crowds, that I just get a loaf of garlic bread, bake it as directed and then assemble the sandwich on that. Just cut it into single servings. I always double the cream cheese mixture as well.

So easy and so good!!!! I only used 3 chicken breasts, but kept all the other quantities the same. Served on ciabatta rolls that I sprayed with cooking spray and put under the broiler for 3 minutes. The amount of cream cheese was perfect (I used 4 oz) with the recommended lemon juice and dill. So refreshing and summery! I did not serve with lettuce or tomato because I didn't have any on hand and it was good without, but would be good with them too.

My family and I thought this was pretty good but not "too die for". I might make this again and serve on grilled rosemary foccacia instead of french bread. The chicken could also use a sprinkle of salt and pepper while cook.

I really liked this.  Very easy as a "What should I make for dinner tonight?" idea.  I'd suggest not cooking the garlic first, mine burnt before the chicken was done.  For the chicken I took chicken breasts and cut them in half horizontally and pounded just a little to make cutlets, plus then you only need 2 chicken breasts for this recipe.  I am putting this recipe in my keeper list!

Extremely easy to and absolutely delicious, add salt and pepper though, and use thin chicken cutlets to avoid the unnecessary pounding.

My family loves these sandwiches. I made them for company once and they still talk about it. It is true - it is the cream cheese that makes them. I actually buy fresh lemons instead of using bottled lemon juice and it makes a huge difference in taste. I love making the cream cheese very lemony, gives it wonderful flavour!

These were good.  I used fresh dill, which turned out to make the chicken beautiful as well as having a fresher, more citrine taste. I like dill alot, though.  My family, on the other hand, didn't care for this recipe, so I was forced to vow I would not make it for a family dinner again. I will, however, make the chicken at least for myself for lunches or to add to pasta salads.  I love the flavor combination of garlic and dill.

These were very good;the sauce is great.  My husband didn't like the bread being kind of greasy, but liked them enough otherwise to overlook that!

Very easy and very good.  I cooked the chicken to make clean easy (or non-existent!)  The creamy lemon-dill sauce is to die for!

Fantastic and fast. I used fancy thin sliced chicken  and put between slices of toasted french bread (from this site). Family loved it! Thanks.
