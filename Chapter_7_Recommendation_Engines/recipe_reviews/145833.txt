I thought this was tasty. No lime vodka, just plain Absolute so I added a squeeze of fresh lime juice. I also used diet Citrus Drop soda as that was all I had. Took the edge off my long day, that's for sure. I liked the tartness that the fresh lime gave it.

Maybe if I had used a different brand of lemonade or tried pink lemonade as "roseannking" did, it might have been better.  Just didn't like it.

WHERE DID YOU FIND LIME VODKA? JACQUIN's stopped making it and now makes Citrus Vodka in it's place. It' awful. I loved the Lime Vodka and would buy it from any Brand name.
