This wasn't too bad. I really like the corned beef, but the vegetables, especially the carrots and potatoes, had a really overpowering and bitter beer taste. I made the recipe exactly as written, except for cutting back on the garlic and onion powders per the other reviewer's recommendation (I used 1.5 tbsp of each).  I'd say that 2 tbsp of each is probably sufficient.  This recipe could also benefit from using more vegetables, as 1/2 lb of baby carrots and potatoes isn't very much. I'd recommend using only half the beer and sprinkling some of the spice packet into the liquid, not just on top of the beef.  The meat was really tender though, and Im looking forward to eating it in a sandwich for lunch tomorrow.

I did not change anything, but should have....the amt of onion and garlic powders are way too much.

i was worried about the bitterness as per the other reviewer, so i treated it with some lemon juice and a bit of sugar. i may have added it in a bit too late in the process to avoid bitter vegetables but it seemed evened out the flavor pretty well.
