I thought my review could use updating after using this recipe for 10 years...  This is most flavorful, beautiful challah recipe I've ever used.  My only change is to slightly increase the salt: I use 2 heaping teaspoons.  The dough doesn't always appear to have risen sufficiently, even given extra time, but by the time it's out of the over, it looks and tastes perfect.  Thank you, Rivka!

This is hands-down the best bread I've ever made.  Everyone goes crazy over it!  The texture is dense and doughy, and the honey makes it super-sweet. I top mine with sesame seeds--simply sprinkle them on after brushing with the egg.

The bread didn't rise the first time so I just kneaded it again and it worked.  So good and easy that I am making it with my Preschool class next week.

The bread was pretty good although my mistake was letting it cook too long. The recipe said to bake for 35-40 minutes and after 25 minutes in my oven it was very well done. Maybe it was my oven? The flavour is very good, although as it is quite rich I would probably only make it once or twice a year.

I made this for Thanksgiving...it was perfect!  Made a very large loaf!  The dough is a little sweet and very moist and delicious.  Tastes excellent slightly warmed with butter on top.  I'll definitely use this again.

This challah turns out kind of dry, IMHO. Its texture is in between the Number 1 Hawaiian Egg Bread (which is lighter and more feathery) and the wonderful Challah I (which is more dense and moist). This bread certainly looks beautiful when it's done, and don't get me wrong, it tastes fine. However, I'll stick to Challah I.

i didn't really like the strong honey flavor too much, but my sister loved it.  also, a bit sweeter than the typical challah.  the loaf was huge, and a bit underdone in the middle (maybe my oven's too hot?) so i think next time i'll try two smaller loaves.

Absolutely, unequivocably the best Challah I have ever made. If you follow the directions, you'll make a perfect loaf, with the possible exception of the baking time and temperature. I depart a bit from the prescribed method.  First, Challah dough (if it's the real thing)does not like to rise quickly. I like to make the dough in the evening, throw it into a small plastic garbage bag, which has been sprayed inside with Pam-spray, then leave in the refrigerator overnight. Next morning, punch down & let it rise till double. You may have to wait up to three  hours for this, but be patient with it! When you punch it down the second time, give it some time to rest before you go jerking it around again. This dough is not one to be hurried! When it's had time to relax, go ahead and braid it, and then let it rise again--at its own pace, please! You go throwing dough into a slightly heated oven, or out in the sunlight, and you're going to get sour bread that tastes more like a keg of beer than sweet bread. 350 oven? What's with that? I bake mine at 315 (convection oven) and it comes out completely done on the inside, and with a beautiful golden crust on top AND bottom. Oh, about the braiding thing. I am not Jewish, but I do keep the Sabbath. Traditional Challah calls for six "ropes" to represent the six days, and one "rope" to place on top of them to represent the Sabbath day. To do this, divide  your dough into 7 pieces, rolling each into a rope about 3/4 inch in diameter. With the fi

Wow, yum!  My challah came out of the oven so beautiful.  It did not rise too dramatically before baking, but more than doubled in size as it baked.  The bread came out beautifully yellow and golden brown, and I could not believe I had made such a gorgeous bread.  It tastes wonderful too -- light enough to make sandwiches out of, and sweet and hard to stop eating. Warning -- this makes alot.  I halved the recipe and it made a LARGE loaf!

thia recipe is very good, what i did change though was the baking times due to the fact that i use my pampered chef stone to bake on. to start baking i baked it for 40 minutes @ 270degrees, then i reduced it down to 350degrees for  20minutes, and that seemed to cook the inside perfect and still gave it the golden brown on the outside that we all love! Shabbat Shalom everyone!

absolutely loved this bread! my mother used to make something similar in my youth, and this for sure takes me back. As others stated, you do sometimes have to wait a VERY long time for the dough to rise each time. Mine took 3hrs the first time, by then it was so late, i just braided it and put it in the fridge with the wet towel on top overnite, by morning it had risen and i then finished the recipe. Very good flavor and excellent consistency. The honey added a very nice touch, i will definitely make this again!

I thought this challah would be a little sweeter because of the 2/3 cup of honey, but it still had a nice, subtle sweetness.  It made a good size loaf that had great texture. The dough does need the two teaspoons of salt for optimum flavor.  I didn’t bother to use an egg wash because I had made this bread to use for French toast.

Followed the recipe exactly as is for my first time - the taste is perfect - not too sweet, but sweet & delicious enough to eat it plain without any spreads/toppings.  The various reviews on cooking times depend on the thickness of your loaf.  Mine was a little thick and although I cooked it until it was brown and lightly crusted on top (just like Rivka's photo), it was a little doughy in the middle. For my second try, I rolled the braids a little thinner to make a thinner loaf, and it was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! One note--As other commenters have said, the baking time may vary--the bottom of my loaf got pretty dark before it had baked even the minimum 30 minutes, so be sure to keep an eye on it.

The Challah is dleicious. However, I would like to share with my fellow amateur bread bakers that the water in which you dissolve the yeast (instant or not) should be no warmer than luke warm. If the water is too hot, it will kill the yeast and your dough wont rise. This can be disheartening.
It is also possible that this recipe should call for 2 packets of yeast. Eventhough others have reviewed that one worked fine. I have just made  another loaf and it will not rise. Just like the first. But, when I add a second, it does rise. So the question is: Have I killed the yeast twice or should the recipe call for two .25 ounce packets?

This recipe is wonderful!! I did change it up a bit though. I don't use alot of white flour, white sugar, etc., and sometimes have a difficult time with converting of recipes and having them turn out nicely but not this one! Perfect! With this recipe I used whole wheat pastry flour along with Agave syrup for the honey. I baked it at 325 for about 40 to 50 minutes. Turned out beautifully. Slightly crunchy outside (and a picture perfect loaf of braided bread too, wish I'd taken a picture)with a deliciously sweet dense middle. I will probably go a bit lighter on the Agave next time as it was just a tad too sweet for my tastes.

My first ever successful bread!(apart from cinammon rolls)My yeast didn't get big and bubbly after combining with water, just murky with little poofs. I was a bit skeptical at first because after 1 hour left near the window (it was a hot and humid afternoon), the dough did not seem to rise much, but i continued anyway. The dough was very elastic. I cut the dough into two and subsequently, into thirds and had 2 beautiful braids. Instead of egg white wash, I beat 1 egg and generously brushed it all round. I used manuka honey and it did not come out sweet for me, it's PERFECT! Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't know what I did wrong, but the bread never rose.  I saw that someone else had the same problem and tried re-kneading it, it still didn't rise.  Well it was my daughter who was helping so we went ahead and put it in the oven where it did indeed rise.  (It tasted awful though.)  The dough was also extremely sticky, I've made challah before and it's never been like that before.  I probably won't try it again, all around a big disappointment.

Pretty good.  A little dry...but I liked the honey flavor, which seems to be a little sweeter than the average challa.  Thanks for the recipe.

This bread is great- I love the honey flavor.  I made this in my Kitchenaid, and it didn't rise at all the first rise.  I read another reviewer had the same problem, so I did what she did and just kneaded it again (by hand this time).  Then, after an hour it still hadn't risen, but after 2 hours, it had.  I guess this dough is just so dense it needs longer to rise.  I used 2 cups of white whole wheat flour so maybe that had something to do with it.  Anyway, this bread is great to eat plain, or make into french toast, or to toast and eat with butter!

Delicious bread! I didn't have any honey one of the times that I made this...mixed light brown sugar and water to the consistency of honey and used the same amount that the recipe called for. Turned out nicely. Also, you can use this recipe for delicious dinner rolls.

This recipe is excellent!  The challah comes out a lot sweeter than normal shabbat challah, but it is a nice change.  I added chocolate chips to a recent batch...it was practically dessert!

I followed the instructions to a T but even with baking an extra 8 minutes my bread appeared finished but was not.  About a 1" wide section along the entire length of the loaf about 1 1/2" below the  top was still very raw!

It didn’t rise as much as I thought, but it came out of the oven and looked great. And tasted like I think challah should.

The bread turned out beautifully, and the family really loved it.

I substituted virgin gmo free avocado oil in place of the canola oil, and added sesame seeds to the egg wash as well.  The recipe easily made two loaves so you can feed a dozen or more quite easily.  

Thank you for sharing the recipe!

It didn't rise and didn't cook all the way, so was doughy inside. It was sweet, but I like sweeter bread, so added honey on top before eating. It was moist and crisp on the outside. Next time I would make the roll smaller in width so it cooks all the way through.

I've made 6 batches of this bread recently at Bible School.  All turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!  p.s. I used corn syrup, cheaper than honey.  Saved the honey to eat with it.

This is a wonderful recipe - bread came out perfect, and didn't have to change a thing. The only substitution I made was to use safflower oil instead of canola and the Challah tastes wonderful. Thank you for this recipe - my first success using yeast!

I made this recipe this year for Christmas. It was AWESOME. Being more familiar with regular active dry yeast I used that instead and followed the recipe to a T. None of the guests found the bread too sweet, it was close in texture and taste to Hawaiian Style breads one would find in the store.

I used orange blossom honey and Moroccan Orange Blossom water.  I didnt know how to "deflate" bread so I stabbed with with a knife a few times.  I also didnt know how to braid 4 peices and did 3 peices, I skipped the egg whites ontop.  I think I made it to thick but used a small convection so the top got to brown b4 the bottom fully cooked but its sooo yummy and sweet I will be making it again! Recipe was great

This is a recipe that I make for New Year's Eve dinner. We share with friends, and family. People always asked what the ingredients were but like my mother, grandmother I could not tell them, because its a pinch of this , six handfuls of that and so on. this is the same recipe. Thank you.Tejani.
