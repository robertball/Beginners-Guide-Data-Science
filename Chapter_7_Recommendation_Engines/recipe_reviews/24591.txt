Excellent! Served this at a large party/picnic with veggies and bread for dipping, there wasn't a drop left. Great made the day before, gives flavors a chance to blend.

This is one of the best dips I have ever made!  I served it in a bread bowl with a side of green onions, celery and pita chips.  I used about 3 oz of gorgonzola and that was plenty.  Also, I used dried dill and cut the amount in half from the fresh.
I am making this again tonight!

This dip was great! It has two of my fave ingredients in the world: fresh dill and Gorgonzola! 
My friends and I couldn't stop eating it. I don't have a kitchen scale so I had to guess on the amount of the Gorgonzola. Also, I didn't use low-fat mayo and sour cream which is probably really bad for me, but it tasted awesome! The thick, creamy texture remained after storing it in the fridge. I will make this again.

This dip was thick and delicious when I made it but got runny after refrigerating it.  I was disappointed at first, but then realized what a fabulous salad dressing it made!  Everyone loved the flavor of this!

Super YUMMY, but maybe will use less Gorgonzola next time. Used the electric hand mixer, didn't have to clean food processor. :)

I made it the night before and followed the recipe exactly.  I took it out this morning and it's extremely runny, like water. It tastes good but I'm very disappointed. I am adding more gelatin to see if that will save it.

Not as "chunky" as I would have thought.  Maybe I just mixed it too much.  Next time, will mix by hand.  Great for the guests who liked Gorgonzola
