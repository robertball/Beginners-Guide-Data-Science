First time I made this, I waited 24 hours as it chilled and flavors melded in the fridge.  I ended up eating the whole pound of beans in one shot.

Three things that improve this, as far as I'm concerned:

1)  Instead of boiling or steaming the green beans, toss them with a little olive oil so they get thinly coated, and then roast them on an aluminum foil covered sheet pan at 450F for 14 minutes.  The beans taste better this way, plus the dressing sticks to them a bit better.

2)  Throw some red pepper flake and fresh ground black pepper in the dressing.  

3)  Unless you're having some bread on the side, you can cut the amount of the liquid in the dressing by about 20%.  Also, since you're not cooking the oil/vinegar, use extra-virgin olive oil.

Yum!  Both my husband and I love this recipe!  It's simple to prepare and tastes even better the longer you let it sit in the fridge.  The one thing we've changed is to only use half of the olive oil, since we love the taste of the vinegar with the garlic and shallots and that much oil isn't really needed.  This is perfect with Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken by Connie, also on this site, and oven roasted red potatoes.

A nice change of pace from ordinary green beans.  I find the recipe as written a little plain for my tastes, but it is a great base to add your favorite ingredients to.  I added sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese.

In addition to the beans, I added fresh asparagus spears cut to the same length of the beans.  I sprinkled salt, pepper, parsley and garlic powder into the vinegar and olive oil before pouring onto the salad.

I needed a side dish for the 4th of July supper. I did a quick search for a recipe. This was the one I found and it was truly awesome. Because I didn't do this in advance I did not get to let it sit as long as I will the next time. Great recipe, I strongly recommend it.

A nice change from plain green beans.  My husband ate these so that's saying something.  I never thought he'd eat these cold!  I used steam in bag green beans.  I used a little less olive oil and substituted red onion for the shallot.  I also added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  It marinated for 6 hours in the fridge.  It had just enough tang from the balsamic and the garlic taste was a bit much, but it was still good.

I tried this but I steamed the beans, and I didn't use 2 tablespoons of garlic. I thought that was a LOT. I still used too much though and my wife and had the taste in our mouths for a couple of days. Next time, I will not use any at all and see how this turns out. I'm sure we'll enjoy it. Overall, a decent side dish.

First time I boiled the green beans and they tasted watery.  Second time, I roasted as suggested by another reviewer.  I also used about 1/2 the garlic called for, and added red pepper flakes.  It was delicious!

I actually forgot to take these to the dinner we were going to on Sunday so I left them in the fridge and took them to a birthday party the following day.  They were actually better after sitting for close to 24 hours!  I was afraid they might turn mushy but not at all.  Will definitely make these again.  They are a great refreshing summer side dish!

This had WAY too much oil and vinegar.  I had to cook a 16 oz. bag of frozen lima beans and add it to this, otherwise there was too much sauce and it was too bitter.  Adter adding the lima beans it tasted great.  I will make this again, but will double the green beans.

Good, not great. I think the amount of garlic was a bit much and I'm usually a big fan. The garlic and shallot need to be very finely minced. The final product is much improved by letting it sit in the fridge for several hours.

I made this recipe for myself, my husband and two guests.  I was excited about the recipe because I usually love bean salad.  This was just really bad. No one ate it, including me.  I do not know what it was about the dish that did not work, but it was just not appealing to any of us (none are picky eaters)?

I really liked this recipe as did others who tried it. If you are not a big fan of vinegar however you might want to back off of it just a little.  The best compliment came when my mother and sister wanted to take some home!

No excuses not to get your veggies. This is so easy and it is VERY good. I had to substitute red onion for shallots. Didn't want to run to the store.

i found Yngvai Malmsteve's review very useful for starting points.  though i think 14 minutes baking time was too much, i think 10 will leave the beans more crisp and less wilted.  

i also left my marinade separate and refrigerated it for 24 hrs to meld all the flavors.  i added sun-dried tomatoes, feta cheese and pine nuts.  

was good, but must eat right then as it doesn't save well.

This was good and very simple. I used half raw garlic and half roasted garlic (I had some left from another recipe), and it gave the salad a wonderful flavor that wasn't overpowering. I lightly blanched the beans and served them over romaine. I actually liked it better over the lettuce than just the beans by themselves; it gave a nice variation to the texture.

I haven't seen any mention of boiled white potatoes to this dish. I do, and the outcome is wonderful. The potatoes soak up the oil and the red wine vinegar along with the fresh green beans and it is amazing. Having it set over night is a must.

Wonderful combo of flavors. I was worried about the vinegar but everything melded so well. I let mine marinate for about 3 hours. Can't wait for the left overs tommorrow!

This recipe turned out very good. I took the advice of other reviewers and boiled the beans a little longer to make them a little more tender and added feta cheese. My picky husband thought it was "ok", but my parents who were joining us for dinner really liked it and my mom took the recipe home.

It was ok and nice of a marinade but definitely way too much marinade.  Cutting in 1/2 would be fine.  Added salt and let marinade for 7 hours.

Best side ever!  The sweet crunchiness of the green beans with the rich tang of the vinegar compliment every picnic.  This is my family's favorite Thanksgiving side.  I always have to make extras so people can have leftovers!

As written I give this recipe a 3, but I felt it needed more. So the next time I made it, I changed it. I am allergic to garlic so used more shallots instead. I roasted my green beans at 425 degrees for about 12 minutes. My beans had been resting atop a plastic baggie full of fresh dill, and they picked up that flavor, so I thought what they hey. I'll just add a couple of tablespoons of chopped dill to the recipe. I also took the suggestion of others and added some cheese to it. I used Swiss, since I had that on hand. I decided not to use as much oil and vinegar. I used about half. This dish was great. I'll make it again, but using my recipe instead. It brought the recipe up to a four or five. Even my husband who is not that fond of green beans liked this recipe.

Pretty good, but nothing special. Worth it to use slightly higher quality balsamic vinegar here, since it is one of the main flavors. I would add some red pepper flakes next time. Overall, a simple recipe that I wouldn't mind making again, but nothing to rave about.

I really didn't care for this too much. I have to totally agree wth another reviewer, you have to really like the balsamic flavor to really enjoy this dish. However, my mom devoured it, so it really is a good recipe for those who like the balsamic taste. I didn't have any shallots, so I sauted some diced red onion in sesame oil, then added  the vinegar to the onions. Also added some salt and white pepper, then poured it right over the hot beans.

I loved it, it definitely gets better the longer you give the flavors to meld.  I made this at thanksgiving, and my sister ended up eating an entire baguette just dipping it into the leftover sauce.   Just be careful not to over steam the beans.

I make with a cup of frozen green beans microwaved enough to thaw and warm a little.  Add the approximate amounts of vinegar, oil, onion, and garlic.  Then I sprinkle with a little sugar and parm cheese.  Then chill in before eating.

I agree with most. Less garlic is better. I LOVE garlic, but this was a little too much! I added feta cheese & sliced almonds. (pine nuts are EXPENSIVE-but I'm sure they would taste great too!) Still VERY YUMMY! Will make again.

This was too garlic-y for me, although I did like the balsamic vinegar on the beans.

Very good.  I served this salad with traditional lasagna and alfredo lasagna on Christmas.  My green beans were a little overcooked, so I am looking forward to making it again with crunchier green beans.  Thanks for the recipe.

Got rave reviews on this when I served it at a post Christmas buffet.  Like a previous poster, I tossed the green beans in olive oil and broiled them.  This really did make them tender and crunchy and infused with flavor.  Substituted red wine vinegar for balsamic as I was out and it was still great, but will try with balsamic next time.  Great dish to prepare ahead of time.

This salad was awesome!  I took it to a get together with people I had never met and I became the green bean chef!  Thanks for making me look good!  I added a handful of reduced fat feta cheese and decreased the amount of olive oil a little.  Tried it first with steaming the green beans and then roasting them and I'd give my vote to roasting!  Thanks!

This was a very good salad but I chose the wrong entree to pair it with. So I put to back in the fridge & we'll eat it for lunch.

I loved this. The people I made it for liked it, except my brother... but he doesn't like anything that involves vinegar. It was easy and full of flavor. The shallots make it great.
