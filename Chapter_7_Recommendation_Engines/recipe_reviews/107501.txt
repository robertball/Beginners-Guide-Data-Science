This soup is fantastic!  I used fresh ginger instead of dried, and included a couple of cloves of garlic.  I also added some red lentils to the sweet potato and carrots while it was cooking, and blended in some soft tofu to give it some protein at the end.  It's a hearty, healthy, feel-good meal and is forever included in my rotation.  Thanks!

pretty good. i also would decrease the cardamom a bit, otherwise great flavor and spice. i did add a bit more broth at the end, as it was pretty thick. Served it with grilled cheese the first night, and over brown rice for lunch the next day. flavors really developed overnight, and it made great leftovers.

Yummy!  This soup is so yummy and comforting!   I doubled the recipe, and put a little too much cayenne, so I added some cream cheese to cool it off.  Perfect!  Thank you!  The cardamom and the sweet potato go so well together.

I enjoyed this very much. The golden orange made a beautiful presentation. The sweetness from the onions, carrots, and sweet potatoes  made a mellow flavor profile, while the seasonings added just the right amount of exotic interest to make this soup memorable. Be aware, the red pepper flakes and cayenne do give it a little bite.

This was a really hearty and tasty recipe! I even used half a bag of frozen carrots to save time and didn't notice a difference in flavor. Also added four cups of stock instead of the water and skipped the red pepper flakes, so my version probably had a little more salt and a little less kick --- but it was still plenty spicy. Served it with plain yogurt to ease the burn.

This was very sweet, spicy and rich. Yum! I didn't have cardamom but used everything else. Plus I added 2 cloves of garlic and served it with garlicky homemade croutons on top. You should probably not serve this alone for the whole meal because like the other reviewer said, its a bit too rich to be your whole meal.

I modified this due to diet restrictions. Left out the butter.  However I fresh ground the cardamon and the cinnamon.  I also added Garlic which made up for the lack of the butter nicely.  I might add Butter Buds the next time and use a light vegetable broth instead.

It took the changes well and I don't think I lost the original recipe in doing so.  I highly recommend this one.

Loved it, with minor adjustment. I also needed to add about 2 more cups of stock (veg was nice) to keep it from resembling baby food. Tried leftovers the next day adding a little coconut milk. Not bad, but I like it without better. Delicious, try it.

This is a very tasty soup because of the spices.  It's a perfect soup for a cold Fall or Winter day.  The two little changes I will do next time is to add the hot spices at the end while blending so that you can test taste.  Mine was a little bit too hot.  I think I would also do a creamy version next time.

I like the taste of cardamom a lot, but I think it overpowers the rest of the flavours in this soup. The red pepper flakes add a very nice tingle.

First let me say I hate spicy things and anything to do with them. Next, let me say it was amazing! I tailored it for two servings [which made enough for three people in our house] added a little more of each spice, and ate mine with some homemade french bread. Oh, so good!

Great soup with lots of flavour.  I made a few changes out of necessity/preference: all homemade stock (no water) plus extra to make the soup thinner, ground cloves instead of cinnamon, no turmeric, about 1/4 tsp cumin seeds added, garlic added, and fresh ginger instead of ground.  I served it over rice like a sauce and it was delicious!

I substituted all the liquid called for, water and chicken stock for vegetable broth.  I also used approx. 1 and  1/2 boxes (32 ounces a box) of veggie broth. Excellent!

Great soup! I left out the cardamom because I didn't have it.  I also used another cup of chicken broth and I'm glad I did - it was nice a thick, but would have been too thick without the extra broth.

I love love love this soup.  It's become a go to for nights when I don't feel like cooking, or having a heavy meal.  The recipe itself is great because if you play around with spice addition it still always tastes good (so far anyway!).
In terms of modifications, I always use fresh ginger and add fresh garlic.

This was an excellent soup! I added a splash of cream at the end to add some texture and it was just brilliant! Quite spicy if you overdo the ginger and spices, but that's fine!

Making just a few changes to accommodate the vegetarian in my house and to tweak to our taste, this soup was easy to make and had a very nice balance of flavors. Changes: I used low sodium vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, increased cinnamon from 1/4 tsp to 1/2 tsp, added ~ 1/2 tsp each salt & fresh ground  pepper, and added ~ 2 tsp sugar. Easy and tasty, but makes WAY more than 4 servings.

It also does make a thicker soup, but the thickness fit the richness of the spices. The warm flavor was great for a chilly night and was soothing for the cold I had when I made it. Great recipe!

This is a lovely, warming soup. It is easy and quick to make. I am not a huge cardamom fan, but put in the full amount and I did not find it overpowering. I used fresh ginger and added a clove of garlic. Because my vegetable broth was low sodium I found I needed a bit more salt to bring out the flavors. It was nicely spicy. Adjust as needed for your particular ingredients and preferences - you will be pleased with this soup!

Excellent soup. Hearty, spicy (if you're a spice lover like me and increase the red pepper flakes, remember that spice is more intense in veggie soups!!) and amazing with goat cheese or sour cream. Highly recommended.

This soup is so delicious! I dont add the red pepper flakes and I double the amount of carrots and sweet potatos but keep the spice measurement the same. I have children and originally reduced the spice for them but I really like it this way. I normally eat very spicy food. I just think the reduction in spices to veggie ratio tastes better.

This soup was so totally awesome! It was like nothing I have ever tasted before but it satisfies every craving. Sweet, salty and spicy! I just added extra crushed red pepper to make it a little spicier. Thanks for this awesome find!

My husband and 4 boys said it was worthy of 'Master Chef' and kept asking for more!  I didn't have an onion but will add it next time.  What an easy want to feed a family. I did double the recipe as it only serves 4.  Served it with slices of bread, but would serve some nice multigrain rolls next time. Update: Added the onion this time and it was delicious.

I LOVED this. It is EXACTLY what I was craving! Mind you, I didn't really follow the recipe as far as proportions... I just used left over cooked sweet potato and cooked carrots from a holiday meal, but everything else I followed properly. : ) It was fantastic! I will DEFINitely be storing this recipe away for future use! The spices give a lovely Indian mood without being just like a curry soup. Highly recommend!

I served this as a first course to a fancy dinner party.  Everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of added more water/broth to improve the consistency.  Since I used cayenne, I served yogurt with fresh dill on the side.  I will make this again!

Great flavor :) my pinch of cayenne was a little to much,so I added heavy whipping cream.  The soup turned out great.Would make again with the heavy whipping cream.

I've never cooked with a lot of the listed spices so I'll admit that I'm not entirely sure what it is supposed to taste like, but I find this to be a pretty bland tasting soup considering the amount of spices used.  The aroma was very misleading.  I found that it had more aftertaste than anything and it was a very (almost too) spicy aftertaste for my liking.  I won't be making this one again I don't think.

This soup is crazy good!  I generally roast my root vegetables and then incorporate into recipe, you get awesome flavor that way.  I too cut down on the cardamom and used fresh ginger.

This recipe has a gorgeous color, comforting aroma and wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe exactly as written. While I loved this soup, I found myself starving after two bowls and filled up on bread to compensate. It's not substantial enough to be an entrée, but makes a great starter.

This soup was very good, though a little too spicy for my 9 year granddaughter.  Next time I will cut down on the spices a bit.

I made this for a quilters retreat at the lodge that I cook for and tripled the recipe to feed 30 guests. Even the non sweet potato fans loved it and the smell was wonderful. I omitted the chili flakes as I was warned that some of our guests didn't like "spicy" food, but the end result was still really good. I liked that you can play a little with ingredient amounts as vegetables are all different sizes as well. And it held in the soup tureen for 2 hours with no problems.

I only put this as 4/5 because I made some changes out of necessity cause I didn't have everything. I used half an onion, only one sweet potato, and I used curry instead of tumeric in the spices and it still turned out great! I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

I love this soup! I also have it on cool gray days when I want to be cozy. I am a fan of cardamom always so I wouldn't decrease the amount at all. Also added a bit of garlic and use fresh ginger if I have it on hand. Chicken stock does give it a little more roundness. Delicious!

In place of cinnamon and cardamon I used 3 tsp. garam masala which is a spice mix containing coriander cinnamon, cardamon, cumin, and black pepper. I also had to add a great deal of water to get a nice consistency and after eating a bowl I thought the flavors could be enhanced more with butter, salt wasn't enough. Sorry if you're watching your diet. With those adjustments I give it 4 stars. This recipe is a nice start.

Delicious! I did not have tumeric, so I put in a little Tandoori spice in addition to the other spices. I used fresh ginger, freshly ground cardamom seeds and a little black pepper. The only other change I made was to blend half of it and leave chunks for a hearty stew like consistency, and I doubled it for left overs.

This was a really good recipe!  I added a clove of garlic but I think it'd be better without it.  I substituted half of the butter for olive oil, added a pinch of brown sugar, and substituted coreander since I didn't have cardamom.  It's a bit spicier than I thought it would be, but a good balance.  I added some crushed pita chips on top when serving.

I marvel at people who rate a recipe and don't follow the directions, but I had so many sweet potatoes and carrots, and not all the rest of the ingredients. My immersion blender worked a treat and I only burned myself once. I ate this every day for a week and I'm ready to make it again. Because of course I have a great many sweet potatoes and carrots.

Whoa this is spicy for the kids. It was bland and hot for me. I give it 3 stars because it’s very healthy and my oldest son managed to finish it. Also a good use of sweet potato and sneaking turmeric in. I may/not use it again. It’s quick and simple but not exactly the yummiest soup in the world.

Made this as is, and found it to be very good. I don't like spicy foods, and it had just a little kick to it, though not bad. I don't care for sweet potatoes either, but I made this for my husband, and he loved it. 
Would make again.

This soup was good.  I microwaved the sweet potatoes about 5-10 minut4es before putting in the chicken broth.  I didn't have all the spices, but used my 5 spice powder (which has most of the spices). Added some brown sugar during the cooking and after pureeing it added a little 1/2 and 1/2

I made this to use up an excess of carrots, and loved the sweet potato for added protein. I used scant cardamom and cayenne after reading the reviews, and it went very well with samosa from this site. Great vegetarian meal that will remain in my repertoire. Thanks!

This was delicious soup. I added minced garlic. Served with grated cheese blend. This made quite a lot, as I realized that I needed to use all 3 of my sweet potatoes. This made the proportion of sweet potatoes to carrots a little different, but it didn't seem to matter. I have to admit that my carrots were not the freshest in the world, but when blended, that didn't seem to matter either.

I washed and scrubbed, but did not peel the sweet potatoes and carrots.  Used 16 oz. of homemade vegetable broth + 2 cups of water, and 2 TBSP of canola/olive oil + a glob of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" margarine (lite) instead of butter. Otherwise followed directions. But it tasted like pumpkin pie! So I added some Herbamare (spicy), ground black pepper and granulated garlic - then it was perfect!

This was terrific.  My adult son liked it.  In and of itself, that would lead me to make it again.  It froze well too.  I didn't make any changes.  It doesn't make very much.  I will read other reviews to see if anyone doubled it successfully.  It might be too hard to manage pureeing it with a blender, but I use a hand held one.

I made this as is and it was good, but when I changed it up a little it was better. I roasted my sweet potato and carrot chunks with salt, pepper, and cinnamon first (~20 mins on 350F) that added a lot of depth to their flavor. I also avoided the butter and used cooking spray, added minced garlic and blended with my immersion blender (sooo much easier than transferring). I also added a dollop of greek yogurt at the end to make it extra creamy. Very good.

Fantastic! I made only 2 changes - I used 1/2 the amount of cardamom and used garlic instead of onion. Loved the spicy kick. Delicious!

Wanted to love this but didn't.  On paper this recipe looked fantastic as I really like all of the ingredients except cardamom.  I omitted the cardamom but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The color was beautiful and the texture was perfect...the flavors just did't wow me.  A dollop of plain Greek yogurt the night I made it did improve it, as did sitting overnight.  Overall it wasn't bad but I will continue looking for a keeper recipe for sweet potato soup.

This soup was delicious! Pureeing it made it smooth and the flavor was phenomenal. I left out the tumeric & red pepper flakes because I didn't have any, but this soup was still very tasty and the cayenne gave it the zing I wanted. Instead of plain yogurt, we stirred in a little half & half just before eating it, which made it nice and creamy. Very filling. My husband and I wanted to eat the entire batch, but we saved half for our lunch tomorrow - took a lot of will power to do that! :)

Very fragrant, very easy, and very healthy!  I added a dallop of plain yogurt and it was delicious!  What a wonderful soup for Fall, thank you!

I thought this recipe had potential, but I didn't have any cardamom.  I did have coriander so I used that.  I doubled the amount of chicken stock and the soup was still pretty thick.  At the end I added the zest and juice of an orange.  It was really good.

First time cooking with cardamom. I'd use less cardamom next time. Other than that the soup was very good.

I loved the combination of spices.  I thought it was quite rich and would be better as a side dish rather than the main event.  Made more than 4 servings.
