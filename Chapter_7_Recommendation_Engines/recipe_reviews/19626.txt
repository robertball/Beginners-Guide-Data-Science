This is wonderful.  I highly recommend it.  I made it exactly as the recipe.    I don't like reading reviews where people write a lengthy paragraph of how they changed and added.  That to me is making your own recipe and not rating the original recipe.  Thanks for this wonderful sauce.

Wonderful flavor.  I made just a couple of adjustments because the sauce was really spicy (I like that but too spicy for the kids). First off I doubled the recipe then did 3/4 brown sugar, 1 1/2 c. ketchup, and then added 2 T. molasses.  I also only put in 1/2 an onion instead of 2.  I think next time I'll cut them up really small instead of slicing.  We put them on ribs tonight & it was soooo good!  Thank you Irene!

This was good with additions for my family. This was too vinegary and spicy for the kids. Addition of 2 tablespoons of water, 2 tablespoon ketchup, 1 tablespoon dark corn syrup, 1 teaspoon brown sugar.  Nice and sweet with a slight heat undertone.

This was fantastic!  Was very simple to make, and the taste can't be beat.  Not to mention it's much healthier than the stuff in the store.  I simmered on low for an extra 20 min. and it thickened up nicely!  Thanks so much, I'll never buy the bottled stuff again!

I let this age several days, which allowed the vinegary flavor to mellow. It was very good indeed. I'll be making it for gifts come Christmas. I did make some changes:  I halved the amount of vinegar (used water to make up the liquid volume) and substituted balsamic instead of distilled white. I used lime instead of lemon juice.   I diced the onions and carmelized half of them before adding to the sauce.   I used half the amount of sugar and used tomato paste instead of ketchup (I really don't like sweet BBQ sauce).

Excellent!  I used it as a marinade on chicken and baked the sauce and chicken in a 350 degree oven for 30-40 minutes.  It turned out so good!  I think it's one of my husbands new favorites!

This is a great barbeque sauce.  I prefer a zesty, more savory bbq sauce and this was perfect!  The entire two cups were used on one slab of baby back ribs and we all wished that we had more for dipping. I will probably double the recipe the next time I make this. 

FYI:  I like to read reviews and often apply reviewer suggestions when I make a recipe I find here.  For this recipe, I left out the vegetable oil (as suggested), used dried minced onion in place of fresh (since I don't like a strong onion flavor or texture) added 1 tsp of chopped garlic (as suggested) and substituted apple cider vinegar for white vinegar, as suggested and due to personal preference).

I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you BOBEVERLY.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I used it on ribs and grilled them adding sauce each time I tuned the ribs.  It was a hit with the kids too.

I was very surprised how good this was. The ingredients were not intuitive for me, and the smell of the sauce base boiling was NOT very good! I baked chicken with this sauce, reserving some for a final basting - and it was really, truly great, and I was so pleased that it wasn't heavily laden with sugar like so many sauces. Will make it again!

Very good recipe!  I chose it because I was pressed for time and could put it together fairly quickly with ingredients I had on hand.  I included everything except the Liquid Smoke.  I added a bit of cornstarch for a thicker spreading consistency while barbequing.  Very kid friendly.

This sauce is amazing! We like a thicker sauce and I noticed that someone mentioned they let it simmer an extra 20 minutes and that's the only thing I did that went off recipe.  It thickened up quite nicely, has a great taste and I can't wait to use it for dinner tonight.

Awesome! I use smoked paprika for the smoke flavor, to avoid the chemicals in the liquid smoke. I leave out the onion and Worcestershire (allergies to soy and onion) and the vegetable oil (veg oils are a processed food, thus bad for you), and use AC vinegar instead of white. I also use organic tomato paste and mustard powder, instead of prepared mustard and ketchup. I sub all of the above to taste. My family KILLS this.

I was throwing dinner in the crock pot before work and discovered that I did not have any BBQ sauce.  I jumped on this site and saw this recipe and thought I would try.  The consistency was not like I had hoped.  It was too watery.  I just threw all ingredients in crockpot and left.  Perhaps the difference is actually cooking for 20 min on stove top first? The taste was good.  My kids complained that there was too much onion in it. If I do again, I will chop onion.

Yeah it was a little oily but not in a bad way, not to us at least.  I liked this a lot actually.  The onion really stood out.  With a little cinnamon & honey addition I will probably make this again.  Thanks for sharing BOBEVERLY!

WOW!!  This is a great recipe.  I will never buy BBQ sauce again.  Made the original and it was great.  But also super easy and easy to adapt to what I had on hand.  For example, the next time I subbed rice vinegar and soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce and left out the liquid smoke because I did not have any AND it was still GREAT! .

Tasty for sure! I upped the brown sugar by one Tablespoon, added 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, then omitted the cayenne and it was a huge hit with adults and children alike. Simmer at the very for 10-15 minutes for a thicker sauce or leave it thinner if that's your preference. It is now my standard go-to barbeque sauce. Thanks Irene!

Excellent sauce! The only thing I changed was to cut the salt to 1/2 tsp -my husband needs to watch his salt intake and we don't like things overly salty anyway. Next time I might leave it out entirely. The kids loved it! Put it over chicken breasts in the slow cooker. Yummy!!! I will never buy barbeque sauce again.

Fantastic!  I also doubled the recipe so I could have sauce for turkey meatballs later in the week. I poured the sauce over a large pkg of chicken drumettes and baked in the oven until the chicken was done. I did not add the 1/4 cup vegetable oil to the sauce and didn't think it needed it.  I also went lighter on the vinegar as recommended by others. I  used brown, spicy mustard that I had on hand.  We had mashed potatoes and cole slaw with this marvelous meal.  This was great Irene.  Thanks!

This sauce was really really good. definately a keeper in the recipe box.  i added half a habanero pepper and it gave it some spice, while i doubled on the ketchup and brown sugar. so at first its sweet then comes the spice. it was awesome!!

I hate to do this, but we followed the directions to a T, and thought this was just awful. The spice was nice, but it was way, way too acid, it was like oily vinegar with some ketchup thrown in. I think we are going to play with this one a little bit, though, it has potential.

WOW!  The flavor of this sauce is fantastic!  I used it on my bbq that I make in the crock pot with a boston butt roast.  The only thing I may do different next time is less oil and more ketchup.  I would like a thicker sauce that can be added to bbq sandwiches, this was very runny. But it did great justice to my bbq!  Thank you!

I did not have bbq sauce for a recipe and decided to try it.  This is delicious!!    I added an extra dash of cayenne pepper and pureed half the onion into the sauce with an immersion blender. YUMMY!!

Since I made this a few months ago, I have not bought barbeque sauce.  It is amazing, sweet, tangy and spicy!  The only difference is, I don't add the liquid smoke flavor (can't stand the stuff!).

I did a few things differently, basically a combination of things that others said they did in their reviews. Overall it turned out great, I may never want to buy barbecue sauce again!

Good recipe..... but doing it again I would back off on the Ketchup.   1/2 cup should be more like 1/3 cup.....Ketchup seemed to dominate the recipe.

This has got to be the best barbeque sauce recipe i've ever run across on this site!  My mother had a recipe very similar to this one but i think this one has it beat.  I do add a tbsp of molasses and use 1 tbsp splenda brown sugar.   Otherwise, no other changes.  I've used it on pulled pork and grilled chicken now...can't see using any other bbq sauce recipe ever again!  Thanks for a great post!

Absolutely awesome!  The only changes I made:  I used 1 T of brown sugar instead of 2, no cayenne (for the kids), a little less oil (less fat), and I used smoked salt instead of liquid flavor (I didn't have any).  This is the only BBQ sauce I'll be using for a while!

I made this one night because I had all of the ingredients.  OMG!  For my first time ever making BBQ sauce, I was so impressed I could've drank the stuff.  I've now made it twice and I'm planning on doing it again.  The first two times I made recipe exactly as stated, but next time I will dice the onions instead of slicing.  Thanks so much for a great sauce

Great!  I needed more barbeque sauce fast and searched for what looked like something I would like- not very sweet.  Cooked this up and it was great! Will use it from now on.  One thing I would change (I didn't the first time) is dice the onion.

I left out the cayenne entirely, since we don't like super spicy bbq, and added a few dashes of Crystal hot sauce. I replaced the 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup coffee leftover from breakfast to add some depth and it was great. I made 1 recipe's worth and put it in the crockpot with some already cooked and shredded meat - there were about 8 helpings of meat and there wasn't nearly enough sauce. Luckily its quick and easy and cheap so I whipped up another batch to serve at the table. I poured the remainder of the pot in w/ the tupperware with the leftover meat and my lunch tomorrow is going to KICK A$$.

I really like this recipe! It's exactly the way I like my bbq sauce! The only change I would suggest is use way less oil, as it is oily. I used just a pinch less, but next time will cut it in half. Wish I doubled this recipe, it's that good! Making ribs tonight for dinner and wanted a homemade bbq sauce to slather on them! This ones a keeper!

Nice tangy bbq sauce.  Easy to make.  The onions were chunky in it.  I used it in a baked bbq beef recipe, if I were going to use it as a side I would probably run it through the food processor to get a smoother texture.

Made as is in recipe, did not change anything. Made twice because I had to be sure there was no error prior to giving a bad review. DOES not taste like BBQ sauce. Too much vinegar and very oily!

Very easy to make and tasty! I didn't have liquid smoke, but it was still good. I decided to blend it since there were still onion chunks. That made it turn ORANGE, super fun!!

i love this....i made this over a campfire last yr where we salmon fish at and everyone raved over it...i used orange juice instead of the lemon juice...and i decreased the cayenne pepper by a 1/4 tsp .... this is great to make in bulk and store in canning jars cause it seals when poured into the jars hot and keeps longer.....i will continue making this for our camping trips to the river...

This is insanely good. My husband used it when serving burgers to his 13 co-workers, and they loved it too! So easy make, and it stays refrigerated well. I'll be using this recipe again for sure. Thanks!

YUM!  I took the advice from some other reviews and added 2 tablespoons of water and 1 teaspoon brown sugar.  I also added about 1-2 tablespoons of maple syrup, about 1/4 cup red wine and a shot of scotch after the initial 20 minutes of simmering.  I brought it back to a boil, and let it boil about 3 minutes or so (longer if you want to boil more of the booze off).  I can't wait to eat this with my chicken tonight; the sauce was amazing on its own.

I followed recipe exactly as written, but I thought it was too much oil for my taste.  Perhaps I didn't let it boil long enough.  Thank you for submitting.

Great starter recipe.  I had some bacon grease in the skillet from lunch.  I sliced green onions and chopped up a clove of elephant garlic and sauteed.  like another poster, i used tomato paste.  and sauteed that with the onions n garlic (kinda sweated some  of the liquid out...)  added lemon juice, mustard, course red pepper, liquid smoke, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, splash of vinegar and salt.  unfortunately, i never measured anything so now I have an AWESOME bbq sauce and have no idea exactly how I got there.  will just start with this recipe again next time.  thank you for sharing!

Great sauce. I didn't have any Worcheshire sauce, so I threw in a dash of A1 instead. It had a little more bite than I'd like, so I added a couple tablespoons of applesauce and the result was perfection. I'll definitely double (or triple) the recipe in the future so I can apply it more liberally. I slow cooked a brisket in diluted sauce then topped with more sauce and it was amazing. Can't wait to barbeque with it.

This sauce was great. I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and only used 1/2 onion and 1/2 the vinegar. I didn't have any liquid smoke, so I just added an extra tablespoon of worcestershire. I added an 1/4 extra cup of water and cut the oil by 1/2 because it was a little oily. Really good sauce tho.

This is a great sauce thank you for sharing! It was just a little to much salt for us so next time I will cut the salt outside of that it was wonderful! I had a pork roast left over and chunked it put it in the sauce had a yummy dinner!

Well, I get a grade of "D" for following directions.  I dumped all ingredients in the beginning instead of saving the last 3 to dump in the last couple minutes. Oh well, still turned out fabulous. I used honey instead of brown sugar (did not have any) and added some dried chipotle powder and Sriracha since I like it spicy! This sauce is delicious. Used it on Smokey Mountain Chicken recipe also on this site. Next time I'll cook it correctly and see if it makes a difference, and I don't think it needs quite that much oil so I'll reduce it by about 1/3 next time.

Didn't have liquid smoke or cayenne, so I subbed chipotle pepper (used one pepper and about a tablespoon of the adobo sauce)--it covered both the smokiness and the heat well.  I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because I found it a bit too vinegar-y; at the end I added a bit more ketchup and a few teaspoons of honey.  Nice flavor--sweet and spicy.

This was a tastey sauce!  I wish I would have made more of it.  I know next time to scale it up quite a bit.  I used half red onion and half yellow.  I also pulled the onions out so the kids could not see them.  They were yummy by themselves.  Thanks for the recipe:)

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I was looking for a sauce that was not too sweet and I found it.  As did many others, I left out the liquid smoke and it still turned out wonderful

I needed something quick and easy and this fit the bill.  I also wanted something that didn't use tons of ketchup.  I made this for ribs and it was excellent.  I increased the brown sugar and accidentally left out the oil and didn't miss it at all.

Living on a cattle ranch, we also trap the occasional wild hog. I used this recipe on some smoked hog that I chopped up for BBQ sandwiches. WOW it was good. Just a couple alterations.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper or liquid smoke, and I felt it needed more brown sugar ( maybe 3/4 of a cup total) For a little extra "something" I added about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and some minced garlic. Delicious!

THis recipe worked GREAT with my slow-cooker baby back ribs!! I seared the ribs and put them in the crock with some of Trader Joe's Vintage Ale. After two hours, I poured 4 cups of this sauce over the whole thing and voila! My Fiance LOVED it!! Instead of slicing the onions, I used my food processor to chop them up and I added a little bit more cayene than suggested (i like it  spicy). Great recipe, will use again!

We were not too sure that we were going to like this sauce until today.  I made it last week, we tasted it and my DH thought it would be good on "pork".  Sooo last night I put it in the slow cooker with a pork top loin boneless roast and let it go for several hours.  Then "pulled" it today and OMG...it made terrific pulled pork sandwiches.  That is why I gave it 5 stars.  I am going to try it on other "pork" dishes very soon.  Thank you for sharing another excellent recipe here at allrecipes.

Thanks to Beverly and her mother-in-law.  This barbeque sauce was delicious.  I used balsamic vinegar, dijon mustard, doubled the cayenne and added an extra tablespoon.  Once I let the sauce simmer for the recommended time, I strained the onions, pureed them and then put them back in the sauce.  It thickened the sauce slightly and maintained the flavor of the sauce while keeping it smooth.  Yum!

After reading the reviews, I made this but cut the oil down to 1T and it  was still oily, I used apple cider vinegar, cut lemon juice to 1T, Worchestershire to 1T and increased brown sugar by 2T and it was still way to tangy. Will probably not make again.

I thought this had a very good taste to it, it was a little strong on the tang, but very good!! However, I made this without the liquid smoke because I was out, and it still was very good!! The only negative was it was on the watery side and I like my sauce a little more thicker, but other than that, it was a great recipe!!

I'm about to make this for the 4th time.  I use this as my go-to BBQ sauce now. Used it last night on chicken breasts, both as I had it on the grill and at the table as a sauce.  I love it.  I might substitute the onion with shallots this time.  My big adventure.

I did not use liquid smoke and added more brown sugar, as my family prefers sweeter sauce.  This tasted authentically homemade.  My husband loved it.  I liked it but it was not a favorite of the kiddos.  I prepared it for ribs,  I would use this for pulled pork sandwiches, but not ribs again.

flavor is great.  too oily for me.  I skimmed a bunch off the top.  I used the drippings from my brisket in place of the water.  next time I won't use oil and see how it goes.  good sauce though, best recipe I've tried for bbq sauce.

This is awesome!  Talk about wow sauce...everyone loved it.  We had it with pulled pork and chicken.  The second time I made it, I did not use onions.  Used onion powder instead.  It kept the spout of my bbq sauce bottle from clogging and was still really yummy!

This is a very good barbeque sauce.  I didn't change or add any ingredients.  At the end, I used an immersion blender and the sauce came out silky smooth.  If you don't like those sickening sweet barbeque sauces sold in the grocery , this is the sauce for you!  Thanks for sharing it!

This is good, but it was too tangy for our tastes. I would make it again, but cut the vinegar by at least 25%, and add a bit more brown sugar if you like your sauce sweet.

I loved that this recipe made a sane amount of sauce and I don't need a 2nd fridge to store the unused portion.  I had everything on hand which made it my chosen recipe for tonight's dinner. I altered the technique not the ingredients a bit.  I pureed the onions and sauteed that mix in the oil and then dumped all the ingredients together and simmered.  Looking forward to it on my chicken...it was good on my finger so it must be good on chicken, right?

This recipe is great fresh as a marinade but not as a dip.  I didn't get to taste it aged but I can tell you it's wonderful on grilled chicken.  It's not my personal favorite flavor but it is very unique (in a positive way) and well-spiced.  We will definitely be using this again!

This sauce is spicy and awesome as written! I did have to make a few changes because of my hubby's restricted diet ( tomato paste instead of ketchup, simmering onions then removing them, and smoked paprika in lieu of liquid smoke, and just used water instead of oil). Way better tasting (and for you) than anything you'll find in the store! Thank you!

Loved it. I used sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil for a healthier substitute and used chipotle seasoning instead of liquid smoke. This stuff is the real deal. My mouth is still watering just thinking about the leftover sauce I have!

Excellent barbeque sauce.  Made according to the recipe and it was tasty with a bit of heat.  Mixed the sauce with leftover shredded roast beef and heated.  This is a real keeper.  Thanks!

this is really spicy but good. if you make it for kids to eat too omit the cayenne. i made two batches ( small) of this and its good with or without the cayenne pepper. a nice change not my favorite but good for a new taste on your bbq. i used kens carnitas i had leftover to make bbq sandwiches with this and it worked well.

Easy to make and tastes great, my husband kept complimenting me, because I don't cook that often, he has even asked me to make it again. You can't get a better review than that.

First time I've ever made BBQ sauce from scratch.  I really like a sweeter sauce, so I added much more brown sugar.  Very nice, will probably make this again.

This is a pretty good recipe. I didn't have kethcup on hand, so instead i used a can of tomato sauce and paste. I let it cook on low for about 15-20. It was to tart, but that could be because of my substitutions. I'm not sure. I used it on pulled pork sandwiches, it was really good. Will try again.

Very good and very easy but it really doesn't make a lot.  I would double for my 4.5 lb beef brisket in the future.

Perfect quantity, perfect basic recipe. Just what I was looking for. Easy and fast, too! I've made variations on this simply by adding a jalapeno, or some hot chili sauce, molasses, whatever you feel like. But this is a great basic to add to your repertoire. Love it!

This BBQ sauce is AWESOME! 

I needed a quick BBQ sauce as my husband decided to grill a whole mess of meat for me, to get us through the next few days and I found that there was nothing in our cupboards to slather the chicken with.

Mine came out lighter than the picture shown, not really sure why. I exchanged the onion called for for onion powder (because I ended up throwing everything in the blender) and added a bit of garlic powder. Oh, I had to add a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to the sauce to thicken it up a bit. It was way too thin to stay on the chicken while it was 
being grilled. Otherwise, I kept it true to the recipe. This doubles well for those who like a lot of sauce on their meat. 

Excellent sauce! I see no need to buy
premade sauce again.

I like a sweeter barbeque sauce, so I added 1/2 cup brown sugar, a tablespoon or so of molasses, and a small can of tomato paste.  I used it on grilled chicken breasts and my husband raved about it.  Looks like we won't be buying the bottled stuff again any time soon.

Used this with pork bbq sandwiches in the slow cooker.  Excellent!!!!  We chopped the onion finely though instead of sliced, that's the only thing we changed.

made exactly but without the smoke flavoring.  Used it on ribs and it was quite good - a little runny but I could have fixed that with cornstarch - will try that next time.

I made a batch as a quick fix for a sauce that went terribly wrong!  This was great - I didn't have the liquid smoke, but found it to be just fine anyway.  We used this over shredded beef sandwiches and everyone raved!

This is some of the best BBQ sauce I've ever had.  I doubled the pepper and added some tobasco sauce at the end to spice up and used it with some ribs.  Just delicious!!!

This recipe is my new favorite.  I increased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and left out the liquid smoke (because I didn't have any).  Tangy, sweet, and delicious!

Nice tangy, sweet flavour.  Used it on ribs.  Thought I would have enough sauce left over to use on barbecued chicken through the week, but someone has been dipping into it. Will definitely make this again.

My new BBQ sauce!  I use this all the time now.  It is easy to make.  I actually marinate my chicken breasts in it for a few hours and then use the remainder to baste with while grilling.  You can up the cayenne to make it a little more spicy too!
