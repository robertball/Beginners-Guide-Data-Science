Loved this recipe! I've even made it twice this month! The only substitution I made was sweet potatoes for white potatoes. The meat was moist and delicious and the veggies perfect. My entire family loved it!

I used 12 ozs Sammy A draft, 1 can 25% less sodium cream of mushroom soup, homemade dry onion soup mix (from this site).  I used regular potatoes and chip carrots.  I also added a little corn starch to help thicken up the gravy.  I don't add salt to any meal so if you want it, add it to your plate.  Were quite pleased with this keeper!

This was good, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to make it again as we never buy beer and I use another slow cooker roast recipe on AR that we love. Only changes were to use condensed cheddar cheese soup with diced fresh mushrooms instead of the condensed mushroom soup and a bone-in veal blade roast. I roasted the vegetables separately as I have a small slow cooker. It does need more seasoning though.

I really liked this pot roast. I did read the other reviews that there was not enough seasoning, but that is easy to fix. I seasoned both sides of the beef with "McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning". It came out awesome. The stout beer gives it great flavor too.

Very good and meat very tender but not as tasty as Lipton onion/cm of mushroom soup with meat in foil and not quite as flavorful as pot roast in dutch oven.

Needs more seasoning, maybe some herbs.  I thought it would be salty but it was not.  Easy.

Absolutely delicious and tender! The main thing I do different however is to brown the roast before adding it to the crock pot. I season flour with salt, pepper and garlic powder and coat the roast. Brown the roast on both sides in a pan with a little olive oil. Also I use about 2 lbs of potatoes and 6-8 cloves of garlic instead of just the 1 suggested in the recipe. (We love garlic!)

Very good! I did however need to add a little salt and pepper at the table but I'd rather do that then have it be too salty right out of the crockpot.

I didn't love this meal. I thought it was bland. The meat was good, but I didn't like the way it made the potatoes and veggies taste. It was a dinner and we ate it with no complaints, but I don't think I would make it again.

3/5 stars because I haven't actually tried it, yet. Sounds like a solid recipe, although I will be making some changes. I will definitely be adding a few sprigs of thyme and some bay leaves, as well as some beef broth or beef bouillon cubes, whichever I happen to have on hand. Also, I will be adding button mushrooms. I love mushrooms! Also, instead of cooking the potatoes with the roast, I'll be making mash on the side. All in all, I am excited to have this especially since my Irish friend from Tipperary will be attending. :D I will re-review once I know how it turns out.

My family and I really enjoyed this last fall and winter. Now that the comfort food season is back I'm ready for more.  I often adjust recipes to make them my own, but this one was perfect for me as is.

The first time we made this recipe my husband said it was the best pot roast he has ever had. I was on the fence. We followed the recipe (twice) except for searing the steak before putting it in the Crock-Pot, adding more garlic, and adding some fresh mushrooms.  Last night we made it again using 12 oz of red wine instead of beer. It was perfect.  Great base recipe, liquid proportions are perfect.

The first time in a while my roast didn't come out dry.  Very good.  This one will be made again for sure.  Pretty much followed the recipe and it doesn't need any changes.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day, and it is by far one of the best slow cooker pot roasts I've ever made. We used an extra stout Irish beer and it added an incredible flavor.  The only modifications I made was I seasoned the roast with Montreal Steak seasoning and seared both sides before putting it into the crock pot.  I also used only half the beer and added beef stock for the other 6 ounces of liquid. This recipe is a keeper!!

This is a great baseline recipe!  I usually prepare this the day before by searing all side of the pot roast.  This searing is not done to "seal in the juices," which is an old wive's tale.  Searing creates addition flavors through the Maillard reaction, which "is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives browned food its desirable flavor."  I then combine the beer, soup mix, canned soup, and salt with a stick blender.  I put this in casserole dish with a cover and place the meat in it to marinade overnight.  The next morning, all I have to is prep the vegetables and pour in the meat and liquid ingredients into the crock pot, turn it on and wait six hours for the goodness.

I liked this a lot.  My two teens thought the beer taste was a little odd for their taste buds, though.

Love this recipe - I have made it twice in the past couple of months.  The only change I have made is to bake it in the oven at 300 for about 4 hours rather than in the slow cooker, mainly because my slow cooker is too small for this recipe.  I have used a maple stout and an Irish breakfast stout for the beer - both are excellent!

Try cooking it in the oven covered with aluminum foil. I cook mine at 285 degrees for 2.5-3.0 hours. Ditch the crock pot on this one.
