Hello all.  I'm the author of this recipe and I just wanted to clarify that it calls for 2 (5 ounce) tubes of biscuit dough - 10 biscuits total.

I had everything on hand except the biscuit dough.  So, I used crescent roll dough instead and it worked beautifully.  Such an easy appetizer that everyone enjoyed!

I would make it again for a side but I wouldn't recommend having it for a main dish. They are easy to make but it is too much biscuit compared to the amount of sausage in my opinion. The pesto is a good choice!
