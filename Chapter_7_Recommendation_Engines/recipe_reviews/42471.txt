Overall, pretty good and a great way to use up leftover ham. I added some salt and pepper to the avocado and mayo mixture. I made these into wrap sandwiches using tortillas and added some shredded lettuce as well. I cut these in half and served with pickles and chips.

This is a wonderful sandwich- I really enjoyed it.  I used my own homemade bread (Classic Whole Wheat Bread from this site) and cheddar cheese (and light mayo and light cream cheese).  I loved the avocado mix- I added a sprinkle of garlic powder.  This made a nice light meal with a fruit smoothie.

I made these for my baby shower and they were a big hit.  The avocado mix is so creamy and the cayenne adds just a little hint of spice.  I will definitely make these again.

These were ok.  Nothing special. I had high hopes for the spread but it was kind of bland.

Not a bad sandwhich. I only used enough ingredients for one sandwich. I took the meat ( I added turkey and chicken with the ham) and bread to work in a baggie and the avocado. I took the sandwich out of the baggie and put it on a paper plate, I peeled the avocado and put it in the baggie with the mayo and mushed it until creamy. Put the avocado mixutre on top of the meat and enjoyed!! I didn' t have cream cheese.

I only used the avacado sauce part of this recipe but it went really well on our sandwiches.
