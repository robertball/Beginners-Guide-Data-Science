Yum! I boiled the Russet potatoes as directed, then put them in an ice water bath for 5 minutes.  I only fried them for about 5 minutes per side on medium to medium-high heat (6/10).  They were dark-golden crispy on the outside with  just the right amount of softness on the inside.

The key to this is the same to good mashed potatoes - the refridgeration.  Shirley Corriher in Cookwise explains why this works.  The glutens that make potatoes gooey and sticky, crystalize when chilled and once crystalized - they stay that way which makes for non-gooey hash browns and light fluffy mashers.

I have tried many ways of cooking hash browns. Pre-cooking (instead of rinsing, drying etc.) and letting chill overnight made a great difference. An important thing is not to overcook. You want them to be tender but not falling apart; to shred better. I don't think it is neccesary to add oil, if you brown/crisp LONG ENOUGH before turning. I start out on medium-high heat then turn heat down to med, as soon as they start to brown. Then cook for about *20* minutes on ONE side, THEN TURN. I also like to "cut" (with the spatula) into serving size pieces prior to turning. I sometimes use another buttered pan to finish the other side (more room to turn). FYI; If you "press" down the potatoes at first, and brown/crisp for a long time, cut into serving sizes, they freeze well for reheating in the toaster later. Thank you, Denyse, for sharing. I prefer feeding my family *homemade* to oily, store bought with added preservatives.

A great hash brown recipe! This is is how I cook mine "Southern style." I cook my hash browns in bacon grease, not butter. This gives extra flavor and makes them less likely to burn. And I use only cast iron cookware. That makes them cook evenly.

Very simple, delicious recipe.  I would also recommend adding a bit of oil to the butter to keep it from burning.  Also, when it came time to flip the hash browns, I placed a large plate over the frying pan, turned the pan upside down, and then slid the hash browns back into the pan.  Worked great and it came out in one, lovely, crispy, brown piece.  While it's hard not to peek, keeping the hash browns on the first side for at least 15-20 does make a huge difference in the amount of crispiness you will achieve.  Super recipe!  Thanks, Denyse!

I've never made hash browns from scratch, so when I found this recipe, I knew I just had to try it. These tasted exactly, if not better than what we enjoy at our favorite diners here in Jersey. Denyse, your grandma certainly knew what she was doing because this was genius. Who would have thought to boil and refrigerate? Because I decided on this side just hours before dinner, I speeded up the process by placing the potatoes in the freezer until they were good and chilled. I did add sauteed chopped onion to this and some garlic and onion powders. I'll never, ever go back to the frozen stuff again!! Thank you so much!!!!

Excellent traditional way to cook Hash Browns.  Want to make them more than a breakfast dish?  Cook them and use them for a bed for a nice cajun filet of fish or any cut of fish.  These are great and there is NO REASON they should be enjoyed only for breakfast!

I like to add onions to my hash browns.  Saute a handful of chopped onion in a teaspoon of oil while grating the potato.  Adds a nice flavor.

This is a perfect simple recipe for hash browns.  I think these are right on par with the ones you get at restaurants.  Be careful not to overcook the potatoes, they are nearly impossible to shred if they are too tender.  I also just stuck them in the freezer for 30 min, instead of overnight and they were great!  I didn't have much luck getting them to stick together, but I plan on making these again and again.  I think next time I will try cooking these in the oven to make them extra crispy!  (will update after I try) UPDATE: Just tried baking these tonight...and HUGE success!  I greased a baking sheet, mixed about 1T flour in with the potatoes, and shaped them into round patties.  They cooked on 435 for 30 min (check for browness on bottom), then another 15 after flipping.  They were crispy and delicious!  Will bake these again and again--made our breakfast!

Very good, Simple and easy to make.  This is a good traditional recipe.  I don't know why people would complain about hash browns not being flavorful enough? That is what salt and ketchup was invented for!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

We SO enjoyed these - with lots of black pepper!  I added just a little vegetable oil to the butter so I could raise the heat high enough to brown and crisp the potatoes without the butter burning.

Another option if you know you want to have potatoes in the morning is to microwave them the night before and toss into the fridge, peel and all.  We like the more cubed, rather than shredded, hash browns, so it's simple to pull them out of the fridge, cut into small cubes with the skin on, and toss them into the oil.  Skin adds a nice change in the texture as they crisp up nicely.

I've had hash browns as a breakfast side in nice restaurants and of course the famous "McHash Browns" but they were boring and forgetable. I finally got around to seasoning an old cast iron skillet and wanted to give homemade a go. After searching on AR for recipies, I decided on this one. I liked the idea of cooking the potatoes the night before and thought it would improve the texture. As long as the potatoes are not overcooked they shred nice and evenly. This step doesn't take long and can be done as the butter melts. I seasoned the shredded potaotes before putting them in the pan so the salt and pepper was evenly distributed. I had cooked 4 slices of bacon, set them aside and added 2Tbsp unsalted butter to the bacon grease. After adding the potatoes to this pan I very slightly patted them down. Cooked on medium heat for 15 minutes without peeking (that was hard), then flipped them over using a small flat pizza pan then back into the skillet and cooked the other side for another 15 minutes. They just about all stayed together - I think if I had tried using a spatula to turn, the disk of potatoes would have broken. Not that they wouldn't have tasted ok if this did happen but I wanted to have them looking nice on the plate. These form a lovely brown and crispy crust and a perfectly soft inside. They were just how I wanted. I have made these using only butter. The bacon grease/butter was noticeably better. I have used the called for russet potatoes and I have used ordinary wh

This makes the best hash browns ever, rivaling restaurant quality. But it's very important not to overcook the potatoes. I make a huge batch and keep leftover shredded potatoes in the freezer, so they're ready whenever we want them. I like to leave the skins on. It is dangerous for me to have this recipe, because now I want to make them all the time!

I never knew there was a trick to hash browns. Mine always turned out sticky and gray, never knew you should boil them the night before! Thanks to this recipe, I have perfect hash browns every time and always have a few potatoes already made in the fridge so they're ready whenever and whatever portion I want. Great recipe

I love a good steak every week to 10 days and with that I love a baked potato.  Since hash browns are heavenly, I always add several 'extra' bakers to my oven.  Put the extra in the refrigerator at least over night, maybe several days, I peel the skins and cut the spuds into med size (I1/2 inch) chunks.  I always cook several slabs of bacon in the pan while preparing the hash browns.  Saute some onion and green pepper in the bacon oil, a little butter and mix in the potatoes.  Turn as they become brown and for an extra kick, serve with some good salsa.  Sounds so good I going to the kitchen and cook some up!

Has anyone tried using raw grated potatoes?
TO DIE FOR :-)
Peel,shred, squeeze the water out and fry as above.
Crispy on the outside,gooey on the inside.
We split them open and butter the insides. Yummm.

I am giving this a 5 for ease alone. I had microwaved some potatoes to use yesterday and didn't end up using them. It worked perfect with this recipe today. The recipe doesn't have seasoning, so they do have to be flavored to taste. Grating a cooked refridgerated potato is so much easier. The only thing else I did different is use 1 Tlbsp of vegetable oil and 1 Tblsp of whipped butter for the 2 Tblsp of butter to cut the saturated fat. Thank you, for simplifying the process of making hashbrowns.

I had high hopes for these based on the reviews but I must have done something wrong.  First of all, the shredded potatoes did not stick together when we cooked them - they were very hard to flip and serve as they kinda fell apart.  Secondly, the taste was quite bland (which could be easily fixed by adding more seasoning).

They taste great.  I was not able to get mine as crispy as the restaurants but I would need to practice again.  They got mixed up when I tried to flip.  I has scaled down to 3 servings.  I had my breakfast with coffee and scrambled eggs with cheddarella cheese.  BIG Thanks to Denyse and Grandma.

This is such a nice simple recipe, but not many folks are aware of the trick...  The cooking & cooling of the potatoes prior to shredding is "The Bomb".  It gives them just the right consistensy.  I vote for Butter over oil.

I've been trying for close to 20 years to make good hash browns.  I didn't know the secret was to cook your potatoes first.  No more bagged frozen hash browns for me.  These were almost restaurant quality hash browns.  I think my only mistake was not using enough oil for frying.  Thank your for sharing Grandma's recipe.

Great simple recipe.  For years I was making gray soggy hash browns.  But these are restaurant good.  Make sure you cover the potatoes when you refrigerate or they can turn gray.

I steamed the potatoes then followed the recipe.  The results were outstanding!  Definitely on my breakfast menu from now on.  Next time I might add some onions...

This is the recipe you've been looking for! No need to change a thing but you can. I cooked in a little bacon grease and added diced onion that burned a little so I'll have to work on that part. It is the cook then cool over night that makes the difference

I, too, add onions; green onions in my case.  I heard of a very simple way to "flip" the hash browns:  simply turn them out on a plate then place the skillet over the top - uncooked - side of the hash browns and turn them onto the skillet.  Much the easiest way for me!

Very good. Reminded me of the ones that you get at the pancake house. For a crisper hash brown, try working with smaller batches of shredded potatoes.

How easy. Thanks didn't know it was as easy as cooking night before. Mine never came out right and gave up until now. My son now wants these before school and as long as potatoes are cooked it's easy to do on a school morning. Thanks again

I used to fail miserably at hash browns till I found this method.   If I have not planned ahead and precooked the night before  I will chop and steam then fry right away. Can also  sub evoo and add onion and garlic powder.

Did not refrigerate potatoes, put them in the freezer for 15 minutes, it worked okay, but still a little mushy and I don't doubt that refrigerating them is the key. You can add anything you want for your personal touch: garlic, onion, red/green pepper, chili powder, paprika, cumin, curry... you can also use oil.

I was in a rush and decided not to refrigerate the potatoes over night. HUGE mistake. I must make a big difference. 

I waited maybe 40 minutes before using. They were cool but not cold. The potatoes were gummy and did not brown... well it was a mess! At that point I only used one potato. 

Not wanting to waste the potatoes, what I did was diced the rest of the potatoes and tossed them with a little oil and put them away in the fridge in a covered container.

A day and in a half later, I pre-heated a cast iron pan on about med heat. I added Sunflower oil to the pan and NOT butter. Tossed the potatoes in the pan and left them alone. After they browned I added (diced small)  vidalia onion, frozen bell pepper, and Salt and Pepper. Really, really good. 

I will try the shredded version again.

I was looking for a hash brown recipe that I would not have to deep fry in oil. I used this one, but did add my own touch, however. I mixed the chilled grated potato in a little flour and some chopped chives in a bowl, then pressed one serving's worth of the potato mixture into a 4-inch ring mold.  Removed the ring, and repeated with the remaining mixture. Fried on the griddle (at about 400 F) until golden brown on both side, about 5 min. each side. Serve with breakfast sausages, bacon, or ham.

Exactly what hash browns are supposed to taste like.  Other recipes may be fun to experiment with, but when you want a sure-fire winner, use this one.

I'll give this 5 stars but I don't think I cooked them correctly.  I think next time I will wait 20 minutes on the first side before flipping.  I think I flipped too many times.  Anyway, the taste was great.

Very good. We served with baked pork chops for dinner. Plus, I peeled & shredded the raw potato, then soaked that in cold water for a bit. I drained the potato, seasoned with salt, pepper, 1T flour, & seasonings then cooked with a spoonful of oil, a pat of butter and cooked over low heat in a teflon pan for about 30 minutes. I didn't have time to do all the steps but these were crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle. Great Spuds!

At last, the trick to hash browns that are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  A great basic recipe that you can alter in any way--the timing on boiling the potatoes was just about right.  The only thing is you don't have to cool overnight (though it's probably easier); I stuck them in the fridge for just a couple hours and they were firm enough to shred.  I followed everyone's advice and added a bit of oil to my butter.  I didn't even need to add salt or pepper; they were perfect with ketchup.

Yes indeed,this is how to make hash browns!! 
I boil the potatoes in the skin, leave the potatoes a bit firm.  refrigerate,  peel before grating, use oil instead of butter,  cook over medium heat, season well with S&P. 
Do not be in a hurry to turn them, wait until they are brown and crisp about 10-15 minutes, you can flip them all in one piece.  Cook the other side until barely brown  Just about enough time to make eggs &  toast.  Patience makes the best hash browns!  I have gotten rave reviews on hash browns, done this way...since 1977!  Thanks for posting the real deal, Denyse!!

found this recipe on pinterest last night thank goodness i did cause i was able to cook the potatoes and put them in the frig. shredded them this morning and cooked it for my husbands breakfast which he really liked except i put to much salt in them (oops). They where hard to flip but i think if i made smaller batches it would have been easier. Thanks alot for the recipe i have never been able to make hashbrowns before but now i have something to work with and master.

These were delicious and easy!  I never thought to try boiling the potatoes and then putting them in the fridge overnight before, but the potatoes cooked easier because they weren't completely raw when I put them in the pan.  I didn't have any butter on me, so I just used vegetable oil, which worked fine.  I added sea salt, pepper, and minced onion, and they tasted phenomenal.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Faster, easier and awesome - minutes to do -  is peel and cut potatoes into microwaveable bowl, add about 1/4 cup butter pats, about 2 - 3 chopped green onion, sprinkle with pepper, paprika, garlic plus, seasoned salt, celery seed and/or any seasonings you personally like, stir, cover and microwave for about 10 minutes covered with plastic wrap while you do other things.  When done stir and you and your family will LOVE LOVE LOVE  it with eggs and bacon, sausages, ham or whatever.  I even use this for dinner and add carrots, pieces of celery and whatever other veggies I like.  Too easy, fast and sooo yummy.

Delicious! Mine were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The secret really is to boil them, then let them chill *overnight*. It made all the difference. I will be making these again.

I am so happy to know the secret behind great hashbrowns.  This is the best way to get non gummy hashbrowns.  I served these on Christmas morning and they were a hit.

These turned out great. I forgot to boil the potatoes the night before, so I put them in the freezer for 1.5 hrs, and they came out fine. I used Yukon gold because that's what I had, and I sauteed some shallots before adding the potatoes. Great recipe for a perfect texture!

These are great. The best hash browns I've ever made at home and A LOT cheaper then buying frozen hash brown.  One note, 8 potatos make A LOT of hash brown.  This is the only recipe I'll use to make hash brown, nor will I buy store bought ever again!

Thank you for this recipe! It's GREAT!  I'm not the best cook, & don't have many things up my sleeve for breakfast, as our breakfasts growing up were mostly frozen waffles & cold cereal. My husband & I have decided to have breakfast every morning together now that we have our first child, & we'll surely be serving these hash browns A LOT! We don't mind prepping them the PM b4 at all - in fact, it helps us in the morning. Our only tip is if you're short on time, dice the potatoes b4 boiling them, & then just throw them in the pan in AM instead of spending time shredding them; we also add some cayenne and parsley while frying the potatoes. YUM!

i'll give this one a 4 because even though i was pretty disappointed with the result my husband LOVED them.  my first mistake was to use my food processor to shred the potatoes.  instead of shredding they came out pretty mushy.  next time i'll do it with the little hand held one.  my second mistake was cooking them in a pan.  cooking them for 20 minutes on medium heat on the first side was a little too long (although i have a gas range it's sometimes hard to tell the temp) and they were pretty dark.  my problem is always the flipping.  i can't ever get them to flip nicely it always turns into a big heap of goo.  next time i think i will try to make them on the griddle that might be easier.  i added a shredded onion and the flavor was awesome.  everyone loved them even though they looked kinda icky.  i'll give it another whirl and see if i can get it right next time.

I have loved hash browns since childhood, but have struggled to make decent ones.  This recipe is almost foolproof and makes excellent hash browns, very easy with just the right combination of soft and crispy.  The first time I followed the recipe as written and they turned out very well, but I couldn’t resist fiddling with it a little.  A couple slices of bacon add a nice flavor and the oil keeps the butter from burning.  Crumble the bacon into the shredded potatoes and add some diced green onion.  These little changes yield hash browns worth getting up early on Saturday for.  I tried yukon gold potatoes, but the Russets have a better texture.  Thank you  Denyse for taking the mystery out of a classic breakfast favorite.

WOW!!!!  These are amazing!  No need for ketchup or toppings.  I used house seasoning instead of just salt and pepper.  I make these all the time now.  It's totally worth the effort.

These were great! I boiled the potatoes a couple of hours before I needed them (didn't have time to do the night before) and let them sit in a pan of cold water to cool them. Still worked great! I also added  green onions into the frying pan once the potatoes were almost done. No leftovers here!

I feel so cool now that I'm in the 'I-know-how-to-make-homemade-hashbrowns-that-aren't-slimey-and/or-grey' club.  So, this is the secret: parboiling and refrigeration.  These were perfect; I'll never buy store-bought hashbrowns again.  Thanks Denyse's Grandma!

This worked well for breakfast. I confess, I did still fry these in a few TBLS of heated veg oil, but then, halfway through cooking, I melted the butter the recipe requires and poured it over the hashbrowns right before flipping them. Turned out nice, crispy brown and they had plenty of taste. Went well with our quiche! Thanks Denyse!

Great hash browns.  My husband said they were the best he'd ever had and he was raised on Southern cooking.  Here are my shortcuts:  
Boil medium red potatoes (3") in water until just tender. (whole, unpeeled) 
Refrigerate over night (or for a few days).
Shred peel and all in the food processor (3 seconds).
Heat a cast iron skillet until smoking hot with about 1 T oil.
Turn the heat down to medium hot.
Add the butter (to taste) and melt.
Add potatoes, spread out, and cook for 25 minutes
Turn and brown for 2-3 minutes.
Enjoy.

Pre-cooking the potatoes makes them come out fluffy on the inside rather than gummy like raw potatoes. Smaller patties rather than a whole panful are much easier to turn & a little salt (& pepper if you like) brings out the flavor wonderfully. Just be careful not to overcook the potatoes or they'll have a tendency to crumble rather than shred.

Flavor was a bit bland, I will make again using additional butter and seasonings. My biggest complaint is the quantity of potatoes. Even using my largest cast iron skillet there was just too much shredded potatoes to get a crispy hash brown. After 20 min I tried flipping but it just wasn't working. So I just broke it all up and flipped it around with my spatula until I got some reasonably crispy hash browns.

It was a long process in the making. I suggest not boiling the potatoes, and add a lot more oil while cooking.My potatoes started sticking to the pan layer by layer.

I love hash towns but could never get them like you do in a diner or Coney Island-- mine were always mushy/gooey.  NOT ANYMORE!  The magic of putting these in the drive overnight, or 6 hours in the day like I did, makes these just as good as your local diner!

This recipe is a blast from the past for me....I used to work in a restaurant, and the foil wrapped potatoes from the night before would be used to make hash browns for the next morning.  I know realize why they were so good.  The refrigeration after cooking is key.  I even made my own hash brown dish on the buffet on Sundays with onions and bell peppers, they loved it.    I have some russest in the refrigerator right now, and will report how they were in my update.

They were so good. I don't think we will ever buy frozen hash browns again.  For the first batch, I gave the potatoes an ice water bath. I also didn't boil them for 20 minutes. I only boiled them for about 10-15 minutes instead. This way, they were easier to grate with the grater and they didn't get too mushy.

Perfect.  I used Crisco and a little bit of onion powder (not salt) along with salt and pepper.  I used a cast iron griddle and didn't mind if the outcome was a wedge, a circle or a bit loose on the plate.  First batch was without covering with lid.  Second batch toward the end I covered the hash browns with a glass lid and splashed a bit of water onto the griddle to create a bit of steam under the lid for just under a minute .  These came out a bit creamier on the inside without losing the crispy outside.  Either way excellent texture and flavor.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I can't imagine any better approach.

This was the best recipe for hash browns I've ever tried.  Preparing the potatoes the nite before -- makes for a quick breakfast the next morning.  This is a "restaurant quality" recipe !

Great recipe.  The boil time on my gas stove was a few minutes too long and the potatoes were a little too soft.

I loved the fact that I could prep this overnight. In the morning, all I did was shred it in my food processer and I was good to go. Yummy.

Yum, yum, yum!  Like others, I did not have time to let it sit overnight, so after letting them sit for a couple hours, I shredded them and put them in a shallow pan in the freezer and then cooked them.  I only put 4 potatoes in the pan and used a little more butter.

I took a hint from your recipe to replicate these delicious "German potatoes" that I had at a local German restaurant.  Instead of russets, I used new red potatoes, and instead of shredding them, I sliced them.  Turned out GREAT!  Thanks for sharing!

I'll be the first to admit that I was TERRIBLE at hash browns, but not anymore. These were easy and tasty and just what someone like me needs to do hash browns right. I am so glad I found this recipe. Thank you.

I just made these for brunch.  Everyone loved them.  They truly are just like hash browns at a restaurant.  I cooked 8 russet potatoes from the "perfect potato" bag.  They are the kind that are supposed to be the perfect size.  I think that worked well because they cooked really evenly.  I forgot to cook them the night before, so I cooked them and then put them in cold water to cool them off.  Then peeled and grated.  It worked very well.  This does make a lot of hash browns.  It made 2 batches in a very large pan.  I didn't have any problems with the butter.  They didn't burn.  I used a large platter to turn the hash browns over.  Works like a charm.  Finally a secret to great hash browns instead of a gluey gray mess.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've been making this for a couple of years now and should have rated it way before now. The only change for me is I shape them into individual patties and bake them on an oiled baking sheet, in a hot oven, flipping once about halfway through.  It's an easy way to feed a crowd and still have the hash browns done at the same time. Great taste and texture. There are never any leftover.

I tried a variation that turned out delicious. My son is allergic to dairy, so I substituted coconut oil with plant based butter flavor. I also used half precooked refrigerated spaghetti squash to add more nutrients. My family loved it. The squash is very similar in texture to the potatoes and gives it a slightly sweet flavor which tastes very good with the savory spices. I agree that refrigeration is the key.

Okay, I peeled 4 potatoes and boiled them for about 20 min. Then I pulled them out of the water and placed them in a bowl, covered them in new water and placed the bowl in the freezer. (I saw where someone had done that.) I left it in there for an hour. Pulled the bowl out, emptied the water, started shredding one.  I only did two since it came out to be A LOT of hash browns.  I used a little bacon grease (saw someone suggest that) and butter and Olive oil. The potatoes came out ok.  A little mushy.  Someone suggested drying them, maybe I will do that with the two tomorrow.  So I left the other two in a bowl for overnight. Maybe that'll help too.

Eight large potatoes seemed like a lot for my large frying pan.  It was very good though.  I'll make again, but with only six large potatoes.  I do need to be patient about the time it takes to cook.  Everyone in my family raved about it!

Deeelicious. My Mrs loves onions in her hash browns and we can never find local restaurants who do it right. Thanks to Grandma for the recipe! I added my own chopped onions and my wife gobbled it up. I like mine a little more crispy so left them in the pan after I took the photo.

I did not have good luck with these.  The only thing I changed was I used bacon drippings in place of the butter.  They were not great.  Honestly, th potatoes that I sued could have been part of the problem.  They were bland.

Just great hash browns.  Finally, I can make them at home as good as any diner.  Of course I play with it and make my own changes to taste and what I'm in the mood for but I just wanted to elaborate on the reviewer who mentioned why this works and referencing Shirley Corriher.  First, it's actually the starch that crystallizes.  If anyone knows anything about resistant starches, some of them are created by cooking starchy foods and letting them cool.  They help block the digestion of carbs for several hours.  So in essence, this cooking method is healthier for you.  I won't comment on the actually overall nutritional benefits or values since I'm not a nutritionist but if I'm going to make hash browns and they're going to be as good or better than any diner, and "healthier," I'm making them this way from now on.

mmm, after eating these fresh hashbrowns, i rarely go back to the frozen kind.  i esp like to add 1/2 tsp tumeric, 1/2 tsp coriander, and 1/4 tsp cayenne to sauteed onions and garlic, and then add the grated potatoes.  it is scrumptious!

What a great recipe!  It's nice to finally know the trick to great hash browns, boiling and refrigerating.  We added chopped onions, pepper, and bacon.  There were no leftovers!  Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe, which will surely be a family favorite for years to come.

Outstanding!  Very easy, very crispy and tasty - just the way they should be.  And, I'm a huge fan of getting some of the work done the night before.  All I had to do was shred the potatoes while the coffee was brewing.....then fry them up while getting some scrambled eggs prepared.  Nice and easy.  Thanks for sharing this!!!

What a fab way to start a saturday morning.. delicious and simple. 
I added some chives for extra flavour and next time i will probably add an egg as i found them a little crumbly.

will definatly make it again
