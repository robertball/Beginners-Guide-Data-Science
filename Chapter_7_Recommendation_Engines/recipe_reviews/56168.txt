This is so delicious!  The flavours are very exotic, tangy sweet and spicy all in one bite!  I used mango chutney, roatsed my almonds before rolling, and added a pinch of salt to recipe.  Note:  I wouldn't say you have to love curry to enjoy this cheese ball, however I would say you have to have an appreciation for ethnic flavours, so if you or your guests don't enjoy going out of their comfort zone then I wouldn't recomend this cheese ball.

Really tasty. You can make with light cream cheese. We tried it with a spicy mango chutney so it had a little zip. Easy to make. Looks good, but I might do it as a "cheese log" instead so it's easier to eat with a group.

This is great, similar to one that sells at cheese store for 18.75/pound. Instead of almonds, I used chopped cashews, added some chopped dried apricot, shredded coconut, and some sauted in water raisins (to plump and soften them).  Was a hit...will make again.

Delicious and easy.  A big hit.  A little soft (even after refrigeration) to roll into a ball.  I served in a bowl and sprinkled with toasted almonds.

All I found for chutney was mango, I didn't add all that was called for. I found it too sweet. We all thought it was okay but not great. It is also very soft.

Very good and quite easy as well.  I made a log rather than a ball and was quite pleased.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half as it is a bit more than my family needs.

I was really excited to make this as it sounded great and a bit unusual. However, it did not turn out well.

I really liked this but it may have been too exotic for the guests at the party I brought it to because it was far from gone at the end of the night.

Fantastic taste and so easy to make.  I blended all ingredients in food processor and then folded in the nuts.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I have made this for years with a bit of modification. I use a block of cream cheese, sprinkle it with curry powder, spread on some chutney and top with some almonds or raisins. I almost always have the ingredients available. No fuss, no mixing.

A big hit with everyone.  I rolled it in toasted slivered almonds and it was perfect.  Thanks!

This has been a family favorite for decades.  I always use Major Greys Chutney (made by Cross and Blackwell) - for those of you who said it didn't form a bell well, my tip is to mix all ingredients except for nuts, and place in the middle of a large piece of plastic wrap.  Pull edges up and  gently shape into a ball. place in fridge, and as it chills., give it another shaping.  After a few hours peel the plastic wrap off, and roll in the sliced, toasted almonds.  MMMMMMMMMMMMM

took this to a womans weekend get away and everyone LOVED IT. It did not firm up into a ball so next time I will likely serve it in a bowl without bothering to try and get it into a ball.
EVERYONE wants the recipe

Super simple to make and full of flavor! There are dozens of kinds of chutney, and the recipe was vague, so I used mango chutney. I can see this being very versatile by swapping out different variations of chutney. I halved the recipe because this makes A LOT. Unless you are making it for a party, a half recipe will likely suffice. I made this for New Year's Day appetizers. Will be making this again.

I didn't think anyone would touch it but my family really enjoyed this. I think using the gourmet vegetable crackers helped, but even so, it was a hit

This was very tasty (as long as one likes curry) but even after more than 24 hours in the refrigerator, was way too soft to be able to stay into the shape of a ball. Just used it as a dip but would like to find a way to keep it more firm.

I have taken this cheese ball to gatherings many times.  I'm always asked for the recipe.  I  don't add the mustard, but a handful of golden raisons and an optional tbs. of mayo.  It's a for sure never fail and a hit.
