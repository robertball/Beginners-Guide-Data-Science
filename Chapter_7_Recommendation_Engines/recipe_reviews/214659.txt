I made 2 of these desserts, one following the directions and one with modifications as my mom used to make it.  For the modified version, I used Hershey's fudge sauce and couldn't tell the difference in the desserts.  Next time I will mix 1/4 melted butter with the crumbs for the bottom crust to hold them together, as my mom's recipe called for.  When serving the dessert most of the cookie crumbs stayed in the bottom of the pan.   The fudge layer was an awesome improvement over my mom's recipe!

This is a good recipe and it's easy to make. I would double the fudge though so that the layer is a little thicker and not use quite as much powdered sugar, it was really sweet. I also froze the oreo crust for about 10 min before I put the fudge on top. It was well liked!

I made the crust but added a stick of butter.  I also made the fudge sauce, perfect and yummy.  Its June and I could not find peppermint ice cream so I had to make my own.  Made the one from this site and turned out great.  Made for a cancer patient to keep his weight up.  During chemo they lose taste, but somehow can taste peppermint!

This was my first ice cream cake and this recipe made it so easy. I took the advice of a few reviewers and added butter to the cookies and I made the cookie layer thicker as my family loves that part. I also doudled the fudge layer and used chocolate chip mint ice cream. I made it into a 2 layer cake. One being ice cream and cookie and the other being chocolate cake and ice cream. I also used a whipped cream frosting recipe from this site as it was for a birthday and I wanted to decorate it. It turned out great!

This pie tasted GREAT! My only complaint was that the Oreo crumbs pretty much stayed in the bottom of the pan. I also made it in two round cake pans, instead of the large pan. I did one with plain vanilla and one with peppermint pieces in between the fudge and ice cream and sprinkled on top. The layer of fudge really makes this - DELICIOUS!

A delicious treat, you can use any flavors you'd like.  My family devoured this for a BBQ party we had.  It's easy to make (a bit messy...lol) I highly recommend this recipe.

Did the night before my son's 11th birthday party but made some changes. I used one box of reduced fat oreos for the crust so it was 1" thick. Yum. I couldn't find chocolate nillas or chocolate grahams which would have been good. I used cookies and cream and 1.5 jars hershey's special recipe fudge sauce. Sprinkled oreos on the top. Everyone loved it and it was very easy and inexpensive. Next time I would use a high end fudge sauce or make a chocolate ganache for the filling to dress it up a bit and also cookies which are less sweet. Other than that, a total winner.

Delish!  Made in springform pan w/ E for her bday. Put oreos all the outside edge. Added butter to crushed oreos for crust. Then a layer of mint choc chip ice cream, then hand crushed oreos, then the homemade fudge (doubled recipe-made way too much-yummy, but could easily buy next time) then vanilla ice cream,  then crushed oreos again. Definitely make again!

I make this frequently as it is requested often.  If I bring it somewhere new I get asked for the recipe.  We have used many different ice creams in this recipe, one of the most popular being salted caramel. It is a fabulous recipe to make a cake for someone and fine tune it to the ice cream of their choice!

This is a favorite. Made this a few times. I use mint choco chip icecream. Also add 1-tbsp of melted butter to the oreo crumbs so they hold together.
