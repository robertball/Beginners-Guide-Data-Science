Spaghetti with butter and parmesean cheese has been a long standing favorite in our house, but this surpasses it by far.  The garlic adds a really nice touch, kind of a slight hint of extra taste in the back ground.  I wouldn't normally use this much butter or cheese when I make this, but I did this time and boy was I surprised how much better it was.  The cheese and butter get gooey and make a sort of sauce.  My daughter and I will have this as a full meal when it is just the two of us, but will also make a great side dish to chicken.  Thanks Paula, you improved on a dish I already loved.

This is very good.  The only thing I did differently was use the butter to saute the garlic before tossing it with the pasta.  I prefer a mellower flavor then you get with raw garlic.  Adding a little bit of white onion to the saute adds a little sweetness, too.  I found this recipe worked well with Parmesan cheese as well.

We really liked this dish, but it is a very good thing that we both ate it - crazy garlic breath!  Coming from two garlic lovers, we found this dish to have way too much garlic in it, 1 tablespoon of minced garlic is plenty.  As well, you could easily reduce the amount of cheese to say...2/3 cup.  We will definitely make this again, but reduce the amount of cheese and garlic.  I made this again, reduced the amount of cheese and garlic - and when I drained the pasta, I left a small amount of pasta water clinging to the noodles, made the sauce even creamier!

This is such a simple yet elegant side dish. I use olive oil instead of butter and some red pepper flakes. I also break up the spagetti into pieces.Just delicious.

a very good dish! Obviously the star of this dish is the romano cheese and that is what caught my eye.  It adds so much flavor to the pasta. If you like the taste of romano cheese this pasta will suit you well. Others may not take to the strong sharpness of this cheese. I slightly undercooked the pasta then set it aside. I reserved a little of the pasta water while I continued preparing this dish. I thought the cooking method of tossing 2T of RAW garlic into the hot pasta would not suit well with me so I chose to sautee it in almost a 1/4 cup of butter, not 1/2 of a cup, along with 2T of olive oil. I added just 1T of minced garlic to the skillet. Once the garlic started to cook in the butter and olive oil, I threw in the pasta, then tossed to coat. I then added 3/4 cup of grated romano cheese and mixed to make sure everythiing was evenly distributed with cheese. I turned off the burner and added a little of the reserved pasta water to wet it slightly and to give just a little creamy "sauce". I topped it off with a little more romano cheese and a sprinkle of fresh, minced italian flat leaf parsely. I loved the sharpness from the romano cheese. It was nicely melted in the pasta. I am glad that I did not add the full amount of 2T raw garlic, as I know it would have been overpowering for me. I would prepare this dish again, only with my modifications. This was served along with, "Ciabatta" bread, from this site as well as a small tossed green salad.

this is a quick and delicious recipe.  I use i can't believe it's not butter fat free spray to be a little more health conscious and it still tastes great.  THanks so much for sharing.

Very good and extremely easy.  The recipe calls for way too much butter.  It can probably be cut by half.

Easy recipe, only concern was the amount of butter in the recipe. Next go round I am going to try chicken stock in the same measurement and see how it tastes. Served this along side Baked Chicken Parmesan which also called for half a stick of butter. A whole stick for two dishes in one meal is not too healthy. Wife had one comment: "Next time you make this, double it. I want left overs!" Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is a blast from my past.  When my Calabrese grandmother used to fix spaghetti like this, I thought that she was too busy to walk down her basement and grab one of the jars of spaghetti sauce that she had canned.  Thanks to you...I know differently...and...am able to duplicate the taste. It was as good as I remembered.

This is a nice start to a good meal but needs a little work. I used 8 oz pasta. This was saturated in butter and oil to the point where it was dripping when I served it. Way way too much butter and cheese. I melted the butter first in a sautee pan and warmed the garlic for a couple of minutes before I added it to the pasta. I sprinkled a bit of parsley for garnish. I suppose this was on the bland side for us as we all added "hot" to our bowls. I added cayenne powder, hubby added crushed red pepper, and son added hot sauce. This was good, but this recipe needs a bit of adjustment. Thanks.

My husband said that I had to review this recipe & let people know how delicious it is. I did change it a little. First thing was that I used 1lb. of pasta. I had 2 turkey/herb sausages in the fridge that I wanted to use. I took the meat out of the casings & sauted it with 4 cloves minced garlic in a little olive oil. A friend gifted us some grape red & yellow tomatoes. I cut those in half & added them to the meat mixture while the pasta cooked. This released the flavor of the tomatoes. I did have to add some of the pasta water to the meat/tomato mixture, to deglaze the pan. I used tongs to add the pasta to the meat mixture. Next, I added 1/2 c. butter (cut in cubes), 1/2 c. olive oil & 1 1/3c. Parmesan cheese. It didn't seem like there was enough sausage but it was just enough to add a little flavor. It's true that it comes out a little gooey but that is good. It's all that wonderful cheese. I would order this an any restaurant! Mmmmm, so good!

GARLIC OVERLOAD! Something must have happened when the "All recipes servings converter" converted the recipe to 12 servings for our family dinner party. It was SO over garlicky that we just threw the whole pot away. Luckily we had something else to whip up for everyone but it was embarrassing to have to say, "Gee, everyone. I am so sorry. It was a 5 star recipe on my recipe site." I'll probably make it again out of curiousity to see if it comes out in the original 2 servings the recipe calls for.

Great fast and easy recipe.  I used this at a "Pasta Bar" luncheon for my extended family,
and they loved it.  The kids just added a red sauce to it, and they gobbled it up!

Great! My husband loves this, and he usually only likes red sauces for his pasta. I didn't have plain Romano cheese, but blended Romano/Parmesan. I also added a pinch of both basil and thyme.

I added chicken to the recipe for more substance. I think next time I'm going to cut down the garlic and cheese AND butter, it was WAY to flavorful. My tastebuds like food lightly seasoned.

Pretty good!  It  comes together easily, but instead of using Romano, I used Parmesan since I had that at home.  I also added some minced garlic.  Definitely will make it again.

I used half butter and half olive oil.  1 tbsp garlic, minced onion, 2 roma tomatoes and chopped black olives.  I also added freshly ground pepper and salt.  We served it with some baked wild salmon and it was delicious.

Delicious...  But even as an indulgence it doesn't need quite so much butter and cheese for this amount of pasta. Used gemelli. Leave a little pasta water in it for the sauce

Amazing! Simple quick recipe, tasted awesome. I added some Parmesan cheese, as well as oregano, rosemary and Italian seasoning, would recommend!

Really quick and easy recipe! :) I baked one chicken breast seasoned with 2tbls lemon and honey and a sprinkle of herbs, salt, and pepper, as a side dish. I also added one whole head of broccoli and a handful of sliced olives. I used mozzarella cheese, and seasoned the pasta with 2 tbls mixed herbs (I cooked for 5 people) and just a tsp of salt. I would recommend 2/3 of the butter amount. Our spaghetti was literally dripping in oil. Though it wasn't bothering me too much, half of my family were complaining it was too oily. Great recipe anyway and I think it would taste great with baked honey lemon salmon too! :D

I served this as a side dish with roasted chicken and a green salad.  Quick, easy and very tasty.  The only change I would suggest is cooking the garlic in the butter first or better yet using roasted garlic instead. 
This recipe could be easily converted to a main dish by adding diced onion, salami or bacon, eggs, and fresh Italian herbs/seasonings.  You might also consider sun dried tomatoes, olives, spinach, or even ham and peas.  The options are endless with this solid recipe as a foundation. VS

This was so good! I didn't have any Romano cheese, so I used Parmesan instead. Also, I added black olives, as well as oregano flakes. It's a perfect, quick, and easy meal.

Delicious! I used non-hydrogenated margarine rather than butter, and needed less than was called for.  The only difference between this recipe and the way I usually prepare garlic-y pasta is that I typically use olive oil (rather than butter).  This was a nice change.  We had this with Oven-Fried Tilapia from this site.  It was a great meal!

This was good, and easy too.  I just think it calls for way too much butter, so I cut it in half.  I accidently used more pasta than called for, so I added about a TBS. of extra virgin olive oil.  I used 2/3 cup cheese, and it was plenty.  I used Trader Joe's organic whole wheat spaghetti.  I liked the fresh garlic flavor in this.  Topped with fresh chopped basil.  Served with Mediterranean Salmon, and it was like having a gourmet meal!

This was simple and delicous. The only changes I made was that I used 1/4 cup of Olive oil and 2TB of butter and added basil and season salt to 1lb of pasta. Will be making this one again.

GOOEY MESS!  Overall, flavor wasn't bad but the Romano turned out disgusting.  DH was working late so I told him to get his dinner on the way home.  Won't try this again.
