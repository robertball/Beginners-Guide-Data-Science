Quick and easy.  I really enjoyed this.  Who thought you could make a pot of chili after getting home from work.  For those of you who like your chili hot and spicy -- you will need to add something.  This is great for the whole family.

Really delicious! I think what surprised me was how much I like the refried beans and how they enhance the consistency of the chili. I used vegetarian beans and diced toms.with garlic and onions. I also added some chopped celery. I also used dried beans since that is what I prefer for texture, and they hold up better in chili than canned. A great, tasty, and quick recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I just made this tonight and turned out great! I used Rotel (canned tomatoes with chilies) instead of regular diced canned tomatoes to give it a little more spice.  Also, I did this in a crockpot instead of stovetop.  I sauteed the garlic, onions and ground turkey (salt, pepper and garlic powder on the turkey before cooking to season it).  I put the rest of the ingredients in the crockpot first and mixed together.  after the turkey is cooked, I added the mixture to the crockpot, mixed and cooked on high for 4 hours (or low for 8 hours).  I also  I left out the Kidney beans (because I do not like them)... and it turned out fine without them.  I also added a can of corn to give it a little color. Great recipe!  My son ate 3 bowls!!

It was delicious.  I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder to give it a bit more kick.  My husband LOVED it and asked me to please keep it in the rotation of meals.

I use a lot of recipes off this site, but I have to say that this is the BEST Chili recipe I have ever used hands down and I am not sure why! It is super easy and super delicious and it makes a GREAT vegetarian chili also!

Excellent chili!  I've been looking for a chili recipe that we liked so I could stop using the seasoning packets from the store (the MSG in the packets gives me headaches) and this is it!  It has great flavor and just enough bite without being too spicy for family members who don't like super spicy foods.  In fact, my fiancee had taken out the Tapatio to put in his bowl, but ended up not even needing it.  I didn't have any refried beans, so I substituted a can of pinto beans in a seasoned sauce (called chili beans).  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  This will definitely be our go-to chili recipe from now on.

Good base. I sauteed onions, salt and 1 green pepper in the oil for 5 min before adding the turkey and a bit more salt.  Added garlic once turkey was cooked. Added beans tomatoes, spices as well as 1 celery stock cut in half, can of corn and can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. Increased stock to 3 cups. Once mixture was boiling, added 1/3 cup of quinoa for an extra hint of flavor and texture. Let this simmer for a good 30 to 40 min.

This was quite good. Eyeballing the recipe I was concerned that there may not be enough heat. So I did the following: for the tomatoes I subbed a regular can (15oz) of diced tomatoes and a can of Rotel. For the kidney beans I subbed a can of spicy chili beans (undrained). No big change but resulted in the perfect amount of heat for my family! Another great chili recipe on this site that uses ground turkey is Fantastic Black Bean Chili (for that one I like to sub two cans of Rotel for the tomatoes and along with a tsp of salt add a tsp of cumin). Different but equally good.

We really love this chili, I've made it several times and it's always a favorite.  Personal preference, I use pinto beans.  Also if I dont have crushed tomatoes, diced works just fine with a can of tomato paste.  I think the refried beans is the clincher, makes it creamier and beanier !!

This recipe turned out great for me..I added some parsley and brown sugar for an extra sweetness..the flavors blend so well together. My husband loved it. As did my sister and I. I made enough for a week plus some. Topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese and this recipe has a quick sweet and spicy kick to it!!

A hit in our family!  I did go off the original recipe slightly: added in some corn and a bit more chili powder for a punch, also used smoked paprika. Used 1 can 10oz of Rotel diced tomatoes with chilis along with 20 oz can diced. I was leery of the refried beans but went for it and was happy with results, helped to thicken it up and great flavor. Will make this again.

Super easy and super delicious! My boyfriend and I ABSOLUTELY love this recipe. I've made it a few times both on the stove and in the crockpot. The ONLY thing I did diffently was add a little cayenne pepper for spice. I brought some to share with friends at work and they loved  it as well! Thank you for sharing this  delicious recipe!

My sister recommended this recipe to me and I was definitely thrilled with the results. I’m not a fan of ground turkey, but need to incorporate it into my diet. I doubled the spices and replaced crush tomatoes with as many ounces in chunky salsa... worked just as well. Absolutely making this again and sending to my other friends.

The only change I made was that I did not have the crushed tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato soup.    I loved how easy it was and that I could make it with what I had in the pantry.  Added it to my favorites.

Great flavor! Great recipe! I made this as is and it was a hit. For those who like a spicy chili you will want to add some red pepper flakes or your favorite spicy pepper or whatever. But for an all around crowd pleaser this chili is yummy! Thank you!

What a great recipe!  Very easy.  Did not make any substitutions, but could see making it a little spicy or next time. I also made brown rice to go with it.  Will have some good lunches or dinners for a few days with this recipe.????

I've never left a recipe review before because I'm what you would call "culinary challenged".  But, I tried this and it was a total success!  Super easy and super delicious!  It irritates me when people post about how great a recipe is, but then make a bunch a changes to it.  The only things I did differently were: I added an entire chopped onion, not just a half.  And I added a 1/2 tsp of Cayenne -  because my husband likes  a little kick.  And I added 2 cans of red beans and omitted the black because I don't care for black beans.  This is definitely a meal you could make quickly after work or throw it a crockpot and let it cook all day on low.

I made this as published, we thought there were too many beans, not enough tomatoes and it was a bit too thick. We did like the balance of spices. Next time I will leave out the can of refried beans and try replacing the red kidney with pinto beans, mashing half the can to thicken it bit as the original recipe intended. I'll add a 2 cup can of tomato sauce as we like plenty of tomato flavor.

This was delicious! I try to follow recipes exactly as written the first time I make them but unfortunately did not have all ingredients on hand for this. The changes I had the make were substituting a bag of Morning Star veggie crumbles for the ground turkey and 1 can diced tomatoes & 1 can Ro-Tel tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes. Will definitely be making this again.

This was my first time making chili with refried beans and I loved the addition of it! Very good, solid chili recipe. Not too spicy for the kids, but enjoyed by the adults. Great chili for adding all your favorite toppings: cilantro, sour cream, cheese, pickled jalapeños.

You are a genius. The refries makes this recipe magical!  Instead of black beans, I used 50% less sodium chili beans. I also added liquid smoke. Also added some hoisin sauce to neutralize the acidity of the crushed tomatoes. Really yummy.

Fabulous! I've made chili with ground beef for years & this was a 1st for ground turkey. The non-fat re fried beans was an excellent idea to help with consistency, additional protein and flavor.

Made it with ground beef since I didn't have ground turkey.  My kids like the black beans much more than kidney beans and the refried beans as a thickener is brilliant.  Kids didn't even know it was there just said it was delicious.  Spice level is nice.  Will definitely make again.
(11/21/18) I've made it several times now with the turkey.  I omit the kidney beans since the kids don't like the texture.  This chili is too liquid at first.  It needs to simmer uncovered more than the 30 minutes until it's the right consistency (according to my husband).  The flavors are wonderful.

Easy and awesome! I used northern white beans rather than black beans, rotel tomatoes as others have suggested. Rather than canned broth I dissolved better than bouillon in hot water prior to adding it to the pot. I also used one pound of ground beef and one pound of turkey since I was doubling the recipe and that's what I had on hand. The chili was amazing!!!

Tasty, but not spicy enough for me. I ended up adding spicy Rotel-like tomatoes, red pepper flakes and more spice in general.

Flavor was great! My husband can't eat hot spicy so this recipe is a keeper. Is desired jalapeños can be added and/or hot pepper flakes for adding the hot flavor. I changed the kidney beans for blackeye peas but just because I don't like the size of kidney beans. The recipe can be followed exactly as it is and it and it is yummy.

I followed the provided recipe but made one addition and one change. I added a few chipotle chilis in adobo and used refried beans with chorizo. Both intended to add a little body and zest to an already good baseline recipe.

I really liked this recipe using chicken broth instead of beef broth.  I used 2 lbs of ground turkey and added a can of chili beans (flavored to be spicy)and my family really liked it.  My daughter in law asked for the recipe she liked it so much!  Definitely a KEEPER!  thanks

First and foremost, I am not a cook.  I was asked to make something for dinner when I found this easy recipe.  I made a huge mistake.  Now it is the most popular request from the entire family and my wife is thrilled.

This was soooo incredibly delicious!!!!

Tiny adjustments: I doubled up the recipe, but had turkey and ground beef in the freezer, so thag is what i used. Also, i didn't want it very spicy so that my little ones like it, so i didn't double up the chilli powder. 

This is my new comfort dish!!! Love it!!

Very quick and easy. It was perfect for a Saturday night when you may not be in a cooking mood after running errands all day! I added some jalapeños for the added kick and flavor.

This was easy and delicious! I upped the amount of spices for more kick. Also, I let it cook all day in the crock pot, but would definitely do it again as a quick meal! When it was time to eat we topped it with our usual cheese, tortilla chips, and sour cream!

Absolutely delicious! Love the refried beans. Very easy to make, my five year old loves to cook and he made it with minimal direction.

I didn't know chili could be this easy to make! I love Zippy's chili from Hawaii, and I've been in search for a recipe that tastes just like it, yet is simple to make.      I think this comes pretty close. I'm so glad I started my search with this recipe.  

I realized too late that I was out of garlic, so I used garlic powder instead.  Other than that,  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for a great chili recipe!

Needs a bit of something sweet. Roasted carrots, sugar, whatever floats your boat, but that dimension is missing and to me, necessary. Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time trying turkey chili and it was quite the success.  Only thing that I did differently was cook it in a crock pot on low all day.  It turned out wonderfully!

I thought this tasted good. The chili powder taste is a little strong. I also didnt find it quite as thick as most chilis. I added extra flavorings with some garlic and onion powdered seasonings. I also used white meat ground turkey. It yielded 6 servings at 375 each when calculated.

If you want chili, but don't have the time to make a traditional chili, than this is the recipe for you. I didn't have the amount of chili powder that was called for, so we added a little bit of cajun seasoning. Other than that, followed the recipe as stated. DH isn't typically a fan of ground turkey, but he liked it in this. It was a good recipe for our cold weather this week.

I like adding zucchini, red pepper and corn. A great, easy chilli that has a thicker consistency thanks too the refried beans.

This was outrageously good with added homemade chili powder (from NM chiles) and cayenne.  Like everyone else, was dubious about the refried beans -- they absolutely made the dish.  The overall flavor is like my favorite  canned chile, which is totally unhealthy.  Had originally thought this would make way more than six servings:  not on a bet!  We had three servings last night, and will have the final three tomorrow night.  Killer recipe, aworley!

Delicious.  Substituted diced tomatoes with green chilies for crushed tomatoes.  Cooked in slow cooker for 4 hours.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it met its claim - EASY turkey chili. The meal was low maintenance, inexpensive, and had plenty of flavor. As is the recipe is pretty simple, but you can easily manipulate it to your liking. I used the pinto beans with the chili sauce instead of refried beans and fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes. Definitely give it a try if your looking for something quick, easy, and delicious!

I love this recipe!  I changed it up a bit. Here is what I did for 6 servings...  I used (Lite Life Smart Ground 12 ounces) Veggie Meat Substitute instead of turkey.  I added 6 peeled and diced carrots.  I used kidney beans instead of black beans.  I used 1 tbsp chili powder instead of 2 1/2 tbsp.  Instead of crushed tomatoes, puree in food processor-1 can 14 oz. Glen Muir Organic diced tomatoes and 2 dried/soaked/seeded pasilla peppers.

I just made this for our company chili cookoff and WON! Everyone raved about it. Super easy to make. I did tweak it a bit. I changed the servings to 15 people and only used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of 5, and I added one large green and red pepper. Out of this world!!

Pretty good.  I used a can of bean medley (kidney beans, romano bean and black eyed peas) and a can of chick peas.  Didn't care for the addition of the chick peas will stick to kidney and black beans.  Also didn't have refried beans.  Added some chopped peppers.  Will try again using the proper beans.  I also added some chipotle chili pepper powder to make it a bit spicier.

This is an awesome meal!  I had to use diced tomatoes and garlic powder instead of crushed tomoatoes and minced garlic.  Still came out awesome. It has more than enough flavor to make up for lack of heat.  My whole family loved this and it will be in the regular dinner rotation.
