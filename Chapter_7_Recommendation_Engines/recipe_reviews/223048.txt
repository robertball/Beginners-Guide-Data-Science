Followed the recipe exactly.  Sauce was quite thin and didn't have much flavor, though I think the cayenne pepper actually saved it.  It was fun trying a different version of the Chicken and Dumplings I usually prepare.  Thanks for the post Chef!

Just finished making this. Followed the recipe and video exactly.  It is SO good and SO easy!  I've never had success with making dumplings until tonight, and it is getting thumbs up from the whole family.  Watch the video, it makes it impossible to mess up!

Awesome recipe! I didn't have creme fraiche so I used sour cream plus I subsituted buttermilk for the milk. To add alittle thickness to the soup base one can of cream of chicken soup really did the trick. The biscuits were so light and fluffy but still had great texture and flavor. 'My family loves alittle heat...so I added a jalapeno cut lengthwise during the cooking process and fished it out before adding the dumplings! Most definetly will make this again!

wow, this recipe was AWESOME!!  i only changed 2 things:  i used fresh rosmary, chopped very finely, in addition to the thyme, and i thickened up the broth a bit more than chef did.  i did use homemade creme freche for the dumplings (leftover from the stroganof)  and be sure to use self-rising flour as chef suggests.  it makes a world of difference.  stew was fantastic, but the dumplings were OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  light, fluffy, yet with a good bite to them, they didnt turn to mush in your mouth.  my very fussy husband, who insists he doesnt like dumplings or "soggy bread"  gobbled these up.  i think it is imperative to use the self-rising flour like chef suggests.....i have made it with, and without (using plain flour, baking powder, etc) and there is a huge difference.  if you are hesitant to buy a bag of self-rising flour just for this recipe, check out chef johns peach cobbler.  really, you cant go wrong with any of his recipes.

My wife loves to make chicken and dumplings, so I thought I'd surprise her with this more advanced recipe.  I was a little disappointed.  IT was very watery with very little flavor.  The dumplings cooked up nice and fluffy, but I think the recipe my wife uses found on the bak of a bisquik box beats this recipe hands down.

Delicious!  For those who thought it a little bland, you may have missed the step "season to taste."  I omitted cayenne pepper to make it a little more kid-friendly, and added kale to the broth with the chicken to make it a one pot meal.  Also, as per the suggestion of another reviewer, I stored the leftover dumplings separately from the soup to preserve the broth & consistency of the dumplings.  The recipe is a little time-consuming, but most home-made comfort food recipes are.  My husband loved it and the kids liked it.  Very good!

Great basic recipe. My changes will include, half prepared chicken stock/half water (not enough flavor for me), more carrot and celery. I used a slightly larger chicken and appreciated the additional meat. Thanks for sharing.

This was SO GOOD! Of course, there was never any doubt that it would be since it was a Chef John recipe. I almost didn't get a picture since my family was hovering around the stove waiting for this to be done like a pack of wild animals. They had been smelling it cooking for almost two hours and couldn't wait.
I personally would have preferred a thicker, stew like consistency, and next time I'll probably try to thicken it a little more. However the flavor was PERFECT. The cayenne pepper gave it such a nice depth of flavor. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent made as recipe states.  If you want to "zip it up"  hit it with some Tony's Louisiana Seasoning.  I think he spells his name Tony Chattere' of something like that.  Dynomite in a bowl!

Adjusted by using 6 chicken leg quarters and a tablespoon of better than chicken bouillon as well as fresh poultry mix herbs. Doubled the carrot, onion and celery. We prefer the flat dumplings so used Mary B's brand which made this easier. Also made a roux in a side pan and slowly added some stock to make sure when added back to the pot it did not have a lumpy texture. Took advice of others and added some extra fresh herbs toward the end. Also threw in some frozen peas. EXCELLENT! I love your recipes, thank you for providing a recipe that is not cream soup based!

I LOVE this soup! This big dumpling was a huge hit. I used chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken which saved time, and the meat was tender. I didn't have any creme fraiche available so used yogurt instead, plus some chicken broth in the dough, and the dumpling was very smooth and flavorful. I will make this again on any time I need warm comfort food!!!

This is a great tasting soup...   it is bland until you add enough of the spices... keep adding until the taste is how you like  it.  Nothing else is needed...I only use a dash of red pepper.    Those that say it is bland are totally correct...  but it needs a lot of salt and pepper...I also added some onion powder cause I had not added enough cut up onion.   Loved it...PS it makes a lot of dumplings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My family did not care for this recipe.  They especially did not care for the dumplings.  I thought it smelled good but it wasn't very flavorful.  I made this EXACTLY as written and I felt it was costly to make. The creme fraiche was $7.00 for a small container but I bought it because the reviews said it really made the recipe.  Sorry but this will not be seen in my kitchen anytime soon.

I loved it! My first time making dumplings and they came out perfect! (I even added 8oz instead of 4oz sour cream/by accident) the only recommendation I have is...before you add the dumplings add 1 can cream of chicken soup & 2 Cups (or more) additional chicken broth & bring back to simmer. After I made mine I had way more dumpling than I did liquid so I took the dumplings off and did just that!

I couldn't remember how my mom made C&D, so I was glad to see the video for this and made it (except only using chicken breasts). Excellent stuff! I use milk or half and half instead of creme fraiche, and I'll vary on seasonings, but if you need a good basic C&D recipe, this one's wonderful! My husband loves homemade dumplings too!

I've made this recipe once as stated and I was disappointed with the results except for the dumplings. I make my chicken soup from a roasted chicken and I make my broth from the bones from the chicken and roast them with some root vegetables.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe, the kids not so much. I think between the thyme in the dumplings and the soup, it was a little too "herby" for them. Next time I think I make half as many dumplings, with less thyme and store them separately as leftover (they absorbed ALL the soup while in the fridge). Very tastey food for people over 10.

I lost all my old tried and true recipes after 40 years of cooking. (long story) I was in search of a great dumpling recipe that was anywhere near my old one led me to Chef John's door. Although it wasn't the same recipe, it sure was good. Fluffy, and tender yet with substance. Just how I like it. I've made it twice. First time with the last of the bag of self rising flour in my pantry and the second time with Chef John's substitute of flour and baking powder and salt. Both were perfect and easy. The only addition I made was dried parsley just because I like the green flecks. I have no made this my standard recipe for dumplings. Oh, and another thing. My husband had oral surgery and can't eat "solid" food. I made a well cooked (almost mushy) vegetable stew and these dumplings. The left overs of dumplings have been substituting for bread for him. Once cooled they can be sliced and eaten easily with a sore mouth. Thank you for this life saver.

I couldn't help myself but to add more to it. I ended up adding green beans, corn, Italian seasoning, and dill. It came out super delicious! My daughter went for a second bowl, which she doesn't normally do. This recipe is a keeper!

Just made it and posted my pic.  Was delicious,  though I did tweak it a bit.  I used all buttermilk in the dumplings and repeated the thickening step 3 more times, as I like mine denser.  Will definitely make it again!

Our family loved this even though I forgot that I did not have self-rising flour - and did not add the baking powder and 1 teaspoon fine table salt, per Chef John's note! My dumplings went to the bottom - and although they tasted good, they were heavy. I will try again with the next time i make this! Also - thanks for the video. Thanks Chef John!

This was excellent.  Did not have Self rising flour so used 2cups AP, 3 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of salt mixed.  They turn out great.  I used more thyme as it was in need to be used which actually made it so wonderful.  This is a great dish to fragrant the house on a cold winter night.  Not to long that you cannot do it on a week night.

This recipe yielded my first dumpling success! With other attempts, they turned out too thick and dense and dare I say brick like.  This time they were so light and fluffy and not to mention super tasty! I made the dumpling portion of this almost exactly as directed expect I could not find creme Fraiche.  However, Chef John did say you could sub it out so I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 heavy cream to equal the 1/2 cup creme fraiche.  As for the soup portion, I was in a hurry so I cheated some and used a rotisserie chicken with store bought chicken stock.  Would have been a good time to have some of Chef John's homemade stock on hand but store bought works in a pinch too.

This was really GOOD!!  I used my old dumpling recipe because I didn't have self-rising flour or creme fraiche but followed the rest of it exactly. Mine was a little "brothy"; might try adding a little more flour next time. Added full 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  Made it a little warm but certainly not too hot!  My daughter ate 3 helpings!!  Will certainly make again!

So delicious! I omitted the celery, carrots, & cream, but did include onions and potatoes (peeled and diced). I used a large container of chicken broth instead of water to add more flavor.  I bought a rotisserie chicken and shredded. I brought the chicken broth, 4 sprigs of fresh thyme, bay leaf, and celery salt and pepper to taste to a boil and then simmered for approx 30 mins. I turned the heat up to medium and added the potatoes 10 mins. Then added the chicken and dumplings. For the dumplings, I used 2 cups of rising flour, 1 cup milk, and 2 eggs (I may omit eggs next time but the dumplings were great!). I rolled out the dough with a rolling pin and used a pizza cutter to cut. The dumplings were done in 10 mins and thickened up the broth nicely. I did not have to add anything special to thick it up since the dumplings did such a great job. My husband loved this one! I’ve made chicken n dumplings several times before and this was by the far the best! Will make again!

Home cooking at its best. First time making homeade chicken and dumplings and husband absolutely loved it he at 2nds. I used bone in chicken thighs 3lbs for ease of not having to cut off all the meat off the whole chicken. The chicken just about fell off the bone. I cooked in chicken broth and not just plain water bc some reviews said it was bland. And I added 1 can of cream of chicken. I served with mix vegetables. Leftovers saved for sure and recipe sent to relatives to make.

I have made this recipe, but I make the dumplings differently, learned from my German grandmother who called them kleutchen (sp?).  For the dumplings, I just beat 2 eggs, add about a cup of flour, a little salt,  and enough milk to make the dough a sticky consistency without being liquid.  Then I drop spoonfuls into the boiling broth.  The magazine states to add less eggs if they fall apart, but the reverse is true.  If there is too much flour and not enough egg, they will fall apart and  you need to add an extra egg.

It was incredible!  I added some frozen peas for color,  You can mix it up with veggies and make it how you prefer.  The small amount of chicken fat roux was a nice flavor touch.  Don't skip that step.

I used leg quarters and seasoned them with salt and pepper.  I seared them skin side down in the dutch oven with some light olive oil.  I then followed the recipe  as written.  It was fabulous even though I didn't have self rising flour.  Thanks Chef John for the quick fix on the flour.

This was delicious! The only slight change I made was to add more fresh herbs (thyme, sage, etc.) and a couple of cloves of garlic. It is more soup like than stew, but that is easily fixed by lessening the water by a couple of cups. Or embracing a chicken soup and dumplings! (if soup is your preference,  add a quartered green pepper - gives taste, but large enough for people to fish out easily if they don't care for it).

Creme fraiche is simply heavy cream and sour cream whisked together - I usually go even amount of each.

This recipe is amazingly delicious and heart warming.  I followed this recipe to a T and was not disappointed.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the hint of thyme in the dumplings put this recipe over the top.  I've learned, time and time again, with Chef John you can never go wrong.

After 20 years of making Chicken & Dumplins (mostly with Bisquick or cut up tortillas) I've finally been able to make good dumplings! My previous attempts always turned out sinking to the bottom of the pot, but was still enjoyed. These dumplings were so easy and delicious!  I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche, but will plan on trying it with the good stuff in the future.

I tried this recipe today. Needed way more flour and fat. I tripled the amount called for, and still way too thin. I would definitely use less water. Flavor was good and dumplings were great.

Followed the recipe exactly.  I did have to heavily season to taste with chicken base and poultry seasoning. I did not like the flavor before I added these. My husband liked this but said he would have liked a thicker liquid like a more traditional chicken and dumplings. Ill make this again but will make the following changes: skinless bone in chicken breast (to reduce the greasiness), add more slurry to make a thicker sauce, add chicken base, poultry seasoning and lots of cracked black pepper.  Ill also make the dumplings separately since I wasnt a fan of how soggy the bottoms were from simmering in the liquid. Lastly add more seasoning, salt in particular to the dumpling mixture. As is this is  great base recipe.

I must admit the cooking of a whole chicken and then removing the meat was very daunting to me but I overcame my fear . Overall this recipe turned out to be a comforting delicious bowl of goodness. Tasted like good home cooked chicken soup with great dumplings.The biscuit dumplings were the biggest I've ever seen and one was plenty. I didn't have enough time to make the creme fraich (poor planning on my part) but as chef John explained sour cream worked just fine. Next time will try the creme fraich. Still was a great recipe.

Made it as directed, except one thing - replaced the water with low sodium organic chicken stock, and halved the quantity as I prefer a stew consistency rather than soupy. Flavour was fantastic, and my hubby who was really apprehensive about the dumplings and the taste overall loved it. We all enjoyed the leftovers. Note - if you do not have self rising flour (I did not) it's easy to mix the flour with baking soda and salt, just make sure you measure the flour AFTER you have sifted it, otherwise you can easily get too much flour and ruin the recipe. I now try Chef John's recipes before anything else... and love his blog, he has lots more recipes as well as videos and techniques. (Only had one fail with a recipe of his and I should have known based on the ingredients that it was not for us.)

My family said these are the best homemade dumplings I have made!  I used all chicken thighs, boneless and skinless, so I didn't simmer the whole hour, maybe half the time.  Thanks again Chef John!!

The first time I have made chicken and dumplings and this was a great guide. I added garlic when I was making the stock also used corn starch as the thicking agent instead of flour. Definitely will be made again my family really enjoyed the flavors.

Everyone liked. Took about 1-1/2 hours to make (chicken needed to boil for 1 hour). But very tasty and better than package biscuits.

I was looking for a chicken & dumpling recipe to make for my mom's 92nd birthday.   It had been years  since I last made it.  I trusted Chef Johns version because it looked to be closest to what I remember. I have made a few recipes from Chef John and each one turned out wonderful. 
 We all  loved it, so I'll save this recipe for next time.  A cozy comfort dish!

Made it last night. All gone today. It is light and simple and dumplings are awesome. Next time i would cut the dough by half though, because i was left with half of the dough unused.
 A keeper. Thank you, chef!

Made this a super long time ago and don't remember the criticisms, will update my review when I make it again, but this is definitely the best chicken and dumplings recipe! I made my soup thicker due to my preference  but followed everything else exactly. The dumplings especially are just so wonderful, we love the airy texture!

There is way too much water in this recipe. Two tablespoons of flour is never going to thicken 10 cups of water. This is more like chicken soup than chicken and dumplings. Maybe the recipe ingredients are posted incorrectly. If you choose to make this cut the water back to 5 cups and make sure you add enough salt to season. The dumplings are okay but to be honest I would pass on making this recipe again.

I added an additional tablespoon of ap flour to the slurry for a touch of extra body. Used mostly chicken stock (some water) to stew chicken. I think that this added some needed flavor to the soup. All else as written and demonstrated by chef John. Most excellent recipe, awesome comfort food.

Loved this recipe.  After reading from many reviewers that the 'soup' was a bit thin, I peeled 3 potatoes and added them with the rest of the ingredients to the pot.  After simmering for over an hour, the potatoes pretty much fell apart and helped to thicken the soup.  It was still a bit soupy and I wasn't sure my crowd would approve.  It needed to be more creamy or cloudy so I added a large can of cream of chicken.  The dumplings turned out great.  So airy.  I was concerned that the dumplings were going to stick together because I had to crowd them into the pot (I had upped the servings to 6).  They didn't stick together at all.

My kids and husband loved it- it was perfect for them coming in from the snow. I didn't have creme fraiche so i substituted sour cream, as he suggested in the video. it worked fine, although I'd like to try it again with the original ingredients. My dumplings were a little dense- not quite as airy as his looked.

Such a simple recipe. Reminds me of matzoh ball soup. You can shave an hour off the cook time by using the instant pot (just use the stew button)

The first time I've made chicken and dumplings, The Chicken soup was really good! I added more chicken stock than water because I used a couple of chicken breasts, more celery, onions, added some rosemary and hot pepper flakes to make it a little spicie. It actually needed more stock, which I added to leftovers. The recipe called for too many dumplings. I shouldn't have added all of them, they were doughy. Next time I'll do what another person did and use bisquick and use half what this recipe calls for.

Alter the recipe. Of course, as bricolage is always a necessary part of a cook’s repertoire. Add the leafy tops of the carrots and celery.

Recipe was easy to follow. I’ll try again and think it will turn out better next time! Sauce was more like a soup. Think maybe more of the flour and chicken fat mixture would have been good. Also thinking use of chicken broth instead of water would make it more flavorful. Finally, the video discussed a 4 quart Dutch oven, mine is a little bigger, I used almost half of the water called for and the pot was still too small when I added the dumplings.

It was ok.  Was sort of flavor less.  The dumplings were good but that was about it.  Disappointed because I really like some of the other Chef John recipes.

I generally like Chef John’s recipes. I really wanted to like this. The stock produced as written is very weak and watery. We added two tsps Better than Bullion  to address that. It needs salt (it’s a pet peeve for me, when there’s not at least a ball park estimate of salt, but that’s an issue in a lot of recipes). Even with the BtB the stock was a little bland. Worse than that though... I’ve tried this twice, and it’s the dumplings that are the real issue... they simply dissolve! So once they are added I wound up with sludge... :( I’ve made other chicken and dumpling recipes - that didn’t happen with other recipes. I won’t be trying this again :(

I used chicken bone broth instead of water to up the flavor and added about 5 times the amount of carrots and celery to the mix. Otherwise, it's a fantastic fall/winter recipe that we've made several times!

This is a great recipe that we’ve made several times. It’s easy enough that my 15 year old wants to make it. It’s a thinner consistency but you can easily thicken it, if that’s your preference. Which we have done on colder days, for a heartier meal. For those complaining about “lack of flavor”, I hate to say it, but that’s their own fault. The recipe says season to taste with salt and pepper. It will be bland if not properly seasoned, just like homemade chicken noodle soup does. You can also add a bit of chicken base; I like the Better Than Bouillon in a jar when I’m short on time or needing a bit more stock, etc.

This is a recipe my family loves.  It has a better flavor if you follow the recipe, but on busy weeknights I often use chicken breasts and thighs and chicken stock so I don't have the hassle of cooking & stripping the whole chicken.  I can scoop out a couple of servings for my husband before adding the salt and dumplings so he can have a lower sodium version.  A perfect tummy warming, dish for chilly nights. Easy to double it for when the kids's friends are staying  for dinner too.

I had already made soup, and needed a dumpling recipe.  Since Chef John is a sure bet, I followed exactly.  My comment to my wife after taking my first bite......... 'OMG - I have outdone my own mother' - sacrilegious to even think that, but - best dumplings on the planet!

This was delicious. I made it as written except I added a little extra flour to thicken it a bit more as I wanted it less soupy. I couldn't find the creme fraiche so I used sour cream like Chef John mentioned in the video of this recipe. And because I'm a saltaholic, I added some chicken base for a bit more flavor.
This was pretty simple to make and I will be using this as my go -to chicken and dumplings recipe.

I made this to use up some boneless chicken thighs I had.  It was a bit flavourless compared to the sound of other reviewers' results.  I think the bones are important in flavouring.  Also, I couldn't get fresh thyme, so I used dry, and I know my calculation of the amount I needed was poor.  I'd try it again only if I have the correct ingredients.

Chef John does it again!!!!!
I knocked this one out of the ball park!

The dumplings were plump and moist and the broth
Was rich and full of flavor.
I followed the Recipe to the letter with one exception 
I oven roasted my carrots before adding them to the pot.
I think the roasted veggie gave the broth a deeper flavor.

After all...

I AM THE COLONEL OF MY CHICKEN RECIPE.

Thanks Chef John..

You have made me a rock star in the kitchen!!!

Look forward to making all of your Recipes 
Especially during the upcoming holidays 

BIG FAN!!!!

Excellent recipe!  I added some chicken base to the water to stew the chicken. Also, no cayenne pepper as  someone in my household can't take any heat at all.  I didn't have any thyme, so I added a little poultry seasoning to the dumplings.  The next time i make this, I definitely will have some on hand.  The dumplings came out light and fluffy.  I am very pleased with them. It's the first time I have made dumplings that were edible.  I added 4 tbsps of flour to thicken the broth, but it still wasn't thick enough for us.  I will up that amount the next time I make this.  All in all a great recipe!

Don’t expect the cooked chicken broth to be flavorable without seasoning. I added several chicken bullion, a splash of lemon juice for brightness, a dash of seasoning salt, pepper, and some celery salt. Feel free to experiment  or add your go-tos when making your version. I did add less onion, more carrots and celery as a personal preference.

I screwed up the first batch of dumpling dough, so I tossed it and tried again, I’m glad I did as the dumplings turned out fantastic, albeit a bit on the large size.

I make a lot of broth based soups, and this one is definitely a keeper. It was so tasty and filling! I stored the dumpling separate from the soup. We’re looking forward to leftovers!

I almost never write a review but this recipe calls for one.  It was such a disappointment.  I’ve made this dish for many years but thought I’d give this one a try as the dumplings sounded good.  The soup was fine and I seasoned it well though it was lacking in consistency.  The dumplings were sadly missing both flavor and density.  I wouldn’t normally recommend prepackaged biscuits or Bisquick, but in this recipe you’ll come out with a hearty delicious dumpling if you use one of these instead.  This dish is meant to be comfort food and as the recipe stands it just wasn’t very satisfying.

First time making this and it was delicious! Family and neighbors all raved about how good it was.
Used sour cream instead of creme fraiche. 

Don't worry if your dollops of dumpling dough is uneven it will all rise and fill up the pot, very forgiving.

Next time I will use 2 stalks of celery and 2 carrots.

When I made this, both my spouse and I had the flu.  This stuff really hit the spot!  Talk about comfort food.  If someone at your house is sick, make up a batch of this right away.  The soup is delicious even just on its own, but when you add the dumplings it becomes fantastic.  

I modified the recipe just a tiny bit.  I left out the cayenne pepper (sorry :).  My thyme plant is still small, so I only had enough fresh sprigs for the chicken soup part of the recipe.  I used 1/2 tsp of dried thyme in the dumplings, instead of the fresh thyme.  I also used 1/2 cup of homemade yogurt instead of the creme fraiche called for in the recipe.  The yogurt made my dumpling batter pretty loose, so they blobbed together while cooking, but nobody at my house cared - they were delicious.  I also microwaved the chicken fat/flour mixture for about two minutes, until it was browned and smelled nutty & the flour was cooked before stirring it in to thicken the soup.

I have never made chicken and dumplings because I always thought it was a very bland dish.  I have changed my mind. This is awesome and incredibly flavorful.  I followed the recipe for the most part except I added 2 tablespoons of chicken base (because I always do that when I boil chicken)and I used tarragon in my dumplings because I like it better than thyme. I will be making this again and again. I love Chef John's recipes.

Start the dumplings as soon as the water is hot too make sure they are cooked through. Turn dumplings over cook evenly.

This is a good base starter for a C&D recipe. I made allot of changes though. 
My Mother made this and when she did, it didn’t last long. I’ve tried to replicate her dumplings but I just haven’t hit on a recipe that even comes close, ... yet !
Chef John got me started and I’m glad bc I vaguely remember what Mom did. Thanks John ! 
Here’s what happened and what I did and what I’ll change next time around. 
The soup came out fabulous but I had to tweak it quite a bit to get to the flavor and consistency that I liked and that I remember from Mom’s recipe.
 I like my soup a bit thicker so I repeated the rue a few times over but careful not to over do it. 
I seasoned while cooking and after. S&P, 2 Bay Leaf, Italian Seasoning, Parsley, Cayenne, 6 whole garlic cloves. 
Splash or two of Chardonnay. 
I used 2 of each carrots and celery and half a sweet onion. In the end I threw in some frozen peas.
The end product was awesome but here’s where it went south. 
At the dumpling phase all went well. They fluffed up very nicely but there were 2 problems that made the end product disappointing.
The dumplings soaked up all the luscious juices which left no juice just dumplings and chicken and vegetables. All that work getting the taste just right soaked up. The other was the dumplings were so awfully bland and too fluffy for my liking. And I noticed Chef John added no salt to the SRF, which I thought was odd. They definitely needed salt. 
I like a more spongy savory dumpling. The kind my Mot

I used this recipe as a base, so I will give it 5 stars based on that. I changed it to suit our tastes. I just love Chef John's recipes, and this one was great for a first timer!

This was the dumpling recipe I have been searching for! The dumplings are silky, not "biscuity".  I added more of the veggies and substituted parsley for the thyme and bay leaf. I also added some garlic powder. It was fantastic! 
No thickening needed in my book. Thanks Chef John!

This was the first time I made homemade chicken and dumplings from scratch. I followed the recipe except used sour cream instead, added seasonings such as garlic, salt, pepper and little bit of cayenne pepper. I did add two cans of cream of chicken soup to thicken it up because hubby doesn’t like it so thin. This was amazing! Tasted so good we couldn’t stop eating it!

The dumplings were perfect. The presentation of this super was fantastic, but I did not like the texture or taste of dumplings. Maybe it was me, but I prefer noodles in my soup.

I am sorry Chef John.  I typically love your recipes, but not this time.  I followed the recipe and watched the video, but found the chicken boring, even with the spices, the broth watery, even though I nearly tripled the flour, and the dumplings heavy, dense, and tasteless.  I feel a need to return to the red and white checkerboard on this one, but I'm still a fan and follower.

Great recipe! Dumplings came out nice and light. Only thing  different I did was to add a bit of chicken bullion (I always use Better than Bullion) to the broth, as it needed to be more "chickeny" and salty so that took care of both. Thanks again Chef John!

The 2 changes I made was using sour cream in the dumplings instead, and I used more flour to thicken the broth so it'd be more creamy.  The flavor, using the herbs called for, is excellent.  This is 1 of the best recipes I've found where it's made from scratch.

5 stars all the way.  What a tasty recipe.  Followed the recipe almost exactly. I think I added more celery and carrots. Next time I will decrease the dumpling mixture because it made too much and I couldn't fit it all in my pot.  Also I didn't have self rising flour so followed the recipe for using regular flour and it was great that way. Will certainly make this again. Thanks Chef John. EDIT: had the leftovers the next day. Added a little chicken broth because it was too dry. If possible the leftovers were even better than the original day. Even my husband and son said this is a great recipe.

This would get 6 stars if available! As my mother used to make this, and a potato leek soup that had dumplings too, and no one paid attention to how she made dumplings, and we thought it was lost forever! Although she did her's a touch different, and they were even better tasting than these, it gave me enough of a start to do ones like hers, which I've shared w/family, who now are so happy!
Tip #1, add some white pepper to this dish, it takes any chicken dish over the top, and do NOT skip the cayenne! It gives the extra healing and taste to the dish! Tip #2, reduce the amount of thyme, and use rosemary instead as a alternative..try it, you will LOVE it!

I  I absolutely love this recipe I made three changes I added only half of the Cayanne pepper and  used sour cream instead of crème fraîche and I add chicken base  LB Jamison's is my favorite and this gives the stock much more flavor about 2 tablespoons will do it add to taste. maybe use three enjoy. Yum Yum Yum!

This is a great basic recipe, and my family loved it! Super comfort food. I used a very large chicken breast instead of a whole chicken, as that is what I had on hand. The seasonings were perfect for the soup. I used snipped chives and dill for my dumplings, as they were bountiful in my garden. Delicious dumplings; I like the egg in them.

This is so good. I doubled the vegetables and used 5 chicken legs with 2 1/2 quarts of water to start making the soup. I added 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper, then it came out tasty. I substitute sour cream for creme fraiche too. Dumplings were so fluffy. It was easier to make than I thought.

I watched the video, then substituted sour cream for creme fraish, (however you spell that) 'cause Chef John said so.  I also made that chicken stew like I always do, with frozen little vegetable mix and chicken broth, lots of powdered garlic and onions and dried thyme.  Th I s time I used chicken breast because that's what we had.  It was Awesome!  I will always use this one from now on if I can.

Very good overall recipe. Way too much thyme in the dumplings. I'd recommend half the time and adding some salt to the dumplings themselves. Could not find the creme fraiche so just replaced that and the milk with a cup of milk. I think I'll add a bit of garlic next time as well. Added some paprika to the stock as well. This recipe is a good starting point.

I wanted to make this dish for the base (my other half doesn't care for dumplings)...because, of course, Chef John NEVER disappoints!  I took the advice of some of the other reviews and added a bit more seasoning, since I was using this as more of "chicken and rice" dish.  I added a dash of poultry seasoning, garlic powder, dry parsley, dried cilantro, (and of course, cayenne, salt, and black pepper).  Turned out INCREDIBLE.  Thanks again, Chef John!!

Made with thighs instead of a whole fryer. 
Use a teaspoon to measure out the dumplings. Unless you like them really large.

I must have done something wrong because mine was deliciously thick.  These flavors were  super good. I did add a lot of salt.  I used 1/4 tsp of cayenne and I really felt the heat in the back of my throat.  I've been fighting a cold so I am sure my throats is raw and the cayenne attacked. My kids liked the subtle heat. I'd make this again and again.

I gave this 4 stars because I modified it significantly, but it was a good starting point for a wonderful meal. I cut the water BY HALF (seriously), subbed half of that as chicken stock, added 2 T. of butter to the dumplings, made my own self-rising flour, and used sour cream instead of creme fraiche. It turned out great! The dumplings, my God, the dumplings!  YUM!!!

I have had to edit my review multiple times, because my first bowl of this wasn't very good. The key to this recipe is MAKE IT A DAY OR TWO IN ADVANCE! This was my first time to make chicken and dumplings. I followed the recipe with no substitutions. Be sure to use enough salt. The dumplings had a nice consistency.  My husband (eating his first bowl the second day) really enjoyed it. I ate the last bowl of it, and it was SO much better than the first bowl!

So goood :) Pressure Cooker users I HOPE this helps:
In my Instant Pot I first Pressure cooked a whole 5 lb+ Organic Chicken (only because I could not find a 3-3 1/2 lb whole chicken)(no 3 lb. Chicken bothered me a bit. Makes you wonder why even "organic" they still are ALL over 5 lbs... even with no growth hormones, etc.. hmmm...)
 Okay….Review...
Pressed "ON" the "Meat/Stew" button LOWERED to 25 minutes, then I allowed it to NATURALLY RELEASE the pressure for another 20+ min(found a youtube vid on HOW TO DO A WHOLE CHICKEN IN THE INSTANT POT) 
    THEN I added my veggies AFTER the chicken cooked because I didn't want them mushy. Also I used 32 oz. of Chicken Broth in place of the water because others thought it was bland. I followed the recipe except these steps….and the spices. I really love good spices. I can handle spicey too.. but my other family members don't so I kept them in mind. I used 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper, and this was not to spicy for anyone. Sadly I had no Thyme (which I couldn't believe) but I had poultry seasonings, Bay leaves, Rosemary, Sage, Tarragon, Cracked Pepper blend, Celtic Sea Salt. I added approx. 2 tsp. each to the chicken when I started pressure cooking it. 

For the buscuits:
I could not find SELF RISING FLOUR anywhere so Per Chef John I sifted 2 C. Flour, 2tsp. Baking Powder, 1 tsp salt(I had only course Celtic sea salt so I fine grinded 1 tsp in a personal blender cup). I separated the dry and the wet (used org. Plain yogurt in place of Cr

I made this.  It was delicious.  Only thing I did different was add a little chicken soup base to the water when boiling the chicken to make the stock.   Then left out the salt when seasoning to taste.  Everything else the same tho.  SO GOIOD!!!!  Will definitely make this again. My first time ever using creme fraishe.  And self rising flour.    Did not disappoint!

A new New Years Day favorite!!! Gosh, this is so good! I did almost double the fat/flour mix to thicken it and also cut the eggs to just 1 for the dumplings (b/c we like dumplings that stand up to the sauce and in leftovers), but this dish is something special and one we will ever forget. I did my research and so glad this recipe is the one I chose!

I made this on a snowy cold day and we LOVED it!  I took the chicken out then added a few of the bones back into the broth to strengthen the flavor notes of the broth.  I let the bones simmer in the broth for another 1.5 hours.  I removed the bones and then added the chicken meat and followed the directions as stated.  I did add a shake of red pepper flakes and about 1/2 - 3/4 lightly oaked Chardonnay before making the dumplings.  The dumplings were amazing!  I am dairy sensitive, so I used a non-dairy sour cream and rice milk instead and they turned out perfectly.  My family firmly stated to make this again.

This was excellent, and I'm not a dumpling fan.  I did make a few tweaks.  I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche; I just added a bit of cream to the milk to increase the fat.  Also, I added a bit of chicken base to my stock, as well as ~ 1/4 cup of cream for a richer flavor.  Since I didn't have a whole chicken on hand, I used 4 legs and a couple breasts instead.  Everything else I did as the recipe called for.  Most excellent!  Definitely a winner in my book!

Had some left over BBQ chicken so I added some chicken base to stock, did not have celery so added a can of peas just before the dumplings. Made  the dumplings with sour cream (was using what I had on hand), these dumplings are FANTISTIC, will not make them any other way again.

I hate to give this a less than average rating.  This recipe just is very bland.  I do think the liquid mixture needs more veggies, and needs to be at least a 50/50 mix of water and chicken broth, instead of all water.  Also the dumplings were just so-so and very bland.  At the end of cooking I had to add a bit more seasonings and some milk to get it the nice creamy consistency that we like.  Overall, it was a nice start to a good base recipe, but needed additional ingredients to make it how we like it.  I do love all of Chef Johns other recipes.  So thank you for the recipes!!

Followed the recipe pretty much 100% except didn't have fresh thyme but used Herbes de Provence.  Seasoning wise, it was lovely, but I found the broth to be rather watery.  I did sub sour cream for the creme fraiche, which worked beautifully! The dumplings are great, the chicken cooked perfectly.

This is a good recipe.   Husband would give it a 5+.   I added more water at the beginning and therein was my problem.   My roaster was pretty large so it could have probably cooked longer than the hour so the broth would've been more flavourful, but I was pressed for time and stuck with the recipe.   I had some frozen roasted chicken juice  which I added and still I had to add a couple of  bullion cubes before adding the dumpling dough to the broth.  I found the dumplings too delicate so too "wet" on account of them breaking up easily.   If you enjoy super light dumplings, then this is the recipe for you.  However, the next time I make this (and I will) I'll just use my grandmother's dumpling recipe which is a heavier/denser dumpling (made with shortening and milk).  Just personal preference.

Love this recipe. Used sour cream since I couldn't find creme fraiche at the store. Also added chicken soup base to broth for extra flavor and added some chopped kale, for extra veggies per other review. It could have used more broth, but was still delicious.

To me it was not real chicken and dumplings.   This is chicken with biscuits on top which is ok if that is what your going for.   Soup was fine, but not the dumplings.  I prefer a dumpling that is able to hold up to dropping into the broth and swimming around, not just on top of everything.  This does not reheat well to me.

Followed directions and this recipe is the best I have ever had!! If you like spice you can add in a diced Serrano pepper to the stock for some heat, other than that this is perfection on a cold day. Thanks John

Instant family favorite. I never liked dumplings until I tried these. Going for a thicker gravy I started making more roux to thicken it up. But then the dumplings were harder to cook, you really need a rolling boil to cook the dumplings. To solve that problem I now add the roux at the end.

The soup and chicken broth had great flavor! Use a small dice on the carrot and on the 1-1/2 ribs of celery. I used one bunch of green onions (@ 5-6 whole green onions), slicing both the white & @ 2" of the greens of the onions, slicing @ 1/4" thick. Also used 4 large garlic cloves, cut in half. Cook 4-6 chicken thighs, or 1 whole chicken. Skim the fat & remove the garlic & thyme stems. Cook alphabet or little star pasta when you add the cooked chicken back. Bring to a "light boil" for  15 minutes. Note:  If you make these dumplings or any other dumplings, BE SURE TO KEEP THE LID ON THE WHOLE 15 MINUTES, no peeking! AND... SIMMER THE DUMPLINGS for 15 minutes, DO NOT BOIL THEM or they will fall apart!

It was flat tasting and therefore  I added  a tablespoon of chicken base and added the cayenne like the recipe says....Big mistake! Should have left out the cayenne it made it too hot or was it from the chicken base or thyme? Not sure..Dumplings were not what I expected.

Followed the recipe. Very easy to make. It was okay but nothing special. It's chicken soup with dumplings. The dumplings were rubbery and sat on the stomach like a rock. The Bisquick recipe is much better. The herbs/spices called for just make it bland no matter how much you add. I used Bonne Herbes and california Pepper from Penzey's instead. Thickening up the soup helped. Will not be making this particular recipe again. Thank you.

We thought the recipe was wonderful and we liked the thinner broth, so more of a soup for us. I did add a little extra carrot and celery as we like those veggies. The dumplings turned out great !

Very good!  I'd never had nor made Chicken and Dumplings before but my husband was very anxious for me to make this.  Really just chicken soup I guess.  I must say though, I do not make American dumplings...I just don't care for the taste of them.  I made English ones with Suet and flour so I can't rate the dumpling portion but may try making them Chef John's way next time, because I notice they don't include baking powder or soda or whichever it is that make American dumplings taste the way they do!

Absolutely loved the texture of the dumplings. I added quite a bit of roux to give the base some body; I'm not a fan of dumplings on soup. This was the first chicken and dumpling (or dumplings of any kind) that my daughter had tried and she fell in love with them. I had no idea how much of anything to put in because I only watched the video and it came out great anyway. I used sour cream instead of creme-whatever and it worked just fine. I also added a small can of cream of chicken soup which added flavor and a bit of thickness. For those that think there isn't enough flavor; you know you can fix that, right? I'll be making this again real soon and making my own variations on the base.

I think this is absolutely delicious. I have made it twice. The first time was a disaster because I replaced the cream in the dumplings with sour cream and some flour. I had been to three grocery stores and couldn't find the one listed in the recipe. I had read that subbing crème fresh for sour cream was fine so I thought lets go backward. Ick. It turned into a mushy cottage cheese mess spread all over the yummy chicken. Almost inedible. The mixture the first time was so much soup that the second time I cut the liquids in half. Still a bit too much liquid for me. The first time I made it I had used homemade broth. The second time, I used canned broth and added a tablespoon of better than chicken bouillon. I cut up about 6 carrots each time. I used a simple recipe for dumplings that I had for the second time. I also don't buy whole chickens. The first time I put in a combination of thighs and breasts with bones in. The second time, I had boneless breasts so that's what I used. It worked just as well.

First time boiling a whole chicken. It was fun! This dish is delicious and will stay in my recipe box forever.
