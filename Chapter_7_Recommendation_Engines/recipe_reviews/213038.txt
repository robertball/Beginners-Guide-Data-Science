This was delicious. I made about 12 ounces of pesto using cilantro and almonds with olive oil and salt, plus I also used cream cheese in place of goat cheese and then followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out amazing. Was amazed I actually made something so good. Thank you so much for this great one. I'll be making it a pretty often now!

This was awesome!  I made the vegetables one day and then ate the wraps for lunch throughout the week- something delicious to look forward to every afternoon!

I followed the directions the first time I made it, and the veggies ended up being mushy (peppers were still kind of crunchy).  The second time, I cooked the peppers for 2 minutes, added the onion and cooked another 2 minutes, then added the eggplant and mushrooms for 5-7 minutes.  Textures were perfect!  I also added chicken which I had marinaded in balsamic vinegar with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder.  
We used Feta cheese instead of goat cheese - it was a hit!

Not too shabby!  I did not add red onion or red pepper because I didn't have them on hand.  I did add green pepper, basil and sun dried tomatoes and they were a nice addition.

Oh my goodness...this was SO good! I actually made it as written except I used white tortillas instead of wheat. The melding of the veggie flavors is amazing! I think the ingredient that ties it all together so perfectly is the goat cheese. In my family, half like pesto and the other half of us do not. But all of us loved these wraps and agreed that they are a dish you would see in a nice restaurant. I will definitely make these again!

Really tasty!  I did not have all the veges from the recipe, but was great with what I had on hand (eggplant, yellow squash, onion, spinich) and sour cream instead of goat cheese.

I thought this was very tasty, as did my vegetarian daughter.  Hubby and other daughter were not pleased with this - they missed the meat here when ordinarily that isn't the case and they eat vegetarian meals happily.  Maybe next time I will add some chicken to theirs to make everyone happy.  I was pleased that the chopping and slicing was much easier than I had envisioned it being.  The pesto and the goat cheese also gave it a great texture and flavor.

Good recipe.  I sweated the eggplant and let the vegetables marinade for about an hour before grilling.  I also marinaded and grilled a small amount of chicken as well for some more flavor.   I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese because that is what I had and it went really well.

This is very good, I love all the veggies. I added a little balsamic vinegar to the oil, salt and pepper before sauteing them. I had some leftover Grecian Pork Tenderloin, and it worked really well with this wrap as well.

During assembly, I added roasted red peppers, fresh spinach and balsamic glaze. DELICIOUS. It took me 15 minutes to make and 3 minutes to destroy. I have tons of filling left over to feed me for the rest of the week.

YUM! I stumbled upon this recipe when looking for something that would use my ripening avocado and the remaining goat cheese from last night's Chicken Bryan. Perfect! The author is right - this is a great recipe from which to springboard using what you have on hand.  In my case, I made my own pesto (we prefer walnuts to pine nuts), and, since I already had the food processor going, I then added the goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes and avocado.  This made it easy to spread onto the wraps.  I sauteed onions, a red bell pepper and sliced chicken breast in olive oil and garlic, layered the mixture onto the wrap, added fresh spinach and -ta da! - rave reviews from the family!

Love these! I add sundried tomato and have substituted cream cheese when that is what I have. They are great still warm or cold. Easily packed up for Shakespeare festival under the stars with a bottle of wine!!! These are the best. Thanks for the recipe!

This is SO delicious!! I used farmer's cheese instead of goat cause goat cheese was just too expensive but we loved this and am going to make it again. I'm going to try it by mixing the cheese, pesto, avocado and veggies with bow tie pasta next time. I bet it will be just as good :-) Can't wait to plant the garden so I can start picking the eggplant and zucchini for this...lol

So yummy! I used cream cheese instead and it was great! Makes more than 4 servings in my opinion though.

Very good! I changed the recipe slightly. I added the goat cheese and pesto to the warm cooked veggies and then loaded it onto the wraps.  My husband who usually needs to have meat at every meal loved this and asked for seconds. Will make again..

I followed this recipe almost to the t and it was fantastic.  It's easy and has a ton of flavor.  Be sure to have the pesto too otherwise it might be a little lacking.

Easy and good tasting.  By accident forgot I prepped it and had it the day after.  Roasted rather than grilled because grill wasn't up to par - still turned out good.  Quick easy veggie meal.  The avocado threw me a little but it added some full feeling fat to the meal.

I didn't like the idea of pre-made basil pesto on something I worked really hard on. I didn't have goat cheese at hand, so I used french vanilla yogurt as my base and this thing called Magic Sauce splattered on top. I can't even explain to you how perfect it was. I was licking my fingers for an hour afterwards, thanks a trillion. Best dish of the night by far.

This was a great idea - I made some homemade tortillas and used leftover ratatouille veggies with the avocado and pesto.  Instead of goat cheese, I opted for some Greek yogurt, which I had on hand.  Delicious and quick!

I loved this!  Made it as a lettuce wrap. Couldn't find good avacados so used guacamole instead.
