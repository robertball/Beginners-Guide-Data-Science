Good method, but needed additional seasoning. I added a bit of beef soup base to the gravy mixture, but next time I would add sautéed mushrooms and/or onions and garlic.

4-19-2017  ~Pretty decent comfort food but a little flat as is.  I added shallots and fresh mushrooms, and extra seasoning of Montreal Steak Seasoning, Worcestershire sauce, and more pepper.  Also, instead of simply setting the sautéed steaks aside under tented foil while completing the recipe, I put them in a shallow baking dish with a little water, covered it and baked it at 350 degrees, maybe for half an hour, to ensure the steaks were tender. Rather than discarding the remaining juices once it came out of the oven I added it to the gravy, which contributed additional beefy flavor.  In addition to being a little on the nondescript side, the gravy is very rich – perhaps this might be better using equal parts beef broth and milk.

I used just flour instead of cornstarch, and instead of  milk, used one cup of beef bullion.  Added sauteed fresh mushrooms, turned out delicious!

I have been looking for a good cube steak recipe and my family loves this one.  Also works well with cubed pork.  Lately I have been cutting the meat into strips, which my family loves and is great for kids.  I floured too much and threw the extra into the freezer.  A couple weeks later I thawed it, dipped in milk then more flour and had an even crunchier crust.  My family fell in love with this new process.  FYI NEVER use oil to fry these.  Always use plenty of butter and not too hot.

Oh my gosh this recipe is so amazing! I have never made cube steak before, and it turned out delicious! Glad I found this recipe because we have a lot of it since we bought half a steer. My whole family loved it even my picky autistic kid. He licked his plate and asked for more!! Definitely a make again!

I made this as the recipe indicated however I did saute some onions first then set them aside before frying the steak. I added the onions to the gravy as it was cooking. I did make a little extra gravy as we like ours extra saucy. This turned out very well and my family really enjoyed the meal.

I made it according to directions but I had to omit dairy and gluten. I used GF all purpose flour from ALDI's. I used corn oil to fry it in.  I used homemade chicken broth in place of the milk...I took some  gravy out for myself and then I added a little more milk to  make it a creamy gravy  for my family. Both gravies turned out great! The steak was tender and delicious and my family loved it. We'll put this on rotation at our house! THANKS!!!

WONDERFUL! I made this for dinner and my 17 yr old boy doesn't "do gravy" but he had this and LOVED IT! He went back for seconds. Very tasty, thank you.

My grand mother made this every week for us.  One of my favorites!!!  I never did get the correct recipe after she passed,  and have spent two years searching for it.  THIS IS IT!!!  thank you!  I love this,  down home southern cooking,  just like my nanny.  =) I also add sauteed mushrooms though,  as a pprevious user suggested.  It is very good,  and I wouldn't change a thing!!!!!

I made this exactly as directed including pounding the flour into the meat.  My first instinct was that the meat needed to be cooked in the oven to tenderize but due to time restraints I cooked it on top the stove for 2-4 minutes per side as the recipe called for. Happy that the internal temp reached 165 degrees but the meat was tough and chewy.  This was a disappointment and waste.

I made this per the recipe.  I thought there was too much pepper from the way I have been used to eating it when I was a kid.  I would cut back on the ratio of pepper to salt on a one to one ratio.  That is the only thing that I thought was off.  i love pepper, so I still liked it a lot.  And boosting the flavor with other additional ingredients is a nice recommendation as well.

I really liked this! I used cubed pork steaks, and added johnny's season all. I did the large shell noodles as the side. I just wished there was more gravy! Since you have so much off the seasoned flour/cornstarch, you could probably make a lot more gravy.

I made half a recipe but it didn’t have enough gravy.  I ended up doubling the regular gravy ingredients.  The dish was very tasty and I will make it again, with my modifications.

I thought it was a little bland at first, but by the time I finished the steak, I was sponging it up off my plate! There was nothing left.

I would omit the pepper and add as needed after serving. It was almost inedible . I would also put it in a slow cooker or instantapot

My family liked this recipe and would like me to make it again. I followed the recipe. I made few changes. I left the salt out of the dredge flour and added a pinch of garlic powder and garlic powder.  I thought that I lost the meat flavor in the milk gravy. To help the flavor I added 3 Tablespoons (1 packet) of brown gravy dry mix and a little exta water. My milk gravy turned brown, but was tasty. I gave this 4 stars because of the gravy, but this one is a winner I will make again.

I made this, and we loved it. I used almond milk as a milk alternative, and the gravy was still creamy and delicious. If you like a lot of gravy, I would recommend adding some extra milk. May need to adjust flour and corn starch accordingly.

This was  great! The only thing I did different was sprinkle  a little Tony Chachere's creole seasoning to the meat before frying, just to give it a little kick. I also made extra gravy for the side of mashed potatoes I made to go with it.

So good! The only thing I added was cayenne pepper because my husband wanted it a little bit spicy! Other than that I followed the exact recipe ?? we had it with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Defiantly will be making it again.
