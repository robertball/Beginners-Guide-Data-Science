This is a very good, satisfying breakfast. I replaced the coconut milk with skim milk (preference), and omitted the lemon juice (none on hand), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. When I assembled all of the ingredients, I feared it would turn out dry. But this morning it  was perfect. My son and I both love it. This will be a new staple in the mornings, very easy to assemble, very healthy, and very yummy!
