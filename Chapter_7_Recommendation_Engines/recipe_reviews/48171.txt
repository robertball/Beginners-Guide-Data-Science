I have a hard time getting my husband to eat  vegetables, but he loved this pie even with all the mushrooms! We will cook this every month! My oven must run hot, but I would only cook it for 30 mins or so, just long enough to brown the crust since everything else is already cooked.  I also used 4 oz of mushrooms instead of 6.  It was plenty.

I tried this because it sounded good, and I had leftover burgundy wine from a beef burgundy recipe I had made over the weekend.  Anyway.... I did not like this at all.

This was very tasty however there was too much liquid. Next time I will just add a little bit of liquid at a time so I can judge it better. I added a diced carrot to add some more nutritional value. How strong the flavour is will depend on what wine you use.

I donâ€™t use that much onion. And I always add some garlic!
