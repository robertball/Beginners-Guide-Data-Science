I used soured milk and a homemade white-whole wheat all purpose mix in this recipe. I chose not to fold the bananas or chocolate chips in, instead I sprinkled a little over each pancake mound on the griddle. I did not try this myself--my kids said they were really good, though. NOTE: Keep in mind that if you do like I did and use a whole wheat flour in this recipe, you may need to increase the milk a touch.

The texture of these pancakes was rubbery.  It needs baking soda, baking powder and some oil.

These were delicious. The batter turned out a little thick so added a little more milk and all was good! Added some homemade peanut butter syrup and it was one of the most delicious breakfasts I have ever had!

My kids and I LOVED these!! I had to add a little extra milk to thin the batter a bit, but other than that, SOOOOOO yummy!!

They were decent but not all that fantastic. The kids didn't really care for them.
