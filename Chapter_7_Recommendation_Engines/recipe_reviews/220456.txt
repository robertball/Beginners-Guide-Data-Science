I went with this recipe hoping to make the potato part in my crockpot.......but my crockpot died. I transferred everything to a large soup pot and went on with the recipe. I actually made a double recipe of this with the intent of leftovers for tomorrow. After the potatoes cooked, I mushed them with the old fashioned potato masher, then folded in the cheese sauce. I did not use half-n-half in this recipe, I used whole "lactose-free" milk in it's place. That made no difference in the taste of the soup. After tasting it, I did add in more garlic powder and hot pepper sauce. This was a very nice cheese-potato soup. My husband and kids especially liked it. The flavor of the Velveeta went well with the potatoes--the flavor reminded me of scalloped potatoes.

I did not use the Velveeta, but used aged sharp cheddar cheese instead, and we loved this soup, served it with crusty french bread rolls!

All six of us enjoyed this recipe,  I added extra velveeta and 3 oz cream cheese and some cayenne.
