This turned out to be an unexpected surprise, much better and certainly more memorable, than I thought it would be.  However, I bumped up the flavor by using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, using shitake mushrooms, chicken base rather than bouillon, and a good glug of white wine.  I skipped the salt, which wasnâ€™t necessary because of the bouillon or chicken base. This was excellent, actually.  And elegant.

This was very good rice, but then I love mushrooms!  I wish I would have seen the line at the end of the recipe that I could have added garlic to it because that would have been a nice touch.  I followed the recipe except to use the red, yellow, and orange peppers rather than the green pepper called for.  Thank you for a nice side dish!

Great dish! ...but let's make this easier!
We had fresh mushrooms to use up and I found this recipe.
I cooked the onion, peppers & mushrooms as directed, but added 1 Tablespoon of minced garlic (mine was from a jar) from other suggestions.
Then, I stirred in the same measurements of water and rice... BUT, I used YELLOW RICE ("Par Excellence with Saffron" from BJs'). 
I just knew it wouldn't need: salt, pepper, garlic powder, bullion, broth or ANYTHING ELSE! 
I also knew that I was taking a chance & warned Wifey that she would be a 'test subject'
Happy to report that the experiment was successful!
The YELLOW RICE filled out ALL of the other flavors beautifully & took out all of the guesswork!
This was our main dish and we both loved it!
This will be a regular veggie-night dish, for us!!!

my boyfriend absolutely loved this!  I didn't have green pepper and followed others' advice and added some garlic.  This is a nice change from plain rice and as my boyfriend said "a definite keeper!"

I too enjoyed this recipe greatly!: although I have substituted celery for the bell pepper every time I've made this pilaf.  The instruction to add garlic seemed unnecessary as garlic powder is already called for, I did however omit the powder in favour of one clove of fresh.  This is a great accompaniment to many a meal!! Thanks for this versatile recipe!

Made this on a whim to go with a turkey meatloaf. I was very pleased with it ! Turned out really good. I did change a few things. I chopped garlic , about 3 cloves , instead of using garlic powder , also used jasmine rice not white , I used chicken broth to sub the water and bouillon. I also added parsley. It was very yummy and I will definitely make this again . Thank you!

I could not find a can of French Onion Soup thus I used a package of Knorr Onion Soup Mix.  It took a few extra minutes in preparation time but well worth it.  Instead of adding mushrooms, as my family does not like mushrooms, I used peas.  Everyone loved it.

This was a fairly easy dish that delivered lots of flavour. I choose to go with chopped cremini mushrooms and red pepper, that's what I had on hand. I used avocado oil in place of the butter to saute the vegetables.  I'm not a fan of garlic powder so I used fresh. I also added the rice to the vegetables and allowed it to brown, more flavour. I used a splash of wine to deglaze the pan and allowed that to cook off before adding the water.  This was served with pan seared salmon and roast cauliflower. Thanks!!

Low and slow.  I recommend cooking this slowly and on low after you put in your rice for another 20 minutes perhaps.  The taste was wonderful. Next time I will experiment with other mushroom varieties.  Perhaps using an exotic dried mix of mushrooms.  Delicious.  Made this as a side to some baked Haddock.  My husband and I both loved it!

I love mushrooms, so, I thought I would get this a try. Honestly I wasn't expecting a wow flavor because it didn't appear to have too much seasoning in the recipe.  Boy, was I wrong!  The flavor was very good and had a wonderful mushroom flavor that infused the rice.  I didn't have any chicken bouillon, so, I used part chicken broth and part water.  I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  The only thing I would do differently is add something a little fresh at the end like some fresh parsley or a sprinkle of green onions.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this rice.  I used 8oz baby portabella mushrooms, a small onion, celery (in lieu of green pepper) and 3 cloves garlic. I also added about a quarter cup of grated parmesan at the end.  It was so delicious!

I made this and loved it. I gave it only four stars because I thought it could have used more seasoning. Next time I make it I will add more (including salt), but it is still a delicious recipe.

This was very good.  I went with Naples 34102 suggestions of using fresh garlic, baking for the full 20 minutes, seasoning the fish, chicken base and white wine.  It was a very nice side dish with baked whitefish.

I was surprised about how good this recipe was. I avoid eating white rice. I mostly eat brown rice. The time to cook it seems to be a little off, but I kept adding chicken broth until it cooked to my satisfaction. I will try this recipe again because the results were still good.

This recipe is good. It is a different thing. Now, I did not really change the recipe, but replaced the powdered garlic with a clove of garlic that I cooked with the onion. As liquid I used chicken broth exclusively. I will make it again. NOTE: If making this for 2 people, be watchful that you might need 11/3 cup of broth or water and adjust from then as you see the rice absorb the liquid.

Absolutely delicious!  I served this with Lemon Baked Salmon ( on this site) and pairing these two together was a winner.  The lemon sauce on the salmon also enhanced the flavor.

Delish!  I used baby bella mushrooms, a combo of red, green and yellow pepper, fresh garlic, and added a touch of turmeric for added color and flavor. I omitted the garlic powder and salt. I also substituted the chicken bouillon granules with chicken broth because I find the bouillon granules to be too salty.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good and easy to make. Not your typical pilaf as the rice isn't simmered with the butter, garlic and onions first. I didn't have green pepper so use a bit of seedless jalapeno first and it could have used more. The mushrooms gave it a great flavor and a bit different texture.

Good recipe! Subbed in celery for onion due to allergy in the house. Also subbed in mushroom broth for the water to help bring out flavours. Tasted amazing!

Used black rice, canned chicken broth and chopped portabella mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe. I would make again

We used chicken stock, fresh garlic, and added some frozen green beans.  Smelled wonderful while it cooked and very tasty too.

Used more onion and fresh garlic and no peppers as had none. It could have used more bullion and perhaps a bit of fresh parsley, but overall a quick and easy side.

Made it a couple of times and my family loves it. I'm not a big pepper fan so i substituted with celery.

I liked it, but I made enough changes that it didn't resemble the original recipe as much. I cooked it as is and thought it was a bit bland, added another 1/2 cup water with a beef cube, and more garlic.

I thought this pilaf was tasty! It turned out a little creamy, hubby really liked it. I would definitely make it again. Best to use a good rice. I used chicken broth instead of water and bullion cubes. I also use an orange pepper instead of green. This will be my go to rice dish. Quick, easy and deelish!

I like the combination of ingredients although the rice turned out a little on the bland side. But goes great with a savory dish!
