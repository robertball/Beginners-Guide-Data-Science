I liked this recipe a lot. I am not a super experienced baker, but nothing about this recipe was difficult. I followed the recipe exactly the first time, but because I used dried lemon zest, the lemon flavor was really strong. The second time I made them, I cut the zest in half (used the dried again) and the lemon flavor was perfect. Also, cutting the peeps out is ridiculously tedious. I would not cut them again, but this lemon bar recipe is amazing.

The recipe was delicious, but  making more of the lemon filling would have made it taste better.

The lemon bars a tasty...however...the cookie cutter idea was a hot mess!!! I tried flouring them, I tried Pam spray, I tried dry, I tried wet. What I got was a messy goopy blob.
