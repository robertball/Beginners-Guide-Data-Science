Made this for Halloween 2012 and loved it! *Very sweet* and yummy. My guests loved it, too! I added a frozen "brain" which made the look perfect! Highly recommended! 
Side note: You will want to serve an alternative drink with the punch if you have guests who cannot drink sugared drinks.

This was a big hit at my grandsons birthday halloween party.  I decreased the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup. (Reading other reviews of being very sweet) Also, froze red soda in a glove and floated the hand on top. Would definitely recommend this punch.

Note only added a half cup of sugar! I also had to freeze gallon bags over night for slushy effect. Great with gummy worms ice cubes!!
