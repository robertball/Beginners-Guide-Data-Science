This was a very bland recipe, IMO; however, we added some cumin late in the cooking process and that made a big difference. It went from uneaten to gone!

I'm undecided about this recipe.  My husband liked it but thought it needed more tequila.  I thought it was too bland.  We dipped shrimp and bread as suggested.  The shrimp went well with it, but I used some sourdough bread that I had and it didn't go well with the fondue at all.  IF I try this recipe again I will add more tequila and use a different kind of bread.
On the upside, it was very easy and quick.

I made this fondue for the first course of a sit-down dinner shower for 20 people that was themed "Noche Romantica".  We had three pots, one on each table, and each pot was wiped clean by the bread I served with it!  People raved and absolutely loved it.  It was a huge hit!!  I am making it again now!

This recipe was great! Some changes that I made were to use ASIAGO cheese. Also, I doubled the amount of lemon juice and Tequila... good ol'Jose Cuervo to be exact! We dipped broiled chicken, crab meat, french bread, apples, and lightly steamed veggies.  We truly enjoyed this fondue experience!

Way too tedious to come out so bland.  I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed.  And now I have to find a recipe in which I can use the rest of that Cotja cheese that I went all over the county looking for.

I made this recipe along side two other dips for a group of fifteen teenagers and young adults. It was definitly the star of the show. This recipe was so delicious and there was no leftovers! In fact it has been about three months and I still dream about it. (I made it without the tequila and it still turned out great)

This was okay.  I ate it, but no one else would.  The cotija cheese wouldn't melt - so it was clumpy in the fondue.  This was my first time to make it, so it very well could have been me.  I followed the directions exactly, except that I ended up returning it the oven for about 15 minutes, to try to melt the cheese - which never happened.  Was a bit runny too, but that was probably my fault.
I probably won't make it again, because my family wouldn't eat it, and most of it ended up being thrown out.

I also used asiago cheese and added more tequilla.  If you are looking for something that is just not the same old traditional fondue, this is awesome!

Great Recipe. I used it for valentine dinner. I added more garlic, more cheese, and doubled the tequila. I served it with fresh bread and marinated steak chunks and it was a huge hit.
