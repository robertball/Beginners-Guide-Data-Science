After making this I was left wondering if there were some serious errors on the qtys of ingredients. This initially came out as a big soupy mess. 1/3 cup of bulgur wasn't nearly enough so I ended up going back and hydrating another cup of dried bulgur and then adding it to the rest of the ingredients. Before I added more bulgur, I had a bowl of parsley, mint and tomatoes floating in lemon & tomato juice. Since this was already so soupy I only used half of the olive oil and I also cut back on the salt.  You might consider seeding the tomatoes to cut back on the liquids. This was also much more lemony than any other recipe I've tried. I didn't mind the lemon flavor but it was much more prominent than any versions I've been served before.

Leave out the cinnamon!!!, add one more bunch of parsley-wash really well, don't boil the burghul wheat-just soak it for 5 minutes, add 1/3 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup olive oil and adjust to taste.

WE used this as a base and made one with all of the ingrediants except the cinamon and the bulgar.  We used quinoa.  We love the texture so much better than the bulgar wheat - and we can serve it to our friends who are not able to eat wheat.  Thanks!

I didn't enjoy this recipe as written; there was just too much lemon juice, oil, and tomato included and the cinnamon flavor was all wrong. I substituted half of a large cucumber for two of the tomatoes, substituted green onions for a milder onion flavor, only used the juice of one lemon and only 1 Tablespoon of olive oil; I also used ground allspice instead of cinnamon and I added one clove of garlic and in the future may use two or three. This recipe is much too watery as written, even if the bulgur is drained after cooking, which it should be. With my modifications I would give this a rating of four; it's still not the best tabouli I've ever had, but it's good and I'll make it again.

I just kind of used the recipe as a base and eyeballed the amounts. This was really lemony, I added a tiny bit of sugar and a lot of salt to cut the sourness. However, tabouli is a great way to use up all the parsley I was blessed with, and this recipe has all the classic ingredients I remember.

forget the cinnamon (not a good match with the parsley)...try 4 or 5 green onions instead of regular onions for a milder taste.  Sumac is a nice lemon-flavoured spice that I like to add (amount depends on your liking- 1 tsp is enough for me).  Also, I like my bulgur to have some crunch, so I only soak it in warm water for 10 minutes or so.  Serve with romaine lettuce for an authentic side to barbecue chicken and rice.

Cinnmon is not a good spice for this. 1/2 tsp of All spice is what makes this amazing. Also adding 1 bunch of scallions helps alot to.

I found this to be overwhelmingly lemon-y with very strong onion taste as published. 

Also, I just soak the bulgur in cold water for longer. Doing a short soak in hot water makes it gummy. I put it in a pan and cover it with cold water. I strain it all and add fresh water in a few hours, and then let it all soak for several hours. I usually leave mine in a pot on the counter overnight.

With the following modifications, this came out pretty good. 

-NO cinnamon. When I'm ready to mix everything, I put all of the parsley and mint in the bowl first. That way, as I add ingredients, I can do taste-tests and check for consistency.

-I start with 1/8 cup of olive oil and add more if needed. I start with 1/8 cup of lemon juice. I used flat leaf parsley, and added an extra bunch.

- One onion was sufficient and didn't overpower the other flavors. It was a subtle. Two onions will be very bold.
Thank you Rabie for adding this original recipe. It's a great one we can build on.

This recipe is basically the same I have made for 40 yrs. People love it. My family loves the fact that it stays fresh for several days.

Classic middle eastern rendition of Tabbouleh. I Used less parsley and substituted a larger portion of quinoa and farrow for the burgal I also add a few black olives, cucumbers, and allspice for a much more festive dish that my Lebanese hubby loves.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe.  The warmth of the cinnamon goes great with the citrus and mint and evens out the parsley.

Totally wrong, adding so much liquid turns this into soup. Everyone, avoid making this recipe, especially the cinnamon.

Wonderful with the few to weeks like Christine suggested. Leave out the cinnamon, added some fresh mined garlic, cucumber and green onion. Hubby truly loved it!  Made grilled rack of lamb and cucumber dill salad along with it. We are avoiding starches and I am Gluten Free so I used Quina but only 3 table spoons.

i made it pretty much as is, only change was i used only green onions.
i love the lemony flavor.  dont mind the cinnamon.  but as one person said maybe all spice would be a better choice.  i am not tabouli expert but i thought it was tasty.  i will make it again
