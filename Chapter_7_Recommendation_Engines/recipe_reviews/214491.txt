YUMMMM!!!!! I have to say that we totally LOVED this chicken! I made a couple of changes tho :-) I always do... I scaled this recipe down to 6..well I used 3 whole chx breast and cut em in half then pounded them out and had 6 pcs. I used EVOO and 2T butter to saute my cremini mushrooms, onion and garlic in. After the mush turned soft, I added a lil (only a sm amt, bc the bacon will have alot of salt) S&P.  I added about 2T heavy cream to the mush mix then about 2T (ish) It. brd. crumbs.  I didn't shred anything...I used 1 lg garlic clove as well. I used sliced Havarti cheese. (slice BF ham, hav ch, mush mix, then put it on top of my thin chx brst and roll it.) I also used balsamic vinegar to brush on my chicken after I rolled them...it added another depth of flavor. Absolutley use the bacon pcs on the chicken, bc OMG they are PHEONOMINAL!! Be sure to broil for 10 mins after cooking!!! I put my chx on a rack on a foil covered baking sheet...less mess.  We LOVEDDDDD these...I made Easy Mushroom Rice from this site...if you want that to be awesome, also check out my review :-) Thanks sooooooooo much for sharing your awesome recipe, dude, you rock!

Due to lack of time I prepared this as more of a casserole and it was fabulous!  I put one can of cream of mushroom on the bottom of a 13x9 pan, hammered out the chicken (salt and peppered) and placed on top of the cream of mushroom.  Prepared the onions and mushrooms as suggested and placed on top of the chicken breasts.  Covered with cheese and baked for 40 minutes @ 350.  It was fabulous this way so I can imagine the original recipe is amazing as well.  Will try the way it is written when time is permitting.

This took a little extra effort than most baked chicken dishes, but with some tweaking to suit my tastes, it was fun preparing it, and we enjoyed eating it. It was nice to have something a little more “fussy” and interesting.  When I chopped up the mushrooms and onions, I did so till the mixture was a fine mince and added some garlic as well.  (I meant to deglaze the pan with a little white wine, which would have been nice, but I forgot) I skipped the bread crumbs entirely and just as I suspected, we didn’t miss them. As for the cheese, wouldn’t you know I had just about everything BUT Havarti in the fridge but there are any number of acceptable substitutes – in a pinch any semi-soft cheese will do.  I used a Pepper Jack for mine, but in consideration of Hubs’ sensitive innards I used just a mild Cheddar in his. Rather than piling the mushroom-onion mixture and the cheese on the chicken in a blob, I spread everything over the surface of each breast and then rolled it up pinwheel-style.  Wrapping each with two slices of bacon was not only too much, it resulted in the bacon underneath staying unattractively fatty and gloppy.  One slice, cut in two pieces and laid over the top, would have worked much better.  Not only did we not miss the bread crumbs, I don’t think I’d miss the cheese either. You wouldn’t be sacrificing any flavor or compromising the dish by eliminating both.

This recipe is very easy to make and makes my kitchen smell absolutely delicious. Instead of flattening the chicken and rolling it I stuffed the chicken with the ingredients. I also use crushed bran flakes instead of bread crumbs for a healthier version. DELICIOUS!

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! Soo good! Followed the recipe except I didn't have bread crumbs so I used Panko. Worked fine! I also made a basic white sauce with some garlic powder parmesan s&p and parsley. This sauce was really nice over top of it! (I made it for some steamed broccoli and ended up pouring some on the chicken.) I made it with roast potatoes for my boyfriend tonight. He thinks he'll keep me.;)

A new favorite! However I had no choice but to make some adjustments. 1st I didn't have harvarti cheese and 2nd I didn't want to use the ham I had (intended for another dish). So I didn't wrap the chicken with the bacon but baked and crumbled my thick maple bacon before hand. I followed another reviewers suggestion and added a lil heavy cream to my sauted baby bella's chopped garlic and parmesan cheese along with the seasoned bread crumbs. I stuffed each breast with Munster cheese stuffing mix and bacon bits. Instead of leaving the chicken alone to bake as is I mixed cream of mushroom & cream of chicken soup with sour cream and topped the chicken; added more munster cheese and provolone on top of that! It was excellent!

I changed the servings to 4 on the recipe. Imagine my surprise when it called for 76 cups shredded cheese?? I figured out how much to use and it turned out great. It was a bit too salty and I think it might have been because I used a thick sliced bacon. Next time I'll try it with thin sliced bacon. Your girlfriend is a lucky gal!

I like to use crushed Caesar Salad Croutons (they do add a flavor boost) instead of bread crumbs simply because we always have some in the cupboard. I like the brushing with balsamic vinegar suggested in a review also.

Made this to go with a ham for Easter brunch and even though I doubled the batch there was nothing left. My family attacked them and then asked for more. I did everything exactly according to the recipe except for the cheese I used Provolone slices and I made a sauce to go on top that enhanced the flavors even more. Sooo so good will be making this quite often.

To get the bacon to crisp we added 5 minutes to the time. The bacon did crisp then but the chicken was still white and on the verge of getting dry. A little more stuffing would be better too.

This recipe rocks! Like several before me I too changed it! My girlfriend has many food allergies so cooking for her is a very delightful challenge. She can't have gluten so I eliminated the bread crumbs. She is allergic to casein and capsaicin so the butter and Havarti-pepper cheese are out. I exchanged 2T Earth Balance and 2T EVOO Favalosa(FS17) for the butter and for the Havarti I used a sheep's cheese called Ewephoria(yes it is!). The bacon was Hempler's honey smoked no-nitrate. As the bread crumbs were eliminated there was lots of liquid left in the pan. The fried potatoes for tomorrow's breakfast are marinating in the fridge!

Great Taste! Good as is. I also made a different recipe using this as the starting point. Added a box of frozen diced spinach to the onions mushrooms a little diced garlic and Italian bread crumbs. Used this as the stuffing.

I was really excited about this recipe but was sadly disappointed. I really did not like the mushroom stuffing. I stuffed the chicken breast rather than rolling it but I doubt that made too much difference. I made the recipe pretty much as stated using portabella mushrooms. I used regular havarti (couldn't find havarti-pepper) and it had no impact on the flavor. I would use something with a stronger flavor for sure. I think I didn't like the bread crumbs mixed with the shrooms? I don't know what it was! However I did like the bacon wrap idea and also brushed it with balsalmic vinigar like another reader suggested and that was really good. I doubt I will make this again. It sounded so good and smelled great looked amazing when I took it out of the oven but I pretty much ate around the stuffing so can't say that its a keeper at all. Hubby didn't care for the stuffing either. Thanks though!

I enjoyed this - and my husband loved it!! We were running low on time after Bible Study and work one night so I decided to follow advice of another reviewer and make the "casserole" version of this dish. In the bottom of a baking dish (to make sure it remained moist) I combined a little milk flour and chicken broth. I then added the seasoned chicken breasts on top. I layered on the mushroom onion garlic and bread crumb mix (pretty much followed the recipe for this) on top. Then I topped with pepper jack cheese and cooked until the chicken was done and the cheese was bubbling and crisply browned. It was sooooo GOOD!!!!! When I have more time I'll probably prepare it the real "stuffed" way. My hubby has already asked me to make this one of our staple dishes!!

Perfect! Made this recipe proportioned down to make 4 chicken rolls. Didn't have bacon on hand so just sprayed butter spray and topped with bacon bits. Then added a bit of shredded Italian cheese when it was almost done. My husband's word to describe it was "fantastic" and I wholeheartedly agree. I think this would also be good with pecan chips in the filling. Thanks for a perfect recipe as is!

Ok...so what had happened was.. I wasn't paying attention at the store and I bought a mixed pack of thighs and breasts. I stuffed the breast just by making an opening sealed shut with a toothpick and wrapped in two slices of bacon. the chicken thighs were covered by a couple slices of Black Forest ham the mushroom mixture then slices of havarti cheese. Topped by crumbled bacon. Served it on top of fettuccine alfredo. It was amazing!

Delicious I also tweaked the recipe I didn't have bread crumbs so I omitted. I only had American cheese and i added turkey bacon and turkey slices. I only made enough for three and it took 45 minutes. Omg! Delicious. Thank you for this new favorite dish. Do not add extra salt bacon had enough to season.

This had a great flavor. I made it as written except I couldn't find the cheese listed so I just used regular sliced Havarti. I did slightly precook the bacon before I wrapped it around the chicken breasts and when it was finished baking the bacon was nicely browned and I didn't have to worry about the underside of it being partly raw. Because of precooking it didn't need to go under the broiler. Our chicken was moist and we thought all the flavors went together nicely. I would make this again.

I made this for my son and my parents. My parents didn't like it but my son and I thought it was very good so we ended up eating all of the left overs. I don't recommend using 12 slices of flattened chicken breast -unless you're feeding 12 people! I cut that amount in half and it was more than enough for us. I made this exactly as the recipe said. However I will change it up next time. I suggest cutting the bacon and laying over the tops of the chicken instead of wrapping it around. The bacon on top gets crispy whereas the bacon on the bottom is not cooked enough at least for us. I suggest making a sauce like a "Bearnaise" sauce to pour over the chicken before serving. The chicken got a little dried on the ends when I used the broiler to crisp up the bacon as stated in the recipe. I could skip the bread crumbs next time and it would be just as tasty with mushrooms onions and cheese. Overall this is a great recipe and I am glad I found it. I will make it again and again. Thank you so much for sharing.

This was delicious and easy to make. I ended up buying jalapeño Havarti instead of the pepper jack so there was that little kick that heightened the flavors. I will definitely make this again maybe sliced as an appetizer. Watch the broiler closely. Only takes about 2 minutes on each side to crisp up the bacon.

This is SO good! I made a couple very small changes but nothing that would change the overall concept of the recipe. The first change is I made this with chicken thighs instead of breasts as we don t like chicken breasts because they are very dry and chewy. Because I used thigh meat I made this as a casserole instead of a stuffed dish. The thighs were put into a dish the Black Forest ham went next the mushroom stuffing was put on top (I did sauté some garlic with the mushroom and onion and used panko crumbs as that s all I had) then the havarti cheese and last the bacon (turkey bacon for us). Cooked it for about a half hour. So delicious! Because it was more of a casserole I didn t have to deal with the hassle of flattening and rolling and pinning with toothpicks.

Whoa don t need any side salad with this a complete and delicious meal all by itself. I added arugula into the filling and some baby spinach. Just 1 piece of thick cut pepper bacon on each breast. Excellent!! Pinned each rolled breadt with a metal turkey pin.. Don t think toothpicks will do it. Watch your broiler at the end bacon will brown quick. Super delicious!!

This is delicious! I made this last night for seven guests and they raved asking for the recipe. A few minor changes: added a minimum of salt to the stuffing as well as a heart healthy lower sodium Black Forest ham a package of rehydrated mixed mushrooms as well as button mushrooms unseasoned breadcrumbs and chopped fresh basil and oregano in the mix. Could not find Havarti Pepper cheese but used Havarti Jalapeño It took an hour to bake before putting under the broiler for ten minutes. Moist and so tasty. Will make again!

I cut the recipe to 1 chicken breast which makes 2 servings. I actually made the mushroom recipe the way I make mushroom empanadas (minced sauteed with dill scallions parsley cheddar breadcrumbs and a little heavy cream) but then followed the rest of the recipe. I used honey ham over the mushroom recipe and used 2 slices of bacon per serving. you really want to cover the chicken with the bacon so it doesnt dry out on the ends. my boyfriend's only suggestion was to add some type of sweet glaze on top. There was a user who used balsmic on top and i just forgot to do it but next time i will brush the bacon with it prior to putting under broiler. Also i would broil for 5 minutes not 10. i did it for 6 minutes and the ends seems a little dry. that is why i mention the bacon covering. My boyfriend said it was good and he definitely wants me to make it again. You could really stuff it with anything you want. the breadcrumbs are necessary so that the filling doesnt turn juicy and run out completely. i used about 1/8-1/4 c of fresh breadcrumbs.

Really enjoyed this chicken! Was a nice change. The only thing I wished I had thought to do is precook the bacon a little. It just wouldn't crisp up very well.

I made this for my husband and I. Only needed 2 chicken breasts. Made the stuffing per recipe. Had some leftover which I added garlic broccoli snow peas red and orange peppers plus my frozen corn kernels. This was continued for a stir fry accompaniment..... Also had no bacon so used prosciutto for wrap.. cooked on bbq in foil When correct internal temp was reached. I unwrapped foil and gave it a couple of mins more. I was a little unadventurous with the spud choice and chose baked. My husband was very delighted and said it was delicious. My Mission accomplished.

thought the bread crumbs over powered the mushroom/onion. Bacon did not cook on the bottom.

Loved it! Made it for some friends and they really enjoyed it. Will definitely make it again. Will recommend to flip the breast over when broiling so that bottom of bacon gets crisp too.

So easy to make. I used thin sliced Harvarti cheese. Any number of cheeses would work with this recipe. My family loved it.

To make sure the bacon is fully cooked I sautéed the wrapped breasts before putting in the oven. Delicious!

FANTASTIC!!!! I reduced the amount of Havarti based on the other reviewers comments. My grocery didn t have button mushrooms so I bought the fresh regular ones. I made no other changes. We re adding this recipe to the regular dinner rotation!

Definitely a hit. I scaled it down and there is a problem with the cheese when you do so I estimated but it still turned out really well... I didn't wind up broiling it the bacon was done enough if not crispy but didn't want to dry out the chicken by over cooking plus I was cooking in pyrex. That said next time I will use slightly more cheese.

great idea made some changes..added red peppers and thyme omitted the bread crumbs. Used pepper jack and Greek kaseri cheese. baked til almost done then covered in white suace made with mushrooms onion garlic and red pepper and broiled with more cheese on top. also use balsamic as others suggested. next time add capers...make it again with mushrooms and asparagus and this time added the bread crumbs. Next time I will omit them as it really doesnt need it. Served over rice and a tomato basil salad side.

I used Panko bread crumbs bc that's what I had on me. 1 cup is way too much! It's alright. I love meat but this was too rich and the chicken is just barely cooked through. Also my cheese oozed all out so I didn't really taste it. I also didn't see the toothpicks until starting the recipe so that might be why.

I used a colby-jack blend of cheese instead of havarti which the market did not have when I went shopping. Delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Instead of Havarti cheese I used mozzarella because I already had it. I will definitely be making it again soon.

Excellent!!! The only change I made was substituting sliced Havarti-pepper cheese for shredded I couldn't find it locally. Placing the rolls under the broiler at the end really crisps & browns the bacon to perfection. Next time I'll flip them over and broil the underside.

This was a very nice and not terribly challenging recipe. It definitely is pleasing to the eye when it comes out and bacon holds the entire mix together surprisingly well. The stuffing component could use something to make the flavor more exciting but I guess that means I'll prepare this one again down the line.

I loved this! I did make one addition & substitution: I added a can of Cream of Mushroom soup to the juices from the chicken and made a gravy to put on top of the chicken. Also I didn't have any Havarti Cheese so I used Provolone Cheese. Oh my it was heavenly and so very tasty! I also made a Garlic/Mushroom Risotto to go with the chicken. The flavors melded so well together. I'll definitely do this again!! It was even better t he next day.

Everyone loved this chicken! There were only 4 of us so I only used 2 chicken breasts sliced them in half lengthwise pounded them and went from there. I added garlic and wine to the mushroom mixture and I put the crumbs on the top of the chicken and then I cut one piece of partially cooked bacon (per piece of chicken) into 3 pieces and put them on the top only using toothpicks to hold the chicken together. I broiled them for just a minute or two so they wouldn t get dry. It was perfect filling and has become a keeper for our family. Thank you for this recipe.

I made a bit extra but it wasn't necessary as these are very filling. However I'm glad I did because everyone had seconds. Not a leftover to be seen. I swapped buttons for portabellos. They were fantastic!

Incredibly tasty! I bought 6 chicken cutlets already pounded out. Used the called for amount of onion and mushrooms added garlic and then only used about 1/3 C of italian seasoned bread crumbs. I used sliced havarti because my grocery store didn't have shredded. Didn't use toothpicks because I used the bacon to tie in the chicken and mushroom stuffing. Sprinkled balsamic vinegar on the top of the bacon per another reviewer's suggestion. Low broiled for the last 6-7 min and then put the remaining 3-4 min on 425 while I was finishing the sides. I was so happy with this recipe and I can't wait to make it again!

I think my roll up may have been too thick and as a result it took like 45 minutes to reach an internal temp of 165 and then after another 5 min under the broiler the chicken was dried out. It looked fantastic and the filling was good. I just didn't find that the bacon was enough to keep the chicken from drying out and I thought that the ham (I used smoked turkey) kind of overwhelmed the taste of the chicken as well. I might make this again just using mushrooms onions and cheese and try to make the "rolls" smaller so they cook a little faster.

I liked this but hubby thought it was just ok - which was a little disappointing because chicken bacon and mushrooms?? Should have been an automatic win. I think it was a bit soggy couldn t get the bacon to quite crisp up and I turned the chicken about half way through to try to avoid soggy bacon on the bottom. Didn t quite work. May try it again.

This was a great way to change up regular old chicken! I used thin breasts and added a little grated zucchini and garlic to the filling along with swiss cheese. They were devoured! Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this! I made it using only 4 chicken breasts because my family is small and wasn't sure if it would be worth saving the leftovers. You know how that goes when you try a new recipe.:) The only thing I would do differently is brown the bacon on BOTH sides of the chicken when you put it under the broiler. I only did one side but it was still amazing.

This is super delicious! I did make a few minor changes (I usually do). I used swiss cheese because that is what I had in the fridge. As the chicken cooked I was afraid it was going to be dry. So...I broiled the bacon on top of the chicken in the dish it was cooking in. Then I took some Cream of Mushroom soup reduced it w/ some white wine then put it back in oven until the sauce was bubbly. Soooo yummy!

I kinda cheated this recipe instead of flatting the chicken breast I cut it open and stuffed it with all the ingredients. I also used can mushrooms All in all this was a GREAT recipe. It cut down the prep time. This is a great meal with potatoes and green vegetables.

Awesome recipe. I made it more "paleo" by substituting parm crisps for the bread crumbs and using boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I also finished it up on my grill instead of under the broiler. Not only will I make it again it is going into my regular "rotation."
