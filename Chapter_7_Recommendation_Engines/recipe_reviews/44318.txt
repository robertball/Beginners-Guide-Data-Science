We just purchased a slow cooker so I wanted to experiment with different stews and selected this recipe.  The results were amazing. I reduced the beef broth amount to 1 cup, threw in everything, except the sour cream and flour, in the morning before work. Then when I got home, I made a 'roux' with the sour cream and flour and then tossed it in to the stew. My husband has ranked this stew as one of his all-time favourite dishes! A word of caution about parsnips. If you've never had them, they are highly flavoured and definitely influence the overall taste of the stew. If you like them, you'll love the stew as written. If you don't, just take them out and add more of the other vegetables.

This was a wonderful stew, and the only things to complain about were things I did differently from the recipe and even so, It was great.  Because it was to be the "quick supper before Christmas Eve services," I braised the lamb in advance, then dumped the veggies and broth and wine with the lamb into the slow cooker for an hour on high then on low for 5 hours.  The butternut squash disintegrated entirely, but really richened the gravy -- I think next time I'll add the squash later on in the cooking.  Also, I don't like sweet potatoes, so I used red-skinned potatoes instead, and used turnips instead of parsnips.  It was lovely.  I served it with a green salad and angel biscuits and a lightish red wine -- perfect combo.

I used this recipe several times last year.  It is easy to substitute ingredients if need be and is a hearty evening meal when served with a fresh green salad and crusty bread.

I really liked this stew.  I used more butternut squash than suggested, but I think that only added to the recipe.  I actually cooked this in a crock-pot for 6 hours.  Just before serving, I added the sour cream mixture.  The lamb was extremely tender.  Don't bother "peeling" the butternut squash with a peeler - it doesn't work well.  I just used a paring knife and cut it up into segments.

I used beef instead of lamb. It was good. I'd never had parsnips before or butternut squash so this was really new to me. I also had a lot of leftover veggies I didn't use so, I  chopped them up and blanched them for 3 min. Then measured out the required amounts for the recipe and put it all in a Ziplock bag and froze it. Now all I have to do next time is drop in  the contents of the bag and there will be no peeling or chopping.
Update: I've been making this stew (using beef) for years now and it remains my favorite. There is nothing quite like the flavors of the red wine and sour cream that change it from an ordinary beef stew to something extraordinary.

What an awesome combination of flavors!  My family went crazy over it...fighting for the last serving!  I have now even added carrots and turnips to the pot.  This one is a keeper!

One winner of a recipe Brandy! This powerhouse of nutrition was a huge hit with my family. In addition to the vegetables stated, I added a turnip, kale, red potatoes, leeks and carrots. I also threw in some fresh chopped parsley and dill. Comfort food to the max and a great way to use up leftover lamb. Thanks so much!

An excellent lamb stew with lots of different flavors. Sweet, earthy, smooth and creamy.  I prefer mine with more fresh ground pepper.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe! Make it  gluten free use 6 tsp of Arrowroot Starch instead of the flour.  Delish!

Outfreakinstanding. New favorite lamb stew. Oh my. Just a few tips... Shouldn't need additional oil for the lamb. Remove the lamb and use that oil to saute the carrot or parsnip (make sure it 's peeled), onion, and celery, then add the garlic. Remove any excess oil at this time. Add the spices and lamb meat back in, turn the heat up to high, add the wine for a minute or so (I'd recommend adding half again as much - 1/2 c extra), then add the stock. There's really no need to wait to add the other vegetables, but you can if you want.

Bland!  Required additional seasoning.  The lamb was definitely tender, but there was too much Butternut Squash for my own taste.

This was delicious and easy using the crockpot.  The seasoning was just right.  I served the sour cream on the side instead of adding, and added a salad and bread for quick weekday meal.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made a few changes.  I doubled the broth and wine.  I cooked the onion and celery  in oil until tender, then added the lamb,browning on all sides.  I then stirred in the wine to deglaze the pan and added the beef broth, and spices and simmered for about 1 hour.  Then, I stirred in vegetables and cooked until tender (about 20 minutes)  I doubled the flour and mixed with a little water to make a slurry.  I stirred in the slurry, brought to a boil and cooked for 1 minute.  Then, I stirred in the sour cream (doubled again) and heated through.  If you boil the sour cream, it separates a bit.  Enjoy all!

A very good winter stew for a Canadian February night. Here are vegetable proportions by the veggie, not by the cup, for ease of shopping and chopping:
1 small butternut squash, 2 medium parsnips; one medium sweet potato, and 2 large stalks celery.

This is declicous but WAY better even if you make it a day ahead and let it marinate overnight.  Everyone I served it to has raved about it and one of my guests gave some serious hints about me sharing my leftovers.  I added extra garlic and onion and also ground some rosemary and added that , too, about the same amount as the thyme.  YUM!

This is a really solid recipe.  Interestingly the strength of it comes from the sour cream and sugar in the vegetables, not from any spices or procedure.  I substituted a dark beer for the red wine, turkey broth for beef, added some carrots and fresh parsley.  This is a hearty and good-for-you meal, very tasty, but I think it could have used a little bit more character in terms of spicing.  Since I don't cook with lamb very much (ever) I'm not positive what it needs.  Maybe some rosemary or spritz of dill?

I omitted the bnut squash, and used a combination of sweet and regular potatoes. I simmered the meat mixture for about 45mins, which was perfect. Served it with warm crusty bread and the rest of the red wine. Good stuff. Thanks!

AMAZING!! My family loves lamb, but we have a hard time getting them to eat veggies.......not any more.  One son gobbled two helpings and the other finished everything on his first.  Mission possible and my new fav stew recipe.  I sauted the onion and celery with the meat after about 5 minues, doubled the recipe and tripled the spices.

Excellent lamb stew!  I made this using the leftovers from a roast leg of lamb. I used what was on hand - carrots instead of parsnips, leftover roast potatoes instead of squash, a few extra bits of sweet potato to make up for lack of volume in the veggie department... it turned out FABULOUSLY!  Served over couscous, it was just to die for.  So, in addition to being a tasty and satisfying dish, I'd say this also qualifies as an extremely forgiving recipe!

I made this a day ahead for a casual dinner party, doubled recipe. I dredged the meat (plus bones) in flour, s&p before searing. Removed meat, reserved remaining fat, deglazed with 1/2 c. red wine. Sauteed onion, parsnips celery and herbs in reserved fat, adding garlic for last 2 minutes. When veggies were tender,returned meat, bones and any juices to pot. Added 4 c. broth, 3 c. wine and boil to cook off alcohol. Added squash, omitted sweet potatoes, doubled white potatoes. Brought to boil, simmered @ 1 1/2 hrs.  Served it the next evening -- no leftovers.  Didn't need any extra flour or sour cream. Yum.  This is a pretty rich, slightly sweet stew. Glad I left out the sweet potatoes! Served arugula, endive and radicchio salad with lemon/olive oil dressing and crusty bread. A keeper!

Loved this stew, I wasn't sure using sweet potatoes, turnips and squash, but it was great!  I froze the leftovers for later in the winter when we want comfort food, but coudn't wait, ate it the next week.  Making another batch today.  YUMMM!

AWESOME!!!!  Super yummy.  WAY better than traditional beef stew.  Not nearly as gristly.  I added cilantro b/c I love it.  Turned out great.  Definitely a keeper.

Turned out great. Really enjoy the versatility of this recipe. Grocery store did not have butternut so I substituted some orange acorn squash. I also skipped the salt since the beef broth already had plenty. Will make again.

I've never cooked lamb before and I did make a few errors when making this.  My husband did say that it tasted like the lamb stew he had at a restaurant the previous week - so that is a good sign that it's a good recipe.  I would like to try the recipe with beef next time.

I followed the recipe precisely, except that I accidentally put in carrots (what, no carrots in this recipe?), about a cup chopped. I also doubled the liquid because it seemed like there wasn't nearly enough liquid for the vegetable to cook (perhaps I simmered it too long before adding the veggies). I used low sodium broth, because as it reduces, it can get pretty salty otherwise. I used the pre-cut/trimmed lamb shoulder, which totally made this stew. I'm sure it would be good with beef, too, but lamb makes it something special instead of just a beef stew. The lamb was so tender that it seemed to just melt in your mouth. Next time I may add some chopped fresh rosemary, too. This is delicious, and alongside a rustic, crusty bread and a good salad, this is worthy of company. To save time, see if your grocery store carries pre-cut butternut squash. In season, our store has it, and it's worth the extra $ because cutting and peeling raw butternut squash is a you-know-what.

I absolutely love this stew!  I had to use beef instead of lamb because of what was available, but followed everything else to exactly, except for adding a little fresh dill.  As others have mentioned, some of the butternut squash breaks down to create an even richer broth, which is lovely, but the texture of the other ingredients and the balance between sweet and savory overall is what has got me hooked.  The way your kitchen smells while it's bubbling is a serious bonus as well -- the kind of left-overs I will happily live off of!

This is a fantastic stew. I feel almost cheap rating it because I didn't even use the correct meat (I used beef), but I'm sure it would be even better with lamb. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding more veggies (carrots, red potatoes) in addition to those listed, and increased the liquid slightly because of the addition, although I wouldn't do that next time. Even my picky toddler devoured every bite! Thank you for a great winter stew!

Great recipe - I substituted potatoes for sweet potatoes because that's what I had and did add extra broth because it looked like it needed it -- but once it was done I think it would have been fine with the original amount.  Will definitely make this again.

I LOVED this stew but my husband thought it was "OK" so I took off one star. I used beef since my grocery store had no lamb except an entire $40 leg. I doubles the recipe since you can't really get 1 cup of parsnips and 1 sweet potato is about double and same with a small butternut squash. Thought this was great and fairly healthy too. Will make again.

Oh my!  I feel the need to add my 2 cents since this was absolutely delicious!  I've never cooked with butternut or parsnips so I was mildly skeptical but kept an open mind.  Glad I did!!!  Followed the recipe almost to a tee but when I doubled it, I was short on butternut so I used 2 c. butternut and 2 c. carrots.  Good flavor.  Also used dry thyme instead of fresh. Would make again in a heartbeat and next time might try the frozen beef stew meat in my freezer just because I have it already.  This was fantastic!!!!!!

Love lamb stew, and this is a great variation. I had just started a traditional carrot-onion-potato stew when I decided to switch. 2.5 lb cubed lamb browned in flour and pepper,beef broth, bay leaves and thyme - one yukon gold potato, a small portobello mushroom, handful of baby carrots and pearl onions, then added half a leftover baked sweet potato, a large parsnip, a cup of diced butternut -- baked in a covered casserole 2-3 hours.  The house smells heavenly, tastes wonderful, and it'll be even better tomorrow!

My husband doesn't normally enjoy lamb, but he liked this recipe. 

I made a few substitutions, given what I had on hand:
- broth: we had no beef broth, so I made my own by boiling the lamb in 8 cups of filtered water (it boiled down to a smaller amount over time)
- meat: I added diced turkey kielbasa for added flavour 
- veggies: I added butternut squash and whole baby carrots (we were low on veggies that night)
- without sour cream on hand, Greek yogurt made a great alternative.

This was delicious.  I prepared it almost exactly as written.  Just added some carrot, which I had on hand, and subbed greek yogurt for the sour cream.  It was very sweet from the root vegetables and not too rich.  Great comfort food for a chilly winter night!

I'm happy I doubled this! I used homemade lamb stock instead of beef and simmered misc lamb soup bones in the liquid and herbs / garlic / seasonings for a while to soften them instead of using stew cubes. I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream - yogurt and lamb are a natural pair for me, and it's also what I had on hand! The veggies make for a delicious sweet flavour. Will definitely make again.

This is one of the yummiest stews I've ever made. I used sweet potatoes but I substituted some grilled zucchini, roasted red peppers & mushrooms for the parsnips and butternut squash. I was almost out of sour cream so I used cream cheese instead (thinned out with milk). I placed frozen biscuits on top and put the pot in a 350 oven for 20 minutes, until the biscuits were done. It was so yummy I felt like I was eating out!

My husband does not care for sweet vegetables, but I decided to give this recipe a try because I had a big butternut squash I needed to use up.  After reading other reviews which suggested different root vegetables could be used, I replaced sweet potatoes with yukon gold potatoes, and replaced parsnips with turnip.  I also doubled the recipe.  Did not turn out well!  Had to add a lot more liquid (3 extra cups) to cover the vegetables.  When I added the sour cream/flour mixture, it created lumps in the broth, even though I added diluted it with broth as instructed.  Had to use a straining spoon to pick out the meat and larger pieces of vegetable and then poured the broth through a strainer to get out the lumps.  Veggies had overcooked and broken down, so ended up straining some of them out as well.  Would not make this one again.

What a great stew to make. The kids ate all of it. Dipped hard crusted dense bread into it an it was  yummy. There was this slight bitter taste which I'm thinking may have been the wine used, next time I'll try a different one. Kids didn't even know I used lamb until after the compliments went around the table. Will definitely try again.

Excellent tasty stew, the lamb was moist and the broth was incredibly flavourful.  I used regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes, because you will see that the veggies already make it quite sweet.  The parsnips were perfect.  I skipped the flour because it was already quite thick, and skipped the sour cream for personal preference, but my guests still rave about it!

We love stews and usually stick to traditional hearty beef/venison stews.   We got take the leftover lamb home from passover though and I decided to find something new.  BOY THIS WAS YUMMY!!!   Perhaps it helped that the lamb was superbly roasted.  As far as i know, it was roasted with garlic and cloves, probably some other stuff too so there was extra flavor in ours.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This stew was fantastic.  The sour cream really added a nice smoothness and flavor.  The winter veggies are also a little bit different from the traditional carrots and potatoes.  All together, a wonderful addition to my recipe book.

I like this recipe alot, although I found it was verbatim from my Soups and Stews book from Williams Sonoma.  I used lamb shoulder since my market did not have lamb cubed for stewing.  I would reduce the cook time to about 25 min because alot of the squash/potato got a bit too soft.  I also served it over rice to use up all the excellent goopiness it makes!  Everyone thought it was great.

Delicious!  Very filling, with an interesting flavor.  I used carrots instead of parsnips, and it still tasted wonderful.  I served it with baked sweet potatos on the side.  My family loved it.

This is scrumptious on a cold winter evening!! I used beef instead of lamb, an extra sweet potato to replace the butternut squash, added a bag of baby spinach, and used low fat sour cream. The veggies give a wonderful taste (don't skip the parsnips -- they have a unique flavor). Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again.

Absolutely yummy.  I've been eating this all week (I used some leg of lamb I had already cooked).  I add the sour cream to each serving, rather than put it all in earlier.  And I used celery root rather than actual celery because I had some.

One star for being healthy, one star for being edible, one star because we are eating the leftovers. We used beef instead of lamb (it's what the grocery had). It was a better stew before we added in the sour cream mixture.

I lucked up on a nice package of lamb neck meat at the grocery store. I substituted sweet potato and butternut squash with calabash pumpkin and carrots, i added 1 small tomato, and 1 small red pepper instead of celery. Also used a few dried allspice berries - a standard for all of my soups and stew. Just a tasty stew.

we made this, but switched out the veggies for basics: carrots, squash, celery, potatoes.  didn't have sour cream so we used yogurt.  it was fantastic!  we're definitely making this a regular staple.

I made this with a left over leg of lamb and it  was amazing. I did not add the sour cream and flour. I will definitely be making this again. I'm sure it would be just as delicious with beef.

I like lamb, and I like my veggies. I followed the instructions, but something was just "off" with this one.  Too sweet.

I liked the recipe overall, but I dislike parsnips so I omitted them. I used two bay leaves instead of one and added a few shopped cloves of garlic.

This was delicious!  I added in 2 Idaho potatoes as well, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe, except that I transferred it over to the crockpot. It was delicious even before adding the sour cream and flour and would not hesitate leaving it out, or just adding flour to thicken up the broth a bit, but the sweet potato had disintegrated , so that thickened things up.  In the future, I might add that a little later, but I did have it in the crock a little longer than anticpated.  Definitely will make it again soon.

The flavors in this stew are so fantastic! Perfect for a wintertime dinner. I followed the recipe exactly except I added carrots and sauteed the vegetables before adding the broth and wine. Delicious!

I was so surprised by this recipe.  I rememer when my parents would cook squash when I was a kid and the smell alone would bring on nausea. But I felt a leading to this and decided to try. I am sooooooo glad I did. I can't believe how good this is. Even my husband, who thinks he hates squash, liked it. I didn't have celery, so I added carrots and used celery salt in place of the salt. The only things I will do differently the next time I make this, is add more meat for my "I'm a man, I need meat" husband and shorten the cooking time after I add the veggies. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Excellent! Even my 2 year old ate an entire bowl. My anti-vegetable-husband would've liked it even more if he hadn't witnessed me cutting up the squash. 

I used venison and did double the broth. I also added a couple cubes of beef boullion. This is a keeper for sure!

Sorry....this didn't do much for us.  Actually doubled the recipe because of all the great ratings.  Ended up putting in extra spices...salt pepper, paprika and more thyme to liven it up.

Don't slice the onions, chop them! Mine turned out hard and not good. Maybe I did something wrong? I hadn't had parsnips before, I don't love them just a personal preference. Other than that the stew was yummy!

Tasty and filling. Did in crockpot. Forgot to add butternut but i roasted it and threw it in later. The parsnips and squash were so good with lamb. I thought the sour cream would be strange but it was really good. I added some curry powder out of personal preference.

So good! I am vegetarian so I took out the meat, and left out the parsnips. Even without the richness of meat, this was absolutely delicious. 

I also put in a little less red wine, as I was worried it would taste too strong. It was thick, hearty and had a great flavour. We ate it in one night!

Solid, easy recipe. I was looking to turn a leftover lamb shoulder roast into stew. It had been roasted with inserted garlic cloves, rosemary, and shawarma seasoning. 
I didn't have sweet potato, squash, or parsnip, so used peeled brown potatoes, and carrots. I also added a 1/4 cup of farrow, which takes about 25 minutes to cook. Instead of adding flour to thicken, I used the gravy I had previously made and served with the lamb. 
Served with egg noodles and naan for dipping. Family (including a picky 3 year old) ate it up.

This one is a keeper!  The only tweak I did was to cut the butternut squash amount in half.  This is a great stew to make in the slow cooker.  Just sear the lamb, add all ingredients and in 6 hours is ready to enjoy!

This was delicious and tender.  The only change I made was to mistakenly add carrot and to substitute acorn squash for butternut and a lamb bullion cube for the beef.  Will definitely make again.

Great hearty stew for winter days. Easy to make and keeps well even frozen and re-thawed.  Makes the house smell good, too.  On my third batch, I added leeks and a small handful of carrots.

Smells amazing! Sampled the flavor before it was finished and love the taste. The high note on this is, that we opened a great bottle of wine that will be served and enjoyed with the meal. Followed this recipe as close as I can. My definition of stew is; if it is fresh and you have it, put it in.

It was very tasty and the meat was tender.  I did not use the sour cream and flour mixture and the broth was still fabulous.

This was AWESOME!  I added parsnips, dill and parsley to the existing recipe, also used more garlic and bay leaf than it called for.  Used light sour cream.

My husband, who is a bit finicky, was crazy for this, and he doesn't like stew as a rule!  The lamb gave it such an excellent flavor!

It's not that the stew wasn't good, but I feel like grilled lamb was better. In my humble opinion, this was a great recipe, I added rosemary and a few other things for taste, but I think that for making lamb, anything but roast doesn't bring its full potential. I'm sure someone can do it, and I can't wait till they do, but I am not that chef.

Wow. Just wow. Absolutely phenomenal! Like slap ya' mama amazing! Just a few small adjustments below -

How I did it:
-SLOW COOKER!, 7 hours, add the sour cream mixture 10 minutes before serving 
-an entire cubed peeled medium sweet potato 
-an entire cubed small russet potato (I left the skin on)
-carrots instead of parsnips (I did this because I'm feeding a toddler and didn't want to take any chances)
-two bay leaves 
-four garlic cloves 
-FRESH thyme makes all the difference
-dash of red pepper flakes
-extra salt to taste (I think I did a solid teaspoon more)

The lamb is fall apart tender, out of this world. Grab yourself a hefty glass of full-bodied red and go to town!

This stew has the potential to be really good, but like other reviews is somewhat bland. I cooked my in a pumpkin in the oven all day long.  I believe the secret is a really good red wine.  Along with some other spices  like a little beau mont, sage, and small amount of horse radish.  Simmer covered for about 4 hours. It's best the next day. Not sure I'll make this again as written.

I used leftover boneless leg of lamb to make this dish, and it was delicious because I had already stuffed it with garlic and smothered it with brown mustard before roasting it. The ingredients list doesn't mention carrots, even though the instructions do. I used two carrots. I excluded the butternut squash because I bought acorn squash by accident. It needed a bit more salt  and some Worsterchire sauce because it was a little pale and bland. Tomorrow, I'll add some frozen peas. It could use a little more color, but otherwise it's great for a cold night in Seattle.

Very good recipe. A couple minor changes. I sautéed the onion prior to adding the lamb and added three quartered new potatoes. Other than that I cooked as described. Excellent flavor. My only complaint was the sour cream-flour mixture got a little lumpy. Served it over polenta. Really, quite good.

Really excellent dish, I moved everything into a slow cooker after browning the lamb so it was super easy. The veggies that I had on hand which I used were carrots, potatoes, sweet potato, turnips and butternut squash. Adding the sour cream and flour at the end thickened it up nicely and it was delicious. Served it with baked biscuits. Will make this again for sure.

I subbed red potatoes for sweet potatoes, carrots for parsnips, white pepper for black pepper, and garbanzo flour for wheat flour.  The results were delicious!

When I served this I forgot to add the cornstarch/flour and sour cream, but DH really liked it! Added the sour cream and cornstarch after the meal. DH took it for lunch the next day but did NOT like the addition, hence four stars. (The photo with the recipe does not appear to have sour cream in it either.)
As did other reviewers, I added carrots and cooked it in the crockpot. Will definitely make again, but without adding sour cream!

I love a great recipe that uses in season vegetables! This dish was perfect and will be a winter staple for me and my husband from here on out.  I modified as follows: added rosemary and extra garlic for seasoning; used fennel rather than celery, only b/c my market did not have organic celery, but I think the fennel worked very well and I will continue using it for this dish; used 4 cups of beef broth; the vegetables were ready after 20 minutes rather than 30 minutes; I used greek yogurt rather than sour cream and it had a little trouble mixing into the dish, but this did not affect the dish in any major way.  Served with a slice of buttered, fresh bread.  mmmm.mmmm.mmmm.good.

Great slow cooker recipe, I altered it in the following ways; Added: 1/2 medium yam (cubed) and 1/2 medium acorn squash (cubed) as well as did a total of 4 cups beef base. Came out absolutely delicious after 9 hours on low (all of the vegetables tender as can be)

Wow, does this make the house smell good! Used lamb shoulder chops....removed the meat and cut into pieces but also added the bones to broth as it simmered and removed later. I also added an extra clove of garlic and extra vegetables. Comfort food at it's best!

It was very tasty! Hubby said he never had a stew which tastes that good.
I cooked it according to the instructions, and didn't change anything. I didn't have red wine though, so I diluted 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar in 3/4 of water - tasted great!

WOW,  this was easy and the flavors are amazing.  I used an Oregon Willamette Valley Pinot Noir which we were going to drink as the wine with our meal.  I omited the cream, my husband has an allergy to cream, so we omited the thickening altogether.  It was a delightful meal full of flavor.  Thank you.

This is so good -- we've had it twice in the last week because it's so good and I bought enough veggies to make two batches.  I had to use beef instead of lamb, but it was still great.  I substituted acorn sqaush for butternut b/c our grocery store only had monster-sized butternuts.  My only recommendation is to increase the salt, pepper, and garlic.  I probably doubled all three.  I'm disappointed we found this receipe so late in the winter b/c I know I'll be craving it this summer.

Good basic recipe.  Because of what I had on hand, I only used squash, celery, potatoes and onions.  I also omitted the sour cream because we are dairy-free.  It was a nice hearty meal!

We substituted venison for the lamb, and this was amazingly good. My nine-year-old daughter who hates sweet potatoes and butternut squash was the first one to clean her bowl! Don't let the list of winter vegetables scare you. I myself refuse to eat sweet potatoes, but I HAD to have seconds. We served this to my parents for a Christmas dinner, and there were no leftovers. This will go on our favorites list, and we will be making this again very soon.

I don't normally like winter vegetables (who decided on the name "parsnip?" It just doesn't sound edible) and my husband and son won't usually touch them; but this recipe was a hit with the whole family. I left out the lamb and served it with homemade dark wheat bread. Excellent!

Oh my gosh this was so tasty!  Although I did tweak it a little to suit my personal taste.  I'm not a big wine fan so reduced it by half and incresed the broth to make up for it.  Not a hug celery fan either so I reduced that by half too.  The sour cream = brilliant!  This dish is so great it'll be a regular this winter!  Added some biscuits on the side for a perfect compliment.

This is very good. I use beef as it is easier to find but otherwise make it true to the recipe. This is much tastier than traditional beef stew with more nutrients too. I find myself craving this stew reguarly, and even my husband who does not like squash and sweet potatoes loves this.
