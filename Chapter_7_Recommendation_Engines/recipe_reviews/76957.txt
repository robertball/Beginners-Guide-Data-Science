this is a wonderful classic chicken soup recipe.  I didn't have a rotisserie chicken but buy them alot so will use this recipe for those leftovers.  I used a whole chicken and skinned it first.  I too did not bother to sautee any of the vegetables first...just added them to the pot.  I added some egg noodles and that was it!  This would be wonderful recipe to follow if one bought one of the flavored rotisserie chickens such as Italian or garlic rotisserie...I can see where boiling the skins and bones of those type of rotisseries would add wonderful new flavors.

Delicious soup base!  I add onions, carrots and a few spices when simmering, and simmer it at least twice as long as the recipe recommends.  And I don't bother sauteeing the carrots and onions before adding the strained broth back into the pot.  (I usually add celery and parsnips as well.)  A rotisserie chicken carcass is such a flavorful way to make this broth!  I get three meals out of one chicken -- traditional chicken dinner, use some of the chicken in stir fry, and then make the soup.  After making this base, I loosely follow the "Classic Chicken and Rice Soup" recipe on allrecipes.

I've tried several chicken soup recipes and this one was by far the absolute best.  The only thing I did differently was that I cooked a whole chicken rather than buying a pre-cooked store-bought one.  We added salt to our individual servings according to personal preference.

Excellent - I add a bay leaf, and hand ful of parsley, and a few cloves of garlic.  For a super simple soup, I just add mixed frozen veggies to the strained broth, throw in a some egg noodles, and dinner is on the table in a flash.

This is a really great soup recipe.  I made it exactly as written and it came out fabulous.  I also used this as a base to make Chicken Tortellini Soup With Zucchini and Tomatoes.  Fabulous!

This is the first time I've ever made chicken soup "from scratch."  I loved how easy it is and it is so good!  A good fix for a quick dinner or for a sick family member.

This was a great way to make chicken soup when you don't have a lot of time.  I ended up simmering for a little longer (about an hour.)  Had leftover chicken from the other night and was not sure what to use it for.  This worked great.  Thanks...will use this recipe again and again.

This is a GREAT recipe, mostly followed to the T but used chicken base instead of broth and way more water I think I ended up using 5 quarts of water and I put noodles in it. YUMMY. Thanks for sharing.

This is (by far) the best chicken soup base that I have tried. There are others that are a bit quicker, but this gives the rich homemade taste you are looking for. I have made it several times and the best way was with fresh, raw chicken breasts boiled in the broth/water combo for about an hour. Remove the chicken meat and return bones to the broth when you add the carrots, onions & celery. (The bones are what gives the soup it's wonderful flavor.) After 20 or 30 minutes when the veggies are soft, remove the bones & add the shredded meat, spices & then continue with whatever recipe you are using. I double the recipe, add a bag of Healthy Harvest egg noodles & salt & pepper to taste. Simply heavenly.

Absolutely the best chicken soup base I've ever made!  I left out the vegetable oil since the skin seemed to add enough fat on its own.  Also added a few more carrots and celery than called for.  Made my own "rotisserie" chicken in the crockpot which saved a trip to the store (make three balls of tinfoil and place in the bottom of your crockpot.  Rub whole chicken with whatever spices and place on top.  Cook on high 4-6 hours depending on size of chicken).  Definitely a keeper.

I love to make soups from scratch but this one, using a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken, is fabulous!!!  I threw in several sprigs of flat leaf parsley in place of the thyme.  Sauteed onions, carrots and celery, using only 1 Tablespoon oil, in a separate skillet while soup base cooked.  Added them, along with chicken, to strained soup then refrigerated overnight to let fat come to top and congeal.  Skimmed fat and added 2 chicken bouillon cubes, 3 cups cooked medium egg noodles and 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley to reheated soup the next day. You could make it as directed and serve the same day but it will be much more fatty. You can't believe how easy and good this soup is!!!

I love this soup; in fact, I'm making it right now for my sick husband.  I also add 2 cans of Grands biscuits - cut each biscuit in fourths, and add about 30 minutes before you plan to serve the soup - yummy!  Then I add the wide noodles and cook according to the package directions.   This was a hit!

The changes I made were minimal.  I added 3 whole cloves of garlic to the base.  Sliced the carrots & celery, used fresh thyme and parsley, used a combination of chicken broth & pinot grigio.
Simple quick to make.  Comfort food at it's finest.

I simmered the bones from the rotissere chicken, including the congealed gelatin. I added some onion and celery tops. After about 20 minutes I removed bones & vegetables and strained. Then I returned broth to pan, leaving the chicken fat and omitted adding vegetable oil. I added the sauteed vegetables (no carrots on hand), chicken, spaghetti broken into thirds, thyme and salt. Delicious!

This is so good and easy.  My parents have always made great homemade chicken soup but it always took forever to be done.  This isn't the same as their recipe but it's definitely a great substitute.

Boy, that was good! And easy. I used 3 tablespoons of Better Than Bouillon/Chicken with 3 quarts of water, and might cut back on the BTB next time because my daughter thought this soup was a little salty. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The rotisserie chicken (traditional) likely upped the salt level a lot too. But otherise, just a delicious soup that everyone loved.

Loved this recipe...used along with her Chicken Noodle Soup recipe, it's absolutely delicious.  I actually used a slotted spoon to remove the chicken bones and sauteed the veggies in a separate skillet to avoid having to drain it all into a colander.  Then I added the sauteed veggies into the broth. It worked perfectly!

I made this with 2 roasted chicken leg/thigh pieces because I didn't want to spring for the whole bird. I rubbed some lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper on the chicken. I roasted the veggies along with the chicken - added minced fresh ginger and parsley later. It was really good!

I really took the base of this as a guideline and changed a couple things. I used only 1 onion, eliminated the celery, added potatoes, put in some garlic and pepper, and boy this soup is so delicious. The base of this is so perfect you can use it to create so many types of soups and it's perfect for using those left over bones!

Great recipe - quick and easy!  In my opinion it calls for a disproportionately large amount of onion compared the celery and carrots (and I love onion).  I ended up using 4 carrots, 4 celery ribs, and 1 and 1/2 large onions.  Instead of thyme, I put 3-4 sprigs of fresh rosemary into the simmering pot of broth/bones, which gave a wonderful flavor in the end.

Very  happy to get this recipe but prefer to chill it after cooking (before adding other ingredients). This mean making it either early in the day or the previous evening but then you can skim off any fat that has accumulated.  Also, we feel it has a better flavor.

Love how easy it is, and it gives great flavor! I've been spoiled. After using this fast chicken soup base, I'll probably never roast a chicken myself for chicken noodle soup!

Very good.  My kids enjoyed it and it's very easy to make.  I threw everything in the pot and simmered for over an hour.  I used 3 chicken breasts bc that's all I had.  And I left out the oil.
I made this again and added a can of Grands biscuits.  Tasted like chicken and dumplings!

Where has this AMAZING recipe been all my life? Forever and ever I’ve been making the long version of chicken soup… making the stock from scratch which would take days.  Not only is this one a timesaver, but it is also infinitely better tasting and deeply flavorful.  I made this exactly as the recipe stated, and used a freshly purchased Costco rotisserie chicken.  While the chicken was still warm, I put on a pair of disposable gloves and pulled it from the bone; took only a few minutes to break it into chunks.  I cooked up some noodles separately and ladled them into bowls prior to putting the soup in.  My DH, who has eaten my chicken noodle soup for years said that this is his hands-down favorite, so needless to say it will go into my regular rotation.  The only thing I most likely will add the next time are a few garlic cloves.  Soooooo good, if I could give it ten stars I would… thankyou Pam!

I have used this twice and it is SO EASY and prefect.
I reverse it and used two quarts of water and one quart of ck stock and just simmer with the bones and skin a little longer than listed on the recipe. I add a carrot, an onion, garlic cloves and a celery stalk along with salt, pepper, oregano and basil to the broth.
After you strain it you just need to add the diced celery carrots and onion and the chicken you have already seperated from the bones and simmer for another 30 minutes (when there is about 10 minutes left I add a cup of egg noodles) and you have totally delicious and super quick and easy soup from scratch.

Loved this.  Such an easy way to make stock.  Let's face it.  Those pre-cooked chickens are so much more flavourful than anything you can do yourself.

I would recommend making at least a day in advance and chlling so you can remove the fat before making your final soup.

Great recipe!

Great recipe, BUT, the carrots and celery did not get soft enough in 10 min., it took more like 20 min. and at that point, they were burning. I would suggest steaming/boiling the veggies first. Also, i think a 1/2tsp of thyme would have been enough. Overall, great flavor.

I think this soup base recipe is awesome.  I makes a novice cook like myself look like a super star.

But c'mon people.  Obviously the whole point of this recipe is using a store bought rotisserie chicken.  If you didn't, and/or you only used the (boring) breast meat then what's the point of commenting here.  You made plain old chicken soup.

This soup is amazing!  I did have a little extra work because my market was sold out of cooked roast chickens.  I bought a cut up chicken and roasted it myself using a rotisserie rub from another recipe on this site (Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style).  I wanted the flavor of the onion but my family doesn't like eating that much in their soup, so after it simmered for a bit, I used a slotted spoon to remove most of the onion which floats to the top nicely.  Followed the recipe exact after that, adding a little pasta and it was delish!!  BTW, I cook my pasta separately and keep it separate until serving so it doesn't soak up all the broth.

This a great soup.  Really love the flavor and the fact that the ingredient list is not overwhelming.  Next time I will probably roast my own chicken (usually the store bought rotisserie chickens have some unwanted ingredients such as MSG or Gluten).

This chicken soup base was fairly good, especially for how quick it was, but I found the onions overwhelmed the taste of the chicken. It's not terrible, but I've had better. Next time, I'll cut back to one onion and add more carrots and celery to balance it out.

I used this recipe more as a guideline. What I did was adding 3 frozen chicken breasts with bone and skin in a crockpot with 8 cups of water. I added 1 onion, 3 handfuls of baby carrots, 3 stalks of celery, 1 tsp of poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp of dried thyme leaves, 2 cloves garlic, a dash of dried basil, and some fresh parsley. I let it cook for 10 hours low in crockpot.

Love this recipe! Its easy and fast and most important; taste like home made! Didnt give it 5 stars cuz of the 1 tsp of thyme, thats too much for me, it overpoweres the soup. Maybe half a tsp, or leave it out should do it. (for me, that is...)

This really does make the ultimate chicken noodle soup! This will be my go-to recipe. However, I did make a few changes, which I highly recommend. 1) cut up 2 or 3 stalks of celery, 2 carrots, and an onion into 3 or 4 pieces and add to water with the chicken carcass. I also added about a tsp or two of celery seeds, 3 sprigs of fresh time and a half sprig of rosemary. 2) Strain the broth, and then dice carrots, celery and onion and continue as the recipe states.

I made stock from my Thanksgiving turkey, omitted peas. Cooked dry packaged egg noodles *SEPERATELY* and added them to the bowl before serving (If you don't you'll get mush).  I added a few pinches of thyme, a tsp. poultry seasoning. a dash of red pepper flakes. YUM

The biggest change I made was that I didn't add the carrots or the celery until I added the chicken. I strained the broth, but was able to keep many of the onions (I used half the amount it called for). I did this so I wouldn't have to do the veggies twice. I did end up having to add extra chicken broth for my recipe, "Classic Chicken and Rice Soup", but I like a lot of broth. I made this broth the day before I needed it. Very, very good.

Excellent base. I used 2 chicken breasts and cut them up. I cooked them with the onion etc. Then added the broth and water.

This is the best soup I've ever eaten, I also add 1 tsp. dried parsley, 1 tsp. dried basil, 1 tsp. dried dill, 1 tsp. black pepper, 1 can northern white beans or white cannellini beans and 1 (10 oz.) box of frozen chopped spinach.  Everyone that has ever been to my house for this soup has asked for the recipe.

I use ground thyme - which give it a wonderful flavor along with 1 teaspoon of rosemary and 2 Tablespoons of parsley.  Since I didn't have celery, I used celery seeds - 1 teaspoon for added flavor.

This was so easy. Everyone in my family loved it. Instead of canned chicken broth I use "Better than Boullion" chicken base and it makes for a very rich tasting broth. If you have never heard of this, you can find in the same section of the grocery store as canned broth, but it is in little dark colored jars.

I had been searching for a good recipe that mimics the real thing without all the work and this fits the bill perfectly. Used a rotisserie and simmered about 1 1/2 hours-added more broth, more veggies and used 1 cup rice-made a big pot of soup. Will definitely make this one over and over.

This is AMAZING! I have never made chicken noodle soup from scratch before, and this was perfect. I used it with the Classic Chicken Noodle Soup recipe. My husband even said it was the most refreshing hearty soup he has ever had! Delicious! (I accidentally bought a bbq chicken, but I think it made the soup that much better! GREAT flavor!)

This was a perfect chicken noodle soup, made even more perfect by how quickly it came together! I had a roast chicken carcass in the fridge from earlier in the week, so I just tossed 3 frozen chicken breasts in the broth/water mixture while the bones and skin simmered. When I strained the broth, I pulled them out and shredded them with 2 forks. I chopped up baby carrots, celery and an onion and threw those in to soften in the broth instead of sauteeing them. Sick husband and getting-over-being-sick toddler son both loved it- my son actually slurped his soup from the bowl for the first time! I can foresee making this a lot this winter, and look forward to trying some of the other incarnations!

Yeah, I feel really bad for only giving this two stars, but it's a great starter, for something truly soul satisfying.   For greater depth, i had fresh carrots, celery, garlic gloves, clove studded onions (you can't imagine the flavor that brings to the broth), fresh marjoram and crushed black pepper, in addition to 1 carton of premade chicken stock. When the all the flavor is extracted from these ingredients, I remove them and then put in fresh chopped carrots, celery, zuchinni and pre-cooked rotisserie chicken, fresh dill and just a dab of honey.  Wholly, molly is this good and simmer for a wee bit longer, serve it with tiny pasta.

This recipe is fantastic. An additional tip: cook your pasta separately and don't add until you are plating the soup, that way the pasta doesn't soak up all the liquid and it doesn't get mushy!

First time broth-maker and this was a cinch!  My husband went crazy for it and knew something was different right away even though I hadn't told him I made the broth differently than I usually do. It only took a few extra minutes and was worth every second! THANKS!!

Extremely easy and quick for a soup base.  I added the onion & carrot peelings as well as the celery base & trimming to the simmering stock for the additional taste and nutritional content.  Used 2 small/med onions, 3 carrots & 3 celery stalks.  Next time, I'll add bay leaf to the stock.  I would use pearl onions if I wanted to get fancy for company.    Using the grocery store roasted/rotisseried chicken is a brilliant idea!

I followed the recipe closely, but for some reason the onion taste was overwhelming. I will definitely make this recipe again, but I will probably only use one onion instead of two. Loved the broth!

What a great idea!  Time saver:  I put the bones and carcass into a clean, unused laundry bag (the small mesh kind with a zipper) then just fish that out when the soup has simmered plenty.  Slow simmer gives a nice clear broth, and a dash of tumeric adds good color and flavor.

Didn't actually make this one, but it's the way I've made emergency homemade chicken soup for years when someone in the family is under the weather and needs soup in a hurry.  I use fresh parsley and no thyme, but the method is the same.  The lovely simmering aroma will make anyone who is sick feel better even before they eat.

FANTASTIC!!! The store-bought roast chicken really makes great stock.  I added to this recipe a Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar when the bones are simmering. You DON'T taste the vinegar in the end and it extracts calcium and other minerals from the bones, making your soup even healthier. After the bones have been strained out I followed the above recipe adding a bay leaf and a little garlic.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT SOUP BASE.  I ALWAYS ADD THE CELERY TOPS FOR ADDITIONAL FLAVOR TO THE SOUP. MAKE EGG NOODLES ON THE SIDE JUST PRIOR TO SERVING SO THAT THEY DON'T GET MUSHY

This is amazing. I only added about 1/4 of a large onion, didn't have any thyme so I added a bay leaf. I also didn't bother sautéing the veggies. It was incredible.

A great base that I used to make a chicken noodle soup! Used my leftover home oven roasted chicken, left over tagliatelli noodles (at very end ,just to warm) and cut up carrots, green beans and broccoli. I prefer to microwave veggies til just a bit firm and add at end. My husband put sweet red chili sauce to season his bowl and my daughter fresh lemon.

I modified recipe to make a low fat version.  I discarded most of skin before adding bones to broth.  I also chilled the strained broth overnight and removed solidified fat from top of broth before adding chicken and veggies.  I added more carrots and celery then called and them simmered for several hours.

This was really good.  I cooked a roasting chicken in my pressure cooker.  I used the left over liquid as part of the broth the recipe calls for (so much more flavor!).  After removing the chicken and juices from the pressure cooker, I sauteed the onions and carrots (didnt have celery) in the cooker.  I added the broth, chicken and fresh thyme back into the cooker along with some uncooked rice.  Simmered uncovered for about 20 minutes to cook the rice.

Super easy, best chicken soup I ever made!  I added 1/3 c Ancini de Pepe pasta to it and let it cook in the broth prior to serving.  I also garnished with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  My husband and teenage daughter LOVED it!

what a great recipe. so much easier than using a fresh whole chicken. I made homemade noodles from this site also, they are great with this recipe. Allrecipes Egg Noodles by Linda..........second batch
I used store bought egg noodles & added 1 1/2 cups of minute rice the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I used a teaspoon of sage instead of thyme. delicious.*****

I'm making a makeover version of Creamy Chicken and Wild Rice soup and needed a quick version of chicken broth to stretch what I already had on hand. Only changes I made was using marked down chicken breasts that I browned well before continuing with the broth, I used extra virgin olive oil, adding a few cloves minced garlic and a few bay leaves along with fresh ground pepper and sea salt. This was a lifesaver.

This is excellent.  Makes a rich full bodied soup.  I made it with a rotisserie chicken and the skin darkened the soup a little too much for my eye. But the flavor was fantastic, I added a couple cups of chicken broth from a box and that "lightened" the color.  Great idea!

Great as is, but excellent with a few tweaks.  I only use 1 large onion (but my onions are huge).  I add half of it (in big chunks) along with the chicken bones.  Also with the bones I add 2 carrots and 2 ribs celery, also in chunks.  All of that gets strained and thrown out with the bones.  I cook that at a low boil for about 90 min, and it adds a lot more flavor.  My family loves this soup, especially with egg noodles.

WOW! This soup is sooo good. I forgot to add the thyme but it is still awesome. I added some frozen peas at the end, parsely and cooked noodles (I cooked the noodles separately and combined them with the soup as needed for leftovers. This way they won't get too soft. I like my noodles al dente). Definitely will make over and over.

This was good and easy. I only used one onion since I'm not a big fan. And after I added the thyme I thought it was too strong so I skimmed most of it out. Otherwise, it made a great soup base.

I had no desire to try this but really wanted to make the tortellini/tomato version on here and decided to follow that recipe as-written. I am SO GLAD I did because I think this recipe is awesome. I personally do not think it is quite so good as an old-fashioned, cooked-all-day soup recipe but it's very close and economical: I will not hesitate to make this when I have a rotisserie chicken in the house. I cut down on the onion (but then that's a given with me) and used a bay leaf in the beginning instead of thyme at the end. I feel browning the onions, celery and carrots in the beginning add a richness to the overall soup so I did do that. I used a ratio of 1:1 for the broth and water and thought the flavor was great, in the future I may try using even less broth/more water. It was odd to have this big, steaming, fragrant pot of soup base on the stove after half an hour, something I can definitely get used to: thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt making chicken soup.  It was good, but a little greasy for my taste.  I think that was because it was a rotisserie chicken.  It did take a bit longer than I expected.  I added all the things I liked, corn, green beans and noodles.

Easy and delicious! The only changes I made was to add a teaspoon of poultry seasoning and a few peppercorns.  I'll use this recipe often.  Thanks for the post!

I wasn't sure what was meant by the word Base in this recipe. I made it exactly by the recipe and all I added was a cup of pasta stars. It was the best homemade chicken soup I have ever made. My family loved it.

I make this every 3 - 4 weeks in the winter months.  Easy, and super tasty.  Just follow the recipe as written and you will have a soup you will love.  I make it as is and freeze in containers.  When it is time to eat you can add rice, noodles etc. or just eat it as it is.  It's the best.

I liked the soup.  However, I would drastically reduce the chicken broth since both it and the store bought chicken have plenty of salt. Also next time I will probably cook the bones and skin longer, perhaps for about an hour, to extract more flavor.

Great Base Recipe...several changes I made:
1)Used bones with meat only-No skins..less fat-doesn't need it for flavor
2) NO WATER-much better flavor without
3) Added 2 extra carrots(halved then chopped) and Sauteed ALL vegetables starting with onions,5', then added carrots and celery, stirring on low-mid heat 15 minutes..this roasts the veggies and adds amazing flavor..I also added the thyme in the beginning.
4) Add Pacific Chicken Stock, boil, add bones, boil then LOW simmer,mostly covered 30'.
5) Strain and discard everything but broth.
Go to Chicken with rice recipe....

I've made this soup twice so far... It's INCREDIBLE!  The first time was good, but the second time I made it was great! 
Here are some things I did different the 2nd time:
1) Let the skins & bones cook in broth 35 minutes
2) Put the skins & bones in a strainer when you're done and collect the juice than runs out from it and put it back in the soup
3) Let the veggies cook longer (they weren't done the first time we cooked this)

I LOVE this soup and will be making it over and over!  Thanks a lot for sharing!

Didn't change a thing.    Love this base because it makes plenty.  With only 3 in our family it does freeze well to. I just thaw  out what i need adding either egg noodles, rice or wild rice according to what we feel like.  So nice in the winter and when we have colds.  I think sauteing  the veggies brings out their color and flavor a bit more.

LOVED IT!   I adjusted the recipe just a tad It called for 2 large onions but I thought that would just be too much so I added only 1 large and I also added 2 tsp of chicken bullioin to help add a little more flavor and insted of sauteing the vegetables in vegetable oil use Olive oils instead other than that it was SUPER YUMMY!!

I cannot tell you how versatile this is and how great it tastes.  I use it as the base for my southern style chicken and dumplings and it is wonderful.  I would never use another recipe.  My only warning is to be careful of some of the flavors offered with the rotisserie chickens.  I picked up a garlic one by accident and the flavor was a little off.  I suggest sticking with the oven roasted flavors.

I was dying for some homemade chicken noodle soup after having some earlier this week, so I used this base for that purpose...    I used 2 quarts of low-sodium broth, bought an Italian Herb rotisserie chicken, which gave it great flavor, and then salted it to taste.  I left out the celery (wasn't the flavor I was going for) and tripled the carrots.  I put in the two full onions even though I was a BIT worried that they would be too much, but after sautéing the onions and carrots (plus a good bit of minced garlic added near the end), the onions just MELTED into the broth.  I added a couple small bay leaves, some basil, quite a bit of rosemary and cilantro, a bunch of parsley (all dry)... Basically a little bit of whatever smelled like it went (that's my "secret" to using spices...).    When my husband tasted the soup, he was a bit shocked... but then he said that the broth was "exquisite," which is easily the best food-related compliment he's ever given me.  Plus, he was SUPER-impressed that I'd boiled chicken bones and skin to give it extra flavor...  Like that was something only culinary masters would think to do, and not something every-day women have been doing for generations... ;)  And it tastes even better the day after!  :)

Excellent and flavorful chicken soup!  I prepared a chicken the day before with a mixture of butter, lemon, garlic and fresh rosemary stuffed under the skin and in the cavity...this definitely gave great flavor to my soup.  My only additions were a little extra bouillon, and some pepper.....I added extra wide egg noodles - but left them separate to be added when serving to avoid mushy noodles.  Great, great recipe!

...and I used to throw all the left over peices of chicken and skin away-never again!!! This is fabulous! My daughter was home sick today and I figured today would be the perfect day to try making homemade chicken soup! I used this broth (with a little extra water and extra carrots minced) and then added a bag of egg noodles. VERY GOOD SOUP! So full of chicken flavor and not as salty as canned soup! Looked, smelled and tasted terrific!!!

I used a store-bought garlic roasted chicken and it was fantastic! This soup was so delicious! We are having leftovers for lunch today. :) It took every ounce of self-control not to eat the chicken before I could get it in the soup. I'll never make chicken noodle soup any other way again!

This was such an easy and great tasting chicken soup. The flavor of the roasted chicken made it wonderful. I also added some whole garlic to the pot yum!

I had always used a similar base when fixing soup dishes, the only thing I altered was the veg. oil.  I have always used butter instead to give a richer taste and color, but overall this is a very quick alternate but with just as much taste as making from scratch!

What a great way to stretch a food dollar!  I buy a pre-cooked chicken at the grocery store 2 or 3 times/month...I love being able to use "all" of the chicken!  We usually eat the chicken, I reserve the carcass/skin in a plastic bag in the fridge, then the next day pop it on the stove as written to make the delicious broth.  Any left over chicken from the night before gets chopped up and added to the broth at the end.  Thanks for sharing!

I tried this recipe because I felt my mom's chicken soup was too bland.  She was even there while I prepared it and commented on everything I was doing "wrong".  Boy did she eat her words...literally!  This was excellent!  I used some ideas that other reviewers suggested, and it was excellent.    I used 1 large can of low sodium broth, one can of regular, and 1 can of water and put my roasted chicken in it.  I didn't sautee the veggies (carrots, onions and celery, I just put them in the broth after I removed the chicken to debone and it was excellent.  I LOVED IT!

I have never made homemade chicken soup before! This was excellent.  I used the leftovers from a store bought cooked chicken.  (About 1/2 the meat was left.) I made the recipe easier for me by just throwing in all of the leftover chicken with the vegetables. I froze the soup base in freezer bags later adding 1 cup extra wide egg noodles to 2 cups frozen soup base. This is great as it is but so many other possiblities are out there!

What a great way to make "homemade" chicken noodle soup...you'd swear it was made completely from scratch! Everyone I've made it for loves it...I don't think you can mess this one up, even a novice cook can make it easily and will end up with an impressive meal.

gave it 4 stars for execution, 5 stars for taste!

To make it much easier, I sauteeed the veggies first, then followed directions straining out bones and skin. No need to pour out contents into another big bowl!

This is the only way I will ever make chicken soup again! The first time I made this I used leftovers from "baked slow cooker chicken" and the second time I used a store bought rotisserie chicken. This would also be a good starter for chicken and dumplings and leftover turkey.

I remember my Mom making chicken soup this way as a child, but there was always something missing in her version. I think the addition of the boullion is key here and really adds a nice dimension to the "from scratch" taste.

I buy thighs only, skins on.  I simmer them in water to cover, a stalk or two of celery and some sprigs of fresh rosemary and salt.  I then remove the chicken and spent veggies from the pot and let the thighs cool.  I add them to the stock later. The meat just falls off the bone.  I then toss in some frozen veggies...whatever tickles your fancy.

This was fantastic! I made it pretty much according to the recipe, although I probably used more carrots and celery. I didn't measure.  I didn't used water because i like it strong.  I'm using 2 48oz broth boxes. And I forgot to add noodles.  It was so good I didn't realize it until I went back for seconds and saw the bag sitting next to the stove.  Oh well, next time.  It's the first chicken soup recipe I've tried, and this is exactly what I wanted. 2nd time - I added about a tsp of black pepper and about 1/2 tsp white pepper, still no noodles.  Next time I think I'll simmer the bones longer and see what happens.

I love this recipe also. Felt a cold/flu coming on yesterday.  Had some in the freezer, heated it, sprinkled finely chopped garlic on top.  Felt much better!
The flavor is amazing w/out garlic on top...this was put on for it's anti-bacterial properties.

Made this soup tonight on a chilly fall evening. Followed the recipe exactly and just added egg noodles at the end. Boiling the bones and skin gives it a delicious flavor. This is a new standard!

I use this all the time.  Only differences, I add mushrooms to the onin, celery, carrot, and include sage, bay leaf, (and at the end, parsley).  I also lightly carmelize all of the veggies, starting with the onion.  Then, by the time I lightly carmelize the carrots (added last), the other veggies really have carmelized, making a dark, flavorful broth.  I buy the frozen Resen noodles to add.

Worked very well as a chicken soup base and using the rotisserie chicken saves a ton of time! I would recommend using only 1 onion though and doubling the carrots. Otherwise, great recipe!

I made this for a relative on his way home from the hospital after having experiencing heart problems. Due to his dietary restrictions I used No Salt added chicken stock. I did not add any salt or pepper at all. Instead I seasoned it up with some poultry seasoning in addition to some fresh thyme. I loaded up on the veggies and added a few cloves of garlic. I also used a garden vegetable type pasta, just to boost the nutritional value. It was very tasty! I did miss the salt so I will just grate some Parmesan cheese on top and maybe add crackers. I really think he'll enjoy it, and I feel good about what's in it.

Love this!  I use it any time I use the juicy roasted chicken recipe on this site.  Chicken for dinner, then I use all the drippings from the pan and the bones to start this recipe for the next day or for freezing.  Yep, it's got some fat in it that way, but the flavor from the drippings is worth every drop.  Don't know if my grandma made chicken soup or not, but if so, I bet it tasted like this!

This is my first review and first time making chicken soup by "scratch". I made it because my boyfriend is sick and he loved it! I followed the directions completely, except that I only used one onion. Also, I added fresh rosemary and a bay leaf to the broth. It turned out amazing!

Amazing! Only changes I made were that I added two cloves of fresh garlic, 1/2 tsp of season salt, and a bay leaf to the bones and skin boil. Then, I ended a cup of macaroni in at the end. Will make again and again.

this has very good flavor. My husband has never been a huge fan of soup (any soup), but he does like this for chicken noodle soup.

i agree too much onion, and i like more celery and carrots. would be 5 star for me with those changes. this is FANTASTIC flavor, i found the chicken broth/water ratio fine; i like Swanson Organic Low Sodium broth in a box.

This was s reasonably quick and pretty good soup base, however, concerned about the high fat content, I made some changes.  I did not put the chicken skin into the pot - only the bones and whatever chicken was left on them.  Also, when the broth was done simmering and bones were removed, I cooled the broth and skimmed the fat from it before using it for soup.  I don't  know the exact fat content after removing the visible fat, but my guess is that it is a significant reduction.

Excellent recipe for soup base.  I use 4 or 5 carrots and celery stalks (to balance out the ratio with the onion).  I do cook the vegetables before putting them in the pot, I think it adds more flavor to the broth.  I added parsley, oregano, basil, and 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I freeze this soup base and pull it out as I need it, then just add some peas and egg noodles.   Thanks for an easy and fast solution to making a great homemade pot of soup.

This is an amazing soup base and it was easy and fast.  I will be making this over and over again.  Followed the recipie exactly and had lots of base. I now how enough Chicken soup to feed an army, so next time, I may cut it into a 1/3 and use it to make different things.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and easy. I used it with the classic chicken noodle soup recipe on this website. I only did a couple things differently. I did not use 2 whole onions. I used one and next time I won't even use a whole one. I also did not saute the onions, carrots, and celery. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This was pretty good, not the most delicious or flavorful soup base that I've ever tasted. I think I was a little turned off by the chicken carcass boiling in the broth.

This made a really great broth and was quite easy to make.  The only change I made was only putting 1/2 teaspoon of thyme because we aren't that crazy about it.  I will most definitely make this again.

This is a great base and never fails me.  It's quick easy and once you add your favorite chicken soup ingredients its terrific.  I always use garlic, 1tbls. and add alot of celery, onions, and carrotts with just a small amount of white rice.  I only use low fat boullion (no water) and it comes out great every time.  Good for what ails you old fashion chicken soup!

Oh so good!  I added 2 cloves of garlic, a few sprigs of fresh thyme and a few bay leaves to the simmering stock.  Once it was all strained and I was ready to add in the veggies, the broth still needed something, so I added black pepper and a few shakes of poultry seasoning.  Way yummy!

This recipe was very tasty and easy to prepare. I used low sodium broth and I added whole-wheat noodles at the end. The roasted chicken added a ton of flavor. Next time I will omit the skin to cut down on the oil in the broth.

I stopped by my local grocery store late last night, and saw they were selling off rotisserie chickens for a buck a piece. I nabbed the last two. Bargain! Of course, nothing beats homemade chicken broth, but this was a fantastic substitute. I'm not a huge thyme fan so I used an Italian herb blend instead. I also threw in a small diced potato. With some additional seasoning (pepper, a little salt, and garlic powder) this turned out much better than I expected. Next time I'll add pasta and some canned corn to make it even heartier. Thanks!

Fantastic. I won't entirely give up on making my own base from scratch because I don't like to waste left over roast chicken, but this is certainly a delicious time saver. It makes homemade soup a lot more convenient which means we'll have it more often.

Absolutely love this! I take what is leftover from a rotisserie chicken and make this base all the time.....talk about economical. The soups made from this base taste so authentic, such as you would expect from a restaurant. Really glad I came across this recipe. Thank you!

Wow!! This was just wonderful. Very tasty. It smelled so delicious while cooking, I couldn't stay away from the kettle :) I usually like to switch things up, try new recipes, but I will never use another recipe for my chicken soup. Thanks for this family favorite.

Okay, to be honest, I haven't even added the noodles yet! All I know is I went upstairs to put away some laundry while the broth, veggies and chicken were simmering, and when I walked out of the bedroom upstairs I was deliciously assaulted with the most incredible aroma! I immediately went over to the stove and spooned out some of the broth. OMG! Yummy!!!! I can't wait until dinner!

Simply fantastic!  I just came across this recipe and it was just what I was looking for.  The perfect soup base for my chicken broth recipes that I love so much.  I used this soup base with meat tortellini last night.  I plan on using it for my chicken noodle soup recipes as well.  Thanks for a great simple recipe.

Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the roast chicken but the flavor was still pretty darn good. The house smelled so good. Good base. Used celery seed instead of chopped celery and frozen chopped onion as a timesaver.

This is a terrific chicken soup and so very easy to make.  Using the rotisserie chicken is a great idea. I did not use the thyme as we do not like the taste.  Instead I put celery leaves in the broth while cooking.  Next time I make this soup I will use 2 1/2 qts chicken broth and 1/2 qt water.  I felt a quart of water gave it a little bit of a watered down taste.  Just love easy recipes like this one.  Thanks for sharing!!

Quick and easy with a rotisserie chicken, but bland with spices in the recipe.  Add more spices and it is great.   Keep it low sodium.

So, I made this with two leftover, baked Cornish game hens.. If chicken soup helps you feel better when you are sick, then this recipe probably adds years to your life. Delicious.

Easy peasy.  I used powdered chicken soup base, added some frozen vegetables and fresh garlic and left it to simmer gently on the stove for a few hours and it was awesome!

Followed recipe exactly and it's delicious.  My grandson loves this.  He texted me this recipe when I was keeping him for a while so I could make it for him.  He was 11 yrs old at the time.

I cooked this chicken soup as the base for matzo ball soup, and it was delicious! It turns out that I didn't have quite enough chicken broth, so I supplemented with bullion cubes.

Thanks for a great recipe. It was great. Even my husband liked it!  I may make it with rice next time instead of noodles - gluten free. Love your site. Always easy to follow, and short cuts are appreciated.

SUPER YUMMY- This recipe is awesome! Simple yet delicious AND the perfect use for your leftover rotisserie chicken. I followed the recipe but added a couple of mushrooms just to use them up and a little bit of fresh parsley. It was the best chicken soup I ever ate. Like the title states and others mention in their reviews, you can use this as a base and add any additions you see fit. I will keep making it as is since I'm not big on noodles etc in my soup. PS I made the Sourdough Drop Biscuits recipe from this site and they went together rather well :)'

Yes, this works great. Also, you can make a smaller amount with two raw chicken thighs. Just cook until they are done. Remove, debone, remove skin, add meat to whatever soup or other recipe you're making. I picked up that trick from the allrecipes' UK site - same method.

Making my own broth allows me to add more flavor and control the fat content for a heart-healthy recipe.  I doubled the recipe, then after refrigerating it to allow the fat to congeal, I skimmed off the fat and spread the broth into a 9 x 13 pan and froze it.  Then I could cut it up into large squares and freeze them individually for future use.

Used new bone broth as base for soup. Also used barley.
Soup was yummy, but a little salty. Needed something quick to feed a cold!!
Thanks for the recipe.

It's very difficult to find low sodium soup and this one does not disappoint. We followed the recipe and added a little no salt to enhance the flavor. What a great chicken soup!!!  It's exactly what we needed on this chilly winter evening. I highly recommend for those watching sodium. If you are not, you might find it a little bland.

Great base! I bought a rotisserie chicken for dinner and saved the carcass.  I used the bones and skin as suggested in this recipe and even though I only had half of the meat it was still enough for a delicious soup. I simmered the broth longer than written in the recipe. Excellent method to use up leftovers or to just make chicken broth!

We had smoked two chickens on Sunday; the chicken was fabulous!! I knew I had cheese tortellini, and wanted to make a chicken, tortellini, and zucchini based soup.  Found a recipe that requested making a Fast Based Chicken soup.  I used the leftover smoked chicken, and all I can say is WOW.  I will use this based soup for all of my chicken based soups from now on.

The more thought I put into my soups, the less I like the end result. With that being said, I threw this together exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out absolutely Fabulous! Simple but oh so good... Maybe it was just dumb luck? who know's, but I will return with fingers crossed to make again and again.

Family loved the recipe and we are definitely going to making it again come autumn. Next time we would add a little more salt and pepper, but that is a personal preference in my opinion. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made it exactly as is and thought it was delicious.  I didn't add noodles or rice, but either would work if you want a thicker soup.  Our whole family enjoyed it with a side of beer bread.

This has been my go-to chicken soup starter since I found it in a Sunday USA Today magazine about a dozen years ago.  As is it's okay soup but the idea is that you make this as a BASE and then add your preferred veggies, herbs, pastas, or whatever enhancements you choose.  It's a great place for all those dabs of veggies that got leftover from a meal and it lends itself to any variations I can dream up.  I even start with this base and then add a pound of any kind of greens, a pound of spinach, puree it all with a stick blender, and then add the chicken.  That "green" soup sustains me in the cold, dark winter days.  You need to make this soup BASE and then let your imagination soar.  You won't be sorry.  Oh, and it freezes well too.

I love this recipe and so does my family!  It makes a lot and it makes great leftovers as well.  My granddaughter asks for this when she comes over.  I usually make it ahead.  I add vegetables and noodles, but it is good no matter what you do to it.  When it has been sitting with noodles, I sometimes add more chicken broth.  It is so good!

Simple and easy. Loved it. Used butter for sauté the veggies and of course salt and pepper TT. Added baby bok chou for a twist at the last min. Quick water bath and it's good to go. Spinach and peppers near the end as well.

Taste like home made broth that simmered for hours. Add quality egg noodles. Use fresh organic carrots with green tops for best flavor. Family loved.

Recipe was all good except for the oil. I used some turkey that I had previously smoked. And good thing I omitted the oil. For me and my family it was just right.

Very clever shortcut.  I thought it was a little bland though... I added a bag of frozen peas and carrots to it and added some egg noodles.  Not bad, just a little bland.

Best soup I have ever had.  My whole family pays us a visit when they hear that I am fixing it.  I do adjust a little.  Instead of a quart of water, I just add an extra quart of chicken broth.  Also, I use ground thyme but only 1/4 teaspoon because the ground is a lot more potent (I actually had to use this by accident because I got the ground instead of the dried, but I like better now since I have done both ways).

Very good. Like another reviewer I also add garlic, bay leaf. I also add cauliflower(I used to put in small flowerettes to slip more veggies to my kids) I also add sage because I grow it and I have TONS.

Absolutely excellent and quick. Eating it as I speak. We however added extra carrots and celery to the mix but the best addition was the white pepper and cayenne to taste. -Gives it a nice light burn.Extra time also does the trick. Serve with warm, toasty sour dough bread with a bit of butter on the side.

Boiled a fresh chicken today to make chicken soup and added thyme and veggies as stated in the recipe and WOW--now I know thyme has always been my missing ingredient!  Love this simple, healthy chicken soup and will make again!

Quick, easy AND yummy!  I didn't have 2 quarts of chicken broth on hand so I used water and boullion cubes for half of the broth  I also used what was left from a roaster I made the night before....   I just followed what it said, then added some noodles and some curry powder and now have a keeper!

Wonderful full flavor soup using 1/2 the time and effort! The pre-roasted chicken makes prep easier (no need to wait for chicken to cool before de-boning) and it gives the broth an added flavor boost (especially if using a garlic or specially seasoned roast chicken). I received many compliments on the chicken soup. I did add 2 bay leaves as suggested by another cook.

The fast chicken soup base is really the key. You can really taste the thyme. I added sea salt. It is the best chicken noodle soup I've ever made/tasted.

This quickly makes awesome soup.  I have four children under the age of 11 and a husband and I can make two meals from this recipe.  I just freeze half for another day.  It is awesome.  freezes great and tastes just as good the next time.

I've made this twice, and each time it has come out fantastic. The only problem is that it's tedious to take off all the chicken from the carcass, but well worth the wait! Amazing flavor.

Fast, easy, and so yummy!  I add fresh ginger and whole garlic cloves and red pepper flakes to give it some heat.  Now, if only I didn't have to pick that chicken apart...that grosses me out, but it's so worth it!

Great stuff!  I bought low sodium broth. I save chicken bones and skin and leftover chicken remains in the freezer,  and then just dump then into the broth and simmer for 2 hours.  YUMMO.  Didn't bother with celery or carrots or anything, and it was delicious!

Quick and easy need some chicken soup now recipe!  Boiled one cut in half onion, fresh parsley and two bay leaves with the chicken bones and skin, and discarded all after straining the broth. I added some dried dill, black pepper, a little bit of salt and fresh chopped spinach along with the carrots and celery. Better the next day.  A keeper!

This base is the best & easiest ever! Soincredibly tasteful. I've made it for the Classic Chicken Noodle Soup recipe 4 times, & my family just loves it. It's such a great comfort soup on a cold night. Too bad summer is coming!

I love this base instead of a can of chicken broth!!  Do not simmer the chiken bones and skin longer than 1 hour or 2 as it can get very oily!!  I do simmer the veggies for a few hours and it's awesome!  I've used this for all chiken based soups including Matzo ball soup!  It's so great.  Also can be frozen!

this turned out great...i didn't make it how it was suppose to be made due to my own stupidity!  LOL!  i miss read the ingredients b/f going to the store and ended up bringing home a frozen whole chicken.  this would have been ok if i hadn't started making this b/f realizing i was suppose to have bought a pre-cooked chicken..duh!  at the point when i realized my mistake i had already deboned a raw chicken (what a pain!)and was boiling the bones/skin in the water and stock.  i ended up sauteing the chicken pieces before throwing into the completed base.  it worked out and turned out great, but i will try the easy way next time. ugh!
