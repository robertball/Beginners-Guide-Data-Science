This recipe is the best!!! My boyfriend loves it we eat it at least once a month. I don't have any children but less the sharp objects I think it would be easy for them to make. I don't have proper deep frying equipment or I am sure it would be faster. This recipe is awesome and tastes great!!! Thanks.

My mom soaks everything in teriyaki sauce for several hours before blotting dry and dipping in batter. Better.

Everyone in my family loved these! and I have 5 kids all with different opinions on which food they like. I used chicken tenderloins. About an hour prior to making these I put the chicken in a mixture of minced garlic and Italian dressing. It gave the chicken some good flavor under the breading. Thanks for the recipe!

I made my own tempura batter using the Crispy Shrimp Tempura recipe on this site and I threaded my chicken separate from the veggies just in case it ended up taking longer than the veggies to cook. Great as written if you have a sauce to dip it in but if not, I recommend adding some dry rub to your chicken to give it more flavor. The possibilities of this recipe are endless and I just might try it with shrimp next time. Thanks for sharing LOVE2COOK2!
