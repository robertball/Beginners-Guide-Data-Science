I decreased the sugar to about a tbs. and ended up adding some more water to make the dough pliable.  My empanadas turned out well.  Make sure and roll your dough out well, so they aren't too thick.  Thanks!

We blend 1T butter with 6T shortening with 2 knives, then follow these directions.  Our filling was a mixture of shredded chicken breasts, onions, hard boiled eggs, green olives, cumin, chili powder, chicken bouillon powder, bay leaf, paprika.  Topped with sour cream and salsa.

Good texture, but much too sweet.  Would be good for banana empanadas.

I tweaked it a fair bit, so the rating is for my revised version.  Reading the other reviews was very helpful. I reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon to counter the complaint that the dough was too sweet.  To counter the complaint that it was too dry I cut in about 6 tablespoons of lard and 2 of butter to the dry mixture.  Then I mixed in the water and egg yolk.  The dough needed to have a lot of flour added before it was workable.  It baked into a light flaky crust.

This recipe is by far the best and has sent my mouth back to my younger days! I've tried over seven other recipes and was disappointment on the brink of giving up I stumbled across this one. I'm happy I didn't quit. Reduce sugar like other reviewers suggested.  I used 3 tablespoons. It's not so sweet. Trust me it makes the dough yummy as heck! Also add 6 table spoons of butterflavored shortening to the flour mix. Cut it up in small parts until it is crumbly. Oh boy you won't be disappointed. The dough isn't dry and if you have a large family like mines you will be making these for after school snacks or even lunch for a few days! Thanks for 
sharing such an amazing recipe. Add full sugar if you are filling these with sweets. It's a must try.

I used 1 Tb and 1tsp sugar. Had to add a little extra water. Took a LONG time to make. Turned out very good. Needed less time to bake the empanada, maybe about 25 min.

Delicious! I've made many empanadas and generally use the "cut the butter into the flour" variety of dough. Decided to try this instead and loved it! I mixed in my Kitchenaid mixer and added 1 T of water as dough seemed too dry to come together. Then kneaded with a bit of flour until smooth. Rolling into jelly roll, slicing 2" piece and rolling to 5" circle worked perfectly and was easier than fighting with dough that wants to shrink upon entering cut. Recipe as written made 12 empanadas. Baked at 375 for 16 minutes. Took about an hour from beginning to on the table. Will definitely use again.

I knew it would be on the cracker type side because I didn't use any butter at all. I just rolled out the ball until I couldn't roll it out anymore and just cut out circles. Filled them up pretty packed of beef and crimped the edges with a fork, they fluffed up a bit but none of them exploded or had anything seep out. I used egg whites on the edges that I crimped with a fork, and egg yolk to brush on top for color. I read the other reviews and used 1tbsp of sugar and it was just right, not too sweet or anything. I liked how the dough tasted and its' consistency with the filling I used (ground beef, onions, garlic, tomato, oregano, and some flour). I will be making this again and I'll be making double this because it was only enough for like 10 empanadas :)

I cut the sugar to 1 Tb as someone had previously recommended and added some Adobo seasoning.  This dough turned out flakey and light which is perfect for our taste.  Thank you for the recipe

I make this all the time, and stuff it full of all sorts of things. Sometimes for heartier meat pies Iâ€™ll reduce the sugar and use half whole wheat flour. The kids love it!

I made these for the first time. I used our air fryer and Turkey meat.  They came out good but kind of dry. Next time, will cook per instructions and use pork.

I left the dough for about 30 mins after rolling into the circles so that I could prepare the fillings, and found it much easier to work with after resting it. Beforehand it was very elastic and quite tough. Afterwards it rolled easily and I could get it much thinner. I'm not sure whether it would work even better if you rested it before doing the buttery jelly roll thing? In the end I thought it was very nice, but don't really see how rolling it with the butter helped? I assume it was supposed to make it a bit flaky but it didn't really seem to.

I really like this recipe. I stuffed mine with a mixture of chicken, 3 cheeses, onion, jalapenos, and spices. The sweetness mixed well with the other flavours. I fried mine because my husband prefers EVERYTHING fried. The texture was very good. I will defiantly use this again.

I made the recipe and then read the reviews. I wish I had read the reviews first because I agree that there is too much sugar.  If this dough was being used for dessert then I would leave the recipe alone but for a savory meal I will definitely cut the sugar way down!  All in all the recipe was well received by kids and husband!

The dough to have fun with. I filled them with Pepperoni and Mozzarella, mouth watering!
