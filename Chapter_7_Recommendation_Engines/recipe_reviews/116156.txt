I made this dessert for Easter and it was a hit.  I took the advice from previous reviews and added cool whip to the cream cheese mixture. DELICIOUS!  I added pineapple chunks and sliced kiwi.  It was beautiful and tasty.  I did not use the glaze.  It was superb all on its own.  I did offer a drizzle of chocolate syrup to anyone who wanted it on their own piece.  This was a real crowd pleaser.  Easy to make. I will make this again soon.

We like the shortbread crust on this recipe. I added about 1 cup of whipped topping to the cream cheese mixture and topped it with strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, and pineapple. A winner!!!

This is excellent!  I made it for a birthday party at work and everyone wouldn't stop praising me for being such a great cook.  They made me promise to email the recipe to everyone tonight.  It stuck to the pan (I used a pizza stone) after it was refrigerated, but I let it sit out for about 4 hours before serving at the party, and that did the trick.  It came out easily with a pie spatula.  I cut it after cooling with a pizza cutter and brought it to work on my pizza stone - don't even think about moving it from the baking pan to a more attractive serving platter because it is far too fragile for that.  But with care, and leaving it at room temperature for at least a few hours, it will serve perfectly.  The glaze was far more than I could fit on the pizza, so I made a big bowl of fresh strawberries, rasberreis, and blueberries, and tossed it with the remaining glaze.  Was soooo YUM!

I made this for a jewelry party and all my guests loved it.  The only modification I made was to add banana and kiwi to the fruit topping.  Great Recipe!

I found a very similar recipe in one of my cookbooks, but the base was slightly different (1 1/4 cups flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 3 TBS icing sugar, 2/3 cup soft butter... use a mixer until it comes together into a ball), and it called for 1/4 cup apricot or marmalade jam (I used apricot preserves) mixed with 1 TBS water and then pressed through a sieve for the glaze. Instead, I warmed the preserves in the microwave for 20 seconds until a little looser and mixed in the water. I let it cool for a couple minutes, and then brushed it over the fruit. Much quicker and very tasty!

I love this recipe!!  I always make my own sugar cookies for the base and I also skip the glaze (although the glaze is very good!).  This is one of my favorite recipes.

This was my first fruit Pizza and it was a HIT!  Everyone loved it!  I was worried that the crust might be bland and soggy..had to cook a little longer to get perfectly browned.  It was the perfect texture and sweetness.  I will be making this again.  A wow presentation.

This turned out great and had people asking for the recipe! I doubled the cream cheese spread as suggested by other reviewers. Left everything else the same. Perfect!

ummm...I guess I am the oddball here because I did not care for the crust. It tasted like, well, flour and sugar. Not like a cookie like I was hoping for. But, the rest of this recipe is great. I like the cream cheese layer and the glaze is nice. Really you can use whatever fruit you like, and even though it looks like it took forever to make it is very easy and fast to make. I think I will try again with a sugar cookie crust, yes, the dreadful storebought kind.

As one reviewer suggested, I used strawberries, mandarin oranges, blueberries, kiwifruit and bananas. I soaked the bananas in a solution of Fruit Fresh and water beforehand to prevent browning. I was tempted to buy sugarcookie dough pre-made, but the reviews convinced me otherwise --- and I'm glad! Everyone at the potluck raved how good it was, and said the crust was teh best part. It was worth the extra work, in my opinion. Delicious!

Easy, delicious and impressive! I used lite cream cheese and added a tub of lite whipped topping as others suggested. I used parchment paper on the pizza pan which made for stickless-removal of the pieces which I cut with a pizza cutter. The only problem was trying to transfer the pie to a serving dish. It started to break apart, so I just left it on the parchment paper on the pan. Not as "pretty" but just as yummy! I followed the picture for fruit, but didn't use pineapple. For those other novice cooks...advice: start laying the fruit from the OUTside in. I did it the other way and had to redo it because it was lopsided :-)

I made this in a cake pan so that it would be thicker and more like a fruit tart. Tasted wonderful. I put my own fruit though, not what the recipe calls for and I skipped the glaze the second time I made this. Doesn't really need it

This recipe was great! However, I made a tart rather than a pizza (I shaped the shell by molding it to a circular cookie cutter), and I'm glad I did, because the crust would have been too crumbly for a pizza. Also, I didn't use the glaze and it turned out just fine.

I loved this recipe. Made way too much pinapple glaze but the small amount I did use complimented the dessert well. I honestly think I would have loved it without as well. Even better the second day.

I tried this recipe  exactly as written. The crust was perfect, it was not crumbly, the cream cheese topping was superb, and I took advice of another comment, and did not use the glaze. The guests raved over it. Good thing I made 2 of them! I have 3 requests to make this again soon!

The cookie recipe was a little heavy, so I think next time I'll try another shortbread recipe.   I made the cream cheese topping with the added cup of cool whip and was very pleased…went over well for my daughter's 11th birthday party.

This has fast become one of our very favorites! Start with the buttery, sweet cookie base, then the creamy vanilla-sweet center, and finish with the fresh fruit topping, this dessert satistfies the taste buds! I did not use the glaze as I didn't have the ingredients on hand, but it wasn't missed at all. A great hot weather dessert!

I followed this recipe exactly and my son and I absolutely loved it!  This needs to be eaten immediately, because on day 2, the crust got soggy, which was very disappointing.  The flavor was wonderful though.  Very refreshing!

This is the exact recipe that my mom started making over 15 years ago. It is still at every family gathering, and there are rarely any leftovers. This is such a nice variation to the regular fruit pizzas that have a thick sugar cookie crust.

Very good. I made mine in a tart pan and everyone thought it was made in an upscale bakery. I did put on bananas and kiwi also and it flew off the table. Everyone was salivating over it.

I thought this was awesome- I made made 1 1/2 the recipe to make sure i had enough for my pizza pan. I followed the recipe exactly for the crust and filling but used a different glaze recipe (warmed apricot jelly with a little water to thin it out) and different fruit. Things I would change- I dont think I would use bananas again since by the end of the night they started to look a bit brown, even with the glaze. I also would make sure to keep this cold and remove from the fridge just before serving. Personally, I think it tastes better at room temp but the filling and fruit are a bit soft. Overall- AWESOME recipe and I will make it again! Its simple and attractive and tastes GREAT!!

I did like this...   It is a shortbread crust rather than a sugar cookie crust.  My family prefers the sugar cookie crust.

I've made this recipe for a few family events, and it has been a hit!  Love the shortbread crust in the place of the sugar cookie crust.  It adds a more subtle flavor and great texture to the overall effect.  I didn't use the glaze on it because the cream cheese mixture and fruit are great without.  Wouldn't change a thing!!  I've already been giving out the recipe since all the family raves about it and wants to make it themselves--and my daughters fight over who gets to put the fruit on.  Superb!!!

I have made this dessert several times in the past year, and I ALWAYS get rave reviews on it.  Last weekend I brought it to a dinner party and I was barely able to get the last piece since everyone wanted seconds.  The crust is not too sweet like some of the recipes that use sugar cookies as the base.

The shortbread crust was a hit! i actually couldn't try it myself (operation bikini) but everyone said it seemed like a really posh tarta de fruita. I didn't have cool whip so i  made whipped cream and folded it into the cream cheese- yummy! The only thing i will change next time is making the crust a bit thinner- can't wait for OB to be over so I can try it myself.

Making individual Fruit pizza's for a Ladies retreat with the spread and glaze.  Plan on using soft sugar cookies from the store and top with Slice of Kiwi, Strawberry & a few blueberries.  Can't wait to try this out!  Looks yummy.  Out of all the recipes I have looked at this one seemed the easiest and most appealing.  Will rate it fully after the retreat.  Thanks for the recipe.  These turned out awesome.  I made 75 individual pizzas.  I used the hard sugar cookies from a package and made them up just before leaving for the retreat.  When we had dinner (3 hours later) all of them were soft and perfect to eat.  They would probably have a great flavor with Gingersnap cookied since they are usually hard after baked.  Thank you so much for the great recipe...

This was awesome! I used half whole wheat flour, margarine instead of butter, lowfat cream cheese and whipped a tub of light cool whip to the cream cheese mix like some others had suggested. I also used pineapple pieces instead of oranges but this is such a versitile recipe- I think any fruit would be great on this!  I skipped the drizzle, it was so good already, I was afraid it would be too much.  I am making this again as my family ate the whole thing in one sitting.  Warning: this will make you forget your diet!

This is delicious. Every time I make this it disappears in no time and everyone requests me to make it again. A great summer dessert! 

I  do cut back on the glaze on top because I'm not into the "gelatin" texture. But I do a thin layer and it's great and helps hold everything together.

We loved this recipe.  I added a cup of whipped topping to the cream cheese mix and omitted the glaze (it really doesn't need the glaze, and it cut out some of the mess). The amount of fruit listed in the recipe is perfect, with the addition of a sliced kiwi.  We especially liked the shortbread crust.

I have made this 2 times I add some Kiwi for some green color and it is a huge hit!  Simple to make but to do it properly you need to bake the cookie crust at least an hour before assembling the rest as the cookie must cool.

This crust is the best I have used for this dish, so flaky and delicate!!  tweaked the fruit a little and used the juice from the can of oranges and the can of pineapple. then used strawberries,kiwi,blueberries.  Perfect for the 4th of july cause I made mine look like a flag.

Why haven't I discovered this recipe earlier??  I served it at a party and my guests LOVED it.  Even my mom approved!  The only thing I did differently was to add 8 oz cool whip and replace granulated sugar with powdered sugar in the topping.  Drizzled with melted chocolate, it was beautiful!

I absolutely love this dessert!  I love the crust, but skipped the glaze. I covered the strawberries and blueberries with about 2 tablespoons of sugar before arranging them on the pizza to take away some of their tartness.  I pressed the crust in a circle on a baking sheet because I don't have apizza pan and it worked perfectly.

This is delicious.  It does take some time.  I am not a "fast" cook and it takes me about 1.5 hours start to finish.  I have made about 3 times and get rave reviews every time.  The crust is delicious and way better than any store-bought sugar cookie crust!
