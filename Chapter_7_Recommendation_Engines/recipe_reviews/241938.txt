I tried it, and it was delicious! only instead of just baking it covered, I baked it for 20 minutes and then broiled it on high uncovered for an additional 10 minutes. I also sprinkled some chili powder and paprika spice on top of the vegetables.The fish came out juicy and the vegetables crunchy.

This recipe was good. Next time I would like all the veggies cut in smaller pieces. Also, I would prefer more seasoning and adding some garlic. A good healthy recipe though!
