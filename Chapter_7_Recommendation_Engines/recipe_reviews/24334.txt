I've been sitting here trying to think how to rate this... It's better than I could ever describe. Five stars doesn't do it justice. I made this for my wife when she came home from work and she raved about it... raved more than she has about anything I've fixed so far. Since there was only the two of us for dinner, I only made half of the recipe and I think either one of us could have gobbled up the entire thing.  So next time, I'll make twice as much.  I couldn't find frozen pearl oinons so I used fresh ones from the produce dept.  I put them in boiling water for three minutes, then cooled them in cold water before attempting to peal them.  That made the onions easy to peal. That also cut the extra baking time back down to the 50 minites for the fresh onions.  I used Ritz Crackers because that's what I had on hand.  After following the recipe exactly, I sprinkeled a light top layer of garlic bread crumbs over the top of the crackers just for the extra seasoning.  The finished product was better than I could describe!  I think I could fix this every single day and never tire of it. Thank you Sara for the best side dish I've fixed yet!

The recipe did not specify fresh or frozen onions. I used fresh and had too cook it much longer, which in the end caused the cream to separate. This had a good taste to it I did add a couple of garlic cloves. Next time I will par boil the onions first.

this is one delicious recipe.  i couldn't find frozen pearl onions.  it would have been nice because peeling those little suckers wasn't easy.  after having read the other reviews i steamed my onions first...till tender and then followed the recipe from there.  i will make this again.  thanks.

This was delicious.  My husband had eaten all of the "buttery round crackers" secretly, so I substituted saltines and left the salt out of the recipe.  After baking, I sprinkled some crumbled garlic croutons over the top.  I'll serve this wonderful, rich side dish again!

having had something extremely similar to this several times, I was excited to try out this recipe. I did alter it slightly by making a roux to thicken the sauce, and followed other reviewer's suggestion of simmering the cream with a crushed garlic clove and some bay leaves. The only thing that seemed off when the recipe was on the table were the onions themselves: they were like little oniony water balloons. Kinda yucky, and several of my family members commented on this. They were, however, sopping up the sauce with dinner rolls as it was excellent.  I don't know if it would have helped to thaw the frozen onions first, or pierce them with a fork before baking, maybe? Next time, I might use thich slices of vidalia or something instead.

Such a yummy recipe my entire family loved it and went back for more!  I used frozen small whole onions (like pearl) to save time and it turned out great. Can't wait to make it again at Christmas.

I made this today for Christmas dinner with a standing rib roast and Yorkshire pudding.  It was the perfect accompaniment.  This was so good.  I made the recipe exactly as written, only thing different was I raised the oven temp to 400 for the last 20 minutes, but just because my oven was slow and everything else was almost ready.  Will make this again for sure!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was incredible!  It is extremely rich so I will not be making it on a regular basis but is great for holidays when you don't mind the extra calories!  I usually make creamed onions with cream of mushroom soup so this was a nice treat.

OMG we just loved this!  Being an onion lover, I am always looking for new ways to cook onions.  This really didn't come out the way I expected, but it certainly made a beautiful presentation and was a treat for the holidays!  We totally enjoyed this one!  Thanks :)

I already like pearl onions, so it was pretty good, but very heavy.  I could only eat a little bit with my main meal.

This is a little tedious to make because of the peeling of the onions, but that doesn't take any points off for me. With such few ingredients, most of which you probably already have on hand, it is a very flavorful dish. I served with chicken cordon bleu, but it would go good with pork or beef as well!

This is a great onion receipe.  My husband doesn't like any onion dishes but he loved this.  Every time I make it for company they all love it and ask for the receipe.  You don't have to use pearl onions - vidalia or sweet onions will do just as well!!

This was really, really good.  I used frozen pearl onions and added a few extras.  I simmered the cream with 2 bay leaves, one clove of garlic (peeled and smashed), chopped fresh Italian parsley and a dash of nutmeg for about 10 minutes.  Discarded the bay leaves and the garlic and proceeded with the recipe.  All these years I have been using the typical cream of celery condensed soup recipe and it pales in comparison.  I'll never go back now that I have this recipe!

FANTASTIC. I used fresh peal onions and followed package instructions (par boil 3 minutes, rinse, cut both ends and peel outer layer off) then proceeded with recipe exactly as written. I made it in a gratin dish and it looked positively inviting. It didn't disappoint! Served it with a cross rib roast and mashed sweet potatoes (the combo of this dish and the mashed sweet potatoes was out of this world on the plate) for Christmas dinner.

Excellent.  I have been looking for this recipe or Thanksgiving for years.  This is the keeper.  Because of space issues in the oven, I had to bake it the night before, reheat in the microwave then freshen up the crust with a few more crackers and butter for a last crisp in the oven.  It was the first dish to go.  Even my 10 year old loved it.  I will also try adding some garlic for an Italian flare during the year.

Phenomenal!
So simple and absolutely fantastic! Made it to accompany steak and my husband couldn't stop talking about how great it was. I added a little garlic and used white cheddar cheez its for the topping. Thanks!

Update: Made it again and used Ritz crackers... not as good as with the white cheddar cheeze its (to us)... still great!

Made recipe exact...using frozen onions. These were very good and reminded me of ones my Grandpa used to make. I will reduce the pepper next time as it was a little too much for my personal taste, but very yummm!

This dish is SO awesome..  I've made it for Thanksgiving the past several years and finally joined Allrecipes so I could rate it. It's top notch, savory, creamy and just absolutely to-die-for.  I use fresh pearl onions and then boil/shock/peel as I have never found frozen - but the results are always A-1.

YUM!!  Halved the recipe for my husband and myself, but wanted to make it a complete meal so w/10 minutes left of cooking time I added some thawed pre-cooked shrimp (seasoned w/salt, pepper, and garlic powder) and poured a little more milk and butter over it; then served it over brown rice.  It was SO good.  Thanks for the amazing & simple recipe!

I began making these for Thanksgiving 2007.  My husband and brother-in-laws' families have always had onions at holiday dinners, and mine did not.  They asked for some on the table, and I had no idea what to look for in a recipe.  I was so fortunate to find this one!  This recipe hit it out of the park!  The first time I made them I par-boiled a TON of pearl onions and popped them out of the skins.  I have come to find that the men didn't even noticed when I made the switched to jarred onions.  Rich & delicious...

Absolutely WONDERFUL!! I have never made nor had anything like this and I couldn't get enough! I brought this to a pot-luck and when I went back for 2nd's I got a little of some of the other things so I wouldn't look like a wierdo getting more of what *I* brought! Very easy and although I tend to change recipies I followed this exactly but did add the crushed garlic croutons on the top like one of the other members suggested. YUMMY!!!

My family loved this...and it was very simple.  I would recommend half the amount of crackers, as it becomes really thick (i used about 10 or so crackers and it still was somewhat thick).  I gave this 4 stars because it is really greasy in my opinion...which was to be expected given the use of heavy cream (which I had on hand) and butter.  When I make this again (which I will), I think I'll use half and half or light cream.

I followed the directions exactly but we just didn't like this... is was extremely dry and had very little flavor in spite of the large amount of onions.  Sorry.

This is a delicious recipe.  I followed Rookie's advice on the onion and the 2nd time I made it, I used 1 cup less of ritz crackers.  This has become a requested dish for Thanksgiving in our family.

I highly recommend this recipe.  We loved it.  It isn't what you think, it has a little bit of a sweet taste.  We used frozen pearl onions and it was perfect.  I didn't change a thing!!

Wonderful!!!!!! Have had this recipe the unhomemade way for years (using jarred onions and white cream sauce packet) but I must say this was 10 times better then the other stuff.....Will definately make again The only thing I might do differently is add more cream to make it a little creamier.

I made it ahead of time.  Instead of heavy cream I used evaporated milk & flour to make a rough.  Then added onions and baked just before serving.  Awesome !

Used fresh baby onions blanched for 1 minute and then skinned.  I also made a white cream sauce with 1/4 C butter & 1/4 C flour, using heavy cream and added some ground nutmeg.  To put it over the top, add about 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese.  Don't add too much because it make sauce to thick and sticky.  TDF.  This is the best ever

I and my daughters are onions lovers. I can tell you we didn't like this at all. The overall flavor was bland from the cream to the crust topping. If you like onions with milk, then this is for you. I'm sorry, I won't be making this again.

These were ok but they we really sweet and they didn't absorb the cream so I had a cracker crust on top of pearl onion soup- maybe a little bit of flour would thicken it.  If I were to make them again I might season the onions with some cayenne or chopped fresh garlic to make some spice to cut the sweetness because it really was too sweet.

I only had 2 cups of onions so I added a bunch of asparagus I had to use up before it went bad, chopped in 1" pieces. And I found my box of Ritz crackers empty in the cupboard, so i had to use a couple handfuls of crushed potato chips on top. Threw a sprinkling of shredded parmesan on top of that. Turned out rely good. If I had added cubed ham it would have made a great main course.

I was a little concerned about the mix of seasonings, but it is a perfect medley with the cream. A great hit in my house, nothing left.

I've searched all the "creamed pearl onion" recipes and chose this one.  Great recipe, easy to do. I followed "Rookie Cookie's" advice and used fresh pearl onions instead.
Highly recommend. It came out perfect!

Very tasty and easy to make. Best when eaten fresh while the cracker top is still nice and crunchy. Can't help but prefer the Creamed Pearl Onions recipe though, because the sauce is so, well... creamy.

Served this dish with veal marsala & basmati rice for dinner last night.  The aroma was wonderful but the dish was a little too bland.  Used fresh pearl onions; blanched then rinsed in cold water for easy peeling.  If I make it again, I'll try the small, yellow onions for stronger taste.
