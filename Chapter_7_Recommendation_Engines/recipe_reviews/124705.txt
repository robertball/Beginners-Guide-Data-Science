Everytime I have made this recipe someone has asked me for the recipe. To make it good you need to add salad supreme to it. Without it the recipe can be bland.

I made this with Penne instead of Spaghetti as my 2 year old likes to be able to "stab" his food with a fork.   It was defintley a keeper.  My wife also really enjoyed this and she is a slightly picky eater.

I brought this to a potluck and received rave reviews!  Unlike other recipes of Spaghetti Salad on this site, the addition of the ham, pepperoni & cheese really makes the difference.  I omitted the avocado and olives (personal preference), seeded the tomato before chopping, and only used 2 Tbsp of red onions (more than that would seem to override all other flavors).  I added 1 tsp of olive oil to the boiling water & immediately put cold water on the noodles when they were finished boiling to prevent them from sticking together.  For the dressing, I used Good Seasons Zesty Italian dry mix (where I added the olive oil and balsalmic vinegar -- great fresh flavor -- I bet Red Wine Vinegar would be great as well).  Be sure to make the night before so the flavors will meld.  Before serving, toss the noodles again to evenly distribute the dressing and veggies!  Who knew something so easy could taste so good!  I'll try with whole wheat noodles next time!  A recipe keeper!

Very tasty, I also used zesty italian dressing mix with balsamic vinegar.  Used whole wheat pasta as well.  I sliced the peppers thinly, wouldn't recomend doing that, dice everything equally!

I like this version of a pasta salad.  I added extra veggies - broccoli, peas, fresh mozzarella.  Big hit when I was camping.

Not bad--a quick, very easy meal.  Took me about 10-15 minutes to make, which is wonderful when you're hungry.  I didn't add raw onions because neither of us like them, and didn't add olives bc bf doesn't like them.  I tossed in some frozen broccoli while the spaghetti was boiling.  We use the Italian seasoning packets to make Italian dressing, and bf made a packet and we used a little over half of it for the salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

This salad is very tasty, just a bit hard to mix up with the spaghetti noodles.  But also fun to eat them cold.

This is good, but I don't like the dressing settling on the bottom, so I used rotini pasta instead. Sometimes I use mozzarella, but most of the time I used grated parmesan cheese. I don't like the texture shredded cheese gets after it's been sitting in dressing. It's also good without the pepperoni, and I've also used cubed ham in it. It's really versatile!

Didn't have the avocado it called for, but it was good. For the onion I used green onion, sometimes red onions are too overpowering. I may try this w/French salad dressing - sounds weird but I had it somewhere like that once and it rocked. Update: Tried it with mostly French and a little Italian (for the seasoning) and it was great!  Try it - our company raved about it.

This was ok.  I made it for a baby shower, and it was good, but it wasn't a hit.  The deli spaghetti salad tastes better to me.

I crave this salad during the summer when the tomatoes and cucumbers are ripe out of the garden!  I usually make it without the meats and I'm not a big avacado fan, so I leave that out, too.  Either way, it's delicious!

This was awesome!!  I made it by memory and I accidently forgot the onion, but it was still great.  I used light Italian dressing and it worked just fine.  I didn't add the avocado, because I bought it too late and it wasn't ripe.  I will def make again and add it though.

This was really good, I did not really measure, I just added as much of the ingredients as I thought looked good.  The only thing I omitted was the onion.  I added some Italian seasoning for a little added flavor.  Next time I think I will add parm cheese as this has more flavor than mozzarella.

Super yummy!  I made with halved cherry tomatoes, I diced up a block of mozzarella so you get a better bite than shredded, sprinkled a handful of shaved parm, and used Olive Garden brand Italian dressing.  it was excellent.  I will definitely make this again and again.  next time I will try tortellini for the pasta.  but thin spaghetti beats the standard rotini that this kind of salad usually is made from.

While I gave this 4 stars, my husband would have given it a 5. Just my taste I guess! Per other reviewers I made the following changes: Made w/ dry Italian dressing mix & balsamic vinegar. Added frozen broccoli to the last 4 min of pasta boiling. I think next time I'll add cauliflower as well.  It tasted better the next day, but visually it wasn't as appetizing.  Will put it into rotation!
