This chili may be a bit more labor intensive than the standard ground beef or ground turkey chili I often make, but it is so worth it!  It is very very delicious and filling.  I served it over baked potatoes, topped with a little sharp cheddar, and a side of cornbread muffins.  The only thing I did differently was to decrease the cayenne by half because I was concerned too much heat would bother my toddlers.  I really recommend trying this yummy recipe!!

Delicious! A little spicy, and it could use more meat, but overall, the flavor was great!
