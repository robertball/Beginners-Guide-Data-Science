This is a nice alternative chicken casserole to all those heavy mayonnaise/cheese based dishes.  Savory, yet hearty, this easy recipe should please the palate and satisfy the hungriest of family or guests.  It is not the most eye-pleasing dish, nor is it too flexible in terms of additional ingredients, but if you are in search for a fairly-simple and tasty meal, this is a good one.  We usually use fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned and serve with an extra green veggie or salad.

We are not that fond of sweet potatoes but had a can I wanted to use. This recipe was great and enjoyed by all four of us. We would make it again

We love sweet potatoes but didn't love this recipe.  Odd sauce - too greasy.

I used chicken breasts with the bone, and cream of chicken soup.  I made this for the family (Husband & 5 children), then left for a meeting.  I also made peas as a side dish.  They all seemed to like it.  I ate some leftovers for lunch today (just mixed the peas right in) and it tasted great.  Isn't my favorite chicken recipe, but I may make this again for my family.

Flavor is "spot on".  I used fresh rosemary from th flower bed, fresh sweet potatos, and much much more of them than the recipe called for.  But it was still lacking more side features.  The chicken was very flavorful.  It just seemed like I could have laddled this over something.  But what?  (not another starch!) There was quite a bit of soupy liquid.  I will try this again, my husband loves sweet potatoes, but his only exposure was candied.... at the holidays. His palate is expanding! (I am liking them more now myself)

Just not a fan.  The sweet potatoes were VERY soft , especially in comparison with the dry chicken breasts.  I thought it was heavy on the rosemary and light on the salt, too.  Made with fresh sweet potatoes and some adjustments to spices, it would probably be alright, but there are a lot of recipes that are already very good so I don't think I'll bother.

I used fresh sweet potatoes and skipped the oil but as good as this sounded it turned out pretty uninteresting.

Just made this yummy dish. I am a casserole lover and this dish is very filling. I little greasy. I would not use oil and substitute Pam spray. My husband does not like the texture of celery and onions. Nor does he like green pepper. I ground them in a chopper and cooked as directed. He loved it! I baked biscuits and poured everything on top of the biscuits.

This recipe was just okay.  Since my family only gave it 3 stars, I won't be serving it again. (I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if available.)  I served rice with it, which was a nice side dish for soaking up some of the stock.  Only changes I made were to use fresh sweet potatoes and fresh rosemary.

This dish was a great way to combine chicken and sweet potatoes. The spices work well and reminded my husband of holiday dinner. I am going to try this with turkey medallions and see how that works.
