Great recipe, Kim! Since I found this one, I'm saving a dollar for every box of jello I used to buy! I cook for many older folks who love softer foods. This one is great and very versatile. Any flavor of fruit juice can be substituted. Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious, fresh and spritely tasting. Also, it has a more 'realistic' fruit color - no day glow here! Used fresh squeezed oj (and zest). Had cream cheese and whipping cream left over from the holidays so I made a topping for it. My husband liked the gelatin so much he asked me to leave off the topping next time. Going to try some other juice combinations. Thanks so much for sharing, Kim! YUM!

Oh my goodness! Fantastic and perfect with simple whipped cream on top. My kids loved this too. I think you could reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup (to 1/2 cup for the recipe) and still be just fine with a bit of tartness.

Really great recipe. My family enjoyed it.  The only changes I made was to use xylitol as my sweetener  and Trop 50 Orange Juice since my husband is diabetic. We really enjoyed this recipe and will be making it again.

Everyone loved it. I made it as is with freshly squeezed orange and lemon juice, but excluded the zest to save time.

great base recipe! didn't have OJ but used a Swedish Elderflower drink. only pu tin the lemon zest and added juice as per volume required. Reduced sugar to 1/2, but will reduce to 1/4 or none as Elderflower doesn't have the acids of OJ. Will make again and with other juices!
