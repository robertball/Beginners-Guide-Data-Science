Easy and healthy! I have made it about 4 times now and completely eliminate the butter. I double the recipe and make it in a 9x13 pan and then again double the applesauce to eliminate butter - so I add 1 cup of applesauce. Then I add lots of cinnamon and use vanilla soy or almond milk and about 1/4 cup of chia seeds. Delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!!

EASY recipe and lots of compliments at our church breakfast potluck. I doubled the recipe and it easily fit into the 9x13 pan. Also, I used twice as much applesauce as it called for, added cinnamon for extra flavor, and cooked it a few extra minutes. Success!

This made my whole house smell so good!  I added a 1/2 tsp of cinammon and a few handfuls of chopped pecans for some protein.  I also baked it in a 9x9 square pan instead of a 9x13...it seemed much too thin to spread evenly in the larger pan, and I like my baked oatmeal to be a little heartier and thicker. This recipe was great, as I felt like it was healthier than others I've seen that call for 3 times the sugar and butter.  It didn't lack in taste though - was delicious with a cold glass of milk (and didn't taste like I was eating dessert for breakfast).  Hubby and I will eat on this for the rest of the week - thanks so much!

If you follow the recipes with no portion adjustments it's too little for a 9x13 pan. The first time I made it I doubled the recipe the next time I placed it in a smaller pan. Both times we loved it.  I think this has become our new standard baked oatmeal recipe.

I used brown sugar instead of white and added dried cherries apricot and blueberries. I also used left over homemade applesauce made from Macintosh apples. It is delicious!

Baked this in an 8 x 8 pan, which is correct size for this quantity.  Used 1/2C unsweetened applesauce & 2T butter instead of the 4T butter.

SUPER easy, incredibly adaptable, and DELICOUS!!  I made it 50-50 white and brown sugar (will prob. go all brown next time), added raisins and cinnamon, and, as suggested, baked it in a 8 x 8 square Pyrex pan.  Topped it w/more applesauce.  Next time might add yogurt!!  YUM!!

Thank you for a great base recipe.Recipe is very good with no alterations to the ingredients or you can personalize with nuts, fruits, spices etc... I agree with other reviewers comments on size of baking dish. 9 x 13 is too big. We used a smaller dish.

Great way to use up the unwanted applesauce and oats sitting in the back of the pantry!  
This was a great, easy-to-make breakfast recipe, however, I made a few changes myself:
1) I cut down on half the butter and added a little more applesauce.  
2) I was actually out of milk, so I used apple juice instead, which added to the sweetness and apple flavor.
3) Used less sugar than listed and used honey in place of the white sugar.  It was still pretty sweet.
4) Added a few pinches of cinnamon for more flavor.
5) It is definitely too small for anything more than an 8x8 in. baking pan, which is what I used.  It did need to bake a little longer than 30 minutes, though.

This is a great treat to make and turned out better than I expected.  It also keeps well in the fridge for leftovers.

I made this as written plus 1t cinnamon & used old fashioned oats as I didn't have quick oats on hand.  I thought it was dry.

I have probably made this a dozen times in the last six months. Great way to feed a big family on a dime and make it taste good. It is five star worthy as written.......however.......I totally leave out the butter and it is great. I have made it with flax milk and it comes out great. I have added chocolate chips (omit the cinnamon when you do this) and it comes out great, ditto for dried cherries and dried cranberries. I think raisins are over rated so I refuse to try it that way on principle but it is probably good. My hubby likes to drizzle maple syrup over it when it is done and swears that it tastes great that way. Very easy recipe to double, just put it in an 8x11 and it still cooks in the same amount of time. I always use old fashioned or extra thick oats so I have no idea how those thin instant things would come out in this recipe.

I had some applesauce lying around ever since I got my wisdom teeth out in December, so I thought I'd try some baking with it.. What a yummy snack and it's so easy to make! I added some cinnamon because you can't have apple without cinnamon. I found that this recipe fits well into an 8x8 pan and I cut it into 9 servings instead of 6. Really handy for a quick snack when you're studying or writing essays! 
My one complaint is that even with the added cinnamon they are slightly bland. Easy to fix, just add a drop of honey on top when you serve it for some additional sweetness. These are so comforting and soft to eat, I will definitely be making again (maybe adding some frozen berries or honey to the batter to add some flavour?) because these will be good to have on hand as a quick pick-me-up.

I was a bit disappointed that the applesauce didn't add more flavor but this recipe is definitely worth tweaking.  I will be trying bananas next time! :)

This recipe gets completely lost in a 9x13 pan!  great recipe, but use a MUCH smaller pan or double (or triple) the ingredients. I added cinnamon & diced apple, which was great.

Definitely will make this again.  Used an 8x8 pan without doubling the recipe.  It worked well as other reviewers recommended.  Also doubled apple sauce to 1/2 cup and skipped the butter.  The bars were moist and soft, and my 18 month old gobbled it up!  :)

Substituted honey and pure maple syrup for the sugar, then drizzled a little honey on top once it was done.  It baked to a nice consistency and was delicious!  Think I'll try adding blueberries next time.

This is a fast way to make oatmeal for my family.  I'm allergic to eggs so I substitute 1/4 apple sauce and 1 tsp baking soda for the egg. Since the recipe already uses applesauce it tastes great!  I also throw in some raisins if the mood hits me.

Delicious BUT Does NOT make a 9x13 pan! 

I put it in a smaller oblong pyrex ( guessing 6x9?) and it was still pretty flat. If you put this in a 9x13 it would be as flat as a crunchy granola bar and fall apart. 
 
I will double the recipe even in the smaller pan so it doesn't fall apart ( had to eat in a bowl). . Stayed together better after refrigeration. I would quadruple it atleast in a 9x13. 

I added 1 tsp cinnamon as well, it needed it.
