This was delicious and a big hit with my family!  I paired it with curry chicken.  The only mistake I made was using Jasmine rice.  The Jasmine Rice is too sticky.  I recommend  Long grain.  I tweaked the recipe and used a combo of raw nuts and "cashews" which was suggested by my neighbor and glad I did.

This was EXCELLENT! The curry leaves were optional and I left them out due to personal preference. I can't say enough good about this recipe and for the record, I'm not a huge fan of rice, love peanuts but typically dislike them inside my food, and a little bit of turmeric goes a long way. The results with this recipe shocked me. The roasted peanuts and everything else combined  is absolutely incredible. 5 stars all the way!
