Iâ€™m not sure why this got some bad reviews because the recipe worked great for me. I omitted the fresh garlic and found that the powdered garlic alone provided plenty of garlic flavor. I think the ratio of wine to beef broth was perfect. Just keep in mind that newer crockpots require less cooking time.

This was wonderful! The meat was tender and tasty and the sauce made it perfect yo serve over brown rice. I added mixed veggies and a homemade roll for a great winter evening dinner.

This was very easy to make and turned out great. I made it in my slow cooker using four bone-in short ribs that were especially meaty as opposed some I've had which were mostly fat. Anyway, I followed the recipe exactly and the resulting dish was excellent.  We still have some left over which I'm going to turn into open face beef sandwiches later this week using the leftover sauce as the gravy commonly found with that type of meal.  Should be even better since the flavors will have fully melded.

I made these in my instant pot, so instead of 5 hrs the meat cooked in an hour. I also used cornstarch to thicken after removing most of the liquid into a pan on the stove. They were very tender and delicious and the sauce doubled as a light gravy!

YUM!!  Cooked exactly as directed, but I would say to cut the amount of salt rub you need.  I used more beef than the recipe called for, yet needed only half the amount of seasoning  to coat the meat.

Loved the recipe, for my first time making short ribs.  We did  make some changes.  After browning and removing the ribs and meat,  we added carrots, celery, and onion. cooked til onions were soft.  Started following recipe again but added 4 sprigs of thyme.  We made a gravy and mashed potatoes to serve the meat on.  Amazing and easy.

This is a great recipe for those who like bland food. The meat was fall-apart delicious, but it lacked flavor. I will try again adding different spices.

I added extra garlic, used homemade bone broth and it was only so-so. I would only use again with significant additions.
