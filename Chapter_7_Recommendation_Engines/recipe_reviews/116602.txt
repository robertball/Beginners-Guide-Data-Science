This is the most wonderful potato soup I have EVER eaten. The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I did make a few changes. I combined this recipe with my own recipe for potato cheese soup and the results were amazing! I boiled the potatoes, onion,and about a cup of carrots in chicken broth. After the veggies were tender, I added 2 T cornstarch to a little of the milk called for in the recipe. This thickened it up just right. I brought this to a bubble again, took it off the heat and added the bacon and one pound of Velveeta. Put the lid back on and gave the cheese some time to melt. Next time I will probably leave off the salt called for in the recipe as the bacon and chicken broth were salty enough. Absolutely fabulous!!!My oldest son doesn't even like my original recipe and he LOVES this! Thanks for sharing!!

This was so delicious! I have to make a double batch every time I make this now because the guys just gobble it up! They told me to just make a vat of it. :) I used red potatoes, because that's what I had on hand and didn't bother peeling them. I also used a cup of chicken broth as another user suggested. My boyfriend requested that I leave out the celery from now on because even after sauteing it in the bacon grease first, it never seemed to get soft enough. I omitted the salt, because the bacon adds enough saltiness for my tastes. I will probably increase the bacon by another couple strips because I can't seem to keep people from munching on it while I'm cooking, and I like to add a little more (along with shredded cheddar cheese and chives) on top before serving. Thank you for the great recipe! It's a keeper.

delicious soup..Like the reviewer ahead of me, i added a few things.  I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth with some finely diced carrots.  I also added red pepper to the onion and celery mix.  I put all the bacon in the soup and put grated cheddar cheese on top before serving. I have made this twice and the first time i put some canned corn in the soup.  Overall a delicious soup. very easy to double it.

This is a keeper.  My husband has requested I make this for my mother-in-law when she visits. I make a few minor adjustments as well. This is one of our favorite "2fers."  By this I mean I make it as breakfast first by frying bacon and then potatoes, onions and green peppers (homefries).  I make alot so that I will have left overs. Then I make a 2nd meal by taking the left over potatoes and bacon and making this soup.  I also add a dash of cayenne pepper and corn.  Yummy on a cold winter day.

This was a really tasty soup, but I like a lot of texture. Add 1 cup frozen corn, some diced carrots, and chopped green pepper, and it makes a huge difference.

The reason for the 4 stars is when I think of Chowder I think of beginning with a roux. I rendered the bacon and sauted the onion and added garlic, then added flour until almost doughy and cooked for about 5 minutes or so. I then added chicken broth and cooked until thickened. Boiled the potatoes and then added them to the broth mixture. I finally added heavy cream. Yummy!

My mother used to make this recipe when I was a child and it was always one of my favorites.  We always used cream-style corn, but not sour cream.  This recipe is perfectly fine; however, I still prefer cream-style corn.  Also, if the brand of cream-style corn is not particularly sweet, I add a touch of sugar.  Sounds odd, but it makes the flavor.  Total comfort food!  Thanks!

This potato soup is so good! It was easier than most other recipes and tastes better!  The taste of the creamy sauce is so good I kept going back in the kitchen for "little tastes" while it was simmering.

great soup! Even my husband who in general dislikes any soups asked me to add this recipe to my box, and cook it more often. I followed suggestions and added bell pepper to the onions, and I also omitted the celery. I also shredded the onions and peppers instead of dicing.

very good.. i made my own cream of chicken, because i prefer it that way, and used canned potatoes, because i had already been cooking another dish for three hours so i was aloud to be lazy.. and we didnt have sour cream so i used plain yogurt. everything else i did based on the recipe. it was lacking something. honestly though, i usually prefer making my own cream of soups but for this recipe, i think i should have just used canned, because it wouldve been a little creamier, like i wanted, and a little more flavor that i said earlier it was lacking. but i blame it on myself, so this original recipe is a 5, mine was a 4..

I resisted the urge to add this or that, like cheese or chives, etc as that would have been a completely different recipe and I wanted to review it fairly as it was written.  That said, it was good, but I do prefer potato soups with cheese and chives, our local dairy made chip-n-dip, but this was good as written also and I figure that I saved calories by not adding some of that other stuff so maybe I don't need them as much as I thought.  Thanks for sharing!

I was not very impressed with this soup. It was very tangy because of all the sour cream, I also thought that it was not too thick. I would slightly mash the potatoes, and put around half a cup of sour cream. With that the soup would be great!

The only thing I do different is I cook the bacon separate and serve it in a bowl on the table because my family and I don't like soggy bacon. So we sprinkle it on too and mix it in. But this is the best Potato Chowder soup I make

This soup is definitely worth making. It tastes amazing and is great for colder weather. I followed the recipe except I doubled the amount of potatoes and left the soup heated on low for a few hours to thicken it more. Great recipe

This was a huge hit with the family! They all loved it, as did I. I used turkey bacon instead of pork, so it had less fat, but it still tasted great. It had a great consistency and there was the perfect amount of ingredients. I would suggest this recipe for a hungry 4-5 people! Made more than I expected, which was great. Next time I would omit the celery, but that's just a personal preference. Great recipe, five stars!! :)

Have made this recipe many times already and it has gotten rave reviews from the family!  I made this again tonight and tripled it so that there would be leftovers.  More than tripled the potatoes (made 10 cups), celery, and onions (4 cups each) because I like chunkier soups but kept the other ingedients the same (3 cups sour cream, 3 cans cream of chicken, and 5 1/4 cups milk, and 24 strips of bacon).  I can't even eat O'Charley's loaded baked potato soup anymore because compared to this, it has no flavor.  Mmm, can't wait to finish off the leftovers tomorrow!

Had a nice flavor, but needed thickening (cornstarch) and next time I will add more potatoes and use chicken broth instead of the potato water

Very good recipe even with my few changes.  I did use chicken broth instead of water.  I used low fat half n half, sour cream and cream of chicken soup....always makes me feel better when I'm eating bacon because I will only use the real stuff when it comes to bacon.  I do have my standards after all...I also added some fresh garlic and diced carrots to the skillet with the onions and celery.  Sprinkled with some shredded cheese, chives and bacon to serve.  Yummy stuff here - thanks Jacque for sharing your recipe!

I thought this recipe was OK.  It was too thin for my taste, so I added additional potatoes to thicken and also some corn at the end.  I think I'll stick with my Corn/Bacon/Potato Chowder recipe from "Joy of Cooking", which is essentially the same but uses all milk (no broth or canned soup) and has more corn/less potato than this recipe.  However this recipe showed me I can play around with the potato and corn proportions based on what I've got on hand and still get a successful soup.

Very easy and delicious.  I used  lower fat soup, sour cream and fat-free  half & half.  I served this for my superbowl party and it was a big hit.  I'll definately make this again.

In place of the cream of chicken soup, I use 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and instead of milk, I use half and half!

Made a double bath to take to a family who was going through a hard time.  It was so comforting for them to enjoy.  For the double batch I used a 1# package of bacon and halved the sour cream (1-1/2 cups), other than that it was exactly as written.  I'll make it again next time for myself.

I was pretty impressed by this chowder, it tastes amazing! I added carrots and boiled them with the potato in a cup of chicken broth as others had suggested. I minced the onion to insure no one got a big piece of it while eating and because frankly im not a big onion fan. I encourage anyone reading this to try the recipe, its well worth the while. Also take the advice of another reviewers advice- add the 2tbs cornstarch to your milk before adding it in if you want a thicker chowder. As a side note, it took me longer than 30mins to put this dish together, which was fine with me but allow for extra time. (If you are quick at chopping, slicing and dicing you might be able to pull of 30 mins but i really doubt it).

This chowder was quite good, I cook for three people who all have extremely different ideas of what is good is; one hates vegetables, one thinks that chinese food os a food group and the last only likes plain potatoes and broiled chicken. all three loved this soup.  I gave it four stars because I found it to be a little too salty.  I added a touch of sugar to counter act the salt but next time I will grab low sodium cream of chicken soup instead.  Previously I tried this with melted velveta cheese to make it a cheddar potato bacon soup (as per another review) and that was quite good as well.

This soup was simply wonderful.  I added a chopped carrot to the other veggies and some shredded cheese on top.  It was probably the best meal I have every made!

was so delicious but has definite room to grow. I made it exactly as called except sprinkling a little cheddar cheese onto each bowl. It was creamy, flavorful, and filling! I think next time I will omit the celery and trade the CO chicken soup for CO celery soup.

Recipe was very good.  I left the celery out and added a little bit of shredded cheddar to the top when serving.  Only mistake I made was not cooking the onion long enough.  I will definitely make this again.

Made it just as suggested.  It was a hearty filling meal, but could have used a little more flavor.  Maybe next time I will cook the potatoes in chicken or vegetable broth instead.  Will make again.

This soup is excellent. I prepared this recipe as written with 1 minor change leaving all of the flavors present. Which I don't believe really changes the recipe, just the source of a particular flavor.  I don't use celery or have it on hand so I substituted the salt with celery salt, so not to add additional salt to the dish. It was perfect. Definitely adding to my collection.

I doubled the recipe and it went well with a few suggestions from other readers.   I cooked the potatoes in water, but drained them and added the chicken stock.  I added a red pepper which gave it a nice flavor and some cayenne pepper for a touch of heat.  The only thing I found - and maybe it was because I doubled it - it could have used more potatoes.  But the flavor was good.  I used low calorie chicken broth, and no fat sour cream, but did go for the 1% milk as I feared it would be too thin.  It was really good!

This was a great soup for a cold rainy night. It was a fast meal to the table and had great flavor. I was out of celery so I used some celery seed and celery salt and used dried chopped onion, about 2T worth. I did use 3 cups potatoes since I only had 1 potato left and wanted to use it up. While this was hearty and good on it's own, a big helping of some shredded cheddar made it even richer and better tasting. I used precooked bacon so there were no drippings in this. We all enjoyed this, thanks for sharing, it was a great meal!

Very, very good.  I'd vote 5 stars but for the fact that I think the results would have been bland made exactly as specified.  I didn't use C. of Chix soup because its full of preservatives and artificial flavorings.  Instead I used l.o. chicken gravy and sherry.  Then I added chives, garlic , nutmeg, and extra salt and pepper.  Given those adjustments this is very fine.

Perfect comfort food!  Mmmm!  I did add a little cheese, substituted the water for chicken broth, and added cornstarch, like others did.  Hubby and kids liked it and they aren't fond of chowder.  We're a meat protein family, so we will add more meat protein (i.e. chicken) next time, but it's still delicious as is.

It was pretty good.  I like thicker soup so I had to drain some of the liquid at the end.  I think I would make it again with some tweaks.

LOVE this!  I made a few changes:  used chicken stock in place of water; upped stock to 2 cups instead of 1; used bacon pieces from the salad section (way faster); thickened it with some corn starch; and added a cup of shredded cheese right at the end.  Absolutely wonderful.  We ran out so quickly that I had to make more the next day to satisify a hungry husband.  :)

The easiest most delicious i have made in a long time. I did add ham cubes with the bacon when cooking them together and fresh corn off the cob to this receipe. Do not add salt at all to this when you add these other ingrediants. salt is not needed. I would recommend this receipe to anyone who enjoys a good chowder.

Very good recipe!  I did change it up a bit.  Instead of sour cream I added a heavy cream and cheddar cheese.  I cooked up some chopped carrots, onion, and celery.  It was fantastic!  Also, I would like to suggest an easy and great way to thicken soups, chowders, and stews, try using instant potatoes.

My teenage son has been dying for me to make a potato bacon chowder...he even went on online to find the recipe!  Have to say...when I made this chowder, everyone was so amazed with the flavor!  All my picky eaters were happy, and my hubby was shocked that I could make it!  First time I made it, double the batch...second time, tripled the batch to share with family and co-workers!  Try it, we are so happy...I love this recipe, now I "might" be a better cook! Lol

My daughter has been bugging me to make some potato soup.  I have never made it.  I chose this recipe and WOW.  My husband and I loved it.  My daughter enjoyed it so much, she took a huge bowl of it to work for them to all sample.  I had doubled the recipe.  It looks like I will have to triple it the next time I make it.  I followed the recipe to the T.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

VERY flavorful! I added half a block of colby cheese for the ten minutes it was all melting together. This soup is quick and easy to make and super tasty!!

This soup is better than the one my mom makes (finally I made something that turned out better than hers)! As recommended by other users, I used chicken broth instead of water. This soup was wonderful.

Wow....we loved this recipe.  I've searched for ages for a great potato soup that wasn't runny and had plenty of flavor.  I gave it five stars because as directed it was wonderful.  But later I remembered that someone told me that a lot of time in restaurants they add cream cheese.  Well,  the next time I made it  I left out the sour cream, and added an entire package of light cream cheese and let it melt down into the chowder and it was soooooo creamy and great!

I love this recipe. The only thing I did different is I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth and left out the sour cream.

Instead of water I used chicken broth. Chowder was very thick so I added the broth to the consistency that I liked.  I made 4x's the amount of the recipe and it all went!  Very very good and great for a cold day!

Great Soup.  I used chicken broth also and added corn and chopped carrots and increased the bacon. I added additional potatoes after the first batch was boiling for awhile and didnt mash them so my soup was thick with chunks, which is how we like it.  My soup came out very thick so I did not bother to add any milk.  Great recipe!!

Fantastic! I made only a few small changes: Just before the final 10-minute simmer, I added a cup of frozen corn, half a cup of shredded cheddar, and half a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken it a bit more. Perfect!

I also made a dairy-free version for my daughter by substituting unsweetened soy milk for the milk and sour cream, then adding a teaspoon of corn starch. Worked out perfectly.

Delicious!  I have made other chowders before and this is by far our favorite so far.  The only change I made was to boil the potatoes in chicken broth instead of water.  It turned out amazing.  Thanks Jacque for a great recipe.

This is SO good.  I had a huge bag of bacon bits so I used those instead of frying up bacon.  When I sauteed my celery & onion I used olive oil.  But, those are the only changes I made, it is so yummy!

The soup is awesome as is...when I am done boiling the potatoes I always add some of the potato water to the soup.  I find it makes it that much better.  My husband and I really enjoy this soup and have made it many times over the last year!

Just devoured this! Very good and super easy. I used vegetable broth instead of water to cook the potatoes. Also mashed the potatoes a bit once they were cooked. Next time I will add some garlic. Excellent recipe!!!

This recipe was great! I loved it and found it easy to make. the idea of cooking the veggies in the bacon grease was a lot of help. I cook for my boyfriend and his friends so bacon flavors are a must. they loved it. the only difference is that i added my own extra ingredients and made alot more than was suggested. still, i highly recommend it and am very satisfied with it.

The first time I made it was good. The next time I made it I doubled the amount of potatoes, made a whole package bacon, and added about 2 table spoons of bacon graese to the soup, then it was great.

Great soup for a cold night!  I used 1 cup chicken stock in place of the water and also I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup french onion dip. I didn't have bacon but i did have real bacon bits and i added about a TBS to the onion and sprinkled some more on each bowl.

To start, it was a good recipe, but it was kind of thin. It was also rather bland, until I added my own favorite concoction of herbs. I cut the potatoes small, so I suggest using more and cutting them larger. Also, blend some of it together to make it velvety. The next day, I added a can of cream style corn and mexicorn and it made it so much better! This really made the soup delicious and definitely a keeper.

WOW! I made this soup to the letter and it's amazing! The serving size seemed a bit off but I may have used smaller potatoes. I've never made soup but I will definitely be making this again. And let it simmer till it's nice and thick, sprinkle a little extra bacon and another dab of sour cream and you're in heaven. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!  P.S. I added chopped chives to it for a little extra zing.

This soup is really wonderful!  I did make a couple of adjustments.  I like to season everything so I added a little minced garlic to the vegetables as they were sautued, velveeta processed cheese, and 1T of cornstarch to the milk for a creamier soup.  It turned out FABULOUS!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great soup, and easy to make! Make it lower in fat by using skim milk, fat free sour cream, low fat soup, and turkey bacon. I also added a can of corn.

This recipe was delicious! It was super easy to make and was ready in no time. Because of the holiday we had a lot of left over ham, so instead of bacon we used that. I also added a little bit of corn starch to thicken it up. Definitely my new favorite potato soup recipe

This soup was amazing. Very tasty and rich. I made some minor changes. I added a can of corn instead of celery and instead of water I used chichen stock and added some fresh chives to garnish. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The bacon adds such a nice, smokey flavor. mmmmm!!!

This was the first soup I tried to make and it came out delicious! Everyone in our house loves it. I omitted celery cuz we don't like it but we added some garlic instead. I also cook the potatoes in broth instead of water as was suggested by some other members and it really makes a difference in my opinion. Very good!

This was pretty good.  I think it needed more potatoes, but the flavor was good.  I used fat-free milk and fat-free sour cream, so the soup wasn't as thick as I'd like.  (Just an FYI for those who want to use fat-free ingredients.)

This was GREAT! I didn't have potatoes on hand, so I made it with frozen diced potatoes/hashbrowns  and was surprised that it still turned out really good! I had to add some extra flour because the consistency was a little thin, but this might be due to the aforementioned change.   Although the diced potatoes were mostly thawed, I had to simmer it on the stove for about 45 minutes rather than 10 so the potatoes were thoroughly cooked & soft. I took others' advice and added cheddar cheese on top. Also used low-fat milk and low-fat sour cream. Yum yum yum!

So yummy, and so easy, just how I like it!  This receipe deserves 5 stars because one, it is great just the way it is written, but two, you can jazz it up however you want!  I added green peppers and corn to the onion/celery saute, then cheese at the very end to mix in. I forgot the salt and pepper, but it didn't even matter.  Everyone LOVED it!  This is a super-duper-keeper.

I made this, and with a few changes, it was a HUGE success. I tripled it, as others had said, glad I did. I used chicken broth instead of water, used 2 pounds cooked crumbled bacon, and added 1/2 tsp. chopped garlic in olive oil, and added 2 chicken bouillon cubes. It was a hit with some friends as well, and they gave some to their family, and they think it's to die for! Made the way I've stated, it is the best we've ever had.

Delicious comfort food! I cooked the potatoes (unpeeled) in 1 cup of chicken stock, used low-fat sour cream, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Thank you, this is a keeper.

I don't know what it is about this recipe but it makes me so happy!  (okay I admit it must be the sour cream) I love to make it and it is always delicious.  I have a problem making my soups too thick, and this one was perfect for me, probably a bit on the thin side, which is a great set up for adding bits of bacon, cheese or crackers as toppings.

I loved the soup. I did like one of the other people and I added things. The potatoes taste so much better cooked in chicken broth. Added some cheese while it was cooking. The soup was great.  Everyone liked it.

This recipe is great!  I made a few changes.  Instead of using all onions, I used some shallots also.  I also used a bit more bacon, but I think next time I will use more.  My only issue is that the celery wasn't quite tender enough.  I think next time I may use my mom's technique that she uses on the Thanksgiving stuffing, microwave the celery in water for like 8 minutes.  This makes is really tender.  Then I'll saute it.  Next time I will follow other reviewers suggestions of adding corn.  My boyfriend absolutely loves it so I'm sure I'll be making it plenty more times!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe as my base, but tweaked it a bit. I boiled potatoes, onion, and green peppers in chicken broth. Then added the milk, sour cream (but just about 4 ounces), bacon, cream of chicken soup, and a can of creamed corn, and let that simmer for about 5 minutes. Then I added some shredded cheddar, and some leftover mashed potatoes I had. The mashed potatoes thickened the soup really nicely, and added a great texture to the soup. I think I may do this from now on. It was great!

I just made this and OH MY GOSH is it good!!! I am in heaven. It is about -2 degrees outside right now and this really hits the spot. Thanks for a great recipe. Oh and I alos added a bag of the Steamfresh SOuthwestern Corn to the soup at the end of the cooking. I also let it simmer a while longer on really low heat. This was to make sure all the flavors had time to mix and to make sure the potatoes were nice and tender.

YUM!  A staple in my wintertime menu.  A couple things I do differently: I leave the skins on my potatoes.  So much more vitamins that way!  I also use a whole pack of bacon (12 slices) because the other 4 slices would just go to waste.  Everyone should try this recipe!

Thanks Jacque! I loved the fullness and body of this one. I needed a good 'starter' for other adventures in the culinary wilds. I have eaten this "as is" many times and never it fails to warm the cockles of my heart on these cold wintry nights..

Wow, was this ever good!  I have tried a few "baked potato soups" from this site and others, looking for OUR perfect idea of what it should be.  With a little tweaking, this was it!  For those who want to know, this is what I did differently...I used Yukon Gold potatoes and didn't peel them, used a whole pound of bacon for a double recipe, used half & half instead of milk (and used a whole quart for a double recipe...didn't measure), replaced the sour cream with 8 oz. of cream cheese (I didn't double it and the taste was perfect!), added 1 lb. SHARP cheddar cheese, and sprinkled chopped green onions over each portion.  The result was a thick, creamy, SILKY bowl of the most delicious potato soup I have ever eaten.  We have found our soup utopia!  Thanks for posting...and thanks to several of the reviewers who gave me the ideas for changes!!!

Yummy!!!!! This is a great recipe. The only thing I did was after I made the recipe exactly as called for I decided to add some more potatoes to it. So I cooked them in the microwave and added it to the chowder. I also added a little bit of water at the end because I like it soupy. Thanks for the recipe. I will definately make it again.

This recip was great.  My family isn't fans of veggies, so I subbed in onion & celery powder.  The flavor was great.

Instead of boiling my potatoes, I baked them in a 350 degree oven, then peeled them.

This recipe does not freeze well (like most potato soups) it comes out like mashed potatoes! :-/

This came out wonderfully and was enjoyed by all who tried it. I did substitute an instant mushroom soup mix for the cream soup called for in the recipe (I'm studying in Germany and there are very few varieties of canned soup here). The soup was very filling and good for our cold winter evening.

The last time I tried making chowder, I ended up with a fat of soupy mashed potatoes...this time I ended up with ridiculously delicious chowder! This recipe is awesome, I used 16 strips of bacon because we're fat kids, and I added frozen corn at the end for a little more texture, but even alone this was great. I made the serving size instructed in the recipe, and the three of us demolished in one sitting. Thanks so much!

I also followed previous reviews and added additional ingredients.  I chopped 1 small carrot, and added it to the celery and onion.  I also added 1 cup of velveeta cheese which added a creamy texture.  I always sub plain salt and pepper for garlic s & p. For a spicey flavor a touch of cayenne can give it some additional warmth.

I doubled the recipe, as I could tell this one was going to be a crowd pleaser!  Sure enough...FAB-U-LOUS!!!

I only made a couple minor additions.  I put in 3C of frozen corn during the final 10 minute heat up, and, we like things "peppery" at our house, so I put in 1Tbsp of fresh cracked black pepper.  THANK YOU for the wonderful recipe!!!

Yum! I never take the time to rate recipes, but this one deserved it! I modified the recipe only slightly----used skim milk and added about 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese to it. I also boiled the potates in chicken broth and left out the salt. YUM!! Even my picky kids ate it up!

Very good.  I made a double batch, however, and I had to add in quite a bit of potato flakes to get the right consistency.

I increased the recipe to serve 24 for a camping trip in October.  The only change I made was to add 8 oz of plain feta cheese to the chowder.  The cheese melted and add creaminess and some more salt.  Otherwise the recipe was excellent and my family can wait to make it again

I followed the recipe exactly.  The reason that I'm giving it 3 stars is because it lacked flavor, it's not bad, it's just not exceptionally good either.  That being said, my boyfriend, thought it was good.  I won't make it again because I'm sure there are tastier recipes.

Really easy to do and very tasty.

I didnt have any celery or parsley but it still came out great!

My boyfriend asked if I could make it again the next night!

Thanks for the tip

Everyone that I have fixed this chowder for has really enjoyed it!  I made a couple changes to adapt it to my family's tastes.  My husband hates the texture of onions and celery, so I just put in some onion powder.  Also added some Velveeta. So good!
