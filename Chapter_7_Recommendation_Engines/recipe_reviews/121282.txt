I used only one egg and a mozza/cheddar combo.  I filled them into mini tart shells and they were great as an appy.

I have made this about 20 times since I discovered it 6 months ago. If I make this tart exactly as written, my picky-eater kids love it - the taste is creamy & cheesy. But you can also add caramelized onions, tomato slices, whatever. The base recipe is excellent. Thanks, Teri.

Even the bf, a self proclaimed ricotta hater, liked this one.  I was a little worried bc the filling spread past the crust in some areas, but it cooked up well enough anyway.  Still, a better way would probably be to put it in a pie pan and you could still fold over that way.  Would probably take a bit longer in the oven, though.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made a few changes: used mozzarella in place of the cheddar and used a sun-dried tomato spread in place of the salsa. It was pretty good, but a little more eggy than I would've liked. If I make it again, I'll use only one egg and maybe an extra half cup of ricotta.

Wasn't sure what to expect with this. It is kind of like a quiche or fritatta. I used extra sharp cheddar and I think it was too sharp. I used three egg whites, and threw in some cilantro.  I also did this without a crust and cut it into little squares.

I followed the recipe exactly but put it in a 9 inch pie pan as others suggested rolling over the crust after pouring in the egg and cheese mixture.  I baked it for about 45-50 minutes until it was golden brown and crispy on top. It was delicious!  Not runny at all. I added sliced tomatoes to the top of one and other sliced veggies to the top of another in pretty patterns.  I will definitely make this again and again for an appetizer, breakfast, or dinner.

mmmm...... i agree that it must be baked in a pie pan but then it will take 1 hour. i also think that that adding three egg whites to was a spectacular idea. chives added, voila! beautiful

We thought this was delicious, but it came out a little loose (even though I cooked it til it quit jiggling and was nearly burnt, which is how I like my crust anyway). I might have been inexact with my cheese (it was a partial brick I grated myself, so idk how much it really was) and I did use fat-free ricotta, which to me is more solid than regular but in baking might account for the loose end result. It was NOT runny; just really soft. It held together just fine for serving, even while still warm. I used pizza sauce & added turkey pepperoni on top, making an Italian variation on this theme. Thank you for sharing your recipe, it was super rich & super satisfying!

Very tasty but not visually appealing. Will try another method of presentation next time. Family raved about it.

This was an excellent recipe.  I had some leftover ham that I needed to use, which I spread approximately 1/2 C over the bottom of the pie crust.  I also added a few shakes of red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture and omitted the salsa.  I doubled the recipe which fit nicely into a 9 in pie plate.  I love quiche, but hubby hates swiss cheese.  This is a wonderful alternative.
