I thought this was very bland, and I didn't like the taste of the red wine vinegar at all. I won't be making this again.

Pretty bland.  Seems like too many noodles for the rest of the ingredients.  I will do some touching up when I make it again.  Mainly the addition of garlic.  You may want to add a little oil to the boiling water when cooking the noodles (I forgot this step!) or you'll end up w/a clump o'noodles!  Not a bad recipe, just could use some tweaking.
