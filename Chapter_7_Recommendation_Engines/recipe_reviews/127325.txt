This is my favorite method. I usually scoop a handful of chocolate wafers out of the bowl and set them aside and I warm the remaining chocolate. Once melted, I toss the handful of wafers back in to help temper the chocolate and then they usually dry within a couple of minutes. I made both dark chocolate and milk chocolate.
