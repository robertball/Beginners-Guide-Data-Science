I used 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips.   I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp coconut extract.  Turned out delicious!!

I made these as layer bars for Christmas. Bottom layer was 1 package unsweetened coconut flake, 2 t coconut extract, 3/4 can condensed milk. Top layer was 2 cups chips 3/4 can condensed milk, and 2 t almond extract. Delicious!
