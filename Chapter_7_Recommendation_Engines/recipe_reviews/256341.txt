This is  good recipe. I  have been canning  sweet  breads for about 20  years.  Apple,  banana, cherry and   orange cranberry to  name  few.  They've been mailed to Iraq, South America and a few other hot placed the hubby had been deployed. I store ours  in  a  cool  room with no exposure to light.  We find it is good for about 6   months.  Even then it is the oils becoming rancid that ruins the bread, not molds.
