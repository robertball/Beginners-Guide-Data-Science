Alright....after reading all the reviews I went ahead and made this...It's pretty good and tasty, but I decided to impart some helpful hints...1) DO NOT over-bake these.  They will become hard flying saucers or something out of a spy movie, 2) Wait 2 full minutes before you put the hugs in, otherwise they will get way too melty.  If you wait longer than 2 minutes, the cookies get too hard, 3) I personally used silpat silicon liners on my cookie sheets, worked FABULOUSLY 4) Here's the deal with the hugs being so melty...it must be that the white chocolate has a lower melting temp.  I had a few extra kisses and used them and they were not nearly as melty as the hugs  5) Keep the cookie HORIZONTAL when transferring it to the cooling rack.  If you put it on a slight angle, the hug will get runny!!!  6) I made the cookies for a party tonight and they won't set in time for transporting them, so I put them in the fridge after they'd cooled so they would firm up.  Seems not only does the hug melt quicker, takes longer to harden.  7) They will be flat.  No way around that.  Be sure to only make them 1 tsp though, helps keep the edges from spreading and getting too crisp

Over all, great cookies.  Hubby came home and I shoved one in his mouth and he grunted for a full 2 minutes before he told me that he thought it was incredible and then tried to attack the rest.  It's a keeper, but with the former ground rules in place.  ENJOY!!!

I don't understand how so many people could have had disasters with this recipe.  It was delish, and it was very appealing to the eye.  I brought them to a church dinner today and everyone raved.  Thanks.

Of all the cookies that I made during my Thanksgiving break, my Dad loved these the best. He kept digging through the cookie tin to find these.

I made these last year & I already have requests for the recipe for this holiday season.  

But be sure not to overcook these.  They are best when soft & chewy!

Thanks!

I made these cookies for my nieces wedding and they were a big hit. I don't know why some cooks had trouble with this recipe. I had no trouble and I let the hug set in the center of the cookie for 1 hour in the refrigerator. I would make these cookies again

This is a great idea.  However, I found that either my brownie/cookies spread too
much or I made them too large.  Either way, when the candy was placed on top,
it seemed larger then the photo.

This recipe did not turn out anything like the picture for me.  The brownie part was flat and it was hard to remove from the parchment paper.  I placed the hug on there at the right time, but it almost completely melted.  That never happened to me before when I made Peanut Blossoms.  It tasted okay but was not for giving away.

Nothing more than a round brownie with a chocolate kiss...I expected a little more "cookie" consistancy.  I wouldn't make these again.

Having baked cookies for 5 children and a very large extended family for 20 years, this has got to have been the most unappealing cookie to the eye I have yet to try.  And I love to try new recipies. The cookies came out flat and they just looked ugly..not very pretty at all. It was like looking at a black (small) coaster with a striped kiss stuck in the middle. I don't know how they make the cookie look so good in the ad.  It tasted ok. But I wouldn't ever bake it again!

I have never experienced such a cookie disaster! Makes me wonder if I used the wrong ingredients, because I followed the recipe exactly.  Yet, the cookies came out more like crepes and were impossible to remove from the sheet.  I wasted a lot of time and money on this recipe.  I'm an experienced cook and baker, but have never gotten such a poor result!

Quick and easy, but I'd use kisses next time instead of hugs ... but then I'm a chocoholic.  Also, I think I'd try cooking spray instead of greasing and flouring the pans.  The finished cookies were surrounded by a greasy paste that had to be wiped off the edges.  Also, they fell a little too flat to store nicely.  Overall a tasty cookie, but it didn't make the Christmas cookie cut.

this was so easy and quick to make.  no mixer and only one bowl.  I just made a batch in less than 1/2 hour.  And they are very attractive because of the white chocolate hug!

I made these yesterday for a cookie exchange.  I followed the directions exactly, except I used confectioners sugar instead of flour for the "grease and flour the cookie sheet."  The first pan, with 7 mins 30 seconds of cooking had spread out so much, I reduced baking time to 6 mins 30 seconds.  I liked the idea of the Hugs being flat, but even with additional oven time to melt, they still had a peak. Overall, they looked unappealing and didn't taste very sweet. also, the Hugs, after melting a bit, didn't harden back up, so one couldn't stack them for transportation - hard to travel with 60 cookies all laying flat.

Major crowd pleaser!  Have made these three years in a row.  Yes the hugs melt quickly, but I decided that I don't really care for having them retain their shape anyway.  I put the hug on and once it's melty-looking, tap the cookie sheet on the counter so they collapse and you are left with a flat, striped design.  I will submit of photo of this so hopefully people can see what I mean.  And yes you have to watch the baking time with these.

We have a Christmas Tea Party each year and I am always looking for a unique recipe and I found it this year on Hershey's Kitchens.  The Tuxedo Brownie Hug Cookies were the talk of the party.  They stand out from all the other cookies.  They were very simple and easy for all the wonderful comments that I received.  Thank you Hershey's Kitchens for a super recipe.
