This recipe was a disaster. The first time I tried it, I followed it exactly. I did everything exactly as instructed. I allowed the cake to cool completely. It fell apart and had no taste. Yes, it was moist, but it was so moist that it stuck to the top of my mouth and was incredibly difficult to eat. But I still was willing to give the recipe a chance. I thought with some changes I could make it have some flavor. No amount of changes will make this recipe good. I have made three cakes based on this recipe, all of which are inedible. 

I am very good at baking. Almost everything I make turns out well. This recipe seems like it should be good, but it is, in fact, the worst recipe I have tried on allrecipes.com.

This wasn't as moist as I expected, but it was a good cake.  I increased the german chocolate to 6 ounces.  I did not have round cake pans, so I baked in a 9 x 13 square pan and crossed my fingers.  The cake was done perfectly at the recommended time!

** I need to update this two days later - after the cake came out of the oven, I frosted it 24 hours later.  It was good then.  I had some the next day (48 hours on the clock) and it was FANTASTIC.  Do try to make this cake 2 days ahead if possible, it becomes more moist with time!

This cake was well received by my boyfriend's family (100% true blooded Germans)... In fact, everyone came back for seconds! The cake's flavor was wonderful and it was very moist. I used Dr. Pepper for the cola and added 1/2 t. baking powder and salt. This is a keeper!

The 8 of us who ate this cake found it to be moist and flavorful.  I increased the amount of chocolate to 7 oz and used semisweet chocolate since we can't get German chocolate here and it still tasted like a German chocolate cake.  I also added 1/2 tsp each of baking powder and of salt as others had suggested.

I can make this, but I can't keep it in the house!! Personally I find most cakes to dry for my taste, BUT this is perfectly moist and wonderful. I'm trying out different frostings with it, but this recipe is amazing!!

This cake was very moist and delicious.  I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers.  I added 1/2 teaspoon each of baking powder and salt.  I also used Dr. Pepper instead of cola.  I topped and filled it with Coconut Pecan Frosting I by Marsha.  I frosted the sides with a rich chocolate buttercream.  Yum Yum.

WOW this turned out amazing!! I'm just a 20 year old college student who has never baked a cake in her life, and we had a Sunday dinner with a group of friends and it was SUCH a hit! Everyone had like 3 pieces they liked it so much! However, I didn't use german chocolate, i used semi-sweet and used like 6 oz. And since I had no buttermilk I did half a portion    of sour cream and skim milk instead. Will def make again, and if I can do this pretty much anyone can! ;)

This cake was super-moist, but it had no taste.  All the taste came from the Coconut-Pecan frosting.  It still went like wild-fire at the party, but I wasn't happy with the result.

Not very impressed.  The cola flavor was too strong, and overall taste was pretty blah.  It was also moist to the point that it was soggy.

This recipe was terrible! I did everything that the recipe asked, and it turned out really bad. The cake was the same texture of a brownie, but almost thicker than that. The frosting that was paired with it was good, and that's why I gave it one star. I made this for my brothers b-day, and everyone hated it! How sad is that?

I made this cake for my husband's birthday.  He loved it!!!  It was very moist and rich tasting.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I like the idea of substituting the buttermilk for half sour cream/half skim milk - i hate buying a quart of buttermilk for only a half cup's worth.  I'm thinking I might substitute vanilla yogurt for the plain, simply because I can tolerate eating the leftover yogurt a little better.

I have made this cake 4 times in the last 2 years, twice for a dear friend's birthday (his favorite) and twice as the cake base in my Black Forest Trifle.  Everytime it has been a huge hit!  I spent over an hour last night looking for my printed version because I am making the Trifle for a company luncheon tomorrow.  I finally decided to look here even though I thought I might have to wade through a bunch of recipes to find it.  Halleluah!!!  It was the 3rd one in the search results!  No box mix for me when this super moist recipe is so easy.

Absolutely Wonderful!!! The only thing I did was add chocolate frosting to the sides of the cake, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I also used the German Chocolate Frosting I by Martha on this site. I was pretty proud of my creation, so I submitted the photo!! Oh yeah I used heart shaped pans since it was Valentines Day!!!

Love the Coconut Pecan Frosting...but for all the work involved in this cake, a box cake has just as much going for it. I also like to use Tracy Larsen's Creamy Chocolate Frosting to frost the sides.

I had to add 3 more ounces of chocolate to get any chocolate flavor out of this cake.  The only thing that helps the flavor of this cake over all is the frosting, which I think is wonderful.  I just was not pleased with the doughy bland taste of this cake.

Cake was good, but nothing special. It was difficult to cut pieces because it was too moist.  Last year I made a german chocolate cake from a box mix that I enjoyed more (and certainly cost much less to prepare).

Very good cake. Was moist. Was also a bit heavier than I expected. I will go the old method of separating the eggs and folding in eggs whites next time. Should make for a lighter texture.I also made  chocolate butter cream and spread around the sides. It was the fix cake they cut into and the first one gone for Thanksgiving.  I will surely try it again.

A very good cake, but my daughter didn't like it -- too moist for her.  I don't know if I'll make again since it wasn't a huge hit with the family.  I've been eating a piece each day though of the leftovers...

My husband requested a German Chocolate Cake for his birthday. To make it more special, I decided on a “from scratch” cake. The word “moist” in the title got my attention. I followed this recipe as is. Initially I was disappointed because it did not rise as much as I thought it should. The longer I looked at it, the more I convinced myself this was a mistake & started considering the box cake in the pantry. My husband would have none of it! So happy I listened to him. The two-tier cake with German Chocolate Frosting by Denise was amazing!!! I’ve never gotten so many compliments & requests for seconds.

Excellent cake!  I couldn't find german chocolate so I used semi-sweet and it came out very tasty.  My mother-in-law who doesn't like chocolate cake ate her whole piece.
