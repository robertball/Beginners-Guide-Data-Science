I put the coated tenderloin into a big ziploc bag and dumped the apple cider only into the bag until covered (then sucked out all the air so it was completely covered) I let it marinade for 8 hours, took it out for an hour to raise the temperature, then cooked as directed, and added 2 apples and 1 pear to the tenderloin and cider marinade as directed and completed cooking. Afterwards, in my super heavy duty roasting pan, I cooked the marinade over my gas stovetop and added more cider since I didn't add water at all. I have a photo! Husband LOVED this! My first tenderloin ever cooked and it was a great success! Served with roasted garlic rosemary baby red potatoes (Baked in some olive oil with the roast during the last hour of cooking time) and steamed green beans.

This is a mouth watering recipe. The flavor from the apples is wonderful. I did not have apple cider so I improvised with apple sauce and the result was superb. I also used different herbs because I did not have these handy. Bottom line..I don't think you could mess this recipe up..it is a definite keeper!

A perfect meal for the Fall.  I used my crockpot and cooked the pork with just the Granny Smith apples and appled cider.  After 8 hours on low, the apples were reduced to applesauce and the pork was so tender.  I removed the pork from the sauce and added a splash of heavy cream and maple syrup to sweeten.  I cannot tell you how delicious this recipe was - - and how wonderful the house smelled while it was cooking!

This is the best pork roast I have ever made. Of course like most of us I made some changes. I have fresh rosemary in the garden so I used that plus some fresh Oregno and dried majoram. I ran 2 long sprigs of rosemary longitudinally thru the roast and then mixed chopped fresh rosemary and oregano plus 1.5 tsp of dried majorum, 2 tsp of minced garlic, kosher salt, pepper and some olive oil. I rubbed this all over the roast and popped it in the roaster and cover the top of the roast lightly with some italian bread crumbs and added regular cider. Baked covered for an hour and then uncovered for an hour with the apples and onions and a few carrots thrown in for color. Spooned the brown sugar over the top as directed.  For the gravy, I skipped the maple syrup as the non-alcoholic cider had made the drippings sweet enough. Made the gravy with cornstarch (personal preference).  The roast was delicious and incredibly tender. I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and homemade French Baguette garlic bread.  My wife loved it

This was very yummy. The only changes I made was to use half the amount of maple syrup called for, ( and that made the gravy plenty sweet enough for this sweet tooth) and I marinaded the roast in a bag (with all the air squeezed out) with apple cider (no water) and added chicken broth to the roasting pan halfway through the cooking time to make sure there was enough juice for the gravy. Also, being a garlic lover, I added two cloves of garlic with the apples and onions. Make sure you used a meat thermometer, as I find the cooking time a bit too long. Very flavourful, juicy and a definate do-again recipe!!!

This recipe is delicious and a nice change to the usual pork tenderloin marinated in soy sauce mixtures.  I did cut the cooking time to 45 minutes each part instead of and hour each. My mother did it for an hour each part, and hers came out dry and tough.  Wonderful flavors!

My family really enjoyed this meal.  I used apple juice instead of the cider, and cut the cooking time in half (just use a meat thermometer to determine when it's done so you don't "kill" it).  The rub was a bit too much in the end; I may just add the herbs/spices to the marinade next time instead.  I really loved the "gravy," although the pork is so flavorful, you don't even need it.  I used red delicious apples, and they were the best part!!  Overall, this was very good, and I will definitely make it again!  Thanks Bob!

We enjoyed this recipe however I would make a few suggestions.  First, my cooking time was about 1.5 hours (instead of 2) and my apples & onions didn't cook all the way so I would suggest adding the apples after 30 minutes and let them cook until the tenderloin reaches 160 degrees.  Also, definitely use a meat thermometer if you have one.  After I completed the gravy, I added the apples and onions to it and let them cook a bit together then I served them together in a bowl with the sliced tenderloin on the side.  One last tip, I tied 2 tenderloins together and cooked them as one.  It's the first time I've done this and it worked well.

This was an excellent recipe, but I must admit that I changed a few things. I used a 1 1/2 pound tenderloin, and then combined 1/4 cup scotch and 3/4 cup cider for the marinade and added 2tsp of garlic as well. I then seared the porl in an oiled roasting pan for 5 minutes before adding the marinade, and I reduced the cooking time to 1 hour at 375F and the pork came out juicy and tender. The sauce did not have a strong scotch taste at all, but melded well with the maple syrup and brown sugar. My husband ate 3/4ths of the 1 1/2 pound tenderloin that I made. He says that it is the only way he'll eat his pork from now on.

The five stars is for the wonderful herb rub and cider marinade.  The "gravy" turned into a big mush mess for me :(  (Be careful, syrup burns easily, hehe)  Also, be careful not to overcook the meat. Although I was very careful not to cook it beyond 160 deg, it was somewhat dry.  Overall, the meat alone with herbs was perfection and well worth the marinading time!  This is my favorite cut of meat and, like a previous reviewer said, it is a great change from the traditional soy marinades.  I'll definitely be cooking this again!

This was a great recipe.  My pork tenderloins were the 2 pieces you get at the grocery in a package so I knew they would not take 2 hours to cook. It only took about an hour and had added the apples and onions and marinade all at the beginning. I used a meat thermometer and took the meat out to rest for 10 minutes when it was done while I let the apples and onions go on and cook.  Then I pulled the apples and onions out and took out 1 cup of the broth and put it in a saucepan and added one envelope of pork gravy mix.  I sliced the meat and put it on a plate with the apples and onions and added the gravy to the meat.  WOW.  Since there are only two of us I sliced the second pork loin very thin, made a sauce with barbeque sauce, the leftover onions and some of the broth and poured it over the meat.  In two nights my second dinner is already made.  One other tip, when I do this dish again, I will dice up a sweet potato and add it to the apples and onions.  I also used regular apple cider but did everything else in the quantities given.

This was pretty good, but i like a few of my other tenderloin recipes better. Our family loved pork chops/roasts with chunky homemade apple sauce, and this definately did not compare.  It was still moist though and quite flavourful. Maybe if i had better flavoured apples. I will try this again during apple season when i can get them straight from the orchard.

This is a fabulous recipe which has become our Christmas day tradition. Everyone looks forward to it. I usually cook two big pork loins in my large roaster and increase the apples and onion accordingly. I do not typically use as much maple syrup which reduces the cost alittle (we only use real maple syrup) but doesn't change the flavor much. I also don't put the brown sugar on or do just a little as we like a lighter sweetness.

Hubby and I both loved this, kids didn't like the rosemary, but enjoyed the middle pieces of pork.  I marinated the pork overnight w/seasonings and regular apple cider.  Put it in the crock pot w/apples and onions on low until it reached 160.  Made the gravy with 2 tbsp brown sugar and about 1/4 cup of maple syrup and it was sweet enough for us. Thanks for sharing!

Hmmmm. This was "OK." I purchased a pkg. of 2 (1 lb.) pork tenderloins a few wk. ago. I used one then, but froze the other for a future meal. This past wk., I thawed the unused tenderloin b/c I wanted to try this recipe. To take the guesswork out of how long to cook my tenderloin, I used my Williams-Sonoma digital thermometer set to register 160 deg. (i.e. med.). I should have cooked to 170 deg. as I like my pork well done (but my fiance likes his med., so he wins tonight!). I pretty much followed Bob's directions to the letter except for halving everything (remember, I only had a 1 lb. tenderloin available), adding 2 sm. cubed sweet potatoes/3 garlic cloves & using a combo of GrannySmith/Jonagold apples & a little less maple syrup than called for (I used 1/4 c. b/c I was afraid that my gravy would be too sweet otherwise). I added my potatoes/onions/apples with the uncooked tenderloin rather than waiting until the second hr. It didn't even take an hr. for everything to cook thoroughly, so I am glad I did (2 hours, even for 3 lb. meat - my gosh!!!). My only regret was adding the potatoes (they didn't cook thru in the allotted time... my bad!). Note: Although I used hard cider (Woodchuck) as a marinade, I'm sure regular cider or juice, for that matter, would work just as well. Served w/ pork stuffing, garlicky green beans & dinner rolls, this was a filling meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Mr. Meyers :) This is a perfect fall dish!

This was fantastic! I actually cooked the tenderloin in a slow cooker for 8 hours with the chopped apples and apple cider. It was incredibly tender and juicy...and so easy to make!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. This was sooo delicious! The only modification I made was to use regular apple cider instead of hard cider, but I doubt that made much of a difference. We had leftovers and ate it for a few meals throughout the week and our mouths still watered every time we reheated it. By far one of the tastiest meals I've made. Excellent recipe! Thanks!

I would go as far as saying this is some of the best meat I have ever eaten.

I didn't want to go to the trouble of looking for hard cider, so I just juiced some apples and used that for the marinade.
The only other thing I changed was I used a lot less maple syrup for the gravy.

This was delicious.  I threw it in the crockpot for 6 hours and added all the ingredients at once (minus the flour).  I didn't have the vinegar so I used left over sparkling apple cider from the holidays.  Balance it out with some salty sides like potatos and stuffing.

It unfortunately didn't turn out so well for me. It was just ok. However, it might be user error on my part. I might need to try again.

This was a really great recipe that all six people at the dinner party enjoyed.  I followed the recipe to a T, but found that it cooked more quickly than it said.  Next time, I think I would add a bit more salt and perhaps pour off some of the drippings after the first hour to make the gravy and leave some to cook the apples and onions in the second hour.  At the end of the second hour - I'll just put the rest of the drippings in the already started gravy.  Overall - I'll definitely make again.  (I served this with Ibby's Pumpkin Bread Mushroom Stuffing - and they were a great pair!)

This made the pork tender. Of course the cut I had is usually that way anyhow. This was an okay recipe. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The only things I did different was I used Fuji apples and regular syrup. I also used just plain apple cider, not hard.

This sounded yummy but the gravy was too sweet, even with cutting back on the maple syrup - found myself wishing I had a more traditional gravy with the pork.  I only cooked it for about 45 minutes rather than than the 2 hrs and the pork was very tender and good but the sauce was a bit much - would not make it again - oh well!

I found this recipe far to sweet for my tastes. I may have got the recipe wrong as being British, I had no idea what 'hard cider water' was I assumed you meant dry cider so this was what I added.

Smelled lovely while it was cooking though

I tried this recipe on a pork tenderloin that was already stuffed with apple/cinnamon, therefore, I didn't add any more apples to it.  Did everything else the same except the gravy.  I made a quick, store-bought.  I kept the pork in the fridge overnight in the marinade.  I used my slow cooker and put onions in the bottom as a base.  I let it cook on low for 6 hours.  It was delicious.  So tender, you didn't even need a knife to eat it.  I will be using this recipe again!

Liked this a lot, and have very fussy kids (about meat). A kid friend ate over and asked me to make this again for her birthday. Used regular cider instead of hard because I drank the hard. :) Turned out great.

Served this at a dinner party.  Delicious and pretty easy. I did not marinade and it was still mouthwatering and tender. No leftovers and everyone begged for the recipe!  This was a big hit!

I've made this numerous times to rave reviews. I like to use fresh herbs, though, and serve it accompanied by homemade, herbed spaetzle. I don't even bother with making the gravy -- the pan juices themselves are delicious!

Fantastic.  Of course I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used alcohol free cider and a white onion.  I also had some pears that I diced up and threw in there along with a few splashes of apple cider vinegar.  Plus I agree on most reviews that this recipe cooks faster then two hours.  Thank goodness for meat thermometers.

Made this last night to RAVE reviews! I used fresh herbs (so I used more than called for the dried), but otherwise followed the directions to a "T". I didn't have as long to marinate but let mine "soak" for 6-7 hours. The results were AMAZING! Even better than I thought they'd be. Alongside it for the second hour (45 min.) I roasted some Yukon gold potatoes with EVOO and some of the fresh herbs I saved from the pork. I also steamed some green beans with garlic on the stovetop. One of the best dinner's I've had in a long time, boyfriend LOVED it too, better than most meals we've had at restaurants! Will definitely make this again & again! YUM!

This is one of the best pork recipes I've ever made!  I will definitely make it again.  My only suggestion would be to cook it a bit less...perhaps to 150 degrees instead of 160.  It was slightly over done at 160.  The gravy, by the way, was also fabulous!

I was expecting not to like this but actually did. The kids ate this like crazy. Didn't have hard apple cider so I used apple juice and Calvados (apple brandy) and let it marinate in a Ziploc bag overnight. The gravy was just plain weird and thought it took away from the flavor of the pork so I just dumped it out. If you decide to make the gravy, definately do not use all the maple syrup.

I didn't like the taste of sweet pork, and the seasoning kind of reminded me of dressing.

Delicious twist on the usual saltier taste of pork tenderloin - the sweetness of the apple goes perfectly with the pork.  Smells WONDERFUL while cooking!

Really enjoyed. Cooking time was perfect for me. Loved the seasoning rub. Used 2 apples and a pear.  Marinaded my pork in a ziplock bag like many other reviewers.

I made this but would change a few things. Did the marinade as instructed and baked at 325 for an hour but when I added my apples and onions for the last hour they didn’t get done. Had to take out pork and turn up oven and finally got tired of waiting. Next time slice apples and onions THINLY and put them in when I put pork in. Also would use cornstarch next time to thicken. I didn’t use the entire amount of maple syrup. Add about half and then taste. Pork very good!

I didn't have apples, cider or majoram, so I had to make changes - also because I bought a smaller (1.75 lb) tenderloin that came marinated in a garlic lemon sauce. I used about 1/4 c. cider vinegar mixed w/ about 4 tbsp ea. honey and pure maple syrup (topping off with  about 6 oz. water) to roast the meat in. I had tangerines, so I squeezed juice of 1/2 that on the top before sprinkling a bit of olive oil, thyme and rosemary on top. Quartered onions and potatoes, baking those separate to stay crispy, and sprinkled raw cane sugar on top of onions, rest of tangerine 1/4s and meat. Roasted for about 1hr15m. Tented roast for 5-10 minutes before carving (this step really does make a difference) and it turned out FABULOUS! Think the tart and sweet, plus juicy, tender meat, all came together in - like  they say - a "mouth watering" way! Can't wait to try w/ apples &/or carrots in the mix!  Also sliced leftover meat and left soaking in the juice - I'm betting it's going to be super yummmy after a few days in the fridge!

This was tender, but simply not as flavorful as I had imagined.
