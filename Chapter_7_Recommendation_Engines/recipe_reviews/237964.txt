I am the submitter of this recipe. I need to make clear that this is nothing like a pot pie. It is more like a pork "meat loaf" in a double crust. I also want to point out that the magazine published rendition of this recipe has been changed by the editors of Allrecipe magazine and you may notice that this online version (original recipe) ONLY calls for allspice as a seasoning spice.  Enjoy!

This was fantastic!!! I am French-Canadian and it is a tradition to serve this on New Year's Eve where I an from in way upstate NY. Wonderful recipe, I made my own crusts and it made the pie that much better. I didn't really change anything. It was great the way it was written. I have been chasing this recipe for years...and found it in the Dec/Jan 2014-15 issue.

We made the magazine version of this.  Other than it being to salty for my taste it was really good.  My husband said it reminded him of the ones his grandmother used to make.  We will try it again with out so much salt.

I used a lean pork roast and worstershire sauce and southern seasoning to spice. It was outstanding. After being married to a French Canadian for 36 years, this was my first time trying or making a tourtière.  Thank you soooo much for the encouragement. The whole family loved it!

This looks so  much like those that my Memmre used to  make us on cold Autumn nights. My mother's family is French Canadian and I've always enjoyed her recipes. This is one of my absolute favorites but now that she's reaching 70 and it's just my dad and her living by themselves she rarely makes this anymore. I think my children finally need to be introduced to these old world recipes. I'm going to be making this sometime this weekend.

My mother was not home for a bit and I couldn't get her to show me again how she makes hers.  This one was spot on. I ground my own meat from what we raised and also added a bit of wild game as is our tradition. I forgot the bread crumbs but it turned out just like my mother's.  I thank you for sharing this great recipe.

excellent brunch dish (with other items).  I didn't have cloves so doubled the allspice but otherwise followed it exactly.  I might have like it SLIGHTLY more moist.  It reminded me of the Scottish pies we got in NYC as kids which we served with A1 Steak sauce so I did the same with this.  People who'd never had anything like this thoroughly enjoyed it.
