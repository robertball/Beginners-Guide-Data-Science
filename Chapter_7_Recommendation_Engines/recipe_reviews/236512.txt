Very good! I don't think it needs two types of acid, tho. Next time, I would just add lemon juice.  Also, I added 1/2tsp. dry mustard. Also, you could replace the greek olives with green olives, in a pinch. I will also would bump up the curry spice to 1 tsp. , next time. Very tasty recipe, will make again.

Absolutely awesome! I omitted the red wine vinegar and it turned out perfect.  Will make again
