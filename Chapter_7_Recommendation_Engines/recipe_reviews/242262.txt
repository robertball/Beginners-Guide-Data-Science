Potatoes are great but the aioli was a huge Miss for me and I love avocado. :(

10.16.16  I liked everything about this recipe.  The potatoes roasted up beautifully, and the creamy avocado aioli was a  perfect partner.  I did end up adding more hot pepper flakes to the aioli and some additional lemon juice, as well.  Wouldn't hesitate to make this one again, it was delicious.  Thanks Potatoes USA for another easy and outstanding recipe!
