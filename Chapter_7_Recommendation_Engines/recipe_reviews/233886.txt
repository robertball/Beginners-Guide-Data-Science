Awesome! Added 1 clove shredded garlic sautéed. Blanched 3 asparagus spears cut on the bias and added to mixture. Finished the last 5 minutes with a small amount of shredded Parmigiano Reggiano.

Healthy, great flavor, good reheated, great consistency.  My big complaint is that they were very hard to get out of the muffin tins and then to clean the pan.  On my second attempt, I greased the cups very well and had the same problem.  Maybe muffin wrappers are necessary.

Great taste and easy to make. Subed coconut milk for half and half and used goat cheese. Turned out very nice. A great to go breakfast. Thank you for the recipe..

Awesome!  What a great way to use up the shredded zucchini in my freezer from the Summer's bounty!  My family are not huge zucchini lovers in general, but this is one of those recipes where you get the nutrients from the zucchini without really even noticing it's in the dish- which is great.  Flavorful and wonderful texture.  I served as a side dish for dinner, but I can definitely see how it would be easy to make these work for breakfast too by playing with the mix-ins a little!

Full disclosure: I don't like eggs, I tolerate them.  I made these because they're healthy and can be frozen. That said, I really like them as a base, but think more should be added. I did add corn, which really tastes good, and some salt and pepper. Next time I make them I'll add bacon, ham or sausage. I think they'd be good with spices as well. I didn't have any sticking problems, as one reviewer did.

Yummy but very hard to get out of the pan! Used a pastry brush and veggie oil to thoroughly grease the cups too. Convect baked at 350 for about 25 minutes. Would add salt next time too.

Great recipe. I have been looking for a way to use my frozen grated garden zucchini other than making zucchini bread. I tried this recipe and it turned out great. I froze my zucchini in two cup packages and I did have to use two packages and drain them before adding it to the recipe as frozen zucchini gets pretty watery. Otherwise I stayed with the recipe and they turned out great.

Great flavor with the scallions, but they need some bulking up. Mushrooms are a perfect addition! I also usually add more cheese and use milk in place of Half and Half.

I made these in a mini cupcake pan and they were a nice appetizer. Need a little bit more of some different cheese. Yummy and Healthy!

These definitely need seasoning- added salt, pepper, garlic powder, fresh chopped sage and a chopped up cayenne pepper.  Also, make sure to squeeze the majority of the water out of the zucchini, otherwise your frittatas will be too watery.  Otherwise they are a healthy breakfast- could always add a crust if you want the carbs.

Pretty good but needed more kick, probably some sauteed garlic and salt. Use foil muffin cups that are greased!

I love this  recipe.  It is healthy and delicious in the same time.   Besides,  it is easy to cook. I added a little bit  salt and pepper and used PAM baking cooking spray with flour to avoid sticking to baking cups.  It works perfectly.

I added 1/2 cup of red onion to 1/2 of scallions since I didn’t have enough and I used cashew milk instead of half & half. 

It is a great basic recipe you can build off of, next time I think I’ll add some peppers and bacon.

Wonderful!   These came out light and fluffy. No problem removing them from the muffin tins. Either use non-stick or non-stick and spray with some cooking spray and they pop out perfectly. A suggestion for removing them run a tiny rubber spatula around the outside and remove them they come out perfectly.  These came out light and fluffy. No problem removing them from the muffin tins.

They are a bit bland if you make the recipe exactly the way it states.  I added a small amount of smoked Gouda and also a few red pepper flakes.  SUPERB!!!

I'm not a big egg fan however this recipe looked worth trying.  The recipe has a lot of potential.  You could make it your own with different types of ingredients, e.i., mushrooms, onions.   I made a couple of changes.  I seasoned with a little salt and some pepper and also add 1/4 cup of diced (cooked) pork roll.  (to jazz up the flavor)  Remember to squeeze out as much moisture as you can from the zucchini or they will be a little soggy.  Also I  did have a problem with the muffins sticking to the pan even after it was sprayed with oil.  I'll use parchment paper on the bottoms the next time.   I will make this again.

I really liked these. I read the comments and made some small adjustments. I suggest squeezing the zucchini; I used paper towels. I hope I enjoy them as much when I reheat them in the morning.
