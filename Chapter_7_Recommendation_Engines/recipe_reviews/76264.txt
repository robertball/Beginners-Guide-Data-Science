I don't think I will try this one again.  It came out way too sweet and just did not have a very good "cheesecake" taste.  There was also a pool of butter under each cup when I picked them up.  I might try it again if I knew how to adjust it, but it's too much work to play with it.

This had entirely too much chocolate taste.  I would not make it again.

These are pretty good considering they are sugar free.  I will make again.
