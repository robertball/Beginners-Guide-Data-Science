Wow... I was looking for a recipe at least similar to the 1 my mother made like 40 yrs ago or so for all 8 of us kids and Dad. This is it. And ohhh so simple. I did add crushed red pepper flakes maybe 1/2 tsp. Not enough to make it hot but enough to give it flavor!

I used twice as much onion and still feel I could have used more although I did carmalize the onions first... MMM Good!

Also I put a lot more chicken chunks and chopped the mushrooms in small peices so my daughter didn't notice mushrooms in the sauce. 

I honestly do not think rice is what should be part of the sauce. I served it over some spaghetti that my son brought me from Italy. But the time I made this last time I used linguini. That was what this was made for. Linguini! Perfect!

I also used probably twice the chicken broth and simmered it a lot longer than the recipe called for. Of course I had to add some italian seasoning to make up for the bulk of the increases in sauce and broth. I also used about 3 cups of "traditional spaghetti sauce instead of 1 because I simmered it much longer than the recipe called for.

My changes really didn't change the recipe but the quantity. This is an outstanding recipe for  Chicken Cacciatore as I remember it from decades ago. A family favorite then.. and now!

Thanks Mom "Rest In Peace" 1933-1980

And of course thanks to the recipe contributor that made it all possible for me to taste a favorite food all 8 of us kids just loved!

I think others will find that the flavor

Not bad at all. We don't like mushrooms, so I left that out. Also, I cut the oregano amount in half. Overall, it was pretty good. I usually don't try new recipes out, but I had a good feeling about this one. Hubby liked it alot, so its a definate keeper. Thanks!

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT, I MADE IT FOR MY BOYFRIEND AND HIS BEST FRIEND AND THEY ATE TWO SERVINGS EACH.  I CHANGED A FEW THINGS, I USED VERY LITTLE CHICKEN BROTH AND SERVED IT OVER PASTA INSTEAD OF RICE.  IT WAS A BIG HIT AT MY HOUSE.  VERY EASY PREP AND NOT LONG TO COOK.  GOOD WEEKDAY MEAL IF YOU FEEL LIKE COOKING INSTEAD OF MICROWAVING DINNER! :)

This was delicious!! My daughter doesn't like green peppers or mushrooms, so I left them out. It was still wonderful. It was just spicy enough for us, also. What I really appreciate is that there is no fat used for the onions/garlic, etc. as I am a recovering heart patien. I would definitely serve this to company, too.

I made this when my garden was in its glory, so I used fresh herbs and tossed in a small zucchini, and instead of canned sauce I added a miscellaneous handful of fresh tomatoes towards the end. It turned out beautifully -- and so fast!

I was searching for something quick after a long day at work.  This was just right.  I left out the green pepper (didn't have one), and used spaghetti instead of rice.  This gets into the rotation.

250 calories!!  I like that!!! I even left out the spagetti sauce and added tomato sauce instead and it was still yummy.  Hate mushrooms so they had to go too.

I was looking for a recipe to use up a small amount of leftover cooked chicken (about 1 1/2 c.) and spaghetti sauce and found this.  I wasn't expecting much, but this was actually pretty good.  I thougt the rice might be weird, but it worked (though I could see making this again and serving over pasta).  This did take longer than the stated 35 minutes, however, and I was even starting with cooked chicken.  Still, I appreciated this easy, relatively quick meal that allowed me to use up random ingredients I had sitting in the fridge.

It seemed a little much with the rice in the cacciatore and being served on pasta.  I would use less chicken broth, would not saute the onions as the recipe states and wouldn't add the rice into the recipe to simmer.  Makes a thicker sauce.  I added more garlic, as my friends and I LOVE garlic in everything.  Overall, this recipe is very flavorful and I will be serving it again

Wounderful. I wanted something quick for myself while my husband and son were deer hunting. This was perfect, eating it all weekend. I didn't have spaghetti sauce so I used a can of 'fire roasted tomatoes' I had. Yum. Thanks for the recipe.

Everything tasted so great until I added the spaghetti sauce. After I did that it just tasted like normal spaghetti. Next time I make this I will omit the spaghetti sauce, it will be perfect then.

I used 1.69lbs of split breasts; but I skinned them and deboned them first. I then tripled the other ingredients, and used bouillon I mixed to make broth. AMAZING! Even the normally picky bf went for seconds, and complimented!

I just made this tonight and it was awesome! I added 1/4 tsp. Rosemary and used less chicken broth as I didn't put this over rice. In my opinion Cacciatore should be over spaghetti. I made it with wheat spaghetti and it was great! Next time I will try using Chicken Stock instead for a richer taste. Thanks for the recipe.

added some pieces of celery I had left over. Uses cut up whole mushrooms and brown rice. Wife & daughter loved it and suggested that I make it for my Columbian daughter-in-law and her mother.

Excellent recipe!  Husband and I really like flavorful food and we really enjoyed this dish.  Neither of us like mushrooms, so I kept those out.  The recipe was still great.  I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe was pretty good for a low fat/low sodium recipe.  To further reduce the sodium, I used Best Chicken Stock (no added salt) from this site and used a low sodium pasta sauce.  You could also switch to fresh tomatoes to further reduce the sodium.  I used pasta rather than rice since my daughter prefers it.   When on a restricted diet, you tend to have foods with a lot less flavor, however, this recipe had more depth than most.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I don't like mushrooms, so I left them out and I used brown rice because that's what I had on hand, otherwise I followed the recipe as written. It was quick and easy to prepare and quite tasty.

We loved this recipe! I made it almost exactly as written, I doubled the recipe but used 1 Cup of onion because we really like onion.  Everything else was as written.  My picky husband loved it and went back for seconds.  Will definitely add to the 'dinner rotation'.  Thank you for sharing!

This was not so great. I found it a little too sweet, despite adding red pepper flakes and a bit of hot sauce. I used red bell pepper instead of green, since I had it on hand, and perhaps that was the problem, although I usually find red an improvement over green. I was generous with the garlic and onion and I recommend that.

The taste of the sauce and chicken is phenomenal for such little work, but I really didn't like how the rice was part of the sauce.  Next time, I will leave the rice out and serve it on the side.  I didn't cube the chicken and I tripled all the spices and added some cayenne pepper as well.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a quick but delicious healthy dinner.

Excellent recipe! I added some zuchinni and used a bit less liquid as I served it over pasta instead of cooking rice right in with it (but plan to try it as written soon!).

Just made this - we loved it. I didn't have spaghetti sauce, so used bruchetta sauce and it was great, but I'd like to try it with reg sauce because the vinegary taste of the bruchetta was a tad strong.  I also only had white jasmine rice on hand.  Otherwise I followed the recipe, exactly.

Very quick and easy.  The flavor was also nice.  I wasn't expecting much from such an easy recipe but I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't use the mushrooms but definitely will next time.

This really lacked flavor for me, I added extra garlic, pepper, and even added a little salt.  I wish I had added more oregano and basil or just Italian Seasoning.   The dish did feel and taste like comfort food that would be good served to someone who likes things basic without too much pizazz.  Update: the fist time I made this I had quite bit left over from just feeding two, so I froze the cooked remainder, and defrosted it for lunch two weeks later.  It was pretty good.  The veggies and chicken held up well.

Added celery.  Simple, flavorful, fast.
