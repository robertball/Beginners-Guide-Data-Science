Delicious!  I made this for thanksgiving but instead of a medium pumpkin I used cute lil mini pumpkins for individual servings.  They were adorable and gobbled up as soon as they came out of the oven.

In order to use this as a side dish, I omitted the canned cranberry sauce, pineapple chunks and brown sugar, and instead used only 2 apples, added a chopped onion, craisins and 1/3 c. maple syrup. For additional spicing, I put in ground cloves. Yummy!

I served this with crackers and whipped cream cheese as an appetizer.  Everyone loved it!  The kids wouldn't eat it because it looked like too many things mixed together for them to trust it.

Beautiful presentation and delicious! I mixed the leftovers in oatmeal for breakfast the next day. It did take me longer than the recipe stated to get the pumpkin soft enough to mix in.

I experimented with this at our Halloween party, I served it with sliced pumpkin pound cake.  It was devoured.  I did have a little left that would not fit in the pumpkin, I warmed it up and served it over vanilla ice cream, yum-yum.  I can't wait to serve this for Thanksgiving.

This recipe was amazing!  I did try a few substitutions in the recipe for my personal tastes..and they worked out amazingly!  Here are the substitutions I made so others may try: - Fuji Apples instead of Granny Smiths.  (Fuji's are less acidic and sweeter) - Quartered Almonds instead of Walnuts. - Fresh Cherries (pitted myself!) instead of Raisins.  (I just never have liked raisins) - No Ginger Root at all.  I also used a "pie pumpkin" as that was all my grocery store had.  It was approximately the size of a Pumello fruit and there was enough to serve 8 people using the contents as a topping on Pound cake.  Absolutely fabulous!

FANTASTIC! I have made this several times and it always gets rave reviews. The pumpkin presentation is always a big hit. I enjoy making my own breads, so I use homemade raisin bread. I have also used homemade cranberry bread with equally tasty results. 5 stars!

I made 2 of these this weekend to take to 2 parties.  The amounts that this recipe calls for filled 2 medium sugar pumpkins, with about 1.5 cups left over.  I forgot to add the raisins, and purposely omitted the rum.  I also used crushed pineapple instead of chunks, and added about 1-2 Tbsp of tapioca to thicken it.  I had to bake mine for about 3 hours at 350 to thoroughly cook the pumpkin.  I served them as-is (not as a topping for anything).  Also, I used only about 1/4 c brown sugar.  I coated the inside of both pumpkins, then mixed the rest into the filling mixture.  I decreased the spices as well.  Everyone liked it.

I tried out this recipe a couple of years ago for the first time. It's been a request from the family every year since! It goes great when warm with a side of vanilla ice cream.

I thought this was good but everyone else liked it more than I did.  It was a little tangier than I like but then I'm not a fan of cranberries.  Maybe some of the tanginess came from my using the granny smith apples.  I might try it with a sweeter apple and see if that makes a difference.  I would imagine you could make this without the pumpkin because I didn't get a whole lot of scrapings from mine.  Maybe you could add some pumpkin pie spice?

I would not make this again as is.  My pumpkins never cooked even though I left them in for 2 hours.  (I used two medium pie pumpkins and there was fruit left over.)  The fruit "stuffing" was WONDERFUL though.  I will definitely make that again and use it somehow.  We did scoop it out and put it warm on vanilla ice cream.  Yum.

Some other alternatives are a pie, crisp or cobbler.  Maybe a topping over spice cake or carrot cake.  It would make a beautiful trifle dish recipe warm over ladyfingers, sponge cake or angel cake cubes.

The pumpkin certainly makes serving cute.

so, even scaling back a bit on the ingredients (5 apples, 14 oz. cranberry sauce, 16 oz pineapple--1/2 crushed, 1/2 chunks) it was still way way way too much to stuff in even a large pie pumpkin.  So I cheated...I microwaved my pumpin (a few knife slashes on top, 5 mins. per pound), scooped out the seeds and stringy stuff, then took out the soft cooked pumpkin and added it to a casserole with all the other ingredients.  Instead of adding raisins I sprinkled "craisins" on top.  I baked it at 350 for about 45 mins.  YUMMMMMMMM!  Ok, it would have looked cooler in a pumpkin, but this was  a practical soloution and it was a great sweet sice that went perfectly with a rich pumpkin, brie and bacon casserole.  This is a keeper!

I don't know how big your pumpkins are, but the amount of filling I made (exactly as the recipe says) made twice as much as would fit in the pumpkin. :)
I also found that 1 hour wasn't long enough for the pumpkin to be soft enough to mix through.
Saying that, I'll definitely be making this again (using the other unused half of the filling that I stuck in the freezer), but will try baking for 1.5 hours or longer.
Flavours are delicious!  It's definitely a keeper.  I served this with Turkey Loaf and some rice, and it was thoroughly enjoyed. :)

This was my first baked pumpkin and it turned out really well. I made a few changes: I: 1) skipped the brown sugar because I (correctly) thought the dried fruit would add enough sweetness, 2) used homemade cranberry sauce, which, again, is less sweet, 3) added some dried cranberries, 4) forgot to buy fresh ginger, so I added a few finely chopped pieces of crystallized ginger, instead. I had some extra mixture, so I added it to the "Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing" recipe.

There was tons of filling - I baked an additional dish after what fit in the pumpkin. I'm not sure that any of the pumpkin could actually be scraped off into the mix after baking. Family loved this the most on ice cream as a desert. I substituted regular raisins for the golden, and left out the walnuts.

This was the coolest thing.  It was a little sweet for me so I think next time I will cut out the sugar and add real cranberries to have their tang offset it.  I'm also an impatient baker and don't measure spices, but next time will make sure to! I over seasoned it a little and it was definitely over powering. All in all, this dish was awesome and I'm looking forward to Thanksgiving.

This was delicious!  I loved it.  The spices were great, and it was so fun and festive to serve it in a pumpkin.  People are impressed by the presentation, but the flavor was great also.  I left mine in the oven quite a bit longer than suggested, but I am sure it just depends on the pumpkin so you have to check it.  Seems like it would be hard to overdo it though.  The only problem I had was that when I was trying to scrape some of the pumkin into the mixture when it was finished I ended up with big pieces of pumpkin in there and it was hard to cut it up while mixing it.  Delicious and fun recipe though.

Will not make again. Pumpkins just arent that flavorful without right spices and this recipe does not bring out any flavor.  Looked interesting though.

Looks great but hard to serve, wastes a lot of pumpkin, ginger is too strong, pineapple chunks are too large to blend well, and makes too much to fit in the pumpkin. Won't make again.

It depends a lot on the group of people.  I made it one year for Thanksgiving and no one was quite sure what to do with it.  I made it another year for some friends doing a dinner earlier in the week and they loved it.  I actually no longer have a choice and have to bring it every year.  One comment is the recipe was very sweet.  I did actually forgot to add the brown sugar one year and it was great.  All the ingredients are pretty sweet as it is.  Also keep in mind it makes a ton even for the largest pie pumpkin you can find, but is hard to cut in half because of the full cans needed.

I made this last year for a Thanksgiving potluck, and as soon as this year's holiday season rolled around people started asking when I'd make it again! Huge success. I omitted the pineapple chunks and used dry ginger because I thought fresh was too strong.
