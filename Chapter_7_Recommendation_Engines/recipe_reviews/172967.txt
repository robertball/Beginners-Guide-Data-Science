Oh my, these are finger lickin' good!  I may be a Northern girl, but I do know a good rib when I taste one.  The key to a really good rib is in the rub and this rub is great! I actually made extra and put it in a small jar to have on hand. I did change one major thing though and that was the amount of salt - I cut way back on that; 1 & 1/2 tsp. for the full recipe.  The rest of the recipe is a matter of taste.  I used 1 Tbsp each of the black and white peppers, but really you could leave it alone.  We have a smoker, but if you don't use whatever you have - gas or charcoal grill with a lid.  If you do use a grill, wrap the ribs in foil and put a thin layer of BBQ sauce on the bottom of the foil before wrapping to prevent the ribs from sticking. Place them on the grill on low heat, cover, and let them cook for about two - three hours or until done. Unwrap them and finish directly on the grill basting the ribs in the remaining BBQ sauce. As far as the BBQ sauce is concerned again use what you have or like.  I didn't have apple juice so I added a splash of apple cider vinegar, a splash of liquid smoke along with the brown sugar to some Bull's Eye BBQ sauce I had (I doubled the amount the recipe called for). These were absolutely fabulous, fall off the bone good - perfect with coleslaw and cornbread.

It was good overall, it got alot of compliments.  But personally i felt like the cumin was to strong, especially since the smell stayed on my finigers so i would advise to use less or to not use it at all.  But overall it was really good!

It was good, and I did not stick to the recipe, because I could tell that it would of been too spicy for my family. Here is what I did: I used 1 tablespoon of the pepper and white pepper. I used slightly less than the 1/4 cup of salt...lets say 1/4 minus 1 tablespoon. I used 1/2 of the cumin because I agreed with another reviewer that the cumin would of been too strong otherwise. Next time when I try this recipe, I am going to buy the frozen 100% apple juice and use it undiluted, I believe it will bring out a sweeter intensity that I would prefer. I also used apple chips to smoke with and that was great. The meat was fall off the bone good, and it was plenty spicy, so I was glad I had cut those peppers in half.

The appearance of the finished product looked spectacular. My mouth watered as I split the ribs into two bone sections. My first bite of the bark shocked me! I'm a salt driven eater, but this was over the top salty. My next attempt, I'll reduce the salt by half or perhaps double the total weight of the pork ribs. The meat was fall off the bone, moist and the fat rendered out. If it weren't so salty I would have ranked it higher.

I have used this as a rub all summer and been asked many times for the recipe.  It is good on chicken, steak & fish as well as pork.

Great recipe!  I do not have a smoker so I added a small amount of liquid smoke to the dry rub.  I also added 1/4 cup of apple juice to the dry rub and let the ribs marinate for 6 hours.  I grilled the ribs on my gas grill and brush them with the BBQ/apple juice/brown sugar mixture frequently.  They came out so tender and the taste was perfect.  I served the ribs with a side of grilled zucchini/yellow squash and couscous.  Enjoy!!!  :-)

On Saturday my Masterbuilt 30" smoker arrived. After doing the preheating (cleaning the unit) on Sunday, I gave this recipe a try. Not knowing what to expect, I asked my wife & her family to have something else ready for dinner that night. 

This recipe made me look like a hero. The ribs came out perfectly....even though I did not follow the recipe exactly (I did not marinate the ribs in plastic in the refrigerator as listed). I added apple chips every time I was basting (soaked only for 20 minutes) & left the top vent open fully. 

I would suggest that you check the meat after 4 hours...my smoker cooked it faster than expected. Most importantly, cover the ribs in foil...this really adds to the flavor. The best part of the recipe is the aroma that your house receives when brining in the ribs...

Thanks again!

I let my family rate this. We are not BBQ kings by any means, nor am I a BBQ queen. I need it easy. This was. I found the blend of herbs beautiful, I say a less on the cumin, my husband said no. He thougt the cumin was dead on. After readiing others reviews, the cumin was the topic. I guess it depends on how much you love cumin. We are fans. I needed a fast recipe. I did not have time to marinate. I rubbed the ribs, did let them sit for 30 minutes, pacing, then roasted in the oven at 325 degrees for about 1 hour 15 minutes. This rub did not need sauce, the fat from the ribs allowed me to roll them for juiceness, though the boys wanted me to smear some BBQ sauce on them, so I did. Just added to the whole experience. They were very good and I will use it again when I don't have time to think ahead of time. Great blend of dried spices. Thumbs up!

The only trouble I had with these ribs was maintaining the smoker's temperature because it was cold and windy.  Other than that, the meat was very tender and sauce was lip-smacking!  I will definitely try these again on a warmer day.

Really good, I liked the Cumin flavour that this has. It gives it a bit of an Indian flare. I did make a few changes. Using 2 tbsps salt, and no white pepper (I didn't have any) If your not sure about the Cumin as it does have an over powering flavour cut it in half. Oh and if using fattier/tougher ribs highly recommend boiling them for 15 minutes then let them cool and then start the rub ect.  Also I should let you know that I BBQ these. Hope this helps. I will be making these again!! Yummm

This rub was divine! I used boneless country style ribs and because I don't have a grill, I covered them with foil and baked them for an hour at 325 degrees. I didn't even need the sauce.  I followed the recipe for the rub exactly and made a lot of it so I can use it on other things as well.

I loved it!  Even with the amount of cumin it says to add.  I read a lot of reviews about how it could do with less cumin, but the recipe is, in my opinion, just right.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up on this!

This was my first time at a true attempt to cook ribs in the oven -- I am not very good with the grill! I must say that the ribs were flavorful and tender. I was impressed, especially since I am not a big rib eater anyway. I will definitely keep this recipe on deck for any upcoming cookout!

Was awful! Waaaaaay too salty, not sure if recipe is written correctly. Will definitely not be using this recipe again. Shoulda read reviews first about the salt, was questioning it while adding it to the rub, but just followed the recipe.

I toned down the 1/4 cup salt back a measure, didn't have apple juice so I didn't add brown sugar to my Bull's Eye Texas style BBQ sauce; continued on with recipe per instructions. The dry rub on these ribs was nicely aromatic--hinting these BONELESS ribs were gonna be GOOD. Used hickory chips in smoker ( being sure to modify and closely watch my cooking time ) To make sure they were tender and perfectly cooked, I "steam broiled" them in 350 degree oven for 30 min. , using just over 1/4 water in closed roasting pan--and they gave that Southwest Texas flavor...with a kiss hint of hot spice!  It'd kill my picky eater wife and kids to COMPLIMENT me on a well done dinner job--but they didn't complain, so that's good enough for 4 stars! This recipe model is a KEEPER!!

Four stars for potential. 3 stars for flavor as is.  Found it intolerably spicy,  & I like spice.  Kids couldn't even eat one bite due to the heat!  Will nix the red pepper flakes completely next time & will cut cumin in half. (was a bit too strong even though it did add a unique dimension to the overall flavor).  Did make this as recipe states- used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ. Oh, think also will use the undiluted apple juice from concentrate too, it could have used a bit of sweetness... Unless I couldn't taste that due to the too powerful heat & cumin? Will update review after we try it again.

A good dry rub recipe but too much salt.  The recipe is about 20% salt, I will use maybe half that next time.  No complaints about the cumin other people seem to be mentioning, it didn't stand out, nice overall flavor.

The guys said- WOW - how did you make this!  This is a recipe I am writing on a card and putting in my personal recipe box.  This is very good!  I didn't have cumin so I was'nt able to add it.  I also only used 1 T of salt, and 1/2 T black pepper. That's the only things I altered.

Now this is what I'm talking about. Awesome job Dad! You have done a fantastic job.  Loved these ribs!  I tweeked it a bit with hungarian hot paprika, sprayed the apple juice during the first 3 hours, and let the rub stay overnight.

My husband made this recipe for our pork ribs for Easter dinner. We didn't want too spicy of rub since some of our guest aren't into spicy foods. This rub was just right, a little subtle kick to it. All our guest raved about how good the ribs were. Finger Lickin good!

Made these for my wife's birthday party this past weekend and everybody loved them. I added a 1/4 cup of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey Whiskey to the sauce and they were awesome!!

Great recipe. I skipped the cumin as I find this a little strong. I just bought a smoker and this was my first try at smoking and it was a success.

I made it and they were good but would cut back on the pepper. Maybe substitute black pepper with seasoned pepper.

Pretty perfect!  That's what my husband and daughter said after eating the spare ribs that I made using your rub.  I used all ingredients except the cumin and white pepper  because I don't have those and I used only 1 tbsp of salt.  I put the rub on and wrapped it in plastic wrap over night. I smoked the two racks for 3 hours on 225 in an electric smoker with hickory chips; then put apple juice on them with a basting brush; wrapped in aluminum foil and put back in the smoker for 2 hours; then put BBQ sauce thick on the racks and smoked for another 30 minutes.  Will definitely have this as my go-to rub for ribs!

I did these last night in my Masterbuild electric smoker. My wife said it was her favourite thing in the smoker so far. These were the best ribs I've ever eaten. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I turned the temperature down to 225 after the first hour. I'll be doing them again soon.

I forgot to add the cumin to the rub, but they still turned out great, spicy and sweet.  I didn't have applejuice for the bast, so I used applesauce instead...

I was looking for something with flavor but really didn't want to do a traditional barbeque recipe.  This was perfect.  I deleted the white pepper and cumin and it was perfect.

The recipe as it is is way too salty!
For your rub the salt should be cut in half, to 2 tablespoons of salt. The rest of the ingredients are spot on!
That would change my rating to a perfect 5 Star.
You can substitute hickory chips for the fruit tree woods for a more back woods flavor.

Recipe makes enough rub for 2 racks of ribs.  I cut the black and white pepper amounts in half to get a little less bite after finding the same amount in another recipe to be overpowering.  Also tried only doing the glaze on one of the racks of ribs and found the non-glazed ones were actually a little more moist and tender.  That said, they did both stay in a little longer than intended while prepping the other parts of the meal.  If I do them again, I'll probably wrap them in foil with some of the glaze in the foil, halfway through cooking, to see if they get a little more tender while retaining more juices.  They weren't overly dry or tough, but not quite what I was hoping for, on that front.  Very good flavor, though.  Will definitely experiment with it to see how I can get  them more tender and juicy.  As a side note, I didn't realize I ran out of cherry wood for the smoke, so I had to use hickory.  Turned out to be a decent alternative, though apple or cherry would likely be best.

Used less apple juice than the recipe called for  for basting.  Made these for New Years Eve party and was getting compliments from people I had not met before. I will be using this recipe again.

I followed this recipe for the first time last weekend to test out my new smoker and it turned out great. There was a nicely seasoned bark to the ribs and the meat was tender and juicy and come off the bone easily. I had already reduced the amount of salt used by about a tablespoon but I still found it a tad salty so I might just tweak that a little bit more. The other thing was that the sauce for basting the ribs was really runny so I would reduce the amount of apple juice or use apple juice concentrate to bring out a bit more sweetness and make the sauce a bit thicker so that it sticks to the ribs better.

My first attempt at smoked ribs!  Followed the recipe verbatim except I used half regular paprika and half smoked paprika.  I probably could have let the rub sit on the ribs for a bit longer but in the end the meat fell right off the bone!  I used a Memphis style BBQ sauce.  For me the only thing I’ll do different next time is use less salt.

My favorite ribs. Fantastic flavor. 
They are spicy, but I don't think they're overwhelming. If you have guests that don't like spicy you might cut down on the pepper.

I left out the dry mustard and forgot the salt but it was great anyway.  I also reduced the amount of ancho chili powder  and added liquid smoke.  Family loved it and I will be repeating this recipe often.

Probably the best dry rubbed ribs I have had. The only modification I made (after cutting the recipe in 1/4 for one rack of ribs) was sprinkle on chile powder (forgot to put it in the rub).   Tasty, tender, and delicious.  If you don't like a bit of a kick, cut back on the black and white pepper... I hate cumin in itself (when I was 4 I made myself cinnamon and sugar toast, but misread cumin for cinnamon and was forever traumatized), but did not find the amount called for overbearing. Will definitely use again! Thanks!

Cut the salt in as others recommended and that is it.  The ribs were delicious. Definitely will use this recipe again.

I followed the recipe exactly  but was disappointed in the results. I think it could be a good recipe but I will make modifications next time because cooking it like this made the ribs  far too dry. Next time I will smoke it at maybe 250 for 2 hours instead of 270 for 3 hours  and I think they will turn out better.

I am sorry to say the 4 tablespoons of pepper (I only used 3) and 1 tablespoon of garlic powder (Again, I used less) is so excessive in comparison to the quantities of the other spices my wife and I are trying to wash our mouths out right now. No way the other reviews are true or accurate. I'm looking at way to much money in spices I'm about to throw away just trying to fix this recipe at this point, I found this rub in no way sweet, only mouth burning. Extremely dissapointed.

I ended up making it with apple cider because I didn't have any apple juice.  Quite delicious, I made it with 2 tablespoons of salt and used about half the cumin.  I also didn't have any white pepper so maybe I use that next time.

This was a pretty good rub this is the first time I've went with another rub for my St. Louis Ribs I really like my recipe I came up with.  But this rub gave the ribs a little sweeter taste was great everyone enjoy it,  I cut back on the white pepper and only used 1 tablespoon

This is a really good rub, without being overly spicy. Per other reviewers' recommendations, I cut back on the amount of salt to about 1 1/2 tbs.  I smoked the ribs with apple wood chips and basted during the last couple of hours with a mixture of apple juice and bbq sauce. The family loved them!

This recipe was awesome and the only reason it didn't get five stars is because I had to use some of the suggested alterations in the comments to make it perfect.  The two biggest complaints I kept noticing were about salt content and the amount of cumin.  So I halved both amounts (I eyeballed half in the measuring cup) and I'm very glad I did because it in no way needed more salt.  Also next time I use this recipe I might be tempted to cut back even more on the cumin, the flavor is very delicious, but especially on the leftovers the cumin stands out as the most noticeable spice flavor.

As far as cooking time I went ahead and used the 2-2-1 method on my smoker (2 hours straight on the rack, 2 hours wrapped in foil, then one last hour out of the foil again).   Ribs were nice and tender and the rub made a good crust on the outside.  Would definitely use again in the future

these were excellent. I didn't have apple juice so I used pineapple juice instead. But I think any acidic fruit juice would do to tenderize the meat.

I made this and it was my mistake that I put too much rub as it was very salty. I didn't have quite 10 lbs of ribs. Next time I will use the rub according to how much meat I have. It was very good except salty. Will make it again

Thumbs up!  I've used this rub smoking shoulder too.  I've tried a few different tweaks like wrapping in foil after an hour or so and added a foil dish of apple juice and they all turn out great!

We made this and it was good and flavourful. I do think the seasonings are over powering to the smoke flavor. So when I make this again we will cut back on the seasoning

The flavors were very good, but wow....WAY too much salt! I cut down on the cumin (by about half) since many comments mentioned the cumin was overpowering, and half was perfect. The salt though....whoa.

I trimmed the membrane off the backside of the ribs so the smoke and flavor could really penetrate the meat. I like the smoke flavor so I used hickory chips soaked in Apple juice and beer. This one is a keeper!

Top notch! I placed a rack full of ribs on the top grate of the smoker. On the bottom grate I put a turkey breast. It caught all the sauce drippings. Also awesome!!

The rub recipe was way to salty for my taste.  The ribs themselves were kind of poor as well.  Next time i will be reducing the salt quantity significantly and adding bit more brown sugar.  I like my ribs sweet and spicy.  Ill also try to purchase a higher grade cut from the butcher in my area.  Walmart sucks.

Amazing rub and ribs came out falling of the bone. Ensure you get ribs with lot of meat to ensure they are moist.  Used Traeger grill.  Avoided white sugar and added some pepper flakes to give a kick. Used jack Daniels honey smokehouse and kc master piece with little A1 smoky mesquite sauce with some pineapple teriyaki sauce . To keep them moist used frozen apple juice and little apple cider vinegar with spoon of left over rub mix.

Wow! These were great! We smoked them in our wood burning pizza oven for about three hours. Easy to prepare and delicious. A little spicy for us, so we'll reduce the pepper next time. Great recipe.
