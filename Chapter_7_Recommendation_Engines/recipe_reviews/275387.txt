Super easy, used a pre-made pizza crust and it was a super tasty combination.  Will definitely make it again!

Very good. I made it as written, except for using green olives instead of black, because that's my preference. It was good, but for a little more zing, next time I plan to add some Italian-flavor chicken sausage. But this is a great, healthy option for pizza!
