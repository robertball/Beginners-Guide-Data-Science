This recipe works great with small pearl tapioca.  There is a difference in tapiocas that are in the store.  A minute tapioca has been ground to quickly absord liquid (looks like large  grits).  The pearl tapioca requires soaking usually overnight and looks just tiny pearls.  

This recipe is for tapioca that requires soaking and greatly speeds up the process of cooking this type of pudding.

I love Tapioca Pudding, but, I don't make it very often as it does take watching over. I am glad to say that is not the case anymore. I will make this pudding-doubled-alot from now on. 
Easy to do, just measure and put it in crockpot. I took some other reviewers advice and added some vanilla and salt, doubled the recipe and cooked it on high for 3 hrs. Came out perfecto.
My only advice would be to break up the eggs, prior to putting in crockpot, don't just drop them in there and then wonder why it doesn't come out right. You need to break them up. Also, be sure to stir during cooking, it helps to keep everything mixed up. So, that you don't end up with layers of eggs, tapioca, etc.
Otherwise--just enjoy eating this comfort food.

Made this many times Loved it every time.  I dislike having to soak the pearls.  If I want to make tapioca on a whim, soaking is out.  Eggs weren't necessary but did add texture.  Using any flavor extracts will greatly improve the taste and can be changed every time you make it (about 1tsp and up to 1T will work). I only have high and low temps on my crockpot so I used high and kept a close eye on it, stirring more often.

What an easy way to get fabulous pudding!  Don't be alarmed by the review that said this recipe doesn't turn out.  Just make sure that you have a fresh bag of tapioca pearls (old ones won't gel the pudding).  I got mine from an Indian store that seemed to have huge turnover of tapioca.  No problems!  We will be making this again.  Thanks!

I make a double-batch of this at least once every month, and everyone in my family (7 of us) loves it. My 92 yr old Grandma even complimented it while she was here. Unlike the other reviewers, I actually prefer the large pearl tapioca vs the smaller ones. I like mine to be rich and thick!

I looked this up because the country I'm in doesn't have minute tapioca in a box. This was perfect! No changes, except that I added a tsp. of vanilla. Just a few notes: a) You must use small pearl; b) if you want to cut cooking time, soak the pearls in 1 cup of the milk overnight; c) if you don't have a slow cooker, it's perfectly OK as it cooks in regular pot in 30 minutes over medium to med-high heat. Sets beautifully, tastes wonderful. Thanks for the great recipe.

Came out good, but I suggest making sure the eggs, milk, and sugar are well mixed before hand. I did have some parts of the pudding that were clearly just egg. I like the simplicity of this though because tapioca takes so long on the stove and is so easy to burn if you aren't patient!

Our family loves homemade tapioca pudding!  We don't make it often b/c it is so time consuming.  I made this recipe today, and I think it is great.  I doubled the recipe, added 1-2 tsp of pure vanilla, and cooked it on high for 3 hours.  Stir about every half an hour or so.  Pudding will thicken as it cools.  It has a delicious flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

Oh, this is good!  Thanks for the recipe.  I am not patient enough to make tapioca on the stove, so this is perfect for me.  I did add vanilla and salt, and this recipe does need stirring. Have to stir it before turning on the crock pot, then while its cooking. I put it on low and set the timer for every hour to stir.  Was done in about 3 hours, as I could only find quick tapioca.

I made this yesterday and it was awesome and extremely easy to make in the slow cooker. I doubled the recipe and used large pearl tapioca which I did not soak overnight.  Followed the directions to a tee.  We used 2% milk (we call it whitewash) and added 3 tsp. of vanilla extract (double batch).  I cooked it on low and it was finished in about 3 1/2 hours.  The one thing everyone should know is, it has to be stirred every half hour.  Make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the slow cooker otherwise it sticks.  We liked it a lot and will be making it again and again.  ADDENDUM: I made this again and used
1% milk.  Had to cook a little longer but was just as good.  Also, used the large pearl tapioca again.  Don't forget to scrape sides and bottom every half hour so it doesn't stick!

Incredible!  I'm not a tapioca expert; in fact I've made it only twice (once using the recipe on the back of the tapioca bag, and once using this one).  This is SO easy and SO delicious!  Much better than the first recipe I tried.  Since the recipe doesn't specify what kind of milk to use, I assumed whole (which I did not have on hand) so I substituted 3 cups skim and 1 cup 1/2 'n 1/2.  I put it into a small crock pot (which was filled to the top with this recipe) and cooked it on high for 2 hours and decided it was almost done.  I turned it off after 2 1/2 hours and tasted.  OMG!  I then added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I have to say both versions tasted amazing - with and without the vanilla.  I found that it needed to be stirred more often than every 30 minutes as the cooking time neared the end - more like every 10-15 minutes.  Also, I made sure the eggs were well beaten, added the sugar and mixed well, then added the milk and mixed well again before adding the tapioca.  Mixing with a whisk all the way thru the cooking seemed to be the best way (to me) to keep the tapioca pearls incorporated evenly.

Super easy! No need to "babysit" it, like the stove-top version. I did put milk, eggs, sugar and salt into the blender first, then added tapioca perls into the crock pot. It needs vanilla, as well as being stirred about every half an hour. Mine was done in exactly 3 hours on high, using regular pearls. My husband is a huge fan of tapioca, so this is a definite keeper. 
Update: made it again the same way, but cooked on low for 6 hours - got really mushy, lost all the texture. My husband likes it when you can feel each separate pearl, so I will be cooking it on high for 3 hours

listen to the reviews! don't make this if you aren't home for the day. Made in my crockpot on low because I know it runs really hot, had to be stirred at least once an hour, absolutely requires pearl tapioca not minute, used half and half instead of milk, added a tablespoon of vanilla and half teaspoon sea salt. Mixed eggs really well, then added other ingredients, then poured into sprayed crock. Nicely creamy and rich. Will switch to large pearl next time, the small pearl really seem to cook down too finely for my taste. If you have ever tried KozyShack tapioca pudding that is large pearl just for comparison. Delicious and by far the easiest foolproof way to make tapioca pudding I have tried in three decades.

Fabulous!!! I definitely recommend doubling it when you make it 'cause it will likely disappear quickly.  A few notes worth mentioning: It didn't take me nearly as long as the recipe says it will. (It only took an hour and a half on medium heat--which probably could be attributed to a difference in crock pots.) Also, I'd recommend stirring it at least once every 30 minutes and keep a close eye on it during the last half an hour as it thickens quickly. If you like to eat it cold, know that it will continue to thicken a bit as it cools.   Also, you can easily substitute sago for tapioca. Turns out the same!

I just made this and it turned out perfect!  Nice and creamy.  I whisked the eggs well right in the crock of my slow cooker first, then whisked in the rest of the ingredients.  Then I used the whisk to stir the pudding often during cooking.  I think this helped it cook up smooth -- no curdled or eggy parts.  If in doubt on temperature for your slow cooker, choose lower rather than higher.  I did add vanilla and about 1/2 tsp salt, and I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup, which is plenty sweet for my taste.  (Other tapioca pudding recipes I looked at called for the same or a little less sugar than the amount of tapioca.)  All considered this is a very easy recipe that gives great results!

This did not turn out at all.  It looks nothing like the picture, mine looks really gross like the eggs and milk didn't combine, the taste is okay but nobody will eat it.  vEry dissapointed to have wasted 4 c of milk on this!  I should have followed the slow cooker warning not to use dairy!

I followed the recipe as stated and I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla at the end.  Also if you use a Slow Cooker that has only 2 temperatures like mine which is a 1 1/2 quart Crockpot, if you cook it at a HIGH temperature it only takes 2 Hours.  You need to start stirring it more readily after the first hour so it doesn't stick. I started after the first 1/2 hr. and then after an hour it was starting to stick and I had even coated the crockpot with pan spray.  I loved the part that I didn't have to continously stir it though :-)

I love this recipe! I added in 3 green cardamom pods and half a cinnamon stick while cooking, remove before serving. Delicious! I found it necessary to stir every 10 minutes for the first hour, every so often after that. If you cook at higher temp, stir even more often. Otherwise, the egg separates out and you get cooked egg bits in your pudding. My kids still ate it...

I will give this 5 stars.I soaked the tapioca pearls over night in the milk. Next morning I added the sugar and eggs. Because I soaked the tapioca it did not need to cook as long. I cooked on high for 1 hour stirring every 20 to 30 minutes to make sure the egg was well blended. Then I turned it down to low and cooked the rest of the way until thick and creamy.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract at the end when the tapioca was done. Put it in serving bowls sprinkled a little nutmeg and we were ready to go. Super easy recipes. A keeper and will make again.

The best way to make the "custard" in this work is to temper the egg into the mix with about 1 hour remaining to cook.  Take your two eggs and beat them in a separate bowl - SLOWLY add some of the hot liquid from the crock pot while stirring.  When the egg has slowly been brought up to the temp of the crockpot, you can add the hot egg mix to the crock while stirring.  This will make the custard perfect!  I also added some vanilla to the mix.

We loved this recipe. What an easy way to make tapioca pudding! The only thing that I changed was to add some vanilla at the end. It didn't require a lot of stirring until the last hour when it began to thicken. Then I stirred it about every 15 - 20 minutes. My slow cooker doesn't have a medium speed so I cooked it on high for 3 hours. It was the perfect consistency and there was no sticking and no browning on the bottom of the pan. The only thing that I would do differently the next time is to use a little less sugar. It was just a tad bit too sweet for me.

If my hubby were going on a trip with no availability of food except for one thing he could choose and take with him, it would be tapioca pudding AND, it would be THIS recipe! I cut it down to 4 servings for the two of us and it seems the 3 servings were just right for the tapioca piglet!

I'm not a huge fan of tapioca, but my father-in-law is, and he's never happy with tapioca you can buy prepared.  I gave this recipe a shot, becasue it seemed so easy, and not only was it easy, but he loved it.  

For newbie tapioca makers, be careful to turn off the crockpot when you think the pudding is almost done - if you don't, it'll be overcooked just enough to bother you.

After reading ALL the reviews, I have successfully tried making this 2 times. Here is how I did it twice with great results BOTH times.

4C Milk(used 1%)  1/2 C Sugar  Put in blender for 4 sec. Added 2 eggs and Pinch of salt. Again blended 4 secs.  Pour into my Old Rival Crock pot. Stir in  1/2 C small pearl tapioca(bought at Amish store here).

Put on lid,turn on High. Every 15min, I gave it a quick wisk, hitting the sides and bottom. This was done in 2 hrs.  Add 1 tsp Vanilla pour in serving dishes, chill. 
Second time I got interrupted after an hour, put temp down to low the second hour, still made sure I gave it a quick wisk every 20 min.  It was still done in 2hrs!!. 
I feel you still have to stir this often to make it come out right. You are just not standing over it like when on the stove. Passing this along to several friends.

Tapioca can be a pain to make, but using the crock pot makes it easy. Just be sure to watch it the last hour as it can burn on the bottom without it being obvious from the top. Stir three or four times in that hour and you shouldn't have a problem. Placing a kitchen towel between the lid and the pot will keep the tapioca from being soggy.

I prepared a double batch of this pudding and it was pretty good. When it was warm, the texture was like scrambled eggs. I believe that adding the eggs later in the process and also tempering them will make it better next time. When it was cold, it hardened so that you could cut it with a knife and serve it by the slab. However, it no longer had a scrambled eggs texture. I added some vanilla at the end which was nice. The flavor is good overall, but I would also use less sugar next time. The tapioca pearls don't stand out from the pudding and the pudding isn't creamy in texture. These are the two main reasons I like tapioca pudding. Regardless, I would try it again with the suggestions mentioned above. Some reviewers indicated that they would rather just make it the old fashioned way standing over the stove for 30 minutes. If I want it to be perfect, I would also do this. However, I was cooking up a week's worth of meals this evening and the ease of simply checking on the pudding for a few seconds every half hour made it possible for me to make it in the first place. Although it requires this periodic babysitting, it's better than strictly spending 30 minutes on pudding alone. It's a pretty good recipe overall if you just want pudding and aren't terribly picky. I do believe that with the proper modifications it could be very good.

I made this twice.  I set a timer for 10 minutes and stirred the pudding, each time setting the timer for another 10 minutes.  As the pudding started to get thicker this became more important because the pudding would settle at the bottom.  The first time I didn't soak the tapioca and about 1/3 of the tapioca had gritty centers.  The second time I soaked the tapioca in milk for about an hour and the tapioca pearls were all cooked.  Both times the pudding was thick and had a delicious flavor.  Following the recommendation of other reviewers I added 1/2 cup sugar the second time and it was just as good as 2/3 cup sugar.  However, I won't be making this again because the texture of the pudding was mushy.  Whether I soaked the tapioca or not, both times the tapioca pearls were not firm balls like they are when I make this on the stove, instead they fell apart at the slightest touch.

Five stars, with the addition of some vanilla and salt at the end.  I also left the eggs out until about halfway through the cooking process, then tempered them before adding.  Frequent stirring is a must.  My husband requests this often, and we eat it right out of the crockpot.  Who can wait for it to cool?!

Just did this; it came out really nice!  I used vanilla-flavored almond milk in place of the milk in the recipe, as a member of my family is lactose intolerant, and it is absolutely delicious.

I added a pinch of salt and 1 tsp of vanilla.  This tasted great when it was hot, but once it cooled, my tapioca was too aggressive!  It really set up as one large mass.  Next time I'll add 4 1/2 or 5 cups of milk.  I guess my tapioca pearls were just really absorbant!  :)

I do not usually comment on recipes but I absolutely had to for this one. I have recently become obsessed with tapioca pudding and I have always been obsessed with my slow cooker. I tried both Minute Tapioca using the recipe on the box (came out watery) and then switched to trying Bob's Red Mill small pearl tapioca (recipe given on that bag was very laborious and not worth the effort - also came out watery). I was wondering how to get the thick, creamy tapioca pudding I saw everywhere! Finally I decided to see if I could make it in the slow cooker, which brings me to this recipe. It is PERFECT!!!!!!
Here is exactly how I did this recipe which resulted in perfection:
3.5 cups of almond milk, .5 cup of heavy cream,
.5 cup of sugar plus 2 packets of stevia,
1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill small pearl tapioca,
2 eggs,
1tsp vanilla.
I dumped the sugar/stevia and tapioca into the crock pot. In a bowl I beat the eggs for about a minute and then added the liquids in and whisked those together for 30 seconds. I then add the liquid mixture to the crock pot and whisked that all together for about a minute. I then put on high and gave it a stir, scraping down the sides every 30 minutes. 2 hours in it had thickened up substantially and before 2.5 hours had passed it was incredibly thick and creamy. I then added the vanilla, stirred, and put in the fridge to cool overnight. I am now eating it for breakfast and I can't imagine how it could be more perfect. I will never ever use another recipe again!

Best tapioca I have ever made!  I am so excited, it is smooth, creamy and delicious.  BUT you need to pay attention to your slow cooker since apparently they are all a little different.   On my first attempt I did 6 hours on low and it was overcooked, clumpy and tasted eggy (but still kind of good).  This time I stirred it every half hour and kept a close eye on it after 3 hours and mine was done in 4 1/2 hours- perfection!

I love this recipe. My husband loves tapioca pudding but I used to hate to make it. Today when I find this my husband said "That's not gonna work." but to his surprise and my delight it was the most painless and easiest tapioca I ever made. I used the Kraft Minute tapioca and add 1 1/2 of vanilla. I blended all the ingredients together before cooking. I only had to cook it for about an hour. We kept a close eye on it. We had in the refrigerator for another hour and sprinkle Cinnamon on it. Clean up was so much easier and no burn spots. Thanks for sharing this defiantly a keeper!! I would give it 10 stars if I could!!

Two words: curdled mess.  I followed all directions including stirring every 1/2 hour, and it is just lumpy and separated.  I give it 2 stars only because it's a reasonably tasty curdled mess.

Great and easy recipe.  Comes out just right.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla at end of cooking and topped with whipped cream and a dash of nutmeg.  Mine was done about 1 hr. early, so check it.  It is very important to stir often, especially at the last part of cooking time.  You will love this !!

Lightened it by using skim milk, Splenda, and Egg Beaters.  Turned out pretty well, although the texture was a bit different than I'm used to, but the flavor was right on.

This recipe was PHENOMENAL.  How hard is it to soak the tapioca, then stand at the stove stirring and stirring and stirring your brew til its thick, tempering in the eggs, and FINALLY finishing it with butter and vanilla!?  This crockpot recipe will FOREVER be in our family cookbooks with two minor additions:  1. Add vanilla  2. Add salt  and two changes according to my equipment:  1.I doubled the recipe in my Rival crockpot and   2.let it go on low for 8 hrs.  MWAH!

While this is an easy recipe, it can also be tricky. First, I think it is essential to add some flavoring to this dish. I add a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla extract during the last half hour of cooking. Also, for those having trouble with the egg part of this dish, tempering is the answer. One hour before your pudding is done, whisk your eggs in a medium bowl, then slowly add a bit of the hot tapioca mixture to the eggs, stirring constantly. Go SLOW. Keep stirring and adding more of the hot mixture to the eggs until they are quite warm, then add to the crock pot and stir thoroughly. Stir again 30 minutes later (and add the vanilla extract). Cook another 30 minutes or so, and voila - delicious tapioca pudding, perfectly cooked!

Allergen-free method.  OK - for those who love tapioca pudding, and have never tried to make it, this is a great recipe!  First off, let me just say that the review stating it was a "soupy mess" is correct when it is first done, let it sit for about 1/2 hour with the cover off after it's done, and voila - perfect tapioca pudding!  I am highly allergic to many ingredients, so I wanted to try making this with allergen-free ingredients.  Yum, Yum!  I substituted Vanilla Coconut milk for the milk, and egg substitute for the eggs.  No need to add any flavorings. This is going down as a win in my book!!

very easy... used minute tapioca as that is what I had on hand...at the higher temp. setting... it was done much sooner and although I did remember to stir periodically, it got ahead of me and started to set...I had to use whisk to smooth lumps out but it worked fine...will try larger tapioca next time... but if using minute just do on low heat as it will be done in a couple of hours without using the higher temp.

Good old fashioned comfort food. Make as written, but I found cooking on "low" for three hours works perfectly, stirring every 30 minutes (any longer, even on low, and it started to get brown and gluey around edges, maybe my slow cooker is too hot?). Small pearl tapioca is key (NOT the quick cook!), and it tastes best using whole or 2% milk. Add vanilla after finished cooking and mix. Yum. Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a tapioca recipe and came across this one. It's SUPER easy, absolutely delicious and definitely a keeper.  I add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract at the end.  I also use at least double the tapioca as I love   it.  This recipe works really well with the regular pearl tapioca.  When it cooks it appears as though the tapioca will remain hard, but it doesn't.  It softens up a lot in the last 1/2 hour or so.  Love this recipe, thanks for submitting it!

Excellent tapioca pudding. I doubled the recipe, sweetening the pudding with half splenda and half sugar, and stirred in a tablespoon of vanilla when it finished cooking. My slow cooker has only low and high settings and since I did not want to spend all day, I cooked it on high, stirring every 1/2 hour.  In 2 1/2 hours it was done.  In fact, I think I could have cooked for just 2 1/4  hours.  We finished it last night and my husband said it got even better after a couple of days in the fridge. (serve with whipped cream).

I was looking forward to this pudding and added some salt and cinnamon like others had suggested and the recipe is delightfully easy.  HOWEVER, this doesn't taste like tapioca pudding.  It taste just like RICE PUDDING.

HEALTHIER VERSION (I doubled the recipe):
5c Non-Fat Milk fresh 
3c Non-Fat evaporated canned milk [2 (12oz cans)]
2/3c white sugar
2/3c "Stevia in the Raw"
1c small pearl tapioca
2 large eggs
4 egg whites
1T vanilla extract

Start with only the milk, white sugar and tapioca, after 2 hours beat all the eggs well, and add a cup of the hot liquid to temper the liquid and then slowly pour into the crockpot stirring continuously.  When you turn it off (iI only cooked it for 3 hours on High and it worked just fine) add the Stevia in the Raw and the vanilla extract, as it cools it will thicken, this is the hardest part.. 

TIP:  Use a kitchen timer and set it for 30 min, every time it goes off giver the pudding a stir, and reset the timer for 30 min.  This worked really well.  I have made it the traditional way for years but given the change in cooking, I am able to make it more often and with the changes I made it is much healthier with no difference in taste or texture.

I'm giving this five stars (for the end result), even though I totally abandoned the crockpot method.  There's NO NEED!  It was done after less than a half hour (of, yes, constant stirring) on the stove top .  I used large-pearl tapioca, which I soaked overnight in half the milk.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added salt (one teaspoon in a doubled recipe) and vanilla (two teaspoons).  Good stuff ... and without the delay of slow-cooking (which requires some attention anyway, so can't be unattended...).

Perfect!  With the addition of vanilla at the end and with stirring many times, this is my new go to tapioca recipe.

Let me start by saying this recipe is as easy as it gets and I love that! I so wanted to love this recipe too with all the rave reviews it's gotten. However I just didn't.  Don't get me wrong it's not bad at all. For me the consistency was just off. I feel like it tasted and felt a bit eggy. I realize that probably sounds weird but that's the best way I can describe it. It just had a texture that didn't seem quite right to me.  However with the addition of some vanilla and salt like other reviewers suggested the pudding came pretty close to taking care of my craving for tapioca. I think maybe it's just been so long since I've had homemade that maybe I've just forgotten how the taste and texture really should be?  So all in all this is a keeper. I will try to make it again and see if I have the same issues with the texture the next time. Thanks for a great recipe idea!

I've been making tapioca pudding for years, and this is unbelievable!  Like other reviews, I made sure to beat my eggs well before adding.  It's too bland without salt, butter, and vanilla, which I add after it's done.   Thanks for an ingenious way to cook tapioca!

Very tasty and convenient to make in the slow cooker, but it developed a thick crust that my roommates hated (I liked it). I used large boba (pearl tapioca) from an Asian market.

This is the best tapioca ever!  I have tried numerous recipes that required whipping egg whites and other labor intensive work and none have turned out as great and delicious as this recipe.  I did add Vanilla like some other reviewers suggested.

Truly excellent (though you should add the vanilla as suggested by other reviewers). You can use the large pearl tapioca for this recipe just fine so long as you let it sit a bit first. If you allow the pearls to soak overnight, you only need to cook it for about two hours. I have made this several times in batches ranging from half size to a quadruple batch and never had a problem yet. If you have several people in your home, set a timer with a note requesting that the crockpot be stirred and timer reset for another 45 minutes, to simplify your job even more. This way whoever is in the room can take care of it and you don't have to linger.

Nice easy recipe but double the tapioca and add some flavoring like vanilla, coconut, or rum. I added  1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes. I reduced the sugar as well.

I love tapioca pudding, but this recipe does NOT work. The ratios are wrong- it needs more tapioca to cook up properly, and isn't sweet enough. Waste of ingredients! 

Best to just stick with time-honored recipes of letting the small pearl tapioca sit overnight- or using the Minute Tapioca. Don't change a good thing!

Mine turned out thicker than I like it. I ate it cooled. I might have preferred it warm. I would try this recipe again, but switch the heat from high to low sooner than I did (there was no medium setting on my cooker).

Awesome, awesome, awesome :) It was so super tasty, especially while still warm. I followed the recipe exact but also added one and a half teaspoons of real vanilla extract. I cooked on low for a total of about five hours, stirring about every 45 minutes so it wouldn't clump up. I'll definitely make this again!!

I had large pearl tapioca, but if worked perfectly with pre-soaking them in one of the cups of milk overnight. The flavour was a tad too eggy for my taste, and the pudding was a bit thicker than I like it, but those are things I can adjust in future. Other than that, thanks a bunch for the awesome idea, it works quite well in the slow cooker!

BEST TAPIOCA PUDDING so easy.... I used whole milk (I made a double batch) so I added 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. Cooked on high for 3 hours, stirring every half hour. Came out thick and creamy. Had to purchase tapioca on-line through amazon (no problem). Thanks for sharing, will definately make again!!!

I've had success with medium & large pearl tapioca as well- the long slow cooking seems to soften it all right up.  I've also used soy, rice, and almond milks. Thoroughly mixing the eggs with the tapioca & sugar has made the smoothest texture. This is so easy that I've actually goofed it by forgetting I had the slow cooker on. My son loves this pudding best and we make it a lot.

I have some good tips ! If you want to make chocolate tapioca pudding; add 1/4 cup cocoa powder to this recipe. I always mix the eggs first, add the milk & sugar ( add cocoa ) . Big tip, Cook on low, but stir every half hour. Set a timer if you need to. It may not take 3 hours either. Mine's usually done in a little over 2 hours. I don't let it get super thick because as it cools it will thicken further. I make this often and we love it !

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. It ended up with a grainy texture and tasted vaguely of scrambled eggs. Perhaps that is because my slow cooker only has high and low, and I used high.

E-Z and delicious!  I pulsed the egg in my Magic Bullet first to avoid any hard cooked egg whites (even though the recipe sez to beat lightly).  Toward the end of the cooking time there are some caramelized bits around the edge and I loved them.  My grandkids gobble this lovely pudding up!

The pudding tastes OK (I did add a little vanilla and salt), but the texture is just grainy. (I used whole milk and whole eggs, FWIW.) I'll eat it, but I won't make it again.

Too much liquid. I am going to try a little more tapioca (3/4 c) and sugar (1c) or less milk (3 1/2). It was done at 3hrs on low in my slow cooker. Over all I liked it I will use it again.

Made the recipe as written and it turned out great. Next time I'll add a little vanilla. My "slowcooker" must not be so slow! My pudding was done in under 2 hours on low. I have a warm setting and may try that next time. Especially if I start this before leaving the house.

I like to make it this way, with two warnings, ONE MAKE SURE YOU MIX THE INGREDIENTS VERY WELL first, TWO SPRAY THE CROCK POT WITH PAM OR OTHER NON STICK SPRAY, WATCH IT, MINE COOKS VERY MUCH FASTER ON LOW AND IT WILL OVER COOK AND RUIN IT.

This is awesome!  I was thrilled to find a low-hassle tapioca recipe.  Following the advice of other reviewers I mixed it well beforehand and gave it a stir occasionally and it was great.  Also, I added some vanilla and a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.  This has quickly become a family favorite.

Other reviews are saying not to use minute (quick cooking) tapioca.  I used it and it turned out great, cooked in about an hour and a half.  Also used soy milk, splenda for baking and a little vanilla.  I gave it a quick stir every 20 min or so.  Will definitely make it again.

I thought this was really good.  No need to soak, cooked on low 3 to 4 hrs. Stirring once every hour,put in 1tsp. vanilla at end.

AWESOME!!!  I can't get over this one!  I can't stand store bought tapioca so I thought that I would make it myself and try it.  What a difference, and with such an easy recipe I can't make a single excuse for not making it!  The only thing I did different was a little vanilla like others had suggested.  My husband loved it, my kids are not totally convinced yet, but I can tell they are starting to get a taste for it.  Last time I made it, I had a small package of blueberries that I added to it a few minutes before I served it (hot) with a nice little dash of cinnimon.  It was absolutely wonderful!  I am making it again tonight for breakfast in the morning, and I think I will try strawberries or peaches...haven't decided yet.  Thank You for such a wonderful recipe!  I hope others will be brave enough to try this one - its too easy not to try!

Dont forget to add some vanilla extract to really make this desert sing.  Served either hot or cold it is really yummy especially when you top with a little whipped cream and cinnimon sugar.

I haven't had homemade tapioca for a long time and was skeptical about making it in a crockpot.  I was very pleasantly surprised and the tapioca was excellent!  This will definitely be my "go to" tapioca cooking recipe.

Very good and easy to make.  I used large tapioca so the pudding came out thicker.  I also presoaked them for about ten minutes before I placed them in the slow cooker.  I cut down on the sugar and it was perfect especially after putting whip topping on it. YUM!

Like others, I found that the real key is in mixing the eggs with the milk before adding to the crockpot AND stirring several times throughout the cooking process. Vanilla definitely adds to the flavor too. Amazingly simple and amazingly good!

Wow, this recipe is brilliant.  I was amazed at how easy and delicious it is.  I will never make tapioca another way.  Why bother when this tastes as good (or better) than the stovetop version?

I was hesitant to make it thinking I would very likely be wasting eggs and milk (costly in this economic environment), but it turned out better than I imagined.

I added a pinch of salt and a dash of amaretto to replace the vanilla other reviewers said they added.

I love Tapioca Pudding!  I don't make it very often as it does take watching over. I am glad to say that is not the case anymore! Couldn’t be any easier to make - I will make this pudding-doubled more often from now on.   I took some other reviewers advice and added some vanilla and salt, doubled the recipe and cooked it on high for 3 hrs. Came out perfecto. My advice would be to combine the sugar, eggs and tapioca first, then stir in the milk.  I stirred the pudding about every 30 minutes, especially when it started to set, make sure to scrape the bottom to break up the clumps of tapioca.  Excellent comfort food!
Side Note:  Experimenting with other extracts is an awesome adventure that was successful every time (about 1 tsp. depending on how strong you want the flavor to stand out.)

Loved it -- after making some changes.

Have made it three times.  

All three times with large pearl tapioca, rather than small. Just soaked the large pearl tapioca in the milk overnight in the refrigerator.

First time, I followed the recipe, exactly.  It was not as rich or tasty as that which I grew up eating.  Good but not great.

Second time, I added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract and doubled the eggs to four.  Better.

This time  I used a mix of one half regular milk and one  half half & half .   I used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  And increased the eggs to six.

Love it. 

Also, love the relief  from constant stirring, freedom to go about other things, and the easy cleanup.

I doubled the recipe. I added about 1 tsp vanilla. I tempered (thank you for the advice!) the eggs about an hour before it should have been finished. It actually finished early! I think it is my slow cooker/rice cooker, it may run hot. Regardless, my kids loved it! I thought it was way too sweet. If I use this recipe again, I will definitely cut the sugar back a bit! Other than that, it was really easy and pretty good!

Easy Peasy.....and very comforting!  Mix very well @ start and don't forget to stir every hour or so. Stir in handful of chocolate chips for Chocolate tapioca.

Delish! For those having trouble with the eggs, just leave them out! My crock pot cooks very hot, so I have to leave them out or I get a very scrambled egg tasting pudding. I might try it again and add the eggs at the end with the crock pot on the "keep warm" setting and see if that is cool enough as opposed to low.  KEY: check every hour at first, then check every 30 minutes closer to the end.

I made this tonight, with a few tweaks, and it came out perfectly. I made a double batch. I added cinnamon (maybe 1 TBSP), and cooked it on low for the first hour, stirring at the 30 minute mark. After that, I put it on high for the next 2 hours, stirring every so often, and adding a couple TSP of vanilla when 1 hour remained. Did not overcook, and the tapioca is properly saturated and cooked :) Very pleased!

I have always liked Tapioca pudding but every time I tried to make it, it just wasn't right. Too runny most of the time. This came out perfect. I made sure I beat eggs first before and mixed it about every half hour. I used a wisk to mix it until it got too thick. And added vanilla.

I've tried this twice now. I used "instant" tapioca by mistake the first time which is my fault. I didn't know there was a difference. The second time, I used the small pearl tapioca and is was a disaster too. It was taste-less, looked burned, and was very lumpy. I measured the exact ingredients, and cooked it on low for 6 hours exactly. I'm taking the recipe back to the stove.

My family loves tapioca so I was excited to see a recipe that can be done in the slow cooker. I made it the other day and it was really nice. I did add a tsp. of pure vanilla essence. What I want to comment on is that the eggs did curdle a bit. So next time I make it I will add the eggs during the last hour of cooking. Otherwise, a very good recipe, Thanks!

This did not work for me AT ALL.   I doubled the recipe (because I love tapioca) and even soaked the pearls overnight.   It has taken forever to cook and is completely curdled.   I won't be making this one again!

Well it is grainy, not smooth like I like it, I added vanilla. tastes ok but is just not the same as homeade.  I would have rather spent the time to make some really good tapioca.  Back to the old way for me..

I wish I would have been around the house when this was cooking - you really do need to stir occasionally to prevent globs of egg from forming (especially in the first hour or so of cooking). However, I really enjoyed the taste of the pudding despite the eggy parts (which were my fault).

First time I made this and came out perfect.  Was dreading the package instructions so GLAD to find this slow cooker recipe here.  I used less milk 2cups milk (per package) and less sugar, too. BUT added a lavender (for cooking) in a bouquetgarnet (which I made using coffee filter and tying it w/string). You do need to stir (used wisk) several times.   Smelled good and tasted like confectionary.

The taste of this was outstanding. I added a touch of salt and some vanilla paste I had on hand too...    My only negative was that I did stir it every half hour, but the end result had a bit of a "curdled cream" look and texture. That didn't happen until the final 30-45 minutes of the 3 hour cook time. It wasn't terrible, but just felt odd and not smooth like I would have expected.   It certainly won't stop me from eating it though!

I made this in my slow cooker.  Adjusted the measurements up by half (6 C milk, 3/4 C tapioca, 3 eggs, etc). It turned out great and was done in about 3 hours...cooked on high.  Be sure to stir occasionally to keep it from lumping.  Sweet enough with half cup of sugar!

Perfect tapioca pudding. I ended up making this on the stove top after soaking the small tapioca pearls overnight. It turned out perfectly and is delicious. I will try this in the slow cooker next time but it turned out great without it. :)

I love how easy it was to make!  We really like Tapioca Pudding, but I hate how long it usually takes to make.  Next time I will add the vanilla as others suggested, but this was great as written.

This is a great way to make tapioca pudding. Just be sure to stir it once or twice during the cooking process or the tapioca pearls will stick to the bottom in a huge clump. I used no fat milk and no one could tell this was a low fat recipe. I might try some soy milk next time.

Not a fan.  Too many eggs or something.  I added some vanilla which slightly improved it.  I'll try it cold to see if it tastes better.

Very easy to make.  Used low heat for 6 hours and stirred about every 45 minutes.  Added about 2 tsps of pure vanilla extract after allowing to cool for 10 minutes.

This recipe is easy and great! my additions: I doubled it, then added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp coconut extract. I think next time i'll add some salt, maybe 1/2 tsp. then it should be perfect!

Wonderful!  Such a super simple recipe!  I can't stress enough how big of a difference it seemed to make to me to give it a quick stir every now and then, so the egg doesn't turn this dish into tapioca w scrambled eggs!  But the problem  was solved with a quick stir!  Most excellent recipe!!!!

This was good.  It seemed to be missing something.  Some people really liked it others really didn't.  typical of tapioca I suppose though.  I probably didn't stir enough...  It seemed to separate after refrigeration.  I would probably use this recipe again, making sure to follow directions.

I loved it.  Made it with large pearls without soaking.  Added 1 tsp vanilla at the end.  Cooked on low for about 4 hours.  Perfect. I will definitely make it again.  Followed people's suggestions to stir every half hour except for the hour I was at the grocery store.

This came out just perfect! All I had was the large size pearl tapioca. I soaked for 2 hours in warm water. I cooked the pudding until the pearl were clear and soft. I was nervous about putting the eggs in the beginning, so I added them after the tapioca was cooked, tempered them and then whisked in. Delicious!

WORKS BEAUTIFULLY EVERY TIME! I love this recipe! So much less intense on my shoulder than traditional double boiler method that requires constant stirring. 

If using large pearl tapioca  soaking overnight is a must for this to turn out right!

This is a super easy recipe, a few other reviewers mentioned adding in Vanilla extract I totally concur. I add about 2tsp-1Tbsp depending on size of batch (I usually make a double batch).  Prior to adding to heat: Also would like to recommend beating eggs well in a separate bowl first, then adding to the milk and beating again until well blended while all are cold help to reduce egg  separating later.  Then I like to add the sugar and beat a 3rd time to ensure sugar dissolves.  Then I just let it cook in crockpot and add the Vanilla extract just before placing in serving dish and cooling  in fridge.

I used large pearl tapioca and soaked it overnight.  Then, I used lactose free fat free milk and egg beaters "egg".  It stayed very soupy in the crock pot but after 6 hours I felt like if it wasn't done it never would be.  I folded in 2 t. of vanilla, poured it into a bowl, covered and put it in the refrigerator.  Low and behold, the next evening when I pulled it out to see if we were having tapioca for dessert, it was nice and firm (but not to much so) and quite tasty.  I'm sure it wasn't as decadent as it could have been with whole milk and actual eggs, but it was yummy nonetheless. When I make it again, I'll use slightly less sugar.

Easy, creamy and delicious! We prefer it less sweet and will stick with the traditional ratio of one part sugar, one part tapioca pearls and 4 parts milk. but this gets an A+ for cooking method. 3 hours on high, stirring well every half hour. Perfection and didn't break down the pearls too much like I was afraid of. We stir in a teaspoon of vanilla at the end. For a large, pudding loving crowd, you can quadruple this recipe with a full gallon of milk and it still fits in a big crockpot. Cooking times dont seem to change much. Will make again with large pearls next time!

I make this on a regular basis as you don't need to be with it constantly.  The only addition I made was to put in vanilla extract, to taste (1/2 - 1 tsp.).    A wonderful, homey recipe that is good either warmed or cool.

double the recipe, does cooks down to small serving. 
I whisked all the ingredients together first before adding to slow cooker. sprinkled in 1tsp vanilla and cinnamon each, and heaping 1/2 c sugar as we like it less sweet.  used large pearls and 1/2 cream (to milk) - as my fam likes more pudding consistency.

 close lid, stir occasionally to break clumps, and was done in about 3 hrs on high.  never buy at the grocery store again!

My crock pot doesn't have a "medium" setting.  I tried this once on high and it separated, watery and curdled.  Gross.  I tried again on low with the same result.  I did as others suggested, mixing all ingredients well in a bowl before putting in the crock pot, and stirring well every half hour.  I added a pinch of salt and 2 tsp of vanilla.  I have no idea why this didn't work.  Very disappointed.

I put in half the sugar in a double recipe, and it was still waaaaay too sweet. I also put in a teaspoon of vanilla. It was good in every other respect, though. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is a real keeper.  I buy the large pearl tapioca.  This is about as wholesome as a pudding can be.

Quick, easy, and a crowd pleaser!!!! I added 1 tsp of vanilla, and a pinch of salt. But great flavor, you MUST use small pearl tapioca tho, no substitutions there!!!!  :-)    ENJOY!!!

I tried this for my Sunday School Class of 4 and 5 year olds. My cooker may be a little different as it took almost an hour longer cook time on low. It was super easy and tasted wonderful! We served it warm with a chocolate drizzle and whip cream. The kids were happy, the other teachers were asking for the recipe. Highly recommended for lazy or time restrained cooks!

Good basic recipe. I used the large pearl tapioca, because that is what I prefer, and I chose to soak it first, thinking there was no way the large ones would be cooked if i did not.  However, next time I won't soak, or won't for very long. They lost some of that chewy consistency that I love, and the pudding was a little runnier than I like because i was afraid if I cooked it longer the tapioca would totally dissolve. 
Made a double batch, cut the sugar to a scant 1/2 cup per batch and stirred a handful of dark chocloate chips into half for my chocoholic family. Yum!

This was so EASY to make and tasted very good.   Thank you!   I did stir once every hour so it wouldn't stick, and I might add a little more sugar next time, but my husband loved it.   It was nice not to have to stand at the stove and stir, stir, stir....

I tried this recipe. I loved that it was easy. The texture of the pudding was not creamy. It was more like scrambled eggs. Maybe my crockpot was too hot. I also added vanilla and reduced the sugar by 1/3 cup in a double recipe.  It was still very sweet. Probably will not make it again as the kids were not thrilled.

This was pretty good, but I find it easier to make in a pot on the stove rather than the slow cooker. I found I had to stir it just as much, and it really stuck to the sides alot.     A few changes I made that worked great: I made it with Almond Milk and added 1tsp of vanilla. I mixed the eggs up really well before adding them. I would recommend trying the almond milk again, but I would add less sugar next time. It was quite sweet!

ease up on the sugar and increase the tapioca portion and it is the best thing you've ever tasted in your life.

I agree with the others who said it cooks faster than indicated in the directions - and yes, add vanilla at the end. Also, whisk often. I was so eager to make it the first time that I used instant tapioca. Not surprisingly, it turned out like sweetened sawdust. Could not find small pearl tapioca so today I used medium. It is wonderful!!!

Added some Almond essence, and it was good. I still prefer baked Sago.  But because it's so easy and no fuss, I'll definitely make it again.

I love this recipe.  We make it at least once a mo..  I also add vanilla and use splenda and fat free milk, worry about cholestrol thenuse egg beaters or any of those products.  This is so good.  Kept missing my mothers pudding and too lazy to make it. This will be your answer also.

The three things I liked about this recipe: *Use of a slow cooker so I don't have to constantly stir it or soak the pearl tapioca. *Not too sweet *Used pearl tapioca  I even forgot to stir it the last 2 hours and it came out fine. It looked as though it had too much liquid but it set up just fine by morning in the refrig

This is definitely the way to make tapioca pudding.  I added vanilla & a pinch of salt, set the timer & stirred every hour as recommended by another reviewer.  Much less hassle than stove top with a good flavor & texture.

I have to agree it's easy.  I prefer a bit more vanilla flavor so next time I'll add that.  Key to success is stirring.  I've tried other tapioca's that have worked with less attention.  As it is, it's easy and flavorful...but I would prefer more flavor.

It is a pretty yummy recipe but the 3 hours on medium were not quite sufficient to fully soften the tapioca and I would add less sugar as I found it too sweet. But I will make it again with those adjustments.

I just made this in my slow cooker and I'm very pleased :)  I followed the recomendations of the other reviewers and added a dash of salt and a little vanilla, stirring it every half hour or so. I also went 50/50 with sugar and sweetener (I'm diabetic). It turned out quite nice, even though right now it's a bit too hot to eat - oh well, hasn't stopped me yet :P

Great recipe!  I added vanilla to up the flavor a bit ... also I noticed when I cooked on high, then cooled this was very very thick.  Going to cook on low this time since I have no medium setting on my crock pot.  Thanks!

Flavour was good but mine curdled :o(  I really wanted this to work because I really like tapioca pudding.  It may not have worked because I used up some egg yolks instead of using whole eggs.  I will try it again sometime.

Not bad, but not great. I used Quick Cooking tapiocTra, and was able to cook the pudding on low for about 3 1/2 hours. I did add 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract & a pinch of salt, which worked out well...but it still had a little more of an 'eggy' taste than I thought it would. I do believe it tastes better cold, so definitely try it both ways. I also would suggest reducing the amount of tapioca a bit, I felt that it was a bit too much...but nothing horrendous.

This worked out very well.
With a 5 year old this is the best idea I have found next to buying already made....

I followed the directions perfectly and like "hawaii1" it didn't turn out like the picture at all and the taste wasn't even good. I won't be trying this one again. I will stick to making my tapioca, the old fashioned way.

Sounds like a great idea but if you blink it separates.  It still tastes good but you don't have that creamy tapioca texture

Despite having it on a low setting and following the recipe, it stuck to the bottom and sides to my slow cooker. What a mess! I am angry with myself because I questioned cooking it with this method knowing that tapioca can stick like glue.

Turned out pretty good! First time I ever made it. I adjusted the recipe by adfing cinnamon and vanilla extract. It's a bit sweet. Probably could've cut the sugar in half.

I cooked on low for two hours, stirring every 30 min.  I added one t of vanilla and a dash of salt,  It was perfect.  It seemed a little runny but was fine once it chilled.  It does not make a huge amount so if you need to serve a family I would double it unless you dont want any leftovers.

Very easy. Similar in taste to the recipe on the box. I prefer the “fluffy” tapioca recipe . I will figure out how to adapt this to the the fluffy version next time.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR SMOOTHER CROCKPOT TAPIOCA.  ADD EGGS AT END.  I accidentally posted before adding these instructions. If you add the eggs the right way after the tapioca has cooked, they won't curdle. Add a tsp of vanilla. Stir every half hour.  When the tapioca is cooked turn off the crockpot. Beat eggs in a largish separate bowl. Add cooked hot tapioca 1Tbsp at a time to egg mixture and stir it in. Keep adding tapioca in small amounts until the eggs are close to the temperature of the tapioca pot then pour the egg mixture into the pot of tapioca and stir well.  You can now put the tapioca in the fridge.

I made this. So easy. I used the large pearl and no eggs. It was creamy and thick. And added my own amount of vanilla. Fabulous. My Slow cooker doesn’t have 3 hour low. I put mine on 4 hrs and shut it off at 3/12. Excellent

Love it! Made this for the first time and it turned out better than when I’ve made it stovetop. Needs a couple more ingredients, I highly recommend adding salt and vanilla. I made a double batch (4 eggs, 8 cups milk and 1 1/3 cups sugar), so I added 1/2 tsp salt before and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla after it was done cooking. Great recipe and will do it again. Make sure to whisk all the ingredients well beforehand and whisk every hour or 30 minutes and it should turn out amazing.

I just made this and it turned out perfectly. I doubled the recipe, used heavy whipping cream, evaporated milk & water b/c that's what I had on hand. I also added 2 Tbsp of vanilla & 1 Tbsp of cinnamon to spice it up for Thanksgiving. I blended the ingredients very well except for the tapioca before adding to the  crockpot to make sure there was no curdling. I stirred it with a wisk every 30 minutes to make sure it didn't clump too. I cooked it on high for about 2.5 hrs and it could not have turned out more perfectly. Thank you for sharing.

I started the slow cooker on high but about half way through realized it was cooking too fast so I switched to the low setting.  Towards the end I stirred it quite frequently and this seemed to help the consistency.  I made this for my husband and he LOVED it so I will make again! (cooking on the low setting)

I made this recipe and it turned out beautifully. the consistency is exactly what one looks for in tapioca pudding. it's very easy to make since you don't have to stir it constantly. I will use this recipe anytime I am making tapioca pudding.

Not sure what i did wrong but this came out disgusting and barely edible. I read a bunch of reviews to see what people did. I made a double batch, stired every 30-45 minutes but at hour 3 it was all a coagulated mess that was lumpy. I cooked on low because I didn't want to burn it and have to constantly stir it but that didn't matter because it went from being ok to being a gross, gelatinous mess. Sticking to the stove recipe if I'm going to have to constantly stir it anyways. When I put something in the slow cooker it's because I can just forget about it until it is done or stir it occasionally.

I added vanilla to it and cooked it on high for 2 hr and 45 min. It's really good! I beat the eggs first and stirred it with a wisk  several times during cooking I also used small pearl tapioca. It's creamy and great.

Addicting & so much easier to make in a crockpot than on the stove! I did add a teaspoon of vanilla. A little more might be better, though - maybe a teaspoon and a half? It reminded me a little of egg custurd, which I love. This recipe is one of our family's favorites!

Turned out good.  I think the next time I make it I will cook it on high for one hour and then cook it on low for one hour.  Should be perfect with that adjustment.  You have to know your crock pot.

This recipe is great! I am making it now for the 2nd time. Might cook it 2hrs on high instead of 3hrs this time so the tapioca is a little more firm. Also added vanilla.  Tastes just like Gram's!

Don't use the Costco steamer/rice cooker/slow cooker machine, it boiled all over the counter on the  inside the machine.  It burned on the bottom.
Will try it again and cook on warm for a time....

This is the best and easiest tapioca pudding I've ever made!  I usually use the minute stuff, but got this instead.  I tried one recipe that didn't turn out, took ages to cook.  Another was ok but took 15 minute iwhisking on a hot stove, so I was looking for an easy one.  On my cooker set on low usually gets finished by 4 or 5 hours.  I also add vanilla to it afterword.  And use a liner as cleanup can be very messy. Also stir it frequently as it tends to scorch on the bottom best to make when you're t home.

I used tiny pearl tapioca from my local Asian store and that worked perfectly. I also added 1 teasp. vanilla and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup; (this reduced the calories per serving to 170). When I make it next time I may try adding an additional egg for richness or using half and half because the current recipe is a little "light", which is fine for me, but not the hubster. Also, depending on your crock pot, I would suggest starting out on low for the 1st hour rather than starting out on medium or high. If the milk gets too hot too fast the egg will cook and the result will look like scrambled eggs.  I cooked it on low first and then switched to high (I don't have a medium setting) and it's magic!

I made it the first time according to the recipe: 4 stars.  The following changes made it 5:

I used 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown.  Be sure to whisk everything well.  I stirred every 15 minutes with my whisk.  (Which didn't get the entire bottom edge of the crock pot and that burned so next time I'll use a utensil that can get that!)   I added 1tsp vanilla about 1/2 hour before it was done.  It was pretty soft even after shutting the crock pot off and letting it sit.  But after overnight in the fridge?  Completely set and I could hold a spoonful upside down without it falling out!  Awesome!

It works :D

It's a little sweet for me but it turned out. I stirred mine a few times during the cooking process. Also I made a half batch which cooked in about 2 hours

I usually make my tapioca stove-top following the box recipe.  After trying this, I will stick to stove-top box recipe. The texture in the crockpot was all wrong.  The recipe also tasted eggy instead of like vanilla.  Ended up throwing it out.

This was so easy and so tasty.  I did substitute white sugar with organic sugar.  The one thing I want to stress is the need to stir as you go along.  I did the longer, low and 6 hours, and I stirred it about every hour.

It's easy to over cook the pudding, and since all slow cookers are different, I suggest once it looks thickened, turn it off.  It will continue to cook.  That being said, it was easy and very good.

great recipe.  i have made it a few times now.  it is not a typical slow cooker recipe you need to be around to stir this.  i find stirring every 15 mins keeps the tapioca from becoming a big mass in the bottom. i like it with vanilla extract, a touch of salt, and only half the sugar. when i open the lid to stir iDO NOT allow the steam water to go back in the pot, i drain it off.  also if you over cook it the eggs will start to make it look like cottage cheese.  still tasted great just doesn't look nice

I made this recipe using Splenda and Almond milk. I used the same amount of Splenda as the recipe called for sugar. I also added a half teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of salt.The texture and consistency turned out great, just like tapioca is suppose to be. It was not quite sweet enough for me, so next time I will either add more Splenda or use half sugar with the Splenda. I will also add more vanilla.

This recipe was great.  Mix the eggs with sugar & tapioca before adding the milk.  No need to presoak tapioca.  Took a while to find the small pearl tapioca, but I've had it before & that's what I was looking for.  Had to buy online.  When done I added vanilla & some grated lemon peel for flavor.

Could not be easier.  A little sweet, I cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup and added some almond extract.  Family loves it.

David loves it and its pretty easy-just stir every 30 min near the end and add vanilla at the end too. I've made it using unsweetened coconut and vanilla and coconut extract flavoring to put a twist on the plain vanilla flavor.

Wow! I love tapioca pudding but am too lazy to make. Used almond milk instead of regular milk and still turned out perfect.
Thanks!

Doubled the recipe and cooked three hours. Small pearl tapioca firmed up pretty dense in the fridge. It tasted good, but I will continue to try some variations to get a slightly less dense texture and more kozy like flavor..:)

Definitely a new favorite! I'll be making double batches from now on. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a hint of salt, and a little cinnamon. It was done much sooner than listed in the recipe, so keep an eye on it the first time.

We like tapioca pudding and I was looking for a less hands-on recipe.  I tried this and it came out mosly good.  However, there were small patches of egg (as in scrambled egg), even though I mixed it pretty well.  So I advise you to really, really, really, blend/mix it up to hopefully avoid this.  
Otherwise the flavor and texture was good.

Made this in the crock pot and it turned out kinda mushy. I don't know if it's because I used instant tapioca or if it was because I had to cook it on high (since my crock pot only have high or low as settings), but the chewiness factor completely went away, and that is a big part of why I like tapioca pudding. I made it on the stove the day before and it turned out more like what I was used to. I also only cooked it for 2 hours, but again, I had to cook it on high.

Found the reviews very helpful.  Tempered the eggs before adding them to the slow cooker after 2 hrs of cooking.  Added vanilla and salt as recommended.  Very happy with the results.

Add 1 tsp. vanilla! Tried this using the Minute Tapioca and it still turned out delicious. I added a teaspoon vanilla after turning off the heat. Couldn't imagine it without it! Will def make again!

I went right by the recipe. I even used an immersion blender to make sure the egg was mixed in well. The "pudding" stuck to the sides and turned brown. It smelt like burnt eggs. That's what was cooking on the sides. The flavor tastes like over cooked eggs also, nothing like tapioca. I will never try this one again. I'll use the old fashioned way of cooking it on the stove-top. It was quite the experience.

Very good concept. I love not having to presoak the pearls. I cooked on low for six hours, added salt, vanilla, and rum flavoring. I 1 1/2 the recipe. Taste was fabulous, but just didn't like the eggs bits in there ( note I attempted to avoid this by mixing all the ingredients thoroughly beforehand). Next time I'll leave out the eggs at first, then temper them in at the end to prevent the bits. Can be a richer pudding by using half n half instead of milk :)

Can't believe how quick and easy this was...put it in the crockpot at 5 and had pudding about 8. Beats letting the tapioca soak overnight plus all the extra steps and ingredients. Tasted great too! The only thing I added was about a teaspoon of vanilla. Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this and it tuned out great!!! Only took about 2 hrs in the crock pot that I used.  I also stuck a vanilla bean in the mix while it cooked.  Very good.  I will be making this again!!!

Very disappointing! This was a total waste of a quart of milk! I literally gagged when I tasted it. The texture was disgusting. I had it on low and stirred occasionally as the directions said. Perhaps, I was supposed to use whole milk instead of 2%.

Great recipe!  The first time I made it, I saved the milk I soaked the pearls in and measured that into my milk requirements.  BIG MISTAKE.  It came out very starchy.  This time I did it right and it was wonderful.  I ALSO USED XYLITOL as my sweetener.  It has a glycemic index of 8, so good for diabetics.  It also build your bones and helps your strengthen your gums.  Check it out on www.mercola.com.  I got it at a health food store.  I did add the salt and vanilla as mentioned by previous users.  Thank all of you for writing.  I will use this recipe often.
