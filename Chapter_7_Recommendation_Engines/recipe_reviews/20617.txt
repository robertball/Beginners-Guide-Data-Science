this was sooo gross.  it's definately NOT a steak sauce.  It tasted like a gross spaghetti sauce.  it seems like the recipe was created by a hobo who just threw a bunch of random stuff together...and it just didn't WORK! don't bother making this.

This is a great tasting steak sauce. I minimize the chili powder because we don't like spicy, but it is very close to what is on the grocery store shelves.

I made this today hoping it would taste like A1 Sauce, no luck. It was good though and I really like it, but taste more like a Spaghetti Sauce to me. I'm going to use it for dipping my cheese sticks in. Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe contains a lot of the same ingredients you would find in A1, so, I thought I would give it a try.  Unfortunately, this was not well received in my house. The sauce was extremely thick and had an overwhelming taste of of raisins. I very rarely rate a recipe with one star and hate to do it, but, I ended up throwing out the entire batch.

Better than A-1 and other bottle brands.  I really like that it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup or msg like most pre-made brands.

a nice substitute you can always add some worcestershire for a change of flavor, or smoked paprika.
