Wow! If this was just a rating for the topping i'd give it five stars, but I think I prefer the old pie recipe from the pumpkin label just a little more. But the toppiing is a keeper... I'll never make "naked" pumpkin pie again!! I also did find that I had to cook it 10 minutes past the suggested time, and maybe could have stood 5 minutes more.***Note, we ate this pie in the evening, after it had cooled but before chilled. All I can say was it was WAY better then next day cold. The flavors really came together and the texture was awesome!!! I'm making 2 for thanksgiving!!!

This was easy and all who had a slice loved it!

I used two eggs instead of one and 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the pumpkin custard mixture.

This was SUPER yummy! The only change I would make is to add the nut topping only about 25 or 30 minutes before the pie is done baking. My walnuts and sugar were a little burnt adding them only 15 min into the baking process.

Very good! Rich. I made them as individual servings in cupcake papers and worked great for bringing in to work.  Just over half the time in the oven, and makes 1 1/2 dozen.

I love this recipe! While baking, It smells Soooooo good, too! I just cannot stand ordinary pumpkin pie with regular doughie pie crust, as it's so blase'. This topping is like a streusel and we really like it...and fancy that!

What I did differently is, I gave the G.C. Crust an eggwhite wash and pre-baked it in the 425 degree oven for 5 minutes, let it cool some before adding the pumpkin mixture. Used the remainder of the egg white + the called for egg in the mixture. Used pecans rather than walnuts (not a walnut fan either).  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe to a "T". Will be making this one again and rotate it with my "Pumpkin Something Crunch" recipe. This recipe is better when you want your pie to look and serve like a pie.
*froze some pieces and they thawed well(after 2 weeks), but lost a bit of the crunch. Taste was still wonderful.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving actually and it turned out GREAT!  My step daughter doesn't usually eat pumpkin pie, but once she had a piece she asked if I could make her one for Christmas at her house.  It was a hit.  You must follow the cooking procedure to the letter as I tried to make one last night and it was a flop because I forgot to cook it at the higher temperature first!  It has a wonderful taste that is not "pumpkiny" at all.  Thanks Jackie

This is a recipe that I tried last year and it was a hit! i didn't want to make a traditional pumpkin pie without adding a little magic to it. The walnut topping sure did the trick! This will remain one of my all time favorites as far as pumkpin pies go.

I found this to be easy to prepare.  It looks impressive and has a nice crunchy thing going on with that delicious topping.  My guests went for this pie over the traditional pumpkin, which surprised me.

I made at least 10 of these pies around Thanksgiving last year! Everyone loved them! I think this is the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. I used fresh pumpkin from my garden instead of canned, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I will for sure be using this recipe again for the holidays!

Awesome pumpkin pie!  I too used a regular pastry crust and opted to cover it with tin foil a little more than halfway through baking to keep it from getting too brown.  At first people were made that I would dare mess with pumpkin pie by adding walnuts, but one bite and everyone was sold.  The brown sugar/walnut topping for sure made an excellent addition!  :)  Aside from using regular pie pastry, everything else was made as indicated in the directions.  Loved it!

Made pumpkin pie for the first time ever using this recipe. It was pretty good. The only thing I would do different is maybe squeeze a tad bit of orange in it and bake it a lil longer before putting on the topping. I am using a German oven and it cooks different.

This is my favorite pumpkin pie. My grandma gave me this recipe several years ago and I have made it every year. It is a bit rich, however, so you can get more than 8 servings easily. With a dollop of whipped cream, this is fabulous!

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted!  I have made it at least 8 times in the last 4 weeks for several different people and everyone loves it!  I had made two of the pies one morning and in the afternoon 4 of my husband's friends stopped by after a day of pheasant hunting.  I offered each one of them a piece of pie and to my cook's heart's delight they all raved about it!  I mean they were seriously excited about the pie after the first bite.  Two of the men said it was the best pumpkin pie they had ever eaten -- these men were in their 50's and 60's, so I imagine they have tried many pumpkin pies.  I keep waiting for their spouses to call to ask for the recipe, but, of course, how do you go home and tell your wife your friend's wife makes the best pumpkin pie!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  Recently, I made 4 of them for the church bake sale and they sold before we could even put a price on them.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted!  I have made it at least 8 times in the last 4 weeks for several different people and everyone loves it!  I had made two of the pies one morning and in the afternoon 4 of my husband's friends stopped by after a day of pheasant hunting.  I offered each one of them a piece of pie and to my cook's heart's delight they all raved about it!  I mean they were seriously excited about the pie after the first bite.  Two of the men said it was the best pumpkin pie they had ever eaten -- these men were in their 50's and 60's, so I imagine they have tried many pumpkin pies.  I keep waiting for their spouses to call to ask for the recipe, but, of course, how do you go home and tell your wife your friend's wife makes the best pumpkin pie!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  Recently, I made 4 of them for the church bake sale and they sold before we could even put a price on them.

This was a nice change from a regular pumpkin pie.  I'm not a huge pumpkin pie eater, but this was delicious!!!  Even my husband, who hates pumpkin pie, loved it!!!

The flavor in this was EXCELLENT! That topping was out of this world, too. So crunchy, sweet, and nutty!   I tried to use a whole can of Libby's to make 2 pies.  One can is not quite enough according to the recipe, but I decided to just use one can and it was just fine for the two pies.  I also added a package of cream cheese just to try it out and it added a nice zing.  I just wish the crust wouldn't get soggy so quickly because then it would definitely be 5-star!

I have made it twice now, everyone love it.  I use a regular crust instead of graham cracker, due to personal preference.   This will replace the regular pumpkin pie from now on.

This pie is fantastic. I used Penzey's pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed. My family gobbled it up and asked for another one!

Absolutely delicious. This will be my go-to pumpkin pie recipe from now on. I didn't have any walnuts so I used chopped pecans, and it was excellent.

This was really, really good...and I dont even like pumpkin pie!

But with the addition of a spoon of whipped cream on top - it became too sweet.  I will definately make in the future, but with a regular pie crust instead of graham cracker to cut the sweetness a bit.  This pie was a huge hit!

Made this for Thanksgiving and the fam loved it--it disappeared before I could have a second slice so I am making it again.  The crunchiness adds a nice textural twist from the normal pumpkin consistency and I dig everything with a graham cracker crust...yum.

Came out great! I made my own graham cracker crust (6 T. butter, 1 1/2 c. graham cracker crumbs and 3 T. sugar baked for 8 minutes at 375 degrees). The crust seemed a little dark, especially around the very edges, but it tasted fine--still I may play with the crust next time I make this (perhaps don't prebake?) Very easy--I'll make again.

I don't put the chopped nuts in the crumb topping.  I use whole walnuts to decorate the top since some members of my family don't like nuts or can't eat them for medical reasons.  I always put my pie on a cookie sheet to bake.  Don't  place the pie on a high shelf in the oven  close to the heating elements or the nuts will burn. I have been making this pie for years.  By far, the best I have ever had and the only pumpkin pie my family will eat!

Oh my god!!! I always follow ingredients and directions but on this one my glasses failed me again, while the pie was baking in the oven I started putting away all my ingredients and I noticed I didn't use walnuts I picked up the pecans!!!! Great tasting pie!!!

My go to pumpkin pie recipe. I make it every year because my family would miss it if I didn't. I've been using this recipe for at least 15 years. I got it from a Libby's ad in a magazine way back when (I think). It is so delicious! I would never turn down pumpkin pie, my favorite! But the crusty walnut and cinnamon topping make this pie the best one around! Here's a tip for getting this pie to cook perfectly: use foil or pie schields around the edge of the crust to protect from burning. Also keep a careful watch over the pie towards the end of  baking to make sure the topping doesn't get over-browned. Aim for a shade just past golden brown.

I love this recipe.   I have been making it for years.  Only difference is my recipe calls for one 15 oz can not sure how many cups that is, but I think it's a little less.

This was AWESOME!  I used 2 eggs instead of one, 3 tbs. pumpkin pie spice(instead of separate spices) and added extra cinnamon.  I did use Eagle brand condensed milk as suggested on another recipe.  Don't know what difference that made, but it sure turned out delicious!

I also used extra brown sugar in the topping, and used an unbaked pastry pie crust instead of the graham cracker crust.

Everyone loved it and I will be making it every year (and in between holidays, too!).
