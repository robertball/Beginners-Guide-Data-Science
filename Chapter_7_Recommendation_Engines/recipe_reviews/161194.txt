This was delicious!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I cooked my steak on the stove (it looked like rain). I have only recently begun cooking flat iron steaks, but they are so tender and delicious. This recipe was by far the best I have tried. The blue cheese-chive butter is also delicious on sliced baguettes! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great steak marinade with or without the blue cheese butter!  I used sirloin instead of a flat iron steak, it came out so tender and the marinade was completely soaked up by the meat.  I doubled the amount of blue cheese butter and when the steak came off the grill I let the butter melt right over it before serving.

I made this with a London Broil and loved it. I don't normally care for bleu cheese but the blue cheese butter was wonderful. I will definitely make again. I didn't have any chives so I used a little grated onion.

I made this recipe with filet mignon. I marinaded the steaks overnight and then seared them (with about a 1/4 tsp of sugar on each side-it speads the process up). I then baked them on a roasting rack in a shallow pan in a 325 oven for 25 minutes.They turned out perfectly!!It was delicious and I didn't have to spend all that time over a grill. I thought that the blue cheese butter, while good, could have used a little something. Next time I think I'll add a little garlic salt to the butter. Thanks for the recipe!

The marinade was pretty standard, but good.  The blue-cheese-chive-butter, though, is outstanding, and earns this one 5 stars!

While eating this meal, my husband said it tasted like something we'd get at a steakhouse restaurant. It was fantastic!!

We marinated for 4 hours and it was so delicious.  The meat was great on it's own and even better with the butter.  

The blue-cheese chive butter could be an addition to any grilled steak, it was wonderful.

Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I hate blue cheese.  But I made this one for my husband at his request.  The marinade smelled wonderful.  The steak was really good.  But my husband said that the blue cheese butter is what really puts it over the top.  He loved it!

I used white vinegar as that is all I had along with chopped garlic from the jar (fresh tastes wonderful, I'm sure) and used 3 heaping tablespoons of the garlic.  Marinated for four hours and it was delicious.  I also used freeze dried chives in the butter, and it worked fine--although I'm sure fresh would make it even better.  Company worthy and I'll make it again!

This was really good. The blue cheese butter was delicious and really made the dish. The grilling instructions for the steak were spot on, and the marinade was tasty. A little more salt in the marinade and it would be perfect. Thanks!

I have made this a couple times.  I used tenderloins the first time then rib-eyes.  I marinade the steaks overnight then broil them or grill both turn out great.  I also use Gorgonzola cheese instead of blue and chopped fresh Italian parsley instead of chives.  Everyone loves these steaks even the ones that hate blue cheeses.

I marinated the steak over night and made the butter/chive/cheese mixture up ahead of time as well.  The following day we grilled the steaks and I gently warmed the butter mixture for about 15 seconds in the microwave. I generously spread the butter on the steaks.  It was incredibly delicious !

We loved it!  I marinaded the stake for 3 hours only because that's when I had the time to do it.  Also, to make it slightly healthier, I didn't add the butter.  I sprinkled some blue cheese on the steak right after I pulled it off the grill.  i don't know what it would have tasted like if i did use the butter, but I can tell you the steak we had was wonderful!

The local grocery had "flat iron steaks" on sale.  So... I had to try it.  Based on quantity of reviews I opted for this recipe.  Most of my family dislikes blue cheese, so I was lucky to find 'blue cheese butter' already mixed in the grocery gourmet section.  I was happy to buy that for a few dollars vs. all the ingredients for higher cost.  Guess what?  NO topping necessary!  The meat was tender and delicious marinated and grilled.  This recipe (minus topping) will be a staple for us now.  As for the blue cheese butter -- turns out it's pretty good on 'loaded' sandwiches. (you know, with tomato, lettuce, avocado, etc.)

De-li-cious! Followed the recipe to a t (almost, that is- I did substitute green onions for chives)...and the steak was super moist and flavorful on its own...but add the blue cheese butter and it is heaven! (Surprising that we loved it because we are not huge blue cheese fans!)

I did not use the Blue Cheese part because I did not have the ingredients but the marinade was something I will always use when I make a Flat Iron Steak, I was never impressed with this steak but this marinade brought it over the top!

This was delicious!!!!! We used sirloin instead of Flat Iron and green onions instead of chives, but otherwise followed everything else to a T. This is definitely a keeper, in fact, we'll probably make it again next week!

OMG!!! This was amazing. I never write reviews, but had to write one for this recipe. Everyone asked how they were seasoned and marinated. My picky 14 year old daughter came and found me to tell me these were amazing! We have decided to use this recipe on all our steaks and try it with grilled chicken as well. Better than an upscale steak house!

I willl try this again, but with a diifferent cut of meat, probably filet or strip steak.  The flat iron steak was too tough and chewy.  The blue cheese- chive butter was excellent and saved the dish. I did cut the butter by 1 T and added a little more blue cheese.  Also added garlic powder.

This was excellent - I love the combo of red meat and blue cheese.  If you are having problems finding the flat iron steak, ask your butcher at your local grocery store and he can cut it fresh.  It is actually cut off of the shoulder and is NOT a flank steak.  Flank will give you a much diff taste and texture.

This was fantastic, absolutely delish!  The only change that I made was I used beef sirloin steak (my favorite cut of meat) and marinated the steak overnight.  It was out of this world yummy.  Thank you.

This is a yummy recipe!  My boyfriend craves and requests this all the time.  I followed the prepping to a T but I live in a condo so had to broil my steak instead.  I've had numerous cuts and each time I eyeballed it on the broiler set to high.  Definitely a quick and yummy meal

I didn't make this steak, but I did make the butter and used it on some bbq'ed steaks (done in my normal way) and I would give it 6 stars if I could. 

Thank you!

This is a go-to dinner for my husband and I!  It's delicious and tastes like it's from a high end restaurant.  I make it exactly as stated in recipe, but cook it on my indoor grill pan.

I love this recipe!  I have made it over and over again.  The marinade is fine, it's the butter that is amazing.  I have served it to many folks who claim they hate blue cheese and they all loved it!  I think it is because the melting process/heat seems to make the cheese taste a little less sharp.

So so good.  I made as written except I went to get blue cheese and was out so I substituted some really good local made feta. I'll try it next time with the blue cheese but the feta was really wonderful too.

This was good!  I doubled the amount of the butter ingredients to be sure to have enough.  We had over half the steak and butter for leftovers.  Don't use the microwave to soften the leftover butter mixture--it didn't work so well.  But the first night--the whole meal was awesome!

This was fantastic!  The steak is very good, but the chive/butter sauce was pretty much the highlight of the meal.  I served this with asparagus and red potatoes.  The boyfriend practically licked the plate!  I will definitely use this recipe again, and the sauce with any steak will be fantastic.

This recipe is soooo dang good! Instead of using Flat Iron Steak, I used a filet mingon which was perfect. The butter melted right into the meat which was tender and juicy. Cannot wait to make it again!!

Excellent flavor but I should have let my meat marinate longer.  I used a chuck steak, that had some fat throughout,  and marinated it for about 30-45 minutes.  It was chewable but still kind of tough in my opinion.  I didn't have any chives so I just mixed the blue cheese and butter together and sat it on top of the steaks after they are done.  This was good but not great.  Maybe I really did need the chives.  I would make this again but will definitely use a different cut of steak and let it marinate longer.

I was cooking steaks one night for 2 friends and myself. My two friends wanted just plain steak but I'm not a big fan of steak by itself. I was planning on making this recipe but only using the blue cheese butter on my steak. Even though my two friends don't like blue cheese they both decided to try the blue cheese butter once everything was ready and they both loved it. I will definitely make this again.

My family loved this!  I marinated the meat for about 8 hours - next time I will try to do it over night.  In addition to the bleu cheese butter I also made garlic butter and both were well received.

I am giving the butter five stars! It tastes just like the topping they put on steaks at bonefish. I wasn't really impressed with the steak itself though, but probably becuase it wasn't my preferred cut. I'll stick with filet mignon.

My hubby said that this was one of the best meals I have ever made.  He said he would pay $50 for the meal at a restaurant!  I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, as I am not a huge blue cheese fan, and it turned out great!

OMG.  This was so good.  Actually, I have to confess that we only made the Blue Cheese butter.  We actually used dried chives (insert gasp here!), but that is all that was available. It is the middle of winter and my chives and my grill are covered in snow.  I promise to try the whole recipe from begining to end with fresh chives from my garden.

Wonderful recipe.  Almost everyone (I have 6 yr old triplets) loved it.  I used a cheaper piece of meat (Chuck eye steak) and it turned out wonderful.  Definately will be making it again.

I have spent a lot of time trying to replicate the delicious compounds I have had in steak houses. My search is over... this recipe takes the cake! I did not prepare a flat iron steak or follow that part of the recipe. I lightly seasoned some nice shell steaks and served them with the butter and a sun-dried tomato risotto. Delicious!

My husband raved about this steak. We had some Omaha Steaks Flat Iron steaks. They were great this way. We have 2 more left and I'm sure we'll use this recipe again.

WOW! I used this recipe to begin our grilling season. The marinade was spot on! Lotsof flavor but didn't take away from the flavor of the steak. The crowning glory is the blue cheese butter. Don't pass it up. The steaks were better than a $26 one I had at a resturaunt last week. Definitely a keeper!

This was amazing. My husband and I always use our "go to" seasoning for steak but wanted to try something different. We were oohing and awing the entire meal.  Perfect!

Extremely good. Pound the steak, and use Gorgonzola in the butter. Perfect with a baked potato.

just wow.. where do i begin.. this came out awesome.. we had a 1.8 lb steak and used the recipe for a 2.25 lb steak.. like others im sure this would have been tasty even w/o the butter sauce.. made it super rare.. we like our steak still mooing.. bf says rip the horns off and still hear it screaming.. as for the sauce we doubled the pepper and instead of using chives used 1/4 t of onion powder.. ty so much for this recipe

So good!! And easy, too. Followed it as written and won't make a change next time, either. I was pleasantly surprised how little time it took to cook the flat iron... had never used that cut before. Thanks for a YUMMY recipe!

This was amazing!  The marinade gave the meat a really good flavor and the chive, blue cheese butter was yummy.  I cooked the meat for the time given, 5 minutes on each side, and it was more rare than medium rare.  This actually worked out, because after I sliced it, I put the butter over the slices and put it into the oven for about 5 minutes until it was more medium rare.  This melted the butter all over the meat!

All I can is AWESOME. First time I made it so I didn't change anything. I give it 5 stars and next time I will do it the same.. Save yourself some money and cook this steak at  home and we had the asparagus stuffed potatoes on this site...

Incredible. I cooked it on a grill pan on the stove rather than a grill and it came out almost perfect. Marinade was amazing and the blue cheese-chive butter was unbelievable on top of the steak.

This butter is amazing!  Thank goodness I doubled it!  I used the marinade on thick sirloin steaks, since my husband (a meat cutter) can't stand flat iron steaks.  Steaks were tender, butter was amazing, and our guests left begging for the recipe.  Thanks!

I wanted this to be great, esp. from all the glowing reviews.  Followed the recipe to the letter.....meh!  The steak was way better without the butter....and even that was nothing particularly special.

Have you tried just putting steak seasoning on it and then grilling not more then 10 mins per side?  That's what I call a perfect steak.  There is no need to  slice a flat iron steak thin and across the grain, as it it so tender anyway you cut it.  We love them, the blue cheese-chive butter sounds good and goes well on top of a baked potato.

This was a big hit on Father's Day. Everyone loved the steaks. I ended up making 2 flat iron steaks and mini steaks because I was cooking for 12 people. By the end of the meal there was only 3 little steaks left and nothing else. WOW. The blue cheese butter was a hit as well. I also make a cup of butter without the blue cheese for those who didn't like blue cheese. I will most definitely make this again.

Ridiculously delicious!  I used a sirloin cut that was about a 1/2 inch thick since the butcher at the counter didn't know what a flat iron steak was.  Also used dried thyme in lieu of rosemary since I didn't have any.  We followed the directions on grilling time and they came out perfect... thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

This steak marinade was very tasty.  It's my new favorite! I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese, but the butter was not bad.  Although I made it with horseradish mashed potatoes, so I didn't really need the blue cheese-chive butter.  I made everything as specified and cooked the steaks 5 mins on one side and then 4 mins on the other side. I did let them sit for more than 5 mins before cutting.  It was wonderful.

Awesome Recipe. Have made this several times now. I have used Flat Iron and Top Sirloin, both are delicious. Only problem is, now, if my wife doesn't get Blue Cheese-Chive Butter with her steak she feels cheated.

I have used this cut of beef 3 times with the blue cheese butter.  You can do many things with the blue cheese butter after the flat iron. I never knew about the flat iron steak, WOW!  Very hard to find here.  Usually a prepackaged deal, not fresh, even at the butcher!  Well worth the effort to find this cut of beef!

i'm just reviewing the bleu cheese butter, which is spectacular!  awesome topping for steak - i also spread some on a hamburger bun then threw the buns under the broiler for a few minutes to warm & brown the butter before putting my leftover steak on it.  so very tasty!

Another winner, this was extremely easy to cook and tasty. I can't wait to make it again. I will probably add some garlic to the butter and blue cheese sauce and maybe warm it up to put over the steak next time.

I can't believe I forgot to rate this, old silly me! This was my birthday (Nov.17) dinner this year. It was delightful! DH grilled it perfect and the butter is to die for. We really enjoyed it. I'm hooked on these flat iron steaks..always have two or three in the freezer now. Thanks for such a superb recipe.

Yum! So flavorful after marinating such a short time.  Good with or without the butter.  Not a big bleu cheese fan, so used feta...awesome! Made twice in two weeks

I was making this for my husband all the time because he loved it. Today I broiled it instead, and he said it was *this* was his new favorite recipe. He could hardly believe it when I said it was the same recipe I always used, just cooked differently. This recipe is great on the grill, but apparently it's even more flavorful when broiled in the oven.

my sister and I made this meal for our boyfriends and they absolutely LOVED it! I substituted the flat iron steak for new york strip steaks and balsalmic vinegar for red wine vinegar.  We made it with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes (garnished with chives of course) :)

Great flavor combination! I loved the blue cheese butter, but the marinade is also very good alone if you have blue cheese haters at the table. Thanks for the recipe - a keeper!

This was delicious!  The kids don't like blue cheese so I left it off their steak so next time I will adjust for that.  The great thing about this recipe is that your measurements don't need to be exact.  If you like more garlic, add it!  I did marinade for about 3 hours, and the flavor was great!  Grill to your desired tempurature and enjoy!

Wonderful!!! Made this for my husband on Valentine's Day! The only thing I did differently was I marinated 2 Ribeyes in Montreal seasoning for 5 hours and broiled it. The butter was just too terrific!

Speaking as a beefaholic carnivore, this is absolutely outstanding. We tend to prefer more intense flavors and love garlic, so I grated, then crushed about 2 T for the marinade. I also used my Jaccard extensively to perforate the meat for the marinade and then extended the marinating time to four hours. Finally, I doubled both the amount of topping and the amount of blue cheese in the butter mix. This was for my son's 24th birthday dinner and he treated the leftovers like a mastiff over its favorite bone. This has earned a place as one of my top "go-to" / "heirloom" recipes. Thanks for sharing it.

I'm giving the marinade 3-4 stars, but the blue-cheese chive butter is definitely 5-star.  I think it would be great with any marinade containing red-wine vinegar or wine.

This recipe was good but not the best. I made extra butter sauce. I was glad I did. My hubby loved it. I used regular steaks instead of flat iron. Still turned out good.

Loved the flat iron steak, what a great cut of meat... The marinade was ok, nothing spectacular and the blue cheese butter, my husband is a blue cheese fanatic, and the addition of this to his steak didn't do anything for him. I will no doubt keep my eye out for the flat iron steaks and try other ways.

I made this with a prime sirloin - my husband was SO mad I marinated the steak, but it really did taste awesome.  The butter is what truly makes it.  The combo of the butter, bleu cheese and chives goes perfectly with the red wine vinegar in the steak.  My hubby refused to try the butter (I don't get it - he loves everything in it!) and said the steak was just ok.  Together though... just an amazing combination.  I definitely recommend!

100% wonderful!!  Our grocer didn't have any flat iron steak.  So we used the recipe with ribeye (adjusted the marinade for amount of meat) and ended up marinating about an hour (just in case these were thicker than flank steak).  LOVE the marinade.  Tonight we're making this with sirloin.  I'm sure it will be delicious.  Thanks for the great recipes!

I've been looking for a recipe for Flat Iron Steak, I always wanted to try it but feared it would be too tough. But I saw nothing but great reviews so I thought what the heck it sounds good.  I cooked this last night and OMG the steak was sooooo tender, and the chive butter was different but I liked it very much, not a blue cheese person but it was very, very good.  I will cook this again.  I had the steak, rosemary roasted potatoes, salad and a nice crusty baguette.  My niece if very picky but she loved the whole dinner as did I.  Try this one, you won't regret it for sure.  Thanks Kristin so much for this one, it's a keeper.  I didn't change a thing.  YUMMY!  =))

I don't usually like to marinate my steaks, but this was outstanding.  I used it on a ribeye and the butter makes the meal.  The only thing I did differently was used a little onion powder in the butter instead of the chives.  Not exactly the lowest calerie meal, but will defiently make this one again.

I tried this and loved it.
I substituted filet mignon instead of the flat iron and didn’t marinate it, but only  added salt and pepper. Since it was over 2 inches thick I cooked it an additional minute or two per side and instead of making the blue cheese butter dip I just had it plain. 

Except for the expensive meat this is a great recipe, I will try it again.

I marinated the steak for 3 hours.  Heated the grill to 425 and cooked the flat iron steak for 2 mins on each side.  Steak was medium rare and tender; absolutely DELISH.

This is a delicious dish! My family really enjoyed it! I didn’t have chives for the bleu cheese butter, so I chopped up some scallions and added them to the mixture. It was the perfect topper for the steak. I’ll definitely be making this again!

I pretty much follow the recipe, but marinade longer. Did it the first time on the grill, after that I put it on the smoker. It's thin so it smokes very quickly, but the flavor the smoke adds was incredible. I highly recommend you try it if you have a smoker! I used plum wood simply because that was all I had on hand at the time.

This was just an okay marinade. I did let the steak marinade for almost 2 hrs. and we still couldn't really taste it. I'll just stick to a little olive oil and salt and pepper. The blue cheese butter was really good, especially on bread. 
Thanks for the recipe.

This was great!!  I did use sirloin instead I doubled the recipe, also 1/2 as much oregano,  only because I don't really like oregano other than those two things I really did not change anything else.  All in all it was a really nice steak recipe with tons of flavor.

Sorry to say we did not like the marinade at all.  I ended up rinsing it off the meat after cooking and using the meat in a stir fry dish.  The meat was very tender, though.

I made this tonight, I didn't have a grill so I sautéed the steaks in the marinade over high heat. 4 minutes for the first side, 3 minutes for the second. Served with a side of French fries. It came out amazing!

This was almost TOO good...  I wasn't prepared for all the flavor that comes with it.  There were several ingredients in it that my boyfriend doesn't like but I love (mainly the Bleu cheese) but I made it exactly as directed anyway.  I waited for a comment after I gave it to him and in minutes his plate was cleared and he told me anytime I make steak in the future I should make it exactly like this.  Fine by me!!

I made this for my fiance and he absolutely loved it!  he said it's THE best steak he's every had.  He enjoyed it so much, he had me make it for a group of friends we had over for a bbq and it was a hit with them too.  I will make this over and over again in he coming years.

Simple. Delicious. Didn't change a thing except I got busy and had to let it marinate over night. I don't know if there is a difference but we thought it was great. The bleu cheese and butter are. the. bomb. Served with spinach wilted with shallots and garlic, also great. Thanks Kristen. Got some NY Strips yesterday, going to use the rest of the chive/cheese/butter for sure.

Flat iron steak used to be a great inexpensive cut that was a delight to eat.

Now it is $6.99 lb....not very cheap

Execellent.  I don't like blue cheese, but this butter was wonderful.  I think next time I will try top sirloin.  I have never tried flat iron steak and it was very nice, but it was very fatty.   The fatty meat issue maybe my poor selection of the meat at the store.  I am just starting to cook, so I may need to look at better meat departments.

The blue cheeze-chive butter is amazing, especially with more blue cheese and less butter. Extra thick top sirloin cooked black and blue! Then under the broiler to give the blue cheese a sort of crust on top! You can't go wrong with asparagus, a little butter, little coarse ground sea salt, a little coarse ground peppercorns!  This is a great dish!

Flat iron steak (or any beef these days) is so hit and miss. This would have been great with a tenderloin or a usda prime sirloin. Flat iron cuts in my area (Arizona) have been very tough no matter how you cook them.

This was fantastic. Prepared exactly as instructed. My wife loved it but thought it was a little too greasy. LOTS of Butter, oil, and cheese.
You might cut down on the butter and oil if that's a concern. I wouldn't change a thing.

Marinade is very good! Let the steak marinate for a few hours before cooking.  I love flat iron steak and have been buying it for quite awhile.  I don't like blue cheese, so I didn't use it on my steak, but my husband did and he loved it.  I used the garlic butter from this site.  Excellent.

Made this tonight for my husband and family(I'm a  vegetarian) Was told the steak tasted great but the tops was the Blue Cheese-Chive Butter, I made a double batch and it was all eaten up- my husband had it on everything: steak, corn, potatoes... a spoon!  This is definitely a keeper! Thanks!

This was very good.  The blue cheese butter wasn't a hit with the rest of my family, but I liked it a lot.  Next time I would either use salted butter or sprinkle the steak with a tiny bit of salt though.  I'd probably increase the proportion of blue cheese to butter as well, I found it a little too buttery.  I might try substituting fresh rosemary too, I prefer that over the dried kind.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The marinade was wonderful.  I marinaded the flat iron steak all day and my husband and grown daughter both loved the taste.  This is a keeper.  Thanks!

Delicious! I made this one for a date and he really liked it! He thanked me profusely. The only thing I did differently was I used lime juice instead of vinegar because I had forgotten to buy vinegar that day.

This was absolutely delicious.  The meat came out tender and just full of flavor.  I didn't have olive oil so I used regular vegetable oil.  I also added about 2Tb balsamic vinegar to the marinade and let it marinate overnight.  Freakin' awesome.  Neighbor's dogs were on my heels the whole time I was grilling.  And the blue cheese was a great addition.  5 stars!

This was restaurant quality meat!! Easy recipe but tasted like I slaved all day! Followed the directions exactly and my husband and I absolutely love the consistency of the steak, mixed with the melty blue cheese/chive butter atop the slices! Excellent recipe & I highly recommend this for that "special night" with that special someone! They will be impressed!

I have made my own variation using this recipe as a guide. Its so AMAZING. I add some Feta cheese to the blue cheese chive mixture and i also dont marinate the steak for very long, just rub it with some good ole' EVOO, rosemary, thyme, garlic, and basil. Fry it and serve with the butter mixture. YUMMY

This is one of the best steak recipes I've ever fixed. A HUGE hit with everyone I've fixed it for. I'm not a fan of the flank steak, I think it is a very tough cut.  My favorite steak cut is boneless chuck eye steak. Its a cheep cut but marinated its really tender and good flavored steak. Also the butter makes this recipe, personally I won't eat it without the butter.

This is a great recipe; the flavor was excellent, the steak was very tender and we loved the blue cheese chive butter on top.  I've never bought or prepared a flat iron steak before, but will make this again, but with more of the blue cheese chive butter next time.  Our steak took longer than 5 minutes on each side, but I think our grill cooks slower than others.  Next time I will invite company!

Excellent recipe! The blue cheese-chive butter is very good.  Even when it is too cold to grill, I broil the steaks and add the sauce. It is a very easy recipe and a great option for a quick dinner!

I love blue cheese and this sounded great for my steak, but it was way too intense. Almost like eating a straight chunk of blue cheese. If I try this again (since I have a lot of blue cheese left over) I will be changing the ratio and maybe melting it slightly.

Phenomenal!  Love the marinade and the blue cheese butter is just perfect...not too strong in blue cheese flavor, just right.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and marinated for about 5 hours.  We had to cook inside b/c of weather but next time will definitely grill.  Oh and I used NY Strip steaks cause that's what I had on hand.  Will absolutely be making these again and again!

Is there another name for "flat iron" steak?  I'm having trouble finding the right cut.  I have used this with other steak, and it is good, but would like to try the authentic recipe.

The blue cheese chive butter is excellent. Way better than just blue cheese alone and it melts better on the meat with the butter mixed in. I will make this again.

I marinaded KC strip with this recipe and although I had them marinaded for hours, I still couldn't really taste much of the marinade. Therefore I had to use the blue cheese to enhance the taste for every bite of it. I might make it again with a better meat like filet mignon since this marinade is so light tasting, but I need to find a stronger tasting marinade for other steaks.

I hate to leave "meh" reviews, but as much as I really wanted to love this recipe, and still love the sound of it, I'm not convinced the blue cheese & chives add all that much to the steak.  However, as goofy as this sounds, I like the idea of it enough to probably make the compound butter again.

First of all I have to say that I am not a Blue Cheese fan. That being said I thought that the butter would mellow the flavor a little and thought I would give this a shot. I did not care for the blue cheese butter at all.  The marinade for the steak, however, was very good. It could use just a little bit more kick. Next time I will try using fresh herbs instead of dried, the flavor would be so much better.

FABULOUS!I had never tried a flat iron steak - I'll keep buying it. My family loved it - they asked for it again the next week. The second time I sliced the meat against the grain before serving. It was better, but I don't know why. I also loved the blue cheese butter - but the rest of the family didn't. I also used the butter on my baked potato. So good. Thanks.

This was the easiest and tastiest steak recipe!  Made it for my husband and throughout the entire meal, he kept saying "Wow, this is really fantastic!".  To serve it, I slathered the butter across the top of the steak then cut it along the grain as suggested.  The butter melts in between each slice, making it even better.  Definitely will be making this one again!

Very easy to make.  Worked well the first time we tried it.  The only change I would make is to let it marinate overnight to allow the marinade to work its way in.

The marinade was a disappointment for me, but the others said they liked it.  The butter and blue cheese mixture was the salvation of this in my opinion.  I will make the butter again, but use a different marinade.

I saw this as the Recipe of the Day yesterday and decided to make it for dinner. It was great! Lots of flavor, and didn't take much time or effort. My husband proclaimed it "company food." Normally I am guilty of making lots of changes to recipes, but I made this one as written. Thanks for sharing it Kristin. You're a culinary genius!

I don't normally like steak but I made this for my boyfriend and it was really good! I used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have white wine vinegar and it really made the steak tangy (in a good way).

I marinated the steaks for several hours and they were tender and delicious.  The blue cheese butter was unbelievably good and was perfect atop the steak.  Yum!

5 stars! I did not have flat iron steak but did have a tri tip roast that I grilled and it turned out delicious. I think this sauce will be good on just about any kind of steak. This one is a keeper. Thank you.

I made this last night for guests that came over to swim and BBQ and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I marinated the meat for about 2 hours.  The grill time of 5 minutes on each side was not long enough and my husband had to put it back on the grill for another 5 minutes but every cut of meat and grill is different.  I served it with baked potato and grilled corn on the cob.  The blue cheese butter was so good and there was plenty so everyone used it for thier baked potato as well as thier steak.  It was a hit!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I will use it again.

This was an excellent recipe and super easy to do.  The only suggestion I would make it to double the marinade, that way it completely covers the steak.  The only thing I "changed" was to omit the oregano (don't care too much for it's flavor) and substituted 1 T. of Italian Seasoning blend and added 1 1/2 tsp. of tarragon.  The butter sauce is to die for.  I really recommend making this for company...super, super easy and it's a recipe that you don't need to try first before serving.  I served it along with grilled sliced zucchini and grilled garlic potatos.  A fantastic summer meal that won't heat up your house!

Wow, very good, the meat was tender and tasty.  My family traditionally does not like blue cheese, but they loved the compound butter with chives, I don't think they even knew it was blue cheese, and I certainly didn't tell them.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used this on a differnt cut of beef, but the marinade was so fresh and tasty.  It was also very vibrant in color.  The blue cheese chive butter is very good.  I used garlic chives from my herb garden.

My husband LOVED this...as did I! I followed it almost to a "T". I didn't realize I was out of red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic instead and it was still terrific. Next time though, I will use the red wine vinegar and add fresh parsley to the blue cheese chive butter. Served it with roasted potatoes...which was also nice with the butter. Really fantastic, Thanks!
