Hi. This is the recipe author. For those having a hard time keeping patties together, make sure to squeeze any excess water from the zucchini with a paper towel. Also adding more flour will help it stick better as well. Hope this helps.

Dont use a food processor to grate the veggies, use a hand-style grater to have more control and not pulverize the veggies.

I'm rating the zucchini pancake only: Great flavors and pretty healthy, my only problem was in trying to get them to stay in patty form; they just kept coming apart on me. I'm thinking I just need to do something to the mixture to get it to hold, so I'll tinker around with it a bit as my zucchini crop comes in and keep trying. I had planned on making the dressing but realized I had no mayonnaise so I will make that next time also. Overall a really good recipe with nice flavor, hopefully next time I make these I can get mine to look as good as the ones in the picture! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The first time I made it I used rice flour instead because I couldn't find garbanzo bean flour and it was delicious! The second time I used the garbanzo bean flour and it was good. I prefer the rice flour, it gives it a sweet flavor. The sauce is amazing! Thanks for sharing the recipe.
