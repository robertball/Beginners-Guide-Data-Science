Because of LShockey's review of fondant being on the dry side, I covered mine with melted caramel before rolling in pecans. To quote, my family this recipe is the bomb!!!!!!!!!!!

Yummy and VERY addicting!  These are so simple to make.  My little sister just could not get enough of these.  I took goodie plates to my sisters and brother and she was quite disapointed when I told her that these werent on her plate.  Next time I think that I will dip them in carmel before rolling in the nuts to help the nuts stick better.  I also shaped them into little balls instead of logw because the logs were harder to roll in the pecans.  They streched out as I rolled.

While this recipe was totally hard to rate, I ended up with modifying to the hilt to make it work. The recipe as is....does NOT work at all. The flavor is good and sweet. However, you could not work the kneading process by hand, it was like epic sticky slime. And adding the pecans to it...was hard, the pecans wouldn't stick and rolling it into logs, wouldn't even hold up either. BUT thanks to my mom, who came in to visit while I was trying this recipe out to show me how it was suppose to be done. And thankfully I was able to make it work but adding at least an addition 1/2 pound of confectioners sugar to knead into the existing batch but it still dried if pieces were small, and that was fine. It better worked by kneaded the pecans into the batch verses trying to roll them on the outside. However, I ended up repurposing the leftovers into other ways of making candy. BUT as is....the recipe is more work, needs more confectioner's sugar.

Easy recipe, doubled mine which made mine softer than I would have liked so I just added more confectioners sugar until I got the consistency I wanted. Everyone loved them!

fondant extremely sweet. Not bad if you roll it in caramel and then salted peanuts

This recipe is okay...the fondant dried out and it was next to impossible to get the nuts to stick.  The confectioner's sugar taste was extremely sweet also.  Not my favorite.
