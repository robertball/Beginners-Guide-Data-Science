I added more garlic because I love garlic. I also added basil and the lemon juice which I think really made it extra tasty!

This was super delicious. I added this pesto into a potato-sausage soup as a stir in, and it was fantastic. Also, I added it over pasta, too!

I didn't like this at all.  My husband recently had kale pesto at a nice Italian restaurant so I wanted to try making it at home.  This recipe was so bitter and kale-tasting it wasn't pleasurable to eat at all.  I will not be making it again!
