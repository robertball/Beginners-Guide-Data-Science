Used Rice Chex  for the bread crumb since I need gluten free, but this was fantastic! Easy to make and delicious!

These were delicious, will definitely make again.  There's nothing difficult here just time consuming.  The eggs I used were a bit too fresh so they didn't peel very well and I lost one in the process (I ate it!).  But using five eggs worked out perfectly with the amount of sausage called for.  It's a must to use Jimmy Dean regular sausage, don't cheap out and use anything else!

These are very good. I used a mixture of regular pork sausage and smoked pork sausage and it was terrific. 
I almost didn't make the chutney dip as we all like the mustard so much with these. But I did and it was also delicious. I made triple amount of the dip and it was all gone as people were dipping everything in it. 
The eggs came out of the air fryer crunchy just as if they had been fried. 
Definitely a keeper!

Best scotch eggs ever!  These are crispy yet still moist.   1 thing I did differently was  spray them on all sides with cooking spray.   And because they arenâ€™t deep fried the flavor of the egg and sausage really come through.  Thanks for this!

I made this for dinner tonight. I used hot sausage and omitted the spices from the chutney sauce.   They came out very well and tasted great!

Not as difficult to make as I thought it would be.  The breading stayed on really well. I fried it into batches in the air fryer. The outside was nice and crispy. I served it with English muffins and a salad
