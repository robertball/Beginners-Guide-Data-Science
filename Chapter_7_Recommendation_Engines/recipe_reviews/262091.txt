We loved this! Even my meat eating husband enjoyed it. I made just a couple of substitutions. Instead of 3 cups of cooked lentils I used 2 cups cooked green lentils and 1 cup cooked Brown rice. Also I increased the salt and Italian seasonings to 1 teaspoon from 1/2 teaspoon.   This is an easy recipe to use leftover rice and lentils with. I will make this regularly, I'm sure!
