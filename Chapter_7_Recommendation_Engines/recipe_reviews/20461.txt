Read "The Subtle Art of Perfect Pancakes" on this site.  This article has several tips, one of which is to refrigerate the batter for a while to allow the gluten to settle down and let the baking powder start to act, resulting in fluffy pancakes.  Also , do not stir before using as this pops all the little bubbles created from the sitting.  Interesting, huh!?!  Anyway, except for a little vanilla, made recipe as it reads and I was happy with them.

Great pancakes! I looked through the previous reviews and changed the recipe: 1. Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon 2. Add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla 3. Use only one egg with a doubled recipe 4. Chill the batter for 20-30 minutes beforehand 5. Use 3/4 cup milk (or 1 1/2 cups milk with a doubled recipe) I also used melted butter instead of oil.

Excellent. I've been using the Good old Fashioned Pancakes recipe from this site for ever and found this one to be much much better. Batter was perfect. Looks thin when you put it on the griddle but fluffs up so nicely. I use a little shortening on the griddle so they don't stick. My new favorite pancake recipe.

Excellent recipe, they came out fluffy. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon. In the summer I added finely chopped fruit to the mixture ie. apple, peach and banana.

These were perfect pancakes!!!  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the liquid portion of the batter, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  They turned out light and fluffy and were so good that syrup and butter were optional.  I will make these again and again!  So much better than Bisquick.

I have finally become wise.  I realize that no one recipe of pancakes is faultless.  Everyone has a different taste.  In our family, we all like the whole grain pancakes from the health store mix that my mom made while we were young.  I tried these, and no one DISliked them--one of my sisters, the one with the deviant taste from the rest of us, said that she loved them and ate about 5--but I felt that they weren't quite what I was looking for.  Maybe they would have been better with a touch of vanilla for flavor, or if I had used whole wheat instead of white flour, at least in part.  However, it was worth a try.  Thanks!

This was an easy simple recipe that I already have all the ingredients on hand at all times. My family loved it! My husband even ate one and he NEVER eats pancakes! I added a tiny bit of vanilla like a lot of other users suggested but I didn't cut down on the milk. I guess that just depends on what type of texture you prefer. I like my pancakes a tad on the thin side so it was great for us :)

Made these for breakfast and they were good.  I added just a bit of vanilla flavoring...love the stuff and it turned out very good.  Thank you for the post.

Had to add so much extra flour to this recipe that it didn't even taste like pancakes. So I doubled the sugar and added some vanilla, even then they were thin and tasted like paste. And just so everyone is aware--baking powder and baking soda are both leavening agents, most often you use one OR the other. Baking soda is used in recipes containing an acidic ingredient, such as vinegar or buttermilk. The only time both would even be beneficial is when an acidic ingredient is there to make the soda react, which in this recipe, there is not. Leave out the soda and add a bit more powder, flour, sugar, and possibly another egg. Very disappointing recipe.

I used "soured" lactose free milk in this recipe. I made no other changes or substitutions. The pancakes turned out light and fluffy. I served this with homemade strawberry topping and whipped cream. My family ate every single pancake. NO leftovers.

No more Bisquik for us!! Our family are big pancake fans and I found with this recipe to be light and not as heavy and sweet as others. I used self-rising flour b/c I didn't have all purpose on hand so I just omitted the baking powder and salt. I also added a drop of vanilla flavoring. I was skeptical at first when the recipe called for only 1 tbsn of sugar but I followed it and it tasted perfect when you add the sugary syrup or powdered sugar to it.  Great recipe and will be making more!

Is it possible? Have I discovered a pancake recipe better than the "Fluffy Pancake" one on AR? It seems so, b/c these are heaven-sent, mouth-watering, pancake perfection!! I doubled the recipe, but maintained a single egg, used 1/2 WW flour to reg. flour, and tossed in some dried cherry-cranberries and white chocolate chips for colorful fun. As w/ all pancake batter, I always let it sit out and "breath" for 20 min. prior to ladling it onto the griddle. These came out the perfect, chubby, rich texture that made them so filling and delicious, I was content after eating just 2. But did I stop at just 2? Nooooo, I ate til my stomach burst, b/c they taste so good!!

This is going to be my go to recipe when I'm in a rush. It was simple easy and tasted good. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and I didn't let the pancake mix rest before cooking the pancakes. They still came out fluffy. These by all means are not impress your guests pancakes but it's a great recipe if your in a rush and don't want boxed pancakes...

A decent recipe. It has a rubbery kind of texture, which is why I gave 4 stars. I tripled the recipe for our family of five. We had several extra. But I think a double batch would have been too little.

This is a very easy and good recipe.  I won't be buying ready-made mixes anymore, however, I do agree that it is a bit thin as written, and I added about 1/3 cup extra flour to the batter, and it was about perfect.  Make sure you don't over beat it, otherwise the gluten will build up and they'll get rubbery.  Also, add about a tablespoon of your favorite flavoring, either vanilla, or butterscotch liquor.  Over a very good recipe!

Cyndi, 

This recipe was the GREATEST.  I've been using Bisquick for pancakes so long that my family has forgotten how light and fluffy they SHOULD BE. 

The pancakes were wonderful, as if they came from a restaurant.  Thanks!

Dave

Just OK. Made exactly as written. Mix was way too runny and pancakes came out thin.  Still they were tasty, but I will be searching for another pancake recipe and will not be making this one again.

I was not a big fan. Followed recipe exactly and they are kind of rubbery. Did not over stir either. I like mine more fluffy. Will continue to look.

These were a bit thinner than what I like in a pancake.  But they were very easy and used everything I had on hand, so they definitely hit the spot on a Saturday morning!

I thought these were VERY tasty, almost "pastry-like" for lack of a better word.  They were well received by all!  I should mention that I doubled the recipe but kept the milk at about 1 1/2 cups after doubling and the batter was plenty thin.

Excellent recipe.  I too was looking for an escape from those heavy bisquick pancakes.  Thank you much, there might be hope for me in the kitchen yet.

This recipie made wonderful light, fluffy pancakes.  The pancakes tasted great, and did not stick to the pan at all.  The only problem I noticed was that the batter was too thin, so I added an additional 1/2 cup flour to thicken it up.

This recipe was delicious and really easy to make. I just added all ingredients and mixed them together.  Batter was a bit thin so i added 1/3 cup of flour extra.  Served with syrup it was really good!

I have never seen the need for homemade pancakes...until today. They were fluffy and flavorful. I ate one with just butter on it - deliciousness! I don't plan on using a mix again. I did notice the pancakes I made near the end of the batter were extremely fluffy, probably due my not mixing the dry ingredients well enough. Not a problem, just an observation...Oh yeah, I did add a little vanilla extract 1/2 tsp.

Very thin and not very flavorful. I tripled the recipe, so maybe that had something to do with it. It'd rather make a buttermilk recipe or whole wheat pancake next time.

I thought these were great.  Easy to remember and I had no problem with them fluffing up.  I always let my waffle and pancake batters sit for about 5 minutes before I put them on the griddle.  I haven't tried any additions to the recipe, but I think it would be easy to do.

This is a pretty good pancake mix. I added cinnamon, crushed peacans, and dried cranberries for the kick. I also made plain pancakes and it tasted good. I will use this recipe again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made these pancakes this morning.  They were awesome, the only dislike was the fact that I can taste the salt, but other than that great.  I made the recipe exactly as written, they fluffed up so nicely.

Great basic recipe! When making - I add 2 Tbsp of Oats and 2 Tbsp of Bran, as well as a great pancake, it makes a well rounded snack food that can be eaten plain or with a Jam, etc...

This was a great recipe, super easy! I decided to add a tablespoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla extract, an extra half tablespoon of sugar, and I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is the BEST basic recipe that I have found.  I tweaked it a little by adding extra sugar (2 tbl more), vanilla extract (1 tsp), and pumpkin pie spice (1 tsp).  I also separated the eggs and beat the egg whites until soft peak.  I mixed the wet and dry ingredients, then folded them into the egg whites.  Very yummy!!!  It's a little extra work, but worth it.

Let me just start by saying, I am not a pancake fan. That bring said, I just ate 4 of these! They were so tasty and simple! Made the recipe exactly and let batter chill while I cleaned the kitchen. Will for sure be making this again...and again. Thanks for sharing!

Thank you for this simple recipe! I had trouble with making pancakes until I discovered this recipe. I just eliminate the baking soda since I find it gives an unpleasant flavour to food, and they still come out fluffy.

Thanks awesome pancakes. I added vanilla flavoring and cinnamon. Now according to my kids "Mommy, your the best cooker EVER!" They were good fluffed right up. Although got a better color with 1/4 cup of batter instead of 1/3cup like I started using..better size pancake at first though i didn't think the 1/4 cup would be a big enough one..it's plenty big enough though.

I really liked how this one tasted!  I added a teaspoon of Vanilla extract in and probably could have added a 1/4 to a 1/2 cup more of flour.  I will definitely be making this again with a little tweak here and there :3

OMG... this recipe is AMAZING!!! So simple to make and very tasty. I followed the suggestions from other reviews and added 1 tsp of vanilla, as well as cutting down the milk to only 3/4 cups instead of a full cup. I also let the batter sit in the fridge for 30 mins before making the pancakes. They turned out light and fluffy and absolutely delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

I doubled the baking soda (by accident) and also added some vanilla for flavor.  The recipe was good..nothing great, just good.  But I gave it 5 stars for one reason...I have all of these ingredients in my house at all time.  I was looking for something I could make quick whenever I want, so this recipe is great.  I also usually add things like chocolate chips, fruit, etc. and this is a nice simple starter.

What a great recipe.  My daughter will not let me buy mix anymore!  Served for family overnight stays with rave reviews.  Just throw on some frozen blueberries to add a great twist.

Yikes! Got mixing this batch up and realized I didn't have oil. So I subbed in real butter (melted). Wow! I've not had better pancakes anywhere! Thank you so much for sharing!!

A very good, basic pancake recipe.  We were looking for something quick to throw together and this recipe completely fit the need.  Nothing fancy but perfect for tasty, quick, basic pancakes.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a dash of vanilla.  These are not thick, fluffy, restaurant style pancakes so keep looking if that is what you are seeking.

great! first time making homemade pancakes and they turned out wonderful. i added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon (per advice from others) which really put them over the top. thanks! advice - let the batter sit for awhile before making. don't stir when ready to use. just pour out on griddle, bubbles and all. pancakes turn out better this way!

I threw a little vanilla in right before mixing it up all up, more as a last minute thought. These pancakes were O.K. plain, but with syrup and a dash of butter on top they were delicious! They look really thin pouring on the pan, and I waited until the bubbles were done popping to flip them, but they were nice and fluffy! Thank you!

This recipe was great. I followed other suggestions by adding 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla, as well as putting the mix in the refrigerator for a few minutes. I also used whole wheat flour, which was awesome and healthier. I will definitely make this again.

I love that these pancakes are fluffy but not too heavy, and don't have a baking-soda taste. A teaspoon of vanilla in the batter makes them even better.

I was ready to make pancakes when I discovered I was out of the packaged mix that I usually use.  I decided to look for a recipe to make them and came across this one.  It was so easy and tasted great.  So long packaged mix!

Just made this recipe for my kids, who love pancakes.  It was a hit!!  I doubled the recipe, omitted one Tbsp. of oil and added two tsp. of vanilla- worked out well. I also divided the recipe into two portions and added chocolate chips to one and fresh blueberries to the other...both came out delicious!!  Definite keeper!

Beautiful. I added 1 tsp vanilla, and had read some reviews that said to scale back the milk. I did, and ended up using 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons to be the consistency that I personally prefer. Thick fluffy delicious pancakes. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best pancake recipe. I just figured out what the taste reminds me of: funnel cakes!!  It is so wonderful. I add powdered sugar and enjoy!  I didn't need to tweak it at all.

These were by far the best pancakes in the world. I am not very skilled at making pancakes, but these were easy and came out looking like I bought them. I substituded the oil with melted butter and I used brown suger. I also threw in a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon and they were great!! Thanks so much

This recipe was okay. Not bad, not great. It was a little flat and flavorless for my husband's and my tastes. My husband made a huge one and rolled it up like a crepe. That was pretty good.

This is our stand alone recipe for pancakes for the past few years thanks to Cyndi for sharing... every once in awhile I'll try a different one and then I think... "why did I bother?!" and my kids really notice and ask for "the other ones!"  We double it for our family with  our 3 kids and we always serve our pancakes with plain yogurt and applesauce & a little syrup to give it a healthy boost.

I have made these several times (checking the expiration dates on my baking powder and soda each time), and they always come out flat.  The taste is okay, but the texture is wrong.  I do like the richness of adding the egg.  Overall though, I'm deleting this one from my recipe box and going to find another.

This was a good base pancake mix. I have tweaked this to make some more specific tasting pancakes. First time I tried this, I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice which is basically a mix of ground cloves, cinnimon and nutmeg. I also used half white flour and half whole wheat for added texture. I've also added a little bit of apple sauce to this and am sure it would work for different fruits as well. Cooked up nice and fluffy. Three stars because without tweaking, this can be a bit bland, but an overall fair pancake base. Would use it again though since so easy.

These are delicious!   Sometimes we separate the eggs and whip the whites to add to the fluffiness.

I have been living in England for the last 3 years and suffering from a lack of a 'real pancake'. I found this recipe and made these this morning. The recipe is spot on and took me straight home. Thank you for this. Added a teaspoon of butter to batch 2 for taste.

These turned out great, I made this recipe for two 10 year old and one 8 year old boy and not a pancake left in sight!  I did add some chocolate chips to the batter for them as a treat, but otherwise, made exactly as directed :)

I used a tablespoon of vanilla, and needed more milk to make thinner pancakes.. as written they came out too dense for my liking.

Not the best pancakes that I have ever had but very acceptable. I made exactly as directed and would suggest adding cinnamon and vanilla to the mix.

These were good pancakes...however I made a different recipe that I liked more. These needed to be a little sweeter I think..maybe some extra sugar :) I only say this because I like to eat them plain sometimes as a snack without syrup and prefer the sweeter recipes with a little more sugar.

Great pancake recipe! Very fluffy.  I did use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  This was my first attempt at using whole wheat flour and it came out great! I will be using this recipe from now on for pancakes.  Thanks!

Absolutely perfect, delicious pancakes! I always sift my dry ingredients together and mix them with the wet just until moistened and slightly lumpy. This recipe always gives me fluffy, delicious pancakes! I also sometimes use vanilla soy milk in place of regular milk.. gives them a silky texture and slightly sweetened flavor. :)

Great I had made a few changes based on some reviews.  I had double the sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  I had reduced the milk to somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 cup.  Next time I will  use brown sugar instead of white.  This is the boxed pancake substitute for the rest of my life.  Thanks so much for the amazing base formula.

It's light and fluffy. My family and I just love eating it! Have all of the main ingredients that are usually around which I don't have to run to the store to get everything. I add chocolate chips and they're really delicious!

Awesome simple pancake recipe! I will NEVER buy pancake mix in a box ever again! Two tricks though- don't over mix, and let the batter sit in the fridge for a few minutes before using. Seems to be fluffier if you do that. Also, I mix in mashed bananas or berries and they taste great! Also, a little cinnamon enhances the flavor.

Great recipe! I will never go back to boxed!   We were all out of the boxed pancake mix & out of Bisquick, so we tried these.  They fluffed up so nicely and were very flavorful. If I could, thought, I would take off half a star because I feel they are a little bland, but that would be easily remedied by the addition of vanilla, cinnamon, or even some walnuts or blueberries.   My 11-year-old loves to make pancakes, and this recipe was easy enough for her to make on her own, too!  She also said that we need to add this to our family recipe book.  While the boxed might be a little more convenient, I didn't realize how much I was losing out on the flavor, texture, and wholesomeness by using it.  This recipe is definitely something I will be passing on to other family members.

Very good made this morning added vanilla. Next time I will add maybe an 1/8 to a 1/4 cup more flour the batter was a little thing which made the pancakes hard to flip but they tasted great!

I have made these several times for my family and it's a wonderful pancake. I don't like pancakes that are basically huge sponges, these absorbed enough syrup without my kids wants to have more and more syrup added. Also if you want to make this the night before and keep it in the fridge for less prep the next morning it goes great straight from the fridge to the griddle.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I will never buy boxed instant again.  This was so easy to make and came out perfect.

This recipe is pretty good. The only problems were the pancake kept sticking like crazy, and they weren't as fluffy as I expected. Flavor was good though. It made more than I expected, but when there's brothers around, that's never a problem!

I love this as a basic pancake recipe.  We use this recipe weekly using milk substitutes such as rice/soy/almond milk.  We have used it with one additional egg for waffles, with wheat flour, with pieces of fruit, and chocolate chips.  Family and guests always love the pancakes and they are nice texture.

I mashed up a banana and added it to the batter for some banana pancakes and they were awesome!  I would make them with banana or without following the recipe exactly!

Fabulous!  A couple college friends and I have been in Spain for a while, and have missed American pancakes!  I like this recipe, because the one egg keeps the fluffy texture without getting cakey.  And, the baking powder and baking soda instead of yeast keeps a better flavor.  Great all-American pancakes!

I didn't really like this recipe.  It was kind of bland.  Very basic.  I even added vanilla to it.  Anyway, on to another pancake recipe.

I have searched for a restaurant style pancake and this is it.  I added vanilla and you could also add cinnamon.  The texture is wonderful.  They are not too fluffy but still has a melt in your mouth inside.  Cook in butter and it has a little crunch on the outside.  Delicious!

Doubled the recipe for 2 adults and 2 children! Used white whole wheat flour, added vanilla and cinnamon and these were GREAT!!! They are not super fluffy, so if you are looking for fluffy- this isnt going to be your recipe. However, they were perfect for us! Thanks for sharing a very simple pancake recipe.

I have been making these pancakes for about 2 years now; they are by far the nicest, easiest recipe I have ever tried…  I have totally memorized the recipe as my son often asks for them at breakfast, they are light and fluffy, the only thing I have added is a little splash of vanilla to the batter and they’ve always turn out great!

These pancakes always turned out fluffy and delicious!  I'm very impressed and will never use pancake mix again!  I add a tsp of vanilla, and mixed berries.  (I always microwave my frozen mixed berries until thawed and then chop in my food processor, and add to the batter just before pouring onto the griddle).  My 3 and 1 year old would live off these pancakes if I let them!

I made these pancakes for breakfast this morning and was very please with both the flavor and the fluffiness of the pancake.  I had a hard time stopping after just one batch so we made another.

This was OK. I like my pancakes fluffier. I added cinnamon and it still tasted bland to me. It still got 4 stars as my kids inhaled it. I will try other ones before I come back to this one. But I'm sure with some add ons it'll be a keeper.

When I saw the picture of these pancakes posted on the main page on Saturday morning, I just had to make pancakes!  this isn't the recipe I ususally use, but I thought I'd give it a go.  they were very bland and not very fluffy at all.  the recipe called "Easy Pankcakes" on allrecipes is much better.

These were good, a bit thin for my liking.  I would try using less milk as suggested by others.  I usually try to make the recipe as is first.  But they weren't "oh, wow, I can't wait to make them again" good.

5 stars with a quick modification.  use 2 tbls melted butter instead of oil, 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup regular milk, and grease the griddle or pan with butter.  Make sure the batter rests for at least 30 minutes.   YUM!!!!!  Fat is flavor!

yum!!  I added vanilla because I add vanilla to everything :) but these were great!

I made these again and added ground cinnamon and freshly grated orange zest (cinnamon and orange is my new favorite flavor combo)  and they were AMAZING!  I don't think I'l ever make plain pancakes again!

I didn't like this recipe very well.  It was too runny and the pancakes had to get really brown in order for me to flip them without falling apart (almost burnt).  Further, they were almost the consistency of belgium waffles.  I like mine cakey.  The kids didn't seem to care though.  I'll stick with the box mix where I can just add water.

This was a good recipe.  Not spectacular, but good.  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla per reviews.  I may make this recipe again, but I will probably try others before using this one again.

I am new to cooking "from scracth". Pancakes are not my favorite thing, but they are one on my son's favorite things. I have always used boxed (just add water). These came out better than anything I have ever made from the box. Only added 1/2 tsp vanilla from previous reviews. I sifted the dry ingredients and the batter was smooth as silk!  Thanks for a simple, taste-on-target recipe!

Just made a double batch this morning with my son and they turned out great.  We followed the recipe as is.  Restaurant quality that beats the boxed mix hands down.

It was an awesome recipe, the only thing I had difficulty with was adjusting the temperature.  I used a pan and I found medium-high burnt them, so I used medium (5 on the stove top) and cooked them great, I also doubled the recipe because it only made about 6 pancakes

This recipe was so bland and unappetizing.  And small...needed to double the batch to make enough pancakes for my family....no shock no one asked for seconds.  Back to Bisquick for me!!

I use this recipe quite a bit and get great results.  I put the batter in a plastic restaurant style ketchup bottle (the ones that come in a two pack with one red and one yellow) and squirt it on the griddle in the shape of letters to spell my kids' names.  Usually I add 1/2t vanilla.  Today I also added about 1/2c of oats - made the pancakes a little thicker, healthier and you couldn't really taste the difference.

This is a great recipe. I actually used whole wheat flour and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla. I was eating them without syrup they were so tasty. My family loved them as well and asked that I make them next time too. I will for sure.

I used this when I was out of pre-made pancake mix.  It worked very well.  I frozen some of the leftover pancakes and my son ate them for breakfast during the week too.  Since then I have stopped buying pre-made pancake mix and just made a mix of all the dry ingredients to have them prepared and then just added the wet ingredients as needed and that works well too.  We also added in 1/2 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon one time and those were yummy as well.

perfect not to thick not to thin. very easy to put together used only one measuring cup with tbsp on the handle. came out just right! I added a tsp of vanilla extract....also when baking or cooking something like this I always use olive oil and it makes a BIG difference in moisture.

Great recipe; I had everything I needed in my pantry/fridge.  Forgot to add the oil, to no ill effect.  Added about two or three tablespoons of mashed yams (for added fiber and a pretty orange color), 1/2 tsp vanilla and some homemade table syrup I had on hand instead of the sugar (I was all tapped out on sugar).  These came out light and fluffy and were just sweet enough to eat plain (my kids and i don't really care for a lot of syrup or any at all).  Lastly, a lot of other reviewers said to let this sit in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes in order for the soda to activate.  I've always, with homemade and boxed pancakes, let the mix sit at room temp for at least 10 minutes and at most 20.  Until a bunch of bubble holes develop on the surface.  Last lastly, straight after ladling the batter out, I put sprinkles over the wet surface, waited a few minutes, then flipped to let them cook through.  Kids loved them and, surprisingly, so did I.

This is a great basic recipe. I used whole wheat flour instead of white & added 1/4 cup flax meal & 1/2 tsp of vanilla to make it a bit healthier for my 3 children. Thanks for sharing!

very thin, made large thin pancakes. even after an addition of vanilla, still very bland. will not make these again. i gave them 2 stars because it required every day ingredients that are always in house.

This is great for anyone to get a basic start and start making their own pancakes.  The kids loved them.  You can add and minimize ingrediants to your liking with the exception of the amounts you have to have to make a basic pancake.  I doubled the recipe, substituted oil for applesauce, used less sugar, used half milk/half water, also I minimized salt.  Thank you.

Excellent! This really saved me when my "box" mix failed.  Serves me right for trying to take a short cut.  This was so easy and it made the best pancakes!  I added a dash of vanilla, but other than that I made no changes to the existing recipe and the kids and hubby were begging for more.  Thanks for sharing - this was a real breakfast saver!

Great recipe.  Very fluffy.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and refrigerated the batter for about 20 minutes before pouring onto griddle.  I also used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.  Superb.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great texture to these pancakes Perfectly light and fluffy!!  The flavor is lacking a little though.  I tried the cinnamon/vanilla addition and wasn't fond of the flavor of that either.  Today I made them and instead of oil I added in about 1/2 of a large banana that I mashed with a fork.  EXCELLENT!

I've been using a recipe from a cook book for years, thinking I must just be doing something wrong because I came up with tasteless pasty pancakes.  Finally I gave up and started using a mix.  This morning, though, determined to make yummy pancakes from scratch, I decided to give these a try, and YAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY!  Super yummy!  All five toddlers loved them, and so did I!  I made it exactly according to the recipe...YUM!

This recipe saved me from having my family ask me not to make pancakes.  For some reason I always thought I didn't need a recipe for pancakes, but mine were always rubbery, uncooked on the inside, overcooked on the outside.......everyone is very relieved that I managed to use a recipe, and this one works great.

Great simple recipe. Added a little vanilla and cinnamon. Loved the results. They didn't taste as good once they fully absorbed the syrup but by the time I got to that taste, they were almost completely gone :) Will make again.

PERFECT PANCAKES. About 200 times better that bisquick, and the recipie is easy to remember. I like to heat up some brown sugar and honey with butter in a pan and pour it over the top, absolutely stunning :)

I have used a slightly different version of this recipe for years. The baking soda/powder has been the difference.   I usually split the flour with half wheat plus half white and sometimes use some water with the milk.   Sometimes I use a small amount of oil and use a skillet so the edges get crunchy.   Why do so many people like vanilla in their pancakes? Perhaps people have blown out their taste buds. Vanilla changes the flavor from a pancake to a birthday cake. Mine smell like pancakes not eggs.

These are great pancakes, I like that it doesn't make a ton of batter since it's currently just me and a 3 y.o.  I do have to add a sprinkling of mini-chocolate chips for my pancakes to be complete!

I will never buy bisquick again! these were fabulous and easy to make!  I used splenda instead of white sugar and added an extra tablespoon of it. Also added a splash of vanilla. Came out great! The recipe is just enough for 2 people.

The only changes I made to this awesome recipe was that I substituted melted butter for the oil and added 1/2 tsp. of pure vanilla. Don't be fooled by the thin consistency of the batter. I let the batter rest in the fridge for 30 min. and the results were light, fluffy, delicious pancakes! Try adding fresh blueberries! yummm! My hubby, who is not a big pancake fan, raved!

We loved these pancakes and took the advice of Lorrie56.  We added vanilla, let the batter sit in the fridge, and did not stir it when we took it out.  They were delicious!  Thanks for the recipe - we will be using it from now on!

These we great!  My husband had them and he said they melt in your mouth.  We scaled it to serve 15 and we still have a little bit of the batter left over.  This was easy to make and they even cooked faster than the boxed mixes I usually doctor up.  I cook them with margarine and when they are finished I add a little bit of margarine on top.  I even tried one plain and it was really good.  Thanks Cyndi for a quick and easy pancake recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.

I'm about to try this recipe...all I can say is I'm thankful someone was kind enough to put out a basic recipe for pancakes...my husband doesn't like Bisquick!  LOL >>>>>>  Ok, we just ate the pancakes.  All I can say is that my husband said they were the best he's ever had.  He said "A+ is down here, these are way above that!"  I did add vanilla and cinnamon to milk and oil, then whisked those together well.  Then I added the egg and whisked again.  I read one review that said the pancakes were flat.  From a home ec degree point of view, she probably beat the liquid/dry ingredients together for too long.  All in all, these pancakes are extremely good!  It's like French toast in pancake form!  Thanks, Cyndi!

This is the BEST recipe that I have found for pancakes, and LOVED the refrigeration 'tip' to allow the gluten to do its magic...who'd of thunk? Used melted butter in place of oil, added a bit of vanilla, and 'soured' my milk with a few drops of lemon juice.  As for the comment from Whitney that baking powder/soda are both a leavening ingredient, yes, they are...but the COMBINATION of the two is what gives these their extra 'fluff'! Even on the thinner side the refrigeration process made them pour well, and they were BEEEOOOTEEEFUL!!!!  I have been using a similar recipe for years but this one is my NEW 'Go-to'.  Thank you, Cyndi, for sharing this.

The best pancakes I’ve ever made! I add a 1/2 cup of rolled oats to the batter per batch for extra fibre. If you beat the eggs before adding them to the batter, it helps fluff them up!

Fantastic recipe! Tasted great and they were really, really fluffy. Admittedly, I did change a few things: after reading some of the reviews, I decided to add 1/2 tsp of vanilla. After deciding to add the vanilla I got even more adventurous and used buttermilk instead of plain milk. This will be the 'standard/everyday' pancake recipe for us from now on!

The first time I made these I had to use 1% milk, since we don't keep whole milk in the house,and they were not good!! However, the next time I used buttermilk and they were great! I will never buy pancake mix again!!

Followed this recipe exactly.  This is the elusive perfect pancake I have been searching for for years!! I am not particularly fond of super thick fluffy pancakes. I like them thinner, but still having a nice pillowy texture. These pancakes are exactly what I wanted. This will be my family's recipe from now on. Thank you!!!!!

Good pancakes. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, a 1/4 cup of bran or wheat germ and used equal portions of whole wheat and white flour.

I am over 70 yrs. old & this is a recipe that dates back several generations and has gone on to the next generation!  We have a slight difference, use only 1egg, 1 Tlbs. of Baking Powder & 2 Tlbs. of sugar.  Perfect every time and so easy!

This is a very versatile pancake recipe. It works well on its own. However, it is also easy to change to suit specific taste such as adding different spices and or fruit to the batter.

Great, simple recipe. Made two batches, one for my daughter with banana, vanilla and chocolate chips. The other for me with blueberries, almonds and flaxseed. Both were delicious! Oh and I substituted the oil for applesauce both times. Delicious!

This is my go to recipe for pancakes. So easy. If I double the recipe, I use applesauce in place of oil. If I don't double I don't add the oil. I also use 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour. Super easy and my family loves them!

Love this recipe.  I substitute a half cup of whole wheat flour and then use half cup bread flour, then add ginger, cinnamon, and apple pie spice, and vanilla...makes them little sweeter w no need for butter at least in my house.  Of course the kids like it if i add the mini chocolate chips in it too.  So fluffy and light.

Basic recipe would be a little bland, but it's a good starting point.  Add some cinnamon and vanilla and reduce the milk to 3/4 c. like the other comments suggested.

I really liked these pancakes. The recipe is extremely simple so its impossible to mess up. And its great because these are ingredients that most people already have in the kitchen anyway. They were light and tender and my son loved them!! I will definitely be making these again!

Seriously good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a dash of vanilla.  With pats of butter and maple syrup, these are the best pancakes I've ever had.

The recipe was great, but I made a couple changes.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  I also added a half teaspoon of cinnamon.  Turned out perfectly fluffy and delightful!

The benefit of these is that they are very quick and easy and produce excellent results.  I feel the fluffy pacakes (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/fluffy-pancakes-2/detail.aspx) still taste better and produce a taller pancake but require more prep work.

Awesome, simple, small batch recipe... I didn't need to feed an army and this fit the bill and was delicious to boot. I did substitute half a banana for some of the milk for a mild banana flavor... YUM!

These are great pancakes easy to make! I no longer buy pancake mix, and my kids think it's cool that I make their pancakes from scratch. Sometimes I throw in about 1/2 cup of peanut butter and some blueberries too. Very good either way!

This is my go-to recipe. Works so well and the pancakes are always very fluffy. Tastes even better if you use whole grain flour.

This recipe was easy to make, but I was unimpressed by the results. The pancake was nice in terms of cutting, and you could fold slices in half without them breaking (I do this to keep the syrup in place), but I found it too dense. It would be very hard to foul this up, but I do not plan to make it again. I found that this recipe, as shown, with one egg, made 4 pancakes (approx 7" across).

I followed recipe as is and they came out great. I didn't let the batter sit for two long and they were fluffy enough for me. 
It's a simple pancake recipe and you can add whatever you want. I made mine chocolate chip :D

absolutely awesome! followed it exactly but adding a 1/2 tsp vanilla made them extra awesome. i also chilled the batter in the fridge for 10 mins before cooking them and it helped make them very fluffy! i made little mini pancakes (about 2" diameter) for my 14 month old. she just loved them! thanks for the recipe!

These were great without any modifications.  I picked this recipe because it was easy to remember from my home office to the kitchen without printing or writing notes.  The batter looked thin, but the pancakes fluffed up in the pan to about 1/2 inch thick.  Perfect and yummy!

Perfect amount for a hungry man and a normal woman! I made as follows except added cinnamon and blueberries. I wasn't overly impressed they taste like something I could pull out of the freezer. I like really fluffy pancakes. My boyfriend was very impressed though.

These taste good and are easy to make which is great, however, the batter is extremely runny.  I enjoy flat pancakes but these are a little too runny for me.  I still make them but add less milk.

These are GOOD pancakes! I use half whole spelt flour and 1/2 all purpose. The first time I made them I had no eggs in the house so I substituted 1 Tbsp ground flax soaked for a few minutes in 3 Tbsp water and they turned out so good that I do it that way all the time now. Great recipe!

These were a big hit with the kids, though I did alter them slightly. I took the suggestion of another comment and added cinnimon, I also added an extra dash of sugar, and on a whim I added FLAX, which made these delicious and slightly healthy? Maybe not after the butter and syrup but they were tasty! They were not very fluffy, but I didn't mind since they tasted SO good!  (My 7 year old said they were like french toast and pancakes in one). Delicious!

These pancakes were very good. I thought that they were nice and fluffy. Next time I make these, I will have to add in probably another teaspoon or two of vanilla as the flavour was a little dull. 

All though they weren't the absolute best pancakes I've ever tasted, I thought that they were very good and I would definitely make the recipe again!

This pancake recipe was very easy to use since I did also already have all the ingredients on hand in the house.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were pretty good.  When I cook the pancakes, I used half olive oil and half butter on the pan, so they took on a buttery flavor.  I also added blueberries. I cooked them right after making the batter, and they were a bit thin. One thing I will try in the future as mentioned in other people's comments is refrigerating the batter, and also adding vanilla. otherwise, yums!

I love love love this recipe. It's a great basic recipe to follow and allows room for you to tweak them like you like pancakes. Ex: adding chocolate chips, peanut butter, cinnamon etc. I used 3/4cups of Whole Wheat Flour and 1/4 cup of Flour. Yummy!!

Tasted great but were extremely thin. I used the doubled recipe and they came out quite flat. Wonderful taste however, just disappointed they didn't come out right.

The perfect basic pancake recipe made with all ingredients readily available in your pantry.  I sprinkled  blueberries on the pancakes during the cooking process for extra flavor.  It’s a tasty effortless breakfast.

Really excellent basic pancake. A great jumping off place to make changes to suit your tastes.

I substitute 2 tbs unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I also use self-rising flour. And I add some powdered buttermilk (1 cup equivalent) so I use one cup of water not milk. Pancakes come out very tasty but maybe just a tad denser than the original recipe. I found this recipe when I ran out of the Great Value pancake mix that comes in individual packages. Those are actually really good too.

You can't beat pancakes from scratch. Thanks for taking the time to post your pancake recipe CYNDILB!

Made this as it reads.... turned out great! Only thing I did that other suggested was put the batter in the frig for about 30 min.

We didn't have pancake mix, but I had all the ingredients on this list. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of melted butter in place of the vegetable oil. Top with whipped cream, chocolate chips, or maple syrup. They turned out amazingly, and I don't think I'll be buying boxed mix again!

Great recipe, MUST add vanilla as suggested by others...otherwise they're way to bland, I like my pancakes to have flavor before adding anything like choc. chips or blueberries...Very good :-)

These pancakes are simple and tasty. I had never made pancakes from scratch before these, and I'll probably never buy boxed mix again. I took suggestions from other reviewers and doubled the recipe but still used just 1 egg. I also added some vanilla and cinnamon and then allowed the mixture to sit in the fridge for 20 minutes prior to cooking, allowing bubbles to form. Tasty!

FANTASTIC recipe! I added a couple teaspoons of lemon juice to the milk because I didn't have any buttermilk at home.

Great recipe. The texture is almost like sponge cake!

A. Recipe excellent as is- no need for substitutions. A light and fluffy and slightly sweet (due to the hint of sugar) pancake that is a good foundation for any maple syrup or fresh berry topping. Prior to using this recipe, I was always purchasing the pre-mix at my local grocer's (Aunt Jemima's or something like that), but this is actually easier to do and I can use whole wheat flour instead of white in order to make it a more healthy choice. Thanks!

Fluffy, but no flavor and they darkened very quickly, despite me having a good pan and not having an issue with other pancake recipes.

Made these this morning and my hubby really enjoyed them as much as I did!  I felt creative and added some cocoa powder and oh they were even tastier.  I really like this recipe and will try adding fruit to them next time!

This is the best pancake recipe I've found.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, and I always use soy or almond milk.  I've done this recipe with 1 smashed banana in the batter (1 banana per double batch) and without.  The texture and flavor is much better with the banana in my opinion!  All around great recipe!

Overall this was a really good recipe, just had to tweek a few things.   Plus it seriously only makes like 2-3 servings, which I hadn't realized at first.  Think next time I'll quadruple it for my family of 5.    I doubled the recipe and it was enough for 2 kids, a toddler and my husband.  They were very thick, so next time I think I'll add more milk.  I also added a little cinnamon.  Overall though they were really good and the family loved them.  My 2 year old scarfed it down so fast I had to give him another~ and that's an accomplishment!  

Thanks for a great recipe, I will make again, but I'll search the other reviews for additional suggestions.

Really good recipe! I followed the recipes exact, and used some tips from this website, like putting the batter in the fridge for a little, and not mixing the batter too much.

These pancakes are delicious.  The only thing I did different was put a tablespoon of lemon juice in the measuring cup and added the milk on top.  Let it sit for five minutes and I had psuedo buttermilk pancakes.

The pancakes taste fine but they are exceptionally thin. The recipe also doesn't make very many so if you intend on using it be sure to double or triple.

Delicious!! Had a craving for pancakes but no recipe on hand and only basic ingredients, so I was looking for something quick and simple. This recipe hit the mark perfectly, and my Husband said they were the best pancakes he'd ever had to boot! I added the 1/2tsp vanilla and let batter rest for 20 minutes or so in fridge as suggested.

I agree with other reviewers who found them too runny.  They were so thin that I could barely flip them and would have to cook them browner then I like.  I've never had such problems flipping pancakes.  I like my pancakes more cakey then this recipe.

This was my first time making pancakes from scratch.  I only had baking soda on hand so I made baking powder by mixing 1p baking soda with 2p cream of tartar.  I doubled the recipe and eyeballed the sugar, baking soda and baking powder.  Added some cinnamon and vanilla.  They were the perfect texture and the taste was yummy even without syrup or butter.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe in the future.

Good basic pancake recipe.  Turns out just fine with half whole wheat/half all purpose flour.  I usually add  mashed bananas and on special occasions, choc chips.

These were very fluffy, which is what I like.  I added the vanilla and cinnamon, as suggested by another reviewer, so the batter was darker due to the cinnamon (?)  I am used to my dad's golden buttermilk pancakes, so I am going to keep looking, but will keep making these in the meantime!

These pancakes were great!  They cooked well, looked great, and they were fluffy and light.  They had a very plain taste, perfect for adding fruit, nuts, or chips.  I will definately be making these again!

This recipe was important because it showed our family that we have certain preferences in pancake recipes that we couldn't quite put our finger on before.  Don't shy from this recipe - it is a good basic recipe - however - for us - we learned that we only like pancakes made with melted butter - not oil.  We also learned that we like pancakes made with at least some buttermilk - adds that extra zing.  I always add some vanilla extract to the batter as well.  I fixed these this morning exactly as listed - but thought that they would be better served savory - perhaps with some chicken divan???????

Folks, I think you can make any kind of pancakes with these ingredients here. The recipe should be called "Pancakes for Starters". You really can't screw this one up. All you need is a bowl, mix the dry ingredients, add the milk/egg/oil mixture, combine, and you're done. Now, if you want a twist, replace the vegetable oil ingredient with 2tbspl of butter. Or replace 1 cup milk with cup of buttermilk. You can easily replace the base ingredients here with your own design. Overall, it's really a delicious breakfast to make. **Choose brand name flour, not store brand. Maybe go with Hecklers or Pillsbury**

Good and pretty easy to work with. I like that it has you mixing dry with dry and wet with wet before incorporating. That technique has worked well for my baking and even seems to make "out of the box" cakes and things more moist. The batter may be better suited fir silver dollar pancakes. Mine, at least, were very thin and - not yet having a griddle - could only make two at a time in my stainless pan. The batter just spreads out a touch too fast to make mire than two at once and also will not give you the thick cake-like pancakes some may have grown up with. I will surely make again, but will probably do as silver dollar or plate sized as a one per person dish.

These were wonderful, and were similar to a recipe I had and lost years ago. Per personal preference, I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I also let the batter rest in the refrigerator for around 30 minutes before cooking. Perfection! Will use this recipe again and again....thanks!

These were perfect. Just make sure you use a good non stick pan and add just a bit of butter to it once its heated. The pancakes bubble when it's time to flip them. They are awesome with just a touch of warm maple syrup or honey. You can add vanilla if you want to but really they don't need it because they taste fine without it. Even though the ingredients are simple they are not bland. I am not a big pancake fan but I made these with my neice the other night for a late supper because we just wanted pancakes and figured why wait til morning and these hit the spot. Enjoy with a nice glass of milk. Yummy, Yummy!!!

These are delicious easy pancakes and much more economical than purchasing pancake mix!  I altered the recipe to cut out the oil, add 2 tbsp wheat germ to thicken it and add fiber, and a bit of cinnamon.

These are great! I made a double recipe, I doubled everything but the milk (used 1.5 cups) and used butter instead of oil, and they turned out great! Even my picky 2 year old and my even pickier husband loved them lol.

These are nice and fluffy. They come out excellent. We pre made the batter and took it camping. Also add the vanilla extract it makes the pancakes.

Me and my friend were so excited to make pancakes but our dream soon crushed because we followed this recipe word for word and the result was appalling! The pancakes would not rise, and even though our skillet was non-stick the pancakes managed to get stuck to it and make a big mess. all in all It was not a pretty sight to behold!

This is a great pancake recipe, but best used right after it is mixed. My leftover batter never rises like the fresh one, even with a extra tsp of baking soda.      For a real treat top with peanut butter and maple syrup.  Also great with strawberry jam and whipped cream.  Try sliced bananas in between layers, or the classic fresh blueberries or chocolate chips in the batter.

These were great! Growing up I always ate my pancakes with butter only, and while I do add syrup now, I always eat the first one plain - needless to say taste is pretty important! These had a wonderful taste - eggy but in a good way, kind of reminded me of cake! I did add 1 tbsp of vanilla. I only cook for myself so I put half the batter in the fridge for the next morning but I couldn't help myself - ate them before bed! I am looking for a recipe like the ones my mom always made (these are completely different), but I'm definately keeping this recipe too!

This recipe replaces box mix very well.  I did half whole wheat and half all purpose flour and the results were delicious.  I also added a bit of milled flax for health benefits.  Blueberries were a nice addition!  Our breakfast table will host these pancakes over and over again!

For some reason, any time I have made pancakes in the past, they have never quite turned out. But these turned out perfect. This will definitely be my go-to pancake recipe from now on.

Made Pancakes I for my family of five this morning when I realized my box pancake mix had expired. Since Pancakes are so easy to make I will not buy the box stuff ever again! Did add Vanilla extract like others suggested. Used a 1/4 cup measure as suggested and they all came out a nice size and so easy to flip. CYNDILB Thank-You for posting your recipe. You made me a success with the family this morning!

I used this recipe as a jumping-off point to make a healthier pancake for my family. Changes I made: used 2/3c all purpose flour and 1/3c whole wheat flour (I really like King Arthur whole wheat flour), used brown sugar instead of white, added 1tbs flax seed meal, decreased the oil to 1tbs (I was using a nonstick skillet), and added 1/2tsp vanilla. I also ended up adding a couple more tbs of flour as the batter was a bit thinner than my family likes, but these were a hit!

These had a good flavor, but the batter was really really thin & runny- as a result, pancakes were thin. Kids still liked them.  I prefer Good Old Fashioned Pancake recipe from this site.

These are good pancakes, but not as fluffy as I like. The recipe is very similar to my usual recipe, which is in The Joy of Cooking, but which uses melted butter instead of oil. Thanks!

This was so easy to make and my kids loved it. The only things I changed were instead of using milk I used yogurt and I add vanilla to it. They came out perfect. I had been using the perfect old fashion pancakes recipe, but I like this one much better!

first of all, these tasted a little bland,next time i will add a little vanilaa, so to subsitute for that,my brother had an idea about putting little flower cookie cutters into the pancake and then dusting the flowers with powderd sugar and sprinkles for mothers day. they were very easy to make but it only makes two large pancakes. this recipe is great, if you add vanilla!

I love pancakes and this recipe is delicious.  I pre-made my batter and left it in the refrigerator.  I made enough for a few days too.  Can't wait to have them again tomorrow.  If you pre-make don't stir the batter before making your pancakes and you will have fluffier pancakes to eat.  Thanks for sharing.

I just made these and added 1 tbls. vanilla extract.  It's a very good basic recipe. I did let the batter rest a few minutes.  Next time I will try it with different flavorings and use some white whole wheat flour.

These were pretty good.  I was trying to find a recipe that resembled the one's that my grandma used to make!  I add about 1/2c (sometimes a little more) milk to make them extremely thin and also use lard instead of the oil.

I used whole wheat flour, and this is by far the best pancake I've ever made!  Easily beats any of the whole wheat pancake mixes I have purchased for $4!  Thank you for the recipe - exactly what I was looking for.

I followed the tips from this site for perfect pancakes and did not beat the batter....gently mixing instead and letting it rest... and maybe that was the problem. Batter was runny and pancakes were flat, completely the opposite of what I was looking for. The flavor wasn't there either.

Yes, A 5 STAR *****. I love this simply & tasty recipe.  Everyone loves this recipe.  I made a couple of health conscious changes.  I added 1 TSP vanilla (your favorite flavor, strawberry, blueberry, etc)& changed the corn oil to olive oil, changed the all-purpose flour to organic unbleached pastry wheat flour, sifted the dry ingredients, whipped the egg white then added the egg yolk.

Great pancakes! I was a bit worried when mixing the batter, thinking that I might have missed some ingredients because it was very very think for pancake batter. But it cooked great! Will be my new pancake recipe

I make these every weekend for our kids as a breakfast treat.  I substitute buttermilk for the regular milk, and use unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  This recipe has become a real family favorite.

This is a wonderful basic pancake recipe.However I added 1 teaspoon vanilla, 3/4 tablespoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to make it a little more unique and a little more tasty. I also suggest adding a 1/4 or 1/2 of the flour  as wheat for a more healthy spin on pancakes. Overall a great and easy recipe.

Tasted pretty decent. I used soymilk in place of regular milk, which always has an affect on how light the pancakes are.  I also added some cinnamon to each pancake as I cooked it.  All in all, a good recipe that I will likely use again.

This is a good basic pancake.  I did try adding a hint of vanilla, and dash of cinnamon as suggested by some reviewers.  It was a nice change.  I think next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 t..  It was a tad too sweet for me with syrup. My children devoured these!

Delicious! I ran out of the pancake mix I normally use, so I came here to find a tradional pancake recipe to cook for my family- nothing fancy. This recipe is wonderful, easy to make/use and 100% better then the pancake mix I have been using for years!  I love the texture and taste.  You can tell when it is time to flip them when the batter bubbles and pops. I made each pancake 1/4 cup and the size was great.  I will make these again!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I added 1/8 of vanilla, a pinch of almond oil, and cinnamon for a little kick.  With the added taste from the extra ingredients, it is very easy to use a low sugar or low fat syrup.  Everyone loved them!

They were wonderful (: I substituted the oil with butter, and flour & baking soda with self-raising flour. I also find that covering the pan with a lid while cooking makes the pancakes fluffier. MMMMMM.

I was out of mix and decided to try it from scratch. I will NEVER buy a box of mix ever again! I used 3/4 cup of milk and instead of oil used butter. The pancakes were nice and thick!!!

I will never buy store bought mix again.  These pancakes turned out light and fluffy.  The first batch I made were a bit thin, so the next time I cut the milk back to 3/4 cup.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Delicious! Can't wait to try it with blueberries mixed in.

I barely make anything from scratch and found the results of these pancakes heavenly. I added 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips They were so fluffy and light. Never again will I use boxed mix. The only problem I had was getting them to come out even colored and pretty. (I almost always have that problem) I burned my first one, but it was still delicious.

Like another reviewer I found that these were too "eggy" and were flat, dense pancakes.  The batter was very thin so I reduced the milk to 3/4 c and only put in 1 T of oil.  They were much better and fluffier.  A nice recipe, but not worth 5 stars.

I am not a big pancake fan, I make them for the kids...but I thought this recipe was very good. It was easy and tasted great, the only downfall is that they were a little on the flat side, but I would rather have a flat pancake than one that tastes like baking powder.***An addition to my original review...I tried the pancake recipe again this morning and they were not as flat as the first time I tried the recipe. I really beat the egg/milk/oil mixture and after I blended it with the flour mixture I let it sit for 5 minutes. The pancakes turned out great, not flat at all.

This was a very easy recipe.  I also added 1/3 cup extra flour, but will probably leave it out next time.  I added 1 tbsp extra sugar, but will add 2 tbsp next time.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and will increase that next time as well.  I also added cinnamon chips to the batter for a twist on chocolate chip pancakes.  The chips were the perfect touch making the pancakes absolutely delicious.  My entire family enjoyed these pancakes and I would serve them to company.

Very light and fluffy pancakes. I added a bit extra sugar (we tend to like things sweet around here) and I'm sure they would take other additions very well. I served them with bacon and sausage and a fruit platter for Shrove Tuesday dinner and it was a big hit!

I'm looking for the recipe which makes the best pancakes I've ever had. After trying this recipe... I'm still looking... They're okay, though. Needs some vanilla and about 1/3 cup more flour.

This recipe was great. Although, I added a bit of vanilla extract to make it more flavourful. I added about 1 teaspoon worth of the extract. I used the original recipe too.

Really good recipe. Seems simple and basic, but it taste great!! I add cinnamon and vanilla like everyone suggests. I make several batches of the dry ingredients and store them in my pantry, when I want pancakes I just take a pack n mix with the wet ingredients....voila, fresh n easy pancakes to order.

New flavor...try adding grilled white Onions to your pancake batter, so delicious!!!!

Just tried these this morning and they turned out great!  Rather than eating them with maple syrup I made a simple berry compote - just the right amount of sweetness to compliment the pancakes.  Good stuff!

I substitute white wheat flour for the all purpose flour, add 2 tbsps. of oat bran to the dry mix and use only 1 tbsp. of oil.  It tastes great.

A classic pancake recipe.  Some personal preferences: I always add an extra egg to pancake recipes.  Also, sometimes I will add a 1/2 teaspoon of bourbon, I don't use vanilla.

Every time I attempt pancakes they turn out too dense and heavy.  No one in my family likes it when I make pancakes although I'm a pretty darn good cook otherwise.  Pancakes have been my kryptonite but with this recipe my family was thrilled!  I made them exactly by the recipe and they were delicious!  Can't wait to make them more often and am anxious to try with bananas or blueberries!

This recipe was just as good as from the box, its so simple I don't see why anyone would spend extra money and buy the box mix when they already have all the ingredients which should be staples in anyone's home.

maybe I've been lucky and never had bad pancakes.. well unless you count frozen ones.. these came off as just a regular pancake.. I used coconut milk and replaced 1/4 cup of it with club soda since I read that pancake article.. also stuck it in the fridge overnight.. the batter Is thick.. but the pancakes didn't come out tough or heavy.. ty for the recipe

We all really liked this recipe.  You might need to put a little more flour in.  I will need to make at least 3X the recipe for 6 people.  IT IS GOOD TO WATCH THE VIDEO FOR TIPS TO MAKE GOOD PANCAKES

Very bland pancakes, I like a little tang in my pancakes I won't make these again but if I did buttermilk or yogurt or even a teaspoon of vinegar would help to add some flavor.

Sorry, but this is the worst basic pancake mix I've ever tried. I guess I should have been careful and added the milk gradually, because I put the whole cup in and the mix was extremely runny, I mean REALLY runny. I ended up adding at least another cup of flour, then added choc chips in case the flavor of the pancake was ruined..but even with the extra flour it still wasn't a good consistency, and with the burner on low, the pancake was still getting slightly burnt on the bottom long before it was firm enough to be flippable. I've made countless pancakes to my four kids, so it's not like I'm a novice either. I made my youngest 3 pancakes and then just threw out the rest of the batter.

I followed the suggestions by Ester, in the review, by adding cinnamon and vanilla and substituted with almond milk and coconut oil. I doubled the recipe for my family of 8, which includes a newborn; my husband and children inhaled them. This recipe is a keeper!

I lost my old standby recipe for pancakes so decided to try this one. I now have made these pancakes countless times trying to get it right and for some reason they just are not cooking up fluffy. I am thinking that they don't need to baking soda, just the baking powder. The flavor is good, but I think it's time to search for another recipe.

Very rarely do I find a recipe on this site that I do not like but, unfortunately, this is one of them.  I followed the recipe exactly and even let it sit and they did not get fluffy.  I suppose it could have been my baking powder or soda but that wouldn't have changed the fact that they didn't have much taste at all.  I probably won't make these again.

These pancakes are simple and delicious.  They were very thin, so next time I will put them in the fridge, like others suggested, to make them fluffier.  This will be my new pancake recipe!

These were beautiful.  Easy mix, poured nicely, cooked up so pretty.  However, they had no taste.  I will probably try some changes like using butter instead of oil and dropping the amount of sugar.  But I made them exactly to recipe and we were not impressed.

Perfect amount for two hungry adults! I also did what another reviewer suggested and refrigerated the batter after slowly mixing for about 5-10 minutes. Batter will look clumpy and partially separated but don't worry it's just right. I used a 1/4 cup to pour out the pancakes and it made them a good size to flip using a regular spatula. I set my electric griddle to just under 300 degrees and they came out nice and golden. Great simple recipe and you can add berries or chocolate chips if your feeling snazzy.

Tried this one this morning, turned out great and will not be buying another boxed mix anytime soon.  So easy to make, and just about anyone should have these ingredients in the pantry and fridge.

Just okay, bland and flat. The #1 rated pancake recipe on this site is still our favorite. This works as a back up for the kids during the week until I can find something I like more with no butter. :)

Great recipe. Pancakes turned out fluffy and I would consider myself a pancake novice. Next time I'll add a little vanilla like some people suggested.

Delicious pancakes! This batter makes about 6 good sized pancakes, and we freeze the leftovers and re-heat them later on  - they survive the freezer well.

Great recipe. I converted to 9 servings instead of 3 and added 2/3 of the milk & substituted 1/3 fruit yogurt for milk. The pancakes were great with or without syrup. Thanks!

While my husband liked these pancakes, they slightly missed the mark for me. The flavor was a little flat, and it did not cook up as fluffy as I had hoped (even after adding a bit more flour to thicken the batter). I much prefer the "Fluffy Pancakes" recipe on this site; they cook up much fluffier with a richer flavor that leaves you satisfied.

Nice and fluffy recipe with a good flavor. Add a healthy dollup of real vanilla to the liquid mixture and dump a ton of cinnamon into the flour mixture and you have yourself some fantastic pancakes.

These pancakes were incredibly bland. When reading the reviews, you will notice that everyone changed the recipe and there is a very good reason. I would never make these again without major changes.

very awesome! i really love this recipe because it's very simple and all the ingredients are available just anywhere! :)  the batter was just right. the pancakes turned out well too. they were fluffy but yet did not have the floury taste and it wasn't TOO filling.   one small little modification is made was to add a little vanilla essence. i have sweet tooth and was afraid the pancakes would turn out tasteless. so i added the vanilla. it enhanced the taste and made it more fragrant and just a little sweeter.  saved this recipe and definitely making more! :))

Not a bad recipe, though i guess i like mine to cook faster on a hotter griddle, so for me the batter was a bit thick. Added half a tsp of maple flavoring and a half a cup to a full cup of craisens to the mix. kids ran out the door with a pancake in had loving the flavor!  Deffinately will make again, though I may add more milk so that there is no chance for a doughy center.

this was quick, easy and delicious! They are very fluffy pancakes. I followed some of the other advice to add vanilla and cinnamon and it was wonderful! Serving suggestion... use honey instead of syrup!

This batter was a little runnier than I like, making it hard for the pancakes to hold their shape. The flavor was nice but they didn't rise very well, leaving me with a fairly dense, flat pancake. I put 1 cup of quick oats in my mini food processer and ground them up fairly finely, then added it to the batter along with 2 Tablespoons of ground flax seed. This added more flavor and substance to the pancake. Overall, I probably wouldn't use this recipe again, even with the adjustments I made to the batter after the first batch of flopped pancakes.

My husband, the pancake maker in the family (because he's good at it) wanted me to look up a basic recipe for him.  I gave him this one.  Immediate responses from my family: husband "Wow, look at that!" (as it rises on the griddle), son: "Mmm, this is good.  You ought to keep making this one".  And so, we will!  :)  Thank you.

This recipe is awesome  it made exactly 9 pancakes which was perfect because it was breakfast for 3. The only thing I did different was add Vanilla and I let the batter rest for a little bit oh and I omitted the baking powder because what I had was self rising flour.

Not sure why everyone says these pancakes are fluffy.  Mine were hard and thin.  These pancakes also had no flavor.  I even added 1 teaspoon bourbon vanilla.  I don't understand why some people added more sugar to the recipe when the maple syrup IS sugar.  I won't be making these again. Sorry!

To tell you the truth, I didn't really like these pancakes. They were thin, and they had little flavor. On the bright side, they were very easy to make and needed little ingredients.

These pancakes are delicious, but they turned out thinner than what I'm used to.  I rolled them up with blackberries and whipped cream and served them more like crepes.  I will definitely make them again... just not when I want a fluffy pancakes.

I'm just starting to get into cooking and I used this recipe to make pancakes for the first time the other day. I used the ingredients listed but also added a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. The result was delicious! My grandparents, parents, and nephew all enjoyed them. I plan on making them again but tossing in some chocolate chips instead.

These pancakes are perfectly fine. They don't need vanilla or anything else. You can doll them up if you want; but they're quite fine as prescribed.

These were ok (I added vanilla), but I could taste the baking soda, and I'm not sure why pancakes would need baking powder AND baking soda (isn't baking powder essentially baking soda with other ingredients to temper its bitterness?). Next time I'll look for a recipe without baking soda.

I followed the recipe to the T and ended up with pancakes that were stuck to my pan, although they were still edible and were quite fluffy.  I tried the recipe a second time following another reviewers suggestion of adding vanilla extract and subsituting butter in place of oil.  It turned out better but was very sweet.  I think next time I'll exclude the vanilla.  Overall, the pancake tastes much better than Bisquick.

This was a great recipe..and easy. Never made homemade pancakes before and when I served them my bf asked where I got this great pancake mix at!! The only thing I did different was adding a tablespoon of sour cream to the milk because we drink 1% milk and was afraid it wouldn't have the right creaminess.

This is my ideal pancake, although for some it might not be fluffy enough. For me, however, it tastes exactly how my mom and grandma used to make it, and so I am very happy with this recipe.  And for those who are wondering, the original recipe made quite a stack - my husband and I ate as much as we wanted and there were some left overs.

They were good but very heavy ... not as fluffy as I'd had hoped.  But overall I'd probably make a few adjustments like less egg.

Perfect recipe! Mine came out fluffy, moist, tender with great flavor. I added vanilla extract & cinnamon & subbed melted butter for veg. oil since I was out. I made mine with fresh blueberries rolled in cinnamon/sugar. Will never buy a box mix again this is just as easy & much tastier.

These had to be the best pancakes I've ever had in my mouth.  My husband loved them so much, we had them three days in a row now for breakfast.  The one little thing I did differently was substitute melted butter (not margarine) for oil.  Toot!  Toot!  Delish!

Excellent.  I finally found a recipe that the whole family loves.  What I did different...1.  I increased the servings to 6 which then increased the flour to 2 cups. 2.  I put 1 cup regular white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Everything else was done as the recipe instructed.  I put mini chocolate chips in the ones I made for my kids and they loved them.  This is a much cheaper way to make pancakes then to buy the box mix.

Great pancakes! I tripled the recipe and added 2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon, and also cut the milk back a bit, and they turned out great! My whole family loved them! I will definitely make them again!

I liked that I had all the ingredients on hand and my kids went back for seconds.  But I did find them somewhat bland, even after adding cinnamon and vanilla.

I made this with whole wheat flour and it was sensational!  Could have used a little bit more milk as the whole wheat flour tends to expand, but still, very good!

I didn't have enough pancake mix to make breakfast for four people so I found and doubled this recipe.  I mixed in three banana that I thawed from the freezer in the microwave, and added a dash of vanilla extract.  Delish!

I really liked this recipe.  I made it just like the recipe says (except for some added vanilla extract) and I thought they were much better than the Krusteaz or Bisquick ones I usually make.  I am going to try adding fruit to the next ones.

I made these pancakes today and they turned out great. I did not use the two tablespoons of vegetable oil, but they turned out great because I cooked them in canola oil. I will try to use the two tablespoons of vegetable oil next time as it may change the batter texture or something.

Easy to make using ingredients I always have on hand, and almost perfect, except that I like sweet pancakes-- I use 3 tbsp. of white sugar, a handful of brown sugar, and a dash of vanilla.  I often make these for myself for a lazy dinner.  :) Great recipe!

We *loved* these pancakes. I halved the salt and used half unbleached whole wheat flour, and you couldn't even tell from looking at them. Usually when I sub in whole wheat flour I wind up with dark pancakes, but not this time! I do agree with others that they aren't quite fluffy enough and probably need a little more flour to make them fluffier, and/or to be made with buttermilk instead of regular milk, but in terms of how delicious I thought they were using the recipe's ration, I give these a 5. Bisquick is fluffier, but Bisquick is the ONLY kind that I've found that is fluffier than these without being weighted down with "chunky" ingredients. Thanks so much for the recipe!

These pancakes came out pretty good, I personally felt like they needed more sugar or maybe some fruit added to them.  I added Vanilla and a sprinkle of Cinnamon to them.  Without the Vanilla and cinnamon, they would have been very bland.  The texture and thickness of them was perfect, and they weren't overly filling like some pancakes are.

Great Recipe. Easy to make. I added vanilla extract per another suggestion and put batter in fridge for 30 minutes. However my pancakes did not come out very tall/fluffy. They were very tasty so didn't bother me and they were not completely flat. I was happy with results. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy pancakes!  I used a trick that I learned a few years ago by putting all the ingredients in a blender (liquids first) and then turning the blender on low only long enough to mix the ingredients.  In seconds you are ready to pour the mix onto the griddle and there is very little clean up.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this is the first time I made homemade pancakes.  My family LOVED them.  they said they were very light and not too doughy like some packaged pancakes.   plus the cost of homemade vs premade is another reason that I like this recipe.

Made these for the first time this Christmas morning!  This is also the first time that I've ever made pancakes from scratch.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were delicious.  I won't be going back to the boxed mixes ever again.  Thanks for an easy, quick and delicious pancake recipe.

This recipe worked very well for me.  I had to substitute whole wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose flour, because that's all I had on hand, but the pancakes were still delicious with a good texture.

With some vanilla and blueberries this was 4*, as written it was a little too bland.

I will never buy boxed pancake mix again.  This is so easy, and it is absolutely delicious.  I added a little vanilla to mine, but they'd be just as good without it.

I am not sure what I did wrong cuz everyone else from the site seems to like them. The pancakes were flat(even though I let the dough rest) and really didn't have any flavor. My 3 year old didn't even eat them and she LOVES pancakes. I won't make this again.

Delicious pancakes and so much better than the Good Old Fashion Pancakes recipe (also found on this site) I whipped these up by combining all the wet ingredients in a magic bullet cup and then added the dry ingredients and blended till smooth (which probably took less than a minute!) The only change I made to this recipe was adding a dash of vanilla and let the batter sit for about 5 minutes. These puffed up so nicely and were very soft and so delicious! This is my new favourite pancake recipe! Thanks!

I also used the "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" recipe prior to finding this one, but this is my new favorite!  I found many pancake recipes to yield way too fluffy pancakes or dense pancakes but this one has a perfect rise and is nice and light.  It tastes wonderful too!  This is what I will be using from now on. : )

This is a really good recipe especially for me since I am just starting out with cooking.  The pancakes were nice and fluffy and my husband loved them.  The only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla to it.  They were great.

i think these pancakes were excellent - exactly what i was looking for.  I did use whole wheat unbleached unenriched flour and a touch more of sugar, since I used Sugar in the Raw - healthier stuff and no compromise in taste!  Thanks so much!

These pancakes came out amazing. They were so light and fluffy. I learned 2 good tips from other reviews like: 1. dont over mix the batter so the pancakes will be fluffly (and dont keep stirring it when your actually cooking the pancakes) and 2. let the batter rest in the fridge for about 30 min to let the baking powder and soda start working. This recipe is definately a keeper.

In my eagerness to eat them, I forgot to include the egg.  They still turned out fluffy & yummy!  I added about a half tspn of vanilla, as others suggested, along w/a generous shaking of cinnamon.  Absolutely perfect!  I am no cook, & consider myself a real novice, so this is a great recipe even for those like me.

I found these to be a bit bland even adding the vanilla and a dash of pumpkin pie spice. These cook up beautifully but like the previous comment, be sure to let the batter sit only mix the matter until combined! I'm still a fan of the "Old fashioned pancakes" found on this site.

I've tried tons of pancake recipes.  This is by far the best.  I've added 1 tablespoon of mexican vanilla into the milk.  Absolutely amazing.  Great with chocolate chips too.

I made these with skim milk, but I think that even if I had used whole milk it would have turned out too thin.  I added more flour to make it thicker.  I also added some vanilla (1 tsp.), because pancakes always taste a little bland to me.  And I added chopped pecans (1/2 to 3/4 cup).  They were really good with the changes.

My family always rates pancakes 5 stars no matter what. But I really thought these were great! Fluffy, and the taste was wonderful (I added Vanilla). And we added fresh strawberries to the batter, those were outstanding.

Good and simple recipe--very tender pancakes.  You may want to start with lower heat level for your griddle/skillet.  I used pro-quality stainless steel skillet, and burned the first 2-3 with the heat at medium/medium-high.  I ended up using medium-low heat and the cakes were beautiful.

These were great!  I'm not the greatest cook, but I really wanted to try pancakes from scratch.  I used 3/4 cup milk and added vanilla like other viewers suggested and they tasted awesome.. fluffed up perfectly too!  I didn't have a griddle, so i used a non-stick frying pan and they still tasted so good!

This was a great recipe.  It wasn't too difficult to make and they tasted perfect!  I did add cinnamon and vanilla, and I used butter instead of oil, but everything else I kept the same.  I would definitely use this recipe again!

These tasted a little flat to me.  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and they still did not have much of a taste.  I will stick to my usual buttermilk pancake recipe.

I doubled the recipe for these and added some sliced bananas and cinnamon.  They turned out really yummy.  They were a great texture, not too thick or dense, but just nicely fluffy and moist.  A great, simple pancake recipe which you can easily customize with any additions you want.  Everyone who tried them really enjoyed them.  Maybe next time I'll make apple, or blueberry, or whole wheat.

Update: Today I made these with whole wheat flour, cinnamon, blueberries, and almond extract.  They were delicious.  What a great recipe that can be spiced up so many ways.

I was going to post my mom's recipe that she's been using for years, and I saw that this is the exact same one! The only thing we don't use is the salt. It's so easy, and so yummy!

I made these for my girls last night for supper and they were so delicious!  The only changes I made was bread flour (it was all I had) and then I added a smidge of vanilla to the liquid.  Thank you so much, I will make these over box mix anyday!

I made these for Father's Day but forgot to come back here and review the recipe!  These pancakes were AMAZING, the best I've ever made or eaten.  They were delicious - very light and fluffy.  I doubled the recipe, but used only 1 egg, per the previous reviews.  This is my "pancake keeper" recipe!  Thank you!

My hubby and I thought this recipe was great. I used to make my pancakes using Bisquick, but was out this morning and wanted pancakes really bad...so I found this one. I will never buy Bisquick again!! The only thing I did differently was I used just 1 egg white instead of the entire egg and the pancakes were very fluffy!! Made 5 medium sized pancakes.

I made these pancakes for the first time this morning.  They were delicious!  I followed the recipe as is, and didn't think they were too eggy.  They were perfect!  Since I only have a wok and a couple of pots in my kitchen, I used a wok to make one mini pancake at a time.  It took a while, but it was worth it!  I got 12 mini pancakes out of the original recipe.  I also made my own syrup for it:  Bring 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar (I used dark brown), 1/4 cup water, and about 1/2 tsp. vanilla to a boil in a small saucepan.  Serve warm.  Store leftovers in the refrigerator and microwave for 15 seconds, or until warm, to serve again.

These pancakes were really good.  It was the first time that I made pancakes from scratch that actually turned out.  I doubled the recipes except for the egg like other people did.  I also add a tsp of vanilla.  Every ingridient needed for the recipe we already had in the kitchen, and they were super easy to make.  My mom, dad, and I really loved them. I made plain, blueberry, m&m, and shredded coconut pancakes.  I will definitley use this recipe every time I make pancakes.

The first time I tried this recipe, I thought it was pretty good but a little too dense and eggy - also it didn't make enough. So the next time, I doubled the recipe, but still used only one egg and it came out fantastic.  The cakes were thicker and fluffier, with no eggy flavor (i know some people might like that flavor, but I'm not a fan.) These pancakes are so easy and fast to make, and with less egg it was just right.  With a recipe this easy and good, you won't ever need pancake mix again!

My daughter is allergic to eggs so we made this recipe with out eggs and used ener-g egg replacer instead.  For people with egg allergies this recipe is GREAT.  (It actually tastes like real pancakes!) I increased the oil and milk slightly and used three teaspoons of egg replacer mixed in 2 Tbsp. hot water.

Gooood pancakes.  I, too, added 1 1/2 T sugar, 1 t vanilla, and beat/folded in the egg white as mentioned below.  I also added a good dash of fresh nutmeg, which we've become addicted to.  For those in my family with a sweet tooth I dropped in semisweet chocolate chunks.  I had left my old reliable recipe back home in another state, and was in a pinch and a little worried.  This turned out great.  When I poured the batter, I thought it a little thin, but it puffed up just that perfect little bit to create the quintessential pancake.  The best base recipe, thank you!

ridiculously delicious! i love pancakes and i'm very very picky. the only store-bought mix i thought was incredible was the aunt jemima FROZEN pancake batter. everything lese (i've tried ALL kinds of store bought batters and powders) are just ok. this is the first time i've ever made my own and this one was GREAT! it was perfect! i followed the tip below about (1) beating the egg whites separately and adding it last (2) not overbeating the batter (3) adding 1 tsp vanilla and (4) 1.5 tablespoons of sugar. i don't know if all that made all the difference, but these pancakes were just perfect! yummy! thanks so much!

I woke up this morning with a craving for pancakes, but since we were out of pancake mix, I thought I was out of luck.  I decided to check Allrecipies and found several simple pancake mixes, this one seemed the easiest with the best reviews, so I tried it.  It was pretty good.  I added some extra flour because the batter seemed a bit runny, but I think I may have added too much, because they seemed a bit dry.  Maybe I should have added a little extra oil too, or a little less flour.  I also added a tsp. of vanilla and some mini chocolate chips.  If given the choice, I think I still prefer Krusteaz pancake mix, but this definately satisfied my craving quickly and easily!

Great recipe. I used whole wheat flour because I like a grainy pancake. Noticed some reviewers completely changed recipe by adding vanilla, cinnamon, whole wheat flour, etc. I will never understand how people think they are making the recipe. Using a recipe as a guide to make to personal taste is fine. However, give recipe maker fair shake by making as is or as close as possible & then rate it. Just my thoughts

Into my recipe book they go. Perfect pancakes. Made the original recipe for my boyfriend, then made myself a gluten free batch using 1 1/3 cup freshly ground oat flour (I grind my own), and they both turned out wonderful. I use a nonstick pan not greased, as I found the batter to spread too far when using oil. And I start on medium heat and end up turning it down a bit. But it all depends on your pan and stovetop! They can also be frozen, then I thaw them a bit and toss them in the toaster for a quick breakfast or snack. I made a second batch just to freeze, and gave a celiac friend the recipe for my gf rendition the same day I first made them.

One of  my go to recipes for pancakes-quick, easy and delicious!  I usually double the recipe and replace one cup of the all purpose flour with white whole wheat flour and  coconut oil in place of the other with a tsp. of vanilla. It is thin at first but fluffs up while it cooks.   My favorite version is adding blueberries and pecans, yum!

I made it according to the recipe, and it made good pancakes. They weren't as good as my typical recipe, but they were easier and didn't require special ingredients. I will make these again when I need to putter the dry and wet ingredients in advance our when I'm in a hurry.

Classic. Similar to results with standard Jiffy Mix box recipe.
Doubled well, went with 3 eggs in a double batch for a bit of extra rise.
These also freeze well and reheat in a standard slot toaster.

First I whipped the eggs then added the milk and the oil. then I added the sugar. Then I added the rest of the dry ingredients. Afterward, I added two teaspoons of vanilla extract (made 9 servings) to add a touch of sweet. It turned out really yummy. Thanks!~

Very easy and delicious... But we curdle the milk before to make them even more fluffy. Love them so much that we have them quite often! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a flavorless blob.  The dough was thick and I had to add more milk, oil, salt and an egg to rescue.  I will go back to the recipe that uses buttermilk.

Skipped the baking powder and baking soda and used self rising flour since it was all I had available for 'Pancake Challenge' inspired breakfast with my nephews and it was the perfect batter consistency. We will be having more challenges in the future.

Holy cow! This is INCREDIBLE!! My mom made this for a family  breakfast and they were amazing! So I decided to make it for my own and they turned out the same way: DELICIOUS! The best part is that the batter takes two minutes to whip up and a two minute cooking time. The batter is also simply delicious and uses barely ingredients. So, if you are debating whether or not to make this, THERE IS NO DEBATING TO DO!

This was good after I added a lot more flour.  The flour to milk ratio seems way off. It was way too thin.

I like a more hearty pancake, so I omitted 1/4 cup of the flour and added ground flax and oat flour to make the difference. I also added a little vanilla extract.  They were delicious.  This is an excellent base pancake recipe.

Good. It is nice to find a recipe that makes a nice amount for just 2 people.  This made 6 medium pancakes which the 2 of us had with bacon. Lovely Sunday breakfast.  I put the wet ingredients in the blender, quick whiz, then the dry, whiz again, then let rest for 15-20 minutes.  Easy to pour.

A great basic recipe.  The batter was thin. I would recommend sifting the flour and letting the batter rest for at least 5 minutes or so. With that said my kids devoured these pancakes. Update: I made these again and reduced the milk to 3/4 cup without sifting. Much better!

The only change I made was to "sour" the milk with white vinegar to mimic buttermilk (the acidic ingredient for the baking powder?). I added almost all of the milk and the batter was really thin. I let it rest in the fridge while frying my sausage.  I will say that the flavor is great, the texture was good too, not rubbery as one said. I probably would add just a tad less milk next time, but I may be a convert to flatter pancakes!

Marvelous. Let sit 15-30 mins to make bubbles and don't re-stir before pouring. Added chocolate chips while cooking and it came out wonderful.

Good recipe, not completely fool-proof. I still managed to mess this one up. Made them too thick. I am a pancake failure. I'm still searching for the recipe that defies my luck.

Phenomenal taste! I recommend either using less milk (maybe 3/4 cup) or adding a bit more flour or flax seed to thicken just a bit more.

WAAAAYYYYY too thin for my altitude. But once I corrected for that, the flavor was awesome! I added blueberries, because I love blueberries, but if you're making these at any altitude above sea level, add at least 1/2 cup of flour.

I made it just as instructed and the batter was so thin it was like water. The pancakes turned out flimsy and not fluffy at all. Even after adding another cup of flour they were very thin.

Didn't work for me. Pancakes were flat (not fluffy at all) and not a lot of flavor.  Batter was very thin as well. Not worth the time and  anticipation. Will try another recipe.

We make a massive batch of these pancakes about once a month, and then freeze the extra for quick breakfasts during the week.   Great basic recipe that the kids love.

This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was the amount of sugar. I used 3 tablespoons of sugar and it was still pretty sweet, my kids ate them without syrup but my advice is to let the batter rest for 15-20 minutes it will relax the gluten making it more tender after cooking.

I followed this exactly. The flavor was good but I was disappointed with the texture. The batter was thin and did not rise much. I'll keep looking for a better reciepe.

I only rated this a 4 because it seemed to be missing something at first. so i added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and it was perfect!

These are so amazing they r easy to make and they r so delicious. At first i thought the batter wasn't thick enough but i wanted to see what happened before adding more flour. Sure enough they came through and they turned out amazing.  For sure I am making these again.

I hadn't made homemade pancakes for a while so when I saw this recipe I was excited because I had everything on hand. These were easy and good. My family enjoyed the taste and with the pancake syrup they were very good.I actually put the batter in an empty squeeze bottle and that let me easily make any size pancake I wanted. I think I'll be making them again tomorrow.

I've made this many times--it is my family's favorite regular pancake recipe.  I usually add more oil, which makes for thinner, more moist pancakes.

I followed the recipe exactly except used buttermilk (homemade w/ 1/4 c lemon juice and 3/4 whole milk and let sit for 5+ min) and added a dash of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. These pancakes were PERFECT!  I'm not a big pancake person, especially if they turn out chewy. The consistency of this recipe is a little more like a crepe and it is just to my liking. I will definitely use this again. 2 thumbs up!

No flavor and greasy, I hated this recipe. I made two pancakes, had my first taste and was hugely disappointed because they had no flavor at all. I added a teaspoon of sugar and two sprinkles of salt to the next batch and still - no flavor.

I made this recipe for breakfast one day. They are great pancakes but I found they were a little dry, nothing a little syrup can't fix. I also added cinnamon and vanilla to "spice it up" a bit.

Our favorite pancake recipe to date.  It's good as is but sometimes I add about 1/4 cup more flour to make thick pancakes.  Especially if I have bacon grease left over from making bacon.

This is a great recipe. A couple of changes...I used coconut sugar instead of white, added 1tsp of vanilla and FORGOT to add the oil to the batter. Even so, they were delicious and fluffy, a great alternative to a store-bought mix.

Made as directed. Pretty standard thinnish pancakes but flavor was eh. I made them again with buttermilk, 1 tsp vanilla, and butter on the griddle and they were better but still not a worthy weekend splurge.

I've made the pancakes exactly like this and it never failed me. One important tip that I find works best is to let your egg and milk sit at room temperature. Today I added a quarter teaspoon of vanilla and some chopped up pecans and made a pecan pancakes. They were absolutely delicious try it I think you will love it to!!

I used butter instead of vegetable oil (because butter is always better!) And these turned out great. Simple recipe, it's now my go-to!

My husband and daughter enjoy them and they taste good.  But they are way too dense for my taste.

I will definitely make these again! We loved them and to make them a bit healthier I used whole wheat flour to make my healthy pancakes. The only problem I had was flipping the pancakes. They didn't fall apart but it was kinda hard to flip. But then again I'm only 12 lol :)

I was looking for a good basic pancake recipe and this one fit the bill. I made two batches. The first batch was the test batch, I followed the directions exactly. They were great! So I decided to use the recipe again this past weekend.
The second batch, I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the recipe. They were even better!
I served them with bacon and  my weekend houseguests were pleased, as was the one-armed maid. (my gf)

Good recipe but less sugar, maybe 1/3-1/2 less and some vanilla extract.  Taste was just too sweet - the syrup is supposed to cover that

These pancakes were deliciously light & fluffy. I took Jillian's suggestion to use only 2 tbsp of sugar. I added 1/4 cup more of flour. I used a cup of buttermilk & 1/4 cup of milk, and also 2 tbsp of butter instead of oil. I left out the baking powder. Taste better than any pancake mixture I've ever used.

EASY! Gotta play with the milk to flour ratio for your preferred thickness. I also used coconut oil; careful: coconut oil solidifies with the cold temperature of the milk or refrigeration. Otherwise easy, good base mix to modify with preferred oil, cinnamon, vanilla, fruits and or chocolate.

Very fluffy and easy to make. Not a lot of flavor, so I recommend adding some vanilla extract and/or cinnamon to make them perfect.

These were great and it's a nice, quick recipe.  I followed LORRIE56's advice and refrigerated the batter for 20 minutes before making them.  Don't know if that made a difference but it sure didn't hurt as they turned out nice and fluffy!

We just finished devouring our first two batches.  They really are the delicious pancakes.  We made one batch as written, and a second batch with half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose.  The second batch were almost as light and fluffy as the all-purpose.  
I agree with the other reviewers, these pancakes puff up perfectly and are much better than the Good Old Fashioned Pancakes on this site.  The Good Old Fashioned Pancakes almost look like biscuits when they puff, yes- they puff that high.  These were excellent.  The next time we make these, we will add a tsp of vanilla extract (and continue to use 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all-purpose flour).
Thank you for a great recipe!

Wonderfully easy recipe.  My son is a pancake connoisseur and loves it.  They were I would actually give a 4.5 but there is no way to give a half star.  I thought them a bit thin but delicious all the same.

I've been making this recipe for several years. Initially, I mixed it avoiding to the recipe. After about the third time making them, I decided to start adding about 1 tsp vanilla which improved them greatly. A couple of weeks ago, I had the idea to use homemade buttermilk in place of regular milk. The results were fantastic! They are fluffier, lighter, and seem to have a better flavor.

This was my 2nd pancake recipie to try and it turned out a million times better than I could have hoped. Perfect consistency, fluffy but not too thin. I highly recommend it! I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla extract and it was scrumptious!

I made this recipe this morning, made way to thick pancakes w biscuick so since I've been on a pancake kick wanting the perfect flavor and texture I searched for a classic recipe... I followed the recipe, maybe my egg was too big, I used melted butter in place of oil... I used vanilly flavor... & a Lil cin. My pancakes tasted OK. My 4yo thought they were good. I think I just have higher expectations for my pancakes lol they tasted eggy, and I'd like em to b just a little thicker... Adding a Lil flour but didn't help. Anywho my search will b continued on!! :) my pancake pic I have like 5 of em on my plate too! Good. But eggy and thin

These are FANTASTIC. The thing is, they don't brown very easily, and could use a little more salt (I think that's more of a me problem though)

I've made as is and it is great! When I ran out of milk I subbed with yogurt and added water until it had a thick muffin batter consistency. A little Pam on a skillet and spoon the batter into shape and a lovely thick pancake. Even Better!!!!!

The recipe AS IS, is not very good. Flat, rubbery pancakes. I made this recipe because of the high rating, I should not have to read through all of the reviews to find out what everyone did to make this a 5 star recipe. Please review the recipe as it is!! I will not make this recipe again.

Great recipe and very, very easy. After reading some of the reviews here I always add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the pancake batter. I love this recipe and I make it almost every weekend! The batter makes the most delicious pancakes ever!

Really great easy simple recipe. I read reviews and tweaked a few things. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/3 extra cup of flour and let the batter sit in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before cooking. They turned out fluffy and much better than from the box!

This is a great recipe if you like thinner pancakes, which I do!  We've made this many times and it is really good as written.  If you like thick pancakes this recipe is not really for you.  Also, the description says it feeds a family of seven.  There's no way that would feed seven people unless there's a lot of other sides.  I'd say it feeds 4.  We've also tried subbing out the milk for almond milk and that works great.  I've added vanilla, which we think is a nice addition, but not necessary.  Mmm!

I found it had too much baking soda, sugar and salt, I also only got 4 pancakes out of the mix.   they came out really fluffy, I have always mixed in a blender for a few seconds my pancake batter, maybe that's why they were so fluffy.
I might try it again with some tweaks.

This is my go-to pancake recipe.  They always turn out perfect and have never had problems with them.  I follow the recipe which is very easy and double it for my husband and myself as I never know when I'll need an extra one.  I've tried others, but none compare.  Easy and delish!

In my search for my perfect pancake, I tried this recipe. The flavor was ok, my kids said they liked it, but in trying to rid my house of any bisquick I just couldn't trade my box for this scratch recipe. The pancakes were somewhat fluffy but they shriveled up after coming off the skillet and the centers were a little chewy. Maybe my standards for fluffy are skewed, I want International House of Pancakes fluffy, but this wasn't. They were not awful by any means, but just weren't for me. Thank you though.

These are really simple to make and come out fantastic. I read some of the ratings and those that say the batter came out "runny" might need to check their measurements. My step-kids love these and ask for them all the time. I add a little vanilla for a special taste.

My go to recipe for pancakes. The only thing I add is chocolate chips. Remember to sift the flour mixture a few times before combining the wet and dry ingredients and don't over mix. This will give you fluffy, tender pancakes.

I love this recipe! I was on vacation at my mothers when I tried this. She didn't have my usual ingredients for pancakes, so I found this one. It's super easy and quick. My kids love these! I make small diver dollar size pancakes and the get gone fast.

The batter was extremely runny. I added probably another 3/4 flour, but it was still runny. The pancakes are very flat and not very tasty. I followed the measurements exactly!

The batter has the consistency of muffin batter. Also, the original recipe has 0 flavor. I added a little more sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and blueberries, and then they were edible.

Love this recipe! I usually use half or all wheat flour and sometimes add blueberries, pumpkin pie spice, purée squash or sweet potato, and applesauce. I make large batches and freeze for the week. The kids can't get enough!

Made this with whole wheat flour and it ws great!  I added extra milk b/c we like our pancakes thinner.  Glad to have an easy recipe to use as a base recipe that I can add different flavors to in the future.

Great recipe.  I used spelt flour instead and omitted the sugar and used it in the waffle press.

Great pancake recipe that includes everything you should already have in the house! I just use a little less milk since my family prefers slightly thicker pancakes.

This pancake recipe is amazing. I've even converted non-pancake eaters with it! I also often make it gluten free and substitute an equivalent amount of buckwheat flour and add a touch more baking powder to help it rise, and they still work fantastic! One of the best recipes I've ever found.

Very eggy. Now don't get me wrong, the end result was delicious, but it's not what I would call a pancake. If anything else, I'd say it's closer to french toast. Maybe try it with out the egg next time?

Excellent!  I used coconut oil and buttermilk (what I had in the house) and these pancakes were quick, easy, and delicious.  I did let the batter sit a few minutes while the griddle heated.  Next time I will try to minimize or eliminate the sugar, since I'm trying to cut it out of my diet, and it may not be necessary for a good result.  UPDATE:  I've made these several times now.  Definitely use buttermilk - they turn out light and fluffy.  They also freeze and reheat well.  I tried once with almond milk and they were flat and heavy.  You can easily cut back on the sugar (it makes the pancakes brown too quickly), and I substituted xylitol with success. No more mixes for me! This is THE go-to recipe.

Made this recipe a couple of times now and it always turns out great.  Very flavorful as the recipe is written, and I have also made some "special" ones too.  I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and that was super.  This morning I added some diced ham to the batter for "Hamcakes", one of my families favorites.  Anyway, the basic batter is foolproof, and can be made into many variations without worry.  This is definitely a keeper.

Works well, it is a really good basic pancake recipe. Made no changes but used a 1/2 cup mesure for scooping the batter because we like ours on the larger size. Made two batches and ended up with no leftovers with a family of four. :-)

These are the first pancakes I have ever made from scratch and they turned out beautifully! My hubby gobbled them up a little more than astonished! I'm going to add the Vanilla others have added next time I make them and I'm glad to hear they store well as I've been looking for a recipe I can make ahead of time for weekday breakfasts!

Excellent recipe!!! The pancakes turned out thin, dense and the center was cooked! With other recipes I have tried, the pancakes were too thick and the center always turned out raw for me. With this simple recipe the pancakes are evenly cooked through and taste delicious! My husband loved them and wants me to double the recipe next time! I am happy that I finally found a pancake recipe that works for me!

Great recipe for pancakes. I like to make them a little thicker than most people so I added a little more flour, and I also sometimes add vanilla to my pancakes. My kids and I loved this recipe - they cooked perfectly and tasted great.

I don't think my opinion of the pancakes are the fault of the recipe, just my tastebuds! I think I was looking more for a buttermilk recipe, so the taste just wasn't quite right. The pancakes did cook up nice and fluffy, but there was just something missing.

I think they were too dry and tasteless for us and I didn't deviate at all from the recipe.  Maybe I should have followed other reviewers advice and added vanilla and cinnamon and butter.  Oh, well, back to  the drawing board.

I honestly don't know what more you could ask for in a pancake. I tried the recipe as written and they are amazing. Since then I sometimes add fruit or a bit of vanilla but this recipe is wonderful as is.

This recipe is the best. I have tried many including one from an expensive subscription site that called for malted milk powder. This is simple and wonderful. Guess what? I used 1/2 cup all-purpose and 1/2 cup peanut flour  and added cinnamon and vanilla.  So yummy no syrup was needed.  Peanut flour has 16 g. of protein  in 1/4 cup, fiber, no cholesterol, 110 calories.  Thank you CYNDILB for my new fluffy favorite.   Chuck's Angel

Delicious pancakes.  Doubled the recipe, took others' advice and only used one egg.  Seemed fine.  I started out using about 1-1/2 c milk but added more milk so probably used what the recipe called for in the end.  The pancakes were not thin but they weren't super thick... just right.  I took the advice of a reviewer who suggested letting batter set in fridge for a few minutes (from an article on making a better pancake from this site).  The pancakes were deliciously tender and fluffy. My DH ate all I gave him, and I gave him all but one LOL -- next time I may triple the batter.  I think my doubling the batter made about 7 6" approx. pancakes.  I use a soup ladle to put the batter in the pan and the size is good.  Great recipe, and thank you for sharing.

This is an excellent basic recipe.  You do not need to refrigerate it overnight--a few minutes to let it sit and allow the leavening to work is fine.  As another reviewer said, do not stir it down when you make the pancakes, just scoop the batter out and into the frying pan.  You can use the recipe as is or add your own touch--applesauce is good, especially if it is homemade.  Chocolate chips work well for kids.  And if you have leftover buttermilk, you can use that as well in place of the milk.  Bon appetit!

These pancakes tasted really great.  I made them exactly as the recipe states (doubled it) and they came out perfect and not too sweet like others I have tried in the past.  I used the high setting on my electric cooktop and nonstick pan...no spray.  I like high heat and fast flips!

'Not new at making pancakes.  No, not bad, but mine were flat & a little salty (just a little).  I used butter instead of oil; but other than that, no changes.  'Was outta buttermilk, so we had pancakes; but I'll stick to it next time.

Great recipe! I made this for my colleagues at work and they loved it! I need to add more flour and sugar, though. I add 1 teaspoon cinnamon and served it with apple jam, yum!

This is my family's FAV pancake recipe! I substitute coconut oil for the other oil and agave syrup for the sweetener :)
They're so yummy and fuffy.

i made this recipe as written.  while we were starving for our late breakfast and did actually eat some of these, the batter was very thin, and the first pancakes i made were flat and had a strange flavor..like plain flour, but with a metallic flavor?  my plan was to add blueberries, but my little one doesn't like them...so i made two plain for her first.  i was concerned that they were so flat, but tried the first two blueberry cakes, and the blueberries looked ridiculous sitting there in a very shallow puddle.  my oldest got those two and couldn't eat them...she said they tasted like they weren't done.  so i got them...they were cooked through, just tasted bad.  i had added more flour and sugar to the batter to get it to hold up the berries, and they turned out thicker and fluffier, but the strange taste was still there.  will not make again.

I thought this was a very good basic pancake recipe - the batter seemed very thin, however I always let the batter stand a few minutes before pouring onto the griddle and I think that helps.  The pancakes are not too thin, not too thick.  I always preheat my griddle on medium-high, then as I pour the first batch I reduce the heat slightly.  I've made this several times and best results came from using buttermilk (or adding a teaspoon of vinegar to the milk) and adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Orange extract works well, too!  This is a great base recipe that adapts well to additions of your favorite spices, fruits, nuts, chocolate chips....

I usually have to doctor this up, but it is quick. Haven't bought bisquick in months! Kids always want chocolatechips and I will add a teaspoon or so of vanilla.

This recipe is a really good for basic pancakes. If you want to make them even better add a teaspoon of vanilla. (I added 2) It make the pancake a lot more flavourful. Also I personally prefer cooking my pancakes in butter then oil. Just adds that savoury taste.

I made this to the exact recipe and they were ok.  Kids were used to Bisquick mix and did not like this recipe.  I was determined to try again so I read the reviews and decided to use buttermilk instead of milk and melted butter instead of oil and added some vanilla extract. I also added an extra teaspoon of sugar because the original really needed it..  Everyone loved them.  So, this is a good base to start out with but with the tweaking I did, it made the family happy and they said to never use Bisquick again.

I LOVE this recipe...I make it every Monday and today turned it into PUMPKIN Spice pancakes. It is perfect serving for my my kids and I. 

To make Pumpkin, I added 1/2CPumpkin Puree to mix and only added 3/4C Milk and 1TBs Coconut oil. Added some Pumpkin spice, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Mixed and added some Chocolate chips to a few Pancakes. SO SO GOOD!!

Excellent not too fluffy pancake! Wonderful thin pancake texture.  I did add some butter and maple flavoring, to perk up the taste a bit.

I made this recipe as written (with the exception that I used lactose-free milk) and it's five stars all the way! The pancakes are on the flatter side but they still taste tender and moist on the inside. They taste the way a pancake should taste. :-) This was very easy to put together and cooked up in no time. Will definitely make again!

These pancakes are great, especially considering they call for ingredients I typically have on hand. Makes it easy for those impulsive Saturday morning cravings. I added a little more sugar and also cinnamon and am excited to try some other flavorings. My husband has claimed me to be the Pancake Queen now after I served him these.

These were delicious!  I made the following changes, some due to other reviews:  I quadrupled the recipe (12 servings) but used only 2 eggs and 3 cups milk.  I also added a bit of vanilla extract and chocolate chips and refrigerated the batter for 10 minutes prior to the first batch, and in between batches thereafter.  Lastly, I didn't have any all-purpose flour left in the house, so I used 2 cups of bread flour and 2 cups of white whole wheat flour.  Came out delicious!  Big hit with the kids, who did NOT detect the whole wheat flour at all!

Overall, it's a pretty good pancake recipe, but I was a little disappointed with the texture.  They looked very fluffy in the pan but fell on the plate.  I added a splash of vanilla and chocolate chips.  Next time I would also substitute club soda for milk, as I have found this makes the fluffiest, lightest pancakes I've ever tasted.

This was a great recipe. Light and fluffy. Next time I will use only half of the recommended oil. To give it a different flavor, I added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice to the batter before I cooked the panackes. It was just enough that is made you go, "hmmm." And they were a hit with my dad and my daughter.

They were okay, better used as a flavor sponge with lots of syrup, but then again I'm used to making crepes rather than pancakes and it took me a few tries before getting them to look right.

Delish!  I read some other reviews and tips, maybe I did something wrong, but it was a tad too cinnamonny for me - I would still add it next time, but maybe a touch less.  Otherwise, it was a fantastic recipe - and I'm sure it's going to become a regular in our family now :)  Thanks!  Recommend :)

These pancakes are the best ones to turn out golden and fluffy. The ONLY thing I changed was brown sugar for the white sugar. Very yummy!

These turned out great, but didn't have much flavour. I added blueberries to the batter which was good.

Tastes good! I made this recipe as it states here, it was a little runny and made thinner pancakes than I generally prefer. My kids loved the flavor. I made a double batch, (added 1 tsp of vanilla) for my family of four, every one had a short stack and we have plenty left over to freeze for later in the week.

I always like to impress my siblings by making them the best pancakes. Growing up on Aunt Jemina, just add water, these were a pleasent suprise! All of my siblings eagerly agreed that they were greatand they never let my mom make them pancakes anymore. I enjoyed it, but I did add a bit of Vinilla extract for extra flavour. Usually I eat about 4 pancakes and am still hungry, but two of these hearty pancakes filled me up!

I was nervous about how this would be but the reviews seemed promising. I used bone-in quarter chicken legs instead and played around with the timing. I cooked for two hours on low and then three on high before turning it back to low. This was excellent. Chicken was falling off the bone tender and the sauce was full of flavor and very enjoyable. My very picky husband has requested a repeat. Very good!

I always use Krusteez pancake mix but ran out so I used this recipe exactly as is except doubled and added a few drops of water because the batter was really thick. The kids loved them and would definitely make them again. I may add a little vanilla next time that sounds good and maybe decrease oil.

Very simple recipes and very good! I made them yesterday for my kids and they asked for them again this morning. The recipe as is makes 6 small-medium pancakes. You may want to double or triple the batch to serve more.

This is a great recipe!  I had been using box mixes all this time and I now have something new and delicious to feed my family for breakfast.  They all raved about it! I followed the directions and chose to add the vanilla extract as it had been mentioned on many reviews and it was excellent! Thanks!

I found these pancakes to be a bit to eggy for me.  I doubled the recipe so I used two eggs. Maybe next time I will use only one for a double batch and also add some vanilla.  These weren't terrible but they weren't great :(  I'm still on the hunt for the perfect pancake recipe!

my boyfriend really liked these pancakes. he's really picky when it comes to pancakes too! I made the recipe as written. The batter is very simple.  The only thing i didn't like was how gingerly i had to be when flipping the pancakes, but its worth doing since my boyfriend enjoyed them.

Did not have any butter to use the recipe I normally use, so I searched and found this one.  It seem to lack something.  It lacked flavor, even though I added Vanilla.  Was what I needed to finish my entree, but lacking.  I will stick to my other recipe.

I've made this exactly as written many times and these are very tasty and well textured pancakes.  The perfect go-to recipe, thanks for sharing.  I've also used this dozens of times as a base recipe for blueberry, chocolate chip, and apple cinnamon pancakes for example.

My husband is saying that i cannot really rate these because i changed the recipe.  The changes i made were: used 50/50 wheat/white flour, added 1/2 tbsp more sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and about 1/4 c. of xtra flour.  But, i am rating these on the ratios of the ingredients.  There was no aftertaste of bkg soda or bkg powder, not too salty, or eggy.  The first two were not sweet enough and a little bland, so i added extra sugar.  They were not gummy at all, and came out quite fluffy and light even though i used 50/50 wheat/white flour.  I did let the batter sit for a few minutes as suggested in other reviews.  Overall, i think this is a very good base recipe and think the ratio of ingredients is great. i will be using this recipe as my base in the future from now on.

I love pancakes but for some reason never made them from scratch.  Wow...what a difference.  Not only were these incredibly simple knowing that I made them myself gave me the warm and fuzzy feeling inside :).  I added sliced bananas to one half of the batter and they were out of this world.  Will make these every chance I get.  Thanks for the recipe.

After making these, I will not eat the boxed pancake mix. Yuck. Even my nephew prefers this recipe over a boxed mix. They are also great with add-ins like chocolate chips, blueberries, and even pecans. Another great thing about this recipe is it's so easy to just throw together. Thanks for the recipe!

I struggle with the pancake "just add water" mix, only because it seems too gooey and the middle never cooks enough before they burn. This recipe is great! Great with a non-stick pan..no extra grease or fat added. Perfect pancakes! Make them about once a week!

I personally prefer flat pancakes and really liked how these came out. I also like how this recipe doesn't call for vanilla. I think that adding sugar and vanilla can take the opportunity away from the syrup give it that sweet kick. I have FINALLY found my ideal pancake recipe. THANK YOU!

My family loved this recipe! I doubled it and they ate most of them! Super filling! I did add 1tsp vanilla and 2tsp cinnamon and about 4tbsp sugar and 1 3/4 c milk for a double recipe! They came out perfect! So light and fluffy just excellent! Definitely recomend recipe  with the adjustments!

This was my first attempt making pancakes and i was sooo surprised that they actually came out awesome!!! i tweaked it a LITTLE, added about double the sugar but it was amazing!!! i think just a hint of vanilla or any other essence to cover up the slightly eggy smell would be nice but this recipe is definitely for keeps!! thanks a lot!

Perfect if they're mixed minimally, leaving lumps, to make a fluffy cake and not a tough one from overworked wheat gluten.  I like to let them rest for a bit until they rise a little.  You can add almost anything to them too.  Fail proof and classic.

I had never made pancakes before. This recipe is very easy and the pancakes are good. I chose this recipe because I wanted to use vegetable oil instead of butter. I put the batter in a squeeze bottle and made letters. My 3 year old daughter had a lot of fun eating them with nutella. Thanks for a good recipe.

Easy & delicious!  I added a tiny bit of vanilla to the wet ingredients just for my own personal taste, but a great recipe.  Thanks!  ETA:  I have used this recipe about a gazillion times since the first time due to the ease of quadrupling it for a gang of kids at my home daycare.  Great recipe!

I think the recipe makes the pancake batter too thin, so the pancakes turn out more like crapes.

This was a very good basic pancake recipe, and it was just the right amount for 2 people. I always used pancake mix from a box, but I still had to add the oil, egg amd milk. However, this will be much more economical. Thanks.

Just tried these and they are an ok basic recipe.  I just felt something was missing.  I doubled my recipe so I have some extra batter to tinker with tomorrow, maybe I will add some vanilla as others suggested.  The texture was good and the pancakes were very eye appealing but I personally wasn't blown away with the taste.

The taste was good and the recipe is simple.  A nice treat for weekend mornings.  However, I prefer pancakes that are a little thinner and these were rather thick. Maybe add a bit more milk if you like thinner pancakes.

I followed some of the advice of other reviewer's and added 1tsp vanilla and substituted butter for the oil. The taste of the pancakes were okay but the consistency was terrible. They were rubbery and came out very flat. I will try another recipe instead of this one next time.

These pancakes were tastey.  I did add an additional 1/2 tablespoon of sugar. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  In order to make these vegan, I used egg replacer and rice milk(1/2 cup original and 1/2 cup vanilla) instead of milk.  They turned out great.  My husband and son loved them(so did I)!

i made this recipe as is, and it was super easy and tasty to boot. next time i think i'll use brown sugar and a little vanilla, but for a quick sweet fix, this hit the spot in a jiffy.

This is a great tasting, easy-to-make recipe! I made it slightly different (1 Tbs.butter + 1 Tbs. oil) and I didn't use the baking soda (b/c I didn't have any) and they came out terrific. They fluffed up beautifully and tasted perfect. My son and fiance loved them.

Ok, I know everyone loves their pancakes differently, so I'm rating these based on my opinion of the perfect pancakes.

I LOVE the simple recipe and how I cooked them came out the way I like: a little flat and floppy. Maple syrup tastes the best with these and the batter stores well as other reviewers have said.

I think these pancakes are just perfect. I wouldn't choose any other recipe over this.

I made these exactly as the recipe called for, and they turned out perfect! I've tried other recipes on this site with buttermilk, and I have to say these were tastier. If you're looking to make a lot of pancakes, you'll definitely have to double or triple the recipe though. I only got about 6 medium sized pancakes from a single batch. I love that everything needed for this recipe I have right in my pantry. Thanks for sharing.

I made these pancakes yesterday morning and I thought they were the best pancakes I've ever had, they were very thick but I like them that way! Super easy to make, why use a mix? Did add Vanilla with wet ingred.

Great recipe! My husband enjoys making pancakes. He's made these twice and both times I've thought that they are the best he's ever made. We added a slosh of vanilla and ran out of baking powder. We probably only had half (or less) of what we were supposed to have and they still were great. This will be our family's pancake recipe from now on.

I followed the recipe exactly but the batter was too runny which in turn made the pancakes too thin.  I don't think I'll make these again.  They tasted ok but i like a thicker fluffier pancake.

These pancakes are just like my mum used to make when i was "little", and gosh that really is saying something.  I would highly recommend trying this recipe, you won't be disappointed... one little hint though, and this is true for any pancake recipe is to keep a little extra milk handy, if the mixture starts to thicken up while you are cooking, just add a little more milk and whisk through and you'll have light, fluffy and mouthwatering pancakes throughout the whole batch.  Enjoy!

I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup unbleached white flour and 1 cup plus 1-1/2 tablespoons of whole wheat flour. I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Because of my son's food allergies, I used rice milk and Ener-G Egg Replacer and the recipe still came out delicious.

These are the best, if I can get my picky six year old to eat them.  In fact, she asks for them every morning.  

I use just a little over 2/3 cup of milk for fluffier pancakes and I also "eyeball" the amount of cinnamon and vanilla that I add.  But my husband and daughter love them.  And so do I.

I have once tried the ready mix pancakes, turned out like sponges, terrible!
I've tried the banana pancake recipe, was ok!
but I gotta say, this is so far the best pancake i've ever tried.
thin and light just the way I like 'em :)
thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and my advice is to NOT alter this recipe! If you do the measurements and ingredients exactly as listed, you will have picture-perfect pancakes that rival any old box mix.

Now THIS is what your basic pancake is supposed to taste like. Tender-crisp, not too sweet, well balanced, and the batter consistency is perfect. Since I used all whole-wheat flour and no white flour, I increased the baking soda to 1 teaspoon, and added 1/4 teaspoon cider vinegar to the egg mixture, to boost the rising power. I also used 1/4 cup buttermilk powder, stirred into the dry ingredients, then used water instead of milk. Let the batter sit five minutes before cooking. Result... the first pancakes I ever made I wouldn't be ashamed to serve to guests. Fortunately, I don't have any guests tonight, so I gets 'em all!!! Made just the right amount to eat some and save some for breakfast.

This is a great basic recipe! I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made these (let sit in the refrigerator for 15-30mins for fluffier pancakes), and they turned out fluffy and delicious. The next few times I added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla, and those were great also.

No more boxed mixes for me! I did read the pancake guide on this site before making these, and they turn out great every time.
I put in 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 white flour.

These got great reviews, I made them for my mom for mother's day. I took some other reviewers advice and did half whole wheat flour as well as added 1 tsp vanilla extract and olive oil in place of vegetable. I also put in a banana and chopped walnuts.

I've made these pancakes many times, and they're really yummy (almost like McDonald's Hotcakes).  I add about 2-3 times more sugar so they're a little tastier and cook them in a small round pan on small flame to get the right amount of brown-ess on one side.

These were ok. I followed the recipe to a T. My 5 yr old who doesn't speak due to Autism(and she loves pancakes) let me know very clearly these weren't good cause she took one bite turned around and spit it backon the plate. I didn't thinkt hey were that terrible, but they were very, blah! Not much flavor. I can't believe these made the top 20.

This is an awesome recipe! I forgot to add the vanilla, but it turned out just fine without it. My daughter and I were hungry and couldn't stand waiting 30 minutes--and they turned out very flat, but I did notice as the time passed cooking them they started getting fluffier. It also helps slightly to cover them while cooking, as recommended by another reviewer. I also refrained from over stirring the mixture. It is a great recipe and I will definitely be keeping this one.

These pancakes were really good.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of oil and once I mixed the ingredients, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and let it sit in the fridge for about a half an hour to allow the gluten to settle down and the soda to start to work.  The end result were really tasty, fluffy, tender pancakes.

I like to mix whole wheat flour with white (when the recipe is doubled, use 1/2 c. whole wheat and 1 1/2 c. white). I also let the mixture sit in the fridge for 20 minutes, and cook with a little butter in the pan. I even sprinkled a few chocolate chips on the pancakes while they were cooking. My boyfriend said they are the best pancakes I've ever made :)

These pancakes were absolutely delicious! They came out extremely fluffy and thick. I doubled the recipe, but only used one egg and 1 1/2 cups of milk as suggested by previous reviewers. I realized afterward that I forgot vanilla, but they were excellent anyway. This will be my standard pancake recipe from now on!

These are great! I use this recipe as a base for all the pancakes I make. I usually add a little bit of cinnamon to the dough, because it tastes a bit bland without it. The last time I made these pancakes I added one rippled banana to the dough, and they were WONDERFUL. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I tripled the recipe since I had teenagers to feed which I don't think affected the outcome.  They were thin but a good basic recipe for pancakes.  Everyone said they were yummy.
Thanks, Michele, cambridge, ontario

I made the mistake of not adding all of the milk it called for but otherwise this pancake was awesome!  The vanilla and cinnimon really gave this pancake a good kick!

Excecllent recipe - super easy and really consistent.  I do sometimes add just a little more milk as we like thinner pancakes.  This is our "standard" now, thanks!

Very good recipe, made mine with half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat. Turned out pretty good. Would probably make again.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a little vanilla, and I did as an article on this sight suggested and let the batter sit in the refrigerator for about an hour, and these came out amazingly good! I had never made pancakes from scratch before, and this recipe is perfect for my small family as well. Also, I made them a second time with whole wheat flour and they still came out perfect!

Basic, but good.  Next time, I may add vanilla as other reviewers have recommended.  The ingredients in this recipe blend well.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with the perfect consistency.  I served it with some store bought hash browns mixed with onion, 1/2 lb ground sausage, paprika, salt, and pepper.  A great breakfast!

The basics are good, but next time I'll use less oil, sugar and milk.  (This recipe is fine if you eat them without syrup, but add syrup, and it's too sweet!)

wonderful pancakes! Light and fluffy - must be the baking soda.I usually use a "just add water" mix - but these are much better. I won't use a mix again.

Had saved his recipe in my recipe box for awhile and finally made it today. Both my husband and I were impressed!  They turned out great! I didn't over mix the batter so they were not too runny.  Also added some vanilla as other reviewers suggested.

Excellent! I followed the advice of the other users and doubled the recipe except for the egg (used 1 egg) and the pancakes were great... tasty and simple next time I may add a tad more salt. Thanks for this simple and good recipe.

These pancakes were okay. Not fluffy enough and did have an egg taste. Next time, I think I'll double the recipe and only add one egg...like someone else suggested.

This recipe was fantastic!  I'm sure that it's just fine the way it is, but after reading that several others modified it slightly, I couldn't help myself...

1. First of all, I doubled the recipe (to make 6 servings).
2. Substituted unbleached plain flour for the white plain flour, and turbinado for the white sugar.
3. Separated the eggs, added the egg yolks to the milk mixture, and whipped up the whites with a little white sugar for about 5-7 mins.
4. Added 1/2 cup of Irish Cream to the milk mixture (the batter wasn't thin enough), and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture.
5. After combining milk mixture and flour mixture, I folded in the whipped egg whites.

These pancakes cooked up light and fluffy (be sure not to overstir the batter or it will make dense, rubbery pancakes).  When I plated the pancakes, instead of syrup, I brushed them with Irish cream, and layered with sliced strawberries and prepared whipped cream that I had in the fridge .  Absolutely decadent breakfast (EXCELLENT for the in-laws)!

Excellent pancakes!  I made these today for "Pancake Tuesday", (aka Shrove or Fat Tuesday), and served them to my children for a true Mardi Gras celebration...they were wonderful!  Better than any store bought mix, or buttermilk baking mix!  I added a little vanilla extract and a tsp. or so of cinnamon, but otherwise kept the recipe as written. Delicious!

I used 50/50 whole wheat/white flour and sucanat. I also used less milk because 2 cups made the pancakes too thin for my family. My 2 hungry boys and hubby loved them. Thanks Cyndi for helping me get my family off Bisquick!

Four stars as written.  Five stars after we added 1/3 cup additional flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Don't whisk the ingredients together too much because the batter can become thin.  But when we made these (with the additions), we ended up with lovely fluffy cakes that gave off a nice cinnamon flavor while heating.  Will keep this one in my collection!  Thanks!

We loved these pancakes! I tripled the recipe for our crew and added a bit more flour, just to thicken and let set a few minutes before making. They turned out thick and fluffy. I also added chocolate chips to half the batter and they turned out great too. A definite keeper...Thanks for posting!

The batter was too watery so I had to add more flour. Once that was fixed my husband said they tasted fantastic.

Good taste, although mine, too, were flat and rubbery.  If you like a thick, spongy pancake (like me) this is not the recipe for you.

I used whole wheat flour instead of regular, and Splenda instead of sugar and these pancakes still turned out great.  It is a new favorite.

This is a great classic pancake recipe. The prep time was less than 10 minutes, and they turned out delicious and fluffy. Everyone in the family gave compliments.

I love it.  It is super easy and tastes like a bisquik mix would.

Sorry to give this such a low review but my husband really did not like these.  He said that maybe these were good for people who have never had a real pancake, and says he's used to the wonderful fluffy pancakes I usually make, and that these were so rubbery he would only give them two stars (I always ask him how many stars when I try a new recipe from here.)  I thought they were okay - but rather flat.  Sorry but these "pancakes" just didn't cut it for our family.

Good, solid recipe... I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I may add a little more sugar next time but, as is, these pancakes were quickly eaten.

I actually followed this recipe to the letter since I've never made pancakes from scratch.  It was quick and easy and the kids loved them.  I'm not a big breakfast eater, but did taste a bite and they were good!  ****

I made these pancakes with chocolate chips for my boyfriend's birthday breakfast and he loved them! I had them without the chocolate and I thought they had a really delicious vanilla taste. Much better than boxed mix!
