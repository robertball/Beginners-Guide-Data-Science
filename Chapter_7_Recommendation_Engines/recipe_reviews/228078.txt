sounds good but I hate to be the party pooper. About half the recipe is major Paleo No-Nos

I can't BEGIN to tell you how good this recipe was!  I made a lobster tail stuffed with this crab mixture.  The flavors positively burst in your mouth.  The red bell pepper provided just a little kick (along with the Tabasco sauce).  If you're doing paleo, Whole30, or Fast Metabolism Diet, you HAVE to try this!

Loved this recipe!  Like some of the other reviews, I found that my cakes were falling apart a bit (which is totally OK because it means they're not full of starchy filler)...  so instead of putting them on a baking sheet, I placed them in the cups of a muffin tin and baked them that way.  Came out perfect!

Made this with a 12 oz can of white albacore tune.  Very easy and very good!  I liked the fact that I didn't have to slave over a hot, greasy skillet to brown these bad boys.  Some changes I made:  I didn't have Old Bay, so I used smoked paprika, celery seeds, black pepper, sea salt and garlic powder instead.  Also used about double the vegetables because I like 'em with lots of veggies. To save time, I chilled the mixture in the freezer for about 15-20 mins.  Worked fine.  And, because I like crispy, crusty cakes, I used about 2/3rds cup (or slightly more) almond flour for coating, well seasoned with my "Old Bay" replacement (smoked paprika, celery seeds, garlic powder, black pepper and sea salt.)  Baked at 400 degrees for just over 20 mins and flipped them about half way through -- flipping was a little difficult because I didn't think to oil the foil.  Made 9 cakes, just enough for three people -- I will double recipe next time so I have leftovers.  Served with homemade coleslaw and a homemade spicy sauce for the cakes.  Will definitely make again. ;-)

Excellent. I served over a be of mixed baby greens and topped with Paleo Chipotle Dipping Sauce (I toned this sauce down a bit by substituting diced green chilies for the adobo chipotles so as not to drown out the crab cakes' subtle flavors). This one is going on "high rotation" at our house!

Easy to assemble, really tasty. Be sure to chill well so they're easier to work with.

Great crab cakes. Easy to make hours before cooking. Added an extra egg for better adhesion. Served on arugula with chipotle aioli.

Great recipe! Lump crabmeat was $18.99/half pound at my local market, so I ended up using crab claw meat instead (only $6.99 per half pound), which tasted just as good. Once I formed them into patties, they kept falling apart, so I sprinkled almond flour on each side instead of dredging them. I read the reviews where people flipped their cakes to brown both sides, so I intended to flip them as well. At 20 minutes, I couldn't flip them without them falling apart. Instead I brushed each crabcake with a little melted butter, repositioned my oven rack, and broiled them for 5 minutes to brown the tops. The result was fantastic! Topped with paleo-style remoulade to serve.

The smell of the crab cakes were superb as was the taste! It was like restaurant quality!! They did fall apart a little and therefore my husband used a ramkin to form them. He sprinkled almond flour on them. We made 4 of them, 2 fried in oil and the other 2 baked while we were eating the fried ones. Saving the baked ones for lunch tomorrow.

I added more red pepper and used chipotle mayo in place of mayo. The added flavor was needed.

These are amazing. Blow even restaurant crab cakes out of the water.  We have made these several times, and stick right to the recipe :)

My new favourite crab cake recipe, the flavours are delicious.  I found mine did not crisp up enough for me in the oven, so I did a quick pan fry before serving.  Will definitely make these again.

I made it, and for all those complaining that the ingredients were not paleo, make your own mayo and Worcestershire sauce from scratch, then you have no problem. I just added another egg to help with the binding.

Sounds good. I couldn't make it though because I have an autoimmune digestive disease and am on a restricted diet (Paleo and SCD). Worcestershire sauce is neither Paleo nor SCD compliant. I too use Primal Kitchen's avocado oil mayonnaise.

Used panko bread crumbs to bread the patties and used a whole red pepper with the scallion.

Excellent!  Made with tuna.  Used jalepeno instead of red pepper.  Hot sauce wasn't enough heat, so added cayenne pepper.  Added paprika and cumin to taste.  Put some almond flour on wax paper and put patty on that, then sprinkled more on top, carefully removed from wax paper and put on baking sheet.  Baked 15 min per side.  Very good with Jamaican slaw recipe off this site.

These were really yummy!! I did have a little problem getting them to brown up. I had them in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes, but the almond flour was still pale. I wound up getting impatient & just throwing them in a pan and browning them that way......I noticed even after I got them nice & brown, they still weren't really crispy. That might be the nature of almond flour? I don't have much experience cooking with it. 
Also the flour seemed to stay dry. I put some olive oil in the pan and that helped. Maybe next time if I try putting them in the oven again I'll try spritzing the tops with olive oil. 
I loved the flavor of the crab....very yummy.  However, I did use quite a bit more spices, lemon juice & worchestershire than called for.  I also used a bit more mayo than called for...hoping that would help them hold together better.  I didn't have any problems with them falling apart. 
Also, I made a little sauce with butter, shallots, garlic, wine & some thyme. 
This is a definite make again.

Paleo or not, this is fantastic!! Actually made them with half crab and half shrimp to cut down on cost, but we're still very crabby and delicious!! Can't wait to make again. And th sauce is perfect!

I don't like sea food but I loved these! 
So tasty! I had to flip them half way through the baking process and they were a bit crumbly but still tasty!

The flavors of this recipe were great. I think I must have had more than a pound of crab because they would not form into cakes at all. No problem. I decided to add a little more onion and red bell pepper. I also added cilantro since I had no parsley. I put it all in a casserole dish and put cheddar cheese on top and baked it at 350 for 40 minutes. Delicious. A couple of days later I used some of the left-overs in an omelette. Very tasty. I will try the cakes in the future with the right amount of crab.

I love this recipe! I used coconut flour instead of the almond (it's what I had on hand). I used yellow onion (I like more onion flavor) and they turned out perfect. Made I didn't take the picture, I was to excited to eat. :) will make this again!

This is really good! I even used tuna instead and added jalepenos. I was afraid they were too "wet" but that really helped keep them moist. I ended up flipping them and cooked them a total of 30 minutes so they'd brown.
