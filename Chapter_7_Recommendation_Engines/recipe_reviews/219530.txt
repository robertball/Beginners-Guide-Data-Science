I was looking for something different to try and came across this recipe.  I followed the ingredients to a 'T' and also added a bit more spices. I wasn't a bad dish. The tuna fish is just unexpected. And while i wont be making this dish again, I will recommend it to tuna lovers.

This dish was super-easy to make. Think homemade biscuits would be good with it! The taste just didn't do if for me, though. If I make it again, I'll use chicken instead of the tuna.

I used a fresh grilled tuna steak and homemade pasta for this and it was much better. I understand that this is a "budget" dish, for lack of a better word. But it made all the difference in the world with the fresh ingredients. This is one of those recipes that gives you a starting point to experiment with and hot rod to you own tastes.

We liked this very much.  I used a good quality jarred tuna in olive oil.  I think it makes a difference.  Honestly, I didn't think the combination of celery, peas, tuna and picante sauce would work, but they did. I did saute the celery in a little bit of olive oil first til tender, then added the peas and tuna and picante sauce.  Tossed with the pasta and served with the parmesan on top.
