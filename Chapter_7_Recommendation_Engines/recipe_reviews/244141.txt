My mom has finally slowed down to where she's sitting in the living room waiting for dinner rather than hovering around the stove. (she's 90)

Since she does volunteer work on Monday, I thought it would be nice to do something with the chicken she bought, so I used this recipe reduced down by 3/4s. 

I also threw in a little leftover potato, which sort of simmers down to add to the sauce.

It was quick, it was easy, and it was delicious! I gave mom all the carrots, because I hate cooked carrots.

We used turkey sausage instead of bacon, and left out the flour,  but it was quick and easy and tasted very good.
