This is such a great warm dish to serve up on a cold day.  My whole family loved it! Here's how I did it: I browned the meat and then put it in a crockpot.  I added the veggies and put in 2 cans of beef broth instead of using beef boullion and water.  I also added a packet of McCormicks slow cooker beef stew seasoning to it for extra flavor.  I added the tomato sauce and also added a can of diced tomatoes (juice drained).  I didn't add the potatoes and cabbage until about 4 hours till serving time as we like those 2 with a bit of a "crunch" and not mushy/soggy.  I cooked it on low in the crockpot for about 8 hours. The meat was very tender and very flavorable!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will be making this again!

I made this last night for myself and my husband.  It was very easy.  Make sure to cut the potatoes into fairly small pieces, otherwise it takes longer to get them tender than is stated in the recipe.  Tasty.  Wish it had a little more flavor.  I may just try to use concentrated beef broth next time instead of the bouillon.  Will make again.  Does get a bit mushy.  Maybe that's because I had to cook it a pretty long time to get the potatoes tender.  Oh well.

this is like my grandma's recipe we like to call hunky soup (Hungarian) instead she uses hunts traditional spaghetti sauce and a little garlic salt just a dash and a dash of onion powder and no bay leaf trust me it is pretty much all you need for flavor even adds cauliflower and broccoli. she browns the meant then throws it all in a crock pot on high till done. me being a first time house maker it wowed my fiance. Oh and this recipe needs more water just fill up the 16.5 cans use 2 cans if using a big crock pot. oh and egg noodles is a must for this!!!

Yummy!!  Served this last night to my husband and 2 kiddos (7&8) and what little was left, I ate for breakfast!  In the past I haven't had much luck with beef stews because the meat always turned out so tough.  This stew was the only one that I've made where the beef was tender.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I was pleasantly surprised with this dish! The 4 cups of cabbage seem overwhelming when raw but it cooks down rather nicely! This is a very hearty dish... great for a cold day!
I followed this recipe exactly except I used beef broth instead of the water and Bouillon cubes. I also added a can of diced tomatoes. I did find that this recipe could use a little more favor. Next time I will try less broth and more tomato sauce. Crescent rolls are a nice touch!

It was very good.  I will make this again however, I did add a bit of chopped garlic and hot sauce to add a bit more flavor. Meat was very tender~

We ate every bit of it! Just me and my two kids!

I really liked this.  My mom made this reipce at least once when I was in high school, and I liked it then.  I had half of a small cabbage to use up, and some stew meat in the freezer, so this was perfect.  I used one can of breef broth in place of the water/boullion, and threw everything into the crockpot all day after browning the meat.  The cabbage cooked down nicely and the stew got thick.  I did thicken a bit more with some flour/water, but it doesn't really need it.  I did not need to add any salt to this recipe.

I thought this was pretty good, but the rest of the family didn't care for it.  I cooked it 25 LESS than the recipe called for and mine was all mushy, but then again, i diced my potatoes smaller per other reviewers suggestion.

This was super easy and super yummy. I changed the bouillon and water to beef broth and added a larger can of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes to make it a soup. My entire family loved and requested it again. You can even add other veggies if you like.

This was great.  I added extra salt and pepper for flavor and ended up adding an extra 2 cups of water and one more bouillon cube.  I followed other people's instructions and cut the potatoes very small and they cooked in the right amount of time without turning the cabbage to mush.  This is so good! Not too bad for weight watchers either.

This was delicious! I altered the recipe slightly to what I had in the cupboard: I used 1 veg and 1 chicken cube instead of the beef bouillon, I substituted a leek for the onion, and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of sauce. I also chopped up some hot peppers & added while the soup simmered, and used my slow cooker on high for 4 hours. Will definitely make again.

I really liked this recipe and am happy to find something new to do with cabbage.  The long cooking time really made the beef super tender and the taste was really good.  I did have to make some changes, I had to add more water because even covered mine boiled dry also I didn't have have tomato sauce so I used canned spaghetti sauce and that worked just fine.  Served with dinner rolls and you have a complete meal.

This was an excellent stew.  I made this in my crockpot instead of using my dutch oven--less mess.  I used 12 oz of my own tomato sauce which is seasoned with basil, sage, and thyme.  My kids HATE carrots so I shredded the carrots and they didn't notice they were in there.   This was one of the best stews I have ever made.  I served it with sour cream.    Everyone really enjoyed this stew.  I will definately make it again.  It went great with beer bread.

Very good! Even my teenager who hates cooked cabbage ate a big bowl. For those that want more flavor, try using some V8 juice in place of the tomato sauce. :)

I tried this because I was looking for a way to use up some cabbage I had sitting around.  I've made it several times since then.  It gets even more tasty the next day.

This recipe is super easy and really, really good.  I added a second can of tomato sauce, and doubled the boullion/water just to have a little more liquid to dunk bread in.  Great recipe!

This was a good, hearty recipe.  I loved the addition of the cabbage.  I used beef broth instead of the bouillon cubes and water, however.

Yum! Comfort food! So delicious and hearty! I made it with 2 carrots and 2 regular potatoes and 1 small potato.
