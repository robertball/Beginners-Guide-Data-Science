This was a disappointing recipe. The dough was very crumbly; I had to press it together with my hands before I could form it into spiders. Of course, this made the actual shaping of the cookies very difficult! I ended up only making four because it was so hard, and putting the leftover dough (or should I say crumbles?) into the fridge for my family to eat. The spiders themselves, once baked, were pretty cute, but they were very hard and brittle. Several legs broke off in the process of moving the spiders, even though I let them cool as the recipe suggested. A few of the legs burned before the rest of the cookie was baked, as well. My siblings said they tasted okay, but not great. Sorry, but I will not be making these again!

The heads and legs of these spiders fell off after baking.  The cookies were tasty.

Actually making the spider shape and having it not look like a magnified virus is slightly difficult. However the mixture of chocolate and cinnamon hearts is wonderful, the cookies stayed soft and I was able to make wonderful letters out of the dough.

I forgot to leave a review when I made this three years ago, but this recipe was so awful that it still haunts me to this day. I figure if I reviewed it, the nightmares would cease.They were rocks masquerading as edible material.

WOW!!! These cookies are OFF THE CHARTS! I took these little spooky things to cousin Mary's annual Halloween party, and WOW!  My cookies sure did make all my maiden aunts and sister in laws jealous! And they just scared the pants off all the kids! Would highly recommend.
