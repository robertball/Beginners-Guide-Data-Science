Same recipe as "baked corn" from this site but it takes into account the different size box of corn muffin mix.  We love it and have received sooo many requests for the recipe- we ALWAYS use 1/2 the butter and lite sour cream.  When you double the recipe cook for about 50-60 minutes.  DO NOT use a foil pan.  it will take so long to cook.

This is such a delicious and easy recipe to prepare! I followed some suggestions of others and only used 1/2 cup margarine and light sour cream. I found that keeping it in the oven for at least 45-50 minutes worked out well, with the top just beginning to brown. I will definitely be making this again soon.

My husband loves corn no matter how it's prepared. I've made this a number of times but always add 2 Tbsp. of sugar, light sour cream and only one egg.  After it's baked you can sprinkled it with a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and bake for a few more minutes until the cheese is melted.

Very good recipe.  My famil loved it, they ate it all...there were no leftovers.  Even my 3-yr old son ate it, he calls it corn cake.  I added shredded cheese & green onions to give it a little added flavor. Will use again.

A real crowd pleaser! I also reduced butter in half, and used 8x8 pan. If folks wonder about its consistency, it's just like a moist turkey stuffing.
Was a great sidedish with baked ham, green beans/bacon/onions.

While this was very popular at Thanksgiving this year, I was disappointed. It came out like corn bread. With so many "wet" ingredients I expected more of a casserole rather than a bread. No complaints from my guests...some actually asked to take the leftovers home.

I'd never had baked corn or spoonbread before, and wanted something to serve with chili(Best Bean Chili--this site--wonderful!).  This was a perfect choice--like corn bread, only much more moist. (I used only half the suggested amount of butter.) And the whole kernel corn was a nice, sweet surprise.  Crumble some on top of a bowl of hot chili!

I served this dish at a catered two person birthday party.  I also serves shrimp kabobs and fondue and had poached pears with gorganzola for dessert.  This dish is what they raved about.  This recipe moved from temp to perm!

If you are looking for kid friendly corn casserole, this is it---it has a very delicate taste. Many  corn casseroles include onions, peppers and cheese(which can be very good) but this recipe is subtle.I served it to 27 guests this very Thanksgiving day and it got "the best reviews". Can not get much easier or better than this!

Loved this dish.  It had the perfect combination of sweet and savory.  I used fresh sweet corn off the cob instead of a can of corn drained.  I just cooked it for about 10 minutes.  Next time will use light sour cream and less butter.  It was a little too fatty for my taste.  Since I will be using less liquid I might bake in a smaller dish to keep it moist.

Loved this dish.  It had the perfect combination of sweet and savory.  I used fresh sweet corn off the cob instead of a can of corn drained.  I just cooked it for about 10 minutes.  Next time will use light sour cream and less butter.  It was a little too fatty for my taste.  Since I will be using less liquid I might bake in a smaller dish to keep it moist.

Made a huge dinner tonight, and this was one of the side dishes.  Every single person just raved about this dish.  I had to pass along the recipe before the night was through.  Absolutely the most moist and scrumptious baked corn we have ever had.  Will most definitely make it again!!!

The only change I made was using 1/2 cup of butter. Turned out really good, a bit too moist, not sure why, but the flavor is great!

Hard to rate this one-- It was good the first day, because I'd been looking forward to it after all the great reviews. But when I thought about eating it the next day, I just felt kind of ill-- it's so heavy, and the egginess of it makes me vastly prefer a moist cornbread. Maybe because I used nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream?

Had never added sour cream to mine before but was pleasently surprised at how much richer it made this.  I love this as a dessert or along side enchiladas.  Have and will continue to make again and again.

I have been making this recipe for several years and it is always a winner! I do add 1/4 cup sugar to my recipe, however, just to make it a little sweeter.  It is very moist and delicious.

Much too much butter in this recipe. Our fingers were full of grease. Maybe I'll try again with less butter because the taste was good otherwise.

I have made this numerous times. Since I live alone and it makes a lot, I reheat servings in the microwave, top with butter and warm syrup and eat it for breakfast, in addition to eating it as a side.

Try replacing the sour cream with yogurt! This recipe is fabulous just as it is, but the second time I made it I used a 6 oz container of Chobani's Greek Vanilla Yogurt (zero fat/120 cals) in place of the 8 oz of sour cream, and no one in my family noticed the healthy change! I also cut the melted butter in half. It looks just like golden brown corn bread on the outside, but inside it's like a moist cake with sweet corn throughout! AWESOME!

Try replacing the sour cream with yogurt! This recipe is fabulous just as it is, but the second time I made it I used a 6 oz container of Chobani's Greek Vanilla Yogurt (zero fat/120 cals) in place of the 8 oz of sour cream, and no one in my family noticed the healthy change! I also cut the melted butter in half. It looks just like golden brown corn bread on the outside, but inside it's like a moist cake with sweet corn throughout! AWESOME!

This is outstanding!! I made it this evening for dinner and my husband absolutely loved it. I cut the butter a bit and add diced green chilis, and it was delicious. This will be a regular dish from now on.

I made this on 4th of July with smoked turkey and all 25 people loved it!  The only thing I did different was to add 1 cup of cheddar cheese to the mix and 1 cup of cheddar cheese to the top!  Great taste....thanks to other reviews the cheese was a great addition!  5 stars

I make this for Thanksgiving and it's always a hit! I opt to use fresh frozen corn instead of canned, it seems to add more sweetness. I've also topped it with a little shredded cheddar and let that bake until brown.  Awesome!

This is awesome, I used Jiffy corn bread mix because it is slightly sweet, and 1 stick of butter works fine. I usually don't like corn mixed in with stuff (call me weird) but this was great, I'll be making this all the time now it's so simple. I baked it in a round deep casserole dish and it baked up beautiful.

I had watched a food program on tv that talked about spoonbread being served in a restaurant in Harlem and wanted to try it.  Did a search on this site and found this recipe.  Didn't know what to expect but it was very good.  I also used 1/2 cup of butter as recommended by some.  The only disappointment was that I expected it to be sweeter.  The next time, I will try a sweeter cornbread mix.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

We thought this was very good but I wish I would have listened to the others and put in half of a cup of melted butter instead of a cup.  Next time I make it I will be sure to do that.

A quick and easy recipe but if you prefer a sweeter type cornbread, definitely add a little sugar to the mix.

I love making this recipe and it goes well with any meal.  I add a couple tablespoons of sugar to the mixture and it is identical to the corn cake served at Chi-Chi's Restaurant.  Half way through cooking I stir it around I bit so that I can serve it more like the corn cake rather than a slice of cornbread.  Excellent recipe.

I hosted Thanksgiving 2000 and found this recipe to try something new.  Everyone loved it and have made it several times since.  A great change of pace.  Try adding a chopped onion to the butter for a little added flavor.

Loved this corn.  Also only used 1/2 of the butter it calls for, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.

I was responsible for a small group breakfast at a Fall  overnight ( lake cottage) camping.  I doubled the batch and used a large flat cake pan. Served squares of this with maple syrup. I served pan sausage doctored up with extra sage and coarse ground black pepper.  It was a big hit!!

Holiday favorite!  I've been making this recipe several years!  The family always loves it.
I usually bake it between 45-60 minutes though.

This is always the first side dish to go at parties!  My husband found this recipe one Valentine's Day, and cooked it for me since I love corn.  It is so good exactly as printed, but be sure to have ingredients on hand for a second batch!

My mother said this was a keeper and everyone agreed - I made it exactly as written (except I baked it in an 8x8 baking dish) and wouldn't change a thing. Nice texture, and not too sweet, I served it with Southwestern-stuffed chicken and a Mexican salad.

When the ingredients said to mix it all together, I thought, how will it look like the picture then, but it did!!  This is a great recipe, it looks and tastes wonderful!!  No more plain old cornbread for us!!

When the ingredients said to mix it all together, I thought, how will it look like the picture then, but it did!!  This is a great recipe, it looks and tastes wonderful!!  No more plain old cornbread for us!!

I followed the recommendation of others and reduced the amount of butter to 1/2 cup.  I thought the recipe was okay however my son who is a picky eater loved it!

Great recipe! Very moist but not runny. I served it with beef tenderloin and my husband and guests loved it! Will be making again. Added about a cup of shredded cheddar and a can of green chili's for some extra flavor.

THe first time I made this was on Thanksgiving and it has since become one of our mainstays. We literally loved it so much, we have had virtually every single week since then. It's that good.

This recipe has been a hit for my entire family!  I've served it on Thanksgiving and have had numerous requests for the recipe.  I make it exactly as the recipe says and it turns out great.  Of course, it's a bit fattening, but on the holidays, who cares!

This recipe is very easy to make.   My family loves it.   I have also made this with the light sour cream and my family didn't notice the difference.  I did have to cook it a little bit longer when I used the light sour cream though.   It's delicious both ways.   This recipe is one that I do over and over again.

I've made this twice, once with a cup of butter and once with a 1/2 cup.  I prefer the 1/2 cup, but it turns out more like a plain old cornbread with corn in it.  With a whole cup it just reeks of butter to me.  Overall I thought it was decent, and a large gathering of family at Thanksgiving most all seemed to give it positive reviews.  So if you like it keep it, but don't expect everyone to go for it.

This is more of a corn bread recipe rather than a corn bake. Use it if you want a switch on regular corn bread.

I had decided at the last minute to find a recipe that resembled "Mexican corn pudding" served at one of our favorite restaurants and thought this sounded close enough (not corn bread to be eaten with fingers). My adjustments were to reduce butter to 1/4 cup, add 1/4 cup white sugar, and reduce the sour cream to 1/3 cup (because that's all I had on hand!) I baked in a 8x8 pan for 45 min and it turned out just like I expected. Great side dish!

This just wasn't what I expected.  I prepared it for Easter dinner at my parents' house and was disappointed with the taste and texture.  Maybe it tastes best fresh from the oven.  I baked it at my house and then took it to my parents' and reheated the entire thing in the microwave (at 50% power for 5 minutes...too long?).  Everyone said it was good, but no one took home any leftovers!  I won't be making this again.

This was a hit at my family Christmas dinner. A thumbs-up to a new alternative to dressing or the usual sides that go with a Christmas ham.

My mom who is the official "chef" of our family commented that this baked corn was even better than her own recipe.  And that is quite a compliment!  Everyone loved this delicious recipe!

Very good!  Nice as a dessert or a side dish.  It was wonderful with our Thanksgiving dinner.
