This is a good recipe. I didn't have noodles or green onions so I used elbow macaroni and a medium chopped onion instead. I sauteed the pepper and onion in 1T of vegetable oil for a few minutes. Then I added the ground beef and a packet of Taco seasoning mix. I used an entire jar of salsa, a heaping half cup of reduced fat sour cream and I didn't measure the shredded cheese. I just added as much as I liked on the top of the dish. I used a mexican blend of shredded cheese. This made more than four servings as I believe the macaroni made more than the noodles would have. Plus I used a large pepper. This was very tasty. Everyone liked it. I will definitely make this again and again.

This was extremely good! I did make a lot of changes to suit my taste. I added 1 very large clove of garlic (minced), to the ground beef, when I browned it. I used 90% lean meat. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 Tbls. chili powder and 1/2 tsp. ground cumin. I also added 1 small can of mild chopped green chilies. I didn't drain the meat after browning and I omitted the water. I served it over egg noodles with sour cream and shredded muenster cheese. If you love beef stroganoff and if you love chili...you'll love this dish, because it tastes like chili stroganoff!

Was a little bland for me.  I like the idea of adding a package of taco seasoning mix.

This recipe was not as great as I thought it was going to be.1st of all,it was alot more work than it looked.Chopping the onion,gr.pepper,boiling the noodles,browning the meat,wow...that's alot of time for a weekday supper,which is when I made this. The noodles/mexican combo didn't really work for me either. Nobody in my family was raving over it. I have leftovers in my fridge as I write this.Sorry,just too much work for a so/so meal.

My husband and I thought this a bit bland. I doubled the sour cream and added 1/2 cup more salsa with cilantro, as well as chili powder. I also tossed in a can of drained niblet corn and mixed in the cheese. I added the green peppers and onions right after cooking the meat as they needed longer to cook as well as for the flavors to be absorbed. Definately a quick and easy recipe. Will make again on a busy day!

Yummy! Changed it up slightly. First saut√©ed fresh yellow onion and garlic. Added the beef and cooked it with paprika and red pepper flakes. Next threw in the bell pepper and green onion. Added the salsa and instead of water used beef broth. As I only had macaroni on hand that is what I used.  Very tasty and quick. Thank you!

This was awesome!! When I served it to my husband, he took a couple of bites and said, "This would be better with crunched up Doritos on top!" We tried and both agreed. Thanks for the recipe...it will stay in our recipe rotation!

Really great recipe.  I followed the recs on more salsa and the taco seasoning.  I also added a lot of corn.  I think this dish would be great with chicken or as a vegetarian dish as well.

I made it as written. Did not have much flavor so I added extra salsa. It really does need a pack of taco seasonings. I will try it again, but this time add extra cheese and taco mix.

Pretty good comfort food. I used hot, chunky salsa and 1 cup of cheese. Half a cup of cheese is not enough ;)

Great recipe!  I made a few changes; I added taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I also doubled the sour cream and added an extra 1/2 cup of salsa.  I added the veggies as soon as the ground beef was done.  I also added a tin of 6-Bean medley and about 1/4 cup dried black currants. and I used rice instead of noodles!

This was a great change of paste from the everyday things we're used to having. It will definatly become one of our favorite regulars. Even my youngest (who won't eat anything new) came back for seconds. It was also a very easy meal to prepare. Great for those "busy" days.

Totally bland.  This needs loads of fresh garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt etc. to even be palatable.

Excellent, I didnt have bell peppers so I used yellow onions and green onions, also, I used fresh salsa which added a spicy kick to the meal. Lastly, add cheese sauce to ground beef. Very good. Enjoy!

The taco seanoning was a great idea and definitely need to sean the meat while browning.  This was an excellent dish!

Quick, easy, inexpensive, and very customizable! I made a couple of changes due to ingredients I had on hand. First I had half a packet of taco seasoning that needed using up, so I added that to the meat. I omitted the bell pepper as we don't really like it. Because I made it ahead of dinner time and it dried up a little, I added half a cup or so of picante sauce. I served it over wheat rotelle, and sprinkled some fresh cilantro on top along with the grated cheese and diced grape tomatoes. This isnt a fancy dish obviously, but it's great for when you don't have a lot of time in the kitchen. Thanks, Kris!

My family really enjoyed this dinner. I used mini penne because that's what I had opened in the pantry. I left the chopped tomato out and just added more salsa on top!

This was a huge disappointment.  First off, I should have seasoned the meat the same way I would make tacos along with a pinch of cinnamon.   I used a local NM salsa here called Sadies Hot Salsa.  It has a kick!!  I used a half cup too and added more on my plate after tasting how bland this recipe is.  I would try this recipe again but with LOTS of changes.   However, my kids liked it and they are 4 and 7 years old and I separated their meat from the meat with the salsa.  They like anything usually with pasta!

This recipe was super AWESOME!  My very picky son ate it.   The only thing I changed was I added taco seasoning to the meat while it browned and crumpled up some fritos and mixed it in.  The added crunch was a great touch!  Thanks for this!

This was excellent.  My kids loved it and some are pretty picky eaters.  I omitted the tomato since I didn't have any.  We like sour cream so I used about 3/4 to 1 cup sour cream instead.  Cheese is a favorite of ours too so of course I added a little bit more.  I used medium salsa.  It was scrumdiddlyumptious.  We loved it.

This was Fanastic.  I did what others suggested and used chili powder, garlic, ground cummin, green chilis, and taco seasoning.  However, instead of Noodles or rice, we chose to eat this dish, as a burito.  It is fabulous.  Thank You so much!!

Great base for a tasty recipe!  I took the advice of others and added the taco seasoning - it was a must, I think!  Also, instead of using egg noodles (due to the lack of egg noodles) I used farfalle (bow tie) noodles.  As a time and dish saver, I added 2 1/2 cups of water and boiled the noodles in the pan with everything and let it simmer until the noodles were soft and most of the water evaporated.  Fabulous!  The family gobbled it up!  Thanks for this tasty, quick meal!

This was very good and really appealed to me, but I do agree that it needs more seasoning or salsa to give it more flavor :)

I just LOVE this recipe.  I substituted ground turkey, a white onion and macaroni.  I also added taco seasoning.  It turned out great.  My picky son LOVED it.  This is a new staple dish for my home.

Wow, we were pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I made this because we were running low on groceries and did not feel like a trip to the store. I made this pretty much as written, however I did add a packet of taco seasoning and I kept the noodles, cheese and sour cream separate so everyone put as much or as little as they liked. My very skeptical husband actually said, 'what in the world is this?' when he saw what I had made...then kept saying 'man, this is so good, make this again!' after he tried it! The kids loved it and so did I. This is a nice change of pace, will make again. Adding a packet of taco seasoning is a must.

I followed the suggestions of some of the other people and used beef broth instead of water and added some spices while cooking.  
The other thing I did was -- after the ground beef was browned I added the onions and green peppers right to the pan and wilted them before adding the salsa.  I think it would take A LOT longer to cook if you don't do that.
It turned out great and I'll definitely make this again.  It was so quick and very delicious!

Rather bland.  I needed to add salt, cumin, chili powder and cilantro in order to have it taste like anything interesting.  In hindsight, olives would also make a nice addition, and I would have used beef broth instead of water, I think.

I like this meat mixture cooked with taco seasoning.  When serving, place meat on top of noodles on plate like the first picture shows.
And as one reviewer said, top with a little bit of Doritos, 'taco flavor Doritos' if you can find them.  If you have fresh cilantro, sprinkle it on top.  Cilantro makes everything better.

This was really great and my family all loved it.  I substituted macaronni for the egg noodles and used one half each chopped yellow and red bell peppers as I had no green. I stirred in a teaspoon of Taco Seasoning before the pasta.  I layered the shredded cheddar thickly (double the required amount) on top and served it all up with a side of white corn tortilla chips. Everyone used the chips to scoop the dinner and when all was said and done it received rave reviews.  A definite five star rating in my house.

I loved this recipe, but modified it as others did:  In addition to the ingrdients called for, I added minced garlic, taco seasoning and a can of green chilies.  I stirred in about a cup of sour cream at the end.  Since it is summer now I served it over Fritos like a taco salad instead of noodles.  I think this made it more summer-like.  We loved it!

This was quick and easy to make and chances are you already have the stuff in your fridge. I just added a little more sour cream and added a taco seasoning mix to the beef.

I thought this was very bland.  I followed the other suggestions, such as adding cream cheese, crumbling tortilla chips and lettuce on top, etc. but still found it needed something.  I think green chiles would be a good additon as well.  I used pico de gallo instead of salsa.

This was great and easy! I used ground turkey instead and add a half packet of taco seasoning. I omitted the onion and add the pepper as soon as the meet was cooked. I also add corn at the end as well. Convenientl enough, we had the "bottom of the bag" of some tortilla chips and added those on top.

Reading over other cooks reviews, I added the Taco Seasoning while the ground beast was browning. 
I can't imagine how bland it would have been without that addition. In fact I also added 1 TBS of McCormicks 1 Step Beef (Tex Mex Chili) to give it even more pizzazz ... In my opinion the extra spice(s) only added to the finished product. We love SPICY!
The chopped tomatoes on top, gave the dish the needed color, texture and flavor to this wonderful "Mexican Strogonoff". 
Wish I had made more now, I only made 1/2 recipe ... 
Thanks Kris for submitting the recipe.
For sure a keeper in my recipe book.

Great taste and quick to make.  Did not have gound beef so used gound venison. Used a spicey salsa for some bite. Mixed bell peppers which added lots of color. Chopped up a large white onion as I did not have enough green ones(used them as a garnish instead)and fried them up with the meat. I also used a few cloves of garlic minced. Replaced the egg noodles with multigrain fusilli and used fat free sour cream to cut down on some of the damage. :o) Though I did up the cheese to a cup as others had suggested.  Will be sure to make this again and next time for company....

Very good.  However, I added a few seasoning to give it more flavor.  When the ground beef was cooking I added: chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, onion powder and Tony's Chachere seasoning.  Instead of water, I used beef stock.

Pretty good! I made a lot of changes though, based on making it healthier and the ingredients I had on hand. 

1) I used ground turkey instead, and used 1.5lbs.
2) I used 12 oz of Healthy Harvest Egg noodles. 
3) I added 1 can of corn.
4) I used light sour cream.
5) I added 1/2 a pack of fajita seasoning and some extra cayenne pepper
6) I transferred everything into a 9x13, topped with organic blue tortilla crumbles (2 oz) and cheese (2% milk, 1 cup) and broiled for a couple of minutes
7) Made to serve 6 instead of 4 b/c of added noodles and meat
8) Topped with tomato and green part of green onions

I think that adding black beans would be good as well but I didn't do that this time. 1 serving was 540 calories, very filling.

Really good!  Used when I was in a rush and needed to use up ground beef.  I used brown rice instead of noodles.  I also mixed in a packet of taco seasoning when I added the salsa.  Family loved it!  Will make again for sure.

This was pretty good. We served over saffron rice (gluten intolerance) and I used green chiles instead of green peppers. Fresh tomatoes would definitely be better but all I had was canned. Being is easy to make is the best feature!

i took everyone's advice and added taco seasoning, but I felt it was a little TOO flavorful with that in addition to the onions, salsa, sour cream and cheese. So I think next time I'll use half of the packet I used macaroni noodles, too (because i don't like the texture of egg noodles) and it turned out great! I think I'll use the other advice and try it with rice next time.

I made this twice now.  The first time, I forgot the salsa, so instead I used just a little of the HOT rotel in the can, and then added some tomato sauce to try to get the moisture similar to what you would get using the straight salsa, other than that, I followed the directions, and my family really liked it. (Other than the fact that it was a TAD too spicy for my kids.)  My kids wanted to put more sour cream on thier individual servings, which was really good.  And my husband likes cheese, so I was putting extra cheese on the individual servings as well.  So second time I made it, I used the salsa, and instead of the green onion, I used sweet yellow onion, which was good.  But for the serving of it, instead of putting the cheese on top, again i put cheese on each serving and some of us topped it with sour cream and some also used fresh pico de gallo that I made, it was REALLY good.  We only had a very small portion leftover.  I WILL be making this dish again and again, family loves it.  Its kinda like a hamburger helper type of dish, but with more flavor and fresher. VERY GOOD

This was overall pretty good; I too added taco seasoning to the ground beef.  Omitted the tomatoes since DH doesn't care for them.  DH also said to use something other than noodles next time (he's not a noodle fan -- thinks "noodles = Italian" and he's not crazy about Italian; but he doesn't mind noodles in original Hamburger Helper, go figure!), so we'll be trying either Mexican rice or tostadas or something else in place of the noodles.  But a great starter recipe that you can customize easily to suit your own tastes, thanks!

Excellent flavor and recipe. I did not use as much water so that it would be less soupy. I also added sliced black olive -- a nice addition. Instead of noodles (which I did once), I prefer to serve on tostada shells.

I made this recipe for my husband and he thought that it was fabulous! He did ask me to add more sour cream, cheese and salsa on the top after I served it to him, which actually made it even better. I will make this recipe again!

I used 1 medium white onion instead of the green onions and cooked it with the meat.  I added comino, chili powder, seasoning salt and fresh garlic to the meat as well.  I used medium chipotle salsa and yellow bell pepper instead of green.  Also, I served this over rice instead of noodles.  Easy and tasty!

Great quick and easy recipe! My suggestion to folks having trouble with the seasoning is to try using a milder or hotter salsa, depending on your preference. Also, don't be afraid to personalize it using your favorite veggies and spices.

This was a very good dish!  I used double the salsa b/c it was too dry and next time I will add some taco seasoning or something b/c it wasn't quite flavorful enough.  But, other than that, it was a quick, delicious meal!

I had high hopes for this recipe, as i love mex flavored foods.  My husband liked it, altho i thought it was pretty bland, and that was AFTER i added cumin and frozen corn, a bit more salsa and sour cream to the mix. I then added a bit more cheese and mixed it through, and baked in the oven for about 15 min. Has great potential tho.

I just had a baby in February so I am always looking for quick, easy,  and tasty recipes since my time is limited.  I've never tried making a casserole and this one seemed simple and delicious.  Actually I prepared this recipe twice.  The second time around I added two tablespoons of taco seasoning to enhance the  flavor and I stir fried chopped round onions (1/4 cup) w/ the ground beef.  Add a pinch of garlic salt and black pepper. You should also let it simmer for at least 20-30 minutes to tenderize the beef.  I really liked the recipe but even more when I made my little changes.

I changed the name of this to "Mexican Stroghanoff" because of the sour cream and noodle combination involved.  I added about a cup and a half of salsa to the recipe and mixed the cheese through.  Reheats very well.

My entire family loved it! Added minced garlic to ground beef while cooking along with ground cumin, chili powder, couple cilantro leaves and squirts of lime juice. After browning beef added taco seasoning then added the water and salsa as directed. I  Sauteed white onion, yellow peppers and sliced jalepeno. I layered it all: egg noodles, ground beef mix, cheese,  onion and peppers mix, sour cream on top, poured a little salsa over top, added cilantro leaves and squirt of lime!

I did not care for this recipe. It was like mush...even though I switched it up and added more spices ,,,,,will not make again. Ok for tacos or burritos, but not as the main meal by itself.

We really liked this dish. I made a few changes:  my kids don't like really spi y food so I reduced the salsa to about 3/4 cup, and added about 1/3 cup cream cheese to mellow the mexican flavor a bit. We prefer rice to noodles with mexican food so I used white rice. Also, I didn't have green onions but the medium salsa compensated for that. We just ladled the meat mixture over the rice, and added some black beans and avocado on the side. It's a hearty winter dish I would make again.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I did however make a few changes.  I used a can of EL Pato, and deleted the Sour Cream and added the egg noodles directly to the skillet instead of pre-cooking and added some extra water and let them cook in the dish.   This recipe was rated as a "repeat" dinner by the family as everyone enjoyed it.  Took less than 30 minutes to prepare and cook.  Great recipe for a meal on short notice.

This recipe is excellent and its very easy to make.I added taco seasoning and I used broth instead of water. Top it off with cilantro and you have a very tasty dish. I also subbed whole wheat noodles instead of egg noodles and it tasted great.

We loved this recipe. Such a nice change from regular pasta. I used yellow peppers, red onion and mushrooms because that's what I had on hand. Next time I'll try the veggies that recipe calls for. I also used some taco seasoning as recommended in the comments.  It was easy to make a healthier version with whole wheat noodles, low fat sour cream and cheese.  My family asked to make this one a regular!

This was really good.  I used ground turkey instead and it turned out well.  I had a can of Herdez green chile salsa (7oz) and used that and omitted the tomatoes only because I didn't have them on hand.  Used fat free sour cream, added garlic powder and used a white onion instead of green due to preference.  I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good recipe.  I added a package of taco seasoning mix and more water to add a little more spice to it.

Good stuff though.

My husband RAVED about this recipe...I modified it by using rice (seasoned with chili powder and cumin) instead of noodles and instead of sour cream I used cream cheese...YUM!

The first few bites of this, I was like "hmm, it's okay"... then a few more bites and I thought "this is pretty good". Then my plate was empty... so I got seconds! :) All I did differently was that I browned the beef with 1 clove of garlic, omitted the onion, and only used 1/2 a green pepper. This is a very filling dish and a great quick, one skillet dinner. Thanks so much!

This was very good. It reminds me of a homemade Hamburger Helper. Took the same amount of time to cook and even better was the home grown ingredients I used instead of powder in a box!

This recipe was wonderful.  I didn't have the exact ingredients so I substituted rotel tomatoes for the salsa and omitted the water and bell pepper.  My DH loved it because the rotel added spice!  Also added some taco seasoning.  We loved it ....thanks

This was really good.  I used alot more cheese that it called for.  Also, I used mild salsa but will use medium next time to make it a bit spicier.

Made this yesterday for dinner...and this was pretty good...my mom wanted hotter salsa, but we all said no!!! It was fine just the way that we made it!! The only thing that I would change is add some pepper. That is all otherwise it was great!!! You can also use some canned tomatoes.

I loved the idea of this recipe. I added cumin powder, chili powder, ancho chili powder, salt and pepper to the meat. I followed the recipe after that except I didn't add the pasta to the mixture. I plated the the pasta first and then added the meat mixture. I topped this with diced tomato, diced avocado, and salsa verade sauce. It was ready in less then an hour and my entire family enjoyed dinner.

I love this dish.  I did take one reviewer's advice and added salt, Cumin and chili powder.  I didn't have green onions, so used regular and instead of salsa, I added one can of Rotel Tomatoes undrained (Original).  I cooked the beef with the onions and green pepper.  When I added the Rotel, I simmered with the seasonings.  My 14-year-old LOVED it and ate the leftovers. It did have a little kick with the Chili Powder.  I will definitely make this every chance I get.

Soooo good!  

Our favorite version is with taco flavored meat, using the Taco Seasoning I Recipe for the seasoning!

A good comfort dish though heavy on saturated fat.  I added salt, pepper, and a couple of squirts of sriracha sauce for more zing.

I took some other people's advice and added some taco seasoning and garlic to the meat.  I also added a jar of salsa and a little can of diced green chilies and a can of corn.  To cut the acidity of the salsa I added about a half a cup of sugar and some worcestershire sauce. Served the finished product with some tortilla chips and topped it with some fresh chopped onion and diced tomato, but next time I'll top it with some pico de gallo.

Yummy! I made a couple of changes to this. I added a chopped red pepper, increased the salsa by about half, and served each plate with a whole diced roma tomato and a handful of sliced green onions. I like Mexican-style food better with rice than noodles, so I just omitted the noodles and served the beef spooned over rice with the cheese sprinkled over all. Quick, easy and tasty, what more can you ask for when you get home at 6pm and don't want to spend all night in the kitchen?

This was an easy and quick mid week meal.  I needed to use up some left over taco meat and this recipe was great for that.  I will agree it was a little bland for us, we ended up using a lot of salt at the table.  All in all it was good and even better the next day.  I will use this recipe again with some extra salt and pepper.

We enjoyed this, but we did veer a little off of the recipe. I added 1 1/2 c. frozen corn and a can of kidney beans instead of egg noodles. I served it with cilantro lime rice on the side. It was good this way, but I agree with others that it would be better with more seasoning.

It was fairly quick to make, and it tasted decent, but it's not something I would make again.  My husband commented, "Hummmm.  Hamburger Helper from scratch."

To me, it was much like homemade hamburger helper.  I did add chili powder, cumin and salt to the ground beef and some fresh cilantro when I added the pasta. My family enjoyed it and it was a fast weeknight meal.  Thanks!

I was looking for something that used my leftover egg noodles, and this did the trick!  I love the update on 'hamburger helper' with the fresh veggies, and it had a great mix of flavors.  This is going in my permanent recipe box!

This was "okay" but not remarkable.  It reminded me of Mac 'n Cheese with the addition of ground beef.  It was easy to prepare, as I had all the ingredients as well as some leftover pasta.  I assembled the dish on the stove-top as recipe indicated, but I put it into the oven to bake while I was preparing the rest of meal.  If I make this a second time, I will add more cheese inbetween layers of the pasta/meat mixture and I think that will kick up the flavor a bit.
