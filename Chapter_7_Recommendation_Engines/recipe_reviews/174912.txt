They were a little dry but had a nice texture.  I didn't have mini chips so I used large ones instead.  I also substituted toffee bits for the nuts.

I substitute 1/2 c. of cocoa powder for 1/2 c. of the flour, and stir in green mint chips.  Then after the cookies have cooled for 3-4 minutes, I GENTLY shake them in a bag of powdered sugar.  When they cool completely, I put them back in the bag and gently shake again.  My family devours these every time !!

These are fabulous!  When I was a kid my mom made Russian teacakes at Christmas and I never liked them-they're too bland.   I was thrilled when I found this recipe which is similar but actually has some flavor.  I add some cinnamon to mine-maybe a teaspoon, I never measure.  My 8 year ols son loves these!

I used walnuts as the nut and thought the chocolate chips totally overwhelmed where you couldn't taste the walnuts.  Some of my cookies were larger and the middles didn't get done.  I was hoping you could taste the nuts more, so only gave this a '3'.  Very similar to choc chip cookies.

These cookies were a dry cookie and a little crumbly but they have a good flavor.  Almost the texture of a pecan log but with mini chocolate chips.
