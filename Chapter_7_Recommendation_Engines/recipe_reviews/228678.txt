The pickles were delicious!

I had some leftover pickling liquid, and I couldn't bear to throw it out (about 3 cups worth). So what I did was make some great BBQ sauce by adding a jar of tomato sauce, then boiled it down until it was reduced by half. I added a little bit of cornstarch as well just to thicken it up even more. I poured it over some chicken to bake, then poured the pan drippings over rice.  It was delicious and everyone in my family loved it.

What a brilliant recipe! No one guesses that these are zucchini instead of cucumber and I get to use all my bumper crop of zucchini in a way fun and unique way.

These pickles are delicious! I just love them! I did some in chunks and some in thin slices, the pickling liquid is almost good enough to drink by itself :) The only issue I had was coming out short on veggies, so I would measure to make sure you have enough.

Never pickled anything before...had some zucchini coming off and started hunting for recipes. This one came up and we gave it a try. Oh my goodness......absolutely wonderful!! We saved the liquid after the pickles were gone and marinated chicken in it then cooked chicken, tators, onions, mushrooms, carrots, peas, corn, zucchini, and pineapple like a roast in it....no words can describe how amazing all the flavors meshed. It was an excellent meal that had everyone going back for seconds.

Great recipe.   Fantastic taste and relatively easy to make.   I wish the slices were crisper, but they were good.   The only other issue is that this will not make 3 quarts or pickles, more like 1 1/2 or 2 at best.   The brine was the perfect amount for 2 quarts.  I don't have canning equipment, so I stopped after step 3.   I then let jars rest until sealed, then will refrigerate until they are eaten.   I think if I wanted crisper slices, I could dump the hot liquid on the slices in the jars, then seal.

Warning the recipe states 2 lbs zucchini yields 3 qts I think they meant 3 pints. I did 10 lbs zucchini (5times all ingredients) and instead of getting 15 qts I got 7 plus 1 pint. Half what the recipe stated. Other then that I made these today and they were pretty straight forward. I have not done much canning before and for a first time solo these were a good start. I tasted some prior canning and was very pleased. Fewer jars then expected was both good and bad, good because it means I can make another batch if I want without having more then I could ever use. 10 lbs of zucchini was only 1week of harvest. Bad because I had taken time to prep slot more jars then needed. 3 stars because of that.

Excellent recipe!  These are so good and provide a tasty solution for using up that zucchini that never seems to stop coming!  If I don't have quite enough poundage of zucchini, I combine it with sliced cucumbers. Basically you need 1-1/2 cups of vinegar  and 1 cup sugar with each pound of zucchini, so I try to do batches of 3# of zucchini to make the canning process more worth the work.  I like to use part white vinegar and part ACV, but I should warn you that the hot ACV will stain your counter, so be sure and protect your counter, unless you don't mind doing some heavy scrubbing with baking soda.

We've made and canned these for several years now.  We have a large garden in upstate NY and when the Zucchini comes in, it comes in bushels!   The process of canning is pretty easy...but a lost art.  We give jars of these sweet and zesty treats to our friends as a gift.  They're great as an appetizer with a drink before dinner.  Our late friend who passed a few years ago at the age of 87 would take a fork and eat an entire jar while chatting and having martinis with us!

Very good and easy recipe! Taste almost like my grandmother's bread and butter pickles. My father in law hates cucumbers so this is a great alternative, I will be making lots of these.

These are outstanding pickles!  I cut mine into spears as well as thin slices, and liked the spears better.  Also added some sliced jalapenos to the recipe.

This recipe is excellent.  Everyone that tried them thought they were made with cucumbers.  The recipe did not fill  3 quart jars for me.  I made them a second time with more vegetables and a little more of the ingredients for the brine and did get 3 quarts.  Delicious!!

These turned out really well!  The only change I made was adding a little pickle crisp to the jar, and they WERE crispy.  I made both rounds and spears, and the rounds held their crisp better.  I am making more today, and I will probably cut the sugar down, as they were a bit too sweet for my hubby.

I made it exactly as directed and they were great. Of course it is only 3 pints. Using 2 pounds of zucchini how could you be surprised it was not 3 quarts.

The only change we made was to let the zucchini, onions and salt set over-night. Other than that we followed the recipe. These are great right out of the jar! Next batch I'm going to drop a few hot peppers in the mix.....I've made 4 batches so far. The first was a test to see if we like them and the last 3 I did 10 lbs. of zucchini each that made 6 quarts. (That's how much we loved them) I didn't quite 5x the recipe for that much, but just adjust to your taste.

Congratulations and thanks for this great recipe.  When I tasted it before cooking I thought it needed something more.  I ground in some fennel seeds.  Perfect!  Everyone loves it. Made 2 batches In the past month and making more this week for gifts. I sliced the zucchini thinly.

Lovely recipe, everyone love it, I did my zucchini in very thin ribbons which is nice, next time I will cut down the onion, thought it was a bit much, used celery leaves minced (2 tablespoons) since nowhere in my shops here, still came out great! Even the husband liked it and he's the fussiest with things like this. Highly recommend this recipe.

Just opened our first jar of these.  A delicious bread and butter style pickle.  Maybe not quite as crunchy as a cucumber pickle, but very good.  I used Walla Walla sweet onions in these, and the only pieces are to die for!  Husband said they were as good or better than the store-bought bread and butter slices I'd been using.  Will do again.

I agree with other reviewers that these did not make as many jars as indicated.  I doubled the recipe and got 6 pints of pickles.

I used 3 lbs and doubled the brine and got 6 pint jars exactly full! Such an amazing flavor.
I let them sit in the hot liquid for 4 hours, I went out, and they were epic!

2.5# of food processor sliced zucchini (so paper thin-oops) plus 1/2# of onions made for 4 pints of pickles.  The last pint had more liquid than pickles but it still filled it to the top for headspace.  I'm letting them marinate before opening a jar but the sample pieces I stole were tasty.

We had a plethora (A PLETHORA, I SAY) of zucchini from one plant in our garden so I made these. I followed the recipe exactly, though I didn't have any mustard seed. These pickles are GREAT! Keep in mind these are kind of a sweet pickle. I think next time I might put more onion in because they were as good as the zucchini. And maybe a little more pickling liquid, as I ran a bit short. Reluctantly gave two jars away to relatives. Highly recommended!

I will probably put in more zucchini.  I put it into pint jars thinking it would make six jars but it only made four.  Can't wait to try them.  I also added red pepper flakes and a cayenne pepper.

My family and I love these pickles! I halved the sugar and added jalapeño slices to each jar. I made them in 2mm and 4mm slices, because some of us like them thin to pile on a sandwich and some of us like them thicker to snack on. Lovely!

I made this in a very small batch just to see how it would turn out since I've never pickled zucchini. I did add some garlic cloves (whole), dill and a pickling spice mix. Just did them last night but will see what they taste like. Pretty easy to follow just mostly waiting around for the veggies to soak. I used a mandolin to make very thin slices.

When I first told my family that these pickles were made with zucchini instead of cukes, they were a little sceptical but, one taste and they were hooked!!! Love this recipe!!

Had an over abundance of zucchini and this saved the day!  Just as good if not better than made with cucumbers!  Only thing it does make less than what it quotes but delicious!

I was very happy that the zucchini remained crisp. I added peppercorns to the list of spices and everything turned out much better than I had expected. I've not been a fan of zucchini pickles in the past, but this recipe is a keeper for the seemingly never ending supply of zucchini my garden keeps producing.

SO GOOD!!!  These come out crunchy and fabulous!  I get asked to bring these to family functions all the time.  It is a great way to use up all of that zucchini.  I try to pick the zucchini while it is still quite small since the texture is better.  ENJOY!!!

This exactly how I make my bread and butter pickles (no prepared mustard though) with cucumbers. I can't wait to try this recipe with zucchini. For some reason it's hard to get nice pickling cucumbers where I live, but zucchini is no problem. Thanks for inspiring me to try something a little bit different. I know already that I will love them.

Great pickles. Can't even tell they're zucchini. Waaaay too sweet for me though. Great on burgers though.

This is delicious! Such a treat. It does take a good long time with all the waiting but I find filling that time with making jams and cucumber pickles a great way to fill a day of canning

Taste great, assuming you like sweet pickles.  Indistinguishable from cucumber pickles.

The pickles were good.  My husband loves all sweet pickles, so it was win win BUT I only got 3 pints NOT 3 Qts.  I even weighed everything since it was my first time making them. The other thing that was confusing was it said 1:35 min to prepare, how can that be when you soak for two hours, then add the boiling syrup and soak again for two hours. A lot of time for three pints of pickles.  If I had known I would have doubled the recipe.  The taste is very good.

Exceptional recipe!  Thank you so much for this.  I used your spices and I used pickling spices and both turned out with a wonderful flavor.  I do suggest if anyone uses pickling spices to add the prepared mustard.  You nailed it with regards to flavor but my two pounds of zucchini did only yield 3 pints using all the liquids.

This recipe was in my new magazine and had to try it.  WOW...Great...everyone wanted a jar so i had to make another batch.  Will definately be making these over and over again.
