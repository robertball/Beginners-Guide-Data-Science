I made this for lunch today since my kids and I are fond of spaghetti. I left out most of the vegetables because they would not have eaten them in spaghetti and used cream of celery instead of mushroom. I served this over bow tie pasta for a change...(we just had spaghetti noodles the other day) and we really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing Amy.

After reading other reviews, I was hoping this would turn out better than it did.  My family wasn't very impressed with this dish.  Sorry, Amy, but I won't make this again.

THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!! I have looked for a long time for the recipe for Chicken Spaghetti and this is exactly what my mother made when I was a child. My family was very skeptical and asked questions while I was cooking; however when it came time to eat there was very little talking going on! They LOVED it and I will definatly make this many more times in the future! My husband even took some to share with is co-workers and they all wanted the recipe!:) Thanks for Sharing!

I've searched for this exact recipe for over a year. Was given to me by a favorite aunt and fabulous cook. At Pot-Lucks it goes immediately. Family and friends love it. Thank you Allrecipes and especially Amy Barthelemy! Gail Cobile.

I'm rating this only 4 since I had to add some spice to it! Salt and pepper only for taste. I didn't use bell pepper but did add some diced onion chopped mushrooms and freshly minced garlic. I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning before grilling. Used angel hair pasta instead of spaghetti. Very filling dish. Could cut in half or freeze half of it as it is a great freezer meal.

This was O.K. and would probably try again but with possibly marinated and grilled chicken for more flavor.

I use fajita grilled chicken (diced) in this several times and I find that the flavor is outstanding. You can use the pre-cooked packaged type or grill your own. Leave out the oil except for a teaspoon of olive oil to saute the veggies in. Add 1 tablespoon Mrs. Dash original to boost flavors. I also changed my latest versions to use 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. Great recipe! Adjust to your preferences.

This was the first chicken spaghetti I made and it was hit with my guests and there was plenty left over for lunch during the week. Question: Where do you find 15 oz cans of chopped olives? The 4 oz can worked fine for me.

My husband and I thought it was ok. We felt it was missing some kind of punch. He would prefer there was no olives. My daughter who is 21 months loved it. However I am thankful I made this because in about 30 mins after dinner my daughter broke out in hives. Turns out she is allergic to olives. So now i am aware of a food allergy. I guess I wont be making this again.

I thought this overall was a good recipe. My husband and I both thought it needed more sauce and that it needed a little something more. Next time I will add a can of cream of celery and maybe some italian and oregano seasoning.

Sorry - How do you all of this work in 15 minutes? Came out very thick and gooy - not saucy enough. Not enough taste - I think if you changed from soup to tomato sauce and used parmeson cheese instead of american you could have a winner. Thanks anyway

Amy. this is great but as all good cooks should know cooked chicken is bland so I always use seasoned and fried breasts. As for the veggies I use them all cuz kids don't mind them at all. My grand babies ask me to make this all the time. The best part of this recipe is that there is no tomatoes in it. Who ever said that spaghetti has to be with tomato sauce? Great recipe and if i could I give it more stars. Hope the picture did it justice.

Kid friendly recipe. OMG this was wonderful for kids and adults. 1st place on my kids and grand-kids list! If you don't have an ingredient besides the chicken pasta and soup -drop it. (you can make your own soup-btw) If you have really picky eaters just take the stuff they don't like out and gradually add them in.... I would add olives per family taste.

I wanted to like this, but I thought it was very bland.  The only addition I made was to add season salt to the water I boiled the chicken in. Since the recipe only says to use cooked chicken, I wasn't exactly sure of the cooking method for the chicken.  Perhaps seasoning the chicken and grilling it may help. Also, I think people who post recipes should be clearer about ingredients they use.  This recipe calls for processed cheese.  Is that plain American cheese slices, white American, Velveeta? No one knows! All have different flavors.

Im reviewing just to say this is the only Chicken Spaghetti recipe you need but I can't say it's a kids dish. It is close to the original old school recipe my family uses. I call it birth day Spaghetti and request it annually.  I had a hard time locating a normal version searching the internet but this is the right one. Thanks for not reinventing the wheel.
