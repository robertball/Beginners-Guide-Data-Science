I personally think that the filling tastes much better in mini-graham crusts (buy in the grocer's baking section). The puff-pastries don't have much flavor. I made half of the filling recipe to fill 8 mini-pies. I pre-baked the shells for 5 minutes after brushing them with an egg white. These are very rich and filling. I thought these were very easy to make, had a cute presentation (with mint-sprigs as garnish) & a nice dessert for entertaining.

This was supper easy and really good.  I was looking for a strawberry pie recipe which had the cream cheese layer and found this instead.  It is like a strawberry creampuff.  My family raved.  I also made only half the recipe and it still turned out great!

I just made and ate one of these strawberry clouds and I have high hopes my guests tonight will like them as much as I did.  I found the frozen pastry puffs near the waffles and the brand was peppridge farm.  I noticed they make flat sheets as well and a cake of these could be made quite easily.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I did not alter a thing.  They taste great. Light and airy. I was able to eat the whole thing, imagine that. I could have had another to be honest. This is a great summer dessert and we are pairing it with steak and asparagus.  I am also serving a guac. dip with chips before hand. Thanks!

WOW!!  VERY IMPRESSIVE!!  I made these for a small dinner party.  Although there are a lot of steps to this recipe, they are all very easy and all can be done ahead.   I filled the shells 4 hours ahead of serving and was pleased that they didn’t get soggy.  Then to serve, I drizzled the plate with some chocolate syrup, placed the filled shell on the plate, spooned strawberries over including some of the accumulated juices, added another dollop of the cream cheese mixture, topped with the pastry top and a sprig of lemon balm!  Beautiful!!  I hope the picture I am posting does this justice.  Trust me, this one’s a showstopper!!  Oh, and very yummy too!  For extra decadence, serve some additional chocolate syrup at the table!

This had a bunch of steps but it came out fabulous. I did not have the puff pastry shells - so I used Dunkin Hines white cake mix to make cupcakes (I prefer it to the yellow cake mix). I did not add the sugar to the strawberries as they were already sweet! I used toffuti cream cheese to keep it non-dairy and added a couple of drops of red food coloring to the cream cheese mixture to make it pink. I followed the instructions of piping the filling and adding the strawberries, and served it right away! It really was a big hit!

I made the "cloud" portion of this recipe and it was delicious with fresh strawberries!  Very easy and simple too.  It definitely turned out looking elegant and difficult. :)

Much like a strawberry shortcake...only with puff pastry...and a little jazzed up since the whipped cream has the cream cheese in it.

Excellent.  I just made these.  The first time always takes longer, next time...and there WILL be a next time, it will be much quicker.  I used both the puff pastry shells, which I have used before and am fond of, and the graham shell.  As with a previous review, I brushed them with egg white and baked them for about 5 min.  I do think the graham adds a bit more flavor, but the pastry has great presentation.  The filling is really good.  We pick huckleberries in my part of the country, and am always looking for recipes to use them with.  Going to try it with a huckleberry topping this summer.  Give this recipe a try!

This is a quick, easy dessert.  I'm serving it this afternoon at a family BBQ.  I followed the recipe exactly this time, next time I would substitute Almond Extract for all, or part, of the Vanilla Extract.  The Puff Pastries are simple to make, which adds to the ease of the recipe.  However, I think I will try it with homemade Cream Puffs next go around.  All in all, a keeper.

Along with another recipe, the cream filling never came out the way it said it would.

YUM!! How easy are these? And everyone liked them. I couldn't not find any puff pastry shells last minute so I used mini graham cracker pie shells. They were like little strawberry pies, so pretty. Next time I may add just a hint more suger to the cream.

I couldn't find the pastry shells at any stores so used small tart shells.  I only needed a smal amountof the mixtre to fill thse.  Flavor was okay but maybe not a fair asessment since I couldn't find the pastry shells which would've held a lot more.

Very easy to prepare. I didn't use the tops of the  puff pastries. I used more strawberries and put them around the pastry on the plate with additional cream. Everyone really enjoyed this simple recipe.

We love this one.  I only changed one thing, I used butter flavored crescents instead of puff pastry shells.  They were fab.  One of  my friends told me when I bake again she especially wants these.

I would make it again. It was fairly easy. I did have a ton of strawberries and cream cheese left over though. Probably only needed half of what was called for.

This recipe is fantastic!  I did tweak it a little.  I chopped approx. 1 cup of strawberries with 1 tsp of sugar.  Then cooked it down for approx. 5 minutes.  Then cooled it and incorporated it with the with the cream cheese before combining it with the whipped cream.

I followed the recipe to a "T". I liked the filling alot. I went strawberry picking and I needed to use up my last 2 pounds and this recipe was perfect to use. I'm not a big fan of those pastry shells. Homemade ones are so much lighter. This recipe would have been perfect if used in those individual graham crust tins. The pastry puffs just don't do it for me....and they are expensive too!
