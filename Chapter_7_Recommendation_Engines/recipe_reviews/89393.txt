Update: still 4stars, 12 yrs later (2018) - made it again and now have measurements ;).  Hubby liked overall.  Not family fave, but still good in general with modifications:
1 tsp of basil, 1/2 tsp of thyme, 1 tbps minced onion, 2 tbps of parm cheese, 1 clove garlic, 1 cup lemon juice, pineapple juice, pepper to taste - all as marinade for 20 minutes (I did for 2 filets). For any novices like me - as fyi when I say marinade - in bag for 20 mins, sauce was not put into the oven with fish.  Only added the milk/pineapple for the oven.
-- 2006 review below:
I really enjoyed, but I did alter quite a bit. Didn't use measurements, but thought I would at least list what I put in...
black pepper, garlic, minced onion, basil, parm cheese, 1 cp lemon juice, pineapple juice.
All mixed in bag and marinated the fish in it for 20 mins before baking.  Added milk as directions stated, and pineapple tidbits on top.
I really enjoyed, a lot of flavor and wasn't too much lemon.
:-)

This was a good recipe, with a few modifications.  I used 2 tsp of each herb and the drained pineapple juice to marinate the fish.  This intensified the flavors.

I changed this up to no milk and a 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  I also dumped my pineapple juice on to cook with it.  It was okay, i probably would add garlic next time.

I have been trying to incorporate more fish into my diet so tried this recipe.  I used less lemon juice and milk and still turned out pretty moist.  I liked the thyme and basil combination.

This recipe was good, but lacked flavor.  I might try this without the pineapple and try a lemon pepper version of this.

my girlfriend and i liked this recipe. we took some of the suggestions and marinated the fish in the pineapple and lemon juice for about twenty minutes. dont think that i will use the milk the next time it just seemed like there was no need for curdled milk.

The dish was the tastiest Mahi Mahi I have tasted (1st time cooking it though). I did find that there was too much lemon juice as it drowned the fish and added to cooking time by almost double at 350. Pineapple evened out the lemon. Good dish, will make it again with tweaking.

This did not turn out well at all for me. I would recommend using only a 1/2 cup of lemon juice opposed to the full 2 cups. Once you get past the strong lemon flavor, it wasn't too bad.

Followed SMILIE224's suggestions as well and added pepper, minced onion, minced garlic, Parmesan cheese, pineapple juice, and 1 cup of lemon juice. Used 5 fish filets, 3 mahi mahi and 2 ahi tuna. We also omitted the milk. The lemon flavor was still strong even though it was diluted by the pineapple juice and used less than the recipe called for. I can't imagine how bad it would have been if we'd followed the recipe as written. I can see why it only has 3 stars overall. I would give this recipe 4 stars with the adjustments I made. I normally at least try to make a recipe as written so I can give it a proper review, but this one just seemed like a fail from the get-go. Was a good base though.

This recipe didn't make alot of sense to me.  It would be better to marinate the fish prior and not mix up a curdled milk in the pan that didn't do much except make it a pain to clean.  Also it is quite bland.  Had to sprinkle seafood seasoning on the fish.  Would have been better marinating in coconut milk and sprinkling a small amt of lemon on prior to baking.  With the price of fish, better to look for a more flavorful recipe.

After alterations it was still just ok. I tried to find a recipe that incorporated Mahi Mahi and what I already had in my pantry, especially after reading some of the other reviews. So I used Spike seasoning instead of basil & thyme and less than a cup of lemon juice. I also placed the pineapple juice in with the milk. I probably won't make this again but I'm giving it 3 stars because it fine but wasn't something I'd add to my recipe box.

I did not like this at all. I give it 2 stars because my girlfriend liked it. I thought it was bland. She liked it because you could taste the fish and it wasn't killed with seasonings. I thought 2 cups of lemon juice was overkill. The basil and thyme just floated around. the fish was completely submerged in liquid. I won't make this again

I liked this recipe but like others, I tweaked it as well.  I spritzed each filet with olive oil. I only used 2 T of lemon juice total for both filets.  Added garlic powder, pepper, and pinch of salt along with the thyme and basil.  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I cooked at 375 for 35 minutes as I live in higher elevation so some things here take longer to cook.  Sprinkled a small amount of parmesan cheese over the top at the end.  Very flaky and tasty with the mix of flavors.

This got mixed reviews.  My husband really liked this, but my son (who does not really like commercial fish) didn't.  Granted my son felt that it was just the commercial fish and not the flavor.  Personally, I can think of better ways of preparing fish.

My rating comes with some altercations to the recipe.  First, I marinated the fish for 30 minutes in  1/2c lemon juice & 1/2 c pineapple juice and then baked the fish with coconut milk.  I can't imagine using regular milk with this dish.

Wonderful flavor. I followed the advise of SMILIE224 and I was not disappointed. I made this with the sweet potato pineapple mash found on this website. My mom and grand mom LOVED it.

Omitted the milk completely, significantly lessened the lemon juice and added lots of pineapple.  I love the flavor the pineapple adds to it.

I took the advice of many of the other reviewers and didn't use as much lemon juice and NO milk.  I did, however, use orange juice in the bottom of my baking pan and sprinkled lemon juice on the fish itself.  I wasn't real impressed by this recipe. I thought it would have more flavor. We did like the pineapple chunks.  The weird combination of the spices on the pineapple made them so tasty!

Maybe I made too many changes to say I “used it. But it was my starting point.
I grilled it over apple wood chips smoke.  
I used a marinade – of black pepper, garlic, minced onion, thyme and basil in, 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice & ½ cup of fresh pineapple juice. I marinated the fish for an hour before grilling.  It was then grilled at 250* –  w/ long wedges of fresh pineapple on top. 

===========================================================
Served w/ grilled sweet potato slices, grilled Asparagus and grilled sweet corn.

Marinated the swordfish in pineapple juice with  a Tablespoon of lemon juice .  Sautéed onion and garlic in olive oil, basil, thyme salt and pepper. Then added a splash of lemon juice and reduced the liquid.  Added fish filets skin side DOWN to pan and covered and cooked until fish was HALFWAY done. Removed filets added ALL the marinade and replaced the filets in the pan off to one side.  Added cooked fettuccine noodles, sliced pineapple(1 ring per fish), grape tomatoes and THIN slices of  both green and yellow zucchini . Cooked until fish was flaky,  vegetables were tender and fettuccine was heated and coated with oil/marinade mixture. Added a little parmesan cheese to pasta/vegetables and served. It was a hit!

I liked this recipe in that it was very simple to put together and fish turned out very good. If there were a few more ingredients it may have been even better though like something spicy to pair with the sweetness of the pineapple.

We made this with only 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice and instead of the basil and thyme we used caribbean jerk seasoning.  It was wonderful served with rice.  Healthy summer meal!

I had four fillets, used 3/4 c lemon juice, and pineapple with juice. Marinated 20 minutes beforehand, baked for about 30 minutes. I still didn't care for it. I hate to give bad ratings, but there just wasn't anything we liked about it.

After reading all the reviews I really only referred to this recipe for cooking time.  I marinated the fish in pineapple juice and a splash of lemon juice, sprinkled some cajun seasoning on top and covered with the pineapple chuncks....pretty good.

This turned out real well when I made it last night. As for the milk in the pan,  I don't know what it's supposed to do, since it came out burnt. Maybe I needed to pour more of it. Something to keep in mind next time. Plus, I added more pineapple chunks to my fish fillets and had quinoa with it as a side dish.

Very good. I added  sprinkle of cajun seasoning on each fillet (4) because I like highly seasoned food.

The pineapple was good. The herb combination was goo.... BUT- NEVER EVER use that much lemon juice! Definitely recommend at least half the quantity or less. Completely spoiled it.
