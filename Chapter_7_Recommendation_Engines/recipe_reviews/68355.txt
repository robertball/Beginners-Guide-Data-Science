I suggest omitting the bacon if one chooses to enhance the flavors with chocolate...painstaking, and worthwhile as it is delicious!

I had a lot of fun making this recipe and I liked the addition of the chocolate. It adds a nice, subtle flavor component but also gave the sauce a lovely, rich, brown color. I would say this made enough to serve more like 6 or 8 people than 4- and my husband eats a lot!
