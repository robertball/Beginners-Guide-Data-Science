Wait... a risotto that is creamy and delicious and I didn't have to stand there tending to its every need for an hour?  Wow!  Now don't get me wrong, one of the reasons I make risotto is to glean some therapeutic affect from all the focused love I put into the dish, but this ZATARAIN'S dish is wonderful and easy!
We have a weeknight winner here for sure!

This was really good as written.  The only thing I did different was substitute the heavy cream with half and half.  I served with breaded chicken tenders, and it was perfect.  The only problem I had was finding the Zatrains Yellow Rice!  I will definitely make again.

Used half & half instead of cream and subbed parmesan for the Monterey Jack.  Really good!

I made it for Easter and doubled up everything.  It was a hit and no leftovers.  I will be making this again.
