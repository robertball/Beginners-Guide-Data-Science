I served this dish along side a marinated pork tenderloin and it worked great. Everybody raved about how delicious it was. A word of caution however -- not a good recipe for those trying to lose weight . . .

I used low-fat milk in place of the heavy cream to cut some of the fat and it still turned out beautifully.  I will definitely make again.  I used brown button mushrooms and I think it would be good with any type you prefer.

I made this for a dinner party for my parents and future-in-laws. I was worried because I had cooked it for 2 hours and the potatoes were not done! I cooked it for another hour at 425 and I was able to serve from around the pan, but the middle was still not done.  The good news? Everyone loved it. It was time consuming, but I had help in the kitchen. I would make it again for a special occasion. We served it with steaks and Lemon Pepper Green Beans.

This was great as a side dish to steak.  I used fat free half-and-half, a parmesan/pecorino-romano blend, and only shiitake mushrooms (only because I did not have any other types of mushrooms).  The step involving boiling off the chicken broth from the mushrooms was surprisingly worth it as it added a layer of flavor to the dish.  Next time I may try light cream instead of heavy cream.

Yum, yum, yum.  I substituted baby bellas for the shitakes and it was so good.  Tastes even better next day.  Next time, i will bake the day before and reheat with a little more cream on top.

This was delish! My husband and I both went back for seconds. A few changes: I scaled the recipe to four servings. I didn't have rosemary and thyme, per se, so I added about 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning: rosemary, thyme, sage, marjoram, oregano, and savory. That was a good decision. I read that some cooks were having difficulties getting this to cook through in an hour and a half. Well. I cut my potatoes very thin, like some were translucent kind of thin. If some slices were thicker, I arranged them on the edges of the pan since they'll get baked more there. I also used a very shallow and wide casserole pan, which let it bake through in 1 hr 15 mins. I used 1 C heavy cream and 1/3 C milk, (my hubs and I are young and reasonably thin, still ;) ). I added three cloves of garlic. Great decision! We really, really enjoyed this--and we'll be making it again. :) Oh, and one comment: this doesn't have great eye-appeal, but it's delectable just the same!

I cut the recipe in half because I'm only cooking for two. I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I soaked in hot water for 30 mins, and fresh white mushrooms. I made exactly as written, except that I added a little butter after it was done. Very very good, will definitely make again.

This dish is outstanding! I made it for a New Year's Day brunch and everyone really enjoyed it. If you like mushrooms, you will love this. And if you like wine this is a dish for you, because the flavor compliments wine beautifully. I put the whole dish together the night before, and the day of my brunch all I had to do was put it in the oven. The only complaint I have is that it bubbled up so much while it was baking that it made a mess all over the bottom of my oven, so next time I will use a slightly larger pan than what is called for. There will definitely be a next time! Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's fantastic!

This was excellent! I used all button mushrooms, sliced, and double the amount of fresh rosemary, and it was so so SO good. I halved it for an 8x8 inch dish (small family), but will definetly be making this full-sized for company. Good good good. I'm so happy.

Really good!  Really, really, really good!!! I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I used less potatoes and didn't measure out anything except one cup of broth.   Also, I didn't have any cream so I substituted it for a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I basically just threw everything together here and it was fantastic!!!  Everyone loved it.  I tossed a bit of bread crumbs on top near the end to make it crispy.  YUM!!!

Delightful! The only things I changed were to use 2 cups of half & half instead of 1 cup of cream and 1 half & half and to toss in a handful of chopped green onions. 

A great recipe, and I can't wait to try it again!

I thought this was excellent. My grocery store didn't have shitake mushrooms, so I used all button musrooms. I also only used about half as many mushrooms as the recipe called for, and was a little worried I didn't have enough. But since mushrooms have quite a strong flavor, I thought it was just perfect. It was definitely more like a fabulous scalloped potato recipe than a mushroom recipe, but that's what I was hoping for. Served it the Grecian Pork Tenderloin also from this site, which is another one of our family favorites.

Wow, this was fabulous! I didn't change a thing, other than halving the recipe and using fresh herbs. I used a round French White casserole dish, I think it's a 2 quart capacity. I cooked it for an hour and a half. The flavors were fantastic, I will definitely be making this again, my fiance' loved it!

This was a big hit in my house.  I made a half recipe.  I used milk and half and half instead of cream.  I also used all button mushrooms instead of shitake because I had a hard time finding them in my local store.  It had so much flavor from the chicken stock infused mushrooms.  I will definitely make again.

This was great and will probably become a Holiday potato dish. I did not add any thyme or rosemary (not a fan of either of these spices) and only used half the recommend mushrooms (1 pre-sliced pack of baby bellas) and it was still delicious. Next time I will bake a little bit longer so it is crustier on top!

This dish was yummy! Just remember when cooking for a real vegetarian, we don't eat chicken or beef broth. I used vegy broth and it was delicious :)

Made this last year for Thanksgiving when relatives came into town.  My husband thought it ambitious to make and serve something I had never made - Well, these potatoes were one of the stars of dinner!
I was worried about the bake time since the bird was in the oven too and the temp was 25 degrees less. I compensated by placing them in the oven for 2 hours and 15 minutes at 350.
Can't wait to make them again this year!

I made this recipe for a church barbecue potluck on a Tuesday evening and people could not stop praising it. The pastor even complimented me again on the following Sunday! I added fresh basil and substituted Portobello mushrooms for the Shitakes. This is just the best!

Excellent recipe, but it is not appropriate for vegetarians as it contains chicken broth. You would need to change this to vegetable broth instead.

This is excellent tasting.  It passed my husband and father-in-law's critique as well.  They loved it!
I used a whole cube of butter instead of the 6 TB as the'shrooms really soak it up.
Also, instead of reducing the chicken stock until it disappears, I simmered the mushrooms in the stock for about 5-10 minutes then transfered them to the potatoes.  I made a sauce to go over our steaks with the reserved chicken stock and seasonings.  It was a very good use of the stock.  They liked that as well.  In all, quite a successful meal.

I loved this recipe.  I subsituted sweetpotatoes for the gold yukons.  It was so good. I used just regular white mushrooms and only 1 1/2lbs.  I don't know where you would put the rest.  This is great as leftovers.

I had to substitute baby portabellas for the shitake mushrooms, but I thought it was too bland with not much flavor.

Used white portobello mushrooms.Didn't use any cream. Top layer was sliced edam cheese sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Used a dessertspoon of butter cooking the mushrooms. The dish turned out delicious with a lot less cholestrol/fat.

Delicious!  Made it just as it said.  Used good parmesan that I grated and I think that made a difference.  Absolutely delicious...everyone wants the recipe!

My husband Loves Potatos and we all love Mushrooms.  This was great.  I did not have the thyme and I didn't put the called for amount of rosemary (didn't have it) and it was awesome.  This may even become a Thanksgiving and Christmas favorite.

I tried out this recipe for a small dinner party and it got rave reviews from everyone sitting at the table.  I used Cheddar instead of Parmesan, since this was what I had on hand, and used only sliced cremini instead of the mixture of regular and shiitake mushrooms as suggested in some previous reviews.  Very tasty!

Awesome, a hit every time I make it!  I change it up sometimes when shitake not available.  I add 1lb portabello and .5lb chimeron mushrooms instead.  I also will add .5 cup asiago cheese instead of parm.

This recipe was fantastic... I had a dinner party last night and the only bad thing is that my husband does not have any left overs.  I made some minor changes... I used all portabellas, light cream instead of heavy, and I used fat free half and half... this is definitely a keeper.

This was a very rich dish. It was also absolutely delicious! For the first layer of cheese I did thin cut gouda with grated romano, for the second layer of cheese I did feta and romano, and the top layer was just the romano. The mixture of the three cheeses was decadent. Family members who had already eaten elsewhere found themselves having seconds. I do wish I had added more shitake mushrooms, but other than that, this dish was a big hit!

I made this as a side dish with prime rib. It went very well together, but it was a little watery. I think next time, I'll add a little flour in the dairy liquids to make it a little thicker.

we loved this dish and when my husband says to make it again, then it's definitely a winner....I used peeled red potatoes and white mushrooms and shitakes....used only half and half because I didn't have heavy cream...and I cut the recipe in half since there's only 2 of us....it was delicious and flavorful....will definitely make it again!! YUMMY

I saw a few reviewers mentioned the gratin not baking up in time to serve.  This happened to me many years ago also.  The solution? After double checking the oven temp and location of the oven rack, make sure your potatoes are not 1. cut too thickly 2. there is enough liquid getting in between each layer of potatoes, and 3. the height of potatoes is not too high/deep/thick in the baking mold.  Just like pasta, potatoes require adequate moisture per dry solids vs size of pan and temperature to bake up properly.

To save time I used pre-sliced potatoes.  Scaled the recipe down to three servings.  Two would have been plenty for one dinner.  Used less butter and a combination of shiitakes and white mushrooms. For three servings, cooking time was one hour.  Served with a green salad and red wine.  Yummy vegetarian dinner.  Will definitely fix again.

I halved this recipe since there is only two of us and I did make one change. As others mentioned, shiitake's are expensive so instead of using the 12 ounces the halved recipe called for, I used 6 ounces and replaced the remaining 6 ounces with baby bella's. This turned out great! Very impressive and a must try for the mushroom lovers out there. If the dish you are using ends up being pretty full like mine was, I recommend putting a cookie sheet underneath to catch the overflow.

This has become one of my favorite foods on the planet. Have yet to make this without someone asking for the recipe. I use veggie broth and omit the rosemary and usually have to keep it in the oven closer to 1.5 hours.  Shiitakes are a must for that woodsy flavoring but I use a mix of baby bellas, cremini, and white button along with the shiitakes.  I make a half recipe in a 9 x9 dish just for me and eat it for a few days. It almost seems to get better each day. Yum!

So delicious!  I paired this dish with some lamb chops and it was the easy favorite.  I halved the recipe as it was only serving 2 of us and there were plenty of leftovers.  Otherwise, I followed it exactly as the recipe states.  I agree with all the reviews that it doesn't necessary look nice, but you can get past that very fast when you take the first bite!

I really liked this, but I kept thinking of all the cholestral as I was making it.  Some recipes can take substitutions, some can't...whenever I try something for the 1st time I always follow the exact ingredients.  But next time I will substitute for lighter versions of the creams.  And I won't always use the Shitake as it is very expensive.  All in all very good.
