I used frozen berries (because I wanted to omit the ice) and because I have a child with an allergy to lactose, I used a lactose-free milk in place of the nonfat dry milk powder. This was just okay. REALLY wet and it really didn't have much flavor. I'd like to try this again but maybe play with the ingredients a bit. It's missing something but I'm not sure what it is.

This did not turn out good for me. I ended up just pouring it down the sink. It needed some liquid to it, I think.

Berry good!  I subbed a peach for the nectarine and froze my strawberries and blueberries cutting down on the ice.  I also used skim milk and a little vanilla yogurt vs. dry milk powder which is something I typically don't have on hand....

I don't care for the flavor of nonfat milk and am allergic to soy.  I found a delicious way to make a similar smoothie.  Use 1/4 cup of vanilla lowfat yogurt and V8 splash fruit medley or tropical blend. blend with whatever frozen fruit you have.  I usually put blueberries and plums with the fruit medley, strawberries and peaches with the tropical blend.  Fabulous!

I found this utterly delicious.  I frequently add ice cubes instead of water; the crushed ice melts and makes the smoothie  more liquid while it chills it.
Sometimes when the flavors are concentrated enough I keep adding ice cubes until it has the texture of a 7-11 slurpee.

Good smoothie! I added 1/2 scoop of protein supplement. I think that it needed a little of soy milk to get to the right consistency.

I felt this had no flavor.  Despite all the blueberries, which usually are the dominant flavor when mixed with other stuff, it just tasted like a slightly blueberry-flavored milk.  (Like chocolate milk made very weak.)  I didn't taste nectarine at all.  I wonder if smoothies just go better when they have milk, yogurt or juice... something besides just fruit, cause the last one I made w/little liquid was very bland as well.  I added a bunch of juice concentrate to it to get some flavor.  And it badly needs some liquid.  I don't see why not just add some milk instead of just powder.  Because of the lack of liquid, it was also extremely difficult to blend.  If you scrape the sides a lot and blend forever, it does finally mix (and the ice turn to water), but it was difficult.  Sorry, won't be making again.

I make a similar smoothie every day but don't understand the need for the milk powder. I use a mix of frozen and fresh fruits and use fruit juice for the liquid. I never use ice because the frozen fruit adds all of the frozen parts needed and the smoothie doesn't get diluted by the melting ice. 

This can get expensive to make, so I buy the marked-down fruit at my local grocer and either use it fresh or freeze it. They sell big bags of bananas for $1.39. I keep out the freshest ones and peel and freeze the others. I've also found that papayas freeze well. 

I am a night eater and was gaining weight because I was eating ice cream in my sleep. Now, I make a blender full of smoothie every day and keep ice cream out of the house. I freeze the smoothie in different size contaiiners and eat it day and night. The weight issue is getting better, but the real surprise was how it made my skin look ten years younger. I try to use at least six different fruits when I can. Blend and enjoy!

7.21.18  Only change I made was substituting a peach for the nectarine, otherwise, followed the recipe.  I liked that all three fruits shared equally in the taste, but didn’t really care for the nonfat dry milk powder flavor.  Not sure how important that ingredient is, but I’ll try cutting that in half in the future so the fruit can be the star.
