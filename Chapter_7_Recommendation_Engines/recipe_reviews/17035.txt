Great and SIMPLE recipe. I used eggs instead of melted butter and baked the chicken on a jelly roll pan on a rack. Turned the chicken after 30 minutes and baked for 30 minutes longer. Could not have been more crisp or moist, even if I had soaked it in a brine fried it in oil.

Very yummy!  I made the following additions:  1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to potato flakes.  Sprinkle chicken (in pan) with salt, pepper, chicken seasoning.  Broil on high for final 8-10 minutes.  Everyone loved this, & I loved that it's not fried!

This chicken was pretty good! The only reason I didn't go with 5 starts was because I did add salt and pepper to the potato flakes (my only alteration) and without that, it would have been bland. Next time I may add a bit more seasonings too. This chicken comes out nice and crispy. I had the family pack of legs so I put 14 legs on one cookie sheet (and yes, there was enough butter and potato flakes to cover 14 legs with some to spare) and they were too crowded and didn't brown on the sides as much as I would have liked. My fault. Be sure to leave enough space between each leg so they can brown nicely. OH, AND BE SURE TO LINE YOUR COOKIE SHEET WITH FOIL FOR EASY CLEAN UP. That wasn't fun to was even though I used PAM. Thank, I will make again!!!

Very good!  I just added some paprika, onion powder, and chicken seasoning as well as the salt and pepper to the potato flakes before dipping the chicken in.  Also, used chicken strips instead of legs and cooked for about 30 minutes.  Used dairy free margarine- made a great wheat, egg, and dairy free meal for those of us who are allergic!

I loved it. I used garlic flavored potato flakes and added some italian seasoning (parsley, basil, oregano, etc) to the mixture. 
If you like your chicken extra crispy you can cook it on a regular pan (cookie sheet w/ edges). 
I will definately make this again.

Be careful not to overdo the potato flakes.  I think I got too much potato and it didn't crisp up quite right.  It might help to rotate the chicken during cooking to make sure that enough butter soaks into the potato flakes.  I added just a touch of the following spices for added flavor -- salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper and paprika.

Healthier - brush chicken with olive oil and then lightly roll in the potato flakes and it will turn out fabulous! Don't coat the potatos too thick it is crispier when it is a super light coat.

Good starter recipe. I recommend you add your favorite spices to the potato flakes before you coat your chicken legs in it. I like to add dry ranch seasoning mix or dry taco seasoning mix but it's good with whatever spices you want to throw in. If you want to cut the fat, you can also dip it in an egg wash or even buttermilk before coating it in the dry potato mixture.

Excellent base receipt: I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil, and modified the coating too; 1/2 buttery homestyle mash potato flakes & 1/2 panko bread crumbs, mixed in 2 different chicken spice (original + montreal), allspice, onion powder, garlic powder + salt.  Replaced 2 breast for 2 legs cut in half for my white meat lovers. Baked @ 355 for 25/30 minutes turning baking for another 15/20 and broil (on low) on each side for 5-7 minutes. very good, nice crunchy outside with juicy inside, even the breast!! Severed with mac-cheese & green beans. It's a keeper....

Instead of melted butter, I went with 1 egg, half a shot of spiced rum, about an ounce of canola oil, about an ounce of half & half, some beer, and some arrowroot to thicken things up. Stir with a fork in a 20 oz plastic disposable cup. Dunk a drumstick in, add beer until just the knee joint is showing, remove drumstick, remix with fork. 
I had some flour that was old enough the a baker friend of mine said would probably be horrible for baking cookies etc because it was too old. I added that to the instant garlic roasted mashed potatoes, (first time I have ever bought such a thing usually just buy potatoes & bake them). I mixed in some freshly grated Parmesan. I made several trips to the spice rack, dill seed & ground rosemary for sure, don't remember what else I tossed in there, my decisions at the spice rack tend to be spur of the moment. 
Dunk the drums in the wash, I put the potato etc mixture in a bit of Tupperware, I found I could get 2 drums in there at ounce, put the lid on and shook it like a cocktail shaker.
I had purchased the super gigantor 16 pack of drumsticks, and they wouldn't all fit on a half pan. So I pressed my largest cast iron skillet to carry the over flow. The half pan and the skillet would not fit on the same rack in my oven. So one went on the middle rack, and the other went on the rack a slot or 2 above it. Cooked for 25 minutes, turned them over, juxtaposed the skillet and pan from center to top rack. Cooked another 25 minutes. Sprinkled parm ontop

5-stars WITH SPICES.  I used liberal amounts of garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper.   The potatoes have a mild taste, so won't interfere much with any spice combo you like.

My main point in reviewing this recipe is to note that *parchment paper* really works well to keep the chicken and the coating from sticking to the (jelly roll) pan. Also, 1 stick of butter (not 2, as called for) is more than enough for 10 chicken legs.  Overall, this dish has a great flavor and texture payoff with very little effort.

Turned out pretty good. Need to keep extra toppics to throw on after flipping the chicken so it sticks on the other side as well.

I just made this tonight and it's absolutely WONDERFUL!! I, like most others, added my own love to it. I cut the fattest part of the chicken leg skin off the back of the leg but left most on. I put cajun seasoning, paprika, garlic grill shaker, and salt and pepper directly into the melted butter. I poured the butter/seasoning mixture on the plate the chicken legs were already on. I let them soak a few minutes while spooning mixture over top of legs and tried to get butter to go under skin and in meat. I rolled the legs in potatoes trying to keep the largest part of leg slightly upright so the butter would stay within the leg. A tad more seasoning on the top, then baked for 30 min. in foil lined pan on a baking rack. I was going to turn legs but turning makes the flakes come off. So I put the legs back in without turning. The chicken was moist, crispy, and delicious!! Tastes like fried, but without the guilt!

This does not crisp.  The potato flakes kind of separate from the chicken in your mouth and kind of makes its own mashed potato.  Does not have any flavor.  My family has requested we never make this again due to the potato coating this creates in their mouths.

Absolutely the best chicken I have ever tasted. And the absolute easiest! My son hates chicken, but when he saw the brown golden color on those pieces, he had to have one. When my daughter heard the crunchy sounds, she had to try them. The whole chicken disappeared before my eyes. I had to add spices and salt to the flakes though.

I'm always looking for recipes where I can control the amount of salt, fat and flavor. I can change this receipe any way I want depending on mood. I've added a range of different spices to change this recipe from Italian style, to Mexican, to "kid-friendly". If you start out with the basics, you can jazz it up or down.

I didn't have potato flakes on hand so I used Italian bread crumbs & seasoned my chicken with pepper, seasoning salt, onion powder, & garlic powder. I also put about 2 cups of chicken stock in the casserole dish. My family loved it  ??

I also give it a 4 only because there aren't any seasonings listed. I agree with CHRISCOOKING and DEFINITELY put foil down first it saves a lot of time. I added seasoning salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper in with the potato flakes and everyone LOVED it.

Delicious and crispy on the outside, still juicy on the inside!!!  I needed a way to use a bunch of chicken legs that have been frozen forever and I saw this on the list, and I'm sure glad that I did! Like others, I added in pepper, parmesan cheese, a little bit of cayenne pepper and some garlic powder.  I only used about a 1/3 cup butter and it was just enough.  2 cups of potato flakes was way too much, I wasted almost a cup I'd say.  Oven at 400 degrees, after 20 minutes I turned the legs and turned oven down to 350 because I was baking mac n cheese too. After 20 minutes, I followed another user's suggestion and I broiled the chicken alone for 5 minutes.  Overall cooking time about 50 min.

I made this tonight, and we really liked it.  I did add some seasonings, just a little parmesan, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika to the potato mix.  So easy and the chicken was juicy and tender! I'm glad I found this one, it's a keeper!

Turned out really good.  I sprinkled legs with salt and pepper and italian seasoning after rolling them in garlic potato flakes.  Turned the legs the last 5 mins and broiled to crisp up the underside.  Will try olive oil next time instead of butter to reduce fat.

This was pretty good.  I prefer my drumsticks grilled but we unexpectedly ran out of propane, I had a box of potato flakes sitting in the cupboard so this was Plan B.  I had already marinated them overnight in garlic, montreal, season salt and pepper so they had plenty of flavor.  I also added a little dried parsley to the potato flakes.

Used it with smaller chunks/nuggets of chicken.  Added salt and Italian seasonings.  Little boys liked it.  Very easy, though took some time to bread all the chunks.  Will probably use two Zip-lock bags next time, one for the butter and the other for the potato flakes.  Cooked for 12 minutes at 425.  I liked them too!

This was good, and I made changes that made it even better.  I used chicken tenders, and the baking time was 30 minutes.  Could also be good with chicken that was pounded scallopini style.  To the potato flakes, I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and a dash of chili powder.  Dipped in margarine.  Came out crispy and flavorful - and very easy.  Tastes similar to a lightly fried chicken.

This is a good "base" recipe. I used the Idahoan premium instant mashed potatoes and added my own seasonings: 1tsp McCormick Chicken Seasonings, 1/8 onion powder, 1/4 tsp Season All, 1/4 black pepper. Followed all other direction verbatim. Came out GREAT! My husband has always made better fried chicken. This recipe gives good competition to my husband's chicken and is sooooo much healthier! This is a keeper!

Very easy recipe.  I used only 5 chicken legs and removed the skin.  I noted from a previous review that the amount of butter and potato flakes was more than you need, so I melted a bit of butter at a time and brushed it on each leg instead of dipping (less waste).  I also added salt, garlic powder, paprika, and pepper to the potato flakes.  Baked for 30-40 minutes.  Also lined my baking pan with foil and sprayed with Pam for easy clean up and removal.  I turned the chicken once after 20 minutes to crisp both sides.  The chicken turned out fantastic!  My husband (the picky eater) had a second helping.  Thanks for posting!  I will definitely make this again.

OK, I know everyone said it was moist, but mine turned out just plain greasy with all the butter.  I found it to be very bland also.

This is such and easy and really great way to cook chicken. The chicken turned out so crispy and nicely browned, I just added some salt and pepper to the potato flakes. Next time I will do like others and try different seasonings. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was delicious!  I was a little worried that the chicken wouldn't have much flavor or that it would come out soggy, but it was full of flavor and very crispy!  The only thing different I did was to add a little jamaican jerk seasoning to give it a little kick.  I will definitly be making this again.

Solid recipe, but instead of dredging in butter,I dredged in one beaten egg heavily seasoned with garlic powder and poultry seasoning. I seasoned the mashed potatoes with garlic salt and a heavy dose of pepper, too. Cooking time is perfect, though I roasted on a rack and turned over halfway through cooking time -- I highly recommend doing the same. The coating was very light tasting and one I will use again for oven fried chicken.

I really liked this recipe, however after making this once, I took advice from other reviewers and made it again. I used butter, but mostly eggs. This made the chicken more crispy and it seemed like the potato flakes adhered better to the chicken. I broiled it the last 5-10 minutes. Again, the chicken was more crispy. I also mixed garlic powder and pepper with the flakes for more flavor. Great recipe overall and I will make it again. Thanks!

I I used eggs instead of melted butter 
I salt and peppered legs before coating.
I checked them at 30 minutes they looked almost done.
checked with a thermometer at 40 minutes temp was at 160 at that point.
So a hour would have been way too long.
Oh BTW I only made 4 legs so I sprinkled the chicked with the potatoe flakes  over a bowl then after I just heated up enough water for the flakes and made mashed potatoes. So no waste. also used the leftover egg and scrambles them.

I liked it fine (after adding spices) but the family wasn't crazy about it. The leftovers get pretty soggy in the fridge, so you really need to bake them again to crisp them up, which to me defeats the purpose of leftover night.

I followed other reviews for added flavor. I added my own touch of Italian seasoning. The chicken was good but not crispy enough. Will make again but may alter amount of potato flakes I use.

This recipe was good, but I did add seasonings as others suggested.  However, it didn't turn out as crispy as I would like.  Just a few notes:  I took all of the skin off of of my legs before dipping in butter.  I made 15 legs, and 1 stick of butter was still more than enough.  I brushed the butter on with a basting brush to make sure all surfaces were covered.  I added garlic salt and pepper to my potato flakes.  The chicken baked up golden brown and was a little bit crispy, not soggy at all, but I think the broiler would really crisp it up nice.  Also, I lined my pan with tin foil, and this helped immensely with clean up.

Very good baked chicken altho I regret to say that I was a bit heavy-handed with the garlic powder. I dumped the potato flakes, garlic powder, pepper and several other herbs and spices into a storage bag, melted 3/4 stick of butter for 6 legs, shook them in the bag and baked. I'll be making this again, tho.

this recipe was ok... i found that the oven temp and cooking time to be way too high & long - i put my chicken in for no more then 30mins and they came out crispy on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside, and the oven was on 325
...
also had to add my own seasonings (even though i used butter/herb potatoes...

might make it again ... and add even more extras....

I added lemon pepper, garlic salt, onion powder and paprika and it was still bland. Overall I would say the inside was ok but the outside was terrible. Noone at our house liked it. In fact 2 of the 4 of us only ate 1 or 2 bites. We had to invite over some uncles who eat anything to eat it so I didn't have to feel guilty about throwing it away.

I followed the lead of other members and added a few extras.  I used two eggs to coat, then potato flakes, paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper and parm cheese.  The flavor was simple.  I may add something to spice it up next time. Also, Ii didn't brown as well as I had hoped, but maybe I was being impatient!!

I followed the recipe with the suggestions of spices and egg instead of butter, but I was not as pleased as everyone else seemed to be.  thought it was still bland even with spice addition.  the potato flakes didn't cover the chicken well and honestly still tasted like potato flakes from the box after being cooked.

Tasty recipe. My cousin, such a finicky eater that I needed to abandon most of my recipes, ate 3 large legs!  I'm giving this only a 3 as with butter the flakes didn't stick too well and it ended up crunchy in some parts and overly greasy in others. It also would have been a bit too bland had I not added salt and pepper to the flakes. I'm going to try this again someday with an egg instead and we'll see how it goes.

wow is the flavor good on these.  I used one of those bags of potatoe flakes that you get for a buck each.  It had great flavor so no need for salt.  I did add parmesan cheese.  I did think the temp was too high, so lowered it at the start.

Excellent with Idahoan flavored mashed potatoes.  They are less flakey, more powdery, so they give a nice texture.  I used loaded baked potato flavor.

This is a great recipe.  I have found it is best to use the flavored mashed potatoes.  The four cheese Idahoan brand goes really well with this one.  I also add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne to it to give it a little kick.

I made this last night for supper, and my twin 9 year old girls really liked it!!  I added some seasonings, and Parmesan cheese as suggested by another user.  I also found it to be a good idea to turn the chicken half way through. I will definitely be making this again!!

Deliciously golden brown and crispy; the family loved it.  I used egg rather than butter.  I added grill mate pepper, a dash of hot sauce, and oregano. Will make it again for sure.

My kids loved this! I made a few changes such as- (1) I used melted butter AND egg to dip the chicken in.  (2) I added seasoning to the potato flakes. (3) I added a little bit of melted butter to the bottom of the pan to help the chicken get crispy. (4) I drizzled a little bit of melted butter on top of the chicken before putting it into the oven. 
I will definitely be making this again!!

It was good but had a lot of melted butter left over so I added more flakes and poured the butter over the flakes and chicken. Turn out nice and crispy.

I'm always looking for a tasty way to get Fried Chicken without frying. After reading the other reviews here, I opted to brush the chicken in olive oil; however I had some Rosemary flavored olive oil. I lightly rolled the chicken legs in the instant potato flakes and baked for 30 minutes @ 400. I did use the stick free foil, which make it unnecessary to flip the legs. They came out crispy and the touch of Rosemary added a delicious twist - plus the foil made it mess free! Next time, I'm trying the cheddar or "Loaded" instant potatoes!

This is very simple and fast recipe. If you are looking to add a little zing to your chicken try what I did. Add 1 pkg dry ranch to the potatoes. I rolled my chicken in the better then the potatoes then in buttermilk and back into the potatoes. I continued with the recipe as is. My family loved it!!!

I loved how easy this recipe was!  I did make some changes... I rolled legs in flour first and then dipped in an egg wash.  I put a package of 4 cheese instant potato flakes, 1/2 cup of Italian panko breadcrumbs, and 1/4 cup Kraft Parmesan grated cheese in a 1 gallon zip lock back and shook 2 legs at a time until coated well  I then placed the legs on parchment paper to cook.  I let the legs stand for 10 minutes after I took them out of the oven.  The legs were unbelievably juicy and tender.. I will be making again and again!!

Love the simplicity of the recipe, especially because I had everything on hand. the only concern I had was that it was too much butter and potato flakes. So I drizzled the extra butter over the chicken legs and added more flakes on top. I also turned them half way through. turned out pretty good, will make again but with some other spices and less flakes. Thanks for the recipe.

It's easy when you don't have a lot of ingredients in the house to work with, I added Parmesean cheese and just a little bit of garlic powder into the butter with ofcourse salt and pepper amazing ! My family are picky eaters but they do like this!

The nice thing about this recipe is that you can use the potato flakes as a base and season it however you'd like.  Try something new and derive a favorite.  Parmesan and Italian Seasoning is good.  I've also used a bit of cayenne for a change and there's always the standard, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.   It comes out crispier if you use a cookie sheet.  You definitely need to line the pans with foil unless you enjoy scrubbing them afterwards.  As for the cooking spray.  I used to always use it, but I forgot it once and found that without it the pieces didn't stick near as badly as they did with it, so I don't use it anymore.  Thanks for sharing, Krissy.  It's a whole lot easier than frying and just as yummy.

Nice idea, not much flavor. The chicken legs I used were rather large, so I baked them for 1.5 hours but they came out looking delicious. I added parmesean, garlic salt, parsley and minced onions to the flakes, and still used a little salt afterwards. Simple staple.

I used butter and herb flavored potato flakes and it was delicious. I really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again for sure. My kids are pretty picky eaters and they were begging for more.

This chicken was awesome and oh so EASY! I used olive oil instead of butter and seasoned the chicken with Morton's Nature's Seasoning (my favorite seasoning blend of all time!) I then added garlic and onion powder to the potatoe flakes as well as paprika. Came out crisp on the outside and oh so juicy on the inside! AND my kids obsolutley LOVED it and  now I have to make this at least once a week! LOL!

It was good but very greasy with all the butter. I'll make it again but experiment with other ways to make it. I also added the spices I usually put on my chicken dishes.

I tried this recipe last night and I loved it. I only used half of the potato flakes. I also seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and basil. The girls loved it. Don't forget to turn it over after 30 minutes.

Very good.  The crisp was panko-like.  I added spices to the potatoes.  I made sure the pieces baked with a little bit of space between them.  Yum.

Very good and so easy.  I cut the butter in half and added salt / pepper / TexJoy seasoning to the flakes.  Much healthier than frying in oil plus I didn't have to stand over the stove while they cooked!

I came online today looking for a simple recipe for chicken legs, and I found it. Krissy the recipe was perfect. My husband and I both loved it. Now that I am a stay at home wife I don't use instant mashed potatoes anymore and I thought I would end up throwing them out. What a perfect way to use them. All I did was salt and pepper and it was great.

Easy prep!!  I added some minced garlic to the butter when I melted it to give it a little more flavor, and also added some Mrs. Dash and parmesan/romano cheese to the 'taters.  Came out so juicy and crispy!  Husband said it was great!  Will make again for the in-laws :)

Definitely add some seasoning and parm. Overall, easy and different than the same old chicken. I did a few pieces with no butter or egg and they didn't brown as well. They tasted fine, but I think the butter gives a little flavor and seals juices in a little more. I don't use much, maybe two TBSP for eight tenders/drumsticks.

This was good.  My bf and I liked it a lot.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and instant mashed potatoes (because I thought they'd be flakes, but the were pellets, so I put them in the food processor until fine) and added some random spices from the spice cabinet.  I also used an egg instead of the butter.  I loved the way they turned out.  The tops were crispy and the bottoms had a layer of mashed potatoes.  Mmm...  Very good.

I used garlic flavored potatoes.  The whole family enjoyed this.  It was tender and flavorful.  The tater coating does get crisp, but not crunchy.  It is a softer texture from what we are used to, but that is perhaps because I removed the skin of the chicken since I was slathering the bird with butter.

This is either a hit or a miss kind of recipe. Unfortunately it was a miss for me. I added salt, pepper, chili powder, paprika, and onion powder and it still didn't taste that great. Its hard to not burn the potato layer since I had huge chicken legs for this recipe. I don't think I would try this again.

Pretty good. I've made a few different kinds of oven baked chicken before and this is one of the better ones. Of course it's never as good as the real thing but you can't really expect it to be. Overall though if you add your favorite spices which is a must then this turns out to be very good. Both of my kids ate it which in my house is really saying something!

I have used this recipe several times and I love it! The first few times it was with the chicken legs, then I tried it with boneless skinless chicken breast halves and with thighs too. Then I went and got adventurous and bought a whole chicken and cut it up myself and used this recipe for all 8 pieces! I do add various seasonings to the potatoe flakes and sometimes I use egg instead of the melted butter, but those are all just personal prefferences. Thank you for sharing this meal idea with everyone!!

Tried this last night b/c I had all the ingredients in my house already. It was very tasty! Added some garlic powder to the mashed potatoes (which were seasoned only with butter), and it was very good. 

I recommend turning t he chicken pieces about halfway through so all sides can crisp up!

My daughter who is a big fried chicken fan, wasn't all that thrilled with this.

Really easy to make and modify. I went a little light on the seasonings (onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and pepper in the margarine and parsley in the flakes) and will amp it up next time around. Super crispy chicken that I could hear "frying" as it baked in the oven.

I loved this chicken. The coating is yummy and comes out brown and crispy. It is so simple, the only change I made was that I used half soft margarine and half oil instead of butter because that is what I had on hand and it still was fantastic! I can't wait to make it again, I may need to cook more legs next time.

My family loved this. I gave it 4*'s because I did add a lot of seasonings which turned it into a 5*!  I added garlic to the butter, paprika, onion powder, pepper, & parsly to the potato flake mixture. This came out crispy and moist. Loved that it is dairy & wheat free and delicious!

This was good, even the picky kids liked it :)  I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder just to give it some flavor.  Very good; will use again.

Very good recipe.  No need to change a thing.  Daughter is a very picky eater, and she asks for this at least once a week now.  Is awesome served with homemade mac and cheese.
