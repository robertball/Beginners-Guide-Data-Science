Wow, what a pie! Easy to make and fun, too. It will satisfy your sweet tooth, that's for sure. Used frozen s'berries rather than fresh. While berries partially thawed (30 minutes the most), I mixed the egg, brown/white sugars with sour cream and whole wheat flour. Let mix stand while slicing s'berries - cut each in half then sliced vertically. Laid s'berries in a GRAHAM CRACKER unbaked pie shell then covered with mix. Pie shell was full so I put cookie sheet under pie to prevent overflow in oven. Had a problem with the topping - too runny. Added 3 tablespoons of whole wheat flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring after each addition. By the 3rd spoon, mixture resembled course meal. Baked as directed. Three hours after pie cooled on the counter, my tastebuds were begging for a piece to eat. Pie was good and crunchy! A little too sweet for me. Put in the refrigerator overnight and discovered the pie is not as sweet as earlier. Next time I'll try using Splenda or Apriva sugars. Enjoy!

Great idea and execution for a pie! Following the instructions, it was delectable! I would definitely not use a graham cracker crust as the first reviewer suggested. The sweetness of the filling needs a more savory, buttery foundation. Go ahead and reduce the sugar a bit if you don't have too much of a sweet tooth. I will be making this again!

This pie was way, way too sweet for my taste (even after sitting overnight in the fridge as another reviewer suggested).  I won't be making this pie again.

Used 1/2 cup sour cream (that’s all I had) and 1/2 cup powdered sugar (didn’t have granulated). Forgot about it and left in 15 minutes longer than Instructed, So topping was a little crispier than the picture, but in any event it was a very good pie!.....Easy to make and was not too sweet in my opinion. Will make this pie again.

This was a big hit.  The only alteration I made was using splenda and sugar free brown sugar as well as using mixed berries (black, blue, straw, etc.) Great stuff. Thank you.

absolutely good!!! easy as pie really, a trifle on the sweet side, but altogether a great ecipe, a bit different from the pie based on simple fruit. The strawberries and the yogurt (I used it instead of sour cream, and light yogurt at that) and the whole wheat floor make it worth to be labeled healthy... there's almost no butter in the batter, after all. I also had a puff pastry crust, left over from another recipe, and it worked absolutely beautifully. I guess you can substitute strawberries with any berries you like. Only little drawback, I've seen prettier pies. A keeper anyway!!
