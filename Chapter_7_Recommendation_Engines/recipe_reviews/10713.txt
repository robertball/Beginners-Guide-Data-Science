In my circles this is the favorite cookie.  They're delicious and stay moist & chewy for up to a week (if they last that long).  I make mine with walnuts and bake them on non greased non stick pans and they turn out great every time.  One tip make sure your butter/margerine is well softened and add the condensed milk a little at a time.

This is the BEST chocolate chip cookie ever if you leave out the coconut and the pecans!! Make sure to put the dough in the refrigerator to harder before baking though or you will have flat pancake cookies. This is the only cookie I make now.

I made these cookies and they were good. If you have a food processor I put graham crackers (1 pkg)flour baking powder and a cold stick of butter and blended until every thing was mixed and crumbly. I then added the nuts for a few pulses. I added this mix to a large bowl with coconut, chips and the can of sweet and condensed milk. Not melting the butter kept the cookies from going flat.

I personally did not like these cookies as I'm not a huge coconut fan but my roommates and co-workers all loved them.  They stayed fresh for the 3 days they were around.  I had trouble with them burning on the edges so I'm not sure how to alleviate that.   A quick breakdown to save some people time... 1 cup of the graham crackers was equal to 5 full graham crackers crunched up.

Good! I used soft butter (not melted) and skipped the coconut. Very easy to make, soft yummy cookies, but not flat. Will definitely make again!

Very awesome! Ooey gooey goodness! My oven bakes a bit hot, so I turned the heat down to 355 for 8 minutes or so. I highly recommend not spraying the cookie sheet first. There's really no need with that much butter.

Not my favourite cookie by any means. The dough was very sticky and difficult to work with and the cookies turned out quite hard once they had cooled. They are not as sweet as other cookies which is not necessarily bad, just different.

I have made these more times than I can count they are always delicious and moist.  Easy to make with common ingredients.  I highly recommend you try this at least once, it'll be one of your favorites after the first time.

These were good - similar to a chocolate chip cookie, but just with a little twist.  I like that it made 5 dozen.  Plenty to go around.

I loved how easy these were to make. They did spread out a bit, so do make them teaspoon size drops, on parchment paper. I cooked them for 12 min. and they still didn't look done, so i let them sit on pan for a few minutes. They were crispy, chewy and chocolatey. I enjoyed the textures in this cookie and it wasn't too sweet.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were a big hit with my coworkers and also with the church social hour crowd.  I made one batch as the recipe is written and it is definitely a keeper!  I made a second, double batch and added  a package of butterscotch morsels and a package of peanut butter morsels so the cookie tasted like a Magic Layer/Hello Dolly-type cookie.  Treasure Cookies are a delicious base cookie to tweak to your personal preferences.  I will use this recipe often.

Meh. Overrated. All of the flavors don't gel that well. And the edges of the cookies burn even if you shorten the bake time.

Sooo good! Really different than any other cookie that I have made. I liked the combination of chocolate, coconut and pecans. I followed the recipe as written. I had a hard time with them sticking to the baking sheet and used a Silpat,,,,,works like a charm!

These are amazing! They are easy to make and taste great! I usually add toffee bits to the recipe just because I have a bunch in the pantry.

These cookies are delicious!! The only thing I did different to the recipe was add walnuts in place of pecans, because I do not care for pecans that much. Overall the cookies came out great!!

I was so bored and hungry for somthing sweet, that I decided to give it a shot and turn these 'treasure cookies' into some 'trash cookies'.  You know...when you don't want to go to the store so you just start substituting stuff?  I didn't have any coconut or chocolate chips, so I chopped up some chocolate bars and caramels...I only had a few pecans and about 10 oz of sweetened condensed milk...HOLY cow...those cookies were AMAZING!  I had to cook them for about 15 minutes and some of them weren't good looking, but my stomach didn't care.  Remember, one man's trash IS another man's treasure!  Thanks for the base recipe. YUM!

Lovely cookie! I chose it because I needed cookies for Sunday at church, and had no eggs on hand. I used the smallest Pampered Chef scoop, and the recipe made 7 dozen cookies. A great combination of crisp and rich. I will make this again. Only substitution I made was walnuts instead of pecans.

One of the best cookies I have ever made and soooo simple.  My husband, who is very picky, couldn't stop eating them and my kids want me to make them for school when they have their next party.  Thank you for the simple, fun and delicious cookie!

I clipped this magazine from a recipe about ten years ago.  These cookies are so simple to throw together, and the results are out of this world.  They are super sweet and rich, but I wouldn't want them any other way.  If you like Magic Cookie Bars, you'll love these chocolatey, chewy cookies.

These were good, different. There was so many chocolate chips in it, compared to batter, that I had a hard time getting them to stick together. They were good though.

EH, these were just OK for me and my family. We are about to move and I had leftover chocolate, graham crumbs and coconut flake that I wanted to get rid of and this was the only recipe that matched those ingredients. I added a little almond extract to the dough as well. There was not enough moisture in the dough to "drop" the cookies, so I added about a 1/4 c. applesauce to moisten them up. Dough was still very stiff so I rolled them into balls and smashed onto baking sheet much like you would a peanut butter or snicker doodle cookie. They came out looking great and smelled wonderful, but the flavor was just alright. Not really our kind of taste I guess. Maybe it was the quality of my ingredients?

So I didn't use the pecans and instead, I did a cup of chocolate chips, 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips, and about 3/4 cup of the coconut flakes. Highly recommend.

Love this recipe.  Always a hit.  I like using the mini chocolate chips so they disperse more equally.  And letting the batter sit in the fridge a while is a must!

Great recipe and very delicious!  I used cold butter and a food processor so the cookies wouldn't go flat, as well as using 1/2 hazelnuts and 1/2 pecans. I found that 375 was too hot. I lowered the temp to 350 for 12-14 minutes and they came out perfectly.

The only thing I changed like someone before me was that I used soft butter instead of melted. These were very delicious.  So rich with taste you only need one, but of course you go back for another.

These cookies were great!  After reading the reviews, I increased the graham crackers by 1/2 cup.  They are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Very nice, yummy  combination, graham crackers,  coconut, chocolate chips and pecans!!

As far as texture, the cookie base is soft in the middle and crispy on the outside.  Amazing.  The coconut makes a weird texture in this recipe tho.  I like coconut, but will leave it out next time.  I reduced the add-ins and added pretzels and potato chips as well as adding a pinch of instant coffee to the butter/milk blend.  So tasty!  Also, I had most of them hold a good cookie shape while ONE spread out like a pancake.  Ive no idea as to why that happened so I can't advise.  In addition, I thought the teaspoon bit was silly so I used my usual ice cream scoop.

I made it as instructed and it was not very good. I substituted almonds for the pecans (just didn't have pecans). The mix was very sticky before baking. The caramel-ly cookie at the end, assuming this was from the condensed mild, did not go well with the graham blend. Maybe a little saltiness would help?

I had made this recipe several times over the past few years. In the past two weeks I had to make it three times because they didn't last at home and all my coworkers kept asking me to make more. The only change I made is the amount of chocolate chips I used. I only used 1.5 cups and once I scooped the dough onto the cooking sheet I placed the tray in the fridge for 5 mins so the cookies can retain a good shape and not go flat. Thank you for the recipe. This is a home favorite!!!!

I first tried this recipe when I wanted to make cookies, but I had no eggs in the house.  My kids loved it!  One of my daughters only likes chewy cookies so this recipe is perfect for her.  My only complaint is that I have never gotten 5 dozen cookies from this recipe.  I use the medium size Pampered Chef scoop to scoop the dough and that gives me about 3 1/2 dozen average-size cookies.  But, it's a great recipe and I make it often!

I usually don't write reviews but these were exceptional!!  And compared too other cookies they are pretty healthy to which is a nice bonus!  I had about 4 dozen cookies (make mine pretty big) and a group of 16 had them gone in 5 hours!

I have also added raisins instead of chocolate chips....adding a little extra flour has helped with the dough being so sticky.
Family and kids really like these cookies

This was a pretty good recipe.  Instead of putting the coconut in, I put in white choc. chips and butterscotch chips, along with the semisweet.  They turned out and tasted good, but they were kind of hard and flat.
