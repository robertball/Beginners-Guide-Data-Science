My sister and I made this together when I was visiting her one weekend, and it was very good.  My daughter, who can be picky, ate two helpings.  We didn't bother with the cornstarch; we just served it with the sauce it was cooked in over rice, and it was great.

The entire family rated this one as average.  I did not use the cornstarch but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I will not make it again.

Excellent meal!  Would definitely make again.  As the previous review stated, I also didn't use the corn starch.  I didn't have any rosemary so I eliminated it.  Quick and easy to prepare.
