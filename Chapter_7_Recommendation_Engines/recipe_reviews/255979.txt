Will definitely make again.  I made my own sausage gravy, added an additional egg and used baguette bread instead of sliced.  It turned out great!  The bread turned out like crispy bread and made the dish more hearty.  I sliced the baguette and then cubed as directed.  I spooned a small amount of melted butter on each piece of bread.  Teenagers loved it too.  I baked the night before.  Reheats really well.

I made this for my husband this morning and it has now become my new favorite breakfast! Full disclosure: I used refrigerated biscuits cut up into fourths instead of bread, layered them with hot sausage, flavored the egg/cheese mixture with salt, pepper, and a wee bit of hot sauce (personal preference!), and topped with black pepper gravy mix. It was SO flavorful.

This will be so perfect for when family is visiting. Thank you!!

My family and I loved this! I ended up making homemade sausage gravy as I didn’t have the packet of gravy mix. Still turned out great! Next time I’m going to add about 4 more eggs and more bread cubes to the top.

This has become our official Easter AM egg bake as everyone loves it. I used green onions and I added more eggs. Note: It feeds more people that it appears to.

My Family loved this casserole.  I've made it twice in the past week.  My son is Autistic and has seizures so we stay away from food dyes and colorings.  I didn't have white shredded cheddar for I subbed white American slices.  I used a pound if bulk breakfast sausage that I used the day before for Breakfast Burritos.  Topped with the cheese slices.  I used a couple extra eggs in the mix.  I have to admit I wanted to finish off the carton of milk so I swapped milk and water.  I reserved about 1 cup of the batter mix and after I placed the bread squares on top, I poured the last of the egg batter on top.  Sealed it off and put it in the fridge for the next morning!  Clean plates all around!

This was good. I was afraid the bread would be dry because I had French bread, so I poured the egg/gravy mixture over it rather than under it. I think it might be even better with a few more eggs and mixed all together rather than in layers, but we liked it and I'll definitely make it again.
