I attempted this recipe because it sounded quick, easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.This was a hit with my family; husband and five kids. It was light, healthy and low in fat and calories and I only needed one pan. In addition to the garlic, I added a shallot and a half cup of white wine. French style green beans in the can had to suffice because I didn't have frozen ones. I served it with a Sporodoro pasta and hot French bread.There wasn't a drop left over. Because it was so easy and it's healthy, I look forward to serving it again. Thank you, Nicole.

I ended up seasoning the chicken a bit more liberally than the recipe called for, using garlic powder, dried basil, oregano, salt and pepper.  I also added a bit more of these seasonings to the finished dish as it simmered.  Other than that, this dish was FANTASTIC!  I served it with rice and my husband could not stop raving about how good it was.

This was delicious!! I didn't have Italian seasoning,so I added dashes of oregano,basil and garlic salt.I also added another clove of garlic!Instead of stewed tomatoes,I added two cans of diced tomato(roasted garlic flavor)I was going to add the green beans,but didn't have enough room*LOL* it didn't need it! It goes perfect with the garlic penne pasta recipe on this website.YUM!

I made this chicken dish for dinner last night, and I thought it was a little too spicy.  I will try this recipe again, but with half the red pepper flakes.

I cut two large boneless skinless breasts into chunks and subbed a 28oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes (I HATE stewed tomatoes).  Yummy, quick and healthy.  Very good over rice.

I enjoyed this dish.  I did some additional seasoning with basil, oregano, and garlic salt.  I also used canned green beans and diced tomatoes since that was what I had on hand.  It still turned out great though!

I dredged the chicken in flour before sauteing it, which gave it a nice texture. This dinner was decent - not amazing but a good easy, pretty healthy standby, esp. for using up frozen green beans.

Pretty good! This is a good low-fat/healthy meal, especially when you are dieting! I scaled this for 2 people and cut up the chicken breasts into bite-sized chunks. I served it over pasta and let it "rest" for a few minutes to let the juices soak in to the pasta some. Hubby loves cayenne pepper on everything, so he added a bunch to his plate (maybe an option for others to try...)

I made this for supper last night and it was delicious! It was so easy to put together and the flavors were wonderful.  I think next time, I'll dice up some potatoes, and throw those in just as an added flaw!

Cut chicken into bite size pieces and used 2 cans of chopped tomatoes that already had Italian seasoning in them. Served with brown rice. Really good and easy. Would make again!

Definitely not a five star, but this was very healthy and super simple!  I used canned french cut green beans (no salt added), and I also added mushrooms.  I used tons of seasoning garlic powder, garlic cloves and basil.

My family loved this recipe - even my husband who is a very picky eater! The red pepper really makes this dish tasty. I didn't have Italian seasoning so I used a pinch each of basil, oregano, rosemary, parsley and thyme. I used canned green beans since I didn't have frozen and put them in for the last five minutes so they wouldn't get mushy. GREAT RECIPE!

Excellent and easy recipe. I seasoned according to my family's taste. I used one can of regular stewed tomatoes and one can of Mexican style stewed tomatoes for additional flavor. I broke up the tomatoes with a fork when cooking. I added zucchini and squash with the string beans which was a great addition and served with yellow rice. Sauce would be excellent over pasta as well. A definite KEEPER!

Average. Looked nice but I was expecting more. Added a bit of red wine to the sauce. I didn't use the green beans and served over pasta.

This was pretty good. I doubled the garlic and italian seasoning and I wish I had left the red pepper out. I used fresh green beans instead of frozen, and I served it with garlic bread.

I have been using this recipe for about a year now. All my family love it. The only change I made, was that I added oregano, and used canned green beans. Delicious.

I cooked this last night.  It was just ok, it probably would have come out better if there were some stronger spices and using thinner chicken breast (I think someone else mentioned using chicken tenderloins).  Mine come out kinda bland.  I will make it again, using smaller chicken portions.

Thought this was good and easy!  Used canned green beans instead of frozen, and added some white wine as another reviewer suggested. Also cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces and served over white rice.  The red pepper flakes added a nice kick-this would probably be bland without them.  Great gluten-free recipe!

This was a lovely surprise!  Quick, easy and amazingly delicious.  I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces to absorb more flavour and served it over pasta with chopped parsley and a few Parmesan shavings.

Edible but needs a lot of tweaking before it would become a repeat in our household. The chicken was not very flavorful at all.

We didn't like the strong flavor of the Italian Seasoning or the stewed tomatoes.  It did have a lot of flavor, next time I will try diced tomatoes and different herbs.

This was a quick and easy new way of cooking chicken that used ingedients that I had on hand.  I liked it, but it was a little too spicy for my taste (I'm pregnant and should have known it would give me heartburn).  Next time I will reduce the red pepper flakes.

It's almost insultingly quick and easy to make this! It's even easier to change the recipe enough to add variation. Play around with spices, add different veggies, whatever you want. My boyfriend is such a picky eater and he actually asked that I make this more often!  Edit: I just want to add 2 years later that this has become my fallback dish. No time to cook but I still want something healthy and tasty? This is it! I'm making it right now actually!

Very nice. I added a few things, though, which I don't usually do the first time I try a recipe (especially if I'm planning on reviewing), but I'll mention the changes anyway. First, I sliced the chicken into stir-fry type strips and cooked that in the oil and garlic with a couple of splashes of white wine and lemon juice. The smaller chicken pieces cut the cooking time considerably.  Also, I added a can of drained mushrooms with the beans. We loved the meal.Thanks.

This was so easy and good. Also very healthy! I didn't have any frozen green beans so I used green peas instead and it was delicious especially with a little Parmesan cheese sprinkled over it.

Oh my!  This was delicious!  Didn't use the green beans as I had none on hand.  Used regular 28 oz can of tomatoes. Since I didnt have real garlic I sprinkled both sides of the chicken with garlic powder as I did with the salt and pepper.  Didnt use chili flakes but used oregano instead.  To serve, I removed the breasts to a serving platter and mixed the pasta into the sauce remaining in the skillet. Can't wait to make this again!

This was so easy and really tasty. I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes and added sautéed onions, yellow peppers and celery, plus a pinch of Splenda. I used fresh haricot vert in place of frozen green beans and they cooked perfectly in the mix.  This is a keeper.

WOW! I wasn't sure what to expect of this recipe, but it turned out fabulous! I didn't have whole breast of chicken, so I used tenders, and a big can of diced tomatoes rather than stewed, but otherwise I followed it to the letter, and it was amazing! I just ate the leftovers for lunch, and even reheated, it's great! The chicken was nice and tender, not dry at all, and the sauce wasn't too tomatoey. Even my 11 year old, who really doesn't care for green beans, loved this! My husband and boys cleaned their plates. And when I asked if it was a repeat, I got a unanimous "YES!" from everyone!

This is an easy recipe and healthy also.  My husband loved it the first time I made it - the second time I prepared it in the slow cooker and it turned out wonderful also.  I served it with rice and presto - dinner!  Thanks!

While this was good, both my husband and I felt it was lacking something--but we don't know what.  It gets a plus for ease of preparation, but I probably won't make it again.

This is very easy, quick, and tasty.  And only one pot to clean - yay!  I made the recipe with the following changes and it still came out great:  I used canned beans b/c I didn't have any frozen, and 3 tomatoes I chopped up myself b/c I didn't have any stewed.  I also added about 1/2 c of white wine to the skillet during simmering.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks Nicole for a great recipe!

This meal was a hit with the entire family.  Quick & easy too!  I didn't have any frozen green beans, so I just used canned green beans and it came out great.  I will definitely use this recipe in my regular rotation of meals.

Just our family's preference, but we found it too bland.  It was quick, easy and very appetizing looking with the contrast of the red tomatoes (I used a can of diced tomatoes)and green beans.  Everybody ate it, but it is not a repeat for us.

My version turned out dominated by the tomato, using the amounts given.  I think I could definitely have worked another chicken breast into the recipe.  I also used fresh green beans rather than frozen, and olive oil rather than the vegetable oil called for in the recipe.  I also drizzled some olive oil over the top (about a tablespoon) right before serving. I didn't have "Italian spices" so I went with oregano and basil.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it and it was delicious!  The second time I made it, I was too lazy to look up the recipe again so I just put on my own seasonings and prepared it the same from there.  Still good!  Super simple and very flavorful.

This was a pretty good recipe. I did make a few modifications, which I thought enhanced the dish. I essentially coated both sides of my chicken with italian seasoning, since I love seasoning. I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I substitutued fire-roasted tomatoes instead. I also topped it with parmesan cheese before eating. Delicious!

Great recipe!!! My whole family loved it!!! I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and half of the amount of crushed red pepper. I served it over penne pasta with Parmesan cheese on top. My son said it was one of the best things I ever made!!

My wife and daughter loved this recipe. I only made a couple of minor changes. I used garlic powder instead of garlic. And, I used Del Monte's Italian Recipe Stewed tomatoes. Because of this, I cut back slightly on the Italian Seasoning and the garlic. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Recipe was easy and delicious. I cut red pepper flakes in half and cooked fresh green beans seperately, then served chicken with tomatoes over white rice with crisply cooked green beans on the side. A memorable meal with little work.

For something so simple, it tasted great. I served with rice seasoned with butter and Montreal Chicken Seasoning. Next time I'll try not draining the tomatoes and maybe get more sauce.

This recipe was fast, flavorful and healthy. After reading some other reviews I decided to add some additional spices. My fiance is a huge fan of spices and herbs and the more "notes" added to a dish, the better in his opinion. I used minced garlic, basil and oregano and substitued the red pepper flakes for a small amount of cayenne pepper. The meal had the right amount of kick and we both loved it. I served brown rice on the side that was flavored with a small amount of butter and salt and a ton of fresh basil. He normally does not like rice because it is "bland and boring" but he said that if rice always tasted like this he would eat it all the time! This dish has definitely earned a spot in our rotation.
