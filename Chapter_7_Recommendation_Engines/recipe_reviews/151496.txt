I have been making these for over 30 years as well.  Word to the wise:  only use smuckers caramel topping!! It spreads better than any other topping available.  Also, it is better if you melt the butter on top of the stove rather than in the microwave:  microwaved butter makes the batter too goey to crumble or spread.  Wonderful recipe!!  My coworkers and family fight over the last piece!!

For those of you who are calorie conscious like me... I wanted to let you know that I reduced the brown sugar to one cup and only used 1/2 c. butter, which I replaced the the other 1/2 c. with applesauce.  A little stickier to work with but was still very delicious!

I would give these 10 stars if I could. This is the third time making these in 3 weeks, and each time, they came out AWESOME!! I will only use this recipe.. by far, it beats others I've tried. I'm not sure what the reviewer below me means "too much butter". The chocolate chips measurement is the perfect amount, and do taste mostly caramel. I love that this is a soft bar, because other caramel bar recipes are too hard on the teeth. I'm hooked, I'll be baking these during the holidays!

These were excellent.  So easy to make.  Next time I will add more chocolate chips and maybe try adding some coconut.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

Yum! These are very good! I only used 1 cup of butter and didn't miss the rest. I used old-fashioned oats because that's what I had on hand and they worked just fine. Thanks. :)

I have been making these for 30 years.  My kids grew up on this recipe and it is awesome. I use a 17 oz jar of Mrs. Richardson's butterscotch carmel topping instead of Smuckers and a whole 12 oz bag of chocolate chips instead of 6 oz. Be sure not to over mix the oatmeal mixture or it will turn to one big glob making it impossible to sprinkle over the pan and again over the top. These are sure to become a family favorite. I hope you can create the wonderful memories that I have over the years with this recipe.

I wanted to love these but I really just didn't. I think the caramel flavor gets lost and there is an awful lot of butter which I just can't get over since the flavor isn't there. They basically take like chewy chocolate oatmeal cookies.

These are so very good!!!I tasted them when they were still warm and they were great nice with some ice cream. Then I tried them once chilled and wow they are awesome!!! I really like the crust and am going to try it with carmel and apples this fall. I think everyone should give this one a try!!! :-)

Delicious!!! It was perfect amount of sweet and salty. I will be making this every year for christmas. Make sure to push down the crumb topping as it will fall off while eating it.

These are wonderful. Definitely fills a sweet tooth craving! So easy to make, I've made them for a get together and a bake sale and they were a huge hit at both. I used pecans both times.

I've been making these for years and actually had the recipe saved in my personal recipes.  The only thing I do differently is to melt the butter first.  Everyone who tastes them absolutely loves them!

These are good but much better when made with real caramels and cream instead of the ice cream topping. The ice cream topping just doesn't taste very caramel when it's all cooked together. Instead of ice cream topping and flour use 14oz pkg of caramels and melt in microwave. So much better!

Made the recipe as is, without nuts.  Was fantastic.  Remember to bake far enough ahead to cool completely.

These were very simple to make but for some reason mine came out kind of crunchy. Maybe I baked them too long. Either way I made them for a church picnic and they were ALL gone so they must have been good! I will try these again but bake a little less.

I left out the nuts because my kids don't care for them in desserts, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  These are very quick and easy, and most importantly, delicious!  Super decadent, gooey, yumminess.  I tried them warm from the oven and later on, chilled.  I prefer them warm.  I do recommend putting the crumb topping in the freezer while the base cooks so that it's easier to crumble.  This is a new favorite at our house.

Made these last weekend and used a homemade caramel topping as I didn't have a store bought one at home. They were SO delicious, my husband, daughters and I could not stay away from them. They disappeared quickly! Making again this weekend for Mother's Day dessert at Mom's house.

These were fantastic for my company Christmas Party fundraiser bake sale! We had so many items, but these were a hit, sold the one pan I baked right away! So easy and not time consuming. I should have made two pans!

These are delicious! I don't like nuts in desserts so I left those out.  Coconut would also taste yummy in the filling, and I may try mixing some sweetened condensed milk in with the caramel, as well as another recipe suggested. I will definitely make these often in the future!
