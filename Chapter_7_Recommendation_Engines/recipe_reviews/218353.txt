I thought this was very good, the broth had a great flavor, next time I will add some more vegetables to it. It smells divine while cooking, I left the lid off so the broth would reduce, then added the lid when cooking the vegetables. Thanks LaVohn!

I just made the beef stew tonight for our dinner.  It was wonderful and even my boyfried who makes good beef stew said it outstanding.  I made it just as the recipe calls for.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  I will add this to my recipes and definitely will make again.

This is a delicious stew. We liked the fact that it wasn't dry. The aroma is fantastic cooking in the kitchen. The proportions of veggies to the liquid is just right. Will definitely make this many times. I added one can of whole tomatoes (drained) and 2 T. tomato paste for extra flavor since my husband is a tomato fan. It really did come out great that way.

The first time I made it as is. I added a can of tomato paste and a couple chopped stalks of celery with a splash of Tabasco. Great both ways!

I really like this stew. It has great flavor and lends itself to a bit of creativity. The beef really absorbs the wine (I used Petite Sarah) and ratchets up the taste. I used a bit more salt and pepper and because I didn t have vegetab
