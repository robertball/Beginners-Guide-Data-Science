My Mother always made this for our school lunches and now I make it but I add salt,pepper,onion,and sweet pickle relish. I don't measure anything I have made it for so long that I just guess. I also grind everything with a food grinder. Love It

YUMMY! This is almost exactly what my grammy made for me as a kid. The only thing I changed was I added a bit of mustard. And dill pickles, not sweet. I didn't really go by the measurements just kind of made as much as I need for that day and mix it until it "looks good". I love these so much I had to have them at my wedding! I bet this had to be the oddest request a wedding caterer ever had for a finger food buffet.

I think this is the kind of recipe that appeals mostly to those who have grown up eating it. My mom made this dish often when we were little and occasionally she would switch it up a bit by chopping the bologna and eggs, adding minced onion and mixing it with an oil and vinegar dressing. My grandfather was a butcher so we always had good German bologna in the house. If you're lucky enough to have a German butcher store in your area, I'd suggest going for the couple of extra bucks instead of using bologna from the grocery store. Haven't had this in years and I must say, it brought back a lot of memories. Thanks so much Margaret!

Maybe it was the brand of bologna that I used but the spread turned out to be not quite as good as I thought.

I made this early this morning and whirred it in my food processor before letting it set in the fridge. The only changes I made was using dill pickles instead of sweet and I added a quarter of a chunked yellow onion, fresh garlic and a little fresh ground pepper. The bologna I used was bought at my local deli counter. I'll update my review once we've had some for lunch. EDITED: Good, though I think it needs a little mustard. Not much, a tablespoon or so. Adding the onions and garlic was a smart move. We all liked this.

Surprisingly good.  I used dill pickles instead of sweet (personal preference.  I didn't measure anything I just threw enough together to make a nice snack.

I enjoyed this as a quick lunch with my Magic Bullet! This recipe can be changed in so many ways with anything that you like in a sandwich.

Just like Mom used to make.  I substituted ham for the bologna and used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.

This is a childhood favorite of mine.  We always used Miracle Whip instead of real Mayo but substituting ham for bologna makes it ham salad not bologna salad.  Not the same thing!  I've tried making it without the sweet pickles and it just doesn't have the same zing.  Now I'm wishing I had bologna in the house :\ lol

I made a quarter batch, and should get at least two sandwiches from it! I followed the proportions and it was a quick dinner for the late time I was eating.

I hickory smoked a 1 lb. chub of Frick's Bologna coated with yellow mustard and BBQ rub and used it. Nice smoky flavor addition. If you have never had smoked bologna (that's baloney down where I'm from) you are missing out on a treat. Same for smoked SPAM.

This is a family favorite that we call "Ham Salad". The only difference is that we add onion and cheese to suit.  We serve this spread on toasted white bread.

Good recipe. First time making it but I used dill pickles instead of sweet. Will keep this recipe on file for future use. ??
