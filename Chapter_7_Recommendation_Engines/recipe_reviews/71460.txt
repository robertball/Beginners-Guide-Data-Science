Adding the Jello was a great idea! I used the pan mentioned, but the next time I will use a size smaller so the bottom crust will be a little thicker. I could eat the whole thing by myself - not a good idea.

This is AWESOME!!...I made this using a 13X9 pan...Next time I will double the bottom crust, use 6 c. rhubarb, 1 1/2 times the topping, and a 6 oz box of the jello...Really Really good.

Good Bars!  I would definately use the pan suggested in the recipe otherwise there is too much crust and not enough filling.   Also add 1-2 cups more rhubarb than suggested.

I had my doubts, this recipe looked just too easy to be real, but I am pleasantly surprised. I made it in the pan size stated in the recipe, but I will try it in a 9X13 next time. Also, my topping never did get golden, and crispy, I think I will add some quick oats to the recipe next time and see if it won't crips up better for me. My rhubarb is very sweet and juicy so maybe its just my rhubarb that was the trouble. Anyway it met with rave reviews from everyone who tried it. I made it for a bakesale and it was a hit.

I used egg whites and 2 tablespoons of water instead of milk and it turned out delicious! I blended the rhubarb with a tiny bit of water before i poured it onto the crust. For the crust i added 1 cup of sugar because other reviews said it was too bland. I put the crust in a smaller rectangular pan so it was thicker (instead of doubling the crust). I didn't have strawberry jello so i used raspberry and it was very tasty!!! For the topping i put in 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar and it was perfect.

It was OK. The bottom crust was bland and dry, the middle was yummy, and the topping tasted too much like pure hard sugar.  Next time I'll stick to my old favourite, rhubarb crisp - much easier to make too!

This is a great recipe for rhubarb! I made some slight adjustments - I added 1/2 cup sugar to the crust and used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar for the topping (instead of two cups white sugar). Turned out great and my kids loved it. A very nice sweet and tart recipe added to the collection!

Rhubarb filling and crumb topping were excellent, however, I followed the recipie EXACTLY and my bottom crust is extremely tough. I thought it would be a shortbread type crust but it is just tough and flavorless. Will scrape off the rhubarb and topping and just eat that. Maybe next time I will just make a shortbread crust. Rhubarb filling turned out perfectly though! Nice and jelly-like.

I think these are good, but the crust is missing something, its very blah. I used a 9x13 and added another cup and a half of rhubarb. I also used sugar free cherry jello cuz thats all i had. I also turned the oven up to 400 the last 15-20mn

These are SO easy and my kids think they are better than pie! I've made them twice. The first time followed the recipe as written and they were a hit at a party. The second time, I used half brown sugar and half white for the topping which resulted in a more golden brown color and a richer flavor which I preferred. Both times I made them in the jelly roll pan and they turned out great.  Either way, if you like rhubarb, these are a winner!

Very Tasty but i recomend to most of you not to put as much strawberry gelatin as the recipe says, i love sweets and am not very picky at all! but i thought it made the bars taste too artificial and way too sweet! but otherwise it is very tasty! me and a family member made rhubarb bars(me), and rhubarb pie(them), even though there were twice the amount of bars, they got eaten twice as fast! No joke! the pie actually eventually became stale even though it tasted very good!!!!

We really enjoyed this tangy dessert! I didn't have a whole package of jello so I just used the half package that I had and added extra sugar and some cornstarch. We did find it a little on the tart side so we really enjoyed it with Nutrawhip or ice cream.

I dont know if I did something wrong, but this was not very good. As someone else said the crust was not good and the filling was ok, but not anything special, the topping was the best! I was very dissapointed with this

Very good!  I lined the pan with parchment paper to promote even baking and easy removal.  I also used cherry jello as that was all I had.  Will definetly add to recipe box!

Wow!  This recipe is wonderful!  Usually I can't get children to eat rhubarb.  The combination of the jello with the rhubarb and the crunchy sweet topping convinced my finicky 6 year old this was worth trying.  I will definately make this again....

I made these bars because I remembered a recipe that used jello that got rave reviews. However, I do not think it is this one (the other one had oatmeal, I believe). That being said, these were still pretty good, but definitely not my absolute favorite rhubarb bar. The only thing I changed was that instead of strawberry jello I used raspberry, as it was all I had on hand. I got the comment that the bars were a little too sweet. I'd also recommend using a plate and for with these, they can be a little sloppy to eat.

This is a great starting place.  I read the other reviews so I had added about 1/2 c. of sugar and a pinch of salt to beef up the crust.  I had only 3 rhubarb stalks so I added about 1/2 pt. of fresh strawberries and a handful of dried raisins to the middle.  For the topping I used 1/2 white  and substituted 1/2 brown sugar, added about 1/2 cup of rolled oats and a dash of cinnamon.  It was luscious.  I think it needs that heavier crust to soak up the juice and it reminds me of shortbread cookies.  The top became more like a crumble.  It was a hit with my crew!

Easy and delicious! I love fruit bars but the store/bakery ones often have too much sugar and contain gluten. I just made this using buckwheat flour and a few tbs of potato starch to be sure the dough didn't get soggy from fruit. I froze the butter and chilled the dough a bit after putting in bottom of dish. I used fresh strawberries and halved the entire recipe. I tried a corner as a taste test and ended up eating a quarter if the pan! Next time I'll add more than the required amount of butter and more fruit as the crust was a bit dry, but that means it can take a thick layer of fruit. Enjoy!

Excellent! Kid-approved :)
I didn't have enough rhubarb, so I used 1/2 blueberries. I also didn't have strawberry gelatin, but substituted cherry.  This recipe is very versatile a I will definitely file it as a favorite!

I added a 1/2 cup sour cream to the rhubarb, and also added 1 1/2 c. thawed frozen strawberries, along with cranberry jello. I also added 2 Tblsp. sugar to the crust, but then I only added 1 1/2 c. sugar to the rhubarb mixture, because I added the strawberries that had some sugar in them.. Plus I added fresh grated nutmeg, about 1/2 tsp. Well time will tell.....

AMAZING!  I didn't have strawberry jello so I substituted cherry and it was delicious.  Quick, easy, sweet, tart.  Will surely use this recipe over and over.

Great Bars. I liked the strawberry and rhubarb combination, they work well together. It also made a lot of bars because it used a jelly roll pan. I will make again.

I think the crust balances out the sweetness/tartness of the filling perfectly. I may have gone a little overboard with the gelatin, but It made just that much gooier and I don't think anyone complained =]

Very good. Even my daughters who don't eat rhubarb enjoyed this bar. Played with the recipe a bit to make it in a 9x13 pan. All in all, a new way to use rhubarb.

I love this recipe for rhubarb bars, I use raspberry jello instead of strawberry and I use the large box of jello.  My family love these more than rhubarb pie and they are always gone within a day.  They are a big hit at family get-togethers and pot luck's.

To make this into a tart (serving 8) halve the recipe and bake in a 9” tart pan.  (A frozen pie crust can be used in a pinch, just let it thaw in tart pan, then ease it into pan’s shape to make a tart with short sides).   I only used 1/4 of topping, the second time I made it, and it was sufficient.  I also used 2c. chopped frozen rhubarb (no need to thaw.)

Needed a desert for a get together and thought I'd try this.  Sounded easy and would make a lot.  Was that ever a good idea cause they are the best bar ever. Great as is or with homemade ice cream and even topped with whipped cream.   The only thing was in the recipe, in ingredients said only one cup flour for crust but directions said two. Be sure to use two. Definitely will make more.

I used a 9X 13 glass pan.  Reduced the oven temp to 350.  Baked 60 minutes.  Top very sweet.  Bottom very bland.  Together they are very good.  Should be crowd pleaser.

Made it as per recipe, except for the topping I replaced 1 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar and came out nicely. The base turned out a little dry, not bad, but just drier than I hoped it would be. They are ooey gooey, and delicious. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I made the recipe exactly as stated. I agree that the crust is tough. I will try using a shortbread crust next time and less sugar in the topping.

Per other reviews I used a smaller pan, more rhubarb than stated, and found some of the same challenges as other reviewers.  The bottom crust added nothing to the recipe and I actually think this recipe makes a better rhubarb slump/crisp than it does bars.  So, next time I'm not going to bother with the bottom crust.  I also think there was a bit too much of the strawberry Jello so I will cut down on that, too.  Still, I will probably try it again with my changes as a quick and easy dessert.

This recipe is delicious. I only had 3 cups of rhubarb, so I threw in 1 lb of mixed frozen berries. Also cut down the butter to  3/4 stick in crust and 3/4 sick in topping.

DELICIOUS!!! I added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a little salt to the crust. We were too impatient to wait for the bars to cool so it was more like a cobbler than a bar. Everyone liked them and had seconds!

Made this exactly as directed.  I agree with the majority of posters who liked the filling and topping but found the crust disappointing and tasteless.  Will make again using a shortbread crust.

Loved this!  I followed some of the reviews and doubled the crust.  Next I will make it as written.  Doubling made the crust too thick to the amount of topping.  And the topping is yummy!

These were yummy. My husband is a rhubarb freak and he liked these a lot. They were very tangy, reminiscent of the tang of a lemon square. The only thing that could be improved is that the Jell-o masks the rhubarb flavor. Next time, I would try it with half the Jell-o mix and see if the rhubarb flavor is stronger.

This was tasty.  I baked it in a 9x13 Pyrex pan, and it needed 15 more minutes to bake. With the smaller pan, I thought the crust was too thick for its so so flavor.  Next time I will either try a shortbread crust like a lemon bar or add a little lemon zest and sugar to this crust. I will make it again!

These were very moist and the center was awesome, the only thing i did different was to add about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the crust, could have used a whole tsp.. will try that next time. thanks for a great bar.

These bars are wonderful... I cut out one cup of sugar and I used sugar free Jello.  Baked them in my broiler pan which everything bakes great in....I have five of them....picked them up at thrift stores, garage sales...they all nest into each other so take up little space when storing.  I used 1/2 fresh rhubarb and the other half - my frozen from last year that I found lurking in my freezer.
