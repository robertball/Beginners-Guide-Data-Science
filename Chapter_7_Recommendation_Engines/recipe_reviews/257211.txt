I made this soup last night for today, knowing that most soups and stews taste better the next day. The taste test was great! I used organic carrots of 5 different colors purchased at Costco. I plan to make this again very soon. It is so healthful as well as beautiful, delicious and satisfying.

Excellent! used 2% milk in place of coconut cream & dried ginger powder in place of fresh.  Fresh is always better.
