This is a great recipe.  It tasted wonderful and I wouldn't have known it was sugar free.  I know I will be making this again!

I made this for a Memorial Day cookout...doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 X 13 pan. Everyone loved it! This one's a keeper.

This pie is fantastic. I have made it several times already and it turns out great each time. I use unsweetened coconut for even less sugar and it tastes great.

I followed this recipe to a tee yet it still would not set up. It was very soupy. I'll try again, though. It does sound so good.

This is my first coconut cream pie I've made and I'm glad I chose a terrific recipe. Although it is good warm; it is terrific cold.

I was shocked at how great this pie tasted!!!! It was easy to follow and such a treat for someone who loves sweets but wants to lose pounds.  I never thought skim milk could taste so good.  Thanks, Splenda

This is my Grandmothers favorite kind of pie and she said it is just as good as it is when you use sugar. Very easy to make, you have to be ready though. Once you get the heat on it, it goes really fast.
