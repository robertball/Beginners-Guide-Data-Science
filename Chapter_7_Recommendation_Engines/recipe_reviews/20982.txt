I found the potatoes to be rather bland.  I will stay with my tried and true.  Cut 1/4" slices across, but not through the bottom skin, stuff with purple onion cut into half rings and pats of butter in each slit, sprinkle with garlic salt and black pepper, and when they are done, open the foil sprinkle with sharp cheddar cheese and top with crisp cooked bacon pieces.

I have not made it exactly how the recipe goes. I make slash marks on my potatoes (leave them whole) and wrap a slice or two of bacon around the potato. For something different I use maple bacon. Wrap in foil and put it on the grill. I am going to try it quartered with the cheese, bacon, and I'll add some onions. MMMMMM Good!

By no means was this an attractive dish, but it sure was good! I think it definitely needs to have some sort of liquid in there. Next time I would probably make this in a foil pan and add either olive oil or chicken broth. I did add quite a bit of garlic powder, salt, pepper, and parsely. I also added a pound of fresh mushrooms. Thanks :)

I followed other's suggestions and sliced whole potates part way down, drizzled with olive oil, sprinkled garlic salt and seasoned salt, covered with shredded cheddar cheese and wrapped with the bacon. I cooked them in my oven and it took about 1 1/2 hours. They were very, very good.

I thought this was very good.  I made it as per the recipe except I added shredded cheddar cheese AFTER the potato was served on my plate.  I folded the foil around the potatos, leaving space on all sides and flipped halfway through grilling time.

This was really good!  Foil "packets" need to be turned at least once to make sure that everything is getting cooked and all the cheese melts.  Definitely recommend this with a steak!

I followed other reviewers & my suggestions -thanks! Doubled heavy duty foil cut large enough to enfold each large potato & gave each foil square a hit of butter-flavored cooking spray. Sliced large potatos not quite through, drizzed a bit of EV olive oil, with finger over opening-a splash of white wine, sprinkled into each slit & exterior of potato w/garlic powder, seasoned salt, milled pepper, basil, stuffed each slit w/thin sliced red onion, sprinkled all w/real shredded cheddar cheese, wrapped regular uncooked bacon around exterior. With doubled foil, I made an upside-down tent around potato, brought both ends together and folded down from the top, leaving a little air space for expansion, then folded in each end [to avoid leakage]. Flipped each halfway through the grilling time. Very good!

I was far from impressed with this recipe. The instructions are a problem.  The ingredients refer to potatoes cut in wedges, yet the directions seem to refer to the whole potato.
I'll stay with the way I've been doing them.  Slicing my potatoes onto some foil (which I spray with Pam), add onion slices, shredded cheddar, sprinkle a little Olive Oil, s & p, seal and place on the grill. No bacon. Delicious.

Great side dish!  Been looking for something different on the grill.

This was so good! I used shredded cheddar instead of the cheese slice.
