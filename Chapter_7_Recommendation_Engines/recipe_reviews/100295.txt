Born in your native city of Belfast I grew up on Champ.
One one thing missing from this recipe which would make it an "authentic" champ is the addition of one or two raw eggs mixed into the mash along with the milk,butter and scallions.
Without that it is just mashed potatoe with milk , butter and scallions.
Try the REAL Belfast champ by adding raw eggs.

This is a classic irish champ recipe. Half my family is irish and it tasted just like any champ i've ever had. I think it's important for people to remember when they make these recipes, that classic irish fare usually consists of basic, and usually very inexpensive ingredients. It's not supposed to come out tasting like something you ordered at a 5 star resturant... it's pub food!

This was really good, but we thought it was lacking a little something. Hubby stirred in some sour cream which really made it pop! Yummy.

This is so delicious!  My husband is from Co. Monaghan Ireland and I made this for his family.  His mom hadn't made it in years since her kids are grown now and she doesn't have anyone to cook for, but she thoroughly enjoyed it.  I generally use about half as many green onions as it calls for.

I have made Irish Champ for my family countless times (being Irish). The dish is always well liked and always empty at the end of the meal. I remember my grandmother making this with a raw egg (as another reviewer mentioned). I don't use one only because I am sensitive to food poisoning. But I think that the dish tastes great without it. This recipe is simple to make and good tasting.

I wish there were more stars! We loved this. I made them green for St. Patty's, but I think we found a new way to make smashed taters FOREVER. I added a few tablespoons of creamcheese, but other than that, followed the recipe excactly. SO GOOD!!!

Rich, creamy, and so delicious! Exactly right for our St. Patrick's Day dinners. I've served this with lamb stew, with corned beef and cabbage, and most recently with roasted salmon. I use cream instead of milk (oh my heart) and I let the scallions and cream seethe gently until the scallions soften. Comfort food with an Irish accent indeed!

A very strong onion taste.  I enjoyed them very much, but the kids wouldn't touch them after one bite.  I would cut back on the amount of green onion a bit.

Absoulutely authentic as is, no additions no subtractions, this is what we grew up with in Ulster. It's hard to find the right textured potatoes in North America, but those which have a "floury" texture are the best. If you can't find those, go with what you've got. Yum!!

The first time I made this for my family I was planning on having leftovers for potato pancakes for breakfast the next morning. There were none left. They all raved over them. So now when I make this dish I put what I need away. By the way they make excellant pancakes with bacon gravy and sliced tomatos.

Love this recipe.  It doesn't even need the extra butter at the table.  It's perfect creamy potatoes with a touch of flavor with the onions and butter. So Good!

This was good, but to be honest it's really just mashed potatoes with green onions in it.  It was a nice flavour, we'll probably make it again.

Simple, simple, simple.  The way it should be.  The green onions really make the dish, as does good butter and plenty of salt.  I soft-boiled an egg (5 minutes in boiling water) for each person and served it on top of the champ for breakfast.

I never would have thought that just adding scallions to mashed potatoes would make them so delicious! I used gold potatoes and a bit of garlic powder, and did top with more butter before serving. I can see adding a little of what other reviewers suggested as well (cream cheese, sour cream, egg). I'm a little late for St Patty's Day, but this is delicious and has a spring-like taste to it. Thanks for the great recipe, Ita! UPDATE 12/25/16: This time I did not peel the Yukon gold potatoes, and I really liked it that way. I also added some plain Greek yogurt that I had to use up (works like sour cream or the cream cheese).  Great!

Been making tis for years. To do a "quicker" way, use powered potatoes, and heat the scallions in the milk/water mixture befoe adding the potatoes.

I have to agree with another reviewer that there really isn't anything original about this.  It's just mashed potatoes, after all, with green onion added to it. Nevertheless, Hubs and I enjoyed this as part of our St. Paddy's Day corned beef dinner.  I added the green onion to taste rather than the full amount, and used buttermilk instead of milk, basically because I had it to use before we head out of town.  Looking forward to a re-do tomorrow night with this evening's leftovers.

My Dad was born in N. Ireland so we grew up on Champ.  His variation on the classic was to use buttermilk instead of regular milk, giving the dish a unique, creamy taste.

Delicious! Even my daughter, who can't stand mashed potatoes (the texture kills it for her), ate it and liked it! The onions really make this dish.

I enjoyed this. Not exceptional, but a nice-tasting side dish for our St. Patrick's day meal. I prefer a lot of green onions but didn't want to overwhelm the others who don't, so I had a bowl of extra sliced green onions on the side. Some took it, some didn't - it was a good compromise for those who worry about it being to strong.

I absolutely love this recipe. Delicious alternative to bangers and mash. I used less milk, as I think the amount in the recipe would have made the mash rather runny. Also I've found that heating the spring onions in less milk intensifies their flavour. Thanks for this recipe. :o)

We made this last night, and we loved it. Instead of peeling the potatoes we left the skins on, and we had bought the small golden potatoes and they worked just as good. We thought it was asking for more green onions then needed but followed the recipe anyways and I'm glad we did!!! it was so good

Made these for St. Patricks Day and the family all enjoyed. Leftovers were enjoyed the next day, too! Note: I tripled the amount of potatoes (used about 2/3rds of a 10 lb bag) and still only used the 1 C. of milk and 1/2 C. of butter. Plenty moist--I cant imagine how runny they would have been if I had used 3 C of milk! Also, I used about 8-9 stalks of green onion and they had plenty of onion flavor. Really didn't need to add anymore onion.

We like mashed potatoes with skins left on, so I made this using “unpeeled” Yukon Gold potatoes.  Liked the taste the green onions added to this dish.  My DS really liked this recipe much better than the mashed potato recipes I make with cooked cabbage added.  In fact, he asked that I make mashed potatoes this way, all the time.  It pared very nicely with ‘Brown Sugar Meatloaf’ another AR recipe.

Very well received at my St Patty's party. I asked all my regulars if I should keep it for next year or go back to my boiled potatoes. It was a definite "keep it!".Thanks for the addition to my menu. Of course on the 17th I added food colouring to make it green!

These are so yummy! I made them to serve with a chicken fried steak recipe from the site. I used KerryGold Irish butter.

This is now a family favorite! I have made this a bunch of times already, though this most recent time I forgot to add the salt! It was a little bland the first day, but the leftovers (I make A LOT) had a wonderful green onion flavor that we never noticed before!

Wonderful recipe! We've been making the Guinness Corned Beef recipe from this site for years and finally decided to add a different side to it besides carrots and boiled potatoes. I followed the recipe exactly as given and it was perfect. We added just one bunch of green onion as the recipe calls for and didn't think it was too much at all. After reading the previous reviews I was wondering if others had added the whole rubber band wrapped amount sold in the grocery store instead. I think if I had added that much it would be way too much. I did add some green food coloring for St. Patrick's Day as someone else suggested and it added a nice touch and added some great color to the plates. Thanks for the keeper recipe!

I made this for St. Patrick's day and the people I work with loved it. Of course, I did not get enough, so I am making it again to serve with pork roast tonight. Twice in one week! Can you tell I am Irish?! Thank you for the recipe, Ita. This one is a keeper!

Made these for irish themed dinner I was hosting for friends.  I accidentally cooked the potatoes too long, but still delicious.   Served under Beef and Guinness® Stew from this site, with irish soda bread. So simple so easy so good.  My fiancé who hates onions even loved these.

Champ and sausages!, one of my fav dinners :) I love loads of scallions ( green onions ) in mine but have to hold back for the kids. And we all have an extra dollop of butter on top too. I personally don't add the raw eggs that my mum always did as I have a child with an egg allergy but it still tastes good this way.

Thank you for the recipe!  My husband and I love potatoes and onions, so this was perfect for us.  I changed a few things too:  I left the peelings on the potatoes, and I used coconut milk and Earth Balance sticks for a vegan version.  Even my meat-eating husband likes them :)

I've been making this for years only I didn't know it was Irish and had a name!  I just added a bunch of chopped green onions to mashed potatoes to flavor them up first time, and have made them that way ever since!  They are delicious and any leftovers do make excellent fried potato patties for breakfast the next morning.

Delicious.  I reduced the amount of green onions too due to other reviews and the fact that my kids would probably hesitate to eat it.  I served it with Beef and Irish Stout Stew from this site.  Thanks for sharing this recipe Ita.

I served this last night with Beef and Irish Stout Stew pour over it----just enough of each so that the separate flavors could be enjoyed. My family LOVED the combo!! Yes, you could add sour cream, but this is great just as it is. I didn't add any egg--the idea just didn't appeal to me (Sorry!).  For those who said the onion taste was strong---don't you taste as you cook? Add as much or as little as you like.  My children grew up with an Executive Chef father. We both made the family meals, and introduced our five to a wide variety of foods. I'm grateful that I never had a problem with "picky eaters" (the random food allergy excepted). I actually had one child that preferred "green" food!

Thank you for sharing. This recipe is very simple and delicious. The green onions give the potatoes a wonderful flavor. My family really enjoyed this and I will be making it again very soon. Also, I thought this would be a perfect topping for Shepherd's Pie, which I will try making tonight.

My family is Irish and I've been making my grandmother's Champ recipe for years. It's my 14 year old's favorite dish. He loves it with corned beef. The only difference in my grandma's recipe is that she uses cream instead of milk. I noticed that a few people said it was missing something... the cream will make it richer and creamier.

I freakin LOVE champ! I was taught to melt the butter then add cream and green onions to "steep", though.
ALSO I love to add a bit of cornstarch and fry these as patties to make CHAMPCAKES! MMMmmmMMMMM!!!

This was lovely and a different way to have mashed potatoes. Used a little less green onion, and that was perfect for us. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

One comment I would make is the Irish Champ always uses full fat milk.  In Canada we call it Homo milk (3.5% butterfat).  I have made it with 1% milk and it still tastes great!

Thank you for this recipe, it was better than I had thought it would be.  I have never used green onions before and didn't know what a bunch of green onions was so I just eye-balled the amount and it tuned out great.

These were really good!  I used 2 1/2 lbs potatoes rather than 2 lbs and was glad I did.  With 1 cup of milk I could have probably used 3 lbs to make them a little thicker.  Seems like it would be too thin and liquidy with only 2 lbs.  Flavor was great though!

Easy and so tasty!  I'm rather famous for my mashed potatoes and was afraid my kids wouldn't like something new, but they LOVED it!  A new favorite to add to our traditional St. Patty's meal along with Irish Brown Soda Bread.

I love this recipe for Champ...being 50% Irish & 50% polish I grew up eating a lot of potatoes and cabbage. Plain old mashed potatoes just don't cut it after this...of course if you want to change things up a little you can always make Colcannon...my other favorite potato dish.

Made this for our St. Patrick's Day meal to go along with Beef and Irish Stout Stew (from this site) and Irish Soda Bread V (again from this site.  It was such a good accompaniment to the meal - almost good enough to take center stage!  I made it exactly how it read and it turned out perfect!

It's the real stuff! (I'm Irish). Make a depression in the top and add a chunk of butter.
You could put grated cheese on top and grill (broil) and crumble crispy bacon over it. It's not champ any more but its nice.

There is another Irish dish called Colcannon (not sure of spelling), it's the same as this,only you add sauteed shredded cabbage to the mix -- also like to add just a little grated garlic.

This is the first time I have ever made champ.  My husband and I enjoyed it, but the kids did not.  If you like green onions you will love this dish.  I will make this again, but I will leave some "plain" for the kids!

Great recipe.  I made these to go with an Irish stew (arranged in a ring around the serving bowl with stew in the middle.  I followed the recipe exactly and the potatoes were so smooth and creamy with great flavor.  I had to make these a couple of hours ahead of serving since I was bringing it somewhere else.  I was afraid that they would get stiff but they stayed creamy even after warming them up on the stove.  Great recipe - everyone loved them - and so pretty to serve!

I made this with my functional skills class to introduce Irish cooking for St. Patrick's Day- they loved it! They had seconds and thirds! I thought there was a little too much milk in it making it a little runny, maybe next time I will use less milk, but  very tasty! I will make this at home! Great side dish or maybe even an entrée! mmmm...

This was perfect served with corned beef and cabbage last night for Saint Patty's Day! I used less green onions and added fresh parsley and "real" bacon bits. Also stirred in sour cream to make it creamier. I'd be very interested in adding an egg next time as the most popular reviewer stated. FYI: You'd only need to add shredded cheddar cheese to make this Loaded mashed potatoes ;-)

I cut back on the green onion, added some sour cream, and as others have said I mixed a raw egg into it while it was still piping hot.  I took it to a St. Patrick's Day dinner and it was promptly devoured.

Even though this is a simple recipe, it packs some seriously delicious flavor.  A few other reviews said it wasn't authentic without the egg, which may be true, but rating this recipe as-is... it is a "champ"!  Delicious.  I always like to add a little sour cream for creaminess too, but it doesn't have to have it

If I were paying attention to measurements, this would have been perfect. The flavors were great. I used too much milk so it was runny. So I created a less than traditional Irish dish by putting it in a casserole dish with some grated cheddar and tossed it in the oven. It worked out well so I still gave the recipe 5 stars.

This was good.  I sauted the onion in the butter and then added the milk to warm and incorporate the onion taste in the potatoes.  We did add eggs.  Stirred them in at the end- constant stirring - turned out perfectly.  Served this with a pork roast that we cooked on the stove-top.  Good stuff.  Won't make it often but will make it often enough.

I really wanted to capture that "authentic" taste that some reviewers had suggested by adding an egg into the mashed.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the egg, but it made the mashed potatoes a little too "mushy" than I would have liked. If you are planning to add an egg then I would recommend adding an extra few potatoes to get that nice consistancy of mashed potatoes. The egg didn't make much of a difference, though.  It made the potatoes just slightly creamy. If you have food allgeries, then leaving out the egg won't make much of a difference. I agree with some other reviewers that it did lack some flavour, so I just added more salt and it really kicked up the flavour! Will definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing!

Perhaps my wasn't quite authentic Irish when I changed it up. I used red potatoes and mashed them with skin on so they were mostly creamy but a little chunky. I added some sour cream as well. The red skins with the green onions was lovely and makes the dish more interesting and rustic.  Fantastic and a hit at my St. Patrick's Day dinner. This recipe inspired me to add green onions to my mashed potatoes for good!

Amazing so easy so so good.  We will keep this and rotate into monthly side dishes.  I made two tiny changes I had some half and half so I used that in place of the milk.  I also was very busy while making this so I left the skins on the potatoes and mashed them in.  Extra vitamins and good texture.  Thank you

Delicious, Wonderful, Fabulous, I don't have to say anymore! I used light cream instead of milk. Will make this often, Thanks!

I have made this all my life, I didn't know that it had a name or it actually would ever have a written recipe. It is one of my comfort foods.

This was very good. I doubled the butter and added some bacon. Almost as good as colcannon.

Made as posted but I was curious about adding the eggs so I did.  It's hard to rate "mashed potatos" 5 stars but these were really good.  I don't know if the egg made any difference.  Beats plain old mashed potatos.

I followed the recipe exactly as described and it was delicious and so simple. I've made it a few more times, and doubled it as well. And, like another reviewer mentioned, when doubling the recipe, about 1 3/4 cups milk is sufficient.

Great recipe. I used gold potatoes and cream instead of milk, and my family said they could eat them everyday with nothing else but a little butter on top

Very good. I used a 10 lb bag of potatoes so I multiplied the recipe by 5...I will probably use less milk next time but other than that no complaints!

This recipe was a hit! I made it almost identical to the recipe. I subbed milk for heavy cream and added more butter to the finished product (on top of the champ). For serving, I spread the champ in a large white baking dish and placed Irish Bangers and crisp bacon (sprinkled in small bits) on top of the champs.

This was good but missing something. The way I was taught to make it was with cheese.  My family are from Dublin and the way I was taught is the way my whole family makes it.

Easy to make, and very filling.  But lacks something in flavor.  Not really sure how to fix it though and it still be authentic.

I don't like green onions, but following the general recipe (I probably put less onions than called for), I made something that I can stand to taste green onions in. Next time I think I may add some cheese.

Very creamy.  Next time I would reduce the milk slightly, maybe to 3/4 cup.  Very good flavor.

Makes a nice, creamy mashed potato.  I doubled the recipe because I needed more than what the recipe called for.  I also added quite a bit more salt and pepper (it was kind of bland tasting if you only put a pinch of each in the dish) and I threw in two sticks of butter total.  It came out very buttery and creamy and delicious.

I doubled the recipe and 2 cups milk was a little too much.
