One tip for the viewers.  If you boil the eggs for the whole fifteen minutes, each yolk will have an unappetizing green coating.  Taking off the heat as soon as the water comes to a boil  and letting stand for 15 min. will give you beautiful yellow yolks

I just knew this was something my hubby would like, being that we all grew up on the infamous "Deviled ham". What's better than eggs and ham anyway? I just bought one of those cute little deviled egg plates and needed an excuse to use it. Hubby was very, very happy with his after work appetizer tonight. Thanks a lot Penny!

I was really excited to try this for Easter. I can't say it tasted bad...the deviled ham alone was good. 
Everyone expected this to turn out like the traditional deviled egg with an extra kick.  Instead it changed the deviled egg taste altogether. Everyone agreed I should have stuck to the plain old deviled egg. I won't make this again but it's always nice to try  knew things.

Very good twist on deviled eggs; what better ingredient than deviled ham? My family loved it & nobody could quite figure out what was in it.

This is the best recipe on here. Also, the most basic, which is what I was looking for. I didn't add the olive, but these came out great, (also omitted the ham)!!

These eggs are great.  People were very surprised when I told them there is deviled ham in them.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Good but not great.  I've since played with it a little bit and replaced the ham with imitation lobster, chopped finely in a processor.  Much better that way.

These eggs are awesome!  My children do not like deviled eggs but I try to get them to try them every year during the Holiday season...now I have found a recipe that they really liked!  The deviled ham is the kicker, you can sway the taste by adding or lessening the mayo or mustard to your liking...way to go Pen!

The use of the deviled ham makes it taste like a tuna salad. Definitely need to substitute the deviled ham for dill relish

They were okay, but I think they could've done without the deviled meat.  It made kind of a yucky texture in your mouth.

I've made these deviled eggs my whole life (I'm 63) and my mother did before me. Delicious, my favorite way to make these.  Only time I make deviled eggs differently is if my sister is present, as she's vegetarian.
