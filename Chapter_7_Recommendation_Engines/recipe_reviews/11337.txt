I followed this recipe exactly and these are not fudgy nor should they be called brownies. They were lacking flavor and were definitely more like cake. I will not be making these again

I was craving chocolate cake--something ooey, gooey, and deliciously sinful. This recipe more than delivered! It was so easy to make (fold the chocolate chips in; the whisk won't hold up at that point). To give it a bit more moisture, I added one single-serving cup of unsweetened applesauce. The end result is a soft, chocolatey, almost truffle-like cakey brownie concoction that is beyond perfection.

I LOVED these brownies! I tried them out last night before everyone got home from work and theirs only 1 left (probably because no one wants to wash the pan). But i didn't have a 3oz pudding so i used my 5oz pudding. And i didn't have enough milk so i used veg. oil. It all turned out perfect!

These are great.  They keep getting moister each day!  I baked them in a 9x13 inch pan and it worked fine, I just had to bake them a little longer.  There are lots of chocolate chips in them, so next time I might use 1 cup chips and 1 cup chopped pecans.  Thanks a lot for such an easy and delicious recipe!

Amazingly easy, blazingly quick, and unequivocally chocolatey.  Note the original directions call for a 15x10 pan.  I didn't have one, so I used a 13x9 and an 8x8.  Brownie batter doesn't need to be more than 1/2 inch deep in the pan.  I probably could have gotten away with two 13x9's.  I used a devil's food cake mix because I didn't have a regular chocolate mix on hand, and I only baked the two pans of brownies for 18 minutes.  They came out nice and fudgy, but next time I might shorten the baking time by another 2-3 minutes to keep them even more moist.    This batter (uncooked) would also be great frozen and chopped into pieces, then stirred into a fresh batch of homemade ice cream.

Awesome!  Rave reviews from my family for this recipe.

These are VERY chocolately and moist.  If these don't sastify your chocolate craving, there is something wrong with you!

As far as the directions go, you really can't whisk in the cake mix very well as the pudding and cake mix gets really thick.  You also aren't "pouring" the batter into the pan.  The batter is so thick you have to scrape it out of the bowl.  Do NOT make these in a 9 x 13 pan as they come out way too thick.

I'd give these five stars but I modified the recipe just a bit: the recipe as written (and when used with half 1% and half skim milk) was way too thick and I knew they'd be way to cakey, so I added about a 1/4 cup of leftover coffee and whisked that in before folding in only about a cup of chocolate chips.
with those changes, THESE ARE SO GOOD!! cakey but fudgy at the same time (and I like mine super fudgy) and sooo chocolatey. I will absolutely make these again and again

OMG!  I just made these for Easter and I only hope they last that long!  These are the EASIEST and BEST tasting brownies I have EVER made!!!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding one cup of chopped pecans.  I used Jello brand Chocolate Fudge instant pudding and Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Dark Chocolate Fudge cake.  Used 2% milk.  Fudgy and absolutely delicious!!  Thank you Denise!

Disappointing!  Based on the name, I expected these to be "fudgy".  They weren't.  They are cake like and a little rubbery.  Giving them 2 stars because it's still chocolate.

Very cakey.  Easy enough that my 9 yr old daughter made them alone. she added some crushed oreos and then a can of frosting on top.  They were fine but certainly wont be making them again.

These are awesome!  I love brownies, and these are now one of my favorites!  They are incredibly decadent, and very moist.  If you like the crust/edges of a brownie that are crispier than these might not be for you, but if you like rich moist brownie than you'll love these!  I can understand why some people might debate if these count as brownies since there is cake mix in it, but the people I've served these to (and there have been many!) with no exposure to the ingredients rave about these as decadent brownies.  Yum!

Definitely need to use a 15x10 pan! These were great but I only had a 9x13 and they neared the brim of the pan! My husband said they were like hot chocolate brownies - rich and fudgy.

I use the Pillsbury Moist Supreme chocolate cake mix (which already has 1 c. of pudding in the mix) and a small box of Jello brand Sugar Free Instant Vanilla pudding, and Nestle's Mini Semi Sweet Chocolate Chips. It makes the brownies extremely moist and fudgy. They aren't cakelike at all and everyone who has eaten them says they are amazing. This is a really great recipe with brownies that don't dry out after a day or two but stay moist for several days until they are all eaten. I've never had any complaints from this recipe and it is SUPER EASY to make.

If you are looking for fudgy brownies, pass by this recipe. If you are looking for a chocolate/chocolate chip cake, you found it.  We loved this recipe at my house.  It satisfied the chocolate/sweet tooth. It went together extremely easy and quickly. And the clean up was very minimal.  I now keep this recipe on my kitchen counter and plan to change out the flavors.  Thanks bunches for it.  Hope this helps other bakers.

Well...first, these are NOT brownies by any stretch of the imagination-they remind me of microwave cake. *They are however an edible dessert, just ask my kids! The dh said we can have the whole pan for ourselves. Yay?

When I was half way through I realized I didn't have any chocolate chips. Without them, these were sort of bland. We did discover though that if you ice the brownie with peanut butter, they are the most delicious little things you've ever eaten!

Yum!! I didn't have chocolate cake mix so I used yellow cake mis plus 1/4 c cocoa. Everything else was the same. Came out a little more cakey - less dense than regular brownies. However, YUM!!!!  Extra benefit to my fam was the eggless factor (allergies). Thank you!!

These were terrific.  They were a "cakey" type of brownie.  I did make them in a regular cake pan and baked them about 37 minutes.  We ate them warm with ice cream on top.  We felt these were very chocolaty.  I will make these again as they were great for vegetarians (which I am).  No one would know they don't have eggs.  I would take these to share at any get together.  Thank you!

I loved these! I wouldn't call these 'cakey', they're not super dense but they're not dry. I used chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips because that's what I had, and these melted into nice molten gooey spots instead of disappearing into the brownies. They're shiny and moist and SUPER easy, thanks for sharing.

Ridiculously good brownies for how simple the recipe is.  I agree with others, this is definitely not a fudge brownie, but it's not quite cakey either.  Just very soft and moist, hard to describe.  I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate (had a bag to use up) and they were pretty great that way.  Look elsewhere for a fudge brownie, but this is still highly recommended.

12/26/17 edit: something I’ve discovered over the years is the versatility of this recipe. Play around with different pudding flavors, different cake mixes, and different chips. A seasonal favorite: use eggnog to make vanilla pudding, add spice cake, and mix in cinnamon chips: Christmas bars. I’ve also done strawberry cake, strawberry pudding (don’t think they make that anymore), and chocolate chips. That one wasn’t quite a winner but it’s still fun to play with the flavors.

I've been making this for years, but a big difference, i use dark chocolate fudge brownie mix, it makes them come out better and I only use one 12 ounce package of nestle semi sweet chocolate chips and I've found that adding the chocolate chips after baking it for 20 minutes keeps the chips from melting and burning on the bottom, a problem that i had alot. i also bake them for 40 minutes in a glass pan, the type of pan makes a big difference.

Since I am trying to cut down on sugar I made this recipe using the 50% less sugar cake mix and sugar free instant pudding.  I also added some walnuts.  I don't know how the original recipe would be but I had to spread the mixture in the pan rather than pour it.  My family and I were very happy with the results.  While the texture wasn't quite brownie-like it had a nice texture and the chocolate taste was terrific.  I will definately make these again.

Darn..they are sooo cake-like!! Not what I would call a 5-star brownie. Still, they were yummy. My mom brung some to work to share and she doesn't usually do that..They were also really difficult to whisk so just gave that up and finished it with my mixing bowl. Great taste, nice look. Thank you for the easy recipe.

These turned out really moist and chocolaty but they were more like cake than brownies. They cut very nicely without alot of crumby mess.

I will make these again- a great egg and dairy free dessert if you use soy milk and dairy/egg free cake mix.

Excellent, but I would not really call this a brownie.  I added some mashed banana and a splash of almond extract.  Very rich, moist and chocolatey.  I really liked the fact that this recipe didn't contain egg, and it was super-easy.

This recipe was so simple and very tasty. The batter seemed a bit dry so I added a splash of oil and they turned out fairly moist.

Good flavor, but disapointed in the texture.  These brownies are overly cakey.  Best use would be for a cold or frozen ice cream torte or truffle.

I followed the directions but added some chocolate chips. It was very dry looking on top but was very moist and tasteful. I would use it again but add a little more oil.

I needed a brownie quick - and only had cake mixes in the cupboard, but this recipe worked great! I don't have as 15x10 inch pan, but followed someone's suggestion to split the batter between a 9x13 and 8x8. That was the best part, because then I had the pan I needed to take with me and one to keep home and enjoy. The thickness of the batter made them more challenging to spread out in the pan, but they seemed to level quite well while they were baking so it wasn't necessary to make the top perfectly smooth when spreading the batter.

I stumbled upon these tonight because I'm out of eggs and my husband was craving something sweet and I didn't feel like running to the store.  I used what I had on hand, which was a devils food cake mix and white chocolate pudding mix.  I also used a can of evaporated milk and 1/2 a cup of skim milk, because I'm also low on milk and needed to save some to drink with these! I used only about a cup of chocolate chips and that seems like plenty. Thanks for sharing this super easy recipe!!

I made these without the chocolate chips but added canned whipped chocolate frosting and my kids LOVED them.  I didn't have instant pudding but used a package of cook-n-serve and they still came out great.
