This tofu is yummy, but I can only eat it in small quantities with a veggie skillet or it's too sweet for me.  I also had trouble draining the tofu (pesky stuff!).  Thanks for the recipe!

Baked Tofu Haiku: "Love to bake tofu. Marinated mine longer. Brushed sauce halfway too." Mine came out way darker than those of the other recipe photographs, perhaps b/c I marinated it for 3 hrs. as opposed to 12 min., and I brushed the marinade that I'd set aside on top when I flipped the tofu at 15 min. It's not a very complex or thrilling marinade, but  when I cubed and ate the tofu over a spinach salad, it was nice that it didn't have overly complicated flavors to compete w/ the nice greens. Having said that, I wouldn't serve it as written by itself as a main dish - perhaps stir-fried, or like I made it (over a salad.)

Yummy!! I added some fresh turmeric to the marinade. Keep the marinade to add after cooking. Thank you SlimCookins for the recipe.

Easy and basic. On its own, very salty, but mixed in with rice and broccoli, itâ€™s very tasty. I agree with the suggestion made in another review to use low sodium soy sauce.

This is excellent! Even my non-vegetarian family members liked it. But I would definitely make sure to get low sodium soy sauce. I used regular, as it's what I had, and it was salty. Paired with rice, it cut some of  the saltiness, but would have been better with low sodium. Most definitely making this again.
