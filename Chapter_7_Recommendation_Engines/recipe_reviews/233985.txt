These are so good! I don't use the chia seeds, but I do use the flax seed.  Be sure to grind the flax seed to get the full nutritional value from it.  I used a little coffee bean grinder.  Great recipe!!

I've made these twice - we liked them so much I quadrupled the recipe the second time. I wore non powder, non latex gloves to mix because I squished everything together really well and this way the sticky stuff didn't get under my nails or in my rings.  I've already added hemp seed and some coconut as well. I also run the dark chocolate chips through the food processor to make them even smaller. If you soak the Chia seeds in 1/4 cup of water for a little bit, they start to develop into a gel and I think acts as another binder. Initially these are expensive to make when you buy everything at once but in the long run, I'm sure it's cheaper than buying granola bars for the kids' lunch and WAY HEALTHIER. I still have to find out if they are freezable. I added the picture of my quadruple recipe.  It filled a sheet pan with 68 balls.

I use almond butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I only put in a couple tablespoons of honey. One thing that helped a ton was wetting my hands when forming the balls.

My husband and I love protein balls.  I make them quite a bit to give us that boost of energy we need to get through our workouts or recovery afterwards. This is a great tasting and easy to make protein ball. You can mix up the additions to whatever you want. They are a great alternative to a pre-packaged granola bar. Give them a try you'll love them.

Love it! Motivated to grab this instead of a candy bar! I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of dark chocolate. I used natural peanut butter and added a tablespoon of organic cocao powder instead of protein powder. I did not need to chill before I rolled into balls. I mixed with gloved hands and formed balls right away. I chilled the balls. Next time, I'll double the recipe. Yummy!

I modified a bit based on what I had in my house.  I used 3/4 cup McCann's Quick Cooking Irish Oatmeal and 1/4 cup Ezekiel 4:9 sprouted grain almond cereal (for added crunch).  I also used Honey in the Rough because I don't like the strong taste of other honeys.  Added  1 teaspoon of maple syrup, a couple of yellow raisins, and because I did not have dark chocolate, used milk chocolate. These were outrageously delicious!

I made this recipe without the Chia seeds. I heard they can add a bit of a sweeter taste. I'm rating this 5 stars even though I didn't care for it because I do not like honey, but I'm going to make them again with syrup. I think this is a great recipe and very convenient for when you are on the go that you just can open the fridge and grab a bite. My husband absolutely loved This recipe.

This is great.  I was looking for some way to combine ground up coffee and dark chocolate together and this is the perfect medium.  I have made it twice now, following the recipe to a tee, outside of adding the coffee, and really happy with it.  To shake things up a bit, think I'm going to try a dash of cayenne pepper in the next batch.

I've made these a ton of times.  I use flax seeds instead of chia seeds.  I have never used protein powder because I don't believe in that, but I do use semi sweet chocolate.  But what I do is mix all the ingredients over heat.  Mix everything until the chocolate has melted.  Seems easier to handle and mixes everything together.  Always turns out delicious.

Really good! Doubled the protein powder and lessened the honey. Used ground flax meal since that's what I head and only about 1/2 of the chopped chocolate. Also split peanut butter with 1/2 almond butter. Delish!

Kind of like a no-bake cookie that didn't get pressed down.  Yummy and some healthier ingredients.  They always get eaten up fast!

This is AMAZING!!! We didn't roll it into balls but just ate it like cookie dough with a spoon. It tasted exactly like cookie dough! We are planning on making like 500 of these and freezing them so we can thaw them as needed because I know they'll be a regular snack in our home!

Great!  I used chunky almond butter instead of peanut butter.  I also added a little cacao powder, vanilla, and almond extract.

Best snack for when you're craving something sweet. I always have these on hand in my fridge and one is just enough! I usually let the dough set up in the fridge for a couple hours and let it sit on the counter for about 10 minutes before rolling the balls. I spray my hands with a little cooking spray to avoid sticky fingers.

I thought they were very dry and difficult to roll into balls. I think substituting a banana in to help bind the ingredients would be a good substitution

Great recipe.  I used ground flax seeds, semi sweet chocolate chips, and organic natural maple syrup instead of honey. those were my only substitutions.  Still used the chia seeds and a peanut butter-chocolate protejn powder. Oh, and bit of vanilla extract.  They came out great.

These are good.  I added a little more peanut butter-- just because I like it--and took out a little honey to compensate.  I also added coconut.

I have NEVER adulterated a recipe so bad in my life. I’m gluten free and most of what I had or what I could get didn’t match up, so it became a guideline! I used gf oats, the pb powder with chocolate added (no need for chocolate chunks then) I needed a way to reconstitute the PB powder so I used coconut oil! I had no flax seed and my chia seeds had possible cross contamination so I omitted this time. I did use less honey but I didn’t measure. They turned out fantastically! Especially for what I need them for! I’ll definitely add the chia seeds and flax seed when I can find them. Sorry for the change around but I figured that if someone is digging for this in a gf search, there is hope.

Really good but I did not gave chocalte chips so I use extra scoop of the whey protein and added some brown sugar and extra honey. One thing to make the calls easier is you need to refrigerate first and then use an ice cream scoop to help shape them.

Easy to make and taste great.
I used crunchy peanut butter, and quick oat and mini chocolate chips and did not have chia seeds. Those were what I had on hand. Tasted great. Hubby even liked. It is a keeper.

I made this I don't usually rate a recipe if I make changes but since it was such a minor change I thought I would. The only change I made was using extra flax seed in place of chia seed, and that's just because I didn'tave any chia seed I think this would be an easy recipe to adjust if you wanted to add nuts or substitute fruit for the chocolate.... possibilities are endless!

I add flaked coconut and butterscotch chips, as well as the chocolate chips. I only use the flax seed, not the chia(?).  Makes fabulous no guilt sweet snack. My family raves about them.

I only had vanilla protein powder on hand, so I used this and added a couple of Tbsp. of cocoa.  I opted not to add the chocolate chips and these were still delicious.

I doubled the recipe to start because I'm counting Macros & having a severe sweet tooth!  I didn't really measure the seeds or flax. I also didn't have the amount of honey I needed so I substituted a little maple  syrup (eye balled it).  Ohhhh man!!  I had a small sample.  I cannot wait to eat these tomorrow!  Now it's going to be about portion control!

We all love these! They taste yummy & are FULL of a powerhouse of healthy stuff. I also added pistachios (rough chop), bee pollen,  raw shelled hemp seeds, & half almond butter & half peanut butter. I LOVE these! Great when you're super busy to just grab, go, & NOT get hangry.

I made it as written and they are 5 stars hands down.  Quadrupled it right away because I knew they'd be good, but had no idea they would be this good!  Almost like a no bake cookie taste without the guilt.  I also added coconut to a batch and wow.  They are delicious frozen but delicious room temp as well!  I plan on trying nuts and butterscotch chips because the possibilities are endless!

Yummy! I did add 1/2 c. unsweetened shredded coconut and use cocoa nibs instead of dark chocolate. These are quick to mix up and after chilling, easy to roll into balls.

These are delicious and super easy to make! The only substitution I made was swapping cacao nibs for the chocolate chips (because I’m avoiding processed sugar for a few weeks to see how I feel. I used 2 tablespoons and it added a really nice crunch. :) They are great for a quick breakfast, pre or post workout, or just a sweet treat. Make these now!!

I didn't have flax seeds on hand, so I made it without. I thought the consistency was perfect after cooling in the fridge as recommended. These will be a staple in my house full of people on the go!

For a protein ball these were pretty good.

Hint: If you divide into 10 servings the balls end up being a little bigger than a golf ball.

I added an entire scoop of protein, rather than just a Tbsp. I also took someones suggestion and added some vanilla & almond extract. They did not mention the amount, I used 1/8 tsp, could have used even a little less.

I'm freezing these to last longer, as I'm the only one who will be eating them.

Love this recipe! I usually double it or triple it and freeze the extra.  I pop a couple in a Ziploc bag for the kids to take as a snack for school.  I do make a couple changes...I use flax meal rather than flax seed and instead of protein powder, I use peanut butter powder.   I also recommend warming the honey and peanut butter to make mixing everything together easier but then you'll want to pop the mixture into the fridge for 30 minutes or so to get it to cool down and firm up before adding the chocolate chips and forming into balls.

My family loved these! I made a surprise energy version by adding a chocolate covered espresso bean in the middle of the ball. I also used vanilla protein instead of chocolate and added white chocolate chips, dried berries and mini chocolate chips. These were great and did not last long. Thanks for the recipe!

I make these every other day for my family! My kids eat these for breakfast every morning.  A lot healthier than cereal or frozen waffles.  I use semi sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate and make sure to use coarsely ground flax seeds.

I made these with a few substitions.  Used ground flaxmeal instead of flax seeds.  I was short on honey so I added sugar-free salted caramel Torani syrup.  Used chunky peanut butter.  The mixture seemed dry so I added a pureed banana, this was OK but next time I will be sure to have enough honey before I make these as the banana flavor was overpowering.   Thanks for the recipe!  Can't wait to make these again!

Very good. Added about 1 Tbsp of Cocoa instead of protein and added a little espresso powder to 1/2. Did not use chia seeds because I didn't have any and used ground flax.

My flax seeds were ground so texture probably a little different.  Yes I will make it again.  Good snack.

These were really yummy. I had to make a couple of changes. I added a couple of tablespoons of water to make them stick and worked great. I didn't have dark chocolate but had white chocolate chips. I will make these again! Thanks!

Since I have been eating healthier food, I find it hard to find treats to satisfy my sweet tooth.  This works well!  So easy too.  Because I cannot tolerate much oatmeal, I replaced 3/4 C with almond meal and added some coconut and reduced the honey.  I also added some carob powder since I only had vanilla protein powder.  How satisfying.  Thanks for a great recipe that one can adapt to their own needs.

Followed the recipe except for chocolate protein powder. Didn't want to buy a full tub for this. Used powdered peanut butter for a little extra protein instead.

Fast, easy, healthy and maybe a little over 100 calories each - plus once you have the ingredients, you can throw this together without running to the store.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE these!!' I have a horrible sweet tooth and these do a great job satisfying those urges. I use them as a preworkout snack first thing in the morning and they're awesome...I have yet to get tired of them. I am going to try cacao chocolate powder instead of baking chocolate for the health benefits..I'll update this week as I make them (a week supply every week) every weekend

Extremely tasty! The only part I didn't quite like was the peanut butter and oats were very tough to mix together, especially as someone with tachycardia. Next time I'd soften the peanut butter.

I didn't have flax seeds, so I just doubled the chia seeds. I also doubled the protein powder. Best tasting protein balls I've ever had, they were like miniature desserts!

These were amazing!  I used organic peanut butter and natural honey.  I omitted the chai  since I didn't have any on hand.    I ground the flax as recommended and used semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I agree that these protein balls taste a lot  like no-bake cookies.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I suggest doubling the recipe since it makes a small batch.

Yummy!  I made these and everyone loved them!  I didn't add the protein powder and I doubled the recipe from the start.  My daughter and her friends usually love my chocolate chip cookies, they gladly changed to these for a healthy snack.

I have a large tub of vanilla whey powder that I try to get rid of (hate the taste in smoothies) and this works fantastic! The basic recipe is great. I don't like peanut butter so I subbed flaked almonds and coconut oil. And I ground the oats and added dessicated coconut. I only added 3 tbsp of honey, as the coconut is sweet and so is the whey powder. (I added only one spoonful because I didn't want to taste it) I used finely chopped dark chocolate instead of chocolate chips, that kind of mixed in the batter and covered the whey powder taste. The coconut oil gets very hard in the fridge so I didn't cool the mixture, just let it rest for a while and made small balls that I rolled in the dessicated coconut. They turned out beautiful and looked like small bonbons!

Made these for myself, and my family swooped-in and ate them as well. A big hit around here. These even pass for an after dinner sweet in place of cookies. 
Made them according to directions, but also with flax seed oil when I lacked called-for ingredients. Both ways were great and this is a keeper.

I made these Chocolate Protein Balls exactly to the recipe. The only thing I changed was the dark chocolate - I used semi-sweet mini chocolate chips as those are pantry staples (in my kitchen) and easier than chopping chocolate, and uniform in size.

 I use a 1" scoop, and they were easy to get onto the plate.  

I did not give this 5 stars simply because they are sticky, even right out of the fridge. But, I guess that makes them "finger licking good."  I will try to roll some in the chocolate protein powder to give them a less sticky touch. And, next time, I will probably quarter each ball, so that they are single bite sized pieces instead of having to hold them in my fingers - in an effort to reduce the need to lick my fingers.

Also, when I make them again, I will grind the chia and flax seeds (also pantry staples in our kitchen) into a flour in an effort to reduce the seeds sticking in my teeth.

I have a daughter (will be 14 next month) who weighs more than I do, and I feel this is a snack that she can consume all day long without me feeling guilty.

I did look at all the different "protein" powders in the health food store near the house.  I looked at the ratio of protein grams/serving verses total grams/serving. 
The very expensive protein powders were considerably lower in protein/gram than the simple whey powder. That was the deciding factor in my purchase.  When my daughter asked me about the protein powder, I recited the poem about Little Miss Muffet and then showe

This is my go-to recipe base for protein balls. I usually add 1/4 cup coconut, a tsp organic cocoa powder, and 1/4 c dark chocolate chips . I like a bit extra peanut butter for that reason so that the mixture is pliable not dry. I coat the rounded balls with the chia seed for extra nutritional kick. Once they sit in the frig the oatmeal absorbs the oil from the peanut butter and the honey so they are firm. Usually I put 3 in my sons lunch and 2 in mine.

My family really enjoyed these, even a picky eater who only eats cheese and pasta in various forms! I used maple syrup in place of the honey because it was what I had on hand. The balls come together quickly and I found I did not need to refrigerate the mix before forming balls. I use a small scoop which makes the job quick and neat.

Really great recipe. I can pretty much sneak anything in here I want and my 5 year old will eat it. I didn't have flax seeds so I used shredded unsweetened coconut. I also just use Carob chips or chocolate chips for the chocolate and add a half teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder. Scrumtrulescent!!!! Great recipe to experiment with.

I didn't use the chia seeds and I used 2tbs of Nutella instead of the chocolate protein powder. Delish!!!! All of my kids loved them! Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely love these. Super easy to make I just hate how they get mushy once they start to get warm.

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first but I will make these again. So easy, quick and healthy. I followed the recipe to a T.
