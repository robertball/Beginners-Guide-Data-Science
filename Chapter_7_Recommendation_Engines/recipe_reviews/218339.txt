No matter how I tried to resist the pull to use a substitution, I simply could not wait another day to make these with a pack of gruyere I had in the fridge. The recipe sounds so easy and delicious, and so it is! The making was mess-free, I used the smallest cookie cutter I had, and transferred the crackers to the parchment with a butter knife to avoid breaking them. They turned out beautifully crispy and golden (the ones rolled thinnest were the best), and the backgound wiff of cayenne pepper complimented ever so delicately to the aroma and taste. Mmmm... Will make again. And again.

Instead of white flour I used wheat- they don't look the best but I love whole wheat flour. Instead of 1.5 all purpose flour, I used 1c.+3TBSP of wheat flour. I doubled the cayenne pepper and they are delicious! I think next time I'll try using less butter to cut fat and calories. I also added a little milk because the dough was dry at first.
A tip for rolling them- if you don't mind how they look, I placed the dough on the baking sheet (no parchment paper, just oil/non stick spray) and smashed it as flat as I could with my hands. Then I put plastic wrap on top of it and rolled it, to avoid having the dough stick to the roller. After it was flat, (remember it's already on the baking sheet) I cut them into little squares. I also dashed salt on them like real Cheese Nips. After they were baked and a little crispy, I retraced the lines with the knife and voila, little square cheese nips!
Even though I changed the recipe a bit, they are delicious, and now with the added benefit of wheat flour!

These are very good and easy to make.  I did not want to mess with the cookie cutters and having them break so I shaped mine into 2 round logs and chilled in the fridge for about an hour.  Then I sliced them into 1/4 inch rounds and baked.  Who would have thought, cheese cookies.  Next time I'm going to double the cayenne pepper.

This is one of those recipe you make, just to say you tried it. It is like making homemade ketchup or marshmallow fluff. Both are common and cheap grocery store shelf staples. I decided to make a 1/2 recipe to try it. They really did taste like Cheese Nips from the grocery store. The texture was a little harder like a homemade cracker but the taste was similar. I only had whipped dairy butter and low fat cheese, but they ended up working with no problem. My issue, I have with the recipe, is I made only 1/2 recipe but it still took 2 hours to make. It was really time consuming to roll just the one ball of dough out repeatedly to 1/8" thick and cut small crackers out of it. A regular cookie cutter, although quicker, would have been way too big. I broke the dough into 4 pieces to work with it and rolled it on a plastic cutting board. I didn't need the extra flour to roll it out. I ended up yielding about 1 1/2 cups of small crackers. They did taste better than expected, just a lot of work, but fun to try to make anyway.

This was a really good recipe.  I used cheddar and parmesan and swiss and also added about a tablespoon of beer and then cracked black pepper instead of cayenne.  The taste was very good.  Im sure every body else knows this but I discovered that most cookie presses have an attachment for this sort of cracker/cookie. (surprise!) For me this ones a keeper.  Ill definitely make them again.

I found these to taste more like a biscut than a cracker. I would have liked more of a cheese flavor. If I try again I would refrigerate in a log and then slice with dental floss as thin as I could get them.

I cajunized this recipe because I was trying to recreate the ones I had as a kid.  The original recipe was way too dry!  I added about 1/2 a carton of Philladelphia Cooking Cream.  I also added 1/2 tsp black pepper.  I cut them thicker so they wouldn't be so crispy and would have more of a cookie consistency.

I followed the recipe. This is why I gave it a 5 star. Several people said the crackers took a while to make, I disagree. It's quick! (I'm potty training a 2-year old, don't have time to be in the kitchen.) I did it in two steps. First, combine the ingredients and threw the dough in a zip lock bag and put in the refrigerator. (That took 10mins tops!) Second, when my son was taking his nap, I rolled out the dough, used cookie cutters, and popped it in the oven. (2 large cookie sheets made all the crackers.) So that was 30mins of baking. In my opinion, they were amazing, but the son didn't like them. I wouldn’t say they were hot, but the crackers do have a “little kick” 2 seconds after you eat it. (Enough “kick” that they son spit it out and wanted a drink.)  I made a second batch for him, using regular pepper instead of cayenne pepper. I also ran out of real butter and used spreadable butter. FOLLOW THE RECIPE! Don’t substitute the butter! Instead of being crisp/flaky, they are chewy.  They are still edible, but they just don’t have the cracker texture.

Delicious but I agree they are time consuming. A good thing to make when you feel like baking but want something savory :)

Used small Wilton cookie cutters in fall shapes for a Thanksgiving snack.  These turned out delicious! I accidentally doubled the cayenne pepper and they were kind of like the tabasco cheeze itz. Very good!

Wanted a recipe to use in a wreath pan instead of cookie dough. Pressed in mold a little thicker than 1/4". Worked wonderfully. Decorated with pesto, pimento, and bacon cream cheese.

A family friend used to bring her delicious homemade cheddar crackers to us when she visited during the holidays. I was hoping to find a recipe so I could make them myself and this one is perfect! I’ve made them numerous times since I first tried the recipe a few months ago and they are always delicious. I recommend buying a high quality cheddar cheese rather than a grocery store brand -- the better cheese makes a tastier cracker.

Made this exactly as written. These have great cheesy flavor. The dough came together easily kneading by hand. The only thing I will do differently next time is roll them out thinner & cut them smaller. Overall a tasty homemade treat. Thanks for the recipe. I will make these again.

it was generally well received, and i got compliments, but I'm not giving it 5 stars because i was a little disappointed myself. My fault to be expecting too much, I guess. I followed the recipe and also some advice from other cooks: the cheese was gruyere (too expensive by far to be used like that) and I used freshly milled wild pepper (not the regular little black grain, but sort of uneven grain, much more flavoured). I put some milk in the dough, otherwise not even the mixer would have been able tob otain a dough; I replaced half of the White flour with wholegrain for a more nutty texure and added healtness. I put the dough in teh fridge for 1 hour and then I sliced it thinly with dental floss to get some very round and cute crackers. All went perfectly well but the result, however good, was not spectacular: they lacke the kick I was expecting. I will try with more cheese, and perhaps parmesan will do the trick?

Delicious.  Followed recipe ingredients exactly, but have a few tips for the next parts.  First, do not heavily flour the rolling surface.  It makes the dough dry and hard to roll out.  Instead, form the dough in a ball in the food processor bowl or silicone/wax paper sheet.  After that, lightly flour your rolling surface and rolling pin.  Second, don't mess around with little cookie cutters (I did and it took forever); cut cheese "sticks" (I did some of those, too, and it was super fast).  Finally, third, bake plenty long so they are crispy.  I followed the bake time in the recipe and it required reheating the nippers over the next few days as we at them. Used both table salt and malden sea salt.  Table salt was just fine and easier to use.

I have to eat low carbs right now so I split the 1 1/2 cups of flour into thirds (almond, coconut, and whole wheat flour). I also found it too dry so I added a splash of milk. They are very cheesy, happy with the result.

Family loves it! Was very easy and quick. The longest part was the rolling out and cutting. I stayed homemade and just used my handy pizza cutter to make my cracker shapes.
