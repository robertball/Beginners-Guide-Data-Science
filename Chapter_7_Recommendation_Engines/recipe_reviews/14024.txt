This would be a solid four or maybe even a five, if not for a few key ingredient oversights. 1. Balsamic vinegar? In a Japanese dish? Seriously. Only use rice vinegar. 2. Not nearly as bad as 1; use brown sugar instead of white, the flavor is richer and compliments the soy sauce ten times better. 3. 1/2 cup of sesame seeds is a ridiculous amount. I used more noodles than recommended and still only needed 1/4 of the sesame seeds. Use about 2 tablespoons. And don't bother baking them. Throw them in a dry pan and toast them over the stove for a few minutes on medium heat, shaking the pan ever few minutes until they are golden. Other than that, a good recipe. Easy to make, easy to improvise and adjust to personal tastes by simply varying the veggies. And with some minor adjustments, quite yummy.

Delicious!! My teen just made me promise I will make this once every week. I stir-fried snow-peas, julienned carrots and sliced mushrooms in 1 tsp oil and added to the soba. And served it topped with grilled prawns on skewers! Exotic combination.

I LOVE this, reminds me of a salad we had in the Deli I worked at. I used blanched julienned carrots and bell peppers and sugar snap peas, and omitted the broccoli. I toasted the sesame seeds on a low flame in a fry pan. I also doubled it for the leftovers.

Could have been a 5 stars with a few changes:  1. Use rice vinegar 2. Double the sauce 3. Start with 2 TBsp sesame seeds and see if you want to add more. 1/2 cup is way too much.

Best noodle dish I've ever had:)  Add one grilled chicken breast strips and red/yellow pepper strips (nuked in microwave for 1 min) and mix it with the noodle and sit overnight in the fridge.  Reheat in microwave for about 1 min for luke warm and serve! YUMMY and healthy!! Ty for the wonderful recipe.  BTW, you can stir fry sesame seeds in a dry heated wok for about 1-2 minutes with constant stirring instead of using oven.

I found this delicious and would definitly recommend it. However, I served it hot and would suggest adding some fried shallots. YUM!

Sorry, but I really didn't like this. The sauce smelled good while I was making it, but as soon as I mixed in the noodles, all I could smell was the vinegar. I decided to try it anyway, and let it sit for 30 minutes as the recipe suggests, but it still tasted vinegar-y, and I thought there were far too many sesame seeds. Maybe I did something wrong? Thanks for the post anyway.

This was very good.  I added extra noodles, when 8 ounces looked like a very meager amount.  I also added chicken and thinly sliced cucumbers.  It was similar to noodle bowls we ate when we were living in Australia.  I might opt to add some sliced cabbage in place of the broccoli (which I did steam lightly) next time.  Definitely one to work with.

Very good, tasty recipe although we did alter it a little. We used balsamic vinegar instead of Chinese vinegar and we doubled the "sauce" ingredients since my husband likes sauce with everything. Also, we didn't wait for it to get to room temperature although I am sure it is good at room temperature also. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great easy recipe. I subbed rice vinegar for the balsamic and added honey because I didn't have white sugar. I know I will be making this again.

If you want to eat a healthy dish, you've got one here! The dressing is very good; subtly sweet and nice addition of sesame and sesame oil.  I also added cooked and cubed chicken and chopped mango. This turned out to be a healthy yet hearty meal itself. I became a fan of soba noodles.

This is the best soba recipe that I have tried.  If you have time, I would steam the broccoli for 3 or 4 minutes.  Very fast, very good.

I could not find soba noodles in my local grocery store and didn't have gas to travel to another speciality store. I used regular spaghetti noodles. To make it more....asian, I used rice vinegar. I also used low-salt soy sauce and I increased the garlic to 8 cloves. I threw in a handful of cilantro and about a tsp. of ginger at the end. I'm really glad I eyeballed the sauce ingredients as I think that the amount called for just wouldn't have been enough. What I normally do with this kind of dish is make it in the morning and let it sit during the day to soak up that great sauce. My husband taste tested it halfway through and offered to go back and taste test it several more times.....so I would say that so far, it's a hit. I'm serving this with Cinnamon Pork Tenderloin (we'll....pork chops, not tenderloin).

Yum!  Followed recipe with one additional step.  I placed the chopped broccoli into the collander and drained soba over broccoli.  This provided just enough heat and steam to bring out the tenderness and vibrant green of the broccoli.

A mere sprinkle of sesame seeds rather than 2 T. is appropriate in my mind, but to each his own I guess, even tho' the amount directed seems just a tad exorbitant - and the reason why I rate this four stars rather than five.  I don't care for raw broccoli, so I dumped it, along with some fresh sliced mushrooms and chunks of red bell pepper, into the pan of soba noodles during the last couple minutes of cooking time.  The sauce was excellent, tho' I couldn't help adding a little butter to the dish at the end.  Maybe not traditional, but I dug it.

I was really craving a cold noodles dish and this is both delicious and healthy!  I think the recipe ingredients may have changed at some point, as reviews stated that cookers subbed balsamic for the rice vinegar and vice versa.  Anyway, with that in mind, I used 1T of balsamic, 2T of rice vinegar and 1T of rice wine (along with 5T soy sauce and 2T sesame seed oil, 1.5T sugar, a 2 cloves of garlic), as I doubled the sauce per many suggestions.  This is a very versatile dish and any desired veggies can be added.  I had leftover steamed zucchini, summer squash and red pepper and it went very well with the sauce and the noodles.  I also added imitation crab to my individual serving (not to the whole dish, as it goes bad fairly quickly and I didn't want to ruin my leftovers!).  The crab goes really well with the delicate taste.  Great submission- thanks, Jessica!

Use rice vinegar instead of balsamic, brown sugar instead of white. Use 2 tbs of sesame seeds instead. blanch veggies for a few minutes.

Not exactley the same as you get in an Asian restaurant but still very good. I sub'd the broccoli out with a mixture of blanched slivered carrots, bok choy, water chestnuts and peas (the vegetable part is forgiving, use what you like). I also used rice vinegar in place of balsamic (balsamic is however very similar to Asian black vinegar so you shouldn't not use it because you think you have to use rice vinegar).  1/2 c. sesame seeds I thought was too much, 1/4 c. was plenty and they toasted in very little time. I enjoyed this most after it was chilled and rested for 8+ hours. I know I will make this again.

Great with these adjustments: 2 T sesame seeds (1/2 cup is WAY too many), half the amount of noodles, rice vinegar instead of balsamic, brown sugar instead of white.  Also added finely diced purple cabbage which made it beautiful and added texture. I quickly sauteed some shrimp in garlic and butter and threw that in as well. We ate it warm (didn't want to wait for everything to cool!) and even my children liked it.  Would make great leftovers eaten cold....but we didn't have anything leftover!

I made this based on the beautiful photo, but mine did not look like this! I should've gone with my gut instinct, this had way too many noodles. I should've used half the amount. I'll try it again using less noodles, and I'm sure it'll be better. I added tofu, but next time I'll add chopped carrots too.

Simple and tasty.  I would make again.  Instead of balsamic, I used 1 tbsp of white wine and 1 tbsp of rice vinegar.  I also added a little grated ginger and chili paste.  I toasted the sesame in a dry skillet.

I used this recipe as a base. I sauted chicken in butter with a little garlic salt. and i also sauted broccoli, mushrooms, chopped celery and grated carrots. I doubled the sauce and added 10 oz of boiled thin spaghetti noodles to the meat and veggies and poured the sauce on top. It was delicious. thanks for the recipe.

I made some poor choices when preparing this recipe that hurt the taste.  However, I'm giving it five stars because every part of the dish that was true to the recipe tasted great.  My worst decision was to substitute frozen asian veggies for the broccoli and green onions.  They just weren't good quality.  I also tried to use black sesame seeds because those were what I had on hand, but I couldn't tell when they were toasted properly and I burned the first batch.  Rather than risking burning the rest of my sesame seeds, I just added them without toasting.  That probably affected the flavor.  Anyway, I'm not going to penalize my rating of this recipe for my poor choices.  I think it would have been very good if I had followed the recipe more closely.

Very good recipe to start with, just made a few tweaks (personal preference) to the sauce.  I'd also advise, it does NOT take 10-12 minutes to toast sesame seeds at that oven temperature - maybe half that time.  But this was a good, easy recipe that I'll definitely keep making and modifying!

Very tasty.  Sauteed sliced mushrooms, halved baby carrots, and thinly sliced green cabbage in place of broccoli and used rice vinegar in place of balsamic. The only soba noodles I could find were buckwheat-yam; used parsley to perk up the appearance.

My husband and I both liked this recipe, although we made a few modifications.  We blanched the broccoli, decreased the sesame seeds to 2-3 Tbsp (1/2 cup was a little overwhelming, and my husband thinks we should add 2 Tbsp of peanut butter to the sauce the next time we prepare it.  We will definately be making this recipe with a few minor modifications again!

Went to the Japanese grocery and got all of the ingredients, Followed the recipe to the "t" and won't make it again.  The sweetness of the vinegar and sugar completely defeated the smokey savory flavors of the soy and sesame.  This hodge podge of flavors lacked subtlety, turned my stomach and left us looking for something else to eat to make up for a terrible dinner.

My thoughts: Omit or reduce white sugar.  Substitute Tamari (a darker stronger soy sauce) for regular soy.  And for goodness sake... ORDER OUT.

Substituted balsamic with rice wine vinegar and added fresh ginger.  Doubled the amount of sugar.  Used frozen stir-fry mix instead of broccoli and added frozen edename for protein.  Stir fried the veggies in sesame oil and garlic before adding the soba and sauce.  Served it hot.

We made some substitutions as others have recommended (brown sugar instead of white, and rice vinegar instead of balsamic), and we added blanched snow peas, red pepper, and green beans. With these additions, I thought this made a really nice accompaniment to our main dish (orange ginger tofu from this site).  We did not, however, save the leftovers since neither my husband or I thought this would be good on it's own the next day.  It was also a bit pricey - the sesame seeds alone (which we cut back on per others' suggestions) were over $7.  Considering that, and the fact that the children wouldn't touch it, we will not likely make this one again.

I did as other suggested, using rice wine vinegar and brown sugar. I doubled the sauce, used 12oz noodles and stir fried together with shitake mushrooms and red peppers. It was a big hit and made for great left overs.

Yum!  We loved this. I used rice wine instead of balsamic, brown sugar instead of white and asparagus and red bell pepper in place of broccoli. So delicious. Will definitely make again.

we didn't have onions so not sure how the full recipe tastes. however, sans onions, it was still delish. i made the given sauce amt with 6 oz of noods and the ratio seemed just right. sauce got absorbed in 15 minutes! instead of broccoli, i sauteed snow pea leaves in sesame oil and braggs amino acids (which i also used instead of soy for the noodle sauce). keep in mind: raw garlic is delicious but no joke. if you will be smooching, make sure it's not a first date food. ;) thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving it 3 stars as we found it pretty bland.  I did blanch the broccoli first, would definitely recommend doing that.  I think if I doubled the dressing, it would be better.  We also preferred it heated the next day.  I did use udon noodles as I couldn't find soba noodles, don't know what the difference - they do look the same.

We liked this. Interesting use of balsamic. I had to use a few less sesame seeds because I double the recipe and didn't have quite a  whole cup. I toasted my seeds in a frying pan - I didn't trust myself not to burn them in the oven. You'll want to add quite a bit more oil (sesame or other) to keep the noodles from soaking up all of the sauce. I also added a little more soy at the end. I used a prepackage veggie mix of broccoli, carrots and snow peas. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a delicious recipe! I did make some changes: stir fried the broccoli and green onions (and added carrots, and snow peas) and added grilled chicken. I also doubled the sauce (which wasn't necessary). It was delicious and we will be making this again soon.

I just made this tonight after a long day of work. I didn't have soba noodles so I used spagetti instead. I also use water chestnuts instead of brocolli and also added some cooked onions. It was very good especially with a splash of hot sauce and a dash of ginger powder.

I would have given this 3 stars, but my 7 year old daughter RAVED.  This definitely needs to sit for an hour or so at room temp to let the flavors meld.  It's missing a layer of flavor like some others suggested.  I added a grated carrot and julienne cucumber at the end.  I think next time I'll make the peanut sauce from the Satay Chicken from this site, leave it a little thin, then add about a half-cup to the sauce.  It's still pretty good cold the next day.

I love soba noodles but didn't have any when I decided to make this recipe so I used spaghetti.It worked fine.
I didn't add the broccoli (wasn't in the mood).My 7 year old couldn't get enough.
Great quick recipe.

I couldn't believe it, but I couldn't find Soba noodles at all. I substituted spinach pasta, doubled most of the spices and added some chile garlic sauce and it was a wonderful meal. Next time I'll probably add tofu, too. Also, I steamed the veggies and used broccoli, mushrooms and green peppers. Yummy!

This salad was tasty and fast. Next time I would add some julienned carrots and snap peas, and probably steam the broccoli lightly first. I also saw that someone else used honey instead of sugar, which makes the dressing less grainy - probably a good idea.

Very tasty. If you are a person that is not too keen on cold pasta this is a must try. I subbed rice vinegar and pea pods and added peanut butter.  Easy to throw together in the morning and store in the frig until dinnertime.  I did make a little extra of the sauce and also added water just before serving because the noodles do soak it up but a pasta to make over and over.

This was so much better the second day that I would highly recommend making it a day ahead and letting it sit to absorb the flavors. The first night, I thought it was too dry, needed more sauce, and was a bit bland, but it was delicious the next day--it was practically a different dish. I used agave nectar (an unrefined sweetener) instead of sugar. I don't like the texture of raw broccoli, so instead I used pea pods and baby bella mushrooms, which went well with the flavors.

I did as others recommended and cooked sesame seeds in a dry pan stove top and brown sugar instead of white.  I also hate raw broccoli so I stir fried it with added carrots in toasted sesame oil.  As usual I doubled the garlic.  Otherwise I followed instructions and this was delicious!  BTW keep the 1/2 cup of sesame seeds...yum!  Word of warning...if you overheat the pan or in my case iron skillet...sesame seeds pop like popcorn...no joke!  That means the heat is too high go medium.

Very good versatile recipe.  I doubled the sauce ingredients, using seasoned rice vinegar, 1/2 brown sugar, and about 3 Tablespoons sesame seeds.  Whole wheat linguine was the pasta I had available and that worked very well.  I stir fried half a small onion, and for veggies I used a frozen stir-fry mix, which I cooked lightly, since I was out of broccoli.  I might try marinating some tofu in the dressing first. next time I try it.  Thanks for a tasty recipe, Jessica!

In addition to the other reader's suggestions of cutting down on the sesame seeds and using rice vinegar, I used Coconut Aminos instead of soy sauce (soy allergies - u can buy it at Whole Foods or most health food stores), Coconut Syrup (low glycemic index, and neither of these coco products taste like coconut) instead of sugar, and I stir fried my veggies and noodles in this mixture (broccolini and kale), then added the sesame oil to my bowl when it was finished.  Pretty yummy!

I used half of the sugar (next time I will substitute maple syrup to make it 0 on glycemic index), doubled the noodle amount and tripled the sauce amount, then stir-fried it at the end. (Cook the soba noodles for only 3 minutes if you cook it this way and make sure to separate the soba noodles before placing them in the boiling water otherwise they stick together.) IT WAS FANTASTIC! I also added chili flakes and chicken and will add bell pepper next time. DELICIOUS! Hot, cold or room temperature.

I made this without the sesame seeds and found it much too sour... not sure if it has to do with the balsamic vinegar I used or that Soba is supposed to be very sour.

It didn't have the depth of flavor I was expecting from the sauce. Also - the sauce didn't really stick to the noodles, it went to the bottom of my bowl so that all I had were room-temp noodles and broccoli. I may try this again by heating the sauce on the stove top with some ginger and honey.

Good recipe but next time I'll double the liquid ingredients for the sauce.  I thought the pasta was a little dry and needed more.  The toasted sesame seeds were delicious - I did mine in the toaster oven for about 5 mins.  Very easy, but keep an eye on them.  Wish I had an egg roll with this dinner - next time!

I'm sure I probably would have liked this minus the sugar and cutting back on the basalmic. Really, thats all I tasted was basalmic and sugar. This didn't go over well in our house.

This dish had great flavor, but we didn't care for the noodles too much.  They remineded us of eating "worms".  Very chewy.  Maybe I cooked them wrong.  Either way, the flavor was great.  We'll just try using different noodles next time.

This was awesome! I was looking for another way to enjoy my soba noodles and this was it. Next time I will make double the sauce. I used brown sugar instead of white and added some corn starch to thicken it a bit. Wife loved it and she is not big on soba. Thanks

This recipes was a good basis for an easy meal but did need some tweaking.  It was really good hot but my family didn't like it cold. I steamed the broccoli and would add way more broccoli and some julienne carrots next time. I agree with the posters who said it could use some heat and it would be good with rice vinegar instead of balsamic.  Fish sauce might also be a worthwhile addition.  I tripled the sauce and marinated sliced chicken in the extra sauce. I cooked the chicken in the marinade with a couple of spoons full of peanut butter added for a satay style flavor. The peanut butter added an excellent layer of flavor to this sauce and the chicken was great.

Pretty good, but too much vinegar. I would use less next time. For veggies I used red, yellow, and green peppers along with some carrot and the green onion. I sauteed them for just a few minutes to soften them, but not too long as to keep a crunch. I may try again, but with less vinegar.

Excellent starter recipe.  It was definitely a little bland for our tastes, so I added a bit of oyster sauce, ginger and wasabi powder.  For the veggies I used raw spinach and deseeded sliced cucumber which gave it a nice crunch.  Also stirred in a can of dark tuna (Korean brand from Asian store).  Will definitely be making this again.

I couldn't find soba noodles at my grocery store (and they're usually pretty good about ethnic items), so I used whole grain linguini instead.  I added carrots and I steamed the veggies for about 4 minutes to partially cook them.  I think this tasted better than it would have raw.  I just eyeballed the amount of sesame seeds to add and I'm pretty sure I used far less than half a cup.  With my modifications, I really enjoyed this.  Tasted good both warm and cold.

I browned extra seeds and then I tripled the sauce and let it sit a bit longer in the extra sauce to absorb as much as possible into the noodles. I served it luke-warm... my roommate and boyfriend loved it!

I decided to blanch the broccoli first based on some reviewer's comments, but I think it would have been much better raw. You need the sharper flavor and crunch of raw broccoli to balance this salad. The dressing is absolutely delicious and would also make a good marinade.

Very nice recipe.  Made the following revisions based on others' suggestions: substituted Rice Wine Vinegar for the Balsamic; used half tamari and half low salt soy for the soy component; sauteed the broccoli, a couple cups of chopped napa cabbage, a couple stalks of thinly diagonally sliced celery, one can of rinsed asian mushrooms until slightly softened and heated through; tossed the sauteed veggies with the cooked noodles and sauce; topped with cilantro, scallions, and sesame seeds to taste.

Nothing amazing but good and filling. I used a 16oz. package of stir fry veggies which was about the right balance with noodles. I also doubled the sauce and served hot.

This is a good recipe to use as a starting point.  I changed the veggies, used twice the dressing and added some sweet/hot thai chili sauce and peanut butter to get another layer of flavor.  I will make it again.

I just made this recipe and I'm gonna' go make it again when I'm done with this bowl for work tomorrow.

I substituted rice vinegar for the balsamic and finely diced onion since I didn't have the green. I also added a little garlic powder.

Definitely try every vegetable but make sure they're dry. I blanched some green beans and the water in them diluted the dressing quite a lot.

The way I just tore into this salad though, you'd think I had an 800# displayed across my chest to call and feed the hungry. I'm going to make more now.

This was an exceptionally good asian dish. The only thing to consider is measurements for the sauce: I just doubled all liquids.  For us this minor adjustment seemed to do the trick.  Overall a wonderful recipe.

This is a nice, LIGHT dish, which is typical of many asian noodle dishes  - especially cold ones. Yum yum! I made this dish two days in a row! The second time I substituted the balsamic vinegar for rice wine vinegar, and the result was an even lighter taste. Although both are good, I think I'll stick to the balsamic.  :) Thank you for sharing!

I absolutely loved this recipe. Not vinegary at all. Use balsamic only and stick to the recipe amounts. I didn't have broccoli but I did have some cold leftover chicken. I shredded the chicken and threw it in with the dressing. By the time the noodles were done and drained, the chicken took on a lovely brown coloring and flavor. Sesame seeds are the key to this recipe, don't skimp if you don't have to!

as a vegetarian, i am always looking for new and tasty dishes to serve my family

the flavor was somewhat on the sweet side, but overall rather bland.
i'm glad i was not cooking this for company.

Very tasty. Only changes I made were to reduce the amount of sesame seeds a bit (to save calories) and to cook the broccoli a bit. I think next time I'll add some shredded carrots to this. Very yummy. I served this with some chinese chicken and broccoli.

I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the sugar.  The combination makes for a strange taste.

I served this to my husband and a house guest, and I thought I'd have enough for left overs... wrong, they ate every last drop.  What more could you ask for - inexpensive, quick, easy and yummy.

This was very tasty!  Next time I think I'll use rice vinegar but it was good with balsamic.  I added lots of veggies as it was meant to be a main course.  When I first started making this, I didn't realize it was a cold dish, I'm so glad I caught that just as I was about to saute my veggies!

The soba noodles were great, but it needs a bit more sauce (a bit dry as leftovers 1-2 days later) and some other vegetables (julienned carrots or snowpeas).  The broccoli florets should be cut small because they don't soften and could be contributing to the dryness.  This makes more than 4 servings - at least 5.

Amazing! I spent a year in Japan and was eager to try making my own soba noodles when I got back. I left out the broccoli (as it would be on the side in a traditional Japanese dish). Both my husband and my Japanese friend loved it and had only good things to say. Definitely going to make again and share the recipe with others.

Tasty.  Your basic Asian type sauce.  Soba noodles are so good for you so I make this and my kids eat it too.  FYI, you can buy roasted sesame seeds at an Asian food market.  I used brown sugar with mine.

Cook your sesame seeds in a dry skillet where you can watch and stir them. Much more control. This recipe only needs about 1/4 cup of seeds.  I found the whole recipe way too bland and flavorless.

Great light meal!  I used rice vinegar and added 1 shredded chicken breast, 1 thinly sliced carrot, and used shredded napa cabbage in place of the broccoli.  I think you could really use whatever veggies you have on hand and this would still be delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

delicious! I found these noodles at H-mart and thought I would be adventurous by buying them. What a great move! I added stir fried chicken just to make it more of a meal than a side dish for the family. This will be made again and again!

I had a 12 oz pkg of soba so ended up triple on the sauce.  Used half balsamic, half rice vinegar. Added carrots, mushrooms and zucchini along with the broccoli, each lightly steamed and/or stir fried before tossing.  I didn't have near 1/2 cup of sesame seeds but thought I'd be OK, probably won't use 1/2 cup next time but will use a lot more than the appx 2T that I had, the toasted seeds really make everything else better.  Made for a great meatless meal. The kiddos loved this and were so happy to take the leftovers for lunch today.

First of all, I had no broccoli, so I used peas and a couple green beans instead. I also didn't have fresh garlic, so I had to use garlic powder. I probably used 1/8 Cup of sesame seeds and that was more than enough. I would go easy on the balsamic vinegar. It was just okay, so we kept adding stuff to it through out the meal. The sliced ham and salted scrambled egg gave our pallets a pleasant break from being overpowered by the noodle sauce.

Soo-ba yummie!   I added a veggie stir-fry as recommended by others (carrots, broccoli, onions, mushrooms, & baked tofu); and poured on a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, & fresh ginger at the very end.   I liked the presentation, and turns out those soba noodles are pretty nutritious and high in protein.  I'd definitely like to use this recipe again.  Thanks!

You can do several things with this recipe... I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I substituted for red wine vinegar and it tasted just as delicious. Also, you can add cooked chicken (fake chicken for vegetarians)in the end, and it tastes absolutely delicious with it. Nice filling, but not heavy meal on a hot day

This was good. I left out the veggies and just made the noodles and it was awesome. A family favorite that I know I will be making again and again. Served with Melt in your Mouth Porkchops (on this site) and steamed veggies.

This was really great.

I doubled the sauce and added carrots to the broccoli.  I also sauteed the vegetables briefly and served the dish hot.

I also used Udon vs Soba noodles because that's what I had on hand.

Good stuff.

This is a very quick and easy way to prepre soba.  I used Chinese black vinegar, and otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time I will make more sauce, and lightly steam the broccoli.  Also, I will try with peas and mushrooms.  I am very interested in trying cold leftovers tomorrow.  Thanks.

This is one of my favorite recipes for Soba noodles.  I alsways make this New Year's.  In Japan it is considered good luck to eat Soba noodles, the longer the better. Everybody always wants more.  For such a simple recipe it sure is a crowd pleaser. Yummmm!

It's edible. I didn't have any sesame seeds or green onions, but I followed everything else except letting it sit for a half hour and I wasn't really happy with it. My impression is that the culprit is the vinegar, but in any case, I'm taking it out of the recipe box. I'm glad so many others enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe.

Sesame seeds are overpowering. I'd suggest cutting the called for amount in half or even by a quarter. I also thought the sauce was missing something I can't put my finger on... ginger, maybe?

This was good, though I tried doubling the recipe and there wasn't enough sauce for the noddles.  I think I'll give it another shot at the posted amounts.  I also like a bit more veggies with my noddles.  I lightly steamed the broccoli before I added it this time.  I'll do it again but maybe add some seeded cucumber, maybe some carrot, oh, and perhaps some cilantro.

I did quite a bit to this recipe. I sauteed asparagus, carrot, and bell pepper. Then I added the sauce ingredients plus some fish sauce and some cooking wine.

This dressing is great. It's so light and can taste good with almost anything you add to it. I added cucumbers, pea shoots, tofu, sliced fish balls. I'll be making this often.

I loved this; I took others' advice and added some rice wine and rice vinegar.  I also steamed the broccoli for a minute or two with a splash of soy sauce and sesame oil.  In addition, I added some diced red pepper, which I also steamed for a minute.  Instead of a large pot of water, I substituted vegetable broth for half of the water, and cooked the noodles in that.  It was delicious.

I'm from Hawaii and have had tons of soba.  This recipe is different and great!  I added a sliced red pepper and used more broccoli.  I steamed both slightly.  Decreased sesame seeds to 1/3c, doubled soy, and added 1 tsp. hoisin and some crushed red pepper.  Tasted okay warm but I let sit in the fridge and it made an awesome cold soba!  Delicious.  My husband stopped in from work today just to have a bowl.  Even my 14 month old will eat the noodles, which is miraculous.  Thank you!

Very easy and delicious!  I live in Japan and haven't found a soba recipe I like--until now.  This is great for lunches and I am very glad I found it.  Thanks for sharing!

Lazy version uses a bottled peanut dressing instead of making this one. I add carrots (baby Carrots boiled until tender then add noodles to same pot and toss broccoli in for last minute). When feeling less lazy add sauteed or baked tofu cubes. Yum

So, I made a TON of changes. I'm giving the recipe 5 stars because it led to a great meal, which is what we're here for, isn't it? I doubled the sauce using half balsamic vinegar and half rice vinegar, only used about 2 T of sesame seeds (all I had, I would have used more if I'd had them), used the full pack of noodles (13oz), added some sliced yellow and red peppers as well as some sliced mushrooms, and blanched my veggies by adding them to the noodles for the last 2 minutes. The results were so good that I couldn't stop "tasting" while I waited for it to be ready to serve!

This turned out well, except that I'd assumed it would be a hot/warm dish.  My soba noodles were done in four minutes. I had no broccoli, so I lightly sauteed slivers of red and green bell peppers and sliced mushrooms then added a bit of shredded bok choi after the sesame seeds. Then I returned it all to the pan and quickly heated it. It as a very tasty dish. I can imagine adding sauteed chicken  as well. The only issue I had with it was that the noodles were sticky even after thorough rinsing in cold water, but then again, I had pad Thai and those noodles were just like these. Love buckwheat. Thank you :-)

We've had this recipe with broccoli and with green beans.  Both were excellent.

I followed another review's suggestion and made the sauce with rice vinegar instead of balsamic, and brown sugar instead of white. Also toasting the sesame seeds in a dry pan on a skillet works fabulously! I make this a lot with carrots, snow peas, and red bell peppers for the veggies. Very tasty and easy to make.

This was amazing. I followed other reviewers and toasted the sesame seeds in a dry skillet, it took less than 2 min and severely reduced the amount, maybe a tablespoon.. I used rice vinegar rather than balsamic, and ponzu sauce (citrus seasoned soy sauce). I doubled the ponzu, but kept the rest of the liquid the same. I used brown sugar instead of white, and blanched veggies to add. Also, I didn't have so a noodles so I used rice noodles. Like most recipes, this is a good base.  Add the flavors you like, and it works! Adding this to my vegetarian rotation!!

I made this for my family and they loved it. I would suggest adding less sesame seeds and less green onions because after we ate the noodles there was a lot of leftover sesame seeds. I also suggest adding double or even triple the amount of soy sauce and vinegar. Other than that this was a great recipe and I will definitely make this again
