Has good flavor as written, would recommend adding salt to individual portions as needed. I am not a vegetarian but thought I would try a meatless option. It's very thick but tasty.I served with tortilla chips. Would make again.

Delish! I used half the amount of quinoa and added a pound of ground beef.  I subbed a can of chili beans for one of the black beans, frozen corn (which I  simmered the whole time), and added a splash of lime juice.  We topped with green onions, Mexican cheese, and crushed tortilla chips.  Would've been awesome topped with avocado.  My kids LOVED it!

I added in a ton of fresh chopped veggies and did 1/2 extra of each spice and replaced the water with veggie broth. SO GOOD! Next time I would add in tomatoes too. We topped with shredded cheese  and crispy fried onions.

I thought this was amazing and have made it several times since.  I did need to add extra liquid to the quinoa, I thought the instructions were a little short on the liquid.  I have also added carrots and mushrooms to mine for extra veggies. Yumm!

I did not use oil and substituted it with water.
