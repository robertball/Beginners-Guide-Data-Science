Truly excellent recipe.  I read through several and selected this one because I liked that the cake is mostly eggs.  The lime zest seems delightfully unusual.  The final tipping point was the dulce de leche because my husband loves that.  I made this for a dinner with friends, there were 8 of us and I did not want to be tempted with leftovers, so cut the recipe in half and made it in an 8x8 glass pan.  Served it with fresh blue- and blackberries.  It all worked perfectly and got rave reviews.
