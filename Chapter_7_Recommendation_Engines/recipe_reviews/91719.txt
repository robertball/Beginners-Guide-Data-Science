Decent, but with a strange texture that we didn't really enjoy. I probably wouldn't make this again.

I am not sure what happened, but the way this set, was horrid.  It ended up tasting fine, but the the two different layers settled just like that, as separate layers.  It was weird.  Thankfully I bought a "backup" since this was the first time I made this.  Like I said, it tasted good, but the appearance... bad.

This was very good and easy to make.  I did not make any changes to the recipe. I think I baked it a bit too long so make sure to keep an eye on it towards the end.  I will definitely make again.

Wow, what a great cheesecake! It impressed my new mother-in-law so much that I am now the designated cheesecake maker for all future holidays and family functions.  This is one of the easiest I have made, and I make a lot of cheesecakes...I love the use of sweetened condensed milk to sweeten the cheesecake while also adding smoothness.  The only adjustments I made were to use a water bath in the oven while cooking, and to cook as directed for 40 minutes, then turn it down to 250 degrees for another 20 minutes, then shut the oven off and allow the cheesecake to cool as the oven cools down.  I also did an additional darker chocolate layer on top of the vanilla (simply by adding more melted chocolate).  It looked and tasted professional!

Great- very rich. I used oreo cookies for the crust! Put foil around the bottom of the springform pan then placed it on a cookie sheet with some water. Turned out perfectly!
