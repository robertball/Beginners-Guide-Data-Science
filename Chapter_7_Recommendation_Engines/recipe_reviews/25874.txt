This recipe couldn't be any easier to fix..a wonderful meal to prepare in a hurry but tasting like you worked long and hard!  I didn't have fresh shrimp..had 2 12oz bags of frozen so thawed them first and drained off all the water; proceeded with the recipe as stated.  I used just a shy tbsp. of the dijon and on the advice of others, only used 1/2 cup butter.  When I got the mixture together, I didn't think there would be enough but continued to heed the repetative advice of other reviewers and stuck with half cup...am glad I did...it was plenty enough and hubby dipped his french bread in the garlic butter!  I used 2 cloves of garlic and rough chopped a handful of parsley.  I also added a splash of dry white wine...this was fabulous and will definitely make again..don't be shy to try it with the frozen shrimp...just dethaw first and drain off all the water.  I served this over linguine.

This is very easy and tasty. I used the full amount of butter and thought it was fine because I served it over penne.  However, if you don’t want extra sauce, I’d reduce the butter by half.  I used extra garlic, dried parsley and frozen shrimp, thawed, shelled, and drained.  I don’t really care for mustard, but used the required amount anyway.  It added a little something.  Had I not known that there was mustard in this dish, I wouldn’t have recognized the flavor; it was that subtle.  I don’t understand how people could find it overpowering unless they used yellow mustard.  I took one star off because the cook time for the shrimp is way off.  I used large shrimp and they were a tad overdone at 10 minutes.  ( I think they should have come out of the oven at 7-8 minutes)  I can’t imagine how rubbery medium sized shrimp at 15 minutes would be.

We loved this recipe.  So fast and easy.  As far as some of the comments made about using less butter, I went ahead and used all the butter which I think was needed to make sure the shrimp was coated.  There was a lot left over in the pan but that was o.k.  We did add a light sprinkling of parmesan and old bay, which i think helped the butter cling to the shrimp. A little splash of white wine is also good in the mix.

I too made some modifications to this great recipe. I used 24 oz. of frozen shrimp, with the tail on. Used only 1 tablespoon of mustard, and I added apprx. 1 tablespoon old bay seasoning, 3 cloves of chopped garlic and 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley to the butter mix. After placing in a non stick cookie pan (with sides), I sprinkled it with a mixture (about two handfulls)of panko bread crumbs and fresh grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese. The last two to three minutes of cooking, I placed the oven on broil (just long enough to brown the tops of the shrimp). OUTSTANDING!

Wow, I was really impressed with this! Other than adding a "glug" of white wine I made this as stated and was very happy. It's easy to throw together, is ready in mere minutes, looks lovely on the plate, and tastes delicious! What more could you ask for? I served this with whole wheat linguine and a zucchini/yellow squash/tomato medley, then garnished the entire plate with minced fresh parsley. When my husband called to let me know he was leaving the office I started dinner and it was ready to serve when he got home 25 minutes later! The next time I make this I will get it all assembled in advance to pop in the oven at a moment's notice, especially since I think the shrimp might even benefit from the extra time marinating in all those wonderful ingredients. I will also keep this dish in mind for last minute company. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've only taken the time to write 4 reviews thus far. I felt compelled to write a positive review for this dish. It is truly EXCELLENT, given the time investement and number of ingredients. This is equal (and even better) to most of the scampi dishes I've eaten in restuarants. As other reviewers, I cut the butter in half (which means you use one block of butter from your container 8 tablespoons = 1/2 cup), I added 3/4 cup of White Cooking Wine, I omitted the Parsley (since I didn't have it, and it did not affect the taste in the least). I baked for 14 minutes (without any pre-marinating -no time for it). I tossed it in with Spinach Fettucine (got to get the vegetables in somehow). It was great, wonderful smell, not overly buttery (I don't like alot of butter). Was a crowd pleaser at my home. Will definitely make again. Thank you for this RECIPE!!!!!

The main reason this is a 5* rating comes from the ease of preparation in relation to the awesome results!  My boyfriend and co. devoured this last night at dinner, along with Baked Pineapple and Cheese Vegetable Soup as a starter course (see reviews). In agreement with another reviewer, I found the amount of butter excessive and cut it down to only a little over half.  I also doubled the fresh parsley, tripled the garlic (as per usual:-), used bottled lemon juice (since it was all i had on hand and the lemons at the market looked HORRID...gotta love MT produce eh???) and sprinkled the shrimp with old bay, s&p before buttering them. **My shrimp were quite large, and were done in 7-8 minutes....DEFINATELY keep an eye on them, as they tend to get tough, rubbery, and dry when cooked too long.  Awesome!!

This dish was quick, easy and absolutely delicious!!  Wonderful flavor!!  I used Grey Poupon "Mild & Creamy" style mustard, as others commented that the mustard taste was overwhelming.  The taste of this dish was wonderful and definitely NOT too mustardy tasting.
Again, absolutely delicious - this is a keeper!!

This is a great, quick, easy recipe.  I used cooked shrimp, which made it even easier.  I added a bit of breadcrumbs and set the oven to broil for about 3 minutes toward the end, just for a little crunch.

This dish would have been much better w/ at least half of the mustard.  The mustard overpowered the garlic so I felt like I was eating mustard shrimp as opposed to garlic.

As recommended, used half the butter.  Doubled the garlic (I do in everything).  Used Honey Dijon mustard I had on hand.  Butterfly'd the shrimp so more exposure to the seasonings.  Made ahead and let marinate in the fridge in stainless steel bowl several hours while I prepped the rest of dinner. Put the bowl on the grill for 15 minutes with the steaks.  Lots of compliments!

Very yummy dish, but I did make some changes.  First, I followed the advice of others and cut the amount of butter.  I only used 4 tablespoons of butter and it still seemed like I could have cut it a bit more.  I did only have 1/2 a pound of shrimp (instead of 2 pounds), but I wanted plenty of sauce, so kept all the other ingredient amounts the same.  I used the full amount of mustard and the full amount of lemon juice and garlic.  Instead of parsley, I put in some basil and oregano and added some cayenne pepper flakes for zing (we like spicy!).  I also followed the advice of others and added a "glug" of white wine.  The lemon flavor was a bit much, so I think next time I will omit it or cut it way back and add more wine.  I cooked the shrimp according to the directions, but at the end I sprinkled them with parmesan cheese and broiled them for about 5 minutes.  I served it over angel hair pasta with some veggies sauteed in butter and olive oil.  My husband, who is pretty picky, loved it and we snarked up the whole thing.  A definite keeper with the changes!  As a friend says, "yumbo!"

This recipe was AWESOME.  My family said it was the best I had ever made.  Now that is something since they are picky eaters. I did do a couple of things different.  I used 1 stick of butter and a 1/2 can of chicken stock inplace of the 1 cup of butter.  I like lemon, so I used a little bit more.  The dijon mustard gave it such a great flavor as well. Also, I did not have any "fresh" parsley, so I just used dried.  I cooked 1 lb of pasta shells in the remaining chicken stock plus water.  I poured all of the shrimp scampi bake over the drained shells and mixed it up.  Added salt and pepper to taste as I went along.  This was very flavorful.  Thanks for such a delicious recipe.  Definitely a keeper for our receipe box.

Just a recommendation to those that use "cooking wine -- 'DON'T.  As per the advice of chefs in the know, "If you won't drink it, don't cook with it!".  Just buy a bottle of dry white wine, can be had for less than $10, and see the difference.  Even if you are not a wine drinker.  You are a cook or you would not be on this site.

Wow. My husband devoured this, and he's not usually enthusiastic about dishes that don't involve Italian sausage or beef. 

I used 3/4 cup butter rather than 1 cup, and kept everything else the same. Oh very delicious. Flavorful, with nothing standing out too much. I served over rice. The only reason we have any left is because we both got too full to continue...

Can't stop thinking about this! The only reason I looked up this recipe is because I had leftover cooked angel hair pasta & some jumbo shrimp in the freezer. I chose this one because of the unusual addition of dijon as well as the method of baking rather than stovetop prep. OMG, we loved this! Used 1 cube of real butter & 1 lb. shrimp but left everything else as written, although didn't bake it more than 8 to 10 minutes...Garnished with a quick grind of black pepper & a bit of fresh chopped basil. If I had an open bottle of white wine I would've added a splash just to thin out the sauce...But as written this is DIVINE! Thank you!!!!!

Very good. I did add about 1/2c white wine and salt-free cajun seasoning. I felt it still needed just a little more flavor, which I think would have been accomplished had I halved the butter. Next time I will do that. So easy and so versatile. Definitely a keeper!

This is absolutely fabulous. I had a bag of frozen shrimp, not raw, and just put them frozen into the oven with the sauce poured over them. It took a couple minutel longer to bake. I served the shrimp on a bed of angel hair pasta. Delightful, and so easy with the oven doing the work. This is a big-time keeper.

Very tasty for such a quick and easy meal.  The longest part would be deveining and deshelling the shrimp, so try to buy the shrimp already prepared.  Could easily be made on a weeknight.  And the dijon mustard was yummy!! :-)

I made this recipe as written except for a few exceptions. I cooked the shrimp for 5-7 minutes, then put it under the broiler for another 2 minutes. My 13-year-old son loves this recipe and says it taste better than Red Lobster's shrimp scampi.

I had to make a couple of changes and this recipe still turned out excellent. Since my supermarket didn't have fresh shrimp I had to use the frozen cooked shrimp (I defrosted them by allowing them to soak in cold water for about 10 minutes). I also used more garlic than called for because we LOVE garlic. I reduced the baking time to ten minutes. Well, it was fabulous! The mustard and the lemon gave it the perfect flavor. I would not hesitate to make this again. Not only did it taste great, but it's easy and takes no time at all to make. Everyone in my house was thrilled with it.

This was a unique twist on Shrimp Scampi... My husband and I really enjoyed this! I did take suggestions from some of the other reviews and cut back on the butter by about half. I also added a few splashes of white wine, some fresh lemon juice and red pepper flakes. I used larger shrimp than called for because I thought the medium ones might end up too chewy after all that time in the oven on such high heat. The large shrimp worked out perfectly. The Dijon mustard really adds a delicious flavor... Thanks for another recipe to add to my archives!

Recipe is quick,easy and delicious. I have made this on average of twice a month since I found it. It is an excellent dish when you want something nice after a hard days work or for serving to company. If I have'nt had lemons on hand I leave it out,still great. We always have shrimp in the freezer and all of the other ingredients. Sometimes I use half butter and half olive oil. Any size shrimp can be used just cook accordingly.Precooked shrimp can be tough,it is best to peel your own. Thanks to Kimber for sharing.

This was perfection...!  I only used 1 lb. of shrimp and only did 1/2 of the sauce.  It was awesome.  The only change I made was to chop about 2 cups of fresh spinach and stir in with the shrimp.  It was great.  Tasted very much like the shrimp portofino at Macaroni Grill...  yum..

5+++ Stars . . . Living in the South offers us the opportunity to purchase Tiger Pawn shrimp fresh from the Atlantic Ocean - right off the shrimp boat.  Each fall we clean and freeze approximately 150-200 lbs. of shrimp.  My husband always sauteed shrimp scampi on top of the stove with lots of butter and garlic.  While in Savannah, GA recently, our best friends shared this recipe with us.  We had a type of cook-off with Jay preparing his scampi and our friends preparing this recipe.  Needless to say, we no longer prepare shrimp scampi on top of the stove!!!  Served over angel hair with a salad and hot bread from the oven makes this one of the family's favorite meals.  Jay and our 21 y/o son, Jess, beg for me to prepare this at least 2-3 times a week . . . I reserve the recipe for 'special' Saturday evenings and often include a New York Strip grilled.  Thank you so much for this recipe . . . the ingrediants blend so nicely!  For Thanksgiving, we're taking frozen shrimp to Illinois and will be sharing this dish with our family!  Would not change a thing in this recipe.  Thanks again - absolutely marvelous!!!  Impressing company meal; however, do not want to share our shrimp! LOL

This is amazing as is! Use the sauce for dipping. I can't believe how good this is and I didn't have any lemon but besides that I followed the recipe exactly.

I followed the recipe but added 1/2 c. of panko bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese.  I used 21/25 sized shrimp and 15 minutes was perfect, with the last minute of time spent under the broiler.  Restaurant quality!

Yummy!  I served this with linguine.  There's just two of us so I halved the recipe.  I used 80% butter and 20% olive oil.  Sauteed the garlic in the olive oil for a minute then added the butter, lemon juice, parsley and (what I had) spicy brown mustard.  We had jumbo shrimp size 16-20 per pound (tails off) which I had sprinkled with lemon pepper ahead of time. Baked about 11 minutes.  I turned them over half way through baking and sprinked them with some parmesan cheese. Made my Mama happy.

This is very good, I used 3/4 cup butter and next time will use even less.  I added a glug of Pinot Grigio that added great flavor.  I season with a little old bay as well.

Wonderful!  Cut the butter by 1/2 but was still swimming in it.  Unless you're serving over pasta or rice (and want sauce), seriously cut it by at least half or more.  Next time I'll cut the butter down to 1/2 cup, sprinkle shrimp with Old Bay, add wine to sauce, sprinkle with breadcrumb/parm cheese mix, and will broil on a cookie sheet for the last 3 min to get a slightly more crispy texture.  Super recipe as is though...thanks so much for posting!

I have made over 75 recipes from this site. I'm considered a good cook. This is the first review I've submitted. I was at a loss as to what to make for dinner. Had all the ingredients for this recipe. Family quote " this is as good as it gets here !!!!" I usually dont bother with any recipe with fewer than 10 ingredients. This was a simple savory Sunday night solution!

This is absolutely fantastic. Scallops would also be good done this way, or mix the shrimp and scallops. For anyone on a low carb diet, this is perfect. Might reduce the butter to 1/2 c. next time since I had alot of liquid left over.

This just proves that restaurant quality meals can be made easily at home. I would have been thrilled to have this at a restaurant and I was even more thrilled that I was able to make it so quickly and with so few ingredients.  So delicious!

Update:  I just made this with chicken and it was great that way too!  I just cut up raw chicken breasts into bite sizes pieces and followed the recipe as written.  Yummy chicken scampi!

This was quick, easy, and enjoyed by all.  I served it over angel hair with a Caesar salad and crusty bread.  It was enjoyed by all.  Great for a party dish - it could be prepared in advance and slipped in the oven just before serving time.

So easy and good! I served this over steamed whitr rice. I cooked it in an aluminum pan and added fresh broccoli to half of the pan pouring the scampi sauce over it as well as the shrimp. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again.

This was pretty good for such a quick and easy recipe.  I only used 1 lb. of shrimp since I was only cooking for two, but kept the amount of sauce the same so I could serve it over pasta.  I used a dijon mustard with white wine, and added salt and pepper. I think it could have used more seasonings of some sort, but it was still very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent. I read previous reviews before I decided to try it.  I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup plus 2 T.(if you were going to serve this over pasta the full amount of butter would be recommended) and I only used I T. of dijon mustard.  After the butter had melted I tasted it and added a few dashes of hot sauce for flavor --not heat. I only had to cook it for about 8 minutes--so watch your oven. I thought it was as good as what you could get at Red Lobster--all we neednow is the cheddar bay biscuits!  My kids loved it and we will definitely be having this again.

I was intrigued with the idea of baking shrimp in the oven, so I thought I’d give this a try.  I used 21-25 count shrimp and they were done in only 6 minutes.  Watch this very closely.  Once they turn pink, they’re done.  Baking them for 12-15 minutes as instructed in the recipe surely would have turned them to rubber.  I’m glad I tried this method, but I still think cooking shrimp in a skillet is easier.  Other than the baking time, what’s not to like about this recipe?  UPDATE 9/24/12:  I made this again on the stovetop this time.  Worked just fine.  I scaled this way back for the two of us, using only 4 T. butter, 1 1/2 t. Dijon, 3/4 t. each lemon juice, garlic and parsley.

This was a simply splendid meal. I cut the recipe in half as I was only catering for 3. However, I still cut the amount of butter used. The cook time on the shrimp was 7 mins not the stated amount of time. After cooking time I removed the shrimp and added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 1/4 C of white wine and 1/4 cup of sliced mushrooms to the baking pan and placed it back into the oven for 7 mins or so, so that the sauce could reduce. Then I poured it over the cooked shrimp and served with vegetables and mashed potatoes. Delish!

This is a staple recipe for me-I melt the butter in the baking pan in the oven while I am preheating the oven and getting other ingredients prepped-then mix everything together and bake about 10 minutes or until shrimp is done depending on size of shrimp used. I only use about a 2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard -for me 2 tablespoons is way too much.  I rarely have fresh parsley on hand but have used dry or omitted altogether.  This dish is a quick and easy delight!

Unlike some of the reviewers, I kept the amount of butter the same.  I found it was just enough to coat the linguine I made very nicely and something to dunk the bread in!  I used cilantro instead of parsley and we liked it a lot.  Next time I would cook the shrimp a little less and would add some crushed red pepper for heat.

This was awesome.  The mustard added a nice flavor, but next time I think i will use 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount of mustard.  I added extra garlic and a large splash of white wine.  I served mine over noodles.  I think if you were not having this over rice or pasta it would be too much butter, but the butter made a real nice pasta sauce.

Absolutely the BEST thing you can do with shrimp, whether you're feeding two or twenty. So easy and really wonderful! I serve it with brown rice, with some peas tossed in.

Made this for company last night and everyone loved it!  I increased the lemon, garlic and parsley and served it over bowtie pasta. Easy, delicious and lovely presentation.  Thanks for the recipe!  Oh, almost forgot: I added sea scallops and I didn't bother to transfer to baking dish - I completed the recipe in a big frying pan.  EASY!

As if I needed to add my 5 stars...this was GREAT!!!  I don't know if I used 2 lbs of shrimp or not, they were fresh from my DH 'shrimping' last night.  But it was a lot.  I only used 1/2 cup butter, and 1TBS mustard, two gloves crushed garlic a good sprinkle of dried parsley and around 1TBS lemon juice.  I topped with some bread crumbs and cooked for around 10-12 minutes-broiled the last minute or two. There was plenty of sauce, but probably not if we wanted to put some sauce on pasta or rice (it was fine since I served it with garlic potatoes) My hubby kept raving over this dish!  Thanks for this recipe. This is a KEEPER for sure!!!!

WOW!  i've been looking for a decent scampi recipe for a long time, and have finally found it.

its simple, quick, and delicious.  my husband is not a big scampi eater but made me make it twice in one week.  even the kids love it...better double the recipe!  i actually cheat...i just mix everything up in the 13x9 in. pan and stick it in the microwave until its melted...dump in the shrimp mix it up and cook.  saves on dishes.  :-)

We loved it!  I used pre-cooked shrimp and they were very tender....not a problem.  I just decreased the oven time.  I also put the shrimp scampi over pasta and it was really tasty.  So easy to make too!

Great recipe.  This makes an elegant and delicous appetizer.  It worked very successfully for an intimate Christmas gathering.  I will definately make this recipe again.

I made this for my family and they loved it.  I did not cut down the butter as suggested, but, next time, would increase the butter since in the cooking, it did evaporate but I put butter and olive oil on the linquine with which I served it and that added.  I also used a whole head of garlic which was not overpowering, and used dried parsley leaves.  I used frozen shrimp and just had enough in the recipe for 6 people, but, next time would adapt to more so that I have leftovers.  I loved the recipe and it is easy to make but tastes like it was more complicated which is good for the cook.  I cut down the dijon mustard so that it was not overpowering but added a slightly delicate flavor of the mustard.  I used barely a teaspoon.  Linguine was a great compiment and garlic bread.  My dinner party was a success.Just another suggestion.  The frozen shrimp that I had gotten had been deveined but had to be shelled.  However, in examining each shrimp I saw signs that it wasn't totally cleaned and I cleaned it.  I cut off the tails because there was stuff to clean under the tails.  So, my suggestion is to cut off the tails when using the frozen shrimp.  The shrimp tasted really good and as good as fresh shrimp.  I bought Stop N Shop brand.  I am in the New York area and available here. I used a 2-pound bag for 6 people, but, as I had said, I would probably increase it for leftovers or bigger eaters.

I really liked the cooking method - doing it in the oven freed up space on my stovetop. I do think the temp and cook time are too high - I used a 425 degree oven for about 9 minutes and they probably could have come out at 8. Ovens and shrimp sizes do vary but cooking that long and hot could ruin this recipe. I omitted the mustard and added white cooking wine, just preference for me based on other scampi recipes I've made in the past. I think the full amount of butter is needed, it's just not "scampi" without a buttery sauce. Thanks very much for sharing.

I made this New Years Eve, but the oven was in use, so we tossed it on the grill with the steaks.  We all thought it turned out great!  I did add some white wine, cayenne pepper, and Tony Cacheres to it to give it a little pop!  I just served plain as a side to the steaks, but I plan to make again and serve over noodles.  Very good and easy!  *Edit* I made this (with the modifications above) and baked as directed instead of grilling, last night, and tossed with pasta and a little parmesan cheese.  This was a crowd (crowd of 3!) pleaser!  It is easy to make, and really comes out like something you would get at a restaurant or even better!

I love the addition of mustard in this shrimp scampi, I used a White Wine Dijon mustard, and it was perfect.  Served it over angel hair pasta, and a crusty Italian bread!

(Daughter's review) I really liked this shrimp scampi recipe. It was quite simple to make and tasted very delicious. After placing on the cooking sheet I sprinkled it with breadcrumbs and it made it twice as good. Although it made it a little saltier I preferred the one with the breadcrumbs over the one without. I tasted the dijon a little too strongly but it was still fine for my tastebuds. I would give this a 5 star rating but it isnt the best shrimp scampi I ever ate. The ones at the restaraunt are better. As far as making it my self, I give it 5 stars. Considering I made it myself, it is the best shrimp scampi recipe that I have ever made. My entire family loved it so I will be making this again. :)

(Mom's review)  I would halve the amount of butter and use just 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter. I used tongs to place the shrimp on the baking sheet, instead of allowing it to swim in all the butter.  I reserved the butter sauce and will use it for crab cakes tomorrow.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using about 3/4 of 1 stick of butter, adding 3/4 c. of white wine, sprinkling an all-season salt mix over the shrimp while in the baking dish, and removing the tails.  Everyone really liked this, but I don't think it wouldn't have been as good without the wine and the seasoning salt.  I served it with angel hair pasta (tossed the pasta in the leftover juices from the shrimp pan and then added a little bit more butter, Parmesan, garlic powder, pepper, and salt to it) and a Caesar Salad.  It was good, but if you have hearty eaters, it might be wise to up the shrimp to three pounds or make sure you have plenty of your side dishes.  The shrimp is much lighter than sitting down and having a chicken breast or pork chop.  I served my family of five, and we have two guys that are big eaters.  While they weren't starving after dinner, they definitely would have been satisfied having more.

Very good  My husband love shrimp Scampi. This was the first time I have ever fixed it and it came out perfect. I did read the reviews and a lot said not to use all the butter, I followed the instructions and found that if I wouldn't have used al the butter I would not have been about to cover all the shrimp. Once again a great dish

This is to die for!  It seems like something I'd get in a restaurant.  I did use 3/4 cup of butter and it was plenty.  I had prepared the sauce ahead of time, so it was so easy to pour it on the shrimp and about 15 minutes later it was done.  I did need to stir the shrimp half way through baking.  I can't wait to impress my friends with this one.!

My whole family liked this shrimp.  It is extremely simple to make, but tastes like it took longer.  I made extra sauce and put it over pasta, topped with grated parmesan and it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

No way to give 4 1/2 stars so we went to 4 on this one.  Very tasty but it was missing something - not sure what, though.  I was worried that the Dijon Mustard would ruin it - and hubby hates mustard - but I used it anyway and I think it really added a lot of flavor and depth - and you didn't really know it was there.  Made one small change - I  added about 2-3 Tabsp. of Sherry to the sauce. I served it over rice because I had some in the rice cooker.  It was very good - hubby liked it.

This was easy and wonderful!  I used the full amount of butter, one finely sliced shallot and added a little glug of white wine and served it like a sauce over fettuccine and it was not too much.  No need to dirty two pans, just melt the butter and dijon in your baking dish.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent!  I am a big believer in making the recipe as written the first time I make it, then figuring out if my family would like any adjustments made to it.  This was excellent "as is" - the dijon mustard really made the flavor pop, and gave it a less garlicy flavor that overwhelms so many scampis.  
If I were to make any additions, I would like a bit of an onion flavor added to it.  I wouldn't want to overwhelm the way it tastes "as is", so perhaps a shallot may give it that flavor.  I will try that the next time I make it -- but definately try it the way written the first time.  I think you will be pleased !

Excellent recipe!  My husband loved it and so did I.  I only used 1.5lb of shrimp and one and a halved the sauce (2 sticks of butter and 1/2 cup of EVOO).  I served with pasta, ceasar salad and a good baguette.  Dip the bread in the sauce Yummy!

Good recipe, and you can play around with the ingredients to fit your taste. I replaced about 1/4 c of butter with white wine. Next time I will use less mustard (maybe I overmeasured?) and maybe a little more fresh squeezed lemon juice.

My family of 6 loves this! And with them just being "fried shrimp only!" kind of family, that is great, not to mention that this is a fast and simple recipe that you can add and adjust to your tastes. I added about 1/4 cup parm. cheese and didn't have brown mustard, and was leery to the previous ratings on the yellow mustard, so I added a touch of honey mustard. I also added chopped green onions. YUM! Pasta has met it's match!

This is a different (and excellent!) way to prepare shrimp scampi.  I cut back a bit on the Dijon, doubled the amount of garlic and added some Old Bay seasoning -- served it with rice pilaf, and it was wonderful!  This is a keeper -- thanks Kimber.

I took the advise from others and am glad I did. You really do want to cut the amount of butter in half and add Old Bay before baking. I used half pre-cooked shrimp and half bay scallops. This turned out fabulous. My hubby and I both give this five stars.

This shrimp scampi was quick and easy,and SO tasty!Instead of using dijon mustard,I opted for a dash of cayenne pepper,more zip and adds beautiful color.I also added more chopped garlic and lots of lemon juice for zest.I served it over linguine,topped it off with fresh grated parmesan cheese,YUM!

Very easy and good. I will cut down on the butter next time. I used less mustard and a little more lemon. Served over angel hair pasta. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely divine and so quick and easy to make! The time is way off as some others have said, mine baked in 10 minutes longer and they would be chewy.

Came out perfectly! I omitted the mustard because none of my kids care for it. But I did work around the recipe a bit. I cooked some angel hair pasta (el dente) and placed it in the bottom of the dish. Added the thawed out shrimp and butter garlic mixture with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Broiled it till a bit crispy after it baked. And Yummo! A whole dinner in one dish! Super tasty! Pasta continues to bake with the juices from the shrimp.

Perfect! I just used the frozen already cooked medium shrimp, thawed them, detailed them and then cut them in half..added to sauce and poured over linguine and added some parmesan. Best pasta recipe I've tried so far!

Thiterecipe was easy to make and absolutely delicious!  My family loved it. I followed what many others said to use 1/2 cup of butter. I didn't have fresh garlic or parsley so I used Garlic powder and Parsley flakes. It still came out amazing. This will definitely be a go to recipe for quick and easy meals.

FANTASTIC!!!! The only thing I changed was 1 stick of unsalted butter with 1 stick of salted butter.  I'd rather play it safe than to salty!!!

Really good, really easy.  Read Many of the reviews. I did cut the butter back but added a lil white wine to make up for liquid. You can't possibly need more than 10 minutes in the oven.  I actually did 7 minutes and then a minute under broiler and stir. Highly recommend. I would error on the light side with the mustard for your first time. I could see going too heavy turning the dish, but it was excellent.

This is just incredible! I used frozen Langostinos instead of shrimp. I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup by adding approx 1/4 cup good quality EVOO instead. I served over pasta lightly sprinkled with olive oil, and sprinkled with grated cheese (Romano, kasseri, and fontina, but any Italian cheeses will do). I poured the sauce from the pan over the pasta, and served the Langostinos on top. It cooks quickly so make sure you prepare the pasta and grated cheese first. My family gobbled it up like it was their last meal!

This is a great recipe.  My slight modifications were as follows:
1) added 1 more Tbs of chopped garlice since I LOVE garlic
2) used the juice of one lime, since I had no lemons
3) added 1 tsp of capers for a little tartness
4) added one red thai pepper (seeded and chopped) for a slight kick
5) added 1/4 cup white zinfandel
6) poured the baked results into a plate filled with freshly boiled wide-ribbon lemon-pepper pasta (from Trader Joes - it's called PAPPARDELLE PASTA - SOOO good!)
7) sprinkled the plated result with freshly grated parmesan (to taste)

Then I poured myself a small glass of chilled white zin to wash it all down with - this combination of tastes was DELISH!  Will definitely be making this one again.

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly and I used the full recommended amount of butter because I served the dish with fettuccini noodles and I didn't want it to be dry. I would definitely double or triple the seasonings the next time. This kind of reminds me of a dish from the Outback Steakhouse. This is a restaurant quality recipe.

OUtstanding and sooooo easy! I used large raw frozen shrimp with the tails. Defrosted and patted dry to remove moisture. Used half the Dijon and served over linguine. I kept an eye on the shrimp and took it out 8-9 minutes. It contines to cook while everything is being set tp plate. Wonderful! Thank you!

I've made this twice now.  Both times were for Mother's Day.  Everyone in the family adored it...and I'm so happy that my mom loved it too.  I used cooked shrimp instead of raw and then took the tails off after they thawed.  I served the scampi over fettuccine noodles and added some chopped up broccoli.  I also added more garlic since my family loves garlic.
I will make this again and again.  It was so easy and one of the tastiest dinners ever.

Made this for girls night at my house and it was amazing! Gave this 5 stars for simplicity and for taste. First I seasoned the shrimp with Cajun seasoning. Then I added about 2 tsp of basil to the butter mixture. I did end up using all of the butter although some reviewers suggest not to. After pouring the mixture over the shrimp, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese, and let it marinate for about 30 minutes before baking it. Served it over linguine with breadsticks. Delicious! Husband was jealous that he missed this meal!

This is a great dish!  I have made it many times and my husband loves it.  It's also a great entree to serve when unexpected guests arrive because it is so fast and easy.  I add a little old bay and some salt, and cut the butter by half.  Served over fettuccine or linguine, it is terrific!!  I do agree with others, the cooking time is too long!  About 8-10 minutes is all it takes.

Just finished having this for dinner, and it was really good for how easy it was. Start to finish really 30 min and I got to use all the  shrimp shells. I made cous cous as a side. Boiled shrimp shells  in 2 cups water for 10 minutes while I melted the butter and made the scampi sauce then strained out the shells, put in the cous cous at the same time I put the shrimp in the oven. SO good and different. Like some of the suggestions I used 1/2 cup water and a good splash of white wine. Served with steamed cauliflower. Delicious.

Hesitant to make because I wasn't sure about the Dijon mustard but it was wonderful AS IS.  I did butterfly the shrimp so each shrimp had more sauce and then they cooked in the least amount of time.  Also used non salted butter and didn't find it necessary to add additional salt.  Buy good shrimp like from the Gulf shrimp and you won't be disappointed.

This is by far the best shrimp scampi recipe I've ever had - easy to make and reminded me of a restaurant we used to go to in Pittsburgh...we served it with grilled ribeyes and baked potatoes and steamed snow peas - what a great New Year's Eve dinner!

This was absolutely the best scampi i've ever made! The dijon gave it just that perfect amount of zing i'd been looking for in other recipes. I'm not a big mustard person, but you'd never know it was in there unless you were told, dont let it deter you!

This was really good. Recipe was very easy to follow, hubby did it all by himself. The only changes we made were we reduced butter to 1 1.2 cups reduced mustard to 1 tablspoon and we added just a little bit if Ol Bay Seasoning we will definetly make this again.

Fixed this for dinner last night and it was wonderful.  I did as several other reviewers suggested and used half the butter and mustard and doubled the garlic and lemon juice.  I also added a half cup of white wine.  I served it over angle hair pasta and there was plenty of sauce.  Next time I'll add more garlic and lemon, it was very good, but my husband and I both like garlic, so I'll see if that kicks it up a notch.

Definitely a keeper.  My husband and both teenagers liked it.  I used frozen, peeled and deveined shrimp instead of fresh, and heated the butter mixture in the microwave instead of on the stove top.  This reduced prep time to about 5 mintues.  I had to double the time in the oven because I didn't thaw the shrimp first.

Simply wonderful.  I modified the recipe slightly based on other reviews.  I used the 1 cup butter, doubled the lemon, used 1 Tbsp of Old Bay, and 3/4 cup of white wine and only baked for 8 minutes.  I served it over Angel Hair pasta and my family devoured it.

I served this for a birthday dinner and it was raved over.  I followed exactly as the recipe.  I also served with some pasta with parmesan, olive oil and garlic.  It complimented the shrimp very well.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on so many positive reviews; however, it was terribly bland!  I used large shrimp rather than the medium shrimp the recipe states to use.  Even with using the larger shrimps, the cooking time is way too long.  And no, my oven isn't "off."  It's brand new.

A terrible waste of beautiful shrimp.  Normally I love scampi, but not this one.

This was really good!  Thanks!  I did cut back the butter a little, but then I really like butter so it doesn't bother me.  I also added some white cooking wine as well.  I let it sit for an hour and half or so in the fridge before baking.  Next time I may let it marinate even longer.  I served over long grain wild rice.

I made the following changes per other comments.  Reduced butter. Added fresh basil.  Increased garlic. Addded white wine. I also allowed the shrimp to sit in mixture to marinate for a few hours before cooking.  The shrimp were full of flavor - will be using this simple but delicious recipe often!  So good that I don't think I could ever eat shrimp scampi at a restaurant again.  Thanks for a great shrimp dish!

I made this recipe for my wife's birthday. I have never cooked shrimp scampi in the oven and to my surprise I will not cook it any other way. It has great flavor and the shrimp is not overcooked. Great recipe.

Everyone in my family loved this meal! I used frozen precooked shrimp, doubled the garlic and served over angel hair. I will add more lemon juice next time and probably less shrimp because I was aiming for a traditional shrimp scampi meal. Super easy and nice to have something other than a casserole for dinner.

I made this recipe for Valentines Day dinner with my husband.  However, I did change things slightly. I added one more clove of fresh garlic and minced both cloves.  I felt the amount of garlic was perfect.

The shrimp came out great and was said to be "just like Red Lobster's shrimp scampi" by my husband.  But unfortunately, it did not go well with the pasta that was recommended with it.  I think the garlic and butter sauce that the shrimp are baked in shouldn't go with anything else but the shrimp.  The sauce just has a very fishy taste to it that just doesn't go well with pasta or rice, in my opinion.  Serve the shrimp and sauce in a separate dish and have something else on the side like maybe a lemon pilaf rice.

Besides that it was great!!  And quite easy too!!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this scampi.  I had some frozen uncooked deviened shrimp on hand, so I quickly boiled the shrimp for about two minutes to easily remove the shells.  I baked it for about five minutes, and the shrimp was done to perfection.  I used about half of the butter, and was generous with the dijon and lemon juice.  I will make this again.

First time I've ever made shrimp scampi, but I think the recipie was very easy, and it tasted pretty good. I used 1 tsp. dijon mustard which gave it a nice kick, 1/2 cup butter and about 6 boots of garlic-chopped. With only 1lb. of frozen shrimp, there was a perfect amount of sauce left over for a small helping of wheat angel hair pasta which coated it enough to give it a nice flavor. I added parmasean cheese and salt in my dish, because it needed more flavor. I will definitely make again.

Really a good dish.  Cut back on the butter by half, added a splash of white wine, a few splashes of hot sauce, and a half T of Old Bay. Cooked up perfectly, and the sauce was great with bread.

This was DELICIOUS! Cut recipe in half, used 2 cloves of garlic, and served over angel hair (usually try the recipe how it's written to begin with, instead of screwing it up right off the bat) Yummy just as it is, but hubby suggested adding toasted pine nuts, I thought about adding some pesto...the possibilites are endless! Drizzled butter/garlic mixture over pasta, tossed, then topped with shrimp. My son, by the way, ate all the shrimp & pasta on his plate and continued on to mine!

I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings and followed it fairly closely.  I took the idea of the person who melted the butter and first ingredients in a cast iron skillet on the stove and then added the shrimp, turned them to coat, and then arranged them in a nice pattern right in the skillet.  Put it in the oven and brought the skillet right to the table and *wow* was it a hit! I also used collossal shrimp which were butterflied, and it turned out to be INCREDIBLE!  It was almost like lobster scampi!  Thanks Kimber!  We'll make this again!!

My husband never orders Shrimp Scampi in a restaurant because it is too rich, but he loved this recipe!  I tried to use less butter and added white wine to compensate for the 30% less butter.  However, right before serving, I threw the last bit of butter in.  With that much shrimp, why not enjoy!  By the way, the parsley is NOT optional and freshly ground pepper really makes this recipe.

Now this is shrimp scampi!  I love the zing that the mustard gives this dish, it really adds something special.  I added 1/4 c. grated parmesean cheese and 1/4 c. white wine to the sauce... the cheese seemed to keep the sauce from getting too thin.  I served with herbed fettucini and a fresh salad for a special anniversary dinner for the hubby.  He raved about the shrimp - definitely a keeper!

I like things spicey so I added a bite of cayenne red pepper to the shrimp before I poured on the sauce. I give this a 5 with the cayenne.

Amazing! One of my favorite dishes! I suggest adding 2 tablespoons of white cooking wine, half the amount of butter (1/2 cup), and more lemon juice! It makes it zesty! I topped mine with grated Parmesan cheese and loved it! I added some zucchini and tomatoes! So amazing!!

I've made this recipe many times and it is a house favorite. But I usually double the garlic and sprinkle 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, corn meal or panko. And if I have some on hand a light sprinkle of shredded cheese (whatever kind is in the fridge)

I changed this recipe a bit by adding a splash of clam juice, white wine, black and red pepper Hot Shot (McCormick's Seasoning) and minced onion and served over a bed of al dente angel hair pasta.  
I had 1lb. (rather than 2lbs.) of tiny pre-cooked shrimp so I halved the whole recipe and briefly sautéed the shrimp on the stove in a covered sautee pan for a few minutes rather than placing in the oven. 
In the end, the taste was Amazing! however, I could have definitely used more sauce.

Very easy and good recipe. The only thing I did was add 1/4 of white wine I let simmer and cook off the alcohol- then added to the pasta bake. This meshed well with all the flavors and we were able to sop up the extra "juice" with fresh french bread.

This recipe is so delicious, I posted it on my Pinterest board called "Am I in a Restaurant?" I make it just as written, have also added white wine, and its all good. Tonight I served it with pasta,roasted red bell peppers and broccoli. Don't be afraid of the Dijon. My ex-MIL made a  shrimp dish with mustard that she made herself from mustard seeds, and it was much stronger than this and was absolutely outstanding.

I thought this was really delicious. I increased the garlic a little bit, and used small shrimp, not medium - and everything turned out wonderful. I served this mixed in with angel hair pasta and topped with parmesan cheese. Next time I think I will add broccoli, zucchini and tomatoes to the pasta. The husband loved this as well!

I wasn't able to eat this because I'm allergic to shrimp, but my husband and son said it was absolutely delicious! They told me to give it 5 starts. I halved the recipe because only 2 people were eating it, but it was gone so quick I'll make the full batch next time.

very good and very easy.  Next time, I'll cook the garlic (and more of it!) in the butter for a little while before adding the other ingredients, add a little less mustard and a little bit of dry white wine.

Simple, quick and delicious. I made the recipe as written but did use frozen shrimp. The only thing i would change next time is to use a little less dijon. Just wish this dish wasn't so high in fat.

This was one of the most delicious meals I have ever made!! The recipe is perfect. I did not change a thing. I had this recipe at a dinner party served over rice, and it was equally delicious. The leftover portion heated up beautifully the next day!! One of my favorite meals ever!!

Super fantastic as is but have learned to half the butter, add a few splashes of a dry white, and add a few shakes of dill and turns of the pepper mill. Delish!!

This is a very simple and quick recipe. I have been making shrimp scampi for decades and have never added Dijon before. I rarely added mustard to any recipes that call for it in unexpected places because for my personal taste it off putting and overwhelming, but being it was Dijon and it was scampi and I was looking for something a bit different I gave it a go and it was great! It adds just a hint of something extra not especially distinctive but noticeable. I also added white wine as others mentioned and because it is scampi. We are garlic lovers in this house so I add without measure just by judgement. This was a great recipe and because it all was basically in the oven I didn't have to baby-sit the pan while doing other things which is a true blessing for a person with a back a condition which only allows for short periods of standing. Thanks this will probably be my new standard scampi recipe!

I've made this recipe several times and the family loves it every time. Friends have asked me for the recipe and made it for their families too.  I served it over pasta with cheddar bay biscuits. The biscuits recipe is on this site as well...it's also delicious.

Yummy!  This shrimp was fab-u-lous! I used Herlocher's dipping mustard because that's what I had. Those who suggest the mustard is too strong, I suggest to use a milder mustard - NOT your standard cheap yellow.  I also followed Sydney's advice and added some bread crumbs and grated Parmesan/Romano at the end and broiled the shrimp. I used the full amount of butter and it was just right to serve over spaghetti. However, I did remove the tails. Who wants to fight with shrimp covered in a buttery sauce?

This was heavenly! I did not use as much dijon as the recipe called for (my husband would have rather had it with none, but that is where our battle lines lie), but nearly a tbsp. I also added a splash of Vermouth white wine and a tad pinch of salt. This was seriously the BEST shrimp dish I have ever had. Will be making again, but next time I think I will cut the butter by half. There was a lot left over. Oh, and we paired with penne pasta and steamed broccoli.

I followed the recipe and it was a good amount for 4 adult servings if you use only 1 1/2 lbs. of jumbo shrimp like I did.   I used a ICBINB margarine spread instead of butter, used Grey Poupon mild  creamy dijon mustard, doubled the parsley, added a little white wine, and added sauteed portebello mushroom slices.  It was delicious!  I will probably add a little more garlic next time, but it had a light taste the way it was. Even the kids and husband, who isn't a big pasta eater, loved it.

I followed recommendations from others and kept the butter to half. I also kept the dijon to half as well. In my opinion, keeping the full amount of things may work better if you're not looking to fill your portions with a ton of shrimp. I served this meal with linguine. If everyone you're cooking for is a definite shrimp lover though, by all means! I absolutely loved this recipe and I plan on making it many more times in the near future! Thank you!

It was okay.  I even added a bunch more spices and it was still lacking in flavor.  I'm not sure what exactly it needed though.  I did cut the butter in half and that was still plenty of butter.  I couldn't imagine what the whole amount would be like!  I liked the ease of this recipe, it was just lacking a bit in flavor.

Makes too much sauce and probably could have used more Dijon mustard for me. I even added an extra tablespoon of minced garlic, because I LOVE garlic and the taste was still too light for me but then I'm really big on flavor. It just tastes like buttery shrimp and someone skimped on the seasonings. The kids loved it though.

Followed other reviewers' advice and halved the butter, still turned out great. I also threw just a bit of crushed red pepper on top for a little kick - just a personal preference. This is one of my husband's favorite recipes now!

Made this dish for dinner last night and it was a HIT. As with many others, I used a 16 oz bag of frozen shrimp ( that I had on hand ) which was plenty for a family of 4, ( although I should mention that my youngest is not a seafood lover and had a grilled cheese sandwich instead ) and left out the parsley, I also thought that 15 - 20 min was  bit long for cooking shrimp, so I left it in oven for only 7 -8 min. My husband detected something in the sauce, but had no idea it was the dijon mustard.  Served with whole wheat linguine noodles, lightly browned buttered french bread and steamed broccoli, hubby took leftovers for lunch the next day.. this is a keeper.

WOW- I made two pounds of Jumbo shrimp and thought that it would be way too much for our family.  I was very wrong!  This stuff went in a matter of minutes and everyone commented on how perfect the shrimp texture was.  I was a tad leery at first, but will surely be making this again!

I NEVER would have thought to put Dijon in a scampi, but I think this made it. I just threw a little white wine into the sauce and did the parmesan / broil that someone else suggested. Fantastic. This will be my 'go-to' scampi recipe. (mercifully, we did not eat all the butter...may look on easing back on that to avoid wasting it...)

This was fantastic!  I was skeptical about the dijon mustard, but surprisely was the best flavor. Wonderful!

Tasty, but my husband and I thought it needed something else. We prepared it exactly as written (ok, maybe a little extra fresh parsley) and it was quite good. The mustard was a really good amount--added flavor without being overpowering. However, it needed...zing--another layer of flavor. Adding ground pepper to my bowl helped but next I would add something else to help pump up the flavor, though I'm not sure what. We would make this again but I'd have to figure out a way to pump this up.

This was really delicious!  Prepared almost exactly as written except that I only used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c margarine to cut the fat.  And I added about a 1/2 cup of wine to make up the difference so that there would be enough sauce for my linguni.  Baked for about 10 minutes, served over pasta.  Also added some garlic salt.  Really, really good.  Restaurant quality.  And you can add some other spices if desired...some basil, red pepper flakes, cajun seasoning...but we enjoyed it as is.  And very easy and quick!!

5 T butter was plenty!

Simply Delicious! I halved the butter as the other reviewers suggested and that was more than enough - enough to coat the noodles I served it over! I added this to our "Favorites" recipe box1

Perfect! I added green onions, tops and bottoms, to the baking dish along with the other ingredients (tho I omitted the parsley). Yes, there was extra butter, but I put it in a bowl with a ladle after I tossed the shrimp and pasta together. Guests added a little drizzle as they liked. I also included some cooked peas to the mix and it added a great pop of color. Everyone loved it.

Oh, I didn't have dijon so I used 1 Tbls of spicy brown mustard and one Tbls of Mayo instead.

Thank you!

Hmmm.... I'm not too sure about this (and I LOVE anything "scampi"). I really don't understand why this has received so many rave reviews. For me, the taste just wasn't there. The butter sauce smelled DIVINE in the saucepan, but once drizzled over the shrimp, it lost its pizzaz. :( To my disappointment, I could taste nothing but bland shrimp. Perhaps if I'd sprinkled everything with breadcrumbs / grated cheese and then broiled quickly this would have turned out better (but that defeats the point of trying a recipe for what it is). Served over rice pilaf with French bread on the side (for dipping). I'm glad I halved this. For what it cost to prepare, I'll look for a recipe that better suits our taste - and my hubby agrees. Thanks anyways, Kimber.

Good and easy to make. You need to find something you like to add flavor. I added a little reduced white wine right at the end just before serving. Also just a touch of cayenne pepper doesn't hurt at all.

This was so amazing and the shrimp literally melted in my mouth. Even my picky 7 year old loved it.  Added capers and some white wine in the mix, it came out perfect.  Served it with pesto angel hair pasta and crusty bread. Couldn't have been easier!  Be careful not to overcook your shrimp - if you take it out at the right time it is not rubbery at ALL =)

I made this tonight.  I'd never made Shrimp Scampi before, only had it at restaurants.  It was delicious.  Will definitely make it again, but will use less butter.  Great dish.

This IS an easy and Delicious bake. All done within minutes, even the preparation was fast. As for the amount of butter called for I only used 1/2 cup or one stick of butter, the regular amount was a bit too much. While I did not have 2 lbs of shrimp, I did have 1 pound of black tiger shrimp. I was feeding only two people. I added a little white wine and cut back a little on the dijon mustard to 1 T, used all fresh ingredients like garlic and a handful of fresh chopped italian parsley with freshly squeezed lemon juice. wonderful, fast, easy and and a keeper!

I prepared this for Mother's Day and everyone raved about it.  So easy to make.  I served it with rice and everyone used the butter juice on the rice.  I was worried about the mustard because I was worried it would over power the dish but everyone loved it.

This. Is. EXCELLENT!!!  I added boiled broccoli and mushrooms and served over angel hair pasta and topped with parmesean cheese.  Oh and served fresh baked Vienna bread to soak up the butter sauce.  Tasted just like a restaurant dish!  Not ONE piece was leftover :)

I made this last night and it was pretty good. The shrimp had good flavor but when I added the "sauce" to my fettucine, it didn't taste like much...it was definitely very bland. I had to add salt and pepper to my dish. I'll make this again but add more garlic and spices and see if this improves the original recipe.

I really liked this recipe because it was very easy.  Like another viewer, I added a healthy dose of white wine to the mix.  I did find the butter overkill, but next time I will totally use the butter for a quick sauce over pasta.

LOVED this dish!!! It was quick and easy to prepare on a busy night. I followed other reviewers suggestions and only added 1 TBSP dijon and 1/2 cup of butter. I also used dried parsly b/c I didnt have any fresh on hand.  I made this with lipton noodles (Scampi Style), salad and bread sticks. I have a VERY picky husband and he really enjoyed it as well. There were no leftovers!!!! :)

Soooo easy! I was a little concerned with the dijon, but it was really subtle.  I used all of the butter called for and used it for sauce on something else.

Fixed this today as a pre-Valentine day dinner for hubby. We loved it! We both agreed that we will cut down the garlic the next time as it overpowered the shrimp. Served it over angel hair pasta and with copycat Red Lobster cheddar biscuits! Maybe he'll take me OUT to dinner tomorrow since I fixed such a great meal! :)

Super easy and delicious.  I only used 1 T of Dijon, but will try 2 the next time because you couldn't even taste it. I used dried parsley and added a little dried basil. I also added some parmesan cheese. Doubled the garlic.  Baked it for 10 minutes and the shrimp were perfect.

Quite tasty and very quick and easy.  Changes I made:  I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup, used dried parsley and put in about 1 T basil (from a tube).

I prepared this meal last night and it was good. I did, however, take suggestions to reduce the butter by half and add Old Bay and Parmesan cheese. I baked the shrimp in the oven for 12-15 minutes (on the lower rack) and they came out perfect. And, I must say the leftovers tasted even better today! Thank you for this recipe -- it's a keeper.

Wow, this was so good and so easy!  I couldn't decide whether to throw caution to the wind and put in the whole cup of butter or try half like some other reviewers did, so I compromised and used 3/4 cup.  Very very good, but next time I will try half the butter and also add a little white wine.

Fabulous! The dijon mustard makes this - it really rounds out the sauce.  I used one with a little horseradish in it, and I'm seriously in danger of eating the entire dish.  I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" - not that that makes it healthy, there's a lot of it in this, but for a special treat this is a wonderful (and fast!) dish.

Excellent as is.  Rich but what else would you expect?  Made the way it was written and the whole family loved it, even the kids.  A definite keeper!

I have made this several times already and think it is great.  It is a very easy go to meal on nights where time is short.  It is not exactly like a traditional scampi but still delicious.  Serve over pasta or rice.

Family approved! I had used 1 tablespoon creole mustard because that's the only grainy mustard we had. I was worried at first but the results were amazing. Someone had mentioned about sprinkling old bay seasoning to shrimps for it to stick, so I'm going to try that next time.

I love shrimp, so this was a great recipe!  I haven't baked it before, always pan fried.  I think you have more control over doneness in a pan, but this was easy.  I halved the butter and still had tons of sauce in the end for over veggies or pasta.

Great simple recipe =) This came out tasting way better than any resturant. I did tweak it a bit. I added 5 cloves of garlic and once the shrimp were in the baking dish I sprinkled them with some grated parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. The dijon mustard really gives it that Pop, but you would never guess that it was mustard. Every last shrimp was devoured! We served this dish along side with some olive oil and garlic vermicelli.

When we ate this the first night, it just didn't "wow" us.  I made as directed, using the full amount of butter so I could serve over angel hair pasta.  When we reheated the leftovers the next night, we added a sprinkle of parmesan cheese, and we both agreed that this greatly improved the dish.  I may try this again with the addition of white wine.

I just made this, since I had some shrimp on hand and it seemed like a quick and easy dinner, and it was fantastic!  I scaled it down for two, and had to substitute a little orange juice in for the lemon juice, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It tasted like a meal that took far longer than 30 minutes to prepare.  This recipe is a keeper!

One of my favorite meals is scampi. It shocked me that something so delicious only took a few minutes to make. I will be making this very often.

I just made this tonight and it was fantastic! All I had was frozen pre-cooked shrimp (I dethawed it first!) and it turned out great. My husband who normally isn't a big fan of shrimp didn't leave any leftovers.  My 1-year-old loved it too! Thanks for the great recipe

This has become a WEEKLY meal in our house... tastes sooo difficult.. but is so easy to make! we havent been to olive Garden since discovering this recipe.. We sprinkle the top with freshly grated parmesan and fresh diced tomatoes... My husband refuses to allow me to make this when I have people over because he likes to enjoy the leftovers!

I'd give it 5 stars for easy preparation. Not enough of a sauce when I served it over my whole wheat pasta. It absorbed most of it. Great flavor though. I added some broccoli florets in for a veggie to go with it. The shrimp only took about 10 minutes to cook also. Thanks for the recipe.

So yummy! I halved the recipe and kept the same amount of butter. I also made this on the stovetop by sauteing the garlic, parsley, mustard and the zest of the lemon I used, then tossing in some frozen shrimp at the end. Served this over linguini with a garden salad and breadsticks..so good! :)

The best shrimp scampi ever! I did modify the recipe but not by much. I only used 1/2 cup butter which was still an entire stick and I added a drizzle of olive oil and good splash of good quality dry white wine (probably a 1/4 cup). I was tad apprehensive about using the mustard but I figured all these excellent reviews can't be wrong, and I went ahead and used it. You can not even tell there is mustard in the dish but it does add great flavor. I like my scampi with sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts so I added about a half cup of each. I love how you can just put this in the oven while your pasta is cooking. My family loved this dish, even my 2 year old daughter.

OH! MY! WORD!--this is DELICIOUS!  I stuck with the original amounts of everything, and simply added 3/4 a cup of some white wine.  (I used the extra sauce over some angel hair pasta.)  Lowered the oven temp to 425 (so I could throw the garlic bread to cook along with); everything was done in 10 minutes.  AWESOME, AWESOME meal.  Many thanks to you, Kimber, for a truly wonderful meal.

Wonderful recipe and super easy. The only changes I make is to sprinkle shrimp with a little old bay seasoning,Italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese, so the butter clings to the shrimp better.Serve with angel hair pasta and broccoli with cheese sauce.Not really healthy but for a treat it is an awesome meal.

A delicious, fool-proof recipe for a last minute meal and also perfect for guests.  It's simple and quick, yet looks very elegant.  I serve it over linguini and with a salad and it's a hit every time.

Very good. I omitted the parsley and added thyme, basil, and oregano. Also I doubled the garlic. It was very very good with pasta and not nearly as bland as some other scampi recipes. I will make this one again.

What a delicious sauce this makes for shrimp. I did a quick saute of some red and green pepper strips, onion and mushroom and added that to the shrimp before baking. I subsituted a little olive oil for the butter just to make it a little less decadant. I served it over spaghetti. My husband raved about it. Will definitely be making this again.

Mixed reviews here, I would think that something with this much butter would be excellent. It was really a splurge to eat a dish with so many calories on a Tuesday night and I don't think the scampi was worth it! I increased the garlic and added a splash of wine as per other reviews and that didn't add much flavor. After a few bites, my hubby suggested we sprinkle some old bay on it so that was my first clue that he wasn't a fan of this dish either. It tasted ok but I would probably not make it again. I had shrimp fresh off the boat since I live in Coastal GA. so I know that wasn't the problem! BTW: Everyone is different so if you decide to try this out, Do Not cook as long as the recipe states unless you want rubber shrimp!

I gave it five due to the ease of cooking, but as others have said cut the butter to half a cup, I also added a dash of hot sauce to the blend of butter and garlic for  some heat....great!

This is SO, SO, SO good!  I have made it many times for guests as well as my family and everyone agrees it is better than any restaurant scampi they have had.  I follow the recipe exactly, but I also like to add buttered panko crumbs to the top before cooking for a little crunch.  Thank you for this recipe, it is a keeper!

Super yummy, easy and easily adjusts to taste. Only changes I made were tons more garlic and lemon; I'm sure it would have been fine without the extras.

Well, this one's a keeper folks.  It was simple to make, and delicious to eat!  Do not use two sticks of butter.  One stick is plenty!!  Throw in a little white wine too.  I sprinkled panko crumbs over the top before I baked.  Served it tossed with angel hair pasta.  Perfect!

Absolutely delicious!!  I used a two pound bag of pre-cooked, peeled and deveined shrimp, just to save some time.  For the sauce I cut the butter down to 3/4 cup and added a 1/2 cup of white wine.  Otherwise, I made no other changes.  Served this with linquini pasta.  OMG!!  Sooooo good!  Enjoy!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I made some changes that others recommended - 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup EVOO and 1/4 cup white wine.  Would add a litle more garlic next time.  Served over whole wheat pasta sprinkled with Parmesan.  My husband had not only 2nds but thirds as well.  There wasn't any leftovers.  Will make this again.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

I followed the suggestion of others: cut the butter in half.  I also used 1/4 c. of white wine, & Old Bay Seasoning.  I served this over linguine.  My family loved it!  Next time I will add clams.

I love butter, I love shrimp, and normally I love shrimp scampi. I really enjoy rich food but this literally made me sick. I appreciated the easy preparation, but I would try this with half the butter and a little more lemon. We did bake this for about 1/2 the time recommended so the shrimp wouldn't be rubbery, and we doubled the garlic. 
I would give this one star but a friend who dined with us liked it.

I used spicey dijon mustard and really liked it. I also cut the butter in half.  My husband didn't like it..but ate it anyways. He doesn't like garlic so I can see why.

So delicious.... Tates like it came from a restaurant.  My husband was very impressed. Served over bowtie pasta.  I prepared the recipe just as listed except I only used one pound of shrimp. Just enough for 3 people and the sauce is so good w/ french bread for dipping.

Super-easy recipe, didn't modify a thing, but did cut the recipe in half for just 2 people.  Very few ingredients make it something easy to make on the fly.  The dijon mustard + lemon juice are the keys to making it fantastic.  I boiled up some penne pasta while it was baking, and it made a fantastic meal!

I made this with cooked shrimp I thawed out, and I used Smart Balance marg. and olive oil combined to make the butter. I only had dried parsley and spicy mustard. My husband and I still loved it (I will make it better next time with fresh parsley and maybe even real butter!) and so did my 4 year old who is endlessly picky. I made buttered parm. noodles to go with it. Someone else said it may have curbed their Red Lobster craving, and I agree! I will make some garlic cheddar biscuits next time to go with this though, but there will definitely be a next time! Thanks for the super easy and delicious recipe!

I made this at the advice of others when I was unexpectedly hosting a dinner for my husband's band.  It was great!  I used the advice of others and melted the butter (1 full stick) along w/some EVOO, 2 heaping TBLS of pre-minced bottled garlic, a dash of lemon juice, and 2 big squirts of yellow mustard (no dijon here) in the oven as it was pre-heating in a glass cake pan.  I stirred, added the shrimp and coated, and then baked for about 10-12 minutes.  While it was baking, I boiled 2 boxes of linguine/fettucine (I also added a little butter to the baking shrimp to ensure I had enough "sauce" to coat 2 boxes of pasta).  I drained the pasta and tossed all together-then served sprinkled w/Italian blend shredded cheese.  Yum, yum.  So easy and so "fancy" looking!  Thanks for a great go-to recipe for unexpected company!

Made this for my daughter who loves shrimp. She ate it for dinner, and then for a bedtime snack too! Very easy to make, and looks impressive. I used extra large shrimp and baked for 12 minutes, which worked out fine. Add some chopped parsley on top too after you take it out of the oven for a prettier dish. The baked parsley is good for flavour, but turns dark.

Love,Love this easy recipe. Fast enough for a week night dinner, or "not chained to the kitchen" entertaining dinner.
Have lots of crusty bread for soaking up the butter,YUM!

Thought this was great as a time saver!  I substituted 1/4 cup seafood stock for an equal amount of the butter, added a splash of white wine, and topped it off with just a very light dusting of seasoned bread crumbs before baking it.  Served over pasta.

My brother took one bite of this and his eyes lit up--the rest was history.. He loved this and asked a few days later when i would be making it again. I dont think he has ever asked me to make something twice before. It was a HUGE compliment. If you love shrimp - even if you DONT love shrimp - you've gotta try this one.

I love this recipe! It is so easy and looks and tastes fancy! On the advice of other reviewers I just melted the butter mixture in the 13X9 dish in the oven. I did only use 3/4 C butter and that was plenty.  I also added 1/4 C of white wine which was also a previous reviewers idea. The second time I made this dish I added chopped broccoli to the melted butter mixture for a few minutes before I added the shrimp. It was very, very good!!

Delicious! I realized halfway into this that I didn't have dijon mustard, but I did have spicy brown so I used about 3 well rounded teaspoons of that instead. Used minced garlic, and cut the butter to about 3/4 cup. I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top for the last 5 minutes of baking to make a nice crust and help the sauce really stick to the shrimp. It was absolutely delicious! I served it over white rice. Would and will definitely make this again!

EXCELLENT!! This is a must try.  I cut the recipe in half and made the following changes.  I used 1 1/4 TBSP of Dijon mustard, 2 tsp of minced garlic, added some sliced green onions, a couple sprinkles of Old Bay Seasoning, Several shakes of parmessan cheese and a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  It was so flavorful and tasty!!! The Dijon mustard really makes this recipe!! Can't wait to make it again!

Actually, I think I would give this 4-1/2 stars if possible.  It was very easy.  I cut it in half (except for the garlic) and added just a splash of white wine.  Served with salad and crusty french bread it was great.  I also used the precooked shrimp with good results.  Might add a bit of lemon pepper or something for a little more zip next time - but there will definitely be a next time!

I used frozen cooked shrimp.  Doubled the garlic and decreased the dijon to only 1 tbsp.  Also added about 1/4 cup. white wine and topped off with Parm. cheese.  Served over spaghetti. Will probably cut down butter next time as suggested by others.  But very tasty.

I added more lemon juice, a 1/2 cup white wine and some parmesan. I only used about 1 Tbstp dijon and I thought the added flavor was great! Good base recipe, I liked the fact it was baked, not sauteed.

I feel a bit silly even rating this recipe, because I use this more as a guide then anything else. Shrimp is readily availible and cheap in Southern Alabama, we get ours fresh off the boat. 

Anyway, I omit the dijon mustard, clairify unsalted butter and garlic, steam the shrimp then add it to the butter to finish cooking, take the sauce off the heat to add the fresh herbs and parm. cheese. I serve it with salad and pasta.

I absolutely loved this and so did the fam. I added more garlic and lemon juice, less mustard, and added Old Bay and crushed red pepper. I am going to make again tonight. Thanks!!

This was very, very good.  I did use suggestions made by others:  Cut the butter to 1/2 cup, cut the mustard to 1/2 tbs, and double the garlic.  I used frozen raw shrimp that I thawed in cold water for about 15 minutes and then drained well.  I served it with rice.  Also good with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese.

My daughter says, "Great! Great! Great!"  She said it tastes just like Red Lobster or the Oliver Garden.  I think it tastes better because it's fresh, the shrimp are bigger, and I made it myself!  Bravo!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed was when I prepared it as the recipe stated, with raw shrimp, it made the butter sauce much thinner and since I served it over pasta, it didn't stick to the pasta very well. When I tried it with already cooked/deveined shrimp, the sauce was thicker, richer, and was the perfect texture for the pasta. Just make sure you use the lowest cooking time so the shrimp doesn't get tough.

Way to go Kimber!  This recipe is outstanding.  I followed it exactly, and would not change a thing.  The first time I made it I served it over noodles.  Last night I served it with rice pilaf, and buttered green beans almondine.  My children love this recipe, which is a real plus.  A keeper for sure!

This is a great recipe.  I pulled some shrimp out of the freezer and had dinner on the table in 30 minutes.  The mustard added a nice flavor.  I reduced the butter, increased the garlic, and found that my jumbo shrimp were perfectly cooked in 12 minutes.

This scampi was quite tasty. I headed the advice of others and baked the dish for a shorter time - 9 minutes. For an appetizer there amount of sauce if fine, but if you want to serve over pasta I'd double the sauce ingredients. I think next time I'll serve this as a side and make grilled steak as my main entree.

I thought this was awesome! I used grey poupon mustard and in addition to all of the other ingredients I added some garlic pepper, salt & cayenne pepper and it came out wonderful! Cant wait to make it again! I served it over fettuccine, but any pasta would work!

This was THE most delicious scampi I have EVER had!  I made the recipe exactly as listed, no changes.  I did not use store-prepared items - chop the garlic, squeeze a real lemon & chop real parsley - it makes a difference!  Nothing overpowered. 
 Sooo good.  I can't wait to try it with chicken!

I made this for dinner last night and it did not go over as well as I had hoped. I followed the recipe and I discovered that the bake time is off, the shrimp came out chewy. I made this with linguine noodles and there was enough sauce to mix everything together in one pan to serve. The noodles turned out to be the best part for my family. I did sprinkle Parmesan and Old Bay on the shrimp before pouring the sauce over to bake it.  Overall the flavors were good for me, it just needs to be altered in the length of bake time. Probably will not make again in the NEAR future but, I will be keeping the recipe. Thank you for sharing this.

I am NOT a mustard fan, but I made this as written and I wouldn't change a thing. I don't taste mustard in there, just a lovely, interesting...something. Served mine over fettuccini to use up all of that yummy sauce. Crazy fast and tastes like you slaved over it. SOLD.

This recipe was fine as is. Simple to make. I'll never understand people that give a 4-5 star rating then turn around and list all the changes they made. If you have to make all those changes then the recipe isn't worth the 4-5 star rating you gave it. Stop rating your changes vs the recipe.

This dish was absolutely delicious and so easy! The only adjustment I made was to only use 1/2 the butter. I served this over angel hair pasta, a side salad, garlic Parmesan French bread and the perfect wine! Definitely a make again recipe!

This was awesome! Will definitely make again! I did put Panko bread crumbs on top as others suggested. I did use all the butter listed in the recipe and didn't find it too much. It was the sauce! Will definitely make again!

This was a great success but I didn't follow it to a T.  I didn't have dijon so I used some spicy brown mustard.  I, too, added about 1/4 - 1/3 cup of white wine and it made it just perfect.  I think it needs some salt too, so I'd add that next time.  I'll make it again with my tweaks and love it!

I cooked it as the recipe called and it was tasty. It was more flavorful after I added some salt. I used smaller shrimp and would recommend removing the tails of the shrimp. It was very simple and easy.

Made it today, served over angel hair pasta with a creamy garlic herb sauce. A fresh warm loaf of Irish Soda Bread on the side. The Baked Scampi was delcious to the Max. Rave review from my wife, many compliments and so easy to prepare.
   Thank You all for this recipe.

Just made this tonight. I didn't realize shrimp scampi could be so easy and fast to make. Followed the recipe exactly but added an extra 1/2tsp of garlic and parsley to the dish. I also added pepper and paprika on top after baking. I served it over spaghetti.Will definitely be making this again.

Loved this!  Super simple!  I fixed as directed, but after tasting the sauce in the pan, I thought it needed more garlic as the mustard was a bit prevalent.  (Plus, I like strong garlic flavor.) After baking, though, the flavors married very well and the overly mustard taste was gone.  (As for Dijon, I used the Walmart brand Dijon--nothing like a Grey Poupon, etc.)  I don't think the additional garlic would've been necessary.  Delicious. Easy. Fast.  That makes it a perfect recipe in my cookbook!

Easy and delicious!  I read other reviews and took their advice. Added 1/4 cup Chardonnay, and mushrooms.  Added two cloves of garlic (will do three next time), lemon and parsley was perfect.  I added Panko crumbs as one reviewer suggested, and broiled additional 2 minutes.  I used frozen large shrimp.  So easy.  Perfect! Will do this again.

This recipe was perfect just as stated.  The dijon mustard was the ingredient that added perfect flavor to this dish.  My husband love it!  A keeper in my home.

This version of Scampi is great!  The addition of dijon mustard is unique and tasty, not at all overpowering.  I would have reduced the butter to half, as others suggested, however my husband took over and left it as written.  If we had served it over pasta, it probably would have been fine.  We also used thawed fresh shrimp which worked well.  The only other change I would make, is to double the amount of fresh lemon juice.  Cannot wait to have it again!

Super easy.  Super good.  What else can you ask for?  The hardest part for me was peeling the shrimp.  I will be making this again.

AMAZING!! I have been cooking for years- research recipes all the time and read reviews before trying new things!  This was one of the best recipes I've ever prepared- my husband and I devoured it!! My modifications were: 1lb frozen pink shrimp- thawed, shelled, deveined and tail off, 3 tablespoons mined garlic ( I used organic jarred garlic), 1/4 cup diced sweet onion, 2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, about 1/2 cup fresh parsley, and the FULL 2 sticks of butter, I simmered mine for about 10 minutes allowing the onions to get soft and the smell of the ingredients simmering together gave me a hint that this was going to be something unique and delicious.  I used 9x9 baking dish and put shrimp in almost 2 stacked, but staggered and poured the mixture over them and it covered them entirely. Baked at 450 for exactly 10 mins and then I served mine over linguine, so the additional sauce was poured over the pasta and this was EXCELLENT!!!! Topped with fresh grated Parmesan, not canned or processed. That was our meal!!!!! It was like a fine, fine Italian restaurant meal!! We have two servings left and will have it tomorrow! Thanks for the great recipe and additional tips!!

This is defiantly going into the regular dinner rotation. I'm not normally a seafood person but this dish is fantastic. Flavorful without being overpowering, buttery but not greasy, an absolute delight of flavor and super easy to make.

Awesome recipe! I would give it 5 stars but i didnt follow the recipe exactly. I didnt measure any ingredients which is ok. I added a very very large gulp of wine (full glass plus a splash) to the butter mixture. Added panko breadcrumbs and fresh parmasan cheese before i put it in the oven. 10 mins at 410. my oven cooks hot. I was really really good but I dont think i would do as much bread crumbs next, about 2 handfuls. Boyfriend loved it! He wouldnt if he knew I put wine in it:) He thinks I drank the whole bottle.. :)

This is a great recipe.  I did make 1 change. I replaced the cup of butter with 1 cup of olive oil. The family insisted that I had used butter after then enjoyed their meal.  NO BUTTER.  I cooked up some white rice and I prepared cauliflower rice as I wanted to limit my carb intake. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal.  Will certainly make this again.

Three words:  Ah May Zing!  I don't know why I waited so long to make this--everyone loved it, and it was hard for me to stop eating it!  Rich and satisfying, pleasing to the palate, what else can I say?  I served it with whole wheat linguini and steamed broccoli.  This isn't diet fare, but knowing I was going to prepare this for dinner allowed me to cut back during the day.  11 points+, but I left most of my portion of sauce in the pan.  I am a happy woman.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious! I halved this recipe for 2 people. Added 1/2 cup good white wine, a splash more lemon and dash more parsley because I used dry. Kept everything else the same. Baked raw medium sized shrimp for 10 minutes and they were perfect. I don't know what the heck others are talking about with the mustard. I used what the recipe required or more (just eyeballed it) and didn't even taste it in the dish. Make sure you are using Dijon and not yellow. Also, keep in mind if you are using an alcohol in the dish, mustard is a necessary emulsifier for the butter/oil and the alcohol so don't leave it out (google emulsifiers if you don't know what I mean). This was an easy, delicious comfort food I will most definitely make again. BTW I ladled the shrimp and sauce over the individual pasta bowls as needed and had plenty of sauce left over, so cutting down on the butter might be ok depending on your number of guests. Thanks for a great recipe Kimber, I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! I had gotten some shrimp on sale from our local Fresh Market and I wasn't really sure what I was going to do with it. I ended up using some of the modifications that were suggested below and it was great! I actually mixed up the ingredients and let the shrimp sit in it for about 40 min, I chopped up onions and added those as well because I love onions. I had large shrimp, so I baked them for 7 min and I also used the modification of broiling them for the last 3 min with breadcrumbs and parmasean cheese sprinkled over the shrimp mixture. I never know what to do with Shrimp and this was perfect. I loved the tang of the mustard (I used spicy brown mustard because that's what I had). Delicious!

Soooooo yummy! I didn't have any lemon juice so I used white wine. Perfect! Served on top of spaghetti noodles and topped with a sprinkling of parmesan. Definitely a keeper - even my picky hubby and toddler liked it!

I was greatly anticipating this recipe as it contains all the ingredients that my husband and I love.  I was very disappointed at the lack of flavor---it would need lots of addition "zip" to rate a better rating.  I followed the directions exactly except for adding a small splash of white wine.  It just did not do it for me.  Sorry!  I usually agree with the majority of the raters of any recipes I try but this is the first time I sadly disagree.

Delicious. First made the sauce with the mustard and didn't like it at all, it was very overpowering. Dumped it out and started over without the mustard and it was perfect. If your not a huge mustard person it would prob. be best to cut it way down or omit altogether. We had it over brown rice and it was really yummy.

A new hearty and a keeper meal for my family. This is delightful dish that we can either have it with noodles or rice. Such a yummy dish. Made this healthy meal by cutting the butter into 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup olive oil. Halved my Dijon Mustard, tripled my chopped garlic, doubled my fresh parsley and a splash of white wine. This is such a superb dinner for my family. Thanks Kimber!

I made this last night and my husband loved it, I did use large shrimp and cut them in half long way just so they were a smaller bite and to cook faster. I used more garlic just because we love it. I mixed everything and tossed it in a pie plate, put it back in the fridge for an hour or so then just popped it in the toaster oven for about 10 min, just keep an eye on them to not overcook. I had pre cooked linguine fini from barilla (which I find a thinner linguine) then tossed it in boiling water for a couple of min to reheat. I also had tossed some Brussel sprouts in olive oil, salt, pepper cooked at 400 till crisp also in the toaster oven before the shrimp put them in some foil and placed them on top of the toaster oven to keep heated, served on side this is a great start to a scampi but next time I might add some white wine and parm cheese. as for the mustard really did not notice it but considering it was yummy I would keep it in as I am sure it did add to the dish, easy and yummy

Excelled taste but all that butter makes me feel guilty eating it... even after cutting the amount of butter in half.  I'll probably use this as an appetizer instead of as a main dish.

liked the flavor, wish I would have used raw shrimp instead of frozen, would make again. I didn't use as much butter as directed as 1 cup seemed too much.

Thank you for such an easy and delicious dish! The only thing I did different was to add some fine bread crumbs, grated parmesean, and salt an pepper on top before it went into the oven.  This recipe is definately a keeper!!

I wish I could give it more stars. This is by far the best shrimp scampi I have tasted, the wife agrees. I followed the recipe as stated except I took the tails off the shrimp and then served over homemade pasta. This is a must keep and will be making again and again. 
And Again.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I used a little more mustard than called for and used frozed shrimp but made everything else as is. Next time I think I'll do half the amount of butter and add some half and half but only because I like a "saucier" sauce.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe even though I failed to shell the scrimp.  I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and added a splash of wine.  Next time I plan to use 1 cup of butter and double the other sauce ingredients.  It is really delicious.

This is was pretty good, extremely quick and easy.  The amount of mustard was just right, I think most people maybe just smelled it more than they tasted it.  The smell was strong as it was cooking, but I didn't really taste it once we ate.  Maybe will add white wine to the sauce as another reviewer did.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  I bought just-caught bay shrimp, peeled and deveined them, and found this simple recipe. My husband and three children aren't fans of shrimp, but not one shrimp was left on any plate.

This recipe is great. Added some extra garlic and used the full amount of butter. It made extra sauce but if your putting it on spaghetti or anything like that it works out great.

OMG Heaven. I modified the recipie some. I didn't have dijon mustard so I added Stone Ground Mustard. I added pesto and a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil as well. I poured this over 1lb. of shrimp and 1lb. of mussels and then baked. After baking I tossed this with pasta. It tasted as good as what you would find in a restraunt and at a quarter of the cost. It was wonderful, will definitely make again when I want to indulge in such a rich sauce.

Delicious.. and EASY  this way. I simply sauteed shrimp in the ingredients[left out Dijon-was afraid it would alter flavor too much]. With shrimp, one only needs to cook a very short period of time, so I watched as the color changed. Served over pasta. BTW: to be healthier, I used Smart Balance, which we use in lieu of butter. Try this recipe-you will love it. Thanks Kimber

So quick and easy! I also added a bit of white wine and topped with parmesan cheese. It was delicious. I served over fettuccine then served a nice toasted crusty load of bread to dip in the delicious sauce!

This was yummy!  I did use a full cup of butter and tasted good except made me feel guilty of eating such a high calorie dish...  I served over penne.  I think I'll cut butter to 1/2 cup next time.

Easy, straightforward recipe.  Next time I'm going to use less oil and cook the shrimp for less time - they turned out a bit too dry and oily for our liking.

This is crazy good. I have never had much luck with shrimp - this was fantastic! I did cut a little of the butter and made up for it by adding a little more lemon in hopes of making if a little lighter. Really really good. This would be good for an impressive dinner party!

This was pretty good, as is, and a great base recipe to create your own spin on shrimp scampi. I sautéed 1 Tbls. finely chopped onion and garlic in 2 Tbls. Of the butter then deglazed the pan with about 1/3 cup white wine. Then melted the rest of the butter, added the rest of the ingredients along with 1 tsp. Crushed red pepper. Baked for 10 minutes.
Served it over rice with some crusty French bread.

Wonderful recipe. I only had frozen cooked shrimp so I made the sauce and then reheated in the baking dish and when the sauce looked really hot I dropped the defrosted shrimp in and left in the oven for 5 minutes.  They were perfect.  I served over rice so we could take advantage of the great sauce.  (I also added white wine as another reviewer suggested)

This was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!!!! Every ingreadient is perfect! I did add a dash of Old Bay seasoning like others suggested because I had it on hand. For my oven, I will next time shorten the time in the oven. This is an absolute KEEPER!!!! And I will definately be making this again. My Family loved it with the Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this site. And I served it with Angel Hair pasta which was delicious with the butter from the Shrimp Scampi Bake drizzled on it!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!!

I expected the Dijon to add a nice flavor but I found it too overpowering.  I think I would try again without the Dijon and just let the more traditional lemon-garlic flavors do their job.

I made it for the super bowl and it was tasty but I think the recipe could use a little more spice... maybe more lemon or more mustard.

This is probably one of the easiest and tastiest dishes I've ever made. I've never baked shrimp before. We've always grilled or cooked them on top of the stove. How simple to bake it! I didn't change much with the original recipe. I left the amount of butter, because I made the copy cat version of the Red Lobster Biscuits. I wanted the "extra" juice so we could dip the biscuits. lol! I also added some white wine to the mixture and it really enhanced the flavor. I made it a few hours in advanced, put the dish in the fridge and let it sit. Its turned out incredible! I served it with baked potatoes and steamed veggies. What a great dinner!

We kind of liked it but DANG - it was DRENCHED in butter.  Cut it in half and then some!  We added more garlic, 1/2 cup of white wine (unnecessary) and left the parsley off.  Serve it over linguine, with Red Lobster rolls (mmmm) & do NOT cook broccoli with the pasta.

Loved this recipe, it's so easy and my family likes this scampi version better than our favorite Italian restaurant. Added a little more garlic and I followed others suggestions by adding some Old Bay and Parmesan.  May try the Italian breadcrumbs next time too.

Love it!  It's SO easy and would be a nice meal to make for company - you wouldn't be slaving away while everyone else socializes - you can prepare the shrimp ahead and throw it together right before serving.  My family loves it!

My husband and I love shrimp, but this is the first time i've actually cooked it. This recipe made it simple and delicious! I was nervous at first about the dijon, I was thinking there is no way mustard and shrimp can be good together, but boy was I wrong; my husband complimented the dish the entire time he was eating!!! I did double the butter mixture because I wanted extra sauce for pasta, but other than that I didn't change a thing to this simple, yet delicious shrimp scampi. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. This was fantastic! I noticed a lot of reviewers reduced the amount of sauce but we kept it the same as instructed and poured it over beans, carrots and cauliflower, which tasted awesome. I had fairly large shrimp, and they were perfect after 10 minutes.

This yummy dish was fast and easy! I followed some of the other reviews and only used 1/2 cup of butter and added 3/4 cup white wine and it turned out great. I also used frozen shrimp that I thawed ahead of time, which worked out fine.  I served it over fettuccine. I will make this again soon!

This was very good. I made as written but for omitting the mustard and adding a bit of sea salt. I found the cooking time far too long even for jumbo shrimp. Mine were done in under 8 minutes. Very good, thank you!

Yum, this tastes just like shrimp scampi. The only thing I changed was that I used dried parsley rather than fresh, but it still turned out great!!

I make this about once a week. Best scampi we have ever had. My family craves this! We like to put it over spaghetti squash for a low carb dinner! Yummy!

This was amazing. The mustard gives a really good flavor. I also added a splash of white wine and before putting in the oven covered the shrimp with some bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. Delicious!!! So easy to make also.

So quick, easy and delicious!  We used fresh Mississippi Gulf Coast shrimp and added some white wine, which gave it a little something extra.  Thanks for this new way to make shrimp!

My husband loved this and  thought this tasted just like Red Lobster when I made it. That was the best compliment I've gotten from him! I thought it was good but it needed more garlic. (I used freeze-dried garlic so that may have been why.) It was my first time making a shrimp dish with raw shrimp. The store only had cooked shrimp and raw shrimp with the shells on, so I went with the raw shrimp and I had to de-shell and de-vein the raw shrimp myself in icy cold water. It was pretty simple but time consuming. I really liked the advice of one user and used a couple handfuls of panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese over the top. I did half with the bread crumbs and cheese and half without. The breading was really good too. Overall it was very good either way!

Absolutely delicious! I make it exactly as is, but I only bake for about 8-10 minutes by suggestions of others. I also use frozen shrimp and thaw it before baking. Great, great recipe. I make it all the time!

Wow, this was delicious.  We had 2 lbs. of leftover steamed shrimp from a party, and wanted to make a meal.  We used this recipe and followed to the letter on ingredients.  Our shrimp wasn't raw, so we removed the tails and cooked it with the sauce at 450 for about 10 minutes, and it came out perfect!  Served over angel hair pasta - everyone loved it.  Definitely a keeper and highly recommended.

I've never tasted shrimp before but i decided to give this recipe a whirl. My mom adored it! She said it was the best she's ever had and harssed me for a month to make it again lol when i never got around to it she made it herself but said it wasn't the same. I'd suggest spicing up the shrimp before cooking it. I coated it in salt, pepper, garlic powder, adobo, and sason. it sounds like tons of seasoning but it came out fantastic! I also used the garlic that comes in a jar rather than chopping it up, and threw in some white wine. To end i tossed the buttery mixture over some linguine and it looked and tasted phenomenal :)

This was so easy to make and so tasty!  I removed the tails just so we could dig in faster. My parents loved it and my teenager had seconds (which is not normal for him with shellfish) We loved this!

This is amazing! I just got done making this dish i am serving it with penne noodles. I added salt and pepper to the butter and dijon mustard mixture it deff needed some and i also salted the shrimp before i poured the mixture over it! also i used 1 1/2 stick of butter and 3 in a half table spoons of garlic because we like a LOT of sauce & i wanted extra sauce to cover the noodles and am also feeding 6 people :) THIS IS GREAT AND EASY I WILL BE MAKING THIS A LOT.    THANK YOU

This recipe is so yummy and easy, easy, easy! I followed all of the ingredients, but modified the portion of butter (for dieting purposes). I also added a tablespoon of old bay. The flavors meshed very well together. We ate it over rice, but will definitely try with angel hair pasta. The great part about this dish is that it would actually be fine by itself. Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!!

I made this recipe for Valentine's Day.  It was very easy and very good.  It does need a good bit of salt and, for me, fresh lemon.  I have also made it halving the butter, but not halving the other sauce ingredients, and it was just as good.

This is TO DIE FOR!!!  Very rich, so having just a little of the sauce goes a long way, but it is sooo delicious!  It tastes like something you'd get at a gourmet restaurant, and way better than your chain seafood place.  We got a lot of sauce out the recipe, so I would probably have some extra pasta or biscuits on hand to put it over.  We will definitely make this again!  I may even try to put this on chicken!

I tried this recipe last night for dinner and my dh and I loved it!  This was so easy to make and the shrimp was cooked perfectly after 12 minutes.  I halfed the recipe because I only had one pound of shrimp, but next time I will make the recipe as stated even with only one pound of shrimp.  I used white wine in place of the lemon juice.  Served over vermecelli.  Delicious......

A nice recipe- I will make this again, with a couple of changes.  First, the baking time should be much lower, somewhere between 5 and 7 minutes.  I used frozen shrimp that I thawed, and it worked just fine.  Per other reviewers suggestion, I cut the butter in half and it was plenty...unless you're expecting guests and need a lot of sauce.  Otherwise, 1/2 c is plenty.  I didn't have dijon and substituted hot mustard.  It added a little something, but next time I will definitely use dijon.  Also, next time I'll add a little white wine and old bay.

This was delicious.  I poured the sauce over some tilapia that I had cooked separately for my shrimp-hating boyfriend (who hates shrimp??!) and baked it and the shrimp in the oven with a bit of panko breadcrumbs on the top.  Served over rice with broccoli on the side. I will definitely make this again.

LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I had not made Shrimp Scampi in years, but I don't think I'll ever make it any other way again!  I made this with frozen cooked shrimp, which I thawed, rinsed, and patted dry before sprinkling with Old Bay and covering with the sauce.  I'm giving the recipe 4 out of 5 because I tweaked the sauce: only used 1/2 cup butter, and doubled all the other ingredients EXCEPT the dijon.  Also, I think the suggested cooking time is way too long, even if you're using fresh shrimp.  Either way, there was plenty of sauce for the shrimp and for drizzling over pasta and it was all so delicious!!!

My oh my, was this yummy!!  Like almost everyone else, I cut the butter and added a bit of white wine, and extra garlic (which I do with all recipes with garlic!), and also I used spicy brown mustard cuz it was all I had, and lordy, it was good!  And so easy!  Even cutting the butter, there was plenty of sopping up stuff for the garlic bread.  I did one thing that turned out great:  I made the butter sauce ahead of time,  defrosted the shrimp, peeled them and put the sauce on ahead of time, then let it sit for about and hour.  The sauce then turned into a paste, and sat there, getting yummier.  So then the 12 minutes was just perfect for my medium-sized shrimpies.  Bottom line...easy, awesome and a crowd-pleaser!

This was so delicious! I added white wine, a little bay seasoning and parm cheese as suggested in the other reviews.   Will save and make again!

So good. So easy. I don't cook a lot of shrimp but this one was just perfect. My husband said it was the best shrimp he'd ever had. We ate it with mashed potatoes and green beans. Yum!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I doubled the garlic. I put this on top of angel hair pasta and the 1 cup of butter was perfect for that! I'll definitely make this again!

What a nice, easy, surprise of a recipe.  I used frozen and they came out a little rubbery so next time I will use fresh.  Loved the flavor and was a great sauce for pasta.

This was amazing! I didn't really have enough shrimp, so I added some canned chicken in with the shrimp. I also didn't have any dijon mustard, so I mixed mayo and mustard together. I put it on top of spaghetti noodles. My mother and I enjoyed it very much. Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

This is SO Yummy!  I couldn't wait till lunch time for my leftovers!  I cut the butter to 1/2 cup and added some olive oil instead.  I also added about 1/3 cup white wine.  I served this over linguine, with a salad on the side.  Fantastic!

Super easy and delicious.  Didn't have dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown.  Tossed with pasta, snow peas and shredded parmesan.  Will make again and again this same way!

I incorporated the most helpful review, and I wish I didn't.  I think the recipe would have been better with a full cup of butter (Eeek - must hit the gym tomorrow!) and 2 Tbsp of Dijon mustard, as the recipe calls for.  The reason why??  The extra sauce is the perfect accompaniment to a full 16oz. box of cooked pasta.  The only minor thing I would do is cook the fresh garlic in a wee bit of butter before adding the other ingredients to the saucepan, as the 12-15 minutes in the oven wasn't enough to cook the garlic and it seemed a bit raw.  Otherwise, the recipe is PERFECT as is.

Simple and yummy!  I reduced the cook time to 8 minutes and that was definitely sufficient.  The sauce is delicious served over pasta.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Husband said it was restaurant quality and worthy of serving to dinner guests.

This is my second time making it and like the first time it came out perfect. The only difference I did was to triple the garlic and add cheese. My guests loved it!!! This is a keeper!!!

When it comes to food, my boyfriend is incredibly picky.  This is the first dinner I have made him where he said "very good."  And he even said it a few times.  I'm new to the whole cooking thing and in the almost 2 years we've been together, this is the best response I've gotten from him.  I didn't give it a 5 because I think with a few more tweaks (more garlic and more mustard) it will be even better.

This is a yummy recipe! I tried it on shrimp and then again with flounder.  Both times it was delcious.  What I liked about this recipe was the fact that it was quick and easy and yet very yummy.  I added a dash of red pepper flakes to notch up the zing factor!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars, even though I made some changes. I wasn't sure about the mustard, so I only added 1 TBL instead of 2, which seemed to be perfect. I also added 1 extra clove of garlic to the 1 TBL. And I added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to all the ingredients heated on the stove. With a few minor changes for personal taste, this scampi was awesome! Its the best I've found so far. And super easy!! Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly as it calls for the first time. I cooked it for about 9 minutes. They turned out good but it was a bit too buttery. The next time I made it, I added 3/4 cup of butter, double garlic, extra lemon juice, and a spritz of crushed red peppers. I also turned the oven down to 400 degrees and cooked a few minutes longer to let the flavor soak in. Excellent!! I have also tried it with minced garlic, does not have the same great flavor. Won't use minced again!

I made this last night and it was great.  I followed the recipe as written, only added sauted onion, red peppers, yellow peppers to give some color also served over whole wheat pasta.  Just had it for lunch it tasted even better today!:)  Thanks for the easy great tasting recipe.  I will make this when I'm requested to bring a dish.

This was really good and easy.  I increased the garlic, and the parsley.  I decreased the butter by 1/4 cup.  Served over Linguine.  I baked for only 10 minutes.  It was plenty of time.

This is a great recipe. Made a romantic meal by, throwing it in a casserole dish on top of cooked angel hair pasta and crumbled some asiago cheese on top. Baked until the cheese melted, so delicious...sooo easy. My DH thought I'd out done myself for his birthday, if only he knew:)

I made this dish for my boyfriend and I and we both thought it was amazing!  I did make a couple slight variations based on the reviews of others.  In the butter mixture I used significantly more garlic, added a little white wine, and a little salt and pepper.  I didn't think the butter was too much at all, it was the perfect amount of sauce.  For the bake I added some fresh diced roma tomatoes,  some grated parmesan cheese and bread crumbs sprinkled on top.    I served it over linguini noodles with a ceasar salad and garlic bread.  Yum!!

I make this once a month.It always works and is so cheap. A big bag of shrimp from Wal Mart is about $10.00 and makes 2 dinners and pasta or rice and you have an elegant dinner..6 stars.

Way too much butter... we doubled the recipe to make extra sauce.. but even without the extra shrimp the sauce was too buttery and bland.  We had to throw it into a skillet and add some white wine, onion powder, garlic powder, salt & pepper, and we decided to add some cornstarch to thicken it, as it was too watery.  Tasted a bit better with the changes, but we still threw the leftovers away.  Would not make again.

Spectacular!  Made a few changes - added white wine, panko bread crumbs and parm cheese.  We didn't have raw shrimp, so I used cooked and it came out tasting very fresh and light.  Not greasy, like most scampis.  We will definitely make this again!

This was SO good (even my kids totally love it!).  I actually substituted one thing by mistake and it made it taste even better - I used half a cup of Country Crock (which is the "butter" I use) and the other half a cup I used real butter.  This is a definite keeper!

Wonderful and very easy. Make sure you have lots of crusty bread to dip in the buttery garlic sauce. ;)

My family and I really enjoyed this.  I also took the advice of other posters and used less butter.  I put in about 3 tablespoons and also used some olive oil and white wine.  I will definitely make this again.

Used all the butter, a healthy splash of wine and some parsley and while there was plenty, every drop of sauce got sopped up with some good bread. Yum!

This was amazing!  It was so easy, I walked into my house and within 45 minutes had dinner on the table.  I couldn't believe how incredible the taste was, but better yet, how simple it was to put together!  No mustard taste at all...I asked my husband, just to make sure...He verified between "mmmmm's" of approval...I did add some parmesan and mozzarella cheeses on top before baking, because you can't go wrong with cheese!  Thanks for making my weeknights a lot easier, and more delicious!

I wasn't sold on the mustard but figured I should try the recipe as close to written as possible.  Of course, I did add a glug of white wine and some fresh chopped basil and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I did double the garlic, just cuz we LOVE the stuff.  I served it with wild rice pilaf (from Trader Joe's) and grilled broccoli.  Tasty.  I think i would cut down on the mustard just a tad.

We have fresh shrimp available all year, thus, this is a fairly familiar recipe.
We do however completaly devain the shrimp (two veins in shrimp), and use clarified butter to taste as well as a little tabasco for additional flavor.
This recipe lends itself to many variations according to ones tastes.

My husband and I just finished the Shrimp Scampi Bake and both thoroughly enjoyed it. I read a lot of the reviews before I made it and did adjust some ingredients. I cut the butter, lemon juice and mustard in half, and next time I will use all of the butter and lemon juice, and just a tad more mustard. I also added some white wine to the butter mixture and will keep this ingredient.  Again, it was delicious!

VERY GOOD!  I made a couple variations...used 1/2 cup butter and it was plenty.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so used dried and it worked just as good.  Will definetely make again - I will try in individual dishes next time so each person gets a dish with butter sauce for dipping.  Great recipe!

This was really great! Made as is, and both hubby and I loved it. It is a little too rich to be in my regular rotation, however.
I like how the dijon kicks it up a notch; regualr scampi can be a tad boring. Thanks for sharing!

I made this tonight and it was great.  Word to the wise, go easy on the mustard and then add gradually to taste - I went overboard to start with and had to add more of everything else to balance the mustard flavor.

Followed other's advice, used only one stick of butter, added fresh parsley and about 3 big cloves of garlic, along with thawed frozen shrimp.  Needed noodles in a rush so I used Ramen noodles.  My son isn't a big shrimp fan, but loved the noodles with the sauce.  Easy to make. Will do again, thanks!

This was very good.  My husband loved it as is, I also followed the recipe.  I think it was way to much butter it made it very very rich, a little to rich for me but like I said my husband loved it. I would 1/2 the butter called for in the recipe and add more garlic the next time.  I really don't think my husband would even know the difference with less butter, you really don't need that much!

LOVE IT!!! I added 1/2 cup white wine and a little red pepper flakes. Made it for my neices' graduation party and everyone thought I had it catered by the restaurant up the street. Crusty warm bread is a must to soak up the sauce so you don't have to lick your bowl in front of paople!

Yum! This was great! I used frozen precooked shrimp, so I thawed them, made the sauce in the pan then threw the shrimp in there to heat up. Came out perfect! I didnt have any parsley and cut back on the dijon just a tad. Definitely will make this again!

I made this last night.  It gets high ratings for being so SIMPLE.  It misses that last star because something was just missing.  I'm not sure.  I added red pepper  (not too much, I've got a 5 and a 2 year old) and that made it better.  But still...
Maybe next time I'll saute an onion in the garlic and butter before adding the rest of the ingredients (that's how a friend of mine makes her scampi).
Oh, and I kept the shrimp in the skillet, covered, for about 10 minutes (as opposed to putting in the oven).

Fantastic.  I added a pinch of cayenne.  We ran out of sauce.  If you aren't planning to serve this with bread for dipping in the sauce or to put over noodles, cut the butter way down.  But if you are, it was not enough sauce for us, next time I will double it.

This was excellent!!!  We didn't have any leftovers.  I did add some white wine and had to use spicy brown mustard because that's what we had on hand.  This will be put in the dinner rotation.  I would love to try it grilled with the sauce brushed on and the rest for dipping.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was easy and made my family feel like we were out to eat.  It was seasoned nice.  This recipe is soo flexible that I plan on adding a little red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I didnt have parsley so I used some fresh cilantro that I had on hand.  Lovely recipe.

This was just ok.  Even after marinading the shrimp in the butter sauce, it seems like the shrimp didn't retain the butter flavor too well.  And I think the dijon needs to be cut in 1/2 becuase the flavor was a little awkward.  I did half shrimp, half scallops and served over angel hair w/ garlic bread.. it was tasty - just not exactly the shrimp scampi i'm looking for.

I normally will follow a recipe unless there's something in it that doesn't appeal to me. I didn't follow this recipe exactly, I changed a few things. I didn't have any parsley so I used about 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro. Instead of the mustard I used about 2 T. of Sherry. I melted the butter (I also used half)in a large sauce pan and added the herbs and garlic. I then put the shrimp (already cooked and thawed) in the butter sauce and let it marinate in the fridge for about an hour. While my Linguine was cooking I heated the shrimp over a low flame, don't want the shrimp to turn to rubber!!  I served it with homemade french bread that I sliced put butter on and sprinkled red pepper flakes and a little Gorgonzola. Put it under the broiler until the cheese melted. Served it with a crispy salad with Raspberry dressing, slivered almonds and dried cranberries.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven!! This recipe is a good base and you can add anything you like to it....  Thanks!

This was quick and easy.  I baked for the time listed and it turned out perfect.  My changes are as follows... I used 11 Tablespoons of butter, dried parsley, and 12 oz of shrimp.  Kept everything else the same.  Served over pasta.  Great recipe...

This was terrific!  Quick, everything on hand and very little prep or clean up - my kind of dish.  AND my family ate every last bite!  I followed the recipe exactly but I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top before baking.  It does taste like Red Lobster's shrimp scampi.  Will make this again and again.

I didn’t bake this, I sautéed the ingredients because I was using cooked shrimp. I didn’t want the shrimp to be chewy. Turned out great and my hubby LOVED it. Will make this again

I've made this twice now and last night I perfected the recipe to my taste.  I cut the recipe in half and used frozen shrimp.  I cut the 1 T of dijon mustard to about 3/4 T and it came out perfect.  I think I'm going to make it again tonight for my boyfriend!...  Oh I also cooked the frozen shrimp at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and sprinkled old bay seasoning on top before addding the garlic butter.

Made this last night for hubby and my brother. They inhaled this! I have the Rachael Ray oval sautee pan that I got for Christmas, and used this instead of baking the shrimp. I made the sauce as instructed, the dijon is a must. After I made the sauce I put in the shrimp, and just gently cooked them in the buttery garlic sauce, I also added some white wine while they were cooking. When they turned pink, I turned each one over and the smell was just outragous! Served with penne pasta, salad and garlic bread(I know more garlic!!). They loved it! Easy and quick to make. A definate keeper! Fresh garlic,lemon juice and parsley are a must for the best flavors, dont skimp for this dish.

I brought this dish to a potluck. This is delicious, but not for the faint of heart (very buttery). Don't go easy on the garlic or mustard - that's the punch that makes the recipe great!

We couldn't stop eating them! I tweaked it a little: added a dash of dry white wine and olive oil and decreased the butter by 1/8 cup. I used cooked shrimp--cooked for 10 minutes at 350. I have 4 lbs of shrimp in my freezer with this recipe written all over them!

I found that using the raw fresh shrimp the cooking time was perfect. when I used frozen shrimp it was less time. Made an excellent sauce for angel hair pasta just as the recipe is.

I used the whole amount of butter because I served this over Angel Hair pasta and wanted the extra sauce.
This was a very easy, quick and yummy dinner!

I make this recipe on a pretty regular basis with a few changes.  I found it too greasy the first couple times, so i cut the butter back to about half.  I also add more dijon, and once the shrimp is in the casserole dish, i sprinkle the top with bread crumbs to soak up some of the butter, and then some parmesan cheese.  Not all that healthy, but tasty!!!  I serve it on brown rice.  Fresh parsley and fresh garlic really help too

This gets a 5 for ease.  I halved the recipe, microwaved the butter mixture, mixed in a 1/4 c of grated parm and some red pepper flakes, poured it over the shrimp and baked for about 10 min.  Served over angel hair with some good crusted bread.  Super easy, good meal.  Thanks!

This recipe is EXCELLENT!!  I used extra large shrimp rather than medium, sprinkled parmasen cheese on before baking and let marinate in fridge for about half an hour.  The flavor is incredible!  Will be making again, and again and again!!

We loved this!  The only thing I did different was add a little more lemon juice, a little pepper, and topped with a little freshly grated parmesean when it came out of the oven.  I used large shrimp but still was done in about 12 minutes. I loved how fast and easy it came together. Served with fettucine alfredo and green salad. Thanks for a great recipe.  Will make again.

This dish was excellent!  We served it over yolk-free egg noodles.  It was a little bit too much butter so next time we will try halving the butter and adding white wine as other reviews suggest.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  I followed the recipe to a 'T' so I know what adjustments to make next time.  I agree with what some viewers wrote regarding cutting the butter down and adding more garlic.  It was very buttery with not a whole bunch of flavor (of course to some it may have had the perfect flavor).  I think I may up the garlic and mustard next time and maybe try the wine suggestion also.  I did make the sauce ahead of time and poured it on the shrimp and put it in the fridge for about an hour or two.  I served it over fettucini.  Family loved it and with a few adjustments it will be even better...

This dish was excellent.  I also cut the butter down to about 3/4 of a stick, used about 1/4 cup of white wine, topped it off with parmesean cheese. I used frozen shrimp and sauteed everything in a frying pan, and put it over angel hair pasta. This recipe was SO easy and delicious, will be great for a dinner party!

I didn't have dijon mustard so I omitted it altogether and it was so good without it that the next time I make it I probably won't add it.  (I did cut the butter in half and added a little olive oil and white wine.)

This is my go-to meal when I have company to feed and want to impress.  It is so easy to make that you can enjoy your company and not worry about ruining the meal.  It always gets rave reviews.  I serve it with long grain rice, bread and salad or steamed veggies.  Absolutely love it!

excellent recipe. I have used this as an appetizer as well as serving with rice pilaf and ceasar salad as a main course. One thing I added was a sprinkling of parm cheese on the shrimp.

This is fabulous!!  I combine all of the ingredients in the baking dish and melt them in the oven, then simply add the shrimp and return to the oven for the baking time.  I also add about a half to a whole cup of white wine.  Thanks for sharing!

I gave this 4 only due to my own shortcomings.  I was going to add breadcrumbs and a touch of Old Spice as suggested by another reviewer and just plain forgot (so much for planning ahead and having everything ready!) Only added 1 Tbsp of the mustard and next time I will also add a little more parsley. I did use the full amount of butter which I thought was fine.  By the way, in Canada we have Scampi which I guess would be the equivilant of US crawfish.  They are half way between a shrimp and lobster. Ours come from Norway (I think). So I'm always a little puzzled when I see a recipe with the word Scampi - and then there aren't any in the dish!  These are super easy being done in the oven and pretty much take care of themselves, which is a blessing while entertaining.

AWESOME!  Couldn't stop eating it!  I think you need to be a dijon-lover to fully appreciate!  I used only half the amount of butter, and it still made a LOT of butter sauce.  So I froze the leftover sauce, which I will use later on some fresh filet of salmon!  MmmMMm...can't wait!

Ok, here is it...EASY, EASY, EASY...PLENTIFUL and DELICIOUS!! I reduced the serving size to 4 and it was still PLENTIFUL for 6.  Now, my husband can't imagine serving butter on pasta...he's a gravy man!  HE couldn't get enough of this dish and reminded me this morning to make sure I go on-line to rate this a FIVE STAR!  And I AGREE!  Thank you VERY much!

We loved this, used frozen cooked shrimp, defrosted in cold water for 15 minutes added a little cayenne pepper for a little kick.  Like any recipe on this site you have to tweak it to your liking.  This was great and thanks for the post.

Did I do something wrong?  I didn't think this had enough taste for my liking.  It seemed like it was missing something.... more garlic? the addition of white wine?  It was okay.  I served with brown rice and parmesan and lots of s&p.  I probably won't try again.

I served this with angel hair pasta and topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I think fresh lemon would give it the zip it needed.  I omitted the onion and just used garlic.  mm- mm luvs to cook

Pretty good. I used less butter, 1/4c & less Dijon mustard, 2 tsp.  We did season the shrimp with Old Bay Seasoning before adding the sauce. Since I didn't have any fresh parsley I used dry, but it would be better, I'm sure, with fresh parsley. Will make again. EASY.

Yummy!!  I added some Portobello mushrooms sliced thin - on bottom of pan and crushed red peppers to give it some zip.  More garlic.  Spray pan w/Pam. Serve over Angel Hair w/parmesan cheese.

This was a good recipe.  The Grey Poupon really made a difference in the flavor.  I used dried parsley and frozen cooked shrimp and it turned out just fine.  15 minutes was plenty of time to cook the frozed shrimp as they came out hot.

This was a quick & delicious recipe.  I made a few modifications:  less butter, more lemon juice, more garlic, and spicy brown mustard.  I served this over linguine and my hubby and I loved every last bite!  Thank you for the great recipe.  I will definitely make this again, and will try some of the other suggested modifications.

Delicious! I added Old Bay and additional garlic and cut butter in half as previously suggested.  Also used frozen pre-cooked shrimp and it was extremely easy and very flavorful.

This recipe was great! I cut down on the butter a bit-used Old-Bay(as suggested by others) and topped it with a handful of  fine bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.If I could afford to eat this everyday I would.Two pounds of good shrimp isn't cheap.I thought the dijon mustard was perfect.Thanks for a awesome recipe.

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  My 12 yr old son and I made it for dinner together and then the next day for lunch, he made it all by himself.  We used easy peel shrimp and it took us no time at all to put together.

Wow is all I have to say! I made pasta as a base for this dish and there were no leftovers. My kids kept saying this is the best shrimp ever! I did sprinkle the raw shrimp with some Old Bay seasoning before adding the butter mixture. This one is a definite keeper!

Delicious, easy recipe.  I will add extra garlic next time.  I replaced some of the butter with olive oil and went a bit light on the mustard as others suggested.  Would be excellent with angelhair pasta or bruchetta.  I made grilled vegetables to go with it and the flavors blended very well.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was sooo easy. Impossible to mess up. I made mine with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup olive oil to cut down on the saturated fat and it was still very good. Try this recipe it fast, easy and GOOD!

We thought this recipe was just OK.  Too mustardy for me, and I didn't care for the texture of the shrimp.  I think I'll stick to grilling them.

Very easy to make and very tasty.  However, I do enjoy the sauce a little thicker and will probably add some flour when melting the butter.

Very, very good!  I made the sauce in a skillet and threw the shrimp in there with it on the stovetop...then tossed it with some spaghetti noodles.  Yum!  The mustard is a wonderful addition.

With all the 5 stars I thought we couldn't go wrong. This recipe tasted OK but even using half the butter (per many reviewers) I still threw out a lot of sauce. The mustard flavor (Grey Poupon) really didn't seem to go with the shrimp but extra lemon and a ton of Frank's Red Hot made them better. From now on we're sticking to our fav shrimp recipe which is simply to skewer the shrimp, sprinkle with cajun spice, grill or bar-b-q, squeeze of fresh lemon and dunk in melted butter. Much better!

This is AMAZING!  I only used 1 Tbsp of dijon mustard (because my husband is not a mustard lover) and served it over angel hair pasta.  We LOVED it.  In fact, my husband said to our 12-year-old son during dinner, "I'd be crazy to order this out ever again when your Mom makes it best - AND I can have seconds!"  A definite keeper in our home!

I searched for a shrimp scampi recipe  in mid-December, and came up with one that had butter, garlic, and lemon juice in approximately the same quantities as this recipe, so I presume this is the one I intended to make. Apparently, I left out the mustard altogether, and used pre-cooked shrimp (cooked maybe 7 minutes, I think), and it turned out great! I've previously had problems cooking shrimp (overcooked, ended up tiny), so this was a great experience. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous! I made this on New Year's Eve. Except for using 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, I followed the recipe. I used large Tiger shrimp and baked for 12 minutes. WOW! Served it over Fettucine and with a mild red wine to drink, Happy 2004!!

I made this for dinner last night and it was fantastic! Even better, it was so fast and easy to make. The only thing I changed was I substituted dried parsley for the fresh. Don't leave out the mustard...it really helps make the dish! I only baked it for about 10 minutes since some reviewers said that the baking time was too long in the recipe's directions. I spooned the sauce from the shrimp over rice.It would also be great with pasta.

East and delicious - what more could you ask for!.  I only used a 1/2 cup butter because I was not serving this over pasta.  (I would have used the entire cup if I used pasta).  I also added a touch more garlic since we are big garlic lovers.  We sopped up the butter garlic sauce with crusty Italian bread.  Yummy.

This recipe was SOOOO good! I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil, and half the mustard as suugested by another reviewer.  I was a little thrown off at first when the recipe called for dijon mustard, but now I see why it is needed.  The sauce was excellent over pasta.  I will make this again and again!!!

Delicious as written.  I decided to add some white wine,  less mustard and more garlic.  Instead of pouring the sauce over the shrimp I added the shrimp to the sauce and then  poured everything into my 13 by 9 pan.  When I don't serve over pasta I sprinkle panko breadcrumbs over them, seasoned with parm and Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.

This recipe was fabulous! My very sophisticated and discerning family members and guests all gave it 5 stars - a very difficult bar to achieve in this family. I did make the modifications suggested by Sydney on Dec 20, 2005 except that I used 4 lbs of shrimp and doubled the recipe. I have since shared the recipe with a friend, as modified, and her son can't  stop raving about it. From Sydney: "I too made some modifications to this great recipe. I used 24 oz. of frozen shrimp, with the tail on. Used only 1 tablespoon of mustard, and I added apprx. 1 tablespoon old bay seasoning, 3 cloves of chopped garlic and 2 tablespoons of fresh parsley to the butter mix. After placing in a non stick cookie pan (with sides), I sprinkled it with a mixture (about two handfulls)of panko bread crumbs and fresh grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese. The last two to three minutes of cooking, I placed the oven on broil (just long enough to brown the tops of the shrimp). OUTSTANDING!"

By far The best shrimp scampi recipe I have ever made. Made it exactly as a recipe called and then I put some angel hair pasta in with it to soak up the sauce and it was phenomenal. It will definitely be a staple in our house from now on. Easy and delicious what more could you ask for?

Only changes I made was a reduction in the amount of butter from 1 cup to 3/4 cup and added about 1/4 cup dry white wine as others suggested.   There was plenty of sauce and the Dijon mustard gave the dish a nice, subtle 'zing'.  Hubby loved it and we've eaten it for two meals and still have a few shrimp left over.  It warmed up nicely in the oven. I put it in when oven was starting to warm up and left it in for a few minutes after it reached 400 degrees.  It was plenty warm and still not overcooked.  First time we had it I served it on a bed of wild rice and that was good...but the second time, I served it mixed with angel hair pasta and it was excellent!  It is a nice, easy way to make shrimp scampi!!  Thanks!!

How easy and delicious! As I was squeezing the lemon, I zested about 1/2 tsp. lemon  into the mixture, making a big difference in flavour. Definitely a keeper.

I usually don't give 5 stars but had to since it was so easy to make and a great meal. I used the 1 cup of  of butter because I mixed it up later with angel hair pasta. I still could have gone down a tad with the butter. I added a splash of white wine to the butter mixture and then added parmesan on top before putting in the oven and again on top when it came out of the oven. Didn't even taste the mustard. Great easy meal with everything I had at home.

Really great recipe!  Made it as stated but just added a few things to suit my taste and ingredients.  I think the extra butter was fantastic, I don’t think you need to cut it in half especially if you are making pasta that needs the sauce.  I only used 1 pound of shrimp since it was for a smaller group.  I had tons of dried parsley so I used that and a slosh of white wine.  I seasoned the raw shrimp with lemon pepper and a bit of ground red pepper.  I poured the sauce and then added just a topping of bread crumbs and grated Parmesan.  This was fabulous.  Best scampi I’ve ever made.  I did heed the advice not to over cook and it was done in about 10 minutes.  Sooooo good will be making again!

Love this, it’s really easy and delicious. Next time, I would cut down the butter by about 25%. I didn’t have fresh parsley, but this is a must for next time. I also added Parmesan cheese and some lemon wedges too. Will definitely make again!

I don't like to make a habit of rating when I also alter a recipe but I will make an exception on this one. I followed suggestions to use 1/2 the butter, substituted sharp & creamy mustard because I had not dijon, used 4 cloves of garlic, and added 1 tbsp olive oil to add flavor. I only had cooked cocktail shrimp on hand that would have spoiled it not used so I cooked the sause on the stove then pulled tails and threw the shrimp into the butter sauce. I let it sit and absorb while I cooked the pasta then served topped with shredded Parmesan cheese.
I think you could slightly alter this timeless recipe to fit what you have on hand in almost any way and end up with melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness.

So Good!  I got some fresh super jumbo Mayport shrimp from a local vendor and wanted to make something with ingredients I already had. I adjusted the seasoning to suit my family. 1Tbsp Dijon mustard and extra garlic.  Served with spaghetti and Red Lobsters’s parmesan rosemary biscuit mix.  I reserved a 1/4c of the scampi butter to coat the biscuits.

Okay, I was skeptical, but this was very good, and very easy. My husband couldn't stop raving about it.  I added 1/4 cup white wine and about 1/4 tsp chili flakes.  I usually make scampi on the stove top, multi step process, but this tasted just as good, and was much easier.  I made a side of garlic pasta while this was baking and the whole meal was done in 20 min.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  Served it over a pound of angel hair pasta and this was as good a dish as I’ve ever had. If this isn’t  restaurant quality I don’t know what is.   My husband and I loved it and it was soooo easy to prepare.

One of the best dishes I've made and it tasted wonderful. I put it over angel hair pasta which made the dish lighter. My boyfriend could say enough about it!

I as a young chef used this simple recipe to try to wow my picky family and it did the job! I used a little less mustard than recommended  and I did have to travel to the store for a few of the items but it was so worth it!

7 22 17 ...http://allrecipes.com/recipe/25874/shrimp-scampi-bake/ ... This is good! I like Kimber's better.  She also has an awesome alfredo recipe, too Mmmm! I didn't add the mustard & definitely don't mind a good mustard, but wanted more traditional - to make the competition fair, too.  ;D  Thanks, again, Kimber!  :)

My husband and I really enjoyed this. So tasty. So easy. The only thing I did different was used dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh parsley. I will definitely make it again. Used the butter as indicated and served the shrimp and sauce over pasta. Did not find the mustard overpowering at all.

Taste was great!  More liquid (butter, of course) needed to be added to coat the 2 pounds of shrimp.  I served it over rice.  When I make it again I will use shrimp without the tail left on, so that only a fork is necessary.

This was excellent!  The only change I made was to reduce the butter to 1/2 cup.  The shrimp had such a great flavor!  My husband raved over it.  It was so easy and the shrimp had a nice texture.  I will definitely make this again.

Simple and flavorful.  I did cut the butter in half, used a little over 1 Tablespoon of Dijon and added white wine. (I used Chardonnay-approx 1/4cup-a good gulp!) I also used fresh grated Parmesan cheese which really added flavor.

This was delicious!  I cut the butter in half, like other people suggested.  Be sure and watch the cook time, to make sure they don't get overcooked.  Flavor of the sauce was so yummy!  I also used dijon mustard and didn't find it overpowering at all.  It made the dish!

I made this for my mom who LOVES shrimp scampi and orders it every time she goes out somewhere. Everyone loved it. I used everything that the recipe called for and followed directions to a T and it came out PERFECT. I served it over fettuccini and my mom said that she would have it once a week from now on. Good recipe. Thank you.

Love,Love,Love this recipe!  My boyfriend and I love to try new things, and this top's the cake! We have made it at least 4 times so far.  We both think the dijon is the key, adds a great flavor.

I cut the butter in half due to the reviews.  I strongly recommend making this recipe as stated.  The butter I left out would have made this dish perfect.  Next time I will add more garlic, add some wine and Old Bay like other reviewers.  Thank you for this post, very easy and delicious.

This is super super good! As other reviewers have mentioned, you should cut the butter in half. If you are looking for an even lower fat option sub 1/2 of the already halved butter for chicken stock. I also suggest adding a bit of parm and white wine. Enjoy!

What a simple delicious meal. The hubby loves shrimp so I decided to make one of his favorites. The Dijon mustard threw me off but I followed the recipe exactly.  It was so easy. The dish has a very rich taste so a little goes a long way.

I'm  not a big fan of Dijon mustard and probably never would have chosen this recipe, but there were limited ingredients in the house.  What a pleasant surprise!  This was absolutely delicious.  I asked my husband if he could tell what the 'secret' ingredient was.  He couldn't, but he loved the dish.  Thank you!

My family loved this. It's so much easier than making scampi on the stove. I used 1 lb of shrimp and one stick of butter. I agree with others that cooking time should be reduced to about 8 minutes.

This was so easy and delicious!  I left out the mustard as I have a picky toddler, but added 1 large sliced fresh zuchini to the dish and baked it all together and served it over angel hair whole grain pasta.  We loved it as did our toddler!

Made this recipe for my husband and me.  Tweaked the amounts a bit because I used only a pound of large shrimp.  I did top them with garlic parmesan panko crumbs (made by a local market), which added a nice crunch and flavor.  Loved it!

Flavor was ok but the sauce was very watery-too much like a broth.  I imagine this is from putting in raw shrimp without any kind of prep.  Definitely can't compare to regular scampi.  I wanted a comparable recipe I could make in the oven and then put on an hors d' oeuvres buffet but this did not give the best results. I made it exactly according to the recipe but maybe large shrimp would have worked better? Would definitely not use less butter because then it would really be watery.

Turned out great!  We only had frozen shrimp, and it turned out a little too watery, next time I will use only large shrimp and go down to 3/4 c butter.  I also only used 1T mustard as per other reviews.  Perfection.  Will make again!

Great recipe! I followed the advice of others and cut down the mustard and butter a bit. I did want some extra butter for dipping so I went with 3/4 cup and had plenty to sop up with a nice crusty french bread.
Frozen shrimp was on sale so I let them thaw under cool running water seven or eight minutes. I also chose to pull the tails off before placing them in a baking dish so they could be eaten without any fuss. Served over spaghetti with spinach pesto.
One last thing! The prep work only took about fifteen minutes instead of thirty - very happy with that.

Delicious!  Like other reviewers, I halved the butter.  I also added 1/2 cup white wine, 1/2 tsp. Old Bay and 1/ tsp. red pepper flakes, and was more generous with the garlic (because we love it).  I was so surprised to love this as I don't like mustard - but I didn't even taste the mustard (and I still used two tablespoons of dijon as called for).  I didn't measure my lemon juice - I squeezed one whole lemon.  Since I was doing the roasted asparagus (from this site) and some frozen garlic bread which both called for 425 degrees, I opted to do the shrimp at 425 as well.  Using large shrimip, 12 minutes was perfect  for both the shrimp and asparagus.   As an aside - I impetuously put a bunch of fresh spinach on the bottom of the pan before placing the shrimp and pouring the sauce over (to use up 1/2 bag I had on hand).  After baking - tossed all with some cooked pasta and even my non-spinach lovers in the family gobbled it up.  Try it!  If you prepare your shrimp the night before (and I take the tails off too) - there's no reason you can't get home from work and have a delicious dinner on the table in 30 minutes.  Love it!

The recipe by itself is WAY too buttery. 

I cut the butter and also:
- added heavy cream (can also use half and half)
- lemon juice
- parsley flakes 
- wine
- honey mustard

After these adjustments the recipe is 5 stars.

This was amazingly simple to make and it was delicious!  I'll be making this again in the near future!  I made pasta with this and after taking the shrimp out of the butter mixture, I tossed the pasta in the butter!  It took the dish to a whole new level!

Let me start off by saying I've never had shrimp scampi before, so maybe I'm just not a fan overall...I found this just too buttery (and I served it over linguine). Buttery sauce had a nice light garlic flavor, but was overwhelmingly BUTTER-flavored.

This was great. I was cheap and tried to use a full box of pasta but cut the shrimp to just one pound, and you could tell. I'd definitely use either half a box or use the full amount of shrimp. I also cut the butter by a quarter and it was perfect.

This is like the best shrimp in the history of EVER!  But truly, what can go wrong?  Butter, garlic, shrimp and pasta.....it's all good...it's all in there.  I have never felt so guilty devouring something in my life.  I served it over pasta so I used the entire cup of butter.  I doubled the garlic, halved the mustard, and sprinkled the shrimp with Old Bay and red pepper flakes.  To die for...  Watch your cooking time.  Enjoy and thank you for the recipe.

I don't exactly know what I expected. It taste pretty much exactly as you would imagine it would: butter. garlic. parsley. shrimp. I added some red pepper flakes for a little kick. My favorite thing about this recipe was that it reminded me how much I love parsley and that I should be using it way more often when I cook.

Was not a favorite. The sauce just had a really odd taste and I agree with other reviewers that there was too much butter. I followed the recipe exact but I think if I ever make this again I will use less butter.

I followed the recipe but added mushrooms and diced roma tomatoes.I also added one chicken bouillon cube in the sauce while it was in the oven.   My family and I loved it! This has become a new favorite dish that will be served over and over again.  Thank you for this easy but great recipe. It's great for a work and school night!

This dish was delicious. I seasoned the shrimp with Old Bay and then poured the mixture over the shrimp. I didn't use the parsley because I didn't have any. I didn't miss it. I then marinated the mixture in the refrigerator for a few hours before baking. I baked for about 10 minutes using the precooked shrimp and then sprinkled a parmesan cheese/bread crumb mixture on top and broiled for about 4-5 minutes. I served over white rice. This was very simple and delicious. Thanks for the recipe. This is a keeper!

I gave this five stars because it's EASY and YUMMY.  I make it exactly as the recipe states except I halve it.  I serve it over spaghetti with grated Parmesan and salad .  Dinner is done in under a half hour.  My husband and our three picky little eaters love it.  Great go to when Im pressed for time .  I always keep a bag of raw shrimp on hand in the freezer for this or one of my other recipes.  It defrosts in a snap.  I did not find the Dijon over-powering as some others did (nor did my little ones).  Rather, I found it zippy.  I like the extra butter sauce to outvoted the pasta.  Perfect as written.  Thanks for this recipe !

Delicious! I only had 1lb of shrimp but used all the same measurements for the rest of the recipe. I added frozen broccoli on the baking sheet with the shrimp. Also cooked for 20 and served with pasta and sprinkled Parmesan cheese! Super easy, will def make again!

This was great. I really enjoyed this. It was filling and I did not even use pasta. It was low in carbs high in fat but so delicious. I would definitely cut back on the butter next time. I actually added a little Parmesan to make it creamy.I really recommend it.

I have to admit. I was skeptical about how this was going to taste with the Dijon added. I wasn't sure how that flavor was going to fit in with a scampi recipe. I was looking for a recipe on New Year's Eve. It was a last minute decision and I'm glad I didn't second guess myself. I put it over rice and sprinkled some seasoned Italian breadcrumbs over the top before baking. Scrumptious! Everyone went crazy over it! It was gone in the blink of an eye.

I made this recipe for our New Years Eve dinner and it was wonderful.  It was so much easier than I thought, yet it tasted as good as going out to eat (which would have cost A LOT more)!!  I served it over thin pasta, but want to try it over Penne next time. I over-did it on the dijon but it actually gave it an extra kick that my husband loved.  This is my new holiday meal. Thank you for the recipe.  We loved it!!

It was ok. Not something I would crave but if you love sea food it would be something to try. If you don't like it put some Parmesan cheese on it, it makes it a lot better.

I have 3 daughters who can never agree on a likable dinner, they lived this dish!!  Next time I will use half the butter and add capers and spinach.   This is a keeper for my family.

I followed the recipe exactly. You will have extra sauce this way, but I mixed it with angel hair the first time and fettuccine this most recent time. It's delicious!  Husband and 2 yr old both loved it too! Goes great with a little homemade cheesy garlic bread too!

I loved it! I used 1 1/2 lbs. of shrimp, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I used 1 lb. of linguine. I felt it was a little too much butter. The next time I would cut back proportionately because the sauce was delicious.The dijon blended perfectly.

I can't give it five stars just following the recipe but by lowering the amount of Dijon mustard to 1 tbsp and adding Parmesan cheese it made it five stars. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this last night for my family and it was soooo delicious!!! The only thing different that I did was bake it at 350 degrees and added some adobo to the shrimp. Excellent recipe!!

OUTSTANDING! This recipe is truly phenomenal; it is one of the 1st recipes I ever made on AR & I've been using it ever since. The only changes I made were due to personal preference: reduce amount of butter (usually use 1.5lbs of shrimp), boil raw shrimp in old bay & water (toss em in at the end) & added some Italian seasoning. I really feel the KEY to this recipe is the mustard you use. I use a gourmet mustard sold at the local spice shop & it really makes all the difference in the dish. WONDERFUL!

The flavors just did not marry together well. I was expecting something with the wow factor. Without a doubt the recipes call for way to much butter. However, thank you for Sharing the recipe.

While it was an OK meal,I felt that this recipe was lacking in flavor. All the butter overpowered the rest of the dish, and it didn't taste like the shrimp scampi I am accustomed to eating.

Tasty.  Used 1/4 of the butter and it was still greasy.  Will add white wine next time, and add more fresh parsley on top.  BTW I just threw leftover noodles in my covered fry pan, heated for 4 minutes and stirred.  Great as a follow-up to the spaghetti 2 nights earlier!

I only used this recipe for inspiration for new flavors to make Tilapia so I'm rating soley based on the flavors.  I used every ingredient listed but added Old Bay Seasoning (hence, the 4 stars instead of 5) and it was fantastic!  I made 5 lbs. of Tilapia fillets so I used 2 1/2 sticks of ICBINB; 1 tablespoon of garlic powder; 1 tablespoon of dried parsley; 4 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice; 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard and 1 slightly mounted tablespoon of Old Bay.  Over low heat, I let all meld together for a few minutes and then I spooned the mixture over each piece of fish to make sure that they were all coated and then poured on the little that was left.  With two pans on two different racks in the oven, I baked covered with foil on 400 degrees for 25 minutes, then uncovered for another 15 minutes and it was delicious and not at all overbaked (pour off the excess butter substitute mixture to save calories) and all the flavors were definitely baked into the fish.  This was quick and easy and I'm sure that if some point, I'll get to the shrimp.

Tried it and liked it.  Very good.  Sauce was thick b/c of mustard.  Buddy said would like again.  Served with Rotini noodles, which were good b/c picked up some sauce.

This is perfect.  I didn't bake it.  I just threw the shrimp in the pan with the sauce and it cooked in 4 minutes.  

I've also made the baked version and that tends to be a little more flavorful because of the longer baking time.

I thought this was very good; however,  I did listen to some of the reviewers and reduced the amount of butter to 1/2 cup,  added 1/8 c white wine, 1 T Dijon.  I did use more garlic (I luv garlic and never can have enough)   I used large shrimp and baked the shrimp for 10 min .  I have tried adding the Panko/grated cheese mix to the top as suggested by a reviewer and I did like that but either way is good. This is a good, quick, easy dish.  This is my second time making it and is a keeper for me. I served it with a salad and garlic bread.

Mmm, used smaller amounts but proportional of sauce.  Then cooked medium frozen shrimp with tails on, fresh broccoli cut into florets and sliced mini bella mushrooms for 10 min at 425.  Perfect simple supper for 1 with no pasta.  Will definitely be making this again.

So awesome! I only had a pound of frozen cooked shrimp. Cut down on butter, added white wine, more garlic and after baking, I topped with fresh parmigiana and bread crumbs and broiled for a few minutes. I don't think I've ever eaten so much in one sitting.

I have been making this recipe for awhile and am just getting around to reviewing it. First let me say, the recipe is delicious as written! The only thing that I have changed the last few times I have made it, is that I sprinkle the shrimp with Italian bread crumbs (maybe 1/4 cup) and some grated parmesan cheese before I pour the melted butter mixure on top. I always used cooked shrimp and still bake for about 12 minutes. I serve over white rice. Making this again tonight, can't wait! I have also made for company and always get compliments and recipe requests.

Very good recipe loved the Dijon mustard. I added a little more garlic and topped it with some Italian bread crumbs. I only used a 1 lb of frozen shrimp and I cooked pasta with it. Felt like it needed more sauce for the pasta will double that next time.

I cannot say enough about how delicious this scampi is! I only had just over a pound of shrimp but except for the butter (3/4 cup and the rest olive oil), I used the full amount of the ingredients because I wanted plenty of sauce to serve over pasta. I used a coarse dijon and it wasn't overpowering at all....just perfect, and the mustard seeds looked pretty. The only change I made was to stir in a couple of splashes of vermouth before pouring the sauce over the shrimp. This was so quick and easy to put together, just wonderful! Next time I won't forget the parsley!

Loved it! Only used 1 tablespoon of the mustard, tho... because that is all I had. Sprinkled the shrimp with panko bread crumbs and parmesan. Tossed my pasta with the butter mixture left in the pan after baking. Will definitely make again! Easy to make... especially after a day at work.

This was an amazing recipe! I get leery of recipes with prepared mustard in it, because sometimes it ends up tasting too mustard-y. This was so easy to make. I only used a pound of shrimp and added mussel meat (I swirled around the mussel meat in the juice leftover fro the shrimp. I also added about half a cup of white wine in the mixture. Threw a little fresh spinach and olive oil together with some whole wheat linguine and it was superb.

My fiance loved this recipe. I didn't cut the butter or the dijon like other reviewers said they did. I did marinate the shrimp in the sauce in the fridge for about half an hour (while I got ready for work and boiled linguine) and I think that helped soak up some flavor into the shrimp. I also cut back the time for cooking to 6 minutes and then broiled an additional 2 minutes on low.  I added parmesan cheese before I baked it and thought it added a nice flavor (who doesn't love cheese?)

Simple prep, quick and easy from start to finish, and everyone left the table happy.  Next time I think I'll tweak it with a little extra garlic and lemon so the flavors really pop, but otherwise very satisfied.

Fabulous! I used brown mustard since that's what I had.  My 10 year old daughter said I HAD to make it again.  Served over peas and spaghetti noodles.

My duaghter and I loved this dish. I halved the recipe and used 1 lb of jumbo shrimp that I had, and i baked it for 12 minutes. Used just a little mustard and a shot of white wine. Served it with salad and whole grain spaghetti. The only thing left was the tails!

I agree with the commentor who advised:
2 12oz bags of frozen  thawed and works fine. Use a little less than  tbsp. of the dijon and only use 1/2 cup butter, 2 cloves of garlic, a handful of chopped parsley and a splash of dry white wine

Everyone enjoyed this!  And so fast and easy.  Used only 1 1/2 sticks of butter with lots of garlic, parsley and fresh lemon juice.  Added the mustard but couldn't taste it.  There was plenty of "sauce" after cooking to spoon over linguini as well as sever with shrimp. Yummy!

This was amazing! I only had 1 lb of shrimp, but I used 3/4 cup butter because I knew I would be serving it with pasta and I wanted to have the extra sauce for it. So easy, and I used jar parsley...tasted great! Will be making this again and again.

This was nice, quick and easy. I added some chicken broth and a splash of white wine to make a bit more sauce. It can actually handle more garlic too.

I made this according to the recipe & it is by far the best scampi I've ever made (& I've heard mine is pretty good).  I think the dijon does something to it & just makes it incredible.  Had it a few weeks ago & am making it again tonight.  Thanks Kimber.

Very good. I used 3/4 c. butter as per other reviews and it was more than enough, but not too much. I used spicy brown mustard because I didnt know there was a difference and its what I buy. If I use spicy brown next time I would cut it down to 1 3/4 TBSP. I stirred in 1/3 c. Kraft parmeasan cheese after it came out of the oven served it over carrot/tomato/spinach blend linguini, because the store was out of regular spinach linguini. I HATE to cook and avoid recipes that are overly complicated or have too many ingredients. This was perfect for me, new, tasty, quick and easy peasy.

I reduced the butter by about half, added white wine (I would add more next time), sauted some bell peppers and added those when roasting, and increased the garlic. Next time I'll add more lemon, more salt and more wine. And also not reduce the butter so much, if I need sauce for pasta. Yummy!

Tasty and very quick dish to prepare during the week.  Cooked the shrimp for about 9 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Served with angel hair pasta (so the amount of butter worked just fine) and everything was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe last night for dinner and loved it.  I like some of the others used frozen shrimp thawed, jarred parsley.   And it still was wonderful.  I did change one thing.  I cooked mine for 10 minutes, then I topped it with breadcrumbs mixed with shredded parmasen cheese and put the broiler on to brown it and it was absolutely wonderful.

Made this for my fiancee who really enjoys shrimp.  I don't like any type of seafood, so this was a very easy recipe for someone without much seafood cooking experience to follow.  I followed previous suggestions and used frozen, deveined, shelled and tail off shrimp.  My fiancee said he loved it!!  Will certainly be making again, he ate every last bit!  Thank you for the ease of this recipe.

Seriously, stick to 8 MINUTES COOK TIME!!!! The shrimp was tender & just right.  I stuck with the full cup of butter (offered some sauce for the fettuccine) & Dijon (which wasn't strong at all, just right). Of course had to add some white wine, old bay, along with some broccoli & spinach.  Took the suggestion to add parmesan to allow the sauce to stick.  The flavor was mostly in the shrimp and spinach; So my sister thought it needed a little more flavor in the sauce (might just need a little more old bay). I thought it was delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change a thing.  It is a simple and yet amazing recipe as is.  I made this for family and friends that were coming for dinner.  Everyone loved it and I've already gotten request to make this again (sooner rather than later).

Delicious and easy.  I halved the butter based on reviews and had more than enough even over linguine.  The addition of truffle dijon made it so good.

This Was Super Easy And A Lot Of Fun To Make. I Love Using Fresh Ingredients When Cooking For My Family. Not To Mention That I Loved My Kitchen Smelling Like Red Lobster! Even My 4 1/2 Year Old Enjoyed The Scampi, And I Was Afraid He Would Want Nothing To Do With It. I Followed The Directions Accordingly, Except The Dijon Mustard, I Didn't Have Any.

This was so fast, easy and yummy... the perfect combination for a meal. It made me feel like I was eating a fancy restaurant meal, but it took me less than 30 min to prepare and cook. I prepared the recipe as-is and served it over whole wheat spaghetti. I could imagine it would seem like a lot of butter if not using for sauce over pasta!

I went with the other reviewers and removed 1/2 the butter; the flavor was fantastic. Be careful about the cooking time; everyone's oven is different, but using 21-25/lb. sized shrimp, mine were done in 6 minutes. (I did put some on an insulated style baking pan and those took 8 min. to cook.)

Really good but way way way too much butter. I think you could go half the amount and still taste good.

DELICIOUS! My husband who is a shrimp snob (lol) loved this and asked when I was making it again. It was a bit on the liquid side, but he liked it and it wasn't an issue when he heated up the leftovers.

Yum!  This is quick, easy and delicious.  I've made it twice and it gets 5 stars both times.  The first time I made it according to the recipe - perfect.  The second time, I made the following modifications:
1) put a layer of thin sliced zucchini on the bottom of the baking dish and added the shrimp and sauce on top before pouring on the sauce
2) added some cayenne pepper to the butter sauce
3) substituted fresh chopped cilantro for the parsley
4) used unsalted butter for the sauce, so added a teaspoon of coarse ground sea salt

Even my picky "I hate all fish" 11 year old will gobble this up over a dish of spaghetti.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It has become a regular Friday night dish at our house.

This was good. Wouldn't call it extraordinary, but definitely worth making. I think the cooking time might be a bit off. I'll try it again, and take it out sooner.

I have made this recipe several times, using both defrosted frozen raw shrimp, and defrosted frozen cooked tiny shrimp. It has been delicious every time. I agree that you can cut the butter in half if you like and it's still plenty. Easy too!

Wow - fantastic. I used frozen cooked shrimp, prepped it an hour in advance & kept it in the fridge.  I popped it in the oven & it took less than 10 min. Served it over angel hair pasta. As suggested I used half the butter & it was still rich tasting. I followed the recipe exactly for the rest of the ingredients.  I served it with oven-roasted asparagus from this site by swedishmilk. I simply placed the asparagus pan on a rack above the shrimp & cooked both together. All great meals should be this easy. Thanks for this recipe.

First time making this and it was a success! I cut down on the butter and added olive oil to replace. Added extra garlic and red pepper flake for some spice.

Excellent dish!!! Made this last night as directed and my boyfriend and I thought it was wonderful. Some reviewers thought there was to much butter, but when we mixed it with the pasta, it was just fine. Will definitely be making this again.

This was awesome.  I added a bit extra of the ingredients but wished I had doubled it. I made it with Angel Hair pasta and it soaked up the sauce and was amazing.  My husband is a picky eater and very rarely will bring leftovers for lunch.  He took the leftovers the next day so that says it all.  Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME! I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter because I was short of the 2 sticks as the recipe called for.  I served this over 1 lb of capellini pasta, so the full 2 sticks would have worked here.  I agree this would be too much butter if you are eating solo or over rice.  Per others suggestions I added a bit of old bay and plain dry breadcrumb over the shrimp before adding the butter mixture.  Don't overbake, I had extra large shrimp (21-25 lb) and they only needed 12 minutes.  I only used 1 T. of dijon, but I think I will up to 1.5 T. next time.  And oh yeah, there will definitly be a next time, this was quick and oh so flavorful.

I used this as an inspiration for a quick stovetop version. The mustard was a great addition. I had leftover shrimp cocktail, dried parsley and I added diced onion. Served over spaghetti. Awesome 10 min meal!

Wonderful recipe! Delicious and easy! I cut the recipe down for 3 servings and used a mix of half butter and half smart balance "butter." To make the dish low carb I served the shrimp atop of asparagus. My boyfriend thought it was excellent and couldn't wait to take it for lunch the next day : ) I had no idea that scampi called for dijon mustard! I will definitely be making this again.

Liked it, but not crazy about it. We could taste the Dijon - came across as an odd flavor. I will be reducing by half. We also will be cooking the garlic a bit more in the butter before it goes on to the shrimp, adding some wine (we def noticed the lack of it for the traditional scampi flavor we're seeking), and then BROILING the shrimp. We may even toss in some chicken bouillon for a richer flavor in the sauce. This was just, lacking, somehow?

Delicious -- needs the addition of powdered garlic as well as a touch of garlic salt.  Wonder flavor and the butter is plenty for the pasta.  Super easy and quick!

My husband just loved this recipe. He said it was the best scampi I ever made.  The mustard makes all the difference.   I added a little white wine and Parmesan with bread crumbs to the top before I put it in the oven for a nice topping.  Loved it!

Very good, some changes based on previous feedback. Would use less mustard, 1 tab; added a splash of white wine; baked only 10 mins.  Served over a bed of pasta, which sucked up the wonderful juice.  Kids ate it all up!!

I am literally eating as I write this...what a fabulous version and so simple. From start to table, 20 minutes. Put your pasta water on to boil before you do anything else so it is ready when you are. Put pasta in the water when you put the shrimp in the oven and perfection. I used bottled lemon juice since I forgot to get the lemon but still incredibly delicious.

Very quick and easy recipe! 
My shrimp had been already cooked and shelled.
I did make the pasta. Boiled it in water, Red Cooking Wine then added pepper just for added flavor. Not sure if I can taste it or not. My pallet isn't that experienced. Angel Hair. 
I used:
1 T DiJon Mustard (thats all I had)
1 T Stone Ground Mustard 
1/2  T Garlic Salt, did not have fresh.
1 T dried parsley
1 T lemon juice in bottle, worked just as fine.
Drained the pasta, poured half the sauce over that, added my already cooked shrimp, poured the rest of the sauce over that!
Waa Laaa...
I have to say, this is exactly what I was craving!
Enjoy!

This was absolutely delishious! Myhusband and I always cook shrimp on the stove or grill, so we were hesitant. Turned out even better than we imagined. I added crab meat, red onion, tony c's, and red pepper. Im afraid without the extra seasoning it would of been bland. Easy fix! Served with a salad and rice.

It was good but not exceptional.  Too much mustard and not enough lemon for me.  Next time I make it I'll use less mustard, more lemon and garlic, and a splash of white wine.

really good recipe, minus the cooking time.  as another reviewer, 8 minutes in the oven was enough...perfect.  the one thing i left out was the dijon mustard.  i'd made the sauce and tasted it before i put in on the shrimp...good decision, as i didn't like it.  re-did the sauce and baked.  tossed with angel hair pasta and a mix of fresh parmesan and romano...GREAT!  will keep in rotation.

This recipe was very fun to make being my first seafood dish. Only things I altered was I used only a teaspoon of mustard and the amount of shrimp since I was only serving it to one person. I used about 15 out of the 30 in the the 1lb bag. 

I was worried about using the same amount of ingredients for the six servings original recipe after reducing the shrimp but I was very surprised.

The butter mixture was just enough and absorbed into the shrimp quite nicely. I used cooked shrimp and it only really took about nine minutes in the oven.

Overall, wonderful recipe~ Better than going to the restaurant for Scampi.

I only rate recipes I know I will make again and this one is a definate keeper.  Just the fact that all you have to do is throw everything into the dish and let the oven do the cooking is worth giving it a try.  Loved it.

I didn't think there was enough lemon in this recipe, I ended up using all the juice from 2 large lemons ..I used the full amount of butter and was pleased with the amount of sauce left over to spoon over pasta, next time I'll add some Parmesan cheese so the sauce is a bit thicker.

This was not the best shrimp scampi I've ever had. It was really easy and quick to make but I really didn't like the mustard taste. Next time I'll only use one tablespoon of dijon mustard or none at all. I thought a whole cup of butter was a little excessive since I didn't have a whole lot of shrimp, so I only used a half cup. I also added a half tablespoon of white wine and sprinkled parm cheese after it was fully cooked. My boyfriend enjoyed it and cleaned his plate but it wasn't my favorite.

enjoyed the scampi, it was quick and easy to make and the flavor was out of this world,maybe I will use less butter next time but the sauce was great, shrimp was tender I served it over pasta which gave the dish a nice texture, I will try this one again.

This was wonderfull!  We will definately be having this often. We made it the other night with a head of steamed cabbage for lack of a better side dish and it went well together. The extra butter from the shrimp was awesome on the cabbage!

I've always made scampi in a saute pan and was a little leery about making it in the oven. DH was VERY skeptical but he LOVED it.  He actually prefers this method over all the others I've made.  I like my shrimp kind of "crusty" but I will use this recipe from now on; maybe "grill" the shrimp in a bit of olive oil on the stove first.  (I did add 1/2 cup of white cooking wine and only used 1/2 the mustard.)

This is on my regular rotation for dinners.  I do only use half (ok sometimes less) of the butter this recipe calls for, and add some olive oil.  It is very good as written.  I do add a couple of shakes of cayenne pepper to the top before I put it in to bake.

This meals was Delicious!!!!  I did add 3/4 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  I served it with a pound of pasta.  Next time I need to double the sauce it was a little dry.  Will make it again.

This is an amazing weeknight meal that you can put together in no time at all and clean up is pretty easy (2 essentials in this house)! I followed the recipe, but made it a little quicker by using the pre-chopped garlic from the produce section of the supermarket and suubstitued frozen (thawed) shrimp with the tails off. Not as pretty a presentation, but easier to eat. I serve the shrimp over angel hair pasta with all that yummy broth and had roasted asparagus as the side.  Love it!

This was so simply but very tasty. I have to say it was a bit bland when i served it over pasts but s couple of shakes of parmesan cheese fixed that. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

First time reviewing...  thought this was  absolutely great!  Loved the idea of baking, and the (I used dried) mustard.  For us, I used LOTS more garlic.... added some green onions and a dash of red pepper, let the sauce simmer for 10 minutes to blend all the tastes. Served over rice (cooked in fish bullion, instead of water).   Only negative was that it was VERY rich.  But oh so good!

As other reviewers have said, cut the butter in half.  I personally didn't like the mustard in it, and it needed more garlic.  I used 16-20ct shrimp and had no issues with 12 minutes of baking; they came out perfect.

Delicious! (and simple) The only thing I added was a splash of white wine.  Also, I used large shrimp and they were perfect in 10 minutes. Served with spinach fettucini and steamed veggies. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, restaurant quality.  I used 1/2 cup oleo and 1/2 cup olive oil instead of butter.  I added more garlic and parsly flakes than the recipe calls for.  I placed in baking dish in a single layer so all of the shrimp was covered with the garlic and oil.  Before baking, I sprinkled the top generously with parmesean cheese.  I baked until shrimp was done and chesse was slightly browned.  DELISH!! Will make again

I cut butter in half, used dried parsley, bottled lemon juice white wine and bread crumbs. Something seemed off though, I think it was the white wine? Next time I'll marinate first and omit wine. Served on penne, we enjoyed it.

One word for this recipe FANTASTIC.  I added slightly more than 3/4 cup white wine (I like wine).  This tastes better than any restaurant scampi dish.  My husband raved about this and the linguine is awesome without the shrimp.  The leftovers are to die for.  This definately gets 5 stars. Thank you.

This recipe was good! My family loved it but hubby thought it was lacking with the garlic and butter (I used 1/2c. butter as others suggested). I will definitely be making this again trying 3/4c. butter and maybe tripling the garlic to suit the boys! I also omitted the mustard as we don't really like it. I used large precooked shrimp and baked them for 8 mins and they turned out great.

This was absolutely delicious. First time I made it, I used frozen, previously cooked shrimp and took the tails off..  2 tbsp Gouldens Spicy Brown mustard.. tasted a little too mustardy.. 2nd time, I used 1 tbsp honey mustard and 1 tbsp spicy brown mustard. I also took the advice of others and used a little bit of white wine in the sauce. I crushed up some Ritz crackers and sprinkled on top and baked for about 8 minutes. So quick and easy and wonderful over linguine.

Very flavorful. A great way to prepare shrimp scampi for company since it simply gets assembled and popped into the oven. I will make it this way again.

AMAZING!! My daughter and I love shrimp scampi and this recipe is fantastic! I didn't have any dijon mustard so I used honey mustard and it still turned out awesome.  I had to devien my shrimp which is very time consuming, if you can by pre-cleaned this meal only takes minutes to prepare! I made this along with cheddar garlic biscuits and it was to die for!

Let me just say, OMG!!!  really great way to kick up your shrimp scampi.  The dijon mustard really makes the difference in this recipe.  I have already made this several times and is lip smakin', bread dippin' good!  LOL!

Great recipe. The Dijon really gives it a little something extra and a delicious flavor. I love garlic so I usually put extra in, and I also put some white wine into the sauce and sprinkle a little bit of breadcrumbs on the shrimp so the sauce will "stick" a bit more to the shrimp. I also love that this recipe is totally foolproof and quick to prepare.

Tasty but not fabulous--though I'm sure this was my fault.  I attempted to cut back on fat/calories by using part butter/part smart balance a/part olive oil.  Though my family liked it a lot it needed a little something else.  Will definitely try again but will add more lemon/zest and spices.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I highly recommend using real butter instead of margarine and a glug of white wine instead of lemon juice. Also, shorten the bake time to 8-10 minutes since 12-15 is too long. I toss this together with some bow tie pasta and serve with ciabatta rolls and a salad...delicious!

Really wonderful!! 1st time made it as written.  2nd time.. Added white wine and added bread crumbs on top of shrimp before cooking.  Almost doubled the sauce so that there was enough to cover the pasta that I served it on top of. Wonderful either way. yumm

Per my husband, "This is the best scampi I have ever had". Only change made was to add a little cayenne. Everyone asked for seconds.

Seeing as anything with shrimp and other shell fish sea food I love, I just had to try this recipe out. I made as stated, and just poured the extra sauce into the shrimp and pasta once it was on the plate. I had a horrible time keeping my husband out of the kitchen do to the wonderful smell of the shrimp baking. It was easy, simple, wonderful, and way to good to share, this is so becoming a family secret!! :)

Followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT that I halved it for our family of three. Came out perfect after 12 minutes in the oven. We ate it all -- we being me and my husband. The two year old ate the pasta/w scampi sauce, not the shrimp. No surprise there.

I rate recipes 5 stars if made as written with no changes...my boyfriend loved this only after I made adjustments to it; 1. remove the tails from the shrimp especillay if your going to server over pasta, its just much easier to eat. 2. I added just a lil less than 1/2 tsp of the dijon mustard. 3. The lemon juice was a bit overwhelming so I added about 1/2 tblsp vs. 1 tblsp. 4. I added 1/4 cup of white wine. 5. tossed the shrimp in garlic powder and old bay. 6. Added 1 1/2 tblsp more fresh garlic than recipe called for. 7. Only cooked for 10 mins. (I used medium shrimp). 8. Tossed with parmesean cheese after cooking. My boyfriend says this was the missing link. I loved the dish as well and will definitely make it again!

I tried to save a little bit of time by using the chopped garlic variety that you purchase in a jar.  That was a mistake.  Because the sauce mixture only simmers until the butter melts, there was not enough time for the flavors to meld together.  Using fresh garlic (and more of it) would have considerably added to the flavor.  I agree with another reviewer who suggested baking the shrimp mixture for ten minutes.  That was more than enough time.  My husband, a Shrimp Scampi fiend, declared this a 3 1/2 stars.  He thought that even with more garlic, it would have been just, "O.K." and suggested that we try another recipe next time before going back to this one.

Soooooo good and very easy to prepare.  The only complaint was that the mustard was a little much and I would only use half the amount next time.  Served it over angel hair pasta and with cheddar bay biscuits and it was just as good as going out to eat.

Delicious! My husband says it's the best he's ever had! I left the amount of butter, as is, because I used it as a sauce over the wheat angel-hair pasta I served with it. I also tossed the shrimp in Old Bay, parmesan and garlic powder. I cooked my medium shrimp for 7 minutes.

This was really good and very easy to make.  I think that next time I would add some white wine to the dish, and maybe use less butter or a combination of butter and olive oil.  We had it over fresh linguine.

This is absolutely wonderful and ridiculously easy! I've always thought of shrimp scampi as one of those "special occassion" dishes, but this definately makes it perfect for any night of the week! I used frozen shrimp that I thawed under cold running water for about five minutes, and it was just great!! Served with rice. Definately a very "heavy" dish, so I wouldn't serve much else except rice and a veggie side. Certainly a keeper!!

SOOOO good. My husband said it was the best he ever had. - I used double the garlic. lemon juice from the bottle, and dried parsley. And I used cooked shrimp, unthawed and baked for 7 min. PERFECT!

A keeper!  I used 1/2 salted and 1/2 unsalted butter and next time I will use only unsalted.  The mustard gives it such an excellent flavor but does NOT taste like mustard is in it.  I'm sure you can just put the shrimp into the mixture pan until they cook, I think i'll try that next time.  Wonderful flavor and enough sauce for linguini and rice!

My husband and I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I took the advice of those before me and watched that shrimp because at 9 minutes our shrimp was definitely done.  I also put a little Parmesan cheese on top of the shrimp for the last minute in the oven and it turned out very well!

I just made this for Valentine's Day dinner and had to review.  Absolutely delicious and so quick & easy!  I did cut the butter in half, used extra garlic (as always), dried garlic (all I had) and added a big splash of white wine.  Like other reviewers, I also sprinkled a little Old Bay on the shrimp.  I added cut fresh asparagus before putting in the oven and served over angel hair pasta.  Will definitely be making this again!  Thanks, Kimber!

This is such a wonderful recipe.  My 2 year old loves breaded shrimp, but I am just okay with them.  Since the time/temp match his shrimp, my husband and I also get to enjoy a meal of higher taste without having to change the menu.  I used minced garlic and some garlic salt in place of real garlic that I didn't have and it was delicious.

Delicious and easy to make!!!  I added a couple of tablespoons of grated parmesan cheeses and just sprinkled a tiny bit of salt on top of the shrimps prior to adding the mixture.  I prepared the shrimps and mixture couple of hours ahead of time and put them in the oven just before our friends were coming over.  Thank you for this great recipe!!!

This is a keeper.  I made for my husbands birthday and recieved request for the receipe.  Nice flavor with not to much garlic.  I was looking for a recipe where garlic did not take over and this was perfect.  I did not have the smooth dijon mustard on hand rather the "grainy" style and that was perect it added a nice look when serving and it was a nice background flavor.

Absolutely delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I had to use dry parsley because I did not have fresh and I didn't cook the shrimp nearly as long. My shrimp were done in about nine minutes.  Served with alfredo noodles.

Awesome!!!  This had so much flavor, it was wonderful!  Defintily a new recipe staple in my menu!  I did double the garlic, I love garlic.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Even my husband was a fan and he doesn't do pasta to often.  I wish there was a way to make it a lil healthier, all that butter is no good, but I read some reviews saying they substituted with olive oil so maybe I'll try that next time.  You have to try this recipe!

YUM!!! I used medium sized frozen shirmp, thawed.  Next time I will definitely cut the butter in half.  10 minutes of cook time is plenty for this size shrimp.  This was the best shrimp scampi I have ever had!

I read many reviews that said this recipe called for too much butter. So, I made the sauce as directed but only added half of it to the shrimp. The other half I mixed with 4 Tbl warmed cream cheese and a few teaspoons of bacon bits to create the perfect sauce for a pasta dish to complement the scampi!! Even my picky 7 year old downed it and asked for more! The first time I ran out of food at dinner time in a long time!! :)

This was so easy and so delicious.  Halved the recipe since I only had 1 pound of shrimp and there are only three of us.  It was just enough.  I didn't change a thing and we all loved it.  As someone else suggested I served it with the Lemon Linguine from this site.  I added a couple of handfuls of fresh arugula and spinach to the pasta during the last minute of cooking.  I also added a handful of chopped tomato.  I needed some sort of vegetable and this worked well.  Will definitely be making this again.

This is a fantastic recipe that is best served over noodles. It is so simple and perfect. A great way to make a week night special! I followed the recipe exactly.

I thought that this was good. My husband likes the traditional way to make shrimp scampi much better, but I really enjoyed the different flavor (the djion) and it seemed a bit healthier than the versions that the shrimp is sitting in a bath of butter. I used precooked shrimp, which made the shrimp a bit overcooked in the end, next time I would buy raw. (but that is what I had on hand) Overall good recipe.

So many reviews you read start out, "I changed a few things" to the point it is a different recipe.  I made this exactly the way it was written, and found it extremely good.  Now I will experiment.

Easy and yummy! If you don't like mustard, I would recommend reducing the amount because you can definitely taste it. I also dipped some veggies in the sauce and roasted them seperately for a buttery, garlicky side.

I had to alter this recipe a little because i didn't have fresh shrimp on hand. I used the frozen ones (still good) and used fresh basil instead of parsley. The Dijon seemed a little strong when i tasted out of the pan but was much better when on noodles. I will make this again. Maybe next time I will add a little flour to thicken it into a sauce.

OMG!! That was simply to die for. I can't believe how easy it was. Had a friend who doesn't like shrimp so I baked some chicken tenderloins in the sauce. Cooking time almost the same about 20 minutes. Cooked up some rice in chicken broth and vegetables and drizzled the scampi sauce over.Everyone was in 7th heavan. Thanks for posting

Excellent! Very easy to make. I added a little extra parsley, lemon juice and garlic, as well as a splash of white wine. The Dijon mustard gave it a nice flavor. Let the shrimp soak in the mixture for a short bit before popping it into the oven.  Baked in a 9x13 glass pan. Will make again.

So Good!  I did as suggested and cut the butter to 1/2 cup.  I added a bit extra garlic and only did about 1 Tbsp of dijon.  My husband raved - which is unusual, so I knew I had done good.  Served with angel hair pasta and french bread.  And so easy to make!

Perfect, restaurant quality!! I have never made something this good before. I made it exactly the way that it says. People that say it is too mustardy are using the wrong mustard I am sure! There is actually something in the store called 'prepared Dijon mustard', so get that. Do NOT use regular 'prepared mustard' that is that cheap yellow stuff, and I am sure that will ruin your dish! I served this over pasta, and was very impressed! Thanks for this great guest-pleasing recipe.

Yum. I halved the butter and it still came out tasty.  Also, I used dried parsley, more lemon juice (to taste) and I didn't bake it...just melted and mixed everything in a skillet and added precooked shrimp to the mix just to coat with sauce and warm them up a bit.  Delish!

I didn't have to time to bake the shrimp (and didn't really see the point of doing so) so I just threw my thawed raw jumbo shrimps into the butter mixture, and simmered til they were pink. This was an ok meal - needs more garlic and seasoning though. I won't make this again. Thx anyway.

All I can say is, AMAZING.  I went with half the mustard, and I'm glad because it was just enough without being overpowering.  I didn't alter the recipe in any way, and I felt like there was the perfect amount of liquid to it.  This is a new go-to recipe for us.  I used frozen, pre-cooked shrimp so I cooked for just a few minutes, but you wouldn't have been able to tell.  Not at all "fishy" like some restaurant scampi can be.  Super easy and you will not regret it!

Great Recipe! The Dijon mustard added a flavorfull kick to the scampi.  I scaled everything down to 3 serving but went heavier on the garlic, used less butter and added a tbl spn of olive oil and 3 splashes of vermouth cooking wine. I served it over Penne Pasta and cut the cooking time down to 8 minutes. The wife loved it.

I made this twice in a day... It was delicious and soooo easy to prepare. I made it for my husband and he loved it that same night some unexpected guest came in and we were so confident about it that we decide to make a second portion. We served it with mash potato and i received a lot of compliment for it.  Thanks!!!

This was so easy to make and was delicious.  A cost efficient way for a "fancy" seafood meal that fed our family of 5 easily.  I made the recipe as written.  I did use uncooked frozen jumbo shrimp and let them defrost and drain.  We served it over angel hair pasta.  I can hardly wait to make it again.

Very good recipe.  I really enjoyed the Dijon in it.  I did follow ingredients exactly except cut in half as I only prepared one pound of shrimp.  There are just two of us.  I served over linguini.

Very good scampi recipe, but I did think that it was a tad bland as some other reviewers. Maybe being from South LA, I am used to more spice/seasonings. I added 1 Table spoon dried Cajun seasoning,as well as a spash of hotsauce.

I made this for my family last night and they loved it!  Just enough garlic for the adults...not too much for the kiddos!  will definitely make again and again.  Thanks!

Great flavor.  Added a touch of white wine and used cooked shrimp instead of raw.  Served mixed in with linguine.  Was a hit with the family! Will add to my regular rotation of meals.

This was a good recipe. I did cut the dijon in half, added about a tablespoon of olive oil, and a small pinch of red pepper flakes. I also increased the garlic just a little and used a little zest of the lemon. I served this over some angel hair, topped with a little Parmesan  and garnished with a thin lemon round and some fresh flat leaf parsley.

Very good flavor!  I don't take the time to rate often.  Scampi seems so simple, yet it is easy to mess up w/ too much of salt, lemon, etc... So this was a perfect balance!

Very easy and pretty good.  Too much mustard for my liking.  Next time I will cut the mustard in half and add a little white wine.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I halved the recipe, because I had one pound of shrimp left. Well I think I left the full amount of garlic though.LOL.  Very easy, very tasty, very simple, just a very good dish. Will be making again.

This was really good, the only thing I would do different is cook the garlic in the butter longer, my shrimp had a RAW garlic taste, but it still was yummy.

I've made this twice and we love it!  The only change I made was to use about 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning.  Very good served over linguine.

Sorry, but my family and I did not like this one.  The dijon taste was overpowering.  My daughter asked if I put vinegar in the recipe (she didn't know about the mustard).  Maybe start w/ 2 tsp. and taste before adding the third.  I also cut the butter down to 3/4 of a cup per other reviewers.  This was more than enough.  I used cooked shrimp and put the mixture under the broiler until it was hot and bubbly.  Would've given it three stars, but my family requested that I not make this again, so it only gets two.

Excellent dish.   I added Old Bay to the sauce and doubled the garlic, added a couple of generous swigs of white wine, chopped sun dried tomatoes,coarsely grated parmesean cheese and topped with bread crumbs in the last few minutes under a broiler.  Outstanding!

This was suprisingly addictive.  My husband isn't even a big fan of shrimp and he mentioned having it again this week.  To cut back the fat and calories, I used 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter' and less of it.  Still tasted great!  I cut the shrimp into smaller pieces and baked in the mustard/butter mix with some leftover crab meat and chopped asparagus, served over brown rice.  So good! Will definitely make again...this week, apparently.

Yummy!  To me it was easier than making on the stove and the shrimp were firmer (which is how we like them).  I will make this way from now on.  Thanks!

Great recipe! Here's a helpful tip: If you serve with garlic bread (hope you do), brush the pieces of bread with the scampi sauce before baking and sprinkle with sea salt. Awesome!

I know I'm in the minority, but I didn't like this recipe because of the mustard. I only added 1 tablespoon of mustard because I suspected I might not like it and I still thought it was too strong. It was a weird flavor that I'm not used to in scampi dishes.

An excellent recipe!  I used frozen shrimp, and added a bit more garlic, then baked it at 450 for about 15 mintues.  Delicious!  Both my boys, 5 and 2 1/2, had two servings each.  Now, in my house that's really saying something!  Thanks for the post!

This was fabulous! I only used about 1/4 cup of butter and it didn't make enough sauce, so that is my bad. Next time I will use more butter but not the whole cup. I added basil and a pinch of cayenne, but it's the dijon and the lemon juice that just make things pop. Served over linguine that I had wilted some spinach in and wow! what a combo! Will definitley make this again!

Good. Added veggies to the shrimp mix like broccoli, zucchini, squash, and red pepper.  then served over linguine.  YUM. Makes the dish into a shrimp primavera. used the whole amount of butter and thought it was fine.

This recipe is delicious!  I followed the advice of fellow readers and used less butter, and there was plenty of sauce for the shrimp and pasta.  I used frozen raw shrimp and just shelled them before using.  I put pasta in the bottom of ramekins then put the shrimp on top with a liberal amount of butter mixture.  Then I baked for about 14 minutes.  It came out perfect!  Served with a green salad and crisp french bread...amazing!!!!

This recipe is such a hit!My husband and I love this meal.Very easy to cook and tastes great with white rice. To cut on fat, I used 1 cup of olive oil instead of butter. I also used basil instead of Parsley and garlic powder instead of chopped garlic.I let the mixture rest with raw shrimps for 20 minutes. It is simply the best.Can't get enough of this dish!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would because of excellent flavor and ease of preparation.  Hubby and I loved it!  Only changes I made were less butter (per other reviewers suggestions), used honey mustard because it was all I had available, put in a "glug" of white wine, and added a dash of cayenne pepper (gives it just a touch of heat).

This was easy to make and very tasty.  I used cooked, peeled and deveined shrimp. It would be best to start with raw shrimp.  I should have followed the advise of previews reviewers and used half the amount of butter.  WAY too much butter.  I will for sure be making this again.

Yummy - and so easy!  Like others, I took the tails off the shrimp to make it easier, and less messy, to eat.  We are trying to watch our cholesterol, so I cut way back on the fat, and used half butter/half EVOO, added some white wine to make up the volume, and I don't think we missed a thing (except a lot of calories).  The mustard was a nice touch (but then I love mustard) - my husband said it made the dish.  We had it over cooked brown and wild rice to soak up all the wonderful sauce.  We will be having this frequently at our house!

This recipe is wonderful. Because of my large family I had to triple the recipe for the sauce, but used only 3 bags of pre-cooked shrimp.  I also micro waved some broccoli florets and when the pasta was cooked I mixed everything together. It made a beautiful, colorful dish and was very delicious.

Excellent, quick recipe.  I added about 1/2 C dry white wine, a tsp of lobster base and some white pepper and tossed with angel hair.  Rave reviews!

Quick, easy, delicious.  It just doesn't get any better.  Used some of the previous tips ... a little less butter, a splash of white wine ... enjoy.

It got one extra star because it was so easy.  But I definitely smelled and tasted a hint of mustard so if I were to make it again I'd cut that in half.  I halved the butter and doubled the lemon juice.  I won't be making it again because the recipe for chicken Scampi II on this site is soo soo much better.

what a fantastic recipe. I was like a lot of others who was skeptical of the dijon mustard so I took the advice and used 1/2 the amount figuring I could always add more. Everyone raved over how wonderful it was. Thank you Kimber

This was really good. I was scared of the dijon, especially since I dont like it at all. I added just shy of what the recipe called for and I probably wouldnt add more than that. upped the amt of garlic. Served over angel hair with a salad and bread. Thanks!

This is illegally easy!  I made it as written with the exception of adding a little white wine and more garlic than the recipe calls for.  Served it over angel hair pasta and topped with some fresh grated parmesan...Delish!

Elegant, simple, and extremely tasty.  I made this for a bridal shower.  I was serving 20 people so I enlarged the recipe easily.  I prepared the recipe that morning and while decorating the dish was baking in the oven.  It was so simple, and, best of all, everyone was shocked at the results that they thought I had the food catered!  It was sooo good that I have made it for my family and even my 5year old loved it!  

Like others I left the butter amount alone to sop with bread that I served but cut the mustard in half.  It turned out perfect!

This was great! My husband was even asking for the leftovers for lunch and was disappointed that all that was left was fettecine (sorry I know I spelt it wrong) noodles and no sauce! I served this with noodles on the side and steamed carrots. I don't like steamed/cooked carrots but when you roll it in this sauce it's delicious!
Okay so I did do a few changes. I put half a cup of butter, 1 Tblsp dijon-style mustard (I don't like mustard so I didn't want it to taste strong), 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 lb of shrimp (I realized too late that I didn't have more than that! So we had a lot of sauce but as I said before it was great with the carrots and also alone on the noodles). My shrimp was precooked so I just put it in the oven for 7 minutes, turned the oven off and left it in there while I finished the rest of the preparations.
I will definatly make this again! Thank you!

Oh my gosh!! Made for dinner tonight, used 2 pound bag of frozen, devained, shelled, with tails on shrimp, and added 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1. Served it with the grilled salmon 1 from this sight, as well as the dill sauce of top of the salmon! Bought some crusty baguette bread, and dipped in the butter mixture after the shrimp was done. Felt like we ate at a five star restaurant! Best dinner I ever made!

We made this for dinner this evening and were amazed by the flavor.  I followed the recipe except for the addition of a little white wine to the butter.  We served it over pasta and could not believe how good it was!

I can't say enough!!!  This was so good.  Of course I added more garlic than recipe called for, and I didn't have dijon mustard so I used spicy mustard instead.  I took it  to my BF at work next day and he couldn't say enough about it either.

Fantastic and easy.  Had some left over peeled shrimp so I tried this with some pasta and in 10-15 minutes dinner was done.  Huge hit.  Only baked shrimp for 10 minutes, 15 would have made them rubber.

Soo0o good... I've made this a few times with mushrooms over linguini and my husband loves it.  I added a couple more cloves of garlic, mixed in fresh basil with the parsley, and topped with asiago cheese for more flavoring.  Great recipe -- thanks!!

Thank you so much for submitting this recipe

This was a great recipe! Follow the directions exactly and you can't go wrong.  I didn't have fresh parsley or lemon juice (used RealLemon) and it still worked out well. My wife has requested this for my Mother-In-Laws visit this weekend (it better be good.... LOL)

Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly, but only had spicy brown mustard and added bread crumbs and parmesan to the last few minutes of cooking - delicious!  The perfect guest dinner that you can easily whip up in a short amount of time.  I served it with linguine and it was heavenly!

This was very good as is.  I was short some shrimp so I added some fake crab meat that I had left over from another recipe and it worked just great.  I garnished the dish with more green onion. My husband commented that he did taste the mustard but he did like it. I served it with rice and green beans and it made a good Sunday supper. It's definitely a keeper and I will make it again.

This was really good.  I did not have plain dijon  mustard so I used 1 tbsp honey dijon and 1 tbsp yellow mustard.  I think that the mustard gives this some great flavor.  I served it over white rice with french bread to sop up the yummy garlic butter sauce!

I was looking for something to serve special guests while we were at our vacation home in Fla and found this.  Everyone there raved about it and wanted the recipe. I couldn't believe how easy it was to prepare yet tasted so very good.  Since returning to our home, May 1, I've made it 4 times. It's definately a keeper.  Thanks Kimber

I've only licked the spoon to taste the sauce but the taste was great.  I would have never thought to add spicy yellow mustard.  We didn't have Dijon on hand but it's delicious regardless.  Also added some crushed red pepper and fresh lime juice as well as lemon.

Very easy and delicious.  I agree with other reviewers that the mustard adds a nice flavor that isn't very noticeable.  My kids love this served on top of spaghetti.

Awesome. I had shrimp and wanted to do something quick and easy. Can't get better on either account-really delicious and so easy.
I cut the butter down to about 3/4 c, and followed the recipe as written. I think it tasted awesome with what I had on hand. I think that as good as it was when I fixed it, it would be even better if you used fresh lemon, freshly diced garlic and fresh parsley (I used bottled lemon, bottled diced garlic and dried parsley)
Again, the flavors merried wonderfully. The combination sounds odd, but comes together to make a really yummy dish. I served mine over spaghetti and served with crusty bread. Yum, I'll definitely put this in rotation.
Thanks for sharing this recipe

This was very good and very easy to make.  I took the advice of others and cut the butter in half.  I used honey Dijon mustard and minced garlic.  I’ll be making another batch today.

This was pretty darn good but it is way too much butter. I think I would follow everyone else's advice in regards to only using about half of the butter. Other than that we added about a 1/2 a tbsp more garlic and about 1 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper. We used traditional spaghetti for this dish but I think a thinner "angel-hair" type pasta would be better. Surprisingly I didn't notice the mustard at all and I hate mustard like there is no tomorrow. Prepare to feel very lazy after you eat this as it fills you up quite a bit if you use pasta.

Was short on time so I only sauteed instead of baking.  This was good but I think the dijon was a bit much for my taste.  I would probably cut it down a bit next time.  Served over spaghetti.  I will try baking it next time and possibly adding some white wine, as others suggested.  Thanks for a quick and tasty meal.

Very good , fast & easy. Had no dijon used a spicy brown and it was fine. Left the butter alone and put it all over linguine.

Awesome.  People always want this recipe!
We use honey dijon mustard, skip the fresh herbs, use approx. 1 1 /2 lemons, and add Italian seasoning.  Perfect dish for four adults.

This was very good and quick, it will become a staple at our house.  I only had spicy, brown mustard so I substituted that for the dijon.  I also added some white wine, extra garlic, and sprinkled some parm before baking.  It only took my oven about 10 minutes to cook the shrimp.

This is so wonderful! I've had so many requests for this.  I changed the amount of garlic from 1 tablespoon to 1 1/2 tablespoons because we love garlic.  Also I towel dried the shimp before I put it in the pan

I thought the mustard taste was a little too much, but I'm not a huge fan of mustard in the first place. Everyone else seemed to enjoy this though.

Simple, yet utterly fantastic.

Tossed some pasta in with this dish and it was delightful.

This will definitely stay in my recipe box for a long time.  The flavor was out of this world.

I can see this as a great, simple recipe to use when we have company over.

This turned out fantastic!!!!  We added more garlic (we LOVE it) and it was a great hit with the "in-laws"......who don't particularly care for garlic. Thanks for a great recipe!!! We did use whole wheat penne pasta (their only complaint) but we loved it!!!

We enjoyed this.  I used 1t of garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I added 1t of Old Bay and 3/4c of white wine.  I marinated the shrimp for about an hour in everything but the butter.  I added the marinated shrimp and the marinade to the butter in a casserole dish and cooked it for 5 then stirred.  I repeated that twice for a total of 15 minutes and the shrimp was cooked perfectly.  We had it on brown rice with steamed asparagus and dusted it with parm.

We thought this was pretty good.  The only change I made was to take the tails off the shrimp.  Next time I'll add some crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up just a little.

Perfect!  I used the amount of butter in the recipe and it was just right.  I served over a package of linguine noodles.  Just make sure to check on the shrimp while baking so it doesn't over cook.  Quick and easy and will make again.

This was really good!!! I followed others advice and cut/reduced the butter by a little over a half and added a tad of olive oil and thyme and I cant remember what else?!!? Nevertheless it was really good, and I liked that it wasnt so buttery..It made me feel like it wasnt so bad to eat!

So delicious! I did not use the dijon mustard instead I used a little soy sauce. I added more garlic and a little white wine; then topped the dish off w/ plain breadcrumbs and a parmesan/romano cheese blend. Served over angel hair pasta alongside steamed broccoli and garlic toast. A wonderful dinner, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was amazing! Made it last night for dinner. Its so easy to follow! I used a little white wine in the sauce and it gave it great flavor. I skipped the mustard- didn't have any and didn't want to buy some just for this recipe - but the dish was still amazing! My boyfriend is still talking about it! I plan on keeping this one handy! Already recommending it to friends!

The BEST recipe I've ever had.  Served with angel hair and steamed asparagus.

I used 1.25 lbs shrimp and the correct amount of everything else.  Perfect for 3 people.

This is the best dinner recipe I've found so far on this site!  I threw in a little white cooking wine, a little extra garlic and a bag of wilted spinach.  Served it over whole wheat linguine and it was a hit!  Next time I will use a little less butter and a little more cooking wine.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Delicious. The dijon mustard really gave it a wonderful, unique flavor. It did make a ton of sauce, and I don't know if that amount of butter is entirely necessary, but I ended up serving it over fettucine and it was excellent.

This was really quick and easy to make. I read the reviews and used some suggestions. I cut the butter in half, added some white wine and added more garlic. I then served it over angel hair pasta. The sauce was really good. I'll definitely be saving this one!! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is easy to make and is a  great addition to my recipe box. The only thing I would do differently is omit the mustard.  My family did not like the mustard taste that's why I gave it only four stars instead of five, but other than that they loved it. I followed some other review. I added 1/4 cup of parm. cheese but I also added seasoned bread crumbs (1/4cup).  This helped the butter stick to the shrimp better.  I increased the garlic and followed every thing else.  I also added salt free lemon pepper to taste and a little seasoning salt.( just a little)

This recipe was easy to prepare and I followed the measurements and igredients exactly.  I found it TOOOOOOOO buttery and fattening.  I normally prepare shrimp scampi with olive oil, and will stick to this recipe next time.

Easy, simple, almost perfect... take the suggestions of others reduce butter, add a little white wine, use raw uncooked shrimp this should make you a happy camper.

I made this dish for the shrimp lovers in my family and they all gave it 5 stars.  I had to take their word for it as I am alergic to shellfish and could not taste it.  Very simple to prepare and I will make it for them again.

This was very easy to make and delicious.  I served it over angel hair pasta so I made the full amount of the sauce.  I used chopped garlic (purchased pre-chopped in one of those small jars) and used way more garlic than the recipe called for.  I like garlic so I used about twice the suggested amount.

Excellent recipe pretty much as is, except that I reduced the cooking time and temperature.  I was using frozen cooked shrimp so I only put it in for about 12 mins on 400.  Came out perfect.  I love garlic (who doesn't) so I added some extra garlic, as well as a splash of white wine.  YUM!

Wow!! I was afraid to make this because I don't care for dijon mustard, but it got such freat reviews so I decided to make it.  It was delicious. I didn't have a fancy dijon musturd. I only had hellman's dijonnaise. It was wonderful.

This was OK. It was just a scampi recipe with mustard... not sure why I was expecting more. I usually cook shrimp in a skillet with butter, lemon, garlic & parsley. Thought there might be something to baking it and the addition of mustard. Kind of liked the mustard, but not sure where all the rave reviews are from. Perhaps I had my sights set too high.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  There were 4 of us for supper, and 1.5lbs of shrimp was plenty with leftovers.  If you are going to put this over linguine, add about a cup and a half of white wine while baking.  It made the world of difference.  I served it with cheese and garlic biscuits from this site, and my guests were dipping it in the left over sauce from the shrimp! yummmmmy.

It was really good but next time I will either use bigger shrimp or cook it less b/c it turned out a little chewy.  Other than that I think this is a fantastic recipe!

Wonderful!!!! I followed what other suggested and cut the butter down, but only by ¼ of a cup.  Other said it was good for dipping bread in and that is what I was shooting for.  I also poured in some white wine.   Towards the end I mixed in some parmesan cheese to help make the sauce stick to the shrimp.  What a wonderfully delicious meal.  The best part about it is it only takes about 10 minutes to make.  Thank you Kimber for the recipe!!

This was the best! I added a seasoning mix of red and white pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, greek seasoning, dry mustard,and a little lemon zest. I sprinkled it on the shrimp and this took care of any worries that the dish would lack flavor. I thought the dijon was wonderful and I will add a touch more next time. I served the shrimp with fettucine. Thanks so much!

Very tasty!  Used about 3/4 c. of butter and a little more mustard and lemon juice, over angel hair.  Also had pre-cooked shrimp and uncooked scallops, but still worked out fabulous!

Oh no! I can see I'm in the minority here, but I really didn't like this recipe at all.  It was very bland, even with the Dijon.
If I do make this again I will add salt and possibly red pepper flakes.

I can't personally rate this one (b/c I don't like seafood) but I made this special for my boyfriend and he loved it.  Served over angel hair pasta with cheesy garlic biscuits (like from Red Lobster). I've never made seafood before and I thought it was EXTREMELY easy to prepare.  I bought the shrimp deveined and shelled them myself.  Will definately make again.  Thanks!

We used frozen cooked shrimp (large) and I just reduced the temperature.  It was easy and extremely tasty!!  Between my husband and I we ate enough for 3.

Excellent recipe. I substituted the shrimp with salmon pieces, and it was still absolutely delicious. I also used half the butter and threw in some fresh rosemary to give it a bit more zip. The dijon mustard makes it absolutely wonderful, it gives it a great flavor you can't put your finder on!

What a terrific scampi dish!  My family and I loved it.  I used half the butter and substituted the other part with 1/3c of white wine.  I also added more garlic and some fresh green onion.  I used 1 1/2 lb shrimp and served it over linguine.  Fantastic!!!  Thanks for the great recipe :)

Simply divine!  I think next time I will half the butter and use chicken stock.  I'm sure it won't taste as good but it might be a little better for us.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

We loved this recipe!  I used a bag of frozen raw shrimp that were already deveined.  I removed all the shell and the tail.  I also reduced the butter down to 1 stick. After baking I mixed it with some cooked angel hair pasta.  My husband loved it - and he is a picky eater! My 4 year old kept wanting more shrimp! You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter and added some fresh basil as some others had suggested. I marianated the shrimp in the olive oil and seasonings for a few hours and then added the butter just before cooking. This was pretty good but I thought it needed a little more and added salt when I ate it. I actually like the Grilled Shrimp Scampi by Holli Murray a little better, the ingredients are not a lot different so maybe it's the grilling that is the difference. I may try this again and grill it. May try adding a little sea salt too.

This was delicious...restaurant quality. I no longer eat foods swimming in butter...however I did make it for my husband :).  I only had a pound of shrimp so I halved the recipe using Honey-Dijon mustard instead of regular dijon & adding grated parmesan prior to baking, then tossed with angel hair pasta when done.  My husband, who can be a little stingy with complements, loved it (as did I).  Will definitely make again!!

As someone who has managed to avoid the kitchen most of my adult life (but now a 7/2006 newlywed), this one is a MUST in your recipe collection. I was even brave (inspired) enough to substitute a Cherry-Mustard (to taste) instead of the typical Dijon. Search for any flavored mustard out there and to your taste.

I followed the recipe exactly and served over linguine. My boyfriend liked the shrimp alot but I just thought it was ok. It was coated with butter but didn't absorb any flavor. I am going to read through the reviews and see if anyone has a solution. If I can find one I will try again otherwise I will move on to the next recipe.

I've made this a few times in the past and though the flavor is good, I just would like it to stick more. Tonight I let it marinate in the cooled garlic mixture for a while before putting it in the oven and that did help some in the absorbtion of the flavors. Next time maybe I'll let it sit a while longer. In the past I've served this over linguine to mixed reviews. The mixture just doesn't quite have the sticking power necessary to make it work to my liking. But overall it is a good recipe.

Recipe turned out great, only modifications were I added a handfull of breadcrumbs and a sprinkling of parm to the top for the last few min. of cooking.  Also, I used precooked frozen shrimp-easier and cheaper.  My husband who dislikes seafood even asked me to make it a second time.

This recipe is amazing and so easy!  I used raw, frozen shrimp and scallops and thawed them first in the fridge overnight.  I also used a honey dijon mustard.  I will definitely make this again!  It is great with both shrimp and scallops!

First let me say that I rarely give a 5 star as that is for "Thank God for this!" food. That said, our family gave this a 3.75 average.  I thought it needed a bit of bread crumbs and a slightly thicker sauce but everyone else like it.  Not bad at all and pretty easy to make.  Thanks!

This was very good and easy to prepare.  I'll make it again, but only when shrimp is on sale.  I served it with angel hair pasta.  Just be careful about the baking time. You have to adjust the time depending on the size of shrimp you use.

Not a bad recipe, but next time I will tweak it for my family.  The extra garlic was a good addition, but less lemon and mustard for me.  I'll give it another go with modifications and see how it goes.  But all in all pretty good.

Absolutely yummy and easier than pie!  Quick, too.  I think I used a little more garlic than called for but then I do that to most recipes.  My husband is half Italian!

I would not change a thing about this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  Even my very picky daughter tried it and liked it.  Will make this again and again.

This is the second time we have made this.  The first time I changed things a little so I wanted to be fair and try it again without changes before rating.  Still a great recipe but I was hoping for a little more flavor.  I would recommend a little more mustard or lemon juice depending on how your taste steers.  It was very good, however, served over pasta with a bit of salt added to accentuate the flavors.

Hate to be a spoil sport, but wouldn't make this one again.  I read all the reviews and followed many of the suggestions:  less butter, more lemon juice, garlic and parsley; used the easy peel shrimp and added Old Bay seasoning; didn't overbake it.  We found it bland, and definitely not "eye-rolling"...especially in light of the monetary investment and time consumed to peel the shrimp.    I can't figure out why one would leave the tails on the shrimp, either.  I served it over linguini and that made it really hard to consume without a mess!  Sorry!

Well, I thought this was fantastic!  The kids all thought it was very good.  The only thing I will say, is I watched the time on the cooking - which ended up about 9 minutes, and I kept mixing the shrimp in the sauce, while it was cooking in the oven.  I served over angel hair pasta, and this was great.  The only thing I added was salt, but I think you can add the salt after serving, since everyone likes different amount of salt.  Will make again!!!  Thanks!

This was very good.  Very simple to make.  It would make a great summer time dish with a fresh salad and roasted corn on the cob.

I used margerine instead of butter and cut back on the amount of margerine to save calories. It was still very good. Served with angel hair pasta, Garlic bread, and white wine.

Butter, garlic, shrimp...what's not to love?  Be careful about overcooking the shrimp.  I would even suggest checking on them after only 10 minutes. I also found that this recipe called for way too much butter. If you're not serving pasta or potatoes or rice to drizzle the butter on, use less of it.

Outstanding recipe!  Easy & tasty too!  We like a lot of garlic so I used 4 cloves.  I also added some red pepper flakes and topped it with fresh grated parm.  Served with garlic toast and declared it restaurant quality ~ Will make again & again!  Thanks, Kimber!

Awesome!  I used 3 cloves of garlic and added some bread crumbs as well!  I also used uncooked shrimp and will pre cook them next time.  I tossed the shrimp with some angel hair and added a little parmesan before serving. Outstanding.

Great recipe! I have made it 3 times now.I made it for company on New Years Eve, along with spicy carrots (which I will be placing on this site). Everyone made nummy sounds at the table, & asked for the recipe! The last time I made it I added scallops.That was good also. Next time I will reduce butter to 1/2 cup.

We really enjoyed this.  Although after reading some of the reviews in advance, we decided to precook the shrimp a little by putting in warm water until just turning pink.  This reduced the oven time in the recipe to 5-7 minutes.  We also added a little extra dijon and also added 1/2 teaspoon of Bay Seasoning, then served it over angel hair pasta.  It was great.  Next time, I'll add a little extra dijon and add a little garlic.

Awesome!  As others have suggested, we used cooked shrimp and decreased the amount of mustard to 1 tablespoon.  (We used a Sweet-n-Sassy mustard.)  Served over pasta with creamed spinach for a side.  Super and quick dinner!

Great recipe! Quick and simple to make. I would have rated this a 5 except for the fact that it could use a little spicing. Next time I will try chili powder or tarragon or more garlic.

Very good. Only changes I made were instead of 1 cup butter I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. olive oil and the shrimp I had already had tails removed. This was easy to make and tasted very good, my husband ate it all in 1 serving.

I have used this recipe on a regular basis for years and realized I have never reviewed it.  I think this is by far the easiest way to make shrimp scampi that I have ever seen.  I have used raw shrimp, which is the best, but I have, many times, used cooked tail on 26/30 count shrimp.  Sometimes I take the tails off, sometimes I don't, depending on how much prep time I have.  This is great served with 3/4 to 1 lb of whole wheat linguini, spaghetti or angel hair pasta.  If you use cooked shrimp, subtract a minute or 2 from the cooking time.  It's a really nice restaurant quality meal served with fresh grated parmesan or romano cheese, whole wheat pasta and a nice garden salad.  I highly recommend it !!!

All I can say is-WOW!!
It was easy and so incredibly delicious. I only defrosted about 10 large shrimp and then I defrosted some tilapia I wanted to use up(another hurricane is coming and I lost alot of food in the first one)
 So I decided to use it up.
I did put a little white wine in it too. If I have a kitchen after Ivan I'll make this often.

Wow! This recipe was both easy and tasty. Myself and family thought that it tasted like it came from The Red Lobster Restaurant. We served it over rice and added a side salad for a complete

This is fantastic!  Made it for my in-laws, they fought over leftovers!  Wasn't sure about the Dijon mustare--glad I left it in--made a nice addition.  Highly recommend.  Very easy and delicious!

Delicious and very easy! I made this and served company and they loved it.  I used my cast iron skillet on stovetop to melt butter and then added shrimp and put it in oven.  This made for an easy one dish meal. Thanks Kimber :) I will be making this my only scampi recipe!

OUTSTANDING. Easy to do, the only caution is that care must be taken not to overcook the shrimp.

This was absolutely delicious!  I was a little nervous about the dijon mustard but I must say the addition of the mustard made the dish.  It was easy and delicious.  Thank you for sharing this tasty dish.

This was so good!  I made this recipe for two people and it was terrific.  The only changes I made was to use Lite Butter, more lemon juice, and add salt and pepper.  Also, I made the sauce in a skillet and added the shrimp.  Great served with a baked potato.  Thanks for the SUPER EASY and great-tasting recipe!

This is so good it is almost painful to eat.  It can be difficult not to overcook the shrimp, but, done correctly, this recipe is incredible.  Serve with bread, broccoli, and champagne like we did and it is a meal to remember.

I made a lo-fat version using a light butter spread and scaling it down to only 2 servings...for a total of 7 WW pts when served with angel hair pasta!  It was still SO good.  The mustard makes it.

This was very easy and my husband said it was a dish he'd like me to make again.  I used all of the ingredients except the parsley(I didn't have any). I served it with brown rice an it was great.

Very very easy - great for a weeknight supper with some fettucine and a salad.  The Dijon mustard adds a nice flavor but doesn't make the dish at all mustardy.  This recipe is destined to become a staple in my household!

OOOOOO... we loved this!  For two of us, I used a one pound mixture of shrimp, scallops, and calamari rings (available at Trader Joe's) instead of all shrimp.  Cut the reminder of the recipe in half, of course.  A definite keeper in our recipe file!

Three words were uttered from my husband upon his first bite.."Oh My Gosh!"  That pretty much sums it up.  This was so easy and it was so delicious.  I used 1 pound of extra large shrimp which left lots of extra sauce for pasta or dipping.  Am looking forward to making again and putting in scampi/escargot dishes with harvarti backed on top!!! Thank you!

This Shrimp Scampi Bake is the best....especially when you take crusty bread and dip it in the sauce. I suggest using large shrimp, as they shrink quite a bit.

Easy and tasty (and a good find for someone on the Atkins diet) but seems to be missing a little something (salt?)..Parmesan cheese makes a nice topper. The 12 minute time is too long (used 21-30 count shrimp) - the shrimp was tough..changed time to 7 minutes and it turned out much more tender. Thanks for sharing.

I have made it twice in a week, once for just hubby and I, then for the rest of my family.  I did not have fresh shrimp, so I used frozen with tails,  and also used dried parsley.  This was incredible in both taste and ease.  
For those having an issue with "too much sauce", that is a true oxymoron.   Use any leftover sauce over chicken, rice, potatoes, pasta, whatever.  Dip your bread or biscuits in it to flavor them!  My entire family loves garlic, so I am never shy about adding it to anything.  This was awesome!

My pet peeve is tail-on shrimp in sauce, especially butter sauce.  I was fortunate enough to purchase two pounds of raw 21-30 shrimp that had been thoroughly cleaned, shelled and de-tailed.  I made the recipe as written, adding red pepper flakes (traditional) and extra garlic to suit our taste buds.  LOVE the addition of Dijon in this recipe, as it binds with the fat to make an actual sauce.  Cook time for the jumbo shrimp was 15 minutes.  Served on a platter of linguine and garnished with parm curls and more fresh parsley, this was a fabulous meal.  My family requested (and received) homemade “Red Lobster biscuits” which I thought were overkill...but a fresh, crusty baguette and roasted asparagus would have been the perfect accompaniments.  This recipe has forever changed the way I make scampi!

I used 1/2 the amount of butter and reduced the total recipe since it was just family. So delicious over fettucini.

The flavor was great. I did reduce the amount of the sauce and added a splash of white wine based on other reviews as well as the amount of mustard so as not to overwhelm. (Used just a half tsp or so.) Very good!

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  I cook for 2, so If I make something that makes 6, I can have some the next day.  This scampi was wonderful the next day.  Better than before.  The seasoning had time to mix with the other flavors.  It was also quick!!!

So easy! I added a tablespoon of Old Bay to the butter mixture, and poured the extra butter over linguine (with  1/2 cup of salted pasta water) after baking with the shrimp. Delicious!

Probably will try another recipe next time

WOW! Amazing flavor and so easy. Followed most of the reviews and cut the butter in half, added the wine, left out the mustard, but added salt, pepper, and thyme. Only cooked for 7 minutes due to having only a half pound of smaller shrimp. Will definitely be making this again, thanks for the great recipe!

Delish. I didn’t have Dijon so I used a tablespoon of brown mustard and a splash (or two) of Chardonnay. Even the picky kids liked it. Happy New Year!

Absolutely delicious and super easy! I followed the recipe exactly. I love sauce and would rather have too much than not enough. Now I know you can cut the butter in half and have plenty.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this! It was one of those dishes where I had no idea how it was going to taste until I took a bite and I was so happy with it. This dish takes A LOT of butter though. Towards the end of my plate I kind of had a "okay I can't keep consuming this much butter" moment so I wouldn't make this dish too often but I will be making it again.  Amazing.

I used a little Old Bay Seasoning on the shrimp, sprinkled fresh grated Parmesan onto the shrimp and baked for 8 minutes. (I used fresh Alaskan jumbo pink shrimp). After baking, I removed it, added Panko crumbs to the top with just another very light sprinkling of fresh grated Parmesan, put it under the broiler for 2 minutes make a nicely browned top. Such a delicious recipe. I used 3/4 cup butter since the shrimp were jumbo and it was perfect.

Delicious and oh sooo easy!  I will cut down on the amount of butter next time and I only used 1 tablespoon of the mustard.  My husband LOVED it.  Served it with a nice fresh salad and pasta.

This is a great recipe. Since there are only 2 of us, I made half a batch using 1 pound of frozen (defrosted) shrimp. It turned out better than I’d expected.

Made this for a quick Saturday night dinner. Wow. Hubs hates mustard so I cut the Dijon in half but we love garlic so I doubled that. Its hot in July in Texas, so I served with a Greek salad and garlic bread. Yum.  So easy so good. Thanks for a great recipe that will be used often

I used 1/2 the butter and left out the lemon juice since I’m not a fan of lemon. Sometimes leaving out the lemon juice makes it bland so I added a little red pepper flakes because I like some spice. I then put shrimp in a small casserole and some cod in another small casserole. Put 1/2 of the sauce over each and baked. it was so yummy!  I’ve been looking for some fish recipes. I wasn’t sure if this would work but it was really good. Can’t bake them together because the cod takes so much longer. Then served over zoodles with a piece of cod and a few shrimp. Everyone loved it.

Super easy to throw together for a quick and tasty dinner. it smells delightful and the husband loved it. I did follow the advice of another reviewer and added a bit of white wine and used just a touch of the mustard. Will make again and again.

My daughter love this recipe however we always make extra sauce because the noodles get dry the next day. So we have extra sauce so it can be fresh. We also make red lobsters biscuits to go with it Yummy!!!

Amazing!  Best recipe for shrimp I've ever made!  They came out perfect, not over cooked and full of flavor.  Thank you to the contributor.

It was super simple and seemed kinda fancy for how easy it really is to make! But I definitely changed things about this recipe. I only did half the amount of butter; I also added more lemon juice (3 Tbsp); I added lime juice-3 Tbsp; I added 1/2 c white wine; I added more garlic (2 Tbsp) and I added more fresh parsley (3 Tbsp). I would recommend lightly sprinkling the shrimp with salt and pepper once they're in the baking dish, before topping them with the butter mixture. Also, depending on your oven, you may want to check the shrimp sooner. My shrimp were cooked by 9 minutes. Then I poured the butter and shrimp into some orzo pasta I had prepared, stirred that all together, and served it over a bed of sauteed onions, zucchini, and yellow squash. It was a delicious dinner!

Added parmesan cheese sprinkled on top before baking and omg it was good.  Next time I will have some crusty bread to sop up the garlic and butter.  What a waste of delicious sauce.

I followed the recipe amounts minus 2 tbsp of butter. I used basil instead of parsley and added 1 tbsp of Cajun seasoning.  Because I used frozen shrimp I only cooked it for 7 minutes then I added some grated Parmesan & broiled it for a few minutes. It was delicious served with garlic bread.

I t was a little too rich for the family. Iwould decrease the butter to 3/4 cup next time. My teenage son made it with very little help.

This was a really good base recipe. I followed the recipe and my shrimp was fine with the 10-12 minutes in the oven. The last 4 minutes I topped it with Panko and turned it up to broil (YUM!). I also added a package of imitation crab meat crumbled in with the shrimp. It was great! I highly recommend adding crab meat to this dish.

Only thing I changed from original receipe.... When shrimp were 99% done, sprinkled with bread crumbs and put under broiler for couple of seconds to brown crumbs.  This is a GREAT receipe.  So easy to make.   Loved over pasta.

This was delicious and easy to prepare. I doubled the lemon and used half of the mustard. I also increased the garlic and parsley because of preference. Will definitely make again!

For 12 ounces of shrimp I used 1 T butter, 1 tsp mustard, 1 T white wine, dried parsley, and all else the same amounts.  Served with whole grain angel hair pasta and a salad.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent quick dish!  Love that it's baked as I don't care for the clean up after sautéing!  I made it exactly as written the first time and it was great, but we don't typically need that much butter. The second time I used half the amount, as some others recommended, a dash of Old Bay, and lime juice instead of lemon (because it was on hand). It  was also delicious!  Served with asparagus roasted in the oven at the same time and pasta, it was definitely company worthy!

This was such an awesome recipe. I’m more of a baker than a cook but this was so simple to do. I did half the amount of shrimp and half the butter but the same amount of mustard and other seasoning. I did also add in some wine, per the advice of other reviews. I also cooked the shrimp for about 10-11 minutes bc my shrimp were just a tad bit smaller. I’m not a fan of mustard but you can’t taste it at all. This was an amazing recipe! Definitely one I will make again.

Delicious! Super easy, fast and tasty. I didn’t have the fresh parsley, to me, with the dried one it’s still cane out great. I ate this with steamed broccoli, drizzle the remaining sauce on the veggies yum.  Follow the instructions and you’ll have a winner every time.

At the recommendation of other reviewers I too cut the butter in half; it worked fine. I felt I needed more seasoning,, flavor . Next time I make this I will  cook my garlic and butter in the oven before adding the shrimp and add  sliced lemons and Tony Chatchere seasoning or a little cayenne. Letting those flavors marry before adding the mustard and shrimp I think will help, but overall this was a wonderful  dinner.

I used cooked lobster tails from Costco instead of shrimp and it was delicious!! Everyone raved about it. Instead of just putting it over the pasta, when the sauce was done, I tossed the pasta with parmesan and baked it together. It was so good I was asked to make it a second day in a row.

I made this for my family, served over linguini pasta.  Everyone thought it was “okay” but it needed something.  It’s a good basic recipe, but next time, I’ll probably tweek it a bit.

So easy to make this and tastes amazing . I agree that if you don't want too much 'sauce', you can cut down on the butter. I wanted my pasta covered, so I did about 3/4 cup and it was more than enough.

Had a craving for shrimp scampi. Found this, but I omitted parsley and subbed 2 chopped green onions, added 1/2 cup white wine, 1/8 cup of chopped sun-dried tomatoes + a good swirl of olive oil in with the butter and garlic on the stove. Regular mustard works, too, go light. Baked in 12 minutes, not 15. Shrimp need not be completely thawed, too. Served over 4 minute angel hair pasta. Lovely meal in about 30 minutes!

I’ve made this recipe several times with many variations. We eat outs tossed in pasta so we use 3/4-1c butter. We add a splash of white wine, 2tbs of fresh chopped or freeze fried basil and a sprinkle of old bay. I also skip the melting pot step and put all ingredients in a glass baking dish and melt in the microwave, mix it and add the shrimp before cooking in the oven.

Made this tonight and after reading a few reviews, I made a few changes. I reduced the dijon to 1 tablespoon, reduced butter to 1 1/2 cups and added a splash of white wine.  After baking for 12 minutes, I removed it from the oven and sprinkled some panko bread crumbs and grated fresh parmesan cheese. I returned it to the oven on broil for just a couple of minutes.  Served it with angel hair pasta that had some olive oil, butter, parmesan cheese and salt and pepper. It was a delicious and super easy dinner and will definitely be making again.

Didn't have parsley, so left it out. Didn't have Dijon mustard so used french's regular mustard instead. This dish was so good. I served it over brown rice with a side salad. Hubby loved it.

I made it for two and instead of putting it over some form of pasta I put it over a cheesy rice.  It was very rich!  But I love the mustard flavor that comes.through.  It was very simple to make.  We will make it again.

Super easy and fast to make, I bake it all up and then stir it into linguine.  I only use about 1/3rd of the called for mustard, the full amount makes it a little too tangy--for my taste at least--and I add crushed red pepper flakes for a little zip, along with a splash of wine.  Since I've found this recipe, I no longer make scampi in a pan on the stove.  I find the baked shrimp to be more tender and far less rubbery if I happen to overcook them a little.  Recommend!

Really easy and flavorful recipe.  Combined it with fresh fettuccine and the amount of butter made for the perfect sauce on the noodles.  Quick, easy and delicious!

Didn't have a fresh lemon so used a lime, and omitted the garlic. The dijon was a nice change.

Very good.  Nice light sauce that didn't overwhelm the shrimp.  I  used half the butter and dijon and double the garlic, added about 1/4 cup dry white wine and threw shrimp in pan still frozen.  The eaters (hubs and 23 y/o son) liked it better than the other ways I've made this dish.  Next time will use the 2 TBSP dijon.  Took about 20 minutes to make.  If you're going to serve on pasta, I'd start heating the water before you start chopping garlic and parsley.  My pasta got a little sticky because the sauce only takes about 3 minutes to make!   Thanks for posting this fast, easy, yummy recipe.  Will be making this often.

This was amazing! The only thing I did differently was using frozen shrimp that I thawed and only using 1tbsp of the Dijon mustard because I was worried about the flavor of it. I didn't need to be though and next time I'll use the full amount. Oh, I also added a splash of white wine as others suggested. Served over angel hair pasta with asparagus spears. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I made it. I a little over half the butter and it was still a lot of extra sauce. Glad I cut it down. But I cut down the mustard by half since I did that to not mess with the flavor, but left the everything else the same. I found out I am not a fan of fresh parsley. Made it taste like the shrimp were earthy. Luckily I chopped coarsely enough to pick it off.

I did make one change, happy that I did. I only added 1/4 tsp of mustard & that was plenty. Other than that, it was very easy to make & very tasty. Would make this again.

Scampi is just an awesome recipe and this variation did not disappoint at all.  I dusted the shrimp with our 'go-to' spice, Red Lobster Seafood Seasoning and put a splash of white wine in the butter mixture.  Baked for 7 min and broiled for 3 min. Served over a bed of miniature star pasta because of the extra sauce was not going to be wasted, it was that tasty.  I used fresh Jumbo shrimp from the Gulf that was on sale for $5.99 per lbs. just off the boat.  Used the heads and shells to make broth for this Sunday's Shrimp & Sausage Gumbo!!!  It is times like these that make us grateful we chose The "Big Bend" in Florida to live.

30 minutes prep for 1 tbsp for butter, garlic, mustard, garlic, and parsley? 

It took 5 minutes to prepare and that's if you're being slow. This took 30 minutes to cook (@450) or more. 

also, did you mean to add pasta to this because shrimp by itself (with the tails) doesn't seem right.

It was fast, simple, easy, and delicious! I opted for pre-cleaned, easy peeled shrimp to cut time down. I made the sauce per the directions here, and poured it over my shrimp and just baked them for less time because they were pretty much cooked already. I drained my linguine and added it to my shrimp dish once it was done in the oven. The sauce flavor the shrimp and pasta to perfect!

Easy peasy!  I didn't put as much butter in (used only 2 tablespoons), and I had 3 oz of leftover white wine that I used to make up for the rest of the butter.  For the last 2 minutes of cooking, I threw some capers over it.  I served it over thin spaghetti and we had a side salad to complete the rest of our dinner.

I think this is a good basic recipe. By adding fresh broccoli, I made this into pretty much a complete one-pan meal. I am giving it 4 stars because I did make changes and I agree with some others who said that prepared exactly as written, it may be a little bland. I did use tilapia but the package of filets I had was only 14 ounces. Also, I have no idea why anyone would cook tilapia for 40 minutes! Anyway, I used 1/2 the amounts for the sauce and minced the garlic. I also added a little white wine.  I lined a 9x13" pan with non-stick aluminum foil and sprinkled my filets with a lemon-pepper seasoning. I also cut up some tomato and green onions and set those aside. After seasoning the filets, I put them in the pan and  also put some spears of fresh broccoli in the pan with the filets. Poured the sauce over the filets and broccoli and baked at 375F for 15 minutes. Put the tomatoes and green onions on top and returned to bake for 5-7 more minutes. Served with a side of rice. Very good.

Made this for the first time, doubled the recipe for the 1 1/2 package of pasta except for the mustard which I kept for 2 tbsp. It was very good, but next time I will add a little more garlic and lemon juice and will add pepper flakes to make it a little bit spicy.

We LOVED this! I did cut the Dijon in half because I know it could be overpowering, and that was perfect for us.  I served this over linguini, and it was wonderful, but it did need some salt, IMO. I will def be making this again as the whole family  loved it~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used half the butter and added a fresh diced tomato, sliced raw mushrooms and a little more garlic. Instead of baking it I put all of the ingredients in a pot and cooked on the stove. I added some chicken broth to the mix and tossed in cooked linguine noodles after the shrimp was cooked through and mixed it all together. A dash of salt n pepper and all done. Very easy and flavorful recipe!

I substituted 1/2 cup bacon grease for 1/2 cup butter and added 5 pieces of bacon. I placed the shrimp on zoodles (3 zucchini) before baking and substituted cilantro for parsley. The flavor pairings were amazing! Quite possibly the best thing I've eaten in a long time! I've been on Keto Mediterranean diet and this is a low carb but extremely satisfying recipe. My husband almost fell over he loved it so much. Said he didn't miss the pasta, which is saying a LOT for him since he adores pasta.

This was extremely easy and delicious. I cut all ingredients in half except for the shrimp. I also sauteed 1/4 c. chopped onion, 1/8 c chopped green pepper and 1/4 c chopped fresh tomatoes.  I substituted olive oil for some of the butter and white wine for some of the lemon juice.  Baked as directed for 13 min., then under broiler to finish. Served over shrimp garlic ravioli.

My 4 yr old requested shrimp for dinner and this recipe had her coming back for 3rds!! I gave it 4 of 5 because I'm not too keen on the Dijon mustard flavor that seemed to outshine any other flavor.  I personally will add more lemon juice next time and cut back the Dijon in the future, but great easy to make recipe! Thank you!

This is one of the best scampi's I have ever had! I will definitely be making this over and over again. 
Couple adjustments I made:
- I had about 1/2 the amount of shrimp which was thawed from a frozen bag  so I did cut the recipe in half
- I used half of half the amount of dijon mustard because I'm not a huge fan
- I used jarred garlic (it's my favorite, no hassle!)

I have made this twice, once with fresh shrimp and once with frozen shrimp.  I took advice from other reviews; cut the mustard in 1/2 and used a little less butter.  I also used whole wheat linguini.  It is so easy and so full of flavor!  This is a winner!

Excellent! Huge hit at the Family Christmas party. I followed the recipe as written, except added about 3/4 cup white wine, and marinated for about an hour. This will be in the regular party rotation!??

This is extremely good. Like others I used frozen shrimp (got it on sale) which I thawed, peeled, and blotted dry. Also listened to reviewers and cut back to 1/2 cup of butter and used dried parsley since it was all I had. I did spray my baking dish with olive oil before laying out the shrimp. I followed the rest of the recipe and it was delist.

I've never made a dish yet that my kids asked for more 3x!!! We finished the whole dish, no leftovers, and I made 3lbs of jumbo shrimp! Super simple dish, and it's extremely easy to make shrimp. Only thing I wasn't able to add was the Dijon mustard and that's only because I didn't have any to use. The dish still came out extremely well. I pre seasoned the shrimp, and that added to the flavor. We ate over angel hair pasta, which I'm glad we did because the noodles soaked up the thin pasta well since it wasn't thick. Also added Parmesan cheese on top to bake with the shrimp. Yum yum! This easy dish will be added to our dinner menu for sure!

This was very good and easy to make- you can also tailor it to your personal taste.  I added a bit of parmesan and bread crumbs to the top and served over linguine. Also, I used all the amounts of ingredients the recipe called for and was happy as we like to have enough sauce to dip bread in! I would maybe add a touch more seasoning/salt or old bay to give it a bit more flavor. Thank you for the easy and delicious recipe!

All I can say is WOW. I hsd my doubts about adding mustard.  We're not huge mustard fans.  SO GLAD I tried it!  It imparts a wonderful under stated flavor and richness.   My husband is the shrimp eating king.  It got very high marks from his side of the table.   He loved it!!

When I make it next time, I won't cook the shrimp quite as long and will probably serve with rice, but this was excellent. The hardest part was peeling and deveining the shrimp, but that is always true (I love fresh caught shrimp).

Didn't have lemon, so I used lime. Added wine, Parmesan and Panco  as  others advised. I cut back on time, but then had to keep adding, so I'll try the full time next time. Very good.

Excellent...( only changes were a small portion of the butter, replaced with  olive oil to make a little healthier) I think its a personal preference, if you like or don't like the mustard..I thought it was perfect.  I  knew going to the beach we would have good quality  fresh gulf  shrimp.  First time for this recipe, and it was a hit with adults as well as kids. I served with "pasta on the side", and the sauce from the shrimp seasoned the pasta beautifully. A wonderful meal. Definitely a keeper!!

This was a delicious recipe. I halved the recipe. Prepared the shrimp in advance, sprinkled old bay seasoning and refrigerated covered until time to cook.  As I didn't take them out to bring them to room temperature, the shrimp (XL) took 14 minutes to cook at 450 degrees. I made this with rice and there as plenty of juice to cover both dishes and have some left. A delicious recipe. Thank you so much for the ease and deliciousness of this meal.

I made this recipe as the instructions stated. It was very very bland. I don't think I'll make this again. I do have to say that the shrimp was cooked very well. I never baked shrimp before, I will do this more often.

OMGosh this is sooooo delish! i did change a little but even the original I can tell would have been perfect just as is. I used all the ingredients but realized I didn't have enough shimp so i also added some chicken I cooked and cut up. I also added 1/4th tspn pepper, 1 tbsn garlic powder, 1 tbsn onion powder, 1 tspn old bay seasoning, 1 can of diced garlic tomatoes and a pretty big splash of wine. I cooked fettuccine and mixed it all together. All 5 of my children gobbled it up and that is VERY RARE in my family! Thanks for this delicious recipe. Oh and do not leave out the dijon mustard bc it really adds a nice flavor.

Excellent. I love the dijon mustard, but I only used 1.5 tbsp, which was a good decision. I heated the sauce ingredients in an oven-proof skillet, and then instead of transferring the shrimp and sauce to a shallow baking dish, I put the skillet directly in the oven. One less dish to wash! Will definitely make again.

I only used 1 tbsp of mustard, 1 stick of butter, and added about 3/4 cup chardonnay.  I loved that I could combine all the ingredients and have it ready to go, then just pop it in the oven just before we were ready for the main dish.  I cooked it for 14 minutes for extra large shrimp.  There was plenty of sauce for pasta and for dipping garlic bread in.

I loved it but maybe a little to much butter. It was heavy but really buttery and delicious. I added some noodles and green beans with ponzu and garlic salt.

Needed a recipe that called for everything I already had, with the exception of the shrimp.  I used a few less shrimp and I regret it after tasting the finished product.  SPOT ON with the ingredients and amounts.  This is my go-to for a side with steak dinner.  My husband was pleasantly surprised, as this was made with his #FathersDay2016 meal!

This was an incredible and quick meal to make.  Delicious, even though I didn't have any white wine to add!  I used 1/2 pound of frozen, cooked jumbo shrimp for my husband and me, and it was just enough for us when put on linguini.  Using only 1/2 lb. of shrimp, off course, I reduced the ingredients accordingly.  The meal was a great success and gives me a terrific idea for last minute meal preparation.  Definitely a five star meal.

Prepared exactly as directed but thought the cook time in the oven was too long. Shrimp turned out a bit overcooked and tough. Won't make this again.

Made it as written. Came out perfectly. Definitely a keeper and looks beautiful. I used other's ideas of tossing a few breadcrumbs and Parmesan shreds on top for the last few minutes to give it a browned look. Great idea. It did need a bit of color. Looks impressive. Definitely go for the big shrimps when when they are on sale and get the ones with the tails on. Worth it!

YUM. I halted the entire recipe because I only had 1 bag of shrimp (used frozen) and sprinkled the shrimp with old bay before pouring the sauce over it. Very good and super easy! Served over linguine with crusty french bread.

The only reason I don't have a picture is because it was eaten too fast!  This was unbelieveably good and easy! I was at school an hour extra, got home, fixed it, took a shower (as it baked) and was done with dinner and dishes by 7 (I got home at 5).  How much better could that be?  Husband LOVED it!  For the two of us, I only used 1 lb of frozen shrimp. (raw, deveined, no tail)...the bag with 41-50.  I also didn't have parsley, but it wasn't missed.  I might use more dijon next time...just because I love it...not because it needs more.  It gives the sauce a little texture.  I served over linguine.  PERFECT!!! This might just be a weekly meal!  Thank you!!!

This was so incredibly easy! I used the amount of sauce suggested since I used three 12oz. bags of shrimp (many stated the sauce was too much for the amount of shrimp called for). I used the same amount of mustard called for, and I didn't feel it overpowered the dish. If you're looking for something easy with a fairly nice flavor profile for shrimp, I suggest this. Will defnitely try again.

Mustard and all, this recipe is great.  It's foolproof, especially when you watch the shrimp closely.  15 minutes is WAY too long though!  My large shrimp were cooked in 9 or 10 minutes.
Like many reviewers, I used half the butter only.  A whole cup is overkill and not necessary, unless you're dumping it on piles of pasta.
I served my shrimp and sauce on a handful of raw baby spinach, which sort of wilted from the heat, keeping it a low carb meal.

I made this recipe and used the full amount of butter but took the suggestion to cut the mustard by half. I also used scallops and shrimp - it was awesome. Better than I have had in most restaurants. Will definitely make this again and thanks to all for the recommendations!

I followed the advice of others and only  used 1/2 cup butter, I added a small amt. of diced celery and onion and sautéed till soft prior to adding the minced garlic..... otherwise made as directed. I served over bowtie pasta (leftover from another meal) and finished with a sprinkle of fresh parsley.  Will omit the celery & onion next time and do everything else the same. Hubby and I enjoyed the taste, I really really enjoyed the simplicity and look of the dish once plated. We will definitely make this again. It was very, very good!

Easy to make but flavorful recipe. The mustard adds a nice zest to the scampi and cuts the richness of the butter. Followed

The only thing I changed on this recipe was to add some fresh grated parmesean cheese to it. This was by far the most simple dinner I have made in ages and it was absolutely fantastic. I used the same amount of butter that it called for and while it was alot, it was good because I tossed the pasta in it and dipped the French bread in it as well. I will be making this again and again. My whole family loved it!

Excellent and so easy!  Covers one-and-a-half pounds of linguine.  Serve with Parmesan cheese, as desired.

I read many reviews and decided to use the following:  
1/2 cup butter,
1 T dijon mustard,
1 T fresh-squeezed lime juice (I didn't have a lemon on hand!),
2 cloves of minced garlic,
A handful of fresh, chopped parsley,
Splash of dry, white wine, and
2 pounds of frozen medium shrimp, thawed and dried.  

Toss in 3 T of olive oil  and 1/4 cup of  Parmesan cheese to the  cooked and drained pasta.  Once shrimp mixture is baked,  add to the pasta.  *Remember to toss before serving as butter mixture will settle.*

I think this was a great recipe, and I would have given it 5 stars even if I didn't make any changes.  I am hesitant to "add changes" , but I will just share them here
I used 2 lbs jumbo frozen shrimp (thawed and drained)... I used 3/4 c butter... I added spinach to make it "Florentine"... and I added a frozen  "3 pepper blend and onions" to add in the veggies.  It was so easy and fast! Thank you "KIMBER" for this fast yummy recipe!

I used only half of the butter called for and only 1 tbsp of mustard.   We love garlic so I doubled the garlic and kept the lemon juice on the side since my husband doesn't like it.    Delicious and easy to make and clean up too using the aluminum foil on the pan.

I used the whole cup of butter because we like the sauce over the pasta. I lined a clear Pyrex dish with extra thick aluminum foil for easy clean up. I used frozen shrimp, one package and about 3 packages of the small scallops. I stirred at 7 minutes and continued to bake for another 5 min. So 12  min in total. It was delicious !!!

This is the best tasting, easiest scampi recipe I have come across. I followed the ingredients and added spinach to make it Florentine like and served it over linguini. 
The only thing I did differently from the directions is NOT bake it. I melted the butter in a 12 inch skillet instead of a pan, added the garlic, lemon, and mustard and let it saute for a minute.  Then I added the shrimp to the skillet. I flipped the shrimp after a few minutes until they were all pink. This method eliminated dishes and using the oven, and it seemed quicker. By the time my scampi was done, from prep to sit down, it took only about 15 minutes (including boiling the linguine).

This recipe is so simple.  I really like it.  I make it nearly true to recipe everytime.  I melt the butter in the microwave and whisk the rest of the ingredients into the melted butter (I don't use the garlic -- allergic  -- but the flavors are nice enough without it) and pour it over frozen shrimp - I don't always want to take the time for thawing and melting on the stove top :-).  I cook it in the oven for 20 mins, and serve over noodles  Dinner = done

Delicious!!! I plan on making this again. I didn't use chopped garlic, though, instead I used 1 tsp of minced garlic, also I made sure to add the mixture leaving the shells and tails on as suggested in the recipe. Yummy!,,,

As written....really good.  Changed a few things to suit my families  taste.  replace 1/2 the butter with chicken broth,  add a splash of white wine, a few sprinkles of Old Bay seasoning and last 3 minutes top with bread crumbs and broil.  Make extra  sauce to go over pasta.

This recipe is great.  I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because you only Need half the amount of butter it calls for.  Cut it back and it is superb!

Awesome! Loved everything about this recipe.  Easy to make, great flavor.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Made half for two of us and hubby finished it off with a big - "this is great, can I finish what's left?"  Will be making again - often.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best and easiest Scampi I have ever seen.  Baking the shrimp gives them a crispness that is not possible by skillet cooking.  It works best with raw shrimp with the tail on for a good presentation.  I serve it over high fiber noodles.

This recipe was super easy.  However, the mustard was over-powering even though I had cut it in half.  I made this again and omitted the mustard and added Old Bay.  Much better!

Fresh delicious & easy to make! I have made this for dinner parties in larger quantities and it is perfect for casual or more elegant menus. The Dijon gives it depth of flavor and it's also delicious reheated the next day. Everyone who has tried it says it's the best Scampi they have tasted!

Will definitely keep this in my quick minute meal box! I love Shrimp Scampi and this is the first time I've cooked it. If you like sauce, I would keep it as is and not cut butter in half. Was trying to cut corners and leave the tails on, will make sure I take off in the future because it took me longer to dig in and enjoy!

Very good!  I followed sydney's recommendation and added Old Bay Seasoning since I had it in the cupboard and the breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese, and that gave it a little zip but made it a little salty, so probably would use unsalted butter if I added those again.  Also could really taste the lemon.  I would make this again!

This was quick and simple.  I used 1 stick of butter, 1/2 Tbs. of mustard for our taste, and didn't have real lemon juice or fresh parsley and it was still really good.  I bet with fresh lemon and parsley it would be even better.  Watch the time though since it really depends on the size of the shrimp how quickly it cooks.

Excellent!  1/2 the butter and dijon,doubled the fresh lemon juice. Cooking time was perfect.I also cut the tails off of a bag of frozen, peeled shrimp that I thawed and mixed the cooked shrimp and sauce into the pasta. So easy. Great recipe and a keeper!! Oh,going back for seconds if they left me any :)

I personally thought this was just ok. I only used one pound of shrimp as there are only 3 of us. Hubby rarely rates things as a 4, so thats why I'm rating this as such. To me, nothing compares to the shrimp lemon pepper linguini on this site.

very easy recipe I used colossal shrimp went by the recipe, but added a splash of white wine, a pinch of red pepper flakes, sprinkled garlic powder on top before baking.  Sprinkled parmesan cheese to serve, very good, will make again.

I love shrimp scampi and I have been looking for a better recipe. I was really hoping that this would be it. Unfortunately, this was way too sour and has way too much butter......it was not good at all :-( I definitely will NOT be making it again.

This recipe was so easy and awesome. Halved the recipe because my son does not like shrimp but did not change the ingredients. We will definitely make this again.

This was really easy & tasty.  It will definitely be included into dishes I make with some frequency.  I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup, and could probably have cut it to 1/3 cup for the two of us.  I cut the Dijon down to 1 Tbsp, and could probably cut that a little more.  I liked the tang of the mustard, but it was just a tad too strong.  I added a splash of white wine and sprinkled a bit of bread crumbs on top.  I checked it at 8 minutes and it was DONE.    Served over angel hair pasta and served with fresh grated parmesan.  So quick and easy and delicious!

Extremely scrumptious.  I did add 2T cooking sherry to the sauce and I topped the casserole with ritz crackers crumbs.  It was absolutely delicious.  Everyone raved.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! My fiancé absolutely loved it. I'm usually more of a critic than he is, and must say I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe as written for the most part, only cooked shrimp for 10 minutes and they came out perfect. I used dried parsley instead of fresh. I also added a splash of cooking wine. Thanks

Yum! I read a LOT of the reviews before I try a recipe and look for trends before I attempt any changes. I usually follow to the letter, but if I notice the same suggestions, I will usually follow those- I reduced the butter by half, as many people suggested and then doubled the garlic and reduced the Dijon to 1 tbsp. and added the Old Bay seasoning. Delicious.

Excellent recipe. It's easy to make and has an incredible flavor. Only think I would change is add a touch more acidity to the sauce and try to thicken it just a little more. Having said that, if I'd had some cheddar biscuits or a hearty bread to soak the sauce up with, it's consistency wouldn't have mattered. Thank you for the recipe, will be making it more and more.

Excellent recipe, I have made this a few times already. Tweaks were, like other reviewers suggested, used half the amount of butter. Just not needed and still had enough sauce to coat the pasta. The next time I made, with the butter I took out I added white wine (1/2 cup butter, 1/2 white wine), which added another dimension to the flavor. This recipe will work with precooked shrimp, just lower the temp to 400 and cook for less time depending on the size of the shrimp. 

In the summer, when it's too hot to cook inside. I made the sauce, use some to marinate the shrimp in and grilled the shrimp. Made some pasta, used the left over sauce to coat the pasta, serve as normal - fantastic! The grilling will add a little something too.

Would love to give this more stars!  I did alter the recipe a bit just because it seemed to make sense but the ingredients were not changed.  This was a huge hit!  It even beat out my husbands signature scampi!!

I didn't know shrimp scampi was so incredibly easy to make! It sounds off putting to have any type of mustard in the sauce, but you can't even tell and it gives it that extra flavor. If you don't want a lot of sauce, limit the amount of butter you use because there will definitely be a lot left.

GREAT recipe! I let the shrimp sit in the garlic butter mixture for about 15 minutes while the water boiled for the pasta, and the flavors of the garlic and parsley sunk in so well! Makes a good garlic butter sauce for pasta as well, though adding Parmesan cheese on top may be needed for spaghetti topping.

This recipe is fabulous!  Thank you for sharing. I didn't have fresh parsley but dried worked just fine. There are only 2 of us so I only used a stick of butter but left everything else at the same measurements. I did add a splash of white wine just because we like it. Great, easy and quick dinner!

This is awesome... Only 4 stars as is... Added about 5 huge cloves of garlic and pepper and this was awesome!! Very much like the famous seafood place everyone loves. I would definitely cut the butter in half of you're not planning on using it with pasta or your sides. I served with mashed potatoes with chives and steamed broccoli so the sauce complimented those perfectly.

Very yummy. 
The only thing I changed was using wheat pasta, much more healthier which means I could eat more of it, it turned out delicious.

Great quick meal. My kids have always loved shrimp. I liked the touch of Dijon and baking it how cleaver. However a full cup of butter is ALOT. I cut it in half and that was plenty, to make up for it I added dry white wine and a dash of Lea and Perrin. I also added mushrooms and sundries tomatoes, and topped it with Parmesan cheese for my preference.  All in all good meal (only 4 stars for the amount of butter suggested. you will get a belly ack for sure. )

2nd dish I tried from here. Read through some reviews and modified with some of other's suggestion. Added a little white wine and about a tsp of parmasan cheese and cooked for 8 min. I cooked for one and breaking everything in half was just fine. Absolutely delicious and I'm a novice cook!

I used spinach fettuccine, added some white wine & old bay seasoning to the sauce.  I sauteed some veggies - zucchini, yellow squash and tomatoes and mixed it with the sauce, shrimp and pasta at the end. It turned out delicious!

Kimber, you gave me a great springboard and my family raved about the dish. So thank you! After just experiencing a meal that was too lemony, I immediately reduced the fresh lemon juice to 1/2 tbsp. I juice my own lemons and have found the lemon flavor too strong in many recipes. Perhaps when using jarred lemon juice the flavor isn't the same, but I just don't know. As for the mustard, I used 1 tbsp Dijon mustard and 1/2 tbsp Country Style Dijon mustard. My shrimp were rather large, so I did not adjust the butter so I would have enough to coat the linguine or rice when reheating for lunch the next day. The best advice I can give - sample the sauce before pouring over the shrimp. If too lemony, try adding a little more mustard or red pepper flakes. Take time to adjust the sauce to your liking!
I was very happy with the meal. I chopped extra parsley to sprinkle on top for that extra eye appeal. And had Parmesan cheese handy. Next time, I may add some spinach, but what a wonderful base to start with and play with!

My family really enjoyed this. I did not modify the recipe and served it over Penne pasta. I added a little bit of Parmesan cheese to my son's dish.

I rate this dish 4 and a half stars! The taste was very good! This is a great base recipe to start with and then let your creativity go with it! I had only about half the shrimp that were required for this recipe, so I improvised and put the baked shrimp on top of a bed of whole wheat angel hair and added sliced olives, sundried tomatoes, and a can of quartered artichoke hearts. I did use the full amount of butter in the recipe. My husband liked it and went back for seconds, and our 2 year old son ate it happily. You know it's good when a toddler eats it! :) Will make again!
UPDATE: 1/3/15 Had the leftovers for dinner. The flavors really seemed to blend well overnight and it was even better tonight!!! I also sprinkled parmesean cheese on top! Delicious!

Simple and good.  I would definitely recommend halving the butter and adding a splash of dry white wine.  I halved the mustard but it probably would've been fine either way.

I used a horseradish brown mustard for this because it was what I had in the refrigerator and about 1 1/2 T of garlic.  Also, after tasting the sauce, I added maybe an 1/8 cup of brown sugar.  Turned out great! Everyone loved it!  So easy and delicious!

Tasty! My family enjoyed this dish, however, I did make some changes. I added about a 3/4 cups of dry white wine and minced one whole onion.

i only had around a pound of shrimp (30-40) so i only used a single stick of butter also i didn't have any dijon mustard so i used a mixture of regular yellow mustard, mayo, rice vinegar, and a pinch of sugar. other than that i made as directed and served with pasta (topped with shredded parmesan cheese) alongside brussel sprouts. Everyone loved it! 

ps.
i cooked my shrimp around 10 mins I wouldn't recommend any longer than that as i had bigger shrimp somewhere between 8 & 10 mins should work depending on the size of the shrimp

This recipe has potential, but it just feels like something is missing. It's a tad too buttery for my tastes, and the shrimp needs more flavor. Being a Marylander, I boiled my shrimp in water with Old Bay and sea salt. It added a lot to the flavor.

Made this for dinner tonight. I as others have done cut the butter to 3/4C and served over Penne with french bread on the side. It was absolutely amazing. The husband was asking for more. Very easy to prepare. I did let the shrimp soak in the butter mix for an hour before cooking. Turned out great. Thanks for posting this for me.

Simple, Simple, Simple! Did I mention this recipe is Simple?!?...Made this today for Father's Day. Was very easy to prepare, as I used frozen uncooked, peeled shrimp. The sauce was easy to prepare, as was the cooking method. I served this over rice. I think the only thing I might do differently next time, is use a little less butter. I will make this again!

This was delicious! Even my picky eaters chowed down. So simple! I minimized the Dijon just a bit and added more garlic because I love garlic. I used small shrimp so it was done at about 6 minutes. Served over linguine. I will use this again! Thank you!

I've made this recipe multiple times since finding it on here. My hubby & 2 year old son love this! I used a1/4cup less butter & a real lemon instead of bottled lemon juice. Super easy & yummy!

I did like how easy it was to make this recipe, but two dislikes. The recipe calls for too much mustard! It over powers the garlic. And also, I bought shrimp with the tails attached and it didn't turn out well. I double checked the cooking time and everything but the tails were still hard. Next time I'll just buy without the tails attached.

I would suggest adding green bell pepper into the sauce pan. Season and cook the shrimp before adding into the pot and shredded parmesan cheese to top it off!

I used this recipe to make a quick lunch for myself using 6 thawed frozen shrimp. I combined 1 tblsp. butter with 1/4 tsp dijon mustard, a pinch of parsley, and 1/4 tsp garlic. I topped 2/3 cup brown rice with the shrimp mixture.  It was fantastic. Will make this next time I have company, or when my family is wanting a seafood dish...so quick and easy!BTW: I added Himalayan salt to taste.

2014: This recipe is delicious!! An easy, quick meal that taste like you spent hours making. I cut the recipe in half  and used less butter than suggested to make it a little more healthy. Amazing!! Every time I make this my kids (3 yo & 16 mo) and husband gobble it up.
2016: I make this recipe very often as my husband always ask for it. Most times I make it as written. I always serve it with pasta and I reserve some pasta water to add to the sauce if needed. I also make it with the addition of one small onion chopped, minced garlic and 6oz fresh spinach on top before I bake it. Delicious!!

I absolutely love this dish! This is coming from a girl that does not cook. My mother was pretty impressed by it. The recipe is quick and easy for a beginner. I kept to the recipe since it was my first time making it. However, I made a few changes due to a lack of certain ingredients. I used frozen shrimp instead raw. Also, I opted for onions instead of parsley. I am not a fan of parsley and the onions were a great addition! Lastly, I used garlic salt in place of chopped garlic. My "condiment" was angel hair pasta. It was a nice touch to the shrimp and sauce. There are only two things I would change for next time. First, I would add more butter because I wanted more sauce. Secondly, I would put less Dijon mustard. The Dijon mustard made the sauce great;however,it was just too much for my taste. Overall, it was a fantastic dish and I will be making it again!

Cut recipe in half but used full amount of parsley, garlic & lemon.  Added some fresh ground pepper and 1/4 c Chardonnay.   Sautéed on stove instead of baking.  Yummy over pasta.

Wow, this was delicious! Used the amount of butter the recipe called for but cut back some on the mustard.  Also used fresh squeezed lime juice (easier to find down in Mexico than lemon juice) and the taste was terrific.  Thank you for a great 'keeper' recipe.

I didn't have shrimp so I made with chicken and angel hair pasta and it was very good!  It was a lot of butter but next I think i'll just add more pasta.  Will make again with shrimp.

VERY DELICIOUS!!!! I ADDED A FEW THINGS TO THE SHRIMP LIKE SEASONING, OLD BAY, EXTRA GARLIC AND WHITE ONIONS. THE ONLY THING THAT I MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE IS THE AMOUNT OF BUTTER USED ONLY BECAUSE IT'S HIGH IN CHOLESTEROL BUT OVERALL VERY TASTY AND EVERYONE AT HOME LOVE IT!

This was really good. I used frozen raw shrimp since that's all that was available at my local store. Next time I will try to find shrimp that is more fresh, though I still loved it.

Just tried this recipe for the first time. All the ingredients were pretty simple. How can you go wrong with baked shrimp scampi.
Well lets begin. First, there is to much butter. I used 1/2 stick of butter. 1 cup of white wine (which is not mentioned).  We all love garlic and with all the garlic I put in you could not even tell it was there.  2 tablesppons of dijon was to much. So I used 1 tablespoon which was much better. Added more lemon juice. Baked it for 15 minutes which I think was to much.  Some of the shrimp were tender and some were tough.  I think somewhere in the cooking process you need to stir the shrimp around so it cooks evenly. I will give this 3 stars because my family said it was good. But its not the same quality as an Italian restuarant.

Dijon was a great addition. I cut back the butter to 2/3 cup and used precooked cocktail shrimp (because that is what I had on hand). Also cooked it all on the stovetop. Next time I would add the white wine.

This was amazing. My husband is so picky that it's actually really difficult to find recipes that he'll like! (His only flaw ;) ) But he loved this, and so did I. It was extremely easy to make, and perfect with some linguine pasta.

We really liked this recipe.  I made it as written with the exception of using frozen shrimp and adding about a tbs of Old Bay seasoning.  It was very easy to prepare.  Yes, a cup of butter seemed excessive, but made a very delicious sauce for the pasta I served with the shrimp.  I did want to add that I only baked the shrimp/sauce for 8 minutes and the shrimp was somewhat overdone.  The next time I make it, I will skip the oven step all together and just toss the shrimp in with the sauce on the stovetop. Will definitely make this again.

This was a great recipe and very easy and quick to prepare. After reading some other reviews I think I'll cut the butter by half and do 1/2 white wine next time I make it. But the flavor was great and I definitely plan on keeping this recipe to use again!

Easy and delicious!  I used large pink fresh shrimp and took the advice of another reviewer to shorten the cook time.  Ten minutes and they were perfect.  Also used half the butter and it was still more than needed for the 20 or so shrimp I cooked.  I also sprinkled a bit of grated parmesan cheese (another suggestion from reviewers!)across them after they came out of the oven. Served with crescent rolls and broccoli, spread a bit of the extra butter mixture over the rolls and broccoli and WOW!  Can't wait to serve this again!

This recipe was amazing...but I completely agree that the mustard should be reduced to 1/2 the amount.  After reading one of the reviews, I made this modification and it was fabulous!  My entire family gobbled it up!!  I was shocked at the amount of butter...no wonder it is so good!!

I had some shrimp in the freezer I needed to use, so this recipe came in very handy. Even with frozen shrimp and dried parsley it turned out well.  A simple, quick, inexpensive and delicious meal.

This recipe is over the moon great.  I have made some modifications due to our family tastes.  I add 1/2 cup of white wine, usually Pinot Grigio.  I only use a 1/2 cup of butter because I usually only use a pound of shrimp.  I also add a little pepper and Italian seasoning.  I do let the shrimp sit in the mixture for a little bit before I put in the oven.  5-7 minutes is plenty of cooking time for medium shrimp.  Watch it carefully so you do not over cook.I cook one pound of linguine and put the sauce on the noodles and serve the shrimp on top.  I do add a bit of EVOO on top of the noodles with parmesan cheese before I add the sauce from the shrimp.  This is a great meal that is quick and easy to make.  Even my picky eaters gobble this meal down.

This is a good base recipe. It just needs to be tweaked to your tastes really. Personally, I like the flavor the Dijon gives to it but 1 cup of butter is waaaay too much. Overall delicious and a keeper.

Kids and I loved it!!!  I was worried it would come out too salty because there was soooo much butter, but it didn't.  It came out great.  The only substitution was the parsley.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried and I didn't have Dijon mustard so I used regular mustard.

Our family does not like Dijon Mustard so I left it out. I too cut butter in half, increased garlic to 5-6 cloves chopped. I added some EVOO with the butter and garlic and then some white wine and let it simmer together very low heat. I too used frozen shrimp and put them in pan last couple of mins. It was VERY good. All family loved it. Will definitely make again. Thanks for recipe!!!

I followed one of the reviews and only cooked the shrimp for 8 minutes, unfortunately they were not done.  My wife does not like mustard and I was hoping, like other reviewers had suggested, that she wouldn't mind it, unfortunately she thought the Dijon mustard was overpowering.  I thought the recipe was ok but not great.  I may try it again at the recommended cook time, with half the mustard, double the garlic, and some old bay.

I rated this recipe a 4 because it was overall a good recipe and very easy to make!  I added quite a bit to spice it up.  In the pan with the butter and other ingredients, I added fresh basil, I cut up some red, orange, and yellow bellpeppers, mushrooms,onion powder, oregeno, cumin, chili powder, more garlic, and 1/2 cup of white wine.  I used thawed large shrimp... and 8-10 minutes was a great time to cook this recipe.  If you cook it over that... the shrimp will be too tough.  This was so yummy with these changes!  It definitely needs some spicing up though.  Thanks for the recipe.  Enjoy!

Very different tasting with the Dijon mustard--not sure if I like it yet, but my husband did, so that's good enough for me.  After baking, I served it on pasta and tossed to coat the pasta with the sauce.

Made the first time according to the directions and it came out really yummy.  Because I served the shrimp over pasta I chose to use all of the butter but think that a little less would have been okay too.  Each subsequent time I have this I have chosen to cook the shrimp in the sauce over the stove instead of baking in the oven.  I only prefer the stove method because it is quicker.

I LOVED this!!! It was so easy and absolutely delicious. I also used only 1/2 of the butter and extra garlic and 1/2 of the dijon and it was fantastic! This is a real winner!! This is why this site is my go to for great recipes! Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious and so EASY to make!  Loved, loved, loved it!  We served it over angel hair pasta.  Can't imagine it over a larger, heavier pasta.  But, of course, that is personal preference.  Served it with steamed asparagus and toasted bread.  Definitely a repeat!

This is excellent & so easy!  I used 1.5 lbs of med. fresh shrimp and added 1/4 - 1/2 cup white wine to thin out the butter sauce. Mine cooked in about 12-15 min. like the author of this recipe called for - I'm sure everyone's ovens are different, so watch carefully. I served this over linguine, delicious!

DELICIOUS! I made this as-is except cut the butter to 1 stick and 1/2 the mustard and it was awesome. My three-year-old ate 6 shrimp and said it was her favorite, and it was a hit with everyone else too. This is a new stand-by.

Made this recipe using 24 oz of frozen large shrimp.  I also sauteed 1 shallot and used 1 1/2 stick of butter and some dry white wine. We both enjoyed it and there wasn't any leftovers.  It was simple to make and will make the recipe again.  Thank you for sharing.  I had rave reviews from my fiance saying this is the best recipe.

I wound up sauteing instead of baking because my oven was full but the overall flavor was very good. I did end up following a others suggestions and used a little less butter and I did use a little less dijon but wish I had used it all for a more flavor. Overall a good recipe and I will use it again.

so easy ! I only had frozen pre-cooked shrimp on hand and it still came out great... I cut the butter to 3/4 what was called for, next time i will only use 1/2 like other folks had suggested.  I also chopped an onion and some mushrooms and sauteed them in the pan that I used for the sauce and added them and some frozen peas before baking. Leftovers reheat nicely (and quickly!)

Excellent !!  I made a few changes (like others, I cut the butter in half, added way more garlic, sprinkled panko over the top and broiled just long enough to lightly brown).  I'll be making this one often !

Made this tonight and  it was great but I changed a few things after reading many reviews.  I used 6 large garlic cloves, fresh juice of one lemon, 2 tablespoons of fresh Italian parsley, a full cup of salted butter per the original recipe, and then used 2 pounds of  21-30 shrimp which are between med and large. I cooked it for 17 min on 425, then sprinkled Italian bread crumbs over the top, then grated Parmesan cheese over the bread crumbs. Returned it to the oven and broiled it for approx 7 min. Yum!! My Italian husband loved it but said next time go easy on the mustard.  We will definitely use this again. Thanks.

I loved this recipe based on how easy and tasty this was! It reminded me of Red Lobster's shrimp scampi. Once the Dijon mustard bakes down it isn't as overpowering as some said. Maybe they used too much or didn't cook it right. My kids even loved it and they are picky eaters. This is a must have easy recipe.

This was delightful. I made it with angel hair pasta, and added a shallot. Since I was using already cooked shrimp, once the butter melted and the pasta was ready, I added the shrimp to the sauce and heated through. Nice, thanks for the recipe!

The best scampi I've ever had, period.  One difference in the recipe is that I only had honey dijon mustard.  I used that instead of regular.  Gourmet.

loved this dish. so easy to make and so delicious i couldnt get enough. my only thing was i actually found that there could have been more butter, or less pasta :/ because my pasta was kind of dry compared to the shrimp. other than that. AMAZING.

I thought this was very tasty. More importantly, my 2 year old loved it (I should give it 5 stars just for that). I added salt and pepper to the shrimp.

I made this for my "in-laws", and they liked it. Very flavorful, I think next time I will use a thinner noodle to make it pop.

Fantastic and simple.  What could be better?  Add a salad or veggie and bread for a meal with pasta, noodles or rice.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I. Followed the recipe exactly... it was really greasy I must say. It was delicious, but too watery and greasy. I'l probably make this again but with less butter (as most people wrote) and bread crumbs. I did add this over pasta which i thought would help with the liquid but it didnt. This recipe was delicious and has alot more potential, needs more flavor. Deff bland, but it can be tweaked

This recipe was just so-so, in my opinion.  We tasted the mustard somewhat, but the rest of the flavors really didn't shine through.  Basically tasted like bland, cooked shrimp.  Will be trying another recipe next time.

This was a really easy, good scampi recipe. I added a little dried oregano to the dish and it was delicious. Am planning on making in for Christmas Eve for a lot of people.

This is our favorite Shrimp Scampi recipe thus far.  It is requested at least once a month in our home, my husband could honestly eat the whole dish to himself!  I follow the recipe, though, in regards to the mustard, I add Dijonnaise instead of the regular Dijon.  I was disappointed to find that it was the only kind I had on hand the first time I made it but it came out even better and makes a very creamy sauce.

This was so simple to make and delicious! I took the advice of other reviews and cut the butter in half. I used 24 oz medium frozen shrimp but other than that I followed the recipe. I served it with linguine and fresh steamed broccoli and it was a huge hit with the hubby!

I halved the recipe because I was using a 1 pound package of colossal shrimp from Trader Joes.  I used unsalted butter which means the sauce needed salt.  I added a pinch of red pepper flakes (which actually wasn't enough) and subbed white wine for the lemon juice.  Next time I may use wine and lemon juice.  Overall it was excellent and disappeared with great raves.  Thanks!

I will never make another scampi recipe again- it's that good! I used fresh NC shrimp. Added a healthy dollop of white wine, and only baked for 8 minutes. The stated cooking time is WAY too long! I basted them once during baking. As for that lovely, delicious sauce, I recommend some crusty bread to soak up every last drop... otherwise, you'll be tempted to lick your plate. Ten stars if I could.

Made this tonight for the family. Used jumbo shrimp and only baked about 10 minutes. As with other reviews, I used a little cooking wine in the sauce as well. Turned out great!! Will make this again and again!

Wish I could give more stars - this was amazingly delicious!  I did use the whole 1 cup of butter, and used a tsp. of dried parsley.  I thawed 2 lbs of frozen shrimp and took the tails off, much easier for my kids to eat.  I served it over wide egg noodles, and was happy to have the extra buttery sauce.  Both my kids literally licked their plates - it was that good.  And so easy to make.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I love shrimp scampi and now I can make my own.  I did add a splash of white wine and left everything as stated in the recipe.  Served over angel hair pasta with the pan fried asparagus.  Red Lobster won't be seeing me  any time soon. Thanks for sharing.

These shrimp were very popular.  I think it was the hint of dijon mustard that made the difference.  Would rate this 5 stars except for the amount of butter you have to use.  But you cannot deny the shrimp taste fabulous.

Awesome dish! Taste just like Red Lobster.. I was very impressed and there were no leftovers! I used yellow mustard and added lemon pepper.. Did not use parsley, didn't even miss it. Half the better is perfect! The smiles on my kids face said it all.. They loved this dish.. No more Red Lobster, for us!!! :-) I still can't believe how easy it was to make! Thanks for sharing!!

I made this dish tonight at the last minute for a quick dinner for me and my husband. It not only was fast to make but very delicious. Now I know how the resturaunts do it! I did leave out some ingredients I did not have on hand like the lemon juice and parsley. I also added some cheese croutons I crumbled up and them sprinkled on top. I can't wait to have the kids try it.  Another great recipie to add to my dinner menu.

Read reviews then decided to just follow the recipe as given.  Met my criteria for 5 stars... easy, quick and tasty.  No doubt folks can modify according to personal preferences...but this worked out great for my family.  Served over fettuccine and broccoli on the side.

I started making this tonight and scrapped the original and made some changes. I used honey mustard instead of dijon, and I used some season salt, oregano instead of Parsley, and some brown sugar. It is MUCH better now!

This recipe is good but very, very boring.  I followed the recipe, followed the suggestions that everyone offered, and it turned out just like shrimp in butter.  I could not taste the mustard at all.  We like shrimp, and we like butter, so we ate it, but it was nothing special.  I honestly can't believe I spent money to make this when it so boring.

I thought this was fantastic. Didn't make much change. As indicated by others, used 1/2 C butter, 1 tblsp mustard. I also added a sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning and right before the shrimp went in the oven, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs (light sprinkling of both). Served over white rice. Really fantastic! Thanks Kimber.

Simple to make, quick to be gone. Wish I had made more for Monday's lunch.  I did use Zataran's Creole Mustard instead of standard Dijon.... added a zing. YUMMY this will be put into rotation.

Used 1/2 the butter but realized it probably would've been best to use the full amount the recipe calls for since i would've liked more "juice" for dipping.  Easy, delicious recipe that I'll definitely use over and over.

Excellent!  Easy to make and since I used pre-cooked frozen shrimp (which I partially thawed) really fast.

As others had suggested, I added a touch of Old Bay and upped the garlic (which I generally do with any recipe). However, I still found this kind of bland and rubbery. Since it wasn't any easier, faster or better than traditional scampi, I doubt I'll make it again.

OMG!  This was fantastic!  I followed some of the other reviews and doubled the parsley and garlic, but kept the other ingredients the same.  I also made two batches, one with cooked diced chicken for my non-shrimp eaters.  On top of angel hair pasta...YUM!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

This was so easy! I bought devined shrimp the 24 to 30 per pound size means less to peel but sooo much better than buying pre-cooked shrimp. I also added 1/2 lemon zest and 1/4 cup of white wine to the butter mixture. As one reviewer had suggested I cut the baking time down to 10 min then, sprinkled panko breadcrumbs and parmesian cheese over the top and broiled for about 4 more min.

My 17 year old son loves the scampi at the big seafood chain.  In trying to save my pocket book from imploding I thought I would try to make it at home.  Being as my son gobbled this up and there was barely any left for anyone else I would call this a bonafide hit.  I added garlic powder and was out of fresh parsley but those were the only changes.  This was quick, easy and goes into our mealtime regular  rotation.  Thanks!!  We served it over pasta

Love this recipe. I used frozen shrimp instead of fresh , kept the butter at 1 cup added more garlic and parsley. Came out great except for 1 error on my part , forgot to peel the shrimp. lol I'm a beginner so I'm not to hard on my self for that. When using frozen shrimp dont forget to peel it.  Cooked it for 20 to 25 for 8 servings.

Believe it or not, I altered this to a slow cooker dip type topping for sliced baguettes! MMMMM.....Fantastic! I used tiny shrimp (salad) and added them after the other items were heated thoroughly in the slow cooker. I added extra shrimp to make more of a "dip consistency". This dish not only pleased the vegetarians of the group, but even picky "non seafood eaters" as well. A great addition to party appetizers!

This was really good!  My husband is not a big shrimp person (or dijon mustard either) but he'll eat them if they're prepared just right.  Well, this must have been just right because he finished the pan.

We loved this!  I modified the recipe as I didn't have time to bake it.  I sauteed the ingredients (minus the pasta) in a saucepan until nice and hot, then added a 16 oz bag of precooked shrimp.  Cooked long enough to heat through then tossed it all with the pasta.  Will definitely make again!

Good base recipe.  I couldn't leave it alone.  I added shallots, mushrooms, and white wine.  I also added some old bay seasoning.  Also added clams in the shell.  Last five min. I topped with Italian bread crumbs and Italian cheese.  Served with a side of Linguini.  Very good.  Son who doesn't even like seafood, ate it all up!

we loved it. since it was just for 2 of us, i cut the entire recipe in half. Made exactly as directed, but had to use dried parsley instead of fresh. Husband HATES mustard of all kinds, but you couldnt tell it was in the dish at all. Used Grey Poupon. Served over angel hair pasta. I will absolutely make this again

This recipes had the best flavor and tang!  The dijon was NOT overwhelming at all.  I cut the butter by half and substituted olive oil for the remainder to make it somewhat healthier. Seven minutes in my oven was perfect for the shrimp. I think next time, I will cut the butter in half again (yes, I will definitely make this dish again!). I served it over whole grain pasta. I plan to sprinkle some chopped roma tomatoes on top and  add some capers. And maybe some sliced black olives! Thank you, Kimber!  This will remain on my list of favorites!

WOW! This was amazing.  However I did make several changes-- enough so that I will add a recipe called Shrimp Scampi Bake II but I just want to give Kimber the credit for the  basis of my new favorite recipe and all the reviewers comments which I combined to make an altered version of my own.  I never would have thought to "bake" a shrimp scampi but it was so easy and quick! For all you saute skeptics -- don't knock it till you try it.

Made this for dinner last night with a few changes. I only had a pound of shrimp and I removed the tails, plus I added some cut up fresh asparagus. I then served it over jasmine rice. It tasted SOOOO good as left overs the next day. My husband loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the use of so much butter. There has to be a healthier way to make this sauce! :)

Made this recipe exactly as printed.  It was "WONDERFUL".  If I were to do anything different, I would add a little more garlic. But, it is absolutely great just as it is!!

This was very tasty & I will make again. I sauteed the garlic in 1/2 cup butter & spices. Next time I'll use even less butter & add broth instead. I also used fresh tomatoes & fresh parsley. I used a tbs. of spicy brown mustard because I was out of Dijon, but this added a great flavor. I also added about 1/2 cup white wine...this took it to an entire new level. Combining & cooking everything in a skillet was much easier. I used multi grain pasta & you couldn't even tell the difference because it was so flavorful. Toss everything together with fresh parmasan. We loved it! Its a must try!

Great for the surf in a surf and turf dinner!  I usually only have the appetite for a few shrimp, but with this recipe I had more than 15!

I thought this was great and very easy to make. I served it with rice and a veggie. I'm sure I will make this again.

Delicious...I doubled the recipe for an office potluck...it is much easier than the scampi recipe I usually make.  I was out of dijon, so subbed a bit of honey mustard.  My co-workers, who have sweet tooths, loved it.  I will use the dijon next time!  thanks for a great dish.

This recipe was delicious. I love Shrimp Scampi and this tasted like one you would get from a restraunt!!! I didn't have mustard though so I didn't have that in the recipe. Also I used I can't believe it's not butter to make it healthier. I also didn't have fresh parsley so i used a pinch of dried parsley insead (note:I made 1 serving). Also I got my shrimp pre cooked so I just heated it up in the pan with other ingredients and it was delisious. I am definatly making this again. 100 Stars!!!

I had high expectations of this recipe based on the reviews, but we were underwhelmed.  If I make it again, I'll cut the amount of butter.

I cut the butter by half only because I was serving with long grain & wild rice; would've kept all the butter if serving with pasta. Very good, like the addition of dijon. Didn't have fresh parsley. Used frozen shrimp, thawed and tails removed. Cut baking time down to 10 minutes. Very good!!

This was my first attempt at cooking shrimp and I could not have used a better recipe.  Even my 4 and 6 year old asked for more!  It was so delicious  and soooo easy. I followed the recipe exactly as it said.

This was the easiest recipe out there. I made it exactly. It turned out fabulous. I paired it with the lemon linguine and great green salad recipes from this site. They all have simliar ingredients and went well together. It's a keep. Oh, and it made a lot!

This was so fast and easy. Would have been super fast if I hadn't had to devein all the shrimp (picky little girls). I didn't have dijon mustard so I used a little regular, and was worried that it wouldn't be good, but it was delicious. My kids gobbled it down and wanted more (next time I will make four pounds for our bunch!)

This bake was really good - I served mined over linguine.  I'd make a few changes for next time - i.e. more lemon juice and spices - but overall, very tasty and easy!  We will be making this again.

This was pretty good. I cut down on the butter and used olive oil instead which seemed to work nicely especially with pasta. I don't like mustard at all but I thought this was great(didn't taste like mustard at all). I used Grey Poupon maybe that's why. Good recipe-Thanks!

This recipe is so easy.  It takes literally no time to make and tastes amazing.  I put in too much lemon juice by accident and added some soy sauce to take away the sour.  It was really really good.  I will put this on the list to make for guests!

I have made this twice now and both times were fabulous.  I used frozen shrimp scampi from Aldi's.  I mixed the dijon mustard and lemon juice then tossed with the frozen shrimp in a shallow baking dish. Then I added sliced zuchinni to the baking dish.  As the shrimp/zuchinni baked I made a box of pasta (garlic/olive oil)on the stove top. Once finished (approx 10 minutes depending on the box of pasta) I added the pasta to the shrimp baking dish and topped with shredded parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs.  I baked again till brown.

LIGHTER VERSION WITH NO BUTTER! Loved the dijon in this recipe. I sauteed some onion and red bell pepper with the garlic and about 2 Tbs. of olive oil. Then I added the shrimp, lemon juice, and parsley. I tossed some rigatoni with about 1 Tbs. olive oil, then added the shrimp mixture. I also only used 1 pound of shrimp. It was sooo delicious and you definitely don't need all the butter! This version I made doesn't have a sauce per se, but it wasn't dry or greasy either.

This recipe was amazing and so easy. I am usually very scared about cooking seafood, cause I don't want to over cook it, but this was great. My four year old son, who is very picky, loved it! Great recipe, it's a keeper.

I really liked this dish. The dijon was not a problem to me. However, I did sprinkle a little extra garlic and parsley blend over the top. Maybe that is why the dijon didn't overpower the flavor.

This is one of the best and makes it so easy since it is baked in the oven. I did reduce the Dijon-style mustard to 1 tablespoon. Added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, and 1/4 cup white wine.  This has already become a regular in our home.

OMG, this was sooo easy and the flavor is fantastic.  I even serve it over pasta.  I bake it because that makes it even easier.

This was good.  I thought it was too salty, but it was good.  I'll just make some minor adjustments next time.  Thanks

This was awesome!  I used 1/2 cup butter and a splash of white wine as other suggested.  I also sprinkled old bay on the shrimp before cooking.  Serve over a thin pasta with parm cheese. Did I say this was awesome?!

Wow this was amazing.  I did not change the ingrediants but I did change the cooking method. I only had 1 lbs of shrimp, so after I mixed the sauce I used half for the shrimp and tossed the rest with 1 box of cooked angel hair pasta also mixing in about a cup of reserved cooking water. It was 80 degrees that night so I poured a little more than half of the remaining sauce over the shrimp and let marinade for 30 min.  I then skwered the shrimp and grilled them basting with the remaining marinade.  Perfect summertime dinner or lunch. I will make again and again and maybe in the fall or winter I will bake in the oven and try that way.

I love this recipe!  The flavors are so good and it is really easy to make.  I add it to freshly cooked pasta (linguini, etc) to make a great meal.  It seems too plain without the pasta and has plenty of sauce to coat the pasta well.  I get rave reviews evertime I make it.

I thought the recipe was good, but it lacked a little zest for us at the dinner table.  I think next time I will reduce the butter as other reviewers suggested and may add a dash of garlic salt along with the garlic.  Other than that I thought it was good, but not the greatest shrimp scampi I have ever had, thus only 4 stars for me.

SO tasty and easy to make, LOVE this recipe. The first time I made this I added a splash of white wine but it is just as good without it if you don't have it handy. Also, I used the full amount of butter with this recipe. The first time I used Imperial butter, but the second time I used real butter. I think the Imperial butter actually gave a better flavor but again it is just as yummy either way. The sauce is great to dip lightly toasted french bread (I just let it crust a little bit in the oven after removing the dish). Don't hesitate to make this dish it is so simple, fast and easy, always gets raves.

This was fantastic.  I halved the recipe and added a splash of white wine to the butter mixture.  Used frozen jumbo shrimp (which I thawed first) and let it cook for 15 minutes which was perfect.  Served over penne with french bread for dipping and husband loved it.  The dijon really adds a nice taste to the dish.  Will definitely make again as this was so quick, easy, and delicious.

I loved how easy this was to make!  I followed the advice of others and cut back a little on the butter.  I used about a half a stick less and I think that was the right amount.  I poured the shrimp and butter sauce over the linguini and garnished it with toasted pine nuts.  We loved it!

I've made this twice, and twice I've loved it! The cooking time is off though. The first time I used 1 1/2 lbs. and cooked them for about 8 minutes and tonight I only made 1/4 lb. and they were done in about 6 mins. Definitely keep an eye on them! Added a bit of white wine to the sauce to add a little more. Delicious!

Maybe my mistake was following the recipe exactly, which I did but adjusted the amount of butter.  I thought this was just okay.  It tasted fine but definitely not a 5-star recipe.  Had I made some modifications like others had and added Old Bay, doubled the garlic, etc. it probably would have been better.  So far as shrimp recipes go, not one of my faves.

This is an incredibly easy, and very very tasty recipe. The only thing I did a touch different, was to apply a very light dusting of crushed cracker crumbs over the top before baking, and added a touch of basil and oregano. Not needed, but it gives it just a little different character :)

So good!  I made this recipe with Frozen shrimp (they were on sale), and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It was great!  I served it with some rotini pasta and asparagus.  I will definitely make this again.

I cut the recipe in half because I only had one pound of shrimp. That being said, I added extra parsley and a small dash of vermouth (very small). My boyfriend really liked it (or at least said he did) but I found it really bland. I won't be making it again.

This has to be one of the easiest most delicious recipes I've ever made. I added 1/2 cup of white wine, and next time I might cut that back to 1/4 cup. Other than that, the mustard was NOT overpowering, and everything else was perfect. I put everything in a ziplock bag to marinade for a few hours, and took it to my boyfriend's mom's house to cook over there. Made for easy and deicious transport. Served over linguine with salad. I'll make this again only try lower fat butter next time just to save on calories.

As I was making dinner for one, me, I followed the recipe but 'eyeballed' the amounts.  I had jumbo shrimp in the freezer which I defrosted. Using 5 shrimp, I used 1 heaping tablespoon of Dijon mustard, fresh lemon juice, approximately 1 tablespoon fresh grated elephant garlic and 3 tablespoons of butter. After I removed the garlic mixture from the stove, I added a splash of white wine. I poured it all over the shrimp and baked at 450 deg. for about 10 or 11 minutes. I sprinkled a little freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the shrimp and served it over a bed of white rice. It was delicious, super easy and super fast (this was a last minute "what should I make for dinner tonight" moment. I would even make this for company!

This was great!!!  I omitted the parsley because I didn't have any and sprinkled some italian seasoning in instead.  I also served over fettucine and served with crusty bread to sop up the juices.  SO yummy!  A great quick meal to serve to company!

I've never liked making shrimp at home - it's so easy to over cook them.  This recipe was easy, and foolproof;  once they are pink/opaque they are done (I found that happened in about 8 mins in my oven).  Even my picky father, a self-proclaimed expert on shrimp scampi, loved this recipe.  I did let them sit in the marinade for a half day - simply put the shrimp in a ziploc bag in the frig and baked later in the afternoon.  A great appetizer instead of shrimp cocktail!

I loved this recipe it was easy and original in taste. I added basil and oregano instead of parsley just because of what I had on hand. I also used bottled lemon juice. This is great and will be going into our regular rotation.

Delicious!  I used half as much butter and still had plenty of sauce.  Threw some chopped asparagus in the pan to bake with it, and served it all on top of linguini.  Was super easy!

Cooked exactly following the recipe cutting in half for two.  Made a side dish of Knorr's butter and herb pasta and used the scampi to top it off.  Hubby raved and said it was as good as any restaurant! Congratulations - will definitely make again!

Made this recipe for lunch and I just couldn't review it fast enough!! It was fantastic! I did make a couple changes.. I left out the lemon juice (because I didn't have any) and added crushed red pepper flakes and I sprinkled the shrimp with old bay before cooking. I also cooked the shrimp in the skillet with the butter mixture. It turned out perfect! I wasn't sure about adding the mustard(because I don't like it) but added it anyway. Very subtle. Thanks for the great recipe! We'll definitely be making this again!!!! Kudos!

OMG!!!!! a GREAT VALENTINE MEAL SERVED FOR THE FAMILY. NO CHANGES HOWEVER I ADDED YELLOW AND RED PEPPER FOR COLOR AS SUGGESTED BY OTHER VIEWER. ALSO SINCE MY TEENAGE SON DOES NOT EAT SEAFOOD I FOUND ANOTHER SCAMPI MEAL USING CHICKEN SUBMITTED BY CYDEE1942 ALSO GOOD. OUR DISH WAS SERVED OVER LINGUINE, CAESAR SALAD AND RED VELVET CUPCAKE BOX MIX.

This was sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly and served with garlic bread and a caesar salad. I did use minced garlic instead of chopped because that's what I had on hand, but I think I would add a little more next time. The mustard adds a bit of a tang that makes this different from regular shrimp scampi.

I'll give this 5 stars. No one will know there's mustard in this. I am the worst when it comes to cooking.. and this came out pretty good. My "Large" shrimp which weren't that big took prob 12 min. I guess you just need to keep an eye on them. I know everyone loves this recipe, but people here like to change things.. I didn't change anything. It impressed my friends.. and this seems kinda elegant if you're cooking for a girl etc.. btw i'm 26 yo dude. Kudos to the recipe author. MAde my nite.. oh also i made a salad w/ Creamy italian II and Toasted garlic bread. plenty of food for 6. you should make this.

This is the best shrimp scampi recipe.  I did add a splash of white wine and I added about 1/4 cup of sauted onion.  I also added about 1/2 tablespoon worcestershire sauce.  Delish!!!!!

Delicious!  I followed the advice of a couple other reviewers and sprinkled the raw shrimp with Old Bay before putting them in the baking dish and added a splash of white wine to the butter mixture.  I used the full amount of butter, because I was serving this over spaghetti noodles and wanted to be sure to have enough to coat the noodles.  I'll definitely make this one again!

This was the first time I had shrimp scampi and it was really good! I even left out the dijon by accidents and it still tasted yummy with all the butter & garlic. (Next time will put mustard in--was crazy night at home when I made this first time) Served over lightly buttered & salted angel hair pasta with cheddar garlic biscuit recipe from this site and it was like being at Red Lobster. Thanks for a great new meal idea.!

I am a shrimp lover - I am serious about my shrimp.  I grew up vacationing in Cape Cod, where the seafood dining is awesome.  I now live in Texas, far from the coast and was disppointed the last time I attempted to stuff myself with shrimp at Red Lobster. This recipe gives me my "shrimp scampi fix". Very easy recipe. I don't mind all the butter, I serve it over pasta for my family - this recipe is worth the calories!

We just finished eating this for dinner...amazing!  Better than any restaurant.  I added salt and pepper, increased the amount of garlic, and used less butter in the sauce.  I then threw some halved grape tomatoes, grated parmesan and bread crumbs as per others reviews before placing all in the oven.  So wonderful over angel hair pasta with a side salad!

Fabulous! Cut the recipe in half as I only had 1 pound of shrimpt. Didn't have lemon juice, used fresh squeezed oj. Doubled the garlic, sprinkled with parmesan and panko bread crumbs. Easy and delicious. Loved the mustard taste!

This is great - the best allrecipes.com dish I've made so far: it's very easy to make and is delicious.  The Dijon gives it a subtle "kick".  Some very slight changes: I used 2.5lbs COOKED shrimp and scaled all other ingredients to 1.5x what recipe calls for.  Also kept in oven for a few minutes longer than recipe calls for.  I served over rice -- everyone loved it!

Wow, this recipe was great.  I added pasta and veggies to the shrimp and butter mixture.  Put it all in the pan added a few bread crumbs (for a little crunch) then baked it all together for about 9 minutes.  It was so good I don't think I'll be able to get enough.

This was good. I think the lemon was a little too much. Next time will reduce.

Made as is I think this is a 4 star recipe, with a few enhancements it's definitely a 5.  I've made this a few times now and the first time I followed the directions as is.  The meal was very good, but it seemed a bit bland to me so I read some other reviews and added some Old Bay Seasoning, diced tomatoes, and doubled the garlic (I love the stuff).  Contrary to other reviews I don't think a cup of butter is too much. 

To top it off I liberally sprinkled Panko bread crumbs and Parmesan cheeze on top.  Served over linguini with a side of Italian bread and Caesar salad it was delicious.

I love this recipe.  I love what the mustard adds to the dish and I love that you can't taste the mustard.  

The cook time is way off hence the four stars.

I made this as a side for Christmas Dinner.  Served with prime rib.  I skewered the shrimps and poured the sauce over them and baked as per instructions.  Made a wonderful side dish to my meal.  (Prime Rib) I'm only giving it 4 stars because they weren't out of this world mind blowing for me.  I think next time I will try spicy mustard.  Overall a good recipe.

Fast, easy, yummy! I doubled the sauce and used the 2lb (frozen) shrimp on the baking sheet so when they thawed, they added liquid to the sauce. They were perfection at 12-15 min baking time indicated in recipe. Topped one 8oz box of cooked ridged spaghetti and 10oz bag broccoli with this scampi and it made a nice meal! Thank you!

Made a great dinner for my sister & mom on a recent visit. Like others I used half the butter and had plenty of sauce. Served over pasta with an italian salad and garlic bread on the side.

Excellent! I let the butter mixture and the raw shrimp marinate for about 2 hours in the fridge. When I took it out the butter was solid on top but I popped it in the oven anyway and the shrimps turned out perfect!

This recipe was amazing and so simple!  My husband couldn't beleive how good it was.  I did half the butter the first time I made this, as several reviews suggested, and there was plenty left over.  So, the second time I made it, I used even less (maybe three tablespoons) and added a little extra mustard.  It was awesome!  So easy, I'll definitely be making this again!

Super easy and delicious recipe! My husband suddenly said he was coming home for dinner so I had to go thru my freezer to see what I had! Found some shrimps so decided to try out this recipe. Like others, I also added some white wine in. Instead of butter, I used olive oil. I didn't cook the marinate beforehand, instead, I just mixed it all together and pour it into the shrimps. I used frozen shrimps obviously and added some chili powder, topped it up with gluten free bread crumb. Half of the dish was sprinkled with cheese (for my husband) and mine half was as it was. It was great! The juice tasted fantastic and no wonder everyone said it's great for a pasta dish! Will make it again with pasta. It really took no time and no effort at all. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love shrimp so I wanted to give this one a try. I made a few adjustments and the family had more than we could eat, and thats a good thing. The meal turned out great. I used what is known salad shrimp 8oz. pkgs. no tails to mess with, I served it over pasta with a salad and parmesian garlic bread.

This is "the Best".  What an easy way to have a wonderful meal.  I recalculated this to 3 servings, which uses 1 lb. of shrimp and is plenty for just the two of us. Wouldn't hesitate to fix this for guests.  We love it with grilled asparagus and a salad.

This is a favorite in our house.  So easy to make! I usually check the shrimp while they are in the oven and take them out as soon as they are pink.  While I am plating dinner they finish cooking and are perfect on top of angel hair! Don't forget lots of bread for sopping!  Thanks.

I loved this recipe and I don't even LIKE seafood! This is great for anyone trying to incorporate seafood into their diet without eating things that taste "fishy". I'm a graduate student with two jobs, but this is easy and quick enough for a weeknight dinner. I just cooked some pasta and drizzled the shrimp and sauce over it...perfect!

My hubby thought this was the best thing ever.  I added some more spices, but only as a personal preference.  It was wonderful as is.

*UPDATE*  
I used the same base but instead of shrimp, I used fish (talapia).  Was so good there wasn't left overs.

I made it and served over pasta. Everyone liked the sauce so much they had me make just the sauce for pasta a few days later! I added some parm cheese on top and a bit more fresh garlic because we really like garlic. I also made it once with dried parsley--I rub it in the palm of my hand to bring out the flavor and it was still yummy--but the fresh is better when you can get good fresh.

I put asparagus spears on top of the shrimp pouring the butter over both.  Turned out perfect, served it over penne pasta. You really should make sure to use large shrimp so they are not over cooked.

I loved this recipe!

This recipe was SOOO quick but tasted SOOO good!  I used frozen shrimp (thawed and drained first), *slightly* less Dijon, a little more garlic (1 clove for each serving), and a splash (1/3 to 1/2 cup) white wine.  Keep an eye on the cook time though, my shrimp were done around 8 - 10 minutes.
This recipe is definitely a keeper for busy weeknights, or even for company!  Thanks, Kimber!

We served this over a bed of thin spaghetti and it was delicious, even though we started with frozen shrimp, not fully defrosted (cooked about 16 minutes...hey, we were hungry!)  Definitely echo the "cut the butter in half" comments.

We really enjoyed this with minor changes.  Used only 1-2 tsp of deli mustard.    Added a little more lemon. Next time will use less butter....Overall great flavor

This is so good!! Used frozen raw peeled & deveined shrimp 31-40 ct. But why would you want to leave the tails attached, there is nothing sexy about putting a shrimp in your mouth with a fork and having to pull the tail away with your fingers. I removed the tails before cooking, followed the recipe exactly except for the fresh parsley. I probably used 4 times the parsley. Oven time was about 10 min. Made penne pasta for the 6 servings, mixed together and added some grating cheese and a little more fresh parsley. Served with some french bread and a glass of wine. Honey & I were very happy.

The sauce was a little runny for my taste. I don't know how to thicken it up (a little cornstarch maybe?)I followed reviews of other people and only cooked mine for 7 minutes and it still would have tasted good with 6 or maybe even 5. I also added a little more lemon. Good!

I made this for the first time last night. It is very easy to put together. I used frozen cooked, detailed, de-veined shrimp. I also added dry basil and some pepper and cayenne pepper. I let the shrimp marinate for several hours before baking it. It was DELISH!!! We ate it singly without any pasta to cut down the carbs/fat since this is fattening enough on it's own. Definately will make it again!

So delicious...I followed the recipe exactly how it was EXCEPT I used basil instead of Parsley because that is what I had on hand.....My first time making this dish and it was awesome...the whole family enjoyed it...even my 4 year old!

Wonderful and easy- had to substitute dried parsley for fresh.  Subtle flavor in the shrimp.  Probably not too healthy.

I'm not sure why, but I really didn't like this very much...it was kind of bland and greasy.  My husband and daughter, however, loved it.  I was looking for something a little lighter and more flavorful.

Really liked it. I didn't think I would but I've been trying to expand my menu and was really impressed. In addition to ingredients, I added about 1 cup of asparagus, left out 1/2 of the shrimp and served over noodles. Used frozen shrimp (thawed).

The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because it had way too much butter. Made it with only 4 tablespoons and it was perfect!

Phenomenal! Halved the butter, halved the mustard, doubled the garlic and lemon, added sliced mushrooms, sliced asparagus, diced tomatoes, red pepper flakes and some parmesan cheese for 10 minutes, then tossed a little breadcrumbs and some french bread for 2 more minutes.  EASY and perfect!

This was just okay.  I added more garlic and cheese as one member suggested and mushrooms. I feel it could have been more flavorful. Nothing special.

This one was a hit at my house.  I made it twice.  The first time I only had a small amount of shrimp I needed to use up so I made a small amount and baked them in custard cups.  It made nice size appetizers.  I thought the mustard flavor was a little to forefront so I used only half the mustard the second time.  I doubled the sauce and served them over linguine. I could not believe how fast it went.

So good and easy.  My son said this was his favorite meal.  I used more garlic and still thought it needed more yet.  I poured this over 8 oz of angel hair pasta.  It was excellent. Will be making again next week at my husband's request.

Excellent recipe.  Added extra garlic as we love that garlic taste.  DH and son loved it so much asked me to make again.  I have made it several times since and still get rave reviews every time.

Wow, this was soooo easy and soooo good. My picky kids loved it.  Only change was to add one extra tbsp. lemon juice and the the crushed red peppers to my husband's and mine only.  Fabulous.

This was FAB.  I had no idea scampi could be so easy!  I made it as directed (though I tossed in a healthy shake of Cayenne and used extra garlic 'cause I love it so) and have to admit I was a little concerned when I sampled the sauce prior to baking.  It tasted very lemony to me but when it came out it was perfect.  Poured the whole lot of it over some pasta and served with a salad and warm, crusty rolls.  We polished off every bit of it and sopped up all the extra juice with the bread.  Will DEFINITELY make this super-easy dinner again.

Very quick and easy and a crowd pleaser. I served over angel hair. Next time I will add more garlic and maybe a little red pepper but more than tasty as is.

Loved it!!! Will probably add a little more garlic next time. I only had spicy brown mustard so I used it instead of dijon. Would be great over some pasta.

WOW, this is so good! I only used 1 lb. of shrimp, but made all of the sauce.  It was perfect!  I served it over thin, whole wheat spaghetti. Delicious, family loved it!

This was great! QUICK AND EASY! I made this as part of surf and turf with a side of angel hair pasta with lemon zest garlic and parsley. The pasta is delicious and flavorful alone but we added some of the sauce from the scampi and it was even better. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a quick delicious meal (tossed with angel hair pasta)! 

B.T.W I added more lemon juice than recommended because I love the tartness with seafood and about a tsp of red pepper flakes. ENJOY!!

This was an excellent recipe that my whole family (kids included) loved. I used all the butter, but then tossed the shrimp and sauce with 1lb. of angel hair pasta and some lightly steamed broccoli and cauliflower, for a whole meal in one dish. I also used fresh cilantro instead of the parsley - delish!

Very good recipe -- the in law's loved it. Maybe let the shrimp soak in the sauces for a little bit longer and try not to overcook it. Ours turned out a little rubbery because we slightly overcooked it but everybody still loved it. Will keep this recipe on hand to cook again.

Great recipe..The garlic was not overpowering. Use good quality butter and don't scimp on the parsley. My duaghters who always eat Scampi and Red lobster like this much better..Even in Kansas City, we can have something other than Barbque..

Couldn't be easier to create this fabulous dish.  Scampi is my favorite seafood and now that I know how simple it is to make, I will be having it often. Next time I will add more garlic (I can't get enough garlic).  I served it over rice, so good! Had the leftovers next day and it was even better.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, just scaled it down a bit. I did not melt the butter and other ingredients in a sauce pan on the stove, just put it right in dish I was going to cook the shrimp in and let it sit in my oven while it was preheating, until it was melted. Then I took it out, mixed it up and stirred in the shrimp. This saved a step and worked just as well. The dijon was the key ingredient in my opinion!

This was so easy, the dijion gave a nice flavor. I used a whole cup of butter (light) to make sure a whole 8oz. box of linguine would be covered, and fresh parsley & garlic.

I am not a huge shrimp fan, but my family is. They loved this quick recipe. I probably tripled the amount of garlic and lemon juice in the sauce and served it over bow tie pasta with an equal amount of broccoli and baby carrots that I cut lengthwise. I also sprinkled the finished product with Parmesan cheese. The smell of dijon mustard was pretty strong while it was cooking, but was surprisingly mild in the finished product. I will definately make this recipe again. And I almost always have the ingredients on hand.

My husband & I tried this recipe for the first time tonight.....outstanding & so easy.  I was nervous about adding the dijon mustard but was surprised it was actually very, very mild. I will reduce the butter to 1/2 - 3/4 cup next time.

I gave this recipe three stars.  My wife and I thought the taste was very plain, and way too buttery.  I barely tasted the dijon, either.  I guess we were expecting the shrimp to have a little more "pop" to their flavor.

Next time, I'll follow the advice of other reviewers and cut the amount of butter in half, and I may add a little more dijon as well.

This was a hit at our holiday party!  I omitted the mustard because my husband doesn't like it, it was still great.

I first made this with cooked shrimp (it was all I had) and it didn't work out at all.  But today I got some cheap raw shrimp at Wal Mart and it turned out amazing.  A lot better than with the cooked shrimp.  

I didn't have any mustard so I skipped that, but me and my BF both really liked it.  It was just like Red Lobster.  I think people who are commenting saying it didn't work aren't using the right shrimp or something.  

Thanks for posting this, I've been looking for a good Shrimp Scampi for a long time.

I only added half the butter and it was more than enough!  We had lots to go around.  Definately good with rice and green beans or brocolli.  Very good with that extra kick from the dijon.

This was a wonderful, fast dinner.  I followed the instructions almost exactly but i used 5 cloves of garlic. I used the extra butter the make chicken strips in a seperate pan for my toddler (who i thought wouldnt like the shrimp) then i served it over angel hair pasta.  The sauce stuck rather nice to the meat but when i poured it over the noodles it could have used more flavor thats the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars. But it was so good and so quick to make. When it came down to eat I made my toddler a plate, who has become a very very picky eater, I gave him the pasta and chicken he ate every bite then came and sat in my lap and ate ALL my shrimp he got so full.

This was good but not really up to par with sauteed shrimp scampi. Will use this when in a time crunch but otherwise will go for the little bit of extra work for the real, better thing.

This was an awesome base recipe.  I completely peeled the shrimp, used half the butter, added 5 cloves of garlic, a couple of splashes of white wine, and jalepeno mustard.  I served it over a 1/2 pound of fettuccini and sprinkled it with parmesan cheese.  It was terrific.

I made this dish last night and it was sooooooo.... delicious. My husband and kids loved it. I did alter some things though, I didn't use the dijon mustard for one and I added some wine and served it over rice. I'm not big on measuring I'm an eye person so I probably didn't use the recommended servings of ingredients. But thanks for the post it was delicious.

Brought this to a potluck and everyone liked it, however it is definately not the best scampi I've ever had, but I will make it again.  Probably will use more garlic.

Overall, this was really good. I have to give it 5 stars for ease of preparation. 
We used pre-cooked medium shrimp, removed the tails and heated the shrimp with the sauce for about 7 minutes. Served over rice. Will definitely be making this again!

This was sooo good. Just like at a restaurant.  I omitted the mustard because my husband hates it and it still was so good. Boiled up some spaghetti and served it on top!  Makes a lot of shrimp.  My husband and 15 year old son usually eat everything and there was enough left over for me to have for lunch tomorrow.

I tried this recipe for the first time on a recent family vacation to the Outer Banks, NC. I picked up fresh shrimp at a local fish market and whipped this up for dinner. It was simple to make and turned out great.  I received rave reviews from everyone! I will definitely make this again!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  For our family of half seafood lovers and half not, I made the butter mixture as the recipe directed and then halved it between 2 8-inch square pans.  I put half the suggested amount of shrimp in 1 and 2 chicken breasts cut into small pieces in the other.  I added some chicken grill seasoning to the chicken batch and baked them together as the recipe directed.  They turned out great and everyone was happy.

This was delicious.  On the advice of others I only used 1/2 cup of butter.  I'm glad I did.  There was plenty left for dipping the french bread.  I served it over angel hair.  This was so simple and yet tasted better than Red Lobster's shrimp scampi.  I will definitely be making ths again.

The was the easiest and tastiest recipe. I did reduce the butter to 3/4 cup and it still had sufficient butter  but not a lot left floating in the bottom of the pan.  I served it with left over rice warmed with chicken broth. Everyone then used the garlic butter to drizzle over their rice. This meal was a hit with everyone at the table.

Really good! I followed the recipe exactly for 4 users and served it over pasta noodles. The Dijon does give it a little something, if i hadn't have cooked it I wouldn't have known that mustard was in there. I will try to use olive oil in place of the butter next time though, because my husband got pretty disgusted at the end of eating when he saw all the butter at the bottom of his bowl.

This is delicious. We follow the recipe almost exact but cut down on the butter a tad so it sticks a little more to the shrimp. Delicious! Thanks!

Great flavor. I did cut back the butter a little and it was still delicious. I tossed it in a bowl with pasta and sprinkled on parmesan cheese. I will make this one again.

I fixed the recipe with only one minor adjustment.  I added in some cayenne pepper for some heat.  Everyone Loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly as written because I knew I'd want all the butter for the pasta I served with it.  For one pound of linguini  this recipe is perfect.  I had 8 people over and everyone of them loved it.  It was so fast and easy to prepare, I will be using it again and again!

This recipe is the reason I got addicted to allrecipes.com.  Wow!  Light it's not, but as a special treat, there's nothing better.  In fact, this compares favorably to my favorite scampi at a local restaurant.

This was very good.  I used raw, frozen shrimp and it turned out tasty!  I could not believe that there was dijon-style mustard in here!  Served over fettucine with alfredo sauce, an old classic!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this today to go with a salad and it was quite good. I think I put a bit too much lemon juice. I like my dishes tangy so I figured, why not more? But then it turned out too sour. Will try again though, shrimps are always good.

I'm 29 years old and seafood never appealed to me until I was served some shrimp scampi at a party and of course had to eat it-but it was good!  SO i tried this recipe as an extreme novice in the shrimp dept and I loved it...so did my husband.  We served it over linguine.  According to him everything was perfect.  Although i did cook for a little less time as per many reviews. Thanks for a great quick recipe :D

Made this the other night, like others I tweaked it a bit.  I used 2 lbs of shrimp but only 1 cup of butter with 1/2 cup of wine.  I added several tbs of parmesan as well and served over angel hair pasta.  Everyone liked it a lot!!

This was very good, and did not taste like mustard at all.  I put butter mixture in baking dish with frozen cocktail shrimp, and put baking pan on grill rack, and grilled for 8-10 minutes. It was tasty and easy!

I did as some others suggested by adding red pepper flake and parmesan cheese. I served it over egg noodles. The flavor was pretty good, didn't really taste the dijon at all. I gave it three stars b/c the sauce was too thin. I wish it would have been thicker so it'd stuck to the shrimp and pasta better. So I wouldn't really call it a true shrimp scampi. I will probably try again but will tweak it more.

This shrimp was very yummy! I think it's the dijon that makes the difference. I paired it with To Die For Fettuccine Alfredo I found on this site. Oh so good!!!

I don't know what happened, but I thought this tasted like nothing.  I even doubled the garlic and lemon and added crushed red pepper and dried basil and it still had no flavor.  I cut down on the butter and there was still a pool at the bottom of my bowl when I was done.  I'll stick with my other shrimp recipes!

This was really good. I grated parmesan cheese over the top and served over angel hair pasta. I will definitely make again, but will probably add some red pepper to give it a little more flavor next time.

This was very good. I used basil and added some Mrs. Dash.  Would be good with some hot pepper flakes (I didn't- have 2 kids)  Served with linguine and fresh parmesan.

I felt it needed a little salt after it was all said and done and you have to eat this with some type of pasta. We had it with angel hair pasta. Also...I have no idea why everyone is commenting on the amount of butter. Scampi is supposed to be drenched in butter. We felt it actually could have used just a bit more! Of course we're from the south so the more butter the better.

I enjoyed this dish even though I don't particularly care for any kind of seafood.  It was very easy to prepare and did have a nice flavor.  My husband who is a fish/seafood lover thought it was very good.  I'll probably make it again.

This was pretty good - my husband liked it.  I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" instead of real butter so maybe that's why I didn't give it a 5 star.  I also omitted the lemon and used basil instead of parsley.  I would make it again - full leaded!

I seem to be having no luck lately but we just did not think that the sauce absorbed in the shrimp very well.  Was disappointed in the lack of flavor.  Sorry

I added this, minus most of the left over buttery sauce, to fresh angel hair pasta and the creamy sauce from: "Shrimp and Mushroom Linguini with Creamy Cheese Herb Sauce". This is a heart attack on a plate...but SO delicious. Everyone asks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner last night and it was amazing!!  Very high fat content (one whole pound of butter!!) but the best recipes always are.  The only thing I would do different next time is add more garlic, but I love garlic, so for most people, the amount called for is probably enough.

Great dish for one so easy. I made it just as the recipe called for (with the addition of mushrooms) and it was very good over penne pasta.  The family was happy and said they'd like it again. Next time I'll replace some of the butter with white wine as some have suggested.

I'm from Maine, and I brought 5lb's of Maine shrimp back to Colorado with me.  I made this for valentines day, along with steamed lobster for my boyfriend.  We absolutely loved it!  I'm semi allergic to shrimp, and I made it again :)  It's simple, fast, and looks like something you would have at a quality restaurant.  You can even serve it more as a side dish over couscous!!

What makes this recipe different from other shrimp scampi recipes is the mustard and yes, use Dijon.  I will never make a regular scampi again, this has a very unique flavor.

Couldn't be easier! Like others, I reduced the butter and increased the garlic. I forgot to buy lemon but I added some white wine and it was fine though the lemon would have been even better. I ate it over a bowl of brown rice for lunch and was very happy.

This was really good! Next time I'll use less butter though. It was just a pool in the bottom. I coated the shrimp with bread crumbs to make it stick, but I used the same amount of mustard because I like it. Very tasty

My boyfriend loved this. Hes picky and will eat whatever i make, but not always enjoy it. He said this one really tasted BETTER than Red Lobster! I put in 2/3 of the butter and more garlic. Less mustard is better. I made this again and it was a little too dijon-y.

Quick, easy, tasty - who could ask for more?  I substituted Smart Balance for the butter and it tasted as good as it could under the circumstances. Served over angel hair - we ate it up!

I love this recipe and would give it 5 stars but my family dislikes it so I must take their opinion into my rating. I think the flavor is too strong for them.

It was good.  It just wasn't what I was looking for.  I was looking for something that was closer to how Red Lobster scampi tastes, and this recipe isn't it.  It was tasty, but I won't make it again.

I'm not a big scampi fan, but my husband is.  I made this dish especially for him, and he loved it.  He said it was as good as the scampi from the chain seafood restaurant he once worked at.

I love the sauce. The mustard gave it a nice flavor. I served it over rice. It was really good on the rice. I gave it 4 stars because my shrimp was a little tough. Next time I will boil the shrimp instead of baking it.

This was ok.  I would definitely decrease the amount of butter next time.  I only put in a half of a cup originally but I was serving it over pasta so I put in another half of a stick of butter, way too much.

I think this was overall a good recipe. I generally cook seafood to take to parties or to serve at parties. I only experimented with this one - trying to tint the shrimp pink for a baby shower. The color worked well, but I think it turned me off to the shrimp itself so I believe it was my fault that I didn't enjoy my "pink" shrimp (so my pink shrimp rates 4 stars) but this is a good recipe. I will try it again without the food coloring as I love shrimp.

Not your traditional Shrimp Scampi, but very good.  I made this for my husband and in-laws.  Everyone loved it. Even my husband, who does not eat any type of seafood, like it and went back for seconds.

This was okay, but I agree with others that the dijon was too much. I usually like mustard, but this combination did not seem quite right. I will be looking for a better shrimp scampi recipe.

Well this dish was only *ok* in our books.  On the plus side, it went together very quickly and cooked quickly, so dinner was on the table with minimal time and effort.  On the minus side, the butter sauce just didn't have enough time to penetrate the shrimp, so we didn't find that we got a lot of the good, buttery flavour we wanted.  The sauce was VERY good though, I will use it on other things in the future.

I thought the first bite was good and interesting, but after that, the dijon flavor started getting to me.  I could do without the dijon, it wasn't to my taste.

My husband and I both loved this recipe and rated it as a do-over.  I will probably use a little less butter next time and add a little parmesan on the top with the broiler.  But overall experience was a plus!  Thanks!

This was fabulous! Easy and yummy! I have tried to make shrimp scampi before but it never had this much flavor.  I did increase the amount of garlic to about 3 cloves instead of 1 clove.  My whole family loved it - my kids couldn't stop eating it!

Prepared this recipe as provided, except I used previously frozen shrimp. My husband LOVED it and said it was the best scampi he has ever had. This will definitely be one recipe that I'll prepare again, perhaps for a small dinner party as well. So easy and good!

Very good!  A little buttery & the garlic was a bit overpowering.  Good flavor though.  VERY easy to make.  The hardest part was shelling the shrimp.

Excellent and so easy!!  We actually made this on a week night!  The mustard was fine as written, however, I would cut back the butter next time.  Even over pasta, it was a little too greasy for my family.  Shrimp came out perfectly tender.

This recipe is great!  And so very easy.  I replaced some of the butter with olive oil as some of the other users had done.  Added a little extra garlic and lemon juice for my family's taste and tossed with penne pasta.  This is wonderful...I'm sure this'll be a family favorite for years to come.

This is my new favorite recipe for a quick and easy and most importantly DELICIOUS supper. I added an extra tablespoon of dijon for a little more kick. Great over pasta too!

I made this recipe as written and served over noodles.  I really didn't care for it.  It was okay but not outstanding.  I will not make again.

I just made this recipe today and it was FANTASTIC!  I doubled the sauce and added some extra garlic as I was serving it with pasta.  My boyfriend loved it too and thankfully he didn't notice when I served myself a little more the second time around!

Fantastic shrimp scampi!  I sauteed some diced onions along with the other ingredients. Other recipes for shrimp scampi are a let-down compared to this.  Thanks for sharing it!

Divine! I halved all but the garlic and lemon juice and used fresh raw shrimp.  Next time I'll add a dash of white wine - just a personal scampi preference.  This was delicious - thanks.

This was fantastic!  Had tried a couple of other shrimp scampi recipes but none compared to this!  Used Jack Daniels HONEY dijon mustard which I think the honey helped subdue the mustard a tad.  Used jumbo prawns which made it even better we thought!

This recipe was very easy to make. I bought the already cleaned shrimp from super market. So it saved me a little time. Mix them together and places in the oven for about 8-10 min. perfect. Does need a little salt & pepper. Served over pasta.

I used large frozen shrimp directly from the freezer. This was good but I think because I cooked them frozen there was more liquid in the final result and the taste didn't have the kick I was expecting. I'll try again with the raw shrimp.

This was so tasty! The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was that it was kind of odd to eat something so oily, but that's just the way scami is I guess.

This was a WONDERFUL and EASY recipe.  I scaled it down to three servings, which called for 1/2c of butter.  That would not have been enough.  1c was just perfect.  Also, if you're using fresh water shrimp/prawns, you might want to use a little bit of salt.  Other than that, it was GREAT!

This was sooo good!  I didn't have everything the recipe called for - I used lime juice instead of lemon, didn't have parsley so used 1 tsp dried cilantro and added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes.  Even my not-thrilled-with-shrimp husband liked this.  Thanks!

I needed something quick to fix and this seafood dish was an excellent choice to make.  I prepared the scampi using all the ingredients except the parsley, which I did not have on hand. The meal was excellent and made a very large amount.  I was able to purchase a 2 lb. bag of shrimp with the tails on in the seafood market at my grocery store, which I much preferred over buying it from the frozen dept.  The convenience and excellent taste made this a recipe a favorite at our home.  I also cook for another family and this will provide them a gourmet style meal at a low price.

This is a great recipe - I add some white wine (we like extra "juice" for our rice!)and also some Worcestershire Sauce, along with some Tabasco. I saw someone added cayenne - I think that's a great idea. Sometimes I sprinkle breadcrumbs on top. Do watch the cooking time!
