Wow, what a total waste of expensive ingredients!  I made this recipe today, following the directions exactly, and these 'cake mix bars' turned out very dry and tasteless. 
Also, the uncooked mixture was very, very thick and sticky, and it was a chore to spread it into the 9 X 13 baking pan.  I finally had to grease a stirring spoon and smooth the mixture into the pan.  

I can only warn others to not waste their time & energy (and costly ingredients) making something that no one in their right mind would eat!

Taste was fine. What was the other poster considering expensive ingredients??? These are items that are always in my pantry and I don't consider them expensive at all.

The flavor was there but these were too dry. Cooking time shortened with more apple sauce may do the trick.

I I love the subtle taste of spice combined with the choclate.  The mix will be sticky but it is supposed to be like a brownie batter.  tried this recipe for church supper and it was a hit!
