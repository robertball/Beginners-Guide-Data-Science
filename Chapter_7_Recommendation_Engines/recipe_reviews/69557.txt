This is a very simple, delicious recipe. I used chopped chicken, and  browned it along with two green peppers. I'm not a huge fan of a vinegar taste, so I only used one Tb if cider vinegar instead of two. When  I sprinkled on the ginger, I was sure not to let it directly hit any of the pineapple, otherwise there was too strong of a ginger taste. Served it over white rice--quick, easy, and tasty!

This recipe is AWESOME!!! I totally loved it. Had to make it a little lower in sugar and sodium because of diet so replaced brown sugar with splenda and used lite teryaki sauce instead of soy and used a little bit less than called for but it was still AWESOME. Cut the chicken up into bite size chunks and cooked with chopped onions, and chunks of bell peppers and shredded carrots. Loved it!!! I only gave it a 4 because of husband .. who said it needed to be a little spicier .. he added crushed red pepper flakes.

This was a good dish.  I changed some things though.  Added fresh ginger and doubled the amt needed.  Fried the chicken instead of grilling or broiling.  We don't have a BBQ and it is too hot out to use the oven.  We could have used more sauce... so you might want to up the ingredients a bit.  Overall a good dish, but if you're looking for something spectacular try the Tomato Curry Chicken.  That's a keeper!

Pretty good! I cut the  vinegar in half and will do that again next time. We served it over rice and had Steamed baby carrots and brocoli as a side. Next time I may throw in some bell pepper while its cooking.

I found the taste to be way overpowering.    Seems it needed something else.  I would not recommend this recipe.

I would make less sauce though. It's so tangy that you can't use too much.

This was great!  I cut up the chicken breasts, stirred them in with the sauce and served it over rice.  It was wonderful!

This was very good, but I'll probably leave out the ginger next time b/c the taste was overpowering.

The sauce was too overpowering with the vinegar. I really didn't like this recipe and wouldn't reccomend it.

The first time I made this I accidentally used soya sauce and it turned the sauce an ugly dark brown colour, but that was my mistake and I now make this recipe every time I need something quick, easy and delicious! I add peppers and onions and chop the chicken into cubes. Not as healthy maybe, but faster.
