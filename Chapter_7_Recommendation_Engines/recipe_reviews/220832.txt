I made 2 different stuffed morel's last night and these were a bigger hit. I did make 1 changes but only because I got the 2 recipes mixed up while in the kitchen. Chopped red bell pepper accidentally found its way into this recipe but as it turns out, it worked nicely in this one too. My mushrooms were very small and I wasn't able to stuff a whole lot in them so I took the leftover stuffing and baked it separately adding some parm on the top to get a nice dark crust. The one thing the other recipe had going for it was that it used real crab instead of the imitation. My thoughts are that if you are only going to get this delicate treat once  a year then you should really go all out and use real crab but that is just my opinion. If I happen to find anymore this season I will most definitely make this recipe again and if not...there is always next Spring. Thanks for the great recipe!
