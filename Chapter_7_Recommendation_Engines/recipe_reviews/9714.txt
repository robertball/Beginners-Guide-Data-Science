I changed this recipe quite a bit. I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts.
After reading the reviews, I decided not to drizzle the caramel over the brownies after they were baked instead I swirled it in with a knife along w/ the nuts before baking.They turned out wonderfully.

I love this recipe because turtles are my favorite candy. I also found the caramels hardened too much on top, so I added butter continuously while melting the caramel until it remained soft on my stir spoon after cooling. That fixed the problem and these brownies never stay in the house more than one day.

These are good, but just a touch too dry for my families taste.  Ice cream over it solves that however.  ;)  Also, just a tip for people who are new to cooking, cream the sugar and butter first before adding the cocoa and such.  Otherwise you just work too hard getting the butter to fully blend.

This brownies came out deliciously!  I read the other reviews mentioning dryness and combated that by mixing 3/4 c cocoa powder with a few tablespoons of butter and about 1/4 c boiling water.  I added this mixture to the batter after the vanilla and before the flour.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans and caramel icecream topping instead of caramel candy.  I drizzled it over the brownies half way through baking and they came out beautifully.

I would have to say this is a good recipe but the other reviews are right, a little too dry. I also listened to one of the other reviews who said to add the caramel and nuts before cooking and that was a great idea, the only problem was I added the nuts to the caramel then tried to pour it in the brownie and it came out in clumps and I had to brake it up.If you add the caramel before you cook it be sure to add it seperate from the nuts so it doesnt become one big clump :-)

This was only OK.  I prepared the caramels exactly as instructed and they hardened too much on the top of the brownies.  They were difficult to cut and the caramel was hard to chew.  The brownies were OK but I wouldn't make them again.

Everybody loved these brownies. The caramel was a bit difficult to spread on, but I didn't have a problem with how it set up. The hardness is just like turtle candies. And the brownie part is really rich and dark. Yum.

These were a little dry but my husband solved that matter.  He drank lots of milk and seemed to get them all down.  With a little help from me.  :-)))

5 stars because the brownies are DELICIOUS, BUT they are exceptionally fattening. Also, I would recommend adding the caramel before you bake it. Put the batter in the pan and drizzle the caramel on top and then use a knife to swirl it in. I would also prefer the nuts be added to the batter mixture instead of adding them on top. Otherwise, it's a fantastic recipe. If you are watching your weight, I wouldn't recommend making these very often. Try a less fattening recipe.

I made a couple of changes that may be helpful to some.  After reading the many reviews concerning the dry brownies, I added a couple of dollups of sour cream to my mixture.  The brownies came out moist...with a bit more of a "cake" consistency than the original recipe likely does.  I also had some caramel topping for ice cream that I used instead of melting caramels. I added the caramel and walnuts after the brownies came out of the oven.  Turned out nicely.    They were delicious warm....can't wait to taste once cooled.

So these were good tasting but I didn't like how the carmel and nuts came off when you cut them and ate them. Very messy! Would prefer to put the nuts into the mix and maybe swirl the carmel in??Then press the pecan halves on top. Not sure I will try them again, sorry.

I followed directions exactly except I followed most of the others and added the nuts and caramel before baking.  I also baked for an additional 7 mins.  It just did not seem like it was done at 25.  I really disliked this LOL.  I love to bake.  Ive baked something at least 10 times a year for the past 10 years and this may be the 2nd time ever I have made brownies.  After making them, I realized that I rarely eat brownies and this recipe made me remember why.  Heavy and really rich.  I just dont like the consistancy of brownies.  BUT if you love brownies - THIS IS PERFECT!  I LOVE baked goods and am a dessert and sugar freak.  I could only eat 1 small piece of this.  I did not mind having them around because i knew i wouldnt lock myself in the bathroom inhaling them.  But if you love brownies and all its rich chocolately goodness - this is FOR YOU!

Niether my husband nor I cared for this recipe.  The brownie itself was dry and tasted very much like the premade Little Debbie brownies you buy at the store.  We did cut the sugar in half to make them healthier, but it was the textur that turned us off.

I made these for work and my coworkers loved them! I read all of the reviews before making these. I added 1/4 cup extra vegetable oil to the batter because other reviews said they were dry. I mixed the chopped pecans into the batter and put whole pecan halves and caramel on top before baking. I also used the thicker caramel ice cream topping instead of making my own.

I used caramel ice cream topping as I didn't have any caramels on hand. This was a hit and I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe :)

Sooooo good!  The only thing I did different was that I used caramel topping, which worked great and was a lot less messy and easier to clean up!

As written, yes, these are kind of dry and not the ooygooy brownie we all love. Add 1/4 cup veggie oil and it makes a world of difference. I also added a splash of cream to my caramels so that they didn't get so hard upon cooling again. These brownies are the bomb! And my study group devoured them.
