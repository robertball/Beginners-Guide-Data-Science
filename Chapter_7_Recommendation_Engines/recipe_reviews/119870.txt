I live in South Florida where we have a fast food chain that has a side called balsamic tomatoes. I wanted to have some balsamic tomatoes to go with a steak dinner that I was going to make. This recipe came pretty close to the one that we get at the restaurant. I let the tomatoes marinate in the dressing for close to two hours, they really soaked up the dressing and they came out pretty tasty. The recipe was fairly simple, I used dry basil and doubled to liquid to make sure all the tomatoes were covered so they could all soak. This is definately a keeper.

Great salad!  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  The fresh basil is perfect!

Very Good!  Thank you. I added some minced garlic for the garlic-loving hubby, but altogether....nice lil salad.

I liked this recipe a lot because I love the taste of balsamic vinegar.  However, the rest of my family complained about the prominent vinegar taste.  I made this recipe as written except for the basil.

I added 8 ounces of sliced baby bella and I doubled the dressing (including the fresh basil) so there'd be enough to dress the Baby Bella mushrooms. I really don't think it gets any better than this. I absolutely loved it. The family wasn't a huge fan but I didn't care--all leftovers became mine. It was SO good! NOTE: I cannot stress enough to use a quality balsamic vinegar. That will really make or break your salad.

This did not appeal to my taste buds at all because of the sugar and balsamic vinegar, but I knew Hubs might like it.  I left out the sugar entirely and reduced the red onion substantially. Definitely olive oil rather than canola, and I wished I would have skipped the garlic powder.  Also, balsamic vinegar is bold - I thought the amount called for was overkill, and adjusted the amount to taste so it was more subtle.

I didn't slice the tomatoes as shown in the picture - I used small grape tomatoes and left them whole. The fresh basil definitely makes this salad - I tried it first with just dried basil mixed in the balsamic vinaigrette, and then the next day with fresh basil and it was 100% better with fresh....a totally different salad. I have also tried itwith some grated (grated large) mozzarella cheese mixed in - really really liked that.

Wonderful flavor & simple to make. Used as garnish on turkey sandwich made w/ toasted ciabatta roll ( doesn't make a lot & we tend to eat bigger portions in my house).  Subbed 1/2 tsp dried basil for fresh basil, & it was still scrumptious. AMAZING flavor the whole family enjoyed!!!

I used homegrown tomatoes and a balsamic dressing that I had leftover from another recipe and wanted to use.  Even with those minor substitutions I think my end result was what the submitter intended.  Homegrown tomatoes, a good quality balsamic vinegar and fresh basil are key in this recipe.

This was a great refreshing recipe!  The only change I made was adding some fresh mozzarella.  The family loved it!
