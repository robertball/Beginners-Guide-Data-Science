I have been searching and testing many recipes for a ginger sauce that is like those served at hibachi (japanese style steakhouses) restaruants.  This so far is the closest I have found with decent measurements.  Initially it was too heavy on the soy taste, and so altered the recipe as follows:  used 1 tsp bottled lemon juice, used rice vinegar (but white would be fine), added sugar to total 2 tsps., and added 1 tablesspoon of mirin (japanese rice wine, although I think adding a little water to dilute would be ok).  I also used a white onion as yellow is sometimes too strong.  Fresh ginger is key, as well as a good smooth puree.  This is the closest I have come to duplicating the restaruant's version.

Yes, this is terrific--I grate the ginger instead of mincing. Start with the exact measurements, then go easy on each ingredient until you've got it nicely to your taste.  I like it very much just as written--it works!

I just had salmon with a ginger sauce at a resturant, came home and tried to replicate it.  This was a really good shot at it.  I did use this as a marinade for salmon...could have doubled the recipe to have fresh to pour over. I didn't measure the ginger exactly, but it could have used more.  Maybe a little less soy sauce.  Got 2 compliments from my mom and husband on the flavor.  Will make this again with more ginger and try it with chicken too.

This is the closest I have found to the Japanese Steakhouse type ginger sauce.  Definitely don't use a "hot" onion or it will overpower your sauce.  I only used 1 T. of soy plus probably an additional tsp. of fresh ginger.  Also...very important...it definitely needed more sugar.  I doubled the sugar then added a one tsp. of honey.  It certainly is VERY close to what I was looking for!

We found this too thin for a dipping sauce.  We used it as a marinade for salmon.  It turned out great.

Incredibly delicious.  leftovers make for a great low-calorie salad dressing.  I served it with shrimp, but it didn't have a substantial enough texture for it.  will make again (today) but will use low-sodium soy sauce - with regular it was really salty.

Don't change a thing! Awesome sauce-used for a fondue party I had, we dipped chicken and beef. Would be good for sushi, over grilled chicken or as a salad dressing too!

A secret used to increase body of the sauce was shared by our hibachi chef who we dine with every couple weeks for many years.  They include some raw carrot and celery blended in a blender to the sauce. This puts more fiber in the sauce.

I'm only giving this a 3 star not because it was bad. It was not to my likng. I do a lot of cooking with ginger and this just didnt do it for me. Judging from other reviews its great stuff so everyone give it a try.

I liked this sauce.  I made it for some pot stickers, and totally enjoyed the tangy kick this sauce provided.  I used bottled lemon juice, but will real lemons next time.  I also pureed the sauce for a while, because it takes some time to really mince the ginger root.

I made this and loved it!  I've been searching for a dipping sauce like what we get in Chinese and Japanese restaurants. This was extremely close.  Only thing I did different was I didn't blend in a blender.  I finely minced the onion (used white onion decreased the amount to 1/8 cup). Finely grated the fresh ginger.  Added just a touch of sesame oil, mixed it all together and WOW! EUREKA! This is it! And even better than a few I've had before.  I also increased the lite soy sauce to 1/3 cup. Thanks so much for sharing!

We made this sauce to accompany the chicken that we had with our Christmas Eve fondue and it was a big hit.  It tastes great, and would go well with fish, too.  We were even thinking that it would be a great marinade - although you would have to double, or maybe triple, the recipe if you wanted to use it as a marinade.  Delicious!!

We had to go back and make a quadruple batch. The first batch got eaten in 2 days. This sauce is AMAZING! It goes well on salmon, veggies, fried rice, and as a dipping sauce for baked crab rangoon.

The flavor of this sauce is very good, though I found it to be a bit too salty. Perhaps reduced sodium soy sauce will be better in the future. I added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice from concentrate, and it seemed like the right balance.

I doubled the recipe and low sodium soy sauce and Truvia in place of sugar.  I loved it! and most importantly... it didn't upset my boyfriend's finicky stomach, which says a lot!  :)  thank you!

This sauce is very good, but strong, gingery and salty - so a little goes a long way. Definitely use this for dipping rather than pouring unless you tone it down quite a bit. I threw all the ingredients in the blender which made the recipe super easy. I did add a little more sugar to taste at the end. We had this as an appetizer with pork potstickers and cold steamed shrimp. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

OK, so we didn't have the blender to properly mix everything, but the flavors of the ginger, garlic, soy sauce and sugar are fantastic!  We used the sauce in conjuction with the Chicken Katsu from this site, absolutely amazing! I could see using this sauce w/pot stickers, dumplings, anything that requires a soy based sauce. Fantastic!

This was okay.  It was like chunky soy sauce.  It wasn't anything special and wasn't worth the effort of chopping onions and peeling ginger.

I made recipe as is and found it way too salty and soy-saucy for my tastes, even with reduced sodium soy sauce. I would prefer it a tad thicker, too.

We substituted lime (instead of lemon), used red onion and red wine vinegar (because that's what we had!) and it turned out great. We actually used this as a marinade on thin-sliced beef, put the beef on a skewer and grilled it. So pleased. This is a keeper!

This is so easy to make, and it makes the dish truly asian. I made a Grilled Tilapia Fillet and I pour a few tablespoons of this sauce over it. It was delicious. I've used a light soy sauce and came out real good. Maybe next time I'll try without soy sauce instead just a few pinches of salt to avoid the dark color. Thank you

This recipe lasts for at least a week in the fridge. I used it on salmon, then used it on cooked vegetables throughout the week.

Perfect! I cannot praise this recipe enough. When I was an extreme beginner, I used ground ginger spice. Oh, how wrong I was. Fresh ginger is key! I used my food processor and it became clogged with the large chunks of ginger I put in. So pre-chop your ginger into no larger than thin 1/2 inch pieces. Process the solids, then mix in the soy if you have a small processor like I. I served this with steak and shrimp hibachi, fried rice, and egg rolls. Once again, perfect!

Nice sharp flavor from the ginger, but the salty soy overpowered this and I would have preferred a non soy based sauce. I even used half teriaki and half soy to try to reduce the soy some. I doubt I'll try this one again. This went really well with chicken.

The sauce was good for our fondue, but I found it too runny and the soy sauce overpowered it.  I think there are other thicker sauces out there that will still give the ginger flavour without the amount of soy.

This recipe is exactly like the ginger sauce they serve at Japanese Steakhouses.  It's great as a marinade.

Excellent sauce for grilled shrimp, but a little tangier than I'm used to.  Perhaps a little powdered sugar could be added to tone it down.

We're on our way to a Japanese steakhouse tonight that does not serve ginger sauce.  That's a travesty, imho.  Whipped up a batch of this very delicious sauce and I'll be on my way.  Wish me luck that I don't get kicked out!

My whole family really liked this recipe.  The flavor is perfect.  I used it to dip pork and eggplant wontons.  Made this recipe with no variants except I didn't have fresh ginger root so I just used a small amount of ground ginger.

We went to a Japanese steak house recently and I've been thinking about the ginger dipping sauce we had there ever since! Found this recipe and had to try it!  It was great.  Only substitution was Stevia instead of sugar (trying to be low carb). I thought it was very close and have used it for meat, veggies, anything I can think of trying!  Look forward to making it over and over again!

as written this would be "okay" but with a few modifications this becomes a 5* recipe.. here's what i did.. used vidalia onion, grated the ginger, 1 T bottled lemon juice, 2 T soy sauce, 2 tsp brown sugar (half that if it's going to be a marinade) and subbed rice vinegar for the white.. i used my ninja single serve to blend.. i doubled the recipe to use as a marinade on two very large chicken breasts which bf will grill later on.. ty for the start of something i'm sure i'll be making again ~~UPDATE: after trying the finished product i'd say for the marinade to use the full amount of soy sauce.. this was still very good though.. ty again for the recipe

This is a great recipe, it tastes just like the stuff from the hibachi grill restaurants.  There is one problem, DO NOT USE CHEAP INGREDIENTS. I tried to make it with the generic soy sauce under the grocery store's name and it was almost unusable.  when fresh it made me gag. managed to turn it into a great marinade though, so its all good.  If made with good high-end soy sauce though it is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

Due to the fact that one of our diners was alergic to soa - left it out. Even so, the sauce was wonderful. I can only imagine what it would have been like with it included. Will do this one again!

I thought this was just okay. My guests enjoyed it though.  Served with chicken fingers on fondue night!

Delicious dipping sauce and they were a great compliment to the Apple Brie Quesadillas and the Easy Picadillo Empanadas. Yum.
