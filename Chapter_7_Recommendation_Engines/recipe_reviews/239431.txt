There were some ingredients I just didn't have for this BUT what I subbed in for those things worked so well! I used green bell peppers instead of red, and oranges instead of mangoes. The mangoes would have been just lovely with this with their added spice. I topped it with sliced avocado. I want try this again with mangoes. SO good!

Really enjoyable fresh salad.  It had good flavor and great mix of textures and was a great side for the blueberry chipolte bbq chicken I made.
