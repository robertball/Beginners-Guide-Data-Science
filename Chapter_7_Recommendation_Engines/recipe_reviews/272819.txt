This is by far the best cheeseball I have ever eaten. 
I halved the recipe and it was enough for 6 as an appetizer .
The only thing  I did differently was I put it in a bowl lined with plastic wrap while it was setting up, flipped the bowl over after it was set (looks like a half of ball) . I  patted the pretzel and bacon on the half ball.
Thanks for the great recipe!
