I just made this recipe and it was fabulous.  I substituted half and half for the milk, simply because that's how I roll.  Then I sauteed some sliced almonds in butter and smothered them in cinnamon and sugar to put on top of the custard when it was done.  The only caution I have for less experienced cooks is that putting the eggs into the hot mixture will, very likely, cause you to have lumpy egg parts in the custard.  I went against my better judgment and did it anyway...then decided to strain it just in case.  Sure enough, there were egg lumps in there.  So, either strain it or add a little bit of the chocolate mix to the eggs before you add them to the saucepan.  That should take care of that problem.  Oh, and if you're impatient like me, you can put the custard in your freezer to cool it faster.  I had mine cooled down in about an hour. The custard was incredibly creamy and delicious and I'd make this again any day when I felt like I needed a serious chocolate fix.

I adapted this recipe to make a simple chocolate frozen custard with reeses peanut butter cups, but it worked beautifully on the first try.  Too rich for me to make on a regular basis, but I think it beats Christmas cookies for an original and decadent holiday gift.

My family and I love this recipe. Please keep in mind that it is not ready in 35 minutes as stated next to the recipe. You need to ensure the mixture is completely chilled, usually 6 + hours, before transferring to your ice cream maker.

I felt like this recipe was much to dark for our tastes so I made a few changes, only a few tablespoons of cocoa powder and some real milk chocolate along with more cream and a extra egg yoke! I also added a pinch of salt.It was a real winner with my husband who loves frozen custard! Thank you!

I did not use the same ratios because I get dairy delivered in quart increments from my co-op, but here is what I used:
1 qt (4 cups) heavy cream
2/3 cup whole milk
2/3 cup raw sugar
1 vanilla bean
5 egg yolks
3 Tbsp cocoa
3 oz. Callebaut unsweetened chocolate shavings

I followed the instructions with the addition of splitting/scraping/simmering the vanilla bean, tempering the egg yolks, straining the mixture, then cooling it in an ice bath like you would a ganache (mine took 1 hour in the fridge) prior to pouring it into my canister. Turned out great, perfect consistency, and the perfect amount to fit into my 1.5 qt gelato container, after the kiddos lick the paddle and get a small scoop of course.

OMG..everyone. This is AWESOME. For Primal,Paleo,Low Carbers. I used Coconut sugar,Grass fed/Organic Milk, Cacao powder, Cage free Grain Free Omega 3 Eggs yolks, Ghiradelli cacao . I used the Kitchen Aid ice cream bowl. After 30  min I poured it into a container and froze it because it was still liquid. I froze it over nite. Rich, creamy and dear goodness...delicious. Listen take your time and keep all the same measurements you won't do wrong.

Heavenly! I added chopped macadamia nuts  because we like nuts. Great ice cream...smooth, just the right amount of chocolate (I used 1/2 regular cocoa, and 1/2 dark cocoa). Love it, love it, love it!
