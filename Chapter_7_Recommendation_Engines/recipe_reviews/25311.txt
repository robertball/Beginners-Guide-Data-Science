This was DELICIOUS!  And I agree with previous reviewer, it can be done in no time at all! First, I couldn’t find canned lentils, so I bought a bag and because I was doubling the recipe, I estimated and used ½ the bag.  I soaked them overnight, then added some chicken broth and boiled them for 15-20 minutes.  Agree with previous reviewer....don’t fry each veggie..just roast them all together!  If you don’t have one already, get a mandolin – Pampered Chefs new one is GREAT!  I peeled the eggplant and sliced it up. Then sliced the Zucchini (didn’t peel)  Beset change was that I used RED Potatoes, which I love anyway, but better yet, you don’t have to peel! I put it all in a big roaster pan, coated them with Peanut Oil (can handle higher heat) and roasted them at 450-500 for 30-50 minutes (my oven cooks fast).  While they were cooking, I cooked up my onions and garlic added in the tomatoes, lentils, oregano and parsley and the cooked lentils.    (I took previous recommendation and added some cinnamon to this mixture)
I layered 1/3 of this vegetables in the bottom of my 9x 13 pan, then ½ of the onion/tomatoes mixture, then sprinkled Feta Cheese.  Repeat (1/3 veggie, rest of onion/tomato/feta) then top with remaining veggies and feta.  Bake for 25 minutes.
For the Béchamel sauce – I added more cinnamon and some nutmeg to this and it made it perfect!  Since I had doubled the recipe, I doubled this sauce – but I only used ½.
I’ve made twice since and am making it again his week for

Comes out excellent but takes a long time to make.  Just to clarify matters, every time the word "Drain" is mentioned in steps 1-4, they really mean "Remove ingredients from skillet and place aside on a plate".  Otherwise you will be mixing the ingredients all together and not browning them separately.

This recipie was very tasty, an excellent blend of flavors. Grilling the vegetables instead of frying was a great idea, tasted great and a time saver.  I omitted the potatoes, however.  I also used a half a cup of dry lentils instead of the canned ones.  Of course I boiled them before adding them to the filling.

The only eensy weensy gripe I have about this recipie is that it was very crumbly and fell apart (which of course didn't affect the great taste) when serving.  When I was in Greece, I remember that Moussaka was very firm, and looked kind of like little pieces of cake.  I think I will try blending into a paste about half of the lentil filling with a little egg and flour, and then mix that with the rest of the filling.  That should make it stick together a little more.

I think I have found a new favorite comfort food!!!  This was soooo good!  I used extra parm on top so it would be extra cheesy.  I also used white boiling potatoes, white onion, peeled the eggplant, and soaked and cooked my own lentils.  To everyone who says this takes a long time- not true.  This was in the oven with less cleanup than any of the Rachael Ray 30 min recipes I've tried and was super super delicious!  I will definitely make again!  Thanks for the great addition to my collection! ***Update 3/1/08...second pan made, came out even better than the first.  I timed it and it was in the oven speedy fast in just over 1/2 an hour...I use a huge pan and cook a lot of the ingredients together then separate them while I'm doing my layers.  I brought in half of the pan to work because I just couldn't eat it all...got rave reviews including one from a guy who claims to dislike anything made without meat.  I'm so impressed with this recipe, I've referred it to a bunch of people. YUM!

I almost deducted a star from this for how insanely long it took, but I changed my mind because I remembered that, in addition to the finished product being absolutely wonderful, it also made 3 meals for my husband and I.  

I pan-cooked the eggplant, as per the recipe, but I wound up roasting the potatoes and zucchini (I also ended up having to use almost double the vegetables as were called for.)  I also used crumbled gorgonzola instead of feta and romano instead of parm, since those were all I had on hand, and it still turned out magnificent.  I personally think the use of the lentils in this dish is genius, and the bechamel sauce tied it all together beautifully.  I'm not sure what I did differently from other people, but mine was neither mushy nor crumbly; it was actually perfectly firm and easy to slice through and serve.  It really turned out outstanding.  I will definitely make this again the next time I have an extra few hours. :)

I was discouraged from trying this recipe for a long time by the amount of work involved and by my husband, who didn't think it sounded good.  Well, he changed his mind after he tried it.  He totally loved it, and said that it tasted like it had meat in it, and was just like the original.  It took a lot of work, though.  I browned the eggplant in the oven and the zucchini and potato in a skillet on the stove, and it went a bit faster that way.  I think I could cut the time involved even further by slicing the zucchini and potatoes slightly thicker.  Mine were paper-thin, and not only did that make for a lot of slices to brown, but also the zucchini became very soggy while some of the potatoes were too crisp.  My only other complaint is that the moussaka was very liquidy, as others have mentioned.  Next time I'm going to drain the lentils before adding them to the tomatoes.

This had good flavor, but the labor was intense and the proportions were grossly inadequate for a 9x13 casserole. No where near enough to repeat layers, let alone create one complete layer of each. Grilling or broiling the vegetables will be a time saver next time. Using a smaller casserole or doubling all ingredients is a must.

This was surprisingly excellent! I used Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar, and I cooked dry lentils instead of using canned, used dried parsley, and I bought Israeli Feta from a deli, smart balance instead of butter, and Silk unsweetened soy milk instead of milk. This was phenomenal, I did not miss the meat.

My picky 14 year old said "Hey, this is actually pretty good!"

It kind of reminds me of lasagne.

I only rate the best recipes - and this one was DELICIOUS!!  It was well worth the time it took, and tasted even better the same day.  I made sure to drain the lentils well, as well as the tomatoes, and if I hadn't it would have been too runny.  Otherwise, DELISH!

THis is an amazing recipe! I prefer to omit the feta between layers and just put it on top...you can taste it better that way!  I also add more potatoes, zucchini and lentils to fill up the 9x13 pan a bit better.  I also grill the vegetables to avoid the use of oil.  Smells delcious while cooking!

Great recipe!  Very time consuming and labor intensive though.  The nutmeg makes the dish, don't scrimp on nutmeg in the bechamel sauce.  I also sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon on top of the potatoes.  Fantastic!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I made a few changes: 1) roasted the eggplant, zucchini, and potatoes (used little new ones), with a bit of salt, on cookie sheets in hot oven about 15-20 min; 2) added cinnamon to tomato/lentil mixture; 3) cooked 1/2 cup of dry lentils in 1 cup of water for 20 min instead of using canned; 4) used fat-free herbed feta; 5) added more onion, garlic, nutmeg and parmesan. It is a bit time consuming but if you roast the veggies (I didn't peal any of them) and cook the lentils while you get the onion/tomato mix going, everything is ready to layer together at about the same time. By roasting the veggies and using fat-free feta, I was able to lower the fat in this recipe - always a good thing. Not quite like the true Greek version, but a pretty darn good, healthier substitute.

Excellent! We increased the amount of veggies after reading previous reviews, to the following: 2 eggplants, 2 large russet potatoes, 3 zucchini, 2 cans peeled/diced tomatoes(one can drained and the other can with liquid included), 3 cloves of garlic and a tsp of cinnamon in the tomato mixture. We used 3/4 package of pre-cooked lentils from Trader Joes which did not have any liquid. We doubled the ingredients for the sauce and used the following:  plain soymilk with a dash of allspice (because we ran out of nutmeg). The dish has been out of the oven for almost an hour and seems to be holding up pretty well. Some liquid seeped out after we cut it but the texture is great. I expect that it will taste even better tomorrow after the flavors have had time to meld together. Side note: The amount of ingredients that we used filled up a 9X13 pan exactly to the top of the pan. We would highly recommend this recipe.

I should have reviewed this recipe long ago, as it is one of my favorites and I have made it 15-20 times since I found it. I have made it with several variations, as well. The proportions do seem a bit off to me as another reviewer suggested, as I feel like my layers don't always work out correctly. I have had better luck using 2 eggplants and 3 zucchini. I use only one potato ( it is delicious with sweet potato subbed as well) and just make one layer to cut carbs back a bit. I peel the eggplant and use a mandolin to speed up the slicing. I agree that spritzing the vegetables with  non-stick spray and baking them is a much more time efficient and healthy way to prepare them than pan-frying. I have made this using lentils, but experimented with subbing a bag of veggie crumbles and found that I greatly preferred that. The bechamel topping is so delicious I think I could drink it. I use whole wheat flour and almond milk for that, and it is great. This recipe does take quite a while to prepare, especially the first couple of times, so it is not ideal to try it out if you are in a time crunch or impatient. The results are well worth the effort, though! As I said, one of my all time favorites.

overall, this is a great recipe.  I think that it's important to use yukon gold potatoes and make sure that they get crispy before putting them in the casserole dish. The other thing, add cinnamon (makes it taste like a greek recipe). To make more low cal, and not skimping on taste, I used half the feta. It still tasted great! Also, double the beschamel sauce--then it will be fluffy, like a real moussaka.  With these changes, I will for sure be making it again!

This was incredible! I absolutely LOVED it and so did my hubby! I will make this again and again. The instructions are horrendous as other reviewers mentioned. It also does take a lot of time, but it's beyond worth it. I will probably add more eggplant and zucchini next time though it's fine the way it is.

FANTASTIC!  I gave it a five star for taste, however, I just want to suggest two things.

You can easily double the vegetables.  I found I almost didn't have enough for 2 layers.

Second, a greek friend of mine always adds a touch of lemon juice to her cooking.  I just sqeezed a bit on the eggplant and in the tomatoes.  It gave it just the SLIGHTEST kick!

I will make this again, I imagine it would go great with lamb!

MY WIFE SAID THAT THIS IS THE BEST DISH I HAVE MADE HER IN THE 6 YEARS WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED. THE RECIPE LOOKED EASY, BUT WITH A SIX MONTH BOY NEEDING MY ATTENTION IT WAS RATHER TAXING BROWNING ALL THE VEGGIES. FANTASTIC RESULTS. MEAT IS HIGHLY OVER-RATED.

Wow was this recipe labor intensive.  Soooo many steps and a ton of clean up.  I even roasted all the veggies together in the oven instead of browning them all individually.  The outcome wasn't bad but definitely not worth the effort.  I kind of thought the bechamel sauce was going to settle into the veggies and make a creamy sauce so I bought a loaf of crusty bread to sop it up with.  The bechamel baked on top though and there really was no sauce.  I probably won't be making this again.  I just don't have the time or energy for all of that.

This was very good and not nearly as complicated as it appears.  I took the advice of a couple of other cooks and oven roasted the eggplant, zucchini, and potatoes first andI put all the feta cheese on top.  I also cooked up lentils instead of using canned ones.  Mine moussaka was very firm and cut nicely.  My 2 teenagers even liked it!!  SCORE!  We will have this again!

Fantastic recipe. It couldn't have turned out better. I made it for company dinner and received raves from everyone, as well as recipe requests. I take off 1 star because of how long it took to prepare. From the time I picked up the eggplant to when the dish first went in the oven, more than 3 hours had passed! The 30-minute prep time given in the recipe is very misleading. I doubled everything in the recipe and used a 16 x 10" pan. I still could have used more eggplant and zucchini. If you use olive oil, you will need a lot more than 2 TBSP. Next time I will oven roast my veggies. I will definitely be making this again, but will know how to schedule it next time.

As a lot of others have said, this was very time consuming but totally worth it! It is definitely one of the most delicious meals I have ever had, I even have a fussy four year old eating it. Amazing!

Time consuming but an all time favorite at our house! 

I double the amount of sauce and I add lemon juice to the vegetables while they cook. (I use one small lemon for the whole dish).

Just made this and it turned out AMAZING!  The filling is surprisingly sweet but adds a lot of body to the dish.  I made the following changes:

-tripled the recipe
-omitted the zucchini and just used potatoes and eggplant for the base (I would say you could use potatoes OR zucchini, depending on your preference.  I don't see a need to use both as they are both relatively bland starchy veggies.)
-cooked the eggplant in the oven instead of skillet
-cooked both the eggplant and potatoes with thyme and garlic
-added bell peppers to the filling - this turned out great!
-used fresh tomatoes instead of canned
-after putting the filling and feta in the dish, added veggie chorizo and kalamata olives (the olives don't really fit with the overall flavor of the dish, so may not do that again)
-used manchego instead of parmesan

Only thing I would have done differently would have been to cook down the filling a little more beforehand or let it bake a little longer before adding the creamy topping.  It would hold up a little better without the additional liquid.

But, yeah, this is a legit delicious recipe.

Time-consuming.  Was pretty good but not a five-star.  I thought it was fairly bland. Held together well.  Used dried lentils becuasse I couldn't find canned. Picture doesn't match recipe.  I thought moussaka had mashed potatoes on top like the picture.

Hearty and satisfying! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and will be making it again for my family's X-mas eve dinner. Making the components  ahead of time makes this dish less time-consuming.

I cooked my own French lentils (added garlic and bay leaf to the cooking water) and used "petite diced" tomatoes in the sauce - I made the sauce 2 days ahead of time. I roasted the eggplant and zucchini in one pan, and the potatoes in another, since they usually take a bit longer.  I assembled the dish and made the white sauce a day ahead.

I'm going to double the white sauce and add extra nutmeg to it when I make this again.

This was a wonderful recipe that was time-consuming, but easy to make.  I chose to grill the veg in the oven which was far quicker and you'll use less oil that way too! I used more feta cos I really love the stuff and will definitely be making this again and again - my meat-monster husband even wants me to make it again.  Update - I made this again last week and for the first time ever noticed that the recipe only calls for half a tin of lentils - I have always used a full tin, drained with good results.

Very nearly worth the long prep time. Not that it wasn't great, but it takes a really long time. I couldn't find canned lentils so I cooked some fresh ones and used some of the broth, came out great, not watery at all. My only complaint is it was a little skimpy, a quarter of it doesn't fill me up. I would probably up the potatoes, eggplant, and zucchini were I to make it again. And why do you have to get whole tomatoes and chop them? Wouldn't getting chopped tomatoes be easier?

Like others have said... Time consuming yes.... Worth it? Absolutely!!!! I'm wore out BUT Delish!!!! I would make this again! I wanted to add a photo to share all my hard work I put in to it but for some reason it won't let me add the photo. 2 thumbs up on this! Note: I couldn't find canned Lintols so I bought a bag of dried ones and boiled them. I also added more of all the veggies to have enough to spread in a 9x13 pan.

While the taste came out great, the recipe proportions were way off. I used a medium eggplant and zucchini, but ended up with enough for 2 casseroles. Then the béchamel sauce was short. I also think it needed much more tomato sauce. I will try again with more sauces, make 2 (enough for two meals for 3) and see how it comes out. As others noted, this is a lot of work. It took me 2.5 hours.

This recipe is fabulous!  It is delicious and hearty, even my non-veg friends rave about it.  Though I think the prep time is off if you consider all of the browning part of the prepping, which I do.

BTW: it freezes beautifully, so I always double or triple the recipe.

I did not care for this.  The recipe takes a lot of time, and even though I followed the directions to a T, mine turned out very vinegary.  It was overpowering for my pallet. Too much working against this recipe for me to ever make it again.

Judging by the other reviews I must've done something very wrong.  The veggies were mushy, the flavor was bland and it took forever.  I definitely won't be trying this one again.

This was an amazing dish! Planning on making it again for a date night but with more experience around the kitchen I should be able to shave off some of the time in preparing it. I did make a few changes. I used soy milk instead of cows milk and omitted the salt. The potatoes were not specified so I chose red potatoes. This way there was less peeling involved.

My new favorite recipe, 5 stars even though I think the instructions to brown the veg in a frying pan are off base as that would take forever. I roasted them on 2 large sheets in a very hot convection oven - the potatoes took a bit longer than the rest. The recipe is easily varied, I've added tons more zucchini (why do I plant so much?) as well as extra potatoes. The leftovers are wonderful.

This may just be my new favorite food, I used white navy beans instead of lentils and sweet potato in place of regular potato. Like other reveiwers I roasted my veggies in the oven to cut out the oil used. I sprinkled the eggplant and sweet potato with seasoning salt and just a dash of cinnamon and then roasted them for 30 mins. Wonderful recipe, I will make this again and again

I have a feeling I missed a step or two somewhere, but I am not sure where. My rating is on the frustrations I had cooking alone (not on taste).  First, it took me 2 and half/almost three hours (maybe making cupcakes before this was a bad choice). Go with the suggestions - grill and or roast those veggies.  Second, I have no idea how someone fried the veggies in only 1 T of oil.  I had to use a lot more than that.  Finally, after all that work, I was only able to get one layer of each down.  I think a 9x13 pan is too big.

I am giving four stars only because it takes so long to make. The dish itself was amazing. When I first made this I didn't have much cooking experience and I was worried the entire time it was going to be terrible. I was very surprised at how good it was. The lentils give it an almost meaty texture, non vegetarians will not feel like they are missing a thing. Make this on a day when you really feel like spending some time cooking. Don't even attempt if you are already hungry cause it really does take a long time. Or make ahead of time. people are always wowed by this great recipe!!

This is delicious.  I roasted all vegies in the oven.  I didn't add lentils (forgot).  Seasoned vegies good between layers and added some additional feta and grated parm to the bechamel sauce.  I also used a smaller pan.  Will be making again!

Made this last night & it was fantastic! I used a mandolin to slice the veggies and roasted them as other reviews suggested. I also used canned lentils, added fresh red bell pepper to the onion sauté and used diced fire roasted tomatoes with chilies in them which added a great kick and lots of flavor to the mixture. I added 1tsp. cinnamon and Greek seasoning to the lentil mixture. I doubled the Béchamel sauce since I was using a longer pan with less layers and added 1tsp. of cinnamon and nutmeg to the sauce. It was not labor intensive just required lots of baking time.  It smelled wonderful & came out delicious! This recipe is a keeper & I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  Instead of frying the veg in a skillet, you can bake in the oven at 375 for about 30 min.  Also used 2 eggplants, sliced lengthwise b/c you can never have enough eggplant!  I used 2 cans chickpeas instead of lentils - I prefer the taste, color, and texture.  Used large can (28 oz) of crushed tomatoes instead of whole and added some fresh basil to sauce mixture - adds the most amazing flavor!  This is a great freezer recipe too!

This was OK.  Kinda bland.  Probably will stick with my Moussaka recipe.  It's was a nice change of pace to have it with no meat but there was just something missing.

This was okay.  I liked it enough to make it again, but I would make it in an 8x8 pan instead of 9x13--it really didn't have enough veggies to make a big tray.  Also, I used a whole can of lentils by accident and it was good.

Very tasty.  But it took me 3 hours to make, not 2.  I grilled the veggies, which gave it a nice flavor, but added more time.  Next time I will oven roast them so I can do other things while they cook.  Also, the veggies were a little mushy - I wonder if I could cook it just once, not twice, for 25 minutes?

Wow! Yum!  I have never had moussaka, so I have nothing to compare it to; however, this is wonderful.  Instead of frying the vegetables in oil, I placed them on a baking sheet and baked them til tender and slightly browned.  This worked for me because i was using the oven for other things and was not in a hurry; otherwise, i would not recommend it as it takes very long!  I halved the recipe and cooked my own lentils, also played a bit with the onion/lentil/tomato mixture to use the fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce I had on hand.  Mine came out very firm, but not dry -- perfect amount of liquid.  I took it for my lunch to heat up and work, and thoroughly enjoyed it!

This recipe was a lot of work with very little taste.  The layers definitely needed something to hold them together more to make into a pie.  The lentils were terrible and did not go at all with this recipe. The only thing that was good was the bechemel sauce except you need more of it.  I think I will try it again but will put the bechemel sauce between each layer instead of just on top and entirely omit the lentils.  I will look for a better and easier recipe.

Very tasty, when it was finally done.  I have a few suggestions.  
1) Instead of frying the veggies, roast (broil) them in the oven.  This can be done in 2 five-minute sessions, doesn't get the vegetables all saturated with oil (much healthier), and is quicker.  Just brush with olive oil, lay out on large roasting pan (with a rack is perfect) and brown.
2) two potatoes?  I found the quantities in this recipe too imprecise - you have to have made it once to know how much of everything to use.  But of course you can adjust quantities to suit your taste.
3) In step 5, you say "saute onion and garlic in reserved oil.." You could saute eggplant in 2 cups of olive oil and there will be none left over!  1 Tbsp. olive oil is only enough for step 5 alone.
4) A pinch of nutmeg isn't enough - more like a tsp.
5) In step 6, you say to layer the onions in with the potato, eggplant, zuccini and feta, but the onions have already been simmered in with the lentils and tomato.  Were we supposed to take them out?  

Anyway - came out well, but required some tweaks and took a long time.

I followed some of the previous suggestions. i peeled the eggplant. i roasted all of the vegetables including the onion and I added a 1/2 chopped red pepper. I only used 2 tablespoons of the lentil juice. I used a deep casserole dish about 8 x 10. The size was perfect. After layering I added all the feta on top rather than inside the layers. It was delicious!

Delicious.Preparation was key to this recipe. I baked the thinly sliced eggplant instead of sauteing so it gave it a more dense texture and more flavour. Good one-pot meal served with fresh green salad.

First time I made this using the pan-fry method and draining on paper towels, which took forever and made a huge mess. Still it came out great. I made it again only a week later and grilled the veggies in the oven on 425 for 15 min (watch closely). Took less than half the time and mess.
Both times I used about a half cup of half and half in the sauce along with my 2% milk as we usually do not have any whole milk, also extra fresh parmesan- whole foods brand. 
Cooked for 23 min in convection oven.
Thanks for a great recipe.

The recipe is a true treasure, especially after the time-saving grilled eggplant and zucchini from Trader Joe's (2 bags). Otherwise, the recipe would have been too much prep time for a weekday. Start to cleanup, it was about 2 total hours of prep WITH the added time saver. I also subbed a block of tofu instesad of the lentils. I think the bonus were the dried herbs that I added from my garden, which added more flavor than the original: 2 tsp. rosemary, oregano, and sage.

Made this tonight and it was my first time making a moussaka. It turned out better than I thought esp when I didn't have all the ingredients.  

Used 2 eggplants to replace the missing zucchini and omitted the feta cheese as I didn't have any on hand. Like some reviewers suggested, tossed the eggplant and potato with some peanut oil and roasted in the oven for 30 min at 450. About half way through the roasting, took it out & mixed it up so the top layer don't burn. It was pretty soft at this point so the pieces did break though in the end, it doesn't matter. Used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. Used 2 tbsp of lentil juice instead of the suggested amount. The dish seem runny when I first pulled it out the oven but once it was left to settle, it was just right. As I was missing feta, I added salt to the tomato/onion mixture to ensure there is enough seasoning. Layered the baking dish with 1/3 mixed veg, arugula (had some on hand which I wanted to use), 1/2 tomato/onion mixture and repeat ending with the veg. Used 1/2 cup of parmesan to make up for the missing feta. 

The end product was a nice soft and tasty meal with some bread and butter. Great dish for adding more veg to one's diet. Next time I should make it with the feta cheese but we did save a bit of calories w/o adding it and it was still good.

Thank you Anne for posting the recipe and everyone else for your reviews and suggestions.

If you follow the directions, this recipe takes FOREVER to make. I was making 4xrecipe so it should have taken some extra time but it took something like 6 hours start to finish to cook everything separately. I'm not sure why everything can't just be baked together.

It was delicious though.

This is excellent. I grew up eating my Yia Yia's lamb moussaka, but became a vegetarian years ago. This doesn't taste quite like hers, but it's still delish.

To cut some fat/save some time, I roast the vegetables instead of frying them.  I also use lemon juice instead of vinegar and omit the tomatoes from the lentil mixture (they might be tatsy, but Yia Yia's moussaka never had tomatoes in it!)

The flavor of this dish is mild and understated. I made a few alterations, based on what I had at home. I had no potatoes, so I augmented with extra lentils (a whole can instead of half) Otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. The taste was good, the texture was fine (the vegetables were VERY soft, probably due to the fact they are browned/fried, then cooked for another hour total in the oven). I will be cooking this again, perhaps making some more changes to make it a little more flavorful (more oregano, more garlic, more onions...).

fantastically good! Made pretty much as stated, but sprinkled 2t. baharat spice over the middle layers.
Nice spice mix with cinnamon, cloves, coriander, nutmeg and paprika. Perfect mix if spices to add to the already wonderful flavors! Made it once and will make it again and again for EVERYONE!

This was nice and my guests enjoyed it, but I felt it needed spicing up or more cheese, hence the three stars. Also, my layers didn't work out as the recipe directed. I did follow others' advice and roasted the eggplant and zucchini in the oven. So much easier! Instead of pan frying or roasting the potatoes, I blanched the slices in boiling water. I think the frying would have tasted better but I was trying to cut down on the fat. I think if I try this again I would add more tomatoes as well, even fresh ones. I would also add some cheddar cheese to the white sauce and more parmesan than called for. I still prefer lamb Moussaka but for vegetarians it's a good recipe.

This was very tasty!  I roasted my veggies in the oven like others had suggested.  I baked it in the removable crock of my slow cooker then kept it warm in the crock pot until we were ready to eat it.  Everyone LOVED it and it went well with the grilled portobella mushrooms and salad that we had for dinner!

Wow this recipe is just the best!!! I used fresh oregano and parsley. I also followed another reviewer and grilled all the veggies. The final dish had a nice kick from all the black pepper I put on the veggies while grilling! The recipe definitely was time consuming but absolutely worth it!

You will spend about an hour frying the vegies....I even started using 2 pans.  I will definitely try baking them next time.  I don't feel it is necessary to peel any of the vegetables.  The eggplant seemed to suck up the olive oil - so go light.  I used soy beans instead of lentil beans....I only used the juice from the tomatoes to simmer in....anymore liquid than that and the dish would have been too runny.  The soy beans tasted awesome!!  I'd be curious to find out how much adding cinnamon would add to the flavor....VERY good as is though.

This takes a lot of prep work, but is SO worth it.  Next time I will use double the amount of eggplant and zucchini as I love the taste of these veggies roasted.  This delicious recipe made a dinner and 3 days of lunches for my husband and me.

This took me hours to make, but possibly also because I doubled all the ingredients.  I believe it might freeze well, and intend doing that, so that maybe justifies all the time spent on prep. work.  Turned out really good.  Will be so nice to just defrost and warm next time, and I hope it does work well.  I possibly prefer the vegetarian lasagne I made recently from this site, but this is a nice change.  I am trying different vegarian meals, as we are trying to eat less meat in the future.

I gave this dish 5 stars because it really tastes great. However, I did make a slight change: instead of frying the eggplant and the zucchini, I grilled them. And since I ended up with not enough eggplant and zucchini slices to actually have 3 layers, I suggest using one more eggplant and one more zucchini. Other than that, great recipe!

update: I did it second time and I freezed it, it's great! Just take a portion, put it in the oven and you can have this delicious moussaka without spending 2 hours again to make it;))

This is rather labor intensive but delicious.  To reduce the amount of oil needed to saute the veg., I roasted them in the oven instead.  With such thin slice (I used a mandoline as suggested by another reviewer) it took quite a while and really only browned one side.  I can't wait to try it again, without precooking the veg.

The only reason I don't give this a 5 is because it is so labor intensive. But I'm a vegetarian with carnivore in-laws, and this satisfied them so much, my mother-in-law asked for the recipe.  I've made it several times and will make it again, but I have to feel "up to it."

This is very flavorful but geez is it a production to make... A dish for rare nights when I have a couple hours to get something together for dinner. The only change I made was to replace the feta for mozarella - the feta is probably better (and more authentic) but I didn't have any. I'm happy there are leftovers.

We used bulk black beluga lentils which we boiled with thyme- it added a great flavor.  I think we'll cut back on the feta, maybe use 1/2-3/4 cup instead of 1 cup because the bechamel sauce was so rich.  It did take a little time but that just means my husband and I got to hang out.  All in all, delicious!

Really yummy!  It takes some work to pull this together, so it not a quick and easy recipe, but well worth the extra time.  I followed others suggestions to roast the vegetables in the oven to save time and that worked well. I love nutmeg,  so added extra.  We are making this for Xmas dinner this year for so we vegetarians can have something special.  Thanks!

We loved this!

Similar to other recommendations, I made these changes:
- I used dried lentils: soaked with some water overnight and cooked in water.
- I roasted the eggplant and zucchini in the oven (w/ olive oil) and sauted the potatoes on the stove
- To cut the fat, I used 1% milk and a little less butter. I also used reduced fat feta.
- I didn't have nutmeg, so I used garam masala (indian blend of spices).  I accidentally threw in too much cinnamon, which was delicious!

Definitely will make again! Next time, I'll use less liquid from lentils and maybe keep some of the tomato juice from the canned tomatoes.

This is an EXCELLANT recipe.  Although it does take a long time to make, and I had 2 frypans going on the hotplate to brown the vegetables!  I didn't find it crumbly at all, it was very moist and lush.  For those who thought it didn't hold well in slices, maybe wait 10 minutes before cutting and serving?  
I also found it was firmer the next day and that the flavours had developed.  It was twice as good as left overs!  
I followed the recipe exactly apart from increasing to 250g of Bulgarian Fetta, and a handful of grated tasty cheese in the white sauce.  I like cheese!

I will definately make this one again, but I will follow advise given and bake veg in the oven to save frying time.

This was very good- I'd never had moussaka before and wanted to make something challenging. I added cinnamon to the tomato mixture as suggested and roasted some of the vegetables in the oven and sauteed some one the stovetop, mostly so I could *try* to save time. It still took me about 2 hours prep-wise. I also sliced the zucchini and eggplant length-wise which saved me a lot of time, and used the slicer attachment on my food processor for a lot of the veggies. I really enjoyed it and it saved well- took me about a week to eat it all, even bringing some to the girls at work who all loved it.

Good food takes time, adding 1/2 hour to the prep time is more realistic. Individual portions freeze well, make a big batch to make it worth the effort.

I thought this was good, but not excellent. Next time I would spice up the sauce, maybe add red wine.  Also I agree with others, if you use the recipe's vegetables, use an 8" pan, otherwise for the 9 by 13 double the vegetables and the bechamel.  Use either the 1/2 t cinnamon or a dash of lemon juice in the sauce..  Next time consider slicing the zuccinis lengthwise to make it faster to grill them.  I sprayed my eggplant and zuccini with olive oil spray and lightly broiled them while I browned the others.  Good reicpe, just need more spices and it does take time.

This recipe was delicious!  The preparation is time consuming, but with practice and a cusinart it can be expedited.  Deviations from Recipe: I roasted all of the veggies rather than pan fry and they turned out great.  I think next time I won't pre-cook the zucchini at all as it ended up very mushy.  I added a little cinnemon to the tomato mixture, and I used sweet potatoes rather than regular.  The leftovers did not keep very well as it all turned into mush so I will make less next time.

This was a bit of a pain to make (nothing complicated, but time consuming--lots of steps), but it was absolutely delicious.  A really hearty vegetarian meal--I'd definitely make again.

I thought this was great and had no problems with liquids etc. I turned the bechamel sauce into a cheese sauce by replacing the egg with about 1/2 cup grated edam. I also forgot the feta, but it tasted great (although I will remember the feta next time!!)
I didn't think it was too much hassle, and took me just over 90mins from the time I started cooking to eating.

This is a great option for vegetarians who like the Greek classic. I fed this to my Greek husband, and he loved it as well (which was a real shocker)! Much healthier than the ground beef version, too.
Be sure to cut the potato slices really thin before browning, or they take too long to cook in the oven.

This recipe is good, but too time consuming. Although I liked it, I don't think I'll make it again because it takes too much time for a normal day, but doesn't taste wonderful enough if you have guests.

Absolutely delicious - worth all of the prep time (I wish the browning did not take so long). My family loved it. I used more feta, because I love the flavor that feta imparts, and I used more parmesan too. Bravo - thanks for posting this winner!

This was excellent!!  I made this for our Labor Day celebration and had 2 other couples to share with us.  I followed the recipe (pretty much), but cooked my own lentils, used a 28oz can of chopped tomatoes (with the juice).  I used allspice, added an extra half of zucchini.  The flavors were incredible!  I’ve never made moussaka before, let alone a vegetarian version.  I will make this again and again.  Everyone was favorably impressed.  I also roasted the veggies in my convection oven, with olive oil, rather than frying them.  It IS a lengthy process, but so worth the effort.  Even more delicious the next day!  Thank you for sharing this gem!!

I used pearl Barley and French lentils for a more diverse texture. It was “meaty” and excellent. Couldn’t find eggplant in my local store  so I used zucchini only. My herbs were fresh. Also added salt free Mrs. Dash for more flavour. Definitely impressed my vegetarian friends! Highly recommend.

Based on other reviews I made some changes.  I tried to speed this up and simplify it as much as possible and it still took 1.5 hours from start of prep to complete.  Whoever said it takes 30 minutes is smoking crack!  I used 1 eggplant peeled, 3 zucchinis, and 3 large red potatoes with skin on.  I threw them all in the food processor with the slicer and put that on a jelly roll pan (coated veggies with peanut oil) and baked at 425 for 32 min.  I did not salt the eggplant  or do anything to it besides peel and slice it, then roast it.  It wasn't bitter or watery after the roasting.   Eggplants have been genetically engineered to be less bitter so salting and rinsing is truly a total waste of time.   Since I put these veggies together I wasn't able to layer them seperately so mine turned out more like a casserole with a bechamel/cheese layer on top.  I used 2 cans of Annie's lentil soup (drained) and 2 cans of diced tomatoes drained.  I tried to drain all the liquid from the dish and I'm glad I did because it held together nicely upon serving.  It was really tasty and healthy!  My husband loved it!  I will make it again and I will try soy crumbles instead of lentils next time, for something different.

It was actually better the next day, but it was delicious fresh out of the oven too. I am a big fan of this recipe. I did use goat cheese, feta and parm  since I ran out of feta. Also I used Morning Star Farm's ground instead of lentils. I improvised with the ingredients I had on hand. Everyone loved it!

Wonderful recipe. I doubled everything and it worked well for my 9x13 pan. I oven roasted the veggies instead at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. This cut out a lot of time and the assembly went quick and easy. Delicious!

Really tasty dish but I will take the advice given below and grill all the veggies in one go rather than pan frying bit by bit which took forever.

The end result was flavourful and family gave positive reviews.  As many others have done I grilled (broiled) the veggies and found by the time they were slightly browned there were almost cooked so I knew they wouldn't have to be baked as long as recipe called for.  I also cut my veggies, esp the eggplant and zucchini fairly thick as I wanted to be able to distinguish individual tastes and didn't want it too mushy.  Basically I baked it for about 10 min while I was making the sauce, then added sauce and cooked till brown.  The end result was nice and firm and tasty.

A WHOLE lot of work for a very mediocre meal. I'd honestly be happier with a frozen lasagna, which is what this sort of tastes like. Only less yummy.

This is a fabulous recipe,  I have made it several times now and it is always a big success!
Very easy to make just takes time, but if you get organized and chop everything in advance it goes much faster.
I serve it with a simple salad.    The leftovers I box and store in the fridge,  it matures really well and tastes even better a day or two later.

The final product was very scrumptious but, next time I will be baking the vegetables all on one baking sheet instead of browning in the skillet. Also, this recipe may be better suited for a smaller casserole dish. 9x13 was just too large. I left out the egg (dietary restrictions) and served it with chicken sausage, although it was great on it's own! I will be making this again.

I have just made it. It took 2 hours, from start to ready to eat. I also roasted the veggies in the oven for 30min. I should have sliced them more thickly, as the aubergine and courgette kind of melted away for being so thinly sliced. I used grated cheese - some kind of cheddar - instead of feta - as I didn't have it - it probably got richer, but rather yummy. All in all it was very nice, as my husband pointed out. It was the first time cooking and eating moussaka and I really enjoyed. I will make it again.

Currently waiting for this dish to cook. I'm sure it'll be delicious, however I was not impressed with the actual recipe. Some of the actual steps were't clear; for example, where did that extra onion to layer in the dish come from? Also, the tomatoey sauce was too runny, so had to be thickened up with corn starch. Unfortunately there was also not nearly enough vegetables to cover and and layer my 9 by 10 inch dish with. Lastly, I thought the instructions for layering were way to vague for a dish which relies on its layers. Hoping the taste of the dish will make up for the slightly sloppy recipe.

Thank you, this was soooo delicious. I made the eggplants slices in the oven, while I was doing the zuccini and I pre-cooked the potatos a bit in order to shorten the preparation and cooking time. Worked out just fine.

The amounts are all off, and there's just not enough bechamel- definitely needs to be doubled for the topping.  I put a lot more vegetables in, and a touch of cayenne.  Good base recipe, needs some tweeking:)

I made this with fat free feta as I am trying to avoid animal fat.  It was UNBELIEVABLE!   I ate the whole pan by myself in two days.  I also subbed Brummel & Brown yogurt-based butter for the topping.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I will make a vegetarian out of my hubby yet!

I enjoyed this dish but I found the proportions weren't accurate for me. I ended up using an 8x11 dish and that fit everything perfectly. I also didn't find that I had enough "tomato mixture" to drip over the vegetables from the onion mixture, but maybe I did something wrong? Being some one who likes spice and robust flavor, I also wished this had just a little bit more of a kick to it... Perhaps some more spice. I will definitely use this recipe again (when I have the time to use it) but will probably investigate some other Moussaka recipes to see what types of spices might go well. Happy cooking!!

So delicious! A very balanced veggie meal that will knock even carnivores socks off.   My husband and sister, who both despise eggplant and zucchini, had double servings!  It was very time intensive to make, and mine turned out a little wet, but it was so good that I am still giving it 4 stars.

I made this recipe today. I used baby bella mushrooms in place of the zucchini since i'm not a huge fan. It cam out pretty darn good.  However, it took a ridiculous amount of time to make. It was difficult to brown all of those sliced vegetables on the stovetop, if I were to do it again, I might use the oven. The recommended amout of olive oil seeemed a bit unrealistic for all of those vegetables as well.  Again, very yummy.

Cooked this for a dinner party with vegetarians attending! They loooooved it....in addition to all of the other meat-eating guests. It was nice to serve one dish that everyone could enjoy (instead of multiple). My only complaint was that there wasn't any leftovers. I'll make more next time. Thanks!

Pretty dang good, could use salt or something, or less potatoe slices and more eggplant, the eggplant was delicious. It does look less appealing than the picture as the lentils and everything turned grey!

Fabulous. I skipped the gated parm and it was still delicious. I'll share my steps b/c I think I made it easier than recipe called for. First, I baked all the sliced veggies (except for the tomatoes) rather than frying anything. It took about an hour for them to cook thoroughly. I doubled the amount of tomatoes- used a 28 oz. can of diced- and simmered them with the lentils and approx. 1/2 cup of bean liquid I had from another recipe. The lentils were soft after about 20 minutes. Then, I put it all together with feta mixed throughout. I didn't follow the layering steps- I just topped it with the sauce. Voila!

Definitely worth the effort.  I've made this twice already, and am saving up energy to make it again soon.  I really love this recipe, and so do my husband and his meat-loving friends!

This took a lot of time and effort to make and the directions are a bit confusing, and odd. Who has a frying pan big enough to brown the eggplant, zucchini, and potatoes on both sides? It's probably best to put those veggies on a pan and into the oven. And if you have double ovens, even faster! But overall the taste was pretty good, but not as good as I wanted from somthing I spent hours on.

A tasty recipe but takes a long time time to make.  Next time will probably just try roasting the eggplant/zucchini with some olive oil rather than pan-fry.

June 18, 2010 Update (I've made this many times now)
I'm using the whole can of lentils now, using ample fresh tomatoes still and reducing the lentil juice and tomatoes along the way, otherwise sticking with the general plan. I find I use more or less potatoes, eggplant and zucchini depending on the size of the materials I have to work with. Use your own judgment. I try to get the potatoes and eggplant about equal in terms of surface area and fill around with zucchini. I believe you are supposed to remove the onions before moving forward after browning them then put them back as a layer. The directions don't say this but after a while it seemed like that was what the recipe asks for since it says to layer them later on. I love this, I do slight variations each time but it is consistently awesome. It takes a long time even with a big griddle to brown stuff on, but the result is worth the effort. This is by far my favorite recipe on this site. I traveled to Greece and has moussaka with lamb and beef but I almost prefer it with the lentils. 
--------------
Feb. 4, 2010: This turned out well. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned but otherwise followed the recipe without much variation. It was very flavorful and held together well for me. It wasn't terribly pricey and we'll get a few meals out of this.

Excellent recipe! I used eggplant,mushrooms,leeks,grated carrot,garlic, and potatoes. In place of the lentils I used about a cup of cooked quinoa. It was awesome! The topping is amazing and the nutmeg makes the dish. It's very easy to miss so be careful.

This was incredible.  Some of the other suggestions such as baking the vegi's would have been a huge time saver but making it for the first time, I wanted to follow the receipe.  I did omit the last step (the sauce) to reduce calories even further and this dish was amazing.  I ate it three different times in one day.   Yum.

This took 3 hours to make.  I roasted the veggies in two sheet pans.  I added more lentils and less potatoes than the recipe called for, but I should have stuck to the directions.  Wish I would have been braver on the nutmeg and cinnamon. I just added two small pinches of nutmeg to the bechamel and sprinkled a little cinnamon over the roasted potatoes. Next time I'll use a cinnamon stick in the tomato reduction. And next time, I'll do some chopping and lentil cooking ahead of time. I would have given it four stars last night right out of the oven, but it tastes REALLY good the next day. The flavors have really melded together. Yum!

I love this recipe. It's very adaptable to what you have on hand. I used summer squash in place of zucchini, and added about 2 cups lentils instead of half a can the recipe calls for. I would add more tomatoes next time. I almost skipped the white sauce, but I'm glad I didn't. It's delicious and was easy to make. I didn't have parmesan, so I left it off. Maybe a cracker or bread crumb topping would be good on it too. You could top it with biscuits or dumplings, or even a corn bread topping. Endless possibilities. I used cooking sherry instead of white wine vinegar. I used cheddar cheese instead of feta because that's all I had. It was great. So many different ways you can change this up. Yummy.

Scrumptious! Slightly time consuming to make, yes, but at least the effort was well worth it. Not all delicious dishes can be made in 10 minutes. I had plenty of extra moussaka and so I sliced the remaining amount into individual portions and put in the freezer. I enjoyed the dish just as much a week later. Nice to know thawed and reheated this meal still tastes great!

Delicious! Time consuming, but worth it! I have been eating the leftovers for 3-4 days now.  Light, but filling and even feels like your eating meat (great for my fiance who's a big meat eater). :)

I actually make this with veggie ground meat, I do roast all of the vegetables instead of sauteeing, use 1% milk and it's fantastic!  Be warned to not add too much salt because the feta is quite salty already...

I roasted the vegies on sheet pans for a little while to dry them out a tad instead of frying. I also added cinnamon and cumin to give it more of a Greek flavor. I could eat this every day!

I was dissapointed with this recipe given the amount of time it took to prepare. I found there was too much flavour of potato and not enough 'saucy' flavour. I added more tomatoes than called for but it was still dry.

This was very good, but could use more spice. It was also quite time-consuming. I'll probably make it again someday, but only when I've forgotten how long it took me to thinly slice everything!

I was so nervous making this dish...I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, but WOW it tastes fantastic!  I read all of the reviews to date and made a few changes - I added more feta cheese and pich or 2 of cinnamon. Fantastic...I rate it a winner!!

This was fantastic! I served this to my fiance who is a huge meat eater, and he didn't complain about the lack of meat even once! He said the flavours were really great and tasted like restaurant food! Since I had never tried making a moussaka before, I took that as a huge compliment. 

I did take another members advice and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the tomato mixture, and used about twice the amount of canned tomatoes recommended. 
Thanks for the great recipe! Will definately be making this again!

Oh wow, this recipe was SO good! Next time I make it I will slice the potatoes as thinly as possible since I think this will improve their texture a little...aside from that I don't really have anything else to add...this dish was wonderful!

This was great as written but the second time I made it I doubled the lentil tomato mixture and doubled the beauchemel sauce and it was excellent thes two sauces is what really makes the recipe. Oh also I would peel the eggplant to avoid stringy skin.

Loved this. Absolutely delicious. I used dry lentils instead of canned, and canned diced tomatoes. I'll definitely be making this again. Even those who don't usually like eggplant and feta loved it.

This turned out pretty well. It was two layers in a 9x13 pan rather than three, but it was enough. I roasted the veggies instead of sautéing, per someone's suggestion, which took a while but served the purpose of getting them soft, although there wasn't much left of my eggplant when it was done. I used a can of black beans instead of lentils, and that worked well. I was going for gluten free and dairy free, so I left out all the cheese and made the sauce with almond milk (2c), almond flour (4Tb), and olive oil (2Tb), which mostly worked. It was didn't thicken much until I added the egg. BTW, if you're going vegetarian, notice you have an EGG in here. I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the sauce, and that worked. The dish got good reviews at a church dinner, but it was a lot of work.

Make sure you slice the potatoes very thin. I love this recipe, but it was a lot of work. If I actually browned all the slices of potato, eggplant and zucchini, it would've taken a ton of oil. I'd say to improvise so you get everything cooked the way you like it.

Delicious!  A lovely vegetarian alternative.  I follwed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled up on the vegetables so there would enough for the multiple layers.  Instead of  pan-frying the veggies and potatoes, I also brushed them with oil and baked/broiled them in the oven until lightly browned.  I will definitely make it again, but next time I may even double up on the white sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The dish was fantastic, tasty, flavorful, and satisfying.  But the recipe needs work.  I used a 12-inch pan and frying the eggplant and zucchini took forever, 3 batches for each veggy.  That's 36 minutes at best just for the eggplant and zucchini plus the potatoes and onions.  One eggplant and one zucchini were not enough.  Double them, slice them lengthwise, and char on a hot cast iron grill pan.

This was an adventure and marathon in cooking! Too bad I did not read the reviews and roast my veggies rather than pan-fry.  Took soooo long!  When using dried lentils, cook 3/4 cup of lentils in 1.5 cups of water, add a bit of salt and simmer for 25 -30 minutes.  I found the water was all evaporated, the lentils were tender, and I did not need extra water to make a lovely, lasagna-like moussaka! Next time I will double the bechamel sauce, since I would have liked it to be more than a 1/8 inch deep. Use the best quality tomato sauce you can find, homemade if you can! I think it would be terrific with mushrooms added!

I would rate this a 5 for taste. It's delicious. We used Daiya cheese instead of the feta. It is labor intensive due to the eggplant. The oil measurement was way, way off. It calls for 1 Tablespoon, then says to add more as needed. You need about a quarter of a cup or more, just add as needed, not all at once. We omitted the sauce and it was still delicious.

Amazing dish. A little hard to follow the recipe, so I improvised a little. I would recommend broiling the eggplant and zuchini instead of deep frying it.

My son-in-law summed it up when he said, "If you've got a list of "keeper" recipes, please be sure to add this one!" 

I admit to making a few substitutions like white wine instead of white vinegar, and a few additions like fresh tomatoes instead of canned - but I'm sure it would have been just as delicious had I strictly followed the recipe.

Now that I've read other reviews, I would like to add that I agree with those who say to double the amount of veggies, roast the veggies in the oven (I had planned to do that when I make this again - and I WILL make it again!), and add a splash of fresh lemon juice to the veggie layers - I did that, and it does give it a kick.

In my opening comment, I mentioned that I had made changes and additions to the recipe. Among those changes were using white wine rather than vinegar, and fresh tomatoes instead of canned. I actually mashed-up 2 pints of cherry tomatoes since they usually have such a wonderful tomato flavor, added some finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes, green olive slices, and mushrooms. The next time I make it I will try using the veggie crumble instead of lentils (although they were good), as suggested by one reviewer.

I used jarred marinara sauce instead of canned tomatos. I roasted sliced vegetables - that were sprayed with oil in a 400 degree oven. There was no way these ingredients would fill a 9 by 13 pan. I just put it all in the oven in a smaller pan.

Made this vegetarian moussaka yesterday when we had our first snow of the season and my work was closed. It is a labor-intensive recipe but totally worth it! As others have suggested, roasting the sliced veggies in the oven is a time-savor; also increasing the amount of vegetables: 2 eggplant, 3 zucchini.
My husband loved this so much he said he could eat the entire pan of it! Nice to have leftovers to share with family or freeze for another meal. Definitely will make again soon; maybe even for Thanksgiving!

This was very tasty.  I suggest you triple the amount of veggies you're using so that you get a "fuller" meal.  As written, I only got 2 layers.  I would also triple or quadruple the sauce.

I agree with other reviewers that roasting  all the veg ahead of time saves time, oil, fat content.   It was delicious, and even better the next day.   Don't be shy with cinnamon and nutmeg in the bechamel sauce.

This was delicious!  A lot of work too!  I followed the recipe faithfully but would add that you might need more than one egg plant and zucchini.  Also, if you slice the zucchini lengthwise it works as a layer very nicely.  I think button mushrooms would also be lovely in this and I might try that next time. I also used a long wide pan, which made it flat. I ran out of veggies pretty soon and the custard layer was too thin. Make sure you use a short deep pan. Finally, to make the sauce I mixed the flour and butter together first to make a roux which prevents clumps of flour from sticking together and generally makes for a better sauce.  Meat&Potato-lovin' husband thinks it was as good as lasagne though!  That's a compliment!  I will make this again in a shorter deep pan.  Oh, and it freezes really well!

This was very good. I had zucchini and eggplant from my garden to use on a "meatless Monday".  Like others said, it is a time consuming recipe and even following some reviewers tips to decrease the effort (roasting versus pan frying ), it was an effort.  I'll probably make again on some occasion, but not for a quick meal

For a 9x13inh pan: double the eggplant, zucchini, and lentil filling, quadruple the bachemel sauce. Toast the veggies (avacoda oil) in oven at 450f for 25mins. Place eggplant down first the some potatoes, lentil filling in top of that and one last layer of eggplant. Then, out the sauce on top (I added cinnamon too) don’t bother with trying to do layer after layer. A traditional moussaka doesn’t layer like that anyway.

I followed the recipe, including quantities, almost entirely and it turned out perfect..not runny, it fit in the 9x12" pan. I added some cinnamon to the first mixture to bake, and a little more to the bechamel sauce. I fried the potatoes, but baked the eggplant and zucchini on cookie sheets (400 degree for around 15 minutes). I kind of drained the lentils and didn't add juice from the can. This is excellent vegetarian comfort food. On a chilly evening in Colorado, it tastes especially good today. This was the second time I've made this, and it won't be the last! LOVE it!!

I agree that the prep for this recipe was a bit laborious, but the end result is delicious! I used  all the veggies from my garden except for the potato! (Had to buy the potato)  Even my picky meat eating son, loved this casserole! My daughter in law shared it with her work friends at a potluck, it was loved by all!

Made the recipe as written. Was a little on the dry side when served with rice. Will definitely make it again but will add more tomato sauce and heavy cream. Made it for my vegetarian granddaughter. She really enjoyed it.

I used an 8x11 pyrex baking dish, that seemed like a more appropriate size for the amount of ingredients. I'll definitely make this again, next time I'll add a dash of cinnamon to the lentils, and double the amount of bechamel sauce.

Wonderful vegetarian dish.  My casserole dish was a touch larger than 9x13, so I doubled the "topping" sauce and I'm glad I did.  I followed other reviewers' advise and just roasted the potatoes, eggplant, and zucchini in the oven at 475 for 25 minutes (tossed with peanut oil).  I don't think it really matters what you do to pre-cook the vegees, because they're going to end up being a sort of base layer anyway.  I was worried that I didn't have enough eggplant and zucchini, as I didn't end up having several layers--it was really a single layer.  It didn't matter though, this recipe is the real deal.  I'm a huge moussaka fan, and this did not disappoint.  DO add some cinnamon to your topper sauce--it's a nice touch.  I didn't miss the meat! BTW, I couldn't find canned lentils and since I was heck-bent on making this today, I bought a can of Amy's organic lentil soup.  It worked just fine!

This was so very good. I took other cooks advice and roasted the zucchini and eggplant in the oven instead of frying in oil. I did cook the potato slices in oil on the stove. Omitted all feta (since I was out and was trying to make it a little healthier). Cooked my lentils instead of using canned (20 mins on the stove, 1/2 cup lentils in 1 cup of water). Will definitely make this again.

Didn't have any eggplant, so used 2 yellow summer squash & an extra zucchini. Had some leftover pinto beans & used those with the 'juice' instead of the lentils. Used no salt at all. Came out very nicely with a good flavor. The frying of all the veggies took MUCH longer than specified, & I had help! Will definitely keep this for use again!

How I made it Vegan :D

I substituted roasted cauliflower for feta (you could use crumbled tofu as well), blended a mix of cashews and nutritional yeast instead of parmesan, to the same consistency. For the sauce I subbed soy milk, earth balance butter, and instead of the egg, a teaspoon of arrowroot. Besides these necessary subs, I didn't do anything different except season more to personal taste. 

This takes forever if you follow it step by step, but I did it just to see how it works out. If you try to make this without a mandolin then good luck! I think if I make it again, I'll pull out my grill and grill the veggies one at a time and immediately put them into the casserole dish rather than trying to make thinner layers. I think single layers is fine. 

Since you have to work harder as a Vegan to sub and adapt more creamy/meaty recipes, I would definitely recommend this to be a comfort food dish, that just also happens to be vegan :)

Made with my veggie son, but rest of the family enjoyed it too! We baked the sliced  veg as suggested by others, and used sweet potato & butternut squash mix instead of lentils, that was a really nice addition.  left out the feta and put cheddar  & an extra egg in the topping.  Not sure if we used too wide a dish (we'd doubled a lot of the quantities) but still only had enough for  one layer of each ingredient!  Didn't spoil it though.  would do more topping next time

Made this the first time and it was time consuming but delicious.  The only reccommendation I have is to make the tomato-lentil mixture less liquidy, by either draining more of the canned tomatoes or lentils.  This would have made it less soggy.

Yes, it did every minute of two hours to prep and bake. The eggplants, zucchini and potatoes use more than the amount of olive oil recommended.  Just keep an eye as you fry them up.  I would lessen the fluids a bit so that it is easier to cut the pieces out of the pan.   I am a Greek and served it to Greeks all of whom said, "Opa!" and "Bravo!"

This is the best vegetarian moussaka I've ever had/made. Thanks so much for this recipe! I used red chilli powder instead of pepper in the lentils. Put the sauce on top and found I had to bake it for an extra ten minutes to dry out excess liquid. As another reviewer mentioned theres really not enough for complete layers. I used an 8*8 square pan and just placed the veggie slices spaced out in the pan. It filled up my pan quite well. About an inch from the top.  This was a hit!

This was great!  Really it was the white sauce on top that did the trick.  I'm giving it 4 stars simply because it was WAY too time-consuming.  I was cooking for 4 hours - with toddler interruptions of course but still.

This was a tasty, filling dish.  I cut down on the labor time by omitting potatoes, and frying the eggplant and zucchini on my grill while I sauted the onions.  Salting the eggplant and frying the vegetables before baking the moussaka kept this vegetable-heavy dish from becoming too wet, and I was very successful with the baking times from the recipe.  I realized too late that I didn't have enough feta, and so I substituted more Parmesan and some jack cheese.  I'm sure it would have been more tangy and Mediterranean if I'd had enough feta, but it was still delicious.  I've been trying to get my mother converted to eggplant for some time, and was very gratified to see her take a second helping of this dish.

This was interesting, and both people I served it to, said it was really good. The three of us finished the whole pan for dinner tonight. I have to say, though.. It was a nice dish, and I'm glad I tried it. It just wasn't over-the-top. And for all the effort that went into preparing it, I don't think I'll make it again.

This  was delicious.  My family ate it up.  I'm torn between 4 and 5 stars.  The top wasn't as fluffy as shown in the picture.  I followed the directions, so I'm not sure what happened.   I'm going to triple the recipe and serve it on Christmas.

I followed the recipe, but did as another member said and used apple cider vinegar. I also added mushrooms and I put a little extra potatoes. Instead of lentils I used chick peas, cut up. I used only half of the tin but I could have used all of them in hindsight.

I thought this was very good, but it took me a long time to make it so that's why I only gave it 4 stars. I saw the other comments and I know a lot of people said that they made it quickly. I didn't. Also what I made would have been better in a smaller pan. I was stretching it to put it into the 9x13. After all that, it was very tasty and I really enjoyed it.

Takes 30 mins to brown each ingredient. The average pan can only hold about six slices of eggplant, but the average eggplant, thinly sliced, gives you about 30 pieces. Then you have to consider that it takes three minutes per side for each six slices in the pan. By the time I was done doing the eggplant, zucchini, potatoes, and onions two hours had already passed. The next issue came the amount of oil needed to fry all of these things. 1 tablespoon is a bit of a laugh. Eggplant and zucchini soak up oil like it's their day job. At the end of everything I had used one whole cup of sunflower oil. The recipe was delicious but because of the time and excessive fats, I will never, ever make it again.

Very good, but definitely very time-consuming as written. In the future, to save time, I will steam the sliced veggies in the microwave and add them in, not fry individual slices (except for special occasions, because it does add a yummy, albeit more fattening, touch!)

This is going in the 'keeper' file!  My 13 yo ds had 3 huge servings!  I made a few minor changes.  Left out the lentils.  (I didn't have canned and didn't plan enough time to use dry.)  Used ACV instead of white vinegar. Fresh tomatoes and oregano.  Cornstarch instead of flour to make it gluten free.  And lastly, I used a 6 cheese Italian blend rather than just Parmesan.  I usually create shortcuts, skipping steps.  This time I did not and I'm glad.  The results are definitely worth the extra steps.

I added an egg to the filling and skipped the egg from the bachamal sauce. Added some cinnamon and wine to the filling. Skipped the potatoes. Wow. Delicious.

My family loved this this. My very picky 10 year old had seconds even though it was full of *gasp* vegetables. It was time consuming and a little in the expensive side to make but the results are so worth it. I did roast the veggies instead of frying just a personal preference.

So good!  Need to double all the veggies to fill the pan though, but great!  I never get tired of it.

Great recipe. I don't like eggplant so I substituted that with tofu. Get firm tofu, cut it in cubes, and also pat dry. I usually put the cubes on a plate with a paper towel and let the water drain off of it. Also, instead of putting the potatoes and zucchini in a skillet, I bake them (at 375, just like the recipe) for about 20-25 minutes. I add the tofu halfway through to get them browned.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I made this for my roommate and a friend- both die-hard carnivores, and they loved it as well. I recommend using a can of lentil soup if you can't find canned lentils (it also adds more flavor), as well as using 3-4 red potatos instead of regular white ones- it's less starchy.

Would have given this five stars, if it didn't take me two days to make this recipe!  But, it was very tasty and I would recommend this -- if you have the time.

I should have read the recipe more carefully before I started prepping because I didn't realize the tomatoes would be so crucial to this dish (I have to eliminate/substitute tomatoes from every dish I make to accommodate my boyfriend's allergy). Without the tomatoes it's more like any old casserole, but still delicious. I added some Bechamel between the layers to make up for the moisture missing from the tomatoes. It tasted like potatoes au gratin with some extra veggies. It was a really yummy dish and with the tomatoes I'm sure it would have tasted just like moussaka should.   It was a fair amount of work and time consuming, but it's worth it. Also, I ended up with a lot of food. Expect lots of leftovers if you make this.

it was good but not great. the eggplant and taters tuned an unappealing grayish color. It was a lot of prep time. Overall.......not so good it was worth the heavy prep time and unappealing color.

This is awesome! This review comes a couple of weeks after making if and recovering from the ordeal however! Pay heed to the comments saying this takes a while! Having said that the end result is totally worth it, best moussaka recipe I've made, very tasty. Next time having known what to do it will be quicker, I would not follow the directions on cooking the vegetables first but simply steam them and then put them together.

I liked this vegetarian version of moussaka! I made some minor changes for personal taste, but overall even the non-vegetarians at dinner scarfed it down. I'm always looking for traditional recipes with the meat replaced, so thanks for this one!

This was GOOD, but extremely time consuming and it fell apart when I made it…! :(  It was a little stiffer the second day.  The potatoes were also a little hard…  Sadly, the recipe is probably not worth the time.  I'll have to follow other reviewers' suggestions of roasting rather than frying the vegetables.

I wasn't sure if I was going to rate this. It took an extremely long time to prepare. I roasted some of the veggies, which did cut back on a half an hour or so of prep time. The veggies in it I love. I did have to double the veggie count. I wish I had used more potatoes. I do not understand why everyone has raved about this. It is ok. It was fun to try something different, but it did not blow my socks off. I have two children, my picky eater didn't like it but I wasn't surprised. My non picky eater though wasn't fond of it either. While it was fun to try, I don't think I will be making this again. It involves too much work for such a blase meal. I think there are better vegetarian choices out there that involve less work and less caloric intake. And the person who said it rivaled Rachel Ray's 30 minute meals must be nuts, as well as the person who said there is such a small amount of clean up. There is no way possible to prepare this in 30 minutes. It takes an hour just to cook, and all the roasting, browning, stirring, and layering are just time consuming and there is no way to shirk that.

This was a very good dish.  I have never had it before but was looking for a vegan recipe with eggplant.  I substituted the egg for egg-replacer and also used nutritional yeast flakes for that cheesy flavor in the white sauce.  The kids had multiple helpings.  I also added a touch of cayenne and salt to the white sauce and used roasted tomatoes.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

I'm so impressed with this recipe. Did make some minor changes- for some reason, I love dried lentils much better than canned. They only take 30-40 minutes to cook and you don't have to presoak. I halfed it for our small family but used more lentils and tomatoes. I added a bay leaf in the tomato mixture. Rather time consuming but well worth the effort.

This recipe took a little too long, and later I learned that I could have baked the zucchini, potato and eggplant slices.  Pan-fried slices aside this was one of the most amazing meals I've had in a while, woah amazing, we will definitely be having this again sometime soon - with baked instead of pan-fried veggies!  Thanks you for sharing this recipe!

OMG!  This is absolutely delicious.  Anyone who tasted it insisted on the recipe.  I will tell you, though, it takes a while to prepare and you'll use a TON of olive oil to brown the slices of eggplant, potatoes, and zucchini.  Well worth the time and effort, though!

I like the idea of layering these vegetables. I had too much zucchini and yellow squash in our garden; I ran out of ways to prepare them. This is a great alternative zucchini recipe. I know this is a moussaka recipe but I deleted the (bechamel) topping...last step to cut down calories and time in preparation! It still tasted great! Will prepare again!

This was very tasty!!  My entire family loved it and would give it a five star for taste.  I have to say, it took longer than I expected though, and I do weigh that in the rating.  I am pretty quick, have a mandolin for slicing, roasted the veggies in a pan in the oven to save time, and STILL it took over 2 1/2 hours from start to finish.  Of course, I did cook dry lentils, but that only took a minute to start before I started slicing, etc.  (Whoever said it took just 30 minutes, I want you to come cook for us every night!) :)  Because it took significantly longer than my usual lasagna recipe, I probably won't make this again unless requested for a birthday or something.  A pinch of cinnamon in the sauce as another post suggested was a great addition.  Also as others suggested, I drained the tomatoes and didn't include any extra liquid from the lentils and the consistency turned out just right.  I doubled the ingredients (all but the Bechamel sauce) and still ran out of veggies for layers in a 9X13, so you may want to make extras or use a 9-inch square.  Great recipe for those who have the time!

Just made this for the first time, and it was just OK. The directions in the recipe were a little unclear. I'll try it again, probably using some of the tips from the other reviews.

I love the idea of lentils in this recipe. This recipe was time consuming, and I felt it could use more seasoning, but my husband and daughter declared it a winner. So, I will make it again if they ask.

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great. It was a little time consuming browning all the vegetables, but I think it added a nice flavour and consistency. I'm going to try grilling the vegetables next time to make it healthier, so we'll see how that goes. I forgot about the feta until about halfway through the layering, but it still held together really well, and was great as a leftover. My husband absolutely loved it and he is not a vegetarian. I'm definitely going to make it again!

Everyone at my house loved this! We generally spend Sunday's together and we often use the afternoon to cook together for the Sunday dinner meal.And every time we would make the meat version of Moussaka, it would take us all afternoon anyway (as I really enjoy the eggplant slices very well baked on both sides) so the length of time involved did not dissuade me. I agree with a previous comment: good food takes time. I followed much of the advice about roasting the veggies as well as advice concerning substitutions to lower fat and remove some of the dairy (Thanks everyone!). Fresh fragrant herbs from our farmers market made this dish an event. I will definately make this again and I am adding it to my list of recipes for when company is expected for dinner!

Excellent!  Even better when reheated the next day.  It was time consuming but well worth it for special occasions.

The flavor was so-so. My husband liked it, but it took me 3 hours to cook! There are many easier recipes that taste a heck of a lot better
