Excellent molasses flavour and the raisins are a lovely perk in this bread.  I am not a very experienced bread baker so I found I had to keep a close eye on the baking time but that was just me… thanks Nadine…this is so tasty toasted with butter.

If you like molasses, you'll like this bread! In spite of several errors on my part, the loaves came out "perfect". I think the recipe bake time is off, though - I had to bake them for 35 minutes and cover them with foil @ 25 minutes so the crust wouldn't be too dark. I screwed up the recipe instructions by mixing the oats in with the flour, so I couldn't add the boiling water/molasses to soften the oats. Instead, I heated the water (1.75c)/butter (coconut oil) & molasses to 115* and put it in the pan. I then added the mix of oats, 2c whole wheat flour + 2.5c bread flour, salt & sugar in the pan, then the yeast + 1T gluten. Once it mixed for a few minutes, I shut the machine off & let the dough sit for 15 minutes, hoping it would allow the oats & wheat flour to absorb more moisture...it must have worked! I put the machine back on "dough" and was waiting for the "beep" (to add raisins) when I got a phone call. Yep - I missed the signal, and I didn't realize it until it was too late. To salvage, I added them when I split the dough into 2 loaves. With all of these changes, the bread came out fluffy, moist & delicious! I'm technically at high altitude (3800') but didn't make any adjustments for it. I do add the gluten & used "Hungarian High Altitude Whole Wheat" flour (from Walmart)- it has 4g protein like bread flour does, which might have helped. I'm going to follow the instructions next time, but I can't see how the bread could be improved! Thanks, Nadine!

This recipe is delicious. I didn't  have bread flour, so I used wheat and self rising flour. It is so good, I can't stop eating it.

My family is tough to please, and this is the first bread recipe that has gotten a big thumbs up from them, other than Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site. (Mom, quit trying other recipes, just make the rosemary bread!)

To my delight, they love this, so I can make a breakfast bread too.

Made some slight changes. They are not molasses lovers, so I used half the molasses called for, and replaced the second half with honey. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon.

The baking time did not do well for me. 15 to 20 minutes was way too short.  I ended up at 35 at 350, but it was getting a bit dark. I may try 375 for 30 next time.  Just watch it carefully.

Very moist, and I would describe as heavy, in a good way! Toasted with peanut butter on it is wonderful!

If you love molasses, which I do, you’ll find this bread to be a little slice of heaven. I don’t have a bread machine and only wanted one loaf.   I used half of the total amount of the water for softening the oats and the other half to proof the yeast with half of the sugar required.  I put it together as I usually do making other breads, but because I only made half the recipe the KA dough hook wasn’t working so well so I kneaded it by hand.  No big deal.  It was very slow rising for me, but it was well worth the wait.  It is so good! Thanks Nadine for sharing!
