Yes, very moist, but DELICIOUS!  Hubby said it's the best cake yet from this site, and I've made a lot of them.  I did, however, frost with whipped cream frosting (2 cups heavy cream beaten with one package vanilla instant pudding).  Definitely a keeper!

Great cake!  I've made it for 2 different parties, with 2 different groups of people, but the result was the same- an empty cake plate and 10 people asking me for the recipe. This recipe is never to be thrown away.

A very easy and delicious cake. Can use the leftover juice from the peaches to pour over cake.  It makes it very moist and gives it a "punch!"

The taste of this cake was nice but the best description of it is "wet"...it went way beyond moist.  No one that I served it to was overly thrilled with it.

We really enjoyed this cake.  After reading the reviews about not being very peachy tasting, I made a minor change.  Instead of adding oil, I used an additional 2/3 cup of the peach juice mixture instead.  It drops the fat content and adds more peach taste.  Also, using the icing as directed here instead of another kind adds to the peach flavor.

This is a moist cake with a good taste.  I'm giving it 4-stars as it doesn't have the rich peach taste I was hoping for.  I would make this cake again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  The sugar didn't dissolve when I let the peaches marinate overnite, so I poured it into a saucepan and boiled it down to a thicker syrup.  Then I drained the peaches.  I only ended up tossing about 1/4 cup of the syrup.  The cake was a hit.  It wasn't too wet, just a good moist cake with a nice brown crust.  The concensus was there was plenty of peach flavor.

This cake was ok at most. Didn't taste like any fuzzy navel I had ever had. Wasn't as moist as I had expected. Ok but not great.

I was good but it did not have a strong peachy flavor.  Unless you bit into a piece of peach I don't think you would know that this was a peach cake.

This recipe was VERY disappointing!  It didn't taste like a Fuzzy Navel...in fact, it didn't even have a peach flavor!  I'll have to tweek it if I'm to make this again!

I made this cake for a family bq and one for a pot luck at work.  We had the one at work first without anything added like frosting etc.  We loved it, but I felt like something was still missing.  So for the one that I was taking to the bq,I made the whipped cream frosting/pudding recipe that another reader had suggested.  It really whipped up easy and made the finishing touch to the cake.  Everyone loved it.  I think next time I will even use more fruit as I never found it too moist like some of the other people mentioned.  I will make again !!
