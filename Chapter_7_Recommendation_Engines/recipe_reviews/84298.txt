This frosting is incredible!  It's so easy to make too.  Definitely double it.  I chilled my bowl and beater for the heavy cream added the vanilla while beating it.  In a separate bowl I mixed the cocoa and dark brown sugar.  As I was whipping the cream I kept adding that to the mixture.  It's very easy to work with and it's not overly sweet.

Awesome frosting!  I did not think it was chocolately enough and so I melted 4 squares of 70% dark chocolate and whipped it in after I had tasted the original product.  I doubled the recipe because I layered two 9x13 cakes and it was just enough to frost the outside (nothing extra for the filling).  I really like the texture - very smooth and not at all grainy.

This recipe is PERFECT. I have never liked heavy, sugary buttercream frostings (or the stuff you get from the store in a can) and this is exactly the kind of frosting I love - light, fluffy, and not to sweet. I did double the recipe to fully frost my 9"layer cake (outside only, not filling, though I had a bit extra so I probably could've filled it too) and I also stabilized it by adding a teaspoon of gelatin that had been dissolved in 1/4 cup of water in the microwave after whipping. Wonderful! I'll be using this again :)

Deeeeeelicious.  Was great with "dark chocolate cake" from allrecipes.  This recipe didn't make much frosting, though, so make sure you make enough for your whole cake (triple or quadruple the recipe for a filled layer cake!)

the only reason i reserve a fifth star is because the frosting didnt have great texture or flavor when i used unsweetened cocoa. But after i substituted unsweetened cocoa for some instant cocoa mix i had sitting around, I lived it. I also used dark brown sugar since it seemed to bringout the vanilla flavor more.

Wow. This was EXACTLY what I was looking for.   Sadly.... it gets melty kinda quick so its best to use right before you serve the food its on. And I kept the cake in the fridge as well since it had cream in it.   I could eat this on a million things. I used more cocoa than called for and I used dark chocolate cocoa on top of that. I think it could a little more but I was trying to get it to match a very dark chocolate cake, so it might be okay as is on a lighter cake.   Definitely make this without hesitation!

This frosting is seriously the BEST I've ever made. My husband didn't want a traditionally thick frosting on his b-day cake so I searched and searched for something that was more airy and mousse-like. I found this recipe and decided to give it a shot and was not disappointed. I quadrupled the recipe to cover and fill a three layered cake. But I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Not too sweet, just the right chocolate flavoring, great texture.

This is great!! I'm normally a big buttercream fan and don't bake with a lot of chocolate, but needed a light chocolate frosting to decorate a darker chocolate cake.  This frosting makes me want to bake with chocolate more!!!  Nice consistency, not too sweet.  I do agree with the doubling advice if frosting an entire cake.  It's nice that I didn't have too much left over from just decorating, but it never would have been enough to frost a whole cake.

This was by far, the BEST frosting that I have ever tasted.  I do not like a thick, overly sweet frosting.  To me, this tasted like Chocolate Mousse.  I followed the directions exactly, and would not change a thing.  (Although, I may just add a splash of Amaretto next time...yummy!)

I kept seeing this recipe when I did searches for the ingredients I had on hand but I was sooooo hesitant to try it!  I've never made frosting with brown sugar before.  I finally went for it--and I am SO glad I did!  This was amazing!  It makes a little tiny amount--just right for an 8x8 size cake.  I paired this with "my mom's chocolate cake" from this site. A great combination.

I had used up all my powdered sugar on Christmas Eve and needed more to make frosting for the next morning's cinnamon rolls.  And this recipe rode to the rescue!  It was quick and easy and included the ingredients I had on hand.  Very yummy!

Had a sweet tooth and looked up a few ingredients here to see what I could make. Holy cow! I'm SO glad I found this recipe! It's incredibly fast to make and delicious! Saved it to my Recipe Box and will make it again and again... with or without a cake to frost!

I do not like typical frostings but this one is so yummy, if you like your frosting light and not too too sweet or rich. Tastes like chocolate whipped cream. mmmmmm. I followed other reviewers' advice and chilled my bowl and beaters before using them and it came out great. Very easy, and it's only my 2nd time making frosting. Also, I used this frosting to decorate cupcakes with Wilson tips and it worked well.

AWESOME!!!!!!!! Love it and I disagree with some of the other comments that it doesn't have enough chocolate flavor.  However you should double the recipe at least.  Thanks I can't wait to use it over and over again:)

Very good and takes about 5 seconds to make. This recipe would be able to lightly frost 12 cupcakes. No way could it frost a cake so plan accordingly. Only negative, some people might find the chocolate flavor a little lacking. Like others I added a little melted chocolate.

This icing came out totally different than I expected but still really yummy. To me it actually tasted like chocolate ice cream and had more of a dark chocolate taste. I thought with brown sugar it would have been sweeter. I will definitely use again on a sweeter cake than the one I used. I love how this icing kept in the fridge overnight and still tasted and worked great the next day.

This recipe deserves five stars because it turns out to be exactly what it is described to be (and it's super easy to make).  I was looking for a lighter alternative to heavy, sugary frosting -
this was perfect!  However, it is definitely not anything like what most people consider cake frosting; this is more like a thick, fluffy whipped cream (the consistency is somewhat heavier though, and super easy to spread).
And don't be scared off by the brown sugar - you can't even taste it at all, and it doesn't make the frosting gritty.

A nice change from most frostings.  Easy to make and delicious.  Just try it.... It does not make a lot, however, so try it and then make more.  Remember, we all have different tastes, so make it and you will see.........

I'm not one for the thick or overly sweet frostings, so I thought this was great!  I actually made it to go on some brownies since I didn't feel like making a cake, it was wonderful. :)

This frosting is AMAZING! It was my first frosting from scratch to accompany my first cake from scratch (a marble pound cake) and it came out wonderflly. I had to adjust the serving size a bit though. I would at least triple the original serving size to go on a nice size cake.

Very light and very tasty.  I doubled the recipe, because I have about 36 cupcakes, but I don't know that it was necessary as I am icing them fairly thinly.  For some odd reason my vanilla is lost, so I used about 1/3 of a capful of almond extract instead.  It reminds me of chocolate ice cream.  So good.

Quick and easy; tastes like mousse.  Light, but rich.  I would suggest tripling the recipe for most cakes, if not more, and possibly adding more vanilla.  Completely smooth, which surprised me (because of the brown sugar).  I'll probably use it again on account of how easy it was and because I often have whipping cream on hand.  However, it isn't the best recipe out there; I prefer one with butter.

Luscious!!  Wow!  This is the BEST chocolate frosting I have ever tasted....I have been making a chocolate frosting for years that I really like, but when I didn't have any butter or powdered sugar I went on a recipe search and found this one....Boy am I glad!  This is going to replace my usual frosting recipe....SO rich, yet so light and fluffy.  Perfect sweetness and the brown sugar is EXCELLENT in this frosting!
Thank you for a new favorite!

If you are looking for a fluffy, chocolate-y frosting, this is the one! It was perfect for my dark chocolate cake.

The recipe called for unsweetened cocoa. I used Hershey's Cocoa... it did not say "unsweetened" on it. So I wasn't sure if it was sweetened or unsweetened. Anyway, it turned out delicious! A++++!

Nevermind the cake, this is a wonderful quick treat eaten out of miniature dishes, like a dense mousse.  I do increase the cocoa.  And of course, tweak it a little to taste every time.  But oh, such a simple, perfect start.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the recipe to frost a chocolate sheet cake, and was glad I did. Tastewise, it was fine (I'm not a chocolate fan; I made to appease the chocoholic DH) however, the mediocre rating is due to the melt factor. Even whipping my cream into stiff peaks and then adding the brown sugar and cocoa, which I'd mixed together, it didn't have the stability factor I wanted. I also refrigerated it immediately until the cake had completely cooled and it still was very "melty." I didn't want a chocolate buttercream frosting today, but that was more the consistency I was seeking. Next time I need a reliable chocolate frosting, I'll use the "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" found on this site and add cocoa powder. Not that this recipe was bad; it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for today. However, I never would've thought of using brown sugar in a frosting, so I appreciated the opportunity to test this out today!

This icing is so good.  I used it today to ice the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III that I made and it was a total success!  I cook Vegan, so I just substituted Coconut Milk for the Heavy Cream and it was awesome!  Great recipe & so easy!

Delicious! I hate overly sweet butter cream frosting so I was looking for something light for my decadent chocolate cupcakes and this was perfect! It had great cocoa flavor but was nice and light. It's definitely a keeper! I also added gelatin to stabilize it and help make it last but I really think it didn't even need it.

I didn't have powdered sugar and this works good if you don't have it. However, I think the recipes with powdered sugar are much better. It did have perfect consistency and texture, the taste just wasn't there.

Not being a big chocolate fan I liked this because the flavor is a bit sharp, like a dark chocolate and not terribly sweet.  A nice choice to use with a very sweet cake.

It didn't need quite so much cocoa powder - about 1/2 T less.  But otherwise this is an awesome recipe!

Skipped the instructions, threw everything in the bowl then saw it said to whip first...still turned out great! Not a heavy, rich frosting, it's perfect for a light, sweet decadent treat!

Made triple recipe to frost 2 layer 8" round.  Was a little dry so I will add a little milk next time.  Excellent semi-sweet choc flavor.

I was looking for something quick and easy and this was both.  (My 9 year old was making my birthday cake.)  This fit the bill, but we used a little less cocoa than the recipe calls for.  It was great!
