I have made this on several occasions -- but serve it with Nutmeg Sauce.  They are awesome!
I even had to make some so my sister could share
with co-workers cause she raved about them so much! 
1/2 c white sugar          1 c boiling water
1 1/2 Tbsp flour           1 1/2 Tbsp butter
salt                       1 tsp vanilla
1/4 tsp nutmeg
combine all dry ingredients in saucepan.  Add
boiling water stirring constantly.  cook over low heat till thick and smooth. remove from heat,
add butter and vanilla.
(I find I need to at least double this recipe!)

A nice change from the ordinary, however the gingerbread texture tends to make these waffles not as light as waffles usually are.

The kids loved this when we served it as one of the dishes at our Christmas Eve brunch. It had to be the all time hit for the kids. I thinned the batter some though and it seemed to work well.

I never would have put this combination together on my own, but, wow, it's fabulous!  The chocolate sauce could have had something to make it deeper or richer perhaps--like milk, instead of water.  But, these are wonderful and very festive!

Made this for Valentines Day as I had some spare time.  The chocolate sauce is divine, and the waffles are quite nice.  Just about any waffle will get hard if you leave it sit long (these ones were no exception), but these are fluffy when fresh.  Perhaps not quite worth the effort, but my family guessed what the flavour was, so they do taste like Gingerbread.  Note that the batter looks very heavy, but it rises a lot when cooking.  I only got 5 waffles out of it; in future I will halve the chocolate sauce recipe, as it made too much even though everyone used it  By the way, I used "normal" molasses, and it was fine (what is "Light" molasses?).

I did not care for this--terribly dry and heavy with almost no taste to them. They fell apart as I tried to take them out of my waffle machine. My husband and I tasted a bite of the crumblies and there was absolutely nothing to redeem them. Thanks for letting me try.

Was not what I expected or was hoping for.  Very thick and heavy...nothing light and fluffy.  Would not make.

I made these this morning for my three kids (ages 1, 3, and 9) and no one made a sound during breakfast.  Can I tell you how rare that is?  That is how good these are!  I can't wait to make them again.

Despite what some people said, my waffles turned out to be very light, fluffy, moist, and full of flavor.  I had no difficulty removing my waffles from my waffle maker.  I am certain no chef; just a housewife, but I do not understand how anyone could have difficulty with this recipe.

NOTE:  Make sure you dissolve the cornstarch in a little bit of water before adding it to the sauce or you will get a few lumps.  I had children pulling at my legs so I skipped that step.  Then when I reheated the sauce the next morning I found a few lumps.  The only change I would make, only because of person preference, is I would use milk instead of water the next time I make the chocolate sauce a little more rich.

Good.  Not great, but good.  They are quite sweet, but that's not really a complaint from my family.  I used a belgium waffle maker and they turned out very light and spongy, but like another reviewer said, they were hard to get out of the waffle iron.  With lifting the lid, they tore right apart into sections, but that wasn't really a problem.  I'm sure I'll make these again and I will probably cut down on the chocolate sauce as it definitely made a lot.  But a nice, different waffle recipe!

Don't own a waffle iron (but I just had to try this recipe!), so I tried to make pancakes. But no matter what I did, it burned them. So I poured the rest of the batter into a greased loaf pan and made  a gingerbread loaf out of it. Worked out much better. Not burned. I served it by cutting it up into small slices and drizzling the choc. sauce on top with a dollop of whipped topping.  5 stars for the chocolate sauce!! Tastes wonderful in a cup of coffee too! 4 1/2 - 5 stars for taste of the gingerbread. 4 stars for the fact that it didn't work out for pancakes.

These were not good at all. I gave it a 2 because the sauce was half way decent and could be used on ice cream or something. They were so dense and hardened up on your plate as you were eating them. Not a make again for us by any means.

I added about 1/2 a cup more milk to help thin down the batter. With my belgium waffle maker it made 4 waffles. My kids liked them.

I didn't like these at all. I love the taste of gingerbread normally but these were too heavy with the taste of molasses. The batter was heavy too. I could barely finish one because of the heaviness and sweetness, I can only imagine what they'd be like with the chocolate sauce.

I used the nutmeg sauce of another reviewer rather than the chocolate sauce (delish!)  
4 stars for the recipie as written.  Very good, but has some issues as addressed by other reviewers.  I've played around with it & suggest the following to kick this upto a 5 star recipie: 
1)The molasses makes a difference in flavor, the darker the molasses, the more intense 'molasses taste' & the less sweet it is. 
2)Use buttermilk instead of plain milk.  This resolves the too crisp too fast issue &, imho, improves the overall texture & flavor, plus it holds together better in my experience.
3)Use heaping measurements for the spices, & add 1/4 tsp. cloves to the mix.
4)Break out your favorite wooden spoon & mix this by hand.  Just like muffins, it only needs a few stirs.
5)The batter as written is the same thickness as real gingerbread.  I add water at the end, mixing just till incorporated, so it ends up on the thicker end of waffle batter consistency-usually between 1/3-1/2 c., but mix in a T at a time rather than just dumping in the whole amount.
6)Based on my real gingerbread recipie, I tried adding a splash of brandy (or brandy flavoring)-it adds a little 'je ne sais quoi' & also try 1/2 AP & 1/2 whole wheat flour if you want healthier.
We have a regular waffle iron, I don't know if the iron makes a difference or not.  With the changes I made the results were still filling & more dense than a standard waffle, but that's the gingerbread part & to be expected.

The waffles are too heavy  and came out dry no matter how I played with cooking time and temperature, but the chocolate syrup was rather good.  I plan to make the syrup again to serve hot over vanilla ice cream.

I've made these a few times since 2002, just never rated them before.  I do add some sugar to sweeten them to our liking, and I have never made the sauce.  We usually serve ice cream over them.

We made these for a special "weekend before Christmas" breakfast and loved them!  The waffles turn out much more tender than a normal waffle, so you need to be very careful when removing from the waffle iron.  I ended up with lots of cornstarch lumps in the sauce, so had to strain it.  Also a lot of extra sauce.  Next time, I plan to save back a little of the water to dissolve the cornstarch in before adding to the hot sugar water and will also half the sauce recipe, unless I have another use for the leftovers.

Wow. This is like cake. With the choc. sauce, it's definitely like dessert for breakfast, which, if we're honest, is what waffles are all about. 

These are certainly heavier than traditional waffles - the variety is worth a try. 

We enjoyed adding whipped topping as another reviewer suggested.

As other reviewers noted, we also had trouble with crumbling, but found that if we cooked them longer until they almost burned, they came out without trouble.

Excellent! 
I used half whole wheat and half white flour to make them a tad healthier. Also, we skipped the sauce.

good taste but fell apart and stuck terribly to the waffle iron - even though it was well sprayed with cooking spray cooked the rest of the batter as pancakes on the griddle that worked

I was looking for a chocolate sauce recipe for plain chocolate cake when we had unexpected company drop by and this one looked quick and easy.  It was SO YUMMY!  Two thumbs up and five stars all the way!  The choco-holic we served this too called and asked if we send him some more.  It wasn't overly sweet, just the right amount of sugar.  I'm looking forward to trying the waffles this week-end.  Great recipe.

I thought they were excellent - though they were so rich I couldn't even make it through one! Mine came out very light and fluffy (belgin waffle maker) but I did find that they burned easily as well - be sure to check on them every few seconds, don't wait for the "done" light. The sauce is BY FAR the best part.

The 12-year old girls at my daughter's Birthday sleepover loved waking up to the smell of the chocolate sauce and enjoyed the waffles very much! I added Whipped Topping, powdered sugar & strawberries, which went VERY well with the yummy chocolate sauce - with the left over sauce we had a fruit fundue that night!

This makes the whole house smell great for a few days!  The batter is really thick and the waffles are so yummy.  I made these for breakfast,so I didn't want to use the chocolate sauce.  I used Lemon Sauce I from this site, and it was great with these waffles.  I think these waffles would be great under a scoop of ice cream, too.

Very good recipe, taking the advice of the previous reviewers, I added about 1/4 more milk, because the recipe does turn very thick. I also halved the hot chocolate sauce recipe and used 1% milk instead of water, and it was delicious. I had no problem with sticking, though the waffles are a bit soft, just handle carefully when removing from the waffle iron so as not to tear. Also, you should NEVER used non-stick spray in a waffle iron! It breaks down the coating, just use an basting brush and brush on regular oil of your choice. FANTASTIC recipe, big hit with my kids!!

The Chocolate Sauce was good.  The gingerbread waffles were heavy and filling, but ok.

These waffles were interesting. Not as good as I hoped, but something strangely appealing about them. Worth a try, but I wouldn't make them again.

Really good recipe. They are filling! Next time I will half the chocolate sauce. It made so much we only ate about a quarter of it. Goes good with Chai tea.

We liked these well enough.  I did not find they got dry or hard as they cooled, although we didn't let them cool long before eating them.  Perhaps they might be dry if they are overmixed with an electric mixer.  I mixed with a fork and left small lumps.  I though these were moist and fluffy inside.  I did find them hard to remove from the waffle iron in one piece, but presentation wasn't important to me.  I also found these to burn easily.  I set my doneness light for lowest and burned one, so then I made certain to check them before the done light came on and they were fine.

Very yummy... They were heavier than regular waffles, but quite tasty.  My husband and my 13 month old twins loved them!  They were a delightful meal for Christmas Eve!  I think they might become a tradition in our family.  

Just one remark on making the chocolate sauce (maybe many ppl already know and did something like this)... It is important to blend the cornstarch in with some cold water or milk BEFORE mixing it into the boiling water.  Otherwise it will clump up BIG TIME!  

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Oh, yes!  These waffles take an ordinary treat and make it extra special.  I have always put chocolate on my waffles, but now I always put ginger IN the waffles.

I would make this again, but I really didn't care for it with the Chocolate sauce.  In my opinion next time I'd make it with a Lemon sauce like you put on regular gingerbread.

My husband and I were so excited to find this recipe - we love gingerbread waffles. As I mixed the batter I thought I'd found a keeper, but the texture of the waffles was very weird. They were difficult to get out of the waffle iron (very soft, although totally cooked) then after they were out of the iron for a few minutes they hardened/crisped up to the point that they weren't very edible.

I made this on Christmas morning... they were really good! The combination of the not too sweet waffles and the sweet chocolate sauce was very nice. I would recommend maybe adding a little extra milk if you batter is too thick. I made them on my Belgian waffle maker for 4 minutes, and they turned out perfect. Less sauce on them is better than smothering. What a great Christmas treat!

I like the idea in concept but it came out rather dry and kind of cardboardish in taste and texture. We made it with the chocolate sauce as well as the eggnog sauce recommended by BSR2911.

This is a unique waffle that tastes great!  As another reviewer stated, they do crisp on the outside until they are quite hard, but I used a belgian wafflemaker which I think enabled the waffle to be thick enough to still be nice and soft on the inside.  Otherwise, I would say eat them right away, as they are very soft when warm.

This is one of my husbands favorites. It is very rich and unique. We like it for special occasions. And we can only eat one!! Thanks for a keeper. I do turn the waffle iron over to get it out and it just plops nicely on the plate.
