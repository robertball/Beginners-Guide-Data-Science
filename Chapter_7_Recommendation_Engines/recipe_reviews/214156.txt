This is my recipe. And I wanted to answers some questions from some of the reviewers.  The most important part of this recipe is to add the dressing to the hot potatoes. If you prefer to peel your potatoes first, it should be fine. I did it that way for years before I opened the ranch to the public.  We make this recipe for hundreds of people at a time.  Taking this step out save us a lot of time. And it gives the salad a rustic look consistent with the ranch's image.  As far as adding more calories by adding the oil, I think the flavor makes up for any extra calories.  You need less mayo for this recipe so I think it is an even swap calorie wise.   This is a recipe that you can make your own with by changing the condiments or the type of vinegar. I have been making this recipe for my family about 30 years.  I started with a bottled Italian dressing and quickly changed to my personal favorite Italian dressing.  At first I made it with corn oil, then safflower oil and finally extra virgin olive oil.   It was the first recipe I added the ranch's signature dishes when we opened ten years ago. I hope you enjoy this as much as my family has.

I took this potato salad to a cookout yesterday and it was a big hit with everyone.  Loved the blending of the various ingredients.  The only thing I did not use were the dill pickles because I was afraid it would make the salad too tart.  I do have one question, if anyone out there can answer for me.  I do not understand why the potatoes are cooked whole and chopped after.  I found this step to be very cumbersome.  When I was trying to chop all the potatoes, it mushed some of the others.  I would think it would be better to  chopped the potatoes before cooking which would save time and make the dish easier to prepare.  Please let me know if I am missing something here.  Appreciate any comments.  Awesome recipe and I will definitely make this one again.  UPDATE:  I made this salad again for a birthday party.  I cut the potatoes into bite size pieces and cooked for 10 mins. once the water came to a boil and then proceeded with the recipe.  So much easier to do it this way.  Also, I had rave reviews and some even said this was the best potato salad they had ever eaten.  Thanks for making me look like a gourmet chef!

No brainer jut like everyone we loved this. I omitted pickle(DID NOT HAVE ANY) Little more green onion and real bacon(Not a fan of bacon bits.)  Turned out flavorful. I think you could even add boiled eggs. I think this is one of those recipes where once you make the original you can tweek and have fun with new textures and flavors

Made this recipe exactly as written. Even the pickles. Very good and everyone loved it. The simplest potato salad I have ever made. The reason you want to boil your potatoes whole is that they retain a better flavor. Simply use a fork and butter knife to break up potatoes after they have cooked. I added paprika and greens for garnishment.

I followed this recipe exactly as written (except to reduce the mayo) and thought it was okay. I thought there was too much bacon and mayo. I like bacon but the amount in this recipe is a bit much. If I make this again I will just add 1/3 cup bacon bits and add more to taste. As for the mayo I was going to follow the recipe exactly as written but added the mayo gradually. I'm glad I did this and didn't just dump it in because by the time I got to 1 1/2 cups there was plenty. 3 cups would've been way too much. I recommend this recipe just add 1/3-1/2 of the bacon and mayo and add more if you need to.

I thinkthis is the BEST Potatoe recipe I have ever tried. It is a real KEEPER and will probably be the only recipe I ever use again.  My adult kids loved it. I took a sample into work for a coworker who loves to cook. She loved it. She has made it on two occasions and got rave review.  I am headed out to the grocery store in a few minutes and I will pick up my 5lbs of red potatoes so that I can make a 3rd batch for this weekend.   Bravo ranch_maven and thank you for sharing this recipe.

I have been making potato salad this way for years. Use to make with the mix but with the market of great bottled dressings it makes it much simpler.  Every time I make I add a different kind of Italian type dressing , like Roasted Red Pepper, Light Asiago and Parmesan, Balsamic, while they are hot  and let sit to absorb the flavors before adding mayo, adds a different flavor. Always come home with an empty bowl.  Also, must be a Northern thing, we add hard cooked eggs which just add to a great flavor and texture.  This recipe stands alone but when short on time, this is an alternative. Wedo not add dill pickles, the dressing takes care of that.

took this to a potluck and everyone loved it. Next time I will undercook the potatoes slightly as they fell apart with the tossing while warm. But it is  a delicious potatoe salad

I never heard of the Beaumont Ranch, but I like this potato salad. It's very different. Adding vinagrette to the warm potatoes really adds flavor. I didn't use as much mayo as called for, as the potatoes were already very moist. I put just a bit of diced pickle in to see if I'd like it, and I do. I'm adding more pickle next time. Although my husband prefers my old potato salad recipe, I'll be making this one again anyway.

I halved the recipe but otherwise followed to a T.  I almost didn't use the tarragon vinegar because I hate tarragon, but I am SOOOO glad I decided to try it as written!  This is some of the best potato salad I've had.  I'm not a big "bacon in the potato salad" kind of gal, but this stuff is awesome!!  I still have my Mom's recipe that I make all the time, but this one rates right next to it!!  Full of flavor, a perfect combination of ingredients, and tastes fresh. Love it!  Thanks for posting Ranch Maven!! I see why this is so popular at your ranch!

Thank you for sharing your special recipe, it's always an honor and a pleasure to try someone's closely guarded secret!  As a seasoned cook I took the recipe and made it the way my tastebuds prefer, (usually cheese and hot peppers)and used ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have italian salad dressing mix, but I had an herb marinade mix w/ oregano, rosemary etc., sounded fine to me.  added dry tarragon because I didn't have tarragon vinegar.  Added freshly squished garlic.  Pickle didn't suit me today, I added slightly cooked brocolli and cauliflower, real bacon, sauteed onion and I used a mixture of lowfat yogurt, light sour cream and mayo.  Then I added sharp cheddar and parmesan.  It was a little too oily for me so I added a couple extra potatoes and it was great.  Wasn't really the original after I was done but the new idea for me here was using Italian dressing over hot potatoes and letting it cool.  I love this idea, and some day I'll just cook it the way it's supposed to be cooked, if I can just remember to have the stuff on hand when I'm hungry for it!

This was so delicious that I had to post my review before I even put it away.  The only changes I made were doubling the celery and green onion, and reducing the mayo to about 2 cups, but it's just a matter of taste.  I recommend starting out with less, and then you can always add more.  I bet it will be even better tomorrow after the flavors go through it, but I have to tell you....it was just perfect right after making it, at room temperature.  Didn't even need any salt.

I did two things not in line with the original recipe - I halved the recipe and used half Mayo and half salad dressing. Absolutely wonderful potato salad!! I was leary about the dill pickles, but they add so much to the flavor. I highly recommend this potato salad. Thank you for the recipe.

Outstanding!  The key to the savory flavor is that the warm potatoes are coated with tarragon vinegar mixed with the dry Italian dressing before you start mixing everything else in.  A great base to add what you wish to make it your own.  I added 4 coarsely chopped hard-boiled eggs along with chopped dill pickles of which did not overpower it at all.  Do yourself a favor and dice your potatoes before boiling, and don't overcook them.  Also be easy on the mayo at first until you have the consistency you're looking for.  Thank you Beaumonts for sharing your "secret" recipe!  This is a keeper in my arsenal.

Potato Salad made with dry Italian salad dressing.  We liked it.  I made this for a friend's birthday party and it was well received.  I opted out on the dill pickle but used all the rest of the ingredients without tweaking.  This makes a lot of potato salad, but the good thing was it lasted well in the frig for 3-4 days.  This is very different from my Aunt's Famous Potato Salad that I learned to make before she past on, but I liked it and will make it again.  Thanks ranch_maven for sharing your recipe.

Wanted to love this...made it exactly, according to recipe...the EVO was totally overpowering to me (and it wasn't a cheap EVO).  It was much better the second day after refrigerating, but I'll go back to some old potato salad recipes....still looking for "the one!"

Loved it.  I used Olive Oil mayo instead of reg-at a lesser amount.  And, I used real bacon.  I agree with the others-adding the dressing to the warm potatoes then letting them cool before adding the other ingredients really improved the flavor.  Good tip!  I did add sea salt and pepper at the step where the dressing was added to the warm potatoes--a tip I got from a cooking show.  Yummy Yummy!

Great recipe! I made this and took it to a cookout and to was a big hit. I had to make a small change because I could not find tarragon vinegar, so I just used red wine vinegar and add tarragon to it. It was still wonderful!

this is a delicious potato salad! My husband does not like mustard at all in any form and I was tired of boring bland "mayo-only" potato salads so I searched and found this one. I made it with no-sugar-added rice vinegar and avocado oil, sliced black olives since he also doesn't like dill pickles and added bacon bits from a Costco bag. The dusting of cayenne I added couldn't be detected but just added to the deliciousness. Thank you for this recipe---oh, I also peeled my russets before boiling them.

I made this recipe last weekend for a pot luck at the beach. I don't like to tweak recipes the first time so I followed it exactly, using the optional dill pickles.  It was a huge hit and everyone wanted to know the recipe.  This will be my  new potato salad recipe after using the "traditional" one I grew up with and have used for over 30 years!

This was great!  I made the recipe for five, so basically just over a pound of red potatoes were needed.  The only changes I made: cut the potatoes ahead of time like one reviewer said, spilt the mayo called for between light and regular, and I used a little less olive oil.  I also used the dill pickle called for. It was really good and it doesn't call for the typical number of ingredients in a potato salad receipe.

We loved this.  My family normally doesn't really like potato salad or pickles, but they love this recipe. We prefered the Claussen dill pickles and chopped them on the finer side.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing

I used 10 small-to-medium size russet potatoes (did not have any reds). Figured that was about 3 pounds of potatoes, so cut the oil mixture to 1/2 amounts given in recipe (but put in entire package italian seasoning). Then added only 1 cup mayonnaise, which was plenty. This recipe is good, but not really much better than your good old fashioned southern-style potato salad with a mayo/mustard based sauce, since you basically add all the other ingredients anyway, minus the oil mixture . . . why add the extra calories, when I can't really taste the difference?

Loved the recipe and it was even better 2 days later.. to all those who mention they don't "prefer" bacon bits... I am pretty sure when she says REAL BACON BITS she means "fry up some bacon and crumble it up" being there is a picture of a pound of bacon beside it....which I did...I did 1/2 the recipe as there were only 3 of us however I used full amounts of the pickles, onion and celery..and bacon. I didn't have tarragon vinegar so I used my own home made mild flavored apple cider and added some anise (best substitute for tarragon) I didn't have red potatoes so used Yukon golds and yep left peels on!! THANK YOU SO MUCH I can't wait to share at potlucks and BBQ's this summer....PS I can see why it was a "secret"!!! LOL ITS SO GOOD

I've been making this potato salad for several years now. I omit the dill pickle but keep everything else the same.  I think pouring  the tarragon vinegar dressing on the hot potatoes really sets this recipe apart from others I've tried.

I have made this for years now and everyone requests it every time we have a cookout or potluck. I do change some things. First, I cut my potatoes first and undercook them. I always use real bacon (usually think cut applewood smoked), add some dill pickle juice when mixing the mayonnaise and use sweet relish instead of chopped dill pickles. I also use vegan mayo because of egg allergies in my circle and you honestly can’t even tell the difference. I recommend trying your own variations. This is a great base for your own perfect potato salad.

I've made this a few times both according to the recipe and with some deviations per my preference.  I've found that using vegetable oil instead of olive oil is better for me as the olive oil has a somewhat overpowering taste in that quantity.  I've also reduced the mayo.  Overall a very good recipe.

This is the easiest and best potato salad that I have ever made. The key is the Italian style dressing (I did use tarragon vinegar & light olive oil mixed with a whole packet of Good Seasons Italian though I halved all the other ingredients) on the hot potatoes & the other ingredients are easy and good additions--I used a different type of pickle (sweet & spicy horseradish pickles) but went easy on them and added a bit more of the green onion and celery and a bit less of the bacon and mayo the the recipe called for just as a matter of taste. Love it! Thank you for this awesome recipe and for giving me a new insight into how to make a more flavor-infused potato salad!

I made this to take to a potluck salad church affair. I decided to make it because of all the great reviews. Then I went and made it incorrectly. I used about 2.5 pounds of potatoes, but mixed it with all the oil based dressing. I kept all the crunchy ingredients the same, and used 2 cups of mayo. Basically I made the recipe with half the amount of potatoes so naturally it was too strong and too oily but I have to say I could tell the flavors were excellent together. I will definitely make this again with the proper amounts of ingredients and I feel it will become my favorite potato salad recipe. Now I must tell you that my own recipe for potato salad has won the vote of many people as their preference for potato salad, but I am thinking that I like this one better! Thanks for this great recipe.

Loved the flavor. I thought the spices being added to the warm potatoes was brilliant. My favorite potato salad to date. I could not find tarragon oil in either of the two large grocery stores I checked. I used some rice vinegar since I had that on hand. I'm actually going to order the tarragon oil online so I can try again. I'm curious as to how much of a difference, if any, it will make. The only reason I took away a star, was the amount of oil. It was excessive when freshly made and after sitting in the fridge overnight, it had pooled into little pockets and over the bottom of the container. Even after mixing it up again, you could still see the excess oil.  My family wouldn't even eat the leftovers because of this. I will definitely make this again, I'll just scale back the oil.

While it is a great recipe, I don't understand the need for 1 cup of olive oil.  I don;t think it need any oil, let alone a whole cup. The salad was so oily, we ended up having to throw it all out.

It was kind of bland.  I made it exactly as the recipe said but am going to add a bit more tarragon vinegar and some extra tarragon.

After reading other reviews I decided to add less mayo.  Only used 2 cups rather than three and I think that was plenty.  I also added one cup of celery and I used the pickle. It was really good after it was refrigerated overnight.  I will definitely make this again.  I think I will add some fresh black pepper next time.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was so salty that no-one would eat it.

I've made this recipe for several parties and holidays and always get rave reviews. Potato salad can be pretty blah, but people always want second helpings of this stuff. I cook the bacon myself. It's just not that hard and tastes waaaaay better than bacon bits. I also add the mayo gradually and use a splash or two more of the tarragon vinegar.
