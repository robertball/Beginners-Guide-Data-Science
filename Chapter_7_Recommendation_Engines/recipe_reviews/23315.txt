My husband is originally from Istanbul...I told him about this recipe and he said he would make it for me.  I was almost done inhaling mine when he asked if I needed a spoon...I told him I needed a longer tongue so I could lick the enitre bowl.  This dish is AMAZING.  I can't wait to have my parents over for breakfast...this will blow them away.  We usually have nice breakfasts on the weekends but I've started making this for myself ont he weekedays before I go to work!

I love this recipe, which I actually found in another cookbook. Try adding chopped, fresh parsley to the butter, and if the garlic is too strong, add that to the butter sauce, too, to mellow it out some. A few hot pepper flakes are also a nice touch if you like a little more heat. Great dish!

I loved this recipe! It is nice and garlicky. My only recommendation is to heat up the yogurt a bit so it doesn't make the eggs cold.

Great recipe. If you don't like vinegar and garlic, don't make it. I love both. This is an authentic recipe for an original Turkish dish.

Contrary to what the other reviewer wrote, I enjoyed the garlic taste. I used fat free yogurt instead of regular, however, and I did not use the full amount called for in the recipe. I also added some seasoning. I enjoyed this recipe.

I'm not a huge fan of eggs, especially poached, so this recipe was impressive. I used sour cream instead of yogurt, and cayenne instead of paprika. I used only half the fresh garlic, and it was still a bit too strong for me. The eggs were great, but the sauce was delicious, definitely the best part.  If I do it again, which I probably will, I'll use just a little garlic powder. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

I thought these were pretty good.  It is a bit unusual, and I don't like how the yogurt cools the eggs down (I like hot food to be hot), but other than that I enjoyed these.  Not sure what bf would think, but he wasn't around for breakfast this morning, so I won't worry about that.  I don't know if the type of yogurt used makes a huge difference, but I have plain greek yogurt so I used that, and the tang was really good.  I forgot the minced garlic so I just sprinkled garlic powder on top when I did remember.  Otherwise, I kept it the same.  I made 2 eggs and ate with toast.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe. I will definitely make it again. I did put a bit less garlic as the garlic I had, had huge cloves. I also didn't have paprika so I used chilli powder and a touch of masala for heat.

This was interesting. I felt that the recipe called for too much garlic and paprika. I will makes this again though, because I am sure I undercooked the eggs.

This recipe is delicious! It's rich and creamy, and nonfat Greek yogurt worked perfectly for a healthier version. Even my super-picky teenagers liked it. I will be making this again, and often.

I used homemade kefir instead of the yogurt, and even more garlic (not for the faint of heart). Added parsley and hot pepper flakes to the butter as another reviewer suggested. Yummy! Very filling.

I used more salt than the recipe called for, but the results were outstanding. I loved the garlicky tang of the yogurt with the earthy paprika butter. And I don't even like eggs!

This may be authentic so I can't give less than a 4, but I personally didn't care for the paprika in the dish.  I think I will try again making a yogurt/cucumber/garlic/dill sauce (tzatziki) which I think would be better though not authentic.

I really liked the final product! It's a great recipe as it has a lot of protein packed into it. I reduced the portions (I eat only one egg for breakfast) and I just sprinkled paprika on top as I didn't want to put butter in it.

Mixed the yogurt sauce first and early so it would be room temp, then made the paprika butter and after doing the eggs had no issues with a cold dish. Also added cayenne pepper to the butter and the yogurt. Will make this a lot in the future, and add cheese and bacon with chili powder instead of paprika.

Thank you for this recipe!  I call it my weekend “power breakfast” because of all of the protein from the eggs and yogurt.  The first time I made it, the raw garlic and lack of carbs was a little strong for my tummy, so now I microwave the garlic with a bit of olive oil to soften it up prior to mixing it with the yogurt and have a slice of toast with the dish.  Yum!  BTW, I don’t ever taste the vinegar.  It cooks off.

This dish was not for us! I don't enjoy the garlic, so I should have anticipated that taste lingering. I needed some texture in the dish. It was all too smooth and ended up being an egg-y soup.

I put the garlic in the butter as others had suggested. Cut the recipe in half and used with 4 eggs. It was plenty for the two of us for breakfast. Served with a hash brown patty. There was a lot of sauce. Next time may try serving on English muffin halves to mop up the sauce. My husband said "it's a hit". A nice change of pace from our usual breakfasts. Thanks

This was a nice twist on poached egg.  Didn't have any yogurt so I substituted sour cream.   It was very good and I will make it again.

Seriously consider using an egg poaching tray instead of dropping into boiling water.  Less mess and presents a nicer looking product.
Also, the recipe doesn't give you a set time to leave in the boiling pot.  For a semi-firm egg that doesn't  completely 'run-the-yoke' all over your plate, boil 4 1/2 min.

Well, through no fault of the recipe, my first attempt was a bit of a disaster - usually I only buy plain yogurt, but forgot that I wasn't able to find any last time I went shopping and had picked up vanilla instead. Didn't realize the mistake until I'd already started making it. My last few garlic cloves were shrivelled and starting to sprout so had to use garlic powder. Accidentally added the paprika to the yogurt instead of the melted butter. And thought I knew the technique for poaching eggs but apparently I don't. But it didn't turn out too badly (despite the weird contrast of sweet vanilla yogurt with all the savoury flavours) and I can certainly see the potential, so giving this a tentative 4 stars until I can try it again properly.

So, I don't have a photo of this recipe because we ate it quickly with smiles on our faces. somehow I 19 year old daughter had never experienced poach eggs before and took her first bite with a bit of trepidation. I had an idea what was coming but had no clue as to how wonderfully these flavors would mix together.  we used Greek style plain flavored yogurt and for some reason I couldn't find the paprika so I substitute cayenne pepper.

I really enjoyed the mixed flavor of the egg yolk, garlicky yogurt, and paprika butter. I will make the recipe again, but with a couple of changes. First, I would let the yogurt come to room temperature before starting the rest of the dish, as the cold yogurt cools the eggs too fast. Second, I would use garlic powder in place of minced garlic. I did not care for the heavy garlic taste that was released when you chewed on a raw bit of it.

I never have what I need so I improvise. I didn't have sour cream or yogurt  but I had just made cole slaw so I added the garlic to the butter and served the eggs on the cole slaw with the butter poured over. To die for! I will try the original recipe but am looking at other salads to perk up.

I made it for myself, cutting the recipe to two eggs. My partner isn't crazy about yogurt, so I didn't make the whole recipe. I thought it was really delicious and recommend it.

Delicious!  I used the recipe as a guide (only made 3 eggs).  The butter sauce combines w the yogurt & slightly runny yolk to make an incredible flavor.   Definitely make this again (and to practice my poached egg skills).  Try it!!!  (Yes, that’s Taylor Pork Roll)
