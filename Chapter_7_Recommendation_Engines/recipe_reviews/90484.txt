This is the first time I have made a fruit based sauce with meat.  My family thought this was terrific.

wonderful!  I used it with pork steaks.  I did the first half in the skillet and then when I put the sauce with it, I put it in the oven for 30 min.  It was great.

This dish was very easy to make and absolutely mouth-watering. My hubby thought the orange flavor was too much, but I did not think so. Instead of using canned mandarins, I used 2 mandarin fruit cups (drained) and I put them in at the last minute and let the whole thing simmer for about 2-3 minutes. Delicious!

Thought this was really good. All I had was pork steak so I used that just cut it up into smaller pieces. I did add a few hot pepper flakes and was out of cashews so I used peanuts. My daughter was sure she would not like this. She came back for seconds and asked if she could have the leftovers for dinner tonight.

My husband and daughter LOVED this dish!  My sons liked it but prefer grilled pork chops with A-1 (sigh).  I couldn't get Hoisin sauce at the grocery I went to so I substituted a teriyaki sauce and it was verrrry good.

I think I'll let this review go with a quote from my boyfriend, after he asked on what merit I was rating this recipe with two stars.  "I dunno, it's not bad. It's edible, I guess.  Two stars is probably fair."
