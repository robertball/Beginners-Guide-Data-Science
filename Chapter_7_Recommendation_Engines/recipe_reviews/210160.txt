Very good, my family loved it.  I marinated the shrimp in 2 tsp Creole seasoning and 1 tbsp of minced garlic for about 8 mins and added ¼ cup of sweet Mayan onion. Sautéed the two together until shrimp were done. I also increased the cheese to a ½ cup and spread 1 cup of fresh spinach on top of the pizza.  The flavors were fantastic. I also added 8 mins to the cooking time. One thing I would do next time is mince the artichoke hearts so flavors meld together and use either smaller shrimp or cut the shrimp into smaller pieces.  This recipe is a winner!!!!

Here is an easy way to make your shrimp nice and tender on pizza: simply mix them with the spices (I like to use steak seasoning), a little bit of dry starch to coat them and prevent moisture loss, and leave them there while you bake the pizza. When the pizza is about 4-6 min till done, take it out and put on the shrimp. Bake until the cooking time of the pizza is up; the shrimp should be pink in color when it's done. Take out the pizza and enjoy!

It was a good Pizza. Even my little brother (who is notorious for hating any pizza that is not pepperoni) said that it was good. I did add some extra sun dried tomatoes, and made my own low fat white sauce in place of the Alfredo sauce, but it was still a very flavorful dish, and the artichokes tasted delicious!

Fantastic!  Everyone ate way more than they should have.  I was expecting to have left overs, but no such luck!
