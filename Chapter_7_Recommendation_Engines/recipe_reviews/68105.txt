I really did not like this recipe at all.  The leek soup overpowered the recipe and gave it a funny taste.  I won't be making this again.

I thought the leek soup would make this taste differently. It tastes the same as all the other "cream of mushroom/cream of chicken" recipes. Nothing special.

Boneless chicken breasts just doesn't give this recipe much flavor; you might as well do it in the oven in less time. Bone in chicken is a whole different story. Good concept and loved the leek soup but you don't need the slow cooker for this one. Try this tho, for a quick dinner.

This is the best slow cooker chicken recipe I ever made!  My parents were over for diner and my Dad is very fussy when it comes to food.  He loved it so much that he asked me to give a copy of the recipe to my Mom for her to make.    I substituted the mushroom cream soup for a can of "Chunky" chicken a la king soup.  I also added carrots, mushrooms and cerlery in the bottom of the cooker along with the onions.  I served it on a bed of basmati rice.

This was pretty good. I used drumsticks because that'ts all I had on hand and it came out real moist, almost fall off the bone.  The consistency reminded me of a chicken & dumpling, so next time I think I will add vegetables near the end and maybe throw on some dumplings.

I thought I had leek soup mix but I didn't, but I did find Italian dressing and recipe mix, I used 1/2 onion some celery, 3 whole chicken breasts and added the .7 oz italian dressing mix and the cream of... soup and cooked it in the slow cooker and served it on rice with some fresh baked bread on the side, it was excellent!

Pretty darn good. I used fresh mushrooms, 2 oz. of cream cheese (just cause I love it) and juice from 1/2 lemon. Topped with bacon, paprika, and dried parsley.

this recipe is SO easy to put together (10 mins at most) that I really wished I could give it 5 stars . . . however, it is pretty bland. With the addition of some spices next time, we'll see how it rates.

This was good, but maybe not terribly memorable. Made no changes, and served over egg noodles.

This was a yum combo. I changed mine up a bit..... I used chicken thighs. Browned the chicken and put in the slow cooker. I added sliced yellow onion, thinly sliced leaks, chicken broth and lemon slices on top. Once completed I sprinkled with parsley. It was a hit with the fam!
