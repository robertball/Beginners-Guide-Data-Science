Partial responsibility for the failure of these cupcakes is my own.  After decades of baking I violated one of the fundamentals of baking – read the recipe thoroughly before you begin!  Not to make excuses, but I guess I incorrectly assumed that these recipes were tested before they become approved for this site.  This could not be the case with this recipe because it is off in so many ways!  Odd measurements, odd mixing method, not to mention no baking soda in a recipe that calls for unsweetened cocoa powder?  No salt?  Three and a half teaspoons of vanilla for just six cupcakes? Just half an egg? To put this in perspective – if you were to double this for 12 cupcakes, or better yet, double it again for a 2-layer or 13x9” cake, if we talk just about the vanilla you’d be using almost five tablespoons! And the rest of the ingredients were off too (was this recipe guesswork?). I was too far into mixing up the dry ingredients to quit, as I didn’t want to waste ingredients.  I tried to remedy this by adjusting the ingredients and their amounts but trying to mess with the science and chemistry of baking is not a good idea.  Even with doing some trouble-shooting the cupcakes turned out badly – which I expected.  Lesson learned – if you’re midway through a recipe and you KNOW it isn’t right, quit while you’re ahead and do not proceed.   The cupcakes were never frosted or decorated - in fact, they were never eaten.

Tried and tested. This is just not the correct way of making a good chocolate cupcake. Did everything the instruction said but no. It didn't work out.

I have tried this recipe, Like you I did not read all the ingredients before I started. As these were baking I finished reading the recipe and your review. My cupcakes however, Turned out okay. They are actually moist and edible. Would I ever make this recipe again? No, probably not as they may be edible they are not that great...

This is just plain wrong. The chemistry was off by a lot, nothing edible or worth eating in the end.

As with the other people who made this, I found that the dry ingredient to wet ingredient ratio was waaaaaay off. Was able to frankenstein together an edible cupcake, but it ended up being closer to a brownie consistency instead of a nice, light cupcake. Definitely will never make again

I started combining ingredients and thought they seemed off, so I made some changes based on my late in the game perusal of the comments here.  I thought one egg was just not enough, nor was water going to cut it. Knowing that the sugar wasn't going to disolve in the minimal wet mix I also added milk and increased the margarine.  I will not be making this again in this manner......it deserves ZERO STARS .  If you are reading this and see comments too late to stop, I hope you know how to switch it up to fix what could be a wasteful mess.

I used a 1/2 a handful of mini chocolate chips instead of a candy.  Next time I will double the recipe so that my muffin cups will be over full but overall, they turned out fine.  Instead of icing I also used a touch of marshmallow fluff.  Made them even fluffier!
