This recipe is fabulous!  I used fresh deli salsa, all fat-free ingredients, the leanest turkey available, and dark green Romaine lettuce.  Be sure to squeeze the spinach dry and chop it up, if you use the whole leaf variety.  I also chopped up the salsa, cumin and tomatoes, using a stick blender before pouring over the enchiladas.  My husband's eyes got really big when he saw it and he said, "You mean we can eat this and still lose weight?"   He thought it was some of the best Mexican style food - and he lived in Mexico for awhile.  It was so good, we could hardly stop eating long enough to say yum!!  We have both been watching our weight and lost a pound each the next day!  Oh my, this was even good cold, when we had some for lunch.  One of these filled me up for hours.  Love it!  I might make more sauce next time.

The enchiladas are terrific! My husband couldn't get enough. My cousin also had some and just e-mailed me for the recipe. They were a little time consuming but well worth it. They are yummy!

I think this was really good, but I think I would add a packet of taco seasoning.  I thought it was a little bit underseasoned. I layered the tortillas so make a lasagna type dish, and I thought it was really good

This dish was surprised me and my friends!  We loved this recipe!  My friend was surprised that the filling was ground turkey and not ground beef.  The flavor was wonderful.

I thought this recipe was just okay, but my roommate loved it! He wanted more, but I just made two servings! I will be making some adjustments next time, including: taco seasoning, my own salsa instead of the tomato mixture, and maybe a little more cream cheese because they weren't creamy enough for me. It's a very nice recipe, and very easy to modify to suit your likes and dislikes.

This was very good. I used fresh spinach, did not use cumin, and used cheddar cheese because I had it. Beware not to eat the filling (it's good) because the amount is very presice. You will have left over tortillas if you do!

Not too shabby.  I made this recipe for my step-mom, who's dieting.  We all liked it though.  My preschooler ate one whole enchilada herself.  I used nofat extra-fiber flour tortillas because that's what I had.  Next time I'll try steaming some chopped, fresh spinach because it's so much better than frozen spinach.  I think that change might take this recipes up a notch.  ;)

WICKED GOOD! I'm not a big fan of mexican food, but I loved these. I added hot sauce to the meat after it was browned. I made the whole meat filling and froze half, baking only 6 enchiladas... perfect dinner for 2 (my guy ate 4!)

Wow...so simple but sooo delicious.  I didnt have the spinach on hand and used flour tortillas and fresh tomatos instead of canned.   Soo great!  Ill add other ingredients next time to experiment.

I thought this was delicious! I used flour tortillas instead of corn becuase I had them on hand and added some taco seasoning. You couldn't even tell that it was turkey instead of hamburger. Very good.

Yum!! I thought all of the flavors were delicious, and didn't feel that one overpowered another. Simple to put together and tasted great! I couldn't find no-salt added salsa, though, so I had to use regular.

My boyfriend and I loved this one.  We used canned tomatoes and jarred enchilada sauce instead of the suggested salsa topping.  Was really tasty!  Will definitely make again.

This was an EXCELLENT and easy recipe. I used my own enchilada sauce over the top and inside, and it was great. I also did not add the spinach (I didn't have any on hand) and only used 1/2 a package of cream cheese. They were still excellent!

I will not be making this again.  I agree that the recipe is low in fat, but it does not taste like enchiladas.  The cream cheese was way too much, and it did not taste like a Mexican dish.
