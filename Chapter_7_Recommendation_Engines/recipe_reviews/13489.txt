If you want more of a candied yam where they almost look fried around the edges, then reduce the amount of sugar and butter. Too much sauce drowns the potatoes and they overcook in too much sauce and start falling apart, become liquidy and mushy. So many recipes call for too much liquid, reduce by half and make sure to cook your butter and sugar first for carmelization, then add your potatoes. Make sure there is just enough sauce on the bottom of the potatoes and NOT half way up. Then they become candied.

I saw another reviewer say that after it was done...didn't want to make again because of the work.  I had the complete opposite reaction.  We liked these so much that I would definately do these again.  Don't get me wrong, it is time consuming...but we believe they are totally worth it.  Do be careful because they can burn.  We found french vanilla cool whip and ate this as a dessert the next day  (yum leftovers).  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful side dish!  These are so much like what I enjoyed at holiday time when I was a kid in south Ga.  My recommendations are: 1)Yams and sweet potatoes are NOT the same thing. Use sweet potatoes if you can find them.  However ,if only yams are available, substitute and make this dish anyway, because although the taste is not the same, the result is still very very good.  2)Even though this recipe is designed to create a very sweet dish, it calls for more sugar than is necessary.  I start with HALF of the sugar and ALL of the spices.  As the sweet potatoes cook, I taste and add more sugar as needed, and I usually only add a tablespoon or two.  3) Make sure to turn the sweet potatoes about every fifteen minutes, to coat them well on both sides.  As they cook, they become very tender, so be careful in turning them because they will easily fall apart.  This does not affect the taste, but it does affect the presentation.  This is also a good reason to cut the sweet potatoes at least 1/3" thick-- the thinner they are, the more likely they are to break. 4) Try to remember to add the vanilla at the end.  I forget so often, and the dish is still very nice, but the vanilla adds alot.  I've dealt with my forgetfulness by leaving one vanilla bean out on the counter, and I'll throw it in the pan sometime during the last 10-30 minutes of cooking.

This was a really nice recipe. I forgot to put the vanilla in at the end and also put just 3/4 the amount of sugar (half white and half brown) as some of the previous reviews said the recipe might be too sweet.  I served this to a bunch of brits that had never had Sweet Potatoes like this and it was a hit!! Oh yes, I also cooked this in the oven in a heavy cast baking pan with foil on top rather than a skillet.  I cooked for about 35 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius.  I would make this again.

First time I ever made sweet potatoes, and everyone thought they were delicious. I found, though, that at the end of my hour, the sauce was not carmelized but very liquid, so I removed the potatoes, as they were fully cooked, and simmered the remaining liquid with the cover removed til it carmelized and then poured it back over my potatoes.

Excellent recipe! Much easier than the way I made them in the past. I needed a large dutch oven sized pot to cook six sweet potatoes though. I left them in large chunks so they wouldn't disintigrate while cooking. The addition of vanilla is awesome but my family doesn't care for cinnamon and nutmeg in their candied sweet potatoes, so I added the zest of one small orange which added a nice flavor. I've made this twice now, once with the yellow "sweet potatoes" and once with the orange "yams" (though I guess they are all technically yams, my mom swears there is difference and only buys the "sweet potatoes"). The yellow ones came out firmer, the orange yams got mushy.

This was an excellent recipe. I did not find it to be a lot of work, except for the peeling and cutting of the potatoes. I did make a few changes. I used brown instead of white sugar. I also melted the butter in the microwave and hand tossed it with the potatoes in a large bowl to make sure they were well coated before placing them in an electric skillet and sprinkling them with the sugar mixture. Once the sugar and butter melted together to make the sauce(set at 300 degrees), I turned the skillet to WARM and cooked them covered that way for the hour,stirring them a few times to ensure they were well coated with the sauce. Absolutely divine and held their shape and texture just fine. The sauce can look a little loose, but thickens upon standing. Also, you can take the potatoes out of the skillet, then pour however much or little of the sauce  you prefer over them. This one will go into my recipe box!

This is similar to how my mother-in-law taught me to make sweet potatoes. The first time I made candied yams, I selected this recipe as a guide because the proportions were dead on to what I remembered my mother-in-law telling me. We do this differently by using brown sugar or a mix of brown sugar and white sugar. We also add the sugar to the melted butter at low heat and stir to make a caramelized sauce. Be careful not to burn the sugar. Also, don't remove the mixture from the heat for too long (the sugar will get hard and your sauce will be lumpy). When the sauce has caramelized, add the potatoes. If the sauce sizzles when adding the potatoes, its too hot, reduce the heat and continue to stir. Otherwise, keep adding the potatoes and stir for a few more minutes as the water from the potatoes thins out the sauce. Then just let the potatoes simmer in the sauce at low heat until done. This recipe is good, but I think these changes make it a 5 star, although it is a little more work.

This was absolutely delicious and so easy.  I've been trying different recipies for 25 years., this is the winner.  I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  My kitchen smells wonderful.

This is the only way to make authentic southern candied sweet potatoes.  My mother always boiled the sweet potatoes in the skins and always overcooked them.  She would then cut them length wise and they would fall apart.  When I got older a girlfriend made them this way and I've been making them like this ever since.  I omit the cinnamon and use more butter.  Most of the time I just layer the ingredients and dot with butter starting with butter on the bottom of a very heavy pan or pot.  Calphalon always works for me or a heavy cast iron skillet with a lid.  Make sure you turn the fire down real low and watch them carefully.  Sweet potatoes always make their own water and with the sugar and butter you never need to add any liquid.  The best recipe for sweet potatoes or yams, ever!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!! The reviews are correct!!! I did get confused about if I needed to add water, but since the recipe didnt say to add it, I didnt.  The sugar and salt pulls the water out of the potatos and makes more than enough sauce. I did sub part of the white sugar for brown sugar, but I didnt measure anything, thats just me. If this is your first or hundredth time making sweet potatos, try this recipe, you wont be disappointed.

Easy recipe - Turned out perfect.  I did change a few minor things.  I reduced to white sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added a 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I did not add the vanilla because the taste did not seem to need it.  I cooked these in the old southern tradition by using an iron skillet.  It made the presentation look appetizing.  This goes in my recipe box as a keeper.

Flavor was good, but there was an awful lot of liquid which I ended up cooking down. I do think the potatoes need to be cut very thick as they will fall apart if too thin.

5 stars for delicious and easy!  Didn't add the vanilla because honestly, I didn't think they needed it!  One thing to note--other reviewers mentioned that the potatoes fell apart.  If you slice them thick (recipe never specified how thick to slice), you won't have that problem, and they'll still cook enough.  YUM!

Very, very good. Exactly what I was looking for in candied sweet potatoes. Very sweet and rich and tasty. I used the fresh sweet potatoes in the store (the orange ones) and they really cooked up well. My only recommendation is to chunk them or slice them very thick (1/4" or thicker) because they break up too easily otherwise and the presentation is lost. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I made this for Christmas and everyone commented on how it was the best candied yams they have ever tasted. I was very proud. I added one more stick of butter. Hey, it was Christmas!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and my in-laws raved about it!  Both of their Grandmothers used to make this when they were kids.  It does take a long time to cook but it makes your house smell wonderful!

My search is over!!! These are just like the ones my grandmother would make!! I tried to make these last year with yams and they were very stringy and un-enjoyable. This year I found sweet potatoes. My grandmother always made them so they were hard around the edges (I don't know if she fried them 1st) but it was sooo good. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white. I doubled the spices and cut the sweet potatoes in inch size pieces because it's more heart warming and pleasant if you take the time to cut them. No one wants a big bulky potato in their mouth. This dish tasted even better 5 days later!

Made this delicious recipe for Thanksgiving. I gave it 4 stars, because it was way too much sugar. I would definitely recommend cutting down the sugar by one cup, but still used the rest of the seasonings as directed. I added some pecans as well. I will add this to my recipe book!

I found that I can do this a lot easier when I have so many other Thanksgiving dishes to make.  I put the yams or sweet potatoes in a heavy sauce pan and added one cup of water.  Then added all of the ingredients on top of the potatoes.  I covered the pot and put the flame on medium to low.  As it slowly cooks, the flavors are absorbed into the yams/sweet potatoes.  This produces more sauce that we later put on top of southern style corn bread for a late night sweet treat.

This recipe is very similar to the one my mom makes.  She bakes the sweet potatoes instead of stove top, and we use 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar. Great, simple southern recipe.

I do wish potato recipes would list the amount of potatoes in pounds rather than a number, because sizes vary so much.  Before I found this recipe, I had already gotten four very large sweet potatoes (not yams) for the recipe I usually use, and they were more than enough.  I wouldn't have been able fit any more than that in the skillet.  The only change I made was to use one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white.  The sauce did not thicken as much as I expected, but they were still very good.  This is a great way to conserve oven space and have easier control over checking for doneness.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! Truly "candied" just like Grandma's. This is a really sweet dish. Not at all like the sweet potatoes you find baked with the marshmallows that people usually call "candied yams". The candying gives them a different texture. These are the real thing, just what I have been looking for! Thanks for sharing, this is a real treasure.

I've made this many times and have adjusted as following: Use half brown sugar and half white sugar. Also, cut down the amount of sugar to about 1.5 cups total. Since the slices break easily, I just mash them up with a masher. This helps soak up the liquid, too. Thanks for sharing Pam!

Excellent. This how sweet potatoes are supposed to be. Y'all with "southern" sweet potatoes they are supposed to be saucy, juicy or runny. So, don't try to boil or get rid of the brown sauce, if you want, just pour some or all of the sauce off. Cut the SWEET POTATOES not YAMS(looks like a sweet potato, but kind of stringy when cooking) in bigger chunks. I have eaten sweet potatoes for years and they are supposed to be SWEET, SAUCY and MUSHY or mashed.

These were delicious! I was kind of worried about letting these simmer for so long, but they turned out great. I wouldn't go as far as to say they "candied" but still the end result was a delicuious side-dish of sweet potatoes that went really well with glazed ham.

I have trouble getting this to consistently turn out right, but when it does, it is amazing. I think the variance may have to do with the yams themselves, or perhaps I cook it slightly different each time, I don't know. . .in either case, it's a good starting point.

This was my grandmother's recipe, although I suspect that she never followed one.  Each year I have to come back and look it up, this time it is going in the family book to give to my grandchildren.  I make mine in an iron skillet just like Grandma Russell did - adds to the flavor...ok, it's my story and I'm stickin' to it.  This is a wonderful, easy recipe.

This dish was very delicious but extremely runny.  I took this dish to a family gathering and everyone raved over the flavor, but like I said, it is extremely runny.  I even tried broiling for a few minutes but it never carmalized like it was supposed to.

This dish was very delicious but extremely runny.  I took this dish to a family gathering and everyone raved over the flavor, but like I said, it is extremely runny.  I even tried broiling for a few minutes but it never carmalized like it was supposed to.

Very easy to make and came out so good! I was so happy that the syrup was not runny at all like with other recipes I have tried in the past. I added a handful of pecans while cooking. I will be making this for Christmas dinner this year! Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago and it was a hit. This year I was assigned the sweet potatoes again and was able to find the same recipe. Everyone loved them and said they were much better than the store bought kind. I used 7 large sweet potatoes, added some brown sugar in place of all white, and sliced the potatoes into large pieces to prevent breaking. They produced lots of their own liquid and took almost 2hrs on low on the stove top. Still a success in my book!

I must say that this is the best Southern Candied Sweet Potatoes recipe in existence. I made them a few days before Thanksgiving to test the recipe for quality and taste. I shared them with my neighbor who wasn't a big fan of candied yams. That is until now, he is begging me to make some for him for his family's Thanksgiving dinner!

Yum!!!!!  I've made this dish a number of times and always get rave reviews.  I made it again today and had NO leftovers!!  Usually there is enough for a side dish for the next day, but not this time.  I followed the recipe exactly - and like others I've forgotten the vanilla a couple of times, but usually remember before serving.  The only alterations that MAY need to be made is the cook time, cook until candied, which may be a little longer or shorter than noted.  Be careful when coating and turning the sweet potatoes so as not to break them up - you want candied sweets, not mashed sweets. Kudos Pam!!

I made this with yams instead of sweet potatoes. I didn't have sweet potatoes. My husband and I really enjoyed these.  I didn't have to cook them for an hour.  Probably only 45 minutes.  They were a perfect side dish for our Thanksgiving meal.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was the only new reciped I added to my Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a huge hit!  I only used 3/4 of the sugar mixture and it was super sweet.  The cooking time was nowhere near what the recipe stated but I sliced the potatoes relatively thin.  Great recipe. Will use it again.

Wonderful recipe! Candied sweet potatoes have always been one of my favorite side dishes.  I have made this dish several times now, and each time the results have been perfect.  If you're big on presentation I would suggest cutting the sweet potatoes in thick slices, and be gentle while stiring.  They tend to get very soft while cooking.

Keep your eye on these or they'll get away from you.  Everything was going great, but I started talking to a guest and wasn't paying attention and poof, they burned.  But the part that didn't burn was really good.  I like sticky, somewhat hard on the edges, candied sweet potatoes, and these were just that.  I did have to remove the lid about half way through because the potatoes were getting too soft.

Made this recipe for Sunday dinner and it went over great.  I don't like sweet potatoes myself (even after making this), but my boyfriend and brother agree that this is a wonderful recipe.  I couldn't believe how EASY it was.  I did slice my potatoes into about 1/4" slices and they looked beautiful in the brown sauce.  All you do is slice the potatoes and put them in the sauce and basically forget about them until they are done.  SUPER EASY!!!!!

Great easy to make candied sweet potatoes.  I made these for Thanks Giving and had to make them again for Christmas.  The little bit of vanilla really makes the difference.  Great recipe, Thanks.

Delicious!!!  Don't change this recipe one bit :)  Wonderful as is--without omitting or adding ingredients.  Note--the smaller you cut the potatoes, the quicker it cooks.

Most times I like to have multiple layers of flavor in a dish and this can be problematic with candied sweet potatoes. This recipe however captures this and is the best candied sweet potatoes I ever had. The potatoes will accompany any main dish as a great side and I don't think you will be disappointed.

This dish came out really nice, the cooking time was a little off because the slices almost got too mushy. I also used some grated orange peel and that gave the dish a nice twist

I have made it a couple of times now. As listed the recipie is big on sugar and butter.  I cut it the sugar by about ? cup and the butter by a couple of tablespoons and it still came out sweet with plenty of flavor!

Followed the recipe exactly.....very easy and so tasty. I've always made the same sweet potato dish and decided to change it up a bit for today's Thanksgiving dinner at my family's. Everyone absolutely loved it. Will definitely become part of my "turkey dinner" repertoire!
Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I too substituted 1/2 the call for white sugar with brown sugar. I'm glad I did it too. And thank God the dish turned out to be perfect--not too sweet. Cut your sweet potatoes at least 1/3 inch thick or they are sure to break when turning them. Delicious side dish made just the way grandma used to do it,

A great recipe that was simple to make.  I made a few revisions after reading the reviews, reducing the amount of sugar and butter, and using brown sugar instead of white.  My daughter, who has never liked sweet potatoes, really enjoyed these.  I will be making these often!

These Candied Sweet Potatoes (Yams) were wonderful and got "rave reviews" at the "family Do" celebration we had today, Christmas in other words.    Loved them myself.  :-)

These Candied Sweet Potatoes (Yams) were wonderful and got "rave reviews" at the "family Do" celebration we had today, Christmas in other words.    Loved them myself.  :-)

I did something wrong.  The flavoring was very good, but they just ended up being very mushy.  Next time I am going to caramelize the sugar, then add the potatoes.

This recipe was delish!!  I substituted brown sugar for the white and it came out perfect.  Made these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit with the family.

Made this for a big family dinner on Christmas.  It got rave reviews!  I did add about 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  This is definitely on my holiday meal keeper list.

Turned out great!  I didn't have trouble with burning at all, in fact I think I was being over cautious b/c I had to turn up the heat to thicken the sauce and cook the potatoes slices more.  And you would not believe how easy it is to forget the vanilla!!  Still turns out great nonetheless.

Nice change from the way too sugary marshmellow stuff!!!!  This focuses much more on the sweet potato flavor and is not super sugary!

This recipe is great!  I've had people who claim that they do not like sweet potatoes ask for seconds and thirds!  I now use this recipe instead of mashed sweet potatoes--and it's on my thanksgiving menu.

Very good! I added 1c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar. I combined the sugars, spices, vanilla and butter in saucepan. I boiled the sliced sweet potatoes until they were almost cooked through, drained them, then layered them with the glaze in a 9x13 pan and baked them covered for 30 mins at 350.

My husband said for me to throw away all the other sweet potato recipes. I hate it when people change the recipe and then rate it. I used the ingredients as written. I did not have time to follow the cooking directions so I cooked the potatoes in water in the microwave for about 12 minutes --until they were semi soft . I then followed the directions as written simmering the potatoes in a skillet on the stove for about 15 minutes. This cut the cooking time in half and still yielded a very tasty side dish.

These were the best sweet potatoes that I have in my 50 years on this planet! They were perfect in that they were tender (but not too soft) in the middle and perfectly crisp around the edges.  No more mashed yams with marshmallows in the top for this family!!

I've had candied sweet potatoes in the past and this was over sweet for me.  There wasn't much canalization surrounding the potatoes. It was more sauce than caramelized goodness.   I ended up taking the remaining sauce and rendered it down with toasted pecans.  That helped it but still just okay.

Found this recipe years ago and it's been my go to ever since. Everyone loves my sweet potatoes! I make them every Thanksgiving and I'm asked by friends and family to make them for other events. Very simple and very yummy!

Perfect recipe! A cast iron skillet is the secret for crispy candied edges that aren't scorched.  I prefer sweet potatoes, because they are heartier for the long cooking time than yams. Splurge on real vanilla, and be heavy handed with it and the cinnamon!

I used fresh sweet potatoes and added a touch of brown sugar.  The recipe was a hit and I will definitely make them again.

Awesome recipe ... I made this with only one change ... I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar instead of two cups of white ... it came out perfect ... I would suggest cutting the potatoes in thick chunks so they do break apart too easily or become mushy !!

I normally used the canned yams and doctored them up and put them in the oven. This recipe was far more easy than what I used to do because i didn't have to constantly take the pan out of the oven to stir the potatoes. I made it for Thanksgiving this year and it was gone in a matter of seconds.

I changed this recipe (a bit) and it's now a required dish at Thanksgiving!

Cut sweet potatoe slices into fourths, put into baking dish so the dish is 3/4 full. If using 8 potatoes a 10" square works well.
>Mix dry ingredients on the side but replace half the white sugar with brown sugar and cut nutmeg in half. Set aside.
>Melt butter (stove or microwave) and add vanilla. Mix. Pour over sweet potatoes. 
>Cover potatoes with dry mixture. 
>Cover dish with aluminum foil.
Bake at 350° for one hour. (I turn the oven off and let it stay in there until I need it.)
Remove from oven and remove foil, then...
Top with marshmallows and broil until marshmallows brown. 

It's hot but you will enjoy!!!

This recipe turned out great!! I used yams and based on other reviews, I was worried about overcooking. I used half the sugar and cooked uncovered for part of the time. They came out really well. Sweet, but not too sweet. Really yummy! Good recipe!

I was hoping to replicate the side dish made by my sweetheart's aunt, what I didn't anticipate was that she would think that it tasted even better than her aunt's sweet potatoes. This one gets added to the yearly list, we love it! Cheers!

I made these potatoes twice. The first time I read the reviews and reduced the butter, used half white sugar and half brown and they were great. The next time I did not remember the reviews and made them as the recipe stated and they were swimming in sauce...they were like boiled sweet potatoes and they were terrible.

I sliced the sweet potatoes sliced thinner to help them caramelize better and have some consistency in cooking time, and I don't use as much sugar and butter, and caramelize them first then add sweet potatoes. I use a non stick skillet, which helps. If you have kids that do not like sweet potatoes try this recipe.  Plus it's a step in getting kids and adults on their way to liking sweet potatoes if they don't already.

I've made sweet potato casserole before, but I really prefer candied sweet potatoes.  This recipe was so easy and tasted great.  The cooking time was shorter then the recipe called for but that's probably because I cut my yams smaller.  I made my sugar mixture a couple of days in advance and cut my yams the day before and stored them in a zip bag with as much air removed as possible.  This was my first attempt at candied yams and I'm saving the recipe, everyone love them.

I just made these for Thanksgiving dinner and they all went. That's unusual because my group doesn't typically go for this dish and I only make it because it's a traditional Thanksgiving dish. I had read over quite a few recipes before I settled on this one so I decided to go half granulated sugar and half (dark) brown sugar. I used 8 big yams but it was still very saucy, not that anyone seemed to mind! I prepared them stovetop in a really big skillet so they weren't at all overcrowded and stirred about every 10 minutes, they were done in about 30 minutes. I transferred them to a glass serving bowl and kept them in a warm oven for about 3 hours before serving. Since they were so easy and such a hit I will probably stick with this recipe. Thanks!

Cooked yams in crockpot for about 3 hours on high with 1 cup water.  Cooked sauce on stovetop, added to crockpot and cooked for another hour. My new favorite way to make sweet potatoes - loved the cinnamon & nutmeg flavor.

Followed the ingredients in this recipe to a "T" and it came out very good!  The only thing I changed was that I cut the sweet potatoes into chunks instead of slicing them to make stirring while cooking easier.  Great for Easter dinner!

This dish was simple and perfect. My family and I love sweet potatoes. But a lot of time they would purchase the canned sweet pirates and prep that way. I'm actually making a second batches because the first was devoured in one day. I chose to omit the nutmeg and use 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar as previous review. #Delish definitely a staple side dish for our family holidays. Thanks you!

Loved this recipe! Made it for my family Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I was even surprised it turned out so tasty. I was fearful of having my potatoes crumble or be underdone, so I did stick with my usual method of washing and boiling the potatoes first. I monitor them by pricking with a fork for doneness. I cook a lot at a time, so softer ones get used for pies since they will be mashed anyway and the firmer ones I use for the recipe. Boiling first means once they cool, I can peel almost all of them by hand, the skin raises up and just comes right off. It's stickier, but easier than peeling raw. I used half sugar and half dark brown sugar like some of the other comments. I put the sliced potatoes in a baking dish, poured a little of the melted butted over them, the rest of the butter went into the sugar mixtures. I then gently incorporated the sugar butter mixture into the potatoes so that they were covered but not handling them too much so they wouldn't break up. I then covered with foil and put them in a 350 oven. I'm not sure of timing, maybe half hour then I uncovered for nother half hour or so. Mostly I just "eyeballed" it. I removed when the sugar was brown and bubbly. There may be small clumps of unmelted sugar coating, but it makes a nice addition and texture. This is especially good if you have to heat it in the microwave because it will then melt down more. I love vanilla, but forgot it! No problem...these are sweet and flavorful. My new go to recipe!

Loved the end result, though I did use others' advice and cut the sugar down a bit, also swapping in brown sugar, rather than white.  I hate peeling hard sweet potatoes, so I microwaved first to slightly soften and peel.  This made the cooking time much shorter.  We did not have any leftovers, but this was a bit like a dessert, rather than a veggie side.

Loved the end result, though I did use others' advice and cut the sugar down a bit, also swapping in brown sugar, rather than white.  I hate peeling hard sweet potatoes, so I microwaved first to slightly soften and peel.  This made the cooking time much shorter.  We did not have any leftovers, but this was a bit like a dessert, rather than a veggie side.

I made this recipe yesterday for our Labor Day cookout today. Let me tell you what I did right off the top because I sensed 2 c of sugar was too much for my liking. I used three medium sized sweet potatoes and reduced the sugar to 1/3c brown and 1/3 white. I cooked them in the oven in a casserole dish covered with foil for one hour which allowed the lightly sweetened, yet delicious syrup to penetrate each quarter inch thick sweet potato, making them nice and yummy . Aside from that everything else I followed to the letter.  These are by far the BEST candied sweet potatoes I've had in my 42 years on earth! I will be making this recipe my default for all upcoming holidays and I am so thankful that I found this recipe that uses common cupboard items. I wish I could rate it 10 stars because it is truly worthy.

I got great reviews, I did make some changes,I melted 1/2 cup of butter,and used Bruce's yams,and put them in a crockpot,and cover the added melted butter,and sprinkled remaining ingredients over top,stirring occasionally. Everyone liked how sweet they were.

Amazingly delicious but they take forever. Do this for you and your immediate family - making enough for more than 2 or 4 people is hugely time consuming!

This recipe turned out perfectly. It was my first attempt at making homemade candied yams and it was definitely worth the work!!!  I slightly modified the recipe by adding a tablespoon of dark brown sugar.  Everyone loved them at dinner!

Excellent side dish. My whole family loved them. Didn't have nutmeg so used allspice instead. If you like soft potatoes like us, slice thin.

delicious! I loved the fact that it cooked on the stove top.  I did cut down on the sugar and used brown instead of white.  I used about a cup of sugar instead of two.  otherwise, I followed it to a tee!!

This was an easy break from regular Russet Potatoes. The only thing I would have done different was to slice the potatoes a little thicker. I used the side of a grater and they were too thin. I will certainly make this again.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  The result was wonderfully tasty, but when the sweet potatoes were done, there was still some runny liquid in the bottom of the pan. A slotted spoon solves the problem easily.

These are so good! I've tried other sweet potato recipes but this one is certainly a keeper.  I omitted the nutmeg because I didn't have any but the end result was still fantastic.  I received lots of great comments on this dish Christmas day.
