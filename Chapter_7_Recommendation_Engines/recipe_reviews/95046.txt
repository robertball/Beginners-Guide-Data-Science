This soup is great, and it makes a TON!  I initially forgot to serve it with the pesto, and I thought it was good, but the addition of the pesto makes it remarkable.  I added 2 T. of Italian seasoning as well.

Tasty!  I also sauteed some garlic with the onion and sprinkled with shredded parmesan cheese before serving.

This was delicious!  One of my first few attempts at making soup, and it turned out great!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the potato, and substituted cooked orzo in its place.  I cooked the orzo separately, then just put a spoonful in the bottom of each bowl.  I thought the orzo went more with the Italian soup idea than potatoes...  But definitely a do-again.

Good, healthy soup!  Makes a lot.  Used both white and sweet potatoes.  Also, added Schwans mini pasta blend that has red pepper, corn, peas, carrots and mini bow tie pasta.  Added the pesto into the soup - gave it tons of flavor.  Used unsalted chicken broth.  Smells good, too!  It's on the winter soup rotation.

This soup hit the spot! It was just what I was hoping for. I added some basil to the olive oil and garlic to the onions. Definitely would salt and pepper it more if I could go back, this time I didn't and ended up adding some to my individual dish which really made it flavorful. I also threw in some cooked acini di pepe pasta, but the soup was good by itself as well!

This really needed something.  I added garlic and a little Italian seasoning but it was still missing something.  Maybe it was the potatoes.  I left those out in favor of whole wheat seashell noodles.  It was still pretty good though.  And yes it does make a ton!
Update:  All it was missing was time.  I had some for lunch today and it was unbelievable.  The flavors really meld together well.  My preschooler, who refused to eat anymore after her two no-thank-you bites last night, begged for her own bowl after tasting mine today.  Her eyes got huge and she pronounced it delish.  I do however wish I had stuck with my instincts and froze half of the batch.  If you cook the starch (potatoes or noodles) separately the soup should freeze beautifully.  Then just add noodles after you unthaw your soup.  There is no way we can eat all of this before it spoils.

Outstanding! I added some squash I had handy, and a bit of garlic powder. For the pesto, I used the Pesto del Sol from this site, but the soup was also excellent without the pesto.

Healthy, tasty, well balanced, and very filling recipe!  I made minor modifications based on other reviews and personal preferences, but the recipe would have been great without any changes.  I sauteed 5 minced garlic cloves with the onion, I used a vegetable broth since I am a vegetarian, I cooked orzo separately and added some to each bowl, and I put the pesto directly in the pot (6 spoonfuls).  My family ate this for dinner for three days in a row and never tired of it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Wonderful, and so healthy!  Be SURE and use the pesto, or it's not that flavorful (I used lowfat pesto, and it was great).  Also, chop the spinach first, or it will be a little messy to eat.  I used 6 small white potatoes (wasn't sure how much a pound was without a scale), and added 1 1/2 tsp. salt + 1/4 tsp. pepper to the soup.  Perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious!  Rarely is a recipe perfect as is - but this is definitely one of them!  My husband didn't want to try it and found other things to eat because he didn't want to eat soup.  Then for some reason, when I was eating the last bowl (it lasted for a few days), he took a bite when I walked away.  He was so upset that he missed out of the whole pot and asked me to make it again right away!!  I will do that for sure!

I halved the recipe but used 4-5 cups of broth and it came out just right. As others have said, it definitely needs some seasoning (basil, oregano) and a good amount of pesto. With some parmesan cheese on top, really good!

Loved it! Made some changes based on reviews and what I had: - took out celery and peppers and peas - added garlic w/the garlic and leeks with the other veggies - used one can cannellini beans and one can butter beans - added dried oregano, basil, parsley  YUM!

WOW! This soup has such a depth of flavor it is amazing! I did use 5 cloves garlic, allowed soup to simmer for a few hours and stirred about 6 spoonfuls of pesto into the soup just before taking off the heat as suggested by a few other reviewers (do not add canned white beans until 15 - 20 minutes before end of cook time or they will break down). I made soup 1 day ahead so the flavors had ample time to marry and develop.

This recipe is top notch. I have made it as written and with a couple of changes (black beans instead of white and corn & edamame instead of peas). Also, I only use homemade stock.

This soup is awesome.  I used blue potatoes and added corn.  The kids now call this Rainbow Soup, and it's a perfect name!  Great recipe.  I also top with shredded cheese or sour cream for the kids, who like creamy ;).  I leave those extra calories off for myself.

I was surprised how quickly this soup went together -- I had it on the table in about an hour.  I mixed a healthy dose of pesto in with the soup (rather than using as a dollop/topping).  I cut the potatoes into large dices so they would hold up to freezing/reheating.  I'll definitely make this soup again.

A spectacular recipe!  I was running late and the kids were starving but this came together in a flash.  I admit I was worried it would taste bland but the pesto made all the difference.   Heed the comments below about making the potatoes/pasta separately so you can freeze it because unless you are feeding a group of people you are going to have soup left over.  While I loved it with the potatoes I'll bet it will be good with pasta too so I'll try that next time.  This one's a winner!

This was a great soup!  The flavors melded really well together.  I didn't put in the carrots (didn't have any) and forgot the peas but, it didn't harm the flavor at all.  I didn't use the canned beans and soaked my own.  Next time, I will use maybe 4 cups more of liquid because the beans and potatoes soaked up what I did put in.  Also, like others, I used Italian seasoning.  I will definitely be making this for many winters to come!  Thanks so much!

Very good. Since I did not have any pesto on hand, I added some dried basil and oregano with the first of the vegetables and used vegetable broth.

This is probably one of the best soups that I have ever had. I cut the recipe in half and the only thing I changed was adding 1 extra cup of chicken broth. The pesto gave it wonderful flavor. Excellent.

Had to add a lot of salt/pepper for taste.. Was not impressed with overall end result. Also, recipe stated that it made 10 servings and I got 5 decent sized servings out of..making the overall calories not worth the effort for the final result. However, if I do make it again NOTE the pesto is essential!

This is a great soup.  I just added a small jar of pesto (I doubled it for a potluck) and it wasn't too much.  I also added sour cream to my son's to cool it off and it actually tasted like a very yummy cream soup.

As it is written, it is a decent, solid starter recipe.  However, I made changes related to my preferences (and that recipe I'd give 5 stars!!)  I found the spinach to be overwhelming and stringy, like seaweed.  I found the potato to be lack luster and bland.  The changes I made are simple, and I think, make it better.  Cut out the pepper and potatoes and replace with 1 zucchini, diced, and a lb of sweet potatoes, cubed.  Decrease the spinach by at least a half (if not more) and chop before putting in the soup. The outcome is VERY good.

Enjoyed this recipe!  I threw in a few extra veggies from our garden.  I also added garlic to the onions and used fresh basil from the garden.  This is a good soup that can be prepared using whatever veg you have on hand.

This soup is fantastic! I use sweet potato instead of regular. I omit the celery and bell pepper.  I also use vegan pesto (basil, olive oil, garlic, nutritional yeast) and if you use a vegetable broth, it is a totally vegan recipe.

Nothing special.  If anything, we felt that there is too much going on in this soup.  Nothing stands out because there like 20 things in it.  I did however make my own vegetable stock first, which was awesome; as always.

Wasn't sure if I would like this because there is no meat in it... but WOW!!  Fantastic!  Omitted the potatoes and added cooked whole wheat orzo pasta like other reviewers.  I am going to eat all 10 servings myself!

This was my first time to cook a recipe from this site. I had some ingredients and my wife suggested I put them in the ingredients search and this recipe popped up. This is delicious soup. I changed a few things with the recipe. I added a 1/4 of white wine and a teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper. I added chicken which I sauteed in olive oil and garlic (1 tbls) first and then added another tablespoon of garlic to the onion as I sauteed them in the soup kettle. My wife added little parmasean cheese after I had put the soup in the bowl. THe soup was complimented nicely with a dry white wine and a New Belgium organic wheat beer!

This is a delicious soup!  Highly recommend it!  I love the pesto in it, really made it tasty!  Makes quite a bit. Followed recipe and only added a tablespoon of minced garlic.

This not a vegetable soup - it's a  vegetable BEEF soup. I don't eat meat so I left it out. It was  not bad, but nothing to write home about.

Will definitely make again.  My husband gave this a big thumbs up and from someone who prefers meat and doesn't like soup then that's a real endorsement.

Simple enough to make and the pesto gives the soup a nice twist.

I added mushrooms and put the pesto right into the mix.  This allowed for meals to be prepped for the week vs. having to add for each serving.  I also used canned carrots vs. fresh because I was out of fresh and it worked out.

This was an amazing, hearty and flavorful soup!  The Pesto adds so much flavor that this is the first Italian soup that I don't feel the need to add Parmesan cheese, which is miraculous for a cheese lover.  My family goes vegetarian at least once a week, so I used vegetable stock.  Also, to make it a rounded meal with whole grain, I only used 1/2 lb cubed potatoes and about 8 oz of cooked whole wheat mini farfalle (bow tie) pasta and a few more splashes of broth - about a cup.  This makes a lot, so I cooked up turkey meatballs for the leftover soup on our non-vegetarian days and lunches.  Wow!  This is a keeper.  My first time to review a recipe, too.

I thought this was a great recipe and my daughter loved it too.  Like another reviewer, I added 2 T Italian seasoning and I salted and peppered the veggies when I was making it.  I used about 1/4 cup pesto give or take a Tablespoon.  Very good.  Thanks!

I didn't add potatoes or peas, but I did add homemade pesto to the pot once the soup was cooled to serving temp.

This soup is easy to make and has a very rich taste. I made the recipe as posted on the site. The bell pepper didn't really add anything to the soup and next time I would use frozen bell pepper strips if at all.

My husband and I reallyliked this recipe.  I added the pesto right in, and added some chopped yellow squash, green onions and hamburger.  I will be making this again for our next family gathering.

thanks!

This was a good basic recipe that needed "something"  Hubby and I liked it but felt that it was missing something that we couldn't figure out.  It was a little bland.  I added garlic to the onion when cooking and added some parmesan cheese too.  Will make again but will probably change up a few things.

This soup was very good with the addition of basil.  I added some leftover roasted chicken, too, and made a meal out of it with some toasted bread.

My husband and I DEVOURED this soup.  I can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow!  The changes I made were based on necessity more than anything else; I needed to use what I had on hand.  I added 3 cloves of crushed fresh garlic and used a frozen mix of onion, celery and red pepper rather than the fresh.  I put in a whole 9 oz. bag of fresh spinach and a ginormous dollop of chicken flavor Better Than Bouillon.  I did NOT put in any salt and pepper (the BTB was salty enough)but did add a generous teaspoon of Italian seasoning.  I also tossed about two tablespoons of the pesto directly into the soup. I didn't use potatoes OR orzo and didn't miss it one bit. I threw all the ingredients together and let simmer for about 15 minutes then turned off the heat.  I let it sit on the stove for a couple of hours before dinner to let the flavors meld and then gave it a quick re-heat before serving.  I sprinkled it with fresh parmesan and served it with a slice of Uno's calzone and a green salad.  Yeah, baby!

This is a superbly delicious soup! I used another reviewers idea of using orzo in place of the potatoes.  It worked well.  Definitely don't forget the pesto.

This was good, but I made some changes. 

I used turkey broth instead of chicken and escarole instead of spinach just because I had them in the freezer.

I also used a mix of red and yellow pepper and omitted the peas. I used a can of pinto and cannellini beans.

I found the soup to be a bit bland so I added some dried basil and some red pepper flakes in addition to the salt and pepper.

I added a couple of cups of cooked orzo and a sprinkling of grated asiago. I also served it with a side of garlic bread.

TFS
 
ETA-Make sure you double or even triple the broth if you are going to add cooked orzo.  It will use up all the liquid

I thought this was an "okay" recipe. The soup itself was very bland. The pesto did add a nice touch, but there was nothing special about it.  I will not make this again, and will try adding some Italian sausage to the remainder of this batch to liven it up.
