Will definitely make again. Quick & easy weeknight dinner for me with leftovers for lunch. I used an entire 17 oz bottle of mild pico de gallo doubled the cheese and used Pampered Chef's Chili Lime Rub spice mix. I cooked mine on a medium temp heated the beans beforehand and hand brushed each tortilla with sunflower oil. I have a fickle stovetop and am waiting patiently for a new one. I added cheese on top of each cooked tortilla. The only thing I would change is adding freshly chopped bell peppers!
