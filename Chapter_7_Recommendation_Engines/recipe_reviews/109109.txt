WOW, these really are delicious!  Couldn't find raspberry sherbet, so I used raspberry sorbet which I think gave these pops an even deeper/fruitier raspberry flavor.  They are creamy (not too icy) with a real burst of fresh raspberry.  You really taste the fresh fruit.  Definitely will be having these often this summer, probably experimenting with some other fruit flavors.  And as an added bonus, they're low in calories and fat.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

I used strawberries instead of raspberries because of cost.  It was still delicious!  Otherwise I went exactly by the recipe.  I always do the first time.  The only thing I might do differently is keep some of the fruit chunky or whole....My preference.  Creamy and fruity and refreshing on this 95 degree day.  Thanks for the recipe!

It really isn't a popsicle, because it doesn't get as hard as a popsicle. It was fine, my kids liked it but I thought it was a bit too sweet and just kind of an odd mixture of ingredients. The picture shows 3 different layers which is pretty, but I followed the recipe which had me mix it all together, so it was all a light pink. I won't bother making this again.
