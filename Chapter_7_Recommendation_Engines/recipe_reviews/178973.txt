Very nice for a light dish.  I strained my NF yogurt overnight, to thicken it. I also added a pinch of red pepper flake with the salt and black pepper.  I added some cubes of browned blsl chicken breast, which I sauted with fresh minced garlic (probably 4 cloves) and some minced onion, in a couple of tablespoons of evoo.  We've had richer, more flavorful alfredo, but for a low cal version this was very good.

This is going to be my alfredo recipe from now on!  It is much lighter than the cream cheese kind or the recipes with heavy cream.  I used greek yogurt which makes it nice and creamy.  Delicious!

I have to agree with the rest of the one-star reviewers.  Yogurt, as an ingredient, causes a bitterness. I tried using sugar but it didn't work.

To make this creamier and yummier, use greek yogurt--even non-fat greek yougrt is far thicker than regular yogurt. Add more garlic too...I like this recipe as a good base to work from.  Thanks!

I really like this recipe! Like some others, I used Greek yogurt instead of regular. I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. This is a fantastic lo-cal alternative to regular alfredo sauce!

I also used yogurt and it turned out very bitter an inedible. Thankfully I tasted the sauce before I mixed it with the pasta. I ended up saving about 1/2 C and throwing the rest of it away, making a tomato-based sauce and mixing a little of the bitter cream mix in, which was just OK. I can't imagine what other kind of yogurt would make this recipe good.

This was a great light alfredo recipe. I used a greek yogurt for a lighter taste.  It was great, even the kids ate it.

I used minced garlic and Karoun (mediterranean style Kefir cheese) which is a spreadable yogurt cheese or I also used chobani plain greek yogurt They both turned out great. My small variation I did, was add fresh basil and grape tomatoes before serving(instead of parsley) it was AMAZING!! Even my kids loved it!

The real key to this recipe to make it taste really good is using GREEK YOGURT!!!  I used FAGO Brand which is so creamy I have even used it to make low calorie and healthier desserts!!!  I really liked this for a good low calorie healthy Alfredo Sauce and will definitely be using it routinely.

I think next time I have pasta and no sauce ingredients I would just do butter & Parmesan. This just didn't work out.

Yes, it's much lighter than other recipes, good with greek yogurt, but you have to be careful with the pepper, I guess that's the reason why didn't came up ok for some people, 1/4 teaspoon can be too much, so add little by little. And I would add a more cheese too

Just made this and loved it. I used Wonder Flour instead of regular flour and habanero cabot cheddar as well as 2 laughing cow garlic & herb cheese wedges. SO delicious with noodles, spinach, red pepper and onions!
