I agree with the other poster - these didn't taste very much like cheesecake. Also, my cookies flattened and spread out. That might have been my fault, though. My 1/2 cup was dirty so I had to estimate on the oil and I think I might have added too much.

I'd like to try the recipe again but change a few things, like instead of cheesecake pudding mix, putting in some actual cream cheese. I also wonder if using sugar cookie mix is the best. It seems to be a weird combination with the cheesecake mix.

These really didn't taste anything like cheesecake. The dough was very thick and the cookies took longer to bake than the recommended 8 - 10 minutes. There are OK as a basic thumprint cookie.

I've made these several times and love them! I haven't had the issues the others have had, they are pretty easy to make. I agree about not tasting alot like cheesecake but you do taste it. I like the recipe as is... I do put extra shaved chocolate on top.... YUM!!
