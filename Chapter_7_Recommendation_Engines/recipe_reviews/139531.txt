I just threw this recipie together - very easy!  I changed the creamer to a fat free version but other than that followed it to a "T".  It was economical to make and the taste is pretty good, especially for homemade.  I think I wll try other versions too.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using "less sugar" chocolate drink mix. I like this mix better than most that call for powdered milk because it has a stronger coffee flavor to me. In fact, I used more than 3/4 cup water, but adjustments are easy fixes according to one's taste preference. This is a great chocolate fix too for just a few calories.
