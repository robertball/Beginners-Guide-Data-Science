This was way too strong as a dressing in my and my husband's opinion, but we used most of it as a marinade for flank steak and it was incredible.

So delicious!  Very tasty without overpowering the salad. Also great as a marinade for grilled prawns and chicken kabobs.

Not bad, but make sure you use reduced sodium soy sauce!  Too salty if you sub the regular stuff!

This was a little too strong for a salad dressing, however I marinated chicken with it. Then a couple days later with beef..... I was very yummy.  I also added a little more garlic. I loved the added zing of the ginger.  Will defiantly use again.  Thanks!

I think this is a wonderful combination of ingredients, but I had to change the proportions for our taste. I found the dressing as written to be too salty (even with lite soy sauce)like others  have said.
To fix this I added extra rice vinegar, lime juice and a little olive oil  and  honey .  I used it to dress shredded cabbage with raisins and it was a hit!

I had to come back and update review.  I ended up adding some fat free miracle whip and blended it up.  It became a wonderfully creamy, nutty, flavorful dressing.  But nothing like the original recipe though.

I thought this was excellent.  I made it to accompany an Asian salad at Easter.  I left out the chili oil -- didn't have any.  Probably added more lime than it called for.  Nice and tart, and yes, salty.  Yum.

I loved this.  But I don't like soy sauce much, so I used about 1/3 of a cup, then added 1/2 cup of water to the dressing.  This was great on a cabbage salad.  I had leftover dressing, so I added peanut butter and some veggie broth and made a veggie rice-noodle dish topped with peanuts.  Great!

A little crazy on the soya sauce, even though I cut the amount suggested in half. I found it a very, very salty dressing, not something I enjoyed much on a salad. I compensated this time by adding a whole lot of fruit to my salad, but I probably won't make again. Thanks anyway.

We also used this as a marinade for flank steak.  Used 1/2 the amount of soy sauce and all other amounts the same.  Didn't bother blending the mixture, just put the ingredients into a ziploc bag with the steak and froze it...pulled it out, thawed and marinated it during the day and then threw it on the grill that night.  Easy and delish!

i really enjoyed this.. but then again i love strong pungent foods.. i only had regular soy sauce so i cut the amount in half and then added some water.. about a quarter of the original amount.. but followed everything else to a T.. i just chopped everything up as fine as i could get it as i had reduced this to 1.5 servings (my math) so it would obviously be too small to put in a blender.. i had it over a cucumber that i sliced up and de-seeded..  very yummy.. i could totally see how this would make an awesome marinade for meat.. ty for the recipe

This a great salad dressing and marinade.  I substituted Bragg Liquid Aminos for the reduced sodium soy and found it to be the perfect touch.  I used it to marinate my tofu in and then I heated in a bit more of the dressing/marinade and served it on a salad with sesame seeds that I had toasted with garlic paste.  Yum....

Great recipe. I server this with a nappa cabbage and whatever veg I'm in the mood for(red peppers, radish, etc.) salad.  Seared tuna goes well on the salad.

Great as a marinade and dressing.  If you don’t like it as a dressing cut it with some mayo and it’ll turn into something you’re use too.

Made it with less soy sauce, (1/3 cup) 1 TBS of freshly grated ginger root and 1/4 tsp of dried ginger (for less bite). Quite tasty.

I wanted the sesame oil, rice vinegar, and ginger to be the star flavors so I halved the low-sodium soy sauce then omitted the chili oil and onion powder because I didn't have any on hand.  Delicious!!

This was GREAT! I read the reviews before I made it, and I used half the soy sauce, 1/4 cup water, and 1/4 cup jalapeno juice (the juice that comes in the can of jalapenos).  It was awesome!
