This is by far one of the better potato salads I have had. Most are just smothered in entirely too much mayo or mustard. This recipe had just enough mayo/sour cream mixture to lightly coat the potatoes so that you can still taste all of the other ingredients. Here's a tip for the bacon. Line a lipped baking sheet with foil and bake your bacon along with the potatoes instead of making a mess of your stove top. 400 is the perfect temp for baking bacon and  it only takes 15-20 minutes and can be cooling and draining while the potatoes finish roasting. On the note of bacon, that is the one change I made. I chose to crumble the bacon over the top right before serving instead of mixing it in with everything else so that it would stay crunchy. That is just a personal preference for me though. This one is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Roasting the diced potatoes really gives this potato salad a different flavor...a really good one! I enjoyed everything about this salad. My only complaint is that I made this about 3 hours before dinner, and by the time we ate, it had soaked up too much of the dressing. Next time, I'll either add the dressing right before eating, or I'll make a little extra dressing to add in right before serving. I also roasted some cauliflower and used this exact same dressing on it for a delicious low-carb cauliflower salad.

I have always been very picky about potato salad due to my distaste for hard boiled eggs. I have seen a similar style one to this in the deli section of the supermarket and wanted to make my own. I was hesitant to try this due to baking the potatoes rather than boiling them; but decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. This is the best potato salad I have every made and is better than similar ones in the store. I halved the recipe because I was unsure how it would turn out. After tasting it I wished I made a whole batch. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!!!  I believe I will need to add a bit more of the sour cream/mayo mixture just before serving but upon tasting, it is fantastic!!!  Followed recipe exactly!!!

So yum! I didn’t really make any changes aside from just adding a little bit of leftover bacon crumbles on the top. It was a big hit with friends and family! I’ll definitely make again.

Didn't change anything, and it was delicious.   However, after it rested in the fridge all day, it was a little dry and not as creamy as I hoped when I went to serve it.  Like another reviewer suggested, I'll make a little extra dressing, and reserve 1/3 of it to add right before serving.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love this, especially at my house where husband hates hard boiled eggs and kids hate mustard.  This is a potato salad that no one complains about!

Instead of diced onions I sliced the onion and once the potatoes were on the pan I made rings out of the onions, put oil on them and covered the onions with them. I let the potatoes get the flavored by the onions. I also used more sour cream than maya. 3/4 to 1/4.  I did use the bacon but I also used bacon bits on the top when done. Delicious and everyone loved them.

This was a great choice for potato salad.  I love my regular salad, but it’s very time consuming to make. This was a really nice change and didn’t take near the amount of time.  It will go well with burgers on the grill!!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!

This was a hit with a family gathering. I didn't use as much mayonnaise, maybe a tablespoon but the flavor was delicious. The potatoes had to bake much longer too, about an hour and 15 minutes, to get them softer.

I made this using medium-sized red potatoes and followed the recipe.  My potatoes did take a bit longer to bake, but that's because I had them in a cold refrigerator before baking them.  We did like that it didn't contain eggs for a change, and the dressing wasn't overwhelming.  You can change this up to fit your own personal preferences.  Very nice!  Thanks for the recipe!

This may not be the healthiest of recipes, but it sure is delicious! I liked the texture of the potatoes being roasted, instead of boiled, and the dressing didn't seem to consume the whole salad. I chose to add diced red bell pepper for extra crunch, and it made the salad very enjoyable. I highly recommend taking this to your next BBQ or potluck.
