I just finished baking & tasting the Butter Pecan Bars. I changed the recipe due to the ingredients I had on hand.  I used self-rising flour instead of all-purpose and I added 3/4 c. choc. chips to the mix. I made sure the sugars and butter were creamed to a fluffy light color. The final outcome was terrific. I can visually see the inside is soft and the outside is chewy. I cooked for 40 min. in a 350 oven.  I had some pecans I wanted to use up and I am glad I found this recipe. Thanks!

Too good. I made these for a tough crowd-we have several wonderful amateur cooks and one or two culinary professionals. Well, they all hovered over this plate of pecan bars and asked for the recipe.
Be sure and let the recipe cool before cutting into bars-less mess.

I made these for a cookout so I decided to go ahead and double the batch and cooked in a 9 1/2 by 13 1/2 pan and cooked for 50 minutes and it could have cooked for another 5-7 minutes to be perfect. I even accidentally put in a cup of walnuts and a cup of pecans (oops, I thought the bag I opened was pecans)and everyone still loved them not even noticing the difference.  Will definately make again.

So yummy!  These bars took a lot of patience and tinkering with the timing.  On my second try I baked for 60 minutes at 300 degrees and it was just perfect.

I'm not sure what I did wrong here.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The bars were way too thick and never got completely done, even after cooking them 10+ extra minutes.  The recipe sounded great and I really wanted the bars to work out, so I made a second batch and they turned out the same as the first batch.  They definitely need to be in a bigger pan than 8x8.  I was preparing the bars to take to a party.  Even though I wasn't happy with the results, I took them anyway.  They didn't turn out pretty, so it was hard to get people to try them.  Those that did try them, said they liked them, but there were a lot left over.

These are good. I wanted them to be more chewy. I cut the flour down by a 1/4 cup. Added a cup of pecans.  Bake them in a 300 oven for 50 mins, in a 9 x 13 pan. I liked them much better this way. Thinner and more chewy.

These were really quick and easy!!!! Didn't even pull out the mixer,mixed it all by hand.I did use a larger pan,which probably made them not as gooey,but they were very good and everyone loved them.As we have 16 pecan trees these will be a keeper for sure.

Wow! What more can I say? I actually RUINED these by adding chocolate pieces- it made them unbearably rich! Plus, in my opinion, they were no where near as good when you got a bite of chocolate with the bar- and I LOVE chocolate. The pieces without the chocolate were incredible! I will be making these a lot in the future- WITHOUT THE CHOCOLATE!!!!:)

This was absolutely wonderful! It was easy to make, tastes delicious and even my seven year old liked it. I used butter flavored crisco instead of butter and it turned out wonderfully. I'll make this many more times!

Since I found this recipe two weeks ago, I've made it four times. I really love it. I like it as is and I like it with coconut. I have found that I need to bake it significantly longer than the recipe says, but that isn't enough to make me give it fewer stars. Here are my personal preferences: use chopped pecans, use 1 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and no white sugar, use 1 cup coconut, throw in a pinch of baking soda (about 1/4 tsp.). That combination works for me!

Oh my gosh, I could tell you this recipe by heart. Everyone in my family loves these except for me. I have had to make these over and over again in the last few weeks. My sister said all she wants for her birthday are these lol! Im not to big on them though. I followed the other reviewers advice and cooked mine at 300 for 60 mins and then let them sit in the oven for about an hour. Im sure this is a recipe that will be in my family forever now.

Unfortunately, mine were not gooey as i had hoped for, but nevertheless this was a great recipe and they were still chewy. i cut down the white sugar to 1/2 cup and added some choc. chips and walnuts and the flavor was awesome. i think next time i will only bake for 35 min. maybe that will make it more gooey will definitely make again..thanks :D

Mine was a mess!  I baked it for about 50 minutes.  The edges were pulling away and the top was brown.  However, all but the perimeter was a raw mess.  I had to throw the whole thing away! I know others loved it, so I reviewed the recipe to see if I had done anything wrong. I followed the recipe to a tee.  Big Disapointment.

these bars taste just like pecan pie. I used a 9 by 14 inch baking dish and they were easier to get
out of the pan than the smaller size, since they are gooey.

I took the advice of a previous review and cut the flour. lowered the temp and extended the cooking time to make the bars extra chewy and they turned out very well. My only issue with them was they were a little bland for my taste. I think if I were to make them again I would add some toffee chips to liven the taste up a little.

So delicious and rich, but tend to come out a little goopy sometimes. I've made these for several years during the holidays, and the consistency is hard to get right. This year was the worst. I don't know if I will make them again.

I made this in a larger pan, because others complained about it not cooking well enough.  I ended up overbaking it so it didn't turn out well, which is my fault.  Regardless of that, the flavor was pretty good, they tasted like pecan pie;  but they didn't have the jellyish texture of pecan pie that I like so much, so I doubt I'll make these again.

I baked the bars for 12 minutes longer than the said. They were gooey but more like raw cookie dough. The flavor was great - Anything with so much butter and pecans would be!I would not bake them again.

Yummy.  I made the mistake of letting my husband take them out of the oven for me.  He took them out too early i think.  The middle was caved in but the outside part was cooked.  The middle was extremely gooey.  Next time I will cook them longer, it still tasted excellent.Michele, ontario

These were so quick and easy to make.  Soft chewy, rich like pecan pie.  I made a double batch and adjusted the pan size to 11"x 13" and baked about 50 minutes. Sent them off to work with my husband and they are asking for the recipe.

I made these as shown and they were GREAT! In my oven they came out gooey in the center of the pan and a little crispy along the edges.  A little bit of everything for everyone--I'll make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I think I should have read all the reviews before trying this recipe.  Mine turned out like a couple of others and were too gooey.  I even baked them longer than the recipe specified.  I'm a pretty seasoned baker, and I'm usually sure when a dish is done but this one completely deceived me.  The toothpick came out clean, the center bounced back from the touch, and the edges were browned, but as the dish cooled, the center collapsed.  While I am a fan of half-baked cookies, that was not my impression of this recipe.  While the taste was pretty good, I doubt I would make again.

I really liked the chewiness of these bars.  I just feel that something is missing.  Maybe I'll try adding some chocolate chips or butterscotch chips.

Easy to follow recipe. When it came out of the oven, I thought it was going to be like a big cookie, since it looked hard and crunchy on top. And then I cut it! Ooh, the yummy gooey goodness! I added semisweet chocolate chips, which actually helped cut the sweetness of it. It is a seriously sweet recipe!

These were a huge hit with my family. I've made them several times. They remind me of a Pecan pie in a bar! Baked at 350 for 40 minutes.

YUMM!  As another reviewer suggested, I baked these at 300 degrees for one hour and allowed them to cool in the turned off oven.  I also added 3/4 cup chocolate chips and 3/4 cup butterscotch chips.  Next time, I think I'll add some coconut.
This is definitely a keeper recipe.  My family loved them!!

Not very tasty, bland flavour, a bit greasy.  I followed the recipe to a T, and I wasn't impressed.  I won't make these again.

I am a relatively new cook and I found this recipe easy and the taste is to die for! You have to eat small pieces as they are quite rich but you can go back for more and you will.

Made these because my, 30-yr-old son, was coming over the next day. These are so awesome, I froze what I didn't eat...what he doesn't know, won't hurt him. lol

I wanted to try something new in baking up a treat over the weekend.  Let me tell you, I am SO glad I tried these - they did NOT disappoint!!! No joke, I'd say they are the most delicious cookie-bar type dessert I've ever had!!!  I did have to cook them a little longer than the instructions (I think about five more minutes), and then they came out at the perfect gooey-ness, at least for my taste - retains form but moist and chewy.  I DID make a couple "tweaks" to the recipe (I can't help myself, I like experimenting with what I cook) - I used all dark brown sugar (instead of half brown and half white), used a mix of 8 oz. of pecan bits and 8 oz. of pecan halves, and added milk chocolate chips (about a half bag or so).  I will make these again and again!!!

I thought it tasted wonderful.  I see that others felt the center didn't cook so I'm not alone.  Perhaps this isn't supposed to be cake like but more pudding like???  
Anyway, I left it in for 10 more minutes on the lower rack. Then left it in the oven for another 5 after I turned the oven off.    
I'll make it again as I thought it was delicious.

I took the advice of some other reviews, and baked in a 9 X 13" pan, for about 50 minutes. They were chewy inside and a little bit crunchy outside.  Loved them. Great flavor. Will definitely make again!

I have a recipe very similar to this one but this one is a lot easier to put together.  I noticed a lot of changes in the reviews so I'll add my two cents.  I followed one review that only used brown sugar (I cut down the amount) and I baked them at 300 degrees for 1 hour in a 9x9 pan and found that they were too dry.  The flavor was good, tho.  I made them again and mostly followed the recipe but I did cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup white and about 1/2 cup brown but loosely packed.  I also added 1 tsp. of orange extract (because I was out of orange zest which I usually keep in my freezer) and 1 cup of white chocolate chips.  I baked them in a 9x9 pan for 45 min at 300 degrees and they were perfect.  However, I still found them to be too sweet for my taste so next time I will cut the sugar back even farther.  Very hard to just eat one but I try hard not to!  They freeze great.

I have made this twice, they are amazing!!! So gooey and delicious! Everyone loves them! 
The only change I made was to cook it about 10 minutes longer. Probably would have been better to drop down the temp a bit and cook it longer since the edges got a bit overdone when just increasing the time.

These bars are so delicious and easy - I made them with my 2 1/2 year old daughter and now she wants to make them everyday!!  Now every time I am invited for a meal I am asked to bring them along for dessert!

The taste is very much like pecan pie, and this was a BIG hit in my house. So easy, too, with no dry ingredients to sift together.

This recipe really does taste like a pecan pie. It is a very simple one-bowl recipe, and I love it.

I love these bars.  I made the "mistake" of completely melting the butter the first time I made them and they were really different each time.  They were more like a caramelized bar when I melted the butter and a cookie bar when i softened it.  It doesn't tell you how many pecans to use so I guessed about three quarters of a cup to one cup per 8 servings recipe.  That was a good guess.  Thank you, Franci...
