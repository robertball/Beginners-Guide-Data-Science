Nice take on an omelet and great technique for cooking! Since my husband is a huge fan of bacon I just had to give this a try and I'm glad I did.  This was very filling - perfect for a weekend breakfast for two!  I omitted the American cheese and just stuck with the sharp cheddar.  The addition of the red pepper flakes gave it a nice kick.  This was delicious served with whole grain toast and fresh fruit!

Wonderful technique. Yielded a nice puffy omelet like one gets in a restaurant. Using what I had on hand, I substituted Parmesan and Sharp Cheddar, sauteed frozen pre-chopped onion and bell pepper blend, real bacon bits and pimiento for more color. I'll use this recipe again soon.

Thank you for sharing this super easy technique!  I have never had luck with making omelets, but when I saw that other readers were having luck with this method, I decided to give it a try  I followed the directions exactly, and added bell pepper and banana peppers with my onion.  Thanks again!

Delicious and easy! The first time I ever made a beautiful omelet without it falling apart!!! I spayed my pan, cover and steamed it, put my bacon on it(I always microwave it on paper towels, removes so much of the grease) and simply used salsa then cheddar a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes, melted the cheese with the lid on flipped it over. Just sooo good and easy, breakfast was done in like 5 min!

I used my own ingredients, but used this recipe for the technique - very good technique.  I have been unsuccessful with omelettes in the past, but this one turned out perfect.  I did not see any steam venting, so I just added the ingredients when the egg looked cooked through and started to 'bubble'.  Produced a nice golden brown omelette.

This was great. I used onion powder and sprinkled chives over the top since i don't care for regular onion. I was skeptical of the cooking method, but it worked great and was easier too. Thanks for the great recipe!

Seriously! Before tonight, I had NEVER made an omelet in my life.  This recipe was well-written.  The instructions were easy to follow, and so many reviews insisted that it involved the use of a wonderful technique.  So, I tried it...  Even the FIRST omelet came out great.  Every omelet afterward was a success.  I am very happy with this recipe, and highly recommend it for novices and the omelet-challenged.  As far as the flavor goes, I only used ham, cheese, salt, and pepper; but, I wouldn't hesitate to use this technique with other ingredients.

This was very good.  I found that mine got stuck to the pan though.  Also, steam at no time came out of my frying pan.  I have made this twice spraying my pan with non-stick cooking spray.  I think next time I will use olive oil.

I don't care for american cheese, so I omitted it. To bring down the cholesterol and fat, I only used two of the yolks. To make this a more filling breakfast for me, I served it with a side of sauteed red peppers. Very filling and also low in carbs.

Very good technique for cooking the omelet.  I only had green onions - I chopped up 3.  Because they are so tender anyway, I just put them on top of the eggs to cook together.  An omelet is not an omelet w/o butter, so I used that instead of the spray.  Didn't have chedder so I used parmesan.  I just now realized I left out the salt.  Turns out it didn't need it.  Excellent.

Liked it a lot. I think I had too much butter for the onion that made it a little greasier than I would have liked. But that was my fault. The rest came out great and I was surprised I could do it the way it was written. Will definitely have it again and again.

I have tried seversal times to make an omelet, and they always end up as scrambled eggs, because it does not come out as planned.  but this time I read the instructions and it sounded easy so decided to give it a try.
As soon as the steam started, I removed the lid and was really surprised at what I saw, it looked like a fluffy souffle. I put on the cheese, bacon, and onions. swirled the skillet around, and slid the omelet out onto a plate. folded it over, let it sit a few seconds, and Voila!  ate the best omelet ever.
this is one recipe that I will be using over and over again. thank you.

Very simple method. Works very well but it takes a little more time. I'm not sure if it taste as good this way but it definitely is easy. I can see myself using this method many times in the future.

This was the first time I made an omelet and this technique was so easy!  I didn't have any onion so I omitted that step.  I didn't use American cheese, I used a mix of monterey  jack and cheddar.  Thought the 1/8 teaspoon of salt was unnecessary 'cause bacon is salty enough.

this was a very simple recipe to follow, i never can make omelettes. when i do they end up to be scrambled eggs. i got a flip grill pan for christmas and came arose this. Wow, i love the fluffiness.. I normally add milk not water ..  boy it made a difference.. I did add hollinase sauce on the top to give it a little bit flavor .. not sure if it was my new grill pan techniques are the water adding but either way it turned out to be a great recipe. this is now my go to from now on thank you so much for sharing..

I was more interested in the cooking technique, which was great. The first near-perfect omelette I've ever made. I left out the cheese and bacon and added cubed chicken breast. It was delicious!

Well sadly this method did not work for me, I may have done it wrong but my omelet stuck a little bit. Nothing major but this method took a long time and still didn't turn out perfect so I think I will stick to the quicker way. BUT this recipe was awesome, with a few tweaks. I used nitrate-free bacon, cut out the processed cheese and added tomato and spinach. Also mine really didn't need any salt. This was a good combination of ingredients. I would recommend, but only if you're hungry! This thing is huge!

I rreally like this recipe very much.  First time ever I've gotten an omlett out in one piece.  I would add more cheese next time.  I didn't have jumbo eggs so I used 4 large instead of 3 jumbo and it worked just fine. Thank you!!!
Just wondered though if anyone has tried putting the Bacon, cheese and onion on top of the defy at the beginning of the egg cooking?

No steam arose from pot so egg got a little overcooked.  Cheese and bacon was a little overbearing.

I've always been "omelet" challenged...never comes out right.  This recipe has turned me into an omelet novice!  Followed the recipe to a tee, except I used a slice of Jarlsberg cheese instead of the American cheese.  It came out almost perfect...did have a little trouble sliding it out of the pan, think I let it cook a little too long.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  I will definitely be making it again...next time I'll have to remember to salt & add crushed red pepper flakes.  Was very good!!  Thanks again!

I had never cooked an omelet using this method before and am really glad I tried this. It was cooked perfectly.  Nice and fluffy.  Hubby said it was better than ihop. :)  It takes a little longer to cook it this way but well worth it.
