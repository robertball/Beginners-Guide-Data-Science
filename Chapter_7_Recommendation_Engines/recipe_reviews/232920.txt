This was a nice simple sauce that we are quite likely to make again. I doubled the oregano because it didn't seem like enough after tasting, perhaps mine is aged and losing flavor. I might try fresh next time. I also eliminated the oil (personal preference). I had an open can of fire roasted tomatoes in puree that was a similar consistency to sauce so that is what I used instead. I ended up with two nice thick cups of sauce (one cup covered a large pizza quite nicely). I cut down on the salt due to the salt in the tomatoes but I will use the full amount with my unsalted tomato sauce.

This is very similar to my own recipe and a great classic. No need to ever purchase store bought sauce and easy enough to keep the basics on hand anytime you should need to make a pizza sauce. Excellent flavor!

This was ok.  It was more like spaghetti sauce than pizza sauce.  My kids liked it though.  Very easy and quick to prepare.

This was a great sauce. In fact, I made it three weekends in a row, paired with a pizza dough recipe from this site. Sure, there are fancier recipes, but this turned out very nicely for such a simple-to-prepare recipe with so few ingredients. I made it exactly as written. (I'm not sure why the "chill in refrigerator" step is needed, but I always refrigerated it for at least an hour.) One of my big concerns was the texture/spreadability of the sauce, and it totally met my expectations. The first time, using a 14-inch pizza pan, the sauce was a bit too thick. After that, the whole batch sufficed nicely for a 16-inch pizza. I may go on to try fancier pizza sauce recipes, but this one is highly recommended.

Also similar to mine, lol, the only difference is I omit the salt, and use salt free diced tomatoes as I am on a salt free diet, but once you add the spices it's fantastic and you'll never know the salt is missing, thanks for this basic wonderful recipe.

Made exactly as written (believe unfair to rate after tweaking) and found it to be a solid basic sauce recipe using ingredients most have on hand.

I made  no changes to this recipe what so ever and it was delish.  I will definitely keep this on hand for making my pizzas.  My husband said that this was the best pizza he has ever tasted.  This one is a keeper.

Terrific pizza sauce. I cut the salt in half. This one is getting laminated!

Very good, simple sauce that let's the flavor of the toppings come through.
