If I were to try this again I would probably sautee the eggplant. Mine didnt come out very good at all. I think I will try it again but without the eggplant and with large portabellos sauteed. Otherwise this recipe isnt so bad. Just needs some tweeking.

This was really good! I grilled the veggies instead of broiling and used olive tapenade instead of tomato paste because it's what I had. Added garlic sliced portobello mushrooms and feta cheese. YUM.

Delicious! I would suggest adding some roasted pine nuts. This makes a great sandwich. Thank you for the recipe.
