This recipe was good, but I made a lot of alterations.  I used all the fresh veggies I had on hand (celery, carrots, potatoes, etc.  I also spiced it up quite a bit with an array or spices out of my cabinet along with some tabasco sauce.  Otherwise, it would have been too bland.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make it all year long and have changed it a bit to my liking.  In addition to the veggies already in the recipe, I add broccoli, spinach, extra peppercorns, an additional bay leaf, and a little tabasco.  Occasionally I'll add cauliflower or any other veggies in season, but definitely the staples above. In order to get it all to fit, I use 1/2 a bunch of celery and 1/2 head of cabbage.  I also use large cans of diced tomatoes (2 usually) and leave the juice in the soup.  I've never had a problem with bland soup this way.    When I serve it, I also add a dash of lime juice.  It really enhances the flavors.  This soup also freezes well.  I'll spend an entire day making several stock pots full at the end of autumn, and then I'm all ready to be snowed in during the winter!  During the winter I'll also serve it with a slice of beer bread.  In the summer I add an extra squeeze of lime juice and let it cool a little longer.

I enjoyed this recipe, and so did my coworkers. I variate it at times by adding either corned beef or meatballs and a can of drained whole kernel corn.

Needed a lot more salt.  Kind of bland.  May be much better with chicken or beef broth.

Delicious recipe - I added some fresh cilantro and a diced bell pepper. For health - no onion soup mix, I used fresh onions very finely diced and sea salt.

Very good, although I did make it my own. First I halved the recipe, then I left out the fresh tomatoes and zucchini and added 1 cn diced tomatoes and 1 cn zucchini in tomato sauce, and 1 small cn of mushrooms.  I didn't use the peppercorns, but added 2 beef bullion cubes, worchestershire sauce, a little hot sauce, and some italian seasoning. Very flavorful and still low in calories!

I was creative with this recipe.  I used 1/2 head chopped cabbage, approximately 2 stalks of celery, a pkg. of Picsweet
Pepper Summer Vegetables,
1 can of Italian Stewed Tomatoes, 1 small can tomato
sauce, approximately 1 oz.
hot picante sauce, basil and
a generous amount of
italian seasoning.  Then I
raided the freezer because I
thought it needed more color
and added the rest of the frozen corn and green beans.
Very tasty.  Might add some
cayenne pepper after it simmers for the full 90 minutes.

Ok, so this is bland like everyone has said!  I even added some boullion & carrots to help a little with the flavor, but still nothing.   I don't generally use a lot of meat, but this would taste delicious with some beef stew meat!

Although this is a nice, straight-forward, easy to make recipe, it really needs a boost. I noticed that most people who gave this recipe a high rating also modified it and added seasoning. In mine, I added Worcestershire sauce, a pinch of red pepper flakes, tomato paste, herbamare, and extra garlic at the end. I also used only 1/2 head of cabbage because it wouldn't fit in the pot I was using and added canned corn, which added some sweetness. With these modifications included, I'd probably rate in 3 1/2 - 4 stars.

I did not use green pepper or the onions. Added mushrooms, eliminated the bay leaf (didnt need it).  Added frozen broccoli.  Let it simmer for about 1 1-2 hrs then pureed it, adding more liquid so it wouldn't be too thick.  Some tabasco sauce and LIME juice.  Excellent.  Be sure to add lime juice, it really makes the difference.

We really enjoyed this and did not find it bland at all.  Now hubs added a minced jalapeno, and I added lots more seasoning: Cajun spice blend, Italian herbs, garlic powder, onion powder and about 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice.  I also used canned stewed tomatoes with the juice, and a couple of cups homemade turkey stock as my husband loves very brothy soups.  We also added carrot.  This made a huge batch which is okay so we can have a nice soup for lunches.

A good fall soup. I was concerned about the sodium content, because I did use two large cans of diced tomatoes, as suggested by another reviewer, as well as  the two onion soup packages. I added no additional salt, and it was not too salty. I also only used two onions chopped and 3/4 of a medium cabbage. It was very tasty and not overpowering. Iâ€™ll make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Do this recipe as is, but throw in 1lb of peeled shrimp and a tablespoon of cajun seasoning (and a diced serrano pepper if you like it hot).  Fantastic.
