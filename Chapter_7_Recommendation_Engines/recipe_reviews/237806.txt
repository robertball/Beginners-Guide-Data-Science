Tasty. I made half of the recipe but kept the same amount of red onion and I used one half of an english cucumber.  While it is tasty I think that it would benefit from some fresh parsley.

Good!  I added zucchini and yellow summer squash with the peppers and chicken that was slow cooked in Italian seasoning. and then shredded.   It was a big hit.
