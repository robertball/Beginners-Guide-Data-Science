A friend from Nigeria made it for us. What a delightful meal! I though it was the most flavorful rice I ever eaten. Also, I tried to make fried plantians before and did not like it. Watching my friend make it "the right way" made all the difference. Note to yourself: buy very ripe plantains! We grilled the chicken, it was wonderful too, very tender.
