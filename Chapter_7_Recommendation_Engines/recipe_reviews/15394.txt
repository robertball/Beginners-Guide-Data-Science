This recipe was wonderful! A definite winner! I did make changes to it though. I soaked the sun dried tomatoes in the olive oil along with 2 cloves of minced garlic and two pinches of rosemary. I chunked the chicken before cooking and added extra olive oil to saute it. After sauteing the chicken I added the tomatoes with oil garlic and rosemary the zucchini and yellow squash and a chunked red pepper. When I added the pasta to the pan I also added enough chicken consomme to coat the entire dish heated it through and then added grated Locatelli cheese to the top.

This was delicious! The only issue was the recipe didn't specify the cheese! I used 1/4 cup grated parmesean and about 1 cup of mozzarella. I also used wagon wheel pasta (I didn't have any bow-tie) and the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes vs. olive oil). I added about 1/4 cup more sun-dried tomatoes since we love them. It was a wonderful light tasting recipe. My husband loved it leftovers were just as good as the first day and we I will make again and again!

This is the start of a great recipe.  I would have given it a five, but I made a lot of changes.  I microwaved zucchini slices, carrot slices and some fresh brocoli  florets until crisp tender.  I then sauted them in EVOO with 1/2 of a sweet onion  cut in 2 inch slices, a red pepper in 2 inch pieces, and a few baby bella mushrooms, sliced.  I added 2 minced cloves of garlic, chicken chunks that I had left over from a rotissarie chicken.  I added sliced sun-dried tomatoes with a little bit of the oil they were packed in.  Finally I added a couple of tablespoons of evoo to the pasta, mixed it all together and added some grated parmesan and sprinkled a small handfull of shredded mozerella.  It was fabulous, restaurant quality.  My family loved it.  We will definitely have this again.

Great! Because I was concerned about the flavor issue I fried a little turkey bacon in olive oil before I cooked the chicken (which I had already cut into pieces). I added some garlic and allowed to cook. Then I added some halved cherry tomatoes a chopped summer squash sliced mushrooms and chopped spinach. Allowed to cook added some salt pepper and oregano. Then combined it (including the juices) with some penne pasta (all that we had) and mixed it all together with a little crumbled feta cheese. It was great! The turkey bacon really added to it. You could also use proscuitto or pancetta which I think would be even more delicious if less good for you.

The recipe was pretty good and easy to make. I add dried raisins and cranberries for a bit of sweetness. It also brought out the taste of the tomatoes and the squash. My 11month old loved it (before the oil) and my neighbour's 5 year old didn't like it at all.

I used the olive oil from the tomatoes to cook the chicken - definitely gave it a nice flavor! I also used 3 cloves of crushed garlic and 2 pinches of dried rosemary when I sauteed the squash and zucchini (instead of steaming it).

I just made this for dinner. It was good - with a couple of alterations to give it more flavor:) I sauteed the chicken in olive oil from the tomatoes with garlic & basil and a little salt. I used all squash since I didn't have a zucchini and tossed in a tomato heated in the pan after the chicken was done. I also used the oil from the tomatoes as another user recommended & added salt & pepper when I tossed it all together. After all that it made a yummy dinner & I can't wait to have it cold for lunch tomorrow!

Relatively easy to make. I used 3/4 cup Smart Balance 1/4 cup butter instead of all butter and egg noodles instead of bow tie pasta. My family loved it! They thought it was as good as a restaurant recipe. I will add artichoke hearts and possibly olives next time at least for the adults:). We will use it again soon since it was such a hit!

This recipe had very little flavor. I cooked the chicken in garlic and it was still boring. Good starter recipe... just add more flavorful ingredients.

Bland as-is but add a lot of pesto and maybe some artichokes and it's great! Grow your own basil and make home-made pesto.

Excellent. We added marinated artichokes but either way would have been equally tasty.

Really good healthy and easy to make. I too thought it was a little bland so I added some Kraft Zesty Italian vinaigrette to mine after cooking and tossing; but my husband and daughter preferred theirs as is. Nice summer recipe when you have the fresh zucchini and squash!

This was just okay as written but with the help of the reviews I would give it 5 stars. I sauteed the chicken with smashed garlic cloves and then sauteed the zucchini in a separate pan with olive oil; after it was soft I added the sun dried tomatoes 1/2 sprig of rosemary finely chopped 1 minced garlic clove salt to taste (needs a lot) and a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes and black pepper. Once the pasta was finished I saved about 1/3 Cup of the pasta water and mixed the pasta the vegetables and the water together and simmered on low. I added more garlic salt about 1/4 Cup half and half and about 1/8 cup chicken stock. I continued to simmer adding more garlic salt and pepper to taste. At the end I added another garlic clove (we love garlic!) to give extra zip and then grated parmesan over the top. It was delicious and we will definitely make again!

I made this with the same ingredients as directed just altered the preparation method a bit. After steaming the zucchini and squash I sauteed them in the pan with the sun dried tomatoes I had cooked the chicken in. I also put the the cut up cooked chicken back in the pan at the same time to flavor it more and keep it warm. I used sun dried tomatoes in oil because I prefer them over the standard ones. Instead of tossing everything together at the end I just plated the pasta and then poured some of the chicken/veggie mixture on each - it saved me from getting another dish dirty!

The artichoke addition in several reviews make this dish very good. True that it would be bland otherwise but this change and a bit of garlic makes it work. Also a lower pasta ratio was a good thing - the other ingredients had more flavor. Pretty tasty.

I thought this was a good meal although I used a pesto sauce instead of olive oil to add extra flavoring. I still think it lacked in flavor.. any suggestions to spice it up a bit??

The meal was pretty good although the sun dried tomatoes were not quite my cup of tea. I think next time I will try and use a little bit of fresh tomatoes instead. Overall it was pretty good.

Unfortunately the recipe as is did not turn out well. As other suggested I soaked the garlic sun-dried tomatoes in oil and used the oil to cook the pre-cut chicken pieces (however added extra olive oil and two garlic cloves while cooking). I added an extra 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes three garlic cloves 1/8 cup basil and 1/8 cup grape seed oil to the final mix because it had little taste. I doubt I will use this recipe again. Only one out of four family members enjoyed it.
