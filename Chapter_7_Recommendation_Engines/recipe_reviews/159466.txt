Very moist, not what I expected from a bran muffin.  It had a light fruity taste and just the right amount of raisins.  I didn't bother microwaving the raisins to make them soft, I just let them soak in the milk/egg/cereal mixture for five minutes.  I used all-purpose flour as opposed to wheat and 2 Tbsp. of veg. oil instead of melted butter.  I also added 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar.  These made exactly 12 muffins that rose up nicely and they were done in 20 minutes - perfect!

This is a really good bran muffin recipe and very easy although I did make some changes.  I didn't have bananas so I subbed in 1/3 cup of vanilla yogourt and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking powder.  I also used white flour and subbed blueberries instead of raisins.  They were very moist and tasty.  I did bake them at 400 but they were ready in 15 minutes.  I'll keep this in my files and definately make again.

I thought that this is a realy great recipe! The only thing I did for a change is that I added a little vanilla and baking powder. the baking powder makes them puff up a bit more.

SCORE! I have tried several bran muffin recipes and these are THE BEST. My 9 year old wanted to sign up on here to tell you all that even though she really, really doesn't like raisins you don't even know they are in here. I have made several batches during the last week and they are wonderful every time, friends raved as well.  I use the following substitutions: SOY MILK instead of dairy, 1 Tbs OIL & 1 Tbs APPLESAUCE instead of butter.  I like to add 3/4 tsp BAKING POWDER for just a little fluff and I prefer Granny Smith apples not only for the tartness but also for the pretty flecks of green from the peel. I have even substituted 1/3 ground oat and flax for 1/3 of the flour (that I ground myself when I was short on WW flour) and they still turned out light & moist. This will replace my refrigerator muffin mix as they are well worth the bit of time. Thank you for sharing Roxie's recipe :)

These turned out wonderfully. Had my three year old daughter help me make them. Made a few changes. I used Raisin Bran Cereal instead of using raisins and plain bran cereal. I soaked the cereal in the milk and egg for almost 10 minutes-just while i was getting the other ingredients together. Also used 2 Tbsp of applesauce instead of butter and 1/3 cup honey as others had suggested. I also used all organic ingredients which i think makes it taste better. I will surely be making these again and again. Might try making them different ways. A handful of walnuts would sure top them off! OH and my daughter LOVED them. She kept asking for more. Eventually had to cut her off, lol.

Yum yum yum!!  These are so good!   I followed the recipe exactly like it was..well, with the exception i put my apple in the food processer and made it in very small chunks  instead of shredding the apple.   I read some reviews that said these don't rise much so they added baking powder.   i would NOT do that personally. It was perfect like it was, just be sure to fill your muffin cups full b/c they do not rise much.   My huband said these were the moistest muffins he's ever had.  My kids couldn't get enough of them.  I will make these often!!

Excellent use of leftover/stale Bran cereal! I did not have any bananas so used 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce (and foregoed the apple as well), I also subbed Splenda - 2 tbsp. for the honey as I had no honey! :) They just came out of the oven and they are nice, light and fluffy! (Oh yeah, they do need baking powder - I used 1/2 tsp for the batch).  Thanks for the recipe! I needed one in a flash and this one was Exchange recommended!

Perfect, healthy bran recipe. I used oil instead of melted butter and dried blueberries instead of raisins. I don't think all the steps in the directions are necessary: simply mix the wet ingredients (plus raisins) and dry ingredients separately and then mix them together.

These are so good. Not your typical Bran muffin. I used plain flour because that is what I had on hand. I used a granny smith apple and chopped it instead of shreading it. I like the chunks. I also added some chopped pecans. I added extra bananas because my bananas were very small. This is a great tasting, moist recipe. One other thing, fill the muffin cups FULL. This recipe doesn't rise very much.

Awesome!!!  I subbed safflower oil for the butter, added a generous squeeze of lemon juice over the banana and grated apple before mixing them in, chopped the raisins (without plumping them), and added broken walnuts for some crunch.  I also reduced the honey to 1/3 cup, and they were still plenty sweet for my taste!

I usually hate it when people rate a modified recipe, but this was so darned good, I'm breaking my own rule. I substituted white flour instead of whole wheat, used 2 tbls of oil instead of melted butter, added 1/2 tsp baking powder and used 2 bananas instead of the banana and apple. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Very good bran recipe.  Followed advice of others - applesauce instead of butter and used 2 mashed bananas (no apples).  Quick and easy to make!

These were quite good! I used soured milk (1 tablespoon white vinegar plus milk to make 3/4 cup total) instead of regular milk since the recipe had baking soda in it. If you want to use regular milk then change to baking powder to keep the correct chemistry. I reduced cinnamon to a pinch and reduced honey to 1/3 cup. Added 1/4 teaspoon salt. My family doesn't eat raisins so I used chocolate chips. Will make again.

I tried it once, the trial was very successful, and now I make a batch every week. But as a former chemistry major, I can't let a recipe alone.

I increased the raisins, added 2 tsp of dried ginger, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1/2 c. of chopped pecans. 

Extraordinary, if I do say so myself! The best part is that I get to eat my experiments.

Awesome!  I forgot to add the butter and they were still perfectly moist!, so I imagine you could easily sub applesauce for the butter.   Just a perfect combo of fruit and health.  I liked how easy these were to prepare too.

just Absolutely amazing!!! even better than my regular and amazing "Apple and Banana Cupcakes" recipe from this site. i used raisin bran ceral in place of the raisins and bran, 2/4 cup water in place of milk, 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup oatmeal, and 1/2 cup packed brown sugar in place of honey. I have to say, this recipe is AMAZING and after eating one right out of the oven, i immediatly ate THREE MORE. i couldnt help it! leaves a delcious sweet taste in your mouth without being overly sweet like candy. i think its the raisin bran that gives it the special taste. so much healthier than the normal recipes i make, AND SO MUCH MORE DELCIOUS! these are irrisistable. the key is to mix as little as possible after adding the bran to keep the muffins moist and soft, and fill the cups to the top with batter! try this recipe!

These were great!  I did a double batch as I wanted to do 12 with chocolate chips for my boys.  I did use only 1/3 cup honey for each batch and 2 tbsps of canola instead of the butter.  I realized I had only natural wheat bran and not actual bran cereal, but it seemed to work well.  I thought these were nice and hearty and had great flavour, kids loved the chocolate chip version of course!  My only complaint was that my liners stuck to my muffins, so next time I will spray my pan and do without using liners.  It's happened to me before a couple of times and the only thing I can think is that it seems more common in recipes with not a ton of butter/oil (ie: fat).  Regardless, yummy muffins, thank you!

These are delicious! I used oat bran instead of bran cereal because that's all I had. The batter was very very thick but baked up to be dense and moist muffins.

This is my go to recipe for my kiddo's quick breakfast. I double the batch, freeze them for 15 minutes on a cookie sheet and then put them in a ziploc bag in the freezer. I microwave them for 20seconds in the morning, and voila! Breakfast is served! Great when you are running out the  door! I also add a handful of chocolate chips- just a bit of incentive that they will be eaten:) delicious and hearty!

This recipe was the first time I ever made bran muffins, and they were a hit! They are so easy to make, and the taste is delicious! The only thing I did differently was I used wheat bran (Bob's Red Mills) instead of cereal because I don't eat that cereal. I used the same amount that the recipe called for in cereal and they came out moist and perfect. Some reviews said these don't rise too much, but unless you're expecting a muffin top as big as the heel, they rise just fine.

Great recipe, I subbed 3/4 cup applesauce for the apple and blueberries for the raisins. I added a teaspoon each of nutmeg, powdered ginger, ground clove, and powdered green cardamon and 2 tablespoons vanilla extract. I also added one grated carrot and 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I used all organic and non GMO ingredients since GMOs and pesticides are known to cause cancer. I will be making these again.

I used fiber one cereal, substituted canola oil for the butter and added a 1/2 t baking powder and 1 t vanilla as mentioned in other reviews.  Next time I plan on using brown sugar and a little extra liquid in place of the honey.  These will go on my regular breakfast rotation.  They were very good!

This is my new go to bran muffin recipe! I love that it is sweetened by honey and fruit only - no sugar! I made 3 changes to this recipe that made a big difference: I added 1/2 tsp. baking powder, which made the muffins a little fluffier, cut the apple into small chunks instead of shredding it, and used 2 tbsp. oil instead of butter. Delicious!

I love all the fruit in these muffins! The only changes I made were to add ground flax seed and wheat germ for a nutritional bonus.

Amazing.  I substituted apple sauce for the apple.  I also used a food processor to puree the banana and cranberries.  The best bran muffins I've encountered.

These were excellent and will definitely be my go-to recipe.  I read the other reviews and incorporated some of those suggestions.  I used 1/3 cup fat-free vanilla yogurt for the banana because mine weren't ripe enough.  I added 1t. vanilla extract, also.  I also added 1/4t. salt and 1/2 t. baking powder and my muffins puffed up nicely.  They were a little too sweet so next time I think I'll use 1/4 C. honey and maybe a T. spoon or 2 of brown sugar. I combined all the wet ingrediants with the bran and raisins and seperately mixed the dry before mixing the dry into the wet.  Pretty simple recipe but delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were pretty good. I opted for dried blueberries instead of raisins, and used a bran flake cereal with strawberries in it, for more of a berry medley muffin, which worked out well. The banana added a subtle layer of flavor. I was worried that the banana plus shredded apple would provide too much moisture, however they weren't over moist. There is just enough though, to ensure that these won't keep for long.

I didn't add that much honey but I did add brown sugar and some greek yogurt to keep the moisture in there. I also subbed out raisins for blueberries and cranberries.

Very tastey, even my 2 and 3 year old love to eat them. I did sub applesauce for the butter like others recommended and they turned out great.

really good bran muffin recipe.  I chopped the apples instead of shredding ... the apple chunks where really yummy.  Also, used brown sugar instead of honey since I didn't have any. My 5-year-old says they are "awesome"!  Will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

excellent bran muffins, I recently made these and when I opened the fridge to get an apple.....No apple!
So I substituted two medium carrots (grated). Came out perfect.

Delish and healthy too!  THe only changes I made was no banana (since i make banana bread a lot) and applesauce instead of butter.  I also added a little cloves and nutmeg and wheat germ.  Really great and my kids loved them too!!!

Great muffin! I was so glad to find exactly what I was looking for, using the 'ingredient' search for: bran, apples, and honey. This came up, and I followed the recipe with only two exceptions: dried raspberries instead of raisins, and olive oil instead of melted butter. I doubled the recipe for 24 wonderful-tasting muffins, which is a feat since I live in Europe, where the ingredients are slightly varied, and my oven isn't insulated. Recipes from the U.S. don't always work out well here! But this one is a winner. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!! God bless!

Love these! Found they needed 25 minutes baking in stoneware but other than that recipe was perfect as is. Super moist and filling enough to start the day with.   Even my husband who at first asked me if there was chocolate in them couldn't get enough!

My family really enjoyed these muffins and they are a great way to use up fruit that isn't really fresh anymore. 
My box of original All Bran was 6 cups of cereal so I changed the servings to 48. 
The measurements I used were as follows: 2 cups raisins, 4 eggs, 3 cups of milk which I warmed in the microwave, 1 box of All Bran cereal, 4 cups ww flour, I used Robin Hood Omega 3 plus flax flour, 4 tsps baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 4 tsps cinnamon, 4 tsps vanilla, 1/2 cup melted butter, 5 bananas, 3 apples, 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. 
I had to add more milk, probably around 1/2 cup. I baked at 350 for 25 minutes, the recipe yielded 44 muffins using my #50 scoop.

I followed this recipe to a T. Yummy and healthy recipe that I can feel good about eating and serving my children! They aren't as yummy as some of the oil and sugar laden muffin recipes that I love so much - but they are certainly better than some of the "healthier" muffins I have made - and better for me for sure! I will make these again!

I combine this recipe into 6 large muffins, which never bake correctly.  Even burnt on the outside, they're delicious though.  I tend to put in more than the recommended amount of raisins and cinnamon though

Omitted butter and substituted all purpose flour, 4 oz. applesauce and 2T brown sugar. Muffins were moist and flavorful. Will definitely make these again soon and maybe add chopped dates!

Moist and delicious.  Used All-Bran Bran Buds; blueberries instead of raisins (personal preference) and regular flour.  This recipe will make you enjoy eating bran!

Loved this recipe! They were really moist but not too sweet. I omitted the honey and apple and just added a couple tbsp of brown sugar, an extra banana and a little more milk. Baked for 18 min at 400.

We've made these over a dozen times. It has become a true staple in our home. I love the flavor the honey gives these perfect muffins. We use more raisins - love those plump little guys, but the recipe needs no more tinkering. Perfect!

somehow I ended up with 3 boxes of raisin bran cereal so I used that without adding extra raisins. I did add orange rind & the juice of 1 orange, just because my fruit was drying out. and was concerned about the muffins not rising, so I added 1/4 cup of self rising....just a few additions, and this was the best!!!! I was planning on buttering one up, but when I tasted it, did not need the extra butter, was delicious on its own.....yes, I will make these again, since I have so much cereal to use up...

These muffins are excellent. I have made them five times in the last three weeks. I made them four times with brown sugar and once with honey. Both ways were delicious. I used a flake type cereal each time (e.g., Raisin Bran, Total). I never shredded the apples but rather cut them in small pieces. Great muffins.

I have only had bran muffins once in my life, and I was rather young when I had it...I hated them. A lot. Recently though, I've been wanting to eat a bit healthier so I thought I would give them another try. I omitted the raisins (I'm not fond of raisins in my baking) but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The recipe was easy to follow, easy to make, and I was very surprised by how much I love these! To me they were definitely a banana muffin, which for me is great since I love banana muffins. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow-took some feedback and used 2 bananas and left out the apple. Tested a few w/ mini chocolate chips (and dried cherries and pecans-waiting to eat those.) Definitely better w/ the chocolate chips. Did add 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. baking powder. Outstanding!

Wanted to try using bran cereal in my baking (fibre is good for you, right?) and this is what I decided to go with. I liked the ingredient list, especially the fact that it doesn't call for a cup of vegetable oil.  
I'm not too fond of raisins in my bakeware (read: it makes me gag), but one review claimed you can't tell. Well, you can, but it's not so bad.  I would chop-chop the raisins next time, though.  And I did add 3/4 tsp of baking powder.  I don't know if that changed anything.  
Oh: I didn't actually have all that much honey on hand.  So ended up using 1/8 cup of honey and 1/8 cup of maple syrup and then gave up. Muffins were sweet enough nonetheless.

We really liked these, but I think I'll leave the raisins out next time (just a personal preference).  They weren't dry at all, and my daughters loved them--I loved that they're all-natural and full of wholesome ingredients!  I'll definitely make these again!

Great muffins! I doubled the amount of baking soda to make them rise more, and they turned out beautifully! Very moist, and they were deliciously sweet even without sugar!

These are great!  Only made a couple modifications, used applesauce instead of butter and reduced the honey to 1/3 cup to make them even healthier.  Still sweet and really enjoyed them!  I used Special K high protein bran cereal so they have a little protein in them as well.  Will be making these often!

We substituted blueberries for the raisins the first time we tried this recipe.  Since then we've made it frequently and always varied the fruit ingredients.  I love that I can give them to my kids and feel confident in the ingredients.  Perfect for breakfast on the run.

These are really tasty, moist, and healthy!  I also did not microwave the raisins (just let them soak with the cereal) and I diced the apples instead of shredding.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used wheat bran instead of cereal, 2tbsp veg oil instead of butter and chopped up a frozen banana.  I didn't bother plumping the raisins -  I just mixed them in with the dry ingredients and added to all the wet ingredients, barely stirred the two together and baked.  After exactly 20 minutes I had 12 warm, tasty, beautifully domed muffins.  I'll be using this recipe often.

This is an excellent recipe!  Not at all a "greasy" muffin.  I probably make this a couple times a month.  (We love muffins for breakfast here!)  The only change I usually make is oil in place of the butter and I use 2 bananas instead of a banana and an apple.  (Shredding apples is a lot of work in the morning!)  Thank you!

These muffins are perfect!  My family loved them.  My parents stopped by and they each had one and loved them too.  I have been asked for the recipe!  I followed the recipe almost all the way.  I changed two things, the first was that I just omitted the raisins completely and the second thing was that I didn't have banana's so I substituted 1/2 c. yogurt instead.  They came out wonderfully!  Very moist and great tasting.  Thanks for this recipe.  It doesn't need any changes really!

They were good, but not as moist as I expected. I used All-Bran flakes with strawberries, all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat, margarine instead of butter, a Granny Smith apple and only 1/3 cup of honey as many other reviewers recommended. The level of sweetness was perfect. I allowed my raisins to plump in the egg/milk/cereal mixture instead of microwaving with water; worked just fine. Will try using a riper banana as the one I used wasn't very ripe. Will also consider other dried fruits and maybe adding nuts for some crunch. EDIT (14/o6/2010): These are also great with dried cranberries. Add an extra banana and bake until done (about 15 minutes longer).

I just made these today and they are absolutely fabulous!!  I added everything ~ raisins, cranberries, walnuts, apples, bananas.  They were very moist and tender.  I also added a tsp. of baking powder to make them rise, since other people were suggesting that.  These came out wonderful and I will definately make them again.

Amazing!  I have made this at least ten times already.  The best is when I use All-Bran w/strawberries and add walnuts & pecans.  I have also made w/craisins & raisins.  All variations wonderful.  Thank you Lisa for this incredible recipe.

I decided to try this out for health reasons.  My boyfriend's dad has heart disease.  I followed all instructions, but added margarine instead of butter and used egg whites instead of whole yolks.  Very yummy and delicious, especially when it's fresh out of the oven!

these are very good!  i didn't add in the raisins as i'm not a fan of cooked raisins.  i also added in a teaspoon of baking power to help them rise a little more.  they were a prefect way to use up banana's and that last little of bran in the bag.

Delicious!! I made it without the apple but they still turned out perfectly fine. I would recommend adding vanilla for more flavour, and i thought they could use more raisins but thats just personal peference.. def making again.

Outstanding!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, and have to make these several times each month.  They are the best bran muffins ever, a must have for those who are into whole grains and high fiber foods.

Yum yum, very bran-y!  They don't seem to really taste like either banana or apple, but they're good!  I added some baking powder and vanilla, and just put a little honey because the fruits are already sweet. They are not extra-fluffy but not too dense either.  Yum!

I followed the recipe as shown with the exception of the raisins in which I didn't use at all.  I also added only a quarter cup honey and a quarter cup dark brown sugar.  I cut the apples into small pieces too.  And they turned out delish.  The muffins were super moist and really good and my kids finished all of them before it could even cool down. So I think it was hit.  Thanks!

Delicious.   Easy.   Low Cal.   Nutrient Rich.    Did I say delicious?    These are all of my favorite things.    Made the muffins exactly as written.   Will be keeping this recipe for sure.   Fill muffin cups all the way to the top.   They don't rise more than 1/2".     Mine were done in about 17 minutes.   Definitely don't want to over cook them.

I made these muffins with a couple alterations: I used organic coconut milk instead of the regular milk (and have since switched to just almond milk) and also used just raisin bran cereal instead of the two seperate ingredients. These muffins were so good and moist!!  My extremely picky husband who'd never even had bran muffins before absolutely loved them, (once I finally convinced him to try one that is!).  Loved them so much he wants me to make it a regular breakfast item!  Good thing he doesn't know it has healthy things in it haha!  My kids scarfed them down as well!  Better straight out of the oven, but they are also pretty good the next day.  I might add in some ground flax seed next time for added Omega 3 and I think pecans or walnuts would be a nice addition as well. The possibilities are endless with such a great recipe!

we really like this recipe. I did skip the oil and instead of shredded apple I added about 1/3 cup of applesauce.  I also sprayed the muffin tin with Pam baking spray which has flour mixed in with the oil and had no problem getting the muffins out with it. we like to mix in rhubarb instead of raisins. I also made some with dried cherries (my fav) and some with a layer of jam baked in the middle another awesome taste. very versatile recipe that is a keeper!

Oh, yum!  Delicious and moist.  I took the advise of some other commentors and added 1/4 tsp of salt and baking powder.  I substituted Blue Agave Nector for honey and blueberries for raisins.  Probably used a whole cup of blueberries.  Just enjoying mine now.  Very good. To make it just a bit healthier next time, I will probably substitute apple sauce for the butter.

I love the apple in it!!! I substituted chia seeds for the bran and used two tablespoons flax seeds. I also subbed 2 tablespoons Olive oil in for the butter. I thought they were yummy! The flax made the texture different but I still liked them. Nutty and sweet!

I would give this a 4+. It was very good, moist, and filling, too! The different fruit flavors blended perfectly!! I didn't change a thing, but thinking about adding 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts or pecans next time for extra crunch and flavor!!

I have been making these for a few years and they are delicious. Best bran muffins I have ever tasted! I subbed coconut oil for the butter and only used 1/3 cup of honey. I also used two very ripe bananas and a Granny Smith apple. I used to add 3/4 tsp of baking powder but didn't today and they still rose the same amount as with.

Excellent bran muffins!  Not dry - very moist and tasty - and filling!  My hubby can't eat raisins, so I use dried cranberries.  Love them!  You can also freeze the muffins and just pull out one or two at a time.

This is a fantastic recipe! The only change I made was I added 3/4 tsp of baking powder, per reviewer recommendation. Oh, and on half the muffins, I put a tiny drizzle of honey on the bottom and on top prior to baking; those ones came out flatter and seemed to burn around the edges a bit, and they are sticky the next day, so I don't think I would do that again. also, this was my 13 year old son's first time baking, he made them while I only helped. so the recipe is quite simple to follow. Oh, don't be alarmed if the bran doesn't absorb all the liquid; it will be fine. Also, one other thing I did; we measured out the bran (Great Value Brand) and put it in a ziplock bag, then crushed it with a rolling pin. I didn't want big chunks of bran. My favorite thing about this recipe is it is healthy, and the taste is wonderful! I don't even need to try another bran muffin recipe, this was perfect! 10 stars! Thanks Lisa!

This is my family's favorite bran muffin recipe.  We use almond milk to reduce the fat and I cut the honey to 1/4 cup.  It is plenty sweet, light and fluffy, and very tasty!  My only complaint is that these muffins stick to paper liners, so it is much better to just spray the muffin tins and omit the liners.  Absolutely DELICIOUS recipe and is consistently a hit with my two children, the grandparents, and even my fussy husband.

Too moist.  Made mine in a mini pan, and the centers stayed gooey.  Not a keeper.  I did like the honey as the sweetner.

What's great about these is how much option you have for tinkering. I only really like raisins in oatmeal cookies, so I cut them from the recipe (would've used blueberries instead, but I didn't have any on hand). I cut the sweetener down to 1/3 cup (I used Splenda because I couldn't decide whether honey or brown sugar would taste better with this particular recipe. So I used a more neutral-flavoured sweetener to see what I thought, but I think next time I may use some of both honey and brown sugar!) 
I did as other reviewers suggested, and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp baking powder. They turned out awesome. I think the apple I used was rather large, so I may opt for a medium sized one next time, as there was just a wee bit more apple than I wanted, but other than that they were great. (I chopped the apple too, rather than shredding it. I think a mid-ground would be best... really really finely diced apple, but not quite shredded.)
These muffins were really moist and had a great texture. I'll have it be known that I'll be using this as my go-to recipe for ways to use up bananas that have gotten too brown.

I made with adjustments others suggested, let the raisins plump up with the milk, egg, cereal instead of microwaving, added 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp baking powder to puff up a little, put the apple and banana in a blender to even up texture, + 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  Yummy.  Perfect 12 at 12 min. Put them in the freezer and take out a couple at time.

Fantastic recipe. I was worried because the batter was quite sweet, but once cooked these muffins had a very mildly sweet, hearty taste. I ended up making 6 giant muffins instead of 12 regular size because it's the only pan I had, and just half muffin filled me up! This is definitely going to be come a regular breakfast/snack item in my house.

Tried these today for the first time.   I had a box of All-Bran cereal that nobody in the house was eating, so I had to get rid of it!  I followed the recipe as is, except I left out the raisins, because we don't care for them in things.  I didn't have a banana, so I grated 2 small gala apples.  Batter seemed really thick, so I added a small container of vanilla yogurt.  They turned out pretty moist.  Not sure if the kids will like them, they do have a pretty "strong" bran flavor.  I thought of adding chocolate chips, but with just apple, no banana, I wasn't sure it would taste good.  I will probably use this recipe again just to use up the rest of the cereal.

These are excellent.  I, too, didn't heat the raisins in the microwave just added them to the milk mixture.  Instead of using melted butter, I cut the fat by using apple sauce.   Apples were chopped small as it was easier instead of shredding.   Anything I did was minor changes, the muffins were awesome.

I went looking for a 'banana-bran' recipe and came across this one. I love that these are healthier than most muffins, and can easily be a breakfast-on-the-go.  I make them exactly as the recipe is written (although sometimes I use chocolate chips instead of raisins to please my three year old!)
Great recipe.

I make this recipe all the time.  I only use 1/3 cup honey, olive oil instead of butter, plus a little baking powder. I don't like raisins, but I've had them without, which was still good, and I've had them with blueberries, which was awesome.  They're yummy and full of fiber!

Nice, hearty, moist muffins. I love that all of the different flavors from the banana, apple, cinnamon and honey work so well together and one doesn't over power any of the others.  Also have to love the fact that they only have 2 tablespoons of butter!  I wrapped these individually and used them as a post-workout snack on some days.  With apples coming into season soon, I will be making these again and again!

I made a few substitutions because I'm in a position where I have to use on hand ingredients. No bran cereal, so I used crushed Apple Cinnamon Cheerios and I used lowfat buttermilk instead of regular milk. These turned out really well. Exactly twelve muffins, medium-large sized. Tasty. Next time, I'd use all bananas instead of part bananas and part apples.

These are excellent! Made them exactly as written. They are pretty sweet, so next time I might reduce the honey to 1/3 cup, just to cut a few more calories. I may also substitute chopped dried apricots for the raisins, just to change it up. Great recipe! Thanks!

Unfortunately, I didn't have a few of the ingredients on hand - raisins or honey - so I used blueberries and a touch of brown sugar.  They turned out great!  I can only imagine how good they would have been with the raisins and honey!  Definitely a keeper for grad and go breakfasts during the week.

These were great. I needed to use up some ripe bananas, so I used two of those and no apples. I also added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt. These are going to become a staple! Oh, I also skipped the raisins because I have a hater in the family. But I know I would LOVE the addition of raisins. Next time.

Very good muffins!  Everyone thought they smelled wonderful baking and tasted great!  Note that I did make some vegan adjustments to the recipe to make them appeal to all house members.  First substituted an additional 1/2 mashed banana for the egg, a mixture of all-purpose flour and ground flaxseed for the whole wheat (approx. 50/50) unsweetened almond milk, vegan butter and added 1 tsp baking powder to help it rise a little more per another persons suggestion.  I will definitely make again, though may try substituting apple sauce, pears or something else for the egg for a slightly more balanced flavor.

My husband loves these. I have made them several times now. As other reviewers said, these do not rise much (even with 1/2 tsp baking powder added) so fill muffin cups more than you normally would. I made the following changes after reading the reviews: 1) Substituted applesauce for the butter 2) Added 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon vanilla  and 3) Cut apple into small chunks.

Love these muffins! My first time making bran muffins. They turn out great! They look so pretty and taste yummy. I didn’t have whole wheat flour so I used half multigrain and half all purpose flour. It didn’t say how much to fill the muffin tin so I divided them evenly into 12. The baked exactly 20 minutes. So good!

I was amazed at how good these are for being so good for you. My 3 and 4 year old boys absolutely loved them. Have another batch in the oven right now because my oldest wanted to take some to his preschool tomorrow. When he could have chosen to take anything for snack, I would say that's pretty high praise!

I used Craisins instead of raisins.  Was good and can't wait to make it again.  Hard to find the Bran Flakes in the store.  You can find them on Amazon if you need it.

Loved these muffins. Only changes I made were regular flour because I didn't have wheat flower, and I can't eat apples so I added chopped walnuts instead. Great recipe and will definitely make again.

I used Karo dark brown corn syrup & honey for the sweetener. I substituted shredded carrots for the apple. And, I soaked & microwaved the raisins in 2 tbs of spiced rum to add more flavor.

Easy and tasty! I substituted molasses for half of the honey, and added pecans, ginger, nutmeg and cardamom, so they came out a little like spice muffins. These are nice and not too sweet - just the right amount of fluffy (I don't like sticky bran muffins - these were not sticky at all, but were moist).  I used Trader Joe's Bran Flakes, and was worried that I should have crunched them up first, since they didn't dissolve much after their 5 minute soak, but they came out great!

This is an excellent recipe as is. I didn't have apples, so I used a small lunchbox size of applesauce. We love maple syrup so I used that instead.  This is not a criticism, but just to let others know if they run short of an ingredient or two, this worked as well.

Original recipe was great! I have since made several batches, using blueberries, dates, adding oats and sunflower seeds, maybe some flax seeds (have added up to 1/4 cup extra milk if adding oats or flaxseed meal). I also add some baking powder to make them a bit taller. Overall a really good reicpe!

best little recipe ever!  I've made it by the recipe, but  it is very adaptable. If I have no bananas I've also added cherries or pears and /or nuts-equally good.  Don't be afraid to play with it. As long as you keep the basic ingredients, the benefits remain.  A+ in my book!

Wonderful taste. I used 2 bananas only, as I had no apples or raisins.    I baked for only 15 minutes.  Perfectly done.  Do not use paper liners, as muffins will stick to the paper and you'll end up with 2/3 a muffin to eat.

Fantastic! My 9yo was skeptical of all the fruit I was adding, but he ended up eating 3 of them. I found them light, fluffy, moist, and satisfying, but maybe just slightly too sweet. I think the honey could be reduced since there is already sugar in the raisins, apple, banana, and bran flakes. This would also be good with chopped nuts added. 

Notes: I used bran flakes and crushed them a bit before measuring because I figure they are less dense than the classic bran cereal. It made about 30 mini muffins, and they took 13-14 minutes to bake.

We absolutely love these muffins!  I'm getting ready to make my second batch.  The only thing I did, at the suggestion of others, was to reduce the honey to 1/3 cup.  My husband and my boss thought they were perfectly sweetened.   This recipe is a keeper!

Solid muffin recipe. Kiddo liked them a lot. Will see how they freeze. There's no way in h*ll I'd have that much prep time directly post-partum, but I'd certainly make them for my new-Mama friends.

Really good, I used applesauce instead of oil/butter, used raisin bran instead of allbran, let it soak in the milk. Used more cinnamon. 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour. Used less honey and rest was splenda for baking. Made a very moist, dense muffin. Could have used nuts. Loved the many textures. Could use many different bran cereals and would be good (special K strawberry, etc). Made double batch with 22 muffins, was perfectly done at  16 min convection 385.

Although I never disliked bran muffins, they were low on my list of favorites. However, this recipe is now one of my go to "clean" muffin recipes. I know many ppl hate it when reviewers make changes, but here is what I altered: I only had bosc pears on hand so I replaced the apple with pear. I also substituted the two tablespoons of melted butter for coconut oil. Everything else was done as directed.  They had LOTS of flavor, were super moist, and don't even get me started on how good they made my kitchen smell while baking.

Had a great recipe for healthy bran muffins but I can't find it.  Used this one instead.  First of all, I followed the recipe.  Next, I think the heat temp. is too high to bake.  I questioned it when I baked in reg. muffin tins with silicone cups.  I will bake at 375 next time because bottoms of muffins got too done.  They need a little more flavor to them so maybe a little brown sugar?  Not sure, but I will try again and alter some things next time.  I like the consistency.

Tried this recipe today, and it was wonderful. I made it exactly as the recipes directs, and they came out perfectly. 

These were delicious, with a lovely moist texture unlike many bran muffin recipes. 

I like that the sugars are natural, and that there's only a half cup of honey in addition to the fruit, makes me happier giving these to my kids, and I'll be interested to play around with the recipe and make some variations eventually!

NOMMM!  I was looking for a great bran muffin recipe to use with bran cereal and overripe bananas, and this was perfect!  Instead of apple, I had a pear on hand, so chopped that instead of shredding and it turned out great (in fact - the bigger hunks of fruit seem preferable to me). My raisins didn't really plump in the microwave, so try the old-fashioned way instead - soak in water overnight in the fridge, if you can plan it. Also, I didn't have an egg, so just added an extra banana or two. Only used about 1/2 cup of honey, and still sweet enough. I did add 1 tsp vanilla to round out the flavor. Very tasty, and my 8 y.o. is begging for more healthy bran muffins (little does he know ;).

I will make it again and add cranberries instead of raisins.  The muffins are moist and have NO sugar in the recipe.

These muffins are so yummy and healthy!
Changes I made were that I added all liquid ingredients together first before Flour , baking soda and cinnamon.
I also used 1/2 cup wild blueberries dusted with flour in place of the raisins. Lastly because the apple and banana are so sweet I only used 1/3 cup honey.
They came out perfect. :~ )

These muffins surprised me with how moist they are, and how good they taste. I add 1/2 tsp baking powder, which seems to help keep them a little lighter. I definitely recommend microwaving the raisins. It only takes a minute and it's worth it.

I will definitely make these again! They are really good & not too sweet. These are an easy quick breakfast or snack. I used two small apples & I chopped them up instead (I don't have a cheese grater.) I used brown sugar & honey in place of 1/2 cup honey. I only had regular flour.

So delicious! I did soak the raisins first to make them soft - worth the extra effort! The apple and banana in it make this a very moist muffin. I didn't notice a fruity taste at all as others had mentioned

Pretty good, however I did question using 1 teaspoon baking soda., I used 1 Tablespoon Baking Powder as most muffin recipes call for baking powder., Next time I would use Kellogg's All bran cereal rather than the Bran Buds., I believe the buds have coating on them to delay getting soggy and will not desolved into a batter as the regular Bran cereal would.

I felt these were really delicious!
I decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp as I wanted to taste the bran in these muffins.  I added 1/2 tsp baking powder as someone else had suggested.   I had some raw honey produced by a friend and I used it in these muffins...they were absolutely delicious! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

My family loves this recipe.  My only changes: a teaspoon of vanilla (I add it to the milk/egg mixture before adding the cereal), and 1/8 of a teaspoon of salt.

The cooking time is WAY too long for our oven - be careful the first time you make this!  I cook them at 375'F for 14 minutes and they come out perfectly.

Great recipe made it for card club they all loved them. Only change I did was use real maple syrup instead of honey.  Use dried cranberries too, I also put a few dark chocolate chips in.  These freeze very well my husband and I eat for breakfast and evening snack!

These were great! Now one of my go-to recipes for new moms and neighbors and Sunday mornings here at the house! Sometimes I sub pumpkin for the banana and it's just as good. I usually add chocolate chips (for medicinal reasons of course!).

I didn't have any apples, but thought i'd try anyway.  I used reduced sugar craisins!  Not overly sweet (a good thing), but a little bland.  I will make sure i put the apple in next time. Perhaps even substitute the apple with berries.   Baked only for 18mins as i've got a convection oven.

I made these today as I wanted a muffin that is not full of sugar n healthy -- this one is or has the quality if not better than the bakeries.   The only thing I added was a little baking powder like had been suggested n I added 1/3 cup mixture of honey n molasses.  Other than that this is the best n will be making this more often.  Thank you so much for this recipe-; )

My children love them!  I did sub white flour for the wheat flour, so I will have to try according to the recipe next time, but they turned out fab with white flour!  Very moist and delish.  We thought they weren't done after touching the bottom of one of the muffin papers, but it turns out they are just extra moist - they were done perfectly.  I think these would be good with nuts, and/or subbing out a different fruit for the raisins too depending on what you have on hand.  A definite winner!

I found this recipe at a time when I eh...really needed them! 
I made these exactly to the recipe and they turned out perfect. They tasted great.
I have promised my fiancé that I will make these once a week for an easy breakfast or healthy mid morning snack at work.  I spread a little raspberry jam on them sometimes too.
Thanks for a great recipe.

Made this recipe for the first time this week and was pleasantly surprised with the results. This has to be THE best bran muffin recipe I have ever tried and or made. It is very moist (I am not joking!) which I have found is not always the case with bran muffins, so I was very pleased with the moisture in this muffins. Flavour was spot on as well! left the peel on the apple and used my food processor to shred it, and I did not change a single ingredient

Very moist, lightly sweetened muffin. My 6 year old liked it! I did not have a banana so I put in about 1/4 cup of low fat plain yogurt. Subbed 2 T of veg oil instead of butter. Thanks for posting!

These turned out well. I didn't really follow the directions because it seemed like more steps than necessary. So I combined all the dry ingredients in a bowl and set aside. Then used my mixer to mash the banana and chopped the apple instead of grated it, then I added the rest of the wet ingredients to the mixer and combined those before adding the dry ingredients. mixed for a minute and baked for 16 minutes. 

These were moist, flavorful and had a good combination of fruit that worked out just right. I will probably make these again sometime.

Since it's only me that will eat these in the house,  I froze most of them for later this week.  45 seconds in the microwave and they were warm and fresh and delicious.  The only changes I made to the original recipe was to use about 3/4 cup craisins instead of raisins, used 2 bananas, no apple and about 1/2 cup brown sugar (no honey).  The batter is VERY stiff and I was afraid these would be dry but they are perfect and freeze beautifully.

This is by far the best and most versatile bran muffin recipe I've ever come across! As long as you keep some moisture in the mix, you can add just about anything to it! The only thing I realized with the All Bran is there's HFCS in it! Had NO idea! So I'll be changing the bran I use from now on because I make these for my kiddos. Thanks again, this is an awesome one!

Incredible!  Followed the recipe exactly except I added a little extra baking powder and sprinkled the top with a little organic light Brown sugar and hemp hearts. A keeper for sure ;0)  Moist, lightly sweet and wonderful breakfast muffins.

These are the best bran muffins I have ever made. They are moist and quite tasty. Loved the fact that they have whole grains in them. Will definitely make again...and again.

Due to preference and ingredient availability I substituted a lot of the ingredients and I made the muffins in mini muffin tin but they came out great. I will definitely make them again! Thanks for sharing and thanks to other reviewers for help in making substitutions!

These turned out awesome. I was skeptical that they might be too heavy with so much whole wheat flour but they tasted great and my whole family loved them.  I will probably cut out some of the honey next time, I thought they were plenty sweet.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I put in half the butter and am going to try no butter next time.  I also used skim milk as I don't use anything else. They came out dense and moist - just like a bran muffin should be imh.   

My 12 yo son and I made these together... he did all the fun stuff like mashing the banana and grating the apple.  We could hardly wait till breakfast.  This is definitely a keeper!

I made these for a friend who just had a baby.  They are delicious!  I substituted Steen's cane syrup for honey to get a richer taste and I also added raw millet for some crunch because I like using millet in muffins.  Loved it!!

I just made these and they are very good. I used Kellogg's Raisin Bran cereal and added about 1/4 cup more raisins. I also used brown sugar instead of honey. Everything else I kept to the recipe.

A wonderful recipe.  I substitute a jar of baby prunes instead of banana and I'll use either chocolate chips or blueberries instead of raisins.  I've also tried this recipe with grated carrot instead of apple and it was still delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were quite good. I did not have apple or honey so I simply added an extra ripe banana and 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the honey.  Also my wheat flour had expired so I used white AP flour.  I did not plump raisins in water either. I let the egg, milk & bran soak for few minutes then added all ingredients to it, flour being last as not to overwork it. The texture was wonderful-very moist and slightly chewy on outside. Perfect amount of sweetness. Yummy!

I've made this recipe three times. It's so convenient and fast, it's replaced my store bought energy bars for the morning. 
i didn't find a difference if using butter vs applesauce other than the muffin with butter maintaining more moisture after 2 days.

Modifications I made:

1st batch - All Bran cereal, golden raisins, 1/3 c. honey, 2 Tbsp applesauce, no butter
2nd batch - Raisin Bran, craisins, 1/3 c. honey, 2 Tbsp Butter
3rd batch - All Bran cereal, craisins and golden raisins, NO honey, 2 shredded granny smith apples, juice of one orange

I liked the way my 3rd batch came out. It was still sweet and needed no honey at all.

Fantastic easy recipe! These make a great "breakfast on the go." I made them with Fiber One cereal (you should blend the cereal with the milk and egg to get the cereal to the right consistency--I used my Magic Bullet blender) and they turned out wonderfully. I made a batch with no raisins for the picky ones in the house, and added an extra half banana. I have also subbed applesauce for the shredded apple, this is easier but takes away from the texture a bit. Very customizable recipe, turns out great every time!

Easy, healthy and delicious.  I've made this recipe twice.  I substituted blueberries for raisins and used about 1/4 of honey, which is plenty sweet for my taste.  Family and friends loved them.

I cannot stop myself from eating these.  It is especially difficult because I keep rationalizing how healthy these muffins really are.
The only change I made was to add 1 tbsp vanilla.  Also, I simmered my raisins in orange juice for a few minutes before adding them.
Unlike other reviews, I did not see a need to add baking powder .... these muffins rose wonderfully.
The bake time was around 17 minutes.

Yum! Tastes like banana bran muffins. I used Raisin bran cereal, applesauce for the oil as well and used 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/3 cup of honey as suggested by others. I think walnuts would be an excellent addition!

Kid approved!  I followed the recipe with the exception of leaving out the raisins only because I didn't have any.  I was worried that they may be dry due to leaving them out, but they were not.  My son asked if he could take them to school for his whole class for milk break.  This one is mom and kid approved! Thanks!

Excellent recipe!!! Roxie's Bran Muffins have definitely deserve the 5 stars they earned. I made no changes or substitutions, and everyone in my family, all the way down to my 18 month old (including those who don't like muffins) loved these. I'm definitely adding these to my weekly baking list.

YUMMY!These are the best bran muffins I ever tasted!Even my kids liked them. I omitted the raisins because I don't like raisins.I was running out of honey so I did a 1/4 cup of honey & 1/4 cup maple syrup.

If you like healthy muffins, you will like these.  I used golden raisins and olive oi, and chopped the apples instead of shredding them. The muffins did not rise much.  I like that there is no refined sugar in this recipe.

Exactly what I was hoping for.  I followed the recipe as explained only used a jumbo muffin pan so this made 6 large muffins.  These are moist, slightly chewy and not too sweet.  I will make these again for sure.

Excellent muffins!  Took the advice of one reader and used a little baking powder (1/2 tsp.)--not sure if that was it, but these muffins definitely came out lighter and fluffier (but not yet cupcake-like) than all the other healthy muffins I've been trying.  Also used whole wheat pastry flour, instead of just regular w.w. flour.  Perfect amount of sweetness and good fruits!  Definitely will be making these often!
