I think there is an ingredient  missing from this recipe.   When followed exactly, the consistency is like a streusel topping.  I added 1/2 c. 2% milk to it and will see how they turn out.

I'm surprised by all the reviewers adding moisture. I thought the batter looked fine, even though I used whole wheat flour for 1 cup.  The texture of the baked muffin doesn't seem dry to me at all either, and I love the tangy flavor of the fresh cranberries.

What a simple delicious recipe! I, like others wanted a little more moisture, so I added 1/4 c. of spiced tea. I also added pecans because I like a little crunch in my muffins.  These are perfect for any time and they go so well with a cup of tea.  I made them in this beautiful rose muffin pan I just picked up at a craft fair.  The next time I make them, I will dribble a sugar/milk glaze on top. Thank you Pitterpat of sharing this recipe.

Good basic muffin batter. I added apple sauce and cut down on the sugar. I also added a lot of pumpkin pie spice with extra cinnamon. (1 1/2 c. sauce, 3 tbls cinnamon, 1/2 tblsp pie spice.)  It was still pretty dry and I will add the spice tea mentioned next time.I also added pecans for crunch. We really liked this !!

As written, the batter was too dry.  Adding 1/2 cup of applesauce will make it 4-star recipe.  The batter will still be very dense.  Next time I'll reduce the brown sugar to compensate for the sweetness of the applesauce that I'll continue to add.

I didn't read the reviews before trying this recipe, so I was surprised at the consistency of the batter.  Then I checked the reviews.  I added 1/2 cup 1% milk so it came up to a more appropriate consistency.  After 18 minutes they still weren't finished, so I added 10 minutes to the baking time.  With these changes, they turned out really nicelly.

I changed the recipe after reading the previous reviews.  I also added liquid, about 1/3 cup of skim milk.  I added about 1/2 of the bag of cranberries and for the oil, I added 2 tblsp of canola and 2 tblsp of lemon flavored olive oil.  I liked the hint of lemon. This was a great recipe and I will be making them again soon.

Good apple flavour.  Doubled the recipe and added about 3/4 cup milk to make the mixture into a thick batter.  Resulted in 18 regular sized muffins.  May try this recipe again, but with some adjustments to the liquid content.  It is a lower fat muffin loaded with fruit!

The ratio of liquid to flour seemed extremely off the first time I made these; the dough was very dry and unworkable. The second time I added 1/2 cup of milk/juice, and an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar. 

The cranberries and apples required for this recipe also seem off; the amount I ended up with is almost three times the amount that can go in the batter, hence making this a second time with the modifications above.

I found the batter too dry so I added 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup almond milk, also I substituted brown sugar with coconut sugar and used frozen whole cranberries. They turned out great !!

Made the mix for these and it was very stiff. Added about 3 tablespoons of orange juice and they turned out very tasty. Maybe this  recipe needs some adjustment.

I added about a 1/4c oil AND milk - the batter just seemed really dry. I used dried cranberries and also 1/8-1/4c cranberry sauce (leftovers!).
Regardless - the muffins are very good - lots of caramel-like flavour  with lots of fruit.
Will make again!

The fruit and batter seem out of proportion and the mixture seemed dry when placing it in the muffin tin. I made these twice, adding an extra egg the 2nd time. Won't make them again.

Made following adjustments:
1/8 c veg. oil
1 single serve container unsweetened applesauce
reduce brown sugar to 1/2 c

Batter consistency turned out fine. Muffins were moist and yummy but missing some flavor. We're going to add some more cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves/ginger.

I agree with the other reviewers that the batter was a little dry, so I added 5 Tbsp. orange juice.  I also doubled the apple quantity (used 2 small Granny Smiths).  Ordinarily I would substitute half of the oil for applesauce to save some calories, but since I didn't have any, I used all the oil called for.   Very good; a good balance of tart and not-too-sweet. :)

Followed the recipe to a T, and it looked more crumbly than a batter. I added 1/2 cup 2% milk and baked it at 350 for 25 minutes. They look great!

I read the reviews before making the recipe. I followed the advice of adding milk (1/3 cup.) I also added a couple dashes  of each nutmeg and apple pie spice. I left the brown sugar as stated in the recipe. I had to use dried cranberries so I soaked them for about 15-20 minutes in warm water, drained and added into batter with apple. Turned out with nice texture, not dry, not too sweet. Goes well wit butter or whipped cream cheese spread on them

Just made these for the first time this morning and they were wonderful, although I too made a few changes. I didn't have any eggs so I substituted one of the eggs for 1/3 cup of applesauce and the other egg for 1 tablespoons of ground flaxseed and 3 tablespoons water. I also added 1/3 cup of rice milk based off of other reviews that it was too dry. Turned out perfect, baked for 20 minutes.

This turned out to be a very dense batter, like cookie dough.  But it will turn out fine after baking. \

My 13 yr old daughter and I made these together and agreed it needed more moisture as others recommended. So, we added 1/4 C of a fruit compote of apples, cranberries and raisins that I already had made (it was similar to applesauce).  It definitely helped the consistency. My family loved the flavor! It took 22-24 minutes in my oven to be toothpick clean and not over cooked.

I thought it the batter was toooo thick, so I added more oil, about 2 T extra, filled the liner to the top, baked them 17-18 min.,
Very moist and flavorful, will make againl but add pecans next time.

I changed the recipe because I did not have any fresh cranberries (not available in Fl at this time of year)...I added 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts...I also had to add 1/4 cup buttermilk (a previous reviewer suggested adding a little liquid)...I used gluten-free biscuit and baking mix...The muffins weren't bad! They were pretty tender...So I would make this recipe again...

I peeled and cored the apple, used about 1/2 bag of cranberries and I added 1/4 cup water to the recipe and baked for 23 min. They were really good and very moist!
