good stuff! I used storebought pesto because I was too eager to try this recipe (read: too lazy) to make my own. the pesto-in-a-jar had citric acid, so it didn't need an entire tsp of lemon juice. I can't say for sure, but I imagine that if you used homemade pesto this wouldn't be a problem. I used a muenster/provolone combination & sliced black olives because that's what I had in my cupboard. I also didn't add anywhere near 2 tbsps of mayonnaise; just enough to bind it all together will do. my final suggestion would be to place the tortilla flat in a skillet to warm & lay the cheese on top to melt it. microwaves do terrible things to bread products, imo. I enjoy finding new, delicious, inexpensive ways to prepare tuna, so thank you for the recipe!

A nice variation of tuna salad!  The amount of sauce is perfect for 2 cans of tuna (instead of 1), but that just dilutes the zing of the recipe.  Next time I'd try the sauce with only 1 T of mayo (keeping the rest of the sauce ingredients as written,) and it would be about the right amount of moisture for 1 can of tuna.  The 6 oz cans of tuna have been replaced by 5 oz cans, so keep that in mind too. I didn't microwave the tortilla.  We like to toast our wraps in a medium-hot nonstick skillet, so I layer the ingredients with the cheese first (so it melts), then the tuna, lettuce, & kalamata olives.  Put the seam side down first, and as they toast just roll them a little at a time until the outside is toasted.  Makes a great, light lunch.  Served with fresh, garden tomatoes topped with a light dressing and feta on the side.

This is ok at best. I made it to recipe pretty much exactly and all I could taste was tuna. I thought the pesto olive combo would take away some of the tuna taste but no. We wont make it again.

This recipe is fantastic! I've made it for lunch almost every day for the last few weeks.  A few times, I've substituted canned chicken for a less fishy taste & it works just as well.

Was not very impressed. I made this exactly as directed and was hoping for more flavor. But all I tasted was the tuna. The pesto and olives might as well have not even been in there. Won't be repeating this one.

We have made this recipe several times. It’s one of our favorite tuna meals. We also use store bought pesto. We also don’t use the amount of mayo that’s indicated. You should adjust the mayo amount to your taste preference.

This is a great change of pace for salad lovers. I changed a few things due to where I live and what is available in our very small grocery store.  When I made the Basil Pesto I uesd only sunflower seeds instead of Pine Nuts and Brazil nuts. It is light, cool, and very tasty.

Excellent recipe - base for creativity/lack of things in the fridge! I had tuna, sour cream, dried basil, olive oil, salt and garlic, and all of this wrapped in warm flat bread went really well with a fresh salad! Thanks for sharing.
