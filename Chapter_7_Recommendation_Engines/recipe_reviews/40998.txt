This is a great recipe, exquisite taste.  The recipe makes a lot, 1/2 the recipe would be plenty

I thought this salsa was great! I could tell that some of my guest didn't quite care for it since the bowl was still full at the end of dinner. Overall, I thought it was very good and different from the ordinary salsas.

This is a great combination--baked ham with pineapple takes on a whole new meaning.  I loved the spicy kick of the salsa, and the sweetness of the fruits compliment the salty ham.  Mmmmmm....
