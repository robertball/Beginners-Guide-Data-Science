Very good!  I kept thinking I needed to add pepper or something but I didn't and it turned out great.  My husband added sriracha to his though.

Everyone in the family loved this soup.  It has more flavor than I expected.  I made a half batch but wish I made a full one for leftovers.  I used 32 oz of chicken broth for the half batch instead of the water and bouillon.  I kept everything else the same. Will definitely be making this again soon.

I had some smaller heads of Pak Choi growing in a raised bed that was free but I had no idea what to do with it. I substituted 3 small heads of that, used 4 large Idaho potatoes cubed, about 5 chives diced and the onion bulbs from the chives as a substitute for the full sized onion. The rest I did double but the same for carrots/celery/garlic and chicken. Boy did it turn out delicious and since most of the stuff was growing in my garden cheap! My boyfriend gave it a rave review as well.

Ok so this was super easy to make and I had some Bok Choy that I was dying to get rid of as well as other veggies so I decided to give it a whirl. I added mushrooms and bought a whole chicken already prepared from the market (3month old keeps me VERY busy lol) and all I had to do was shred it off the bone and throw in the pot. 

I really enjoyed the soup and def is worth making. A little on the sweet side for some reason I think I would throw in a little squeeze of fresh lemon just for a little zing. 

So all in all, very good. Not 5 star good but def woth the 4 stars. My husband says the same thing. 

Happy Eating people!!!! xoxo

Din't add potatoes.  We added soy sauce and sriracha, which helped. Great stew like dinner.

We had some bok choy that needed to be eaten, so we gave this a try. It was amazing. Even my picky 16-month old loved it. Only downside is it's a lot of veggies to chop when you have a toddler hanging on your leg!

Surprisingly good soup!  Needed a way to use some bok choy so gave this a try with low expectations.  My husband asked for seconds but added sriracha sauce, and I liked it made pretty much as described.  Used homemade broth, and didn't have white potatoes so I used 1 sweet potato and some rice.  The kids (7 & under) ate their whole bowls without too many complaints (which is a compliment from my picky eaters).

As others have said ,I thought this would be flavorless, having no seasonings at all, but it was absolutely delicious! If you want a little more flavor, just add some soy sauce and sesame oil. But I thought it was great without it. This is definitely a keeper!

I used toasted sesame oil, added some fresh ginger with the garlic and used about 3 heaping tablespoons of chicken "better than boullion" and a splash of low sodium soy sauce. Looks and smells fantastic!!

The hubs summed it up like this: "You couldn't have done it any better"
I did add a pinch of cilantro and used bone broth instead of water. Turned out great.

Good refreshing soup. Did not have potatoes. Subbed parsnips in its place. It gave the soup a rooty sweetness that was very enjoyable.

I caramelised the onions in canola and sesame oil, and put some sesame seeds in it. Too, I added a lot of sriracha and a little bit of rice vinegar for acidity
It was very good!
If I had to redo it, I would add more bok choy and less potatoes. Too, I would add a looot of sesame oil for that asian taste!
Still, an all-around very pleasant soup, very easy to make for beginners like me!

I par-boiled b/s chicken thighs reserving liquid to use as base. Cut chicken up, added chicken and vegetable broths, then added vegetables, with sweet onion, celery, and garlic having been sauteed. Food for the soul.

This soup was my first foray into bok choy and I'm sold.  The recipe itself has become a regular on our rotating schedule of favorites.  It's absolutely perfect as is but we like to add some shelled deveined shrimp about five minutes before serving.  Makes a very satisfying complete meal.

Excellent flavor.  I used 2 heads of baby bok choy.  And used chicken  broth.  It was very thick and full of vegetables.

Very good, clean tasting soup, but also needing a bit more flavor.   Salt and pepper or a splash of soy sauce adds a lot to this.   My first recipe with Bok Choy.

This is a great basic recipe.  The proportions of the ingredients give the soup a nice balance.  You could sub kale or cabbage for the bok choi and it would be just as good.  The next time I make it, I will spice it up a little.  And I definitely will make it again.

You so not need any oil. Just add all your Ingredients onions chicken celery bok hog and chicken broth I  uy college Inn and use 2 48 ounice boxes. If it's 2 price eyes for the chicken broth use chicken boulion.  Take skins off ckiChen it will be less greasy. Additing 1 small can of del Monte tomatoe sauce give especially it nice color . A sprinkle of grated cheese and serve. Dill is good to add in each bowl   chop finely delish.

So easy and good!!!!! I've never done anything with bok choy before, so I decided to give it a go.  I have a gluten sensitivity, so I used a box of liquid gluten-free chicken broth.  I added a cup of frozen stir-fry mixed vegetables instead of the potatoes and carrots. I added chunks of lobster.  I was shocked that I didn't have to add salt, pepper or soy sauce. This soup was so flavorful.  Next time I'll use the carrots and chicken. I just wanted to use what I had and didn't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.  This was a perfect, easy dish that everybody loved.

This soup was delicious!  Both my husband and I loved it.  Modified it slightly so I could cook it in my crock pot.  I kept the chicken breasts whole and added all the ingredients to the crock pot (except the bok choy).  Cooked it on low for 8hrs.  Then I removed the chicken and shredded it.  Added the chicken and the bok choy back to the crock pot and cooked for another 30 or so min....just until the bok choy was tender.

I have made this several times. It's one of my families' favorites. They ask for it! So healthy and yummy! We've made it without the chicken meat in it, also, for a great Meatless Monday meal. So good with some crusty bread for dipping. Thanks for sharing this one!!

This is an excellent recipe I make all the time.  I double the carrots because I don't think it has enough and I cook rice separately (instead of potatoes) and serve it over that and I add pepper and a little bit of Crazy Jane's season salt.  If you cook the rice in the recipe, the rice gets too mushy with any leftover soup.  My very picky family of 6 all love this very healthy recipe!!

I added ginger and it really popped. I'd eat this again. Oh, and I added soy sauce and that added good salty flavor.

Very good and very easy. I thought at first doesn't seem like it will have a lot of flavour and as I cut the Bok choy I worried it was too much. However it is delicious. Enjoy.

Loved this recipe! Super simple and very tasty. I just enrolled in Farm Fresh to You so I had all seasonal fresh veggies to use. I had never cooked with bok choy before and this was the best first trial. I didn't let the veggies cook as long as this recipe stated (20 minutes), I only brought the chicken broth to a boil and simmered for about five minutes because I used precooked rotisserie chicken and the veggies were perfectly cooked. I also didn't use potatoes as I really am not a starchy eater. I will make this soup again. Thank you for this new favorite go to meal!

This was a great way of using bok choy, a comforting nutritious soup. I served it with slices of homemade whole wheat bread and mugs of milk. (With gluten-free crackers and a different beverage this could easily be a safe meal for my gluten/dairy sensitive friends.) My children and I enjoyed this soup. I had to substitute sweet potatoes for the carrots, which usually works for my soups but I think this one has such a delicate flavor it really does need the carrots, both for flavor and texture. I'll use carrots next time. I also only had low sodium Better Than Boullion Chicken Base, so I did have to add salt to my bowl, no big deal. I think some parsley might be a good addition. I look forward to making this again.
