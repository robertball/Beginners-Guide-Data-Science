Good on its own or equally good served over ice cream.  Doing this totally covered in the microwave does not give the "alcohol" a chance to cook off, and that's the only thing I disliked about this recipe.  It is very quick to make, delish, and if that alcohol taste bothers you a lot (and it may not), you always could just cook it off on top of the stove to get only the pure rum flavor, add the plantains, and then into the microwave to finish it off.  Also, I had enough butter-sugar syrup to cook another plantain, so you may want to keep that in mind if you need additional servings.  Do not overcook the plantains or they will turn to mush.

This was a really good recipe for plantains. I made it on the stove instead of the microwave, since I already had the pan out to toast the almonds. It only took a few minutes. I don't actually think it needed the almonds. Next time I will leave them out.

Plantains are usually too bland for me to enjoy them much.  I really enjoyed the sweet turn you put on this and the rum and butter flavor were great together

I've tried this recipe a few times, as is and it is really easy and good. However, tonight, I substituted white for brown sugar as well as adding pineapple infused rum. Delicious!!

Saved for the rum sauce part of the recipe but overall very good! The rum sauce is also good on top of Apple Crisp!
