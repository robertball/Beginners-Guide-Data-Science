This was a really tasty, simple recipe.   Both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I left out the tomatoes, as neither of us are tomato fans, but it was still excellent.

A good, quick recipe for using up leftovers. I'm not sure where the "zesty" comes into this recipe; I felt it was a tad bland. I left out the tomato and used red peppers to add some more color. I also added thyme and garlic.

Very tasty. I baked in the oven, and sliced the potatoes with a mandolin.
