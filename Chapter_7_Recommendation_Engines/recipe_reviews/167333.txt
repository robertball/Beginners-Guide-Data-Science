These were okay.  My boyfriend loved them but I really wasn't a fan.  Needed to be more rhubarb/sugar, less flour.  The texture and taste of the flour just made the filling become pastey.  I think they are a good idea in theory, but the recipe needs to be perfected a little more.  Also, the ingredient list needs to be more specific than just "5 stalks rhubarb" since stalks of rhubarb can come in many sizes.

These were great! Always looking for a new way to use up my rhubarb, and these hit the spot. I did put some icing sugar on them, but wouldn't need to as the flavor is great!

Made these for a BBQ and everyone LOVED them!  I served them sprinkled with powdered sugar and raspberry syrup on the side.
