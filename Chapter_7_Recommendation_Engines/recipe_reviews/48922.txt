I have to admit this is some of the BEST marinated grilled chicken we've had from this site.  I marinated this for 8 hours so I wanted to concentrate the marinade -leave out the water there's no purpose for it, add more of one of the liquids if it's too thick. I used boneless chicken that I pounded down to 1/2 inch.  I used olive oil vs. sesame and dijon vs. honey mustard.  I also used 2 tsp. of liquid smoke and because I didn't use water I used 2 Tbsp. of orange juice vs. orange zest.  I also didn't have fines herbs so I used a combination of parsley, tarragon and marjoram.  The brown sugar made everything carmelize on the grill and the result was a moist sweet, yet smoky herbed chicken breast. I didn't even use the rosemary that I had as I had forgotten all about it.  Simply delicious and one to make for guests!

Made this last weekend and plan to make it again for a family get together on July 4th. It was a hit with my family. Very good flavor that permiated through the chicken. Husband and both boys LOVED IT! Would be good to use in a chicken salad too. I rate it A+

I marinaded a whole chicken in this mixture for over 24 hours in the fridge.  I put the chicken and marinade in a gallon size plastic bag in a tupperware dish, and turned it over every 6 hours or so to keep it marinaded evenly.  I used the rotisserie on our Weber grill, cooked it at 375F for 1.75 hours, and it turned out great!  I put big chunks of garlic under the skin of the chicken, and also in the cavity before grilling, and this made it more flavorful.  Our whole family loved it, and we will be using this recipe again for sure.

I followed the recipe with a couple of changes.  I omitted the orange zest based on some of the other reviewers comments.  Since I have a gas bbq and thus, no coals, I placed the chicken on the grill and then placed several springs of rosemary over the chicken as it cooked.  This worked well.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful and everybody loved it.  I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the number and cost of all these ingredients.  It wouldn't be a marinade I'd want to use all the time but will definitely make every now and then.

Very delicious!  I was a little apprehensive about all the water, but marinating overnight, the chicken breasts really soaked up all the liquid and flavors too.  Only thing I did different was use peanut oil as that's all I had, with no bad effects.  I skewered chunks of the chicken on the rosemary like kabobs.  Will make this often!!

Very tasty! I did not have time to marinate overnight. So, I left out the water to concentrate the flavors. I used skinless boneless breast that I cut into strips. I marinated them for about 4 hours before grilling. Delicious!

This was very good, but not sure if worth all the work. Rest of family loved it. Breast came out the best. Will make again with bone-in chicken breast and skip cutting up a whole chicken and trying to use the legs and thighs and other dark meat parts that did not come out as well as the white meat.

This unusual melange of ingredients somehow came together to produce a deliciously moist grilled chicken.  I used 1.5 cups prepared Italian dressing instead of the listed water/dry dressing mix and minced parsley, chives and tarragon (no chervil) for the fines herbs. Marinated bone-in breasts overnight and grilled on a gas grill over a bed of rosemary.  Despite the strong flavors in the marinade, not one particular flavor stood out -- thanks for the recipe DIXYCHIK.

I made this for my in-laws and there was alot of uncomfortable silence at the meal.  The orange zest is quite strong - my husband claims it gave him heartburn for two days.  If I made it again, I would drastically reduce the zest.

This recipe is so easy and the chicken came out so moist!!! Will definitely continue making over and over! I took the advise of others and I marinaded my chicken before I put it in the freezer and when I need it, it will be ready to go!

I wouldn't say this is the best but it's pretty good. The chicken is very tender and has a nice flavor. I haven't used it for pasta salad yet but I'm sure it would make a very tasty dish.

The instructions provided on cutting/butterflying the bird were perfect.  I never thought it could be so easy!  The marinade was good, but not worthy of 5 stars.  (The left-over chicken made some killer chicken salads the following day.)  I'm anxious to try this cooking technique with other marinades and spice rubs.  Keep a close eye on the grill.  The marinade is oily and can really get the fire going.  Oh, and be prepared... the seasame oil is a little expensive.

Absolutely delicious!  We had just come home from taking our dogs to the vet, and I wanted to BBQ some chicken.  I went to Allrecipes.com and searched for "grilled chicken".  Best Marinated Grilled Chicken came up.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was better than I would have ever expected.  This would be a great dish to fix at a summer picnic.  Very easy!

Excellent flavor, wonderful result. 

I prepared this marinade the night before and put the marinating chicken breasts in the fridge overnight. I did cut the breasts in half and also separated the tenders to maranade separately. Basically, I had really thick pieces, average thickness and thin (tenders) pieces. I cook each group with different start or end times depending on the event. 

During my dinner party, I lost track of time and severely overcooked the thicker and average thickness chicken pieces. My digital thermometer showed 190 to 200 degrees by the time I pulled the chicken off of the grill. I like 165 and slightly more. The long marinade soak time saved the meal. The chicken was moist and tender throughout. I was amazed. 

The only problem I found with the recipe is that it calls for rice wine. At my local grocery, we decided it was 'sake', not rice wine vinegar so I used the sake.  I really don't know what was expected. 

All in all, a 5 star marinade.

I replaced the water with half water and half asian sesame dressing otherwise I left everything else the same. I marinated overnight chuncks of chicken, beef, peppers, onions, and zucchini then skewered and grilled them. Delicious.

I'm sorry to say that this recipe has very o.k. on flavor and not outstanding. I followed the recipe to the T.  Found that considering the amount and price of the sesame oil, it wasn't worth the taste or effort.  Will not make again.

Amazing! I don't really like vinegar, so I only added a splash. Doubled the honey mustard. I didn't have fresh rosemary so I added the Rosemary in my spice rack, about 2 teaspoons in the marinade. I also added parsley, chicken herb seasoning, smoked paprika instead of regular paprika. I didn't have liquid smoke but I added chipotle to it. I don't like ginger, so I halved it. Came out tender, very moist, and full of flavor. I thought I was in a 5 star restaurant! Everyone loved it!

My first review (in a long time anyway). This was precisely as stated, simply the best ever! I improvised with what I had, Zesty Italian dressing, white cooking wine and rice vinegar for the rice wine, sweet hot mustard, lemon zest (just a little), fresh ground ginger, and a mixture of my best spices (allspice, cardamom and cumin) for the herbs. A little fresh garlic, and a pinch of curry powder, along with the ingredients listed. I didn't have the marinade time, but I have a little baby cast iron skillet I cook my extra marinade in, on the top rack of the grill. I let it caramelize without burning and use as finishing glaze/dip. I used boneless chicken breasts cut into tenders size. Grilled Zucchini, and a kick butt salad. Best meal in a long time, here at home OR out! Glad I looked up my recipe box tonight!

Excellent! I marinated a whole 5lb chicken (using Tamari & skipping the orange zest) for about 20 hrs. I loosened the skin & poured the marinade right under the skin, the rest in the cavity.  350 degrees on the gas grill rotisserie.  Got too busy, so I over cooked the thighs to 185 degrees.  The breast was still perfectly moist.  The meat practically fell off the bones without feeling greasy.  The crispy skin on the wings was the best.  Great flavor!
