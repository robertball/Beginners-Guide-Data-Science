Excellent! This was super simple and full of flavor. I'm typically not a big mint fan but it goes nicely with the lamb and rosemary in this recipe. For the sauce be sure to use the extra virgin olive oil as called for. It makes a big difference in the end flavor.

I made this for a rack of lamb with 8 baby chops. I just added about 5-6 garlic cloves minced and used the juice of a whole lemon. I roasted in the oven on at 375 on convection roast until the thermometer came out to 160. Was perfect!

I love this recipe!  I did add additional mint, garlic powder and some pure honey to the mint sauce due to the amount of sauce i needed along with I was a little heavy handed on the lemon zest.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe for a large group, and it was fantastic! Served the lamb in small plate fashion for a presentation. I will certainly be making this again!

Lamb chop on their own are delicious...but oh my the mint flavor took them over the top.
