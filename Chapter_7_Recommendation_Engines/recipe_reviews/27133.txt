This anglaise was wonderful over mixed berries. As another reviewer put to aptly, it thickened up beautifully and velvety smooth. This is the perfect touch to a decadent dessert or a very simple one. We prefer ours a little less sweet, so I will reduce sugar to 1/4 to 1/3 cup next time.Thanks Meshel!

Very good over fresh strawberries.  I didn't have the vanilla bean, so I added a splash of vanilla extract to the egg yolks.  Really good flavor and my butter was salted, but didn't seem to make a difference.  Yes it's sweet but a little goes a long way.  Thanks for this yummy treat Meshel.

This recipe is a bit sweet.  If you have a rich dessert
I would suggest that you lower the sugar amount to 1/3 cup.
Other than that suggestion, this Anglaise is good enough to
eat all by itself.  It thickened up nicely and is velvety
smooth.

Good, but a bit too sweet.  I wish I read the previous reviews and cut down on the sugar.  Rather than buying half and half I decided to use up the little bit heavy whipping cream I had left over and mixed in some lowfat milk at the very end to thin it out.

I made this to put on top of bread pudding. I'd never made a vanilla sauce before, but it looked easy enough. I halved the recipe and instead of cream, I used whole (homo) milk and vanilla extract. Other reviewers said to not let it cook too long, so I watched it carefully and I also strained it before serving. It came out perfectly, even using the lower fat milk. It was delicious warm, and wonderful cold the next day. Yummy!

i used 2 tsp vanilla in place of the bean. same amount of sugar as i have a sweet tooth so it didn't seem like a lot. keep stirring when you pour the egg mixture into the cream mixture. stir continuously while heating. remove from heat as soon as it starts thickening. also, strain it before serving to get rid of the few lumps and to get a perfect consistency. it was the perfect accompaniment for a bread pudding i made from here.

This is a lovely custard sauce. Very decadent. Mine came out too yellow - I should've known sooner that I was suppose to whip the egg yolks and sugar until almost white. My first time using vanilla bean, so there were some black specks floating - I later learnt that that was normal. Also, the heat was probably a bit too high coz the custard turned into  little globs. I solved this by using a handheld blender after taking the saucepan off the stove. This made the custard sauce velvety smooth! Had this with bread pudding. Was really good!

It has a great flavor, mine got a tad bit too thick for my tastes, but maybe I cooked it too long.

Such a nice flavor. I too used vanilla extract instead of a bean. Loved it on the Bread Pudding III from this site.

This is a great creme anglaise recipe, simple and traditional.  I do not buy vanilla beans so I just use pure vanilla extract.  Its also important to note that you MUST heat half and half on medium heat ONLY.  Same goes for the mixture after the eggs are added, keep on medium heat and STIR CONSTANTLY.  Any high heat and the mixture may begin to scorch on the bottom and have lumps.  I added the vanilla after removing from heat as well as about 3 tbsp of bourbon whisky.  YUMM!!!! Was amazing over warm bread pudding.  If you have cold bread pudding, I suggest warmiing it in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes then add the creme anglaise cold...the bread pudding will warm up the sauce! SOOO YUMMY!

This is a wonderful and very versatile recipe.  I didn't have the vanilla bean and decided that I wanted a different flavor, so I used a butter rum extract that I recently purchased from a cake decorating store.  Nummy!  It kinda tasted like a butter rum Lifesaver!  I spooned some on the bottom of a plate, placed a serving of bread pudding on top of it, and then drizzled all of that with a warm caramel sauce that I made.  The 9x13 pan was gone in ten minutes.  Thanks for such a wonderful tasting and incredibly easy recipe!

Oh my goodness, this is good. I made this for a bread pudding recipe I also found on Allrecipies. I didn't have cream, so I substituted 2% milk with a few tablespoons coffee creamer in it's place. Also, I didn't have any vanilla beans, so I substituted Real Vanilla Extract for that.  I would definitely make this again!

Perfect. I wanted a quick and easy, yet tasty sauce to serve with some banana bread to make it a little more elegant for a dinner time dessert. This recipe was easy and quick and turned out delicious.

Pretty good - not exactly what I was looking for though. I made it to go over bread pudding, and it was just too eggy flavored to me. Think egg nog without the spices... Rated 4 stars though, because the recipe came together well.

Great taste but did what another reader did and used milk wouldn't recommend.  Didn't thicken properly and kinda broke and didn't stay together.  Taste was very good though.

Wonderful, especially when served warm! Very simple flavor that enhances the dish. I would add a flavored liquor, maybe an almond or white chocolate liquor, next time, and also maybe cinnamon.

As other reviewers have stated, this recipe is way too sweet! 1/3-1/4 c sugar would be perfect! I had completely forgotten to reduce the sugar so my sauce was too sweet. To conteract the sweetness, I added a squeeze of lemon juice to the finish product (the sauce was quite thick so I added just enough to cut the sweetness without thinning out the sauce too much). I also omitted the butter since the sauce was quite rich on it's own. Great recipe!

Nice directions and straightforward to prepare.  Thickened nicely.  Thought it tasted too "eggy" although I had no curdling or evidence of solids in my sauce.  Compared ingredients to other versions (including Julia Child) and the cream in the other versions was twice the amount in this one.  Think I will double the cream next time to cut back on the egg flavor.

Excellent Creme Anglaise. Very easy to make and easy to adjust....I did cut a bit of the sugar, I also scraped the vanilla bean to give it a very vanilla flavor. I also used vanilla sugar. It was wonderful!

I thought this was easy and tasted wonderful on bread pudding.  I was out of half and half, so I had to use milk instead, and it still came out great.  I also didn't have a vanilla bean but added a teaspoon of extract when I stirred in the butter.  I will make this again.

Absolutely delicious. Smooth and rich and divinely creamy. I made half the recipe and used half of a vanilla bean that I'd already taken the seeds from for something else. But there were still a lot of seeds left even after scraping them out, so they all went into the sauce. Great recipe.

This recipe had the perfect ingredient list for me -- I was looking to use up egg yolks and heavy cream.  I used half heavy cream and half milk with the tablespoon of vanilla recommended by other members, and it is delicious!  One note -- I wasn't sure by what the "until mixture coats the back of a metal spoon" point was, but here's my recommendation: stir until it thickens, but do not let it come to a boil.  When it starts to boil, it starts to get a finely lumpy texture.  I pulled it off the stove at that point, so mine isn't perfectly smooth.  But it is still delicious!!

Agree that it's a little too eggy than expected for creme anglaise.  Used vanilla bean paste (from Williams Sonoma) which gave it outstanding vanilla taste!  (Next time check Joy of Cooking, Julia Child)

I made bread pudding.  Made a cinnamon apple compote and then topped with the anglaise.  I made enough for 130 people.  They were licking their bowls.

Fantastic after I cut down the sugar.  I served it over soft Ginger Cake to 130 very happy people at a Christmas Festival.  To those who have problems with lumps, try cooking the egg and milk together in a non-reactive bowl over a pot of boiling water (double boiler style).  Just make sure you add some hot cream to the egg first, as instructed.  It doesn't take much longer and it's almost impossible to overcook the egg.

This sauce is delicious with any dessert. I recently served it with bread pudding and the combination was heavenly.  I didn't have vanilla bean on hand, so I used vanilla extract instead. I don't know if it took away from the original recipe.

Good directions. I made it 2 ways. For both I cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup. For the first sauce, I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean. For the second sauce I used the zest of one lemon instead of the vanilla bean. After the sauce was cooked, I strained out the zest. Farm eggs gave both sauces a beautiful golden colour. They were delicious served over fresh berries.

Delicious and so easy to make. I halved the recipe. I used half milk and half heavy cream, 1 tsp pure vanilla extract and forgot to add the butter. Tasted great over tea soaked french toast with maple syrup.

Most definitely recommend with bread pudding.  This recipe also works great if you have extra evaporated milk to use up.

My first attempt at home made custard, it worked perfectly, no lumps.  I served it with Bread Pudding I also from this site and they were a perfect match I did cut the sugar down a little but not much.  I will definately make this again!

Excellent--a nice, basic creme anglaise dish that tastes exactly as it's supposed to. I used a tablespoon of real vanilla extract and that worked just fine.

Excellent recipe.  I used it as a sauce for my banana wrapped crepe.  I had sliced bananas, topped with the creme and wrapped in the crepe.  I topped the crepe with the creme again and dribbled with chocolate sauce.  Kids and adults love it!!

A wonderful recipe for creme anglaise... simple to make.  I like to use this smoothed over a slice of angel food cake and then topped with a scrumptious combination of fresh blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries.
