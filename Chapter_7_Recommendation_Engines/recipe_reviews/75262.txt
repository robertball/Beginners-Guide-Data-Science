Very delicious! We added a dash of Tony Chachere's creole seasoning, a dash of garlic powder and half a 7 oz. jar of spicy greek peppers for an added kick! We also doubled the recipe for a large party, and it was excellent.  Yummo!

Delicious.  This is a recipe I will certainly use again.  I love olives, but may reduce the amount of olives next time I prepare this.  The olives were the most discernable component of this recipe--slightly more than might be ideal for my taste.  I expected more of a spicy bite than there was, so I may also increase the cayenne pepper next time.  As is, this is a very good recipe, but it's one that is "tweakable" for your personal preference.

I didn't have the artichokes on hand (do love them artichokes, though!) --and I did have some olive salad (Tassos brand, chopped up olives with a few other little bits thrown in) so I substituted (and left out the oil, because the olive salad had oil & plus I don't like a lot of oil in my cole slaw). But it was still great - excellent balance of vinegar, mustard, sugar, and cayenne. This will make an AWESOME topping for a sub sandwich or mufuletta!

This slaw is a little different. Tasty. Much different than a mayonaise based slaw.
