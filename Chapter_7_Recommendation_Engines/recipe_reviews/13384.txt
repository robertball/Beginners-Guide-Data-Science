Wonderful soup as is. However, I have made a few changes to "kick it up, a notch". I have added a bay leaf, a couple cloves of garlic, and a pinch of thyme. Instead of the ham bone, I used a ham hock and used up some left over ham cubes I had in the freezer. I also lightly sauteed the onions with some garlic in a little bit of EVOO before adding the Ham Hock. I also did half chicken stock and half water... sure makes a differance in flavor. I also find 2 cups of dried peas, instead of 2 1/2 is more than enough as this soup tends to end up a tad too thick.

I used this recipe as a base for my own creation. This was simply the best soup I have ever made.  I did boil the ham hock in chicken broth instead of water for 1 hour ahead of time.  Then I added the split peas  and pepper (I omitted the salt).  I added about 2 cups of diced carrots, 2 cups of celery and 2 cups of potatoes.  I added 2 garlic cloves, some parsley flakes, thyme, onion powder (since I left the onions out), 2 bay leaves and the taste was amazing!  I was going to blend the split peas before I added the other stuff, but they lost form and made the soup a lot thicker.  I hope I can replicate this soup, it was off the hook!

This recipe is great and can be tweeked to your own preference. I threw all the ingredients into a crock pot, didn't rinse the peas and threw the ham bone in with all the meat on. I cooked it on high for several hours. I probably added more liquid than the recipe called for but then I just threw in a whole bag of dried split peas..so thought I would need more liquid. THe soup was REALLY thick, and so I add more chicken broth to every serving. I also used Thyme instead of marjoram as i didn't have that in the cupboard. I will definately use this recipe everytime I have a ham bone.

the reason you pre-soak the peas and i keep changing the water ,, is the less gas you have, and that always better... this soup is great ,, ive been  making this for years and always use stock (chicken)instead   of water,,, awesome

Very nice soup. One thing I changed in the recipe was the ham bone. I boiled the bone by itself for 1 1/2 hours before adding the rest of the ingredients. It added alot of flavour. Next time I make this I will omit the potatoes and add 1 clove of garlic. Makes LOTS of soup, will probably scale to 1/2 next time.

Outstanding! After reading a few reviews I tossed the following into a crock pot: 1 1-lb bag split peas, 2 quarts chicken stock, 1 ham bone, 2 cups cubed ham, 2 cups carrots, 1 diced potato, 1 diced onion, 2 cloves chopped garlic, 1/2 t salt, 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/2 t cumin, 1/4 t paprika, 1/4 t pepper, 2 bay leaves and a pinch marjoram. Cooked on high for 8 hours. Removed ham bone and bay leaves, and cook uncovered for last hour on low. So good! Update 3/13/11 I made this today on the stove instead of a crock pot...crock pot is the way to go. It takes longer, but it's worth it.

This is the best split pea soup recipe!  I've made it three times, and am making it again right now with the ham bone left over from Easter dinner.  I don't soak the peas overnight (like my mom used to do), and it still turns out perfect every time.  I also will substitute some of the water with chicken broth to give it a little more flavor.  The soup freezes really well, too.

Delicious! and I hate peas.  I followed exactly as written, but I like a little more salt & pepper. I had to thin it out a bit the next day with some milk.  It has been mentioned before, but the split peas = a 1 pound bag and I don't think the pre-soak is necessary. Updated, I just made this again using chicken stock pre-frying the onion and not soaking the peas, fantastic!!!

This is a terrific "basic" pea soup recipe. Here are some modifications you might want to try to get "beyond basic" to "golden."  1. Use a honeybaked hambone for a delicate, slightly sweet flavor and plenty of meat. 2. Simmer the hambone with a cup of chopped onions, 3 bay leaves, 1.5 tsp basil, the marjoram, double the black pepper, 1/2 tsp thyme and 1/4 tsp oregano in a mixture of water and chicken stock for only 20 minutes. Then take hambone out and let it cool... remove meat and replace hambone in still simmering pot. (The meat will become tasteless if you cook it too long so just remove the fat then chop and reserve.) 3. Brown (there should be crispy browned edges to the veggies) a mire poix mix in a tiny bit of butter then stir in 2 Tbsp broth and 2 tsp crushed garlic at the end just for a minute.  4. Add the mire poix, split peas, and a cup of sliced carrots to pot. I use yellow split peas because they look more attractive, "golden." Simmer until the peas begin to change (about 20-30 min.)  5. Remove hambone and add 1 large baked potato diced small. Simmer, stirring often (likes to stick and burn at this point) until potatoes are cooked through and soup is thickened (about 12 min, just add a little more stock or water if it is too thick.) 4. Stir ham back in one minute before serving and remove bay leaves.

Tasted great in the end but...   I followed this recipe literally instead of following my gut. Normally I would make the stock separate and skim off the impurities. I didn't and it foamed up and I lost alot of the onions when I skimmed. Also normally I would sautee the veg before adding stock.  I added garlic and cayenne pepper to kick it up a notch. Also, add more water or stock. This recipe makes it way too thick.

My husband would never touch split pea soup, but I forced him to try this recipe and now he requests it.  The kids lick the bowl.  Outside the family, people still make a face when you mention split pea soup, but everyone who tries this recipe is a convert.
A note about soaking: soaking split peas may reduce cooking time, but the person who says to soak and throw away the water because of gas is confusing beans and peas.  I would never use the water I soaked beans in, there will be a terrible punishment for anyone who thinks to cut that corner, but peas are not gassy and do not require soaking (although sometimes soaking may improve the smoothness of the final soup).
This is a VERY flexible, forgiving recipe that has always turned out great for me, soaking or no.

A good basic recipe that you can personalize to suit your tastes. I used low fat, low salt chicken broth in lieu of the water, which is what you can use to thin the soup without loss of flavor (for the reviewer who asked). I skipped the ham bone. I removed the casings from a large package of sausage which I browned and drained and then added to the soup. My additional seasonings included garlic and onion powders, parsley flakes, a little oregano and a bay leaf. Pea soup doesn't taste any better than after a couple of hours of trick or treating here in N.J. Add some home made croutons and your set to go!

MMMM just like my Mom makes.  I make it every time I have a hame bone, for myself & my hubbys Grandpop (we both just love it).  I sometimes sub broken up angel hair pasta for the potato for a little change.   Thanks Sandra!

I've been making this recipe for about 50 years. No need to soak split peas. They aren't like dried beans that have to be soaked. Usually, my peas are well cooked within 20 to 30 minutes. If you want them really soupy, more of a pureed look, cook longer. We like our soup with some mushed up and some still with their shape, thus the shorter cook time.
Serve with a salad, if you want a bit more than a bowl of soup, and with a good rustic bread or corn bread.

I would give it 6 stars if I could, and I never even give anything 5. I added a little minced garlic, and I always use stock instead of water to make soup. I used 8 cups of stock and this came out perfectly. Mine isn't too thick at all. It's so good I cant stop eating it. Going back for another bowl!

Seriously, I thought "this must be umami" when I took a bite. I'm not sure if that is correct, but boy was this some good soup!   I used a ham hock instead of the ham bone and added diced ham from a "ham steak", extra carrot, and skipped the potato.  This is why I had to give up being a vegetarian, there's just nothing like that rich, smoky, deep flavor that comes from the hock.  My Southern roots were so proud!  I froze part of this soup for later, but I don't think it will last that long...

This was very good.  I'm not a huge fan of peas, but the split peas pretty much dissolved into the soup to make it thick and creamy.  I threw everything in the crock pot and cooked on low for 10 hours.  I did not bother to pre-cook the peas, either.  I took the advice of other reviewers and replaced the water with chicken stock.  Between that and the ham bone, no additional salt was needed.

This was delicious! I used leftover spiral cut ham (honey glazed) instead of plain ham bone. It gave the soup a wonderful sweet =) I also added thyme and oregano instead of marjoram. My steps: boil peas in chicken broth for 5 minutes and sit for 1 hour. Boil 1 hour with ham and onion (+salt and pepper and herbs). Boil 40 minutes with potatoes and carrots. Turned out perfect!

I will treasure this recipe!  It was just scrumptious.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it.  The flavor and the consistency were just perfect.

I only made minor changes to the original recipe.  I only put 1 onion in, increased the potatoes to 2, put a bit of extra water in (about 2 cups), 2 cloves of garlic, and I used about a pound of diced ham rather than the ham bone in the original recipe.  I was tempted to add chicken stock because I wasn't convinced that there would be enough flavor, but I'm so glad that I didn't.  The onion, ham, peas, and water simmering results in a delicious flavor.

Really, really good.  Thanks to the original poster for a great recipe.

Delicious!  And a very forgiving recipe--I've made this several different times, often having to substitute various ingredients to accommodate what I have on hand and it always turns out great!  My most common substitution is the meat portion...sometimes I use ham hocks, sometimes bacon, sometimes smoked turkey wings, etc.   My favorite way to make this is in the crock pot.  I put in all the veggies, meat and spices, then fill the remaining space with water (with or without chicken bullion) and/or chicken broth.  If I'm home, I'll cook on high for 1-2 hours, then turn down to low for 6-8 hours.  If I'm leaving, I'll just turn it on low and go.  Either way, it always turns out great and has people going back for seconds. :)

I have made this several times - can't believe that I never reviewed it until now. I make this in a slow cooker. It's wonderful to come home to especially on a chilly day. I added some chicken flavored, low sodium "Better Than Bouillon" today because my ham was not very flavorful. I also had one ear of leftover corn on the cob so I cut the kernels off and added them, It added a subtle sweet note that was good. Nice and rich and filling. A meal in a bowl.

This comes out better each time I make it! I simmer my ham bone with a good amount of meat left on from the holidays along with a chicken bullion cube, crushed fresh garlic, onions, carrots, italian spice, garlic, a few bay leaves and pepper. After a few hours I take the bone out, remove meat, chop off and put aside. I add my split peas and after 45 minutes when they're cooked I add the ham back and add a can of new potatoes chopped. Came out perfect and so delicious!

Great use for leftover ham!! This is a very good Split Pea recipe.  I made it in a crock pot and added everything (including unsoaked peas) at 11 am and it was ready by 6 pm.  I also substituted 1 qt Vegetable Broth for 1/2 the water and added 4 Bay Leaves in addition to the Marjoram.   I used a ham bone that I had frozen from the last time we had made a whole ham and is very economical since it really allows you to use the whole piece of meat.

The recipe has a great taste, but you have to cook it for much longer than stated.  I also think the vegetables should be diced and not chopped.  They would cook quicker.  In the end, I had a nice puree soup, but it cooked for about an hour longer. I also used a ham steak, which was fantastic in the soup.

This is a great soup and gets better as is sits longer.  I made a few changes like some of the other reviewers suggested.  I sauteed the onion in EVOO then added hamhocks.  Add one low sodium beef broth bouillion cube, a couple of bays leaves and 4 cups water and let that cook for 1 hr.  I added the peas, 2 c chicken broth and cooked for another hour.  Then added the vegetables.

Used 2 cups split peas, 1 can chicken broth (the rest water), the rest as listed, but added a dash marjoram and 2 bay leaves.  Delicious!

The recipe as-is turns out much to thick. Added extra water during the cooking process, and still had to thin it out with broth for reheats. Left out the potato (glad I did - too thick for potato!) and added some more seasonings. Only used 2 cups split peas and did the quick soak. Boiled the ham bone on it's own for an hour and a half on it's own as suggested by other reviewers - Flavor was REALLY delicious!

This was tasty and so easy.  I had ham broth and cut up ham that I had cooked down and froze from a previous use.  I used the ham broth in place of water and added the minced ham.  Great way to use the leftover ham when you don't want to use it right away!

Excellent recipe, made for a very flavorful soup - perfect for a chilly November evening.  I used 2 cups of peas per other suggestions, substituted smoked pork hocks for the ham bone, used thyme in place of marjoram, added two cloves of garlic and a couple of bay leaves.  Next time I'll cut back on the celery - two stalks would be plenty.

This was my first time making split pea.  I used the ham bone from our Easter dinner.  This was outstanding and very easy to do.  As suggested, I used two quarts of chicken broth rather than water overnight.  I doubled the carrots and potatoes simply to add more so I can freeze.  I added more pepper as well.  True test came when my 7 year old son said it was awesome.  As with most children, he said it looked disgusting, but our rule is to always try something and he LOVED it.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!

This was a great basic soup recipe.  I did use 2 cans of chicken broth and the other half water as someone suggested.  I simmered the peas and the ham bone most of the day, added some 1/2 and 1/2 near the end of the cooking time.  I also thought it needed a little something so I put in about 3/4 tsp of crushed red pepper and 2 tsp of salt.  Brought it to a potluck and got tons of compliments!
Thanks Sandra!

My husband had been asking me to make split pea soup like he used to have when he was a kid.  I tried this recipe and it was IT!!  He LOVED it and couldn't get enough of it.  I had never had split pea soup in my life, but I loved it as well.  Thick, nurturing, wonderful comfort food!!

Marjoram is key in split pea soup, as well as, some smoked bacon. Diced the bacon, fry it up and add into your soup! YUM!

I only gave 4 stars because I made a few changes, but this recipe really deserves 5 stars for being a fantastic starting point!  I used 1 can beef broth and enough water to make 2 quarts- poured it all into my crock pot.  My bag of split peas came to 2-1/2 cups so that went in- no rinsing or or soaking needed.  I then added 1 chopped onion, a handful of celery sticks, handful of baby carrots, dash of thyme and dash of marjoram and a few sprinkles of bay leaves (no potato). Salt and pepper to taste.  Lastly, I threw in the Ham Bone with some meat attached from our Christmas Spiral Ham- I didn't weight it but it was decent sized. :)  Cooked on Low overnight (approx 9-10 hours) and in the morning it was finished!  I pulled out the ham and bones, used my immersion blender on the soup right in the crockpot and then added back in the meaty bits of ham....  FABULOUS, so easy and got rave reviews from the in-laws! Thank You!

This soup is very good, easy, and inexpensive. I did make 2 small changes though, I used a bay leaf in place of the marjoram, and that was because I've never had marjoram before and wasn't sure if i would like it. I couldn't even find it at the store.  Also, I used about half of a precooked Black Label ham, just cubed up in place of the ham bone. We enjoyed this soup with crushed saltine crackers over the top.  Will definately make this again for my family!

I didn't put in the carrots or potatoes to cut down on carbs, and I added some lean cubed bacon. It was still good, although I might add a little more water next time because it got very thick. I took out the meat and used an immersion blender before I served it to give it a smooth, even texture, and then cut up and returned to meat to the soup. Even my sometimes picky teenaged son liked this, and my very picky husband thought it was OK, too.

This recipe was very quick and easy.  I used this recipe with the one on the bag of peas and it was excellent.  You don't even need to soak the peas at all.  Just throw everything into the pot and cook.

First time ever cooking with a ham bone and attempting pea soup. It is delicious! I used chicken stock instead of water, only 1 onion and added a touch to thyme, but everything else just as is. Not disapointed at all, puts Campbells to shame!!

Made this today (first time ever making split pea soup) and it turned out excellent. I made 15 servings so I can freeze some. The only thing I did different is add an extra potato, a bay leaf, and some thyme. I used Knorr chicken stock. The flavor of the soup is absolutely amazing. I will definitely be making it again.

Be careful- this soup can easily get too salty, especially if you heed the advice to boil the bone in broth beforehand. I'd boil the bone in plain water then add bullion or condensed stock to taste.

This was pretty good, a little bland. I added more salt and pepper, and some garlic salt. I also added extra ham. Some reviews said it called for too many carrots, but I disagree. I will follow others advice for next time and use chicken stock instead of water, I think that will make a world of difference in the flavor.

instead of adding water, we add chicken stock (or the appropriate amount of bouillon cubes), and that little change makes this the most fantastic soup EVER!

I used 3 thin-cut smoked pork chops to cut down on the salt. I added 1/2 tsp. of smoke flavoring.   I carmelized the onions before adding them to give the flavor a boost.  I didn't have marjoram so I used thyme.  I didn't have a potato, celery or carrots, but the flavor was excellent without them.   This is a good basic recipe that you can tinker with and not spoil.

Love this basic recipe. Added half chicken broth in place of water, 1 onion only, extra salt probably not necessary. I did soak the peas and drained that water before adding to the ham bone.

Awesome recipe!!! After I soaked the peas using the faster method, I replaced the water with low salt chicken broth, some thyme and 2 bay leaves. I did not use potatoes, but added 1/2 large, yellow onion (instead of adding onion in beginning), 1 1/2C carrots, 1 1/2C celery, all diced. Didn't have a ham bone, instead I used leftover 1/4 ham from Xmas, which I tossed into the finished soup. My 9 yr. old girl had 3rds! This is one to stay, thank you!!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I used a bone I bought from Honey-Baked Ham. Yes, they do sell bones AND they have a ton of meat on them... so very worth the $5 or so they charge. I simmered the bone for about two hours and then added a 2 lb. bag of split peas since I didn't want to have 1/2 cup of extra peas laying around. I used mostly water for this, but added chicken STOCK when needed. I also didn't blend with my stick blender as I usually do since I wanted the chunks of ham in it. I added double the pepper and NO salt since the ham was salty enough. Trust me, I love salt and it would have been bad if I added any. My advice would be to not add any until the end and taste first. Another tidbit is that hot things don't always taste salty until after they've cooled a bit so careful there. I didn't add any carrots, celery or potatoes only because I didn't have any on hand and didn't want to make the 30 minute trip to the market. The marjoram was a key ingredient.

I used chicken stock to cook my soup and also instead of a bone ( I didnt have one) I used chopped ham and alder smoked old style bacon to cook it in the whole time. I also added a dash of cloves with the majoram and garlic. It was amazing!

Wonderful!  I replaced the water with Swanson's chicken broth... it made al the difference, and doubled the carrots and celery and replace the dried marjoram with 3/4 tsp. fresh thyme.

This is a keeper. I put it in the crock pot on low all day. The ham bone fell apart so all I had to do was scoop out the large pieces. The soup was creamy-no need to process in blender-  and saw no visible fat. Try it!

Great soup. Whenever I cook a ham, we freeze the bone to save for another day to make pea soup.

easy and yummers - I love the carrots celery and potato added in. I didn't soak the peas, just rinsed them and cooked them - they cook so quickly they really don't need the soak.

This is the best split pea soup i have ever made! I did substitue a couple things. Since I had a couple cans of chicken broth in the house, I used those & decreased the water by the same amount (approx. 28 oz). And since it is just me & my husband, I didn't want to buy a ham with a bone, so I bought a large slice of ham & cut it into small pieces and added it instead of the bone. Great recipe which I will use many, many times!

This was the best pea soup I've ever made!  I did as someone else mentioned...I simmered the bone (w/carrots, celery and onion) for a couple hours.  I then strained everything and tossed - except the meat on the bone.  I then continued on with the recipe.  This is a keeper in my house!  Thanks Sandra for such a good soup!

Soup ended up extremely thick. We added water, but that made it lose flavor. Any tips on how to thin this soup but retain flavor welcome!

I added 1 tsp of salt even with the ham bone it lack a little salt, maybe the potatoes absorb it all.  Also I mashed the potatoes so it was creamier.

Can't stop eating this... I boiled the ham bone separate, removed the bone and cut up the meat, then dumped all the veggies, meat, and peas in the broth. Boiled until it was thick. I used more water to start with, and added a bay leaf and garlic. Didn't have the marjoram. I didn't soak the peas, the package said it wasn't necessary. I didn't add the salt, and it was plenty salty.

This is a keeper!  I thought my kids would eat this easier if it was made with beans instead of peas and they loved it.  I used a bag of the 15 bean soup mix.  I did drain the soaked beans and refill with fresh water though.  I played with the water a little because it thickened up like a paste and then I made it too watery and had to cook it down but the flavor was perfect at either consistency.  I made a huge pot of this and we happily ate it for three days!  Someone mentioned earlier that to cut down on gas you have to rinse your peas/beans.  It worked, and we didn't experience any bloating or gas and we ate a lot of this soup.  I will make this again soon!

This was a very good recipe.  i also used chicken base, The only thing I would do different next time is leave out the salt and salt to taste.  The ham and chicken base are already really salty.  I will also use baby carrots cut in half like some other suggestions next time.  Thanks!

Never thought I would find something that tastes like my grandpas homemade pea soup. This is it. Amazing! Some people don't seem to like how thick it is but that is what I love about it. In my opinion this is not supposed to be a thin soup.

I am holding back one star ONLY because there is no  
bay leaf included in the recipe.

I made the exact recipe and while it makes a nice thick tasty soup...it just wasnt pea soup to me in a purely a Proustian way.

Maybe the potato a regional thing. I found it muted the other flavors.

Delicious...just different.

This soup was great, it thickened at the end, just as I was worried it was too soupy.  I added a few chunks of garlic to cook w/peas and ham too that gave it added flavor.  I simmered the ham for at least an hour before adding peas and veggies.

My first time making soup -- kid you not.  This turned out great.  Took various suggestions.  Boiled the bone about 1-1/2 hours in the water, soaked the peas for the same amount of time, sauted the onions in garlic, took the ham off the bone and diced it.  I ended up with about a quart of stock, so I added organic chicken broth to make up the two quarts, used thyme in place of marjoram and added 2 red potatoes.   Simmered everything about about 2 hours.  Midway through cooking did a taste test and added about a 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder.    Yes, this made a lot of soup and it wasn't too thick -- it was just right.  Boiling the bone ahead of time and then adding back liquid before cooking I'm sure made this difference.    Going to pick up another ham tomorrow (still on sale), 10 lbs instead of 8 and we'll make more soup mid-next week and freeze it.  This time I'll also save more of the ham and dice it in the soup.    I haven't had a whole bowl yet, but my son did and he couldn't stop talking about how good it was.

This was so easy to make we loved it!!  I made a few changes based on taste...I used a ham steak because I didn't have a ham bone, and I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also did not add marjoram because I do not like it...added more pepper and some garlic instead.  Easy recipe that hubby and both tots enjoyed!!!

This is very good. I have made split pea soup for years and this is more flavorful than anything I made. I used left over ham and had only 3/4 pd. My husband liked it but would have liked more ham.  This is a keeper and next time I will serve with some crusty bread.

Excellent.  I followed the instructions however I cooked 1 cup of Barley and added it with the vegetables instead of the potatoes.    It turned out perfectly.  Thanks so much!

So yummy on a cold winter night! I didnt have any marjoram in the house so I omitted it completely.  I also used 3 red skin potatoes.  This was super easy & very tasty!  Im going to try using chicken broth next time as suggested by others.

This soup is excellent!  I did not follow the recipe exactly, but it looks like few reviewers do.  I put the ham bone in a slow cooker and added the water.  It did not cover the bone, so I added a quart of chicken broth.  I then added all of the other ingredients, plus some garlic powder and bay leaves.  I let it cook for four hours, then put it in the fridge overnight.  The next morning I strained off the fat, removed the ham from the bone, and let it simmer all day.  I had to remove the excess liquid, but it is really, really, good.  Thanks bluebayou!

Love this. I use ham hock rather than a pork bone, I boil it for an hour prior to starting with the peas and veggies. We also like it thick and if the soup is loose, just add some instant potato flakes to  thicken it up.

I had never made pea soup before, so I was a little skeptical. But, I was very pleasantly surprised. Just the right amount of veggies, and not too thick like some pea soups. I added about a cup and a half of cooked, diced ham instead of meat from the ham hock, because there didn't seem to be much meat on there. I really loved the addition of the potatoes as well, and it was quite flavorful even though I omitted the onions. Will definitely make this again!

This was a really nice soup.  You absolutely do not have to soak the peas, they get tender enough in the cooking process.  I made it vegetarian.  I also sauteed the celery, carrots, and onions in a Tb of butter first, and I omitted the potato.  Added 1T of minced garlic and 1/2 tsp. of paprika and bay leaf.  Very flavorful!  And thick! May need to add more water or stock.

Wow This soup made a LOT.
it was super delicious though (and really easy.) I substituted the potatoes with sweet potatoes and it was delicious. I will have some in my freezer forever.

ALSO make sure you have more chicken broth on hand to thin it out later, because the leftovers turned into mashed potato consistency.

Very good. The only thing I did different was use 1 quart ham water (water the ham bone was boiled in) and 1 quart chicken broth instead of just water and put in orzo pasta instead of the potato and also added 3 very healthy shakes of tabasco.

Let me start by saying I hate Pea Soup, that said this was the best soup I've had in a long time. Some reviewers complained about the thickness but I thought I was perfect. If you want a thinner soup leave out the potato as that adds considerably to the thickness. I also used 1/2 chicken stock, 1/2 water and added 1 tablespoon rosemary and 1 teaspoon of oregano. This was so go my finicky children ate it up...thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper.

YUM!!!  I added everything to my crockpot and cooked on high for 5 hours. I used 1 pint water and 1 pint chicken stock, an apple smoked ham steak, one potato, one onion and carrots.  I think the crockpot must keep it from getting too thick b/c I'm surprised that people had issues with the thickness.  I took out the ham and blended it all with a stick blender.  I will definitely make this again, as it was so easy!

This is a very nice, basic split pea soup.  I usually use smoked ham hocks if I don't have a ham bone, but I went to two stores and couldn't find any.  I used smoked ham neck bones instead, and I thought they made the soup very flavorful.

Very, very good soup! One of the reasons why I followed this recipe was because of the marjoram; I couldn't remember what little seasoning it was that I needed to add that gives it a special taste. I didn't add a potato; those got eaten up with another recipe, add it might add the thickening that some people want, though I just left the cover on the pot off and let evaporation get me the consistency that I like. Add rye bread and butter and you have got a great meal! Thanks again for the recipe!

This is the first and last recipe I will ever try.  It is fabulous.  And it makes plenty for freezing.  I added an extra potatoe and used three ham hocks.  It is wonderful and you will definitely not be disappointed.

This soup was great!  I used the dried split peas that didn't need to be soaked.  The ham bone gave the soup such a nice flavor plus I added extra ham to get rid of leftovers!  I didn't have majoram, but it didn't seem to make a difference.  I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder and extra potatoes.  A very hearty soup! Will definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a good basic/starter recipe for split pea soup but I made several changes to fit my taste.  I did not like the addition of the potato so I will leave that out next time.  I also added less onion and added 2 tsp garlic.  When it was does,  I used a wisk to stir and mash the peas a little bit.  Turned out great.

This was excellent! I took the suggestion to use 1/2 chicken stock to 1/2 water and increased the liquid a little as well.  Final consistency is perfect. :)

Due to time constraints, I simmered the peas, added the ham bone and let that simmer for a few hours, then put in the fridge until the next day.

I added the veggies the following morning, let that simmer another hour or so then served for lunch.  Delicious - the carrots were tender but not mushy.  

This is a keeper!

It's a good thing nobody else in my house likes split pea soup...means I get to have it all to myself! Finally got to use the ham bone in my freezer. I thought it was great, so easy, and with the high fiber content, great if you're on Weight Watchers (or watching, period). I increased it to two potatoes and used herbs de provence as I didn't have marjoram (HdP contains it) and I really liked the texture difference between the silky peas and chunks of carrot and potato (didn't use celery, didn't have it). My bag of peas said you didn't have to soak, so I didn't. Still came out beautifully smooth and creamy. Think it needs a bit more salt & pepper, though, but that's a personal preference. Thanks!

Very good. I couldn't find a ham bone at my grocery store so I used a ham steak and substituted beef broth for the water to make up for flavor loss. I also added some fresh thyme and deleted the potato (only because I didn't have one) This soup got rave reviews from family and friends. I will make it again.

I needed something to do with the leftover ham from Thanksgiving so I found this recipe and tried it out. My wife and kids whom had never had split pea soup loved it! We can't wait for the leftovers from Xmas to make this again.

I like the soup very much. I like the part
where you don't have to soak them over night.
It also goes a long ways , cause it is
nice and rich and thick.

Since split pea soup is one of my husbands favorite soups, decided to give this a try & came out awesome. Changed the ham hocks for 2 cups of diced Turkey Ham, since that was on hand and used Oregano instead of Marjoram.  

This is a keeper in my recipe book.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is wonderful, but I change quite a bit.  I use 1 can Chicken stock, 1 can light Chicken stock and 1 can veggie stock, then enough water to make 3 quarts.  I use 1 1/2 bags peas.  Add 1 bay leaf and 3 cloves garlic.  I up the celery to 4 stalks, carrots to 6.  1 1/2 onions  No need to soak the peas.

I've made a ton of recipes from this site over the past 10 years, and I have to say... this is one of my all time favorites! I have people begging me to make this soup, and my kids are crazy giddy when I tell them we're having pea soup for dinner. Who would've ever thought...

I made this soup this morning, following the recipe! I find it most annoying when people write a review but have not followed the recipe as it is!  This soup is excellent. It doesn't need any changes!!!!! I especially like the "boil peas for 2 minutes then soak for an hour method" as rarely do I plan the night before when making soup.

This was a pretty good split pea soup.  I didn't soak the peas because I forgot!  but it turned out just fine.  I used veggie stock instead of plain water, ony 1 onion, and 3 potatoes.

I followed the quick prep version of this recipe.  After the 2 minute simmer and 1 hour soak.  I added the ham bone and onion, brought to a boil and then reduced to simmer for the 1-1/2 hr as directed.  

I removed the ham bone.  Then I used an immersion blender to create a creamy, smooth soup.  To that I added the carrots, potato, and celery and cooked for another 40 minutes.

The result was the creamiest, tastiest split pea and ham soup I have ever had.

This is a great soup. I prefer to use chicken stock instead of water to pump up the flavor. When I served this to my daughter recently she thought it was too thick (I had simmered it quite a long time). I added heavy cream and she totally loved it. I did too. could hardly stay away from it even though I was aware of the calories!

First time I ever made Split Pea Soup, and it came out great!!!! I took the advise of most of the reviews and added things that I like. I used 2 cans of Chicken broth and 3 cans of vegetable broth (that's what I had left in my cupboard) and added a wooden spoonful of minced garlic, celery,s&p, bay leaf, baby carrots cut in half, left out the potato......I will do this every time I make a Spiral Ham!!!!! Absolutely delicious!!!!!

I did this in my crock pot. I left out the celery and carrots. Added thyme and more marjoram. After six hours of cooking I pureed more then half of the soup in my blender. Put back in crock pot then added some chopped up ham and cooked for three more hours. Turned out really good.

I doubled this since I had a 2 lb bag of split peas, omitted salt and marjoram. Added a bay leaf, garlic and 1 tbsp of Better than Boullion Vegetable base. Really tasty, served with pretzel buns.

This is a wonderful recipe!. I sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil and added the carrots and celery in for a bit. I added them into the soup and it added a wonderful flavor! I used 2 bay leafs, majoram and thyme to taste. I did not add salt as the ham was salty.  I also boiled the ham bone in chicken broth for about 1.5 hours and removed and chopped. It was delicious soup!

This is really good. I don't always have a ham bone handy but I usually have some large pieces of ham in the freezer left over from a holiday meal. That works just as well as the ham bone.

I couldn't get enough.  I loved it chunky.  I didn't presoak my peas, just dumped everything in at the same time.  At the end, I used a potato masher on the peas to be creamier, but still leave most of the chunks of veggies.

I added onions, lots more carrots, and at least tripled the amount of black pepper and marjoram while omitting the potatoes. This was my first time making split pea soup, and it was the best! Definitely a favorite!

I really liked this recipe.  I however did not have celery to put in the soup, so I used celery seed, which tasted fine.  The soup still didn't have enough creaminess and flavor for my family so I added a half stick of butter and two teaspoons of chicken bouillon while it was lightly bubbling.  This made such a huge difference in the taste.  If you try this, do enjoy!

Delicious! My entire family loved this...even my supremely picky 5 year old. She has been asking if we can have it again. The only think I did different was omitting the potatoes. I threw everything right into the crock pot and let it cook all day. Definitely recommend!

Very good recipe.  Didn't have the ham bone anymore so I just shopped up the extra ham.  Also didn't add a potato (hubby doesn't like them in soup).  Will make again hopefully with the actual ham bone.

I like the recipe, but I prefer to cook the ham bone first. Then, after soaking the peas, I add some of the meat in the pot, reserving some for later for added flavor. I also saute the veggies before adding into pot, ensuring they're not crunchy or so my peas don't get too mushy for me.

Delicious!  I made a few mistakes due to flying through the recipe too quickly; I didn't measure out the water but instead just eye-balled it so the peas were covered a few inches.  I also accidently put the carrots and celery in at the beginning so they cooked the entire time.  The celery and onion were all cooked down but there were still visible bits of carrot.  Lastly, I added a few bay leaves in lieu of the marjoram.  BTW 2 1/4 c dried peas = 16 oz bag.

Very good, especially after adding a couple of bay leaves and a sprinkle of Montreal Grill Seasoning.

A good basic split pea soup, but I prefer more flavor. Used these crockpot directions with my own seasonings for a better outcome.

this really didn't work for me. I think the soup and I both really wanted it to work but the peas never quite broke down and after a while, I gave up and used the blender which helped some. It could be the peas were too old and since everyone else seems to have managed to make a decent soup out of this, I'm willing to try again another time.

Unsoaked peas take from 1 to 2 hours of simmering; soaked peas take about 40 minutes. Mine took about 1 hour 45 mins for the peas to be tender. I did not like the marjoram or potatoes in this soup. I also had to add 4 cups of water due to the extra cooking time.

Delicious! I used reduced sodium chicken broth instead of water which added nice depth of flavor. My soup was fairly thin, next time I'll either reduce the broth by 1 cup or increase the dried peas by 1/4 to thicken it up.

Lovely delicious soup for a cold day. The only changes I made were to leave out the marjoram (didn't have) and to substitute smoked turkey wings for the ham bone. It was wonderful!

We added an extra amount of liquid in the form of a beer and I used chopped ham instead of a bone. This resulted in a very nice flavored soup that was far too thin. The amount of fluid stated in the recipe was right. Still yummy though, thank you.

Im not a fan of split pea but this was very good.  I added to much liquid and was runny the first day but the next day thickened up great.  I also added more chopped ham steaks at the end.

This is a fantastic, easy recipe. I had guests for dinner, and everyone warily took half a bowl to start, but then took huge bowls for seconds--even my kids loved it! After soaking, I drained the peas and added back fresh water with 6 cubes low-sodium chicken buillion (I held back about 2 c. of the 2 quarts water the second time and never ended up needing it, probably since the peas had already absorbed some). I didn't add the salt, because of the salty ham bone, or the marjoram, because I didn't have any. I HIGHLY recommend!

Delicious recipe.  I didn't soak the peas overnight and it was just fine.  Also, I used a ham steak, omitted the salt, and added a couple of bay leaves.

This was a great base recipe! I have always been told that split peas do not need to be soaked, so I didn't do that part. And I had about 2 cups of leftover Easter ham so i didn't use the ham bone (but next time I definitely well because it adds so much more the to flavor). For the liquid, I used half water and half chicken broth which I think is a must. Towards the end, I added an extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth b/c I could tell the soup was going to be too thick. I also didn't have any marjoram so I added a tsp of thyme. I think next time I will add  half of the dry split peas into the soup a little later because they had completely disintegrated into a pea broth by the time the potatoes, carrots and celery were at a soup tenderness. But all in all the flavor was great and this pea soup was a huge hit!

Absolutely wonderful!  There was only a few things I altered slightly - I had no marjoram so I omitted it and used more water than called for (about twice as much) as I hate pastey pea soup and it kept simmering down to a thick paste.  I added a bunch of ham along with the bone, only one one large onion and a HUGE potato.  It was fabulous!  Took a while but sooo worth it!  This one goes in the recipe box!

Update:
I tried it with marjoram the second time - it was wonderful!  I had four ham bones that I simmered all day in water and made stock with.  I used the stock and ham (after letting it sit overnight and skimming off the fat and impurities and pulling out the bones) for the soup - it added an extra dimension of flavor that was to die for!

OMG was this Good!!!  I did basically did the same recipe except I didn't add the potato (only thing I could see potato would do for this soup was add calories - don't need them).  Also added a pinch of thyme and did 1/2 water & 1/2 chicken broth.  I soaked the split peas in water for a couple of hours, then put all in a crock pot and let it go overnight.  YUMMMMM!!!!!

Great Blueprint!! I just used up my x-mas ham I had leftover for this soup. I followed the directions to a tee except I changed the yield to 20 People, I like to store xtras in the freezer. I didnt have any celery or carrots so I diced up an extra potato and onion. I also added 3 tsp. of chicken bullion, and a tsp or 2 of squeezable oregano, and 4 tblspns of orange sauce drippings from the ham. Well I let my stew simmer, I prepared my ham meat for my soup, It was a spiral ham, and i still had a few slices left, so I used that, and anything else that looked good in the bowl, I just diced it all up. I threw a pan on the stove and set the temp to med/ high, I poured the rest of the orange sauce drippings from the ham into the pan and let it boil down then I threw in the diced up ham and let it cook and reduce it was almost like bacon but more tender. I tasted the soup all the way along until I felt it was rite and then at the end I took out the bone and any other scrap meat and kept it aside for the doggies. I added my pan full of diced ham reduced in orange glaze, the glaze was all asorbed in the meat and pan was dry and sticky. The soup turned out exceptional I ate it with some ritz crackers it was the best soup I have ever made, it blows my thanksgiving turkey dumpling away. Great Blueprint again and just follow directions taste test along the way and it will turn out to be one of your classics too. Thanks for the recipe.

This was amazing!  The whole family loved it and it was super filling!  I used a ham hock instead of a ham bone.  I also browned the onions first and substituted half of the water for chicken stock.  I will be making this again very soon!

Good basic split pea recipe but be aware it DOES NOT TAKE 1 1/2 hours to cook the peas.  Mine were done in 45 minutes (if you don't want them liquified).  I wound up adding extra peas just to have some texture of them in my soup afer I had cooked them the stated 1 1/2 hours.

My family loves this soup! It was so delicious. I cooked the ham bone all morning and scooped the marrow out. I blended about half of the finished product and stirred it all together (reserving a small portion for my 10 month baby- who LOVED it!) for a nice consistency.

super delicious.  i used 24 oz of low sodium chicken broth in place of 24 ounces of the water.  i simmered the bone and onions for one hour, added the veggies and split peas and simmered another 35 minutes.  perfect!

YUM!  This will be my main split Pea Soup recipe from now on, it was delicious! I used a large meaty ham hock, boiled it in 2quarts of water with 2 bay leaves for about an hour then added 1 diced onion and boiled about 30 more minutes. I soaked the peas in water while the hock boiled and rinsed until water was very clear. Added the peas, 3 diced carrots, 2 diced potatoes and 3 diced celery stalks along with another bay leaf, some thyme, cracked black pepper, fresh rosemary, 1 crushed chicken bullion cube and some parsley. Then simmered it all for about another hour. Stirred in about 1/4 c heavy cream just before serving. Let me tell you It was so good! Made a great New Year's Day dish with hot homemade rolls and brownies for dessert :)

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, minus the celery. Everyone liked it, but I had never had pea soup and I wasn't wild about it. Since then I have tweaked it and now I love it, along with everyone else in the house. I don't soak the peas overnight, and I don't think it matters either way. I use beef stock instead of water and omit the salt. I have never used the celery. I add LOTS of garlic powder. The most important change is that I dice up a lean ham steak instead of using a ham bone. It adds some nice, lean ham to the soup without the hassle or fat from a ham bone. Having made it with the ham bone and without, I don't think it makes a big difference. I have to say I get raves about this and my young daughter absolutely loves this. I usually make a double batch because we love it so much.

Cut the recipe in half, just right for 4 hearty servings. Used a Honeybaked Ham bone. Boiled it before adding that stock to the sauteed veggies and ham. A quiet settled over the table as we began to eat, followed by a chorus of "whoa"...that usually is a pretty good sign :)

I love this recipe! I filled the pot chicken stock poured in the peas then put in 4 smoked ham hock's. I let it cook for an hour then turned off the burner and took the ham hocks out let them cool and picked the meat off of them, put the ham and the veggies in the soup and sweet potato's chopped in small squares. I let it cook until all the veggies were very tender. It was a great!! A soup that everyone loved!

Delicious! I doubled the recipe (makes a LOT of soup) and used one packet each of split peas and beans, and used cubed black forest ham. Before adding the onion, I sauteed it along with the garlic. After cooking, I used an immersion blender to blend the soup until almost smooth, with a few bite-sized chunks of goodness in between. The soup was hearty and filling.

Yummy. I didn't have any celery but I added a bit of water, chicken soup base and a few odd spices and this was really good. Even my sister who doesn't like pea soup liked it.

I am not a big pea guy. I will not eat peas no matter how they are cooked. I love this receipe. I have made it 4-6 times and I get rave reviews. Anyone who does not think this receipe is a winner must of not followed the receipe. I did however use chicken broth the 3rd time I made it and I think it does taste better.A REAL GOOD RECEIPE, Thanks.

I used half water half chicken broth as many reviewers suggested. I also used smoked ham hocks rather than a ham bone. No potatoes, and omitted salt since I had used broth. Consistency was good, and so was the taste.

We really enjoyed this soup!  I made it with a ham slice that I had and diced up, and to add some extra flavor I added ham soup base to the water.  It's creamy and delicious especially on this very snowy night in the Midwest!  Thanks!

I used this recipe as a base, but made a few changes along the way.  I used chicken broth for the water and used the 2 minute method to soak the peas.  I then put all the vegetables in, as well as cubed ham, and used thyme of the recommended spice.  It wasn't very thick at first, but thickened as it cooled.  Was great the next day, too.  Try this soup.  It is great!

Perfect split pea soup!  What a great comfort food.  I used more carrots and celery, and needed to simmer it longer to thicken it up - I also used 2-3 times the amounts of salt and pepper.  SO good, thank you!

Very good soup! Add this to your list of comfort foods during cold weather. The split peas I use do not require soaking. Check your label, it may save you a few steps and time.

Thank you Sandra. This tasted just like I remember from my childhood. Only thing is I put a little more potato in it and you suggested. But otherwise it was the same. My dad was thrilled with it. My husband even ate it and would never even try pea soup before. In fact he ate it every day for 4 days. Thanks again.

This is awesome!!  I had to add another 1/2 cup of peas though when it was close to being done, seemed very liquidy.  I simmered the ham bone and peas in about 5 cups of chicken broth (light), and the rest water.  Didn't use any salt, but lots of pepper.  After I added the extra peas, I cooked the onions in a fry pan (without anything added), poured some soup in the pan to loosen up the extra's from the pan, and added it back to the soup pot.  I am about to add the chpd carrots, and then take it off the heat.  I also don't have any potatoes, so I didn't add it.  My house smells amazing, and it tastes as good as it smells!!

Very good, easy to prepare. I added minced garlic and used dehydrated onions and basil (I was out of onions and marjoram). Leftover soup became VERY thick, so I thinned it out with either milk or chicken broth. Will definitely make this again.

I made this soup for sixty people and it was well received. I used half low salt chicken broth and half water. Because I made so much, I bought a 13 pound piece of ham and had it cut in half. I used 2 16 quart stockpots and put a piece in each one. It was nice and meaty and very satisfying.

Very good taste and texture. I added a few more herbs but that's strictly a matter of personal taste.  Although the cooking takes a long time, the preparation is actually quite simple (chop vegetables, throw them in a pot!).

I really like the flavor but it needs more salt, I added three chicken bouillon cubes and that helped. Super easy and fun to make!

Excellent recipe! I made this with the leftover ham bone from our Christmas honey-baked ham. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used 1 qt chicken stock and 1 qt water for the broth and it was restaurant quality delicious. I also threw in a bay leaf bc I had one and figured it couldn't hurt. This soup is perfect and hearty enough to eat as a meal with warm crusty bread. Thanks for a great recipe.

This pea soup is by far THE BEST we have ever had. Although I tweaked it a bit.  I used a 1 lb bag of peas with 2 quarts of water, which did make it a bit thick, but we like it that way. 
Also I used our left over spiral ham that was glazed with brown sugar and honey which added a nice flavor to the soup. 
I put in maybe 2 cloves of garlic since we love garlic. That might be a bit much to someone else, but I definitely recommend adding garlic.
I found that it takes more time to cook than what the recipe says. But the cooking time depends on how well done you like the peas to be. But I can't specify the amount of time I didn't really time it, I just kept it on the stove until they were cooked to my liking.
Delicious soup.. I am making it again today!

This was just okay for us. I wasn't a fan of the carrots in the soup. I think the carrots made it the unappealing color. I have a pea soup recipe I have made for years that doesn't have carrots and the color is much nicer.

A big hit, even with people who hate peas!  There wasn't any need to soak the beans. I added extra ham, love the chunks.

This is a great recipe! 
I cooked the ham in a oven bag, in a crock pot. We used a can of cherry coke and pineapple slices, some of the pineapple juice, brown sugar, and clove spears. 
In the soup I added pepper, bay leaf and some of the juice from cooking the ham, and the vegetables in the recipe. Wow, what a treat!

I made this soup in a crock pot and cooked it on high for 4.5 hours. I did not change a thing in the recipe except my husband and I added hot sauce to our soup bowls.  It was delicious and I'll be making it again and again....Thank you for sharing the recipe.

What to do with all that Christmas ham?  Take that ham bone and simmer it in half water, half chicken broth for an hour or so before adding the other ingredients.  I added some garlic, thyme and bay leaves, per other users suggestions.  This makes up a really great soup.

I, too, do not soak the peas overnight, but I usually start with hot water and cook it on High for the first 6 hours.  The thickness of this can vary quite a lot.  If it's getting near serving time and it seems too thin, I hit it with the immersion blender.  If that doesn't do the trick, I add instant mashed potato flakes--plain or flavored (like loaded mashed potatoes, four cheese, or whatever).  It thickens the mixture beautifully and doesn't hurt the flavor at all.  If anything, the flavored kinds are actually pretty tasty add-ons.  My father *loves* this recipe.  Every time I cook a ham, the leftovers are inevitably destined for the crock pot.

I really enjoyed this recipe, however I made a few prep changes that drastically decreased the prep time and I think didn't diminish the soup at all because we loved it!  I cooked the peas about 20 minutes until soft (no pre-soaking) with about a pound chunk of ham and the seasonings (I followed some other reviewers comments and added some thyme and garlic as well).  Then removed the ham and I add the chopped veggies and simmered until tender.  I used my immersion blender to semi chop everything in the pot, then added the chopped ham.  I ended up adding a bit of chicken broth to thin it as the veggies cooked as it was turning into paste and I was afraid it would burn.  I do like my soup thick though and this was amazing.  All said as I prepared it, it took less than an hour and tasted like it cooked all day.  Great recipe!   I'll make it again soon!

The ham hock bone was critical. I think mine was smoked...because it had such great flavor. I used my slow cooker and based it off home made chicken stock. Huge flavor, great taste. I cooked the peas on low for an hour or so and jacked it up to high for awhile. I tried not to overcook the veggies, not turning them into mush...like a disposable mirepoix.

My mother always loved pea soup, but I couldn't get over the fact that it looked gross. In my old age I finally decided to give it a try. Its really good. This is my first attempt at making it from scratch. It was very good. I have never made any type of soup without adding canned broth. I was very intimidated to try to make soup using a bone. We had ham for Easter and I decided to save the bone and give it a try. It turned out really well. I have never used dried peas or beans either. The package of peas said the peas didn't need to be soaked, only rinsed and drained, so that is what I did. I boiled the ham bone for about an hour in enough water to cover, took it out and cut off the meat. Added the meat back to the broth and added the rest of the ingredients and just let it simmer for another hour. Yummm. It was really good. My mom would be proud!!

Made this recipe yesterday with the recommendation to use chicken stock instead of water.  The family seemed to be fans and my husband and son went back for seconds.  Next time I might use a little less broth to get a thicker soup.  Overall a very good recipe.

I was concerned with the flavor issue addressed by others so I decided to be slick.  I soaked my peas overnight in 1 qt. of Aldi's Fit & Active chicken broth and 1 qt. of the broth from boiling 3/4 lb. of smoked turkey wings.  I then sauteed 1 diced onion in 2 tablespoons of EVOO in my dutch oven and added the peas, broth and smoked turkey wings.  I brought it to a boil then a simmer and added the other diced onion and a couple of cloves of fresh minced garlic.  I then added a diced red potato, the carrots and celery, the marjoram, and I also added a pinch of oregano and thyme (I didn't add salt or pepper).  Everything was cooking wonderfully but was very runny.  Then it dawned on me.  The peas soaked up the liquid and I had added more liquid to bring the total to 2 qt.  I ended up adding an additional 2 cups of peas to get the right consistency (the reason being, as others have commented, peas are not like beans, they absorb liquid and soften quickly).  When it finally got there, folks, it was one of the best things I've ever made in my life.  Absolutely delicious.  My dad and I used to go out for split pea soup at a local restaurant every Tuesday night after work before he passed away.  This great recipe brought back those memories.  Thanks for sharing it, bluebayou.

This was SO tasty...just perfect!!!  My new favorite Split Pea Soup recipe.  I was a tad more generous with the marjoram, about an 1/8-1/4 t.  I'm thinking that is what "makes" this recipe.  I didn't add the potato because the consistency was perfect without it.  GREAT recipe, thank you for sharing!

Man, this was good! I added about an extra cup of chicken broth as I don't like my pea soup as thick as others do. I also seasoned with some garlic and onion powder and a bay leaf.

I thought this was a great starter recipe as well!  I cooked a few slices of chopped bacon and sauteed the onion with the bacon before adding to the soup.  I also use thyme instead of the marjoram (I didn't have any) and threw in a few bay leaves.  Excellent soup will make again!

I really liked the taste of this made with chicken soup base instead of just water which is how I have made pea soup for the last 20 plus years. I mixed in a few tablespoons of Organic Better Than Bouillon reduced sodium chicken base into aprx.9 cups of water and added my ham bone that had some meat attached along with a few small bay leaves.I boiled and then simmered the bone for well over an hour.After rinsing the 2 1/2 cups of peas I used the quick soak method and drained them and added them to the broth and continued a low simmer. In a seperate pan I sauted the diced carrots,celery, onion and garlic in olive oil till just tender. I added this to my soup base with the bone removed and chopped up ham and added that. I din't have marjoram so I used oregeno, a dash of cumin and salt&pepper. It was less thick then how I usually make it but I resisted adding more peas and in the end after simmering for another 2 hours or so I am glad I did as it did thicken up after some of the broth reduced. It was really flavorful and had a perfect texture and thickness! My husband thought it was excellent and I will definately make my pea soup this way next time. I didn't add the potato which would have made it thicker and I may give that a try next time. I really like to have the Organic Chicken and Beef soup base on hand and if you shop at Costco or another warehouse type store it's not too pricey. I use it for all my soups to step up the flavor and for any recipe that uses broth.

I have never made split pea soup.  The smell is pretty strong for at least an hour, my 5 year old was holding her nose.  I soaked the peas overnight in 4 cups water & 4 cups chicken broth.  There was quite a bit of foaming when I began simmering...and thanks to a reviewer I knew to skim off the impurities.  I made the mistake of using ham cubes....no flavor and hardened up.   This was a bit too "green" for my taste.

This is a great base recipe. I always start here. I blogged about my favorite version, where I added chunks of smoked Gouda to the finished soup. Sooooo good!

This was pretty good - better than I was expecting.  It's a nice, hearty meal.  I didn't find that it was as thick as other people mentioned, but it had nice flavor.

This was my first time making pea soup! I rated it four out of five stars because I did have to make a lot of changes to get it to our liking. Hubby and I like lots of spice, though, and we kept having to add more: about another tsp of pepper, plus cumin, coriander, bay leaf powder, smoked paprika, onion & garlic powder, and a bouillon cube. The ham bone I got was smoked, and I think that overpowered it a little - next time I'll try to find a plain ol' bone; I'd bet next time this will totally be five stars! Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this recipe!!  I did the quicker "soaking" of the peas.  I took all of the good ham meat off of the bone before adding it to my chicken stalk and peas.  I saved the ham pieces until the very end of cooking when I added it to the soup, just to warm it up.  The first time I made pea soup, I had it in the whole time and it gets so dry!  I followed some reviewers suggestions by adding 2 cups of each celery, carrots, and potatoes.  I did not add marjoram because I don't have any so I added some thyme and lemon pepper instead.  After adding everything, I probably cooked it for 2 more hours because I like my pea soup very thick.  I serve it with fresh lemon to squeeze on top and lemon pepper.  So Yummy!

Well, as many reviewers have said, this is a great basic split pea soup recipe. But it doesn't result in the best pea soup I have ever had. I think the top helpful reviews helped develop the flavor and I wish I tried it with ham hocks (as suggested by one of the reviews) to see if the flavor improved. Don't get me wrong, this is good, but I am still on the hunt for a better version. Hence 4 stars.

Very, very good. I did feel it took quite a bit of time to do all the prep... and I wasn't sure exactly what a ham bone was after searching 3 local markets and leaving empty handed. I nice lady at the 4th store told me to use a ham hock and cook it with the water and seasonings for an hour while the peas soaked. Whew! Life saver! I would have had no idea. I don't typically like peas in anything, any shape or form but this was so yummy! Totally will be making again.

AMAZING!  Substituted chicken broth for the water, added a bay leaf and left out the potato (never had split pea soup with a potato in it before). Soooo good!

I followed most of the recipe, I added chicken stock for liquid, and left out the salt. 
I also did mine in a slow cooker and just added everything at one time and left it on while I was at work. It smelled amazing when I came home, and tasted even better.

Yummy Yum Yum..I even got my 'we don't like pea soup' family to eat this and they loved it.  I must say due to time constraints I used canned peas and put them in a food processor (2 cans) w/ 1/2 cup of half and half.  I fried some bacon and sauted the veggies (including some minced garlic) and chopped ham in the bacon grease. Instead of water I added 1.5 cups of  chicken broth and mixed all the ingredients together and let it simmer on low for about 30 minutes. I also added diced smoked sausage.  I served with  shredded mozarrella on top and crumbled bacon. We loved this.

Loved it with a few additions!  Added chopped garlic and a cube of beef broth while simmering.  Also sauteed 1/2 of my veggies in olive oil and then tossed them in. Even better the next day! This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing :)

DELICIOUS!!!!  Made a few minor changes: used chicken bouillion, added 2 bay leaves, added some garlic, and used 2 cups of diced turkey ham (to save time and calories).  This was a huge hit and will become a regular once the weather gets cooler!

The way I've tweaked this Betty Crocker similar/same recipe over the years:  add chicken bouillon to water or use chicken broth or stock instead of plain water.  

I omit potato and celery.  I add an add onion, parsley, garlic from a jar, 1/4 tsp thyme (if I have it), a bay leaf or two, and a generous pinch of cayenne pepper.

Really good recipe.  I doubled it and used 3 quarts chicken broth and 1 quart water, added a few bay leaves, and only used 1 1/2 onions.  I also soaked the peas overnight.  I know some said you don't have to but it came out really good this way.  My mother said it's the best she's ever had!

Great recipe.  I did make some changes as I didn't have time to go to the store, so I used what I had on hand.  I used turkey broth, and since I didn't have quite enough, even added some vegetable broth.  Didnn't have a ham bone, but did have a nice chunck of ham that I chopped up and used.  This came out just fine.  My husband just couldn't get enough!  =)

Oh wow, so good!!  Like others I added a couple cloves of minced garlic, 2 T. chicken bouillon, and also 1 quart of extra water to thin it out some, still a very hearty soup.  Pre-soaking the peas probably isn't necessary.  I also omitted the salt because of the added bouillon.  Used a leftover spiral cut, smoked, honey glazed ham bone.  Turned out so much better than my last attempt.  A wonderful comfort food, thanks!

With a few minor changes this recipe can be top notch.  Add a couple teaspoons of chicken boullion to pot, try smoked turkey wings instead of the ham bone. I also cut up smoked sausage or polska kielbasa, pan fry it first and add it to the pot when the soup is done. People who have tried my split pea for the first time always say its the best they ever had!

My first attempt at split pea soup and it turned out incredable!  I followed some other reviewers and used a ham hock.  I didn't measure out anything... I just kept adding as I saw fit...ended up using a 500g bag of split peas, 1/2 onion, 1 very large carrot, 2 celery stalks, 2 small potatoes, 2 garlic cloves, a little bit of dried thyme, a dash of garlic and roasted pepper seasoning, and salt a pepper to taste.  OH, and I used a veggie stalk to thin the soup as it cooked. Thank you for a great recipe guide :)

Like others I didn't have chicken broth so I threw some cubes in. For the most part I cooked this in my large slow cooker. This was amazing Really reminded me of home. Thank You for posting.

Very good base recipe, I am a vegitarian so I used vegatable broth as a base and added crumbled morningstar bacon for the "ham flavor". Very tasty!

Very good. I left out the potato and used chicken broth instead of water. I also did the whole thing in a pressure cooker, which only took about 20 minutes. I'll definitely hold onto this recipe. Soup had a great flavor with the celery and carrots.

Amazing Split Pea Soup!  Nothing better on a cold winter day.  Take the time to make it right and you will be rewarded.  I added some pan-seared slices of spicy chorizo sausage near the end - WOW!

I used the Honeybaked ham bone from Easter and it was wonderful!!  Everyone said that it was soooo good.  I just threw everything in the crock pot except the dried marjoram(didn't have any on hand). I did not even soak the peas.  Very simple and delicious!!

Used 1/2 chicken, 1/2 ham broth.  Used center cut slice of ham instead of bone.  Added 2 cups each: carrot, celery, potato.  Threw in handful of roasted red peppers I had to use and added nice color contrast.  Added 2 bay leaves, 1-2 Tbsp. fresh dill and about 1/2 cup fresh parsley in place of the herb seasonings and this was a 5 star conversion.

I made this in the slow cooker and had it on high for about 8 hours.  It turned out thick and delicious!  I didn't add the onion or the potatoe but instead took some others advice and put in 2 bay leaves and some onion powder instead.  I love it!  I froze well too, so now I have a good lunch or dinner on hand.

This soup is delicious!  It was better than what I remember my mother serving while I was a child.  For chits and giggles, I added a diced sweet potatoe because I didn't have majarom;I used alittle basil.  It was awesome.  My husband nearly ate the whole pot!

sounds good but it takes longer than 30-40 minutes to cook. Try at least 3-4 hours to be compelety done. I simmer mine all day and it gets real thick so add water to thin it some.

This was exactly  what I had been craving with the cold weather suddenly upon us!!  It turned out just perfect.  Made minor changes - I just could not imagine potato in my split pea soup so I omitted that.  I used some vegetable broth and chicken broth in place of some of the water (just using up leftovers).  I also did not soak the peas beforehand.  The texture and consistency were just to my taste, not too thick but not at all thin.  A big winner in this household!  Thank you for the recipe bluebayou.

I've never made split pea soup before, and this was really awesome.  I didn't have a ham bone, but I did have about 1.5 lb ham steak, I just threw it in there frozen and then cut it up about 1.5 hrs through simmering, and added right at the end. Also I didn't have any marjoram, and forwent the potato as I was out. Really really really really really satisfying!

Wow!  This is sooooo good :)...I did make a few changes based on past experience and feedback.  First I didn't have a ham bone so I bought some smoked pork necks.  I put them into the pot with some celery, carrot and onion chunks.  I just covered it with about 6 cups of water and added 1 can chicken broth and 2 large chicken bouillion cubes.  Then I threw in 3 bay leaves and left it to simmer for about 4 hours.  Next I let it cool.   Then I took out the pork necks and took off the bit of meat that were there and put them into a container.  I strained out the rest of the vegetables and put the stock and ham bits (in another container) into the fridge for the night.  In the morning I skimmed off the fat.  Then I cut up celery, carrots and onion into fine pieces and placed them in a pan to cook lightly in olive oil before adding to the stock.  When they had softened, I added them and the bits of ham to the soup along with the split peas (I did not soak them first).  I added 2 more bay leaves and a pinch of marjoram.  I let this simmer for about 4 hours stiring now and then and adding water as needed.  WOW this was soo good!!

This was my first attempt at pea soup and it turned out amazing!  I used a whole ham bone from a 15lb ham, added pieces of ham as well, and added some bay leaves.  Lots of flavour.

This was as close to perfect as I've found!  Good flavor, not too watery and the veggies were still intact.  I soaked the peas overnight and then rinsed and drained them.  I then added 2 14.5 oz cans of chicken broth and 1 can of water.  I had to simmer the ham bone for 2 1/2 hours to get it to fall apart like it should.  By then the peas did not need blending, they were mush.  Good mush.  I will definately make this again and again!

The soup is delicious.  Only I should have soaked the split peas overnight instead of the rapid method.  I know that changing the soaking water is the way to avoid some of the negative GI effects, but I wanted the soup in a hurry!

Boy does this recipe bring back memories. I have been making this soup for many years. However having learned how from my mother and my grandmother, they never used measurements, so now I actually have the recipe to hand down to my kids.  My mother always said "soup is great if you have unexpected company, add some water and you'll always have enough".  Thank you!

My hubby says this is the best soup he has ever had!!  And he hates peas! I simmer the peas for two minutes in half chicken and half beef broth and two smoked turkey legs and then soak them for an hour and then add the rest of the veggies and finish simmering.  Sooo good.

Delicious!  I used the hambone from Christmas dinner.  Didn't have any marjoram but used basil and oregano instead.  I did not soak the peas overnight, either, and it turned out just fine.  I did use a stick blender to smooth out the carrots and celery.  My husband and parents agreed that it was delicious so I'll be putting this on regular rotation--for non-holiday times I expect I'll just buy a small ham steak to use in place of the ham bone.

This recipe is GREAT! As others suggested, I pre-boiled the bones to get a really tasty stock. Also, I added about 1 Lb of diced smoked ham to have a full meal. Everyone loved the soup, including my 11 month baby. Thanks!

This was delicious!  It was my first time makingn split pea soup so a tip for other beginners - boil the split peas until they start breaking apart a bit (making the broth cloudy) before you add the other vegetables.  It took longer for the peas to turn the soup the right consistency than I expected and my other veggies became quite soft, which was fine for me but I imagine many people may prefer that they retain their texture a bit more.  Delicious!

I have never liked pea soup before. My boyfriend, family and friends all enjoy it; so I decided to make it for them. I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I actually ate and enjoyed this soup. Thank you for submitting the recipe.

Awesome! The best split pea soup I've had. This was my first shot at making any kind of soup... and since we had ham for Thanksgiving, I decided to give it a try. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used only 2 cups of peas. Didn't soak overnight. Used some chicken stock in place of the water. Delicious! Guests couldn't get enough. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was tasty, and a good way to use up leftover ham and the ham bone.  However, I have a couple of tips.  If you soak the peas beforehand (as I did) don't increase the liquid, as several reviewers recommended.  I did both, and the peas turned to green mush, and the soup was far too thin for my taste.  The flavor was good, however, which is why I gave it four stars.  

If I make this again, and I probably will, since my husband LOVES split pea soup, I won't pre-soak the peas, but will increase the liquid.  Also, I used turkey stock instead of the water the recipe called for.  With that, and the saltiness of the ham, I chose not to add the recommended amount of salt.

Not sure what I did wrong but the soup won't thicken up. I didn't soak the peas because i bought no soak ones. I added the 2 qts of water and the ham hock and boiled. Then I turned down to a simmer for 1 1/2hrs and added vegetables and cooked another 40 min. Still watery on top and a little thicker on the bottom. I turned the heat up and it's been cooking for another 45 min. Still no progress! I am so disappointed but I'm sure it was something I did wrong.

We loved this soup. Thanks, bluebayou! Our variations: used 2 slices country ham, diced, instead of ham bone. Used 2 14-oz cans of reduced-sodium chicken broth + 2 cans water. Used 1/2 onion instead of 2. Added 1 clove minced garlic. Used 1 full teaspoon salt. Didn't have marjoram, so used basil and parsley. This soup is even better the next day. My mother raved about it -- and she doesn't usually care for split pea soup! Another hint: change the peas' soaking water several times, rinsing them well under running water. This will reduce the gas problem!

I made this using a slow cooker.  I used a bacon hock as this was all I could find at Coles.  Instead of all water, some of the liquid was vegetable stock for me.  Really reccommend pre soaking the split peas.

For my second trial, I will add some pork stock cubes to the liquid and some Worcestshire sauce during the cooking process.  

I cooked on low for 10 hours and then teased the meat off the hock and returned to meat to the soup for another hour.

Thanks for this recipe.  It's a keeper.

YUMYUMYUMYUM!!! This was my first attemt at split pea and boy was it good!! I had a ham bone with lots of meat left on it from last weekend and I did make a few changes. But that is what is great about this recipe, you can change it up and it will always taste great because it is just a good foundational recipe.  I was going to be gone all day so I threw all of my ingredients in the crock pot and (No I did not soak the peas, big mistake, my house is a smelly war zone tonight. SO definately soak if you dont want the gas by product) I added everything but the celery and I only used 2 potatoes, I like more of just the peas. It was perfect. I cooked it on high for 7-8 hours and it was great!! Try this one!

Awesome recipe. I, like many others opt for chicken broth instead of water, it REALLY makes a difference. I use smoked ham hocks, I find the smokey flavor really adds to the taste. I've used this recipe for years and won't even consider trying another - neither should you.

AWESOME Soup!! Used left over ham bone & remaining bits after a party.

I let the peas sit overnight(actually day & 1/2 because I got lazy)in a pan of water w/several cloves garlic.  After draining, I sub. the water for broth using chicken bullion.

During the cooking process I skimmed the funky stuff off the top, and added the following additional spices:
5ish cloves diced Garlic, Rosemary, Thyme & Red Pepper Flakes. 

I also added an additional potato. And used a handful of baby carrots vs a big one.

Was wonderful and thick, without having to go thru the trouble to puree it.

Full of flavor.  Used ham bone from spiral ham with lots of meat left over. Did not use potato and the soup was plenty thick. I didn't have marjoram but used 2 bay leaves while broth was simmering.

Very good. I don't think my hubby was too excited when I told him we were having split pea soup for dinner, and I didn't know exactly what to expect, but we were both pleasantly surprised. Served with homemade wheat bread and salad. Only changes - used quick soak method for beans, added garlic, oregeno and parsley, and added diced ham. Nice thick and flavorful soup.

This was my first crack at split pea soup and it was delicious!  I used chicken broth instead of water for the soup (soaked the peas in water overnight and strained)...and used a leftover ham bone I had in the freezer from Christmas...this came out so thick and hearty, even my husband, the guy who doesn't eat split pea soup, loved it!  Thank you!

Awesome!  substituting Smoked ham hock for the ham bone and chicken stock for the water are musts!  Also, omit the potato as it soaks up the salt which is needed for seasoning in the soup.  It thickens as it sets in the fridge and since it makes a lot of soup, be prepared thin it out the next day.  It freezes well too.  I freeze in single size servings so it's ready to take to work for lunch!  (by request, I'm taking in an extra serving for a co-worker.  It's that good!!!)  Enjoy!

Made this in a cast iron dutch oven, bought ham hocks from Honeybaked Ham, used 2 qts. of chicken stock, and did not use the potato. My family really enjoyed this soup. I will make it again.
I would add bay leaf.

I thought I wasn't a Split Pea Soup person but had these peas I needed to use..I made it and have not been able to stop eating it!  I used Smoked Shanks because that was the only "bone in" ham I could find.  I don't know if that is part of what added so much flavor but then I also used some chicken bouliion granules.  I did not add any potatoes..just celery, carrots, onion, the pinch of marjoram and let it simmer. Yum!

This was a very good recipe.  I used barley instead of the potato and substituted oregano for the marjoram.  We are big soup eaters and really loved this one. Rye bread goes very well with it too.

Very workable recipe to create your own version.  I did use a ham bone and added extra left over ham from Easter.  The broth was very good, I did not add carrots and potatoes as I will trying to make more of a soup then a stew.  Used the shortened method for soaking beans worked well.  Added a few extra spices (garlic powder, oregano) and some chicken broth as well as water.  May use some more peas then suggested next time to make it thicker.  Simmered much longer (plus 2 hours) then suggested.  Added cornstarch to thicken but all in all a good base receipe to build your own creation!

This recipe is great! I also used split peas that didn't require soaking. I was worried that the soup wouldn't be as thick as I like it, so at the very end I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. This a great way to use a leftover, meaty, ham bone!

Really yummy!  The only thing I changed was substituting some of the water with chicken broth because I had some I needed to use up.  Next time I would put in more peas, it didn't seem to have quite enough to me.

This was very good.  I halved the recipe, did not use any marjoram, or potato and I also did not have a ham bone but I sliced some ham up instead.  This came out really great.  My picky husband even ate it:)  Thanks for sharing:)

Excellent with a few changes. I used 1 onion instead of 2, 2 potatoes instead of one, and about 1 C more water, and 2 chicken boullion cubes while the peas were simmering.  My family who does not even like pea soup loved it!  Will definitely make it again!!!!

Delish!  I made a ham last week just so I could make pea soup!  The only ingredient I added was chicken stock paste, for some salty flavor.  I also got flavor from the ham that I had already made.  I did adjust the amounts of the ingredients listed.  I need way more carrots, celery and taters in my soup!  The soup was a wonderful consistency ... nice and thick.  Hubby loved it, and our five year old had two bowls.  My mother even had to admit that it was good!

Fantastic soup, I will definetly make this again! Didn't have a ham bone lying around so I used cubed ham, still tasted fantastic. Also used chicken stock instead of water. Freezes great, I took some to work two weeks later and it was just as good as day 1. Thanks!

So great and so easy!  I made a few small changes; I used about 3 cups of vegetable broth to use up a carton I had in the fridge, and 5 cups of water to make 2 quarts of liquid.  I only had 1 onion.  I used smoked ham hocks which didn't have much meat, so I added a couple handfuls of cubed ham. This is the first time I have made pea soup and I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This was wonderful!!  You do have to salt and pepper this to your own taste, as the peas absorb a lot, but this is really easy and yummy.  We used our ham bone from Christmas, and it had lots of nice chunks of Honey Baked ham in it - delicous!

This recipe was just ok.  It was good at first, but I let it set for about 6 hours and when I reheated it, everything was mush.  I won't make this again.

Great, satisfying soup.  Omitted the salt and pepper.  Didn't soak the peas prior to preparing and the soup came out just fine.  Nice meal with crackers.  Thanks.

Great soup.  I had never had split pea soup before and this was super.  This really warmed us up on a rainy, chilly night.  Great when served with some crusty rolls.

The weather man should hand out your recipe with every bitterly cold forcast.  We,re in the -40's with wind chill here and I just made a pot of your soup.  It was excellent and hit the spot.

This is my go to recipe! Makes enough for leftovers and freezes well. Here are some quick tips:
Use only a COOKED hambone. If you’re skimming off impurities... your bone wasn’t thoroughly roasted. 
I cook the bone in chicken stock (bring to a boil then simmer) then add onions, carrots, celery, 3 cloves crushed garlic and cook till onions are translucent, then add the split peas. The split peas are supposed to fall apart so this soup has a gravy like texture. I remove the bone, add salt, pepper and thyme to taste. I add pieces of cooked ham at the end and my family prefers dumplings to potatoes so I add those aswell. This recipe is delightful as is, but your hambone makes a difference. I prefer a honey smoked ham bone.

I'm really not sure where all the good reviews are coming from but for something as simple as a split pea soup, this recipe is a total fail. First of all, it is very under salted. And then, way, way to thick that you cannot even cook it. Also, the vegetable additions are totally unnecessary. They distract from the appearance snd taste of what should be a simple comfort food. It took a significant amout of doctoring to get this edible.

Excellent but needs a few tweaks.  
1. Make the ham broth first with meaty bone, bay leaves, whole peppercorns, onion, celery, etc.   I then put mine thru a colander (vs. a strainer).   Not sure why reviewers make  ham based soup using chicken broth. 
2. Peas need to be rinsed/cleaned but not soaked.
Enjoy!

I am pretty sure I bought marjoram to make this recipe with the leftover Thanksgiving ham bone, but when I made it the marjoram was nowhere to be found. The soup got made without the marjoram and it was still great. Very thick and hearty. I did put in way more ham than what was just left on the bone so I could get my husband to try it. He loves it as well. Need to get some more majoram and make it again.

I use chicken broth instead of water and since I make it in the crockpot I don't use the full amount of liquid indicated.  I also add ham hocks.  One of my husbands favorites.  Rough estimate 1 serving = 7.4 ounces.

Needs more liquid. I used chicken broth instead of water for flavor. I also omitted celery and used an immersion blender to smooth it a bit. Kids loved it, it makes a TON.

What is with soaking the split peas?? I've made pea soup on and off for 40 years and have NEVER soaked the peas. Not necessary. For beans, sure or for whole peas but not split peas.

I love this simple recipe - it's very versatile and easy to modify. 

I like to toss in additional veggies; I added some garlic and leek once, and sometimes a yam instead of regular potato. One time I added quite a lot of parsley and it just went in and enriched the flavours. One time I ran out of split peas so I used 2 cups of peas and one cup of green lentils and it tasted great. 

 I like to give it a partial blend before serving it up so its not too smooth (like baby food) and not too chunky (like a stew) but a lovely middle ground. Husband-approved because he loves the salty ham taste even though you don't need to use very much at all. I like to serve it with some crusty rolls or baguette.

Alt recipe (If you don't have a ham bone/hamhock) Used the same ingredients (few adds). This is a 2 pot method (Because the peas need longer to cook so the veg will overcook) Put peas in chicken STOCK (not water) with 3-4 bay leaves, 1 Tsp poultry seasoning (contains Marjoram), fresh cracked pepper and simmer for an hour. (I DID NOT SOAK MY PEAS) In a fry pan start 4-6 pieces of bacon cut into thin strips over med heat until crispy. Add onions, saute for 5. Add carrots, celery 3 cloves of garlic. (A diced red pepper is also a nice touch). Sweat veg down and add a little color until just browning a bit (lots of flavor) Once all sauteed, add into your stock/peas. Now is when I add 2 cubed raw potatoes to the stock. Take a ladle of stock and put it in your saute pan to rinse all that flavor out of your saute pan into your soup. Slow simmer for an hour or until your peas are soft. Add cubes of ham/simmer for 10-20 mins. Season... Done.  Add salt last! The ham and bacon may have enough salt that extra is not needed! Depending on your peas, you may have to add more stock as you go. That's normal. I think I added 4 extra cups of stock as I went along. You MAY need to add more liquid when you reheat. The peas will continue to absorb liquid in the fridge. You CAN freeze this soup and it reheats quite well. =)

I've made this half a dozen times by now- it is wonderful.  The past two times, I haven't bothered boiling or soaking the split peas.  I just throw everything in the pot and let it simmer for a few hours.  I use a ham hock or ham bone and I do use the chicken stock instead of water.  I use my immersion blender at the end because I prefer a smooth split pea soup.  This soup is the reason I look forward to fall!

This was really good.  I hate peas and have never eaten pea soup. I made it for hubby because I had leftover ham and bone and got rave reviews and even I liked this! I used veggie broth instead of water, and did not soak peas but sautéed onions with garlic then added peas and followed rest of recipe after that.  Delish!

This was my first time making Split Pea Soup and by following this recipe, I nailed it! So so good and it makes your house smell delicious!

I'm a single gal and used all the portions called out in the recipe and felt it made the perfect amount of soup - enough to last me 1 meal a day for 3-4 days. 

As others mentioned, I substituted water and used chicken broth instead.  I thought the soup might be a bit too liquidy, so after everything was done cooking, I removed about 2 cups of the broth from the top and then it was the perfect consistency (for my taste).

 5 stars.

Good recipe base for split pea soup but I made additions.  I omitted the marjoram and did not have a ham bone so I used one thick sliced ham steak (my first time and it was great!)I add to a dutch oven couple swirls olive oil, 1 finely diced onion, 2 large stalks finely chopped celery (celery always give a great added flavor), 3 cloves minced garlic, 4 bay leaves. 1-2 tspn. poultry spice, 1-2 tspn. ground thyme, salt & pepper to taste. Soaked 1 pkg of split peas the night before and after veggies are softened I add split peas & 1 quart chicken stock with 1/2 quart water.  I simmer for at least 4-5 hours on simmer. The last hour I add: chopped up ham steak, 4 carrots small dice & 2 potatoes small dice.   I like my split pea soup thick & hearty, not 'soupy'. I keep checking the consistency and add more water if needed (I add hot water to pot). Also added 1 chicken bouillon for more flavor...after the 4th hour I take about 1/4 of the soup into a separate bowl and puree (using my blender stick).  I then add back to pot and simmer.  Usually done after 5 hours and its soooo good!!!  The chopped ham is a great addition and 1 slice is enough, unless you prefer more.  This soup is great all year round.  Thanks for sharing!!

I used cubed ham from a precooked ham, I switched water for chicken broth like others suggested. I put it through blender at the end and then put ham back in. My first attempt at pea soup in my life and it turned out so I'm happy.

If you make this in a slow cooker it's super simple! All ingredients go in and cook for 8 hours! I only used one onion and made w/o potato.
It was a bit thin but I think the kids preferred it that way.

I made the ham stock first and then soaked the peas in it, but I used everything in the recipe.  It makes wonderful soup.  All four of my kids ate it, and my husband, who does not like split pea soup, asked for seconds!  Very good!

My whole family- including our children (ages 2, 5 and 7) rave about this recipe! The only alterations I make are to add 2 chicken bouillon cubes and two bay leaves. The flavor profile develops overnight- so leftovers are amazing! We serve it with yeast rolls. This "soup" is very filling and satisfying on a cool day. The kids always ask for seconds!

This is a delicious recipe. I've made it sooo many times. I read the reviews and chose to the sautee veggies (adding minced garlic) in butter prior to adding to soup. I also add 2 bay leaves, crushed red pepper. and garlic salt to taste. A great way to use up leftover ham from Easter/Christmas dinner. GREAT!

I guess when you make too many changes to a recipe you're not really reviewing the same recipe anymore. Nevertheless here's what I changed: 2 cups dried peas, 1 quart chicken broth instead of 2 quarts water, 2 cups diced ham instead of ham bone, only 1 tsp salt, only 2 stalks celery. Most of these changes were based on other reviews. Next time I will leave out the marjoram as I'm not really a fan.

It was fine, but I'm still looking for a fabulous split pea soup recipe. Update- Haha!  I just went to rate this "new" recipe and saw that I had already made it before and given it 4 stars.  This time, I felt like it was 5 stars.  I brought it to a pot-luck and everyone asked for the recipe.

I made this soup for a "soup n salad" gathering of classmates. We all graduated in 1972 and get together monthly. The raving was unbelievable!
However, I'm allergic to actual onions so I used onion powder and garlic. Not enough ham on the bones so I chopped up some smoked ham & added 20 min prior to serving.  Also, transferred to a crock pot. I also have a very picky eater client.  He asked for seconds!  Making it again!

Put all the ingredients in a crockpot on high, stir a couple times during cooking.  After maybe 5 1/2 hours the soup is ready.  Delicious, easy, very satisfying, and the potato, carrots, onion, and celery give it more depth.  I am ready for another cup, and this is leftovers from last night's dinner.

Darn good, even with some substitutions!  It's kind of like a stew.  I used some smoked, uncured bacon since I didn't have ham.  No marjoram either, so a couple bayleaves, some garlic and a little of this and that.

Confession: I never really cared for Split Pea soup when I ordered it in a restaurant; but my boyfriend is a big fan, so I decided to make it after Christmas (to use the leftover spiral sliced ham on the bone from our Christmas dinner). Well, I am officially converted! It was my first time making Split Pea Soup and I have to say that it was EXCELLENT! Thanks for sharing the recipe bluebayou! This one is definitely a keeper! :)

This is the most hearty, soul warming pea soup and I've been making pea soup for years...  This is the 2nd time I've made this recipe and the only thing I changed was to omit the marjoram because I didn't have it the 1st time and forgot to pick some of for the 2nd time around.  I will make it again and if I think of it, I'll pick up the marjoram and actually add it to the recipe to see if it changes my mind one way or the other.  Serving it this chilly New England night with sliced toasted baguettes before the NE Patriots game!   Going to try it sometime in the crock to simplify the process.  Thanks for a keeper Bluebayou, it's New England approved!

This is sooo good! Never had split pea soup with potatoes in it but it adds another texture that makes this the best I've had. Added a bit of cooked bacon since I've always used it in past recipes. About 4 slices cut up. Will keep this one!

This is the absolute best Split Pea recipe ever! I have made this with smoked ham hocks and when I add the carrots, celery and potato, I diced the meat from the ham hocks and put it back in with the veggies. I have also made this with the leftover ham bone from a spiral sliced ham, and I also added a few thick slices of diced ham. My daughter who dislikes peas, cooked celery and cooked carrots is one who requests this often. Serving this with cracked black pepper trinkets instead of plain crackers.

Made for the first time last night.  The entire family ate more than one bowl.  They requested that I make this once a month and put it into the regular rotation during the cold months.

I really like this recipe but I also find it extremely hard to buy a ham bone.  I live in Canada and nobody sells ham bones. Neither grocery stores nor butchers.
I have instead substituted it with farmer sausages or savory bockwurst.
I found that this soup is even better when reheated after a day or two.

This was AMAZING! From the pictures, it didn't look too appetizing so I was hesitant to make it. But I made it anyway and I am so glad I did. My husband, who is probably like many other husbands out there, a skeptic when it comes to new and strange foods, but when this soup is made correctly (i.e. follow the directions) he RAVED over it!! The only thing that came to mind was that it tasted like beef stew except instead of beef broth you have thick creamy peas. Definitely give this one a try, it's worth it!!!

This soup is one of my winter staples...enjoying it now as I write this review!!! As with any soup, I personally prefer it to be as hearty as possible...so add more potatoes, carrots and ham if you feel the same...I go lighter on the onions and I add garlic. I also substitute 2 cups of chicken broth and add celery salt instead of the celery...I can then eliminate the salt...5 star soup!!!

Very good. I sued the leftovers from a bone in spiral ham and added some thyme and garlic. I also used more potatoes and only 1 onion. Tasty!

Easy and delicious.  Tweak to your tastes and if it's too thick for you, just add a little soup stock!  Hearty and satisfying.

I used 32 oz carton of chicken broth and added the water to equal 2 quarts.  I also used 2 cups of green split peas and 1/2 cups of yellow split peas and placed  everything in crockpot with ham bone and it turned out excellent!

My sister is a great cook and she loved this soup! I soaked the peas for 8 hours. I cooked all of the veggies at the same time in a BIG pot because I doubled the amount of celery, potatoes, and carrots. Two grated medium Russet potatoes thickened the soup wonderfully. Yummy!

I have never been a fan of split pea soup, I guess it's the color?  This recipe was WONDERFUL, my picky son loved it, and everyone asked for seconds.  I didn't think it was possible!  I did boil the ham bone for 1-1/2hrs before I assembled the recipe, and it turned out nice and flavorful, not too thick at all.

Yes it's thick, but a delicious recipe. To boost the flavor I always use chicken stock in place of water, and recommend keeping some extra on hand to "thin out" the soup when you serve or re-heat each bowlful. I also chopped up 4 cloves of garlic and added those to the onion, sautéed together before adding ham... and since I cant always get a ham bone, I sometimes use pre-cooked cubed ham from the deli case... that works just fine. Delicious soup, always a hit. Thanks SO much for submitting this recipe, it's a keeper!

Awesome, threw in ham bone, peas (after I rinsed them) carrots, celery, onions, boullion, pepper, sea salt, fresh chopped garlic and bay leaf. Also had left over pork ribs from the night before, (no bbq sauce on them) boiled them all together and after an hour when everything was falling off the bone, removed bones and cut the meat up smaller, DELISH

I did not care for this recipe as written. When I doubled the peas, reduced the other veggies, added some herbs to give it flavour and blended it before adding the meat, I got something delicious.  Otherwise it's watery.

Great recipe! I added a little chicken bouillon. I also used Jenni-o turkey ham to try and be a little healthier but it was awful! I first cut it into big chunks to simmer in the soup and add flavor but it ended up looking like a spongy mystery meat after cooking for a an hour. I just took it out and had a vegetarian soup- which was very tasty!

I did not have a ham bone so i used and chopped spiral sliced honey ham. Omitted the potato's and celery. Took the suggestion of the chicken broth and i found it too salty. Next time i will use all water with a cube of chicken bullion and no addtl salt or will try low sodium chicken broth/stock.

Absolutely delicious. I added 2 extra cups of water and used no soak peas. We had a giant left over ham bone so I used that. I used plain water and just boiled the bone in the water for a little bit before I added the peas, which created a nice ham broth. If I were to add chicken broth to this I'd do half chicken broth/half water because I don't want it to be overpowering. Also didn't add any potatoes. Spice wise I upped the salt and pepper and added thyme, bay leafs, onion powder, and garlic powder. It was soooooo good. Thank you for sharing. :3

This split pea soup is awesome! So far everyone who I've made it for agrees too. Note, it tends to finish a little thick so I add extra water to thin it.

Oh my goodness, I never thought that there would be a receipe that would out do my mother's.  This pea soup receipe is absolutely sinful and is worth the time that it takes to make it.  DO IT NOW, you won't be sorry.

What a great Split Pea Soup recipe!  It is lower in sodium with no additional fat added.  It's as easy as chop, drop and simmer!  I made this because I had leftovers from a giant spiral ham my husband and I had enjoyed.  We have so much leftovers that I started  looking for ways to do other things with it.

What I've done differently was I dropped all the veggies in when the ham bone in the soup begin boiling, and before I begin letting it simmer.  This was because I wanted the veggies to help sweeten the soup as well as making the veggies tender enough to feed my 16 months old daughter.  And, she loved it!  This is, by all means, not an OUT OF THIS WORLD soup. But it sure is good and it is healthy!  I will make this again and again.  Enjoy!!!

Very easy to make and really delicious. I used 10 cups of half chicken broth and half water. I used tasso ham instead of ham bone and cubed smoked ham in the finish. This turned out wonderful.

My first review was the lack of flavor, etc. this time, I just added common sense.  I used chicken broth to make the consistency of the soup not so chunky.  This recipe is good, the only thing I did differently is I boiled the peas and onions for 2 minutes, then let it soften for an hour.  Then I followed it, except chicken broth (must use to develop flavor.)



This is my first time making split pea soup.  I followed the recipe exactly, I had to had quite a bit of seasoning to get it to taste right.  Next time I will use chicken stock to boil the peas/onions.  I had to use an immersion blender to make it creamier.

It was "okay" but won't use this recipe again.

My family loves this recipes.  The very first time I made it, I didn't change a thing.  Now that I've made it several times, I've made a few changes.  I added a ham hock and a Honey Baked ham bone.  I also added a small about of heavy cream to give it some extra creaminess and richness.  I like to run my immersion blender in the pot before I serve it to take out some (but not all) of the larger chunks (we like a more smooth texture).

I made this exactly as the recipe was.  It was completely bland and was way too thick.  I like a thick soup, but this was rock hard - like scooping ice cream.  I fixed it by adding about 1.5 cups of chicken boullion which not only made the soup fluid but also added the missing flavour

This was the first time I made Split Pea Soup. The instructions were easy to follow and I was happy with the flavor, texture and thickness of the soup. I had some fresh rosemary on hand, so I used that instead of the marjoram and must say  I thought it was the perfect flavor to complement the ham. Husband also loved it!

This was delicious and exactly the flavor I was looking for!  My modifications were only to add a bit more ham (probably about 2 cups, cubed), a bit more water (about 1 more quart than it called for), slightly less onion (about 1 onion), and about 3 tablespoons more salt.  It is awesome, and I saved this recipe in my MyRecipes.  Thanks!

This is an easy and tasty recipe! Let me say, the ham bone does make a difference! The first time I made this, I just used chicken stock and topped the soup with crumbled bacon. The second time I made it I used the hambone. Wow! The flavor was much richer and my kiddos liked looking for the bits of ham in the soup!

Just OK. Prefer the more traditional, simpler, creamy style to this "Vegetable Pea" version.

I have never tried split pea soup, but when I asked my hubby what his favorite soup was, he said split pea. The things you're still learning after 15 years! This smelled really good, but I did not love it. However, at his request, I would try it again. Next time I would chop the veggies really tiny so they cook quickly, and I'll be sure to get a ham BONE, not neck bones. My grocery store only had neck bones, so that's what I got. The bones fall apart and it was impossible to be sure I got them all out of the soup, which of course meant I bit down on a few. All in all, not bad, I think I'm the problem, not the recipe, but I did not love it, so it's a 3 for this time.

This was my first time making Split Pea Soup and I thought it turned out very well.  The adjustments I made were the following:  I used a ham hocks, added more salt, added garlic powder, substitueted barley for the potato and didnt soak the peas.  I did however simmer the soup all day.

Good stuff.  I omitted the potato but added worcestershire sauce (~2 T) and liquid smoke (~1t).  Works great with croutons and worcestershire sauce to taste.

Consider adding more ham or ask your local butcher to help you select a really meaty bone. Mine was mostly fat and I ended up having to go buy a bit of extra ham to toss in the soup at the end. Still most excellent though!

This recipe is similar to the one I make, except I add 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a meaty ham bone (from a shank cut) that we have leftover from Christmas or Easter meal -- no need to weigh it.  I would highly recommend no potato in this recipe as other reviews have mentioned.

Very smooth annothing to complain about with this soup!!! The only thing I did differently was to remove half the water the peas soaked in and replaced it with 4 cups of chicken broth. Will definately make this again for my family.

Great recipe. The only thing I did was add about 2 more quarts of water and more salt and pepper. I don't like think pea soup. Otherwise this is a traditional recipe with great taste.

My 3 girls (7,4,3) and I  eat Amy's canned split pea soup; this is 1st try at doing it myself.  Soaked peas overnight in water.  I drained, used about 2 cups of those peas, added about 2/3 box of chicken stock, didn't measure, but almost a whole box  (Kitchen Basics brand) and added one finely diced onion, 3 finely diced celery stalks, "pinch" marjoram, thyme, salt, pepper, and one large minced clove of garlic.  That is IT.  No ham (I don't like to use pork) and no carrots or potato.  Simmered for a couple hours (which it will seem like it is too watery), after the peas started to become mush, I pureed in a regular stand up blender, and WOW, let it sit to cool a bit for the kids, and it thickens to perfection-- if you have a picky eater child, ESPECIALLY if they have a hard time eating veggies because of texture, try giving them this!  After pureeing the soup (could not taste any individual piece of anything!) the kids LOVED it.  ALL 3!!  Try it-- poor moms of little picky eaters  :)

This is just delicious.  I have never made pea soup before but have had several different versions at friends homes.  I made a few adjustments as some other reviewers had done.  I soaked the peas overnight in water and then drained the water off and added chicken stock only.  I didn't have majoram so added a little thyme and 3 bay leaves and left out the potato.  It needs more salt and pepper which I added.  I left the ham bone from a baked ham I had done for Thanksgiving and left it in the pot after I added the celery and carrot.  I removed the ham bone and used a hand blender and blended the soup to a puree.  Chopped up chunks of the ham and added to the soup.  Great recipe!

This is the best pea soup recipe I have ever tasted.  It is also a great comfort food and very satisfying.

I will want to cut down on the salt next time, and I had to thin it out quite a bit (I just added extra broth), but it was tasty and just like Mom used to make.

This tastes exactly as I expected - just like mom's =] However, my mom always used bacon instead of the hambone, and now I know why.  It was tricky to get all the meat off, and it kinda grossed me out a little.  This recipe is a perfect basic, comfort-food split pea soup, but I'll use bacon in the future, just to keep it simple =]

I am not an expert but it is so easy to make this soup it is almost impossible to mess it up. I usually make it with my left over ham bone and yellow or green split peas. I never add salt because my ham has more than enough already

I have made this several times and love it!!! I have added kielbasa to it a few times also which makes it even better. I also use vegetable broth in place of about half of the water.

Simply delicious.  Very hearty and tasty.  I sauteed my veggies in the pot before adding the water & ham bone.  Then I simmered for an hour, really pulling the ham flavor from the bone.  I then removed the bone, added the dried peas, added the meat from the bone back in, brought to a quick boil, then reduced & simmered for an hour.  Just perfect.

This was a very good and hearty recipe.  Once cooled, it was very thick so I added a can of chicken broth and adjusted the seasonings.  I used my emersion blender for only a few seconds to leave some chunky texture, then topped the soup with some crispy bacon bits.

This soup is very good.  I used chicken broth, instead of water.  I also added a little chicken broth to thin the soup when I added the veggies.

AWESOME!!!!  This is a tasty soup. I like my pea soup smooth, so when the peas and veggies were cooked, I took the ham bone out and milled the veggies. Then took the ham off the bone, diced it into small pieces, added it to the soup. My husband and I love it. Thanks for the submission.

Very good pea soup, though preparing it exactly as indicated I found it was a little bland. I ended up throwing in a bit more oregano (which I substituted for the marjoram), roasted garlic powder and more salt. It was yummy and hearty, and perfect for a cold winter evening. I would recommend not serving anything to flavourful as a side dish (or use this soup as a side to a flavourful main). The taste of the soup is too delicate to hold up against something stronger.

I love split pea soup and we don't have it too often. We don't put potatoes in our soup- we cook small noodles separately (like mini star shapes) and then put them in as we like. Had no marjoram and used parsley instead, added 1 clove garlic, and one chicken bouillon cube. added a bit more water and a few less peas. Thank you!

This soup was pretty good.  Based on other reviews I did not soak the peas and added garlic with the onion and sauted before adding to soup.  Also added bay leaf.  Even with those additions the flavor was a tad too bland for our taste so I think next time I will increase the seasonings.  If you like your peas chunkier with texture do not cook it as long as it says b/c it results in a smooth pea soup with only the veggies as chunks.

Just like my mom's.  I loved it.  I left out the potato - didn't find it necessary.  The longer you let it simmer with the ham bone, the better the flavor.

Excellent, stick to your ribs soup. To jack up the flavor, I sauteed the onions with three cloves of garlic, then browned the meat and then added the soaked peas. I used a large sweet potato rather than a regular one and it added fabulous flavor. I also added two bay leaves and parsley. This became a main dish by using two pounds of dark turkey meat cut in chunks rather than a meat bone. I served it with rolls and it was hit of a supper.

Very good - not quite 5 stars - but very good.  I've not had pea soup with the addition of other vegetables before.  Was not sure if I'd like that, but tried it, and really enjoyed the potatoes and carrots.  Will continue to use them.  Thanks for sharing!

So delicious and I have two kiddos and a husband, all fairly picky eaters- they all ate it and loved it! Wow, this is a keeper for sure, followed the recipe except used chopped cooked smoked ham and added it with the carrots. (I have a weird thing with using bones) Anyways, I also added some garlic gotta have garlic and omitted the potato- !  It was so hearty and yummy- served with some crusty bread, done deal!  Thanks again and couldnt have been easier!

This is my new favorite soup to make. I couldn't find the bone-in ham at the grocery store, so I substituted it for bone-in ham steak. It turned out better than expected. I'll never buy the canned soup again!

delicious and hearty.  i use chicken stock instead of water and add cubed chunks of ham steak.  otherwise, no changes.  i normally delay adding any salt til  it's almost finished cooking b/c the ham bone is normally very salty.  this soup definately brings me back to my gram's split pea soup.  which, i have to admit, when i was a kid, i wouldn't touch.  but now this is one my faves and i'm making it every 2 months.  i make a double batch, a 10 quart stock pot, and freeze it.

I made this last night.  Very easy, I really like it.  Personally, I'm not liking the celery in it, but I can always omit it next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe and the one on the back of the dried split pea bag to make my soup.  It came out very well.  Used chicken buoillion cubes instead of water.  Will used this recipe only next time since it seems a bit easier.

Excellent split pea soup recipe... this is pretty much the split pea soup of my childhood, and it turned out very well.  

Some changes I made were replacing half the water with chicken broth, and cooking it a bit longer on the stove to cook off some of the liquid.  I like my soup thick... just a personal preference.

Absolutely wonderful with a baked potato or fresh-baked bread.

Nice all round recipe - can change it around, which I like.  Made it once with the hambone boiled first and then the second time just added leftover ham.  I've also tried it with potato and then later just omitted it and added garlic and oregano.  I like not mushing up the cooked soup in a blender like some recipes suggest, so this recipe was immediately more to my liking.  I also use chicken stock for some of the water when I have it (like someone suggested). Now to try the sausage idea -  :-)

Very good!!! After soaking the beans, I drained them and used chicken broth. I added way more carrots and celery than it called for. This was a really easy recipe. I am making it again right now!!! YUMMY!!!!

Thought I'd give this a try, as it is good comfort food. Simmered the peas on the stove for about 3 minutes, then soaked for about 1.5 hours before adding ingredients and cooking futher. Added frozen baby carrots, dash of thyme and rosemary, black pepper, finely chopped onions, & real bacon bits for flavour. Didnt have celery, ham or potatoes, and the texture and taste were still great! DH liked it enough to take to work. A success. thanks for sharing.

This soup is perfect!  Using the ham bone adds wondeful flavor.  Somtimes I substitute chopped turnip for potatoes to cut back on carbs.  If you make them small enogh, most people don't even notice the difference.

After some tweaking this has become my all-time favorite recipe! 
Here are the changes I make: 
Only 1 onion, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, no marjoram. I also add in some minced garlic with the onions and at the very end I add about 1/4 c of milk or cream. If you don't have a leftover ham to use for this recipe, "Cumberland Gap" ham chunks work really well!

My hubby wiggled his brows with the first spoonful.....a surefire sign of a winner! I took a few liberties with this recipe, just because that's what I do.  I doubled the recipe so I'd have plenty to freeze, added some chicken bouillion, garlic, thyme, a splash (or two) of cooking wine, served with corn bread and voil`a....a wonderful, filling soup.  Can't wait to have it tomorrow when I know it's going to be even better!  Thanks for the recipe, Sandra!

I have to say, this recipe was awesome!  Perhaps even better then my grandfather's (and that's saying a LOT!).  I doubled the ingredients called for, as I truly love pea soup and have'nt had it for more years then I can count.  Did not have marjoram, so I substituted thyme as some other reviewers have done.  Added some oregano too.  I like a lot of peper and salt, so I trippled those ingredients.  And I ommited celery as I did'nt think I'd like it in the pea soup.  But other then those changes, I followed the basic recipe and it came out fantastic!  It does thicken up signifigantly the next day...I'm having some for lunch right now!*LOL*

Thought this recipe was excellent.  I did soak the peas the faster method stated in the recipe-but disgarded the water once I was done completely soaking them.  I also rinsed the beans very well, then put them in the stock pot with 2 quarts of chicken broth.  I used on potato and grated one carrot and used a pinch or so of coriander and dill weed.  The soup was not as thick as I had hoped, but I feel that had something to do with not using the same water as I had soaked the beans in-I just thickened it with some cornstarch and it was perfect...even better the next day.  My husband never liked pea soup, but surely loves this one.  I will try making this next time in my crockpot-I'm sure it will be wonderful.  thank you Sandra for sharing your recipe.

Having never had split pea soup, I thought it would be fun try. My husband liked it (hence the four stars) but I just could not get over the color to like it. I did not add the potato because it was really pretty thick without it.

Great recipe for that left over ham cooked during the Holidays! The chicken broth used for half of the liquids is great, and I also use a tablespoon of Ham flavored Soup Base in powdered form if the amount of ham is less than I would like...this really boost up the ham flavor without increasing the fat content & calories
Much like the recipe I have made for years except without the potato. I usually add 4-5 Bay Leaves as I do when I make chicken & dumplings.

This was really good.  I didn't add the potato because I've never had split pea soup that included it and it was fine.  I did have to add more salt than suggested, but it was a very nice soup.

Fantastic!  I like to add a pinch of dried dill to my split pea soup.  I didn't have a ham bone, so I bought a 1/4 inch slab of Russer Pit Ham from the Kroger deli and cut it into cubes.  Absolutely delicious.

Delicious!  This was the first time I ever attempted split pea soup and the entire family enjoyed it (even my 3 year old!)  I added a little garlic but it probably didn't need it, the flavor was wonderful.

This is a superb recipe.  I nixed the potatoes, I don't care for them in split-pea soup, but added an extra carrot.  Although it takes a long time to prepare, it is well worth it.  Rather than ham bone, I added saved ham juices (solidified, fat removed) and added left over diced ham.  Using the ham bone makes it more salty than we care for.  I love it, family loves it, and the only way to make it better is to figure out a way to do it in a pressure cooker so it's faster!

This soup is excellent! I was tired of paying for cans of mediocre pea soup, so this will be a staple for me. Used smoked ham hocks, and was more MMM MMM good than Campbells. Thanks!

Tried this recipe yesterday and my husband and I love it. I did add a couple tablespoons of chicken flavored bullion to it. I also used ham steak only because I did'nt have a ham bone. My husband wants more for dinner tonight.

Excellent recipe! I always add potato flakes to my split pea to thicken it up a bit. This is one of the better split-pea recipes that I have come across in quite awhile.

Absolutely perfect.  Added more potatoes just because I had them sitting around.  The kind of food you keep eating after you're full just because it tastes soooo good.

Outstanding!  I've made this soup at least 4 times since I found this recipe a few months ago... Wow!  I do add a bit of garlic and just a pinch of curry powder (sorry!) but I get rave reviews every single time!  Thanks for a solid recipe!

I made this soup with vegetable broth instead of water and I left out the ham bone.  I didn't have just marjoram but I had a seasoning mix which it was in.  I used that and it turned out great.  Top a bowl of this delicious soup with some garlic crutons and it is absolutely perfect.

I have made this many times for family, friends and staff.  They love it.  I have made a few changes that really work.  I use chicken broth (carton} instead of water and I added an additional diced potato and carrot. I put everything in the slow cooker and cook for 8 hours and in doing this you don't have to pre-soak

This is a great recipe.  I use a smoked pork hock as the ham bone, and wow, the flavour is great!  Once I take the meat off the bone, I pop the bone back in the soup as well, for extra flavour.  There is never enough of this soup!!! Thanks for a real Keeper!

Very nice basic recipe.  I made one alteration that did NOT work.  My husband does not eat pork, so I substituted Turkey Bacon for the hame bone.  The soup leached all of the flavor out of the bacon, leaving it tastless and it had a terrible tofu-like texture.  Next time I make it, I will use the ham bone and dh can find his own supper.  
other than the bits of bacon, the soup flavor was terrific.  I think next time i will take the suggestion of a bay leaf and possibly add a touch of curry powder.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I needed a basic recipe to start with that I could liven up.  This is a tasty recipe in itself!  I used an extra potato and instead of a hambone, I used a full package of polska kielbasa.

this soup is great for a cold day!  I've made it a few times and it freezes really well.  I'm not a big ham fan so I omitted the hambone and added 8 oz of diced ham.  To make up for the lost saltiness, I added a bit more salt.  and some pepper.  I added an extra potato too!

Good stuff.  I didn't add any salt because it was salty enough with the ham bone.  Also, I didn't have any marjoram and I only added about half the amount of onions that the recipe called for.  Still it was really good.

It's a great recipe. I omitted the salt and pepper. Used Bellview garden vegetable and chicken soup base. Didn't have marjoram used oregano and added a tsp of sugar. Added chopped garlic with onions.  My family loved it. Also had yellow peas and it worked out great.

Made it to the "T" this afternoon, starting it around 3 o'clock, because it says 2 hours total cooking time.
It's now 7:15 and it's barely even cooked down.  
Don't get me wrong, the flavor is absolutely FANTASTIC, but it's like biting into broken marbles.  Hopefully it'll be finished before bedtime.

I used chicken stock instead of water and it was absolutely delicious!!!  Very filling and easy, just takes it's time to get there so def feel like this is a weekend recipe or adjust it for the slow cooker.  Family loved it and was perfect for a cold winter weekend dinner!

great and easy recipe.  i did not add marjoram and celery on purpose.  i also added more potato.  at the end it wasn't thick enough for me so i mixed in some corn starch which did the trick.

I love split pea soup and have tried many different recipes for it, but so far this is my favorite.   I thought that 1/2 teaspoon of salt might be too much because of the ham, but it wasn’t. It was the perfect amount of seasoning. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will be making it again and again.

Taste is fantastic, didn't use a ham bone myself but all the meat around it instead.  I would recommend sauteing the veggies just to soften them up a bit before putting them in though.  Otherwise might take a bit too long to get them soft.

This won raves from the whole family! I did as one reviewer suggested and made the broth with ham bone in a separate pot. I did add a few teaspoons of "Better than Boullion" chicken to the broth along with bay leaves, black pepper and the celery ends leftover from the diced celery. I followed the directions for the speed simmer soaking of the peas for an hour, then drained and used the stock from the ham bone broth to continue with the recipe.  Other than that, I pretty much followed the recipe with just the addition of garlic and thyme. Very, VERY tasty!!!

"1-1/2 lb ham bone" 
Easy to say, hard to do.
Can't find them, no place, without buying a ham.

This soup was delicious! Next time I’ll leave the carrots out as they took longer to soften and didn’t add to our enjoyment of the soup; otherwise no changes. Full family agreement on it being well worth making again!

Initially I made 4 Qts of Ham bone broth- in which I let the broth cook for 4 days on low with a slight simmer.  The meat I give to the dog. Less time cooking - keep meat. I didn’t add marjoram.  Instead I did the Bay leaves, Rosemary, Garlic, S&P, & Thyme.  Delish!  I may pick up some precooked ham and add later- but the broth is fully embodied with flavor.

My grandmother used to make split pea and I loved it then. I had a hambone leftover from Christmas and decided to give it a try. This recipe turned out great - if I do it again I’ll add the celery a little sooner in the process. I didn’t have marjoram so I used Italian seasoning as a substitute

Very nice tasting, easy pea soup recipe.  I used the pea soaking method of 1-2 hours prior to cooking rather than overnight. I’ve made this a couple of times now and it’s consistently a winner.

Made as-is is fine, perfectly tasty, I consider this a base recipe for dried peas or lentils or any small dried legume.   Traditionally in addition to fine chopped onions, a whole onion dotted with a few cloves is added, and the ham hock is pre-boiled and drained before stewing with the peas to remove excess saltiness or smokiness (depending on what you’re using). Instead of doing all that, this is how I use my leftover holiday ham that is usually clove-y enough even being boiled and drained first. I prefer marjoram over thyme but you can use either/both to taste. The potato is also optional/not necessary/a fine addition. Some people like a bay leaf, not the way my Swedish grandmother taught me to make it, but it also tastes great. Still,  I prefer it without the bay leaf and save that for when I make 15-bean ham soup. 
You can also make the mirepoix, toss the ham on top, cover with water and/or broth (chicken stock) add your peas and simmer low and slow in one step instead of pre-soaking (just very, very low). I use an immersion blender and whir the peas up right in the pot for smaller batches, for a bigger batch I remove half the soup, blend in the blender and return because we like some chunk in the soup. This soup is meant to be simple, inexpensive and hearty so do what you can to Un-complicate it. I haven’t tried this in my instant pot yet but it’s probably a good candidate for that device. If you like Ärtsoppa, try Fruktsoppa but use a recipe that does NOT call for cann

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious. I thought it was too simple but refrained from adding other spices, just the marjoram and it tasted like the soup my mom made. Way better than Progresso and simple. I made it in my slow cooker adding the vegetables at the end.

Made this a few days ago with a few minor changes. Added some carrots and increased the garlic.  This was absolutely the best split pea soup recipe I have tried. Husband also said it was the best. Served with cornbread. A complete meal. Took a little longer to cook than recipe called for to get peas to the consistency we like. Otherwise, recipe is spot on. Looking forward to left overs tonight.

So-o good!  Followed it as is other than using smoked ham hocks. Think next time I will buy a small ham steak for more meat. I shredded ham up to go further but would prefer small chunks.  Liked the potatoes too. Will make again.

I added 1/4 of red pepper, chopped, (1) 32 oz. an organic chicken stock and (1) 32 oz. an organic vegetable stock instead of water. I made mine in my Slow Cooker.  On low for 6 hours, then added 2 ham slices for the last hour on high. Thick and tasty!

I read the reviews and precooked the nam bone in the chicken broth for 1 1/2 hours prior to putting all into the crock pot. Wow,,, for the first time making this soup, it turned out amazing! It will see my table again many times in the future.

I had a leftover ham bone so I was looking for a recipe my husband would like. This is a delicious split pea soup. The only changes I made is I added a couple bay leaves and omitted the potatoes. Plenty enough  starch with the peas.

Would definitely make it again.  As suggested did not soak the split peas.  Chopped onion in a chopper instead of sliced.
Added the garlic, thyme and oregano.  Next time I would add
More chicken broth/water - was very thick.  Delicious!

My husband loves this recipe. I'm not a split-pea soup person, but even I thought the flavor was pretty darn delicious. I made as written the first time, and it was wonderful. Subsequently, I've done the following, and we like even better with the small changes: Don't soak beans, totally unnecessary in this recipe; begin by sauteing onions (I use a very small chop) in stockpot in a pat of butter to soften and enhance their flavor; add 2 quarts chicken stock instead of water; add a sprinkle of granulated garlic and thyme. If using off-the-bone ham, add during the second cook period when you add celery and carrots so the flavor doesn't get completely boiled out of the meat. The cook times are spot on. Great recipe, thank you!

This is a great base for split pea soup, and very similar to what Mom used to make. I don't eat ham - but I added some turkey kielbasa, which gives it a nice flavor. I also added some smoked paprika, which kicks up the smokey flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

Very good. I skipped the potato, celery and marjoram. Added another cup of peas and swapped out the water for my home made ham stock. Also I tripled the recipe and canned a great deal of it. Yum!

Absolutely the best pea soup I’ve ever eaten...except for my Grandma’s.  Really should be made with a hambone as you can’t beat the flavor the bone adds.  Makes a nice large pot of soup,  and I was able to freeze some of it for another day.

I chose the quick soak method. In following the video, I drained the peas and added 2 quarts  fresh water to cook. I followed the other instructions but my soup was very runny and needed more flavor. I added 2-3 tablespoons instant chicken bouillon I would reduce water by 2 cups, maybe even substitute chicken broth for the water.

I added chicken broth to thin it out a bit and add flavor.  My family loved it!  Next time I'd add extra potato, carrots and ham to make it a bit more stew-hardy.

Would definetly make again

I boiled the peas for 2 minutes, then soaked for an hour, then used that water to start soup. I needed to add about 2 cups more water. Omitted salt and marjoram  (didn't have any and chose not to use oregano in its place) Used a ham bone from a maple cured ham.Didn't have to puree the soup as the peas dissolved on their own. Would absolutely use this recipe again.

This was good, but I had to add a TON of extra seasoning. It could be because I didn't use a ham bone, but rather just pre-diced ham. I would like to try it again with the ham bone.

This is amazing! Just a couple of tweaks:  added 2 cloves of garlic and a bay leaf. I also added a tsp of cornstarch/butter with some broth to make a thickening agent as my soup was a bit watery for my taste.  I added this during the last 10 mins to thicken in, and it was perfect.  Best split pea soup I've ever had

Have made this several times and turns out great. I triple up on the peas cuz I like a thick soup. Also I boil the ham bone separately and use the stock plus the water for more flavor. I actually use a large stock pot so there is a lot to go around.

This soup is my all time favorite! I cannot find anyone who makes it better than me! ok, my Sister, maybe!
I add a smoked shank instead of ham hocks..trust me on this one! Bay leaf and thyme add a lovely flavor as well. Eat with a crusty sourdough loaf and well, not many things are better!

This is really good with a few tweaks. I used chicken broth instead of water and I cooked ham hocks in the  broth for over an hour before adding to the soup. I started with 10+ cups of broth to make sure I had enough once it cooked down. I sautéed the veggies in a little butter before adding to the stock. I used 2 potato’s. 

No need to soak overnight.  I puréed 1/3 of the soup at the end to make it a bit velvety. This is so good!!!

I used a " smoked ham hock", I had it in a 350 degree oven for 2 1/2 hrs. Soaked the peas overnight and went from there. I would cut down on the celery next time as mine was very green and stringy, (imagine $4.99 for celery here in small town Ontario Canada, not organic either). Enjoyed and will make it again for sure.

4 stars for flavor. Next time I’ll add some peas after 45 minutes so some dissolve and some stay in tact for texture.

First time making soup EVER!  This was a great recipe and easy to make, for a soup novice such as myself.  I used a ham bone left over from a spiral sliced ham that was cooked the previous day.  At 30-40 minutes before the end (when you cut the ham off the bone) I also added quite a bit of extra left-over ham.  
For potatoes, I used some red-skinned potatoes that were already cooked.  I sliced them up and added them at the 30-40 minutes before the end part as well.
Everything turned out great.  I does turn out very thick.  When reheated it's a little too thick.  Next time I will use more water.

I grate the onion and carrot and use bay leaves instead of marjoram.  Chicken stock or just water and it tastes just as good.  Season with pepper but use salt sparingly if using chicken stock.  I make it in my crock pot and always turns out delicious.

Great starting point, but I did changes things slightly.  I did not pre-soak the peas, only simmered for 1 hour, stirring occasionally, in chicken stock (32 oz carton), with small amounts of salt, pepper, marjoram, thyme,  garlic powder, poultry seasoning, 2 bay leaves and a packet of ham flavored concentrate. After the hour, I added chopped carrots, celery, onion and potatoes, and simmered for 30 more min.  Had to add more water as it was a little thick. Ten minutes before it was done, I added some leftover chopped spiral-sliced ham. I think I'd cut back on the cooking time by 10-15 min so the peas would hold more of their shape. Delicious soup which will surely be better after it stands a bit.

We really liked it and definitely would make again, the only thing I wish were different was that it were thicker and maybe I put too much water in, I didn't think the directions were very clear as to how much water.

I did do a few changes so I don’t know if my rating counts but I read other reviews and took what I thought fit my needs. I sautéed the very thinly sliced onions first with 3 cloves of garlic. Then added the ham bone with a big chunk of meat and peas ( I only used 2cups of peas, I like a thinner soup) and then the spices and used chicken broth instead of water. I did not add salt since I used the broth. Everything else I did the same. I had about 2 cups of diced meat after I cut all of my meat up. I think it was a perfect amount. This was a very good soup. My picky 8 year old ate it.

To the person who said split peas do not cause gas... yes, yes they do!! :0  BUT, that being said... this is a yummy recipe!! I made a batch and canned it! I used ham dices from the store because they were on sale. Everything else was perfect and each pint is a hearty serving and just the right thickness!! I will definately be canning this again... but will soak and rinse first!! ;)

I made this in the slow cooker. I made very few changes. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and two cups of water, two ham hocks, and more potatoes. I also added bay leaves. Absolutely delicious!

Deeelicious!!!  I gave this recipe a try and I'm so glad I did. I was waiting a recipe from a friend but she never got to it so I use this. It's wonderful and I never made this pea soup in my life.
I had to make some changes because I do not have marjoram. I used dried thyme, black pepper, and bay leaf for my seasoning. Did not need any salt because I used 2 cubes of chicken bullion.  I didn't measure my water, a small mistake, made ham stock in advance so I used all of it which was a little too much. The soup was great but maybe not thick enough. I also follow other reviewers and sauteed garlic and onions in very little EVOO. Only used 2 cups of dried split peas (soaked overnight). I would definitely make this again,  probably after Christmas since it's the only time we buy ham.

Followed recipe pretty much, substituted  oregano for marjoram as I didn't have any on hand, and followed package directions on peas. Turned out great, very tasty. Will make this again.

I am from Newfoundland and pea soup was a staple in my home while growing up. Unfortunately my mother died before I had the sense to get any of her recipes. So I searched for pea soup recipes and found this one and with a couple changes it tastes just like I remembered. We never added celery or potatoes so I don’t either. But I add turnips, carrots and onions because that’s what I was used to. One change I make is using chicken or vegetable stock instead of water which was what my mother used. And I always use yellow split peas, not green. Anyway it turns out delicious every time and I am grateful to have this old but delicious recipe.

I normally don't do reviews on recipes I didn't make as written but this was so good!
my adjustments I made was I drained the peas and added 2 quarts of chicken stock and two cloves of garlic. My husband (he had never split pea soup) said it was in the top 3 soups I've made him.

Delicious! I made the soup without potatoes and without the Bay leaf. I am not a big fan of potatoes in soup and I did not have any bay leaf. This was my first time making the soup & was pleasantly surprised to discover that the soup thickened right up once refrigerated and chilled overnight. Will try again with bay leaf for more flavor and I will increase the amount of celery, carrots & onion.

I toss everything in the crock pot for about 6 hours on low, smash up the beans and it’s done! I usually end up adding extra liquid (I substitute water with chicken broth). I also use ham steak or ham leftovers, no ham bone needed.

The soup turned out great. Used 1 cup chicken stock for added flavour. Forgot to add the potatoes and reduced the amount of peas for a less viscous consistency. Will definitely be making it again.

Solid recipe.  Easy to make changes to it to suit your tastes.  I did not soak the peas and it still turned out tasty.

I love this recipe. It’s almost like my mom’s recipe. I added 2 beers. I used corona, but prefer a heartier beer like IPA. I used a smoked ham in chunks. I usually use ham shank (more meat). When it’s about done, when ham falls off bone, I take it out and use potato masher and add back ham shank meat and I cut up a ham steak. I no longer put it in blender because the last time I did, it exploded and I burned myself and made a huge mess.

I made a few changes based on what I had on hand: only one onion, diced instead of sliced. 2 bay leaves instead of marjoram. Cut the ham off the bone before simmering so it would be less slippery. Omitted the potatoes. Also I don’t know how to measure 2 quarts of water so I just filled my 6 qt pot up 1/3 of the way - ish. Best split pea soup I’ve ever had (sorry, Mom!). It is thick without being too thick and so so so flavorful.

I omitted the potato but otherwise made no changes.  It was good (4 star) immediately after cooking but delicious (5 star) the next day! I did skim a small amount of gelatinous stuff from the top after it sat in the fridge the first night.

Following suggestions by other reviewers I substituted stock for half of the water during cooking.  I was cooking the soup for a crowd so I doubled it.  One batch went into the Crockpot and the other into a big soup pot on the stove. Both recipes turned out very well.  I didn’t have a ham bone so I substituted chopped ham.  This worked well.

Made potato chunks larger and chopped vegetables larger also. Good flavor not  overpowered by peas. Would not change a thing as my man gave it a 10.

I read a lot of reviews before I made it.  I didn't add any salt,  ham hock with no additional ham, used 6 cups of chicken broth (no extra water), and 4 cans beans in place of dried beans.  Turned out great.  Will definately make again.

Made as is, with following changes: added 2 cups chicken broth, using 2 condensed cubes (Made for 4 cups).  Despite extra 2 cups of liquid, plenty thick.  Added 2 cloves garlic & thyme, otherwise I believe I followed to the letter.  Great flavor, may add an extra two cups of liquid next time .... but this was great without it.

I did use some of the recommendations from other reviews that I read.  I used the posted recipe as a guide.  I used 1 quart of chicken stock, and one quart of water.  I added a shy teaspoon of marjoram and a shy teaspoon of thyme,  a bay leaf,  I had a ham steak that I cubed up and also cooked it with a ham bone for added flavor.   Makes for a delicious autumn meal.

This split soup recipe was just what I was looking for. Easy directions to follow.  I chopped my vegetables, onions and red potatoes very small.  The soup came out delicious and I ate it 3 nights in a row!!  I absolutely will make this again!!!!

Split Pea soup is one of my all time favorites and this recipe is a good template. I made some modifications, and it turned out fantastic. I replaced half of the water called for with chicken stock, in addition to the marjoram, I added a pinch of thyme, and bay leaf. Instead of ham I used bacon which I pre cooked before putting in the soup, and I added some of the bacon grease to the soup as well. 
It was almost like my moms, it turned out fantastic.

Fantastic. I used a smoked ham bone and it was delicious, every time my coworkers walked by they asked what great thing is was eating. Really needs no salt to be added.

This was my first time making and eating split pea soup. It was wonderful! I didnt have ham, so I used 5 pieces of bacon instead. I also didnt have Marjoram so I subbed with italian seasoning. I used 2 small potatoes and added garlic powder. I also soaked the peas overnight (12+ hours), but I drained the soaking water and added 1.5 quarts of chicken broth. The thickness of the soup was perfect not thin and not too thick. I will definitely make this again. Tasty, easy and inexpensive.

Very good. Soaking the peas overnight really cuts down on the cook time. I add canned potatoes.

This was tasty overall. I soaked the peas over night then strained and rinsed them. I just used what I had in my fridge 1 large onion chopped, 1/4 bag of chopped carrots, 2 cloves of chopped garlic and instead of chopping a potato I used potato flakes. I also didn't have a bone in ham but I did have 3 ham steaks so I cooked the peas in beef broth to add more flavor since I was missing the bone.

This pea soup turned out excellent. Very tasty and filling. My husband ate it and he "doesn't like pea soup. I'll make it again. I had to mince/dice a slab of ham as we're not big ham eaters so didn't have a ham bone.  He asked me next time to ask the butcher if I could buy a ham bone.

Very good . Prepared as written a great split pea soup . As I write this I am cooking my second batch inside of two weeks . (Caused by accidental access to ham bone)  .Am tweeting by sautéing vegetables and not pre soaking peas .

This is almost exactly like my mother-in-law's soup, which we've been making for decades. The only thing I altered was to add about 4 bay leaves and a bouquet garni of 4 garlic cloves, a few allspice berries, and some fresh thyme and parsley sprigs. This recipe works especially well when you substitute all or part of the water with chicken stock or bone broth. Also, shortly before serving, it's a good idea to "bind" pea soup (only IF you have time) by melting a bit of butter in a small pot, adding an equal amount of flour, slowly whisking in some of the warm soup, bringing it to a boil for a few minutes,  and then returning the whole mixture to the soup pot, letting it simmer. Be sure to taste it at the end and add salt and pepper as desired! Very importantly -- this recipe gets better with "age" and  is equally GREAT when doubled or even tripled, as I'm doing today. :-)

I used DonnaNJ's instructions for making this in the crock pot and they were spot on. After about 5 hours into it I thought I made a mistake as it was so runny and the peas were still crunchy. But after 8 hours (on high), it was perfect!  I also used a bag of Mirepoix and that cut down on a lot of chopping. Can't wait to make this again!

I used cut up smoked turkey leg instead of ham, oregano instead of marjoram as I didn't have any handy & added 2 chicken bouillons to water. This soup recipe is so hearty & satisfying. Sometimes  it's  thick & I thin it out with some heavy cream which gives it extra body. This time it was a bit thin so I added an extra potato & it thickened up beautifully. Tried many split pea recipes. This is my favorite!

This came out perfectly creamy with the pre-soak method as recommended in the instructions.  I had two links of mild Italian sausage and used that instead of the ham and it was delicious.  I cut the onion down from two to only one and it was  fine.

Very Good. I took the advice of other reviewers and added two large cloves minced garlic, a couple of bay leaves and a little thyme. Very flavorful made with just water but may decide to swap out some if the water for chicken broth next time to see if there is a difference as some of the other reviewers suggested.

Great recipe! I soaked the peas overnight in water, then in the morning I measured off the remaining liquid. I used chicken stock to replace the amount missing . It was delicious. Made a lot. I froze the remaining for future meals.

Awesome recipe! Great flavor. I haven't had homemade pea soup for many years.  I would have gave it 5 stars except it came out much thinner than the picture and what I was used to growing up.  Next time I will add more peas and potatoes to thicken it up.

Made the recipe exactly as directed, adding a small amount of water when simmering the hambone for consistency sake. Delish!

Delicious. My family loved it! Even my son who "doesn't like soup".   I  soaked the peas over night and then drained the water and used vegetable broth for the soup (I also only used half the salt in the recipe). It was perfect!

This is the best soup ever.  I didn't soak the beans overnight.  I made it last night and had it today.  Used chicken broth instead of water and didn't change anything else.  My husband who "doesn't like split pea soup" had two bowls.  I'm so happy I found this recipe!  Love, love, love.

Very delicious! I made it almost exactly as written, but I didn't have any marjoram so I left that out. I also left out salt (ham i is salty enough). I added garlic powder, and red pepper flakes.  I used an immersion blender and blended it all fairly smooth. Will save and make again!

My husband doesn't like the texture of onions so I wrapped an onion in cheese cloth and had it simmer with the broth and ham bone.  I also added 32 oz of chicken broth, thyme, a bay leaf and ham pieces (not from the bone).  I omitted  the potato because I thought it would get too thick,   Delicious.  Will make again!

Very good, whole family enjoyed it. Per reviews, I did not do any soak procedure. .  My only recommendation for others is to use caution with the salt. Depending on what type of ham bone/meat you have you may be imparting a lot of saltiness with that alone.  My soup was salty but I was able to save it by adding water and a little half & half. It was plenty thick so this didn't thin it too much. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used turkey Italian Sausage instead of ham. It was wonderful! We had leftovers for 3-4 more meals & each time it got creamier and more delicious. I will definitely make this again!

This is a good base recipe. When going the veggie route I add liquid smoke instead of the bacon or ham. Have been thinking of throwing in smoked cheese (Gouda) too and see what happens.

I've never made pea soup before but always enjoyed it.  This is really, really good.  I'm definitely adding it to my rotation.  My only substitution was I used 50/50 water chicken stock, rather than straight up water.

I've now made it twice and I love it.  I do not use the soaking liquid as the water to cook with, I drain the peas after soaking.

Used 2 cans of chicken broth and filled can with water twice. Whole bag of split peas (16oz)  and ham bone. Sautéed onions with butter add a little garlic. Came out great a little thick could add a little more water or broth if you like it less think.

As another reviewer recommended, I added Marjoram, Bay Leaves and garlic. Absolutely fabulous! I skimped on H2O originally so that it would be thick and needed to add H2O a couple of times during cooking to get it just right. YUM!

Great and simple. I used a smoked ham hock and pulled it out so I could use an immersion blender before adding it back with the vegetables. I used bay leaf and peppercorns and discarded after cooking.

After reading all of these reviews about how thick this soup was, I'm pretty sure I did something wrong, as mine was watery and bland. After soaking the peas for 8 hours, I drained them, rinsed them, and added back 2 quarts of broth. Next time I make it, I will rinse the peas, but I'm not going to soak them. I also think I'll add only 1.5 quarts of stock, and add liquid if needed. I like REALLY THICK split pea soup. I ended up adding dehydrated mashed potato flakes until it reached the consistency I desired. Since it was pretty bland, I added cayenne, a dash of nutmeg, extra salt and pepper, and it turned out alright in the end. I also added 2 cups of diced ham, which gave it some extra heartiness and flavor.

I added chicken stock, garlic salt, bay leaves, a little garlic. Turned out great! Used organic peas cooked them for 30 minutes on high boil before adding the rest. Cooked all day brought to a boil for 15 -20minutes then medium:medium low for the rest. Hubby said it was one of the best pea soups he's had. Excellent!

All I can say is TASTY!

I made one change - I used smoked ham hocks.  It's a personal taste thing.

Wow! Great recipe! This is the first time I've ever prepared split pea soup and my husband is a bit of a aficionado so I was a little intimidated to say the least. I try to stick close to original recipes, but will use tips occasionally. I did boil the ham shank one hour in chicken broth as suggested by another reviewer and added two bay leaves. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe as written and let it do its thing. After using my emulsion blender I found the consistency a bit too thick for our taste. So, I added 2 more cups of chicken broth, increased all seasoning by 1/4 each to adapt to the added volume, and tossed in 1/2 a tsp minced garlic and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes to give it a extra kick. Holy moly! My husband flipped out over this soup saying it is the best pea soup he's ever had in his entire life. THANK YOU!

Yum, nice and thick! I add extra carrots and celery for more nutrients and texture and because I omit ham. And I use all chicken stock instead of water cause I'm a salt junkie. the result is filling and savoury mmmmmm!

Great comfort soup!
I added extra ham and potatoes. (Had leftover salt potatoes that added a little more flavor) A stick to your ribs soup.

Love it.  Definitely will be a recipe in my arsenal now.  Only added 1/4th the onion called for and no carrots due to personal preferences.  Still came out great.

A great and simple recipe. The only changes I made was to do the boil with only the un-soaked split peas and the ham bone. Brought to a boil and cooked for about 20 minutes. Take off the heat and let cool.  Remove the ham bone. On several batches at a time use the blender to puree the softened split peas along with all the water. I makes the whole pot of soup very smooth. Return to the stove. Add all vegetables and all the ham that you can strip from the bone. Cook until the carrots are soft but not too  much. follow cooking time as noted.

This is a very good recipe. The only change I made was to use a bay leaf instead of the marjoram because that was what  my Mom used. I was a bit too thick for us so I did add a little more water. Thanks for this recipe!

This was an amazing recipe, but I did make some changes, both out of necessity and because of suggestions made in the comments.  My local grocery does not sell ham bones or even ham hocks, so I decided to start with a 50/50 mix of water and chicken stock. I used the quick-soak method mentioned in the directions, and then added 2 10oz ham steaks, diced, after the peas had soaked for an hour. When I began cooking the peas, I added the ham, 1 really large sweet onion, 2 cloves of diced garlic, dash of salt and pepper, and 2 dried bay leaves. Followed the directions from there, though I did a final seasoning with Tony's Creole Seasoning (amaaaazing!!!). Ate two bowls of this in front of my roaring fireplace! It was everything that I had hoped for :D

This recipe was so easy and so tasty. I didn't have a regular potato, so I used a sweet potato instead. What a great surprise taste and texture to the soup. Used 1 sweet onion and leftover ham instead of the hambone. Never again will I have canned split pea!

I have made this recipe for years like this and just last month I used chicken broth instead of the water and the taste was wonderful.  I will make it with the chicken broth from now on.  I do add more potatoes  and carrots then what the recipe calls for and it gives the soup a hearty taste!  The ham bone is best to use as I used to buy a thick ham steak and cube it, but the bone gives a lot better flavor.

My new favorite pea soup recipe.  Drain the water after soaking.  I had veggie stock on hand so I added 1 quart and then the ham bone etc.  Everything else according to the recipe.  Like a warm hug on a cold day!

Made as written, and I've done it at least five times, it's terrific-- except that I've only ever used a smoked ham hock, never a ham bone.  But by all means customize; the recipe is made for that.  Regardless, it's easy and wonderfully flavourful and nourishing.  I like it best when you slice the onions very thinly, and they disintegrate but the fine taste remains.  If it's too thick for your taste, thin it with water or stock.  Used to be when I thought 'winter soup', it was Julia Child's French Onion that popped to mind first.  Now it's this one.

This recipe is excellent as is,  but the second time I made it,  I added 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves,   a "secret" ingredient a friend gave me many years ago for pea soup.   It was even more wonderful the 2nd time!

I think the taste of the the soup was great. But... I followed the directions to a tee and it was so watery. I even waited hours later hoping it would thicken up but never did.  Now im left with adding more potatoes or flour or more peas to thicken it up.

This soup is delicious!  My husband and I, and our 27 year old daughter were quite impressed w/ my creation today! I followed the recipe as listed, except I did not pay attention to exact water measurements.  When I added the ham bone, I just made sure the bone was fully covered.  I also threw in about a cup of extra diced ham.  This recipe is a Keeper!!

Very good.  I used a ham steak since I could not find a hambone.  Soaked peas in chicken broth for  6 hours then cooked for 1 1-2 hours.  It didn't need 40 min to finish the veggies, maybe because we diced them small.  Added a bay leaf and garlic...next time MORE garlic!

This soup was a hit! I made this with a left over honeybaked ham bone and boiled, then simmered it for 90 minutes in chicken broth before starting the soup. I then used the chicken broth as my base for the soup instead of water. I soaked my peas overnight and gave them a good rinse before adding to the chicken broth. I also ended up simmering everything for almost 4 hours. I will definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe half a dozen times.  It's a super easy recipe and turns out great every time.  It's a crowd pleaser. My in-laws now request it following every ham dinner, to make good use of the ham bone.  I've never put in potato - just personal preference. And I never used marjoram because I don't have it.  The salt and pepper are really the essential spices here.

Lovely.  Included 2 bay leaves, 3 cloves garlic, marjoram and thyme.  I only had ham pieces I cut up.  4th time I've made it and no matter how you want to tweak it, its so good every time.  Thanks for the great soup!

This was tasty, but it was a bit thick. It was more of a pudding texture then soup. The flavor was great though.

Thank you for this recipe, it is delicious!! No one on my house likes split pea soup but me, so I make a big batch and freeze indiduvidaul portions.  I did add a little extra garlic and I did soak my peas overnight and it went together quickly, I did purée it with my immersion blender as it makes it very creamy!!

This is a very nice, hearty split pea soup. The added carrots and potatoes give a nice bite and flavor to the soup. Definitely a keeper. I didn't have Marjoram, so used Oregano which worked fine.

Delicious! I added more veggies, ham, garlic, more salt and pepper, additional water, and thyme. Killer soup that is great for those with food allergies or those needing to get some hearty veggies and fiber.

yummy, it is thick like some have mentioned, but that is how I like it.  quite salty and I did not add any salt (probably just because of the ham I used), but again that is how I like it.

Perfect soup for autumn weather! Used chicken stock as a base and let it simmer all day in the crockpot. Added garlic, bay leaves and other customisations to add more flavour.

Very good recipe. I would not change a thing, I did put just a bit more water but I think original amount is fine too. I did add 5 fresh leaves of sage and thought it worked great. Will make again.

I like the consistency of this soup, reminds me of how my mom made it. 
I did a simplified version: rinsed, but didn't soak the peas, sauteed the onions for a bit before adding the peas, 8 cups of water, spices, and part chicken/part beef bouillon (I lessened the amount of salt). 
Boiled then simmered 1 1/2 hours and the peas were quite broken down.
Added carrots and boiled/simmered for another half hour and it was done in two hours! 
Also I added some hot sauce for an extra kick since split pea soup can have a monotone flavor, and also due to me not having potatoes or celery.

I did the recipe for what it calls for, although I only had baby carrots. The marjoram can be substituted with oregano. I don't even know what marjoram is, I looked it up and Google came up with it being or being similar to oregano. 

Much enjoyment while cooking!

Good soup but it needs a bit of a kick so I add finely diced red, green & yellow peppers, as well as flakes of bacon (sometimes turkey & sometimes pork). I also remove the celery but add an extra potato & extra carrot to compensate. Lastly I add more spice; a pinch of garlic & of thyme as well as a sprinkle of mustard powder. Yummy!!!

Like many others, I added a bit of garlic (1-2 TBSP minced).  I also eliminated the potatoes but added a large slice of maple cured/cooked ham diced into small pieces. Just before serving I added a cup of milk.  This is a huge family favorite!

This was really wonderful soup!  We used a ham steak instead of ham bone and added a sweet potato we wanted to get rid of.  It turned out great!

This was delicious! I love split pea soup and was always afraid to make it.  I had the bone & left overs from a boiled dinner so figured I would give it a try.  I even used the potatoes & carrots from the left over dinner.  This was SO EASY to make & the whole family loved it!

Very thick and filling but sooooo good! If you start early enough you don't have to soak the peas at all. Freezes well too!….as a side note, I found you don't have to follow the recipe exactly, it's just as good with added spices or if you don't have EVERY spice in your kitchen that's listed in the recipe.

I've used this recipe a few times however like many of the other reviews I adapt it a little. Basically the same ingredients only in addition I use some chicken broth powder (oxo soup base)) and a couple of teaspoons of bottled fresh garlic, no potatoes (it's already quite thick) and I throw everything in a bowl and simmer for 8 hours. Remove the bone and puree everything with an immersion blender, cut the meat of the bone and put it into the soup and it's ready to go.

I've soaked the peas in the past but find it makes no difference. If it's it's too thick I add more soup base and water, if it's too thick, I add some instant mashed potatoes.

A touch of balsamic vinegar adds an interesting flavour. (1tbs)

This was really good the flavored were yummy I originally didn't purée it and I lived it that way but then I puréed a second batch because my husband likes the puréed soup. I preferred it non puréed because it had a mealy texture puréed... But the flavors were yummy both ways , just a matter of preference.

Recently made this recipe in my crock pot. It's a good basic recipe that you can alter to your family's tastes. I used half chicken stock and half water, omitted the marjoram and potato and added a bay leaf while it cooked.

I did make a few changes, suggestions by others, but this soup was WOW fantastic! Super easy too. I used half-water and half chicken broth, added garlic, 2 cups potatos, 2 cups, carrots, 2 cups celery, some garlic and only 2 cups of split peas. I also used a left over ham that was on the bone and still had a good amount of meat. It does take longer to cook than 1 1/2 hours, but over all it was excellent.

I made this recipe last night and didn't change anything. It was good but a bit bland. I think next time I will try chicken or vegetable stock in place of water and a bit more seasoning.

Very yummy & easy!! I didn't like the celery so I leave that ingredient out, but other than that I follow recipe exactly. I also don't soak the peas because the instructions on the bag of dried peas says peas don't need to be soaked. Serve w/ bread & salad & it's a great dinner!

we loved this! I had cooked a ham two days prior, in an apple juice worchest. sauce mixture, so my ham was a little sweet, but made a very delicious addition to this perfect soup. Will definitely make this again.

Takes a long time to cook but is absolutely DELICIOUS! Changes I've made to enhance it: 5 celery sticks, 4 carrots, half water & half chicken broth, and 2 big pinches of marjoram. SO GOOD!

Best recipe I've tried for split pea- my husband's favorite soup. Added beef base because I had no chicken broth as suggested by other reviewers. Threw it all in my crock pot for six hours. Ended up rather thin so I added a little cornstarch. Ended up being the perfect consistency one it had cooled slightly. Loved it! Hopefully I can replicate it in the future.

This was really tasty!  I had a bigger ham bone, so needed to use more water.  So, my soup did not come out as thick as I would have liked.  The flavor was spot on and I would make this again.  Kids even like this one.  Makes a ton and freezes well.

I followed the directions only leaving out the potato and I cooked the ham bone in low sodium chicken broth.  This was my first time making split pea soup and it was a hit!  My family loved it! Thank you so much for the recipe and the reviews and suggestions.

One does not need to soak split peas.  It will save time not to do so and will not affect the recipe.  This recipe is quite good.

Tasty split pea recipe and easy to put together.  I like using tarragon instead of marjoram, and I add a fresh diced tomato at the end of the cooking process for a little more color and flavor.

Absolutely delicious. After making it as is the first time I made a couple of adjustments. I used one quart of Kitchen Basics unsalted chicken stock, used 5 carrots, and reduced the split peas to 2 cups. I used 1.5 cups of green split peas and .5 cups of yellow split peas. We have been making this year round because it is so healthy and an easy way to sneak in vegetables.

This recipe is so good. This was the first time I made split pea soup. I didn't even have enough carrots but the soup was just fine.

We always make a double-batch with our New Years' ham, and freeze 5 or 6 containers for dinners in a pinch or to give to friends who are sick.  This is probably my favorite all time soup.

Great soup!  We added another extra quart of water and a quart of chicken stock plus one bay leaf.  Our ham bone was super meaty (4 lbs meat and bone).  Enjoy!!!

Great recipe! I had to modify with what I had on hand but the ratio was great. I added some bacon, basil and thyme with a bay leaf. Also, a little garlic. Yum!

Because the meat counter at my grocery store didn't have a ham bone, I incorporated changes by other reviewers to give the soup more flavor that would be missing without the bone.  I sauteed the onions with 2-3 cloves garlic in a little olive oil before simmering with peas.  I then added 2 quarts of low-sodium low-fat chicken broth and the peas, and added a bay leaf with the marjoram and the pepper, but skipped the salt because of the broth.  I bought a ham steak and didn't want it to dry out, so I didn't add it until the rest of the vegetables went in.  The soup was very thick by the end, but easy to thin out in individual bowls (I ran out of chicken broth so I used hot water, but there was no loss of flavor).  I also saw that some people removed the ham and blended the soup before putting the ham back in, but we tried it first and liked the texture the way it was.  I love split pea soup and this was a great and easy recipe.  I can't wait to try it as intended with the bone.

LOVED this recipe, but made some adjustments to kick it up a notch and make it AMAZING: I used chicken stock instead of plain water, added a pinch of dried basil and a pinch of parsley to the veggies while they were being sautéed, and used a smoked ham steak and cubed it up (since that's what my grocery store had)and reserved half the split peas for the last 30 min of cooking to add texture to the soup. This soup also freezes well and is perfect for pulling out of the freezer to reheat for a meal!

We loved this soup and will def make again!!

A very good hearty soup. I did however add a bay leaf, as well as a bit more marjoram, to boost the flavor a bit. Overall, it was a big hit. Perfect for a rainy day!

Super easy and healthy! I like that most ingredients for this recipe are ones most of us have in their kitchens already. I've never made split pea soup before and my coworkers that I shared this soup with think I'm the best cook ever! Love this soup and will definitely make again!

Thank you, bluebayou, for this excellent recipe that gave me something great to do with the remnants of a Honey Baked Ham.  I did not bother with the potato but did add a couple of bay leaves and extra water and came out with a soup that even my toddler-grandchild was crazy about.  I'm grateful for your step-by-step instructions that made making this soup foolproof.  Thank you again!

Great recipe.  I always add a couple of chicken boullion cubes, and since I like kick to my soup, I also chop up a couple of jalepenos. Delicious.

I made this in my crock pot and it was so very yummy!! I had a ham bone leftover so I put it in the crock pot with the water, as well as a bay leaf, and the onion which I sauteed in butter. I then "cooked" it on high for about an hour. I then added the veggies, and the peas (which I rinsed). And lastly I added some chopped up left over ham. I did end up adding two packets of chicken seasoning (like boullion cubes) as well as some cornstarch... because for some reason my soup didnt come out super thick, which was fine! My husband and I loved this soup and had seconds! I will make this again!!

I used baby carrots and only 2 stalks of celery (we're not too big on celery in this house), also used a ham steak with a bone in, in place of the 1 1 /2 pounds ham bone... turned out excellent! Great recipe! Husband loves it!

I made my first home made pea soup with this recipe and loved it! I didn't add the celery or the marjoram because I just didn't have any, but it still tasted so good. 
I'm making my second pot today. Pea soup is one of my favourite, and since I can make it home made I will never open another can of pea soup. :) 
Thank you.

This reminds me of my grandma's pea soup, which was the best on earth (in my opinion!). I didn't have a ham bone so I used pork shanks I got from our local grocer - almost couldn't even tell the difference between that and the ham. Scrumptious!!

I tend to throw in whatever vegetables I have so it tends up end up a little different each time but it's always yummy. I usually add a oxo tablet if it's a little bland - freezes very well.

I made this using chicken broth for water and turkey ham to keep the fat content down. I also served it with hot sauce on the side for those who like a little kick. It was delicious, my family ate the entire batch! This is a real keeper.

Notes to self:
Used 2.5 cups peas, cause that's how much is in the bag. Used 2 whole onions, 4 carrots cause the kids love 'em best, 4 boullion cubes, started with 10 cups water and will probably need more, 2 red potatoes, 3 celery stalks. *Boiled peas 2 minutes, and simmered 1 hour. Transferred to crock pot. Sauteed the onions and garlic, then added with the ham to the peas. Added potatoes, celery and carrots 40 min before dinner. ***

Excellent soup! Just what I was looking for! I did not soak the peas & it was fine. I used neck bones then added some smoked pork later in cooking process. Also, due to allergies, I substituted egg noodles for the potatoes. Already have orders form my husband to make again soon! Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup was so yummy!! I cooked this in the crock pot and I did add more water because I could tell that it would be thick and I prefer my soups not so thick.  I did get a ham bone from the honey baked ham store and this made the soup really tasty!  I will be making this soup a lot this upcoming winter!  Husband loved it too!  I served this with cornbread:)

Delicious! Followed directions as written and it came out wonderful. Even my picky son liked it. I added extra ham to it at the end, as not enough had fallen off the bone that I used.

This soup was delicious, and couldn't have been easier to make. I didn't have a ham bone, so I used cubed ham instead. The potato and carrots added so much more flavor. I will definately make this soup again.

WOW! This soup is just like the kind my mom made when I was growing up. I only have one suggestion: add more water while cooking! After I finished cooking the soup, I let it cool down, then put it in the fridge overnight. The next morning, what I had was not really soup, but had very thick conistency kind of like mashed potatoes. But still delicious!

I'm giving this a 5 stars based on other's reviews and additions.  I made this for my meat eating boyfriend and he said it was the best yet.  I ommitted the potatoe and celery, used chicken stock, pinch of marjoram and thyme, used only two carrots diced and one onion.  I started out with cooking the chicken stock and ham bone and then when all the items were added to the pot, I then started the timer for 1 1/2 hours.  I added the carrots after the 1 1/2 hours and then cooked for 40 minutes more.  During the 40 minutes I removed the bones and chopped up the itty bitty pieces of ham.  Make sure to remove the grissle.   This took me a long time but from my boyfriend's reaction, well worth it.  I am a vegetarian so I don't know what the soup tastes like (I never had it in the past, if I did, it wasn't memorable.)  I gave some to my neighbors, too, and they loved it.  So if I can cook it, anyone can.  I rather have him have home made food then going McDonald's.

This was just about the best split pea soup I have ever made.  I did make a few minor changes though.  I did not use marjorim as I did not have any.  Did not put in the potato.  I added about 3 tsp. "Better than Bouillon" chicken base.  Oh, and I added 1 bay leaf.  DELICIOUS!

My family really enjoyed this varation of split pea soup. I am a fan of marjoram so I was interested in trying it in split pea soup. I was please to say the least. I had to substitute smoked bacon in place of the ham bone. I cooked the bacon with onions just until the bacon was slightly crisp and the onions began to carmalize. I believe that added a great smoky sweet flavor to the soup. My son loves split pea soup. He often eats the condensed canned version, and was like, "Mom, this is way better than canned soup. Make this kind from now on."

Very good for first attempt at split pea soup. I will definately do this again. The only difference is that I added one bay leaf as I normally do with all my soups, and used college inn chicken broth instead of water.

This was really good soup. I used the "fast" way to make the peas. 
I cut up leftover Christmas ham instead of using a ham bone. I also added some ground Cumin to it. It dried out a bit towards the end so I just added more water to it. 
I might try the chicken broth idea that someone else suggested when I make it again, it sounds good.

Excellent! I pureed the soup after i took the ham out and it made it nice and smooth then added the diced ham. Also I noticed that the soup tasted 100times better the second day! Thank you for this recipe.

This is a great soup!  I had a Honey Baked Ham bone left over from Christmas.  The only changes I made were that I only used only 1 onion, used chicken broth and omitted the potato.  If you like a runnier soup, don't add the potato, if you like a thicker soup, use the potato.   Got many compliments on this soup. Will definitely make this again.

I have used this recipe long ago and cannot remember if I rated.  This is a great recipe it is actually exactly the way mom made her soup (and the spoon could stand up in her soup!).  My teenage son had 2 friends over and they kind of turned their noses up to what I was making but sat down and tried it and now asks my son when I am making it again.

This is the first time my split pea soup has gone over well! Great recipe! I didn't have marjaram; instead used fresh sage, rosemary and thyme. I used all chicken stock vs. water. I wasn't sure about the potato- but got crazy and threw it in; it did not dissappoint! will certainly make again!

This is the best, and I've used a few pea soup recipes over the years. I drained off the soak water after bringing peas to a boil and skimming off foam, to reduce gassy effects. Then I used my own stock, not bothering to measure, just adding more as needed. And I blended all when soup was done, but it would have been fine without blending, too.

My mother-in-law made split pea soup for my husband while he was growing up, so he wanted me to try and make it. He LOVED this soup. I wasn't crazy about it, but I don't think it had anything to do with the recipe--I think I just don't care for split pea soup.

This soup is very good.  Like other reviews I did not soak the peas.  I made a cottage roll and saved the water, after it cooled I removed the fat and added chicken broth to make the total amount of liquid.  I used more than 2 quarts though.  I guess how thick it is depends on how fast the soup is boiling and evaporating.  I did not add any salt but added some of the ham chopped up from the cottage roll.  This is a very comforting and filling soup.

I made this recipe at Christmas with great success, and was nearly in a panic when I thought I couldn't find it again.  Very satisfying, nice flavors.  Makes a great "2nd day" kind of meal over the holidays after serving the ham more formally.

Excellent soup! I didn't have any potatoes, but I'm not used to split pea soup having potatoes anyway, so we didn't miss them. This was a very hearty and warming soup - perfect for a cold winter's day. :o)

This was my first time preparing and trying split pea soup.  It was wonderful!  My husband and 16 month old boys loved it.  It made enough for us and I even brought some to the neighbors.  It did thicken up quite a bit towards the end of the cooking time.  The left overs required a small amount of water to thin it out.  Thanks for a good soup recipe.

Great recipe. This soup was very tasty. I made it exactly as stated and it turned out runny the first day, but thickened up considerably by the next day.

This soup was delicious! My 12 and 14 year olds, my husband, and myself all loved it. I've never had pea soup before but this is a great way to make veggies taste great. I didn't have celery and had no ham bone, so I didn't use those. I did have lots of left over ham in the freezer, tho, and I used lots of it. A really good soup!

Great recipe, especially good to make after the Thanksgiving Ham leftover of the ham hock. I added garlic powder and smashed about  1/2 of the potaotes to thicken the soup. My husband couldn't get enough!!

Pea soup is not one of my favourite soups, but my husband loves it.  I made it without tasting it, so was going by the seat of my pants when I served it.  It was excellent.  I actually had a full bowl.

This was very good, I made a few changes to suit our tastes. I added bay leaf, more salt and pepper, and I used red potatoes with the skins on. Tasty and easy, I served with warm French bread. Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe is quite easy and very tasty.  The consistency was thin, but may be due to keeping covered (in error) during cooking.  Thank you Sandra!

Great recipe!  My husband likes it very thick, so I let it simmer a bit longer to boil out the water, but other than that, made exactly as written.  Thank you!
