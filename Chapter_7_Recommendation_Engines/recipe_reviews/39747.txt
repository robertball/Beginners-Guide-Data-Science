My Dad made this for us all the time while growing up. This is a great recipe. The only thing that he would do different was to brown the meat first and then add the eggs and then the cheese. Thanks for the post.

Being someone from Hawaii, I've made this before and it's quite yummy! As someone mentioned before, it's nice to fry the spam until brown then toss in. =) But good either way =)

Have been eating spam and eggs for years.  People from Alaska and Hawaii eat the most spam than anywhere else in America (ak. here).  I toss in half a sliced green onion or some mushrooms for a change of taste.  And instead of stirring in the eggs, just make yourself a Spam omlet.

My grandma, bless her heart, seems to think that my husband loves Spam. Not so much. So, whenever we go visit, we get a can or two. Not wanting it to go to waste, I made this for my boys' breakfast because they will eat just about anything with eggs. I did make one change and only use half of the container. I did fry the Spam in a bit of bacon grease, then removed it and added the eggs. They inhaled it. No wasted Spam!

I was feeling a bit hungry for a quick snack, and landed on this recipe. Man, am I glad I did! Though I did not follow the recipe completely, I was inspired by it by adding caramelized onions and mushrooms to the dish. Thank you for filling up an otherwise hungry day!

We ate this all the time growing up except we would fry the spam first until it's a little crisp then add in the eggs.  It's great in flour tortillas with some cheese. Like a breakfast burrito!

I admit it - I like Spam.  This was pretty good, though it just tasted like Spam more than anything.  These were big servings, so I thought perhaps it might be more appropriate to just make it 4 eggs, since the egg-to-Spam ratio was pretty low, then it could probably be 4 servings.

Wow, this is a keeper. The spam and eggs dish is tasty. Our family gobbled the whole dish down. I also added some teriyaki sauce for flavor. My family just made up this recipe so when we found out that all recipes had this recipe we wanted to review it.

This is a delicious recipe. If you want something a bit lighter I suggest omitting the cheese and using the following recipe:
For 1 can of Spam, finely dice into a medium pan with a couple tbsp of oil over medium heat. Add 1/2 cup of diced onion of choice (I prefer red) and cook until Spam is browned and crispy. Crack 6 eggs into pan and throw in 2 fist-fulls of  baby spinach, cooking until spinach is wilted. Add black pepper a vinegary hot sauce like Frank's or Tobasco to taste.

Really good.  I cooked the spam first (it doesn't need any extra oil for this recipe because the spam has plenty) until it was browned then I added 6 eggs that someone else suggested.  If you use two, it is going to be mainly spam.  It is a little more balanced with 6.  It was surprisingly good though:)

This was delicious only thing i changed was i added half and half to my eggs first. I find it makes the eggs more fluffy.

That's a lot of spam for just 2 servings. I would decrease the spam, increase to 4 eggs. Fry the spam a bit first (just until browned) before adding the eggs. Ate this all of the time as a kid. It's great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. My mom likes hers with onions.

This tasted good but, from a nutrition standpoint, I think I will stick with diced ham. Less fat and sodium.

It's easy to make and is good. Cooking it this way you can't taste how salty the spam is.
