I had a touch of Tangueray (but not Ten)left in my stash, and I looked for a new way to use it--other than on the rocks or with tonic.  I mixed this up with only about 1/4 of the teaspoon of the sugar--otherwise, as the recipe states.  It was really very good.  You wouldn't want to have too many of these because they are sweet, but it did hit the spot!  Now I'll have to look to see what Ten is all about!  Woops!  I meant Tanqueray!
