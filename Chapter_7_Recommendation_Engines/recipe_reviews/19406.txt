Delicious! I made this dinner 3x in the past two weeks I enjoyed it so much. The flavors in this dish come together very nicely. I added a bit more cabbage and ommited the ginger. One of the best recipes I have tried so far!

This was really good, however, I had to make some changes to fit my taste. I added seasme oil and soy sauce to the blender. I also heated up the sauce and then mixed it togethor with the grilled shrimp and noodles. Couldn't find rice noodles, so i settled for linguine. I also added red cabbage, carrots, and mushrooms. Sprinked with fresh green onions when done, and then I had a meal!

We've made this twice now and have really enjoyed it.  The second time was for company.  I like more cabbage so we doubled the quantity.  It even tasted good the next day cold right out of the fridge.  If you like the "fresh" taste of mint and cilantro you will enjoy this recipe.

I had to try this because it had some of my all time favorite things in it (shrimp, cilantro, ginger and honey!)

I've never cooked with mint (only used it for tea) but really, it does add a special touch to this recipe!   And the only thing I had to do different than the shown recipe here, was to add MORE shrimp!   (You know how fast shrimp can go!)   Very elegant and delicious Larry!

I think it would have been alot better without the fish sauce.  Vegetable broth would make it a nice soup.

I love Thai food and cabbage.  So I thought this recipe had great flavors.  It was very light.  I found it very easy to prepare.  I will, however, make some extra sauce.

Yummy! My kids gobbled it up - sauce and all. Very fresh and easy. Great flavors for an American kitchen :). Make recipe exactly as says - except what are you supposed to do with the ginger? I added it to the sauce and that worked out!

I made this according to the recipe except I added quite a few more shrimp. The sauce was very good - tasted just like Thai Spring rolls. My noodles were very overdone, though, which ruined the rest of it. The noodle package said to soak them in hot (not boiling) water.  I then cooked them as the recipe said. I assume I was supposed to only do one or the other. I will make this again but not cook the noodles.

YUMMY!! I only used one clove of garlic, and I omitted the ginger. I used romaine lettuce. This is great for summer.

I added way more shrimp and extra dressing. It was hard to mix the dressing and noodles, definitely add dressing over individual bowls

This was absolutely delicious! I used nappa cabbage. Also the ingredient list has 2 Tbsp grated fresh ginger, however the instructions don't indicate where that goes. Judging from where it is listed I assume it is to go in the sauce. I did not realize this until after making the sauce, so I added about 1/2 tsp powdered ginger. This is a delicious recipe! Next time I will add the fresh ginger into the sauce...but it is hard to imagine it tasting any better!

Oh yea :) This was great. My whole family really liked it. I was surprised too. I made this as an accompaniment to lemon sawgrass beef and it was great. Very unique in flavor. Enjoyed it. Thanks.

This had an authentic asian taste, with the fish sauce in it.  It was a little strong for me.  I did double the sauce, which was a good amount, but next time I'd double all the sauce ingredients except the fish sauce.

Amazing! Had all of the ingredients on hand.  I may have added too many noodles (I didn't have them in the original packaging) because I didn't have any liquid in my dish as the photo shows but this was wonderful! Added some extra cabbage and shrimp, will definitely make this again!

I thought this was awful. Ate 3 bites and placed the entire meal in the disposal.  The sauce smelled great but lost something once it was all put together.  Spouse agreed with me and he never complains. Must be a matter of personal taste.

We really enjoyed this recipe, tangy and sweet, a pleasant surprise. I would make a littel more of the sauce then it calls for. I used wide rice noodles, but ay size would be great. Thanks!

I'm not rating this because I did not follow the recipe very closely, but wanted to add my thoughts.  I omitted the mint, but otherwise made the sauce as listed (added about 1 t ginger b/c I wasn't sure about that).  I served soba (buckwheat) noodles, crisp-tender broccoli and carrots, and cooked shrimp; I let everyone top the noodles with the veggies and shrimp as desired and then put the sauce on top of that.  Yum, yum, yum.  Fresh, tasty, unique, and healthy.  Oh, and also quick.

This is definitely unique for my tastebuds!  My husband and I loved it.  I used carrots and broccoli instead of cabbage.  I'm sure it's even better with cabbage.  Took no time to make.  Thanks for sharing!

We weren't big fans of this dish I'm afraid.  I altered the recipe slightly by adding 1 Tbsp of Tamari and reducing the fish sauce to 2 Tbsp. I also sauteed the cabbage instead of boiling it.  In the end, we just didn't care for it, but it's only personal preference.

This tastes exactly as it should- fresh, light, and zingy. Thanks for the quick and authentic-tasting Asian recipe that my guests loved, and so did I! Try sprinkling 1 tbs. toasted black or white sesame seeds over the top for added texture.

I really like Vietnamese food, and I was really looking forward to this dish, but I did not enjoy it at all.  The first bite or two were okay, but I couldn't eat much more than that.  We picked the shrimp out, at those, and threw the rest out.  Sorry.. not too good.

This was ok, but probably not something I would make again. Too much noodles and not enough shrimp. The dressing was also not quite right, but that was probably my fault as I was throwing it together quickly and I think I may have put a bit much honey in it which tipped the balance.

My (picky) husband rated this a 9 out of 10, my 11 yr. old who is usually not picky asked me to refrain from making it again.  I thought it was very good and quick which is especially important on a hot night.  It is definitely too hot to be in the kitchen long and I wasn't with this recipe.  I did make a few changes: lightly brushed the shrimp with the dressing before grilling, grated the ginger on my Zyliss before adding to the sauce and did not boil the cabbage. (Boiled cabbage?-blech.)  After I drained the noodles, I put them over the shredded cabbage then topped with the grilled shrimp, then topped with shredded carrots and chopped sugar snap peas.  Really delicious and healthy.  I do have to say that the ginger made the dressing.  Those who thought it was blah may not have added the ginger.

This bowl was very unique, quite a different flavoring. My family enjoyed it very much.
