Nice way to change up the plain ol' brown bag lunches. The insides of the "rolls" can be changed out easily so you can make a different "roll" every day. My sons love it with peanut butter and marshmallow creme and peanut butter and honey with raisins.

Can also zap them in the microwave for a few seconds to melt the butter.  Makes them just a litte sloppy.

Awesome! What a great idea! I folded over the buttered bread and then cut down the middle. Super easy!
I also used toothpicks to hold them together and then toasted in the oven for five minutes.

As far as quick, easy "apitizers" go...awesome. 
Kids absolutly loved them and after I rolled them up, I put toothpicks through to avoid sticky fingers and it worked perfect. 
Definitly our new Fun Friday night regular.

To hold them together, i inserted toothpicks lengthwise until it was time to eat them. You can also roll out and prepare the cut-off pieces of crust in the same manner. They're not as pretty, but taste just as yummy-and nothing goes to waste :)

A nice change up from cinnamon toast. Easy and fun for the kids to make. I used a lot less of the butter, cinnamon sugar and confectioner's sugar, more like 2 teaspoons of each instead of tablespoons. Would be good with cream cheese also.

This was such an amazing snack! I made 3 batches and they were amazing! One thing I found was that they were very small. It might of just been that I used whole wheat bread instead (healthy!) so it didn't roll out as much? I don't know. But they were delicious!

Tastes nothing like a cinnamon roll, just like buttery bread. Also it was soggy. Even my three year old cousin didn't like it.

We made these for a cooking class in a kindergarten class and it was a big hit.  The kids did the steps themselves, except I premade the icing to save some time.  They even wanted seconds!

Great taste! Butter flavor was prominent, put simply adding less butter can fix that problem! Icing was really rich, so you don't need that much! Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.

I substituted cream cheese for the butter and my son loves the cinnamon/sugar with it.  We also went with cream cheese/peanut butter or nutella.  great substitute for PB&J sandwich esp. if bread if a few days old.  Thanks

The taste was great but they were kind of hard to keep together! Although when you make them I suggest not to use wheat bread  it really takes the taste away but if you have hamburger buns those work great to and they still taste good without the frosting

Such a quick and easy fix for the sudden cinnamon cravings. I had a bit of difficulty rolling the flattened bread, so they didn't look anything like the one on the photo. I used butter-flavored shortening, since I ran out of butter, but they still tasted great.

These were great!They were a neat twist on the regular bread-butter-n -sugar we sometimes have. All my brothers and sisters loved them, but my mom probably liked them better than anyone:) We used whole wheat bread because that was all we had. Ours didn't turn out very pretty, but they were fun to make. Thanks for this great idea!!

Cool idea but we changed it up to add a little nutritional value. Whole wheat bread and strawberry cream cheese. Way better than white bread and sugar!

if you are having trouble trying to get them to stick together them first put them on there side then put the icing on the. them put a tooth pick through it.
or you can put a little bit of icing on the bread after you put the butter on. it is easier to put it all the way to the end of the roll.

A fun spur-of-the-moment snack for kids that takes very little effort. My grandchildren had had cinnamon rolls before, but they were impressed with Granna's cute little bread cinnamon rolls.

I made it with wheat bread and it came out great. My older brother even likes them.

These were perfect for what I needed them for! They made a great spur of the moment treat! My only problem is that when I heat them up in the microwave they fall apart but  really don't care because I'm not bringing theses any where or anything like that. Thank you for a wonderful recipe! Defiantly will put this in my recipe box!
