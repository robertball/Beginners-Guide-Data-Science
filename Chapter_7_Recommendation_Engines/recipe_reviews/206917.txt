Tried this tonight with a little beef tenderloin. Turned out well and will make again. Using what I had on hand. I thinly sliced, floured and browned the meat in unsalted butter. Forgot the bay leaf and thyme but did add fresh garlic.

What a cinch! I love having a savoury way to use up cream cheese. I've successfully used this recipe with chicken thighs, too. Tastes great. I add much more thyme than called for.

This recipe was pretty good when I made some changes.  I prepared it as written (well, I used canned mushrooms instead  fresh, but other than that, I followed it) and it was very bland, so I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and some creole seasoning.  With the seasoning, it was flavorful and delicious.  There were no leftovers in my house!

Oh this was very very good. I didn't have beef broth though, but I did have a beef gravy. So I made it with that. YUM!

This was easy and delicious, even without the fresh parsley. After browning mushrooms and onions, i deglazed the pan with some white wine. i didn't have egg noodles on hand so subbed fettuccine, broken in half before cooking. Would be delicious with tenderloin, but I used tougher cut so added more broth and simmered til tender

My family couldn't believe I cooked this on my own last night. I impressed even myself. Was very good with the added red peppers (suggested from comments) will make again

Delicious, I substituted stewing beef because that's what I had available. I also added a small amount of white wine to it and it tasted great. My boyfriend loved it, and we had a restaurant quality meal on the cheap. Thanks for the great recipe

The beef broth made the recipe too thin, I am used a thicker beef stroganoff. But the taste was good even if it was more like creamy beef soup. I would suggest using half a can of beef broth instead of a full can. It was a little different having to take out the beef after cooking it in order to finish the recipe and then adding it back in at the end.

Excellent! It was bland until I added some kitchen bouquet and a little salt and pepper. I used leftover pot roast and it turned out beautifully.

Used what I had on hand - 2 cans canned beef with juice, dry onion soup mix- also added cream of mushroom soup (2 cans). Added extra broth to make more soup like ( whole 32 oz. carton) and served with bisquick biscuits.

A passable basic recipe if you use sour cream instead of the cream cheese spread (it is a Kraft recipe).  Cooking the steak before slicing is odd.  I would skip the thyme, use dill and paprika.
