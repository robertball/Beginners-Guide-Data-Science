I have made these numerous times and each time I do, I love them more.  Instead of putting in just hamburger, I brown a pound of Jimmy Dean Smokehouse sausage.  Makes it marvelous!  Also, I drain a couple of cans of those beans, otherwise they are really soupy.

Extremely excellent! Very hot/spicy and wonderful flavor. I used Louisianna hot sauce instead of Tabasco and baked mine in the oven instead of crock pot. I don't like crock pots much, everything comes out wet and floating in liquid. I put them in a big baking pan and baked them at 350º for about an hour. It worked great. I prefer baked beans to be thick, not swimming in juice. I used two 32 ounce cans of Van Camps regular pork and beans and drained the excess juice off the top of the cans. I used pork sausage instead of hamburger and it was so good. I cooked the onions with the sausage when I browned it. Fantastic baked beans!

I LOVED these beans!  They were a big hit at a cookout we had, as they have a nice mix of spicy and sweet.  As a conoissuer of spicy food, I couldn't get enough.  I followed the recipe to a tee, but per other user recommendation, used Jimmy Dean sausage instead of the ground beef.  YUM!

These are good.  After reading the reviews I whisk 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with some bean juice because I wanted a semi-thick juice.  Also I added another can or green chili’s, and since my barbeque sauce was already sweet, I only added about a tablespoon of brown sugar.

This is absolutely the best recipe for baked beans I have ever tried.  I take them to an annual pig roast on Canada Day every year and almost everyone wants the recipe.  I prefer with with no meat added and the lack of meat does not change the flavour one bit.

I have looked for a great recipe for baked beans for 30 years...this is it folks!!!  I will NEVER use a different recipe again. Like others, I substituted Hot Jimmy Dean sausage for the hamburger meat and left out the Tobasco altogether (as I was taking it to a church pot-luck where there were lots of kids).  I have never had so many requests for a recipe before. This is incredible!

Yummy! But..cain't be Texan with Boston-style baked beans. We cook our own pinto beans, but if you must used the canned stuff, please get pinto beans.

I have made this several times now and it is always a huge hit. Instead of ground beef I use about a 1/2 pound Jalapeno flavored sausage that I brown first in the skillet and about a 1/2 pound of bacon that I also precook just a little bit. I usually will just use a yellow onion because that is what I usually have on had. I found the key to this recipe is the BBQ sauce - you must use a good sauce, the beans depend on it, my husband and I really like Sweet Baby Rays.

Boy these were delicious!  I only used 1/2 lb. of sage sausage because I wanted the meat to be in the "background" in this dish.  I also sauteed the onions in the sausage pan before I added them to the crock pot. I will make these again and again.

Not too hot, not too sweet. I only used 1/2 the bbq called for as I didn't want the bbq sauce to overpower the beans. I also used 2 tbl of sriracha instead of the hot sauce. Very good!

I'm giving this 4 stars because the flavor was good, but just wanted to warn others that it is very spicy!  I only used 1 Tbsp of Tabasco because 3 sounded like a lot, and it was still a little too much.  Husband liked it, but kept saying "wow, spicy!" and 8 yr old daughter couldn't eat it.  My sons ate it, but next time, I would try maybe 1 or 1.5 teaspoons of Tabasco and let people add more as they like.  So thumbs up for the basic recipe, but use caution with the Tabasco unless you're a flame-eater!

Yummy! These beans are the bomb! I was wanting a spicy baked bean recipe and stumbled upon this one. I loved that the recipe went in the crock pot so I didn't have to heat up my kitchen. A definate plus when you live in Texas and it is summer! I used plain canned pinto beans rather than the baked beans and omited the meat altogether. I did not want meat in it, as I was serving it as a side dish and having meat as an entree. I used hot barbrque sauce as it was what I had on hand. We absolutely loved these beans! Perfect amount of heat for us and the flavor was great! A definate keeper...thanks scrubbie1!

I use one can each of baked bean, black beans, pinto beans, and lima beans.  This is great, and brings a "chuckwagon" taste to mind.  Definitely go "low and slow" if time permits.

Used Bush's Grillin' Beans and made exactly as written except for using only 1 Tbls of Tabasco.  Excellent.  Use a good quality bbq sauce, it makes a difference.

Really good!  I doubled the recipe and followed the advice of other reviewers - I did 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 jimmy dean original breakfast sausage (couldn't find the recommended brand); sauteed the onions; used Frank's instead of tabasco; baked in a single dish in a 350 oven for 2 hours the day.  Served the next day - nuked in the crockpot insert and served in the crockpot.  I am not a great baked beans fan, but these drew rave reviews from my hungry 4th of july crowd.  Thanks Scrubbie1 for the richly-flavored beans

I have made these a couple times now and everywhere I take them they are a huge hit!! The only thing different I use is Jone's hot sausage (in the tube) and also add a chopped fresh jalepeno. Fry in a skillet with the onions. Everything else I left as recipe stated. Oh I do recommend draining 1-2 cans of beans otherwise it is too soupy. Yummy!

Very spicy!  I would suggest cooking your chopped onions before adding them to the slow-cooker, lightly draining 2-3 cans of the pork and beans, and increasing the amount of ground beef.

Excellent! I used Frank's Hot Sauce. Tabasco might be a little too warm with that quantity. The aroma when I opened the slow cooker got everyones attention.

These are best baked beans I have ever eaten and so very easy to prepare. They received rave reviews from my guests. I used my homemade Italian sausage instead of hamburger. So great because I didn't have to turn on the oven.

I made this recipe to go along with brisket and pulled pork sandwiches for my brother's 40th bday party.  It was a huge hit! I didn't put in any meat, and added a tsp. or two of cumin, which added a really nice flavour.  When choosing your BBQ sauce, try to get one with a smokiness to it...SO good! I also used one jalapeno instead of green chiles.

These were a little on the spicy side and a little less sweet than I like, but my husband loved them. Per other suggestions, I used pork sausage rather than ground beef for additional flavor.

I recently made these beans to go with ribs.  Like other reviewers I substituted sausage for the ground beef.  I used 3 cans of heinz brown beans (drained the liquid from 2 of the cans) and a can of mixed bean medley.  I think next time I would use two cans of each.  I used Franks Red Hot sauce.  I also added very little of the brown sugar because I don't think the recipe needed it.  Rave reviews from our company - my friend asked for the recipe and she said she doesn't usually like beans.  The beans had good flavour and texture and just the right amount of heat.

I've made this several times and love it! I don't bother with the crock pot, just whip it up on the stove.  Remember to drain the beans because the BBQ sauce gives it the liquid, and I also skip the brown sugar.  Just put a "spicy" note by it at a picnic and kids are then warned, but the men seem to go for it - you will have no leftovers!

I did this in a slow cooker to be part of our Fish Fry Party Menu we had for a friend.  Was a big hit and the leftovers the next day went over baked potatoes with some shredded cheddar & sour cream for supper.

An excellent and delicious supper!  I didn't have chile peppers, so I used sliced jalapenos in a jar, and half a pound each of ground beef and Jimmy Dean sausage.  It was just spicy enough for us- I served Baked Hot Dog Sandwiches, also on this site, with the beans - a meat-lover's supper for sure!

I threw this recipe together quickly without any meat, except some bacon bits and it turned out fabulous.  My husband and brother in-law loved it with their burgers. They are starting to think that after 15 years of marriage I can actually cook! Great easy slow cooker recipe!

Made this today instead of the plain ole beans and it was delicious and a huge hit! After reading the reviews I used sweet italian sausage instead of the hamburger and it was great. I'm not usually a bean eater but, I really enjoyed these!

I made this yesterday for a work pot-luck and it got rave reviews!  I used hot and spicy BBQ sauce and only 2T of Tabasco, plus the sausage that others had recommended.  I also drained the liquid off the top of the cans of beans and the consistency was great.

Wow, were these good!!  Used 1 lb. sausage as I was suggested in the reviews and a 1/2 can of green chilis per guests tastes.  I was very concerned they would be to spicey for a particular guests, but he loved them.  I too have never been a big baked bean fan, but I'm now converted!!  The recipe was easy to follow and the taste is supreme!

Delicious, and I don't even like beans.  I did use sausage instead of ground beef and served it at a cookout.  The guests LOVED it.  I didn't even have any leftovers.

Loved them…as suggested I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage instead of ground beef.  I also used a variety of beans…black, pinto, navy and red kidney instead of pork n beans.  Other than those alterations..followed the recipe.  Thank you!  Will make again and again.

Family loved this dish and really love it after I made a few modifications.  As Paula Dean says make the dish as directed first and then make it your own.  The modifications I made:  I used 1 pound medium spicy sauage, and Bush's Texas Ranchero Grillin Beans.  I also drained two cans of beans, my family prefers a thicker sauce.

tastes great! I only added half the chiles (too spicy for my toddler) and used 3 cans of beans though because 4 cans is enough to feed a small army.

My family loves these beans. It's a great side dish but my family loves it as a meal with some cornbread. Instead of ground beef, I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage. I also halved the brown sugar. I used a can of rotel and did not use the pepper sauce. This is definitely a great winter weather dish. Thanks!

Doubled the recipe as is without any substitutions; they were a BIG hit for my nephews graduation party.  I gave him a couple of recipes to selection from and he chose this one and wasn't disappointed.  I'm sure next get together I'll get a request to bring the beans. FYI - doubled this filled to the top a 7 quart slow cooker.  I borrowed by neighbors Hamilton Beach 6-Quart Stay or Go Slow Cooker which has a lockdown lid to prevent spills and built in handles for carrying.  I've put one on my Christmas list.

I've been making these beans since I found the recipes a couple years ago.  The ONLY thing I change is adding bacon.  I fry it until just done then rip in pieces and toss in crockpot.  I've found that sometimes it's watery and sometimes not, so draining atleast 1 can of the beans would be a good idea.  Always asked to make these for picnics...extremely easy!

My whole family loves these beans!! (And we are not really 'bean people'.)  I do use pork sausage instead of hamburger, but other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.  I have taken it to a Cowboys football party and everyone LOVES!!

These were great - my 8 year old step-son loved them!  I made exactly as described though I only added 2 tblsp of Tabasco (it still had a nice kick) and I did drain some of the bean liquid.  Yum!

Not bad!  Used a honey/smoke BBQ sauce (already in the pantry)and I think I should have decreased the brown sugar to compensate.  A little sweeter than I'd like, but I DID like the slight smokey flavor.  Maybe regular BBQ sauce, keep the sugar and add some liquid smoke?  I'll try again!

I made this recipe today for an Easter dinner with a ham.  It was a huge hit!  Everybody just raved about the beans.  Went straight by the instructions, (used Frank's Hot "wing" sauce).  I had several ask for the recipe.  Thanks' for sharing... this is a great one!!

Fail for using canned beans. I was hoping for a homemade recipe that did not have all the  in it that canned baked beans have in them....especially the sodium. And here I am looking at a recipe that is based on those beans. Might as well save yourself some time and buy the ones in the store.......no benefit here except customization.

I didn't have green chiles but added green pepper.  The beans in my cupboard weren't the ones with pork, so I added a bit of bacon fat to the ground beef as it was frying.  I ended up making the BEST baked beans I've ever had! Thank you for the recipe....although I had to tweak it a bit to suit what I had in my kitchen.

I love this recipe as do all of my coworkers that I have made it for.  The only changes I've made are adding more meat in the form of uncased Italian sausage and small chunks of bacon from a few diced up slices, aside from that I mix one spicy and one regular bbq sauce and they come out great.  The flavor is great and these beans are top notch!!!

These were a HUGE hit at my cookout!!!!  Everyone loved them and was wondering how I made them.  DELICIOUS!!!!  I didn't make them spicy though so I omitted the tobacco/hot sauce & peppers.

Very very good. I found this at the last minute so I had to make some subtitutions to complete it. I only had 2 cans of pork and beans so I used those undrained and 2 cans of dark red kidney beans drained and rinsed. I also used a pound of chorizo because I needed to get it out of the freezer. I let everything cook in the slow cooker for the day. Super good and super easy. Will be making these again.

Made exactly as written...(don't believe in reviewing recipes that are changed from the original!!).  We absolutely loved them and will never make any other recipe again.  Only thing I will do next time is cook my own beans!!  Thanks scrubbie1.

I've made this bean recipe.   And I love hot spicy stuff.  But if you really want to bring out the flavor of a "chile".  You need to roast them.   Get some Poblano chiles, wash 'em and roast them over an open gas flame (not inside the house).   They aren't very hot but will add an incredible flavor to this recipe.

Crowd pleaser!  I have made a modified version of this recipe three times to take to cook outs.  Each time, there are no leftovers at all and multiple compliments. 

The changes:  My version uses mild country sausage instead of hamburger.  

Instead of a whole cup of BBQ sauce, I used 3/4 cup of Sweet Baby Rays sauce.  That was all I had in the fridge the first time I made this recipe.  Then I added 1/4 cup of ketchup to make up the difference.  

I substituted Texas Pete hot sauce. (It's a local favorite, similar to Frank's and not nearly as hot as Tobasco sauce.)  And I drained most of the juice from the cans of beans.  

Also, instead of using the crock pot, I cooked these in a large foil pan in the oven with some bacon pieces cut up on top.  350 for about an hour. 

This recipe is a keeper.  The chilies, the spices, and BBQ sauce really set these baked beans apart from any other I've had.  Not too sweet either.

Just made this recipe today!  Absolutely delicious but did make a few changes.  First thing to mention...I almost doubled the recipe and used half the tobacco & it still has kick!  Beware, 3 tablespoons could light you up if you're not a spice person!  I wanted to make a large crockpot full, so used 6 cans of beans, drained off top juices in 2-3 of them.  Wanted more meat, so cooked 1 pound of jimmy dean regular sausage, 1 pound of 90% lean hamburger, and cooked 2 chopped onions in with meat.  Put 2 cans of green chiles in.  added extra 1/2 tblsp of chili powder & garlic powder.  I did not double the bbq sauce, I only added maybe 1-2 extra tablespoons, and no extra brown sugar.   Lastly added maybe 1 tablespoon of worschesthire.   If you really like your beans sweet, go for the extra sugar, but I don't.  I thought they were plenty sweet.  I love that the bbq flavor doesn't dominate this dish, have been looking for a baked bean dish that isn't your typical ketchup brown sugar mustard dish, wanted something less sweet, more meat.   LOVE IT!  I'm sure it will be a big hit!

Tried the recipe as written and really liked it.  The next time I made the beans I substituted some hickory smoked brisket for the ground beef. It was so good, that I have made it several more times.

I'm not a big fan of baked beans, but this receipe was more like a chili beans/baked beans so I think it came out pretty good.  My family loved them and requested for me to bring them to the next gathering.  So I guess its a winner!  I bought bush's original baked beans and omitted the brown sugar since they were already sweet and it avoided that gross oversweetness I can't stand! I think next time I will try the sausage version.

I used the Jimmy Dean hot sausage and followed the rest of the recipe as is (including draining two cans of beans).   These beans were very good, but I ended up adding more BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Rays hickory and brown sugar) and Franks hot sauce at the end.  I will make tthese again!!

I agree with the others, replace the ground beef with sausage.  Also, trade 2 of the cans of pork and beans with great northen or pinto beans (really any kind you like).  They're colorful and not so soupy this way.

Really tasty!  My guests really liked these beans.  Two of my kids liked it, too and they normally don't like baked beans.  I do recommend draining two of the bans of beans first so it will be thicker.  Planning to make again this week for a pot-luck.

For our palate they were a little sweet and not quite spicy enough.  We will make them again with a tweak or two for sure.  I used half the meat called for and thought it was the perfect amount for a side dish, or could leave it out and not miss for a side too.

Took them to a cookout and people loved them, I did leave out the Tabasco since I was not sure how spicy other people like their food, and added a little yellow mustard and some worchestershire sauce.  People ask for the recipe.

My family and I absolutely loved these!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added Jimmy Deans sausage instead of ground beef and I also cooked the onions with the sausage before adding to the beans but that's the only changes I made.  These were delicious and really easy to make in my slow cooker I don't know why I didn't try these sooner!!

Will make again but will halve the amount of meat and change kidney beans to ranch style for more body.

I absolutely loved this.  Although,  I didn't totally make it as written, I have confidence that it would be awesome as is. I had to modify it based on the kids taste buds. I didn't use green chilis - the kids don't do spicy food very well, so I added a little green pepper instead. But I can only imagine how good the chilis would be if added.  Also, I think the sugar amount is fine, however,  I will reduce it next time for my family, it was just unnecessarily sweet.  And because we are wimps when it comes to heavy seasoning, for half the recipe, I used about 2 tbsp onion, 3 tbsp green pepper, sprinkled some chili powder, 1 tsp garlic powder and no hot sauce. :-)

After writing this, I guess I really changed the recipe...but nonetheless,  it was awesome inspiration.

Our go to baked beans for good old camping BBQs. Everyone loves this recipe. We don’t change a thing. Why fix something that isn’t broke.

Being born and mostly raised in Texas, I couldn't resist this recipe. I now live in BC Canada and made it for a church potluck today. I rated this recipe five stars, because  a lady asked for the recipe , I will refer her to this site.  I did omit the three  tablespoons of hot sauce altogether. I used yellow onions instead of Vidalia, as my store does not carry Vidalia. Nothing more was changed. Had about 2 tablespoons left over to bring home.

Absolutely delicious! I made the recipe as written, but cut in half, as I didn't need beans for a week. I got rave reviews from multiple guests. Consider this a new favorite.

Great crowd pleaser!  Good as is but really like it using a mixture of ground beef and ground Italian sausage.  If I have them on hand I will often add other beans to the mix - i.e., butter beans, kidney beans, black beans...

I sautéed the onion in with the beef.  I only added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and used Stubs spicy BBQ sauce.  We like things spicy around here.  It was quick, easy and delicious!

Made the recipe exactly as written. I used 2 tbsp sriracha sauce. I was a little reluctant to use 3 tbsp hot sauce. Came out great. Great balance of heat and sweet. Would not feed it to young children due to the heat level. This would be great for a BBQ or tailgate.

I made this for a family outing and there were no left overs, as everyone raved over this recipe. I decreased the heat a bit, since some don't like full heat, and added a bit of cumin. I also used Texas Pete, a local thing for us. Great recipe with many ways to tailor it to your liking. Thanks for sharing.

This was a huge hit! The only changes I made was to use jimmy dean sausage instead of hamburger meat and I used 5 cans (15 oz each) of van camps pork and beans, draining all but 2. The hot sauce I used was Crystal brand. Absolutely wonderful! I will definitely make again!

I will never make another baked bean recipe or buy store made ones again. This was delicious.
I made a couple changes based on reviews. I bought 3 28oz cans of pork and beans. I only used 2 full cans and maybe about 8oz out of the 3rd (I couldn't find smaller cans). I drained one can completely. Then I used sweet Italian ground sausage (I had it in my freezer from accidentally buying it thinking it was links and not looking, doh!). Used 2 cans of chopped green chiles (I drained them a little) and sautéed the onion. I omitted the garlic powder because I just didn't have it, and I used franks red hot sauce instead of tobasco. I also use sweet baby rays bbq sauce. These came out so good. It wasn't runny at all either. Definitely will be keeping this recipe

These beans are amazing.  Always my go to recipe and they get rave reviews from everyone that tries them.  Based on other suggestions I use a tube of hot breakfast sausage instead of the ground beef (best success with Tennessee Pride) and Sticky Fingers Carolina Sweet BBQ sauce.  I do not ever add the hot pepper sauce because I don't want them too hot.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe is very good. The only reason for me not giving the 5 stars is that I think is a little too sweet for my taste. I also had unfortunately to replace the green peppers for sweet peppers as I can not eat spicy things. Same for the Tabasco sauce. As for anything else this recipe was very very good. I paired it with the Bacon Wrapped Smokies from this website as appetizer and Peach pie with Sour Cream dessert from this website too. Very good combo!

I have been making this recipe for several years now and think it is the best baked beans recipe out there.  I did follow some of the suggestions made by others and have used sausage instead of beef, double the amount of green chili and have used fresh roasted when available, and do drain at least one can of beans to prevent it from being too soupy.  I am a big fan of the Bush's Grillin Beans and have also used those a couple of times, which led to a slightly more intense flavor.  These are always a hit at family gatherings...all I can say is Yum, Yum!!!

Tried this recipe for our 4th of July cookout.  They are the bomb!  I followed the recipe too, except I did drain off the liquid from the beans and cooked them in the oven for an hour.  If you like tasty and hot, these are the best.  Will be using this recipe from now on.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  I made it for a Father's Day BBQ yesterday and it was a HIT.  Everyone loved them  My husband and I were a bit skeptical but this recipe is amazing.  I did use the sausage instead of the ground beef and I used two big cans of the Van De Kamp beans with pork. They did not have a lot of juice so the beans weren't soupy at all.

I tried using 4 different kinds of beans as a reviewer suggested.  It was excellent.  Just the right amoung of spices, a big hit!
