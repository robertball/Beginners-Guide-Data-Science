This was yummy, kinda reminded me of a fancy chicken pot pie.  I've made this twice.   The first time I followed the recipe exact and the second I did make a modification that I think lowers the calorie intake quite a bit.  Instead of butter to brush on the phyllo, I used fat free butter flavored baking/cooking spray.  The result was just as good.  It was light flaky and still had a slight butter taste to it that wasn't over powering.  PLUS it didn't look or taste greasy!  Another bonus was that it was soooo easy to spray on instead of trying to brush on.  This cut the time it took to put together considerably.

So yummy!  I made one minor change when I prepared this.  I diced the chicken before rolling the packets so we were able to eat them with forks.  We've decided that when we make these again, which we definitely will, that we might cook them on a broiler pan as they end up cooking in too much oil/butter for our taste.  They were really good though and definitely something I'll make again.  This dish is impressive enough to cook for guests.  One tip....to make spreading the butter faster, I used a rubber scraper/spatula to spread the butter instead of a basting brush.  It was faster so the phyllo sheets didn't have time to dry out while I made the packets.

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly as written and while it looked good it still tasted (my husband and I thought ) a little bland and greasy.  So the next time I made it I added 3 oz. of softened cream cheese to the mix, added 3 layers of phyllo instead of 2 and baked it on a wire rack on a cookie sheet.  Not only did my husband and I like it better but everyone raved on how good it was!! Thanks for the recipe.

This was marvelous. I made it for a Christmas day brunch and it was such a hit. Following the tips of some other users, I used butter spray on the phyllo layers instead of spreading butter. Time saver, coated beautifully, and lightened up on the greasiness. I also substituted the onions (which I don't care for) with fresh chopped dill (as per the directions of another reviewer). The combination of the dill, lemon, and mayo was so beautiful and I got endless comments. Next time, I will try cooking it on a rack to keep the phyllo from getting soggy on the bottom. In any case, this was truly delicious

This is outstanding, once you have mastered the phyllo dough, it is very easy and elegant.  I no longer try to brush the butter on, I just put the butter on a dinner-sized plate and plunge my open hands onto the butter then gently but quickly pat it all over the phyllo sheet.  Guests are very impressed.   Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I did not care for the taste of mayo. I think next time, I will try a can of cream of chicken soup or mushroom soup.

This was yummy with some changes. I used feta instead of mozzarella, and mixed it into the sauce instead of on top of the packets. Added more garlic to the sauce, and subbed half of the mayo with plain yogurt. I brushed some garlic butter on the phyllo sheets.

I used the small (9" x 14") phyllo sheets, which were the perfect size to wrap the chicken in. I used 5 or 6 sheets for each. I also added 2 ounces of cream cheese to the sauce, which someone else suggested. I thought they were delicious. My family loved them.

I make a few changes to make this a low fat recipe. I spray Pam between 3 phyllo layers. Then I spread on low fat chive and onion cream cheese. Top with a chicken breast and roll up. Spray tops with more Pam and sprinkle with parm cheese. My husband loves this recipe!

Very good!  Had to omit mayo as my guys hates cooked mayo - I used Cream of Celery Soup instead.  I also added mushrooms. This was awesome and VERY filling!

Substituted pie crust for the phyllo and fresh basil for the tarragon. Came out great and will do again.

Cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces and mixed it all together with the mayo mixture.  This made it easy to assemble the phyllo wraps.  I used spray olive oil to coat the phyllo dough.  At the suggestion of others I decreased the amount of mayo I used.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I would suggest serving with a starch because even though my fiance loved it, he was still hungry afterwards.

Really great recipe.  I added chopped, flat-leaf parsley and chopped prosciutto to the mayonnaise mixture, and I diced the chicken and tossed it all together before putting a little on each phyllo sheet. I made some with 3 sheets and others with 2, and The ones with 2 sheets were much better because the flavors came through better.  I used cooking spray between the layers, and it came out wonderfully!  Definitely did not miss the butter, though I did brush the tops with garlic butter.  Will definitely make it again!

I just had this tonight . I omitted the mayo and marinated the chicken with garlic, onion,basil, chipotle chili powder, and garam masala. Salt and pepper of course. I deep cut lengthwise into the breast and stuffed a piece of pepper jack cheese into it. I did also use three pieces of phyllo per piece and baked it on a rack. Served it with a sour cream bechemel.

Pretty presentation, lacks the all-important flavor component. Overall, easy recipe: straightforward instructions, accurate cooking temp/time, etc. I subbed in some ricotta cheese for the mayo (all mayo would have been...gross, really. especially after the fact...). While it was edible, it really lacked anything that gave it a good taste. More seasoning? Different seasoning? I may play around with again--using ricotta cheese again--needs lots of work before I serve to guests though.

I will make these again! I cut chicken into chunks and put them in the fridge with ranch dressing overnight. Mixed with garlic,onions,salt pepper. I used 3 sheets of phyllo dough instead of two. I did use Pam spray and ran out. So I used butter for the rest. I baked on a baking rack and they were not soggy or overly buttery at all. There are really a lot of variations you can do with this.

This was fabulous.  My husband and son thought it tasted excellent also... very gourmet.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, except used finely chopped cooking onions (what I had on hand)instead of green onions, and added a couple of tablespoons of chopped fresh spinach inside of each packet for color.

Good recipe.  A little dry, but I used fat free yogurt instead of mayo and spray olive oil instead of butter.  I would also use more tarragon and more garlic.   Red onions worked well instead of green.

Loved this! My husband even ate the leftovers for lunch and he never eats leftovers! I followed the recipe exactly except for sneaking in a couple of extra sheets for phyllo for each chicken breast. I only made this because I had leftover phyllo and chicken breasts in the freezer and I searched on those ingredients and found this recipe. But this is a total keeper. This would be great for company or a ladies lunch. Thanks!

Mmmm, chicken salad in phyllo!  I scaled it down for two people, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Delicious, and very rich; I couldn't finish.  I still have a lot to learn about mastering the art of phyllo dough, so the presentation wasn't as elegant as I'd hoped.  Still, it's worth another try.

I would have given a 5 but I'm including the reactions of those I served it to. I thought it was great, others weren't as fond of the mayonnaise sauce, maybe next time I'll try sour cream or something.

Followed the recipe pretty much exactly, only I diced the chicken.  They looked so pretty, but there was just something about the taste that my family really did not like.  Can't quite put my finger on what it was, maybe it was the mayo.  Glad that I made these (needed to use us some Phyllo), just not sure its something I will be making again.

This was my first time using phyllo dough.  It was pretty easy.  I kept the dough under plastic wrap and a damp dishtowel.  The only problem I had was that the dough would get soggy and ended up leaking on the pan.  I will try it again.

I give it 5 stars, my husband says 4..., I didn't have tarragon so I just seasoned it with pepper and some seasoning salt. I added chopped up mushrooms and cheddar cheese to the mixture. I also cut up the chicken into small pieces and used butter flavored cooking spray.  Very simple and delicious!!!  Definitely will make again!

Excellent!!! Very elegant looking and so easy to do. I forgot to season the chicken but didn't even miss it because we found the mayonnaise mixture tasty enough. I was worried it wouldn't cook the chicken breast in the time stated but it did, very moist and tender. Thanks for posting this fantastic recipe!

Easy to make. My husband loved this one. Added a bit of melted mozzarella to cover on top after baking. Substituted tarragon with parsley I had on hand. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made it as is and it was delicious. I just cooked it 10 min. longer.  I will make it again just as it is.

Great flavors, family enjoyed it - I accidentally made some of these without the mayo filling and they actually turned out better: flaky, not soggy and too heavy.  I served the mayo filling on the side for dipping and it was SOOO good.  Will make again, but will serve the filling on the side.

I modified this a little.  Instead of mayo I used cream of mushroom/cream of chicken soup.  I added fresh minced garlic and chopped red onion to that along with salt, pepper, about half the ammount of lemon juice, and the taragon.  I cut up the chicken and mixed it in.  I also mixed in some chopped up ham.  (I think mushrooms would be good in there as well.)  I used two layers of phyllo dough, which I sprayed with cooking spray as others have suggested.  Before baking, I sprayed the packets with the cooking spray, added the parmesean cheese to the tops and also sprinkled some more taragon on top for color.  These turned out amazingly!  I will make these again and again!

Followed the recipe except I cut the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and marinated them in the mayo mix for several hours (covered, in the fridge). Then I spooned the mix into the phyllo and rolled it up. Delicious and popular!

AMAZING!!! Yum Yum! Boy - did I impress my husband with this dinner?!!! I ended up making it with Flounder and it was fabulous! I needed to bake it longer than stated. I used half the amount of mayo mixture and added freshly chopped basil instead of tarragon. I sprayed the Phyllo sheets with PAM instead of butter. When the packets were in the pan, I sprayed them with PAM and sprinkled on some toasted sesame seeds - It was so good! I will be making this again - and I will make it with chicken cutlets as well.

I loved this recipe but my finicky family thought it was too tart. They want me to try it next time with "more heat" and more of a Mexican dish, which changes the whole thing. I loved it and thought it made a great presentation.

It was defintely a nice change of pace for my family. The chicken came out moist and tender and with a very good flavor, while the crust remained flakey and golden brown. I feel that the sauce inside could use a little something, but it was very good nonetheless. I might try the same general recipe, substituting the mayo based sauce for a cream of chicken or cream of mushroom based sauce and see what taste results.

I make these with cream cheese instead of mayo, and I leave out the dried tarragon (which a lot of kids and picky eaters don't care for, as it tastes like black licorice). Sometimes I will add a few dashes of hot sauce for extra flavor, although I find that between the green onion, garlic, lemon, salt and pepper, it really doesn't need anything else.  You can make these up ahead of time and freeze them uncooked; they thaw in about 24 hours.  This is one of those dishes that is simple to make, but people always seem to be impressed by it.  They make a great holiday or dinner party entree.

This was good.  May try using ranch dressing instead of mayo next time and maybe add some cooked, crumbled bacon.

I'm sorry, I love Phyllo recipes, but this one did not do it for me.  Turned out soggy and filling was a little bland.  Maybe I'll try again, and marinate the chicken first and substituting something for the mayo, as I think once cooked, it has a strange flavor and becomes thin (which may be why they got soggy).

Very yummy recipe. I made chicken ones and swai ones, both turned out delicious. If you are using fish, just cut the cooking time down to 20-25 min or once the phyllo turns a golden color.

I made this recipe but made some changes to it.  I added chive and onion cream cheese and mozzarella into my mixture. I did not use parmesan cheese at all. I shreaded my chicken and mixed it all together. I used pam on my phyllo instead of butter.I used the butter and garlic mixture to brush on top of the packets. I also used cayenne pepper instead of tarragon. It was really easy and good.

Have made a couple of times and is a hit.  Like it pretty much according to recipe.   Don't see directions for what to do with the Parmesan listed in ingredients here.  I used Kasseri instead and sprinkled over the mayo mixture; about 1/2 Tbsp. per chicken breast.  Did find suggestion to use a pan with a rack helpful for controlling the butter factor.

The idea of this recipe is good.  While I did not follow the recipe EXACTLY I think there are improvements that could be made. I used regular onion and some chives.  Here is the skinny, I love mayo, but this recipe has way too much mayo.  By the end of my 3rd bite I had the feeling like I had just ate a stick of butter.  My suggestion though I have not tried it yet is substitute the mayo with cream cheese thinned out with some milk.  Good base recipe with need of a little TLC.

I made these for my husband's birthday dinner tonight and they went over very well.  I don't like mayonnaise, so after some thought, I decided to substitute cream cheese instead (it needed to be something with a bit of solidity to be the base for the sauce - more butter wouldn't have worked - and since I wasn't sure how well sour cream would bake I decided to go with cream cheese).  I also didn't have any tarragon so I used a mix of marjoram and thyme.  I also left out the onions as I didn't have any on hand.  After reading a bunch of reviews on how to handle phyllo, I didn't have any trouble at all working with it and actually thought it was fun to use!  I had to be super careful not the tear the dough, but mine didn't dry out or anything.  I made four chicken packets and used less than half of the butter since it brushed on quite easily (with a narrow end of dought in front of me, I worked horizontally back and forth with the butter).  I'm definitely going to try working with stuffed phyllo some more and experiment with the sauces.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very greasy when prepared according to directions.  Think maybe using a broiler pan would help put with this?  Also found this to be a bit on the sweet side? maybe it was the mayo I used?  Would like it a bit better on the savoury side. Easy to prepare though!! Thanks

These were really really good. Made with a friend for a small get together. We used pastry dough instead of phyllo dough so the covering was probably much thicker but it was still really good and much easier too!

Very good. Next time, I think I'll decrease the lemon to 1 Tblsp. Also, I made the chicken packets for dinner and it really does not fill you up. I even had potatoes and asparagus with the meal and I was hungry within 2 hours. I would serve this as a lunch or even make the packets smaller to use as appetizers.

It was a bit bland so next time we might spice it up a bit and add other ingredients to the chicken!!  We used whole wheat phyllo dough and it was really good!

This was FABULOUS! The only change I made was yellow onion for green onion.  This is a keeper!

I'm not sure what it was, but we really did not like the flavor of this dish. It looked beautiful and smelled great, but when we tasted it, it just didn't appeal. We ended up pulling the chicken out of the packets and eating it plain. It's a good idea, though, and I might try it again with a different filling.

This was a good recipe, a really neat twist for something different to do with chicken.  I think I was expecting it to turn out better, but like many others have noted, it's something with the sauce.  I ended up using cream of chicken soup since I had a half tin leftover in the fridge to use up (and based on other comments regarding the mayo), but mayo or the soup, we just weren't fans of the 'cream based' sauce.  I love the concept of this chicken, but might try with a marinara type sauce.  I did opt to dice the chicken into bite sized pieces and used spray oil instead of all of the butter.  All in all, yummy, just may tweak for our personal preferences, thanks!

These were very good and easy to make.  This was only my second time using phyllo and I did take suggestion of others and used butter spray instead of butter.  I used 3 sheets per breast.  Mine did take longer to bake so I may pound thinner next time.  Also these are not so good as left overs, the phyllo is much better when it comes out of the oven vs the frig.

This recipe was great.  It was nice to make something different for a change!  I will definately play around with it next time - maybe some cheese or something - to try and get the kids to like it more.
