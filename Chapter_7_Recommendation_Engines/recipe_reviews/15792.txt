This one wins five stars for taste as well as simplicity.  I made it for my peanut-butter lover sons and they couldn't stop talking about it--AMAZING was the word I kept hearing.  I wanted to take a picture of it for the website but it was gone too quickly!!
One tip--when the recipe says "chill" on the crust, put it in the freezer for about an hour.  That makes it much easier to put the ice cream/peanut butter mixture in it.

this is sooooooo good if you love peanutbutter!!  The only problem i found is that you need to work quickly!!  so keep that in mind and have everything ready... I added to the top of mine the chocolate that gets hard when you put it on ice cream- yummieeeeee.

Delicious (as long as you like peanut butter)!  I used smooth peanut butter instead of crunchy.  I also used no sugar added ice cream and Splenda instead of sugar.  Because I used natural peanut butter, I added a little bit of Splenda to the ice cream/peanut butter mixture as well.  Fantastic.  Can't wait to try it with chocolate ice cream!

I used chocolate grahams, because that's what I had on hand...Oh my gosh, is this ever good.  I used 9 "whole" graham crackers, it does not specify in the recipe what 9 means, 9 little rectangles or the entire cracker.  This is easy and very tasty.  I drissled chocolate syrup over each slice.  Try this, whomever eats this will be impressed and want another piece!!  By the way, I did not think this was too peanutty.  I also used french vanilla ice cream.

This pie was incredibly easy to do and turned out terrific!!  Just make sure you cut into small pieces, because it does get a little sweet at the end!

I thought that this was a great recipe to use as a base for adding your own touches.  I used chocolate graham crackers to make the crust. I also mixed peanut butter chips and chocolate chunks, and swirled ice cream fudge topping, into the peanut butter ice cream.  It was fantastic!

This is DELICIOUS. I used half chocolate and half vanilla ice cream, and put some chocolate shavings on top. My husband isn´t a huge dessert person and he loved this! And it´s so easy!

I used an already made crust and creamy, rather than crunchy, peanut butter.  I didn't have salted peanuts so I salted some nut topping and stirred that in with a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and 1 1/2 Tblsp of sugar.  Served with cool whip, sliced bananas, stawberries, and blue berries for the 4th of July.  Really very good!

This is the best pie ever. I wanted to eat it all myself. I made for my 4th of July party and when I brought it out everyone attacked it. I thought I wasn't going to get any. I ended up just using an oreo cookie pie crust just to save time and it made it so good. I also topped it with hot fudge and peanut butter topping and chopped Reeses peanut butter cups. So freakin good. I can't wait to make it again. Just for me!!!!!!

This is heavenly!! I made it for a Memorial Day party, and it was gone in a flash. So simple and quick to prepare, too. I used eight grahams instead of nine b/c I didn't want to open another package to use just one, and the crust still came out fine. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Unbelievably good! We don't really care for desserts but we were fighting over the last slice. I can only imagine what it would be like with chocolate shavings on top... Thanks so much, Carolyn!

Didn't have much time to prepare dessert for an impromptu birthday party. I used the Keebler premade graham cracker crust, vanilla bean ice cream and smooth peanut butter. I chopped 12 miniature Reese's cups and stirred them into the mixture before filling the shell. Then I chopped four more for the top. When I took the pie out to let it soften for serving, I put the Reese's hard shell topping on it. It was wonderful.

So good!  It tasted like something that Coldstone Creamery created.  I will definitely be making this again!!!

I even used low fat ice cream and low fat peanut butter, and you couldn't tell!  

5+ Stars!

This was delicious, I made the vanilla ice cream rather than using store bought, and I also drizzled some melted chocolate over the top of the pie. My entire family loved this.

I love the crust. Be sure to press into a thin crust or it is difficult to cut.
