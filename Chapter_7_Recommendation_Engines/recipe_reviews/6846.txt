I made this twice and wish I had just bought a box mix. Other recipes for muffins are so much better than this one. They were dry and not very sweet. I recomend trying any other recipe for muffins before this one.

I made some changes to this recipe and my muffins were absolutely delicious!  I used 100% whole wheat flour (I NEVER do half white, half wheat; I prefer all whole wheat flour) 1 whole egg instead of egg whites, Applesauce instead of oil, 1 tablespoon fat free french vanilla yogurt, and 2% milk instead of skim.  I used frozen wild blueberries, but I'm not sure that made much of a difference.  At the end, before I baked them, I threw in some ground flaxseed meal.  They are very moist and they taste delish!

Quite good.  I changed recipe by using one whole egg, added an extra 1/2c milk and brown sugar instead of white.  I made the first batch by the original recipe and found them a little dry.  By adding the extra milk it fluffed them up perfectly.

These really are great muffins. I read all the other reviews and then made changes. I added a whole egg and 1/2c of vanilla yogurt. They turned out really moist and are perfect for breakfast.

This is a good recipe for low fat muffins and it can be used with other berries. I prepared them with half white flour/half whole wheat flour and it turned out nice.

I was a little scared when I finished making the batter because it was a VERY dry batter. But don't worry, they turn out  great. They were fluffy and a little bit like cake, but had this great crunchy outside. They were really tasty.

Muffins were FANTASTIC! I did make a minor change, though. I added an extra 2 tablespoons of white sugar and also 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. The muffins are moist and yummy. I will definitely make these again! :0)

This is a good recipe, especially for being low calorie! I made a few changes that I really liked: half whole wheat flour and half white flour, half brown sugar and half white sugar, add 1 teaspoon vanilla to egg white mixture. Very yummy!

Tasted great.  Added one egg instead of egg white because I'm too lazy.  They tasted great as is.  I used frozen blueberries.  Does that count as fresh?

These muffins are healthy and you can tell by their bland taste.  I like my muffins a bit sweeter and with more depth.

Delicious. This recipe made 26 mini muffins...more blueberries than batter for each mouthful! I gave 4 stars because they could have been a touch sweeter, but that's easily fixed for next time.

It's a good base recipe. I read the reviews first and here's what I did. I added one whole farm fresh egg, 1 cup milk, 3 tbsp melted margarine, 1 tbsp baking powder, 1/2 cup raw sugar, 1 1/2 cups frozen blueberries, and 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. I also sprinkled the tops of the muffins with 1/2 a tsp of raw sugar before putting them in the oven.

These muffins were great, and bursting with blueberries in every bite.  I like that they don't contain a lot of oil and butter, like other recipes.  They baked up nicely and the whole family really liked these!

This is an excellent recipe, however next time I will add a little more skim milk.  They were a little dry for my taste but still very, very good.

I made some changes to this recipe. I didn't have fresh fruit so I used dried blue berries, dried cranberries, and chopped walnuts instead. I used mini muffin pans instead and only baked them for about 12-15 min. The batter seemed to be extremely dry before putting them into the trays, but they turned out amazing.

They tasted ok, but there just didn't seem to be enough liquid for all the flour. They didn't rise very much. I had added a few more blueberries than called for. I dont think I will do this recipe again, but like I said, They tasted fine.

These muffins had a great flavor but were a little bit dry. I would recommend baking them for a little less time, only making 9 muffins, and adding 2 tbsp. applesauce. It's great to see a low fat recipe that turns out well!

I can only recommend this recipe if you're going to make 6 rather than 12 muffins.  I made two batches following the recipe exactly.  The first batch of 12 were very dry and stubby.  The second batch I filled the cups to make 6 and they were much better.  They were not like the cake-like muffins like out of the box.  They were more of a biscuit texture.

Very tasty recipe, however I made a few changes: I used a drained can of boysenberries and a mashed banana in place of the blueberries, used only one tablespoon of margarine, and put a mixture of light cream cheese and strawberry preserves in the middle of each muffin. Delicious.

And add some more berries :)

Delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written. While I yielded only eight muffins, I love that these muffins are more blueberry than batter. Not too sweet. Just right!

These are so easy to make and as a "light" muffin they are very tasty too!
