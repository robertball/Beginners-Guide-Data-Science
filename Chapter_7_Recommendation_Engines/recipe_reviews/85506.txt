This recipe was fantastic! I reduced the butter from 1/2 cup to 2 TBS and used it first in a sautee for two minutes with the garlic and ginger to enhance their flavors before adding the wine and vegetable stock. Near the end I added a bit of parmesan, lemon pepper and cornstarch which resulted in a richer, thicker sauce. Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe was a big hit.  I reduced the amount of butter and 'sweated' the vegetables first then added stock and thickened a bit with corn starch before adding in the scallops and prawns.  Delicious and will definitely cook it again.  Thanks.

This makes an excellent sauce to compliment any seafood. I served this in a salad bowl over thin spaghetti and ladeled the broth over all of it. Thank you for excellence!

Mmmmm....this was so good!  The only thing I added was a squeeze of lemon at the end, which it needed, hence the four stars instead of five.  So delicious!

Sorry, but I was hoping for so much more from this recipe.  Made exactly as written, however something is missing in the ginger/butter sauce. Secondly, the sauce is way to thin.  Even if it was thickened with cornstarch as others suggested, I can't see much improvement.

Prepared with 3T butter, sauteeing garlic, ginger, and vegetables slightly beforehand.  Served as a soup with udon - rooster sauce (Sriracha) is a must!!!

Everyone ate it all, but no comments good or bad. I thought it was good but not fantastic, thus the four stars.

I follow the recipe exactly as written using salted butter. It takes about an hour to get to temperature so be patient and make sure to use a larger pan than you think you need so it doesn't boil over! 8 quarts is great. I won a Blue Ribbon at the State Fair for this recipe!

The recipe turned out great with all the additions. I don't care for leeks so I used a mix of stir fry vegetables and took everyone's suggestions. I thickened it with cornstarch added a little Sriracha hot chili sauce and hot pepper flakes. Will make this again

Very good, a little bit to rich with all the butter, but loved the leeks.

I made a couple of small changes.  Based on the reviews saying the broth was too thin, I used a condensed vegetable broth and only added a small amount of water to it.  This gave the broth a very nice consistency.  I also prefer my scallops to be seared, so I cooked them in a seperate pan and drizzeled with the ginger butter.  Delicious.
