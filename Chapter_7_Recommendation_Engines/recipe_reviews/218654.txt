The only difference between this and one I make is like one other suggested is vegetable broth, and I also add a sweet potato to make it a little heartier. Thanks for sharing your recipe. I try it this way next time

The instructions to cook this for 30 minutes in a pressure cooker are wrong. This takes about 15 minutes in a modern pressure cooker. This may be why some of the other reviewers scorched theirs. The outcome is a smokey, thick soup that is good. It lacks some kick, not flavour, but some kick so I added fresh hot peppers and it seemed to help. Thank you BELEDONA for your recipe.

Really good. Smooth and subtle. I upped the lemon quite a bit but that's just me; gave it the tang of Greek avgolemono. I also sauteed the carrot, onion & garlic, adding in that order, because that's my default method with aromatics. Like others, I see no reason to cook under pressure for more than 15 minutes. I used an electric pressure cooker (Cuisinart, high pressure, natural release). The result is nice and creamy.  Four stars only because I'm partial to bigger flavor. I'll play around with it a bit based on some other recipes I've seen.  That's the fun of cooking, right? Perhaps some tomato paste, smoked paprika, whole coriander toasted in a dry skillet before grinding...

Very good soup.  I added ham and the broth which I pressure cooked first and pulled the meat off.  I also added celery, a potato, and garlic in a jar already cleaned and chopped from Costco (3T).  Since I didn't have enough ham broth, I supplemented it with low sodium chicken broth.  I added the carrots (shredded) later as a last step for 15 min.

Very easy and great flavor.  I made a triple batch on the stovetop in less than an hour.  I used vegetable broth to make it VEGAN with fresh onions, one red and one yellow.  I didn't have fresh carrots or garlic but a couple cans of diced carrots in water worked fine with garlic powder. Would be better with fresh but this recipe is a keeper!  Thank you!

Tried it with my pressure cooker and it was delicious. I also added 1/2 tsp of curry and a couple handfuls of frozen kale. We ate it over some brown rice and even my 6 yr old loved it!

I did recipe as is, but will try the ham hock next time for flavor. FYI, this was my first time cooking in my new Fagor multi-cooker.  I cut the time to 15 minutes, just in case.  I was really worried based on the comments of others.  It turned out perfect. The peas and lentils disintegrated and the carrots were soft and tender.  Win!

I really enjoyed this recipe. So easy!! I did it on the stovetop & made the following adjustments: Veggie stock instead of chicken - for vegan. Added broccoli, turmeric, bay leaf, oregano. To lower sodium, Mrs. Dash lemon pepper is really good!! (For any recipe). Thanks!!

It's good. Simple, though, and could use additional flavor and filler.  I've even added barley.  I don't own a pressure cooker, but lentils  and split peas don't take long to cook on the stovetop - 45 minutes for the lentils, a little longer for the split peas.  I used the liquid from rehydrating shiitake mushrooms instead of chicken broth, and it went nicely with the lentils. Definitely serve with rustic bread.

Good recipe. Did not have peas but had a lb of lentils. Added only 5 cups of broth and cooked for 8 minutes in electric pressure cooker. Added 1/2 tsp of curry and a bay leaf. Yum!

I don't have a pressure cooker so i just used my stove top and let it cook for an hour. I didn't have carrots so I used celery in its place! I also added some chili powder and omitted the lemon juice!  I thought it was good and made the whole house smell delightful!!

I really liked this soup. I make a big slow cooker pot of soup every Sunday to last the hubby and I through the week for lunches. This recipe was by far the quickest though surprisingly yummy! I am trying again tonight though may spice it up a bit more.

Easy to make, tasty and healthy!

I added 3 TBSP of olive oil, 1/2 tsp of chili powder, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of pepper, 1/2 fresh squeezed lemon and served it with fresh cilantro and dusted with chili powder. Using a modern pressure cooker, I only cooked it on medium for 15 minutes as others recommended and it turned out fantastic! Added a little more salt when served. Delish!

I still have to work on my pressure cooker technique, but the flavor is excellent!  I think I left if on medium too long and maybe didn't lower the temperature enough.  It did get a bit scorched on the bottom. Those problems are clearly user error and nothing to do with the recipe.

I had to use green split peas rather than yellow as I couldn't find yellow. I did add a sweet potato, because I love them and then added farro to the mix (again, I love it). I added sumac as I'm trying out new spices. This turned out to be warm, thick (I think I'll add more liquid next time) and just what we wanted for a cold evening. No, I didn't try it the first time as written, but  I am grateful to Beledona for posting such a great recipe. Thank you!

Very easy to make. I cut the recipe in half. Mild flavor, I did add a few jalapeno slices. I also blended half of the soup and mixed it with remainder for texture.

This soup was delicious! I don't have a pressure cooker so cooked it regular on the stove. Last night I didn't have carrots so used a sweet potato instead. Though I've also made it a few times in the past without any substitutions. Whole family loved it each time!

Recipe is good, could use a flavour boost.
HOWEVER, the timing is way off - try 15 minutes instead of 30.

Great recipe in my new pressure cooker.  Lots of left overs and freezes well.  Good flavor although I'll spice it up a bit more next time for my tastes - nothing different but maybe more cumin and black pepper.  Nice cool weather lunch!

Yummy!  I followed other reviewers and only cooked 15 min under pressure.                                I didn't have chicken broth, so I used bullion- should not have thrown in any salt- thought about it as it was dropping into the pot. Noooo! Oh well, a tad salty, but I loved the cumin. I also added a couple stalks of celery.   I cut the carrots in good sized chunks and I really liked finding them with a little texture in my bowl.   Warm up some crusty sourdough with butter, and call it dinner!   Thanks for the recipe!

I love this dish.  It is simple, nutritious and has a wonderful flavor.  I froze small containers and defrosted as needed.  I will be making this again in a double batch.

Very good added ham and potatoes however the 15 mins in the pressure cooker maybe the best advise I did a half hour and it burned to bottom (I know I have to add more liquid next time)

This soup really needs to be blended after it is done. It is awesome.
I added 8 oz of low sodium chopped cooked ham and did not add any other salt. It blended up great.

As noted in many reviews, incredibly bland as written. Two stars because it can be salvaged. I ended up throwing in all sorts of ingredients out of desperation.  I added hot sauce, smoked paprika, and liquid smoke. I will not be making this again.

I had used a no-salt chicken stock.  It was not as good as using a low salt chicken stock.  I was thinking about adding some bacon to play around with the recipe.  My daughter really likes this recipe especially as a part of her school lunch.

I made this today and it is delicious! I added a few things to it and changed a few things only because the store did not have red lentils or yellow split peas; instead I used green lentils and green split peas. I also added crushed red pepper flakes and two sauzon Goya packets  (I made a double batch of this).  For a personal bowl, I added diced avocado and chopped cilantro (as shown in the picture).

It was good – be generous with the seasonings and spices! Made it at 15 minutes, probably could have gotten away with 20 but still good at 15!

There was no yellow peas at my grocery store, so I used green split peas. It was delicious!!!

This was really good. I used my electric pressure cooker and cooked for 15 minutes and let the pressure out slow and it was perfect. I need more pressure cooker recipes, so I hope you will post again. Thanks for a great recipe.

Super easy!  I'm just getting acquainted with my Instant Pot, but it couldn't have been easier to put together.  I used green split peas as I didn't have yellow, which I read are a bit sweeter.  I also used maybe an extra 1/2 carrot.  Pressure cooking for 15-20 minutes is very adequate.  I wished it had more flavor, as often happens in plant based recipes, so I will try experimenting a bit more with the seasonings, but it was thick and filling and I will make it again.

I made the recipe as written., except I forgot to add lemon juice after. I will try that when I reheat my next bowl. I love this kind of recipe. Mine did turn out thick which is how I like it. I added cheese to the first bowl. Next time I crisped up corn tortillas & put some inside with cheese & sour cream. I also like to add avocado to the bowl or tortilla. It makes a good amount so I froze part of it for later. Thank you for sharing, know I shall be making this a lot

This soup is excellent.  Great taste with a lovely blend of flavors and just a perfect thickness.  I always make lentil soup with ham stock so I was intrigued when I saw this recipe with chicken stock but I am glad I made it and I will make it again. I added a little rutibaga as I had some that needed used up but otherwise per the recipe.

Using PowerCooker Plus I set it to lentils/beans 15 minutes.

Could only find green split peas.

Doesn't really need any changes, but did later add chili powder just to try it.

It was very good and easily the easiest thing I have ever made.

Extra lemon juice and some crushed red pepper spiced this up for me. It was otherwise quite bland. I sauteed the onion, garlic, carrots and some celery before adding the broth, cumin, salt, pepper, lentils, and split peas. This cooked perfectly at 15 minutes in the pressure cooker on manual and 15 minutes on slow release. I don't know that I'd make this exactly as stated in the recipe again, but I like it enough to finish the pot.

Second time I made it this week. Such a great fall soup. My squashes were so big I made a double batch. Definitely half the amount of cream cheese.

Delicious! Sadly, I didn’t have chicken broth, but it tasted great with the beef broth I had canned.

So good! I stuck to the recipe. The red lentils and yellow peas taste great together and make a nice color. I used my homemade chicken broth as a base.

I followed the recipe almost 100%, but added about a pound of pork ribblets and and some collard greens cut up spoon size, then pressure cooked for a good half hour.  Super tasty and the ribblet bones were so soft they could be chewed up... so good for calcium/magnesium contents.

I made this, added a bay leaf while it was on the ‘Keep Warm’ setting. It is delicious. I think I have one or two servings left. Last night I added some ‘Medium’ chunky salsa to my bowl and it was very good with that addition.  I will add it to future servings. The recipe is definitely a keeper. SO easy to make, no fat and it’s delicious!!

This recipe was a good start, but to me it was bland.  I used my Instant Pot and cut the cook time down to 15 minutes.  I also wasn't crazy about the blobs of slimy onion and carrot floating in a rather thin liquid, so I whipped out my stick blender and took care of that. The produced a really nice, creamy consistency. 

On my second attempt, I spiced the recipe up with 1 tsp of curry powder, 1/2 tsp of turmeric, and 1/2 tsp of paprika and used the juice of half a lemon. 

I also first sautéd the onion and carrots in olive oil for a few minutes, then added the garlic and seasonings (all but the salt, pepper and lemon juice) and continue to sauté for a couple of minutes more before adding the lentils, peas and broth. Delicious.

After reading all the reviews,  I decided to add for flavor.  I only had 1/4 c lentils,  so added 3/4 split peas.  I lightly browned 1 lg diced onion, sliced 2 carrots,  1+ c celery leaves, 1c diced sweet potato in pressure cooker.   Browned 1 T cumin seeds, 1 T  tarragon seeds.  Put all in cooker with 8 cups Better than Bouillon beef (all I had).  Added 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 can sliced mushrooms Pressured 10 min.  Cooled with cold water on top 'til no more steam.  Added kosher salt, red & blk pepper, powered garlic & sage, Mrs.Dash No Salt Table Blend Seasoning. Added 1T smoked paprika,  1/4 tsp smoke flavoring, 1+T ea chopped cilantro, worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar.  I cook by taste, add more of what I think is needed,  taste, add, etc.  So everytime I cook,  it's always a little different, depending on what I have on hand.  For me, that's what makes cooking fun!  If you don't think what you're making tastes the way you think it should, experiment!

We loved it!  Kroger and Sprouts did not carry yellow split peas so I ordered them from Amazon.   It was worth waiting for, since the flavor AND color are totally different.  I used Bragg's apple cider vinegar (about 2 Tbs) instead of the lemon juice. After reading the reviews about this not being hearty enough, I decided to add 1 red potato and about 1/3 c diced smoked ham.   Cooked for 22 minutes.  Garnished with red pepper flakes and dried thyme.   My husband said this is a new favorite of his.

Used veggie broth, added 2 bay leaves, tomato paste, garlic, soy sauce & served over brown rice, still to bland for us.  Next time I'll add celery & more herbs & spices.  

Set my IP for 15 min. & was not done so set it for another 15 min & was perfect.  Maybe lentils & split peas were to old, so my bad.
