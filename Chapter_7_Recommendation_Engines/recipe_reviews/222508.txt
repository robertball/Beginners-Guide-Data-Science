We loved it, it was easy to make and very filling. For the amount that is made in the recipe there was not enough meat. next time I will add another pound of meat, maybe 2.

Yum.  I didn't have any kluski noodles, so used regular egg noodles, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I was very happy with the results, it made A LOT of food!

I made this and loved every single bite. It is well balanced, with veggies to counter the heavier meat. I seasoned with hot sauce, because I put hot sauce on everything, however, the combination was beautiful. Thank you fire chef for sharing these straightforward instructions on a fantastic dinner! This one is saved to my facortives and will certainly make it again!

This is amazing! I like cabbage, but my husband is not a big fan, but he is on seconds as I write this.  I admit I made  it my own by adding some items,  ham base to the cabbage, garlic powder and Italian seasonings and red pepper. I also added carrots and grape tomatoes as they were in the fridge .   THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL BASE RECIPE! I also used just regular egg noodles.   I only used 1 cabage and 1 1/2 pounds of kielbasa.  I am so happy about this recipe and it will definitely be a new staple in our dinner rotation!!Oh man!! I forgot the eggs!  I will definitely do those next week! Yay cabbage!

Super good comfort food and the right mix of ingredients! Itâ€™s light and not too rich or heavy.
