Seriously, the best!  I ordered some saffron and was looking for a low carb recipe I could use.  Everything was Saffron rice.  I was not convinced that this recipe was going to be that great.  I was a bit nervous, but I at least thought it would be edible.  I was blown away!  Totally!  It is amazing!  Simple, yet succulent flavors!  Amazing!  I would give this recipe more stars if I could!  My 15 year old God-daughter was here and she was so excited she said that it tasted like a meal you would eat in a really good restaurant!  It was truly amazing.  I could not find the lamb stew meat, so I used lamb chops and it was incredible.  I will be making this one again and again and again!  Thank you for such a delicious recipe!

Best lamb I ever made! I paired it with the date rice pudding for a trip to Tunisia for my wife.

Thank you for another lovely Tunisian recipie. I am trying several of them because of the new community I am in. Just wondering, did you use real saffron or the stuff sold in Tunisia as "saffron"? I think real saffron would have been better. But either way -- yummy!

I think it's possible that something is either missing or a little bit out of balance, because it should have been better than it was.  Maybe I should have used a yellow onion instead of a white one, or something.  If anybody tweaks it with better results, I hope they write in, because I love the concept!

If you add peas and artichoke this is the same as Marquit jilbana (served as a soup).

Just made it and ate it with my family. I had some stewing lamb and some chops. Next time, it'll be all chops, because the stewing lamb was really tough. Not the fault of the recipe though, I just bought some cheap meat. Very nice flavour, we all enjoyed it. Someone brought me saffron from Iran, and I think it's a bit stronger than the one that was used in the original recipe. I only used about 3/4 tsp for over 2 lb meat, and it was still a bit overpowering. I'll definitely make again, but with better quality meat.
