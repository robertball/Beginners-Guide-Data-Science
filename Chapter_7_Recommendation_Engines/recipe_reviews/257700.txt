I cut this back to 8 servings for 1 loaf. I used 1 whole and 2 tbs eggs and 1 and 1/4 tsp of yeast. I find that the ratio of flour to liquid is way off I find that 5/3 flour to liquid is the usual formula and this recipe is almost 50/50 when the butter is factored in. I always expect to adjust the liquid/flour depending on the humidity but I had to add an additional 2 cups of flour to make this work. I would rate this a 5 star recipe for the flavour but as written it's a 3.
