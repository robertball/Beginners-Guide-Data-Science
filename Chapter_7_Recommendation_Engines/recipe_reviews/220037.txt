Made it just as ordered, except I put in less creole seasoniing(I don't like real hot foods). Tasted great, BUT, the rice turned to mush. I probably would put the rice in later in the cooking. Next time I'm going to cook all the ingredients, minus the rice, in the cooker and cook the rice separate.  Then as a final,  pour the jambalaya over the rice on the plate.

My favorite part about this dish was that it came together quickly and with basically minimal effort, but I couldn't make it again without changing some things.  The recipe didn't say whether or not to drain the tomatoes, so I didn't, and found the end result to be more like the consistency of a stew.  (Besides the fact that my Cajun husband pointed out that true jambalaya doesn't have tomatoes anyway.)  So next time I would either drain the tomatoes or eliminate them altogether.  Also, it was way too spicy for our kids, to the point that they couldn't finish their dinner, so I would use less than the 1 T. of Cajun seasoning that is called for.  

This isn't nearly as good as my homemade jambalaya, but I will keep the recipe because I typically have all of the ingredients on hand and it's easy to throw together on those days that you're rushed or haven't planned, even if you don't put it in the crockpot until 1 p.m.

A true taste of New Orleans. Absolutely perfect for most. A few dashes of Tabasco added the heat I need.

Tasted good, however the rice MUST go in later on, as by the end it was close to a mushy paste in consistency. As another reviewer also mentioned, I suggest that you also drain the tomatoes before adding them. All that aside, you can't rally beat the flavor.

Made it according to the recipe. It tasted great, but the rice was WAY to mushy. Next time I'll cook the rice separately and put the the jambalaya over it.

It came out tasty, but i do agree with the comment regarding the rice.  I would put it in much later or cook it seperate.  My kids tend to like a bit less onion too.  I would also use mixed skinless chicken chopped up vs thighs only.  But overall, a tasty meal.

I did not add the rice during cooking. Consistency a little thin without the starch from the rice, so would reduce added liquid.

My family loved this.  I cooked it on the stovetop and used holiday leftover turkey and kielbasa. Fantastic.  I looked up a recipe to make my own creole spice WoW!

This recipe was delicious!!! Like many other reviews I did not add the rice at the beginning. I cooked it separately and then added it to the crockpot for about 10 minutes to combine everything. Even my picky daughters

This was an extremely easy to follow recipe that turned out fantastic. We have made it a number of times now for at home . Getting ready to make it again for a Potluck. The only thing that wasn't clear was that the rice was instant rice. We don't have instant rice, so needed to cook the rice separately before hand or it wouldn't get soft enough.

I made rice separate and added shrimp to crock pot 20 minutes before done.  It was tangier than my daughter would have liked but hubby enjoyed it.

This was excellent dish and an easy to follow recipe.  I did not add the rice to the dish.  Please make the rice separately and do not add to the Jambalaya.  It will be a big ball of mush.

This was the first jambalaya I ever made and it was fantastic! I misread the recipe and put the shrimp in for the full time and they were still good. (I did use frozen shrimp though). My husband loved it and even my 2 year old ate it!

I was looking for a slow cooker recipe for my fist attempt at Jambalaya.  I made some changes:
Used 12 oz pkg of Andouille instead of Kielbasa.
Used 1 lb of chicken breast. 
Used 1 lb of shrimp.
Didn't use the grn. pepper.
Used a whole bunch of scallions instead of reg onions. 

I am sorry I missed the suggestion to a shorter cooking time.  Definitely don't need 7-8 hrs. I  did 7 and it came out mushy and over done rice. Like outmeal.

The flavors however were good. The Andouille added some extra zing. I will definitely make it again with all my tweeks.

My family loved it.  It's real spicy with the cayenne and Cajun seasoning.  Drain the tomatoes before adding to pot and if you don't want it real saucy use 3/4 cup of broth.

This was a first for me, and it would have been perfect, EXCEPT: As mentioned in other reviews, the rice did turn to mush.  Next time I will either add it the last 30 minutes or cook separately to serve under Jambalaya.

Liked it, but made some changes. Used cut up chicken tenders for convenience, smoked sausage to keep heat down, less Cajun seasoning (hubby added more to his because he prefers it hotter), added rice for last 3 hours but that was still too long - turned mushy. Shrimp cooked crazy fast at the end. I’ll make it again adding rice even later

I only made one change - I used brown rice and it turned out great.  I didn't find it spicy at all so would probably add a little more spice next time.  I tried this as a alternative to another jambalaya recipe on this site (Bubba's) as I wanted one designed for the slow cooker and found this better for two reasons - 1) it was a lot less salty, (only uses sausage instead of ham and sausage) and 2) the prep time was much less.

My slow cooker may cook extremely fast but I would recommend maybe 5 hours total and add your rice in at about 1.25 hours then your shrimp at a half hour

Followed recipe exactly as written except for adding a few dashes of Tabasco and cooking rice separately.  Cooked 5 hours with slow cooker on high, adding shrimp for last 20 mins or so.  Celery was still a little crunchy - just the way we like it.  Served over rice - excellent meal.

This was way too wet and even draining the tomatoes and adding the rice one hour before serving it still turned out mushy.  I will try a different recipe next time.

Add rice at the end ...... Unconventional but adding water chestnuts and mushrooms, it became amazing.  Used creole seasoning from web sight.

I knew from experience that adding the rice at the beginning would not work out well but as a rule I always make it exactly to the recipe or I won't rate it . Over all it came out very good. Even my finicky 16 yr old liked it. I think I'll be punching up the leftovers with some more flavors and aromatics.

I added Cajun seasoning as I don't have access to Creole seasoning. The cook time was too long it gave the dish the consistency of porridge; the rice was mush! Flavour was great though!

Amazing! I love that I can put everything together in the morning and when I get home it's done. We did put a bit of hot sauce just because we like it hot.

This was horrible!  The rice was mush by the time 6 hrs. had gone by.  I rinsed the rice off the meat and re-used it in another recipe.
