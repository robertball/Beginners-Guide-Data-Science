I didn't make any changes, but still found the tomato paste make it sweet. My husband thought it was too tomato-y. It's not likely to show up on my rotation again.  But I was looking for a low carb version of chili and this was it.

Two notes for anyone seeking to make this. First, my 6 qt slow cooker was nowhere near large enough; I left out half the diced tomatoes and all of the crushed. If I do it again, I would mix all in a very large bowl and then use two cookers.
Second, on tasting during cooking I found it very acid. Two tbsps of sugar helped out with that.
Some folks might want more chili powder, as well.
