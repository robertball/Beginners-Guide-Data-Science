I made this for my husband for his birthday. Instead of strawberries & strawberry ice cream, I used oreos & chocolate ice cream. It turned out great & my husband (& everyone else) loved it! Thanks!

Taste very dry.  Cream cheese icing would not spread easily.  Ugly apperance.  All around bad tasting.

Good cake. The frosting wouldn't stick very well. I suggest to refrigerate the frosting for a while before spreading it.

Excellent!! I thought the cake would soak up the soft ice cream and be soggy, but it doesn't. Thank you for the recipe, this is a great cake.

This time of year, I cannot find enough recipes for strawberries.  This sounds delicous and looks to be oh so easy.
