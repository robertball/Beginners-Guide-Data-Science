I left the feta out and added some grated potato. Turned out great even without the cheese. I served it with a homemade raita (yogurt, salt, pepper, cumin, and a tomato) to create a sort of indian take on the classic latke with sour cream

These were great! The only thing I would do differently next time is to add more feta. Hubs and I agreed that it pretty much got lost among the other ingredients.

This turned out great and I’ve made a double recipe twice in the last couple weeks because they disappear in no time. Great way to get protein and veggies together. I used quinoa flour instead of rice flour the second time and it was the same taste. I also add a pinch of baking powder to the mix.  I don’t think the feta cheese adds much inside the pancake but crumbled on top with tomatoes and cucumbers it’s really good. Also tried frying it in EVOO, ghee and nothing (in a nonstick pan) and found it cooks most evenly browned in the nonstick pan with no oil. This is going to be a staple for me as a double batch makes 18 x 5 inch pancakes which make for an easy, healthy breakfast or even lunch or dinner with salad.

I love Indian cooking, and I believe an Indian cheese, Paneer, would be preferable to feta in this recipe.

It looked really liquidy, but it held together great! It was really good, although it was not spicy at all so next time we will use two jalapenos with the seeds instead of one.

I will make it again! We both really liked it.  I left out the jalapeño because I didn’t have one. I didn’t have feta so I used grated cheddar but would love to try it with feta. I substituted all purpose flour and white whole wheat flour for the 2flours, respectively. One of mine was a little under cooked and the texture wasn’t as good as the ones fully cooked.

Excellent only thing I would do different is one cup feta and two jalapeños.

I replaced the chickpea flour with as much rice flour. I cooked them in a stainless steel pan with vegetable oil. FYI, If you don't cook them long enough, they tend to fall apart when you move them. These were so tasty, and the texture is great if you cook them well. I plan on making them with friends in the future. They're especially good with plain yogurt or sour cream on top (yogurt is better, as it didn't overpower the taste, but sour cream will do in a pinch).
