This was SO yummy. I made one just for myself and it hit the spot. Just the right amount of heat and the perfect combination of ingredients. 

I think I might make these again tomorrow.

Great sandwich!  I love grilled ham and cheese and if you like things with a little heat give this a try. I used "Horseradish Sauce" by CAROL46 from this site which really took it over the top. Very tasty especially with a side of chips and a pickle.

These were pretty good.  Made them open faced.  I tend to always do that if I am serving a hot sandwich for dinner.  I guess eating it with a knife and fork seems more like dinner.  Anyway, I didn't have any horseradish sauce so I made one with 3/4 cup mayo.  2TBS dijon, 1 TBS whole grain mustard and 2 TBS sour cream.  This went pretty well with the sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe.

Adult version of a cheese toastie.  My husband and I had these for a quick Saturday lunch.  We both liked the zing the horseradish sauce added, but the onion was a little strong.  All-in-all a very good sandwich, worth repeating.

I am rating this 3.5 stars. This was pretty good! I liked the flavor that the horseradish gave, but I wasn't big on the onion part and I'm an onion lover. Next time I'll just omit those. Thanks for sharing. :)

This was delicious! I just eyeballed the ingredients - more ham for Husband; more onion for me - and I used lite mayo. The ham/horseradish combination is excellent. Thanks, Wanda! I 'll be making this often!

Wonderful recipe! The horseradish amount was perfect! So tasty, and filling. One is enough as a perfect side for a hearty veggie soup :)

I used wheat bread. I liked the flavor the horseradish gave it. I think next time I will leave the onion out and add tomatoes. Thanks for posting.
