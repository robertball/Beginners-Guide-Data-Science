This is definitely one of my favorites. I use a slightly different recipes, but it's rather close. To cut down on the fat, I use a 6 ounce carton of yogurt, and since I'm normally making 2 servings, I only use 3 skinless boneless chicken breasts and 1/2 C of SUGAR-FREE chutney. I also toss in different nuts and fruits...sometimes sunflower seeds (1/2 C) or slivered almonds, instead of the pecans, or 1/4 C raisins and 1/2 C diced apples instead of the grapes. I prefer to omit the onion. My version has about 300 calories per serving, makes 2 main dish servings.

This salad is beyond yummy!  It's very formal and would definitely be the star of any meal.  As a note, 3/4 cup is an entire 9 oz. bottle of chutney.

Best chicken salad I ever ate!  I substituted fat-free yogurt for the mayo and used 2 Tbsp. yellow raisins in place of the grapes. I used romaine lettuce leaves to make chicken salad wraps - fantastic!

Made this recipe for a 40th bday party.  It was gobbled up quick - the hit of the party (it even stole the spotlight from the bacon-wrapped dates!) I used canned chicken and served it in little pastry shells.  I think I used 3 boxes of shells - will get more next time since I had alot more salad than shells.

This was a good recipe. I couldn't follow the recipe exactly because I needed to use stuff that I had in my cupboards/fridge. So I did things a little differently, but that just proves it is a good base recipe and very adaptable. I also felt that there was too much mayo. Next time I would go with a 3/4 cup. I also chose to grate the onion and used only about 2.5 TBSP of grated onion. I also used cashews instead of pecans. Here are some substitutions that I made with stuff I had on hand. 
Replaced 1c grapes with 1c peeled, chopped apple. Replaced 3/4c chutney with some strawberry jam. Added a splash of lemon juice. Added a dash of paprika for color. It was yummy with butter lettuce on bakery rolls! I think it would be good in a wrap as well. Thanks for the recipe!

I used mango chutney as suggested, and shallot rather than onion.  Served over lettuce with rice and fresh mango.  Delicious!

This is a very unique twist on chicken salad. I took it to a Sunday Brunch party using the serving method suggested by Kim. Not only was it a beautiful platter, but everyone really enjoyed the flaky pastry shell idea. Thanks Kim!

My favorite chicken salad recipe! My signature dish at potlucks and cook outs, sometimes I add a head of sliced lettuce just before serving instead of using it for sandwiches or pastries. The recipe is so adaptable and yummy.

Yes, I did the photo of the dish. I tripled the dish as I am a huge lover of indian food, and so does my wife. Sorry though, the chutney made it nasty. Love the idea of curry in a creamy chicken salad though. Won't make again, tossed 15 bucks worth of food.

This curry salad is delicious.  I had a bunch of roasted chicken that I shredded.  I think Penzey's curry is really good and I added a bit more - probably 1-2 tsp. of it.  I ate a bunch right after mixing it - YUM.  I'm waiting for it to chill now and let the flavors meld some more.  Thanks for a wonderful summer salad.

Loved this! and so easy to make. I added fresh basil and toasted pecan pieces, and used Greek yougurt instead of sour cream. Great with spinach or lettuce in a pita; tastes very rich but really not too much fat! It's a keeper.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this - I make it all the time. It's delicious! You can easily swap up the add ins (different nuts, or fruit, etc). I like pecans and raisins, sometimes dried cranberries and walnuts - you can go wild, wild! Also have made it sans chutney when I was out and didn't feel like picking any up - I just upped the mayo a tad and once threw in a teaspoon of hot pepper jelly I had on hand. Not bad. Great recipe.

I liked this recipe, a good break from boring chicken salad. I made a few changs tho...I used lite mayo, sweet valdalia onion, 1/3 cup diced celery and I substituted hot mango chutney but reduced the portion to 1/3 a cup. The hot chutney kicked the whole dish up a notch and added a sweetness that enhances the curry. If your not sure about adding the chutney either seperate out a little of the mixed salad and add or add a teaspoon at a time to taste. I served this on whole wheat pita with alfalfa sprouts. Yum. I will make this again.

This was delicious, though I did make some substitutions. I didn't have pecans, so I used sesame seeds. I didn't have grapes (though I know it would have been delicious with them), so I cut up and added fresh avocado and mango which complimented the mango chutney very well. I also added fresh cilantro, thai basil, and a little mint...and I cut the mayonnaise in half. Finally, I subtituted scallions for the onions. YUM!

Yum! I searched for a chicken salad recipe that didn't have celery because I didn't have any and found this. I actually only had four of the ingredients - mayo, chicken, curry, and grapes and used onion powder for the onion, but it was delicious any way! The curry adds a nice heat (but not spicy) to the chicken, and the grapes an opposite cooling touch.

Awesome and easy.  I used two large cans of chicken and it was delicious.  My husband loved it!  I think it would be a great party food as mini-sandwiches or on crackers.  This one will be a keeper.

So, I was using the nifty ingredient search because I wanted to get rid of some mango chutney I had left over... I wasn't expecting much, but WOW! I doubled the curry powder and used craisins instead of grapes. This was fantastic. By the way, I haven't even served dinner yet, I was tasting it before serving it to my husband and nearly ate half of it myself!

I made this for a big party we had this past weekend and it was a huge hit. I tweaked it slightly - used raisins instead of grapes, and doubled the curry powder and onions. I used a mango chutney. Also, it should definitely be made a day ahead to let the flavors meld. At least 6 people have asked me for the recipe. I will definitely make it again!

I didn't have a whole lot of time, so I used canned chicken breast.  I'm allergic to mango, so I skipped the chutney and used the cherry flavored craisins as a sub.  I followed the rest of the recipe as is.  Very good - this made great chicken salad wraps (with lettuce) for lunch.

This was really good! I didn't have grapes but did add the rasins! that little hit of sweet is really great with the curry.  I love curry so I did bump up the spices a little. I served this for lunch in pita - was even better the next day after a little time to rest.  very easy!

This is awesome. I add extra celery, some raisins, used walnuts instead of pecans and extra curry. Outta this world!

This recipe was good. I used Orange Marmalade instead of chutney. It was way too sweet for my taste, so next time I'll only add half the amount. Also, I used sliced green onion for color, and next time will added twice the amount of curry powder. I'm looking forward to making it again. Yummy!

I used someone else' suggestion and only added 1/2 cup of mayo even tho the recipe calls for a full cup.  It was perfect and my husband thought it was "delicious."  Next time I will add a little more chicken and more grapes.  This will become part of my regular rotation!

WONDERFUL!  They aren't kidding.  I made this for my daughters' first communion luncheon and everyone commented on it and wanted the recipe.  Only change I made was substituting celery for the chutney.  Don't know where to find chutney, but it tasted so good without it I don't care where you find chutney.

This was really yummy even with light mayo. The sweetness of the grapes and chutney take the need away for the regular mayo. I will be making this again! Thanks!

I made this Chicken Curry Salad last night and used exactly what the recipe states except I used a half of cup of Mayo.  I don't like a lot of Mayo in my salads.  This is diffidently gourmet.  It has a island favor to it but the next time I will add a little kick.  Maybe Cayenne pepper or something but overall it was good.  It will also work wonderful in a wrap.

Although, I've prepared a similar recipe for years, adding the chutney, onions and pecans this time was a delightful flavor boost.

This is really good and very quick! I have used a rotisserie chicken in place of cooking my own, as well as eliminating the chutney (because I didn't have it on hand) and it was still great! Toasted almonds can substitute for pecans too! Yummy.....

Read the reviews and extrapolated for my palette.  Used Limonaise instead of mayo, pine nuts instead of pecans, cranberries instead of grapes.  Oh, and I did add extra curry.  Yum.

This was going to be our dinner tonight, but DH found it in the fridge and just made himself a second sandwich for lunch....he LOVED this chicken salad.  Used Perdue Short-Cut Chicken so no baking or boiling of the chicken was necessary.  I used mango chutney, more curry powder, and even added 1 Tbs. of hot curry paste.  We didn't have grapes so I threw in raisins...they were perfect!  Kim, this recipe was fantastic, thank you so much for sharing!

I bloomed the curry in coconut oil in a skillet for a minute before sautéing the chicken breasts. I saved the drippings and once the pan was cool, I added the mayonnaise and chutney and mixed well dissolving all of those tasty brown bits before adding the remaining ingredients.  This was an excellent recipe and now is one of our favorites!

Delicious!   I bought this at a bistro once and liked it so much I had to make it.  The bistro used raisins but the grapes were also delicious.   I added a tablespoon more mayo to get it to the consistency I wanted and the chutney was mango.  To cut down on time I diced Presidents Choice cooked fire-roasted seasoned chicken breast strips.  So good!

This is a one of my favorite recipes.  I do a variation that adds a little zing - I grill the chicken breasts with a little olive oil and a dry rub of garlic and herbs.  After refrigerating for 3 hours, I shred the breasts and then assemble the salad.

So I made this today for my Bible study group tomorrow and I'm pretty amazed at how good it is -as it is now! Can't wait to taste it tomorrow after the flavors marry! 
 I think my girls will be pleased. My hubby sure was as I tried it out on him – and he's a picky eater! (Too bad he can't have anymore of this batch!) ??
Thank you K Baker For the yummy post--i'm also happy to have a definite use for the chutney I canned last year. ??   
This one's a keeper!

This is now my go to chicken salad recipe. Everyone loves this. The key is finding great chutney. I love trader Joe's mango ginger chutney and always keep it in stock to use with this recipe.

Great recipe! Like others, I only added 1/2 cup of mayo, an extra TBSP of curry powder and skipped the chutney as I did not have any and it still turned out great! You can also substitute the grapes with craisins.

I have made this recipe several times over the past couple of months!

I've made this many times, and we love it! You have to like curry flavor, or you won't like this salad. It's just such a perfect combination of flavors. Sometimes I add more grapes than it calls for -- they add a wonderful sweetness. For the chutney, I use a sweet mango chutney, such as the one from Trader Joe's. Delish!

I make this recipe quite often everyone loves and ask's for this recipe. I make a few adjustments though, I use chicken thighs and I roast them. I also use Major Grey's Chutney and I omit the nuts unless I know who is eating this wonderful salad.
