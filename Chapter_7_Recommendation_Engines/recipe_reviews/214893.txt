Really good salsa; nice and fresh. EASY to make.  I put everything in the food processor and it was done in a couple of minutes.  I did use 2 jalepenos and that was a bit much.  You may just want to use 1 of those!!

I made this at the spur of the moment and did not have jalapenos, green bell pepper or fresh lime juice.  I added a squirt of lemon juice and some chopped garlic and it was really good even with all of my changes!

I used veggies fresh from my own garden & boy did this make a difference! Very, very good AND super easy. Little spicy for youngsters.

Yumm!! I have been finding ways to use up all my tomatoes from my garden and this is my favorite. I have been canning left and right and by far this is the best and easiest salsa I have made. I have added garlic cloves. Everyone loves it.

I followed the recipe exactly. I let it sit overnight and the next morning I took about a third out and put in food processor. I put the puree back with the rest of it and mixed it. Perfect blend of juice and chunks. I took it to our church Picnic and it won first place out of 8 salsa's. The judges ate most of it. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent recipe! I used the ingredients as a base, and sort of estimated & adjusted to taste. You really can personalize it, depending on what you like. I really enjoyed the flavor of the bell pepper in it, as I haven't made salsa with that before.

This is a very simple, easy, go-to fresh salsa recipe that is sure to taste good if you use fresh ingredients. Mine tasted great with almost all veggies from the garden. I eyeballed everything except the tomatoes (because I used cherry tomatoes and it was a little hard to tell how much I had). But seriously, just dump it all in a bowl and add ingredients until it looks right. It will taste fabulous!  A note for those interested in canning, I think you might want something where you peel and boil the tomatoes, as most canning recipes for salsa that I've come across use that method.

Fresh yes, but very bland.  Made it as the recipe called and was enthused by the high rating.  Disappointed in the end.  A jar of salsa from the store at the end of the street would have been better.

I followed the recipe almost as directed except I added a little more jalapeno because I like everything spicy. This salsa is GREAT!! I was going to take it to the party we're going to tonight, but I am keeping it for myself. I was hesitant to use the cilantro, because I hate the way it smells, but I can't taste or smell it in the salsa. Cheryl, this recipe is amazing. Thank you!!

This is probably the best salsa I have eaten...better than most mexican restaurants.  I make it in the summer and then freeze for the winter months.

Very easy to make and I have made this recipe several times, but I do have a couple of comments to make with respect to a handful of other reviews.  I do use my food processor for the tomatoes, but I highly recommend not using it for the onion or jalepenos.  It's nice to have a bit of substance to your salsa rather than all liquid.    I have made this salsa with and without cilantro depending if I had it or not and it is much, much better with the cilantro.  It is not an ingredient that should be left out.    In my view and those of most others who have tried the salsa I've made, two medium sized fresh jalepenos are either not enough or just right.  I've doubled it before and it gets to the point of just barely breaking a forehead sweat while eating it, which is what I like my spicy foods to do.

Read all the previous reviews before I made this and followed the advice of many to add garlic. A note to those who commented that 4 jalapenos was too spicy, read carefully and you will notice that the recipe calls for 4 TEASPOONS, not 4 whole peppers. Big difference, especially if you are serving anyone who can't stand the heat, LOL.

I made this with my own tweaks. I didn't have tomato, onion, cilantro, bell pepper or lime on hand. so instead I used a baseball, 1 banana, 3 blades of grass, a squirt of lemon juice, and a bottle of garlic powder. it was delicious! so glad they posted this recipe so I could try it!

This is the usual recipe for fresh salsa minus garlic, which most have added.  Just have to comment on Gramma Mary's review...salsa is NOT salsa without cilantro.  Unless you are using a 99 cent jar from the bargain bin.    That would be right up there with leaving apples out of apple pie or onions off a hot dog!   Just un-American.  LOL!

I made this very close to the suggested proportions. I used 2 jalapenos instead, seeding one. I also did not measure my lime juice, I simply juiced 1 very juicy lime into it. My biggest suggestion is to seed the tomatoes first as it gets watery if not.

This salsa is absolutely delicious. The Jalapeno gives a bit of "oomph" to it. Yum!

Oh wow!  I would call this perfection, but why under- rate it?  Simply put I love salsa, and this is the best I've ever eaten.  I made it with fresh tomatoes, and peppers from our garden.  Store bought onions.  I made a big batch this morning.  It's a little after 3PM and it's all gone.  As soon as I finish this I'm going to make some more.  Thank you, Cheryl  Dressler, for providing such a marvelous recipe, and also for solving the puzzle of what to do with our excess tomatoes.  I know where everyone of  them are going.  Many, many thanks.

loved it!  Just remember this is fresh salsa so it needs to be drained well before serving.  I did add another pepper though.

I made this without the onion, as I find raw onion - even red onion - to be quite sharp. My sister tasted it and liked it, but found it difficult to scoop up with a tortilla, so I put 2/3 in a food processor, and returned it to the bowl. It tasted great! I also later found out that I accidentally added flat-leaf parsley instead of cilantro. It worked well, and actually added a nice sort of sweetness to it. I will try to make a variation of this fresh salsa every time now.

I add a clove or two of garlic. I like smoother salsa, so I put all ingredients, except two chopped tomatoes, in a food processor or blender. Stir in chopped tomatoes to the mixture at the end for a little texture. May be frozen.

This salsa is super fresh and great for football parties! I made it for the Broncos game and everyone is a fan! I added a little more black pepper and lime juice since we like it that way but this recipe is a keeper!

I tried this recipe before and it's okay but, this time I put a little of my own spin on it. I used two Thai Super Hot peppers fresh from my garden (about 2 TBS). Added 1 tsp fresh ground dried Chipotle pepper and two large cloves crushed garlic.
After mixing the salsa I drained off the excess liquid into a bowl for about ten minutes. Then I poured the drained juice into a blender and added 1 cup of of the prepared salsa and pureed. Added this back into the salsa and stirred. For me, this made it a better consistency (less runny).
Yum,Yum,Good Stuff!

I added a bit of sugar to this salsa, maybe about a half teaspoon and squeezed in a little more lime juice than the recipe called for. It was delicious.

I have never made salsa before, but as I was about to grab a jar in the grocery I thought, why not make my own?  Thinking salsa would have green pepper, I included one in my purchases.  Lo and behold, practically every recipe had jalapeno and not green pepper.  (Odd, since I smell green pepper in the jarred stuff.)  This was one of the few that even had green pepper, so I chose it!  Very good.  Needless to say I didn't have any jalapeno, but I cheated and sprinkled in some of that dry pepper that comes in a jar. :-)  I figured I could add more heat later depending on the use.  Weird part is that I always cook with salsa and am not into using it with tortilla chips, but I ate some with chips anyway and it wasn't half bad - better than anything I've had in a restaurant.  But when I cook with it I don't like all the chunky stuff so the rest went thru the blender.  Later in the year when my neighbor is dumping tons of tomatoes on me and I'm tiring of pasta salads, I'll know what to do with them. :-)

This is a wonderful salsa recipe on its own. I have added garlic sometimes, and the results are great. I recommend scooping out some of the tomato juice, as the final product can be watery.

I have been looking for this recipe for several years.  I am addicted to fresh salsa and have been trying to duplicate the recipe that you find in authentic Mexican restaurants forever.  I finally found the simple list of ingredients to make my own salsa that is the best I ever tasted.  I do add more salt to my own taste, and I omit the hot peppers because I have small children, but other than that, I keep it the same.  This recipe is awesome and I cannot see how anyone would be disappointed.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Love this recipe! I have a Progressive Fruit and Vegetable Chopper and I have made two batches of it this week. I have eaten almost all of it myself! I didn't use the jalapeno either time and the second I added spring onion to the batch. I think the cumin, salt, pepper and lime juice are perfect and I like the consistency. I eat it with english cucumbers and rice crackers and it is simply delicious.Thanks for sharing!

We have had a difficult time finding a salsa recipe that we like, but this recipe was AWESOME! We've made several batches and canned them. The only thing we changed was that we used lemon juice instead of lime, since that's what we had on hand.

First time making salsa. Used tomatoes and an assortment of hot and mild peppers from my husband's garden. Added garlic and gave it a couple quick pulses in the food processor. Made 3 double batches and froze in 2 cup plastic containers. My husband thinks I'm wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe for the fresh tomatoes I have getting from all of my friends with gardens.  We don't like it too spicy though, so we only use half of a jalepeno with no seeds.  It is a little spicy to begin, but settles down to mild by the next day.  Yummy!

This is a very easy recipe for a mild salsa and tasty on lime Tostito chips, I'm thinking it will be good on a hamburger, grilled chicken sandwich, and even in a fish taco. It is good for the beginner and the maker can easily modify for their own taste.

A little spicy for my liking. I'd half the jalopinos for myself, but everyone else loved it. Firm, ripe tomatoes are a must. Delicious and fresh salsa. Corn could be added in if you like corn.

This was wonderful and so easy! I had a bunch of tomatoes that were turning mushy quickly and this was the perfect way to use them up. I don't normally add bell pepper to my salsa but did because they're plentiful right now. Great addition! Also added 2-3 loves garlic and 2 jalapenos (mostly de-seeded). My guests raved about it--will certainly make again.

4 jalapenos were way too many.  I had to add a large can of crushed tomatos and 1 can of diced rotel tomatos in order to make it able to eat for my family.  While I was at it I also added 3 or 4 cloves of chopped garlic.  A good base but next time I'll know about the tomato/jalapeno ratio.

I will give this 1 star as I have to.   I made this with all fresh ingredients from the garden (minus the fresh limes that I bought)    This was very bland.    I have to say that i was pretty disappointing.

I thought I would try a high rated recipe rather than the way I usually make it. Big mistake. This tastes like the crummy jarred stuff at any grocery, not like the nice stuff our Mexican restaurants make here in San Diego.

Skip the spices and the green bell pepper for something more authentic...and tasty. In this case simpler is better.

They only put salt in as a preservative...does not help it at all. Trust me, this is all wrong.

This recipe is spot on with everything except ONE thing: it's only 5-star (>5-star, actually) if there's fresh minced garlic, and for me, a lot of it... with the added garlic, I can eat this stuff by the spoonful... or mainline it? (Ok, that's a bit extreme, and defeats the purpose because then I couldn't taste it!) But seriously, with salsa this good, who needs chips?! Without garlic, though, there's definitely something missing.

Very good base recipe but I did make a couple of changes. It was too spicy so instead I removed the seeds from 3 jalapenos to keep flavor without heat then used 1 hot and 1 mild jalapeno with seeds to add in just the right amount of heat. Great spice wthout burning your mouth up! I also doubled the cumin and since I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, cut it hack to 1/8 cup. I also cooked mine on medium for 5 minutes for a good blend before putting in jars. Perfect salsa!

Made this, for the second time, yesterday, for a family gathering; it disappeared very quickly. I should stress that this is a FRESH tomato salsa and I learned that the hard way. I'd made an original batch a day ahead and refrigerated it with poor results. The taste was good but the texture of the tomatoes suffered in the 'frige overnight. 

On its own, there's only a little heat, the jalapeno provides a little bite, but it's not over powering. If you like a mild, fresh tasting salsa, this is for you.  That said, this recipe is easily modified with, pretty much, anything else you want to add. Corn, beans, a hotter pepper, or combination of peppers, additional spices, whatever.

Sara was right - this is a very good base recipe, easy to personalize. I didn't change the ingredients, just the amounts of each for more flavor and spice.  Yummy!

followed directions as written with the only exception I added 2 jalapeno's and 1 cherry hot pepper w/ seeds!  I like my salsa spicy. I would never thought to add cumin to salsa- that made a huge delicious difference. I also scooped out the seeds from the tomatoes and used mostly the outer skin-makes the salsa less watery!!!!. Tks for the recipe!

Used this recipe for my first try at salsa and it was a delicious success!  Being in a hurry I tried putting my tomatoes in a blender instead of chopping and they were too runny.  For the cure I simply poured them into a large strainer over the sink to allow the excess liquid drain.  It worked well and now I"ll used that method to cut down on time since I have an overabundance of tomatoes in my garden this year.  I will be making a number of batches with this recipe while my tomatoes and hot peppers are still producing :)  

Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

I just made this, sticking close to the recipe.  I added a scant splash of Worcestershire.  I used 1 whole jalapeno with seeds and one seeded.  Since I like spicy, next time I'll use two with seeds.  But it was good right out of the box.  It's now in the fridge allowing all the flavors to meld.  I'll see if I can keep my hands off it for an hour or two.

This is delicious. Would like to know how the person who canned it did so. There is so much,
I'm afraid it will go to waste. Will make this many times.

I use countless recipes from this site, and I always have a tweak or two of my own.  This recipe is absolutely flawless as it is. I make a large tupperware twice a week and put this on 1 or two meals each and every day! Thank you so much for sharing Cheryl.

This was a GREAT base salsa recipe!  I had several tomatoes on hand that needed to be used up and a variety of hot peppers.  It's great because you can really personalize the recipe to your taste as far as heat and spice go.  I love garlic so put in 2 fresh close of garlic and had lots of green onion on hand so put in 2 of those.  It turned out delicious!!!  Like other chefs out there I was supposed to take this to a potluck party but as soon as my husband got home from work it was gone in about 5 minutes.  Delicious recipe!!

We Love it. Best recipe I have found for fresh salsa. I add a little sugar because we like it sweeter. Can as some tomato sauce if making it from store bought tomatoes to add taste. Make it every year. This freezes excellent. I have canned it but the fresh crispness seems to go out of it,(still good though) but frozen was almost as good as fresh! I

Easy to do. Great as a snack at any time of the day. Super healthy. I substituted the bell pepper with finely diced cucumber, added some tomato puree to give it some body/volume and also added sriracha to give it some fire. What I never did with my previous attempts was add the cumin. That really brought out the "mexican" in it. Leaving it to cure so the flavors can meld is also a good idea. Probably best to make more than one 5 cup batch. 

I give this bag of salsa a few hours before it is totally demolished!

It took me 25 min to make whern I got up, only thing I didn't have was jalapenos, but I like my salsa mild. but I put everything in recipe in it, but I did add lime zest and minced garlic, 2 cloves, Also I put some red pepper flakes in a grinder(Dust)and added that.

very good recipe thanks, but the comment to the person says its bland, I have one question, did you taste while you made it, or did you go by recipe. you always have to add more salt.

Made this recipe twice, the first time just as the recipe calls for. Because I loved it, I made it again but decreased the jalapeno and doubled the cumin and salt to add more flavor. Now it's perfect for my tastes! So glad to have found this recipe.

It is yummy as is, but is really easy to customize to your individual taste.  The prep is very easy in a food processor.  I add the cilantro, garlic & hot peppers first to chop extra fine.   I prefer to add a variety of mild peppers and spice up with extra hot peppers and a 1/4 TSP of cayenne red pepper.  Also, I add slightly less lime juice and a little more salt.  I usually make after a trip to the Farmer's market.

This is a great basic recipe for salsa. You can add and subtract to your own taste and heat level. I use parsley instead of cilantro. Red onions make it a bit sweeter. Leaving peppers unseeded increases the heat significantly. I had an abundance of grape tomatoes and although it was a bit time consuming I used those and I may do it again. They tend to be firmer in flesh and less mush. I also seed my tomatoes for all salsa. Making several hours ahead of time gives the mix time to marry and mingle flavors.

That's simple Pico De Gallo. Should taste great. Salsa is more liquid than chunky. Pico De Gallo can be added to almost any dish for a little pick me up of flavor.

This is a great recipe - make it all the time in the summer.  I typically leave the bell pepper out.  I always chop everything in the food processor to make it quick.  Just pulse in the processor a little to chop.  It gives you some liquid which I like but not too soupy!!  Good and healthy - can't beat it!

I seeded the tomatoes and used a food processor. Next time, I'll simply chopped them as per the recipe because it looked like tomato puree. The taste however was awesome! Used it with shredded chicken tacos ( sour cream, cheddar, frank's red hot) and it was very good! Thanks!!

I've made this several times now, great results each time. I leave out the jalapeno, and if you're in a hurry you can substitute petite diced tomatoes from a can, it tastes just fine.

I've also experimented with pureeing it, it's good that way too, though I like it a little more chunky.

Note that 5 cups is a LOT of salsa unless you're having a big party!

This is a great salsa, I did add 3tsps of minced garlic and the jalapenos I used were sliced from a jar(because I had so many).  After juicing my lime I also added some of the pulp from the lime, yum.  Then I let it sit for a day. I did put half in my bullet, so I had some chunky and some smooth, both good, my daughter liked the smooth better.  Pretty easy to make yourself and it taste much better than the jarred.

I just wanted to add my recommendation for anyone who likes a little sweetness: Instead of green bell pepper I roasted red bell pepper- it made it naturally sweet!!! I also roasted a whole jalapeno and removed most of the seeds to suit the crowd's heat tolerance

This is really good. I followed it exactly and this was too spicy for me as is but it tasted so good I ignored my screaming taste buds and kept shoveling it in. It's that good. Best thing about this is its really easy. I did purée extra to mix with something later on. Most likely chicken and cheese.

Added 2 cloves of garlic and put it through the food processor since we don't like chunky salsas. My family DEVOURED the bowl-- it tasted so fresh, unlike the bottled salsas that have vinegar in them. Will make again soon!

Great recipe!!  I used all ingredients from my garden and it was easy and the PERFECT blend of spices.  I did not put jalapeno peppers in because I'm not a fan of spicy things and it is delicious.

I loved this salsa recipe as did my husband and daughter! I did however have to use coriander in place of the cilantro(for I had none at hand). I also made a second batch and mixed it with a 12oz. tub of nacho cheese I got at Dollar Tree!

Sounds great, I'm probably making it tonight or tomorrow. I just wanted to ask and/or state that you could always substitute red pepper flakes for the heat (this might tone it down a notch, and for those of us who don't own a food processor, you won't have to hand cut hot peppers!). If you do end up cutting the peppers, or using the seeds or whatever, make sure you use gloves! My boyfriend and I like garlic, it's a nice addition. You can really use this as a base and add your own flavor. Great recipe!

Our household likes it hot! So, we added 3 jalapeno peppers instead of one and 1 tsp ground red pepper instead of black pepper. We also added extra cumin because the flavor wasn't strong enough and I used coarse sea salt. Minced in food process and it was wonderful! Will DEFINITELY make this again! Thank you!

This was just ok for me. We like spicy, but this was right at the upper end of being able to enjoy. I am trying to duplicate the awesome fresh salsa at the local authentic Mexican restaurant, and this is not it. In summary, too much heat, too much onion (and I love onion) and missing something.

Love this salsa!  My friend made it with produce from her garden - orange tomatoes instead of red.  It was delish!  So now I have made it and it's just as good - although I do think the orange tomatoes gave it a little something extra...maybe just in visual?  I followed the recipe to a T - but took half the onions, a bit of the green pepper, all the cilantro, and all the jalapeno -and mushed them with my hand held mixer.  Then added it to the chunky salsa part.  It is so so good!!!
*****
2nd time I made this I did the chopping and dicing and doubled the recipe.  I did do the jalapenos with the smart stick and some of the tomato/onion/green pepper mix.  I will NOT do this again.  If I do this again - note to self...de-seed the jalapenos.  I thought I was going to die - the jalapeno went up my throat and nose and burned!  So de-seed this.  Next time.

This was great!  I made this using fresh veggies from my CSA and I think I will be making my own fresh salsa using this recipe from now on!  I made this to take out on the boat one hot afternoon and it was a huge hit.  It was a light and delicious snack (that wound up getting passed around the beach for everyone to try)!

This was exactly the fresh tomato salsa I was looking for!  I didn't have green pepper or jalapeno so instead I used red and yellow (yellow makes it sweet so might not use that next time), red pepper flakes, and cayenne pepper.  Yum-mee!  Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to make and very delicious! I think if you add some roasted garlic it would be even better.  I'm lookin to learn how to can this since I have such and abundance of veggies in my garden.

This makes a great pico de gallo. I omitted the green pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This has perfect portions of each ingredient.

Too spicy.  I used a jalapeno from my garden.  I would add 1/2 of the amount called for.

This was a good basic recipe that you could add your preferences to.  Definitely better after being in the refrierator for a day or two!

I have never successfully made fresh homemade salsa. . . until now! I forgot to add the jalapeno and it was still delicious. Just the right amount of lime, salt, cilantro and tomato. Extremely pleased!!

I made it. But confused. I dont remember ever eating salsa with raw onions. They're always cooked. Are you supposed to cook this mixture? [Addendum:] Put everything in the food processor, the taste is out of this world perfect! Just add diced tomatoes to the puree and it's ready to serve and impress.

I added 1 Tbsp chopped garlic from the jar, 1/4-1/2 tsp chili powder and used the "fresh" cilantro in the tube from the grocery store approximately 1 Tbsp or use to your taste.

Most definitely will make again. Made as directed. Very yummy!  Nice spiciness...and we like spicy. Of course, it's going to depend upon the jalapeno.   Used fresh picked tomatoes, peeled (cut x in bottom, 30 sec in boiling water then immediately dunk in ice water) and squeezed out seeds.  Think next time will be a little more aggressive in squeezing out seeds/liquid.  Froze some  to see how it does with that.

I made this recipe with home grown tomatoes. I followed the recipe, except I tripled it! It made 5 quart jars. The first day 2 jars were already gone!! It was super easy, refreshing, delicious and a hit with the family. 
I’ll make this again and again!!

I took the seed s out of the jalapeño only because the person getting it couldn’t have the heat.  Otherwise I made the recipe the same it was yummy.

Great salsa - was pretty watery at first but I think that was because of the tomatoes I used.  I think in the future I will salt and drain the tomatoes.

I loved it and considered giving it a 5!  Mrs. Micamus thought it was too hot.  The jalapeños from our garden this year are hotter than normal.  

I will be making it again!

I love that I had almost all the ingredients I needed, in the garden. The only thing I changed, well not really changed but added, was a tiny bit of garlic because I'm a garlic freak lol. such a fresh, easy and delicious salsa!

I basically followed the recipe as is, but I put the vegetables on the grill first and gave them a little grilling first, to get some smoke flavor into my salsa (and burn off a little water so it's less juicy) and it worked gangbusters.

I doubled the salt, pepper, and cumin for more flavor. I also added a few cloves of garlic. Instead of a green pepper, I used a poblano. And instead of jalapeno, I used serrano for more spice. I’ll probably add another serrano or two after I enjoy some more of this, to finish it off with some serious heat!

was excellent without green bell pepper and cilantro. For those people who said it was bland, you just need to make sure you use fresh cumin and add a bit more salt and pepper to up the flavor and then it's amazing!

My wife and I have been making this frequently for years now. We love it except we add garlic and do not add cumin, but that is just our flavor preference.

This recipe is great!  I left out the bell pepper, only because I'm not a fan of them in salsa.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was a hit.

I added a half granny's Smith apple and some garlic. The apple masked the heat and I'm just a freak for garlic. Wonderful easy and can be served as is or thrown in a food processor easy enough.

Followed the recipe exactly and had it chill in the fridge overnight and tried it the next day and couldn't eat it. Used fresh tomatoes from my garden too,  what a waste.

I put this in my food processor and mixed it all up and kept adding what flavors I liked the most of all of this. I didn't have any jalapeno's so I added a tiny dab of ghost pepper sauce. Tiny because you can always add more and it's strong.  I don't think I added all the onion but it was fine and I love onion. My friends and boyfriend loved it. So healthy.

I have used this recipe many times and it is always a crowd pleaser. Super easy but the trick is using heirloom tomatoes. I use several varieties. Fresh lime juice and cilantro give it that extra kick.

The salsa was very tasty!  We omitted the spicy peppers and substituted mild green chilies along with using 1/2 t. of hot sauce.  This gave us a mild salsa with just a little kick.  Also it was a great way to use our fresh green peppers & tomatoes right out of our garden.

This turned out very good! I was happy with the outcome. However I made mine with poinsettia peppers instead of jalapenos and red and yellow bell peppers instead of green.

I don’t like cilantro, but I used it in this recipe anyways. If you don’t like cilantro, you’ll find the cilantro a bit overpowering. I think I would use half of what this recipe calls for, or I’d use parsley. I used 2 cloves of garlic. Otherwise I followed this recipe to a tee

Such an easy recipe. I made 2 different batches of this. It turned out great. I was making it with school children, so I didn’t put in the jalapeños. The kids loved it with tortilla chips. I added jalapeños for Home & it was great for my husband & I.

I make this all the time with fresh tomatoes and jalapeños from my garden. It always gets rave reviews!  I add garlic, but I love garlic, otherwise it’s great as is. My only advice is that it’s way better the next day after the flavors meld.

Pulled fresh green peppers, jalapeños and a variety of red and yellow peppers from the garden. I was looking for a simple, “fresh tomato” recipe online. This one came up and it was perfect. Did not add cilantro; substituted lemon juice for the fresh lime. All in all? Delicious. I used slightly more jalapeño. It had a healthy “kick.” We’ll make it again.

HOLY HOT!!!  If you don't like hot stuff, then you will need to make changes to this recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly. Instead of the 4 tsp jalapeno it called for, I probably put in 2.5 tsp and it was still WAY TOO hot for my husband and me.  Except for the excessive heat, we really liked all of the flavors!!  We would make it again but either eliminate the jalapeno altogether or drop it down to only 1 tsp  and perhaps reduce the amount of black pepper to see if that contributed to the heat problem.  Per other reviewers, I did add some fresh minced garlic but made no other changes to the recipe.

I used garlic, as suggested by previous cooks, and I remembered to drain the tomatoes before adding other ingredients. I was pleased with the salsa, but I did think it a little too bland for my taste. I omitted the jalapeno seeds, which may have been a mistake. Next time i will include them. I plan on using this salsa for fish tacos, which should be excellent.

Very, very good core Salsa, I kicked it up a notch with a home made 3 pepper hot sauce:)  Put half of tomatoes, in blender, added 1/2 of another large tomato and pureed, left sit a while and poured off juice.  Added 1/2 of onion and fresh garlic to reduced tomato puree and re-pureed.

Thickened it up a bit.  Yummy.

Let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Flavors and heat will meld.  Heat will settle out.  I make this double batch twice a season with Roma tomatoes.

added a few chopped mangos too. Split the tomatoes between fresh and canned to give it different textures.

Very good, not too hot,  with fresh tomatoes.  Added more salt and could have added more jalepeno, perhaps more garlic too.  Cumin is a good flavor addition.

This was delicious. I made several tweaks and those being that I added 1/2 teaspoon of Salt, 1/4 teaspoon of minced garlic (equivalent to 1 clove), and instead of stirring, I placed everything in the food processor. It almost didn't make it into the jar before my family gobbled it up! After reading some reviews I think I will process 3/4 and stir 1/4 next time to add some chunkiness. Thanks again!

Made this with garlic instead of cumin, only because I didn't have cumin on hand.  Good as is, however I heated it in a sauce pan until the onions(red) soften a little and all the flavors are really released.  Then added a little corn starch slurry to thicken slightly.  Let it cool, then into the fridge for a couple of hours or overnight.  That's just what I prefer.  It was great!

Love the fresh flavor. I can't do sort so I use Mrs. Dash and that was fine. I like spicy hot food but the jalapeño that I use must've been super hot. I just added some honey and it seem to take some of the heat down a notch or two. Overall the fresh flavor  and my ability to take the sodium down was worth the effort.

I Liked that it was made with all fresh ingredients. However, since the reviews indicated it was a bit bland , I added 1 1/2 times the jalapeño pepper and it was very good. Everyone loved it.  I made 2 recipes for my group of 33 but it did make it around for seconds.

Season to taste.  What a waste.

I made this a couple of times now. I adjusted for 10 servings. That's what I like about Allrecipes.com they do it for you. 
It was a nice compliment to our quesadillas.
Someone said they used garlic. That sounds like a good idea.

Only 5 stars if you add a few cloves of garlic....and people, don't leave out fresh cilantro!  That's what makes salsa salsa!  Read the recipe regarding the jalapenos....it calls for teaspoons, not whole peppers.  I left out the seeds because they are just too hot for us.

This was so easy to make. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden, I used dried cilantro and ground cayenne powder instead of Jalepenos peppers. I don’t like a lot of heat but by adding just a few dashes of cayenne powder at a time I was able to control the amount of heat. After I finished eating this batch I immediately made another batch and froze.

Bowl-licking good!! This will go into my recipe book. I am not sure if the recipe calls for red or yellow onion, but I went with yellow to add a little sweetness. I did not have green bell peppers, so I used 3 sweet peppers. However, it wasn't as mushy as my husband would like it to be, so I added 1 tbsp of tomato paste for texture and slight tanginess, and chopped 2 small avocados into this and it was THE BOMB! My husband loved it and the bowl was clean!

Loved this recipe. I did go very light on the cumin per other review.  Home grown toms in my opinion are a must. Used store bought cilantro simply because I had it. This is easy to make and worth it.  A keeper for sure.

I roasted my pepper and added garlic and fresh basil. I think next time, I will do a dash of garlic salt instead of fresh minced garlic.

Eveeyone liked this salsa. You could spice it up as much as you like or keep it mild. I subbed sweet yellow pepper for green pepper and only used 1/2 onion. I kept all the other spices the same and it  was a nice balance.

I make this after having corn on the cob the night before. I save on corn to shave off for the salsa. Adds a nice taste and texture.

This recipe is fabulous!  I used roasted poblano peppers instead of jalapeños just because they were what we had growing. Easy and reaaalllly good!  It was gone in an afternoon.

Delicious! Made just as listed and used my food processor. It can certainly be touched up to just about any taste. Next time I'll try a different kind of pepper, but only because I want to experiment.  My only problem, and I'm sure it's because of my food processor, is that it turned out a little too liquidy, so I think I overdid it with the processor! My bad! Would try to make it a little chunkier next time. Thanks for sharing!

No cumin for me - the cilantro and the salt makes this -  -Can't even eat jarred salsa anymore.  Tequila Mockingbird Restaurant in Ocean City, Maryland makes this salsa this way also (no cumin) it is the best!!!  Definitely making it again and again!

Very easy to make!! Loved it!  I left my tomatoes a little chunkier and  I did cut back on the jalapenos because mine were so hot but definitely  will try  with more next time.  I've had variations of this recipe over the years and the key is FRESH garden tomatoes and fresh cilantro.  Always the best salsa!  We ate leftovers as a side dish to grilled grouper.  Delish!

Delicious and so fresh! Will definitely make again and would double recipe, we ate this so fast! Also, used a whole jalepeno which was more than the 4 teaspoons, could even use more jalepeno to make more spicy.

It's a good recipe. I added more cilantro and also added a couple tsp of minced garlic. I omitted the salt, since we don't usually add sodium to our foods. I think, as with any recipe, you can adjust the spices to your liking.

AWESOME! I was a bit skeptical because I'm not a big salsa person. I followed the recipe and added extra bell peppers and jalapeno. To add in more of a kick I added paprika and tapatio (a hot sauce). Will definitely make again! I was really surprised of how well it tasted. It's a great snack.

I was not a fan of salsa but when a friend served it last Easter weekend, I got hooked to eating it with chips.  I started to take home any that's left-over at my workplace when sales reps brought us lunch and now I decided to make it myself and picked this recipe.  I was not really able to follow the exact recipe because I just happen to not have the exact ingredients. I used yellow onion, 1 whole jalapeno (without seeds, my preference for it to be less spicy, and all the time I thought I need 1 jalapeno until I reread the recipe now), added a little bit of pineapple juice (heard that friend say she adds pineapple juice to hers) and added the salt, pepper and cumin to my taste's preference. At first, I thought it was a failure for not following the recipe or  not picking a good one?  It seemed a bit watery (maybe because of the pineapple juice) and was frothy and not reddish but the taste was ok at first.  But when my husband tasted it (who is such a picky person), he said it's really good and it has a kick to it etc.  I told him he was just being nice because he's trying to please me for making me unhappy over something.  But he did love it, I even froze a small jar of it last night thinking I would end up eating it myself and I had to thaw it this afternoon for he wanted more. It's all gone and now we are getting ready to go out to get more ingredients for me to make triple recipe.   I am so happy with this recipe, will be following  it this time (but "maybe" I would strai

You can chill the heat by lessoning how much jalapeño you add plus don't add the seeds as that adds the heat too. I sometimes switch out the jalapeño with either sereno pepper which is milder or chile pepper when available seasonally.
Whatever pepper you use, wear gloves or don't touch your face after cutting.

This was beautiful! I used lemon juice because that's what I had, and didn't add any heat, and yet it was still full of flavour. I'll definitely make this again.

Really great recipe. Modifications I made: I roasted the jalapeno to give it a bit of a smoky flavor, removed half the seeds, and blended in a medium sized green chili for a bit of a different type of flavor/heat. I also used fresh tomatoes - didn't want to use canned for "fresh" salsa :)

Yeah this is really easy and tastes good. And you know what else this is? It's great for making guacamole! Just mash up some avocados and add some of this to it, correct the salt, and you have some fantastic guacamole.

Really tasty and fresh, but like many cooks I worked with what I had on hand and combined them with a hand blender. I used all garden crops: regular-sized tomatoes and about 3/4 cup cherry tomatoes; one Italian green pepper (kind of like a long, sweet bell pepper); and two sunset peppers (nicely hot). Probably the biggest change I made when preparing this salsa was using curly parsley because I didn't have cilantro. I know salsa purists might disapprove, but using the homegrown herb added a strong, bright flavor to the condiment that both my husband and I loved.

I used yellow bell peppers because that's what was in the garden.  They added a sweet flavor.  Skiped the Cilanro.
I'm about to make it again.

Very good. Mine had a lot of liquid. I wonder if I drained the chopped tomatoes for an hour or so before adding to other ingredients if it would be better. Maybe use Italian tomatoes? Thanks Cheryl.

This salsa is so good!  As with most recipes, I adjust the seasoning to my liking.  Increased quantities of 1 full lime juice, 1/3 cup cilantro, 1tbsp cumin, and added 1tsp garlic salt.
1 jalepeno is plenty to give it kick.

Delicious fresh salsa! I followed the recipe with the exception of omitting the bell pepper (because I did not have one) and adding 4 cloves of garlic.  3 cups of tomatoes is roughly 300g so weighed all my tomatoes, approximated the other ingredients and combined it all in the food processor.  Viola super quick and delicious salsa.

I really liked this recipe.  I added garlic, and a bit more salt then recommended, but it was delicious!  We ate two jars in one week and put it on everything.  I feel like the cumin really adds something that some of the other recipes lack.  It was very fresh.  I diced my tomatoes because I did not like the texture and foaming of the tomatoes in the food processor, it took a lot of time.  It tasted hot the first day but wasn't as hot the next, and it tasted better a day or two later also.

Followed the instructions exactly.
 Took an hour to chop and mince by hand. That was not the issue because I like preparing the old fashioned way.
The outcome is very bland. I might suggest adding garlic and much less cumin.

I thought this turned out fabulous, the flavors on my tongue are still kicking!  I kind of eyeballed everything using all the ingredients listed.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic.  For the jalapeno, I seeded half the jap and used the other half with the seeds.  Perfect amount of heat!  Thanks for sharing!!

Simple and easy and very tasty!  
Son rated it one of the best he's tasted. 
I used garden ingredients tho! That might make a difference.  However with that said, I'm a cook that doesn't follow to the detail.  Pretty close tho....

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly as instructed.  I didn't use jalapeños and only had a lemon and not a lime.  Also, I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of fresh.  I just threw everything in my food processor and it was ready in no time.  I did tweak it a little to my liking and it tasted even better after refrigerating.  I got lots of compliments and plan to use this recipe again.

Great flavor.  I made a triple batch and refrigerated the leftovers.  My family loved the flavor.  We like it a little spicier, so for a triple batch, I used 6 jalapenos.  I used my handy chopper from Pampered Chef to do the onions and jalapenos. and hand chopped our garden fresh tomatoes.  Great way to use those tomatoes that you harvest that have cosmetic problems, are split, or small bug bites.  I even used our Sweet 100 cherry tomatoes in it and our yellow pear tomatoes.  YUMM!!

This is a good base for making salsa and can be easily tweaked to your own taste (i.e. add more or less jalapeño etc...).  I will use less cilantro next time...I found that the amount  requested was a bit overpowering for my taste.  I also added a little garlic powder and extra tomatoes since I have an abundance from my garden.  Like others suggested - I made this in the food processor which cut down on prep time.

We like it. This is a basic salsa recipe. I added fresh garlic and used a Serrano pepper instead of jalapeño because we like it hot. I don't think it's salsa without cilantro so that is not an ingredient I would leave out. The longer you let it sit the better it melds together.

I'm a salsa snob and loved the fresh taste of this salsa.  Didn't have enough fresh tomatoes so adding some petite diced canned tomatoes and it was still great.  Added juice from one whole lime and doubled the cilantro.  Highly recommend!

I'm chowing on this right now. Incredible stuff. I made it to spec with the very slight addition of a couple cloves minced garlic. The only negative thing I can say about this salsa is that it's lacking heat. Of course, that's a matter of taste, and this salsa is branded as "freshest", not "spiciest."

Mental note: next time, more heat. Thanks for the recipe; it's going to be a staple in my home.

I used less salt since one reason I don't like store bought salsa is that it is too salty. All I had was frozen, chopped green peppers and they tasted very good in it. I also ran it through the food processor since we wanted it to be less chunky. We loved it.

Not too bad. I have a weak mouth for spice but I thought it could be a little hotter. I used what the recipe called for and mine turned out a little sweet.
Was easy to make and used a food processor.

I used home grown tomatoes from my dad's garden, chopped in a food processor. Added all ingredients suggested (except jalapeno was nowhere near hot -- not even spicy), but didn't really measure, plus garlic -- LOTS of garlic -- it was delicious!  I may have wound up with more tomatoes than recipe called for.  I added more salt.  I will make again, but will will add more jalapeno!  Just a warning: It will not taste like commercial, store bought salsa; it will be much, MUCH better.  In just a few hours, it was gone.  I'll have to make more tomorrow.

It was quick, easy and good! Used tomatoes from my garden and a green pepper. I did not have jalapeños so I used jar jalapeños and cut some up. I also used a yellow onion. I do not like fresh cilantro so I used some dry cilantro. I love quick and easy recipes, so this was a hit with me. I did not want to make a whole batch so I cut the recipe in 1/4.

I first sautéed the onions, peppers and jalapeños. I prefer it to be more tender. I then added the cumin, salt, pepper and also some paprika. Let the sauté cool down. I gutted the tomatoes to prevent it from being too watery. And finished everything as was. I also add at the end fresh garlic (3 cloves)

Yummy. It is so simple but scrumptious.  I used a food processor to make it even easier.  My husband loved this.

Best salsa recipe! I do have to admit though that I substituted the cumin for garlic powder as I thought cumin was not the flavor I wanted in my salsa.

I loved this recipe.  I omitted the bell pepper because I didn't have one on hand. I used half of a very large red onion and felt that was plenty.  I must say, using tomatoes from my garden really makes a huge difference to the overall taste - the tomatoes are a lot more flavorful. I used 1 fresh jalapeno and thought that it was enough heat. I also added 4 cloves of garlic - because I love it!  Super easy to make - I threw everything in food processor, and it turned out amazing!

Very good base that you can tweak to suit your taste. I added two cloves minced garlic, reduced the lime a bit, tripled the salt, and used four jalapenos with seeds. With the jalapeno, to me, it came out mild to medium, which I liked. It also depends on how spicy your jalapenos are.

Excellent salsa. We are on a diet and using as salad dressing. I changed salt for Mrs. Dash (any flavor); I used parsley and Italian seasoning instead of cilantro. Added crushed fresh garlic and celery finely chopped.  I have made it twice so far, and the second time doubled the recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I made the original recipe, but made changes to taste. I used the juice of one juicy lime (more than 2 T., I think), 1 tsp. cumin, and 1 tsp. salt. I nixed cilantro because I hate it and bell pepper because  I thought it would take away from the rest of the flavours.

This is a great way to use bruised or split tomatoes.

I was a little hesitant about adding bell pepper to the salsa but decided  to stick with the recipe and make it exactly as specified. I made it 3 hours ahead of time and it came out delicious. I recommend this recipe as it is simple to make and very tasty.

I just made this for lunch to go along with my grilled pork chops and it's amazing! I just made a FEW changes, I used lemon juice in place of lime ( have to go with what you got ), I added some gracamole, and just one and a half jalapeno. Great stuff!

Excellent base for fresh tomato salsa, just what I was looking for. I halved the recipe because as is, it makes enough for a whole party! I just needed enough for a 3-person family that doesn't eat a ton, and the batch I made lasted about 4 days.

I used a mix of tomatoes from my garden: cherries (sungold, black cherry, sweet million), and somewhat bigger types (super Sioux, Polish dwarf). Mostly I used the bigger ones for more flesh and juice, because the cherries have lots of skin and seeds. I think the kinds of tomatoes you use will definitely change the flavor you get. IE, bland supermarket toms probably won't yield good results.

Next, I used a red bell pepper instead of green for extra flavor. Green is good too, I did try it that way, but we prefer red in this house. Also used one Black Hungarian pepper (red and fully ripe) instead of the jalapeno; it is similar in heat but tastier, I think. You might use more than one if you like it hot.

Used garlic powder but will try fresh minced garlic next time. Used purple/red onion, as recipe doesn't specify which, and I think it works great here because it's sharper and bolder tasting than white. For the lime juice, here is a hint: cut a lime in half and microwave for about 20-30 seconds. This helps the lime release more juice when the fruit is squeezed. Great if you've been keeping your limes in the fridge.

If you want a smooth, restaurant-style salsa, use an immersion/stick blender or mix it up in a food processor. By using

I thought this salsa was very tasty and easy to make. 
I have never added bell pepper to my fresh salsa and I found this to be a very nice addition.
I did add garlic salt in place of the regular salt, but that was just a personal taste. I like garlic in my salsas.....Of course your salsa will only be as good as the tomatoes you are using....
Sometimes they are picked too soon and they have very little taste. You can use canned diced tomatoes, drained and it is just as good.

This recipe is delicious! I love the cumin, adds just the right flavor I have been missing in my (very similar) recipe. The reviews stating this is bland, add another jalapeno, more salt etc. to your preferences. We all have personal preferences, easy to adjust to.

Can you say, "bland a mundo?"  After trying it I  added garlic and one more jalapeno, and it began to come to life!

I am so happy to have found this recipe! It's simple & fresh. And I completely agree that it only gets better as the favors meld. I like it as it is, almost like a base. Over time, I've adjusted it a little to my personal preference. I'm not a fan of cilantro, so I skip that. I love me some garlic, so I add in minced garlic. If the jalapeno wasn't as spicy as I'd like I shake in some ground cayenne. Perfection! This with some homemade chips and your guests will be licking the bowl clean!! ;) Thank you!!

This is a good salsa recipe but to make it GREAT I substituted 2 things. Used Anaheim peppers instead of jalapeno peppers. They have so much more flavor and not as hot. Next, I'm not a big fan of cumin in my salsa so I use California Chili Pepper. Once again, much more flavor.

I was looking for a homemade salsa recipe to use in chimichangas since I'm allergic to jalapeños, and every store bought jar contained them. I just substituted green chilis in this recipe. The result was amazing! Even my "hardcore heat" friends commented that it was a perfect combination, and still had a bite to it. I did add the garlic that other reviewers suggested, and didn't process it very long to keep it on the chunkier side. One time, in a pinch, I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, and although it wasn't "fresh", it was still yummy. This is my go to recipe, now, anytime we make mexican. Thank you for sharing this recipe, Cheryl!!

Excellent Salsa.  I used fresh ingredients from my garden and used red Serrano peppers instead of jalapenos and added a sprig of fresh chopped Mexican Oregano.   I also blanched and peeled the tomatoes.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a pot-luck for my son's high school band.  It was a hit!

I made it without changes and loved it! Of course, you have to have really good tomatoes, or don't bother. Will definitely make again, very easy.

Made  this and it was a hit! The only con for me is I was hoping for more of a salsa consistency. To me it was more of a pico de gallo, which I love, but was really craving salsa. Wonderful flavor!

This recipe is a good base but the cumin is simply overwhelming; and this is coming from a person who loves cumin!  It was also a bit salty.  To compensate I used 3 garlic cloves, another jalapeno WITH the seeds, additional lime and black and kidney beans and also a tablespoon of raw sugar.  Next time I will decrease the cumin and salt by half and made the same additions to see what happens :)

I was skeptical about this recipe, because I don't really like cumin and I thought the green bell peppers wouldn't be good in it. I tried it anyway, and I'm glad I did! It's way better than any salsa I've ever made or tasted! I used all little yellow pear tomatoes from my garden and jalapeños that had turned red. It was very colorful, but more importantly delicious!!!

Loved it. Used lots of fresh cilantro from my garden. My husband took half the batch and put in extra hot peppers. Yike! It's a man thing. 
Will have this as my, go to, recipe every year.

This is the best fresh salsa EVER!!!  I have been trying different recipes for the last five years and there isn't one that comes close this. I double the recipe and am still making it twice a week. My husband says it's better then any of the Mexican restaurants we go to. Thanks for sharing it.

Loved this! I did make a few changes, some out of necessity. I was out of cumin, so I used some organic chili powder and chipotle chili powder. I also used a few cloves of garlic, minced.

Use serrano peppers (w/o seeds & in a blender) instead of jalepenos and a mix of fresh green, yellow, and red bell peppers. It was a hit! Very good.

Just made this.  Very easy but too bland.  I doubled the recipe, used 3 jalapeños which I felt, based on reviews, might actually be too much, and added garlic.

Loves the fresh salsa taste.  We do not like hot salsa so I didn't add the Jalepeno peppers...did add additional Kosher salt because the original recipe left the salsa bland but the salt picked up the flavor.    I put in some extra onions that also enhanced the flavor.    This was an exceptionally easy recipe.  
I also canned my salsa so I added 1/4 Citric Acid to each pint jar to help the tomatoes keep their beautiful red color.

I love this recipe and use it every time that I make salsa now. I skat the ratios of the ingredients (more lemon, salt and spices) and I also substitute the cilantro for an herb in my yard called Philippine oregano(Coleus aromaticus Benth ) it's a tropical succulent herb and an extremely easy grower.

Added 6 cloves of fresh garlic, 1 cup of grilled corn on the cob off the cob and extra fresh lime juice. Substituted a yellow pepper for the green. I did two jalapeño peppers. (We like spicy but next time I will only do one.) It's really spicy with two. All but tomatoes (which I diced very small by hand) done in food processor. Garden fresh. Good base recipe. Make it your own. Enjoy!

So delicious and fresh! We didn't add seeds from jalapeño and still has a little kick. Also drained tomatoes before mixing all together to make more of a chunkier salsa. Yum!

I loved it, as did my hubby.  This was a great way to get rid of the overflow of tomatoes we have from the garden.  I used freshly picked tomatoes, green pepper and jalapenos.  For the onion, I used red onion as I think those have so much more flavor!  The lime juice is what makes this so good - when I've made salsa in the past I usually left that out.  Finally, the tomatoes have enough juice, so I chose to chop up the veggies by hand and skip the food processor.  I like a chunkier salsa!  :)

Excellent simple and fresh recipe.  We like hot so added a variety of peppers.   Left out the green pepper....not to our taste.

I have made and like this recipe as is It is on the mild side. However, yesterday I made this with veggies from our garden. My bell peppers were small, so instead I used a huge poblano pepper with seeds. I decided to use a whole Serrano pepper, no seeds, instead of a Jalapeno. Well since we like spicy hot, this was perfect. Either way is good.

This fresh salsa IS the best!!  I've made it about 5 times in the past month now using tomatoes and peppers from my garden.  Everyone who has tried it has loved it.   This is the first time I've made salsa with Cumin and I think that's what really brings it all together.   I do add my own special ingredient though.  A little bit of Italian dressing! (My fave is Wishbone)  I have always done this with homemade salsa for some reason.

I  added a chopped habanero But otherwise was pretty faithful to the recipe. Mine came out quite hot and very very good! I took some of that basic recipe salsa and put it in a separate bowl with two fresh chopped Georgia peaches.The peachy salsa is really tasty as well. My mouth is very happy right now :-)

I thought it was good.  I used a very small amount of pepper because I don't like anything too spicy and added Goya Adobo all purpose seasoning which gave it a nice kick. So if you make it and still think it needs something extra, try the Adobo seasoning that might help, also try serving it over chicken fajitas or with fish tacos; it adds a nice fresh flavor.

Very good salsa! If you follow the recipe, this salsa is not bland. I used 3 jalapeno peppers and kept the seeds from only one. If you used all 4 jalapenos with seeds, this salsa would be very, very hot!! Otherwise it is fresh and tasty and ready in minutes. A food processor helps.

Just made and it is wonderful! Did not add the cumin, but did add a clove of garlic. I made 2 batches, one with the amount of jalepeno recommended, and one milder batch with half the jalepeno. I did use a food processor, which made the salsa a litle more melded together, and less like pico de gallo.

Really great and fresh recipe. The only changes I made was to add garlic as per other reviews, approx 2 fresh garlic cloves, fresh garden ingredients and 1/2 fresh jalapeño pepper. We usually like medium to hot store bought so with 1/2 the pepper it was at the hot level. Fabulous recipe and a keeper. Thanks!

Excellent recipe, the measurements and proportions were all perfect.  I made one change in that i chopped everything tiny and by hand except for one half of a large tomato which i blended up in the vitamix with the cilantro to get the cilantro fine and so that the finely blended tomato would bind the salsa together.

Always a smash hit, and I never change a thing about this recipe...unless I plan to have some too - then it's only 2 teaspoons of Jalapeño! This year, I'm growing all of the main ingredients myself in the garden, and every batch tastes like the magical labor of love that it is!

I haven't made my own salsa before, and I thought this turned out OK. Like many reviewers, I thought it needed some garlic, so I added one minced clove. The recipe didn't say to, but I removed some of the tomato seeds; I think I should have removed more, as mine came out pretty watery. It tasted fine served with gucamole and chips and chicken fajitas. I will proably try a few more salsa recipes to find the right mix we like.

This recipe is DELICIOUS and very spicy. I added one small jalapeno and my mouth is on fire! It should not be fed to the faint of heart or small children of you choose to add the jalapeno. I also added more lime than called for to give it more taste. It was a bit bland without it. Now I cannot stop eating it.... it hurts so bad, but its tastes sooo good

This is very good salsa. I do not like cilantro, but I can not even taste it in this recipe. I used purple bell pepper from the advice of the merchant at the farmers market because it reduces reflux and it is sweeter than the green bell pepper. I also added fresh corn.

Just threw 3 big tomatoes, a medium green pepper, a jalapeno, 4 garlic cloves, pepper, salt, large onion, cilantro, half a lime, and some spices in the blender, then blended. Tasted great, it made a blender full.

This was so easy, I can't stop eating it. I used the whole jalapeno, and no seeds. With the cilantro and jalapeno combo it had plenty of heat. I think I will jar this and give it out for Christmas gifts!

Very good but it is not spicy enough. All I did was add a 2 serrano peppers and a habanero. Then again, I like spicy.

Delicious. Did put everything in the food processor for the more cantina-like consistency. Biggest recommendation is to let it sit for at least an hour to let the flavor develop more. Will make again!

I love freshly made salsa and this recipe is a good one that can easily be adjusted to one's taste. I chopped up a couple of large garlic cloves and a large seeded jalapeno. (To keep the spice off your hands, wear latex or vinyl gloves while seeding hot peppers.) I also used roma tomatoes - they're meatier and less watery than the regular variety. Put everything in the food processor and had fresh salsa in 5 minutes from start to finish!

Husband and I went to the Produce Market today and they had very ripe tomatoes, fill the bag for $2. I asked him what in the world was I going to do with all those tomatoes? I found this recipe and made it. WOW I should have tried to the jalnepo's before I made it...its hot!!Good thing he likes hot. Needless to say we didn't find it bland at all. Will make again but will not make the jalepono mistake again.

Super easy and tasty!  I didn't use cumin because I'm not a fan, and no bell pepper because I didn't have one on hand.  It came out great...reminds me of the "On The Border" homemade salsa.  Yummy!

Great and super quick and easy! I reduced the recipe to one jalapeño for medium and half for mild. Used the blender on "chop" which works great.

Very tasty.  I wasn't sure about the bell pepper, but I had a very mild purple one, so I added it.  It's a nice addition. The recipe as instructed makes more of a pico de gallo vs a salsa.  I chopped everything first and then gave it a few pulses in the food processor just to purée it a touch without completely destroying the texture. Much more salsa like in texture and delicious!  I halved the recipe and it still made a ton. I used only one T of the jalapeño and found the spice to be at the correct level for us.

Add:

1 tsp sugar (really brings out the taste of the tomatoes)

2 cloves garlic-slice each in half lengthwise and remove the bitter cores first. Crush or toss whole into food processor. 

I also added 1/2 tsp. Penzey's Chipotle spice and a half stalk of celery.

I've been making this salsa for several years, and it is still the best in my book! Can't go wrong with this one and easy to adjust to taste. I usually do half a cup or more of cilantro and add one or two cloves of garlic. Yum!

I just tried this recipe and I love it, never would have thought to add the cumin....different taste. I used dried cilantro because I didn't have any fresh...I also mistakenly added 1tsp of each of the seasonings instead of a 1/2tsp. But, it turned our good. I am going to definitely add this to my recipe box.

This is delicious!  As other reviewers recommended I added a dash of garlic powder.  I also used a yellow bell pepper instead of green and 1 jalapeno and 1 habanero.  I think I personally would've liked even slightly more habanero.  It is very very watery and I did take out about half the tomato seeds and yucky water parts, but next time I will take out all the mushy parts of the tomatoes.  Great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I followed the recipe on the jalepeno and it was perfect, which is to say a little spicy...medium+.  I also followed the advice of some reviewers and added a little garlic...one clove for a 1.5x batch of salsa.  That was just enough that you could barely smell and taste it - again just right in my book.  I went light on the onion and used half red onion and half green onions.  We put half in the food processor and definitely liked it better than the chunky-style.  Will definitely make it again!

Made this today and love it!   I left out the cilantro just as personal preference.  This was my first go at fresh salsa - had too many tomatoes to eat, not enough to can so the amount used in this recipe was perfect.  Warning ... this salsa is addictive!   Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Cheryl!

Great recipe. I used canned "Diced" tomatoes and found them fine. Put in a little more cilantro and added some Tapatio hot sauce. Can't stop eating it.

My son christened it "superdelicious".  Green pepper adds a nice touch. I used about a teaspoon of canned chopped jalapeno. This is the only thing that I feel is an individual preference.  All other amounts are perfect!

MMMMM! Such a yummy fresh salsa.  We didn't have bell pepper, but next time will add it. This is such a delicious, basic recipe. We mixed it up in our vitamix.

Very good! I used tomato, onion, jalapeno, and lime from the garden. I added 4 garlic cloves, used more spices. I put the tomatoes in the food processor for seconds so it still had chunks then used a small electric chopper for everything else. I find myself draining the liquid before using or serving. It freezes well. It's a keeper!

It was too spicy.  Reduce the jalapeño.  I am looking for a milder salsa that is kid friendly.

Definitely make a day ahead. Much better the second day, as somebody else noted.  I suggest you make it once as written, sample it the second day, and see if you want to change anything.  We enjoyed the salsa, which had mild heat that did not overpower the other flavors.  I did soak chopped onions in water for 5 min (to reduce pungency) before adding to salsa.  Although the recipe is great as it is, next time I will add some garlic.

Turned out pretty good. The best salsa i've made so far, but still not the "perfect" salsa.

This salsa is amazing! I like my salsa hot, so I used 3 jalapenos. Make it a few days ahead of when you want to use it because when I tried it on day 1, it was just okay. Now that its been sitting for a few days, I think it might be the best salsa I've ever eaten. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I removed the seeds from the tomatoes to make it less watery. Very good salsa!

I like this recipe very much, but suggest a whole poblano pepper instead of the 1/2 green pepper. It would increase the flavor without adding much heat. And I'd put everything in the blender instead of mincing and chopping. But I love a fresh classic salsa.

Well this is probably the best fresh salsa I've made so far.  For a basic tomato salsa, this is awesome!  I've never added the cumin before, but I think it has a huge impact on the overall flavor.  Great recipe!

Wow!  Best salsa ever; I couldn't stop eating it!  Made it just as the recipe called for only used about 1/2 the amount of onion.  A keeper for sure!

I add some garlic because we like it and I do not use the green pepper, since we don't like that. I raise my own Heirloom    tomatoes so like to use some that ripen green, yellow, purple to add to the visual impact
