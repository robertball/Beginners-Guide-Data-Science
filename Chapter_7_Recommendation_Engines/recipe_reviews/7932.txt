I made this cheesecake for Easter for my inlaws. They enjoyed it! I really like how this cheesecake is different from others, and that it is nice and light! This cake may not be for everyone (in taste) I loved it and so did my husbands family!! Will be making it again soon!!!

I used the basic recipe and method, but subbed many ingredients according to what I had on hand. I love the lighter  texture! It's easy, accurate, and I can't wait to try it again using different cheeses! my subs - I cut the recipe in half, used ginger snaps for graham crackers, 1 T Lemon peel and 1/4 t ground ginger instead of vanilla and almond, Montamore ( semi-hard with a sweet parm flavor) instead of swiss. I used 1 c custard cups, topped with sliced pears, a twist of fresh ground black pepper and a few chopped walnuts before baking. 325 for 30 min. No additional toppings after.  Y. U. M. !!!!!!  The texture and different cheese flavor is exciting! Next I'm going to see how well they freeze... Thanks for a great recipe that I'll be "playing with" for a long time! :)
