I did make a few changes ....like left out the vegetable broth & just used the coconut milk. Didn't use the kale...think you could substitute any vegetables...I used carrots broccoli & didn't have an instant pot so did it in the oven....loved the taste & so did hubby...would do it again!

I made this on the COOKTOP in a large frypan. Easy and so quick. Just follow the recipe to the saut√©, use fresh garlic, cut the Kale and broccoli florets small, top with two portions of salmon, cover. The salmon poaches, after 2 mins carefully flip over to finish, add coconut milk, stir carefully, poach a further 3 mins or until broccoli cooked.

Not bad. My husband liked it and he normally doesn't like salmon. I liked everything but the salmon.
