I Made this recipe for a party and it went fast. I did not have the required pan so I used my regular pie pan and it turned out great.  I layered the apples like the picture and sprinkled almonds and it looked very beautiful. Some skins I left on for looks.

I needed a last-minute dessert recipe for a family get together.  I had apples and cream cheese on hand, so I gave this a try.  Wow, what a hit this was.  8 adults and a toddler took care of the whole thing.   Preparation was a snap, and it was really great, with a buttery crisp crust and a smooth tasty filling.   I overcooked mine a bit, so keep your eyes on it and remove it from heat when it just becomes set.

This was very good- take it out at the time it says though- don't keep it in longer otherwise the crust will come out a little to hard-I have made this twice now and it is great and pretty easy to make!

Wow! I'm not a cook, so wanted something easy- and this was great. To make it more nutritious, I mixed ground flax seed meal into the crust. I also zapped 1/2 cup pecans in mini food processor and mixed them into the crust - made it delicious and crunchy. I had a few tablespoons of ricotta cheese that I mixed in with the phillie cheese - so I had to cook it a little longer - but I absolutely loved the flavor of the two cheeses. I used apples, a plum and a pear on top (leftover fruit) - didn't have any almonds to add - can't wait to make it again!  thanks for sharing!

OMG! This recipe is fabulous! I didn't change a thing except to leave off the almonds as my husband isn't a huge fan of them. It took a little longer to cook and the smell was divine. When it came out of the oven I couldn't resist topping it off with a warm caramel sauce - just a little. I must say the smell from the oven was definitely an indication of how it was going to taste. This was gone in no time at all.  Very easy to make, but looks like something that came from a bakery!

Holy cow, is this good!!!!! I had some apples and a block of cream cheese that I wanted to use up so I put those in to the ingredient search and this recipe caught my eye. My 7-year old loves cream cheese-based desserts and he loves apples so I knew this would be right up his alley. I did have a bit of difficulty spreading the crust into and up the sides of my springform pan. It kept sticking to my fingers. But I could have been a little off with the flour, you never know. Anyway, I persisted and this came out absolutely PERFECT!! It looks like you could have bought it in a bakery and tastes like it, too.  As we all neared the end of our slices, the sound was almost comical. All you could hear was each of our forks scraping the plates as we all tried to get every last bite :) The crust is delicious, the cheesecake filling is yummy and the cinnamon-sugar apples on top make a beautiful finish to one absolutely awesome dessert. The only thing I changed was I omitted the almonds as we are not big nut-eaters. I truly cannot believe so few people have tried this recipe. My husband already told me to make sure I put this in "the binder"...only true keepers go in there! Give this a try, you won't regret it!!! :)

This recipe should win the prize of "easiest but most impressive dessert."  I followed the recipe exactly with amazing results--it looks and tastes like I picked it up from a bakery!

This is absolutely delicious! Like another reviewer, I made mine in a pie pan instead of the springform pan. It came out perfect.

Took this to a party last night and everyone talked about it.  The look was impressive and it tasted great.  Others had issues with possibly cooking too long... with my oven I think it needed just a bit longer.  The apples were not soft enough.  I have a 9 3/4 springform pan, so I covered the bottom with the crust (and did not go up on the sides at all).  Way pretty, way yummy.

This recipe is awesome. Everyone loves it when I make this! I cheat and just use a store bought graham crust and it still turns out perfect. Also, I toss the apples in a little brown sugar, and a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon. :-)

I made this with 1-1/2 bricks of 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it needed to bake an additional 5 minutes.

This was excellent!  I added a dash of nutmeg to the cinnamon and sugar mixture and gave it that extra flavour.

I made this recipe to take to a family gathering for Thanksgiving. It's very similar to one I've had for over 25 years, except my recipe has double the cheesecake ingredients and it's made in a 8-inch springform pan (so more like a cheesecake than a torte). I did use all the apples as they are the centerpiece of the recipe, and a great ingredient to use lots of in the fall!

This is one of my favorite dessert recipes. I use whatever apples I have on hand and sometimes omit the almonds if I don't have any available. Delicious and very impressive looking.

Awesome dessert - I received lots of praise for this one. The only thing I did a little differently was that I didn't have the almonds, and it looked like it needed something to garnish the top, so I drizzled caramel ice cream topping on top. When I make it for Thanksgiving, I'm going to try walnuts (which I prefer over almonds) AND the caramel.

By the way, I saw a comment about having difficulty spreading the pastry in the bottom, so here's a tip: Lay a piece of wax paper on top then use your hands or a spatula to spread it out evenly on the pan.

Perfect. Made it almost exactly as written, but didn't have almonds and added a teeny bit more vanilla. So tasty: sugar cookie meets cheesecake and cinnamon-y apples. Can't go wrong. Thanks for the recipe.

This was ok.  I felt the crust was good but needed something - maybe some ground almonds?  I also added some almond extract to the filling.

Delightful dessert enjoyed by my family. I did substitute almond extract for the vanilla and would try some ground almonds in the crust as well next time. Lovely dessert.

This is one of the best desserts I've ever made!  So rich and creamy!  I have made it three times now, and everyone I've served it to raves about it.  I've changed up the almonds on top with candied pecans, and every time topped it with a caramel sauce.  I'm making them and giving them to friends as a Christmas gift, a great alternative to Christmas cookies!

Pretty yummy.  Bring your cream cheese to room temperature for a smoother cream cheese base.  Pretty easy to make too and it looks impressive.

Outstanding. This rivals any dessert I've had from any bakery.  The apples were a little crunchy, but were so tasty I ate them first, then enjoyed the cream cheese and crust combo by itself.  The flavor of the crust reminds me of shortbread - YUM! This will be a favorite to keep, and maybe try with different fruit toppings.  I think raspberry would be wonderful with the cream cheese layer.

The pastry itself is excellent- be sure to use real butter, not margarine.  It takes on a browned butter flavor that is delicious.  I will definitely be making this again- my family went nuts over it!

This was amazing... I made a little more of the crust because I was using a 10 inch springform, and instead of tossing the apples in cinnamon and sugar, I just sprinkled the cinnamon on top and cut the sugar in half and sprinkled that on top too.  Really delicious.

This is really good. Very easy and simple to make. My son made the filling while I peeled and sliced an apple I only needed one apple because I made this into mini tortes instead of one large one. I had some mini graham cracker crusts I needed to use so I used those. I didn't have sliced almonds so I just put one whole one on each torte. When I served them I drizzled a little bit of caramel sauce over them. Will make again.

Not too heavy, not too sweet.  Just right following a big meal.  I would suggest doubling the crust if you want it up the sides of the pan.

I made this as a second dessert at Thanksgiving and got rave reviews on it!  It looked so good one person even asked if it came from a bakery.  After reading some of the previous reviews I decided to slice the apples thin so they would cook and they were perfect.  My only mistake was letting the crust get a little too thick in the "corner" around the springform pan.  Next time I will push more of it up the sides.

Wonderful dessert! I'm sure the recipe is great as is, but still made following changes: Added ground flax seed and ground almond to the crust, and added ricotta cheese to the filling. I only used 3 granny smith apples as I cut them very thinly. I baked at lower temperature for longer time to get the apples more tender. Still not fully cooked, but good enough. Great presentation for sure! Oh and I baked in 8" pan to get the sides go up a little bit more. Both the filling and crust are delicious!

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it! I had a bit of an issue with the crust staying together when I spread the filling, but it came out just fine. And I ended up only using 2 apples....4 seemed to be too much.

SO delicious!  This recipe was very dimple to make with a fantastic outcome.  My husband was doubting the look of the crumbly crust mix when I pressed it into the pan, but the shortbread crust was perfect!  One of my guests asked to take home two pieces.  Highly recommended!

Exellent flavor, just the right about of sweetness.  I had pears on hand to use on top-- they turned out good but were still a bit too crunchy after 35 minutes of cooking.  Next time I'll slice my fruit thinner I think.  Overall VERY delicious.

I adore this recipe as well. I've made this several times now, and while time consuming when working with a 5 year old, totally worth it. As is, it is fabulous. I love almonds, so I have made it with adding a little almond extract to the cream cheese mixture The last time I made this I did one with almonds and one with chopped pecans. I also use light cream cheese with great success. 
What I did change was the pan I used. I use a 10 inch tart pan with the scalloped edges which looks really nice. I got them from the dollar store so that if a pan gets left behind, it's no biggie. 
Definitely try this, my family begs for this!

Wonderful!  I don't have a springform pan, so I used a regular pie pan and it worked great.  I also used a little more almonds than the recipe called for.  Everyone loved it and several people asked about the crust because it was so delicious!  I also doubled the cinnamon.  This recipe is definately a keeper. It's not at all difficult, just a little time consuming if you have to peel, core, and slice your apples.  Plus, once it comes out of the oven, it is so hard not to cut into in, but it is well worth the wait to let it sit in the refridgerator for a few hours.  Loved it!

This tasted pretty good. It has a sweeter than normal crust, which wasn't my favorite.  However, it does have a very delicious cheesecake layer and a layer of lightly sweetened apples which I liked. For the apples I just used gala, because it is what I normally have. I cut them about 1/4", because it didn't say. I wanted to make sure they cooked all the way through. I might reduce the sugar a tad in the crust next time, if it will work, for personal preference. I would also line the springform pan with parchment, as my crust kind of stuck to the bottom. I did find that setting the cheesecake out at room at room temperature did soften the crust some to cut more easily. This dessert looks very impressive for how easy it is to make.

Made it last night.  Followed recipe very closely, but to switch it up a bit with the spice, I reduced the cinnamon and used some freshly grated nutmeg, freshly ground cardamom, and powdered ginger in addition.  I also baked in 8 inch pan, by suggestion of another review to make a deeper torte.  We couldn't wait the 3 hours to chill.  Once it cooled from the oven, we cut and dug in. Yum!

I originally made this recipe many times years ago from a leaflet of Philadelphia Cream Cheese recipes and was glad to find it years later here on All Recipes. It's very easy and one of the best cheesecake recipes ever--everyone loves the combination of flavors. I usually make one and a half times the recipe and use a 9 or 10 inch springform pan because I like the cream cheese filling and crust to come up a little higher on the sides--the amount of apples can remain the same as the original--but finely chop them, don't slice them. You will probably need to bake it a 10-15 minutes longer to make sure the center is set. I had several people tell me this was the best dessert they'd  ever had at the last potluck I took it to.

I made this on a whim because I have a few apples on the edge. I added about a 1/4 tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla, and used chopped almonds in top. It was amazing!! I brought it to work and it didn't even last 30 seconds. Judging by the sounds of approval and satisfaction as it was quickly consumed, I think they liked it.

Wonderful!  I added about 1/4 c finely chopped almonds and a dash of almond flavoring to the crust.  I think I'll use this crust for other pie recipes.  The crust is what makes the torte!

Wonderful recipe, except for the amount of cream cheese being 8.8 ozs.  I used an 8-oz block of  lite neufchatel plus 3 additional tablespoons.  I've made it several times now and it's always a hit.

Wonderful and easy recipe. I made it for a work gather and one coworker said "I want to roll around in this forever". I did make a few minor changes. I used only three apples. Mine were a mixture of types and because some of them were a bit sweeter, I only used about 2 Tbsp of sugar with them instead of a third cup. I also left out the almonds because I don't like almonds.

I followed the instructions just as written, with one tiny addition! I chopped up about 1/4 cup of almonds very fine and added that to the crust. I sliced my apples very thin, as some other reviewers had suggested, but I did need to cook it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for to see that the middle was set. Could be a difference in oven temp, but something to watch for. This was sooooo delish and looked beautiful! Everyone loved it. I'll absolutely make it again!

This is a wonderful recipe!I did not have the proper pan so I just used a pie plate and it turned out perfect. The crust is amazing! And I like that the apples still had a crunch to them. Will be making this again soon.

I made mine in a 9" springform pan and I doubled the recipe for the crust and the filling. I didn't use all the crust batter  but just enough to make a thin layer on the bottom and an inch + on the sides. I did use all the filling. I cooked it for about 50 minutes and it came out perfect. I have also made this topped with cherry pie filling being careful to not use much of the syrupy part, but just mostly the cherries. To top my torte with these enough cherries took about 1 1/2 - 21 oz cans.  It's a very impressive dessert with little effort.

One of my favorites!  Cross between Cheesecake and Apple Pie!  I steam the apples a bit before I put them on the filling, this always gets rave reviews and is super easy to make.

I make this ALL THE TIME. This is my go-to for potluck type events. But I make 2 changes from what is listed here. I do not use almonds at all. And I add 1 tablespoon of Disarrono to the filling when I add the vanilla.  

Admittedly, I have also made this with a variety of different apples as well. I find that anything with a medium texture is best, nothing mushy and nothing too hard. I would also recommend a moderately sweet to tart apple, not a really sweet kind for this.

We absolutely loved this recipe! Loved it so much that we finished off the entire thing in one sitting!!

It was extremely easy to cook up. I loved the crust, I’m thinking of doubling it next time so I could get more. 
The flavors were just right. I didn’t change a thing. I only added nutmeg to the apples. I also left it in the oven for 20 mins then turned on the broiler for 5 mins, Just to brown the apples a bit and make them crunchy.
A definite keeper.

I MADE THIS TWO TIMES OVER 3 DAYS. Lol

Three times in a week.......wow!!

This is a FABULOUS recipe and really easy to make.  I made this exactly like the recipe said except for one minor change.  I added the zest of 3/4 lemon to "Part one" which is the dough that you spread into the pan.  (I may try adding some almonds to it next time also)  It was delicious!  I will absolutely make this again for party's that I attend.  My husband normally doesn't like crusts but said this one tasted like a cookie.  
I also think  you could substitute any other fruit that you can bake in this recipe.  Peaches, blueberries, plums and blackberries come to mind.   This recipe is a keeper!  LOVED IT!!!!

Loved it! All the guests at the party raves about it and said I need to bring this dessert to the NYE party every year! Someone else brought a store-bought tiramisu cake and only 1/4 of it was eaten. None of my apple torte was left. This recipe is a winner! Especially for how simple it is to make!!

Allrecipes is my go-to resource.  Philly Bavarian Apple torte has been a family favorite for years.  When I was travelling, my family asked me to make it but I did not have my recipe handy.  So happy to find it online.

Made this to help use up a bunch of apples I had. Big hit with my whole family!
I made 1 minor tweak and swapped out plain cinnamon for pumpkin pie spice. It was awesome!

Wonderful dessert! The richness of the shortbread crust comes through combined with the nice balance of apples and cream cheese. I used a can of apple pie filling(Lucky Leaf)  as a shortcut, but still added the sugar and cinnamon. This is now on my favorites list!

I've been making this dessert since I was married 35 years ago.  I bake it in a disposable foil pie tin and I omit the almonds. I find it's best to push the apples down a bit into the filling. This is my husband's favorite or I should say, one of his favorites ;)

This was absolutely delicious! However, the crust seemed a little hard. But, a great recipe overall! Thanks!

Perfect recipe. Makes a wonderful dessert. I didn't have any cream cheese on hand, but some " yo-cheese" ( home made plain yogurt ,drained), and it worked out really well. Also used Gala apples and only a total of 2/3 cup of sugar. Might try substituting some brown sugar for the white next time as other reviewers have done. I found the baking time stated in the recipe just right.

It turned out great! I didn't have any freah apples, so I used apple pie filling. I also drizzled it with caramel before serving. It was quick and easy, will make again.

Made no changes, I had a few problems with the pastry, don't have much pastry experience, tried to roll the pastry, & kept sticking, was very warm in my kitchen, so put it in the fridge for a while, tried again & failed, in the end I flattened bits at a time & formed it together to make a pie case.  it looked ready after stated time, but the juices from the apples was still bubbling on the top, so wasn't certain if it was definitely cooked, so left in oven for 5 extra mins to make certain crust at bottom and cheese would be cooked. Turned out perfect, except base was a little stuck to the pie dish. Prized it off & maintained most of the crust at bottom intact. Pastry was crumbly, crusty & buttery, apples yummy. Took this to work for colleagues following day, serves with fresh cream. Was a hit.

This recipe is amazing.  I needed to feed more people so I made a recipe and a half of crust and added 1/2 cup of ricotta to the filling. (Also added a little almond to the filling..SO good. - Left everything else the same.)  An apple peeler, corer, slicer makes this recipe a snap!-

This was so good and really easy too!  I used a 9 inch tart pan.  Added a 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to the filling. That alone brought it to a higher level.  It is very important to thinly slice the apples to make sure then get cooked.  Also, I saw by the pictures that some, if not most, arrange the apples on the top.  I was not so careful.  Just kind of dumped them on the top and smoothed them out , then sprinkled with almonds.  Very pleased with the results.  Bakery quality, for sure.

This turned out so well! I didn't have almonds but I threw some drops of almond extract in the cream cheese layer and it worked fine. Like some other reviews mentioned the crust isn't quite enough to go all the way up the edges so you may want to increase it so you get about a quarter cup more, it came pretty darn close though. Making this again for sure!

I loved this! I added ricotta to make it even creamier and didn't use almonds. I used a pie plate and next time I will spray it better because the crust stuck a bit. Also, I made it a bit too thick at the  crease edge so I'll thin it out that way I don't get a chunk of crust in the crease of the pan! I used two apples and still had leftover so I'll also know to place them tighter together. I'm making this for our Christmas Day dinner so with the knowledge of my first experience, I know this will come out perfect! The taste is fabulous... Like another reviewer said: shortbread meets cheesecake meets apple pie!! Fabulous :))

Great recipe!  I made this for a brunch I prepared for some girlfriends.  Very easy to prepare and delicious!  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and that worked fine.  I also added about 1/4 tsp almond extract to the crust and it was subtle but very tasty.  I will make this again.

What an easy delicious desert!!! I was tired of Apple Pie and Apple Crisp and wanted something new. This was easy and everyone loved it. I did change the Vanilla for Almond extract and added a handful of almonds to my crust. What a great addition!!! Now people request this all the time. A+++++++++

Yep- this really is as good as they say.  I used mostly splenda for the sugar and light cream cheese.  Golden delicious apples sliced thin- 4 average sized appled allowed for about 3 layers or nicely placed apples.  This is a light dessert- kind of thin- If preparing for more than 6 adults, I'd double it.  Tried a piece as is and one with caramel drizzled over the top.  I didn;t think the caramel was necessary. It's just a simple, easy dessert.  Even hubs loved it and he's usually a choc/pb kind of guy.

Wonderful and easy!  I sometimes skip the spring form pan and make it in a pie pan and it turns our just fine.  My husband can't wait for the for 4 hour cool down time, so we've ate it as soon as an hour later and it was still yummy!
