Simply the best dressing.  Better tasting than using croutons from the store.  I made a few changes.  I added 1 cup raw sliced mushrooms and substituted 1 Box of brown and wild rice mix (Rice a Roni Natures Way)for the brown rice.  Served with cornish game hens.  My husband said it was the best meal ever.

Sorry, I thought this required a lot to be so tasteless.  It was really bland and tasteless.

I made this for Christmas dinner this year. I thought it would go well with cornish hens I made. It was yummy, but it was a bit flavorless...too much effort for it to be so flavorless. Also, I will not being making with with the white bread...it came out in big, soggy chunks that pretty much ruined it! I am glad that I only used 1/2 loaf and substituted the rest with Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Bread Crumbs. I will make it again, but with no white bread at all and all PFSBC. And of course, tweak the seasonings so that I can get a better flavor. It was a hit with my family. But I do not recommend using white bread at all!
