Didn't like this one bit. Ate a few bites and that was it. Reminded me of when years ago, I made mashed potatoes with chicken broth. Remember those ads that said replace your water with chicken broth. That is all you could taste.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I used homemade chicken broth, which might be what made it so good.  The garlic/thyme seasoning with the olive oil makes it a great side-dish for any Italian meal you may be preparing, but in my case it was served alongside BBQ chicken and was great.  I haven't tried this, but next time I might add a bit of grated parmesian to every layer....

We really liked these potatoes.  We did not think that they were oily at all.  I did reduce the recipe to make for 4 servings so maybe that would make a difference, don't see how but you never know.  The only thing that I would change with them is to use fresh thyme rather than dried as the thyme didn't soften up so much and we got some little dried sticks while we were eating.  Other than that, great recipe.

Extremely oily and can only taste the thyme! Will never make this again.
