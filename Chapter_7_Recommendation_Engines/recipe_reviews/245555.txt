Scaled down the recipe but it was fantastic! Reminded me of the coconut shrimp I had in Hawaii! Served it with sweet chilli sauce for dipping

There is just the two of us and I only had 1 pound of shrimp so I scaled the servings down to 5 and made as written from there. I did substitute beer for the club soda as the recipe submitter mentioned in the footnotes. The battering process got a little messy on me but the overall taste was good. I ended up needing a lot more coconut than the recipe called for but other than that this worked out fine for me.
