just finished making this, all I can say is Mmmmmmm yummy!!!!! I doubled the recipe, used the full pack of cream cheese, it filled 12 small tart shells, and made 6 small popsicles. Can't wait to eat them hoping they both turn out great, would suggest adding more strawberries, can be made with any fruit too.

very yummy!!!!! Instead of using the whipping cream, I made one batch with cool whip, and one batch with Reddi whip...the cool whip batch was creamier, the reddi whip was lighter...both were great!!  Please use the almond extract, it makes this pop!!  I served this as dessert to a group, and even the picky ones loved it!!!

I made these with fresh strawberries and they were amazing!  I doubled the recipe and added a little extra cream cheese because the recipe called for just under a package.  Don't forget the almond extract, that is the secret weapon in this recipe.

This was really delicious and easy! I doubled the recipe and followed the advice of other reviewers by using a whole 8oz brick of cream cheese but it was too cheesy for my taste so next time I will just keep it at 6oz. I used Graham Cracker Crust recipe from this site and it paired very well. I can't wait to try this recipe with other fruits...blueberry, mango, pineapple, etc.

Added Raspberry preserves to the bottom of each tart. Excellent combo of flavors.

Light and refreshing dessert! Like another reviewer, I doubled the recipe but used the entire 8 oz. package of cream cheese instead of 6 oz. It tasted perfect. This is extremely fast and easy with great results. Thanks for sharing!

My SIL made regular-sized pies like this yrs ago, using a homemade pie crust.  This makes it simpler by using graham cracker tarts from the store, and in summer, no baking necessary which is good.  Instead of mixing the fruit into the cream filling, I did it my SIL's way by topping the cream mix with pie filling (I like cherry).  Just pour the filling into tart, top with pie filling of your choice, enjoy. Yum.

Great recipe!  Served Easter Sunday, light and refreshing especially after a big meal.  Delicious even without the crust if you're GF as is my daughter :-)
