This procedure is okay. I prefer to place the ham in the skillet to heat it through first.  Then build the sandwich as decribed and grill.  By heating the ham first you guarantee that your ham will be nice and toasty warm along with the melted cheese and bread.

This was a great idea and was a nice simple change up from a plain hot grilled sandwich. The ham wasn't really warm though in the middle although the outsides were toasty and the cheese was melted. I didn't care for the flavor of the peppers because it was "too green" and that's just a personal thing.  Maybe if I had used a roasted chile pepper I would have liked this better? The recipe is fine, the green taste was not.

EXCELLENT! I used white bread and jalapeno peppers because that's what I had on hand. In addition to the swiss and ham I also added some cheddar. I baked these in the oven using the 'Awesome Grilled Cheese Sandwich' recipe from here-PERFECT! I will be making these again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yummm. I don't like Swiss cheese much, so I use Cheddar. Excellent sandwich, one of my favourites.

Tasty but a little boring.  I think it's the Swiss cheese in this.  Any other cheese would have probably been better, like cheddar, havarti, or pepper jack.  This was a nice quick lunch though and I thank you for the recipe ;)

Instead of a green chili,I added a few drops of Sriracha on top of a thin layer of mayo to the inside of the sandwich for a little kick and served it with red grapes to put out the fire.

I used canned roasted green chili peppers, and White American cheese since that is all I had in stock. We really liked these with the addition of the green chilies. I did warm my ham and chilies a bit in the microwave.
