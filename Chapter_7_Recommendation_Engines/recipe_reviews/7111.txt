the recipe was nice.. I changed some of the ingrdients to make it more moist in texture. I use brown sugar for the muffin mix and reduce the flour to 1 1/2 cup cause it was to dry..you can also use cream instead of milk.

Yum I made these to use up some etra cream cheese. I made with mixed all together deleting the step to add the creamcheese lemon mixture in the center. I have picky kids and know they would not like the texture in the center. We ate these plain and with strawberry preserves. YUMMY

This recipe was just OK. I found that I couldn't get all of the filling the recipe made to fit in the muffin cups with all the batter there was. It may be better to increase the yield to 10 and put less batter in the bottoms I don't know.

These muffins were really good and easy to make. They had a great creme cheese flavor to them. P.S. You don't have to eat them for brunch they are good anytime and very filling.

I thought these were very good. I used blueberry cream cheese which added extra flavor. They froze well.

These were just ok. Very dry almost no cream cheese flavor at all and the lemon was nonexistant.

Just ok. I think I might try to work with the recipe to make something better.

The muffins were okay. I couldn't find even a hint of cream cheese or lemon flavor. I also couldn't fit all of the filling in. The kids liked them.

I have tried this recipe and don't think it is great as you can only taste the cream cheese filing in the centre of the muffin. I would suggest that the cream cheese should combine together with the batter!

These muffins were very bland. The baked up very presentable but the taste didn't match.

Dry and rather bland. The lemon cream cheese filling was tasty but getting a bite of it was rare.

These muffins are not sweet at all and the cream cheese "filling" was just a sticky mess. Add a lot more sugar to the recipe if you make these.

I really wanted these to work; the recipe looked good. But they weren't salvageable. The biggest issue I think is that the measurements are off.

I also just added the cream cheese right into the batter.   After others saying there was little lemon taste, I added all the zest from the lemon and used the juice from the lemon which was about a 1/2 cup lemon juice and then topped it up with milk to come up with 3/4 cup liquid. Had a lovely lemony flavor.

I only gave it three stars because I had to change the recipe drastically. I mixed all the ingredients together at once and I got a nice light muffin that my whole family likes. I like them warm with coffee in the morning.

I just combined the extra cream cheese in with the flour mixtures b/c I couldn't get the dollop down far enough and it was right at the top...guess I just need more practice. Very delicious!!!!

These were just ok. I used real lemon juice for half of the milk to kick up the lemon flavor in them. Without lemon they wouldn't have had any flavor at all. If you use a normal size muffin tin you can't get enough filling in them.

I made these muffins for my family of six as a dessert and they came out with no flavor what-so-ever. The only thing that made them edible was the powdered sugar covering the top. The filling came out very thin and gross looking. I ended up mixing the filling into the batter which still came out very bland. But these were very easy to make and if someone doctored up the recipe they could be very good.

So I will be the first to admit that you should rate the recipe on how it was written and not how you changed it. BUT I read all the reviews first and decided to just go ahead and mix all the ingredients together. The muffin was moist and since I used strawberry cream cheese (it was what I had on hand) it was a very light pink color. However the taste was bland. There was very little cream cheese flavor- it was not very bold. I think if there was a way to up the flavor concentration (using a strong extract?) then it would be much better.
