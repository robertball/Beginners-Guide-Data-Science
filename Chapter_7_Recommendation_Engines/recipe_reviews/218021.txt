This is BY FAR my favorite cobbler recipe.  I tripled the recipe but I added 4 Cups of Blackberried, 2 Cups of Raspberries and 1 Cup of Blueberries.  The colors difference in the berries made it very pretty.  Great when it's warm with Vanilla ice cream...

I had never made cobbler this way, and I have to admit that I was sure the instructions were written wrong, because the whole thing is assembled upside down. I went ahead and did it anyway since the reviews were so good, and it was amazing! Great flavor, and it was a yummy way to use the marionberries from our garden. I'm going to let my girls help me next time--it was almost like magic to put a virtual "lake" of berries and sugar and water in the oven and have a scrumptious dessert emerge an hour later!

I thought this was pretty good. The only components of a cobbler are sweetened fruit and a cake like part, so they have to be sweetened just right. I have some mystery berries growing in my yard that appear to be mulberries or boysenberries and used those. After I began the recipe I was worried at first it was too much sugar, but tried it as is and it wasn't too overly sweet tasting onced  it was baked. It was done in 45 minutes. It tasted good with some whipped cream and would probably be also good with a little ice cream.

I love this recipe!  It's so easy.  I made only 2 changes, I used butter instead of margarine and the second time I made it, I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  I have made it twice in the last week and it was great both times!

Very much like the cobbler recipe my mother and granny taught me to make as a child.  We put the fruit, sugar, and water and half a stick of butter in a pot and just brought to a boil before pouring over the batter.  Batter rises to the top just like in this recipe.  I use any fruit but love it with peaches as I grew up near a great peach area in SC...Linda51

I also received a similar recipe passed down from my Mother and Grandmother.  I have used it with all kinds of summer fruits and it has always turned out great.  It's a keeper for sure.

I followed the recipe exactly, but for some reason it didn't turn out quite right.  I expected there to be a nice blackberry sauce on the bottom and the cake on top, but I ended up with a thick layer of clear gelatinized sugar on the bottom because the blackberries did not sink.  They were almost all floating on top of the cake part.  I guess blackberries don't generate much juice, because there was none when I baked these that were freshly picked a few minutes before.  That said, the flavor was terrific - I added a bit of vanilla to the cake recipe.  If anyone has a suggestion for something I may have done wrong, I'd be happy to read about it.  I would like this recipe to work for me.  We have a lot of berries growing on our property and it is a simple recipe, but it's not like what MY Mom used to make!.

This is a great recipe! I have used it alot in the past year.   I live in Japan where you just don't get good stuff like blackberry cobler,  unless you make it.  So far I have use this recipe to make blackberry, blueberry, and mixed berry cobler .   All of them came out GREAT! I didn't change a thing, only the cooking times veried.  With this recipe I just watch the crust, when it is golden brown, it's done.  None of my coblers have lasted more than 24 hours.

This is a good recipe the best part is how simple and fast it was to put together. I had made the entire cobbler before the oven was done preheating. Mine cooked for 45min and I followed the directions and it came out really yummy. My only gripe is that my berry's dropped and did not show through like some of the other great pictures. This cobbler tastes like an old fashioned hence the description from the submitter.. Really great for a fast cobbler recipe

Just about to try this after it cools just a little more. Not sure what I did wrong though, I checked the cobbler about 35 minutes into baking and was horrified to see the water was now on the bottom of the pan and the cobbler mix and berries were above it.....I took my spoon and tried to mix things together, cooked for an additional 20 minutes....Looks good now, and smells yummy. Will try again regardless! If its award winning, then I'm pretty sure it was my errors! hahah

Love this cobbler! Very easy to make. If you have more than 2 cups of blackberries use them.  If you are wondering about the 1 cup water - don't worry,it soaks up the batter and makes it moist.

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe bc it was so easy, but after reading some reviews I decided to give it a shot.  Very good!!  The only modifications I made were adding about a tsp of cinnamon to the sugar and flour mix, and I also used a bag of frozen mixed berries instead of only black berries.  Oh and I used 3/4 c of water and 1/4 butter mixed together at the end there.  the crust is nice and carmelized on the top giving it that little crisp and there is such a good amount of crust throughout.  i recommend trying it, theres a reason it won prizes right? ;)

Oh my gosh!! When I saw this wonderful recipe, it certainly brought back fond memories of my Grandma's special blackberry cobbler.  This is her recipe too.  Our family has enjoyed this recipe for years.  Thanks Judi for bringing it back into the limelight.  It's the best.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but there was a gummy mauve layer on the bottom beneath the biscuit layer. I'm sorry, but I did not like this much.

I made this with frozen blackberries that we had picked locally.  It needed a little more time to cook because they were frozen.  I also threw in a handful of fresh blueberries because 2 cups didn't seem like enough fruit and did not near cover the pan.  The blueberries were a nice addition, I would do that again.  I substituted 1/2 cup oat flour and real butter rather than margarine to make it healthier.  It turned out a little glutinous, but I'm going to blame that on the oat flour, not taking any stars away for that.  I did think it was too sweet, even with the tart blackberries.  Next time I would only use 3/4 cup sugar, maybe less if I used a sweeter kind of berry.  My 4 yr old wouldn't eat it, but my 1 yr old loved it with cream on top.  All in all a good recipe and I am sure I will use it again.  thanks!

This was a delicious cobbler.  I had many compliments from my guests.  It gave a lovely presentation as well with ice cream.  It dried out somewhat in the fridge overnight despite being covered but a little warming in the microwave and it was again moist and delicious.  Can't think of any changes I would make.

I bake often, and usually have a really high success rate with new recipes. However, this one was completely inedible when it came out of the oven. First of all, it didn't bake well. I left it in the oven for much longer than the recipe indicated, and it still didn't bake all the way through. I had to leave the house, and took it out of the oven after at least an hour and a half, and it still wasn't done. The bottom was a gelatinous bed of goop. It was slick, shiny and gloppy. It didn't look at all like a cobbler, cake, or anything baked. I read some of the other less positive reviews, and saw that many others experienced  the same thing.

This was so good! I changed the recipe a little bit. I used a whole stick of butter, steeped fresh mint leaves in the cup of water, and added a scoop of ground flax to the flour. At the very end, I dusted some cinnamon on top... and then had to slap my brothers' hands away so he wouldn't eat it all!

Found this while looking for a cobbler recipe to use all the blackberries my kids brought me after an afternoon of picking.  Loved it - easy to make & turned out wonderfully.  Only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was that the bottom was a tad bit gooey for my tastes, but still very good.

Absolutely exceptional! I made it exactly as the recipe says, but didn't really measure the blackberries. I used about 2 6oz. packages, give or take. :) Blackberries were on sale this week so I bought some and then realized that I needed to use them up before they went bad. I had never made cobbler before, and this was amazing! Super easy and it didn't take very long either. I have to admit, I was worried about the bottom layer when the water sunk down to the bottom (especially after reading some "this didn't turn out so great" reviews) because it had a gross gray color for most of the baking time, but after about 45 minutes in the oven, the crust was golden brown and the entire thing looked amazing!! It definitely tasted amazing too! I whipped up some cream and it was delicious!! This recipe is definitely a keeper and I look forward to trying it with different kinds of fruit! :) Thank you!

I replaced flour with King Arther's Gluten Free flour mix. It was so good.  My husband loved it too.

Great! I had frozen blackberries, so it took a bit longer to bake. I also cut the sugar sprinkled on the top by more than half, it would have been way too sweet otherwise! Put in a dash of lemon juice and nutmeg in the dough, too.

Quick, tasty and so easy to prepare.  Next time I will decrease the sugar slightly, add more berries and maybe some lemon zest.  Thank you Judi!

Good. But the original is too sweet for me who has diabetes. I reduced sugar to 3/8ths for the cake part and to 1/4 cup for the berry part. I also used three cups of frozen berries (berry mix of blackberries, blue berries, and raspberries) instead of just 2 cups. The berry part came out watery. Maybe it was from using frozen berries? The whole thing still tasted good. Next time I won't put any water in the berry part.

I love this recipe! I'm pretty new at cooking and I love using healthy ingredients without a lot of extras, so I decided to try to whip this up. It is easy and completely delicious. This one is definitely going on the fridge to use throughout the summer!!

I will definitely make this again. It's deliciously perfect as written. It may be best at room temperature but we couldn't wait that long. Four adults annihilated this in a heartbeat. Thank you for sharing. Made me look like a rock star!

Perfect basic recipe to work with - different berries, a little less sugar, etc. I also added vanilla to the batter and I think it added a nice compliment to the flavors. I always double it and make it in a 9.5 by 13.5 pyrex glass dish and it comes out perfect every time. It disappears very quickly wherever I take it.

Pretty good Cobbler.  I substittued milk with Almond milk.  I also used gluten free flour!  It looked so odd when I poured the water on the top, but turned out great! The only thing I woudl have changed is I may have put a little salt in the dough, it was a little bit bland.  I would have added an extra cup of berries too!  I used frozen Blackberries, as that is what I had. I liked the fact the Cobbler crisped up slightly on the top, it wasn't too soft!

I LOVE the cobbler part of the recipe and will try to perfect the overall product by putting it together with the berries differently because like another review I read, the sugar turned to gelatin along the top and bottom edges :( ANYONE KNOW WHY!?!?! I'm going to try berry mix down first then dough drops on top now. It was SOOOO good but too difficult to enjoy while having to eat around the clumps of goopy sugar.

Yum! Some of my blackberries went bad so I added in some quartered strawberries and I used and 8x8 pan- but other than that I followed the directions exactly. 

I had my doubt- especially just dumping the water on top, but it was so good. Super easy to make. 

Thank you for the great recipe.

Made a hit with the family. We have blackberries growing all around our homestead and so used wild berries at the peak of season. This was quick and easy on a busy summer day.

I found the filling ended up being a little waxy once it cooled off which I was not crazy about.  Everyone else seemed to like it at the time but when I mentioned what I thought, the person I was talking to agreed.

Loved this as a mom of 4 little ones, this was super EASY! Hubbie gave it a 10!!! Thanks for sharing!! 
I did add a total of 2 cups of sugar. Made it sweeter, and used butter instead of margarine.

This dessert had a great taste. However, I would not call the consistency "cobbler". It had a much more cake-like texture than my usual cobbler recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and my family did enjoy the dessert, but because I enjoy a more dense cobbler, I will stick to my old recipe.

I followed the directions and there were grey gelatinous globs of goo on the bottom of the pan from the sugar and water.  The flavor was ok but I couldn't get past the gelatinous glops. I will continue my quest for a good cobbler recipe. This just isn't it. Sorry.

Wow!  Absolutely delicious.  I used blueberries and a little less sugar on top.  Can't wait to try it with blackberries.  Very quick to put together, and it didn't need ice cream or whipped cream added.

I made this for my parents Memorial Day weekend.  It was the perfect weekend entertaining recipe - EASY!!!!  The whole family loved it.  I didn't change a thing.  I would double it for a bigger crowd or if we wanted seconds. :)  It fed 4 adults and 2 children with no leftovers.

This is an easy recipe. I reduced the water to 1/2 cup.
It was nice & crispy brown in just 45 minutes.
Next time I'll add more berries, at least 3 cups total , maybe add some raspberries for  added flavor. Great with ice cream.
definitely will make again.

I was worried about pouring the water overtop at the end, before baking (plus felt another 1/2 c of sugar was too much so used less), but popped it into the oven with my fingers crossed and hoped for the best...  :)
Turned out alright! Yay! :)

This was pretty good. My husband loved it. Very easy recipe to follow...seems odd to pour water over but magic happens in the oven.  I made it vegan using unsweetened almond milk and Miyoko's dairy-free butter.

I made twice, second time was the best. Instead of using the last half cup of sugar at the end, I sprinkled on berries and let it marinate with the berries for 20 min.It completely transformed the recipe into a thick saucey bottom of berry goodness. Id definitely do this every time ! Was so so good. Thanks for recipe!!

This was the house favorite this blackberry season! So super easy and quick. Yes the recipe seems weird, but it works great. Cake is kind of a biscuit texture. I use about 2 cups of berries. Yummo!!

Well it didn't come out like the picture. Tasted ok. It needed a bit more sugar for my liking. Meh.... Don't think I'll be making this again. I'm sad because I kind of expected a better tasting dessert.

I have made this recipe many times.  The first time was with fresh blackberries.  That turned out delicious, so when I had a bumper peach harvest this year I started using this recipe with peaches and continue to do so with my fresh frozen peaches.  The only thing I do differently is that I use much less sugar in the final step.  I just sprinkle sugar on top and it turns out to only be almost 2 tablespoons.  I can't imagine what it would be like to dump a 1/2 cup of sugar on it at the end.  And I use butter instead of margarine.

It is so easy and turns out great every time.  Thank you!!

Just got the recipe made it twice in the last week! It was a huge hit. Requests for recipe.Amazing how the cake rises to the top. Seems different to pour water over top, but it does cook and disappear. 
I make the batter and after pouring it in the baking dish I took the sugar and 3 tsp (for double batch  9x13). of cornstarch, mix together add berries and lightly toss coating berries, pour over batter and add water

This is an easy, excellent cobbler recipe. When I make it with berries I add 2 tbsp if corn starch to berries and sugar for a thicker broth. When I make it with peaches I add cinnamon and corn starch to the fruit. Both are outstanding.

I read other reviews , so I used this recipe as a guide and adjusted to my taste.  For the crust I added sour canned milk and salt.  For the mix I added 3 cups of blackberries, 1 cup of sugar, salt, cinnamon, molasses (I wanted brown sugar but I forgot), lemon juice, vanilla extract,  I cooked the mix till hot and bubbly and spooned crust on top 8x8 pan baked 45 min at 350. Perfect.

Cobbler was very good. Made it in an 8 x 8 pan and a few more then the two cups of berries. I think my berries would have sunk more had I used the right pan. I will make this again and try it with other fruit.

The, absolutely, easiest-to-make and tastiest-make-them-come-back-for-more recipe!!  I tried making it, for the first time, a couple of days ago, and I've already baked several cobblers, some of them modifying the berries and or using donut peaches ... fantastic!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

It was  so easy to make. I picked some blackberries the other day and decided to make a cobbler with them. I've never made cobbler before. My mom loved it, too. It wasn't too sweet and perfect amount of tart.

Great and easy. When doing with peaches, change final 1/2 cup sugar to 1/4 cup white/1/4 cup Brown. Blend and sprinkle over fruit. Then sprinkle cinnamon and a little nutmeg before adding water. Fabulous peach cobbler recipe.

I did not have a 9 x 9 pan, so doubled the ingredients and used lasagna pan. maybe this was the problem.  It did not come out well, very dry and hard.  I'll try it again as directed and will revise the review if it turns out better.

My husband picks wild blackberries every summer.  Fortunately, we had some in the house when I learned we were having 8 people to dinner the following evening.  I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand (important, when the nearest store is 1/2 hr. away), and because it didn't need to be served warm so I could make it ahead of time.  Wow, this cobbler was a hit!  And so quick and simple to make!  The same crew will be returning early this fall and have already hinted that I make it again.

First time I ever had a cobbler and first time to make one. Excellent, easy to make,  only thing I did different was add a cap full of vanilla and sprinkled some sugar on top towards the end of baking cycle. Will be trying rasberries next. Can't wait.

Very tasty and easy but it did have a thin purplish, gelatinous  filler at the bottom corners . Otherwise the berries nicely peeked through the surface. Will try again to see if that gel forms.

This is awesome!  Thank you for posting Judi.  I've had my first berry cobbler last week from a fancy bakery and my entire office loved it.  So I went in search of a recipe and I have to say, this came really close.  Based on some reviews, the only change I made was mix water, sugar and berries and heat for a few minutes before spooning on top, but I didn't change the ingredients.  Simply amazing!

I really enjoyed this. I used Frozen Blueberries.  I cut the water back to 3/4 cup since I used frozen. Added the juice of about a third of a medium Lemon and could have used more. I mixed water lemon juice and sugar in the measuring cup with the blueberries and stirred it up. poured that mixture over the batter. It is a loose batter and this cooked up nicely. I would add more berries next time.

i tried this recipe exactly as written and it was a disaster. batter never came to top, 
water went to bottom and blackberries stayed on top. was like 3 separate layers of craziness. So sad! next time maybe I'll just put berries on bottom with water and batter on top?

I think the people that get the soggy bottom follow the recipe. It calls for only 1/2 cup of sugar total, but uses a half cup twice.

This is a very good recipe and I love the way the dish looks after it's been cooked. I thought there was a lot of sugar in the batter already so I only sprinkled 1/8 c. sugar over the top of my berries and it came out perfectly sweet! Will definitely make again as it was very easy and quick to make with very little cleanup. Delicious!

I used an 8X8 pan so only used 1/2 cup of water. It was very good. I would definitely add more blackberries. I used the 2 cups but had more of the biscuit part than fruit. That would be my suggestion. I would recommend fresh blackberries from a farm and make sure they are thawed if frozen ones are used. Great recipe. Thank you.

Very moist.  I made it with blueberries and added a pinch of cinnamon and was really surprised how this recipe worked out.  I really hesitated with pouring a cup of water on it but the end result was terrific.

This is very similar to my peach cobbler recipe handed down to me which I make with blackberries, or any other fruit.  I have a few differences : 1 1/2 C water instead of 1 C, 1/4 cinnamon added to the sugar sprinkled over the fruit, and I always add 1 t almond extract to the milk.  I cream butter and sugar, then alternate adding milk and flour/baking soda/1/4 t salt mixture. It is my absolute favorite!!  With the extra water, I get a juicy sauce; delicious!!

I made this with butter. It was very tasty, not too sweet. The bitterness really depends on the berry. The berries I had were a little bitter to begin with. The cobbler gave a nice sweet taste to them. If you want more sweet, vanilla ice cream goes well with this cobbler.  Overall, very good and I'd make it again.

This is such a versatile recipe, and SO SIMPLE!  I used 1/2" mango dice (homegrown) and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  I used a metal pan as I didn't have a glass 9"x9".   It came out great!  This is now a STAPLE recipe for quick, easy, delicious dessert in my collection.   Thanks to the cook for sharing it!

I made this today and messed up. I forgot to add the water just before baking. It was more like a 9*9 BlackBerry muffin. Still delicious, but next serving I might pour a bit of vanilla soy milk. Still delicious!

I made this for a social gathering and it was LOVED by all our guests. The batter on the bottom with blackberries and water  on top (what the heck?) feaked me out, but I went for it! It turned out beautiful. Berries sunk in perfectly and there was a nice golden brown topping after about 50 min. I made a 1.5 batch and used a 9 by 11.5 pan. I also added a splash of vanilla and dash of cinnamon to the batter. This will be my go to recipe for blackberry cobler!

Made with Self rising flour and frozen Blackberries.  Absolutely delicious.  Also used glass baking dish and lowered the baking temperature to 325% and baked for 1 hour.   We are having it for dessert now.

I made just a few tiny changes.  I used just a,tad more milk and I sprinkled sugar on the blackberries after I rinsed them.  It was the best cobbler I have ever made!  And yes, I will be making it again!!!!!!

I have made this recipe many times and I always get rave reviews. People say it's the best cobbler they've ever had. You can make this with frozen blackberries, but I recommend fresh ones. Don't forget the vanilla ice cream to go with it.

It was good, but mine turned out really syrupy on the bottom, and along one side. The 1/2 C of sugar over top seemed like a lot, and maybe it didn't spread evenly? Not sure. Maybe next time I'll just use 1/3 C sugar on top, and bake it a bit longer.

Every time I made it, I used Driscoll blackberries.  They were always tasty and this recipe is so easy. Can't go wrong with this recipe.

Very easy to make. Used a 9x13 dish, and 1.5 times the ingedients. It's baking now but smells delicious! I also used frozen berries and vanilla sugar.

Tried this and it was great! Only changes I made were I added lemon juice to the berry mixture, vanilla and salt to the cake mixture, and I placed the berries on the bottom and poured the cake on top. Everything cooked and it had a nice syrup on the bottom. Defiantly will make again.

My family loved this recipe.  I wasn't sure about the idea of a cake-like batter, but it worked out great.  I added cinnamon and dabs of butter on the top.

I have made this a dozen times by now and always feel weird pouring the water on top of the batter... but it works every time. People go crazy for this cobbler. I've also made it in my cast iron skillet which gives it a crunchy  texture that is delicious!!

I made this recipe just as it was written and wasn't really that excited about it. It was good but not incredible. I didn't think there were enough blackberries and the dough was kind of spongy. I prefer it to be a bit more crumbly.

So easy to put together and came out exactly how I expected. I followed another suggestion and used an 8x8 pan and only 1/2 cup of water. I also added a little cinnamon (1/2 tsp). Very delicious! Can't wait to make again with fresh berries from the backyard this summer.

I loved this recipe!  After reading some of the other reviews,iI chose to use an 8x8 pan which worked well.  Although  I was confused with the water at the end of the recipe.  I poured 3/4 c on top of the berries and sugar, and it came out great!

Very nice recipe, similar to a handed-down one I had. From knowledge of the other, I took about 1/3 of the sugar that goes on top and added it to my fresh picked berries. Some were a little hard, so I slightly mashed them & simmered them for a few minutes with a pinch of nutmeg added to the sugar to make a juice. Excellent batter, and we liked the juice that formed at the bottom. Can't wait to try this recipe with other berries and cherries-thank you for sharing your time-honored family secret!

I never made cobbler before so i was skeptical of pouring the water on the top but it turned out fine on the top... the bottom on the other hand was a jelly-like consistency that I wasn't fond of. Overall I still ate it!

I've made this twice and it didn't turn out very good either time. I followed the instructions carefully both times so I don't know why it wasn't good. Will not try a third time.

Made for my fiance was a little worried because this was the first time I made blackberry cobbler and with the directions didn't think it could be so easy. Loved it. : )

BEST COBBLER EVER!!!!!
My favorite cobbler for years was down at BBQ joint that's been closed down for a while now and I could never find anything that compared... Until now.  And this is even better than I remember their's being.  The only thing I did different is to use a frozen berry mix instead because that's what I had on hand, and Oh My Goodness was this good!!!

Wow! Super easy to make and super delicious. Was like a dumpling consistency with the blackberries but oh so delicious! Husband loved it too. Tried it a second time but used wheat flour. DO NOT Recommend using wheat flour, stick with the all-purpose white flour. Why? With wheat flour it becomes heavy and thick and just like eating wheat pancakes. Whereas the all-purpose is light and fluffy.

My new "go to recipe" for the easiest cobbler ever!  Delicious and adaptable for a small cobbler or one to feed a crowd.  I'll be freezing wild berries to make this for a winter treat...thanks for sharing!

I took this to a church social and had people commenting on it for a week! They all thought it was fantastic. I have a deep dish pan so I doubled the recipe. It took a little longer to bake that way, but it turned out perfectly.

Tried this for the 1st time with company over for dinner.  Served it with ice cream. I like that it is served cold so it can be made ahead of time. My husband says it is a definite do it again dessert.

Made this tonight for the first time just to use up some blackberries we had on hand, and my husband declared it "the best cobbler ever."  Thanks so much for sharing, this has been added to the short list of favorites!

I was really excited to make this recipe but it wasn't very good - the top ends up being this gel substance.  I did like that it wasn't too sweet but I'll continue to look for a better recipe.

I am no fan of Blackberries But I picked a bunch for my family at a local farm yesterday, and so I decided to make a blackberry cobbler. This is the very first time I have ever made one as I said i'm no fan of blackberries. However I was amazed at how good this recioe is. I just took it form the oven and had to taste it, it was wonderful. I will surely pass this one on.

A nice and easy dessert that lets the blackberries shine through.    I made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn’t change a thing.  It’s easy to see why this recipe won first place.
