The flavor of the sauce was delicious! I recommend using more broccoli and cooking the onion rings separately then adding then to the casserole--I ended up with soggy onion rings. However, overall quite good and I will make again.

I love this recipe, I've made it atleast 5 times. I prefer cream of celery soup for casseroles, works great for this recipe. I also pre-bake the onion rings before I put them on top.

This was really tasty! WARNING: Don't go cheap on the onion rings, they can ruin the casserole.

Very good! I used Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup, shredded cheddar in lieu of the American, topped with more cheese and only because I forgot to buy them, I sprinkled with buttered seasoned bread crumbs. Excellent and thank you Melanie!

Very good casserole.  I took the advice to bake onion rings separately, which worked well; also used shredded cheddar cheese.  I will use this recipe again!

I used frozen broccoli, heavy cream and added some additional seasonings. Overall very good. Went well with my "Thanksgiving dinner menu" in August.

Good basic. I prefer cream of chicken soup to cream of mushroom, always. I also think the onion rings are extremely important for crunch, so I ran in a local restaurant and got an order of shoestring onion rings to top with! Yes! crunchy topping perfection. Even the kids enjoyed this one!

This was OK. I like my traditional broccoli casserole much better. I just thought this was missing something. I would make again, only if I was asked.

Great dish. I cooked half a cup of basmati rice and added it to to the broccoli just because it did not seem like enough broccoli but the rice in it was so good. So next time I will definitely make it with the rice keeping rest of the recipe exactly the same. I also baked it for just over an hour and it got nice and brown on top.

I loved this recipe. I was low on broccoli so I added zucchini to the mix. I used Frenches onion rings instead of frozen ones and crispy goodness was the result. A great recipe I will use over and over again. If you like green bean casserole you will love this. My only thought, giving directions for the cheese,like shredding it would be helpful.
