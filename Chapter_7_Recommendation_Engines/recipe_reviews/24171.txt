This is a great and versatile recipe.  My favorite way is to substitute Vegetable Soup Mix for the Dill Dip Mix.  Also, try serving it in a Hawaiian Bread Bowl instead of Pumpernickel.  This has been a hit everytime!

I substituted low & no-fat options for the sour cream,mayo, and cream cheese.  The subs went unnoticed when I brought this dip bowl to a pot luck cocktail party a few weeks ago.  I'll definitely be making this quick, easy, nutritious appetizer again.

wow  just wow.  every time I've made it people rave about it!  I usually use dry veggie soup mix rather than dill since its easier & cheaper to find.  I've made it with both frozen thawed (and well drained) spinach and fresh...  fresh is 1000x better.

This is one of my favorites to make as an appetizer during the holidays. I like to use either homemade dry ranch dip or homemade dry vegetable dip in place of the dill dip (making it homemade adds more flavor and cuts out the extra salt or even MSG, which is in some pre-packaged dip mixes) and I use frozen spinach that I've thawed and squeezed out all the moisture out of. If you have it, this is also good with some chopped marinated artichoke hearts folded in, too. Never fails to disappear. NOTE: Using reduced fat sour cream, cream cheese and mayonnaise really does NOT affect the taste at all. Feel free to substitute without worries.

Great Appetizer!  I was able to find the dill dip mix and it was a big hit w/ friends.  Recommend getting two breads and using one to cut up for dipping.

Great, fresh tasting recipe! I made this with about 12 oz. sour cream and used low fat cc and sour cream.
One tip is to wilt the fresh spinach with a little bit of water before adding to the recipe. I find that it brings out the flavor of the spinach more. 
Everyone raved about how delicious and fresh tasting the dip was. I served it with a wheat beer bread.

This was so quick and easy and my family ate the entire thing in an afternoon.  Although, I did substitute vegetable soup mix for the dill dip since my husbands not a fan of dill.

very good but it is a little hard to find the dill dry mix - had to use onion the first time much better with the 2nd time with the dill dry mix- also may need to buy extra small rolls for dipping

This is always a favorite when I bring it to potlucks. You can skip the mayo if you want, it doesn't make much of a difference. You can use Knorr's dry veggie soup mix instead of dill mix too.

This spinach dip is so good and easy to make. I made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas get togethers this year. My family is still raving over how great it was.

This is excellent and sooo easy!  I made a double batch.  Bringing it to an office luncheon tomorrow. TIP: I found the dill mix in the salad dressing aisle. Much better than my usual spinach dip recipe.

Substituted onion soup mix - it was great! I recommend only 1 tbsp of onion soup mix though. I added about 2 tbsp and it was very salty.

I made this last minute for a potluck at work and served in a sour dough bread bowl with carrot, celery, and bread for dipping.  It was the first dish gone and everyone raved.

Made this for a party, i used a can of spinach.
Aparently it was a huge success because after making three bowls of it there were no leftovers.
