I changed blackberries for the blueberries because that's what I had on hand. I left everything else the same.  I was looking for something quick for lunch that would supply the energy I needed before getting going with the kids again.   This was perfect on a hot day! I paired it with a tall glass of iced tea and I was in heaven.

This not only tastes good, but is good for you.  I recently got into using wheat germ and it's great with fruit and yogurt.  I used bluberries, strawberries and replaced the banana with raspberries.  I used fat free greek vanilla yogurt and topped the whole thing off with a little honey.  This is a great breakfast that you don't have to feel guillty about.

Delicious! First I added some agave in 1 cup of fat free plain yogurt, which I prefer instead of vanilla flavored yogurt, then I layered the yogurt, granola, wheat germ and fruits (I omitted the banana). Very good and not too sweet.

Absolutely wonderful! You can add a little jazz by mixing 1 1/2 tsp - 1 tbs of honey to the yogurt before you start layering! Adds a little sweetness =) If you use local honey, it also helps with your allergies!

We've been enjoying this for years.  I use fat free Greek yogurt, whatever berries are in season or frozen and I add slices of kiwi.  Sometimes I just toast old fashioned oats if I have no granola.  Dieter's dream, looks good, satisfies, and it is healthy.  Thanks for posting.

I used non fat plain yogurt instead of vanilla (sweetened with splenda) and I was our of granola so I used chopped peanuts instead. Very good!

I make this in a to-go cup every morning for my daughter to eat on the way to school!  I use a variety of fruits and yogurt.  Great way to get a nutritious breakfast into a teenager!

Excellent - easy to make with items on hand. I had mandarin oranges & strawberries. Made the cinnamon stove top granola & added craisins. Delish!

Excellent! I actually eat this parfait every couple of days. I always use fresh strawberries, blueberries and bananas. NO substitutes. I use low-fat yogurt and I layer it with wheat germ which is an excellent source of Vitamin E and Folic Acid. I use Quaker Natural Granola (Oats, Honey & Raisins). This is my favorite breakfast and snack! It is fresh, healthy and delicious. With all the fresh fruits, calcium, potassium, grains, oats, fiber and vitamins, it can't get any better than this right? It's the perfect breakfast and a great way to kick off my mornings.

I've been making this for a long time as breakfast or desert.  Love it!  Love the wheat germ.  I always use plain non-fat Greek yogurt since I like the consistency and extra protein.  I vary the type of fruit depending on the season and what I have on hand.  Using frozen fruit works well too, as it thaws the juices blend nicely into the dish.  If you're making this to be healthy be careful with granola, some brands can be loaded with fat and/or sugar.

These are always so eye catching (and expensive!)at the coffee shop that I decided to make my own.  I'm so glad I did! I used all of the ingredients listed, but really didn't pay attention to the ratios.  I had a 32oz container of vanilla yogurt, so I grabbed several disposable cups and started layering.  The only change I would make is to start with yogurt  instead of fruit.  Without the bananas, they will keep for several days in the fridge.   It's so nice to have a "fancy" healthy treat on hand.

This is SO delicious--and that is coming from someone who is nothing near a fruit lover! I don't even bother to layer it, I just mix it all together and am good to go. It is so easy to specify to your tastes, as well. I prefer more granola and a little less strawberries. This is going to become a breakfast staple for me!

Simple and delicious - for two servings, I used about 1 cup nonfat Greek yogurt with 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tbsp honey mixed in, and I used Jennifer's Granola from this site.

We made these last June at my twin daughters' tenth birthday party.  The one thing we didn't use  was wheat germ, but I had parfait glasses out, and the girls got to layer their own fruit, granola and yogurt.  This was a hit, and many took a second trip to the "parfait bar" - this was such a nice way to be both fun and healthy!

I've eaten a variation on this for years. I'll add the wheat germ. Bananas ripen too fast for me - so it's every kind of berry I can and I use low fat vanilla yogurt. Greek yogurt can be substituted for a heavier flavor. I add plenty of granola with nuts and raisins too. This is good for breakfast or dessert and its so healthy.

Man, why didn't I start doing this sooner!?  No more stopping at the golden arches in the morning, saving me moolah and time, not to mention it tastes WAY better!  I use frozen no sugar added mixed berries and low fat granola.

What a nice healthy summertime treat. My granola had raisins in it which made it even better. Didn't have a banana just made with blueberries and strawberries and low fat vanilla Greek yogurt.

Great way to start the day! Love the flavors together. Adding the wheat germ gives this a nutty flavor and gives it the "sticks with you through the morning feeling! I added a little brewer's yeast to the wheat germ for added health benefits.

I used Light & Fit sugar free, low carb vanilla creme yogurt. I also reduced the amount of each fruit to 1/4 c. & used Sam's cereal instead of the granola to help cut out some carbs!  I don't even like yogurt & I love this special morning treat!

When I make this recipe, I also use greek yogurt and mix it with a about a tsp of agave, a low glycemic index sweetener found in health food stores.  The great thing about agave is that those with diabetes (and doctor's consent) can use it in place of sugar.  In addition, I will sometimes also add flavors like lemon zest or fresh grated ginger into the yogurt for a little extra kick.  Enjoy!

This was a great quick dessert. My husband raved over this dish! I added some blackberries too. I didn't have wheat germ and used crushed nuts instead.

I tried this for my parents one morning and it's great!!! Also.you might want to add nuts, ( walnuts, almonds ) or grapes. I once tried grapes,nuts,blueberries, and yogurt together and it was a good substitute just not as good as the original recipe. Try this for dessert,breakfast, or any meal for that matter! I think you should do in clear cups or glasses but you can choose. (Review by Ruby M)

This was a good and very filling breakfast. We enjoyed the blend of all the ingredients.  Great item to make the night before, minus the granola and wheat germ.  I put that in a separate container, so that the family can grab a parfait and add the granola mixture right before eating.  This would be good with any fruit combination.

My 3 boys liked this so much when I made it last night that I'm making it again tonight. This time I got some kiwi too and will top with a few pomegranate seeds. I did add a tad of coconut sugar on top and used more granola because I love it so much. I made it in my crystal low ball glassed because it looks so pretty. I also chilled the glasses before making them. I prefer to make and eat them right away after dinner so the granola stays crunchy. I fear it won't be if I make it ahead of time.

I make one that is extremely similar. The only difference barely worth noting between mine and the original is that I use "Trader Joe's organic low-fat Vanilla" yogurt (there's a cow on the container and some white flowers). I add strawberries, blueberries and banana or you can switch it up to whatever you have on hand for fruit. Instead of the flax seed, I used chia seeds. And lastly, while I'll occasionally use the granola, I have found that "great grains" cereal by Post in the flavor "raisins, dates and pecans) is much more delicious and tastes a little lighter. Great recipe over all. I eat this every single day and never get sick of it. SO good

Made it without the banana and the wheat germ, due to immediate lack of it, and my granola contained chocolate chips. I also added vanilla from a vanilla bean to regular yogurt since I didn't have vanilla yogurt (and mild honey to make it sweeter), but still possessed both separate ingredients from previous cooking sessions.


Nonetheless, it was super delicious! Not very surprisingly, since I do love each and every ingredient by itself in this recipe. It would probably be a hit with other fruits too. Granola, fruit, and yoghurt as a combination just can't go wrong.

Absolutely delicious. I was curious about the wheat germ and ran to the store for it. I just love this dish, and so does my 1.5 year old. I sprinkle a little cinnamon sugar on top, but saw someone else's review to use honey, and that seems rather tasty too. Thank you so much for this recipe!

It was wonderful! I decided to take out the banana's, but it still tasted perfect! I went to visit my mother, and she kept asking for more! Thanks
