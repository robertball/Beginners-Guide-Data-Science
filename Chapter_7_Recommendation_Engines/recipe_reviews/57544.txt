Good stuff!  I get rave reviews anytime I make this dish.  I like use to 8 oz of the cubed cheese and real tomatoes to make the soup a little healthier.  I also use vegetable broth to make this vegetarian-friendly.

This is fast becoming my favorite soup recipe. To cut way down on the sodium I use fresh tomatoes rather than canned, fresh corn off the cob, and one fresh hot pepper with  my own sodium free chicken broth. With all fresh veggies from my garden, this soup is both super tasty and healthy.

I thought this soup was pretty good but my husband told me not to make it again. It was way too spicy for my kids. I really did enjoy it though, since i like all thinks super hot i used rotel tomatoes with chili pepers it was the hottest one. i than added some jalapeno peppers. I served in bowls with shredded cheese and a dolop of sour cream. great

This was sooo delicious.  And I don't like soup or vegetables!  I chopped up the squash and zucchini pretty small.  I used a can of rotel and left out the small can of chilis.  I added cumin with the corn because most Mexican dishes have that cumin flavor.  I have made this soup several times and I finally figured out how to make it nice and thick like a cheese soup should be.  I let the vegetables simmer in broth more like 25 minutes, not 10.  Then I put 2 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch in a small cup of water until disolved.  Add that to the pot and cook another couple of minutes until it gets thick.  Then add the velveeta according to the recipe.  I've made this soup with yellow squash and butternut squash, both turned out great.  I top this soup with sourcream and crushed tortilla chips.

I would give this a 10 if I could....this soup is so simple to make and has amazing flavor in my book....my family also went back for seconds. I did make a few changes....I used a whole 32oz. carton of reduced sodium chicken broth, 1 (10 oz) can of Rotel (mild) tomatoes with chiles, 1 (14.5 oz) can of petite diced tomoates, frozen corn, and 2% milk velveeta......fresh cilantro is key to add at the end for that freshness.  Served with a little reduced fat sour cream and tortilla chips. Excellent flavors, I did use both green and yellow squash....love this will make again soon. Thanks!...And thanks to Catlin for suggesting this!!

My friend and I loved it as is (well we did add some cumin) but both our husbands said it needed meat. So next time we added some shredded chicken breast and it was perfect. Topped with some sour cream and cheddar cheese.

I changed this recipe slightly to fit what I had on hand.  I did not have Mexican stewed tomatoes so I used a can of Ro-tel and left out the 4.5 oz can of green chilies.  I also added a little bit more cheese.  It turned out great.  This is a nice way to serve up squash and zucchini.  My oldest son liked his with crushed tortilla chips and sour cream.

My family loved this recipe served with tortilla chips.  I was disappointed to discover how high the sodium content is for this recipe.  I will serve this again if I can figure out substitutions to bring the sodium down.

I made this recipe for a cooking project in school, following it exactly as written, and I am definitely going to make it again! This soup was delicious and had the perfect amount of spice. I usually don't like spicy foods, but I absolutely loved this recipe. I am eagerly awaiting the next time I am able to make this!

I did add/modify, but this is a soup that is VERY adaptable.  I added 32oz box of chicken broth and instead of the stewed tomatoes, I added 2 cans of Rotel and omitted the chiles.  I had already shredded all of my zucchini for baking, so I added about 3 cups of shredded zucchini and a can of black beans (could have added 2 but only had one on had) for added protein.  Instead of processed cheese (which would have melted better) I used shredded mexican cheese (about 4 cups), which did clump up some, but I still think it tasted great.  Lastly, I omitted the cilantro since I didn't have it on hand.  I LOVED this for our first fall day rainy weather soup!!!

OMG, I could have eaten this for days but it was gone long before.  I have given the recipe to 2 people so far.  I went by the recipe but used frozen corn instead of canned.  I cut flour tortillas in strips and deep fried them.  I served a bowl of the soup with the tortilla stips on top.  Not only is this soup a delight to everyone who tastes it, it is so very pretty.  This soup would impress anyone. 5 STARS  We loved it and will make again.

This recipe is okay as is but seems to be missing something substantial. I tried adding some spicy sausage to it, but it wasn't enough. I think next time I would add a can of Mexican hominy to it and beef it up a little more.

We loved this with some changes. Used ro-tel (canned tomatoes and chiles- spicier), extra veggies, low sodium broth, real extra sharp cheddar (use less). The whole family loved it-even the squash haters. So easy.

So delicious! I am not too picky about measuring stuff when I make soup so I just eyeballed and went with what I was in the mood for (I'm always in the mood for more onions and more corn!). Because I was making a quick dinner just for me I diced up half a leftover steak and added it in; complete meal and I am having leftovers for lunch now, this is great!

Excellent , tasty soup! I skipped the chile peppers because I was swayed by comments of soup being too spicy. After it was done, I had to add red pepper flakes. I probably would've been fine adding the peppers. I will make this again!

FANTASTIC! I did have to modify it a bit because this was a last minute decision, and I didn't have everything on hand...I had no yellow squash, so I left that out, used more garlic than called for, a can of Rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes and a whole regular size can of corn. I also had no cilantro, so I just left that out. I used the 2% Velveeta because that's the only one I buy. This turned very flavorful, creamy and nice and spicy too! This is definately going into the winter soup rotation! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is my favorite soup!  I have made it several times and have yet to be disappointed.  I do make a couple changes, but nothing major.  I use a can of rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes and I leave out the green chiles.  I like to add a little white rice to my bowl before adding the soup.  Fabulous flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe with a couple substitutions and the flavor was QUITE good.  I used Ro*Tel tomatoes & green chilis instead of the mexican style tomatoes and can of green chilis with excellent results. I did have some problems with my cheese substitution.  I used 3 types of cheese to make up the total amount - processed cheese, grated sharp 2% cheddar, and crumbled sharp white cheddar.  Although other reviewers who substituted regular cheese reported no issues, MY regular cheese formed unappetizing rubbery strands throughout the soup.  Next time I make this, I will stick to processed cheese.  My only other comment would be that I think Id like a thicker soup.  Im eager to try it again with the type of cheese called for in the original recipe and see how it is. I had no complaints whatsoever about the flavor of this quick soup.  Tasty!

Awesome soup!  I made a few minor changes, simply to match my pantry.  Had no yellow squash so used only zucchini.  Used only regular canned diced tomatoes & a full-sized can of corn.  I ordinarily choose not to use processed cheese food but I also know that regular cheddar cheese would be too oily & wouldn't blend properly, so I used a 16 oz jar of salsa con queso.  I also used just a small amount of cumin because it just adds the right amount of heat.  It was more a soup consistency than a chowder consistency, which I really liked.  I could eat the entire pot!  I will be making this again!

My kids LOVED this soup, BUT I used an immersion blender to cream it all up first to "disguise" the squash chunks and added roasted corn kernels on top (not in the soup) with a dollop of sour cream and served it with home baked tortilla chips. I also did not use the diced chilies, but added one seeded and chopped fresh jalapeño (a mild one) and just used whatever canned tomato product I had on hand. This time it was some diced Italian tomatoes and a few slices of fresh. Last time it was stewed tomatoes. With the immersion lender it did not matter. 
From here on out I'm gonna call this my summer mexi-goulash. Leftover veggies? No prob. Just gonna blend me up with some cheese (not necessarily the processed kind either) and serve using this recipe as a basic guide.

Yum!! This is one of those simple soups that is easily adaptable to changes/enhancements. I used Rotel instead of stewed tomatoes and spicy Velveeta. I don't buy canned vegetables, but I had a leftover ear of corn, so I cut that off the cob and used it. The heat was just perfect to me!

Pretty tasty. I followed the recipes exactly, except for the dried oregano (didnt have any on hand). I got the chilis in hot temperature. I made 12 servings which made a TON! Hopefully they make good leftovers. Wish it had a bit more spice but it's tasty as is.

Basically like watery (if you use Velveeta) queso but better. I will make this again but I will definitely find a way to thicken it up a tad. Served with flour tortillas. Hubby loved it!

YES!  I am agreement - this is one tasty soup even without the cheese.  Making for a Mexican dinner tonight and got short notice on what to bring.  DO NOT like to go to town for special ingredients so I went to my FAV site allrecipes.com and typed in mexican and zucchini which I had on hand and WALA ~ I have a new recipe that I love already.  We have vegans in our groups so will only put the cheese in part of it......will add a jar of bertolli 4 cheese sauce to the rest.   
Used veggie broth/rotel/canned chill's/cumin and of coarse extra garlic.  have fresh cilantro chopped and ready to go as we walk out the door! ...... Love the versatility of the recipes on this site.

This soup was so good! My husband and I both loved it. The only thing I changed, was we used Ro- tel instead of stewed tomatoes and we added mushrooms to it. We will definitely be making this again and again. :)

This recipe is awesome!  I used Rotel mexi tomatoes (not stewed) and then 1 can of tomatoes with green chiles...b/c my store was out of the canned green chiles.  This soup has ALOT of spice and is sooooo fricken good.  I didn't add cilantro in at the end simply because I forgot to...and it was still awesome.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was really good! I was looking for a way to use up some of the veggies from the garden in an inexpensive meal. I had the all the ingredients except the processed cheese. When I went to the store the price changed my mind. A couple of days later I drove by the dollar store and on a whim checked their grocery area. Found a 12 oz container of nacho cheese for and used that. The soup was GREAT and is now going to be something we make regularly!

This soup is amazing.  I would eat it everyday if possible.  The only things I did different were using about 15 oz of regular rotel instead of the mexican-stewed tomatoes and I used 16 oz of the cheese.  I also added some thickener at the end because it was too thin.

Love this soup!  I used a hand blender to puree it before adding the cheese (which I melted in the microwave w/ a bit of milk).  We like a smooth soup and it was a great way to hide the veggies.

Oh, this was FANTASTIC! I used 3  zucchini's ( prefer  zucchini over yellow squash any day) and I used chipolte corn and I didn't have any processed cheese so I used a  jar of Ragu cheese and I added some cumin. 
   Came out SOOOOO good. I would recommed this to anybody.

Excellent soup!  I didn't have any cilantro, so I substituted dried parsley flakes, added at the same time as the oregano.  Also, I used half Velveeta and half sharp cheddar, because we prefer cheese soups that way.  My 10-year-old daughter loves it, too!  Anything that gets kids eating vegetables is a success in my book.  I want to try adding a can of drained and rinsed black beans next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I made the mistake of substituting half of the processed cheese with shredded cheddar...not a good idea. The cheddar caused the soup to have really stringy cheese strands that stuck to my spoon...so not appetizing. Not sure I would ever make this again had I used just velvetta either as it is just ok, nothing special.

I made this as written with the exception of using shredded cheddar instead of the processed cheese food.  Well, that must have been the problem because this didn’t work well for me at all.  The cheese wouldn’t incorporate into the soup, so I tried binding it up with a cornstarch/water slurry, which did help a little, but not enough.  The cheese was stringy and stuck to the bottom of the pan, our soup bowls and our spoons, and made for a very difficult clean up.  The flavor of this was good, however, so if I make it again, I’ll have to break down and buy the processed cheese food even though I’m not a fan.

This was good but a little too processed tasting for me though.  I did add some rice because my family won't eat without some kind of a starch.

I used 1 can Ro-Tel to replace stewed tomatoes + green chiles, more zucchini instead of yellow squash, and left out the corn.  Added a little dissolved corn starch to thicken at the end.  Very tasty soup!

This soup was really rich and flavorful.  Like others, I used a can of rotel instead of chile peppers and Mexican tomatoes.  I also used about 4-6 ounces of Velveeta because I didn't want it to be like cheese dip.  As a result, I ended up thickening it with corn starch.  I used it as a side with pulled pork tacos.  For leftovers, I may add some shredded chicken to it.

Needed more bulk so I added black beans and shredded chicken and less velveeta.  It was really good then.

This soup was fantastic.  I ended up putting 3 zucchini and 3 squash in it because I was trying to use them up.  I used chichekn boullion instead of the broth and added some dried cilantro instead of fresh so I could avoid a trip to the store.  My husband added some leftover grilled chicken to his because he thinks everything has to have meat, but I thought it was delicious as is.

This is fabulous healthy soup! I actually used one largish yellow squash, one largish zucchini, and one small bag of butternut squash. I also subbed 2% velveeta to save calories. Also, I ended up using 2 full cartons of chicken broth in this. I think it's best to just add the amount of broth you like and keep the other ingredient levels the same. It would have been a stew without the extra broth I added... maybe my veggies were bigger? I also added 2 heaping T of cornstarch mixed with water before adding the cheese - next time I will add even more cornstarch. It seems like a cream soup but no one can tell it's just broth, low fat cheese and cornstarch! love it!

I agree with the last rating.  I'm giving it 5 stars for the basic recipe.  I'm not a fan of canned veggies so I used two ears of grilled corn, and fresh peppers and tomatoes from the garden.  While we were eating my husband suggested we try potatoes instead of squash for a hearty winter meal.  I'll bet there are other combinations people will come up with using this excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Not sure what I did wrong but the texture of this soup was weird.... I only ate a small bowl and will probably throw the rest of it away. The other pictures looked soo good and it had really good reviews, so not sure if it's something that I did wrong not sure how that would have happened if I followed recipe and directions exactly...

I loved this soup.  It's spicy but not too spicy, cheesy but not too cheesy.  It's not a thick soup, but the cheese flavor is there nonetheless.  Definitely a make-again recipe.

Savory and delicious Soup.  I used Mexicorn instead of regular corn.  I also added an extra can of diced tomatoes with green chile since I'd used 3 yellow squashes.  It is a keeper.

This was such an excellent soup. I got rave reviews from my family. Everyone had seconds including me, and I'm not much of a soup person! What a great way to incorporate zucchini and squash into your diet. Another 10 star recipe!!! Thanx Margarita Girl!!!

Everyone LOVED this soup.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I did sprinkle a little extra cilantro on top for garnish right before serving.  Delicious!

A great recipe that is highly adaptable- five stars if you add some meat to it. I didn’t have squash or corn but it still turned out great. Added two chicken breasts to make it a little heartier Garnished it with tortilla strips- yummy!

Excellent! So tasty and very filling too. Took the advice to add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch after simmering for 20 minutes and before adding cheese.  Served it with sour cream, shredded cheese, cilantro and diced onions.

I started with your recipe and got so carried away I can't post an honest review.  Mine is nothing like yours but is so yummy I gave you 5 stars anyway for the inspiration.  Allahu Akbar.  Jesus loves you.  Hail Satan.  Praise Darwin.  Blessed be Zeus.  Hug mother.

Added black beans and a red pepper I had to use up. It ended up tasting more like a chip dip than a soup, probably because of the processed cheese. Still yummy though, so I just went with it and added a bunch of crushed up tortilla chips and some more cilantro to freshen up the taste. We're vegetarians, and I'm glad I ended up adding the beans because they added a little bit of meat to it, so to speak.

This was great!  I don't buy "processed cheese food" so used some shredded cheddar and some cream cheese.  Also used fresh chopped tomatoes since I had some I needed to use. Delicious!!

My family is not fond of vegetables, especially large chunks, so I pureed the squash in a blender.  I did add some cumin as suggested by others and We loved it!!  Will make this again!

My children didn't want it because of all the veggies and then one tried it and was amazed and then another...before long it was gone and everyone wanted more.  Thank you so much.  What a great way to use garden fresh squash, zucchini, cilantro, and jalapeño.

This surprised me by being as good as it was.  I made several changes based on what I had.  (Sorry, I know people HATE that but I only review for my own future benefit when I revisit a recipe, so bear with me).  I only had zucchini, but I did have four very small potatoes that were going soft, so I shredded all my veggies and sauteed them with the onion and garlic before adding the broth.  Used fresh tomatoes and frozen corn (we don't much dig canned veg).  I omitted the oregano (don't care for it in Mexican food) and added cumin, chili powder, and a dash of salt instead.  Since it's a meatless meal, I added black beans for some protein.  I avoid processed food so simply added a handful of real cheese (cheddar for the kids, pepperjack for the grownups) into each bowl with the hot soup.  Served with sour cream and tortilla chips.  Yum!  Wish I'd had the yellow squash, it's a really tasty way to get some of the healthier veggies in (and you'll never miss the Velveeta, the real cheese is so much better)!  Next time I might shred a carrot too.

yuuuuum!  found this recipe when i had a ton of yellow squash going bad -- and scored big with minimal adjustments. i did not use zucchini, only squash.  threw in a leftover jar of green chile salsa and food processed some tomatoes in lieu of the canned tomatos/green chiles.  added 8-10 dried red chiles for more spice.  only 2 c. broth.  browned the onions and a green pepper in oil, then threw everything in the crockpot for 4-5 hours on low, added 8 oz velveeta for the last hour.  served with sour cream to cut some spice for myself (hubby and 2 yo liked the way it was).  would've added cilantro had i not forgotten -- but loved it the way it was.

This is one of the easiest and best tasting soups I've ever had! I add 2 large cans of cooked chicken (drained) to the mix just before I add the cubed cheese. Separate/shred the chicken chunks with a fork before you add it. I also like to cut up the stewed tomatoes to make them go a little further. I also throw in a few dashes of salt for my family's palate :)

What an awesome and forgiving recipe!  I love it when you can deviate from the recipe and it’s still just as good as the original recipe.  I used  Rotel tomatoes, some Hatch chiles I had in the freezer,  and  a blend of different cheeses that I had on hand.  The broth is actually thin, not like a thick cheese soup, which makes it perfect for the summer and an great way to use up fresh squash and other produce from the garden.

Very tasty soup. I made it more spicier than the recipe calls for but it was excellent. Next time I think I will make some rice to add to it to satify my craving for a starch.

Loved this soup!  I added sliced chicken breasts, used rotel, fresh corn and tomatoes.  This soup is not a creamy, thick soup. However, the veggies make it a hearty soup. My husband had three bowls!

Wow, this is a great soup!  I didn't have Velveeta, so I used several slices of American cheese and thickened it up with some corn starch mixed with milk.  Probably not as cheesy as the original recipe, but still quite tasty!  YUM!

This soup was great!  My husband loved it! I tried it with regular cheddar cheese, and it is still good, but it kind of creates a gooey mess that gets stuck to your spoon. I suggest the processed cheese

This has to be one of the best soups I've had.  It was cheesy, creamy and hearty.  I did reduce the amount of chiles because my family doesn't like things too spicy. I served it with the Mexican Potato Pancakes from AR...it made a perfect meal.

I didn't have Velveeta so I used Kraft singles slices, it gave it a cheesy flavor but I don't think it made it as thick as it was supposed to be.  My husband loved it, he ate 3 helpings which is VERY rare for him and soup.  I enjoyed it, the kids weren't especially thrilled with it but hey it was worth a try.  :)

Wow!! I'm rating this five stars for the great base recipe, even though I made some changes. SO GOOD! I substituted Rotel for the tomatoes, but still added the can of green chiles. It was spicy but not so bad that you couldn't enjoy it. I also added diced cooked chicken and white rice to make it more filling. This was extremely tasty... my husband had seconds and even requested the leftovers for lunch! This will definitely be on our regular rotation..thanks for the recipe!!

Everyone loved..I did change it a bit though.Instead of canned corn, tomatoes and chili peppers, I used fresh (all but the corn was from my own garden!)I used chicken bullion(what I had) and used only 8 oz of the velveeta and 4 oz of sharp cheddar. I will probably be making many times more!!!

Very good.  Nice way to use up those summer squash.  I used yellow squash, a can of rotel and shredded taco cheese because that is what I had on hand.

This soup was delicious! I served wedges of chicken quesidillas on the side. Left the corn out. I'm counting my calories and I figure 1 cup of soup is a serving. So, it was less than 300 calories a cup!

This soup is so yummy and easy to prepare!!!  I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I cut the processed cheese down to 8oz. and added some cheddar instead.  Next time I think I'll try it with Monterey Jack.

A new favorite that I will rely on every summer when our garden is over flowing with zucchini.  I used spicy rotel and added some minced jalapeno.

Great stuff...

I used 1 can of Rotel instead of green chilies. Sour cream added to each individual bowl along with tortilla chips were also a great addition.

9/2013 Yes, I'm still making this soup and loving it. I've noticed that some people are concerned about the sodium level as the recipe is written. Don't let that throw you off.... substituting fresh ingredients is the solution! Use homemade or low sodium chicken broth or vegetable broth, leftover corn on the cob (cut off the cob if you prefer), garden or farmer's market zucchini, and grilled fresh tomatoes and jalapeno peppers! This is the time of the year to make fresh, healthy soups and freeze them for the winter! Today I added 2 finely diced chipote chiles for an extra kick. Make it hot or make it mild... just make it!

I've made this many times and think it's fabulous!  I do use the Mexican Velveeta every time and have substituted canned diced jalepenos for the chiles when I'm in the mood for a soup that is "muy picante!".  Thanks for this awesome soup!

So good!  Better than I thought it would be, and a huge hit with the kids and hubby. I added a dash of chili powder, and it gave it a tortilla soup flavor. I also served it over crushed tortilla chips. Awesome recipie, and fairly healthy. Oh yeah, I made it in a crockpot, and it came out just wonderful.

I added a pound of ground beef at the beginning.  And I used 3 roasted green chiles from my freezer.  This was really good.  My 2 yo loved it, but the other kids weren't as sure.  They don't like any cheese soups, though.

Great soup!  The only change we made was to leave the cilantro out and add crushed tortilla chips at the table. It was also on the stove for a bit longer (hour) because my hubby was late for dinner but it was still delicious!

Delicious!  I used real cheese unstead of Velveeta, and it was great.  Also added more than the spices called for and more of the broth (vegetable instead of chicken).  Tastes great.  Plopped in a dab of sour cream and YUM!  Thanks!

This wasn't spicy enough for us. The next time I made it I put in 4 fresh jalapenos, 4 banana peppers and 1 serrano pepper (seeded and deveined) instead of the can of chiles. Used 1 pound of cheese instead of 12oz. I also added 5 cooked hot Italian link sausages cut up in slices because my husband felt it "needed" some meat.  It's really good that way.

love this soup!!  I make a double batch and eat it all week! I don't add the corn or the oregano, only because I didn't have it the first time I made it, and don't think it needs it now.  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe, think I will make some right now....  :)

This soup is delicious.  I did make a few changes as my family and I like a little bit spicier food.  Used the Mexican Velveeta, added a tsp. of Mrs. Dash Southwestern seasoning, and then added a cup of Pepper Jack cheese at the end.  My husband and I loved it!  Quick and easy to make and delicious to eat.  Perfect for a busy weeknight meal.  I suspect it would taste equally as good with a little shredded chicken added.

Absolutely a favorite soup by all family and friends! Can’t get enough. I double the batch it’s so loved. I do add shredded cheddar cheese and cut back on the Velveeta.  For the Mexican tomatos.  I use Rotel cilantro lime flavor. So good! My other addiction is cooked shredded chicken.  Love! Love ! Love

Fabulous - with a few tweaks. First - I threw everything except cheese into a slow cooker (Instapot) and let cook a few hours. I added 1 cup chopped (Costco) rotisserie chicken and extra jar of green chilis. An hour before eating I added the cheese (not sure if that made a difference or not, but it worked well).  Finally I stirred everything really well and it was ready.   I served with these on the side: sour cream, tortilla chips (crushed for on top), chopped fresh avocado, and chopped fresh cilantro.  It was a huge hit.  My entire "family" of 9 loved it!

We loved this soup. My husband actually went back for seconds. The only changes I made was I added mushrooms and 1/4 c. White rice.  My tomatoes were home canned so I used them with their broth instead of chicken broth. Will make this again.

I think this soup will make me look forward to zucchini season, too! I’ve made it twice so far and my whole family loves it. It’s very versatile. I used one fresh jalapeño rather than the canned and added black beans for protein. I made it once with American cheese and another time with 8 oz of cream cheese. Both were delish. I didn’t have Mexican flavored canned tomatoes, so used regular tomatoes with a dash of cumin and lime juice. Thank you for this recipe! It’s my new favorite!

We added shredded Rotisserie Chicken to the leftover soup and it was another kind of delicious. We like that it’s a cheese soup that’s it to thick... the chicken broth and all the great veggies make this recipe a real keeper. PS... i took a thermos to a 101 year old friend and she polished off two bowls. I was glad I had a bit more to leave her for the following day.

I added tomatoes with green chilies which was too spicy for me to fully enjoy. I will add one can of Mexican tomatoes with the chilies and two cans of plain tomatoes. I also used nacho cheese in place of the cheese cubes because I had a few opened jars. It was a good soup, just too spicy.

Yum! Even my husband enjoyed this. I added shredded chicken, used fire roasted canned tomatoes, and kept the chili’s out all together (so my kids would eat it). I cut and fried corn tortilla and served them on top along with shredded cheddar cheese.

This soup is really so flavorful.  I made it with regular grated cheese the first time.  I’m going to try the processed cheese the next time.

Loved it!  Substituted frozen corn and shredded sharp cheddar.  Used less broth so ate it as a vegetable dish rather than a soup.  For lower sodium make homemade chicken broth from chicken parts, onion, carrots,celery.

Totally loved this one!  AllRecipes is the best site cuz you get to read all the input from folks who've tried it.  My only changes were to cook a small chicken breast and shred it and add a can of hominy to the rest of ingredients.  Good stuff!

Fantastic soup.  The cheese is what gives this soup the nice flavor.   You can use chili powder instead of the canned green chile peppers.  I will definitely use again.

This is very good as it is, but to give a little more flavor I used fresh tomatoes and roasted pasilla pepper (I roasted my own) the peppers added special flavor.

This soup is crazy delicious and easy. Had to use Rotel instead of mexican stewed tomatoes and green chiles (my pantry lied to me). Added a shredded chicken breast. (I'm a carnivore). Will definitely make again.

Very good.  I subbed 2 fresh corn cut from the cob for the canned and 2 roasted poblanos for the canned green chilies.  I also added a roasted, seeded chopped jalapeño.   I will definitely make this again.

I added leftover cooked chicken breast. Instead of just the chili, I added a can of Rotel fire roasted tomatoes with chilis. My zuchs were on the bigger side, so I added more chicken broth (reduced sodium) and an extra few ounces of reduced fat Mexican Cheese blend. I did not use Velveeta type cheese as I prefer the less processed variety. I would probably add black beans to this next time. My boyfriend added leftover Mexican rice that I made. I try to keep my dishes high protein and low carb. This achieves that without the rice. Overall, the zuch is very filling. The soup is hearty.

Add cumin, red bell pepper, dollop of cream.  Used my hand held mixer, left some chunks of veggies, then added the corn.
Used real Monterey Jack cheese.  Delish, keeper.

Wow! Restaurant quality. I don't use processed cheese so I made a cheese sauce of 1Tbsp each butter and flour, 3/4 c each milk and sharp cheddar. Subbed hominy for corn, added orange bell pepper when I sauted the onion. A little cumin and a fajita blend spice mix that I had. Made plenty for 2 people with leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

For those who don't want to use the chicken broth, use a vegetable broth instead to make it fully vegan. Plus don't be afraid to add the heat flavor for a boost.

I liked it, everyone else loved it and asked for the recipe. The only changes I made was I used frozen corn; and also, instead of chicken broth, I used vegetable boullion as I was serving to a group that included 2 vegetarians. It was a very tasty soup. My only complaint has to do with all the recipes that come from allrecipes :) and that is they never give the number of servings a recipe will make. I had a feeling this soup recipe would not serve 12 so I doubled it. Was barely enough--no leftovers for the hubby.  Next time, I will add more cheese, but "real cheese". Velveeta kind of creeps me out!

This is the BOMB! My family has craved it in the winter so we have had to pay too much for squash and zucchini at times, but it is that good! We make this every summer, A LOT with our own zucchini and squash. Making it for a potluck right now! So delicious!! Thank you for sharing!

Make it often and everyone loves it. The only thing is that I don't put the green chiles in. Just the Mexican tomatoes and let people add hot sauce.

This soup is super delicious and light. I did alter the recipe when I made it.... I used a whole large chopped yellow onion, and instead of the canned tomatoes and green chilies, i used 2 cans of rotel. Also, i added a bag of frozen corn, and a can of drained black beans and drained pinto beans.  I think I used more squash/zuch too- just whatever i wanted to use up.  I upped the cheese cubes a little bit to 16 oz. It doesn't look as cheesy as the pictures other people posted but is sooooooo good!

I’m so happy! We had this soup at Del’s Diner on Route 66 in Tucumcari last week. I searched the ingredients and found the recipe! We were thrilled to see how close it was to Del’s. I made it with vegetable broth, low salt corn, added a fresh Anaheim pepper and some tiny baby carrots just because I had them. Everything  else was the same. (I assume Mexican stewed tomatoes are Rotel? It worked.) I’m making this for a faculty luncheon next week. It will be my go-to soup for a gathering from now on. I might even add shredded chicken and use chicken broth if I don’t have vegetarians coming over. Oh, and I hate cilantro, so I left it out.

This was soooooo good.  Until the cheese was added it was a decent soup, but the cheese made all the difference. mIt will make a great comfort meal this winter.

A warm and very tasty soup. I did add some fresh mushrooms when I cooked the onion and garlic. I also chopped up a couple of jalapenos to give it a little extra zip. Also seasoned it with some Tony Chachere's seasoning.  Absolutely fantastic!!

I served this tonight to the family and received rave reviews. The only changes I made were to add just a dash of cumin and simmering the soup for about 25-30 minutes. I'll be making this again.

I really did not have much hope for this recipe, but I had all the ingredients, so I tried it. What a happy surprise! I used Rotel tomatoes and otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. It was even better as leftovers!

Will definitely make again, after following recipe nearly exactly. Thinking chicken would be a great addition and/or black beans. Will add  a little jalapeño next time too.  Great way to use the veggies.

I made this, but made a few changes. I used a very large, while scalloped squash. I also used a can of tomatoes and green chiles as well as a can of chiles.  Next I added some previously cooked chicken that I had in the freezer. Then, I 
I added some left over red peppers that I had cooked from making fajitas. Then I added two tsp. of cumin. Finally, I added two cups of grated medium cheddar cheese instead of the "fake" cheese. It tasted great!

The soup was great but, one of the only thing that we changed was that we only added 8 oz of Velveeta. We also added chopped up rotisserie chicken last.  Overall, it is a great recipe and we definitely will do it again!

We love this soup.  Such a delicious summer somewhat spicy soup.  I did use a large carton of chicken broth (32 ounces) as well as one full bag of frozen corn (12 oz) instead of canned but otherwise stuck to the recipe ingredients.  Because I was trying to time it with other dinner items and didn't want the zucchini and squash to get mushy, I put everything together in a pot and cooked it on medium low maybe 20-25 minutes before adding the zucchini and squash and then cooked another 10 minutes to soften.  Delish!  Dinner guests really liked it as well as my husband and I.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Will make this again for sure.

I tried this recipe last summer in an effort to use up the surplus squash in a new way. I was a bit doubtful but it turned out great! I subsituted fresh tomatoes for the canned and added extra zucchini just to get it used. I ended up with a big pot of soup which was surprisingly good. I will be making this again.

Love this soup. It's a non-traditional mix of ingredients that mesh well together. I toned down the spiciness per our taste but made it otherwise as directed.

Yes-ma'am, this is a hit! Tasty, creamy, filling, and festive. I didn't have squash, so I doubled the zucchini. Added fresh tomatoes a few minutes before serving. Served with torn soft tortillas and topped with shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.

A very flavorful, easy soup.  I did not have the Mexican-style tomatoes, so I used mild Rotel...the same with the cilantro, I used parsley instead.  Never been much of a canned corn fan so I used the white/gold frozen corn which was perfect!  For added color and somewhat flavor to the soup I added a little diced red and orange bell pepper and some dried herb mixture I love to add to this kind of soups.  I froze the leftovers to see how well this freezes.  Think it would also be good to add some shredded chicken next time.  Thanks Always Cooking for a delicious soup recipe that was welcoming on a rare cold winter day in Florida!!!

Made the soup because I'm getting really into zucchini. Liked it so much I went out and bought a thermos so I could take it with me to a mountain hike the next day. 10/10 would eat on a cliff side again.

All time favorite.  I've made with chicken broth and vegetable broth, but are fantastic.  Also, I try to use low fat, less sodium products when I can. Make enough for leftovers because it's gets better and better.

This is a great starting point; I did add some things! Threw in some black  beans and diced peppers because I needed to use them up. Also added some chili powder and cumin for extra flavor. Used diced tomatoes with green chilies (Rotel). Really nice cheesy Mexican veggie chowder. Thanks for the idea!!

This was delicious! I added some of my own spices to make it a little smokier (and a bit hotter) and used up the huge zucchini I've had lying around. Absolutely wonderful!

I really liked this soup. I made it using what I had on hand, regular tomatoes, canned corn, I added a can of black beans and cumin. On a whim I added some left over roasted red pepper hummus to the pot and a big squirt of sriracha sauce.    I garnished with chili Fritos.  It was very tasty. I would make this again.

I LOVE this soup recipe! I used butter instead of olive oil, and real cheddar instead of the fake stuff. Because of this, it needed a little extra salt. I didn't have a can of green chilies, so I substituted 2 pablano peppers from the garden (even better!) I added some crushed red pepper for added spice and color and garnished it with a sprig of fresh cilantro. After admiring the beauty of this colorful soup, I crumbled up some tortilla chips on top. It looks and tastes so fresh and healthy! I'm so excited to share my big pot of soup with friends and family!

Fresh corn is awesome with the recipe. Most often I skip the cheese and purée it. I then serve in a bowl with a dash of heavy cream and tortilla chips.

This soup was delicious! Everyone in our family loved it. We added ground Italian sausage and garbanzo beans for some extra protein. So yummy! Also very good topped with Fritos!

I like this one because it does not have milk or cream or canned soup in it.  I did brown a lb. of breakfast sausage and added to the soup.  Just really good recipe, play with what you have on hand.  Thanks for this one!

Love this recipe- especially at the end of summer when I feel over run by zucchini and squash!  I prep the zucchini and squash and freeze and then make the soup all winter long.

Mmm this was so yummy! I expected this to be a little thicker and cheesier than it was so next time I may add more cheese.

Very easy to make and not a lot of time so this was a great weeknight dinner. My family loved this soup. I added Rotel and cumin based on other reviews I read. I have a family of three and have just enough left for my lunch today. The only thing that my family said was missing was a meat so maybe next time I will add chicken but I thought it was great like it was.

This recipe was awesome! I made a few very small changes: I used a can of tomatoes w/peppers and added about 3 Tbl. of jarred jalapeno slices chopped and used a full 32 oz. carton of chicken broth. My hubby likes spicy. It was so flavorful and colorful. Just a all around wonderful recipe. Thank you for sharing and will be making this again.

This soup was so good! I omitted the black pepper and cilantro, as the flavored tomatoes had enough of both to satisfy us. I loved it for the fact that I always have the items to make it on hand. It will become a regular in our house, to be sure!

Very good! I used half an orange pepper instead and a can of diced tomatoes. I chopped my veggies small for the kids and I added some protein with a can of rinsed white beans and 1/2lb of cooked ground turkey. They loved it!

This is a great recipe that is easy to customize - I added black beans and used Rotel instead of regular tomatoes.  I would have given this five stars if only it didn't have Velveeta (which I love, but shouldn't eat as much as this soup would have me eat).

I ended up using more onion therefore more broth.
16oz of the Velveeta Cheese and added 1 can of mild Rotel tomatoes.
I like spicy but used mild ingredients and did not add pepper (my husband was having stomach problems)...I still liked it.
The next time I'll use 1 can of medium Rotel tomatoes to spice it up for me:)

Delicious! I cooked the onion and garlic in oil, plated and set aside. Added a little more oil and cooked the squash. Plated that and sat aside. Poured the broth into the same big pot and cooked the frozen corn, which I prefer over canned. Added the tomatoes and chilies and cubed cheese.
Once the cheese was melted, I poured the onion, garlic and squash back into the mixture and added the chopped cilantro. 
This method allowed me to avoid overcooking any ingredients.

I made this twice. Once as written (minus the chili peppers, I subbed bell pepper for a little less spice) and again with my own modifications based on what I had. I LOVED both. The second time I added ground turkey which I had cooked in homemade taco seasoning. I didn't have cubed cheese so I just stirred in some Mexican shredded cheese and sour cream...yuuummm! It's seriously delicious. Served with tortilla chips or bread. Thank you for this refreshing and versatile recipe!

It is a great hearty soup & healthy.  Changes: I used more zucchini, squash, and chicken broth.  I only had diced tomatos instead of mexican style.  No cilantro.  I added carrots and used 6 oz shredded cheddar.  Will be making this again!  Will be perfect during Lent.

Very good recipe.  I used fresh tomato, fresh corn off the cob, and added fresh peppers for extra kick.  I gave this recipe a 4/5 only because it took way longer than shown in the original recipe to cook the veggies.  It was more like 25-30 minutes.

My husband liked it, I thought it was just okay. It took about 30 minutes instead of 10 for my zucchini and squash to get tender. If I make this again, I would quarter the zucchini and squash and then slice. Didn't really care for the pastuerized cheese flavor. Maybe sub real cheese instead next time. But, it did have some good spiciness to it. That was my favorite part!

I followed the recipe to the point, except i used green onions and a little basil with the oregano. I also added more cheese because it just didn't have a strong enough taste. I really liked it but my hubby wasn't so excited. He doesn't like chunky tomatoes in soup. He said it was only two stars. Weirdo! LoL

I added chicken and A LOT of cumin.  This recipe definitely needs more spice. In addition to cumin, I also added chili powder and some fajita seasoning.  I give it 3 stars as written, 5 stars with added seasoning.

Yummy! I didn't have the yellow squash so I used shredded hash browns which really went well in it. Next time I think I will cut back on the oregano, and maybe add some chicken. Great recipe though!

I liked this soup.  I thought it had nice flavor and was easy to throw together.  My husband liked it, but I think he is always hesitant to love something that doesn't contain meat.  It was a nice change and more along my tastes than the hubby.

My husband and I thought this was a very tastey soup.  I made it as written.  The broth was thinner than I anticpated and I felt the cilantro was overpowering.  I ate it again on day 2 and the cilantro mellowed out and the overall flavor was very good.  I enjoy spicy foods and considered substituting Rotel, as other reviewers mentioned, but stuck to the recipe.  I am glad I prepared this as written because with the cilantro and added spice, I think it would have masked the wonderful flavors of the vegetables.

Very good dish served with chips. My first bowl I thought it was good, but not very impressed - then realized I forgot to add the corn. I quickly added it and let it simmer another 5-10 minutes. Now I was very pleased. Later a fried boneless chicken pieces and this was extremely good!!!

Update, I made this again and it was awesome just as the other times. What I did this time though was I mixed some left over stuffing from stuffed bell peppers. My fiance' said it was the best yet and my son says he likes it now too.

delicious!  i used two large zucchini and 3 small yellow squash, which was a lot of veggies!  so i doubled up on the broth, last minute by adding 2 additional cups of beef broth i had left over in the fridge.   i normally am not a fan of processed cheese, but it's the perfect consistency and flavor for this recipe.   will def keep the recipe on file for future soup days!

This was AWESOME! I added some pieces of cooked chicken and also used Rotel as others suggested. I served w/a dollop of sour cream on top and crushed Tostidos chips on top. I gave some to my neighbor for her family and her 13 year old son requested some more for breakfast the next morning (which was his birthday). It was really delicious!

This was delicious. My mom used to make the same soup when I was a kid. She served it with her homemade tortillas. 5 stars!

This soup is awesome.  I also like using fresh tomatoes- about 4 small.  I also added some leftover chorizo sausage to the last bowl, and it was a great addition.  I'm also going to try making it with one less can of broth for a thicker soup.

Delicious way to use squash.  Husband loved it.  Made exactly by recipe but have sub'd Rotel when out of Mexican style stewed tomatoes and was great.  Cut squash into small cubes and also cut up tomatoes as I like small pieces of vegetables in soup.

This was really tasty.  We followed the recipe exactly except we used frozen corn instead of canned.  I did add about 1 1/2 - 2 Tbls of cornstarch and it still came out pretty runny, but the flavor was good.

My family loved this soup, we served it with warmed tortillas it was fantastic!  A great way to use zucchini and yellow squash when you have too much of it.
