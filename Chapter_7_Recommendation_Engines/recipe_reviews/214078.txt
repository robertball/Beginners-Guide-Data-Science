I liked this recipe. Thanks for sharing. It is most definitely an attractive dish and easy to make as well. It has wonderful flavor. I definitely recommend adding the tomatoes - I don't think they should be optional, as they added a wonderful flavor to the sauce that it needs! I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't sure if I was doing things correctly. I cooked the chicken just as stated in the recipe, but I thought it was weird to add the water when there was so much oil in the pan. I don't think it needs that much oil to brown the chicken either. Save the fat and cut it down a lot!.  When I made the sauce it said to "add it to the pot..." Does that mean the pot with the chicken, oil, & water in it?? I opted to make the sauce in a separate pot and am SO very glad I did! When the chicken was done I removed it from the grease & water and let it drain on paper towels (removed the skin too as we don't care for it). Then I put the chicken on a serving dish and put the sauce on top - it was beautiful! I served it with rice pilaf.  Thanks again and if the recipe submitter reads this please clarify if you leave the oil in the pan when adding the water to the chicken and also clarify how the sauce is made...in it's own pot or in the pot with the chicken.

I loved it. Also added a jar of peach mango salsa and a few large TBS. Of orange marmalade and a small can of water chestnuts.  Very tasty. I will definitely make it again.

Very good for my adult household of 5. I added dried basil, cumin and ginger to the flour, salt and pepper. Used green and red peppers along with onions.  And I had apple cider vinegar on hand.

In two separate pans I prepared boneless, skinless chicken for the meat eaters in my family and Quorn Nak'd Cutlets for the vegetarians. In a third pan, I made the sauce with extra water and cornstarch so there would be a larger serving.  We didn't have red peppers, so I substituted yellow, orange and red and omitted the tomatoes (picky eaters in my family).  The sauce was a bit tart without the tomatoes so I added some brown sugar.  This was a hit that everyone liked - super rare in my family!

Thanks for the great recipe.  I only changed items that I didn't have.  I used boneless chicken breast tenders, cherry tomatoes sliced in half, zuccini julliened instead of bell peppers and I swapped out one of the Tblsp of vinegar for lime juice.  I added extra water as it cooked.  Served with white rice.  It came out delicious.
