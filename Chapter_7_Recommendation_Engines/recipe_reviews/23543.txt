Very good, everybody loved it and it really is great for all seasons.  I am normally not a big fan of punch and will avoid making it when ever I can, but I actually really liked this punch and make it all the time.

I didn't really like this. I thought the pineapple juice was overpowering. I will not make again. Also, I definitely don't think you need to add the sugar, you get enough from the juice and the soda!

This recipe is AMAZING!  THANK YOU TANYA!  I was looking for a punch to serve at my wedding and wanted something that had a Carribean twist since my groom is Jamaican.  This punch was perfect.  The ginger, cinnamon, and pineapple juice come together so well.  I love it and can't wait to serve it to my guests!
