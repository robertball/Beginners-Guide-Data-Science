I left out the dates because I thought the cookies might be too sweet. My hubby tried them and loved them! I made them for a Christmas cookie exchange and had to make another batch just for him! Mine seemed to want to brown around the edges before baking throughout the middle, so be very careful not to burn! Great cookies

I found that with that many dates, that was the dominant flavor.  Also, the bottom of the cookies got too brown before the cookie was done.  I don't know if lowering the temperature and baking longer would help.

Not the recipe I was looking for. The cookies were too flat.
