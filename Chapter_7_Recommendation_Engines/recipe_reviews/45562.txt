Well J.D., I'm happy to be the first to review your recipe! We're from N.J. but we're a grits lovin' family and I must tell you that my kids went HOG WILD over this dish! I'm not into processed anything, so I finely grated a good cheddar/parm cheese and it worked out great. Certainly a combination that I would never have thought of and with a good splash from the hot sauce bottle, we had a delicious meal in under thirty minutes. Thanks a heap J.D.!!!!

I cooked 3 strips of bacon and then sauteed the peppers (used 2 whole), onion and garlic in the drippings, then continued as directed.  When i told my husband what I was making he said "Gross!" but changed his tune-ate 3 helpings, raving the whole time.  Thanks!

This was awesome. My husband ate the whole thing in one sitting!!

I did add bacon to the onion and pepper saute, which gave a little more flavor.

I will definitly make this again!

Awesome!  I used quick-cooking grits, and it still turned out great.  I cooked some bacon first, then used the same pan, including the bacon grease, to cook the vegetables.  What a great addition.  I also added a decent amount of seafood seasoning to the shrimp before cooking with the vegetables.  My boyfriend and I like to experiment with new meals, but we agree that this is going to become a regular meal we make!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This dish was delicious!  I made it for the three men in my family and they asked me to make it a standard dish. I didn't have red pepper, so I used a whole gr. pepper. Added bacon and grated sharp cheddar and parmesian as mentioned in other reviews. Didn't have grits so I used yellow cornmeal -so it was shrimp and polenta. Thanks for the recipe!

A great recipe.  I've done a few variations on this, sometimes adding tasso with the shrimp or for a more Jamaican/spicy theme adding diced jalepeno peppers (without seeds)!

This recipe is quite like the one I have been making for several years only I also saute equal amounts of celery with the peppers, more garlic and add about a Tblsp of "Liquid Crab/Shrimp Boil" and about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp cayenne or red pepper. That adds the needed kick!!

Very good.  I added a few things:
*I used sour cream instead of cream
*I used 1/2 cube vegetable bullion with grits
*I also used Old Bay seasoning

Loved it!!! I changed it just a little.  I seasoned the shrimp with garlic powder and Old Bay.  I also used my own recipe for cheese grits.  I prepared them with a can of chicken broth and stirred in cheddar cheese (not processed) when they were done.  Husband said he would like better without the cheese in the grits so next time I guess I'll make him his own grits cause I think the cheese  added the extra zing to this dish.  I will definitely make again.

Great recipe.. only a few moderations; I didn't have cream or red pepper,so I used a small can of diced tomatoes. Also added Old Bay Seasoning to onion/tomato mixture. I usually use Old Bay Seasoning when cooking any seafood as it really brings out the flavor. I used 4 pats of butter instead of olive oi for sauteeing. Had some maple sausage links in the fridge, so I cut them up(after fully cooking them) and added them to the mixture at the end!  Hubby said it was my best creation (I'm an amateur) yet. Even my Mother had 3 helpings!

I originally made this  for a bridesmaids luncheon in 2006. Only added sauteed bacon. Loved by everyone. Now I make it for my family without peppers & chicken broth instead of water for grits. Still terrific! Taste just like what I've had b/4 while visiting in Charleston SC.

Yum!  I couldn't get them cheesy enough for my taste, I added more than called for.  I used mild cheddar.  I also omitted the saute of peppers (we don't like them) and onions because we grilled our shrimp.  I did add plenty of garlic!  Thanks for the recipe!

I added bacon crumblesan used chicken broth vs. water. In retrospect, I would have put hot sauce in my grits. So good. It's a keeper !

My company just left, and I just had to write a review of this awesome recipe.  Everyone LOVED it, even my totally picky 19 year old!  I had something similar to this in a restaurant last month for $24 a plate - in fact, this might have been better.  I followed the recipe with these exceptions.  To the grits I added crumbled bacon and salt and pepper to taste.  In the shrimp stir fry, I used the entire bell pepper (total of 2) and  also sprinkled it with a little red pepper flakes for heat.  That's it.  WOW was this great... and simple!

Great recipe! We live in SC, and have gotten this several times at restaurants all over the state, but tonight we didn't want to go out, and there were shrimp in the freezer! My husband is allergic to cow's milk, so I used smoked goat cheese. The smoked flavor was wonderful. My husband said people would pay a hundred bucks for this dinner.

Loved this recipe.  It was easy, I added in some Old Bay Seasoning to the saute as well as extra salt and pepper, mushrooms for my husband and left out the peppers.  I used 8oz shredded pepper jack in the grits & sprinkled Old Bay, salt & pepper.  At the end I sprinkled crumbled pieces of bacon on top.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious! I cooked 3 strips of bacon, then added the vegetables and the shrimp. I also just followed the directions on the grits package (not instant) and added the cheese (cheddar) at the end. Such great flavors, even without the hot sauce (although I'm sure my husband liked it better with the spicy!).

It was pretty good. I sauteed the shrimp in bacon drippings with a little cajun seasoning then combined the bacon/shrimp with the vegtables. Next time I will add more salt and pepper to the grits, and blacken the shrimp on the grill

This was an nice quick recipe that everyone in my family.  Except my picky 6 yr old.  Cheesy grits were very filling and countered the bite of the peppers & onions nicely.  Next time, I'll probably use garlic salt & add some cajun seasoning to the shrimp.

Oh m,y this is good! Didn't change a thing, well, except I used Mexican Velvita, and these grits were awesome.  I had to enlarge the recipe for my family of wife, 3 teenage boys, and myself, and all of it was consumed, quickly.  Another nice evening in the Wells home.

If you can find it try this with the Kraft Garlic cheese that comes in a little tube instead of the plain processed cheese.

Wow - better than I thought!
Subbed 1/2 non-fat sour cream as I didn't have cream on hand.
Next time will use more Old Bay seasoning (and a dash more hot sauce). But, for a first time try, I liked this very much!  Used frozen, cooked shrimp (thanks to an amazing sale at the grocer) - and they worked very nicely.

just okay, nothing special - the grits were not as good as what i usually make and the shrimp was a little bland.

Very good!  I have never had shrimp and grits without a cajun flair, and I really enjoyed the straight-forward flavor of the combined foods with no cajun spices.  I will make this again for sure.

Pretty good! i made with scallops instead of shrimp and left out the peppers (personal preference) and then added a ton of chili powder.

I would never have put cheese grits and shrimp together but I have to say it's a tasty combo.  I followed others advice and fried a couple of slices of bacon in the pan before cooking the vegetables and that gave the shrimp a nice smokey flavor.  It's a quick easy delicious meal!

I'll make this again... the grits were good just as listed, but I'd jazz up the shrimp with maybe a minced jalapeno, some sliced black olives, some smokey paprika, and (of course) garlic!!  By the way, the leftover shrimp mixture and a little cheese was great in my omelet the next morning.

Delicious!  I had never tried making grits, so was a little anxious.  It was easy and tasted great with the shrimp.  Made it for a friend from Georgia, who gave it a thumbs up! Does need the hot sauce for a kick.

Very simple and delicious recipe. I used quick cooking grits which reduced cooking time by 15-20 minutes. I had Kraft singles on hand so I stirred those in to the grits and they melted nicely. Will definately make again.
Thanks for the recipe

I followed the recipe except for the liquids in the grits. I didn’t have any cream so I did half milk and half water. The grits were delicious And so was the shrimp and peppers and onions. This is a real easy dish to fix and is fancy enough to serve for company.

Simple recipe. I did add old bay on my shrimp, because I wanted them to have extra flavor. I am not sure the salt & pepper would have brought the flavors I wanted personally.

This is a great recipe! I made it as directed and added mushrooms and some Old Bay seasoning to the mix. The taste was not heavy and that is what I enjoyed.

Well, I found out I could make a credible grits/polenta/cornmeal mush from Marter White cornbeadmix using the original measurements in the recipe. Used left over Christmas ham for the smoky pork element and lots of peppers and onions, a can of diced tomatoes, a dash of cumin and ginger, and who bought so much shrimp for New Years Eve? I'm not sure what the ethnicity of my final dish would be, but it sure was a hit for brunch New Years morning!

So simple and really good! I added a little Old Bay seasoning to the shrimp for more of a creole flavor. But that was just my family's preference.

Unbelievable. This taste as good as what you can get in the restaurants, So easy. Used the chicken broth for the grits in place of water and used 4 cloves of garlic and shredded cheddar cheese too as others suggested since I don't use processed cheese. My whole family LOVED it. Thanks for sharing.

Half this recipe is fantastic. The other half needs work. The shrimp and veggies is very tasty. I only added just a few shakes of Old Bay and extra garlic. The grits need some flavor, they were very bland. Next time I'll use more than one type of cheese and choose cheeses that are quite flavorful.

I thought that this was okay, I did find it a little bland, even after adding bacon to the grits.  My husband said he liked it, but didn't eat any leftovers, which means he wasn't that crazy about it.
