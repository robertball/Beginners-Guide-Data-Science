I find this cake is dry & not soft which is not a hit to my family. The sugar is too much that I used 3 cups instead of 4 but its still too sweet for me. Sorry its not the kind of cake that I will make it again.

This cake is soooo good. My 12 year old daughter and I made this cake. The instructions were easy to follow. We altered it a lot. We used self rising flour and we added sour cream. It was so moist.We had too much batter. We made a bundt and a loaf. They even overflowed. This cake is a hit..... Thank you for the recipe.
