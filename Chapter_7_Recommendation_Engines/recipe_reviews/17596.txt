Hello.
 I am Egyptian, Very nice ingredients, it's almost how we eat it.
we usually ommit the red peppers
And sometimes we mix all ingredients in a blender
& it becomes a smooth creamy spread(i love that)
& other times tbsp Tahini is added, air dried beef slices & also 
crushed garlic cloves is almost a necessity
we don't usually add parsley though.

My husband is Egyptian and we make this (ful) at least once per week.  Usually, we sautee the onion and tomato in some olive oil first... then add the garlic... then add in the rinsed, canned beans.  Mash them with a fork.  And let cook.  Add salt & pepper, cumin, and 1 T or so of tahini.  A little lemon and parsley to finish.  Divine.  Really good served with eggs too... hard boiled are more traditional, but we also do sunny-side up and poached.  The yolky-bean mixture is yummy.

I was in egypt recently. They did eat this almost every morning. They did not put lemon in it. Instead they put lemon wedges in a bowl for you to squeeze on yourself. Typically they would smash all the beans with their fork and then scoop onto the pita bread!

This is the classic Middle Eastern way to enjoy fava beans.  I wouldn't call it a "dip" per se by American standards.  I always serve the beans in a bowl with pita bread or lavash (paper thin flat bread) on the side to dip in the liquid.  If you don't find fava beans in the supermarket, try a Middle Eastern grocery store.  They are also known as "foul mudammas" or "foul" (pronounced like 'fool'.)  Yes, the smell during cooking may seem unusual to you at first, but the taste is all its own - and delicious.  Thanks, Beverly, for sharing the recipe with everyone!

I made this for dinner because I couldn't wait until breakfast. It was soo  yummy. Really lemony, cuminy and tangy tasting. Also, it was so easy and extremely fresh-tasting. I loved it. Give it a try.

YUMMY!  Really unusual, delicious any time of the day.  I used home-cooked beans, plus some of their cooking liquid.

This is a great and simple recipe that has a lot of versatility.  I found the parsley to detract from the dish, however, and will take another poster's advice on putting in some garlic.  I didn't have pita bread so I substituted with flour tortillas, and it was better than you'd think.  I had a really tough time finding fava beans, for some reason.  Nobody at the store know what they were and I asked five people!  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

Pretty good.....

My husband is from Egypt and when my inlaws are here we eat it almost every morning for breakfast (I hated it at first cause I hate beans but once i had it pureed I was hooked and now I love this for breakfast, pureed or not).

A few notes:
Fava beans are a little smelly straight out of the can, don't be scared, they will not taste this way.
Definitely saute the onions in olive oil first, then when they are soft add the tomatoes until they are soft as well.
Add this to the boiled fava beans.  You can puree it (if you are really not a bean person) or mash it a little bit with a potato masher or fork.
1/4 cup of lemon juice is too much for 1 can of beans. i would start with 2-3 T and add if necessary.
Cumin is necessary and I recommend 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  I don't use red pepper.  For a time, I was not putting it in (because i think canned beans have enough sodium already) but there is definitely a difference in taste.  If you are concerned about sodium you can drain the fluid out of the can and replace it with an equal part of water.
1 1/2 T oil may not be enough depending on your tastes.  Mix that amount into the dish, and they you will need more to garnish the top with (I have seen my Mother in law use up to a quarter cup of oil but that is A LOT and another reason i hated this dish at first, I kept asking my husband "Why is she drowing it in oil, how fattening!"  however i have come to appreciate the taste and sometimes have to dip back into the serving

I am rating this five stars because this is a great dish, all the ingredients are correct, however the method is not. First, you saute the onion and tomatoes, until wilted.  Then you add the canned fava beans and let it cook, while mushing with your fork.  You add all the spices you wish to add (red pepper flakes is optional) and cumin is a MUST, however we dont add lemon, and parsley is only for garnish. I am arabic, this isnt just an Egyptian dish its a dish from the Arab cuisine.

My all time favorite dish. I guess being an Egyptian I was predisposed to loving this dip. Garlic isn't a must in this (I usually don't add it) and parsley is NOT typically used. I must have eaten this more than anything else. During Ramadan, this is almost always served for the pre-dawn meal. It fills you up as it's high in fiber and so very nutritious to keep you going through the fasting hours. Tahini (sesame paste) is a wonderful accompaniment to it and green onions too. The closest western relative to this is refried beans. Enjoy!

It took me a while to find canned fava beans (I heard they smell when you cook them).  I made this a little bit differently than the recipe.  I sauteed the onion, tomato and cumin with a a couple of cloves of garlic, a 1/4 tsp of ground coriander and a sprinkle of paprika.  After the veg were softened, I added in the lemon juice, allowed it to cook down a little then I added the beans, mashing them a little as they heated.  I served the fava with warm rye pitas and chopped cucumbers.  But I did a little research and often people eat this with a fried egg and harissa (hot pepper sauce).

This, my friends, is Egyptian comfort/soul food! Growing up, this was a breakfast, snack, lunch, dinner, fasting, whenever/whatever kind of food! Eating foul with pita bread is a MUST! Add the lemon to taste since it might be too strong for some. I also omit the red pepper and parsley as a personal preference.

Awesome recipe! I ate this for lunch yesterday because I was starving and it sounded good and quick.  The only thing I did a bit differently was that I added a bit of tahini.  I also used the immersion blender right in the pot, so it was smooth and chunky.  I had a ton of leftovers so this morning I heated a bowl up of the bean spread and topped it with a fried egg.  This probably isn't authentic, but the beans taste amazing with the runny egg!  As a breakfast its definitely very filling and nutritious!

I make a variation of these about once a week.  I usually end up serving them for a supper or for brunch.  I heat some olive oil on the stovetop and add some minced garlic which sautes for a few minutes.  Then, add the fava beans with liquid from can, salt, pepper, cumin, lemon juice, and a tablespoon of tahini.  Let this simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.  Then, lightly mash some of the mixture to thicken it up -- fava beans mixture is not as thick or pastey as hummus.  Add a tablespoon of freshly chopped parsley and mix in.  Serve in a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil on the top and some diced tomato and diced sweet onion in the center for garnish.

This is a very good recipe. But; feva beans in general is a very forgiving dish in Egypt. You can eat it individually with just some spices. Combine it with vegetables, Combine it with eggs (which is yummy), melting butter (which traditionally requires the dish to be beans, butter, salt & pepper only!) OR the famous Egyptian fava beans with linen seed oil (which is a bit chili if you're not used to it)! You can also serve it cold or hot. Just do diff alterations until you reach your desired preference!

Fava beans are in season right now in southern California so I had to test this out with fresh favas! And fresh, rich and delicious it is! I also used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh and cooked it a bit longer so the flavors could meld. The aroma is sure to peak the curiosity of your more "meat and potato" type of friends too.

Wessam and Imanlady are right... This is the way I learned from my Lebanese mother in-law...Absolutely cook this with hummus beans- chickpeas- as well.   Drain the beans, rinse, and boil for about 4 minutes. Meanwhile, crush+ grind garlic and 1/2 tsp. salt in a bowl with a "toom'/wooden crusher. Then, add lemon juice, and drain beans and stir into the mixture. You are going to add olive oil and more lemon juice when you start to eat it anyways- its part of the way ou eat it. Also, you can add the sauteed garlic/onions and tomatoes and spices- cooked alltogether, on top or mixed in, and we do sprinkle on the parsley. We eat it with pita, and also with cut radishes, hard boiled eggs, and fresh green onions, even garden greens. My oldest was eating green onions when she was 3 this way. My youngest finds the accessories too complicated- but asks for this at least 3x a week.  Yes, you are going to have garlic breath from Hell UNLESS you chew on fresh parlsey sprigs after!! Its the only thing that works. And, if you ever wondered why cultural people kinda smell funny, its because of the amount of garlic they eat...but they are the healthiest because of it!! How many Egyptians or middle-Easterns come down with a cold when they are eating their traditional food? Barely any. The garlic gets into your blood and kills viruses and germs. Proven fact. When I was first married and eating alot of garlic, my mom told me I stunk- even though I am an obsessively clean person! - and she is Fren

Excellent dish.  I made it with butter beans since that was all had on hand, and loved it.  Had it as a snack in the evening and then with hard boiled eggs for breakfast in the morning.  After this I went on a quest for Fava beans scouring every supermarket.  Finally I managed to find them in a middle eastern store.  Will be making this many more times.

I was looking up recipes to use my garden tomatoes and this came up. I had eaten something similar while in college, and liked it, and decided to try the recipe. I could not find fava beans in a can, so I went with northern beans. I added all the rest of the ingredients to taste doing about half suggested. I read the reviews that said that parsley was not traditional, so I just added a few pinches of dry for color and a little flavor. I don't like pepper so I left out the black and red. This still was pretty tasty. It reminded me of a thick white chili with lemon juice. I dipped some lebanese pita bread in it and it made for a filling late breakfast.

i used this recipe as inspiration but didn't follow the recipe to a tee.  i had fresh fava beans on hand so i shelled and parboiled them and shelled them again.  i then boiled them for a few minutes with a reduced amount of water and then added in onion, garlic, fresh tomato (minus the skin), tahini, cumin, salt & pepper.  after being boiled together i used a potato masher and mashed everything together (it still had a chunky look, it wasn't creamy).  i then plated it and drizzled extra virgin olive oil over the top and paired it with toasted ciabatta sliceds et voilet!  it was delicious!  even my husband who isn't a big fava fan loved it.  thank you for giving me a starting point with this recipe!

very good recipe quite authentic, I make these myself and also buy the ready seasoned tins.  If the smell bothers you then it might be best if you cook the beans yourself instead od using tinned, as its not so strong that way.  My family love to have this for breakfast and it really sets you up for the day, but you forgot the traditional topping...chopped boiled eggs.

Absolutely delicious! My boyfriend just recently converted to the vegetarian lifestyle, so I needed to find some recipes to help him stay on track. This is the first recipe I've tried and he loved it! He suggested to add corn next time. I changed some things a bit. Only used 1 large onion, minced garlic, 1 can of northern beans and crushed red peppers. Everything else was the same.

We liked this a lot - good filling breakfast!  For myself, I would add more red pepper to give it more of a kcik, but that's just a personal taste.  I would definitely make this again!

This had an interesting flavor ... we made it with fava beans from our garden which probably gave it a different tast (and was a lot of work).

I modified the ingredients to what I had on hand. I used black beans and salsa in lieu of fava beans and chopped tomatoes and onions. I think the fresh lemon is important, so I wouldn't leave it out (I'm lucky enough to have a lemon tree in my backyard). I ate it as a dip and a burrito filling.  I think it would be really good with avocado too!

very yummy- I had to make changes due to what ingredients I had on hand, I bought a can of fava beans to someday make this recipe but did not have everything else.  I used garlic powder and Goya Sofrito in place of the tomato and blended cooked mixture in the food processor and served with freshly hard boiled eggs and warm naan, yummy and healthy!  I have never eaten or seen a fava bean so blending it to look like refried beans was a little comforting :)

I've been making this recipe for a few years now...it's definitely a tried and true favorite.  lemony? check. garlicky? check.  All around delicious.  I make mine a little different than called for in the recipe directions - I saute the onions and tomatoes (and add a clove of minced garlic)until it's the consistency I'm looking for, then add the beans (mash) and rest of the ingredients (usually omit the parsley and red pepper).  I've eaten this the traditional way with Pita, but I seriously prefer it with a toasted bagel with cream cheese and a runny yolk egg.

My son is allergic to sesame (tahini) so I was looking for a substitute hummus recipe.  This is it!  He loved it (he's 2), I loved it, my husband loved it.  A keeper.  I didn't have fava beans, so I used butter beans.  Hey, they're similar, right?!

I followed the "muslim mom" reviewers suggestions.  Hot, with a poached egg on top for breakfast was good but later in the day, room temp with warm toasted pita wedges---yum! I thought it would be more filling.....  Love the lemon flavor.

Really like this and it's a keeper! I have had some variation of this before at home when my sister would make it for my dad or dad would make it. We are not egyptian nor lebanese so the way they made it was just to their liking not necessarily following a passed down traditional recipe. At any rate, I followed the method described by the reviewer adrienn8243 and I was absolutely happy with the final product. I used almost 3 cloves of garlic added after the onions and tomatoes sauteed then dumped the beans with water they boiled in and the water reduced as I continued to cook the dish so it was not soupy at all plus I mashed all the beans in the pan. Added abt a couple tsp of tahini and some lemon juice. Delicious, quick, and easy to make.

I understand this is supposed to be for breakfast, but I made it for dinner. I liked it a lot and so did my dinner company. We stuffed it into pita. Next time I'll add a little more lemon juice. This might be good with some eggplant too.

I really didn't like this.  I was expecting more of a hummus consistency with fava beans and it ended up being more like a stew.

Wonderful recipe!  Thank you!  I found frozen fava beans at Whole Foods and didn't know what to do with them.  This was great!  

I changed it just a bit based on the Egyptian reviewer.  I sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil over medium heat.  I added my thawed fava beans, cumin, salt, and pepper and cooked for about 5 minutes.  I added chopped grape tomatoes (it was all I had) and cooked for another 3 minutes to soften.  I added this to the blender with a little chopped parsley and the juice of 2 lemons.  Delicious!  The texture was velvetty smooth and the flavor was great.  

I plan to serve it warm with toasted pita triangles but it would probably be good cold also.  It would also be a great soup thinned out with a little chicken or vegetable stock.  A keeper!

I had some fresh fava beans from the farmers market and didn't have a clue what to do with them as I've never tried them before. This was EXCELLENT! I omitted the parsley and added garlic as suggested. My husband said it smelled terrible (like poop actually) but he hates anything with cumin. That just meant that I got to eat the whole batch myself! :) Try it - it's great! Thanks for the recipe!

This is an easy, tasty recipe.  I used black beans instead of fava, which isn't at all the same but still tasted all right (fava beans are hard to find), and also omitted parsley and added garlic and tahini.  And I blended it.   Good meal and works for leftovers.

I used 3 cloves garlic and halved the parsley.  I used GOYA pigeon peas from the spanish food section, b/c I couldn't find FAVA at three stores.  I used wraps rather than pita.  It didn't make me think breakfast at all.  I served it at a party and it didn't get touched.  I think it was b/c of its less than ordinary appearance.  So you probably shouldn't serve it at a party unless you have an adventurous crowd.  I brought it home and my family & I loved it.  I will definately make it again for my family but not for a big party with a spread.

My partner absolutely loves this! She's from Texas and I'm from Hawaii-- we have no familiarity with Egypt (yet), but this was just delicious. We leave out the ground red pepper and use black. We've used dried fava beans, but they are a lot of work. I'll try canned next time. Thanks!

Delicious!  I sauteed the onion and tomato in some olive oil first and then added the beans and the seasonings.  This makes for a good, unique breakfast (at least in my house) and I think it would be just as tasty for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe, Beverly!

I didn't cook the tomato, instead I garnished with it and green pepper strips.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh.  This doesn't have to be limited to breakfast, my version made a great lunch on a rye tortilla!

Great!  I used fresh fava beans.  I made the following modifications suggested by other reviewers:  sauteed the onion with 3 cloves minced garlic in the oil first, added the tomatoes and let them soften, then the beans and other ingredients plus 2 tbsp of tahini sauce.  I left out the red pepper.  I plated it with a runny fried egg on top of each serving, which we mixed together with the beans, and stuffed it all into a warm pita.  Wonderful!  Very healthy.  Very interesting flavor.

Wonderful flavor - great way to start your morning with veggies!  I used 2 kg of fresh fava beans that I boiled for about 3 minutes, and peeled 1/4 of.  The unpeeled ones I pureed in a mini chopper.  I followed the suggestion to saute the onions and tomatoes with 3 cloves of garlic first, and I omitted the parsley.  Will definitely make again.

This is a wonderfully simple recipe of the kind that sets off other ideas.  The can of favas that I bought some time ago and never knew quite what to do with turned out to be a good purchase.  I'll be stocking up on more.

This was OK. Nutritious and easy to make. Before I squeezed lemon juice in it, it tasted just like refried beans but lemon made a big difference in flavor. My Israeli friend told me that this dish is good when hummus is mixed in.

After reading thru some reviews I replaced the parsely with a couple cloves of pressed garlic. In the end it was quite tasty but still missing something. I spread a little tahini dressing over brown rice and topped with the fava mixture. YUM. (I'd advise trying to avoid the aroma of the freshly opened beans if you're unfamiliar like I was, whoa!! Luckily it goes away)

Wow.  Good stuff.  I'm glad I put just a bit in a ramekin and the rest in the fridge, or I would have certainly eaten it all by now.  I used cannelini beans because that's what I had on hand, and added garlic.  I rinsed the beans and used a little tomato juice instead of the slimy bean water.

I thought this was very good and really easy to make.  My husband however ... took one bite and said "I don't like it."  I will probably make it again but not for breakfast.  It seems to be more of a dip (almost hummos like) that a breakfast meal for us.  Thanks.

A wonderful dip! Easy too!  As suggested, I replaced the parsley with 3 cloves of minced garlic and pureed the mixture for a smoother dip. And in case the directions aren't clear, I used the liquid from the canned faba beans.  I could've sworn faba and fava beans were the same thing!

This is fantastic!  My husband is addicted.  The only change I made was to leave out the parsley and puree.  We ate it all in a couple of days, so I went right back out to the store today and no fava beans...  So I got "faba" beans.  Sounds similar, so I rationalized.  It's still a lovely bean spread, but the favas really make it!

This is a great recipe, very tasty. I like to mash the beans a little and we eat it with pita bread.

My husband and I loved this.  I found the bean water scarily slimy too, so I rinsed the beans.  Think I added a little too much lemon juice, though, so I'll have to watch out for that next time.

I didn't like this.  I thought the beans smelled gross.  I didn't use the liquid from the can b/c I was scared it would make it smell worse.  I used water.  I replaced the parsley with garlic as others suggested.  I found a quarter cup lemon juice was too much.  We mixed the cooked Fava Beans with yogurt and ate it so it got rid of that smell.  I think it would have tasted better if we mixed it with hummus.  I'm giving it 3 starts b/c for some reason my husband really liked it.  I wouldn't want to eat this again.

I made this for my children and they all loved it. It was easy to make, and they are all requesting that I make it again! I often prepare black beans in much the same way, blending them to make "refried beans" for burritos.
