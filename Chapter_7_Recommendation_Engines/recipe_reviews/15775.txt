I decided to ignore the first review and try this anyway.  The thought of fresh orange peel and ginger swirled with the yams sounded so good, and I figured the turnips wouldn't hurt it any.  Well, nobody in my family liked this even a little bit, and we are pretty adventuresome eaters.  Overall the flavor was bitter, not the sweet/spicy combination I had imagined.

Turnip is a bitter veggie. Boil the sweet potatoes separately as they take less time to cook. If you want turnip in your diet this recipe is flavourful without having too much fat (I use oil instead of margerine). I use orange peel from the spice rack--not fresh--therefore this recipe takes a minute after boiling. Easy!

There is no need for margarine or sugar. The taste of the turnips is somewhat hidden by the taste of the sweet potatoes.  Best when warm!

Keep in mind that ultra-bitter turnips do exist (they were not well watered). However, mild turnips are *typically* what is found in stores. Either way, most turnips are very easy to turn into great food. Bitter turnips need a little extra help is all. When/if you have especially bitter turnips, try comparing this recipe to the Turnip Casserole at this same site. In that recipe the turnips do not even hide behind other veggies. It is sweetened (can use stevia) much like a sweet potato casserole (reference that recipe but add more sugar IF needed because of bitter turnips). For most turnips, the Turnip Casserole is sweet and light. Using all turnips or only some turnips in any sweet potato recipe cuts calories down a LOT, so it really is worth a few tries. Me? I'm a fan of turnips several ways now! Allrecipes has helped us develop some of our own favorites! Turnip fries don't go well with everything, but they are fabulous with Reuben Sandwiches, especially dipped in ketchup and mustard together (sounds funny, but it's really good). Turnips sauteed in a bit of oil and butter, then seasoned with a bit of stevia or sugar, S&P, and balsamic vinegar to taste? It's now one of my favorite veggies. Also, for anyone who likes horseradish and caramelized onions, there is a mashed potato recipe on this site that includes horseradish and caramelized onions: working some (or all) turnips into that recipe is divine (and, of course, cuts calories while upping veggie intake). Fabulous! Enjoy!

Turnips need at least 5 minutes to cook before adding the sweet potatoes. As it stands, the textures were off and didn't blend well.

Wow, this is delicious, and very easy.  I used white salad turnips from the garden  and actually yams, because grocery  was out of sweet potatoes.  This is good enough for Thanksgiving.

My husband hated the orange in the recipe (possibly the ginger, too, but he wasn't aware that was in there).  I will make this recipe again omitting the orange and possibly the ginger as well.  I found it OK with those two items but not a favorite.
