I won a potluck contest with this recipe today! I've made this dessert twice and like it better with fresh peaches. I also like the fact that it calls for reduced fat cream cheese and light cool whip. Next time I might sub half the cheese for fat free. Overall a very easy no-bake dessert that I'll use for years to come!!

The taste was good but it was a bit messy. It definitely didn't cut into nice little squares like the picture shows. Wasn't presentable.

I took this to a dinner party the other night and it was a huge hit.  Because of the time of year I had to use peaches I had canned (from my tree).  I also topped it off with fresh blueberries sprinkled with icing sugar.  It was so fresh and a nice treat for the winter!

Easy, refreshing, loved by all.  Thanks! Note: Have used the reduced fat cream cheese,and sugar free jellos with equal success!
