Very good.  If you like this try the one with Cream of Chicken soup, Mayo, and Curry.  It's a soup can recipe and is good.

This was much better than I expected. I have never used cauliflower to replace pasta before and it was a huge success. I didn't have mayonnaise at home so substituted with Miracle Whip which gave it a little extra tanginess.  Definitely going to make this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe

This is delicious! As a 17 year old amateur, I would say this was an easy but lengthy process. I had to google how to measure the cauliflower and broccoli by cups by grams, but that was really the only challenge. Boiling the chicken was questionable, but came out great. Super yummy! Especially with fresh veggies! Also, I didn't have a steamer, so I just threw the cauliflower and broccoli in a microwave safe bowl with a cover and a bit of water for 3-4 minutes. Much easier and faster!

I made the casserole.  It was tasty, although a bit on the heavy side.  Also, it made a lot of servings.  This might be something I would fix in the future for a large gathering.

Will surely make this again. I think I may experiment with spicing it up some to taste. If you are cooking for two like I am, be aware that you will have a lot of left overs. Also found a short cut on the cauliflower grind. You can buy it frozen like that at the supermarket. The frozen version is sold as a substitute for rice.

This recipe was great. I thought it would be bland but it was full of flavor. Only changes I made was using frozen riced cauliflower.  Loved that this did not use canned soup. My son and his friend (16 and 18) loved it as well. Making this again for sure.

Used 1 package of Trader Joe's Broccoli & Cauliflower.  Used 2 cups of leftover over rotisserie chicken.  Next time I would decrease the chicken broth to about 3/4 cup.

Absolutely delicious!  I just wish there was a nutritional breakdown and not just the number of calories.  Also I had three large chicken breasts but did not increase the other ingredients. I got eight servings at least and filled a 9 x 10 casserole dish.

I make this on a moderately regular basis but changed a few things this time. I didn't make cauliflower rice, just broke it up and didn't steam either of them, the baking process cooked them fine. I also added several things the made it better. I used urfa pepper instead of regular pepper, I added a 1/4 cup of miso paste and pureed 3 black garlic bulbs with a little of the chicken stock. These changes made it amazing and it was already really good.

My family loved it. Just be sure to not add too much chicken as I did since I didn't measure it out and I could tell It would have been wonderful with the right ratio on my part. (my mistake) we will be making this again.

I used chicken thighs instead of breasts and rice instead of riced cauliflower. The sauce has a unique and delicious taste that made this casserole a new meal in the rotation.

Very good,but l made changes. Any time a recipe calls for heavy cream(all cream soups) or half and half,l substitute canned SKIM milk. This cuts the fat and calories way down with minor taste and consistency difference.

This was ok.. I thought it was a bit rich though.  Probably won't make again. ... at least not this recipe.
