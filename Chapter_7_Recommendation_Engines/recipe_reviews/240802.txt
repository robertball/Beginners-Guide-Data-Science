Oh YUMMMMM!!!! This was a HUGE hit with my guys (and me)! I did try to lightened it up a bit by using less olive oil and butter and using whole wheat bread crumbs, which worked out perfectly! This is so flavorful and just enough spice...an absolute, definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

WOW...mouth watered the whole time I was preparing it. SO glad I gave it a shot, that hot sauce spoke to me. The heat turned out milder than you would think as it was cut by the butter and wine. My husband says it's "good enough for Dinner Group" and would like it weekly. Now the part I hate when other people do, my changes: used 1.5 lbs for 2 people and have leftovers for another meal, had panko so used that, used 1/4 c oil to toss (I think it could be 1/8 c), had fresh garlic so used that, used combination of hot sauces that I had, oh and used gruyere (on sale but I loved the earthy taste against the hot sauce and would repeat). I'll try maybe hotter and uncovered more next time for a crispier topping. I used a spatula to lay on top the linguine (and keep the crispy on top) then spooned some extra pan sauce on pasta. Easy too. The most time consuming was peeling the shrimp (again, easy-peel was on excellent sale) Thank you for sharing Lisa!!! YUM!

This is fabulous.  I didn't change a thing except maybe a little extra cheese and a couple minutes more in oven with cheese (large shrimp).  My persnickety mother loved it.

I had to multiply the servings for a large dinner group, basically to 8lbs of shrimp (16-20 big boys).  Everything was great, but personally took it down in some aspects to suit our tastes.  I halved the wine and substituted in fresh lemon juice for the other half.  I did half bread crumbs and half panko.  I halved the oil and the butter (just seemed too much) and it was still more than enough.  The only "tweak" to cooking it I made was I reserved some of the bread/panko mixture and after it baked, added some more of the bread layer just before the cheese, then broiled for about 10 minutes.  EVERYONE loved it, especially my "culinary" elders who are very hard to please.  I've already been asked to share the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  After adding the final topping, I put it on broil for a few minutes.  Sauce was amazing.  For the hot sauce I used Sriracha, but a bit less than the recipe called for.

I made the recipe according to the ingredients and directions with the exception of halving the recipe for my husband and I.  We had generous portions, and there was still a serving left over for lunch the next day.   Served over fettuccine with a salad.  It was so, so, delicious.  Best of all, it was a very simple and a quick recipe to prepare.

This was pretty great. I used jumbo shrimp, panko, and 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic. The only thing I think I'd do different next time is ease up on the hot sauce. Just a little though. ??

This dish is awesome! I'm not a huge fan of hot sauce so I was a little skeptical but the flavoring is really good- just adds a little kick. One thing I did to cut down on oil, is toss the shrimp in oil to coat, then put the shrimp in bread crumb, garlic, salt & pepper mixture, then place in pan.  I didn't use fresh parsley, just used Italian style breadcrumbs with parsley in it. The last 5 mins of baking, I broiled it. Served over angel hair pasta (mixed with tiny bit of olive oil ang garlic).  It looked very "gourmet" and tasted fabulous! So glad I tried it.

We tossed the shrimp with the bread crumb mixture before baking. It did take a little longer to cook. This was very good and we will have it again.

I made this last night as written and the dish came out well. I liked the flavor, I just couldn't get used to the bread crumbs. I have never associated shrimp scampi with bread crumbs but that was just personal. Otherwise the recipe was easy to follow and the shrimp came out  well. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It possibly rates five stars, but due to some unexpected—and unavoidable—circumstances, it cooked longer than the recipe recommended. Still, it was very, very good. I’m usually a traditionalist, so the idea of baking scampi put me off, but the reviews won me over. I’m glad they did. Not only was it delicious, but because our dinner was delayed, baking the shrimp in the sauce kept them from being dried and tough. The hot sauce, too, was out of the norm, but really worked. Full disclosure: I lived in New Orleans for a few years. It was like going back.

This was literally one of the best meals I've ever made!!! I cut the recipie in half and so I think I made too much of the sauce-it seemed a little greasy but I think that was cook's error?? Honestly so easy and so so so good!!! Definitely making again!!!

YUMMY! I was looking for a scampi alternative and this recipe is delicious.  The touch of hot sauce was wonderful. So easy and fast... two more reasons to put this recipe into regular rotation.

Oh my God, this was sooo delicious!!!  I halved the recipe for us and it was easy and perfect!   I used small cooked frozen shrimp and Cochula hot sauce.   I didn't have fresh parsley so I used a little dried.  I also tossed a little butter and more Parmesan into the linguine.  Served over whole grain linguine.  Can't wait to have again - thanks so much for submitting , knlneal!!!

Really delicious.  I did cut back on the olive oil and will use even less next time as it was a bit greasy.  The hot sauce gave it a good flavor.  I used very large shrimp, panko breadcrumbs  and a good sauvignon blanc wine.   I like that it all goes in one pan and bakes evenly so there is no judging whether shrimp is done by sauteing and turning in a fry pan.

It was fabulous.  I made only a few minor changes:
I used less oil, I used a little Sriracha sauce (didn't have any Lousiana hot sauce on hand), and I added some oregano and basil to the seasoning.

I followed the exact recipe, except maybe more Parmesan :-) it was SOOO good! I served it over buttered and garlic salted angel hair pasta. I made this for my husband on Valentine's Day and it was a hit! It was perfectly fancy. It did have a kick of spicyness. I will definitely make this again but I will ease off the hot sauce just a little bit. Definitely a gr at shrimp recipe!

This is absolutely wonderful. I renamed it creole shrimp scampi and I used shaved real garlic instead of powder. The spicy aspect makes this have a decidedly Louisiana style rather than Italian. I like the "regular" style Scampi too, but this is very special and even hubby who does not like spicy food said this was great. My son went nuts over it. I had to give him the recipe. Thanks for posting this!

I have tried several Shrimp Scampi recipes, but this one is by far the best. The only thing I changed was the amount of hot sauce..I didn't use quite as much..otherwise I followed the directions exactly, and it is fabulous!! Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I would reserve half of the butter/wine and dress the noodles, but this was excellent.  Very simple and a lot of flavor.

First time making shrimp scampi. Was not nearly as good as my mom's (though this is her recipe) still pretty good. Must have been because I didn't use Louisiana hot sauce or maybe it's because Lisa wasn't making it for our family. Either way still proud!!

Thought the hot sauce would be too much.  Oh no...  butter and wine calmed it right down. Lots of flavor.

Hubby loved this.  Forgot to add the red pepper but did not miss it.  Would make again.

Yummy and Easy! I skipped the wine, but we didn't miss it. My husband raved about it over and over.

Lowered the amount of hot sauce, increased butter.  Great meal.  Used already cooked jumbo shrimp and reduced cooking time by 15 minutes.  Perfect.

This was the best Shrimp Scampi I have ever made.  OMG!  The Hot Sauce with the Wine made the sauce finger-licking good.  My family absolutely loved it.  Changes I made:  I diced 4 cloves of garlic very fine instead of using the pinch of garlic powder and sprinkled it over the over the shrimp prior to pouring the sauce on.  In a separate pot, I boiled a pot of linguine.  After the shrimp scampi was done in the oven, I poured the shrimp over the linguine and placed it on a lovely platter.  Voila!  It was exquisite!  Oh and instead of using so much Olive oil, I coated the shrimp lightly with the olive oil before spreading it in the glass casserole dish.  I swear if I was paying for this dish in a restaurant, it would have been considered one of the more expensive choices on the menu.
