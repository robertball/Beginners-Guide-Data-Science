Very simple and very good. I had forgotten horseradish for the sauce to go with a ham. This sauce went really well with the ham and rice. Creamy and tangy similar character to horseradish sauce. PS. I added a dash of ground red pepper for a little extra zing.

Great sauce! I was looking for a different sauce to use in a casserole of Kielbasa noodles and spinach. So many pasta dishes are generic and often times boring at potluck supper. This sauce made the dish very tasty and healthier than cream based sauces!
