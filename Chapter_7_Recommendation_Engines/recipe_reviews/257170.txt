I make a lot of bread and this was the easiest dough that I've ever worked with. We never have lard in the house so I went with olive oil. I couldn't get mine to brown without oil so I brushed a little of the flat top and they immediately puffed up and browned. This is a very easy recipe and I'm surprised that no one's made it before now. Thanks for sharing.

This is perfect. Just like the Italian restaurant I love.
