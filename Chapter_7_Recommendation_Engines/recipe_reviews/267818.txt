This was really yummy!  I made it in a 9x13  pan and used about 3/4 of a HUGE baguette of French bread.  (If I remember correctly the recipe didn't say what size the  pan should be and it didn't give an exact size for the baguette, which I realize is hard to do because they vary.)  I followed the recipe as it was and everyone that tried it liked it.  (I made it for Thanksgiving.)  I think it would be really good with a little cinnamon and/or nutmeg mixed in with the brown sugar topping.

This pecan pie bread pudding is really easy to make. I used all ingredients, except I only added 1/2 cup of sugar to my melted butter as I didn’t want it to be too sweet! Turns out perfect for us! Will definitely make this again!

I made no changes, served it with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.  Everyone loved it!  This is the most popular dessert I've ever made.

It was a party hit!  Would definitely make it again.  I made it earlier that day and served warm.

I thought I loved regular bread pudding, but this is the best I’ve ever eaten. My entire family loved it. Will be making this again.
