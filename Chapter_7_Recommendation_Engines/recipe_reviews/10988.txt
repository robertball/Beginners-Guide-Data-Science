If you are looking for "fried coconut eggs", this is your recipe.  There was absolutely no resemblance to a cookie whatsoever.  It was a real mess.  I added about a cup of flour to the mixture, and it baked up like cookies (15 minutes), but then they were dry.

Not bad - I wonder if the author made a mistake in the recipe - the ingredients say 2 eggs, but the instructions mention "the egg".  I tried it with 2 eggs first, looked really sloppy so threw that batch away and made a 2nd batch using just one egg - turned out good.

Try using an electric wisk it makes the eggs and sugar more fluffy and add additional coconut and walnuts(optional)to make the cookies a little bit thicker.

My family and I found these to be the best coconut cookies. I had bought the coconut for my Christmas cookie the usuall macaroon. but I forgot the can milk needed to make them I jumped on to all recipes and as usuall it saved my day and a trip to the store.  
I whipped the eggs and sugar in my mixer till they were a lemon color. they came out great.

I'm gonna go with the middle rating, but unfortunately, I had the same miserable experience as some of the other reviewers. However, I believe I must have done something wrong. If other people made it and it came out good, it must be possible. Firstly, I think I had a scant cup of coconut. Secondly, I had a large egg. Mine weren't quite as runny as the others (maybe they had JUMBO eggs?). But they still made a disaster of my cookie sheets and only held up in the center. I'd probably make sure I had enough coconut, and use a medium egg if I made them again. I'm not sure I wouldn't just try a different recipe first though. Shame - they seem to have potential... if you can figure them out.

Use 3 egg whites,add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar when you whip eggs in mixer on high. Substitute 1/2 tsp stevia instead of sugar, carefully fold in fluffed up cocoanut as not to ‘break’ the meringue. Use cooking spray on parchment paper.

Instead of two eggs, just use one, and add more coconut if needed. You should be able to gauge the texture by feel. I didn't add as much sugar as the recipe called for, and used unsweetened coconut. You can add either lemon or lime juice to create a bit of a different flavour profile. Or dip the tops in melted chocolate. A hot all around, every time I make them.

I ended up adding an additional 2-3  cups of coconut, baked them a little longer and they were a complete hit.

Having a late night sweet tooth and only a few ingredients I opted to give these "cookies" a try despite the somewhat negative reviews. I only used one egg and I spruced it up by adding some chopped almonds and semi-sweet white chocolate chips. they turned out AMAZING!

I had several snacks to choose from and these went the fastest by far.  I added extra coconut to thicken it up and left it in a few minutes longer than called for.  Great cookies!

Ok......they looked like fried eggs.  I'm out of coconut so there's no way I can try it again. There must be a mistake with the eggs or instead of "whisking" maybe a hand mixer should be used. The remaining batter I added 1/3c sugar, about 1/3c oatmeal and chocolate chips and the batter did the same thing.

This was horrible, "cookies" did not cook, I added extra coconut to begin with to try to frim it up some, but had to add flour after cooking the first batch. the ones with flour had no taste. So when it comes to this cookie you have three choices. Have a mess of a cookie, add flour and take away flavor, or just stop before making it to begin with. I will chose the last one from now on.

Good cookie.  I put in more coconut then it called for and it helped firm them up a bit.  Great for coconut lovers.
