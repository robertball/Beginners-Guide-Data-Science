I followed the recipe exact, only using CHEESECAKE instant pudding and half semi-sweet/half dark chocolate chips because I had a half bag of each to use up. I did use organic flour and eggs and half butter/half margerine. The cooking time was not right for me. 375* was way too hot and they burned fast but 350* for 10 minutes was perfect. All three of my men LOVED these cookies and my husband remarked that the cheesecake pudding was a really good addition. I thought this was a particularly pretty looking cookie. I would recommend that you chill the dough for an hour or two so it has time to firm up a bit and let the cookies firm up on the cookie sheet before taking them off so they don't fall apart. NOTE: Half gone since this morning. OMG, huge hit!

I thought these were ok. I have had better.In the list of ingredients it says use margarine, but in the recipe it says butter. I used margarine but either way I would not make these again.

very nice cookie.  I like the fact that they are not sickening sweet however sweet enough.  I added a bunch of hangerson..M&M's, choc. swirl chips, choc. chips and raisins to equal the two cups.  I had a French Vanilla mix.  I did add 1/2 tsp. salt which I think helped with what others complained of the blandness problem.  Very nice soft cookie for a change of pace w/a bit of crispness.  9 minutes on a teflon sheet was perfect.

What a great cookie recipe.  Depending on the type of pudding you use, the possibilities are endless for your flavor combinations.  I only had chocolate pudding so that is what I used.  I also had about a 1/4 cup of peanut butter chips left over, so I threw those in with the 2 cups of chocolate chips.  The only thing I was confused about was the 3.4 oz box of pudding.  Maybe because I used fat free sugar free pudding the size was different, but I had both small (1.4 oz) and large (2.1 oz) boxes.  So, to be safe I threw both in.  In response to the reviewer that felt the cookies had a chemical taste maybe it had to do with the type of pudding they used.  I was afraid of this since I used the fat free sugar free variety, but I detected no strange after taste.  The cookies do not spread much and frankly my daughter and I had fun making them.

This recipe is excellent.  I've been making them for about a year and that's the only kind of chocolate chip cookies that my husband will eat now.  I made these for him to take deer hunting and the guys he went with even asked for the recipe! This is definitely the best recipe ever!  I'm currently making the cookies using chocolate pudding and semi sweet and white chocolate morsels.  The only thing I changed was that I addred 1/4 more flour.  Definitely a keeper!

I think I expected more from these cookies based on the reviews.  They did keep their shape nicely and they are versatile however I thought they had a distinctly chemical taste, probably from the pudding. I will not make these again. I did find that the Outrageous Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe from this site was excellent.

This is my favorite cookie ever... my mom and I used to make them when I was a kid... the recipe was originally on the inside of a jello pudding box.  It's really chewey, so it's necessary to let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet before moving them so they don't tear.  YUM!

This is a great recipe. I had a similar ones years ago and lost it - but this is almost exactly like it. I do agree with a previous reviewer who suggested adding a tsp of salt. It gives the right combination of salt and sweet - very balanced. Without it I think they would have seemed lacking in flavor.

I also made this with White Chocolate pudding - very nice.

These were tasty and soft but not dense enough for me. Plus, I took other reviewers suggestions & added some salt and 2 tbsp of vanilla instead of 2 tsp. Needs something more, but havent figured it out yet. THanks!

cookies are very moist and chewy, but lack some of the buttery/ salty flavor I enjoy in chocolate chip cookies.

Awesome recipe; it's definitely my go-to cookie.  I just added 1/4 more flour for high altitude and some extra vanilla.  Seriously, this is a keeper.

Very good choc chip cookie recipe.  These are my kids favorites.  I halved the butter and reduced the number of choc chips (and added walnuts) and the cookies are still perfect.  I am baking these once every couple weeks now instead of buying packaged cookies.  Thanks!

I thought these were okay. I wanted a chewy, flavorful cookie. I thought they were light and sorta cakey with a chemically boring flavor. I thought they were easy to make and looked beautiful so they get some stars, but far from good enough to make again. 
I added 1/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp vanilla and removed 1 TBSP of the cheesecake pudding mix. If you want a good-looking chewy centered crispy edged cookie with flavor, this is NOT it, even with changes. If you want a cookie to use on the set of a movie for looking only, these are perfect.

These. Are. Amazing. The only changes I made were to bake them at 350 for 10 minutes instead of the given temperature and to use mini chocolate chips because it's what I had on hand. So soft and great flavor!

Mmm. While writing this, my 19 year old son just said, "oh, thanks for the cookies mom, they were really good." Mine didn't turn out chewy, but had more of a somewhat chewy, flakiness to them. How in the heck can a cookie have chewy and flakiness at the same time? And what does that even mean? I don't have a clue. So, if you want something different from the chewy cookie, or the hard cookie, this one's for you. Just for the record, I used sugar free vanilla pudding, (that's all I had), butter, and 1 tsp. salt.

The instant pudding really makes these cookies something else.  When my friend and I made a bunch of different chocolate chip cookie recipes to have our friends rate at a party, this recipe won for chewy chocolate chip cookies hands down.  If you prefer chewy chocolate chip cookies to crunchy ones, you'll never need another cookie recipe!  Thank you to Bonnie for posting the best cookie recipe ever!

I'm new to baking, and this recipe was so easy to follow. Everyone loves them!!! Great cookie!! You can't go wrong with this recipe!! I always end up with 36-45 normal sized cookies though... Which is even better! I do add some salt and always try different chips.

Very moist & good! Used white chocolate chips because that's what I had in pantry. Not that fond of dark chocolate, anyway. Took them to work, & had a couple of people ask if they were macadamia nut cookies. They didn't last very long. Will definitely make again & again.

mmmmmmmmmm These were so good. I used chocolate pudding mix and the cookies were awesome, soft on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside and just good all around, although a little heavy. I would make these again for sure.

What a fun recipe to experiment with different puddings & chips! I made these  with chocolate fudge pudding mix & andes chocolate mint pieces + a few leftover semi-sweet chips I had left-TO DIE FOR!! These are nice plump cake-like moist cookies-love that!! I did add 1 tsp of salt w/the flour mixture & the recipe said to stir in the flour mix to the rest but I actually just mixed it together w/my hand mixer & had no problems at all! Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

The batter tastes better than the cookies.  The pudding gave them too much of a cake consistency.

Great recipe. My family loves these cookies. I was looking for a different chocolate chip cookie recipe for my teenage son to make on his own, which turned out to be a great recipe. The cookies were really good and disappeared quickly. Like other reviews, we made some minor changes. We used 1 tsp of salt, used half crisco and half butter. We also melted half of the butter to make the cookies more moist and used Nestles semi-sweet chunks instead of chips and the cookies came out really moist and kept their shape wonderfully. We will definitely make these again. We were very pleased with how they turned out. my son even made the cookies a little bigger than recommended and we were able to make a little over 2 dozen of cookies. They were just sweet enough but not too sweet and also looked great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Yum, Yum and yum!  I tried a few batches.  I used both vanilla and chocolate pudding.  I also used combos of heath bits, chocolate chips, butterscotch and peanut butter chips.  Yum!

I absolutely love, LOVE this recipe. I do not make any other chocolate chips but these. I can use this recipe two ways - the first way is as the recipe states. The second way is instead of using vanilla pudding, I use chocoalte pudding and replace the chocolate chips with white chips. Kind of like a reverse chocolate chip cookie AND just as good!!

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe ever! I have made these cookies more times than I care to count! And with several variations - vanilla pudding and chocolate chips, cheesecake pudding and chocolate chips, and chocolate pudding and white chocolate chips.  This turns out perfect every time and people always ask for the recipe.  Thank you!!

I found this receipe almost 2 years ago, I think, and I have not gotten the chance to review this recipe yet. 

These cookies are very good. They always turn out very moist and soft, perfect for my husband. He loves them. It is the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I use. Thank you very much for this recipe. :D

I was a little worried about making these cookies after reading some of the reviews and because my dough was a little dry.  After making these, I have to say that these are probably the best cookies I have had in a long time.

The only thing I did different was use butter flavored crisco plus 2 T. water instead of butter or margarine.  I think next time I will increase the water by 1 T to hopefully make the dough less dry.  But all in all, these cookies were awesome!

Used Butter instead of Margarine. Everything else was exactly as written. OMG! New favorites. I had also baked a Black Magic Chocolate Cake (AR Recipe/birthday cake needed) and topped it with Pro Ganache from this site. Had extra Ganache and dipped some of the cookies 1/2 way into the Ganache. My men are in love!

These are good cookies.  I always have a hard time finding a great cookie and this one is good.  I just tried one from the 1st batch.  I used a chocolate/peanut butter chip mix.  Tastes good.  Easy to make.

This is the best Choc.Chip Cookie recipe I've ever made. Tey are moist and not overly sweet.  Everytime I make them I've had at least 2 more people ask for the recipe. Thank you Bonnie, I've tried about 50 over the years, and this is the best ever..

This is by far the best chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have tried from this site (even considering my alterations!!). We used DevilsFood flavoured pudding mix, and 50/50 chocolte and peanutbutter chips. We also, used ALL brown sugar and white as well as omitted the vanilla because we didn't have any of either on hand today. Absolutely delicious!! They are super easy too!! My 2 year old really enjoyed that she was able to help make these. :)

I could not get this to set up at all.  Tried on baking stone, cookie sheet and in muffin pans.  Too much effort for the same flavor.

I have memorized this recipe and used it at work for my self-instituted Cookie Day Tuesdays for years.  Yes, these are a cake-like cookie but they are, to me, the perfect cookie.  I have used different puddings and different add-ins as suggested and a current favorite is to use chocolate pudding, replace 1/4 cup of the flour with cocoa, and to add Andes Mint chips. I have the best results when I bake them up the night before and put them in layers (with parchment paper in between) in big gladware containers.  They are evenly soft and oh-so-tasty the next day.  Thanks, Amy!  Thanks to you my co-workers think I am a genius baker.

Not good. They were dry and lost the pudding flavor during baking. I followed the recipe and still had to add a little milk just to get them a little moist

My sister makes chocolate chip cookies every holiday and they are so good. I found out her secret ingredient is vanilla pudding. The first time I made them they were ok but my sister uses 2 boxes of pudding so I added another box. Ohhhhhh they are good! I took them to work and they were gobbled up within 5 minutes and were begging for me to make more!

Followed the recipe exactly aside from using a different flavored pudding mix: butterscotch. These were really yummy and I like that there is versatility of being to play with different flavors with pudding mixes... kind of fun actually :) They have a cake-like consistency which makes them very appetizing to look at. I brought them to work and my boss ate six back to back. This is my new go-to for chocolate chip cookies!

I have used this recipe over and over again, and EVERYONE always wants the recipe.  I have always loved soft, cake-like cookies(almost like Keebler Soft Batch cookies), so these cookies are perfect for me.  If you like more of a thin, crispy kind of cookie, then this recipe isn't for you, but so far, I have never met someone that does not like these cookies.

They didn't flatten out and stayed soft, which was great. Just had to add a little salt.

I've made this recipe three time since Xmas.  We love it.  The 2nd time I made it I used butterscotch chips and butterscotch pudding.  Yum!  Today I used vanilla pudding, white chocolate chips, plus the juice and zest from one lime.  Really tasty.  Thanks!
Note:  I also add 3/4 tsp. of salt to the recipe to enhance the flavor.

Honestly, I am disappointed.  I got all worked up based upon the rating (didn't read the reviews).  I thought I forgot an ingredient.  I even had my husband try one because it tasted bland to me.       He isn't hard to please - he liked it.  However, we did add some another egg, baking soda, coconut, and cinnamon.  MUCH BETTER.

This is the perfect choc. chip cookie recipe that I've been looking for. I've been using the same old recipe for years. You all know the one. The little hockey pucks that break into crumbs at one bite. These are moist and chocolaty. I made it with the chocolate pudding and the only change was the dash of salt I added. We are happy.

This is a very good recipe. I added more chocolate chips because my husband asked for lots.  The cookies are also very soft -- as DH likes. I used a french vanilla pudding mix.  I usually add some almond extract to chocolate chip cookies and this would have been better with it as the flavor of the dough seems to be missing a little somthing. I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe over the weekend to see if I would like it for the holidays.  Using some advice from other revies, i.e. chocolate pudding, tad more sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla and adding my personal favorite(pecans) these cookies are great. Soft and chewy for days,i left one out over night and it was still soft. good job amy.

These cookies are great.  I find they are even better when you use diet margarine.  They are much fluffier.

I love this recipe. It's soft and chewy like I wanted and the recipe can be played with in so many ways. I added 1/2 cup of oats and just a sprinkling of crushed nuts for texture. The family loved it. Next time I will try a different flavor of pudding. One of my new favorites.

I was looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe that actually called for margarine, because I hate to use pricey butter on something that's going to be eaten up so quickly.  I only had about half the required chocolate chips on hand, and I thought that was perfect amount.  Made it with vanilla pudding mix and the batter smelled so amazing.  The first batch was so-so because I took it out at 9 minutes as suggested.  They tasted a little raw.  Baked the rest for 10 minutes till they were nice and golden brown and they tasted MUCH better.  These were great cookies, especially with the added softness, but there was an artificial quality about them, probably owing to the pudding...I thought they tasted like store-bought sugar cookies with chocolate chips.  I've enjoyed other recipes more, but everyone loved these and I'd make them again.

This is the best recipe. It is quick, easy and you can change it to your taste. What more could you ask for? I have used white chocolate pudding and white chips. I like to make two batches, one the standard recipe and one "experiment." Next, I will use pistachio pudding and white chocolate chips and see how it will turn out. They turn out soft and keep really well too.

I liked the fact that these are soft cookies and they stay that way.  Mine spread out on the cookie sheet and were flat.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I also didn't have egg beaters or even a wisk, so maybe that was a problem.

These are my favorite cookie recipe.  I love the chocolate pudding with peanut butter chips, my boyfriend loves the vanilla pudding with dark chocolate chips, and my mom loves the white chocolate pudding with white and milk chocolate chips.  Tonight I'm trying cheescake pudding with caramel and chocolate chips!  Everyone loves the recipe!

These cookies taste like cake! Another reviewer put that the batter taste better than the cookie and I agree. Will never bake again and I rated it a 2 because maybe someone else will like cake cookies! The pudding mix ruins it!

Tasty, great texture, very easy to make, not too sweet.  I used chocolate instant pudding since I had it on hand, and it made a richer chocolate color than I assume the vanilla makes.  I also added a teaspoon of Cherry extract but could not taste the cherry flavor -was trying for a choc-cherry flavor. Want to make using lemon pudding with lemon zest.  Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper for sure.

I made these tonight with white chocolate chips and craisins. It made a little over 5 dozen ( used a melon baller instead of a tsp) and they are so good. Crispy edges, chewy insides sooo good! I am making them again tomorrow with semi sweet chips. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy!  These cookies are uncomplicated & satisfying.  I tried a variation with chocolate pudding mix & one cup white chocolate morsels/one cup chocolate chips.  Stayed nice & moist, cooked in 10min exactly.

I have made these cookies several times and used different flavor pudding each time and different flavor chips.  Each time they came out perfect.  Nice and easy for me and my two year old grandson to make.  He loves to help me bake.

This was an easy recipe to follow and the cookies are great.  Even better, four days later - the cookies are as soft as the first day!  I used the vanilla pudding mix and a combo of semi sweet chocolate and peanut butter chips.  Great!

These cookies are awesome, very moist and chewy.  Try using different kinds of chips and also use different pudding flavors.  Our favorite is chocolate pudding and mint chips.  Excellent!

A 5-star cookie recipe!  These were just perfect for us.  They were moist, but not too cake-like, and so easy to throw together.  I think I've just found my new favorite chocolate chip cookie!

Not very good I am affraid.  I love trying new cookie recipies and this one did not come out very well.  The batter was not sweet enough and the flavor of the cookie dough itself was very bland.

These cookies are fabulous! I don't care for soft cookies, as alot of times soft = raw dough taste in the middle of the cookies.  These are nice and chewy and stay that way.  They have a crisp bottom, but a nice chewy texture.  I don't need to search for chocolate chip recipes anymore because I have found the best!

These are absolutely EXCELLENT!!!  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is I set my oven at 350 degrees.  I knew (knowing my own oven) that the bottoms would burn before the cookie was done.  It took closer to 12 minutes but there were PERFECT!  If your gut is telling you that your oven is going to be too hot at the temp listed, just turn it down!  This would be an excellent recipe to mix and match different pudding flavors and candy flavors.  Thank you for this recipe, it is (from now on) my GO TO choc chip cookie recipe!!

When I made these cookies they came out more fluffy than a regular cookie. & much larger but I loved it that way. & so did the FAM!  & when I went to get the chocolate chips they were sold out so I got a bag of mini  milk chocolate Hershey squares & chopped them in little square chips. So they were larger too. & super gooey. Love this recipe! I posted my pic.

I instead  used wheat flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder,1/4 tsp salt as a variation. My family loved the cookies!  One thing I will try next time is more white sugar to take the flour taste out a bit more. I figure maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of more white sugar. Oh, the butter I put in the bowl hard and melt it for a minute on high heat with all the ingredients mixed in the same bowl. Just mix to the put of blended. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on 350 degrees in oven.

Finally I have found a great chocolate chip cookie recipe that doesn't go flat.  I used butter and milk chocolate chips, since that is all I had, and they were delicious--my last tray is in the oven, and  my husband is asking if that is all there is!!!  He loved them--and has had quite a few warm out of the oven!  I am sending this one to my sisters and daughter-in-law!

I made these with chocolate pudding AND semisweet chocol ate chips. Only a few changes, I subbed 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and only 1.5 cups chocolate chips. They came out great! My fiance and 4 year-old loved them.

I love these cookies!  I accidently put in a big box of pudding instead of a small and they were super thick and super chewy at the same time!!  I added a mix of white chocolate and milk chocolate cookies as well as walnuts...sooo good!

I doubled up on the sugar, and used white chocolate pudding mix.  I thought these turned out great, and the texture was perfect.  They are a bit spongy, much like a "chewy" commercial cookie, but not overly so.  I mistakenly added the chocolate chips too early, so I ended up turning the whole mixture a medium brown color, and blended the chocolate too much into the mix.  That was purely my fault, however.  I think the texture begs for some nuts, so I'll try walnuts or almonds next time.  Overall, a very good cookie.

I've been making these cookies for years.  Sometimes I switch it up by using cheesecake pudding mix or white chocolate. I love how cakey they are.

These are the best cookies I have ever had!! I made them once for my daughters 2nd birthday party and since then all of my friends and family ask when I am making them again. Everyone also expects them in their Christmas baskets that I do every year!!

I loved these cookies and so did my father, and he's one tough cookie to please. =) I used coconut pudding and real coconut shavings in mine.  These were so good and soft...soft cookies don't happen all the time.  Thank you!

I have been making these for years. I originally got the recipe off the back of a bag of chocolate chips. Butterscotch or Pistachio pudding mix work real well with chocolate chips.

I just finished making these cookies... they are beautiful!!!  And taste good too!  I used white chocolate pudding because it was on hand, and two kinds of chocolate chips.  Thanks for a great cookie recipe.  I'll for sure use this one again and again. Oh, I used butter flavored crisco with 6 teaspoons water in place of margarine, and 1 extra teaspoon real vanilla extract.  Thanks again these are GREAT!

This recipe was good.  The kids liked them.  We substituted unsalted butter for the margarine.  Wasn't crazy about the artificial flavor of the instant pudding, though I did like the way the pudding made the cookie chewy and soft.

This recipe was excellent!  I used butter, not margarine, just because that's all I had in the house.  I also used a banana pudding mix for the same reason - they baked up beautifully - picture perfect - and very tasty!

I make cookies for my husbands platoon about every other day. And I got a request to find a chocolate chip cookie recipe that was as awesome as the heath bit recipe I was using. I only used about half of the choc chips and I also made a batch with the choc covered heath bits instead of choc. They were great. I went back to the store today and bought cheesecake pudding white choc nuts. I am also going to try the Ande's mint choc chips.

I baked these cookies as a quit-smoking-for-30-days present for a co-worker.  He almost fainted when he bit into the first one and said that the cookies were worth the weeks of torment.  The recipe was simple but great(I don't do a lot of baking) and the cookies came out beautifully.  I did add an extra cup and a half of semisweet and peanut butter chips b/c I'm a sucker for lots of choc/pb.  The cookies came out soft, moist, and sooo good.  This recipe is going to keep me coming back to this website now!  Thanks!

I have made plenty of Chocolate Chip cookies, and this recipe by far is the BEST one I have ever had. I made them with Chocolate Pudding mix and chocolate chips. Next time I will put nuts in them, but as is they are fabulous. Highly recommend.

I liked this recipe a lot! The pudding mix is genius. Only tip I have is to not chill the dough before baking! My cookies ended up looking a bit like biscuits. My own fault though. Great mix!

This is our favorite cookie recipe and gets great feedback from our friends!  We usually make the chocolate chip with vanilla pudding version but recently used cheesecake pudding with a mix of blueberry flavored Craisins and white chocolate chips and those were also incredible!  We also used salted butter each time because we only have these on very special occasions!  Delicious!

I made one with lemon pudding and left out the chocolate chips and they were amazing. I had friends and daycare kids say they tasted like Casey's sugar cookies this way...just needed frosting.

I really liked these. A very pretty cookie. But my husband described them as "too flourery." Maybe it's because I asked him to guess what the different ingredient was. He couldn't pinpoint the pudding mix. I also used butter instead of margarine. I would make these again for myself but since I want him to be the one to eat them, I will probably look for a different recipe.

These are the best cookies I have ever made... I made some changes after doing some research on what changes affect how the cookies turn out. I mixed all the dry ingredients together and set it aside. Instead of 2 eggs, I added 4 egg yolks which I blended with the white sugar and vanilla in a 2nd bowl. I completely melted the butter and mixed it with the brown sugar in a separate bowl from the white sugar mix. I mixed the brown sugar/butter mix with the dry ingredients and then added the white sugar/egg mix next. I then addd all of the chocolate chips and scooped it out onto baking sheets on am and baked for 13 minutes. I immediately removed the cookies to cool

Fantastic!! Only changes i made were to melt the butter (my blender is broken so i'm mixing by hand) and baked for 10 minutes.  My husband and a couple of his coworkers said they were the best cookies ever! Thank you for sharing!

These cookies turn out amazing every time! I pop two trays into the oven at a time at 11 minutes and they come out perfect. I've done standard vanilla pudding and semi sweet chocolate chips, as well as chocolate pudding with peanut butter chips and chocolate pudding with mint chips. The guys at work rave about them, and they don't last more than a few days at home. I get around 32 cookies/batch using the recipe and a 2 tblsp cookie scoop.

This is an amazing recipe to make anytime! It does make a few dozen cookies if you use about a spoonful of dough.  I used half the chocolate chips and they turned out great.

I followed this recipe exactly and I think they turned out out really well. I was very pleased with the consistency and the shape of them. I live at high elevation at 7,000ft and always struggle dealing with the altitude when baking. I usually have to alter recipes a bit, but this one turned out perfect without altering anything. Very pleased and will make these again. It's a good "go to" quick cookie recipe.

When I make these cookies I add about 1/2 to 1 cup of broken up pretzels.  I put them in a ziplock bag and smash them with a rolling pin then add to the batter.  It is a great alternative to nuts because of allergies and you get the salty and sweet.

No chemical taste here! I did add 1/2 tsp salt as other suggested adding it. Also, used French Vanilla pudding as that is what I had. These are a very cake-like cookie and I will definitely be making again. They are addicting!!

I (sadly) didn't have any butter in the house so I looked up a choco chip cookie recipe that didn't use butter and found this recipe. I was very reluctant about making cookies with margarine, but the recipe called for it (even though it says butter in the directions), so I trusted it, and the reviews, and was severely let down. With that being said, everyone else liked it. It was a bit too cakey for me though, and since I take my baking pretty seriously (ok, I'm like OCD and meticulous when it comes to baking), for me to bake less than perfect, basic, chocolate chip cookies was a personal problem. If you're in a pinch with no butter, then I GUESS use this recipe, and definitely dress it up with interesting pudding flavors and/or different flavored chips but as is, I just cannot give it 5 stars (based solely on my obnoxiously perfectionist taste). At any rate, happy baking :)

I've been trying a lot of chocolate chip cookie recipes and I've never heard of adding pudding to one so I was excited to try it.  I used cheesecake pudding and was hesitant to put the whole thing in the batter but I did anyway.  The flavor was okay but it turned out soft and cake like texture and got sticky the next day after storing it.  If I do make this again I would less pudding but I'm wondering if it would change the taste.

Wow!  My eleven year old daughter made this batter by herself for the first time ever and she got rave reviews!!  They came out soft and chewy and were still like that the next day.  She can't wait to make another batch and try it with chocolate pudding.  YUMMY!

I made these cookies and my husband and his coworkers ate them all. I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla and they were so good. Thanks for a great recipe.

These were great!  I don't like hard crumby cookies, and these were just the right texture and were soft and chewy.  I will definately make these again!

My two kids, one of their friends, me and my husband tried these cookies and LOVED them! So soft, but not mushy. We did choc. pudding and choc. chips. I was afraid it would be overly chocolately, but it wasn't (is there even such a thing?!).

This is THE best chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have found.  Last time, I threw in some butterscotch chips which tasted amazing with the vanilla. Everyone that has tasted them just raves...definitely a 10 out of 10!

This is truly a great and easy recipe! I needed something to make for teacher appreciation day and these were perfect!
I added just a little more white sugar (I like them a little sweet) So if you don't like overly sweet, follow exactly. I also used self rising flour just because I had it, I used vanilla pudding and semi sweet chips - DELICIOUS. This is the very first cookie that I have made that has come out fluffy and not flat as a pancake. THANK YOU

These cookies are so good and fluffy!  When I make them, they usually are gone within a day or two.  Instead of white sugar, I use Splenda for baking to cut back a little on the sugar.  The only difference is they get fluffier; press them down a bit into the baking sheet for a less round appearance.  Overall, my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe!

These are the BEST chocolate chip cookies ever.  I thought this recipe would produce a cookie that was too soft, but it didn't.  The cookie had a crisp bottom, but was still soft and chewy just the way I like it.  Sometimes in cookies especially soft ones it seems as if you can almost taste the raw dough (YUCK!) But not in this one it's fabulous!!!!!!

The best Chocolate Chip Cookies ever!!!!!!! My family can't get enough of them. They are just great. I tried different puddings and chips and they all loved it! The last batch I made, I ate almost half of it myself, when they were still warm from the oven. They are that good!

I have tried these cookies in vanilla and chocolate and they were good, but then I had a idea to use banana pudding and choclate chips. Wow they were great. And a suprise to the people that were eating them to taste banana.
