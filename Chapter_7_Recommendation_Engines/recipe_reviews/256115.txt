I don't know what happened but this cake never rose. I followed the recipe as written and It was dense and tasteless.  Will not make again.

11.30.16  Instead of making a large bundt cake, I made 12 mini-bundt cakes and 12 cupcakes, baked for about 20 minutes .  I topped the mini-bundt cakes with Mario’s Coconut Lemon Curd (and then garnished with some coconut shreds) and used that as a filling for the cupcakes, as well (recipe on this site).  The undrained crushed pineapple made the cakes so moist, and with the addition of the coconut extract, this really does taste like pina colada.  So easy, so tasty, and nothing to change on this recipe.  It’s simply good!
