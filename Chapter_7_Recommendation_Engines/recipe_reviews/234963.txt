I made this as a breakfast dish and now think of it as a version of apple crisp.  I knew my family would love the topping, which they did.  
I followed the recipe pretty closely but was not a real stickler at following measurements.  I'm sure I used less sugar and butter than called for with the apples and squash.  
I probably had more topping than was called for when completed.  
It was enjoyed by all and I would certainly make again but for now that was the last of my squash until next season.  I could also see simply mixing cubed pieces of apple and squash together rather than pureeing the squash on top of the apple slices.

This casserole is delicious. I mostly followed the recipe but had to make a couple of changes according to what I had on hand. I used a variety of apples (Golden Delicious plus two other varieties that I do not remember the names for) and omitted the pecans. I believe that you could use any type of apples that are designated as good for cooking. The flavor of the squash and apples shines in this simple, but hearty dish.

Ok there were a few things that I did a little different. They were purely due to family preferences. 
I added an extra 2 cups of apples and doubled the topping. I also knew it wouldn't be enough spices for here. I usually make my own mix in the fall and put it in a shaker. So my spices were a cinnamon base (sigon cinnamon), nutmeg, allspice and a dash of ginger. I added some to the apples as they were cooking and to the Squash and the topping. I felt the red delicious apples were a little hard this year, I cooked them well but they were still a tad to crunchy for me, I made apple sauce this week with macintosh and they were awesome. I will make this again but I will probably use macintosh or Cortland apples. But the small amount of spices would never have gone over. My little tweaks made it go over really well here. The kids loved it and it's almost gone. I didn't even get a chance to get a picture, as soon as I called dinner they rushed it. I made this with Dutch apple sausage (its made here by one of the butchers at the farmers market) and organic Mac and cheese just in case the kids didn't like it. :/  Tonight they ate Squash lol. Tomorrow is  Butternut Squash harvest bread.

I loved it and so did the other adult who tried it.  The two kids (young adults) where not quite so enthusiastic.  I think they prejudged it because it had "squash" in it.

It was awesome and plan to add it to my Thanksgiving menu.  I made smaller portion due to amount of squash in freezer from my summer harvest!!!   Made it just like recipe.  Ok

Excellent dish! I've made this dish a few times now. Everyone loves it. I've played with the recipe every time. As long as you use baking apples it doesn't really matter which ones you use. However, if you want a touch more sweetness add some dates to the crumble! Also, this dish is excellent if you make it the night before. My family had it for breakfast with a fried egg on top of each piece. OMG it was wonderful!

I made this for a brunch and it was a huge hit. Everyone thought it was pumpkin, not squash. I increased the amounts to fill a 9x13 dish. I used Macintosh apples and they cooked nicely. Also added some pumpkin pie spices. I would definitely make it again!!

Great recipe!!  This recipe is also good with Red Kuri squash instead of butternut.
