I made this dessert for a large gathering where everyone brings an appetizer or dessert.  I opted for this recipe because it seemed quick & easy.  Boy was it!!  I followed the recipe, but instead of individual cups, I made it in a 9x13 pan.  Of course I needed to change the amounts, but followed all the other general directions.  I ended up using 2 small pound cakes cut into 1 inch squares, 3 packages of instant lemon pudding, 6 cups cold milk, and 4 cups blueberries.  (3 cups in it & 1 cup sprinkled on top of the whipped cream) I used the recipe for easy whipped cream from All Recipes also, but I doubled it.  It came out wonderful!!!  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely use this recipe again & as someone else said,  may switch up the pudding & fruit! (maybe French vanilla pudding & strawberries next time!)

I liked it more 24 hours after I made it. The pound cake had then softened up and blended with the pudding. The lemon pudding wasn't very lemony, so I think I'd use some lemon extract when mixing the pudding with the milk. I'd also use more blueberries. Wait to add the whipped cream right before serving. I liked that it was sort of old-fashioned, like dessert my great-grandma made.

I have to start by saying that I live in Australia and we used to be able to  purchase "Lemon Pudding" here,  but not anymore, so had to change this. I replace the pudding with using my homemade Lemon Curd (soft, runny, creamy consistency)  which gave this a real lemony tang. Made it in the morning after reading another reviewer said hers was better the day after. In doing this it did soften the cake enough to make it soft pleasurable eating and well balanced  with the sprinkling of blueberries on top savored with the cream. Every mouthful was absolutely YUMMY!  Recipe was a good base idea with what I had to use. I will definitely make again the same with my change as it's so easy and quick.

Quick, easy and yummy! I made 5 dessert cups, and they turned out really pretty. I ended up with left over pudding - as I just kind of eye-balled it to make sure the cake was topped with enough, but not too much. No biggy! Would be great with other berries and pudding flavors as well. Thanks for sharing!

Very simple recipe that presents well at any dinner party. In addition to the lemon juice I added lemon zest which heightened the flavor of the blueberries and the overall lemon pudding. I would also follow the direction on the putting recipe as opposed to simply milk in the instant putting mix, intended to be quite runny. Overall though good recipe.

I made this easy and tasty dessert through step three at least 3-4 hours ahead of time. It assembled quickly and was a perfect treat to end the meal.
