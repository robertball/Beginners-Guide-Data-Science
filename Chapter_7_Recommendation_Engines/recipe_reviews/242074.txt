This is exactly what I was looking for, a rhubarb-strawberry crisp and an oat topping with brown sugar! I appreciate that this uses a little less sugar than most rhubarb recipes too. I let the rhubarb sit like instructed with the sugar, except I used only a pinch of salt than the 1/2 tsp. called for. And I left out the tapioca as I was using flour instead. I like to see how much liquid comes out of the rhubarb before I add a thickener, in this case I used 3 Tablespoons of flour as there was quite a lot of liquid. I used a 7x11" glass casserole dish, the amount of topping was spot on for this!! A 9-10" square or round cake pan would work too. Any bigger and you'll want to make more topping. I also used semi-cold butter and worked the topping with my hands instead of melting the butter. This was not too sweet, the rhubarb still retains it's tartness. I used one cup of fresh strawberries which adds just a little natural sweetness. If you want more of a strawberry taste you might want to up it to two cups of slice strawberries, but I like it the way it is! This is a good basic recipe and one can add their own flavourings or spice to suit their taste. I used a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg in the oat topping and a splash of vanilla in the fruit. This is perfect! Thanks for your recipe Karen!

We used our fresh Rhubarb and last years fresh frozen strawberries.  We doubled the recipe and put it in a large rectangular cake pan.  It was delicious!  We added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the topping and loved that, too.  It is definitely worth making again!

This was my first experience making anything with rhubarb, and this recipe is delicious! I made a few modifications: added 2-3 TBSP orange juice to the rhubarb and sugar mixture, used 8oz fresh sliced strawberries and about 1/2 cup dried cranberries. I also added cinnamon & pecans to the topping mixture. Yummy!

This was a hit at our house. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen, and had to add to the amount of crisp. Next time I would cut back on the sugar as it was a little too sweet.  Thanks
