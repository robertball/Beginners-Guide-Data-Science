O.K. here is my version to liven things up just a little. I also add 1 TBS. chopped parsley, 1 TBS fresh basil or 1 tsp. dried basil, and either fresh chopped tomato, canned drained diced tomato or chopped sun-dried tomatoes along with a little white wine. I let it simmer on low until the chicken is very, very tender. I serve it sometimes with rice, pasta, or mashed potatoes. I also sometimes add sliced zucchini.

This dish was really tasty and easy to prepare. I did make a few changes. I substituted olive oil for veg. oil. I also added onion, garlic, fresh basil, red and greed bell peppers, peas, and carrots. The sauce was very tasty. It was great served over white rice.

you can do so much with this recipe, i loved it! i minced 2 cloves of garlic to brown the chicken in (i seasoned the chicken with sea salt and pepper and a little onion powder, i didn't have any fresh onions). when i added the soup and the water i added cut up red potatoes and carrots that i had mixed with some fresh parsley. i covered it all and let it simmer on low for about 20 minutes, then added half a can of peas. so good on a cold night!

well, this was terrific, and just what i needed---a simple, fast recipe with few ingredients...i used enormous chicken breasts, so the cooking time was longer, and i added an onion, some garlic, and some mushrooms...my husband loved it, and it doesn't break the bank or the calorie count!

This is one of those super simple, easy-peasy "meat and potato" classics -- and a great way for me to empty my vegetable drawer. Add onions, broccoli, red peppers, mushrooms, celery, zucchini -- whatever you have on hand -- and this dish takes on a flourish.

I was surprised with how delicious this turned out! I'm not usually a big fan of canned mushroom soup. But using the advice of other reviewers to spice things up, this turned out to be a spectacular weekday dish.
I cooked my chicken fully in a small amount of water (instead of oil). I then tossed my cooked chicken breasts in the fridge overnight with 2 cloves of chopped garlic tossed on top (not mixed in).
The next afternoon, the rest of the recipe was cake. I tossed the garlic from on top of the chicken, 1/4 of a chopped onion, 1 tsp of basil, and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes into a pan with a 1/4 tsp of margarine and sauteed it all. I then added the mushroom soup and water, mixed it up and followed the rest of the recipe as written. After adding the chicken, I mixed in 1 tbsp of freshly chopped parsley to the sauce and let it simmer for 6 minutes.

I served it over rice (made in the 6 minutes that the sauce simmered). When cooking the dish I thought there was way too much sauce, but it turned out to be the perfect amount with rice.

S.O. loved it. Definitely a keeper.

Was looking for a quick recipe that used chicken and mushroom soup as a base and this really did the trick!  I halved the recipe and added 1/2 red onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp dried parsley, 2 small red potatoes, 1/2 cup carrots, 1/2 cup zucchini, 1/2 tomato, and 1/2 red pepper.  The result was delicious!  I would give the recipe more stars, but to be fair, like most others who reviewed the recipe, I deviated quite a bit.

I was not a fan of this one. I read the reviews that said it was bland, and decided to pre-season my chicken with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper. It STILL came out bland, so I can't imagine the flavor without these seasonings! All I had in the pantry was Healthy Request cream of mushroom, so that may have contributed to the lack of flavor. If I ever make this again, I'll definitely use the regular cream of mushroom soup. I'd also suggest using chicken broth instead of the 1/2 cup of water to add more flavor.  It was really easy though, I just think this "2-step chicken" needs a few more steps.

This was great with just a little tweaking.  I added some salt, pepper, garlic salt, rosemary, and basil to the chicken before cooking.  The mixture of these spices was wonderful for this recipe.  After only 5 min cooking in the sauce the chicken was perfectly tender.  The sauce goes perfect over rice.

We Loved this! I did season the chicken breast with garlic salt and pepper, then after I added the cream of chicken I added dried minced onion and fresh mushrooms and had to cover and simmer for about 15 - 20 minutes (considering my chicken breast were very thick). Very good, esp since I didn't have to go to the store and had all these ingredients!!

Great Quick and East recipe.  I did some modifications.  I added some peppers, broccoli and mushrooms to the coups and cooked until chicken was really tender.  I also threw in some parsley and basil (1tsp of each).  
I served over egg noddles for a quick easy dinner.

Delicious! I added onions and garlic when cooking the chicken. Did the rest by the recipe. The food was inhaled by all.

I started this earlier than it said because I always have problems with getting the meat to cook in time. It cooked perfectly in the time listed. I had to cook it longer so that it would be hot when my hubby got home and it was still really good. The only thing I did differently was seasoning the chicken in the skillet. So good and super easy. Thanks!

I like this recipe because it is super easy, quick and tasty!  I took the advice of "go away"'s review and I added dried basil, chopped fresh tomatoes, and white wine.  I also simmered for longer than the recipe calls for so the chicken comes out very tender.  I think those additions really add some flavor to the recipe.  Thanks, Campbell's Kitchen and thanks "go away"  :)

Awesome. I used 1 can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom.  After reading others tips I added approx 1 tsp basil, 3 cloves chopped garlic, and sprinkled the chicken with garlic salt, onion powder, paprika and cayenne.  Super yummy!

Super easy and quick. I followed other reviews and added 2 garlic cloves, diced tomatoes, onion, sun dried tomatoes, and even chick peas (was basically cleaning out my fridge). My husband is a healthy eater and usually doesn't like to eat the stuff I made but this was all healthy (used the 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup) and he really, really enjoyed it. Next time I'm going to try using cream of chicken soup since I have that in my pantry.

I gave 3 stars because I feel that tis recipe makes a good base.  It is too bland on its own and I dressed it up with sauteed onion, garlic, peppers, and peas.  Next time I will definitely add some more flavours to punch it up some.

Made the mistake of making this in the crock pot and adding tomatoes. It was gross, but at least the chicken was tender.

So easy to make! This dish was tasty with some of the recommended additions such as green peppers, onions and fresh tomatoes (I added them to the top after it was all cooked). I served it over mashed potatoes and it was great!

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I used garlic salt, onion powder and Mrs. Dash zesty table blend to season the chicken. I also used milk instead of water, but also added approx 2 tbs of water. I used the sauce as a gravy for mashed potatoes. My Family LOVED it! Will definitely make again!

Yummy, but I made the following modification.  I used chicken thighs.  I browned them on both sides, then I cooked frozen chopped onion and frozen California-style vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli and carrrots) in the leftover oil and juices from the chicken for about 5 minutues.  Then I added the soup and about 1/2 can of water, 1 t. of garlic powder, and some cracked black pepper.  I brought that to a boil, then simmered it for about 5 minutes.  Delish!!!

Super yum! Super easy! My twist: I added salt and pepper to the chicken. Before I put the chicken into the pan I roasted some minced garlic. To the mushroom soup I added garlic roasted balsamic vinaigrette, paprika, pepper, dried parsley and basil. I'll be making this again for sure. :)

Followed the advice of "go away" but used the diced Italian tomatoes, added cayenne, onion powder, and black pepper. Served with salad and mash potatoes. This one is a keeper. Next time we will try it with bow tie pasta.

This is a very good, easy to prepare meal.  I made it with Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic and served it over jasmine rice.

I actually really liked this recipe and so did my family.  I've been having the worst time trying to get my two year old to eat chicken (or meat in general) and this did the trick!  She scarfed it down.  The only change I made was adding a little Garlic and Herb seasoning as it was browning in the skillet.

My picky husband loves it!  I used the can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil, and added a little dried basil.  Simmered on low for 45 min.

So easy and delicious! I also added some minced garlic and chopped onions in with the chicken for extra flavor.

Great base recipe and so simple.  Use your imagination to spice it up!  I added cherry tomatoes quartered and a can of sliced mushrooms and 2 tablespoons of salsa.  It was yummy!

It's very easy and good, but bland as is. I did season it quite a bit for my families tastes

Very easy recipe that easily adjusts to what you have on hand. I used chicken broth instead of water, added onions and served over pasta with veggies on the side. Worked great!

Quick and easy, a little bland.  I would add some pepper.
