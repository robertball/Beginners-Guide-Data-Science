These are freaking AMAZING! I made some changes, but do it this way and you won't regret it! I used cream of chicken soup instead of Cream of Celery, that made it taste better I think. Then when mixing the eggs with the condensed soup, add a pinch of pepper and 1 t. of curry powder and 1/2 c. of cheddar cheese, mix till smooth. Leave off the curry if you don't like curry, but trust me it makes the eggs. Heat on medium till thick but still creamy, these will seem really creamy compared to normal scrambled eggs, their suppose to look that way, their done. I added probably another 1/4c. of cheese on top and mixed it in when it was done  to get the cheesy effect. These are the best scrambled eggs I've ever made, i will not make them any other way from now on!

I like these.  However, I most often make them with a can of cream of potato soup and a bit of milk.  Sometimes I cook them in the microwave oven on medium and scrape the sides of the bowl every few minutes while I'm cooking on the stovetop.  These are great for breakfast burritos by adding a can of drained rotel and cooked sausage then topped with cheese.

I used Cream of Mushroom soup, since that's what I had on hand, and they turned out great! I scaled it down to 6 eggs and 3/4 of a can of soup, which was perfect for my family of three. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of adding some shredded cheese to the egg mixture, and I also added about 1/4 cup of bacon pieces (I keep them in the fridge just for recipes like this). I sprinkled some cheese over the top as they finished cooking. I served with some fried potatoes with onions and peppers and toast for a quick and easy weeknight dinner. Who doesn't love savory breakfast for dinner??!!

I used this as a base for a quiche. I added some asparagus, onions, and cherry tomato to the mixture and topped it with some shredded cheddar cheese...perfection!

Hee, I totally forgot to add a can of evaporated milk and added only like what, a tablespoon (because I always add milk to my eggs) of it? Result came out in a very salty/pepperyish dish and it wasn't as nice. I may have cooked it too little because it was very watery and since I'm so used to eating Campbell as a soup, it was weird tasting it in my eggs. A nice concept, but didn't turn out well for me. I may/may not make this in the future.

These were good.  Husband approved.  I didn't make any changes to this recipe.  Possible additions would be cheese, bacon, sausage, scallions, mushrooms or salsa.

This wasn't bad. A little watery. I made for company and one guest really liked it. The rest thought it was ok.

Delicious!!!! I am very pleased with this recipe. I used cream of mushroom soup, but I guess cream if anything soup would work very well. When I make this, I use only the soup and the eggs, still amazing without the other ingredients.

I did not care for this! Waste of eggs in my opinion.
