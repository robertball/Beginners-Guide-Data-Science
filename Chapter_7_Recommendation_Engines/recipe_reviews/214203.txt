This is so delicious - my family complained that I didn't make a larger batch.  Of course, Freddy3, it's always wise to be cautious with salt (=sodium), so I used low sodium beef stock and left the seasoned salt out altogether.  We needed no extra salt, but everybody is different! I also doubled the beans because we love them!

Yummy!! Didn’t use season salt, didn’t have room in the pot for zucchini, used fresh diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and water instead of paste, and cooked the noodles directly in the soup.

Very good.  Use beef stock instead of water.  I didn’t use seasoning salt because I did not have any.  I also only added 2 bouillon cubs cut down on salt. Everyone loved it.

My husband and I LOVE this soup!!!  To make it easier, I use a bag of coleslaw mix instead of the cabbage and carrots.  I also leave out the noodles because we are watching our carbs -- it's plenty hearty without them!
