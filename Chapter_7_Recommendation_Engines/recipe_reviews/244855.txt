Vegetable Pizza Frittata Haiku: "DOES taste like pizza, I made a few small changes, such as just six eggs." I didn't have a 10" oven-proof skillet, so I just mixed everything as directed and poured in a lightly-greased 10" pyrex pie plate, baking at 350 for 25 min. b4 topping w/ the tomatoes and olives, then baking for a remaining 10 min. until a knife inserted in the center came out clean. Otherwise, all the "guts" and their ratio were the same. My husband loved it and gave it an enthusiastic 5 stars, eating his mashed b/t bagel thins. I liked it alot (leftovers even better the next day), but thought the herbs were just a touch strong.
