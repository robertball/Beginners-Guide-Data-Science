It was yummy following the recipe but I did end up modifying it. I added one can of chicken broth and some garlic salt. I also added more broccoli and a little more cheese to balance it. Family loved it!

I started by using 1/2 stick butter dicing 2 small onions & a tablespoon of minced garlic and sauteed that for about five minutes. Cut up fresh broccoli and added that - cooked another five to ten minutes. Put a whole block of Velveeta a can of Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken soup and four cups of milk. Added seasoning to taste. Super good!!!

So thick and creamy! Followed it to the T and my bf says he could eat it everyday. I personally would have to lighten it up a little and so tmw I will add a can of chx broth to reheat. Added garlic in w the onions. It's a great base so you can customize it maybe add some other veggies or potatoes. Went from 4 to 5 stars because of that it is a thick tasty basic soup

I know I shouldn't give 5 stars if I changed it but this was awesome! Instead of butter I cooked 4 slices bacon in my soup pot until crunchy. I removed the bacon to drain grease & crumbled bacon for a garnish. I reserved 2 tbls bacon grease & used that to cook the onions added the flour & cooked till flour was brown then used skim milk. I cooked cauliflower in a 1 1/2 cups lo sodium chicken stock till tender & added that (stock & all) to my milk/onion broth. Pureed & served w/the crumbled bacon YUM!

This recipe is brilliant! It's one of my go-to recipes on wintery days. Sometimes I double the amount of broccoli. Other times I add an equal amount of cauliflower. Either way I add a generous helping of sliced carrots for a heartier result.

As far as a soup using only one kind of cheese and that being Velveeta it was pretty good. The recipe was super easy to make. I thought is was a little bland so I added additional pepper and salt.

I'm not really a fan of Brockley but the soup is amazing! I used a whole pound of Val Vita instead of a half a pound. Definitely made it cheesier and richer. I also boiled the Brockley a bit just to make it softer. Can't stand crunchy broccoli. Fantastic and easy recipe.

This was easy and tasty. I used a box of Wisconsin cheddar cheese soup instead of Velveeta. I also used fresh broccoli which I microwaved for about 2 minutes or so before adding it to the soup. Instead of milk I used chicken broth because I knew I would be adding the cheddar cheese soup and wouldn't need the additional milk.

This is an excellent soup that literally came together in minutes! I halved the recipe and used a bunch of fresh broccoli that was on the way out microwaving the flowerettes in a very small amount of water for 3 min. I had some Velveeta slices on hand so I broke 4 slices into pieces and added that along with a little Colby Jack cheese too. Lastly I added garlic and onion powder which always makes things better! UPDATE 11/13/19: This time I replaced about 1 cup of the milk with chicken broth and just used Velveeta. I also added one shredded carrot with the onion. Still did the same microwaving the broccoli for a short amount of time. Comforting on a very cold day.

It was very good but it did need something. So added sea salt 1/2 can of chicken broth and shredded carrots. I would add more broccoli too.

I used your base recipe and kind of tweaked it a little. I always make a rue first. Which is the butter flour and milk added in a pan and blended well. I also added a 1/4 tsp of white pepper 1/2 tsp is salt 1/2 tsp black pepper 2 tsp of white cooking wine and 1 cup of shredded Mexican blend cheese. I steamed the broccoli while making the soup base so it would be tender right away. It turned out really good. Thanks for you base recipe.

Came out way better than I expected. I did add a cup of chicken broth hoping to thin it up a bit. It was still nice and creamy. Ate it with chunks of bread and jalepino poppers. I plan on making it again but doubling up on the serving size because there was only enough for four people to each have one bowl.

This is a stick to your ribs kind of soup!  It was very good. I did follow the suggestions of others.   I adjusted the recipe to serve 8 instead of 6 and glad I did. There's only my husband and myself and as far as leftovers, there was one bowl of soup left. I used 12 ounces of broccoli and could easily had a little more. Used 1 block of Velveeta and 1/2 can of chicken broth. I think the broth is necessary otherwise it would be way to thick.  Going to try it with cauliflower next time!

Stuck to the recipe and found it to taste way too artificial all we tasted was velveeta. In my opinion broccoli cheese soup is not supposed to taste like a processed cheese product. Definitely not a favorite.

Made this tonight and the only change I made was to add a little flour to thicken. It turned out great and will be made again. Thanks for the recipe.
