I use Siete brand  tortillas.  Eliminates having to make the tortillas. (II find it in Phoenix and in Portland, OR so may be in several states )...made with almond and coconut flour. Make the rest of recipe the same ingredients, although I put on some salsa and a little avocado. Makes a filling breakfast and I love it.. I  heat the tortillas a little in the pan, and then the scrambled eggs (I use two tortillas and two scrambled eggs).

I am currently trying to make this. Right now it is nowhere near a dough. I am thinking some water should be added but it is not on the ingredients list. I will have to search other recipes so this doesnt go to waste.
