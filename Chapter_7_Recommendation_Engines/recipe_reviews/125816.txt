SO rich and cheesy!  I used a cup of heavy cream and a cup of 1% milk, and added a couple of small pats of butter to the mix before I baked it and it came out perfectly.  We devoured this with some steak tips and were stuffed!!!

This was verrrrrry rich! It tasted great and was a good complement to my pork chops. I had enough for two days after!  Not for those with small bellies. My only change was adding a bit more seasoning to the potato layers and sprinkling with basil and parsley to top!

I used a mixture of parmesan cheese and bread crumbs for the topping,along with pads of butter. Placed aluminum foil on dish. Took off for the final 10 minutes. Also added garlic to spices.

I made these to go with our Sunday dinner. They were so good! I was cooking a few other things, so I put these in the crockpot. I layered the potatoes, along with thinly sliced onion, and minced garlic, sea salt & pepper. I topped with heavy cream and parmesan cheese. Once the potatoes were done, I topped with cheddar cheese. I was going to take a picture, but they were gone before I could:) I will certainly be making again. Thanks for sharing!

I don't think you can go wrong with these ingredients.  But I am sorry I had to scale it back.  First off I did not need a full quart of cream, used under just 2 cups and about 1/2 cup chicken broth. Second, all I needed to do is layer this, add potatoes sprinkle with parm and butter, some cream and broth and dot with butter, sprinkle with cheddar and repeat layers, I had 3 layers.  This is so good I used a mandolin to get potatoes really thin.  I will be making this again and again, thanks.

Whoa...not for the faint of heart or watcher of calories ;)  But a really tasty side dish, actually hearty enough to be the main course!  My only stray from the recipe was seasoning the potatoes with salt and pepper (and a bit of garlic salt) before pouring the heavy cream and adding the parm cheese.  Thanks Robinana =)

I scaled this back to suit two people tonight using russet potatoes. I also used half-n- half milk with a pad of butter. Preparing this was easy as was baking it in the oven. I seasoned the potatoes with black pepper and Hawaiian sea salt; layered the potatoes with more fresh shredded parmesan and less sharp cheddar cheese in the gratin dish and then poured the cream over the top. I placed the butter on top and baked as recipe instructed for one hour. This turned out to be a nice rich sauce with cheesy potatoes! This is definitely not “diet” food but a great side dish for our ham tonight. I served this with, “Creamy Sweet Corn,” and “Glazed Ham,” also from this website. Very tasty.

This is so delicious and easy to make!  I did add a few pads of butter as suggested.  I also put a little garlic in with spices.  I added it as a regular goes with any meal side dish. Thanks!

This is the best scalloped potato recipe I have tried. I had to use up a bag of frozen sliced potatoes so I used it with this recipe. So good. I didn't have that much cream but it was still delish. I added more parm and less cheddar. The parmesan on top made a great little crust. Will make again and again.

I made this for an office potluck so increased the recipe by 50%. I did as others suggested - I added butter and garlic salt. Next time I will put a layer of cheddar cheese in the middle instead of just on top. Overall quite rich and tasty!

not sure if I should review since I didn't follow "exactly" I read all the reviews and did as some others suggested with the pats of butter and layering. I do have to say the flavors were great and I will make again b/c of the flavors. I didn't think it was as rich as others were saying. I didn't use the whole quart of heavy cream b/c my 3 qt dish would have overflown while baking. I think next time I will try to mix the cream and cheeses to make more of a sauce to use so the potatoes don't break apart after cooking and then stirring. I also added onion powder and garlic powder prior to cooking. Maybe I should have just followed the recipe as is and it would have turned out better? thanks for sharing though. always love trying new recipes

I halved the recipe for 2.  Added chopped white and green onion I had left from another dish as well as minced garlic salt and pepper on each layer of potatoes.  Added a thin layer of shredded cheese in layers of potatoes.  Mixed parmesan cheese and bread crumbs for topping.  After an hour some of the potatoes were a little under done, but I hand sliced and I'm sure was not consistant on thickness of potatoes.  Next time I'd add a little more cheddar cheese and pepper in layers of potatoes instead of on top.  Enjoyed.

Delicious with some modifications. I was concerned with the enormous fat/calorie content, so opted to use fat free half and half and cut down the quantity considerably (about 2 cups) Instead, I heated the half and half with a little butter and then added the cheddar cheese to make a sauce. Slowly cooked until thick. I made layers (potatoes, parm, repeat) and then poured the thickened sauce over. Topped with bread crumbs. Cooked at 375 for about an hour - topped with tinfoil for the first 40 min and removed for the remaining time to get the top layer a little more crunchy. Turned out pretty well!

This dish is absolutely amazing! It's quick and easy and great for family gatherings or just feeding a hungry bunch. The best thing is that you don't have to measure anything and you can use whatever cheeses you've got on hand. Just layer it up, bake, and serve. I've doubled the potatoes and cheese and cut the cream in half before and it still works! Thanks so much.

These were a disaster for me. I used a 3 qt dish & it was full. After 3 hrs & 10 min the potatoes were still on the crunchy side. I then microwaved them for 15 min(& they boiled all over the microwave) & they were still not completly done. They ended up being a giant curdly uncooked mess. If you could get past the cottage cheese texture, the flavor wasn't bad, however.

This is obviously NOT an everyday side dish...BUT our favorite 'every now and then' potato. I use garlic salt instead of sea salt, for a little extra flavor. And also add sharp cheddar cheese in my layers...and it turns out perfect!

I have gotten nothing but RAVE reviews from this recipe...worth trying!!!

These need help! I foresaw them not having a super-powerful punch of flavor, so I minced garlic and onion and sprinkled it between potato layers.  I also added Parmesan and cheddar and S&P between the layers as well.  When I pulled the potatoes from the oven, the heavy cream looked a little curdled.  Even with adjustments, I wasn't  impressed.  These were definitely rich, but flavor was lacking.  Sorry, I wanted to love them but didn't.

I was unsure from the start but it got some good reviews so figured I'd give it a shot.  I knew that the potatoes wouldn't cook in the alloted time but still went forward as indicated from recipe.  They cooked an hour at 375 and an extra half our after travel to dinner and the potatoes were totally hard.  Cooked them for about another hour at about 375 but it was too late for dinner  I'll try the leftovers but I'll stick with my tried and true recipe next time (good thing is that I cooked those too and kept these as a side experiment!).  If I ever try again, I'll boil the potatoes first.

Not so wild about this. Taste was decent,  but the cream pretty much curdles (as it does in many recipes like this) so it's not a pretty dish  to serve.   I did add lots of fresh minced garlic and thinly sliced onions.  I think it would be horribly bland without it because it was still pretty bland.   Doubled the recipe and cooked 2 1/2 hours.  Potato lovers will still like this recipe.

These are a nice creamy comfort food but my family prefers the onion diced instead of the whole ring in the sauce.  Other than that it's a winner.  Thank you!

This is a good base recipe.  The cooking time was about an hour off for me.  I had to cook for 2 hours to get a good consistency and tender potatoes  Also it needs a little more seasoning.  I added some cajun seasoning, salt and pepper.  I added about a teaspoon of minced garlic and an onion.  After it was done, I shredded sharp cheese and fresh Parmesean.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe and have made a version of it with ham for years. For some reason it never crossed my mind to put cheese in it. I will say that I read all the reviews and did put cheese in the middle because my men LOVE cheese in everything. One thing different is that I use seasoned salt in mine and layered it along with the potatoes and now cheese. For Stinalynn heavy whipping cream can be oily when baking. I have substituted milk when I was short on cream and I noticed the difference in the oily top. There was much less. So I added the seasoned salt and garlic powder along with extra cheese...mmmm good!

i followed the recipe perfectly; it turned out that the potatoes were swimming in whipping cream with shredded cheese and that was it. my boyfriend wouldnt eat it because it was still very soupy and it was like eating straight up whipping cream potatoe soup. it had nice flavor though.

not sure, think I may have done something wrong, but mine turned out very greasy/oily, maybe from the parm cheese? not sure, but gave it 3 stars, was still good, just had to wring it out first LOL

This is sooooo good! Not high up on the health factor but for a special dinner it is absolutely worth it.  I have my father-in-law over for dinner and we had this along with a herb roasted pork loin.  He raved how it tasted just like his grandmothers! Thank you so much for sharing!!

Sorry, This was just okay for us. It was bland; had to add a lot of seasoning. Also, it took 1 & 1/2 hours to cook.

Delicious, I made it for myself.  Once my family got tastes of it they devoured it.  I make it once a month now as a comfort food.

I made this tonight for dinner with my son and his new girlfriend. I did make a couple of changes to suit my taste. I used half &half instead of heavy cream, and I added salt, pepper to each layer instead of just the last layer. I also added a few thin slices of butter to each layer. I agree with another reviewer about the cook time. At 350/1 hour, the potatoes weren't quite done. But, I just put it in a larger casserole dish, and since I was baking chicken too, I upped the temp to 400 degrees F. Regardless of the fact that the rest of the meal was done before the potatoes, it was worth the extra wait. His girlfriend LOVED the meal, especially the potatoes. She even asked me for the recipe. I guess I made a good first impression.

I reduced the amount of cream and still found there was far too much liquid. The cream seperated and I found them quite flavourless. It didn't look very appealing when it came out  of the oven.

I salted and added pepper for personal taste.  Also, a few thin pats of butter was used on each layer except the top. The only objection from the family was why didn't I make more.
