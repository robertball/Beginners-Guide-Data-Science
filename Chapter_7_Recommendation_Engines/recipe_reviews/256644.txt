Delicious! I didn't use tater tots, I made my own home fries instead, and they were perfect with the white cheese sauce. I seasoned the pinto beans separately before adding to the bowl, and heated them up -- add some garlic salt, cumin and pepper. I made a sweet pulled pork today specifically for this dish, but I can see how this would be also perfect for leftovers if you were using pulled pork for another dish. Really super fun dish, and with guests, it's perfect to have the guests build their own.

These were good. I assembled them differently for a more visual appeal but left the ingredients the same. Try roasting your own red peppers. It's easy and makes a world of difference.

A very different combination, but the overall flavor with everything together was decent. I did canned chili bean instead of pinto, and also black beans. I used green peppers instead of red and thought they tasted just fine.
