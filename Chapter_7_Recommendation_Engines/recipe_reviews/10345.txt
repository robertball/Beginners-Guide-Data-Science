This review is only for the Lemon Curd. I used a separate recipe for the shell. I will try this shell recipe in the future though. 
The Lemon Curd is absolutly fabulous. The flavor is just perfect. I did use fresh squeezed lemon juice. And after the 15 minutes cooking time, my filling was still just as soupy as when I started. So I increased the heat and brought it to a quick boil and then removed from heat. It thickend right up. I would have liked it to be a little firmer, so maybe I will increase the boil time when I make again. I live at high altitude so maybe that is why it didn't thicken right.
Will definately be used again and again. We love lemon!

Very yummy!  I did not have a mini muffin tin, so we used a regular muffin tin. They were more like tarts.  Curd was delicious.  Will make again.

These were easy to make, but time consuming.  I made them in mini muffin tins, so they were a perfect accent on a cookie tray.  I did not put the slivered almonds on top, but sprinkled powdered sugar, as I do on lemon bars.  That was the perfect sweet tough to the tart lemon.

I made these for my bridesmaid's tea.  They went over really well!  I made the filling the night before and then baked the shells that morning.  The recipe was really easy to follow but I found out to use a "mini muffin" tin for better results, since I didn't have the "proper" pan.  The filling is excellent, although I didn't care for the taste of the shell too much.

It's hard to really rate this recipe because the only part that I used was the crust part.  After reading so many mixed reviews on the lemon curd part of the recipe, I chose to use the Microwave Lemon Curd recipe from this site.  Then I also topped these with a meringue to make them like mini lemon meringue pies.  The crust worked wonderfully and was the perfect amount for 24 tassies.  After baking, I used a teaspoon to re-indent the cups and they were ready for the filling. Everyone at the party really enjoyed these and they were gone quickly.

Love this recipe, easy to make and decided to double the dough.  I have a big family, the first batch was just too small.

I had fun making these with my sister and husband.  They were surprisingly easy and soooo tasty.  We doubled the lemon zest to 1 tsp, but otherwise, we followed the recipe exactly.  Our filling thickened without any problems after we increased the stove heat from "2" to "4."  However, we didn't have enough shell, so we re-rolled all the dough to be paper thin and still ended up with 17 tassies instead of 24.  As a result, we had lots of extra filling!  We put the rest into a small pie crust.  This recipe still gets 5 stars because it was so yummy!

Very good recipe.  A nice light dessert for spring.  I topped each with a tsp. of Cool Whip and toasted almonds for a nicer presentation.

These came out perfectly and were devoured by my guests. The texture of the shells and mild flavor were perfect complements to the tart and smooth lemon curd.

I gave this three stars because I followed the recipe exactly and the filling would not thicken up no matter what I tried. I was so desperate at one point that I added some corn starch with a little water and they still wouldnt get thick. As far as flavor, they are good but too runny for me.

This recipe was such a disappointment.  I was craving something like this, but alas...it flopped.  The curd never thickened...even after filling the tart shells and chilling it.  Nice flavor, but sad turnout altogether.

I might have not rolled the dough enough but I could barely get 2 dozen tarts when I used smaller cutters than specified in the directions.  Next time I would double the tart dough recipe and absolutely use the 3-inch cutter as the tart shrinks quite a bit after baking.  Other than that, these are awesome.  Just enough lemon to sweetness flavour!!

They were delicious, the only change I made was with how I cooked the curd. I slowly brought it up to a medium high heat, whisking it until it thickened up. So if your curd is runny then you need to turn up the heat.
