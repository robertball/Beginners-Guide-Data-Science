This is a great pumpkin bread recipe.  I used two whole eggs and the other two I only used the egg whites and it still turned out great.  Next time I will reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup to make it even healthier :-)

I was very happy to find a healthy recipe and still have the bread be very moist and tasty! This recipe is also very versatile for substitutions. I changed a few things just for my personal diet. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used two egg whites in place of two of the eggs. I eliminated totally one cup of the sugar and replaced one with brown sugar (i.e. 1 cup white, 1 cup brown) and the recipe was still sweet enough for me. I also, baked it in a bundt pan  for 55 minutes. After it cooled I inverted it onto a decorative plate and sifted a small amount of confectioner's sugar over the top, it was a huge hit and guest couldn't believe how low fat it was and still tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!

We loved it!  I used cinnamon applesauce instead of plain applesauce.  To keep the bread from drying out, just seal it in a zip lock bag along with a slice of bread.  The pumpkin bread will absorb the moisture from the bread slice.  Just be sure to change out the slice daily.  Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  I shared with it with everyone in the family.  I used egg whites instead of whole eggs and still came out incredible.

I usually hate anything made with pumpkin, but this was so good! It was also the first time I used applesauce as a butter substitute. I'd reduce the baking time to around 50 mins though; it was a little too crispy for me after an hour of baking.

I can't believe how good and moist this is.  Made it with 2 eggs & 2 egg whites, homemade applesauce, and pecans instead of walnuts.  Since it is a quick bread though, I always beat wet ingredients together, add to dry, and mix just until dry ingredients are moist (instead of using a mixer).  This bread tastes great toasted, too.

A very moist and nice quick bread, especially considering it's much lower in fat than most recipes.  I did make a few modifications:  1) I toasted the nuts first to enhance the flavor.  2) Since my cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice was old, I added a little extra of each.  3) I combined all the dry ingredients in one bowl and formed a well in the middle.  In another bowl, I mixed the sugar, applesauce, eggs, pumpkin, and water.  Then I poured the wet ingredients in the well of the first bowl and stirred just until the mixture is combined.  Overmixing will create tough bread.  4)Instead of making 3 medium loaves, I made 8 mini loaves and baked them for about 32 minutes.  Next time, I will use unsweetened applesauce because the batch I just made was quite sweet.  All in all, this is a very good recipe which I will definitely use again.

This came out delicious!  To make it even healthier, I used 2.5 cups of white flour and 1 cup of of whole wheat flour, and only used 2 cups of sugar.  Next time I'll try using 2 egg / 2 egg whites (instead of 4 eggs).

Pretty much followed exact recipe (used 2 whole eggs & 3 egg whites instead of 4 whole eggs.)  Very yummy!  My son and I loved it, will definitely make this again.

This is a good way to use up leftover pumpkin puree at Halloween time.  The recipe says that the nuts are optional but this bread definately needs them in there for the crunch factor.

Very good recipe.  I used raw sugar instead of the white sugar, I also used homemade pumpkin puree.  I used about 1/4 of wheat and the rest of the white flour.  I used egg whites instead of the full egg too.  I like trying to make things a little more on the healthy side so these are just little moderations I do.  My family never knew the difference so I succeeded.

I made this recipe even healthier by using Splenda and Egg Beaters. The taste is the same! I brought the recipe to 109 kcal/slice, and 1.8g fat/ slice and 19 Carbs/slice.

I topped with small pats of butter and sprinkled with brown sugar and diced walnuts.  Gave it a nice crust.

Fantastic recipe. I baked it just as the recipe called for it to be and it was just delicious and so moist. I did mine in two loaf pans instead of three. Half of a loaf was devoured by my kids right out of the oven so I doubt we will have a problem polishing off the rest before it dries out.

Great recipe!  I made mini loaves with it and got 9-11 depending on how big I wanted them!  Only had to bake for 35-40 minutes for mini loaves.  Also, I made multiple batches, so I did the dry ingredients ahead of time in gallon ziplocs to save time and bowls  :)

Love this recipe!  As others have said, less sugar and egg whites instead of eggs don't change the taste at all, but it's also good just the way it is.  I usually serve it with a little cream cheese to spread and it's fantastic!

This bread has great flavor and moistness for using applesauce instead of oil.  I used two 9x5 pans instead of 3 smaller pans.  It's a keeper in our house for a lower fat treat!

Terrific-- the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that I used a few of the modifications.. but, it is TERRIFIC and super moist.  Made some smaller loaves and froze them.. got them out weeks later.. still YUMMY!

I made this, took it to work and received many compliments. I put it in a bundt pan, and it was beautiful. Next time when I make it I will not mix it up so much, though. I think if you do it somehow makes it more chewy or rubbery. Walnuts are a great addition...

Fantastic recipe. I used only two eggs, 1 cup of sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 tbs of canola oil which gave this bread just the right amount of sweet,moist and fluff!  My husband brought it to work and got rave reviews.

Others had said this was bland, so I doubled the spices but I still thought it was pretty flavorless.  I did forget to add the nuts, so maybe it would have been better with those.  I made muffins instead of loaves, which decreased the bake time to about 20 minutes.

I love this recipe!  Quite possibly the best pumpkin bread I have ever had.  Ever.  First time i've ever tried substituting and using applesauce instead of oil.  It was so moist and full of flavor.  I opted not to include the nuts and made two loaves and added 1/2 cup mini choc chips to remaining batter and made a dozen muffins.  Unbelievably good!  Will definately make again.  And have to agree with another reviewer(sorry can't remember who) - these would be great to freeze, but they disappear too quickly :)

I really like how simple this recipe is. And I really like the fact that it calls for applesauce instead of vegetable oil - more healthy. Thanks for this great recipe!

this is a great way to enjoy pumpkin bread guiltlessly. i add 2tbsp light margarine to mine, and about tbsp chocolate chips which adds about 2 g fat to each piece but is worth it. i have not tried cutting out fat altogether but when i try it with banana bread, it just isnt good. a great tip is to increase spices, my cake was very gingery and so so yummy and moist!

Absolutely, positively FANTASTIC!!! I substituted 1 1/2 c. of the flour with whole wheat flour. Also, I just made it into 2 regular size loaves, as I didn't have the size pans the recipe mentioned. I couldn't believe how good this was. My family devoured nearly an entire loaf in one evening! Will definitely make this one again and again!

I really enjoyed this pumpkin bread!  To save a bit more in terms of calories and fat, and to add fiber (without sacrificing flavor or texture), I made the following substitutions / additions:

1/2 c Better 'n Eggs instead of 4 whole eggs (would probably go with 3/4 c next time)

Instead of 1 c applesauce:
3/4 c applesauce
2 T canola oil 
1 T liquid lecithin (a natural soy-based emulsifier)

For the 3 c white sugar, I used:
1/2 c granulated sugar
1/2 c brown sugar
1/4 c sucralose (would probably up the sucralose to 1/2 c next time, to get a little more sweetness)
Used half all-purpose and half whole wheat pastry flour:
1 3/4 c whole wheat pastry flour
1 3/4 c all-purpose flour

Spices:  Didn't have pumpkin pie spice so used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves

Also added:
1/4 tsp guar gum (a natural stabilizer)
2 tsp vanilla
1/4 c Silk unsweetened soy milk instead of the water

I baked it in a 9" X 13" pan for about 30 minutes to make brownie-style servings.  Without any nuts, these modifications give the following nutritional profile for 1 of 24 servings: 127.1 cal, 2.6 g protein, 2.0 g fat (only 0.18 saturated), and 24.8 g carbs (2.1 fiber, 5.9 sugars).

I was in the mood for pumpkin bread last week and chose this recipe over the countless others on this site.  I was not disappointed!  Very moist and a nice flavor.  The 3 cups of sugar seemed too much, so I experimented and just used 1.5 cups and added a pinch more of a few of the spices.  Yummy!

Super delicious, you will never miss the oil!  Every bit as good as the $7 loaf I buy at a local bakery, but made with better ingredients at home.  I made a half recipe and baked it in a regular size loaf pan for 52 minutes at 325 degrees in a convection oven, following the advice of another reviewer. It turned out perfectly. I used a heaping cup of fresh pumpkin puree and omitted the water. I used all white whole wheat flower, and you couldn't tell it was whole grain at all. I cut the sugar to 1 cup, and added 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger for the spices. My family loved it, even my husband who doesn't like pumpkin pie. It was even better after it had sit overnight. I'm making my second loaf today!

AWESOME!  I used brown sugar rather than white.  I left out the nuts and threw in a handful of chocolate chips.  Kids had no idea they were eating pumpkin bread.  I also sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top of the loaves before baking to give it a little sweet something on top.  Really moist bread.  Made 3 loaves and the kids ate them all in less than a week.  Would definitely make again.

The taste is fantastic. The bread is better the second day as far as flavor. The texture however is a little rubbery.  I will try 1/2 oil 1/2 applesauce next time so its not as rubbery. I also modified this recipe by adding 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar.  The brown sugar added a lot of depth to the flavor.   I would also like to skip the white sugar and try 1/2 honey 1/2 brown sugar next time.   Yummy...

i've tried this recipe several times now but have tweaked it a bit. took the advice of some of the reviewers and doubled the spices and used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. i cut down the sugar to a little less than 2 cups. decreased the 3 cups of flour to 2 2/3 and only used 1 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda because the recipe's version didn't make the bread as dense as i'd like it to be. otherwise, good recipe. just needed some personal adjustments

This was fantastic!  I used 1 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar, egg substitute for the eggs, and sugar-free apple cider in place of the water.  Came out incredibly moist and flavorful... yum!  And it's very healthy too! :-)

This was an excellent recipe. Be prepared - it makes a lot. I used 3 mini bread pans, 1 reg. bread pan, and still had enough batter left over to make 6 muffins!  All were great though.

What a great recipe! I made this for a picnic we're having, so I made it into muffins. I used real pumpkin, I substituted cloves, nutmeg, & a little allspice for the pumpkin pie seasoning as I didn't have any, and chocolate chips (so the kids would eat them) for the nuts! They came out great, I will be sure to make this again!

Sure was good! In fact I think the author must be messing something up. How on earth it ever gets the chance to dry out is beyond me! Gone in a flash..like 9 hours after it came out of the oven!

Delicious! I've made this twice in the last week, its very popular! The applesauce really helps keep it moist.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it's tasty, simple and lower in fat.  My girls, who usually don't like pumpkin bread, ate two slices each.

I really liked this recipe but, it took forever to get done.  I also, baked 2 loafs at one time???  Not sure, if I was supposed to do that?? Or, it could of been my horrible base housing oven!  HAAAA!  I didn't have any pumpkin spice so, I used extra cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. It came out very good!  Yummy! I will be using this is fall!  Thanks!

Very good pumpkin flavor.  As someone suggested I used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites in place of the 4 eggs.

Also I made 2 larger loaves and 12 mini muffins.  They turned out great!

I substituted splenda for half the sugar and used egg beaters instead of the eggs and it turned out great.  I bake with convection and lowered the temp to 325^ and baked it for about 51-52 minutes.  I used 2 regular loaf pans and I omitted the nuts and add 1/4c. chocolate chips to one loaf.  Turned out great!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  I substitude splenda for half of the sugar.  It was too sweet, and didn't have enough spices.  It also tasted very eggy to me.

This was very good!  When I would see a recipe with applesauce instead of butter or oil I just assumed that it would not be any good and never would make it.  This bread changed my thinking!  Very moist and flavorful!

Great!! After I started making this, I realized I didn't have applesauce, so I went ahead and used vegetable oil. I also didn't have any walnuts, but I can't wait to make this again and add nuts, and probably raisins, to it. After reading the other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups, and it is perfect!

This pumpkin bread has good pumpkin taste and the spices come though too. It's very moist as well. My one complaint: it's a little too sugary. All in all though, a good, healthier-than-usual quick bread.

This turned out very moist. The batter was thin and I only had one loaf pan so I made a dozen muffins too. The flavor is fantastic. I also drizzled a cream cheese icing over the top. The only criticism I have is that the substitution of applesauce for oil makes the top and sides a little sticky and crusty instead of a crumbly bread texture. Still a very good recipe. I would make it again.

This is one of the best pumpkin breads I have ever tasted.  It was easy to prepare and turned out so moist.  I like that you can change the amount that you want to make and did it for two loaves.  Next time I will make three because I don't think that they will last long in my house.  I didn't have nuts so I added Craisins instead and they worked out well.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I used to make something similar years ago, and lost the recipe.  I added about 3 oz. more pumpkin to make the bread more dense and moist, and raisins instead of walnuts.  I also used a simple vanilla/almond glaze to top it off.  There was none left after a few hours, my family loved it!  Thanks!

This was the best pumpkin bread I have ever had, and I love pumpkin bread!! The fact that it was lower in fat madeit that much better. I made it in one loaf pan and one 9x9 pan since I didn't have 3 loaf pans. It turned out great!!!

This was good. I was kinda dissapointed st first before it cooled, (thinking the inside was still dough...but it was just moist with a hard crust) I added more spices and pumpkin and added 1.5 tbs vanilla as well.
in one of the loaves I aslo added chocolate chips, it worked very well! and also making a powder sugar glaze mixed with pumpkin pie spice.
yum

Since I try to cut down  carbs in flour and sugar , I made some changes: I used 1 cup almond flour replacing 1 cup of flour and I used 1 cup Splenda  replacing 1 cup sugar.  I added 1/4 tsp ginger because we like that with pumpkin.  We (my husband and I ) loved the bread.  It was so moist and the walnuts I added fit in so well.  I will surely make it again.  It is a keeper.  Good job!

This bread came out absolutely delicious (if a little sweet)! The only change I made was to cut out a half cup of sugar, it was still a little on the sweet side for me, I think next time I'm going to cut out 3/4 of a cup of sugar and it should be perfect.

Yum!  Keep in mind this makes 3 small loaves and not one big one (like I'm used to making.)  Never used applesauce before--you can't even taste it and it makes it so moist.  Definitely a keeper!

I was really disappointed with this bread.  Too rubbery and bland. I doubled the cinnamon, but it was still very bland.

Made this a few days ago and it was a hit at work.  Everyone loved it.  I did make adjustments to the recipe and used 3 cups of brown sugar instead of granulated sugar, added in freshly grated nutmeg and some bittersweet ghiradelli chocolate chips.  I will definitely make it again!

I just found this recipe a few days ago and made it twice already!! I only made 1/2 the original servings though. It came out to one perfect sized loaf (twice). I made a few changes.. the amount of flour it called for.. 1 3/4 cups all purpose, I reduced that to 1 cup and added 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. Instead of pumpkin pie spice I used equal parts of clove and nutmeg. I reduced white sugar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/2. I added a good drizzle of pure maple syrup. I left out the nuts. This was such a good, flavorful, moist bread. It is a keeper & I'll be making it again & again.. very easy too!!!

This was extremely bland and too soft of a texture for "bread".  It took 85 minutes too bake through, but was still very soft and crumbly inside, almost like a layer cake that was baked in a loaf pan.  There was virtually no flavor.

This is my favorite pumpkin bread recipe.  I reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups.  I made a bunions glaze to go on top.  Next time I may add raisins or chocolate chips.

Quick and simple.  Made with my own mix of spices as I didn’t have pumpkin spice. Otherwise stayed  true to recipe. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing.  Will definitely make again.

Couldn't find 7.5 X 3.5 pans in any store so instead of three pans I  used four 5.5" X 3".     Filled to about 3/4.     Should have used at least 5 pans of that size because they rose several inches out of the pan.

The bread was tasteless and heavy.   Couldn't taste pumpkin or spice flavor.    I had even added additional spices based on the other reviews, but still bland.  Will not make again.     Wasted effort !

I just made this though added way more spice (approx 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cardamom, 1/2 tsp clove, 3/4 tsp nutmeg).  I also added 1 package of semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I used less sugar (2.5 cups, but could have used much less).  Baked these into cupcakes and they turned out amazing.  Ultra moist, I don't miss the oil at all!  Though no oil means they stick to the muffin papers...

After reading the reviews about it being bland, I doubled the spices, added about 2/3 cup of chopped pecans, and sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar prior to baking. It turned out flavorful and tasted awesome!

Really great pumpkin bread.  I used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugars and doubled spices.  OK, have to admit that I used only half the applesauce with melted butter & vege oil to make one cup total.  Butter just makes things taste better.  I like a bit of sour cream in quick breads so yes,  in went a dollop of that.  It baked up nicely in a large stone bowl and metal loaf pan.  Don't forget the chopped nuts whether you use walnuts or pecans cuz the crunch makes this bread a little extra special.  Almost forgot to add, mine was done in 35 min.  So always set timer early and keep checking.

Wonderful pumpkin flavor! I made very few adjustments, those being that I used 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of pureed banana (as I had no applesauce in my kitchen) and I was kind of doing whatever I wanted with the spices. I ended up using about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon of cloves. I ended up with two 7x3 loaves and one 5.5x2.5 loaf.

I'll definitely be making this recipe again this fall!

This recipe makes for a pretty decent base. I subbed more applesauce in to replace the eggs and lowered the sugar a little bit like some had suggested. The texture was nice, but I thought the taste was a little bland. Next time I'll try a different substitution and play around with the spices a bit more.

The only change I did was to reduce the water to barely 1/8 cup. I use homemade puree which tends to have a thinner consistancy. I could have omitted the water all together though. The bread was so moist, it was almost sticky but tasted great with walnuts in it.

This is the best Pumpkin bread I have ever had. My daughter made it and I was  astonished how high the bread had risen!  Moist tender and the best  flavor. This won first place with me.

This was a seriously moist loaf of bread. I loved it so much that I committed it to my favorite recipes book in my kitchen. Based on other reviews I stepped up the spices by using cinnamon applesauce and adding cloves, ginger and nutmeg as well as extra pumpkin pie spice. That was the only adjustment that I made though. Hope you enjoy as much as I did!

After the bread is baked, I will make the little holes through out the bread and on the sides. Then I use the powdered sugar glaze and using a basting brush within minutes after I pull the bread out of the oven. I brush on the glaze and make sure to fill the holes.  Not only does it sweeten it up, but it keeps the bread very moist.  I have had pumpkin bread haters come on over to the orange side of becoming pumpkin bread lovers!

I love this pumpkin bread however it didn't have enough spice for my taste. I added additional pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon and also added some apple pie spice. It made all the difference in this already tasty recipe.

I used whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cups of maple syrup instead of 3 cups of sugar and added vanilla extract. Baked for one hour and the bread turned out very good. It was moist, sweet and yummy. Perfect on a cold, rainy day!

I thought it was delicious. I only used about 3/4 of a cup of sugar and used more cinnamon and Pumpkin spice and it was very sweet. I wouldn't put anymore sugar in.

very tasty a bit healthier than some of the other recipes. Based on a few comments, I made a few modifications to my taste:
- 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour, 2 c all purpose flour
- added 2 tsp vanilla extract
- substitue pecans for walnuts (that's what I had on hand)
- add 1/4 c 2% milk with 1/4 c water
- a little extra of each spice

It was delicious and easy. I will definitely make this again!

This was excellent.  I followed the base recipe but tweaked it by increasing the pumpkin pie spice to 4 teaspoons and added cinnamon chips instead of walnuts.   I added a glaze made of confectioners sugar, milk, and vanilla.  Delicious.

I did not care for this recipe. the loaf tasted nothing like pumpkin and it tasted like a loaf of sugar. My son who loves everything pumpkin didnt like it either.
