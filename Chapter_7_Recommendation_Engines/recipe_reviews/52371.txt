Okay marinade.  Not bad, not great!  My 4 wheeling group gave this a 6 out of 10.  Sorry, probably won't make it into the rotation.

I actually made this from a Sandra Lee recipe on food network....just about the same recipe. I used 1/2 c. beer, 1/4 c. teryaki, 1/4 c. brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of Mccormick Montreal steak grill seasoning. Marinated a small skirt steak and a small flank for 24 hours. Grilled and the family inhaled....what a very tasty marinade. Will definately make again.

Stupendous! I used Amber Bock beer, added some minced garlic, and marinated for a couple of hours in the fridge.  Great steaks, and dinner really can't get much easier than this! Thanks Craig!

This was very good. I think there are ways to improve upon it, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I did change a couple of things. I used a ziploc bag for the marinating process, I didn't add any garlic powder, but added 4 tablespoons of minced garlic, I used a whole bottle of Guinness, 1 TBSP of Soy Sauce, 5 TBSP of brown sugar, 1 TBSP on Worcestershire Sauce, and a TBSP of black pepper. I didn't have any teryaki on hand, which is why I used the soy sauce. We used a tri-tip and marinated it for about 10 hours. Threw it on the grill for about an hour and it was really tasty. My husband really liked this recipe. I think next time I'll through in a couple of jalapeno's during the marinating and some cayenne for a little heat.

Addendum to my previous review (a previous 5 star rating).  Simmer your left-over marinade on the bbq side burner (or stove top) until it thickens.  Don't let it burn.  Makes a great thickened sauce to drizzle over the cooked steaks to maximize the flavors from the marinade.

I've only used this marinade on chicken until this past weekend. I marinated some filet mignon on Sunday evening and we grilled them last night. The tenderness of the meat was to die for!! The flavor was so savory and delicious! This is such a versatile marinade. We served it with grilled rosemary potatoes and some grilled squash.

This is really an under used marinade.  It was very tasty, super easy and I will use it again for sure.  The marinade is slightly sweet.  I didn't have any teriyaki sauce so used A-1 Sweet instead.  The steaks were tender, juicy and had great flavor.  I was afraid the marinade would burn because of the sugar, but I didn't have any issues with that.

This is a FABULOUS recipe. I followed it exactly. I used it on a large package of tri-tip steaks from Sams Club.  Grilled them to a medium rare, and we have been eating them all week.  This is a great recipe to give your meat tons of flavor and tenderness.  I marinaded these steaks in a large ziplock freezer bag in the refrigerator over night, and let them warm up to room temperature before grilling them  on a gas grill. Yum!!!

This was one of the most wonderful marinades we've used yet. It was not overpowering. Very subtle but you could taste it at the first bite. I didn't have any teriyaki sauce so I used 1 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce as a replacement. Thanks for making our dinner so yummy tonight!

Let me start out by saying this is delish! I'm going to admit I used Coors Light & still thought it was really good! This is a quick marinade that works fast and tastes very good. My seasoning salt was the no-salt homemade one from this site. Thanks for sharing!

LOVED IT!! Since it's the middle of winter for us I broiled the steak instead of grilling and it was awesome. We drizzled the juices in the pan over the steaks and mashed potatoes.

Wowza.  This was terrific.  I let some porterhouses soak in it for a few hours, and grilled them 10mins each side and it was terrific.  The brown sugar really gave a great caramelized flavor.  I did use about a Tbsp of minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.  And I seasoned the steak with the salt and pepper before putting it in the marinade.  One problem - I made a separate batch and reduced it to use as a dipping sauce - the brown sugar came out way too sweet.  Use the recipe as is for marinade (it burns off).  If making separate batch, use only 1/2 the sugar.  Thanks for a great marinade!!!  Update: used on skirt steaks (not so good - didn't give enough flavor to a tough piece of meat.)  Used on grilled shrimp - VERY good as well!  Update 2:  used on porterhouses again (with fresh minced garlic, not jarred minced) and marinated overnight - INCREDIBLE.  Even better.  Keep in mind - some people seem to complain that there is not enough flavor in this marinade - it is meant for cuts of meat that don't require a massive amount of flavor, steaks that have enough flavor on their own and this just enhances it a little - like filets, porterhouses, etc.  Don't use on a cheaper piece of meat that requires a stronger infusion of flavor.

I love the base of this recipe--it's so easy to change for different flavors or cuts of meat!  I've added different ingredients such as soy sauce, red wine vinegar and minced garlic, just depending on what I was cooking!

Yum! We doubled everything except the seasoning salt since we had 4 strip steaks. We used Amber Bock beer. We didn't poke holes or do the steps listed, we just threw everything together into a ziploc and marinated the steaks for 3 hours before grilling. We were not overwhelmed by the salt or a beer taste as other reviewers mentioned. These were a tad sweet and we might cut back on the brown sugar next time. We will definitely make this again. Great change for us! Thanks!

This is a nice marinade that's a little on the sweet side.  It doesn't require a lot of time.  I let this marinate for two hours and the flavors came through.  I used Sam Adam's Cream Stout and followed the recipe exactly.  The reserved marinade made a nice steak sauce.

Love it!!  I put half the salt, pepper & garlic in the marinade and allowed to marinade in a large zip lock bag about 1 hour.  Cut a hole in one corner, drained the marinade into a pan pulled the steaks out & sprinkled on the rest of the seasoning.  Worked out great, we really love the way sweet & tangy worked together.

I used some of the suggestions from a few of the other reviews. I used a Heiniken, added minced garlic, chopped sweet onion and marinated it for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. I also didn't have just Teriyaki sauce but used a Teriaki& honey marinade in it's place. The flavor was wonderful. Very tasty from start to finish. Even the kids really liked it. I'll use it again for sure. Oh, and I didn't let left over beer go to waste. I used it in a marinade for the shrimp I grilled to go with steak.

The best steak I've ever made!!! My 5yr old twins love it too!(they call it the "yummy steak") I only tweak it a little. The sauce is sooo good and I find there's not enough of it. I double(or sometimes triple) the beer, teryaki, & brown sugar. It's too much to add more seasoning unless using more steak. After marinating, I separate the steaks from the sauce and boil the alcohol from it(and thicken it by simmering& adding 2 TBSP of flour). Then use the extra to dunk the steak in. I usually use it for steak tips, and eveyone I've ever made it for loves it!

I have already made this 4 times....it is awesome!! I do suggest a verrry dark beer though to get the flavor.  I always marinade it over night to really get the flavors to stick...I took another reviewers suggestion and used Red Stripe and it got an A+!

If you like your meat to have a slightly sweet flavor, you'll love this marinade.  It is the best I've ever tried.  My husband loved it too.

Very good marinade. I used Samual Adams summer ale (almost the whole bottle) because that was the only beer I had that wasn't lite. I used a tiny bit more brown sugar than it called for and a bit more teriyaki.  I used a london broil and poked a bunch of holes in it.  Sprinkled some salt and black pepper on the meat and put it in the marinade.  This marinated for about 26 hours in the fridge.  Grilled it and boiled the remaining marinade to pour over the meat afterwards.  This was delicious.  I generally don't like london broil but this marinade made it nice and juicy and tender. I sauteed some mushrooms to put over it as well.  Will make again. Thanks.

This is a craveable marinade.  The cooking instructions included with this are also excellent.  

Changes--I used a pale beer instead of dark.  Because of this, I would increase the marinating time next time if I use pale ale.  I could have used a little more flavor.

I used guiness, and broiled it in the oven. Delicious! Can't wait to try it on the grill as the weather warms up.

I am not a person who likes beer at all - so I was skeptical of trying a marinade that calls for beer in the recipe. I was VERY surprised and it has become a favorite recipe of mine! :) The steak comes out very tender and moint and the marinade compliments the meat without an overwhelming flavor. EXCELLENT!

This marinade complemented the steak very well.  I enjoyed the sweetness and added extra crushed pepper.  I also cooked it on the stovetop since I don't have a grill and it turned out great!!

This is a great marinade, would be great with pork also.  I used soy instead of the teriyaki and added a little liquid smoke.

We don't like our steak too sweet, so we used soy sauce instead of the teraiki sauce.  Great Recipe!  I got requests for it at the next BBQ...

If you're more of a smokey savoury steak fan try halving the sugar, especially because some beers have a sweeter taste. To give it more of a kick add a dash of cayenne, more garlic and some worcestershire sauce.. that's the missing ingredient! Beer marinades are great for tenderizing the meat. I let mine soak it up for 2 days. My boyfriend the carnivorous steak fanatic loved it, so I will continue using it.

Delicious!  I marinated the meat for about 4 hours, and it was excellent!  This will become a staple around here!  I used light beer, since that is what we had, and subbed soy sauce for the teriyaki.  Also added garlic cloves.  We all loved it!

Loved it!  I let it marinate for almost 48 hours and used fresh garlic.  I also made a dipping sauce like some of the others suggested.  I will definately be making this again now that grilling season is upon us.

WOW! This recipe is a keeper!! It had the right mixture of sweet and salty, being flavorful but not overpowering. I think the key is that you 1) marinate the meat, 2) sprinkle the seasoning on top, and then 3) pour on the rest of the marinade. It's a couple extra (quick!) steps, but it works quite well.

I would imagine the type of teriyaki sauce, seasoned salt, and possibly beer could easily change the flavor of the marinade. So below you'll see the specific brands that I used. 
1/2 tsp seasoned salt (Lawry's)
1/4 C dark beer (Deschutes Black Butte Porter)
2 T teriyaki sauce (Soy Vay Island Teriyaki)

This was pretty good.  I let the steak marinade for about 3 hours.  Once done grilling we were left with a very pleasant but mild flavor.  I used a New Castle brown ale and did not think the flavor of the beer was overpowering at all.  Next time I will let it marinade longer and as other reviewers suggested, save some marinade to boil down for a dipping sauce.  Thanks for the post - good recipe.

Hubby & I loved this!  Only change I made (due to the Guinness disappearing!) was to use an IPA (Aprihops) beer and then doubled the marinade as suggested, but not the teryaki sauce.  Made oven fries to go with...fantastic Craig, thanks!

This recipe was so good that I had to register to be able to write a review!  I LOVED it and so did hubby!  I marinated the steaks overnight and did not have a dark beer, so I used a light.  It was superb.  Will be making this again for Father's Day!

This marinade was sensational!  I used it on NY Strips and didn't have a lot of time to marinade the beef.  Next time I will marinade it overnight so the flavors can soak in and I'll use a fattier cut of beef, like a tenderloin.  But mmmmmmmmm...it was sooooo good.  I used Sam Smith Nut Brown Ale (which is a dark, almost sweet tasting beer) and I think it gave it a flavor that my husband and I both love.  Best marinade I've ever used!  I'll keep this recipe around!!!

By far the BEST steak marinade I've ever had.  I can not stress how good this is.  My family loves it.  My mother made steaks for x-mas dinner and they all wanted the steaks marinaded in this.

Okay marinade, but it didn't impart as much flavor or tenderness and I had hoped. Not horrible, but not good enough for me to use again.

This was pretty good, even though I had to opt out of the teriyaki sauce (I thought I had some, but didn't) and use some soy instead.  I would suggest a better cut of steak, however, because once you marinate a sirloin steak with salty ingredients, it tends to toughen the steak up.  Good flavor, however, and my kids (even my hubby, who is a competition BBQer) enjoyed the sauce heated up and poured over top.

5 stars.  Really good on the grill.  Made this for just my hubby and I, 2 5-6 oz. steaks.  About $3.50 per steak.  The only thing I differently was put the steak (we used top sirloin from Sam's Club) in a ziplock bag with all the rest of the ingredients.  I marinated but left everything on the countertop at room temp for about 45 mins.  The teriyaki sauce slightly strong, I might decrease that and increase the beer next time.  But it was awesome! Tender steak, very flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe.  Can't wait to make it for our family.

I liked this marinade because it was different than a lot of the others that are over-powered by pepper.  I like a little extra pepper...  My husband LOVED this one, and would have given it 5 stars, and he is hard to please. :)

Delicious and easy!  I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so used 2 tbsp of soy sauce and doubled the amount of brown sugar.  I also used fresh garlic (4 cloves) instead of powdered.  It was yummy, and I don't even like beer!

Like another reviewer, I liked this but made substitutions and improvements.  I used minced garlic, an entire bottle of O'Dooles I had left over from a friend who doesn't drink, soy sauce, and then too much (my fault because I wanted to get rid of it) Splenda brown sugar blend.  Used a ziplock bag for about 8 hours marinating some really cheap cuts of meat.  BF raved.  I thought it was slightly too sweet (again my fault) but it made me want to add some grainy mustard next time.  Definitely a keeper recipe, though.

So good! I'm a newb cook so I got carried away with the marinating, didn't know you can over do it. Anyways it was great just don't over marinate if you want to taste your steak. ( it rhymes! )

Everyone liked it! I used this with top sirloin steaks and the only difference is that I fully tenderized both sides of the steaks with fork punctures beforehand and marinated the steaks for 3 hours before grilling.  Used Guiness for beer.  The steaks were very tender and flavorful.  We'll use this one again.

Very good marinade! Used with two huge porterhouse steaks. I did not have a dark beer, used Heineken. The teriyaki was a little powerful would recommend using less.

We did not like the flavor of the meat once maidated with this.  I'm sorry to say, it's not a keeper for our house.  We thought it was too sweet.  Followed the recipe, used filet's & marinated for about 24 hours in the fridge.

My family loved this recipe. The only change I made was using Sugartwin Brown sugar substitute and we used a teriyaki sauce that has garlic in it. I also marinated the steaks (ribeyes) for about 2 hours

This is our go-to marinade now. We usually use Heinekan. I hate beer, but this gives a very good flavour to the meat.

Great marinade!  I used Yoshida sauce as my "teriyaki sauce", minced garlic, Newcastle beer, garlic powder and omitted the brown sugar.  I figured the Yoshida Sauce would add enough sweetness without the additional brown sugar because I don't like my steaks too sweet.  I marinated the steak for about 3 hours and the result was delicious!  I loove that this marinade used simple everyday ingredients that I had lying around the house!

The beer helps tenderize the steak too!

My boyfriend and I made this randomly one day when we were in need of a marinade. The word "beer" in the title is what caught his eye. We substituted worcestershire sauce for teriyaki and added a little extra beer for good measure. We prepped it around noon and let it sit in the fridge for about 6 hours. It turned out absolutely amazing. He used the little bit of leftover steak to make what he called "the best sandwich ever" the next day. All in all, it was good stuff.

This was the best marinade I have ever had!!!  It was a big hit with the family. I had some pretty thick steaks so i used a flavor injector to inject it into the steaks.  It was great. The only change I made was I halved the pepper because we arent big pepper eaters. I am going to use it again tonight for a london broil.

Excellent!  I used this on rib-eyes. I did not have teriyaki, so I used soy sauce instead.  I doubled the recipe- except only used 2 tbsp brown sugar and I used a Guiness stout.  I marinated the steaks for about 3 1/2 hours.  Delicious!  Even Mr. Picky, "I only like steaks done my way" enjoyed this!  My mom LOVED hers and ate the entire steak- unusual for her to eat everything!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This marinade turned out great but we thought that the teriyaki flavor was just a little too overpowering.  We'll try this recipe again but may cut back the teriyaki to just 1 T.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really tasty. I made my own teriyaki sauce with soy, brown mustard, brown sugar, and garlic then added the other ingredients(i also used light beer because that is what i had) I marinated it for about 7-8 hours and broiled it. I reduced the marinade in a sauce pan and put a dash of marsala wine and added some sauteed mushrooms and onions, it was FANTASTIC!

My kids loved it and ate everything on their plate; even if my husband and I didn't love it too, I'd make it for them.  Luckily everyone thought it was delicious.  I'd probably try and cut some of the salt, but otherwise I would'nt change a thing.

This was spectacular, even though it was cooked on a stove-top griddle.  I'll go for doubling the amount of marinade next time, though...there wasn't a whole lot left to baste with.

I tried this a few weeks ago with round steak and the whole family loved it ! 

Inexpensive, easy and the ingredients are items I generally have on hand.  

I used minced garlic instead of the powder in the marinade...  

Very tasty and a nice change... Thanks !

Me and my fiancé loved this dish, the only thing I tweaked was that I let the meat sit about an extra 30 minutes on each side.  This was recipe turned out the best steak I've had in along time.

This marinade is not bad but we found the beer flavor a little strong.  I tried it on both pork and beef cuts but it is not turning out to be a favorite for my family.  Probably because my husband prefers more spices and less sweet flavors.

This is absolutely awesome!  It is almost like a popular steakhouse in our area (who serves their steak at $50 per plate) but BETTER!!!  I can't believe how wonderful this was -- will absolutely not eat steak another way again!  Kudos to you Craig! ~~ ps - I also used soy sauce and it was perfectly sweet!

This recipe adds an excellent flavor to a not so excellent cut of beef. I used a lighter beer since it was all I had, but got rave reveiws from my husband and brother in law. This is excellent with sauted onions.

Creative recipe!  We tried sirloin, but I think we'll try this marinade with a different cut of beef next time.

This was very flavorful and sank in really well when I marinated it overnight. I would definitely make it again!

I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I used soy sauce. I didn't have dark beer so I just used bud light black crown. I mixed all the ingredients together and poured it over the steak. After marinating for about 3-4 hours, I threw it on the grill. It was delicious! Will definitely use again!

This marinade is amazing! The people who did not like it or said it was bad did not follow the directions. You have to use a dark beer like Guiness. Also you do not need to marinade for more then what the recipe says. The reason you only have to marinade the steaks for the 30 minutes is because of the dark beer. My husband loved this marinade. The first time I made it I broiled the steaks and they were amazing. Follow the recipe and you will have amazing steaks!

I followed the recipe exactly. Used ribeye steaks. Excellent flavor. I will definitely use this again. I used Alaskan Amber Alt Style Ale. Pungent flavor of the beer cut the sweetness nicely. I would not expect the same result with a light beer.

I felt the beer taste was too prominent, over powered rest of ingredients. When I reduced it in pan, it overcarmelized...and became quite sticky within a couple of minutes....be sure to not put flame on too high and you must drizzle over meat and serve Asap!!!

I don't think I can eat a steak without this marinade ever again!
Also, I didn't have teriayki sauce, so I used 1/2 of what it called for and substituted it with soy sauce. I also cut down on the salt a BIT because of that.

I made this the other night, when we had a friend over for dinner. Decided to try something other than Lawry's or Adolf's. I have never cooked with beer before. I mixed the ingredients and marinade the steaks overnight. They turned out good. I am assuming the marinade would taste different depending on the type/flavor of beer you use. Will probably try again with a different beer, just to see.

Based on previous reviews, we added a chopped jalapeno and a 1/4 tsp of chili powder, and subbed garlic powder for fresh minced garlic. We marinated a top sirloin for about 5 hours and then grilled it up. Fantastic!

We did not love this, but we liked it well enough to eat it all. Somewhere between the teriyaki and the dark beer, I didn't like something going on there. But I am iffy on both teriyaki AND beer so it very easily could just be my taste buds! Thank you for sharing -- this smelled DIVINE while cooking, FYI :=)

This marinade added a nice flavor to the steaks not at all over powering... next time I will try and let the steak marinate overnight to hopefully tenderize a little more...

My dad, best friend, and brother are all very skeptical of gas grilling.  They are also very particular about their grilling.  I used this marinade for sirloin steaks one evening when they came to my house and EVERYONE raved!  I hardly grill anything else now because I and everyone else loves the flavor so much!  Tweak to taste, and LET IT MARINATE OVERNIGHT so it soaks up all the goodness!

A super tasty marinade! I usually cook up my steaks with a simple salt and peppercorn crust but sometimes you definitely want a different taste! I like the use of teriyaki sauce and the sweet balance the sugar brings to the bitter beer. I used a ziploc bag to marinate and put in some mushrooms while reducing the sauce (mushrooms on top of steak = yum). Another thing to remember is that if your steak isn't salty enough (because I am paranoid of over-salting my food), you can add salt into the reduced sauce and pour it on. I served with a side of mashed butternut squash to bring out the sweetness and a vinegar celery salad.

I made this as kebobs last night. It was great.  I also used fresh minced garlic, and I used Sam Adam's Honey Porter for the beer.  My fiance is on a low sodium diet so I used McCormick's Salt-free Table blend instead of the seasoned salt.

Great marinade!  I used a stout for this, and I think the super dark beer worked best with the sweet brown sugar.  This made two absolutely delicious, tender sirloin steaks that the family loved.  Thanks Craig for the recipe!

This stuff is great!  I followed the directions as stated, doubled, and marinaded my (bought on sale for $1.99 per pound) sirloin steak over night.  Seared both sides on the grill over high heat about 3 minutes per side, then turned heat to low, closed the lid and grilled for about 6 minutes (for medium).  I let the meat rest for 10 minutes and then sliced it up like london broil.  It was wonderful!!!  I'm going to make this again for our big Memorial Day party. I'm sure now that everyone will love it.  Thanks again!

AMAZING. So flavorful and especially delicious with the glaze reduction. This has become our default steak marinade.

Goldielocks tasted it and said "just right" and ate it all up! Wonderful! Easy. We had unexpected company so I needed to make it go further. I steemed some broccoli and made pasta. I added more teriyaki sauce and a bit of sesame oil to the marinade and tossed it all together. Delish!

This is by far the best marinade we've had for grilling, and we keep coming back to it whenever the weather is nice. We used mesquite wood chips in with the charcoal, and Penzey's 4/S Smoked Seasoned Salt the last time we made it. It turned out better than ever! It's great, too, because it doesn't need much time to marinade.

this tasty, easy-to-prepare, marinade was very effective on our sirloin steaks. 15-20 minutes of soaking the thawed steaks in this marinade produced a robust and slightly spicy flavor. 

We chose Guinness for the dark beer (highly recommend this choice for this recipe), which we believe is responsible for our favorable results. Liquids seem to soak into the steak faster than any other solid ingredient, and if you can get your other flavors to dissolve into the liquid, it should carry into the meat.   

The preparation of this marinade is very enjoyable to the senses, filling the room with a smell of barley and garlic and spices. Wonderful to experience this marinade while enjoying a beer too. 

We did NOT barbecue our steaks either. We fried them in a Foreman grill, pouring the marinade over the grilled steak occasionally. The steak turned out delicious.

Excellent! We've used this recipie twice, both times with German beer (even a tart, nasty one)... both times it turned out great.  Also, we don't have teryaki sauce so we made our own by mixing bulgolgi sauce & soy sauce to our liking... still turns out EXCELLENT!!! LOVE IT!

This marinade is delicious and not overpowering.  I let the steaks marinate for 2 hours and they came out perfectly.  I also took advice from another reviewer and put the leftover marinade and heated it up to pour over the steaks.  Great tip!

Fantastic! I will make these again. I would recommend adding a little more to the marinade if you are going to grill as you will lose alot of marinade.

This was amazing! I used Killian's Irish Red beer and doubled the marinade ingredients. We used the leftover boiled marinade as a dipping sauce for the meat. Steak has always been one of those meals I would go out for, since I couldn't make a decent one at home, but not anymore. This rivaled any "steakhouse" steak. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was a great marinade.  I put everything together in the morning and marinated the steaks all day.  I used Moose Drool Ale.  The meat was really flavorful and tender.  I may try zesting it up a bit next time.

MOST DELICIOUS STEAK/MARINADE I'VE EVER HAD! Made no changes to the recipe except using Rib-eye 12 oz steaks. Used Guiness, and marinated for about 1 hr in a bag in the fridge. Steaks were to die for.....HIGHLY recommended!

This recipe was excellent! I devoured a whole steak without steak sauce and I NEVER do that!! However, I did add a teaspoon of soy sauce and worchestershire sauce and marinated each side for two hours each. The steaks were juicy and full of flavor. I will probably use this every time I cook steaks from now on.

What a simple great-tasting marinade! I used it on chicken and added some rosemary and used Worcestershire Sauce instead of the teriyaki. A little oil was necessary since my chicken breasts were thin-cut and they dry out easily. The beer I used was a summer lager (Blue Moon) flavored with honey and citrus. Left the chicken in for about an hour and it came out great! Can't wait to try it with steak and shrimp. Seems like some of the simplest recipes turn out to be the best!

THis is a great recipe; I didn't change a thing; i just altered it minutely using turbinado brown sugar; I chose as my dark beer Unibroue's beer  type - Maudite - it has a very thick sonsistency - the description from their website is as follows:
"Maudite has a deep amber-red color with a rocky foam head and an appealing aroma of wild spices and floral hop notes.
It is spicy, vinous, and deliciously complex with a crisp hop finish."
It is really an awesome combination; I wouldn't eat my steak any other way.

I followed the recipe exactly, down to the marinade times. For the beer I used a Guinness Draught, using 1/4 cup for the marinade and responsibly disposing of the remainder :) I can't say this is the best marinade out there, there's no such thing but this is very good and different from the ordinary steak. I'll be making this again!

Thought this gave the steak a great flavor. I didn't grill the meat, but instead cubed it up for stir fry. I added some cornstarch to the rest of the marinade and used it for a sauce. Very good.

Loved this.  Used it as a marinade for a tri tip roast, let it marinade for about an hour after piercing it with a meat tenderizer gadget.  I added 4 cloves of minced garlic.  I totally forgot about the spices but this meat was excellent cooked to 135 for med. rare! Husband had 3rds he liked it so much.  It's very easy and takes no more time than any other marinade i use for tri tips so I'll go to this one very often.  Thank you!

I marinated my steaks in this wonderful marinade for about 4 hours, then seared them in a cast iron skillet on all sides on the stovetop and popped them in the oven for a bit.  My fiance said it tasted as good as something in a nice steakhouse eatery...which is a high compliment from a true Texan man!
I highly recommend it!

This was great!  I used NY strip steak and used minced garlic for some added flavor.  My family will be enjoying this again soon!

Yum!  This is really good, I used a black and tan beer that we had sitting in the fridge, very good!  I think I will save some of the sauce next time for dipping as others suggested.

Outstanding!  Used with filets, marinated for about 1 1/2 hours.  Definitely make extra for dipping.  All my guests loved it!

This is by far the best Steak Marinade ever. The secret is time and beer.I always make the recipe so it says it serves 24, it take one whole beer, and the steaks are submersed a little better. I tried it with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and let them soak for about 24 hours per side. I made these one year for a super bowl party, and 3 of the people said it was one of the best they have had in their lives.

I made this marinade and used it to grill some steaks last weekend and it was incredibly easy and smelled delicious while basting! My husband thought they were the bests steaks we've ever had! I live in the Netherlands and it was very easy to get all of the ingredients here as well. Thank you, Craig!

This is a great marinade for steaks. My husband always wants the "beer steaks" now. I added a bit of soy sauce and a few other spices. I used dark German beer since I am in Germany. It was excellent. I think it replaced my old favorite marinade. Thanks!

WOW!  I read the reviews, and made it soley based on that, not really expecting to like it.  I'm not a soda person, couldn't imagine this really tasting that great.  Was I ever wrong!  I used Pepsi instead (not a Coke family, lol) and everyone ate it up.  My four year old is not usually a meat kid, and he loved this.  Big praise for him!

I did this 2 ways on 2 different steaks the first time - one with light beer (Leinenkugel) and one with dark (Guinness) to test it out, based on a couple of reviews. The teens preferred the light, but my husband and I agreed that the dark definitely sank into the meat more and gave it a better flavor. Tonight I'm just using the dark with some sauteed mushrooms, baked potato chunks (cut some potatoes into 1/2 to 1" pieces and toss them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and parmesan - bake at 375° for about half an hour to 45 mins in a greased pan, stirring occasionally until crispy on the outside but soft on the inside - leave the skin on, it's good for you),  and a "marinated cucumber, onion and tomato salad" (recipe on this site by bogeybill). It's summer, so use some fresh veggies from the local farm stand as a side dish!

Okay...at 1st I was in doubt that beer in a steak marinade could be to my taste; But, it was delightful!  My husband made the marinade & seasoned the steaks as recipe required (I hope...LOL) - we will be making this for friends & family soon, it was THAT GOOD.

Not a bad marinade. I used fresh garlic and added some fresh ginger, then put it all in a bag with the meat and marinated for about 1 hour. The flavour was there but my family prefers MORE flavour.

I just tried this recipe substituting the beef for ostrich steaks and I must say it was amazing!  I used Shiner Boch beer because I couldn't find Becks Dark.  I let it marinade it in the fridge for about 3 hours before I cooked it.  My girlfriend and I both enjoyed it very much!  Thanks!

Great marinade. Works well with a variety of beers, and the flavor complements the meat well without covering it up.

My kids and I liked it, but my husband did not like it at all. I think it was the sweetness that turned him off. I think that the marinade would be perfect as a bbq recipe.

SO tasty.  I used an amber beer instead of a dark beer and I like the way it paired up with the taste of the brown sugar.  I made this full recipe but with two 8 oz. steaks, let them marinade for about 4 hours and the flavor was perfect!  Also, put garlic salt in instead of garlic & salt separately - was still pretty salty with the Teriyaki in there.

Very good and simple!   The only deviation from the recipe was that I let the steak marinate for a couple of hours.   Oh,  and I used strip steaks.

LOVED IT!!!  Added fresh garlic to the liquid ingredients, and skipped the salt and pepper.  Never missed the salt, and I'm a salt-a-holic!  I think I'll try this on chicken and salmon next!

This marinade was absolutely hands down TASTY! I used a Mirror Pond Pale Ale for the beer and some thick cut sirloins. Honestly the only thing I would change is  the marinating time on this. Couple hours seemed to be a decent amount of time for the marinade to penetrate the meat, but im sure extending the soak time overnight would yeild even better results! Also there is no need to resoak the steak after seasoning. It just washes the seasoning off. Just pull the steak out season it and throw it on the grill!

I didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would. I will give it one more try as sometimes it can just be the way my taste-buds are on that particular day. I also didn't have dark beer so next time I make this, I will use dark beer to see if that improves this for me.

I have made this marinade many times and experimented with slight variations. I prefer Newcastle beer, Lawry's Teriyaki, and I like using fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also recommend using a strainer before cooking the marinade into the basting sauce.

Fantastic! The flavors work so well together. I did boil the leftover marinade and serve au jus with the steak. Some people may not do this for fear of bacteria, but we're fairly laid back when it comes to the matter of taste.

I used this marinade last evening on a rib steak and I am totally surprised at how wonderful it tasted.  I usually do grilling with dry rubs but that may change due to how special this tasted.  I may have cheated a bit since I used Yoshidas cooking sauce (Costco)rather than terriyaki but I will do this one again many times over!!

I was looking for a marinade that did not have oil in it. Doubled the recipe as I had 8 pounds of Rib Steaks which I separated into 2 ziploc bags. I did not rub anything on the steak, just mixed everything in a bowl and poured into the bags and sealed them. Turned often for about 2 hours. Some one else BBQ'd so did not get to use the marinade to baste with. We did not find the steak too sweet and it was so tender. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Sorry, but this was very disappointing.  I thought the brown sugar would bring out the flavor, but it was just too sweet, and frankly, did not tenderize the meat as much as I had hoped.  I guess it's all just a matter of taste.  On the other hand, I tried the Marinade for Steak I on this site the following week, and it was absolutely outstanding.  I recommend the latter not only for the tenderness (the lemon juice and vinegar truly tenderize the meat) unless you are really going for a sweet meat flavor.

This marinade was outstanding. I followed the directions to a "T" and the marinade turned out amazing. What I liked about this marinade was that you could actually use the marinade as a dip/pour without overwhelming the steak. Awesome. Thank you.

This marinade was excellent! It compliments the natural flavors of the beef. The sauce was also excellent. I boiled it down until it was thick and served it with the steak. Do not worry about over marinating with this one because the marinade tastes like....well....steak.

Used on a thick New York strip steak for my husband. He says it's 5 stars. Marinated the steak for about an hour with all the marinade ingredients mixed together. Serveed with Ultimate twice baked potatoes from this site for an easy, man-pleasing meal. Thanks!

This was so quick and easy to make!  I followed suggestions made by other people about adding the montreal seasioning packet.  For my family, the terikayi taste was too pungent for us.  Next time, probably only use half.

I thought this was just okay. I let it marinate for about 5 hours (used Newcastle Brown Ale), I doubled the marinade recipe, and added about 1/2 tsp of chopped jarred garlic. My husband liked it okay, but still didn't have enough flavor. The beer taste was very faint. Probably will make it again but make some adjustments.

The blend of flavors was incredible! First we tasted the sweet, then the teriyaki, then the beer!  It tasted so delicious.  I marinated the steak in a plastic bag for about 24 hours.

This marinade was unbelievably great!!  I served it with roast beef, and with chicken the following day!  I did add a little chopped garlic and a little flour to thicken it while heating.  Great recipe!  I will definitely use again and again!

A very nice marinade! It was very subtle, so next time I might try marinating it for longer. The beer wasn't at all overwhelming in my opinion--I, too, used Guinness, and I definitely recommend that you DON'T try to substitute a lighter beer. I used some thick rump roasts so they were a bit tough, but still nice and juicy. I might play around with portions and marinating times in the future, but it's still a really good recipe as-is.

This marinade is most definitely pleasing to the palate!  Not only does it taste great, if really tenderizes the meat...and quickly, and smells wonderful while it's cooking.  I've tried it on steaks cooked on the grill, and on a rump roast baked in the oven.  The sweet aroma of the teriyaki sauce filled my home and stirred my appetite.  Try it, you'll love it!  Btw, I used Guinness as my dark beer and a highly recommend it.

I thought the steaks just tasted like beer.  I couldn't really taste anything else.  I used Guinness so maybe that was just the wrong kind of beer.

My husband made this for me last night and I have to say it was very tender, tasty and very juicy. My steak did not get cooked all the way so I put it in the microwave for a few minutes and the steak was still very juicy! We both agree that we will use this recipe again.

I thought this was just okay - not the recipe's fault - I am not a fan of beer and this pretty much tasted a lot like beer to me (used Great Lakes Brewing Company's Edmund Fitzgerald beer).  My husband thought it didn't have much flavor at all.  Our friend liked it but is also a beer drinker.  If you like beer I would try this, but if not, probably not the marinade for you!!!

I followed the recipe, but was not blown away.  This has a very sweet taste, but needs a little zing.  If I were to do it again I would add some more spices.  I will say that the meat was very tender.

This was not one of my favorite flavors for steak.  I used a filet mignon which is very tender but can lack in flavor.  I thought I would realy like the combinations of flavor with this recipe but I was not crazy for it.  It was very simple to make.

I love it when I agree with everyone else.
It just doesn't get any better than this. It is simple, easy, and good enough to write home about. I used it on venison steak, and cannot wait to try it on something else. Thank you Craig Jones!

Very nice flavor and certainly makes the steak tender.  I marinated the steak for 2 hours on each side.  Plus I added minced garlic to the sauce.

Very good, but we personally prefer a little more zing in our marinades.  I'm going to try it again with more garlic and maybe a TBSP more teriyaki sauce.

This is THE marinade! My entire family loved it!! Even my super picky daughter. My husband said "thats what steak is supossed taste like!" I did make a couple small changes so that I could use what i had on hand... I only had light beer, so I added a couple teaspoons of molasses to it. I did not have any teriyaki sauce, but I had A1 teriyaki marinade so I used that. DELICIOUS !!
Thanks for an awesome marinade! (BTW- It also tastes great on ribs!)

This was easy and the steak came out tender and juicy.  I used bone in NY Strip.  I would give this a 5 star but my son rated it 4.5 and my husband gave it a 3(he's not a marinade fan).  Will definitely make again.

Great steak marinade.  Used with ribeyes and filets.  I usually marinate for 1-2 hours.  Don't baste steaks w/ sauce while cooking, but once done, either spoon some on top or serve on the side.

My boyfriend and I thoought that this was pretty good... we may do it again with a less choice cut of meat (we use omaha steaks rib-eyes, so they were already very tender).  We added lots of garlic to the marinade, and increased the marinading time to a few hours.  I reduced some more of the sauce and it made a very nice, thick, and sweet sauce as a topping.

This was good but very beer-y.  I actually used about a cup of beer because I let it marinate all day and didn't want to waste an entire beer!  Morning is just too early to finish the bottle off myself!  Plus, 1/4 cup just wouldn't have made very much marinade.  So I did add more of all the other ingredients too.  I used a wheat beer and it was still quite a strong taste.  It grilled up beautifully and we enjoyed it.

A big hit. I subbed Ponzu sauce for the teriyaki (what I had on hand) and used a brown sugar/splenda mix (stick with brown sugar, this made it a bit too sweet) and about a tablespoon of Montreal Steak seasoning. I marinated steak tips for kabobs and also marinated the veggies.  Everyone loved it!

Tasty!  My kids (teens) turned up their noses at the taste of the beer still left after grilling, so if your eaters are picky, take that into consideration.  Otherwise, a good choice!

Very Delicious. I used rib-eyes instead and it turned out fantastic, but the marinade was so good it owuld work with any steak. Also it only took around 10 minutes, but I used the oven instead.

YUMMY!  I am not a huge fan of dark beer and might try this recipe again with a lighter beer, maybe Heineken.  This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks.

This was good.  I myself don't really like sweet things thus the 4 stars but my husband really liked it.  I just combined the ingredients and let the steak marinade in a bag for 4-6 hours.  Quite juicy.

I added lemon juice to the marinade and let it sit in the fridge for 3 hours.  Before broiling the steaks I added honey. We eat our steaks rare.  It was great.

Superb on steak, as a matter of fact, it was good heated and eaten right off the spoon.  Will use this over and over and over again.

This was a huge hit at our son's recent wedding rehearsal dinner!  We served a high quality sizzler cut bought at a local meat market, grilled them on the grill, and the rave reviews that we got from our 35 guests about the meat and its flavor were great!  This is definitely a keeper!

This was pretty decent.  I didn't have any dark beer and used regular and marinated for about 1.5 hours. Probably won't use it again, tho.

This was a good marinade, the steak was tender but the flavor didn't wow me.  I may use it again, but I will keep looking for a better one.

Maybe I did not give this recipe a fair shot, because I just threw all the ingredients of it together and marinated the steaks, but I thought it was pretty flavorless.  I could not hardly taste it at all after marinating for six hours.

All I can say is WOW.  This was excellent.  I unfortunately didn't have any dark beer around, so I used a Molson Ice and it was still awesome.  I cannot WAIT to try this again the right way!!! I also marinaded the steak for 8 hours.  Very very tasty.  Thanks for this recipe!!

Liked this a bunch. Used bone-in ribeyes and let marinate just a tad longer. Next time I might reduce the brown sugar just a smidgen. Great flavor.

WOW!  What a great steak.  I served this with Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes (which are fabulous) and Rich and Simple French Onion Soup.  It's a winning combination!!  The steaks were so juicy and flavorful.  Must try!
