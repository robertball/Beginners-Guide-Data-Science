If you’re in search of a good lemon, buttermilk and/or pound cake,  stop here.  This one is all you’d hope for.  Moist, great flavor, tender crumb, not too dense (the small amount of baking soda gives it just the right amount of lift) and beautiful.  I did substitute pure lemon oil for the extract, but that did not influence my 5-star rating.  Copelandsk, I have no doubt your mother did in fact win blue ribbon awards for this cake.  It really IS a winner.

This is not your daughter's cake.  No triple-threat chocolate, caramel, salted, nouveau let-it-sit-for-a-day-so-the-flavor a-can-blend cake here.  This is simply a fabulous old-school cake, with the perfect moistness and density of a pound-cake-gone-right.  This is the type of cake my mother would have presented  on our birthdays, or served to company on a Sunday afternoon:  simple in its elegance, with understated decadence.  It doesn't need bells and whistles to draw attention to itself, the texture, density and flavor do all of the talking.  

     That said, mine needed about 12 minutes longer cooking time, so keep that  in mind for your particular oven and bundt pan.  The top looked done, but my cake tester said it was still wet, so testing is essential.  Lastly, if anyone has ideas of serving the cake without the icing, or not using lemon zest in their icing, stop right there and choose a different recipe.  The icing takes it over the top. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you'll have them eating at your feet.

I made this for a pot luck, and everyone loved it was so moist and light. I did make a couple of substitutions, but they didn't really make a big difference to the recipe, just a personal preference.

 I cut the sugar by half a cup, replaced 1 cup of butter with applesauce, and used lemon juice and lemon zest in place of the lemon extract.  Then I added a cup of fresh blueberries. I used someone's suggestion of coating the bundt pan with sugar, then used a lemon glaze

Days later the cake is still as moist as the day I baked it. I will be making this again.

I love starbucks lemon loaf and I had tried another recipe, it was okay.I loved this one and it is very easy to make. I've made 2 in 2 days, and will probably have to make another one because it is just great. I forgot to add that I decreased the milk and added more lemon juice, both by 1/4 cup, and also I added lemon zest because I wanted more citrus flavor to the mixture. I recomend this recipe for you to try it.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake was perfect!!  Moist, just the right amount of lemon flavor, dense and extremely tasty.  Because I love the glaze, I doubled the recipe and covered the entire cake puddling a good amount in the center of the bundt.    Keep in mind to follow the usual good baking tips of room temp eggs and use real butter, softened. I took this into the office for a meeting and everyone loved it.  The cake disappeared within minutes after the word got out it was in the break room.  One office mate sheepishly asked if I would make it for her birthday coming up in a couple of weeks.   I have never had such a positive response to a cake that I baked and am happy to have another opportunity to bake it again soon.

Delicious!  I made it vegan by substituting eggs with flax "egg" (1 tbl flax + 2 tbl water for each egg called for), milk used was almond with 1 tbl apple cider vinegar, and coconut oil for butter, plus vegan sugar.  I also made it gluten free with Bob's Red Mill all purpose gf flour.  Cake was perfect...crusty on the outside and tender on the inside.  Glad I tried it!

Oh yum. This was awesome. I am sure it would be great as listed. I added zest to the batter and a little more than 1/4 cup of lemon juice in glaze. A little extra lemon was great. I also greased my bundt pan and added sugar instead of flour. This gave the resulting cake a bit of a crunchy crust, even after drenched with the glaze. I made the batter with a hand mixer because I don't own a stand mixer. I followed the times and instructions carefully and all worked out fine. Then since the beaters were in the dishwasher, I had to use a wisk on the glaze, which also worked out just fine. I made this for a party of 8 with lots leftovers (it is rich). The cake got raves, even from talented cooks (!!!). I will make this again.

I decided to try this recipe since it was made with buttermilk and called for lemon extract and zest instead of sour cream and lots of lemon juice and zest like my old recipe. The resulting cake was rather disappointing…it was dry and it did not have the moist decadent lemon flavor as my old recipe. I will go back to my old sour cream recipe for future baking.

Perfect cake & easy recipe! I added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract and the zest from 2 lemons to give it more flavor.

Great recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup of cream cheese to the butter and also added a drop of vanilla extract along with the lemon.  Yummy.

This is a deliciously moist lemon cake.  When I crave lemon cake, I normally buy the Starbucks Lemon Loaf or make the Krusteaz Meyer Lemon Pound Cake Mix (Yum!). However, I had all of the ingredients on hand and wanted to make a scratch cake.  I made two alterations, following the rest as per the recipe directions.  I subbed 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of butter.  I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups. The batter filled a 10 cup bundt pan, with enough left over for 6 regular sized cupcakes.          On the 1st day, the lemon glaze was pretty tart and overwhelming the flavor of the cake.  However, on day 2, the lemon flavor had mellowed a bit and complimented the cake very well. The only change I would make next time is to add more lemon extract or lemon juice/peel to the cake batter. I will definitely make this cake again!

JUST AN FYI: The recipe on the All Recipes App is not exact to the one on the website. The butter portion is way off.  It reads 2 Tablespoons on the app, compared to 1 1/2 cups on the website. I am glad I caught this before making this recipe. Possibly could the admin change this?

Wow made this beautiful cake yesterday for Easter Sunday. Huge hit. I have tried so many pound/bundt cake recipes with no success but this one truly is award winning. All the other recipes I've tried are too dense & the cake comes out with a wet heavy spot in the center no matter how long you cook it. Followed the recipe exactly, I used low fat cultured buttermilk & European style butter (Plugra) for the cake & fresh squeezed lemons for the glaze. Instead of pouring the glaze on I used a pastry brush to coat the entire cake. I still did half the glaze first & then brushed on the 2nd half of the glaze after cooling like the recipe calls for. I used the nordic ware heritage bundt pan. What an amazing result. This is a true pound cake. I cooked for 70 minutes, (checking at 60 mins) in my oven, it was perfect. The family was already placing their orders for b'day & an upcoming baby shower to make this cake. The only thing I'm mad about is it took me so long to find & make this recipe. Thanks Sarah this will be a family jewel for years to come.

I didn't have lemon extract on hand, so I used vanilla instead. This recipe is perfect. It's easy to make and stayed fresh, moist and delicious, even after a week (In a cake keeper). 
Thanks for sharing this recipe- It's definitely a keeper for me.

Comes together very quickly once you have whipped the sugar and butter together.  Delicious, moist -- with just a hint of lemon.  I used lemon oil, as recommended by naples34102, which probably upped the lemon flavor in the cake.  I thought it was perfect with that substitution.  Not sure how anyone is ending up with curdled glaze?  Be sure to sift your powdered sugar.  Thank you for a delicious cake, Sarah! *Update -- Last time I made this cake, I added a full tablespoon of lemon oil and wow!  This cake went from having a hint of lemon to being a very lemon-y pound cake.  Delicious either way, but for those who want more lemon, I recommend adding the extra lemon oil.  This is a family favorite!

This cake is good, but I wish there was more lemon flavor in the cake instead of most of it in the glaze. The batter was so thick I was afraid it would be to dense and dry, but it turned out great. Next time I'll add lemon zest to the batter.

Followed recipe exactly and was told by my husband that it was the best thing I ever made.  I bought a decorate bundt pan so the presentation was even nicer for our Easter dinner.  I'll make it again, but will make extra icing.

I just made this and it came out AWESOME!!!! I used a little more than 1/4 cup of lemon juice  and 1 Tbsp of lemon zest instead of lemon extract, and 1  1/4 cups of buttermilk  in the cake batter to give it more of a lemon flavor. This cake came out so moist and delicious!!! My new go to!!

I didn't care for the icing - it seemed to curdle or separate. Next time I won't add butter.  My cake took longer than 70 minutes to bake.  Outside had a "crust" before inside was baked through.  Serve with ice cream or strawberries.

This lemon pound cake is PERFECT! I have a great pound cake recipe I generally use but I decided to try this one based on the amazing reviews. I was not disappointed! I could only find my smaller Bundt pan so I made one exactly as written and for the second cake I threw in a heaping cup of frozen blueberries (coated with flour to keep them from falling to the bottom of the pan). Both cakes were EXCELLENT! That glaze is to die for, don’t skip out on that!  Try this recipe exactly as written, you won’t be disappointed! The blueberry one took quite a bit longer to bake so make sure you test your cake with a knife for doneness. My sister in law who is not a sweet fan said I could sell this at a fancy bakery! :)

I received nothing but praise for baking this cake. Fluffy, moist, great flavor, and delicious.

I added extra lemon flavor and 1/4 cup more buttermilk.

Just make sure you sift the dry ingredients well. Don't over cook and the cake will be great.

I found this recipe yesterday while perusing the site.  I was looking for a different lemon cake other than my go to one.  

The batter was delish.  I only used 2 cups sugar and I omitted the lemon extract.  I used 1/4 Cup lemon juice and 3/4 Cup buttermilk.  Mine did bake a little longer (1 h, 20 min), but I attribute that to the lemon juice.  It turned out beautifully!!  I did get a little over zealous with the glaze, now I see why all the pics had puddling around the cake edge!!  

Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

The only reason I have rated this a 4 is the use of lemon extract.Why use this when the zest of a couple of lemons would taste so much fresher?   
This is a beautiful cake and the topping is a must.   Serve as is or with a few fresh strawberries and some mint leaves for an attractive presentation.    Enjoy...recommend highly and follow as written.   Thanks  to the submitter.

Super delicious! I decreased the sugar to 2 cups and added 1/4 cup juice of a lemon to  almond milk make a cup of buttermilk. I also added 1 Tbsp of  lemon zest to batter. I also used sugar to coat the buttered bundt pan. 
I will definitely make again. Melts in your mouth. Oh I also added fresh blueberries! ;)

If I don't hurry and give some of this away, I'll be selfish and then later sorry because I'll eat the whole thing right away!  So good and so right up my alley!  Just follow the directions from beginning to end, and you won't be sorry!  Don't skimp on that zest, either!  Thank you so much for sharing, Sarah!

The batter was thick and delicious I made two in a row but when I put it in the oven and let it go for an hour I took it out and it collapsed •_• I was upset, it was the first time baking a lemon pound cake because my normal recipe for a pound cake wouldn't be a fit for a lemon. :( oh well.

This was a beautiful cake!  I did add a few things because of personal preference:  a teaspoon of vanilla extract, cinnamon, & 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also used fresh lemon juice in the batter & the glaze!  Made this for my mom for Mother's Day!  She loves it!

What I love about this recipe is the flavor.  The lemon wasn't overpowering.  The glaze wasn't too thick.  The only change I made was I used two loaf pans since I didn't have a bundt pan.

I compared this recipe with the one in the old Joy of Cooking cookbook, it differs a little from the newer edition.  Everything in the newer edition almost 50 years later is a bit healthier, but sometimes you just need to bite the bullet and make a cake that's worth eating and this is one of them.  All of that buttery goodness is heaven to the senses.  It's an easy cake to make and forgiving to bake ( I've never had one fall yet).  I bake this recipe about twice a year and I always get good comments on it .........It's a winner!

K. We won't be making this again. It baked beautifully, then fell spectacularly just before removing from oven. If the flavor were phenomenal, I'd keep it and not worry about it falling, but it was overly greasy, and not lemon-y enough for me. I like the glaze, but the cake wasn't good. I'm starting to wonder if it's an altitude issue. We're over 5000 ft.

I made this cake exactly as written. It was a perfect bundt cake and it was delicious. I made it for our Easter dessert.  
Mine took exactly an hour to bake. Thank you for sharing.....UPDATE

I made this cake again. The first time I made it, I didn't notice that the instructions were to preheat the oven to 350, then turn it down to 325. I tried it this way on the second cake and I believe it is a moister cake this way. 
So, it took 1 hour at 350. It took 75 minutes when you preheat to 350 then turn it down to 325. I am so in love with this cake. I am one of those people that scrapes off most of the frosting on a cake. I am all about the cake and prefer a glaze.-----I made this cake again. I like  it as written. I have tried adding this and that to it, but it is perfect the way it is.

This recipe makes a great cake.  I followed the recipe with just a couple of small changes.  I replaced the lemon extract in the cake with 1 Tablespoon of undiluted lemonade concentrate and added the zest of a lemon into the cake batter.  For the glaze I used undiluted lemonade concentrate and the zest of another lemon. I separated the glaze into 2 bowls and made one bowl very thin and drizzled that over the warm cake.  I left the second bowl of glaze thicker and applied it to the cake as more of a 'frosting' as it was spreadable.  It was tart and lemony and held up well over several days.  Guests took seconds of this moist and flavorful cake. Some added vanilla ice cream, others used a small bit of heavy cream, others ate it plain.  It's simple and elegant and delightful.  It's a perfect spring/summer dessert.

Excellent! I was at our Co-Op and too tired to make a trip to the local grocery, so I made this cake completely organic :). I was out of powered sugar, so even used organic. A first for me. The organic Meyer's lemons added extra flavor and color to the glaze. The lemons juiced (and zested) beautifully, had a wonderful lemon taste, and actually had a rich yellow color! The cake has just the right amount of crumb, is light, i.e. not too rich, a rich buttery smell and crisp outer layer from the butter, which made it my son's favorite part of the cake. I'm glad I only have one son left at home or there wouldn't be any cake left this morning.

My husband's favorite cake is lemon pound cake. I have tried so many recipes over the years with results ranging from inedible to ok but nothing special. I made this one for his birthday last year and it was AMAZING. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!! I have been asked to make it for every holiday since!

I like pound cake for just about everything including Strawberry Shortcake, because of its consistency and it is an easy bake if you follow the recipe. The hard part is finding one that satisfies you. This one did. I found this recipe a few months ago and tried the original first because I really like Lemon Cake. It was great. Then i decided to change the recipe a little to make an Orange Pound Cake and got the same great quality, next I made a Strawberry Pound Cake with Frozen Strawberries that I chopped up and included right into the batter. I also added in a half cup of Nesquick Strawberry Drink mix into the batter, which made the batter pink but added strawberry flavor to the cake.  I Whipped Heavy Cream, dropped in three drops of Red Food Col;oring, for a topping and put sliced strawberries on each slice as it was served. Great. Then came Lime with Lime Icing drizzelled on the top, this too was great. I didn't have an extract for the lime cake so I used the juice of two limes and the zest of both in the batter. I used the juice of one lime in the powder sugar  with a Tbsp of milk and just poured it along the top of the cake slowly letting it run over the sides and set up. But what I like best is the moistness of all the cakes and the distinctive tastes of each. They go great with coffee, milk or whatever you may want. They don't last long.

Lemony perfection! The first time I made it I didn't grease and flour the pan properly and it kind of made a mess of things, however, my second attempt(5 days later) was much more successful.  Both products tasted wonderful and I only substituted 1/2 the amount of butter with shortening  and added lemon zest to the cake batter. Delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I made this recipe for an engagement party and it was very popular. I reduced the sugar amount by 1 cup and thought it was PLENTY sweet especially with the glaze! I only had 1 cup of powdered sugar so I made half the glaze a little runnier to cover the entire cake. I also reduced the amount of butter to 2 sticks and added 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt. Next time, I may try to reduce the amount of butter a little more : ).

This pound cake is PERFECT. Super moist, with a light lemony flavor and not dry at all. 

I didn't make the glaze because I don't care for it, and I had to substitute 1.5 tsp of baking powder for the baking soda, because I was out. Even with that substitution, the cake came out AMAZING. Easily the best lemon pound cake I've ever eaten. I can't wait to make this again.

Made it exactly as written. The cake was dense, but very dry and not much lemon flavor.  It was my first attempt at making a pound cake and I learned that I need to pay closer attention to the first step in beating the eggs.

On the other hand, I used fresh lemon juice for the glaze and it was amazing !

Will try to make this again, using lemon juice in the cake batter instead of the extract.

And the prep time was much longer than 20 mins.

This was just what I was looking for. The best lemon cake ever. The only change I made was that I added 1 extra teaspoon of lemon flavor and I added a teaspoon of grated lemon zest  to the cake batter. It turned out perfect !!!  Thanks @ Sarah

I've made this cake twice: once with 8 oz cream cheese beaten with the butter and instead of the buttermilk I used 1/4 cup lemon juice (omitted buttermilk and lemon extract because I didn't have any). It was AMAZING! second time I made it I thought I should be fair and try out the recipe as is, again, I didn't have lemon extract, so I added vanilla extract instead and well, made a vanilla buttermilk pound cake without the glaze and it is STILL AMAZING! I've tried other pound cake recipes and I've never liked pound cake until I tried this recipe. It is an excellent base for pound cake and you can change the flavoring to make whatever you like.

Hello everyone, i made this Lemon-Buttermilk Pound Cake twice now and everyone loved it. The only small change i made was to add another half cup of Buttermilk instead of 1 cup. I also baked it on 325 degrees from start to finish. this cake is absolutely delicious.

I loved this cake! Super easy to make. It tastes delicious as written in the recipe, but if you like a bit more lemon flavor, follow the suggestion from a previous review: cut 1/4 cup buttermilk and add 1/4 cup lemon juice. adds just a little more of the lemon flavor to the cake.

I love this recipe. I made it for my best friend's birthday & I love the lemon taste in it. I added a little more zest & lemon juice to the batter for a more lemony taste. I don't think I made the glaze correctly so I added powder sugar on top with the glaze. This Wii be my go to recipe for sure

I halved the recipe to make a smaller bundt cake.  Add 1/2 t. lemon zest to increase flavor.  Cake was very dry and even with the additional the the zest and lemon flavoring, it still wasn't very tasty.

Less 1/2 c sugar, added 1 tsp almond extract as well as the lemon, also 1 c chopped drained maraschino cherries, added at very last (can toss in a scant 1/4 cup flour to reduce juices)...awesomeness!

I read reviews before I made this because I was also looking to make something similar to the Starbucks lemon slice. I made a few changes. I added 1Tbsp lemon zest to the batter along with squeezing about 1Tbsp of that lemon into the batter. I also agree that it's important to whip this batter for 10 minutes to get it light and fluffy as stated. I poured my batter into 2 glass loaf pans and 1 little one and it took close to 90 minutes to bake through the large loaves. I made my frosting with 2 cups of powdered sugar beat with 3Tbsp melted butter 1tsp of lemon extract and added lemon juice to obtain the right consistency. I think it turned out great! I want to also say that had I had meringue powder I would have tried the frosting with 2 cups powdered sugar, 2Tbsp meringue powder and 1tsp lemon extract for a hard frosting but maybe next time.

I haven’t even tasted it yet but I know this will be a favourite recipe.  The lemony smell as it was baking was divine, the only thing I added was I put a little bit of lemon zest into the batter with the lemon extract.  It came out perfectly, got a great rise which was very surprising based on the amount of baking sofa but the 10 minutes to beat the egg and sugar to a fluffy soft consistence go a long way to keeping this cake light.

Husband loved, but I only liked. I wanted something like the Starbucks lemon pound cake.
The cake was VERY dense, and not very lemony. It was also the color of flour. Not white, but beige.
The icing was delicious, but I didn't like the appearance of the lemon zest, it looks bumpy and ugly.
I think it would be delicious as a plain pound cake with plain glaze, minus the lemon and lemon zest.
I'm looking  for a lemon-yellow cake with strong lemon flavor, and a homogenous glaze that's not runny or speckled.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I don't have lemon extract, so I use 2 teaspoons of lemon zest in place of the extract.    No other substitutions.  This recipe is perfect as is!

Glazing the cake while still warm is key.  The glaze soaks in and its just amazing.

Cake was delicious & moist. However, it didn't have much of a lemon flavor without the glaze. I think I'll add lemon zest and maybe more extract next time.

Very tasty!  Did not fit in my 9-cup domed Bundt pan.  
I used fresh strawberries in a strawberry-flavored glaze instead of the lemon glaze.

Lemonylicious glaze! I used this glaze on my daughter's angel food birthday cake.  Zest of 1 large lemon, juice of the same lemon plus a tiny bit of bottled juice (because I didn't have another fresh lemon).  Fantastic.

OMGoodness! This cake is sooo delicious I almost skipped icing it! You can serve this cake with or without the lemon glaze and it's a winner. I got halfway through eating it and I said "ok maybe I should give a review on this while there's still some left. The recipe makes enough glaze to do the cake twice or save some for dipping. Simply fabulous!

I made this looking for a *lemony* lemon pound cake and while this came out super delicious, it was much lighter and fluffier than a pound cake and with very little lemon flavor to be found in the cake itself even after I added lemon juice and zest to the batter along with the lemon extract.

It was very good just a little dry in the center but had to cook as long as I did to get it done.

This came out too dry.  I think maybe I just don't like pound cakes.  Will look for a recipe with pudding except homemade, not boxed.

The cake was wonderful and easy to make.  It didn't turn out perfectly for me, but I believe that is a result of the silicone bundt pan I used.  I've always had problems with it and now it is officially in the trash.  I was able to save the cake by making a lemon curd and filling it in.  It was a wonderful, bright, tasty cake.

Wouldn’t change a thing about this cake!  I don’t even care for pound cake and I’m surprised by how delicious this is and the texture is amazing too!  New favorite for my family!

Thanks for sharing! After all the mixing and fluffing, had my doubts about the poundcake-worthiness of the batter, but I found the following day after baking is when to eat/serve this cake....the flavors really meld and the cake sets into that nice heavy poundcake texture. ...it is heavenly! 
And I'm not even a big lemon person. 
I was a little leary about the butter in the glaze, I've never done that before, but it tastes great. I think I put it on when cake was too cool, I think it must have to be warm to get it to really glaze dues to the butter.
This was requested by my aunt for Mother's Day, so I'm making it again. 
I'll have to give it away before I eat it all!

Great cake!  I accidentally forgot to turn down the oven, it still came out fine at 75mins.  Moist and very flavorful.  Used lemon zest instead of lemon extract, since that's what I had on hand.  (2 tsp zest).  This is going into my keep box!

One of the most disappointing recipes I have made from this site. I followed directions exactly as written.  Started checking at  50 min and took out of oven at 62 min.  Cake was very dry and had little lemon flavor.  I made a trip to the store to buy the ingred....def not worth it.

Amazing lemon pound cake. I halved the recipe and baked in a loaf pan. Also added fresh blueberries as per another review. This will definitely be added to my recipe box. Beats all the other lemon loaf breads I’ve tried.

I love me some lemon so I added lemon zest into the batter with fresh lemon juice and made twice as much of the glaze!!!! Bayybee Yummy in my Tummy!!! I used regular milk instead of buttermilk and added some vanilla extract into the glaze mixture. I’ll be making this again but maybe with strawberries instead...

Well, it tastes amazing! But, it did not come out of the pan. :(   half of it came out and the other half broke off, so it looks really bad. But tastes really good.

Scrumptious!!  Will definitely keep in my recipe box.

I could not find my lemon extract, so I grated the zest from one lemon into the batter. I think it is important to let the sugar beat til fluffy.  When baking, the cake was so fluffy that it overflowed onto the floor of my oven, which was not a problem, until the next time I tried to use the oven, then I got smoked pepperoni pizza. Last, I would recommend this cake for one event. We make the cake last weekend. Even though we have kept it tightly wrapped, as the week wears on, the cake dries out. Still, we all love the flavor and texture.

My family enjoyed this cake.  It was my first time making a pound cake, but it came out perfectly moist. I did use sour cream instead of buttermilk, only because I didn't have any on hand.  This one is a keeper, thanks so much for sharing.

Oh my goodness...this cake was so delicious. My family gave me kudos and my co-workers said I did a great job. One co-worker even put in an order for me to make her one. 
I did not change anything in the recipe and it turned out perfect. I was pleasantly surprised (I've got the baking bug) since I am just starting to bake. Everyone truly enjoyed it, especially the glaze...to die for.
I will be making this again.

This was the best pound cake I've ever had! Best cake from scratch I've ever made! Only thing I added was a little extra lemon extract and one teaspoon of baking powder to fluff it up a bit. Delicious!

I added double the amount of lemon extract in the batter and made a double batch of glaze after reading other reviewers' comments. Rather than pour the glaze over the bundt cake as indicated in the directions, I pasted it on with a pastry brush. It came out of the oven in 65 minutes and was moist with great melt in your mouth texture and loads of lemony goodness! 

Probably didn't need to double the glaze since I ended up not needing it. My girlfriends and I experimented with drizzling some extra glaze on our pieces of cake. Some liked it better with extra glaze and some liked it as is.

moist and flavorful.  I love lemon so  I increased the lemon extract to 1 tablespoon and added 3 tablespoons of zest to the batter.  I will use this base recipe for all of my future pound cakes.

Took the advice from another reviewer and added lemon zest to the batter. It turned out great. Everybody loved it. Will definitely be making this again and again.

This cake is so delicious and we couldn't stop eating it! The glaze can't be missed. I like to brush some on, let it dry, then brush more on, until it forms a nice thick crust similar to the lemon cake at Starbucks. 

To make the glaze easier, I blend the powdered sugar with the lemon peels (avoiding the pith) in my food processor before adding the butter and lemon juice. It makes everything come together much easier than zesting a lemon.

Took out the lemon zest and added a little more lemon juice. Resulting in a stronger lemon taste in the glaze.

I followed the recipe and the cake was very moist. Almost greasy. I saw a comment after I made it that the butter portion was off- that was exactly the problem. While it tastes ok, I’m really disappointed at how it turned out. I think I’ll try another lemon pound cake recipe.

I am a lemon lover and had some buttermilk I wanted to use and found this recipe. I took the chance and made it exactly as written and it came out delicious! I was afraid it wouldn’t have enough lemon flavor but it was perfect. I’m one of those that likes double the filling on my lemon bars. The icing is what truly gives it the lemon taste.

I made it for my parents, and it was a hit! My parents don't like things that are overly sweet and I have a huge sweet tooth, so we rarely like the same desserts. However, all of us loved this. Perfectly moist, wonderful, 10/10.

Delicious! So moist. I was worried the better was too thick but it rose beautiful and was moist. I did make a simple syrup of 2/3 water and sugar, boiled and then added 2 tbls of fresh lemon. Also used low fat buttermilk and 1/4 cup of sour cream. Lastly used fresh lemon zest and glazed. So good!

I made this for my fiancé’s birthday (per his request); I’ve never been a fan of lemon-flavored confections. He took a bite, widened his eyes, then demanded that I take a bite immediately. I obliged, and to my surprise, it was absolutely DELICIOUS - especially to someone who’s not a lemon fan. I’ve eaten a few more slices since then. I’m beyond impressed! Thank you!!!

I made this as written.  First I will rate without the frosting. I am disappointed in the lack of lemon taste.  I really have to remember that I put lemon in.  It is a very light textured cake, unlike lots of pound cakes. I did not make this in a bundt pan.  I put it in a long loaf pan bought at King Arthur Flour and will comment as soon as I put the glaze on. On the one cake with the glaze. I really like the texture of this cake.  It is so much lighter than most pound cakes, but the lemon flavor is just not what I was hoping for.

The cake came out fantastic.  However, I thought it was too sweet and the lemon dominated too much for my taste.  So, I made some modifications to try next time. This time I used Swans Down Cake Flour instead of All Purpose Flour.  The next time I will continue to use Swans Down Cake Flour.  The next time I am going to cut the white sugar down to 2 cups.  For the glaze I am going to cut the confectioners sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and the lemon juice down to 1/8 cup.  Will do another review when I try this.

It came out very dense and rich. I think I added a bit too much lemon juice as the icing was a ittle too lemony but other than that, it was enjoyed by everyone.

This is the best recipe that I have tried on this website.  Cake rises beautifully  with a great texture. The batter tasted amazing which was a great surprise.  I did cut back by 1/2 cup on the sugar and used cake flour instead of all purpose flour.  I also used lemon zest and a tsp of lemon juice instead of the extract and added a tsp of vanilla. The results a wonderful cake that can be eaten on it's own and you can skip the glaze but if you have a sweet tooth than prepare the glaze.  I had a slice this morning with strawberries and blueberries. :-)

Made following the recipe, it’s just ok. The glaze is too sweet and the cake not lemony enough and also too sweet. Also using the AP flour makes it more bread-like than I prefer for pound cake. I will make it again but with major tweaks - the recipe as is just isn’t good enough

The bundt pan I used the first try was too small. The second time I used the same bundt pan, but also a regular cake pan and it turned our great!

This recipe worked so well. It has received rave reviews from those who were treated to it. I will try someoone else's suggestion and put some lemon zest in the dough. While there was a hint in the cake and it goes so well with coffee, a little more lemon flavour would be better for us.

This as it came out deserves a 5-star and will be made again.

This cake is great. I made exactly according to the recipe ( I always do the first time).  I used two smaller bundt pans so I could freeze one. It still took 15 minutes longer to bake. Thanks to the earlier reviewer for mentioning this. I will make again with no changes. Yummy!

I followed recipe as is.  I kept testing it but had to add half an hour to the time.
Used actual lemon juice and lemon zest.

OMG so darn good. The only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of butter extract and a teaspoon of vanilla butter emulsion which just amped up the flavor! So so good!!!

So lemony! I love the refreshing flavor of this cake for summer, but the amount of citrus called for can produce a bit of a pucker effect. So maybe dial back the lemon juice a bit if serving to a crowd not overly crazy about lemon.

I halfed the recipe because I have not made it before.  Unfortunately mine sank when I checked on it after 50 minutes of baking.   I baked it for 62 minutes.  It might have to do with altitude and not that it was a bad recipe.   I am at 6800 ft.  So I will have to do some more research.   It does taste good.

I made this as directed and it was pretty good.  The cake is very dense (not light & fluffy) but the taste is good. The lemon is tasted more in the icing.

Great butter pound cake & the recipe was easy to follow. This cake is beautiful and so tender. Personal preference, I would like to have a bit more lemon taste in the actual cake. Next time I will add some zest and about 1/4 cup of juice to the recipe & see how that turns out.

I made this cake to a tee.  The only thing I tweaked was adding more lemon extract to the recipe to boost the lemon flavor.  Although edible, it was so bland tasting and tasted more like a fluffy cornbread.  It was also dry.    Not crumbly dry but tasteless dry.   I won't make it again.   I need to create my own lemon cake recipe because I can't find one that I truly like.

While the cake turned out beautifully, it was awfully dry. I doubled the glaze and was glad I did as that helped to add a little more moisture/flavor to it.

I used this for cupcakes, and they turned out great!! 24 perfect little pound cakes. I made a Meyer lemon cream cheese frosting in lieu of glaze, but still amazing choice when you want lemon that isn’t overkill.

My family & friends loved it! Dense but not heavy & evenly  moist.
Changes: 5 eggs, 1.5 cup buttermilk, 1/4 cup brandy, juice from real lemon & vanilla flavoring and Lemon Zest into the batter. processed lemon flavoring was too over powering to use.

This was so good!  I made it as an Easter dessert, and it fit the bill perfectly.  I didn’t have any lemon extract, so I used lemon juice and lemon zest in the batter. I will do that again in the future when I make it - easy, lemon-y, and no artificial lemon flavor.  I decorated the cake with some raspberries and it was lovely. I will definitely make this again -family and friends loved it.

This cake was delicious.  My only difficulty was that after 75 minutes, the toothpick still did not test clean.  I ended up baking the cake for 90 minutes, which was too long.  The cake wasn't dry, but probably should have been much more moist.  Next time I believe I will remove the cake after 75 minutes and see what happens.  I did follow other reviewers' suggestion of adding lemon zest to the batter, which really perked up the lemon flavor.  I also doubled the glaze, but probably didn't need to - I used plenty and had a lot left over, so I won't do that again.   And I agree with others:  having ingredients at room temperature is key!  I look forward to making this cake again.

Probably the best cake recipe I have! I made this for Easter and everyone loved it. Other than the zest, I followed the recipe as wriiten. I used 1 tbsp melted butter and 1 1/2 tbsp flour for greasing the pan (it came out smoothly with a golden crust). The cake was dense and moist. My husband who isn't a big sweet eater kept giving people dirty looks when they got some to eat. He was complaining  after they left that "they nearly ate it all"!! Definitely a keeper. Don't forget you can omit the lemon extract and make a plain cake or substitue say coconut or almond extract to change up the type of pound cake and/or frosting .

The dog and I really enjoyed this. I like lemon to begin with and the dog wants to eat what ever I'm eating . Didn't have buttermilk  so I had to sour some milk( with lemon juice). Didn't  have lemon zest either so I added a little lemon extract to the glaze. These must be very generous portions because  I halved the recipe and had more than 6 servings. When I make this again I will try to have lemons and buttermilk.

What a very nice cake. It has a tender crumb with a light lemmony flavor.  I will certainly make it again.

Best lemon pound cake ever! I  made it in a 9" tub cake and it took 85 minutes to cook. It tastes great. Will make it again in a 10" bundt cake pan to see the difference in appearance, tho I believe the taste will be great.

Really nice texture and taste.  Wish I would have read the reviews before I made it and added the lemon oil to the cake batter.  It really needed the glaze which was wonderful. Cake is a bit on the plain side but would make a great basic pound cake recipe the way it is.  Like with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

Delicious, did add a few things. I reduced the serving size to 8, so that I could use a loaf pan. Also, in addition to the lemon extract,  I added the juice and zest of 1 lemon and 1/2 cup of sour cream and the results were fantastic. A dense, but moist crumb and a wonderful lemony depth of flavor.  This one is definitely going in my family recipe box.

Very good cake everyone loved it. I put it in the oven for 60 minutes and the tooth pic did not come out clean. So I cooked another 15 as recommended but I think that was to long next time I will know. But very pleased for making a pound cake for the first time.
Thank you

I will put extra lemon into the cake batter next time. I made this with Silk cake flour which is very fine so I didn't have to sift it. The crumb was very moist and the cake did not crumble ...perfect! There was a good amount of glaze, it made a nice crunchy coating to the whole outside of the cake.  I also serve lemon cake with wedges of lemon to squeeze over it.

My son wanted a lemon cake for his birthday and I used this recipe. I made a tester and there have been few cake batters I've tasted that were better than this, though I nearly doubled the lemon extract, added some lemon juice, and decreased the sugar by about 1/2 a cup. And baked, it was exactly what he was hoping for. Dense, rich, buttery, zesty.

Easy to follow instructions. Lemony, like it should be. The tang of the butter milk is wonderful. This is. not a real sense pound cake.  The flavor is wonderful. Everyone who eats my lemon cake, made from this recipe, loves it.  Yum!!!

I didn't make any changes, and it was a lovely and tasty cake.  I do, however, use Adluh flour exclusively which makes for a taller, lighter cake.

I will definitely make this again. Although, I could not get the cake itself to taste very lemony, but doing a lemon glaze helped the lemon taste a lot. Despite that, I still really liked the cake taste and texture.

This is one of the best cakes I've ever made, and I bake a lot. Only change I made was to use regular milk instead of buttermilk, and frankly I don't think the buttermilk would make that much difference.  Using the fresh lemons gives this cake a wonderful fresh taste.

I'm rating this five stars, but, full disclosure skipped the glaze altogether.  I have been looking for a lemon cake that is not cloyingly sweet- and this is it

I served mine with fresh fruit and it was a hit
Will definitely make again

OH EM GEEE!!! This recipe is AMAZING! I didn't have lemon extract so I used lemon zest for the batter. Also, I used powdered buttermilk and mixed the powder with the flour mix.  My cake came out SUPER moist and the frosting is to die for! Made a double batch of icing so I could drench the cake in sweet goodness. This is my go-to pound cake from now on!

This is by far the best cake I have ever made. It has a light fluffy texture and a wonderful taste. I added one egg white to the icing to make it more liquid, and it  was great. This is absolutely amazing, thank you for this recipe!

I really like this recipe! If I had to describe the taste of the cake I would compare it to a Starbucks lemon pound cake. Next time I won't add the zest to the glaze since I felt it didn't do much flavor wise.

Made this cake according to the recipe. I did double the sauce as some suggested, but I'm not sure I needed to. My family (all time lemon-anything fans!) loved it and chose not to cake on the extra sauce. I've already shared this recipe w others and am looking forward to making it again soon.

This is delicious but I found it needed a little extra lemon extract in the cake batter. About a half teaspoon. The glaze was too tart for my taste. The second time I made this I used half milk and half lemon juice.

The only change I made is using soymilk with 1.5 tbsp of vinegar to make the buttermilk. This is an excellent pound cake with a lighter, crumby consistency. The amount of lemon flavor seems to be concentrated in the frosting and is lighter overall too. I thought the cake was going to overflow my bundt pan but it didn't.

I made this for a school function and everybody LOVED it. It was all gone within the first 20 minutes. I will make this cake again and recommend this to anybody who wants  lemony goodness dressed in silky icing with a beautiful flavor and look.

There is a reason this claims to be a "blue ribbon" recipe. It's a fantastic cake, but it's so rich I would prefer a lighter glaze. I will definitely be making this again (and perhaps tweaking the glaze topping recipe).

This recipe is outstanding! The only change I made was fresh lemon juice and zest from one lemon instead of lemon extract. My husband who doesn't like just plain pound cake said he loved this one and took a couple slices to work with him. Made strawberry shortcake with some of it and froze the rest for another time.

So yummy!  I followed the recipe as written but took the recommendation from others to make extra glaze. The cake remained moist for several days after I made it. My guests loved it and I enjoyed it with my morning coffee several days.

Easy cake to make.  I just substituted regular milk with a touch of vinegar in place of the buttermilk since I didn't have any.  Very moist, delicious taste.  I'll keep this recipe to make again.  Very good scratch recipe and very moist for a pound cake!  Great Job!!!

This is a great recipe! It turned out so moist and flavourful even though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I had to make my own buttermilk with milk, vinegar and lemon juice and didn't have any lemon extract so added a bit more lemon juice. Everyone loved it, definitely will make again. Thanks!

I made this for Easter and it was fantastic! The cake was moist and delicious. It seemed like a lot of glaze to me, but the glaze was also very good! Both had a great lemon flavor. We topped it off with lemon ice cream and fresh raspberries. Yum!! Will definitely make this again.

Wonderful texture to cake -  silky and moist.  I would add more lemon flavoring next time and some zest.  Most of the lemon flavor came from the glaze, which was fabulous!  I made 1 1/2 times the glaze and it was perfect!  Added a little vanilla to glaze too -  might add to cake as well next time.

Oh my god. Again read the reviews before making it. Turn out beautiful and "yummy??", my grandson doesn't indulge in sweets but, he couldn't stop eating it. I add a little hazelnut creamer to the glaze, delicious.

This cake was moist and slightly denser than regular cake, but not brick-like... I only had lemon oil and no lemon zest, so I substituted with the lemon oil and lemon juice. Mine needed more "bitey" lemon flavor in my opinion, but I think if I had lemon zest that would have taken care of it. The whole family and all of our guests (including kids) couldn't stop talking about how good it was and our friends asked me to make this cake for dinner at their house next week!

For ease of making I am giving it 4 stars, haven't tried it yet, taking it for dessert to a friend's house. Will give a taste review later, made no changes other then I didn't have quite enough zest to make a tablespoon and 1/4 cup lemon juice is plenty as I tasted the glaze, may even lessen it next time it was VERY lemony

The icing for this cake is hands down the very best.  It's sweet and tangy and completely makes this cake worth making and eating.  It's simply phenomenal.

The cake itself is good, but not very "lemony."  Had the cake been more "lemony," this cake would have been out of this world.  The next time I make it, I will be adding lemon zest to the cake batter.

This is a winner & now a family favourite. May be 'old-fashioned', but it's great flavour & texture are timeless. Made in a bundt pan because that's what we have it made no other changes. Family members ask us to make it for gatherings now.

This cake was of- the-hook delicious.  I made it with the powdered buttermilk, only because I am overseas and someone had it.  Otherwise I would have mixed lemon juice in milk.  I recommend this cake!  My motto:  provide a palate cleanser after eating a big meal ... this cake is the ideal palate cleanser!

I made this cake exactly how directed (with the only change is less white sugar in the batter as I always do due to personal preference) it was excellent!  Family & guest raved about it! This cake is a keeper!  Love, love, love it!!

Amaaaaaazing! The only thing i would change would be more lemon in the cake, less lemon in the glaze. The glaze was a bit over powering. Other than that, amazing cake! Has anyone tried this recipe with vanilla extract instead? We don't have buttermilk where i live, so i don't use it often. Vanilla and buttermilk, ok combo?

Yum!  Didn't have any lemon extract or zest, so used 2 Tbs of lemon juice in place of the extract, and omitted the zest in the glaze- turned out great!

Beautiful and delicious! I didn't have lemon extract so I  1T lemon zest in the cake instead and it turned out  great. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and doubled the glaze, I'm glad I did. Yum!

This was good, but a little dense for my taste.  It is very  heavy and a small sliver was plenty.  Everyone liked it.

Yes,it was my first pound cake!  I did add a teaspoon of varnilla extract and also a quarter cup of oil for moisture  because I made my own buttermilk. Lastly  2tablespoon of lemon zest to the batter to heighten  the lemon flavor it was delicious!

This recipe was awesome would do it again. Just the glaze was a little to sweet. I would add more lemon extract. But after all I loved it.

OMG!! this is the best lemon cake that I have ever made!! it's so delicious, it's really not that sweet or lemony, but the glaze is more of a tart and lemony glaze so they worked nicely together. I Loved this cake do much and is a great hit at parties and such. Whoever tried this, loves it! 5 stars!!

I made this  exactly as instructed. It is so delish!  I made it for my sons 19th birthday. He is not a fan of cakes so I thought something a little different than the traditional type. He loved it! Thank you for sharing. I would recommend this recipe to EVERYONE!  I did coat the pan in sugar instead of flour, the crust was sweet and crunchy!

I made this cake for my mother's 74th birthday and it was absolutely Devine. The only deviation I made from the recipe is the time it took to bake. It took my cake 1hr and 45 minutes at 325 degrees.

When I saw this recipe I decided to make it for the sponge in a lemon curd trifle. It worked very well. I made the pound cake the day before I needed the dessert. The next day I layered cubed pound cake with a home made lemon curd and fresh whipped cream. To add the lemon punch to whipped cream, add finely chopped lemon peel. It is very refreshing, makes serving easy, and makes a very large serving portion for a family dinner or BBQ.

I followed the recipe exactly and I loved it. Some people seemed to think the glaze was a little too tart (I disagree) so I may put a little less lemon juice next time. Beautiful big cake with perfect texture and moistness. I loved it and will make often. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it is a winner for sure.

This was an awesome pound cake!!  Great job!  Glaze was to die for!  Made it exactly how it said to.  I did however, make it in a 12" x 8" glass pan and glazed the entire top like a frosting!!!  Amazing!!! My friends loved it as well!!  Only suggestion I have is to serve at room temperature or else the cake portion is too hard and.  you loose some of the flavor of the pound cake.  Will definitely make again!! A++

Amazing. We all loved this cake. I made exactly as written, except I baked it in two loaf pans so that I could easily cut it into grab & go slices for my BBQ guests. This was a perfect dessert for our Memorial Day.

OMG!...My neighbor's (Mrs. Staley) pound cake has been my favorite since childhood. I've been experimenting with different pound cake recipes and my search is officially over!  I made this recipe for a co-worker's bridal party and I received so many rave reviews.  This cake is moist and rich and the lemon glaze takes it to another level.  Sarah, Thank you for sharing!

This cake was good with a nice density. I think I might have overcooked mine because I found it a little bit dry and the lemon flavor of the cake seemed to get lost in the baking. The lemon glaze made up for it though. But I'll give the recipe one more try as written.

This cake was really delicious!!  It was surprisingly not heavy.  I skipped the icing and sprinkled confectioners sugar on top and served it with blueberries and sliced strawberries.  This was a hit!!

Awesome. This recipe is now a family favorite. I add poppy seeds and get lots of requests to make this cake for birthdays.

This is a really incredible recipe. I made a half batch in a loaf pan, which needed the full 75 min in the oven. The only substitution I made was using buttermilk from powder because it's all I had on hand, and this turned out beautifully. It's the moistest pound cake I've ever eaten in my life. When I make it again, I'll add more lemon extract, because I want a stronger lemon flavor in the cake itself.

Loved this recipe. It was perfect as written. I added lemon zest to the batter just because. Can't wait to make this cake again.

By far, this is the best lemon pound cake I've ever made. I consider myself an advanced baker, and the caveat with any pound cake is to find one that isn't too dense, dry, and heavy. 

I made the cake according to the recipe with the *only* exception being that I used lemon emulsion in lieu of extract, and I also added some fresh lemon rind into the mix. 

This cake is very moist, flaky, and flavorful. Simply melts in the mouth. 

My family raved. This will remain a staple in my collection. 

Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is AMAZING! I had some difficulty with zesting my lemons so I actually ended up having to make some modifications. I used 1/2 cup whole milk soured with lemon juice, a little more than 1/2 cup of lemon juice and a lil extra sugar in the batter then A lil extra lemon juice in the glaze as well. The cake has the most divine texture-moist and dense, it's sweet with a hint of lemon. Then I doubled the glaze and it is perfectly tart and rich. I would definitely make this again! I'm even considering doing some modifications to make it a vanilla cake for my daughters birthday!

I've made many lemon cakes in search of the perfect one-- this is it! The only change I made was additional lemon zest in the batter. This recipie is so good I used it as a base to invent a strawberry pound cake with fresh strawberry puree and a little plain greek yogurt  in place of the buttermilk.

This was delicious!  After making it exactly as written the first time, I added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest to the cake batter the second time.  I also cut back on the sugar and doubled the glaze.  A keeper!

This just might be the most delicious and beautiful cake I have ever eaten! Dense, moist and oh so lemony.  I follow directions just as written and comes out perfect every time. I even bought a new bundt pan just for this cake! 
Versatile too. I've garnished with  raspberries, blueberries, apricots, my kumquat marmalade - each with their own flavored icing using this recipe.  Lots of compliments every time.  LOVE this recipe!

I made this for Easter, and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe   almost exactly and only made one addition--I added lemon zest to the cake batter.  TIP:  Make sure you use fresh lemon juice in the glaze as it does make a difference.  The cake pleased all my guests, even the ones who were disappointed I didn't make their favorite dessert.  It was so popular  I made it a week later for a dinner party, where it also received rave reviews.

I think this is an excellent recipe.  Don't make the mistake I did:  I didn't pour the icing over the warm cake and I think this would have made it the bomb!   It was good and the icing is amazing but I do love the very moist type of pound cake.  The glaze soaks in a warm cake.
I replaced 1 cup of butter with unsweetened applesauce.  Will make it again!

Delicious and super easy for a from-scratch cake. Only a few ingredients that you probably always have in the pantry. Bundt cakes always look nice. I cut recipe in half and made a small one so we wouldn't be eating it all week ;)

The glaze curdled and didn't look very appetizing.   Mine only needed 60 min at 325.  The cake doesn't have much lemon flavor - I would add lemon zest or lemon extract to the cake batter.
