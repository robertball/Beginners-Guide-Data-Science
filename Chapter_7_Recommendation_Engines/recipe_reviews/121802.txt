This pie is delicious!  The raspberry and meringue was very light, perfect for a summer day...just what I was looking for!  The crust was a little soggy, so next time I will probably bake it a little before hand.

I have always been a lover of meringue pies and finally have found a recipe that tastes almost exactly like my grandmother's! This is a wondrful pie, just like the ones I grew up eating. Everyone who was served a slice of this pie came for seconds and even picky eaters loved it! I would very highly recommend this recipe! Thank you, Mrs. Anton Sohrwide!

This was really good! Very light and tasty! It did run a bit though, and more the next day, but even so it tasted great.

We love meringue and had extra raspberries so we thought this would be perfect.  I made a mistake in using a dish larger than called for (I used a 10 inch pie pan).  Because of this the crust and meringue were stretched to thin.  Be sure to use a 9 inch pie pan! Still it had a great taste and we enjoyed it. The crust becomes like a shortbread due to the juice of the raspberries. It is very light so if you have big eaters best to serve a more filling pie.  This would be great for a ladies lunch.

Everyone enjoyed this. Great combination of sweet meringue/tart berries. The crust reminded us of a shortcake/sweet soft biscuit that does get a little soggy but I believe this is due to the berry juice, still delicious. The meringue began to "run" almost immediately upon cooling down and it also collapsed fairly quickly so I found it best to plan on serving this the same day it is baked. I only had a 10" pan available today so I decided to 1 1/2 all of the ingredients. This worked fine and gave us a taller pie and thicker crust, which was great. Thanks for sharing.

This was very good . Not overly sweet, it was perfect to showcase the fresh raspberries. Serve with ice cream or whipped cream. It was awesome and easy to make.

I don't know what I did wrong but my pastry crust didn't seem to work out and the topping seemed to ooze into the pastry. It turned into a nice strawberry shortcake-like dessert though and was still super tasty, so I will try making it again.

Awesome way to use raspberries.  The filling is light, sweet with the meringue and tart with the raspberries.  The crust is the perfect combination and I will probably save the crust recipe to use in different recipes as well.  We will be enjoying this tonight after dinner - Thanks!

This is really more like a cake than a pie.  The crust fills most of the pan, and the topping is a thin layer on top.  Mine, too, sank a bit, but it didn't affect the taste or appearance that much.  I think it is best served the same day it's made.  Next time I might add even more raspberries.  My guests all liked it; it just wasn't quite what I expected from a "pie."
