These were excellent... as close to a yeast dough recipe as you can get without using yeast. I did find the butter/sugar in the tins got more crispy-carmelized than get syrupy-gooey (which was fine by me!)... but if you wanted it gooey, you could set aside half the mixture for the roll filling, and then add some melted butter to the rest of it until it was more syrupy than pasty in consistancy. Note: either way, remove from pan while still warm, else bring a chisel!

Oh, my.  These are incredible!  I made them almost as is with a couple of modifications.  I couldn't find my raisins, so I used craisins, and converted the icing to a cream cheese icing by adding 2-3 tablespoons cream cheese, an extra tablespoon of milk, and a couple of tablespoons of butter.  FANTASTIC.  Tasted like the Hardee's biscuit cinnamon rolls.  I gave them a 10, my husband gave them a 7 (he prefers the cinnabon type yeast roll).  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe surprised me- at first when I saw they were non-yeast rolls I thought for sure
the cinnamon rolls wouldn't be that great, but I wanted fresh cinnamon rolls in a "jiffy", so I tried the recipe. It turned
out GREAT! They were delicious and just as good as yeast rolls. However, I added more cinnamon mixture to make the buns "gooier".Mmmm...

I can only give this recipe a two because the taste wasn't awful. But everything else about this recipe is less than desirable. I won't make it again but I do have some helpful hints for those who will try it.  First, as everyone else stated the dough is extremely sticky so make sure to flour your hands and also put a little extra on the dough when you begin to roll it out.  Second, make sure that you trim the dough to be a perfect retangle as it will aid in the helping the final product look normal.  Third, don't waste time spooning 1 tsp of the brown sugar mixture into the pans.  Instead, after cutting the cinnamon rolls dip each roll into the sugar and then place in the muffin pans.  It's much easier this way.  Also, after 18 minutes check them, they won't need 20-25 minutes unless your oven runs cold.  And lastly, do not use the recommended amounts for the icing.  You'll have to wing it by placing the confectioners sugar in a bowl and adding tsp's not tablesoons of milk until you get a creamy glaze.  I hope this helps anyone else who chooses to make these but I would highly recommend taking the time to prepare them the RIGHT WAY!

I loved these!! The only draw back is that you need extra cinnamon/sugar mixture, almost three times as much as asked, and only then that they are gooey and finger-linking good!

this recipe is good for a quick treat. It is good to have these kinds of recipes on hand for a last minute need. Everyone needs a little sweet something once in a while.

Great alternative to traditional cinnamon rolls made with yeast! Light, fluffy, and moist with a delicate cinnamon sugar flavor - great for when you don't have the time to spend hours waiting for yeast to rise. I doubled the glaze and added a cream cheese to it for a little something extra special. Be sure to watch these during baking...I almost overbaked mine and wished I'd taken them out a little sooner. I would definitely make these again due to the ease of prep and the outcome.

These were so easy to put together!  I thought they were a really good substitute for yeast cinnamon rolls when you're in a hurry.  Keep an eye on 'em, though!  I accidentally let them cook a few minutes too long and had a hard time getting them out of the pan.

Wonderful!  I never have yeast on hand so this was just what I was looking for!  I didn't use muffin tins since I can't find em LOL I put these in a 9x13 glass cake pan.  And had to sub 1/2 the br. sugar for regular since thats all I had.  Put a thin layer of the br.sugar butter mixture in the bottom of the pan after spraying with cooking spray.  Put cinn rolls on there.  I rolled mine out a little thin because I came out with 16 with 2 end pieces, but put all in the 9x13 pan.  I thought they were going to stay small but they expanded very nicely filling the entire cake pan!  I had to bake about 25-27 mins.  I inverted them onto a baking sheet right away.  And just to get rid of some frosting in the fridge, I made a quick glaze and poured on top.  Very delicious! Thanks again for the recipe!

This is a good recipe for quick cinnamon rolls, but since there's no yeast they don't rise, so they're kind of flat. Theyt're very sweet. We doubled the topping and it was good the first time, but the second time we made them they were too sweet. Much quicker than the real thing, but not as yummy. Although good for a last minute breakfast.

YUMMY. Not like yeast rolls, but very good and cakey. Just dont overcook these or they get dry fast. I doubled the cinnamon mixture...BAD IDEA! They come out very crunchy and not gooey as the sugar wont dissolve. Doubling the icing was a good idea tho. MY MOM ATE FOUR!!

Both my husband and I thought these were good taken on their own merits, but they're not the yeast kind. I'll keep the recipe for those times when we want something quick, though.

I love these rolls, I have made them in the past and was delighted to find this recipe again.

One thing I do however, is not a muffin tin but a glass pan and make a caramel sauce out of the extra mixture... and added cocoa to the mixture for the bottom of the pan. WOW. Awesomel!

Caramel sauce - Melt 1/4 cup butter with about 2/3 cup of brown sugar, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg(my spices of choice). Slow boil and mix for about 5 mins. Remove from heat and add 1/4 cup of milk mixing in well. Mix continuously for 2-3 mins and then add 2 tsp of pure cocoa. Mix vigorously and taste. Add more coco if desired.

I loved these!  They're perfect for someone like me who doesn't have the patience for yeast.  I don't have a muffin pan, so instead I lined the rolls up about 1cm apart in a glass baking pan and they turned out great.  I just made sure to seal the loose end of the roll well so that they wouldn't unravel while baking.  I removed them from the pan immediately upon taking them out of the oven so they wouldn't stick when the cinnamon filling hardens (as other reviewers noted).  I skipped the currants and the icing -- I found them sweet enough without.  These aren't your traditional doughy, fluffy cinnamon rolls made with yeast, and they get stale by the next day, but what can I say...only 15 mins prep (with practice!) and 15 mins in the oven.  Really great way to satisfy my craving right away!  I will be making them often, thanks for sharing!

These have been a family favourite of ours for years! (Although the recipe was given to us by a family member.) We use only 1/4 tsp of salt however and we always use raisins.  We also add more cinnamon.  Contrary to a previous  reviewer, we often need less of the topping mixture, definitely NOT more. We rarely add the glaze as they are sweet enough and yummy enough already. I have never needed to grease the muffin tins.

These are very good. I didn't have any yeast on hand, and was glad to find this recipe. My oven bakes hot so I turned down the temp. by 25 degrees, and watched them every 10 minutes. They were done perfectly in 22 minutes. A bit sweet for me, so one did the trick. :-)

Thank you Carol ! Your recipe is fabulous. It takes me a bit longer to make them than it does you, usually just over an hour to eating them. If you go to the bakery and save 15 minutes, you lose the aroma in your house, the kids getting to help ( it's that simple ), and the anticipation factor of the wait while they're cooking. Plus they're HOT and FRESH...

Those are amazing!!! I have made them 4 times, and around 7 people have copied and photocopied the recipe (my printer is out of order). I also had to translate it to French (I live in Quebec). It is a big winner, very easy and VERY tasty!!!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe.  I knew it was basically a biscuit dough I was making so I wasn't too sure I would do a good job - that said, these turned out great!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and I give it a 5 star as written.  I would definitely make these again.  Its easy to devour more than one!

Let me just say - WOW!!!  Well worth "it"... The recipe itself was quick and simple, but not in my house.  Ok, so I start with no yeast in the house... that required an initial 20 minutes looking for a cinnamon roll recipe that does not call for YEAST. (Thank you, Carol!)  Then I couldn't find the muffing pans (still packed from moving a few months back)...  I still followed the directions, but placed them into a loaf pan after sprinkling the bottom with the brown sugar/butter/cinnamon mix,this will create the most magnificant and slighty crispy carmalized crust.  Baked for 40 minutes.  If you use a loaf pan, be sure to flip over onto a plate before cooling.  I skipped the currants and used the cream cheese frosting from  "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe.  It took 5 boys all of 10 minutes to divour!

These are really good, quick cinnamon rolls. Though, I followed the directions exactly and my dough was really soft - way too soft to roll out. Maybe because I used nonfat milk? Not sure. Anyway, I stirred in more flour (about 1/2 c) before kneading, and then the dough was perfect! The filling seemed to be the right amount - I was worried there wouldn't be enough, but it was perfect. Definitely remove these from the pan as soon as you take them out of the oven; I could see how they would stick if you let them sit in the pan too long. Excellent recipe - thank you!

The good reviews made me want to try this recipe although I wasn't convinced until I ate one.    These are very good and extremely simple to prepare.    If you crave a cinnamon roll but don't want all the work a yeast one takes, this is the one to try

As I was making these, I was thinking to myself - there was no way that these were going to be as good as the usual yeast cinnamon rolls that I prepare.  Almost everyone in the family said they were even BETTER!  I did modify and make these in an 8X8 pan, but would make them as directed next time.  They kind of stuck together, making it a little difficult to remove them from the pan in one piece, but that was totally my fault.  The cinnamon mixture at the bottom gets all gooey and the filling is perfect.  As easy as these were to make, I know that this will be a recipe that I will soon have memorized from making so often!

Very yummy and easy to make! It is a nice "quick" easy way to have "homemade" cinnamon rolls. I did add an extra 1/2 cup of flour to make the dough form better. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee. Enjoy!

I wish I could give these more stars!  The ease of the recipe is perfect.  I made at 10pm last night when I saw this recipe on the Daily Recipes list, and it took me less than 15 minutes.  I took another reviewer's advice and shredded my (very cold) butter to make cutting it into the flour mixture easier.  (From now on, I will do this any time I need to cut in butter.)  I already had cinnamon sugar mixed up, so I just melted 1/4 cup of butter (not the 1/3 cup listed in the recipe), brushed it on the rolled out dough and then sprinkled the cinnamon sugar.  This worked really well and I saved calories because I didn't even use it all!  Just a wonderful tasting cinnamon roll that my kids and husband loved!

thank you soooo much!!! They were a big hit when I made them for my mother and father's 50th wedding anniversary. They were all gone in the first half and hour! Thank goodness I had made another pan for myself.

These are good, but by no means compare with cinnamon rolls made with yeast.  These are great if you are in a hurry, but aren't close the the "real thing".

Omg! Soooo good! Very tasty. I've made cinnamon rolls once before and they were sticky cinnamon rolls with lots of sugar. These ones were less in sugar but tasted great. I made a slight change though. I lowered the sugar to 1/4 - 1/3 cup in the filling and added more sugar about 1-4-1/3 cup to the real batter. Also I halved the batter and made the rolls still into 12 rolls but just made them thinner. It's a good portion. Great change. Super tasty too.

These are soooo good!
this recipe is amazing and so easy to make.
I served if for breakfast for family and friend and they absolutely loved them. I made the rolls the night before and used a stoneware baking pan. I baked in the morning just before our guests came.It is very important to turn them out of the pan as soon as you take them out of the oven.
I followed the recipe as written but did not use currents and i did add a bit of vanilla to the milk before I added to the flour.
The rolls were moist and soft even the next day.The recipe is perfect and one I will keep making.I forgot the drizzle but was not needed.
yummy,yummy,yummy!

These cinnamon rolls were easy and the kids loved them.  Thank you for a recipe that doesn't involve yeast!  When cooked in a circular pan, the rolls come out nice and gooey.  We didn't bother with the icing; when the rolls were heated up for breakfast, they were delicious without the extra sugar.

These were okay and taste more like cinnamon rolls the next morning. I made them Christmas Morning and would honestly rather eat pre-made cinnamon rolls. I think I overloaded each the muffin pan and they rose too much. (so it wasn't worth all the effort) Next time, I'll go with a cinnamon swirl muffin recipe. Still, they were very good.

YUMMMMM! I made a few small changes. Placed them in a ceramic quiche dish, for lack of other pan avail, I had made in the Muffin Pan previously, but did not like the outcome, Pan had to soak for two days to get sticky sugar cinnamon mixture off bottom of cups. But these are GREAT when baked in a big round baking dish, low sided, such as the quiche or a 9" cake pan. I drizzled melted butter on the bottom of pan, placed cut rolls then lightly pressed them down, added the brown sugar minture on top as instructed, the when out of oven brushed melted butter on each one if they looked dry, just a tad for added moistness. I did not ice them, my kids do not like icing, but I kept a bowl on the side for the others eating these yummy rolls so they could ice to their hearts content. I will definatly make again and again!

All i could taste was baking soda.  The brown sugar burned on the bottom. i had to use SO MUCH frosting to cover up the bad taste. not something i will make again. also, i had to add about two more cups of flour too.no idea how it earned the high ratings.

I used a biscuit mix instead of all the mess of going from scratch but used the topping in this recipe. They definitely don't need icing. Great!

These are quick, easy and very tasty. They're not as gooey as Cinnabon but delicious nevertheless and that suits me just fine. Raisens work just as well as currents and you might want to add some pecans just  because pecans go well with any cinnamon roll recipe.

I followed the recipe and it was good. Next time i think i will allow the dough to chill in the fridge for a little to make cutting easier and to help maintain it's circular shape cause mine came out weird looking. :)

Good recipe. I thought the icing could have been thicker.  Hubby and I liked, but kids prefer the store bought brand better.  Definitely take out of the pan immediately.  Would be great with nuts mixed in as well.

This is a super delicious cinnamon roll! IT created a crusty top with a syrup in the bottom. I've already had 2 myself including my mom.  Mine came out fluffy. NOt bread consistency but it was still good. What I did was I shredded my butter and stuck t into the freezer for about 5 mins before adding it into the dough. After I whisked the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar together, I just dumped in the butter and made sure it was spread evenly into the dough. Then I mixed in the milk and kneaded the dough as stated in the recipe.  As for the filling, I only mixed the sugar and cinnamon together. Again, I shredded the butter and laid it evenly onto the flattened dough. then I just sprinkled the sugar/ cinnamon mixture. As for the dropping of a tespoon of the mixture into a muffin pan, it's not nesessary since the filling just melted into the bottom of the rolls and that created the syrup for the bottom. I got 1 tablespoon and 1/4 cinnamon but I highly reccomend adding another teaspoon to get that cinnamony taste.  This doesn't rly need a glaze on top since the rolls are savory enough without the glaze. :D happy eating

Excellent, quick cinnamon rolls! Absolutely loved them! Only thing I would do differently is try to make the icing a bit more visible and tasted. Other than that -  great!

Yummy!These are my favourite type of cinnamon rolls - not a fan of the yeast type. These are just like ones I grew up on and adore to this day. I made a few minor modifications to suit my needs, and they came out great!!

One thing I tried: for the filling I melted the butter, sugar and cinnamon together and then spread that delicious gooey-ness on the dough. It worked really well. I attempted this because I often fund the filling can be too "granular" if you know what I mean. I also made them on a flat baking sheet rather than in muffin tins (just my preference).

Overall a great recipe that I will be using again for sure.

We love fresh cinnamon rolls out of the oven and I don't have a bread maker or the patience for making dough from scratch....  that is why I love this recipe. I had unsuccessfully made this recipe in the past.  The first few times I doubled the fill and didn't put the cut rolls in muffin tins - I put them side by side in a baking dish.  Once cooked I would drizzle the icing sugar over the rolls while they were still warm and still in the pan.  Each time I cooked the rolls this way they were a mushy mess.  THIS TIME I cooked in muffin tins and didn't double the fill.  HOWEVER, I agree with others: I slowly added the milk as needed because the amount called for is too much. AND TAKE ROLLS OUT OF MUFFIN TIN ASAP TO COOL ON WIRE RACK, if not the rolls are too hard to get out of pan. We prefer a thick icing and I poured the thick icing over the almost cool rolls on the wire rack (I put wax paper under the rack to catch the dripping sticky cinnamon fill and icing suger).  THEY WERE DELICIOUS!!!

I love this recipe!! I double the filling and instead of rolling the dough out and making buns, I also added about 1/4 cup more flour and I use a 8x8 or 9x9 (or my heart cake pan) and make little balls about the size of a quarter and layer the bottom, put some filling on the top, then layer some more and put more filling on top and keep that up until all the dough is done, then spread the remaining filling on top (you may not use it all).  I love it this way so you can just have a bite if you want or you can have a bowl full! =)

This is a terrible recipie.  Equal parts sugar and flour will NEVER make a 'soft dough'.  Theres simply not enough gluten content to make it stick together.  I ended up with a sloppy mess that wouldn't roll even when refridgerated.  Cranck it down to 3/4-1c sugar to 2c flour and it works marvoulsly.  But really if you want to make cinnamon rolls (or any dough) just go buy some yeast!

I loved this recipe! I didn't use currants in it and I didn't have raisins so I just skipped that and they turned out great! I prefer yeast dough but I often don't have time to make it as I am often running around and can't wait for it to rise. I also didn't drop any mixture into the muffin tin before (I just used it all to roll up in the dough). Instead, I greased my muffin tin with butter - they came out like a dream! All in all, very great recipe! I will be using this one for a long time!

Taste was good but had to modify the recipe as the dough was way too sticky and had to knead in another cup of flour to make it workable.  Then the glaze was way to thin and doubled the powdered sugar to make it thin but not watery.

We have made this recipe twice.  The results were delicious both times.  However, the taste was improved the second time by the following procedural changes:  When dough is rolled out into a rectangle - 1.  Spread soft butter evenly over dough  2.  Sprinkle cinnamon generously (didn't bother to measure) for a nice light coating  3. Sprinkle brown sugar over cinnamon (didn't measure).  Proceed with directions except do no put any brown sugar mixture in the muffin tin bottom because it makes extraction extremely difficult and frustrating.  
Great quick recipe when you don't have the time for a yeast cinnamon roll.  Taste very similar.

Tried to use it this morning and after following the recipe and blending everything perfectly I ended up with an unmanageable puddle of gooey dough that after adding 3 cups of flour to still could not be worked as a pastry dough. the filling was fine but the dough recipe has too much milk in it in my opinion. start with WAY LESS and work up to a cup if need be.

Very easy to make.  I doubled the cinnamon/sugar mixture but will not in the future, as it is not necessary in my opinion.  I used two nine-inch round cake pans in lieu of muffin tins.  In the future, I will not put part of the cinnamon mixture in the bottom of the pan, as the recipe states, as I made one pan without and preferred it over the pan that had the mixture in the bottom.  I did not use the glaze and did not feel the need, as these are plenty sweet for us.  Leftovers the next day were still very good.  Great recipe that I plan to use again.  Thanks for sharing!

These work in a pinch w/o waiting for a yeast dough but lack the general "gooiness" of the yeast breads.

Absolutey perfect for those times when you've just gotta have a cinnamon roll. These are great when you don't want to bother with yeast and don't have time to let things rise.  They do have a sort of biscuit taste but if you garnish it right that flavor goes away. :)  These do get hard after a few hours, so make sure you eat them up while they're fresh!

These are fabulous!  I loved them but my husband preferred yeast rolls.  They are more like a pastry than bread.  Very quick and easy to throw together even at the last minute.  I left out the raisins and I skipped the frosting. They didn't need either one.

I ended up using self rising flour because i didnt have enough all purpose to make the cinnamon rolls and a french bread. I omited the salt and baking powder because of this... i added a bit more butter to the mix with the cinnamon and sugar because i was kinda worried it would come out dry after reading the reviews... Thanks again for the recipe it was A LOT quicker than using yeast... a different taste also but VERY enjoyable. TY.

This recipe doesn't taste exactly like the traditional yeast-based cinnamon rolls, but in a country where I can't just go to the local cinnabon, these were a quick and easy fix for my cinnamon roll cravings! Although this recipe was a good start, I made the following changes: For the dough I used 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/4, reduced the milk to just over half a cup, and added 2 tbs of vanilla. I put ALL of the cinnamon filling inside the rolls, and also omitted the raisins/currants.  I didn't bake them in muffin tins, but instead put them in two 9" cake pans, about a quarter inch apart. They only needed 17 minutes to turn golden brown. My fiance ate the whole pan, with and without the glaze. Thank you for a taste of home!

These were very good.  I used bread flour instead of all-purpose; also placed all the cinnamon/brown sugar/butter mixture on the dough instead of putting some in the pan.  I baked mine in a nonstick 9x13 pan (sprayed with Pam) and they came out beautifully.  Glazed with cream cheese frosting mentioned in the "90 Minute Cinnamon Roll" recipe on this site.  See my picture.  Sooooooo yummy!!

I have been searching for a cinnamon roll recipe without yeast. I am simply not patient enough... This was delicious!! I did not put it in the muffin tins or use raisins (or currants) like the recipe says to. I used all the cinnamon mixture in the dough then I put them in a glass cake pan, sides touching. They turned out wonderful. My kids say they are the best cinnamon rolls ever!!

Easy to make, and very tasty. I used raisins instead of currants, and I added some vanilla and extra powdered sugar to the icing. 

Next time, I think I'll put less of the brown sugar/cinnamon mix on the bottom of the pan, and more of it in the middle of the roll. Overall, they were good!

Perfect. Cinnamon rolls done with a tea biscuit base are a maritime tredition. My husband always complains that he prefers them to the yeast ones I always make.These turned out really good. Had to knead in a little flour but any bread recipe calls for altering flour amounts due to flour moisture, weather, or altitude. I didn't make the glaze as they were really good without it. My two preschoolers "helped" and they stii turned out great.

Yummy! My mum and dad loved these, and they have high standards when it comes to food! I only put a couple drops of icing on each though, since the recipe seemed like it was going to be very sweet. I cut down the sugar for the cinnamon paste, too. The only thing that I didn't like about this recipe was that the top of the cinnamon bun would be delicious and the bottom of it had pretty much no flavour at all. I htink next time I'll put less than a tsp of cinnamon paste into the pan and more into the roll.

Since they're no-rise, these are a little biscuty in texture.  I tend to like my cinnamon rolls more gooey, but everyone at work raved about them.  I'm sure I'll make them again; quick and easy.  I used a thinned cream cheese frosting on them and they turned out looking really nice too.

I use three quarter c. of milk and add more only if needed, otherwise the dough is too sticky to roll.  I don't drop any filling into the muffin cups, but spread it all on the dough.  My kids like these plain so we never bother with a glaze.

This recipe is a keeper for my family.  The first time I made this recipe, I followed it to the T.  They were wonderful and looked so perfect.  The second time I increased the filling amount left out the currants and added chopped pecans.  I also did not put the teaspoon of filling in the bottom of the pan.  Don't see the need.  I played around with the glaze because the first time it was too thin.  I also tried this dough as biscuits and we were very pleased.  I rolled out the dough and cut out the biscuits with a glass and baked. I brushed the tops with butter after baking and they were yummy.

I'm a big fan of cinnimon rolls and this was my first time making them. i think the real reason i made these was because they had no yeast in them. to tell u the truth, any recipes with yeast scare me! i made half of them with the sugar glaze and the other half with cream cheese frosting. thanx carol for this wonderful recipe!!!

Quick and delicious!!! Super easy to make and used simple ingredients you often have on hand. Icing was slightly lacking. I prefer a cream cheese frosting to accompany cinnamon rolls. But the roll it's self was great! Dough was moist and yummy! Filling was great too! Good good good!

I added more flour to the dough because it was a bit too sticky to roll out (I have a hard time rolling out any dough) and it turned out like pie crust and it was DELICIOUS. This is now my go to recipe when I'm craving something sweet.

Makes a great soup. I did use well cooked russet potatoes to thicken and red for the chunks. I also added a Colombian herb called Guascas. Got rave reviews.

I have tried and tried again to make or buy decent gluten free cinnamon rolls, and I had yet to find a recipe that worked, until now!!!  I was able to make substitutions for the flour, butter, and milk to make them allergy free for our family, and they still came out delicious!  I used parchment paper to roll out the dough because it was a bit sticky without the gluten, but the final product was fantastic.  I could have eaten the whole pan.

Surprisingly good not to have yeast.  There is not much difference.  The cook time was off for my oven, so next time (and there WILL be a next time) I'll lower the temp and shorten the cook time to avoid them being slightly overdone and the hard sugar at the bottom.  It's a keeper!

The dough was way to sticky and hard to manage when rolling it up. I would probably not use this recipe again. But the brown sugar mix was really good, gave it a carmely good flavor to it.

My 12 year old son wanted cinnamon rolls for breakfast and I found this recipe. It was perfect for my little guy to make! He made these with out fruit and he used buttermilk instead of regular milk. He changes recipes to his liking and these were awesome! He made cream cheese frosting for the top! He woke everybody in the house up to try these!

My family loved them! I did not put any cinnamon mix in the bottom of the cups. I spread the entire amount in the dough and rolled it in. Instead of using a muffin pan I squished all of them together in a 9in pie pan.

I read the directions wrong and put all the filling in the bottom of the muffin tins so then I just melted some butter and brushed it on the dough and sprinkled my own cinnamon/sugar mix over that - turned out great! Didn't have any problem with the topping sticking in the pan. I think I will try adding chopped pecans in it next time, I didn't put the currents in. Thanks for the recipe!

The dough in this recipe is soft and light. I also love how quickly it all comes together.
If you want healthy food look elswhere. This is good comfort food for the rest of us. Why do people rate recipes they never use.

Oh my! So easy and delicious. I was looking for a yeast-free recipe and came across this little gem. As per one of thew reviews I read, did not put anything in the bottom of the muffin tin (except I did grease with butter). I spread about 2 tablespoons soft butter, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, and only 1/2 cup of brown sugar. This was plenty, trust me. I baked for 19 minutes and they were soft and yummy. My son loved them!! ALSO: for those who are putting this down because they didn't like the texture or flavor, of course it will be different than a yeast roll. This is a QUICK BREAD... it's going to be different.

Fantastic Christmas breakfast treat.  It made a giant mess in my oven, but it was totally worth it.  I think I used too much milk so the dough was too sticky and didn't "fall" deep enough into the cups, causing the butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture to overflow and run all over.  But this made the mixture caramelize into deliciousness, and it's all going to end up in the same place anyway, so who cares what it looks like?  A+++

I made this recipe to the t.  The dough turned out more like batter.  It was very hard to deal with.  The taste was very good but i think i would have to figure out some modifications because i liked the taste just not consistantcy.

I tried doubling the cinnamon, brown sugar and butter mixture after reading other reviews here but found it to make more of a mess in the muffin pans than improving the overall quality. I will try next time by following the original recipe or cutting back to 1 1/2 times the recipe They were still devoured by my family. I had my wife take the remaining rolls to work so we wouldn't be tempted to wolf them all down. She said her co-workers all raved about them, so I can easy give them my stamp of approval and the recipe was also very easy to follow.

I made these for my family when we wanted cinnamon rolls, but we didn't want to make some that took forever.These were as good as a batch with yeast, but they were a lot faster. "They were the best" and "I loved them" were some of the many comments

These remind me of the ones my Mom used to make when I was younger. She would use recipe on the side of the Jiffy baking mix box. But these are Much, Much better!! I made them the night before as I didn't have much time in the morning and they turned out wonderful!! Even my picky hubby LOVED them!! I made cream cheese frosting as I do always, for everything. I didn't read ANY reviews, I like to make the recipe the way it is first. I would make these again, but I would add milk a little at a time, a the dough got REALLY sticky. But still Loved them!!

This definitely delivers fast, great cinnamon rolls. I never think about these the night before, so baking powder recipe is ideal. I actually like these better than yeast dough rolls - these come out cakey, crumbly. And I love the ease of making these in a muffin/cupcake pan

Fabulous cinnamon roll for a yeast-free bread.  We also double the caramel, put that in the bottom of a 9x13 pan and then arrange the rolls on top.  Yummy!

This recipe is fantastic! This is a quick and easy recipe for something sweet. Just a note: I added raisins and chopped pecans inside the cinnamon roll. I also added butter to the icing. It kind of tastes like Cinnabon that way.

I used all margarine instead of butter for the dough and margarine for the cinnamon swirl and it was very tasty. The dough was a little odd though - I measured everything exactly (both wet and dry ingredients) and when I mixed the dough it was very goopy. I added another 3/4-1 cup of flour to get it to hold together. Other than that, I have no complaints - these were DELICIOUS!

Definitely my favorite treat when friends and family are around.  Normally I love sweetness, but I have been leaving the frosting on the side on it's been left off by the majority.
I also get bored when I bake the same thing a lot (which I have been doing with this one) so I changed it up by adding golden raisins and dried apricots.
My boyfriend added his own thing by kneading it twice as long, then rolling it out to size, brushing melted butter on it, folding it in half and repeating a few times. The best part about this, other than the yummy, flakier layers, is that it rolls out into more of a perfect rectangle, so the rolls are just a little more even.

def. wont make these again. i tried 2 find a recipe that didnt require yeast 'cause i didnt have it, but ive learned that i def. need to stick w/ something that calls for yeast 'cause they def. werent good. they were the worst batch of anything i ever made-aside from a brownie recipe that failed a few yr.s ago. they were hard, & not fluffy as i expected. & one of the biggest mistakes i made was putting the cinnamon in the tins underneath the rolls like it called for-nothing but a big gross chunky mess. huge disappointment. (& here i thot it was about to be one of my best creations(i luv cinnamon buns & eating 'em w/ my fingers))

These were just okay. To me, they tasted like a biscuit with frosting. Yeast rolls are well worth the time and effort.

I made this cinnamon roll recipe this morning after my son begged for some.  I didn't have time to make yeast ones so I thought I would try these.  I made a few modifications:  I fiddled with the amount of flour and milk to get the right textured dough, I omitted the currants, and I added 2 tsp of vanilla.  My family loved them.  The dough was like a fluffy biscquit which we really liked.  I would have given the recipe a 5 star had I not needed to tweak the measurments of flour and milk.

VERY quick and easy way to get DELICIOUS cinnamon buns. only modifications i made was i made a 'glaze' that also called for butter and vanilla. watch these because they should only take about 16-18 minutes to bake.
i will definitely be making these again.

For what these were, they aren't bad. Do not make these if you're looking for the texture of a REAL cinnamon roll, cause these are just cinnamon sugar biscuits. They're quick, and they taste pretty good, but they're only good for me to be made in a pinch. I didn't have to add any extra flour to my dough, but I did cut down on the milk and only use 1/2 cup.

I wanted cinnamon rolls, but did not have any yeast. Instead of a run to the store I tried these. They were tasty but can not be compared to a cinnamon roll made using yeast. In a bind these were perfect. Thank you

i made this "cinnamon roll" this morning, and it was defiantly a sweetened biscuit. the taste was alright, but the dough for this is exactly like JP's Big Daddy biscuits. this just isn't like a regular cinnamon roll.

So so so so so so good! I'm used to making cinnamon rolls with yeast. But yeast rarely seems to work for me, so these were perfect. My husband and I live at his parent's place in their basement suite, and even his picky family liked them.....woohoo!! These will definitely be made time and time again!!

Not even close to the result being worth the effort. Next time I'll use pre-made, they are easier and taste MUCH better.

these cinnamon rolls were good, but I cooked mine for 20 minutes and they came out a little crispy.  I'd recomend cooking them for about 17 minutes or so.

These were great!! With all the Christmas eve cooking and baking, I had no time to make yeast-dough recipe I planned. I woke up on Christmas morning and whipped these up in no time.They were comparable in texture to the pilsbury ones we always buy, but better since I made them from scratch!

I hate giving bad ratings, but these were horrible!  I made these as a surprise for my boyfriend one morning, but they ended up a disaster.  The recipe called for way too much filling which overflowed while baking and dirtied my oven.  When they cooled, they were hard as rocks because of all the sugar and the bread wasn't sweet but bland with a subtle hint of salt.  We each had a stomach ache all day because of these.

I woke up one saturday morning and decided to treat my roommates- but being a college student, our "mornings" are short and I needed something quick.  Well, my pickiest roommate just asked for seconds! 
I like that they are separated in the muffin pan easy and no "cheating" when someone cuts themselves a roll!

I made a different icing with splenda, a little butter, milk and vanilla (no measurements, just eyeballing it, sorry!)
a definite keeper!

This was a fabulous recipe, the rolls were soft and tasty.  In response to the review by Rage007 the sugar called for in this recipe (for the dough portion) was 2 tablespoons not 2 cups.  No wonder the recipe didn't work out for you.  I will be making these again and again and again.

This was yummy!  I replaced half a cup of flour with vanilla instant pudding, and was very liberal with the flour when kneading and rolling out.  These turned out beautifully.

4 out of 5 stars because the dough was very, very sticky.  Had to add tons more flour, but despite that-they tasted great! (still no floury taste at all!)
Great fast recipe.  Lots of dishes to do, though.
:(

Thanks for a keeper!

I make this for my daycare kids and they love  it! The only thing different I did was, I rolled out the dough, spread butter over it, then took the brown sugar mix and spread it over the dough. Rolled it up, refridgerated it over night, cut it up the next morning and baked it. Very good.

I just tried these this morning and for the first try they were pretty awesome.  I usually follow recipe exactly the first time to see what I really want to tweak, but this time I followed a couple suggestions. For myself, I used whole wheat flour the first time so I'd never know the difference, pretty dang good there. (one excuse to allow these on school mornings.)  I didn't mess with the currants, raisins, etc. although a sprinkling of chopped nuts might be nice the next time.  

Dough was very sticky as almost all the others have said; I didn't add flour to the dough but floured the work surface heavily and kept "flouring" my hands as I went; so in the end it probably amounted to the same thing. 

Other reviewers are correct it doesn't take 20-25 min; I pulled them out at 18 min. and that was a close one, 16 min. would've been fine. 

The cinnamon brown sugar on top was DIVINE; but as one other reviewer suggested, pop them out of the tray immediately; don't even wait a minute- and eat while warm...the "crust" was chewy and amazing. 

Finally our personal preference was a thick glaze of icing covering the top (my daughter wants nothing to do with drizzling...the girl likes her icing.) I added vanilla to deepen the icing flavor a little.  

One thing I'll try next time is "grease" the pan with butter and then "flour" it with cinnamon sugar...might add some zing to the doughy sides.  

Easy and great recipe!

Carol, you are a gift! Made these last night and they were terrific. I've had considerable trouble in the past with yeast, and now I can make great cinnamon rolls without it; yay! I hope they are as good the next day, 'cause I'm serving them at book club tonight.

These weren't made in a "jiffy" but my family and I LOVED the final product!  I didn't have any baking powder, so I used 1/2 tsp of baking soda. Not sure if it made a difference or what it did, but it's what I had.
Of course, I forgot to put the raisins in them, so I topped half the dozen with them. 
Next time I'd like to use cream cheese in the glaze mix.. Even after these little bumps I stumbled upon, my husband and I thought they were the BEST CINNABONS WE'VE EVER HAD!

These were good. They're basically a biscuit with cinnamon and sugar. Much easier and faster than the yeast version. I combined the flour mix with the butter in my kitchaid mixer. I just kept adding butter till it seemed right; I ended up using about 1/3 cup of butter for the dough. Then I started with 1/2 cup of milk (I added a drop of vanilla to the milk) and ended up adding maybe another 1/4 cup till the dough seemed right. Rolled out easily. I followed another reviewers suggestion and rolled out the dough then brushed melted butter on the dough followed by spreading light brown sugar and then cinnamon. I didn't measure, I just sprinkled all over till it seemed appropriate. Then I rolled it up and cut into 12 pieces. I put them in  a 9 x 11 pan that I had already buttered well. I did not put any cin/sugar on the bottom. I had some melted butter left so I brushed the tops with it and sprinkled more cin/sugar on top. Baked for 22 minutes. Not the same as the usual cinnamon rolls but they are good. And a lot faster.

GREAT recipe if you don't have the time for yeast-based cinnamon rolls. These are cakey, almost muffin like, and very light (I did use half whipping cream,as I needed to use it up, and half skim milk). The dough was a breeze to work with (not too sticky for me). I did not increase the cinnamon mixture and found it be enough.  Next time I will not put this mix into the muffin tin bottom as it did not melt and most stayed in the pan. I turned these out onto a sheet pan lined with parchment and frosted them with "The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing" (halve that recipe for this roll recipe). I will definitely make this again.

Very good but it helps to read reviews first, wich I did not. Next time I would: cook less time, more like 18-20 minutes in my oven. Flip them out of the pan immediately, do not wait even a minute. This will avoid the crunchy topping in the bottom of the pan making it easier to remove. My husband ate 4 in one sitting. Good infrequent treat.

Amazing taste, simple to make and the 'jiffy' some people are complaining about I think is unfortunate for them.  If you don't like cooking then yes Pisbury dough will do but your missing out on making it all yourself.  This recipe is so easy!

These are delicious, but I'd recommend putting a tray under the muffin tin in the oven: some of the delicious sugar mixture spilled out! For shame!

I had what resembled very loose biscuit batter, added more flour but never got anywhere near a dough that could roll up.  Coated the dough with the cinn/sugar mixture then just dumped the dough into the muffin tins and just cooked it that way. They cooked quickly, only 15 minutes and the flavor was decent enough. Glaze was really runny.  

The roll itself turned into a very light, airy, consistency, which was great, and the cinnamon/sugar ratio seemed fine to me.

Easy to prepare, especially in a kitchen aid mixer. However,the texture is slightly more like a doughnut. I did add more than a couple of extra tablespoons of flour to get the dough to bind better. To get a better butter distribution I used the scone/croissant technique of grating the cold butter into the flour. I also added some grated nutmeg (always fresh grated) and ground ginger to the cinnamon mixture. I would certainly prepare these again when in the mood for a cinnamon roll but not much time.

I made this recipe as an activity with groups of 12 kids age 6-12.  It was simple enough for the kids to execute well and a solid enough recipe to turn out well despite overhandling and measuring errors.
We made some modifications, deciding that using 1/2 cup of butter for the filling made the right amount, baking for less time, and just skipping the glaze.  
For a quick, non-yeasted cinnamon roll these are great.

Followed each step and everything turned out great except for the glaze. You've got to add more confectioner's sugar to make it more gooey like those from Cinnabon. Nevertheless, I still loved 'em. What's more important is that my kids and my mom went crazy over 'em. Will definitely make more next time and I'd probably add apples. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I'm a rookie when it comes to the kitchen but it didn't show in my finished product. :P

Loved this recipe!  I was surprised how well they baked up considering there isn't any yeast in the recipe.  Great on a snowy New Year's morning.  I didn't use any currants or raisins.  Next time I will add pecans and a cream cheese icing.  The glaze was the only thing I didn't care for.

Great recipe! They are pretty sweet, but made a nice treat for Xmas morning.  Next time I will add some pecans to balance out some of the sweetness. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, baked them in a square pan, and rolled all the filling in the dough - the results were great. Everyone in the family (except my picky 10 yr old) thought they were WAY better than Pillsbury (sorry dough-boy!)

My husband and son made these with raisins instead of currants last Sunday. What a great recipe! I would have been very skeptical of a shortcut cinnamon roll recipe if I had seen it first, but I'm glad my husband decided to go for it because these were very tasty. The only thing I didn't like about them were the raisins, but that's just my personal preference.

Very good!  I made these with my nieces while their parents slept.  The dough was very sticky, so be sure to flour your work surface well.  Bench scrapper came in very handy.
My only issue was the glaze...very thin as written.  I added more sugar and it was still thin.  Still very good treats, but not Cinnabon thick as I was expecting.

These were surprisingly good! Some suggestions though: mine were done in about 18 minutes, far less time than the 20-25 minutes stated in the directions, so start checking on yours around the 17 minute mark and keep an eye on them until done. Also, my family doesn't like currants or raisins much, so I used some finely chopped walnuts instead - very yummy! I also threw in about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.

Loved this recipe!  Not sure why a tsp. of crumbly cinnamon/sugar mix was put on the bottom.....it stayed on the bottom of the nonstick muffin pan, and I ended up scooping it out and putting it on top of the roll!  I used raisins, and only made 1/2 batch to test it out.  It's definitely a wonderful alternative to yeast rolls, and I will be making this many more times in the future.....a full recipe, for sure!

Easy and delicious!I didn't change much with this recipe and they turned out great. Instead of using a muffin tin, I just laid them into a greased 6 X 9" glass pan and I didn't bother putting any of the cinnamon mixture in the bottom of the pan (totally unnecessary). They come out as "pull-aparts". I used raisins instead of currents because we like them better. The pan's not that hard to clean, just soak it in water for a short time and no problem. Just a couple of tips for people who thought the dough was too gooey: the dough is a bit moist so I sprinkle a bit of flour on it before kneading and as I knead to get the right consistency of SOFT ROLLABLE dough...not much extra flour is needed. Also, some people said baking time was too long...you need to know your oven and be careful with timing. Enjoy!

Delicious morning treat.  I reduced the serving size to 4 (to reduce temptation of eating a dozen on my own!).  I found that the bake time was too long and came close to overbaking mine (this may have been a function of the reduced serving size, but i still made each roll the same size as the recipe called for, so even if i made the full recipe, i would reduce the cook time to about 18 minutes).  They didn't have that stretchy chewiness that comes from adding yeast, but they were as close as you can get without having to put in all that extra time and effort (and, if you're like me, you only decide to cook things the moment you want them, making all that rising kneading time nothing but an obstacle on the way to your goal of immediate satisfaction).  I found the brown sugar mixture got stuck at the bottom of my greased muffin tins and would consider using muffin liners next time (for ease of clean up).  Overall, these were very yummy and a big hit with my hubby (he kept saying "I can;t believe you just whipped these up.  You're the best wife." hehe

I followed the recipe but it came out crumbly and dry.  Maybe I should cook it for 15 min instead of 20?  The bread wasn't doughy so I don't think I will be making this anymore.  Thanks for the recipe, though.

I love this recipe.  I did it without the glaze.  And the cook time could have been a little shorter... I pulled them out about 20 min and they were a little over done, but it could have been my oven.  I added pecans to half and I love that too!

This was a fabulous recipe.  I have been making something similar for years but this one is especially delicious. I have always just cut and put them on a cookie tray, but the idea of a muffin tin and putting a bit of filling in the tin gives a specially delicious crust, much tastier than simply putting on a cookie sheet!  I substituted oil for some of the butter and added chopped walnuts and a wee bit less salt.  This is a 5 and a keeper!  Will not go back to my old recipe again.  Thank you!

These were good, easy to make and a nice quick cinnamon roll fix, I used whole wheat flour and it was also good.

Pretty solid recipe! I prefer my cinnamon sugar to be more gooey and less cake like though. Had great flavor anyhow. I will make these again of I am pressed for time.

Delicious base. A little too sweet for my taste but son & hubby loved them. Next time will add some vanilla to cinnamon sugar butter and omit the glaze. Thanks for a wonderful easy to make recipe.

Super simple to make. Along with the cinnamon mixture, I add a few drops of corn syrup to the bottom of each muffin slot. It made a really goo-ey sauce....yum!

I've used this many times already and love it everytime. They are sweet and delicious and perfect. I leave out the currants always though, still good. Also i've been able to use this dough in making presentations (building edible artwork) etc. Wonderful.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars for ease of preparation and taste. To be expected that they dont taste like yeast rolls but for the quickness they were great...I know now I can make a quick cinnamon roll when I am craving one or for those Saturday mornings that I dont feel like getting up at 7am to make yeast rolls...

These were really good and so quick to make.  They were really sweet though, and I had to add more flour because the dough was really gooey and sticky.  I had to add at least a cup to make the dough finally form into a dough.  I used the cream cheese frosting, which added to the sweetness, I think.  Maybe next time I won't use as much filling - I got about 1/2 way through eating my cinnamon roll and started getting queesy from all the sugar! :) I only cooked it for 17 minutes, any longer and it would have burned.  I thought they were just as good as regular cinnamon rollls!

These were very good.  I gave them a 4 star simply because I like yeast rolls better.  However, for a quick cinn. roll fix these biscuit-like rolls are very good.  My dad actually said he thought he liked these -better than- regular yeast rolls.  So, I guess it just depends on your taste preference.  I made mine up just like regular yeast rolls (rolling and cutting them up) and it made 8 and i put them in a smaller glass dish and baked for about 25 min.  This will be my 'go to' recipe for quick cinn. rolls - when i want an last minute cinn roll fix.

If you want a traditional cinnamon roll, use a recipe with yeast.  If you want a quick recipe for a Saturday morning that will turn out yummy and have your kids begging for more, use this recipe.  I made it almost exactly as written, and we all loved it.  It's not the same kind of roll you'd think of when you think "cinnamon roll," but there sure weren't any complaints around our breakfast table!  Be sure to watch the cooking time carefully.  Mine were done in just over ten minutes and the rolls fell right out of the muffin tins.  I turned them out onto a cookie sheet like with aluminum foil, and they did not stick to the foil at all as they cooled.  The brown sugar mixture didn't harden, and the rolls stayed sweet and gooey.  For the glaze, I mixed orange juice with the powdered sugar instead of milk or water.  Very yummy, and I will keep this recipe for spontaneous cinnamon roll mornings!  Thanks!

Best cinnamon roll recipe ever!  I use the modified icing with cream cheese suggested by another reviewer.  Tip: When removing the rolls from the muffin tin we use a spatula to scoop out the sugar mixture left at the bottom on the cup and spread it on the rolls. Otherwise, the sugar mixture becomes hard and brittle and cannot be easily removed later. It's too good not to scoop up every morsel!

I don't know what happened, but this was NOT dough...more like a batter.  I had to add more and more flour until it resembled even the slightest bit of dough and then had the hardest time rolling out, and rolling up, and cutting.  I was looking for something easy to make, but this turned into a huge project - much more than I anticipated.  Even if they turn out decent enough to eat, I won't be making these again.  Next time, I'll go to the store and buy some yeast and make normal cinnamon rolls.  They smell great baking in the oven right now, but they'll probably be more like cinnamon globs than rolls simply because of how the "dough" turned out.  Something is wrong with this recipe.

These were quick but nothing compared to the yeast rolls. Used only little over 1/2 cup milk so suggest you add a little at a time not to get a wet dough to work with.  It is a biscuit roll so expect nothing more than that but a good one  tho. I placed all the filling in the roll and used a 9inch cake tin greased to bake it in.  Cud be a bit crumbly so take care when taking out soon after baking.  Will make if in a pinch but really prefer the yeast rolls feels more substantial than pastry type one.

(Instead of doing the rolling method, I placed a half slice of apple from apple pie filling in the middle of a piece of batter in the muffin tins and still used the cinnamon mixture in the bottom and then some on top.) I was super pleasantly surprised by how delicious these were! I think another reviewer compared them to Hardee's cinnamon rolls...All I know is that they definitely have the texture and taste of a professionally made cinnamon roll I've had somewhere else. I love yeast cinnamon rolls, too, but this was so easy to make and I can hardly stop eating them...it's going to be difficult for me to go back to making 'em the long way.

They tasted good, but they took forever to make (25 minute prep time is a joke!)  The dough got extremely sticky when I attempted to knead and roll it.  I had to add a ton more flour (and deal with massive dough-hands).  I think next time I make these I'd add some vanilla into the biscuit dough and much less milk (I can always add some in if it's too dry!)

I've been on a cinnamon roll fix for a week now and have been trying various recipes that are quick and without yeast and this is by far the best.  Definitely exactly what you're looking for if you're short on time.  I make mine in mini muffin tins so you end up getting the gooey parts as well.  I plan on making these all the time now.

this was a great quick treat - it's really like a biscuit dough with swirls of cinnamon-sugar, I don't think I liked putting the tsp of cinnamon-sugar in the pan and I do think it needed more in the filling, I'll probably make this again when I was some cinnamon rolls and have less than an hour to put something similar on the table.  Since I made this for Father's day it got chocolate chips in the middle and our cin-rolls are always frosted with cream cheese frosting.

Whoa, these are the best no-yeast cinnamon rolls!  It's important to understand because they are yeast free, the texture is cakey/muffiny instead of chewy.  I used soy milk because it's all i had, and they were still great.  I spooned the 12 teaspoons of the filling in a pie dish, and arranged them in there instead of a muffin tin.  I topped them with cream cheese frosting.  They were SO GOOD.

Yum!!! I gave it 4 stars simply because I had to improvise a bit. I ran out of all purpose flour (yep, I know it's time to go to the store) so I use self rising instead. I left out the salt and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder. Instead of milk, I used buttermilk. Everything else was exactly as written. Turned out really good. My oldest daughter didn't like the raisins, so next time I'll leave the raisins out.

Easy recipe! Excellent biscuit mixture.  The bottoms - cinnamon butter in the muffin tin - got a little too crispy.  Great recipe.  Will make again!

This was a great recipe. Followed it exactly, just that the frosting was not good. It was too thin. I looked up other recipes and found that you sound have at least 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar to 3 tablespoons of milk.

This is a quick alternative to yeast cinnamon rolls. It does not yield the same light flaky dough as with yeast, it's more like a biscuit. I used finely chopped walnuts since I don't like raisins. It's now my favorite quick roll recipe, good for unexpected company or for a Sunday breakfast. Delicious with a fresh cup of coffee.

I made these last weekend and they were really good. They were definately more like a sweetened biscuit or coffee cake. I made this for my mamii and she loved it. It was a great alternative to the yeast cinnamon rolls because they take a lot less time.

My boyfriend and I made these- we altered the recipe some. We doubled the amount of the filling and skipped the glaze. Wow....they were so GOOEY. We had some problems with the dough, due to our own error. Oddly enough, they turned out really well. Sadly, they looker awful. But it's the taste that counts, right?

These are so good, however I did add some more butter to the mix as it seemed a little dry. Im so glad I have a way to make cinnamon buns now since I hate messing with yeast. Im far to impatient.

These are great!  I've made them twice now. I have made them in muffin cups and in a pie plate and the muffin cup method works much better.  In the pie plate they sort of lost their shape.  I also just put a pinch of butter, a dash of cinnamon and a pinch of brown sugar in each muffin cup and put the other cinnamon mixture all on the dough.  I also sprinkled chopped pecans on the dough before rolling it up and I liked the texture of them. These have become a family favorite.

This recipe was easy and great. However, following the advice given in other users' reviews I added an extra 1/4 cup butter to the cinnamon spread and used twice the suggested amount spread on the inside. Made the whole house smell fantastic, and the extra butter made the sauce perfectly gooey.

A pretty good, easy cinnamon roll. If I made them again I would skip putting a teaspoon of the cinnamon sugar mix in the bottom of each muffin cup. All of my cinnamon filling bubbled out and the dough just kinda floated in the middle. Less may be better : )

These were really great and easy to make. They are the biscuit-like kind of cinnamon rolls, which is just what I was looking for. The only problem I had was the cinnamon mixture on the bottom of the cups didn't come up with the rest of the cinnamon roll very easily. Overall though, they were great. My boyfriend said they were better than his mom's.

At first I thought this was going to be really simple, but I think its better to make cinnamon rolls from yeast. I found when I made it to be very crumby and not at all what I expected. Although this is my first time baking this, I believe it wasn't all bad but I don't think I'll make this one again.

Good recipe over all. A difficulty I found was the dough being very sticky.  The directions are also not extreamely specific. 
NOTE: do not use paper cups  ( like for cupcakes). i tried half of my batch with them but it turn out the way i thought it would.

I had to add extra flour to get mine to form a dough, so next time I'll SLOWLY add milk to get the right consistency. These are so sweet they make me sick, so they are great for settling that sweet tooth you can't fill. So just be prepared for a bit of a sugar rush. I changed up the frosting, made it VERY buttery.

I dont like to give bad reviews..but this was bad. Too much milk.  Dough was not irm enough to cut.  I suggest to all whom are planning on making these to add 3/4 or less of milk instead of the whole cup~!!!!!

Very good. The kids loved them. The dough is very sticky and needs quite a bit of flour for dusting in order to knead and roll the dough. The glaze is very thin. I will try half as much milk or double the powder sugar next time I make this recipe.

These were excellent cinnamon rolls--and very easy to make!  I substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white flour, and I added an extra tablespoon of sugar to the dough.  It was sticky, but I floured my hands before picking it up and kneaded more flour into it, and then it was fine.  Instead of muffin cups, I used two 9" round cake pans.  The sugar/cinnamon/butter that I sprinkled on the bottom of the pans ended up caramelizing when I baked the rolls, which was very nice.  And the glaze was just right with about 2T of milk (maybe a smidge less) mixed with the 1/2 cup of powdered sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

These are good! I followed the recipe, only omitting the currants. I wasn't expecting them to taste exactly like fluffy cinnamon rolls because of the lack of yeast. However, they are still very soft and fluffy, but they have more of a biscuit quality than a yeast bread quality. The drizzle is a little bit boring, I think it would be good if you could add some cream cheese to it. I will make these again for a quick sweet treat! Thanks!

The dough is VERY sticky so I put a generous amount of flour down before I scooped the dough out of the bowl, and also threw some on top of the dough while I was kneading, to keep it from sticking to my hands. Other than the extra flour, I stuck exactly to the recipe, and it came out GREAT. 

Next time I might use a cream cheese frosting.

My first bake of the New Year. These were amazing! You would never know that these weren’t made from a yeasted dough, they were that good. My adult son and his partner said it was the best smell in the morning. I did not change the recipe and once they came out of the oven and I plated them, I put a sliver of Kerrygold butter on them and once melted, I iced them. These were worth the time.

The dough was very sticky and hard to work with, so I had a lot of trouble rolling it and the finished cinnamon rolls were extremely ugly and fell apart easily.  I had to use more confectioners' sugar in the icing than the recipe said so that it wouldn't be as runny; I also added some vanilla for added flavor.  Despite all that, they were quite yummy.  I'll most likely make these again, but I may play with the dough recipe in the hopes of making it easier to work with.

These were very good, I would do 1 1/2 times the amount for the filling though. I really like the idea of cooking them in a muffin pan. VERY EASY.

Wonderful.  But don't bake them for as long as it says.  Mine were plenty done in 12 minutes.  Also if you soften the butter for the cinnamon mixture it spreads a lot easier!  I add a bit of vanilla to my frosting as well, and leave off the currants because I never have any around.  This recipe made 24 rolls for me.

I used soy vanilla milk to make these cinnamon rolls vegan style. They turned out great! Also instead of using a muffin tin I used a round metal pan & arranged them like you would with pre-made cinnamon rolls from the store. This recipe took little prep & cook time & turned out great! :)

My sister and I made this recipe and our grown children loved it.The third time around we had to double the batch. Instead of using all purpose flour we used self-rising and omitted the baking powder and salt and they turned out beautifully. Thanks for the recipe it is already a big hit with our families

It's not Cinnabon... But considering I didn't have to wait for yeast to rise, it was fantastic!  When I want cinnamon rolls, I mean now!  And that's just what I got.  Tasty, soft, warm cinnamon rolls in a hurry.

I'm not a big fan of the glaze though, so I didn't bother making it.  Instead, I took what was left of my tub of cream cheese (About 3 tbl) mixed it with about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and about 2 tbls of Milk.  This made a thin cream cheese frosting that *I* loved, but everyone else seemed to prefer the plain cinnamon rolls. 

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because for being a no-yeast recipe, I thought it was fantastic!  Thanks Carol!

**Updated... I changed the rating to 3 stars for now, because the next two times I made it, it wasn't nearly as good...  =(  Sorry.  Not sure if it was my fault, or if I was just too excited the first time to really concentrate on it.  Still decent though, for quickie cinnamon rolls.

Pretty good, very sweet but the glaze was just too thin. Will try this again but substitute icing for the glaze.

Otherwise very tasty.

This recipe is outstanding! I doubled the recipe, left out the last glaze, and baked them in a glass 9”x 13” cake pan. The dough was a bit too sticky, so I added a couple handfuls of flour, and heavily floured the workspace. I also didn’t have raisins. The bake time for them was 45 minutes. They were delicious!!! Made it for breakfast one day for 3 adults & 7 kids, most of whom are picky eaters, And EVERYONE LOVED THEM!! I’ll definitely be making these again!!!

So I did make these for my wife’s family ( her 2 sister’s and her dad) and one sister gave it a five star while the other sister and dad gave it a four star. My wife gave it a five star and I give it a five star. So I have the Copper Chef 12 cup muffin pan. I decided to use the cupcake liners for this one so I would not dirty my new Copper Chef muffin pan. I made the receipe exactly and  after all said and done, their was not a single cinnamon roll left.  I actually ended up with one more cinnamon roll ( from the dough) in which I put on the side. After baking the 12 in the cupcake liners, I did this one by itself “without”putting the teaspoon of the brown sugar, cinnamon, butter mixture in the muffin cup and without the cupcake liner.  When done baking this single serving, I served it to my wife, and she loved it. I did show the video to my wife and her family so they know how it’s made.  They were shocked how easy it was. This was my first time making it and I am so super glad everyone loved it. Next time when I make it, I would do away with the cupcake liners and not adding the teaspoon of the brown sugar, cinnamon, butter mixture. I would make the dough part and sprinkle all the brown sugar mixture inside the dough, roll it up and then cut them into 12 equal parts to bake.

I followed the recipe exactly. They were like hockey pucks and were so bland. Not sweet enough. Won’t be making these again. Worst thing I have ever baked. Sorry but just sharing my experience. Like I said I filled the recipe exactly as written. So disappointed.

I have made this recipe once a few years ago and they were yummy so I made them at Christmas time too this year.  I had the Demerara type of brown sugar in the pantry so that's what I used and made the recipe just as written, using the currants.  They were very good and I removed them from the muffin cups with tongs when they came out of the oven.  They were done in 17 1/2 minutes and if I had left them in for the 20 to 25 minutes they would have burned.  So make sure to check them after 17 minutes unless your oven runs colder.    I made them again today because my hubby really loved them at Christmastime.  Today, however, I used regular brown sugar and raisins instead of currants.  The instruction says to turn them out onto a serving platter when they come out of the oven so I did.  Well, they were stuck so badly to the bottom where the teaspoon of sugar/cinnamon mixture had been placed so some came out, some stayed in stuck and some had their middles stay in and the outside came out.  I was so disappointed at how the sugar stuck in the bottom too.  Last time I used a non-stick muffin pan but the one I used today is also a non-stick but a different make.  I greased both pans very well with butter both times.  I think that the next time I will try the other non-stick pan again and take them out at 17 minutes and remove them with tongs again.

The dough was totally soupy (which may have been my fault for using 2% milk) so I didn't roll it but spooned it into the  muffin cups and spooned the rest of the topping over that. Topping bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven and started to burn. When I tried to invert it, the topping stuck to the bottom (yes, I greased it) and I wound up with scrambled cinnamon biscuits.  I did not make the icing because I don't things too sweet. Speaking of which, I thought there was too much of the topping unlike others who have said there wasn't enough. All that said, it tasted good. If I ever make it again I think I'd do it in a cake pan and consider it a coffee cake.

love not having to use yeast.  made the dough the night before since my kids had a sleepover, chilled in the fridge.  next morn, dough was super easy to roll out.  I didn't roll out long up, ended up w/10 pieces. 
for the cinnamon butter mixture, I prefer to dip then place in "brownie" pan, with mix side up. didn't have currants, so used chopped nuts.
 baked for about 30 min (don't like soft dough).  with pantry items, wonderful "free" breakfast.

This is my favourite recipe for cinnamon rolls! I would recommend this to anyone, I've made it several times and each time it came out perfect. This recipe is sweet but not too sweet which makes it absolutely perfect. Worth a try :)

Melt in your mouth yummy!
These aren't as easy as I had hoped as it involves many steps including rolling out the dough, but it is not difficult or fussy.
It is important to remove these from the pan before they cool! That should be added to these instructions. They are still yummy, just don't look as nice if cooled into the pan shape.
Made them for my book group!

For a quick no rise dough it was good.  I made my dough too wet and will correct that the next time I make these.  We love cinnamon and most anything made with it. I used raisins instead of currents.  This was very good and my son liked them a lot.

I gave it two stars becuase it will probably be tasty but I will have to adjust the recipe; If i decide to make it again. It had way too much milk. The dough wasnt dough but a soupy sticky mess. I would start with a 1/2 cup or less and add a little by little until its the right consistancy.  It stuck to my counter, it rolled ok... but more like trying to roll jello. I had to use a spoon to scoop it off the counter and into the muffin tins.

Made it twice. Watch cooking times. 20 min in a convection oven was plenty. 25 made it too crispy on the top facing dough parts. Other big suggestion is to really spray the pan well! Because you put brown sugar and cinnamon mixture on the bottom of each roll, it heats up. Sticks easily, which means digging out rolls and soak time before cleaning the pan.

I will not be making these again...flour everywhere because you need a lot more when at the kneading point...too crunchy on the outside (even though I baked them the recommended time).  On top of all the mess , I didn't think they were anything special.  I gave it 2 stars because...well...it IS a cinnamon roll.

They taste really good and the texture is good for not having any yeast.  I do prefer the yeast ones, but I will still make these being they a simple and good.

The first time this took a bit over an hour to make. The second time, just about an hour, since I knew what I was doing.  My rolls came out slightly crispy outside and oh so gooey inside. I substituted raisins for cranberries. Great rainy day recipe that leaves the house smelling yummy! This one is a keeper!

Can't believe I didn't find this sooner. Yes, the dough is too sticky to work with. I added 1/4 C more flour and life was all good again.  I did keep an eye on them in the oven after reading another review and they did not take any more than 15 min to cook and that was with pulling them out of the fridge where they had been over night.  Made no other changes and they came out looking and tasting fantastic.

Absolutely amazing cinnamon buns.  Found them to be a bit thick when I was putting them in the muffin pans.  Made extra of the cinnamon butter mixture so that may have contributed to the thickness but I think the dough needs to be rolled out longer than 12" . But all in all, excellent!

I made these today. They were delicious. I used raisins and chopped walnuts. The brown sugar was grainy and stayed in the bottom of the muffin tin. I hoped it would have been more like caramel. It didn't spread well. That won't stop me from making them again. My boys really liked them. I used canned frosting I had left over.

I make my cinnamon rolls with the buttemilk refrigerator dough, I use the 8 biscuit can but work two together for one roll. I have a shaker with 50/50 brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle on my work surface then lay the stretched out dough on it and sprinle somemore on top then add raisens, dates and walnuts and roll it up and put in a greased pan, I have an infrared oven and it still takes a half hour to bake, my way is more of a jiffy system than this recipe I think. Oh well, I'm jus' a dumb ol' trucker after all.

For someone who doesn't work with yeast much (or at all), I thought this was the perfect recipe for me! The dough was pretty tough to work with. It required more flour and still stuck to my hands like crazy. I did follow the suggestion for extra filling making one and a half times the recipe for that part. It was the perfect amount. The but I think next time I won't put any of the filling in the muffin cups before putting the rolls in, just a little bit of butter.  It got too crispy and most of It stuck to the cups when I took the rolls out.  And that was using a silicone muffin pan! They only took 18-19 min, by the way.
I opted for a runny cream cheese glaze like a few others suggested. Definitely a great idea! But I drizzled mine on after flipping the rolls back over after turning them out. I thought the puffy swirl was prettier to look at than the crusty sugar bottoms.  Overall, they tasted scrumptious and smelled wonderful. I will certainly make them again.

I was hoping I would love these but was disappointed. The flour over-powers the taste of the rolls and the brown sugar on the bottom of the pan mostly stuck to the bottom of the pan even though I sprayed the pan with cooking spray.  I read other reviews that said the flour sugar ratio didn't work and I think i agree. I might make these again but tweek the recipe a bit.

This was an out-of-the-park fantastic recipe only because it was a rare moment that all 4 of my family memembers, including my picky when-it-comes-to-bake-goods husband, absolutely loved these rolls!!  I did add a bit of cream cheese to the frosting; and I both sprayed & floured the muffin pan to help with getting rolls out.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

not worth the effort - if you're jonesing for cinnamon rolls this badly - make a trip to the store.  Too heavy like a quick bread.  The family didn't even want a second one!

These cinnamin rolls were good, but not great.  The recipe for the frosting is not right, you will need much more confectioner's sugar to make it thick...too thin and it runs right off of the rolls.  I plan to try a different recipe next time.  Sometimes the yeast rolls are the best, even if you have to wait for the dough to rise.

This was a great recipe and I liked it because there is no yeast.  The only thing that was a little tricky was the dough because it came out on the sticky side so instead of the typical cinnamon roll look mine turned out as a swirly cinnamon muffin.  Despite that, they turned out yummy!  I really like the muffin pan idea, works great and I will make these again!

Great recipe, my favorite for snacks and in the morning.  I tend to leave the currants out, just due to my own personal tastes.  Definitely worth trying with them in, however.

These are amazing!  I have made them several times now and I usually make them for my husband to take into work.  They are usually a hit and they are so easy!  I think it's really fun to play with the dough as I roll it out and roll it up, I usually use my own recipe for icing though, one from my grandma.  very very yummy!

I needed a fast recipe for cinnamon rolls and this one worked out great!  My kids loved them and they were just as good reheated the next day.  My dough was sticky, but I added a bit more flour and it turned out just fine.  I also only added about 1/2 the cinnamon mixture to the bottom of the muffin tins.  Perfect!!

I've made this numerous times, and everyone in my family loves it.  It took a little more time than I anticipated, but overall not a bad recipe.  The icing is always very runny for me, but I've made this numerous times, and everyone in my family loves it.

These are good. My husband uses this recipe to make the kids cin. rolls frequently, letting them help him with them. I made them today and will have to concur with other reviewers about the stickiness of the dough and the glaze being thin, but working around those things they come out good!  We always make them with at least half whole wheat pastry flour.  I also found that I cooked them for about 17 minutes. Thanks for a recipe that a dad can enjoy making with his girls!

It's not the yeast cinnamon rolls but it's very good none the less.  It's a great, quick "in a pinch" recipe and I've made it often.

These were excellent and so easy to make.  They don't even need the powdered sugar glaze.  Yum!!

delicious, easy and fairly quick, the kids loved them. The cinnamon sugar was a perfect compliment to the roll that was light and tender.

This is an incredible recipe!  I don't think I've had an easier or better recipe for cinnamon rolls and it took a fraction of the time a yeast dough recipe would.  Thanks for a wonderful addition to my recipe box!!!

Nice to make if you don't have all day to make cinnamon rolls. Big hit with the hubby who isn't a real sweets fan. Thanks!

These were very quick and definitely easy.  So nice to have a cinnamon roll recipe that doesn't require yeast (which I don't always have on hand).  They were okay...definitely the best for as quick as they were, but I don't think I'll be making them again any time soon.

I love this recipe. I needed to make cinnamon rolls in a JIFFY for a dinner party. Did it in 30 minutes and baked them at the party
