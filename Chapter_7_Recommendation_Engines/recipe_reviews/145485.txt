Honestly, I shouldn't even rate this because I changed it so much, but I never would have thought to use bacon with the Greek dressing and I'm sure it was very good as written.  I didn't use the brand name bacon, I used rotini pasta, frozen cherry tomatoes from this summer, black olives, shredded mozzarella, and I forgot the sundried tomatoes.  I also threw in some Parmesan.  It was quite good, though, and I like the bacon better than the pepperoni I usually put in.

This is a good guideline for a GREAT salad. I used prosciutto (not microwaved) in place of the bacon and subsituted feta fot the mozzarella. I also used a smokey tomatoe dressing I found at Sunflower Market.  I eyeballed the cherry tomatoes, Kalmata olives (a must) and sundried tomatoes (also a must) mixed and sprinkeled parasean over the top. It was the first thing gone at the party.  Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!

very flavorful pasta salad - i love the combo of ingredients. I've made it several times now, sometimes subbing ingredients when I've run out: feta cheese although I think milder mozzarella as the recipe calls for is much better with the flavors. I didn't have dressing one time so I just splashed some balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar, and couple tablespoons of dijon mustard and it turned out well!

Delicious! I accidentally got shredded mozzarella, but it was great anyway. Very quick and easy to make! My family loves it, and asked for the recipe! I will definitely be making it again.

Made this for the first time tonight. Liked it a lot, but I had to add just a bit of fresh basil for more flavor. Will definitely be making this again.
