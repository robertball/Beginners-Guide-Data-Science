I'm not sure what I did wrong or if it was fault of the recipe? The brown sugar on its own does not melt. I tried to recover and added butter to the mix which seemed to help "melt" but it turned the sugar into brittle. Taste was great but I had issues with technique. User error maybe? You be the judge...
