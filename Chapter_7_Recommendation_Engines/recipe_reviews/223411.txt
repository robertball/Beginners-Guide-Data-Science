I made this slaw this morning, at first taste was bland.  VERY important to let the flavors blend for at least an hour.  I substituted stevia and left out the sugar.  Lightly salt the shredded zucchini and squeeze the liquid out after the 30 minutes.  I used a Miracle Whip(not light) type dressing, also added 1/4 tsp. celery seed, some minced onion and about a tsp. of white vinegar.  Wow, this is good!

Pretty basic coleslaw, nice and refreshing on a 87 degree evening. Went great with our grilled pork chops. We really liked having coleslaw made out of zucchini instead of the typical cabbage. We used coarse sea salt and fresh ground pepper for added flavoring.

I added some broccoli and dried cranberries, a little vinegar and it was AMAZING! Really liked the zucchini. I have been looking for some new recipes using zucchini and I found a winner.

Quick and easy slaw, let it sit for a while to blend the carrot and zucchini flavour, I used a tahini dressing with chilli/tahini/honey/lime/garlic/ginger. Turned out terrific with grilled fish.

Great substitute for cole slaw.  Didn't read directions first  for draining zucchini, that's a must! I shredded carrots and zucchini together in my cuisanart, added other ingredients.  Put in a colander to drain in fridge for a couple hours.  I didn't have Miracle Whip so I used Ranch Dressing.  Added Craisons, next time will add pineapple.

Yum!   This salad is so refreshing.  I took the advice of others and added chopped broccoli and onion.  I also added 1 tsp. red wine vinegar and 1 tsp. ground mustard to  the dressing.

Lighter and more refreshing than traditional cabbage slaw, and if you are a single person, it is a lot easier to eat through one zucchini than one cabbage. I used one large zucchini, one medium carrot, 1/4 cup red onion, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp lime juice, 1/2 tablespoon rice vinegar, and 3 tablespoons of vegan mayonnaise. It is runny, but it isn't soggy. It turned out flavorful and crunchy.

This is not as good as coleslaw with cabbage, but sometimes I have a zucchini and I don't have a cabbage, so it's a good recipe to have on hand.  Next time, I will definitely take the advice of other reviewers and add onion and vinegar.  This is kind of bland as written.  An apple would probably be good, too.

Yummy but it does need a little more seasoning.
