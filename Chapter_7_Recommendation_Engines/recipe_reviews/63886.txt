I made our stuffing in the crock pot this last Thanksgiving for the first time...what a life saver.  My recipe is a little different, using crumbled corn bread and adding a can of cream of mushroom soup (healthy request brand.  So much less stress and saved room in the oven for other dishes and saved a lot of time as far as getting everything on the table hot at the same time. At one point I put the crock pot on high when I felt the middle wasn't cooking fast enough. I will do the stuffing this way every year from now on!  Any stuffing recipe will work in the crock pot.  Try it!

This was a nice moist stuffing,yet the bread crumbs didn't turn to mush as I expected.  Nice that it didn't have to use the oven!

On taste, I give it 5 stars. On appearance and consistency, I would give it 3 or 4. I did a half-batch to test the recipe. I used ½ butter and ½ margarine. I didn't have any celery, so I omitted that ingredient. I didn't have sage, so I put in a little rosemary. I only had cubed bouillon, so I put 4 cubes (half-batch!) in a baggie and beat on them with a hammer until they were dust! :) Fun. I also used cubed bread, not crumbs. Anyhow, it came out crusty and just shy of burnt on the edges (which was fine, both me and my daughter liked it!), and soggy and somewhat greasy in the middle. That might have been my fault, I sprayed the crock with no-stick spray before starting. Next time, I'll only use half the butter called for and I'll probably cook it longer, or maybe stir it when the outside starts crusting up so the soggy bits will have a chance to dry out. It tasted GREAT, though!

This was a very easy, tasty side dish that my whole family enjoyed. Next time I might add some mushrooms for an added zip. Very good!

Delicious and easy!  It was so nice to be able to put this in the crock pot and forget about it.  I used chicken stock instead of the water.  It turned out very moist and full of flavor.  I will be using this again at the next holiday meal.
