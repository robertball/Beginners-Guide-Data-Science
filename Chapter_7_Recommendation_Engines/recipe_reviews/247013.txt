I followed the recipe except for the salt. There was already salt from the bacon and cheese. So  I divided 1 teaspoon of salt instead of 1 tablespoon.  Everything else stayed the same. It was good but I think next time I'm going to add a few red pepper flakes to add a little zip.

The quiche is very good and easy to prepare.  BUT, it was way too salty.  I suggest cutting back the salt to at least half, maybe more.

Great recipe! Easy & delicious! Used ham instead of bacon & no green onions. Next time I'll set the oven to 375 or 400. At 350, it didn't cook in 45 minutes! Otherwise, my husband said it was good.

There's no way this should have 1 Tablespoon of salt. I agree it was inedible for saltiness. 1 teaspoon salt plus salty bacon or ham would be sufficient.

This recipe is good. I followed the recommendations from others about the amount of salt. Honestly, it seems way too much for a recipe that contains bacon which is always very salty regardless of the type used. I only sprinkled a bit of salt in the egg mixture and it came out perfect. I can even go without no salt and it will still come out fine. In a quiche you should be able to taste the cream you use. Adding so much salt will mask it. With the modification, I will make this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written. I did not find it too salty. I made it for our Seniors potluck and only had a very small slice to take home. It was very good and I will make it again.  I liked that there was no pie crust,  good for my gluten-free husband

So easy for a relaxed Sunday morning.  I really didn't measure anything - just whisked 5 eggs and added some cream, whisked a bit more, poured into pie pan. In same bowl, I combined shredded cheese and potatoes, seasoned, poured those atop the egg mixture, then crumbled bacon on top and baked.  Didn't have green onions, so I snipped a few sprigs of garlic cloves from the garden, and used them for garnish. Delicious!

My first quiche and it turned out wonderful! It did take 20 minutes more of cooking time but that could be because I added to many has browns! I will make this again but with less hash browns!

I would give this 5 stars except it was so salty it was inedible for us.  I followed the recipe as written.  I will make again but with half the salt in the recipe.

Really pretty good and easily changeable. Used 5 eggs and 1/2 cup cream. Eye-balled the seasoning and threw in some mushrooms and  green pepper (softened by putting in the microwave), used mozzarella and cheddar.  And some cooked sausage.

It was very good.  My husband enjoyed it as well. Easy to reheat for lunch the following day. We will make it again.

It was very easy to make, I did add extra ingredients,  and cooked it in a caserol pan, so I added about 15 minutes of cook time,  but came out great!

This is very similar to the Oven Denver Omelet which was in the May/June 2000 issue of Quick Cooking magazine.  The QC recipe calls for 1/2 tsp. seasoned salt, ham (I don't use any meat but one could also use bacon or sausage), 1 Tbsp. dried minced onion, and milk instead of cream.  For this Allrecipes recipe, I omitted the salt completely because I typically don't use salt in my recipes.  I also used regular diced onion as I didn't have green ones.  I had some heavy cream but it had started turning so I ended up using half and half.  

Also, it's not necessary to use three dishes--pie plate, mixing bowl for eggs, and a mixing bowl for the potato/cheese mix.  I cut the recipe in half, greased a round pyrex baking dish and mixed the egg portion in that.  I then mixed up the cheese/hashbrowns in another bowl and then added most of that to the egg mix in the pyrex bowl.  I mixed that up and then dropped the rest of the cheese/hashbrown mix on the top, where it sank .  So, if the goal is to get a somewhat crispy, cheesy crust on the top, sprinkling some of the cheese/hashbrown mix on top isn't going to do it.  

The taste was somewhat bland (blander than the Oven Denver Omelet).  I think it needs something more than plain salt and pepper--a seasoned salt or pepper would probably do the trick.  

Given that this is very similar to the Oven Denver Omelet and that the Oven Denver Omelet is better, easier, and already in my recipe box, I will continue to make that.
