This was great but I have a few suggestions that I hope will make it better. First, the appels could be cut a bit smaller. Next put about a 1/2 cup of brown suger in a bowl and add to that a teaspoon of cinnamon, about 3 or 4 tablespoons of a amaretto, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Mix them well together, then add the apples to this. Cover them well and let them stay in that a couple of hours before cooking. This is well worth the time, delicious. Next, when you have your butter melted add the suger and cinnamon to the pan and let the mixture melt together a bit. Becomes a smoother blend. Next, where I live Mountain Dew is not available so I used an orange soda and the result was also yummy. I will provide a photo next time I make this as mine looks very different from this one. I hope everyone enjoys these changes.

I had apple cobbler and ice cream at the Virginia State Fair 2 days ago and I have been craving apple cobbler ever since. I'm more of an eater than a cook so I was looking for an easy way to duplicate my Fair experience. When reading the recipe I thought it would not be as good but I figured I'd give it a shot. WOW!! This was perfect, from start to finish my wife and I were eating in about an hour and a half. The prep time is almost nil and let it let me enjoy the eating part so much sooner than other recipes I found. I will try others but for a quick desert to make after a long days work there probably isnt anything as good for so little effort! I used Butter Flake crescent rolls and no other substitutions and Butter Pecan ice cream! I also threw on some pecans before shoving it in the oven. I wasnt to keen on using Mountain Dew but the Dew does what its supposed to dew! :) I highly recommend this dish!

I have made these for a good while now.  You can also use cheap canned biscuits...just roll them out with a rolling pin a little, they work great, and you can pocket the extra money that cresent rolls cost.  Oh yes...we always called them Apple Dumplings.   Ü

Absolutely delicious!!!! I drizzled caramel topping and added chopped pecans. I also did some adjustments on the sugar. I did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar total - 1 cup. It was a total hit at my house. This is a keeper!!

This dessert is wonderful served with ice cream.  It's a great idea, when they are fresh from the oven, to let them sit for about 10 minutes to absorb some of the juice in the pan.  I have even cut down on the sugar as it's a little overwhelmingly sweet.  Wonderful and simply easy could sum up this recipe.  I have been making these for years.

This is a very easy recipe. This makes a nearly PERFECT cobbler. I have been searching for years trying to find out how to get the liquid on my cobbler to a thick consistency. Never thought a can of soda could help do that. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used butter flake crescent rolls in my cobbler - very buttery and tasty. The only thing this recipe lacked was a couple of teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice, to give the cobbler just the right tang to balance out the sweet. Otherwise, nearly perfect!

this is my favorite desert that i make. Everyone loves it, and i get asked for the recipe often. After tweaking the recipe the first few times i made it, i think i finally have perfected it. First I add 1/2 cup of unpacked light brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of all white. I add 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the butter/sugar mixture, I sprinkle the rolls with chopped pecans or walnuts before baking them, and I use far less than an entire can of mountain dew (more like 1/2-2/3). I'm honestly not sure if this makes a difference cause it's the only way i've ever done it, but i melt the butter in a pan and add the sugars cinnamon and vanilla while its still on the heat. then after a couple minutes i spoon it over the rolls. Also, serve with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream...amazing.

So easy and very good! Followed others suggestions...cut out some of the sugar.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Cut butter back to 1/2 cup.  Topped with oats.  Everyone loved it!  Will use a little lemon next time.

One of my most favorite desserts. You can get away with using margerine and half (or more) the amount called for. I've also cut the sugar down to over half and used brown. Also great with apple pie spice or pumpkin pie spice. Great cheap dessert and AWESOME with frozen yogurt or low-cal ice cream.....to cut the sweetness. ;)

This dish was absolutely amazing.  I had a bag of red delicious apples that were going to go to waste so I wanted to find a fast and tasty reciepe to put them to work.  I cored and peeled 4 smallish apples and followed the rest of the reciepe to a "T".  We took the apples out of the baking dish to cool due to it being pretty liquidy at the end and not wanting them to get all mushy.  Added about 1/2 tsp of cream cheese frosting and it was HEAVEN!  May be a bit sweet for some, but will kick your sweet tooth in the butt!!!

This recipe is AMAZING. I was a little scared to try it, because it seems waaay to easy. But is is soo good! I did not make any adjustments. I get requests from friends and family for this all the time! It is so fast and easy to make. Sometimes I will cut up an extra apple and put it around the dumplings and they also turn out so yummy, and perfect on top of ice cream. It is also yummy left over for a sweet breakfast pastry.

I have made this recipe four times in the last month! It is wonderful!  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and cut the sugar. I use reduced fat crescent rolls, 1/2 cup Splenda Blend for the sugar, and diet Mountain Dew. It is just as good as its all-sugar cousin. It was good with Yellow Delicious and Granny Smith apples. Another keeper! Thanks, Leslie!

I've made this for longer than I can remember and I do a couple of things differently...first I use 2 cans of crescents which is 16 triangles, then I use 4 very flavorful apples (fugi, Braeburn, gala) and peel core and quarter them, then wrap each chunk in a triangle of dough and lay them seam side down in a 9x13 glass pan ( they might look a little odd and lumpy but they don't after baking.) Here's the trick to the most delicious cobbler..measure 1 1/2 cups of bottled apple juice or cider into a small pan, add 1/2 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla extract  and bring to a boil.. Watch it, this will boil over easily.. Then pour all of the syrup over the roll ups, making sure each one is drizzled with the syrup, this will make them lovely crispy and brown. Bake at 350* for about 30 minutes open oven door and sprinkle generously with turbinado sugar ( this adds a sparkle and crunch to the crust)or regular granulated sugar, then bake until brown and bubbly. Let cool for at least 1/2 hour then serve with ice cream, whipped cream or fresh cream and enjoy:)  they're really delish the next day too, if they survive that long..yummy! And by the way we always called them dumplings:)

Very good flavor and textures! I asked others if they could guess the "secret ingredient" and no one could guess there was Mountain Dew in it.  Based on other reviewers' suggestions I cut butter back to 3/4 C. and did 1/2 C. white sugar, 1/2 C. brown sugar. I also added an extra apple cut into slices between the dumplings and would have preferred more.

Yes, it's sweet.  And gooey and warm and absolutely wonderful.  I've made it twice now and each time I've served it -- dead silence.  The best compliment a baker can receive while people are eating!  I don't use a full can (I've stuck with regular Sprite) but use just enough to almost reach the top of the crescent rolls.  Awesome.  This one + french vanilla ice cream is staying in my box!

Had to use up my left over peachs so I dumped them over the apple turnovers then topped them with 1 c. sugar,cinnamon & 1 1/2 Tbl. butter. I also used Hansen no sugar orange valencia soda. It was awesome! Less sugar yet it was plenty sweet. This is a keeper!

I have made this recipe for a few years now.  It is the best for a quick delicious dessert.  Everyone loves it from my 80 year old dad to my 4 year old great neice.  It is a favorite with my bunko club.  The only thing I sometimes do any differently is to drizzle a little honey on an individual serving if someone wants honey.  A hit at any function!

I teach a baking class to kids age 6-11, and not only was this super easy, they loved it! Only suggestion is make sure the baking pan is big enough that the rolls are spaced out enough that the liquid can cook and evaporate. I 1.5'ed the recipe, but squished into a 9x13...Liquid was still there and bottoms were a bit gooey. Kids still loved it though!

One of the easiest desserts I have ever made, and absolutely delicious!  I used generic crescent rolls and Splenda Sugar Blend (1/2 splenda, 1/2 sugar), and Diet Dew.  If you like apples and cinnamon you MUST try it.  I am going to a birthday pitch-in this week, guess what I'm taking!

So delicious!  I also tried with peaches (don't use soft ones) and it was just as good!  They don't hold up so well in the syrup after a day in the fridge so I remove them from the syrup and just spoon it after reheating.

I made it for a Super Bowl Party. Everyone loved it, and was amazed at the recipe. Even the guys were asking me about it. Very easy to make, but tasted like I had put alot of time and effort in the making! The sauce thickend up perfectly, and I couldn't have been more pleased. It is a keeper.

Excellent and very easy to make. I used half brown sugar and half regular sugar and it was perfect. I was worried in the beginning with the amount of liquid but it cooks down easily and be sure to let it sit a little while right out of the oven. This will for sure be a family favorite.

I have made this twice now but had to make changes.I use reduced fat crescent rolls.I wrap the slices of apple and place in baking dish.I sprinkle about 2 tbsp of white sugar and 2 tbsp of brown sugar over apples.Then I sprinkle with cinnamon or apple pie spice and slivered almonds.I pour about 3/4 of a can of mountain dew or diet dew(also used sprite)in baking dish and about 1/2 cup of melted butter over apples.I top them with vanilla frozen yogurt after baking.Delicious!Every one loves it!I have found that you do not need as much butter or sugar as recipe calls for.

I made this for a potluck. So easy, and everyone loved it. I used Mountain Dew, but a friend recommended Sprite or 7UP. They are obviously citrus sodas, and I didn't make the connection. The MD was great, but I didn't realize it was a citrus soda.

My coworker made this for a work party and I thought it was an "old home" German recipe.  It was irresistible!!!  Then, she told me it was THIS!!!  Best cobbler I ever had!!!  Incredibly quick!  I can't wait to make it!

Update - I’m finally making it (May, 2018 ??)with the following upgrades. Browned butter, mixed dark brown and confectioners sugar (all I had) rolled apples in cinnamon sugar, adding lemon and lemon zest to butter. I’m gonna put soda in first and then butter sugar, so it stays on top a little.

These were a hit at our church luncheon. I did make a few changes that people suggested in earlier reviews:
I cut up four apples instead of two and coated them with a mixture of 1/2 brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp almond extract, and juice from half of a lemon. I did let them sit overnight in the fridge.
Instead of using all of that white sugar, I toned it down a notch with 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 c white sugar. I added only 10 oz. Sierra Mist. I used the 2 extra apples and laid them around the sides of the dumplings.

These were super delicious and gone in a flash!

my mom makes this and it is delicious!  it is very sweet.  She did say the last time she made it she cut back on the sugar and we topped it with icecream.  I didn't notice a diffrence but others said it cut back on the sweetness of it.

For some reason I felt this could have been a little better. I did enjoy it with icecream though.

OMG...this recipe is sooo easy! i was truly amazed&very pleased with the outcome. it look jus like the pic above, i was truly amazed. And the taste is to die for. My boyfriend devoured it, i didnt have any"MountainDew" so i used "Sprite"(thats the only thing i had) and it was...Marvelous!!! i'll be makin this again&again. its the easiest cobbler that i ever made. Also u can make it small (for the ones who wants 2 watch their figure) or you can go all out. its like havin your own inividual cobbler...

These things are so delicious, and they are devoured whenever I make them. I followed other suggestions and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. The last time I made them, I added 1/2 tsp ground ginger to the cinnamon/butter mixture, and everyone said it tasted even better. I might go as high as 1 tsp ginger next time, but will definitely add ginger to them in the future.

I needed an apple dessert and decided to make these.  I am glad I did.  They were a hit with everybody.  The only changes I made was to cut the white sugar down to half a cup and added a half of cup brown sugar.  I also topped some with pecans.  They turned out great.  Next time I make these I am going to try a tube of cinnamon rolls and see what happens.

The best ever!!   I have spent hours making crusts and peeling apples for apple cobbler pie.  After all that work, this is better and the kids loved rolling the apples into the dough.   We used mountain dew and we topped the cooked cobbler with vanilla ice cream.  The whole thing was eaten very quickly.   Is a great easy recipe and presents well enough to bring as a dessert to a party or event.    Plus, the house smells great!  I would have added a photo, but it was all gobbled up before I could find the camera.

I just made this with Peaches it's the BEST so easy and quick.
I used cinnamon and sugar for the top. I didn't use the soda I used the butter and sugar and water to make the syrup to pour over the peaches then sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar on top.  yumm.

After reading several reviews, we cut the sugar to one cup and only used 8oz Mt. Dew.   Still needs a little tweaking, but man these are YUMMY!  We will peel the apples next time and season the apples with cinnamon and sugar before baking.   I think then, it will be a 5 star recipe.

Oh I was SO pleased with this recipe!!  I reduced the butter by 1/2 a stick and mixed brown and white sugar. I also used about 1/2 a bottle of Mountain Dew vs. the whole thing. Served with Baskin Robbins vanilla ice cream.  Dessert was DELICIOUS!!!

Insane amount of calories in this per serving. Would need to skip a meal to fit this in. Lightening it may help some but 1 1/2 c sugar for 2 apples!

This has a wow factor. Nobody will guess how easy it was to make. My two granddaughters love making this all by themselves. You do not need that much sugar. Cut it in half.
If you hate rolling out a pie crust this will satisfy your desire for apple pie.

I've been making these for years. The only difference I do is I use 1cup of sugar and pour the soda AROUND the rolls, not on them...there's NEVER leftovers!!!

Followed the advice of Cookin in Holland....
(1/2 cup of brown suger in a bowl and add to that a teaspoon of cinnamon, about 3 or 4 tablespoons of a amaretto, and a teaspoon of vanilla. Mix them well together, then add the apples to this. Cover them well and let them stay in that a couple of hours before cooking. This is well worth the time, delicious. Next, when you have your butter melted add the suger and cinnamon to the pan and let the mixture melt together a bit. Becomes a smoother blend)

YUMMY!!!! I made this exactly as the recipe directs and it was wonderful! For a healthier version I'm sure the amount of butter and sugar could be reduced as well as using diet soda and I'm sure it would still be just as delicious.

I made this for our family Thanksgiving dinner, and had SO many requests for the recipe.  (Yes, I directed every request right here). The next day I made a second one and added a little vanilla extract, came out even better! (The first one was gone before we could even get the ice cream out of the freezer, but had some with the second batch, still incredible. (I don't see how you could go wrong with this recipe at all!!)

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I did make a few tweaks after reading all of the other raving reviews. My adjustments were: 
1. I lightly sprinkled the apple slices with cinnamon and sugar before rolling in the crescent rolls. 
2. I used honey butter crescent rolls, 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon apple pice spice, and 8 ounces Mountain Dew. 
3. I topped it with the pecans that come in the glass jar that is packed with syrup (found in the ice cream aisle).
4. I removed them from the original cooking pan so they would not get soggy prior to serving. 
Mmmmm mmmmm good!!!

This is an amazing recipe!  every time I make it, my guests ask for the recipe.  It's super easy and very good even the next day.  I just warm it up in the microwave.  I did cut back on the butter and sugar.  I use 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup sugar, and it's still really good.  With full amount, it was swimming in butter.  Still really good, though!

I made this but I used three apples, empire apples, I think are the best.  I peeled and sliced them with an apple slicer, I doubled my apple slices when I wrapped them, I think that one apple slice is not enough; but its your own preference. Plus I also used diet mountain dew, which I don't think it made a different; people ate so much; thank you for this simple and wonderful recipe!  Will make it again!

These are FANTASTIC and very easy.  Tastes more like an apple strudel.  The crunchy top adds a great texture to it.  I made a mixture of brown Sugar, cinnamon and lemon juice and rolled the apple slices in that first then I did half and half brown sugar and white sugar for the topping.

I followed the suggestions of some reviewers and it was amazing and easy to make! Coated the apples in brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, rum mix and let that sit a couple hours before proceeding. And as many have suggested, used a combo of brown and white sugar rather than straight 1.5 cups white. Used Sprite - thought the whole can might be too soupy but it turned out just fine. I like that they are easy to serve - might make for an office potluck sometime!

Wow! Just a few simple ingredients and you have a delicious cobbler! I cooked it as written and it turned out perfect. Next time I might try some of the other suggestions. Like brown sugar and vanilla. I'll make this again soon!

Delicious. Made as instructed but used lemon/lime real sugar soda as I can't tolerate HFCS. Will make again but increase the apples and probably layer them with the dough as I like the apple flavor.

So easy and delicious. Everyone loved it. I used prepared pie filling since I was in a rush and I wasn't sorry. Add vanilla ice-cream and it evens out the sweetness perfectly.

I had these a couple years ago made with Sprite or 7up, and they were very good ( I don't eat apple pie, cobbler, dumplings etc.. hardly at all) Anyways I attempted to make these, I listened to many of the reviews on here and I still had some problems which I need to add didn't stop them from being consumed lol. This also was my first time making this so maybe it's trial and error I don't know but next time I'm going to remember cause they were good. So I did everything per instructions but I 50/50 ( brown/white) on the sugar. This is where I messed up I think. : I initially had glass 9X13 baking dish but it seemed there would be too many too close together to cook evenly so I split into sperate pans ( 9X9 I think & 8X11. -weird size that normally doesn't get used ever here ) but evenly spaced apart. I tried to portion the soda sugar liquid on evenly, popped in oven and at 30 minutes the tops were done but I still had good amount of liquid left more so on the slightly bigger pan. The bottoms were soggy so I removed all of them and left them sit for few minutes ( they were still hot anyways). Majority of them did harden to point of no soggy bread but 3 or 4 of them I just removed the bottom piece. The very next day between the half of the  portion I took home and the half I left at my dad's- Every. Apple Cresent. Was. Gone! I will be definitely trying this again (1 pan this time maybe a little less liquid ) & hiding a few when done. Thanks

This is wonderful!  I've made it several times now and love it the way it is..but with less butter and sugar.  I like to sub 1/4 cup of brown sugar for 1/4 cup of the white and I dip my apples in it before rolling them in the dough then proceed with the recipe,except I pour the soda between all the dumplings so the tops remain a little crisp.   I also like to pop it in the over just before we sit down to dinner..then it's fresh and hot for dessert.  Thanks for sharing this!

YUMMY!  Will definitely be making this easy dessert again. I followed Cookin in Holland’s suggestions, because I happened to have Amaretto on hand, and it turned out perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty amazing and delicious I’d say! Next time I am going to try using red apples and possibly soak the apples in the butter/cinnamon/sugar mixture before rolling them in the crescent rolls; nonetheless it is a great recipe!

Not a cobbler by any means, but definitely a great apple "dumpling" dessert! I used half butter amount and half the sugar. Spread a little home made apple butter on the inside of each crescent before rolling the apple inside. Baked for 45 minutes. Will be adding this to the MUST HAVES every fall! Thanks for the recipe!

I used the Butter Crescent rolls and used Sprite instead of Mountain Dew since I'm Caffeine sensitive. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This turned out great. Unbelievable actually. I did take the advice of others and cut the sugar back. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown. Kept everything else the same and it was amazing.

This was super easy and I had all ingredients on hand...except the Elixir de Dew! Received a big thumbs up with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. The next day leftovers lost a little on the reheating, though. The two of us should have eaten all 8 in the first sitting!

I made this and my family loved it!  There was a lot of juice left over (butter and Mountain Dew) and I saved it to go with another batch.

Very tasty. This could be great in a Dutch Oven on a camping trip. Best served hit and fresh, but we'll enjoy the leftovers for breakfast.

This is delicious.  I used 1/2 the sugar and it was great.  Next time I will 1/2 the butter also.  A pinch of cardamom was a nice addition.  I also made a pear one, used ginger ale and 1/2 teaspoon ginger.

I made this for dessert last week!  I served it hot with vanilla ice cream on top!  My guest raved about how wonderful it was. I will plan on making this again. I did cut back on the amount of sugar and butter.

It was delicious after it cooled down for 10 minutes out of the oven. The vanilla ice cream cut the sweet of all the sugar. I would cut the sugar in half.

This is sooo good for those Fall get-togethers! I used regular 7-Up instead of something caffeinated and it still was yummy. My only complaint is the pectin from the apples slightly gelled the sauce giving it a slimy texture but the flavor was still outstanding. Next time I’ll try it using peaches.

I made this as a trial-run for an upcoming social, so  basically threw it together without measuring anything.  Used just one tube of rolls for just the hubs and me and it was outstanding! 

I lightened it up considerably.  I could never use the amount of butter or sugar  called for in the original recipe.  I melted less than 1/4 c. butter, mixed this with  a 1/2 c of. a mixture of brown and white sugar, cinnamon, a pinch of allspice and 1/2 t. vanilla paste.  Spooned it over the apple-stuffed rolls (reduced fat).  Then scattered sliced Gala apples into the pan....poured some flat ginger ale that was in the fridge over this mixture (maybe 2/3 cup) and baked for 40 minutes....rolls were turning very dark...I think this needs watching.  

It came out perfect and can tell that this won't be around very long. Hubs gave a thumbs-up for taking to the dinner event.

This was soooo good. It was rich & sweet. I will make this again. I cut the recipe in half since it's just me & I added about 1/8 tsp of nutmeg. DELICIOUS!! Thanks for an alternative to apple pie.

I made it exactly by the recipe and I loved it. So did my family. It's all gone. I will make it again and use my own dough recipe. The canned croissants were very good but I think it will be much better with my own dough.

This is a Pioneer Woman's recipe and it's an easy dessert and no one would guess that crescent roll dough is used .. absolutely delicious and probably even better with vanilla ice cream.

I made this using Vernor’s Ginger ale in place of Mountain Dew. I have multiple requests to make it again and again

I made it but used half the amount of butter and sugar the recipe called for and it was perfectly delicious.

This recipe looks an awful lot like Pioneer Woman's Apple Dumplings recipe and was just as good (minus all the sugar and butter).  It's a hit at family BBQ's and gatherings and also at work functions.

Made these for Christmas and my entire family devoured them. I added the spices to the apples BEFORE wrapping them in the crescent rolls. DELICIOUS!

This really tasted very good. I used grapefruit soda and it turned the apples a pretty pink. I also used more apples and cut the apples in small pieces and put the crescent roll dough flat on top.

Wow, I had doubts before I made this last night, couple of things I changed,  I use light brown sugar and used less than what was required, also added a little vanilla, but everything else I just followed recipe, this was FANTASTIC, we could not stop eating it, so, so yummy. On the list to make often ;)

I made this for a brunch dessert, and it was a huge hit.  4 out of the 7 of my friends asked for the recipe.  It was delicious!  I served it with a scoop of ice cream.  The only question I have is how can one prepare this a little earlier in the day, since you are working with crescent rolls?

This recipe is one I've made several times, attributable to the "Pioneer Woman" cookbook.  It really is easy and  tasty, though.  Much easier than regular apple dumplings, which is what it most resembles.

I added more fruit to each triangle dough roll up because I have hungryman appetites in my family and this recipe was terrific. A definite keeper for family and church dishes and my recipe box.

Oh my goodness, in my humble Southern Style, “Thank you, Sugar for sharing this!” Made it with my 89 year old mother (helping her fight dementia). When I said get the can of rolls she got the can of cinnamon rolls. I laugh and said, “Why not?” It was simple the bomb.com. (Hip Hop Term for explosively good)

I'm not exactly sure how many times I've made this in the last 4 years but it's been my top go-to dessert recipe. I recently made it again and decided I needed to finally give it a review. I've even tried to substitute it with half sweetener one time, which worked out really well (just make sure it's cup for cup, etc). Otherwise, I've always followed the recipe as is - delicious. Will continue to make it for years to come.

2nd time I made this. 9 inch glass pie dish holds 8 rolls so I made 1/2 the recipe. Added freshly grated nutmeg to the apples before rolling them. Added a peeled and grated Granny Smith apple to the dish after the sauce was added. Used ginger ale instead. Works fine. These are simply delicious and wonderful.

This is realllll good at room temp with a glass of cold milk next day or an hour or so after cooking!
Don't feel like peeling apples? Buy a bag of pre-peeled apples where the fresh fruit is, or EVEN BETTER....Use Frozen peaches! Don't change a thing in the recipe, use the peaches frozen.  I prefer the taste of the peaches myself. This is just too easy and just soooo soooo good!

I followed the suggestions that others posted about dividing the sugar between white and brown and the result was excellent. The crust was crunchy and had a toffee flavor from the butter and brown sugar. Something else I would try is honey crisp apples instead of Granny Smith.

Perfect for when you have a family and little time. I cut back a little on the mt. Dew and sugar. It was awesome and easy. If you want multiple changes I'd go for another recipe and not change this one.

So delicious! I made half the amount just to try the recipe, I'll definitely be making it again! I also wanted to add more apples so I sprinkled small pieces of apple around the pan before putting it in the oven.

Changed it up a bit. I cut the white sugar out completely and added 1/2 cup  stevia & 1/2 cup brown sugar to the mix, switched out the regular soda for diet, and used whatever apples I had on hand (Apple Crisp & Gala). This was so darn tasty, even better knowing it didn't have all those extra calories! I'm sure how ever you tweak this recipe it won't alter the deliciousness of the original. It's that good! Definitely worth keeping AND sharing. Thank you!

Very easy to follow directions but can also easily be added to to expand recipe to needed amount. 

Excellent with cream cheese and sugar mixture wrapped with apple under crescent roll.

Such an easy and delicious recipe! I made it for thanksgiving and have been asked to make it thrice already! 
I cut down on the white sugar a bit and replaced with light brown sugar to give it a slightly molasses-like flavor. Delicious!

Very good.   I followed Cookin in Holland's suggestions and that made this perfect.   We don't eat this type of food often, but I wanted to try this unique recipe and I'm glad I did.   I didn't really expect great results using canned crescent rolls and Mountain Dew, but I was surprised how great this was.   Thank you!

I thought this was delicious. Even as left overs for the next few days. But when it comes out fresh, it is SO good. Guilty food pleasure.

Okay just made this but made changes... Only had Braeburn apples cut smaller and put several in each, before I rolled them up put cinnamon on them with a bit of sugar, I only used 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I sprinkled the sugars and cinnamon over the rolled up apples evenly poured the butter over that. I did not have Mountain Dew so I used a can of diet cranberry 7 up.  My 10 year just had one and loved it!   So many changes but it is a very workable recipe experiment with it!

DELICIOUS!!!!I had small granny smith apples cut into small wedges. I reduced the white sugar and then divided it with brown sugar. I used mt. Dew; everyone was surprised when I told them it was in there! I suggest making this dessert the day before and then heating it up when needed. It was so much better after setting overnight!

Yes!  It's been a hit at our house for 2-3 years.  I've used peaches when in season, and have also tried pears.  I've used Ginger Ale instead of Mountain Dew.  I do cut the suger to 1 cup and use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.  It's delish!  And easy

Yes, this is a delicious dish.  My husband said he would give it 15 stars.  Made just as written.  A keeper.

Very good overall but a little cloying if one follows the recipe exactly. I recommend using a lot less sugar and it would be a good idea to cut up the apple wedges as well. It was just easier to maintain the crescent shape that way -- if you're concerned about aesthetics of course. I also plan to use something other than Mountain Dew next time. It added unnecessary sweetness, which was ample already. Perhaps a lemon lime soda that's more tart and less sweet would work better.

I tried a friend's recipe and it was awesome. It is melt in your mouth good. I could not believe that it had soda in it. However, she used Sprite. This one is definitely a keeper.

Wow! The top crust was amazing, and the soft apple and flavorful syrup was terrific. We added a little milk at the bottom because my husbands family is from back east, and they like it that way. Mmmmm.
