I made this for my wife's office Christmas party and they loved it. The one change I made was adding orange zest to ramp up the orange flavor.

Thank you Mrs Fisher0729 for an exceptional recipe.  I made this recipe to take with us to a Christmas party.  One of the guests has traveled all over Europe.  She complimented me in that she said that she had never tasted a tiramisu as good as this in all of Europe!  Wow.

This tiramisu is not too sweet.  The mascarpone does well to balance out the texture and sweetness.  I used a dark chocolate powder using a tea strainer to do a medium dusting of the chocolate on top of each layer.  I also waited until I was going to serve the dish before dusting the top with chocolate for a better presentation.
