Very good!  The only tip I have is to either not cover the chicken or uncover it half way through.  I almost had chicken soup, but saved it by pouring out the juices and cooking for an extra 7 minutes.  No one wants soggy cheese!  :)

Used sugar-free honey (makes recipe low-carb)- very tastey...  Did not cover!!!! Sauce was plenty thick... Two of my breasts were big enough to stuff.. I butterflied them and beat'em.. I had 2 small breasts that I flattened and just put ham and cheese on top.. Worked fine that way too... even easier.. Thanks

I agree with the previous comment that it was very watery.  All I did was pour into a small pot and thicken with flour.  It was so so good.  The only thing I think I will change the next time is I am going to use swiss cheese instead.  Otherwise this is a keeper.

Very good recipe as is (even without my favorite herbs & spices!) I like to use TWO slices of HAM, w/cheese rolled inside ham. Many white cheeses will work in this dish, my preference is any italian cheese blend but I've used colby-jack w/great tasting results too. Added half a chopped onion before baking because the onion really complements the sugar in the honey. If you fear too strong of a mustard flavor or don't have enough mustard, then lessen the amount of mustards called for and replace the lessened amount with mayonnaise... 
Two examples: #1, I did not have spicy brown so I used 1/4 cup mayo to replace the spicy brown - chicken came out great.   #2, I did not have enough mustards so I used slightly more than 1/8th cup of each mustard with slightly less then 1/2 cup of mayo to make up for the loss of mustard

This is a definite hit at my house.  I followed the recipe exactly...only thing I changed was after I stuffed the chicken, I wrapped it in bacon and then secured with toothpicks....I served it over rice and it was delicious and super moist!

I made this for AR Buzz Recipe Group this week.   I followed the recipe exactly as written including the baking time.   I was skeptical that this could be good (too few ingredients and too much mustard and honey were my thoughts.)  I was so wrong; it smells wonderful and tastes great.  My tween son liked it too and he doesn't eat mustard voluntarily. The only thing I wasn't please with was that the cheese melted out of the chicken and into the baking dish but I was able to scoop it up and put it on top of the plated chicken.  I would make this again.  And, thanks to recipe submitter gill1980.  Also, thanks to Recipe Group for choosing a recipe that I never would have; it was fun to participate and I look forward to future recipes.

I don't cook much and was looking for simple and quick, but elegant to serve for dinner. I messed up on the cutting the chicken breasts - they were totally uneven! - but I solved it by adding extra toothpicks to keep them shut while cooking. My fiance loved it and asked me to cook it again :)

Recipe Group Selection:  14, January 2012  My husband loved this dinner.  I pulled a package of boneless chicken breast out of the freezer and when they thawed they were bone-in.  Luckily they were thick enough that I just worked around the bone.  I used all the ingredients, only my cheese was fresh mozzarella discs.  I wrapped the cheese inside of ham slices.  This worked out nicely as the cheese stayed contained.  It did make ALOT of sauce.  I poured half of the sauce on the chicken and baked 25 minutes with foil on and 25 minutes with foil off.  I heated the rest of the sauce on the stovetop and added additional sauce as I was serving.  We enjoyed this and I will make again using boneless chicken breast, but will use the fresh mozzarella as it worked great in this recipe.  We heated the leftovers in the toaster oven tonight and they were as good as the night I made them.

I found this recipe to be delicious! I didn't have ham, so I skipped that part and it worked out wonderfully. I also used pepper jack cheese instead, it's my favorite. I cooked it at 400 for 30 min. and it was perfect! Will definitely make again!!

Made this for the recipe group.  My whole family LOVED this!  The sauce in the bottom of the pan is not near as disgusting looking as I thought it was gonna be from the reviews.  I guess I was expecting the worst.  I did my chicken as Sassy though and pounded it then placed the ham topped with cheese and rolled it up.  Spooned some of the sauce from the pan over the top and served with extra honey mustard sauce I had sat to the side.  Delicious!  Will definitely be making again!

I'm always looking for a new and good chicken recipe.  This one gets two thumbs up.  Here are some answers to questions that people might have: 1) Can I use Dijon instead of Spicy Brown? Yes, but use less honey  because it will make it too sweet. 2) If my oven cooks hot, how long should I cook it? Start with 30 minutes, then check it. 3) Does it have to be shredded mozzerella? No, you can use the block cheese, but I think the shredded melts faster. (I might try provolone next time myself.)  

The sauce is a little runny, but I liked it because it was easy to pour over the chicken as it cooked.  Great recipe!!!

I loved the basic recipe so I tried some small changes to use what was in my pantry. I substituted butterkase for the mozzarella, and used 3/4 c spicy mustard, 1/4 c honey mustard, and 1/2 c sour cream for the sauce. After cooking, I served it over rice and my husband liked it. It was quick and easy, which is one of my favorite characteristics of any recipe.

Recipe group selection of 1/14/12.  I followed the recipe exactly (but recalculated for 2 servings) for ingredients but like others I rolled the breasts and baked loosely covered for half the time and then uncovered for the remaining time.  Other than the fact I do not care for yellow mustard it was ok.  I have other honey mustard chicken recipes that work better for our tastes, but it was nice to try something different and I did like the creaminess of the mozzarella.  Thanks gill1980!

Made for Recipe Group. I didn't follow recipe directions. I pounded and rolled the breasts like a cordon bleu. There is no way the cheese is going to stay in the chicken otherwise. It would almost be better to put the ham around the chicken, and put the cheese on top after cooking to melt. The mustard honey sauce was great on flavor, I like that combo anyway. Covering this does lead to a thin watery liquid in the pan bottom. I just poured over the chicken after slicing. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this (belatedly) for last week's Recipe Group. My DH liked this better than I did. I don't know what to say about it except I didn't enjoy having a honey mustard sauce on my cordon bleu -- but the sauce itself was tasty and it does serve the purpose of keeping the chicken reasonably moist. I think that this would be really good with some tweaks, but I didn't do much tweaking besides pounding my chickens (they were the 5 oz Perfect Portions kind, there is no cutting them in half horizontally) and stuffing them like traditional cordon bleu. This makes a generous quantity of sauce that could be served over potatoes, rice, noodles, or steamed veggies -- there's plenty of sauce left over at the end of the baking time. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I made this for recipe group. The only changes were to use a stick of cheese rather than shredded and to save half the sauce for serving. I loved the sauce at the table but I couldn't bring myself to use the thin yellow broth in the dish. I had to scoop the cheese out of the baking dish and spread it on the chicken since not one drop stayed inside even though I wrapped the stick in the ham. Sorry this just didn't turn out how I'd like and while I would use the ingredients in a different method I won't likely be making this as written again.  I have never used this cooking method so maybe others would have expected this outcome if they have.

I made this for recipe group this week.  I thought it was great.  It had a great taste and it smelled wonderful baking.  I ended up covering it for half the time and then uncovering it for the rest of the baking time.  I didn't think it was watery at all, actually the sauce went perfect over rice.  I will upload my picture soon.  I can't wait to try this with a different cheese or perhaps some sausage. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made these for the recipe group this week. These were not my favorite. Didn't like the sauce with this chicken. The sauce, although I like the ingredients alone, I wasn't pleased with the mix with the yellow mustard. I like Ham, Chicken and Cheese combo but this sauce doesn't go with it for me. The only ingredient I added was bread crumbs to the prepared chicken. My slicing was sloppy so I ended up rolling it up cordon bleu style, securing with toothpicks then using the breadcrumbs to cover up my messy prep-work. Served with the sauce on the side also. Only used a Tbs at best of the yellow mustard. Did cover loosely with foil. For me the cheese did stay inside the roll while baking

This was super-easy and a hit with everyone in my family! It gave the appearance of a special-occasion meal, but required very little effort. I used canadian bacon rounds, a half-slice of round provolone, coarse-ground Dijon mustard and instead of 3/4 c. of honey, I only used 1/4 c. , so that the sauce was made with equal parts of Dijon, yellow mustard and honey. All of us agreed that more honey would've made the dish too sweet and this made a nice balace of sweet and savory. I baked it covered for 20 mins on 375 and then removed the foil and baked it uncovered for the remaining 20 minutes. Will definitely make it again!

I made this exactly as the recipe instructed and it came out delicious!! I was a bit concerned at first that it wouldn't taste great because it didn't require any seasoning of the chicken, but the end result was so flavorful! I drizzled the sauce over the chicken and ate it with a side of broccoli and sweet potatoes. I'll be making this again!

My super picky 11 year old asked for seconds! This turned out really well. I served it with some roasted potatoes. Next time I'll either double the amount of chicken or cut the sauce recipe in half. It was swimming in sauce so I drained a lot of the sauce off about halfway through cooking. I used thick sliced deli ham and I had some deli sliced Muenster cheese. I also didn't have brown mustard so I used 
Dijon. It turned out really well & will be a regular menu item at our house!

This recipe was awesome. Everyone in my household loves it. I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to the sauce and about 2 tablespoons of maple syrup to it also. It was so good that my husband commented on how good it was again at 10:00 at night. This will be a regular in my home. As others said in their reviews, I also did not cover it. My sauce came out thick and delicious as well did the cheese and chicken. This dish rocks. Thank you.

I had to modify because I accidentally bought chicken tenders instead of breasts.  I ended up wrapping the ham around the cheese and chicken tender, then baking, then poured out drippings (very watery) and added more cheese on top the last 10min.  But I kept the sauce the same, and the extra was a great dipping sauce!  What pleased me the most, was I found another thing that my son will eat, he is so picky! Yummy!

I have made this dish twice and really, really love it.  I use Cure 81 ham instead of deli ham and my kids can't get enough of it!  I serve it with white rice and asparagus.  Great recipe!

Make sure to get the liquid off part way through, as previously mentioned and cook uncovered or it will be soggy.  Taste is not bad if a little sweet.

I made this tonight and it was very good. Although, I did have to alter the recipe a little bit. I had chicken tenders on hand rather than chicken breast halves. I also used sliced colby jack cheese instead of shredded mozarella. I placed 1/2 slice of cheese on each chicken tender and then wrapped it with the ham. Like some others, I cooked covered for the first 15 minutes and uncovered for the remainder of the time.

Spectacular!!!  I was frying a couple of chicken breasts and thought I had a can of cream of chicken soup.  Didn't.   I mixed up the two mustards and honey, poured it over the partially cooked chicken and let it finish.  It was so tender, so very moist, so tasty, not at all sweet but the sauce was terrific on potatoes.  this will become a standard for me.  Thank you thank you thank you

I substituted Swiss in place of Mozzarella. Came out fantastic. Added a sweet potato to enhance the honey flavor. Awesome meal.

Surprisingly wonderful! I didn't have ham so I used thin sliced roast beef. I wrapped my sliced block cheese in spinach, and then roast beef. Everything stayed in place nicely after toothpicking chicken together. I prefer to bake chicken at hotter temps for shorter time, so I used another reviewers recommendation of 30 minutes at 400 degrees. Turned out wonderfully. I did NOT use foil on top and it did not turn out watery. I served this with grilled asparagus and sautéed red peppers. My husband loved it, and so did I. I will keep this recipe on hand for future use.

Made it exactly as the recipe stated and we all loved it, including my son's 3 friends. They've asked for it again so I'm making it tonight.

Simple and delicious!  I used thighs and swiss cheese just because thats what I had on hand, but the sauce is what makes it.  It would be awesome on pork too!

My 8 year old daughter agreed. "Not your best recipe, dad", she said. Really unimaginative and a mess. Either the instructions need to change cooking it without the foil or the honey mustard needs to be added later. Seemed to be a huge waste of honey and mustard.....and chicken breast.

I don't think the temperature in the oven it's the appropriate one... or the time it has to be cooked for.... it look amazing on the outside and very raw inside...

Enjoyed this last night. Had most ingredients on hand, only substituted w/ Colby cheese and my chicken breasts were a little larger, so took about an hour to bake. Was very good, moist and will make again!

Wonderful recipe! This was a simple yet very tasty chicken recipe that I will probably make a few times each month. If you're looking for something fast that tastes good and doesn't require a lengthy shopping trip this is the recipe for you.

This was easy to make and delicious. I did use cheddar cheese rather than mozzarella as it seemed to make more sense with the ham. It was a hit.

Great recipe and really easy to make! If you want a little less sweet and a little more tang in the sauce, I would replace a quater cup of honey with BBQ sauce.
