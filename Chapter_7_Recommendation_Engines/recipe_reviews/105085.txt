This was O.K. The recipe called for 1 tsp of salt, I thought this was way to much, tasted very salty. Would cut that back to half if I make again. Everyone ate it, no one raved though. Maybe made with a can of mexican corn it might have more flavor.

This was wonderful...I wasn't sure how the bread would play in this dish. But I went forth and followed it to a T. I did use day old french bread I had on hand, sliced and cubed it up. Everything else I followed. It baked and smelled quite nice. My husband loves corn but doesn't like cream style corn. Was even surprised after he promised to try it. He enjoyed this very much. The rice cereal was a total plus in my book. I might use the idea of butter rice cereal on a few recipes in place of corn flakes. Will make again. Thank you.

This is definitely different!  The only bread I had on hand was some homemade sourdough, so I used that.  I followed the recipe as written, and was very impressed with how yummy it is.  A tasty alternative to plain old corn, and it was enjoyed by all.  Thanks for sharing SAF 1969- this is a keeper  :)

I tried this at a Family Dinner they all loved it and ate every bite.
We will be having this many times in the future.

Turned out really good:) I also added a packet of onion soup mix for a little more flavor and it was just right

This sounded so interesting but I was terribly disappointed. Too much salt, little flavor, and slimy texture. I did like the rice cereal topping idea and may try it with other recipes.

I made this without the cereal twice. My family loved it and there was none left!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using korn flakes instead of rice cereal and it came out fantastic. I served it as a side to grilled chicken.  This is a quick and easy side dish.
