This was so easy and fast and juicy! I used a baguette under the 17lb turkey, one half under the breast bone and other halves on either side of that. They were completely flattened by the turkey but I added them to my stuffing and they were fantastic. 

Will definitely make again. Possibly for slightly less time by just 5 to 10 minutes.

Best Turkey ever! I followed the recipe down to the foil roasting pan. It turned out juicy and perfect! I had another turkey that I slow cooked in a slow cooker and all the guests agreed the fast upside-down turkey was more moist!

My turkey was 20lbs. I followed this recipe to a tee and it was the juiciest most delicious turkey I've ever made. Everyone loved this. Unfortunately, my bread got a little too squishy and tough in spots to eat, but it kept the breasts moist and cushioned perfectly. I also used the make ahead gravy which was perfect a well! Will use the recipe again next Thanksgiving

I wouldn't bother flipping it over. The skin on the back was no longer crispy after flipping and the breast skin did not have enough time to get good and crispy. We saved the bread and made simple bread dressing with it a few days later. The extra butter and turkey drippings made a divine dressing. The browned bread bits softened up during cooking and made it extra rich.
