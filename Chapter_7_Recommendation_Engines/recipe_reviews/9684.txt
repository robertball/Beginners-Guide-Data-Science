I absolutely love this recipe, and I have even posted another Fortune Cookie recipe on this site, as it was always my favorite, until now!  This recipe is just like the Fortune Cookies you get in a Chinese restaurant.  The thing I like most about this recipe in comparison to my other recipe, is that my other one calls for butter and yes, it does enhance the taste and yes, I will continue to use this recipe when I mold the cookies into other shapes (logs, bowls...) because the butter makes such a tasty cookie, BUT I have now, officially adopted THIS recipe when I want to put in the fortunes, because these don't put the grease spots on my paper fortune like the recipe with butter.  And no matter how I tried, I could never get around those butter/grease marks.  The key to this recipe is to make sure you make each circle VERY thin before baking to prevent a soft pancake-like center.  Follow the rest of the directions closely and you will have successful fortune cookies for your special event!

I used some of the suggestions from prior reviewers. These cookies actually come out better than expected. I used 2Tbsp of sugar instead of the 1/4 cup. I also added 2 Tbsp of butter to the mix and 1/8 tsp almond extract. I sprayed the sheet between each use. Make the cookies on the backside of the pan, it's easier to get them off quickly. I folded them in half on a cutting board, bent them on the rim of a mug and then let them cool in the muffin pan as suggested. Be careful if you are going to try to crisp the cookies by reheating them (250 degrees, 10 minutes). When they warm up again, they begin to unfold. Perhaps leaving the cookies in the muffin pan would help keep their shape.

I strongly recommend adding 2 tablespoons of butter to the batter or they will stick to the cookie sheet.  Also, we had to thin it out a bit witha tiny bit of water.  I added both vanilla and almond extact, and reduced the sugar to 2 T a batch.  I made over 100 of these for a wedding.  We had best results by making no more than 4 at a time and cooling in a muffin tin.  Also, the cookies were just not crunchy enough for my liking.  So, after they were formed, I stuck them in a 250 degree oven for about 10 minutes to get them drier.

After fumbling with two other recipes this week with more ingredients and more complicated procedure and a product I dumped in the trash bin, I was "fortunate" to find this excellent and simple recipe.  I'm so glad I didn't give up.  

I followed it as written and am very pleased with the result.

At one point I was struggling to remove the cookies from the sheets so I tried one reviewer's idea about using parchment.  I had to remove the cookies from the parchment and bake one more minute directly on the pan but this worked fine.  

I found it easier though just to omit the parchment and be sure to butter the sheet generously, spread batter evenly so edges were not too thin, and not to let them brown too much.  As long as you slide them off the sheet immediately you have plenty of time to do the rest.

Be prepared to do two batches.  Just as you get the hang of it with the first batch you'll be hooked and will want to keep the fun going!

I'm thrilled to have found this because my parents invited us out for a Chinese dinner tomorrow and with some help from the restaurant we plan to use these to announce that our first child is on the way.  (Yes, these are good enough to serve as "the real thing".)

I hope my comments help.

Thank you Aleta!

I think that these cookies taste terrific.  Now, how they look is another thing!  I got a little bit better at folding them as I practiced, but not by much!  I wanted to do a test run of these cookies prior to Valentine's Day next week-I thought it would be fun to make these for my sons' classes with little V-Day messages inside of the cookies.  I also added the butter to the batter-make sure it is melted-the first batch I used only softened butter and the batter was entirely too thick-the cookies ended up extremely "cakey".  Also, grease the heck out of those cookie sheets!  These cookies cool so quickly when they are removed from the oven-you must move quickly-even after making about 12 of these I could still only do 2 in the oven at a time-so this is definitely a lenghty process-but as in anything homemade-worth it.  I am definitely going to keep at attempting to master this-how cool to make your own fortune cookies.  Confucius say:  Try this recipe.  :)

These cookies taste wonderful!  I added 2T water to the mix and they made perfect thin circles.  I followed the high altitude suggestion and baked at 375 for 7 minutes.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and removed with a well sprayed spatula. I did not turn the cookies over before folding the paper in and found that this helped make them look more authentic; this also seemed to make the cookies more crunchy.  They are awesome and my kids keep asking for more!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipie is terrible. My first batch came out like overly sweetened pancakes. I recommend reducing the sugar to 2 tablespoons, whipping the egg whites just until slightly foamy but not solid at all, and spreading the batter so thin with the back of a spoon that you can see the pan through it. This will help you create authentic fortune cookies.

These tasted wonderful!  It took a couple of "test batches" before I got the hang of it.  400 degrees is way to hot for my oven!  I baked them for about 10 minutes at 325 degrees, and they turned out beautiful.  I used my fingers to spread the batter to ensure (almost) perfect circles.  Make sure the circles are THIN before you put them in the oven or they won't turn crunchy!  Works great with Whole Wheat flour too!  =)

Had to make changes...Combine 1/4 cup flour, 3 Tbls. sugar, and 1 pinch salt; set aside. Whisk together 1 egg white, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. almond extract. Whisk in 2 Tbls. melted butter. Sift dry mixture into egg mixture and stir to mix. Continue as per original recipe BUT keep in mind: your first 2-4 are going to look aweful. You'll probably need to double the recipe to get enough.

I decided to try these ahead of time so we could perfect them before our Christmas Eve Chinese Feast!  :)  I haven't tried putting the paper in yet, but I'm confident after the test run that it'll be fine.  So, here's what I did...following some tips already given by others.  1.  Reduced sugar to 2 Tbsp....plenty sweet! 2.  Added 1/2 Tbsp. of water to batter. 3.  Baked at 375 for about 7 minutes...just until edge is starting to brown and center is set.   4.  FOLD quickly!!!  In half like a taco shell, then pinch the edges together...then over an edge of a bowl or pan or something to form the horse shoe bend.   5.  Placed in muffin tin (see my picture) to keep them from unfolding.    Now, at this point, even after cooling, they are still not crispy enough to "break open".  So, once we were done, I turned the oven off...and about 10 minutes later stuck the muffin tin back in and just let it sit in there and dry out.  They got a little more brown (like you are used to seeing at a restaurant)...and NICE and crispy!  More tips...I got 4 out of this recipe, but they were kinda big...so I think the "6 servings" is correct.  I made 2 at a time on a jelly roll pan sprayed with Pam...it worked perfectly.  I just formed them in my hand...wasn't too hot.  Next time I think I will double the recipe and do half vanilla and half orange extract.    THANK YOU for this recipe!!!  I'm not trying any others...this is the one, it just needed a little tinkering to make it perfect!

I know it is cheating, but if you use butter flavour instead of vanilla, they will taste like the buttery recipe ones, and still not have grease spots!  (I used 1/2 vanilla extract and 1/2 butter flavour and they were awesome.)

Before tackling this project, I read most of the reviews for tips.  I made my "test" batch exactly as For the "real" deal, I reduced the sugar by 1/2, used parchment paper (no sticking at all), 3 cookies at a time and put them into mini cupcake tins immediate after shaping.    The best idea was to place the cookie filled tins back into the oven (after baking is complete and oven turned off) for about an hour in order to let the cookies completely dry and darken a bit.  They turned out crispy enough to break just like in a restaurant.  Making over 100 as part of a bridal shower favor for my son's wedding.....very time consuming but cheaper than ordering them with custom "fortunes".  I'll probably dip the edges into a little melted chocolate and sprinkle with rainbow jimmies.  MMMMMMM!!!   Hope the guests love them!

This recipe is one of the best I have found yet.  For my first attempt I followed the recipe exactly, but in retrospect I wish I would have listened to some of the other reviewers about cutting down the amount of sugar.  Here were some technique modifications I made that were extremely helpful:  Use a silicon baking mat (Silpat, etc) on a baking sheet that has been flipped upside down.  It will save you from the nightmare of having to grease your pans!  I started out using a spatula to remove the cookies from the mat, but kept ruining the edges.  After awhile I found that I could just peel them off using my hands without sustaining any burns (the cookies were actually really easy to handle).  I just flipped the cookie upside down onto a thin tea towel in my hand, and continued with the folding.  I only had one mat, so I would cool it off by shaking it in the air for a few seconds (after brushing off crumbs) and then placing onto a new pan (cool pans work best, or the cookies will start to cook as you spread the batter).  Final note: add a little bit of orange food coloring to the batter.  They add food coloring into the mass produced ones to give them that nice color, and I found that it gave me a more authentic look (just a little, don't over do it!)

With few modifications -- these turned out GREAT!  And were a hit at the office.

My suggestions from original recipe are to:  1) only use 2 TBS of sugar; 2) add 1/2 TBS of water to egg/vanilla; 3) do not use butter on pan, but do spray with PAM, wiping off excess between each batch.

I get about 12 cookies with one batch of batter.

Use gloves for handling the cookies when they come out of the oven for shaping.  Only bake 4 at a time for 4 min. at 350 deg.  A tip for shaping is as soon as these come out of oven, use spatula to remove from pan and place in gloved palm of hand.  WORK QUICKLY by using handle of spatula and press into the cookie / palm to make crease, so cookie resembles a "taco shell", resulting in half-moon shape with open top.  Place fortune inside.  Finish pinching outside edges together to form half moon (your cookie should look like a taco shell with the edges pinched together).  Using the edge of the hot baking sheet, place the "taco shell" flat edge (bottom of the cookie) on the hot baking pan edge and gently pull the pointed edges down.  The hot pan assists in helping to form the "crease" that is characteristic of the fortune cookie.

I live in Florida and the humidity is very high, thus causing the cookies to be rather limp, moist and way too chewy.  So if this happens to you, I suggest allowing cookies to cool for an hour or overnight.  Then, return all of the cookies to a baking sheet, bake at 200 deg for a total of 28 min. (turning them after 7 min.

My daughter and I made these for a school project.  They were pretty easy to make.  We read the comments before we made them, so we did add some water.  Do add at least 1 teaspoon of water. The suggestion to cool in the egg carton was great - thanks for the tip.  Thanks for providing us with the recipe and comments.

I made about 4 different batches.  I used less sugar as I found that a batter than was thinner worked better.  But a great tip I figured out was this....use an egg carton(usually the one you are taking your eggs out of) and when you quickly shape the cookie over the edge of the measuring cup, pop it quickly points down into a spot in the egg carton and it firms up perfectly and gives you the time you need to shape the next one before it cools on the pan.  The process was much quicker

I guess this recipe is pretty much covers the basics of a fortune cookie recipe. but what i did is i added 1/4 tsp almond extract, 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch and 1 1/2 tbsp veg oil (you can use melted butter here). The batter will turn out rather sticky and just slightly runny. I cut out a circle on a milk carton box and slather the batter on top of the circle ,scraping the remaining batter off the circle using an offset spatula to get even sized cookies. I also found out that to get the middle to puff nicely, you shouldn't pinch the circles together, instead just lightly hold both ends of the folded circle and place at the rim of a bowl or a spatula.

Last year I tested a few different recipes for FC's on this website. They were all delicious, but unique in their own way.
This week I used this recipe, and was flabbergasted. I couldn't believe how well they turned out! They are crunchy and not burned. 
To spread the cookies, I sprayed my cookie sheet with cooking spray, then wiped with a paper towel. I dropped a spoonful on the sheet, then using the back of the spoon I spread it in a circle. It made a, almost perfect, circle, was thin enough to not come out cakey. I repeated the cooking spray & towel wipe for each time I reused the cookie sheet.
I also changed the Vanilla to Almond extract. Everything else I did exactly as it says in the recipe.
Great taste!!! So excited to whip up a couple batches!!

I don't know what happened with the other reviewers, but mine came out great!  I made them for the store 3 times now, putting funny little sayings inside.  They turned out great every time.  :-)))))

This seems like the easiest recipe I've found, and the reviews are great - I haven't tried it yet, that's why it only gets 4 stars.

I have a question though - as far as the actual fortunes go, do you have any advice as to what kind of Ink to use? (Pen, Marker, Printed) and paper (can you use colored paper?) I know these questions seem silly, but I don't want to end up with ink all over the actual cookie. 
Thank you.

This is a great recipe, thanks for sharing!  Here are a few tips...  I made the recipe as stated but added 2Tablespoons of melted butter.  The batter thickens as it sets but that is ok.  I made a template by cutting a 3" diameter circle from a peice of plastic (like a butter bowl lid).  They key to these turning out correctly is 1- the whiping of the egg, and 2- keeping them thin.  I used parchment paper on my cookie sheets and did not grease it.  Make sure you whip the egg ad vanilla until it is very frothly but not stiff peaks.  Using an offset icing spatula really helped in spreading the batter in the template circle and getting it smooth and thin.  I baked about 5 minutes then pulled them out (I was able to do 3 per sheet), using a heavy duty hot glove and a long icing spatula I managed to fold the cookie with the spatula, touch with gloved hand and pick it up and bend over a coffee cup rim.  The regular standard mufin pan helped keep their shape until they cooled.  I made 3 batches, the first turned out great, the second turned out chewy - then I figured out it was the whipping of the egg that I did not get stiff enough so I tried it again and it worked out great.  Hopefully the kids and the teacher will enjoy these as much as I did making them.

I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheet and I was able to spread the batter nice and thin and even and the cookies peeled right off when I took them out of the oven!  I did add a little butter to the batter and I only worked with 2 at a time because the cookies cooled really quickly.

these were not good. they were really chewy, too sweet, and did not fold right. i tried baking them longer and adding less sugar, but that didn't help.

We have rewritten this recipe to make it easier to folow. We replaced the ingredient egg with egg white as it should have been and altered the instructions for simplicity and clarity based on suggestions from reviewers.

You have got to be kidding. This recipe does not work AT ALL. Too little liquid, and if you add water/oil it works, but they come out CHEWY. Who ever heard of a chewy fortune cookie???

I have been wanting to try these for some time.  This seemed like the simplest recipe, although I had to tweak it a little.  I added a little water to thin the batter and baked for 9 minutes at 400F on a GREASED silicon baking sheet.  These taste best the browner they get, but are inpossible to fold if they are completely brown.  I thought about putting them back into the oven to dry them out.  I found another reveiw that said to put them into a 250 oven in the muffin tin for 10 min.  I will try this next time.  I really want to bake these for xmas cookies, but they are very time-consuming.  Be prepared to mess up the first couple batches.

These fortune cookies were GREAT!! =) I added a tsp. of almond extract and people LOVED the taste. I also used regular all-purpose flour (didn't have unbleached) and the middles came out a bit whiter and the edges were a bit more brown, but it still tasted great! Used teflon cookie sheet and did four at a time - got like third-degree burns on the tips of my fingers folding the fortunes in there before it hardened, so next time I will use tongs (I wasn't thinking). Also, the fortunes should be no longer than 3 inches -- I made them four inches long and they were sticking out of both sides of my cookies. Then again, mine were only about 2.5 inches in diameter when spread out on the cookie sheet. Fold quickly before cookie hardens, and definitely use the empty egg carton to help retain the shape of the cookie. Last thing -- I made it for my Bible study group, so I put encouraging Scripture verses in there instead of fortunes. =) Fun!

For high altitude it worked better to lower the temperature to 375 degrees and cook for about 7 minutes.  I was surprised they turned out so great!  I am going to try the modifications with butter and almond extract next time, however.  Fun!

Impressive. They look and taste just like the real thing, and are good for presantation.
I like to give out big (HUGE) Fortune cookies for gifts, filled with something nice... 
PS--if the cookie cools before you can get it off the pan, put it back into the oven for 
a few minutes. It softens that way.

Happy Baking! :-)

Make it as written!!!

I tried a previous review of half the sugar and 1T water - yuck.  They were so rubbery.

As for technique, this is how I did it and they were easy to work with

Silpat mats rubbed with butter and placed on heavy cookie sheets. Batter spread thin, baked in my convection oven at 400F for 6 1/2 minutes or until you get the right color.  Take the sheet out the oven, flip the cookie BACK ONTO THE MAT, add fortune, fold in half and drape over glass.  (Keeping the mat on the sheet keeps the cookies hot and pliable to fold in half even as you work with them.

Take the mat off the sheet and wave it around to cool it down (if you don't do this the next batch will start to cook on the mat and be hard to spread and a grainy texture), place mat on counter (NOT on hot cookie sheet), rub with a bit of butter.  Spread next batch of cookies.  

I also found that having two sheets in rotation going into and out the oven every three minutes really cut down on prep time and gave me just enough time to fold 3 cookies and spread three more.

What didn't work: parchment paper.  Also baking directly on the sheets because my sheets were still too hot by the time I was ready to spread the next batch and they cooked as I was spreading them.  Ended up like scrambled eggs.  Don't use spray, use butter.  Too hard to spread with spray.  They need to "grip" the mat not slide around on it.

I had tried another recipe before this one they did not turned out good at all. After the reading the reviews I decided to try this one and have to say with the suggestions of "Angie C. dated Dec. 19, 2009, they came out perfect! I did add just a tad of Almond Extract and I kept the sugar the same at the original recipe.  I think the key to this recipe is adding the water (I just kept adding water till it was a slightly runny consistansy). You will not be dissapointed.  :)

I'm giving these 5 for cuteness.  My daughter and I used this recipe to ask a boy to a dance.  We made big ones and put a homemade fortune into it- the invitation to the dance.  The taste was not like a conventional fortune cookie, but they didn't taste bad. Not 5 star taste though:)  Here is what I did learn.  We put 2 on a baking sheet.  The grease actually makes it difficult to form the circles (the dough just slides down the sheet) and tilting the pan is the easiest way to get a uniform circle.  I found it easier to put them on a silipat sheet with no grease.  They did not stick, but where a little tricky to get up.  The key is a wide spatula for sure and plastic worked better then medal for me.  I also kept the second cookie on the baking sheet while working (folding) the first one because I learned with the first batch that if you let them cool even slightly they will break when you fold them up.  We put these in a cute chinese take out box.  Thanks for sharing.

So these were pretty tasty.  I wound up putting my cookies back into the oven for a few minutes to get them to breaking consistency.  They never browned, though.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I had my husband open these as part of a scavenger hunt for his 30th birthday and they turned out great!  They tasted just like those we get at the Chinese takeout restaurant. I used the advice from several reviews to aid in my preparation; but overall this recipe was very easy to use.  I was successful on my first batch, which is saying a lot since I don’t often get it right first.  Using a glove to shape the cookies was helpful, and beating the eggs until frothy was very important in making the cookies not too chewy.  I tried parchment paper on the first batch and they were hard to scoop off of the paper; so on the next try I sprayed a little cooking spray onto the paper.  Although it was a little more tedious shaping the batter into pancakes, they scooped off so easily and made it easy to do 3 or more at a time.  I will definitely use this recipe again!  Thank you Aleta and all reviewers!

This recipe was very good! We used coffee extract instead of vanilla and added a teaspoon of cocoa to make mocha flavored ones! They were delicious and were more more uniform in color than the plain ones.

These cookies were excellent. They were a little hard to fold, but they tasted great. I adjusted the recipe a little though. I added 2 teaspoons of mellted butter and decreased the sugar to 3 tablespoons.

Awesome!  These were super fun and easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was add a bit of water to the batter to thin it out a little.  Otherwise they turned out great.  They obviously don't look as good as store bought fortune cookies but they taste great and are way more creative.  We're going to use these to reveal our baby's gender to our family!

I read a LOT of reviews and made adjustments as many suggested. They came out great.  After I was all done, I put them on a cookie sheet and put in a 200 oven for 1-1.5hrs to crisp up so they'd "break," also suggested by others.

I have made fortune cookies in the past and they always came out eggy.  These tasted great.  I did add a little water to the batter to make them spread a little easier and I used splenda for baking in place of the sugar. It was a wonderful low calorie, no fat cookie.  Once they are done you do have to move fast, so only bake a couple at a time.

Such an easy recipe!  I used my Silpat when making this recipe and had no problems with sticking at all.  It saved time, too, since I didn't have to spray the cookie sheet.  I doubled the recipe, but I found that it made about 10 cookies, which was perfect for what I wanted.

I have never considered making fortune cookies but decided it would be a fun way to announce our coming addition. So I braved the looming possible results and after I realized that you fold them with the underside in, they turned out great. Also, I took the advice of other reviewers and added a small amount of water to get a pancake batter consistency. Worked out awesome! I will put them back into the muffin pan to crisp if they don't on there own by saturday. Also, if you like your cookies with both ends touching like I do, use the first couple of open ended oops ones and when you get the latter ones folded put the ends into the open ended cookies to keep them together until the harden enough to set in their own. But super excited it worked and also to see the reaction of our family at the restaurant.

These cookies were such a pain to make.  DEFINITELY add 2T. of water to this recipe, and use the back of a spoon to thinly spread out the batter.  Without the water, this recipe was too thick and too sweet.  We made 20 cookies total, and each batch turned out differently than the previous one.  I had an easier time making a black forest cake.

These were great! Unusually for me, I didn't touch the recipe, and I'm glad I didn't! Although they're a little tricky to make, these would be a nice gift and taste just like the ones from the Chinese restaurants. However, this only made 9 for me, not 12.

We made these for my sisters 30th birthday..they turned out ok in the beginning and then got better as we went along-I followed the advice of others and added the two tbls of butter to the batter, and also added some water. We used the back of the cookies sheets and worked as a team, I stood by ready to add the fortunes and fold, and my mom flipped them on a cutting board. We did decrease the sugar as well, and we used the back of the spoon to make the circles on the baking sheets-tilting the sheets didn't seem to work well. They still came out sort of chewy, but they look really cute. Good luck!

Followed hints in reviews (added butter, lemon extract, made sure spread out batter, put in muffin tin).
A big help is to spray Pam on both sides of spatula before removing each 2 cookies. Worked great!

It took me 2 times to get this down, but now it's so easy! Here are my tips: try adding a little almond extract (maybe other extracts like lemon would be good too) in addition to the vanilla for a little pizzazz, turn the cookie sheet over and place the dough on that side to bake, work fast when they come out of the oven, quickly fold, shape it and place 2 in a muffin tin to hold the shape. I found the step with the measuring cup too time consuming the first time and my cookies cooled off. Once you get the pattern, it's a cinch! I can't wait for my guests to discover our wedding announcement "fortunes" at my wedding on April 7th!

It took me 4 tries bit I finally conquered this cookie!!  I wanted a giant version and used a 14x2 round cake pan.  What I learned:  400 oven is too hot - lower to 350.  VERY generously butter the pan.  Use SUPERFINE sugar.  Do not OVERBEAT the egg whites - makes the batter too thick.  Just loosen them up till a bit frothy.  For my cookie, I used 3 egg whites, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp each of vanilla and almond exract, which I beat together.  For the perfect color, I added 5 drops yellow and 1 drop red food coloring. I also added 1 tsp cornstarch to the flour and salt.  Baked 6 mins and came right off the pan.  After I formed the cookie, I turned off the oven and put the cookie back in with the door open to crisp.  SUCCESS at last!!!

I had SO MUCH FUN DOING THIS!!! Doubled the recipe, Make cookies x3 at a time, would not do more than that otherwise its hard to fold them before they cool too much to hold their shape. Used the handle of a measuring cup to bend them, and cooled in a cupcake tin! Worked wonderfully :)

I dropped the batter onto the pan with an ice cream scoop then turned the spoon over to use the curved part to smooth batter in a circle.  My cookies cracked a little but it is nothing compared to the fun and creative messages one can create.  I did add a little milk also to thin it out a bit.  Thank you.

These were good, and most impotantly, fun to make! We followed one reviewer's suggestion and added a little melted butter to the batter. It still needed to be thinned down with a little water. We ended up using non-stick spray on the cookie sheet for easier removal. This lessened the baking time by about a minute. My daughter had fun coming up with "fortunes". Her little sister got one that said "Always wear clean underwear". Good times!

You don't need to add butter just spray your pan. Make sure you use an even pan, mine are all bent and it did effect the cookies. You have to work fast but the job is easier if you wear gloves... i have a pair of "dish gloves" that i use only for food projects.. they worked great! Oh and double the recipe--- because some of your cookies will not work out...

Good flavor. I had to add a little water to thin out the batter otherwise it would have made a very thin sugar cookie. Spreading on a heated cookie sheet made it much easier to spread. If you can get your hands on some Watkins Danish Pastry extract use it in place of the vanilla~ amazing! I will definitely use this recipe again. If you live in a high humidity area like Florida, serve the same day you make them or they get sticky.

Followed directions exactly. Spray pan, wipe before spreading batter. Have a helper put the fortune down for you to save time. I did two cookies at a time. If they get too brown, they'll crack, but too white and it'll be chewy. Use a mini-muffin tin to hold the ends in place til cool. Beautiful!

Best when eaten right away. They got really chewy - never really got crunchy like the ones from restaurants.

I have never made fortune cookies before.  Due to the fact that the recipe said to "tilt the sheet to move the batter into round shapes," I was expecting a "batter" similar to pancake batter.  What I got was a paste.  I used a large egg.  Would an extra-large egg work better?  I think it might be beneficial here if the recipe would state what size egg to use, since the egg white and the vanilla are the only liquids used.  I whipped my egg white to frothy, as stated in the recipe, but when I added the quarter cup each of flour and sugar, the whole mixture formed a paste.  I added a tiny bit of water, but I wasn't sure what exact consisteny I was going for.  Needless to say, I had to manually spread my paste on the baking sheet.  My cookies came out too thick and would not fold properly.  They had nice flavor, but they were very unattractive.  I'll try them again another day with an extra-large egg white, or maybe even a whole egg.  If I get better results, I'll bump up my rating.  For those who had a problem with the cookies sticking, I use a baking spray -- the kind with the flour in it -- and nothing EVER sticks.  Although, adding butter might help the consistency.  Reading the reviews, it seems like most of the people that had success with this either reduced the amount of sugar or increaded the amount of liqid.

This was a delicious light crispy recipe.  Those who rated this low, may not have got the technique of folding correctly.   I actually found it difficult to bend over the sharper edge of a cup to form the shape.  The cookie tended to tear or crack, but using a pot handle, which  create a less sharp bend to the fortune cookies worked better for me.

I added 1 Tbsp water, which thinned these perfectly. I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract, though next time I am going to try to add about the same of lemon, as the fortune cookies I really like have that lemony hint. I would also reduce the sugar to 2 Tbsp. My last batch, I was making for the kids to just eat and I poured the batter into a cookie sheet and cooked it in a big pancake. I flipped it out on the cutting board and used 4" cookie cutter to cut rounds. They made the most gorgeous looking cookies of all! Plus, if you are inserting fortunes, the scraps make good snacks for the kids and you don't have to let them have full-made cookies that you work so hard to make for the guests.

I was so excited to find this recipe. 
I doubled the recipe and added a few TBL water and a bit of oil to the batter.The hardest part at first was shaping it so I devised this method after a few tries: I placed a kitchen towel on the table and on top of it a piece of wax/baking paper. Then I placed the flat cookie hot out of the oven on it, inserted fortune and quickly sealed it(keeping my hands on opposite side of towel) and placed in muffin pan to cool. Give yourself a couple hours for this since you can only make about 2-3 at a time.

These actually came out great. I followed a previous user's suggestion and added 2 teaspoons of water to the batter, but the rest of the recipe I kept the same. I found it difficult to evenly cook the cookies though, so I let the batter spread to larger circles than the finished product, and when I removed them from the oven, I used a round cookie cutter to cut out a circle from the center that was not burned or overly brown (I picked a cutter that would make my cookies the size of a store bought fortune cookie). This worked absolutely perfectly. I also recommend following other users suggestions and making the circles as thin as possible. I made one that was too thick and it turned into a soft cookie instead of a crunchy fortune cookie (even when shaped as a fortune cookie it still never became crunchy). My guests were all thoroughly impressed and every one of them thought they looked and tasted authentic. Great recipe!

I had to make this recipe twice because the first time the cookies had more of a dough like texture than a cracker (crunchy) one. I used a little less flour and added a tsp of butter and I got the perfect fortune cookie. These taste sweet like a sugar cookie but be careful and make sure you make them thin enough or it just won't work out for you. Pretty fun once you get the hang of it!

Turned out really well!  I sprayed parchment paper with oil and made them paper thin, literally - it's ok if you can see through them a little.  I drew 3" circles on the opposite side of the parchment so that I could make evenly round.  I followed the ingredients exactly and found it made a dozen perfectly... if you can only make 6 like I read on a review, then maybe they're not thin enough.  DEFINATELY use cotton gloves - or you'll find yourself using your sleeve.  Your first batch should be a trial batch - Although I only tried doing 3 at a time, I could probably handle making 4-5 at a time.

Loved these, were simple and fast to make once I got the hang of it.  Added some water to the batter 1 tsp at a time to make them thin enough to spread by tilting the pan.  The circle shapes will NOT come out perfectly circular, but it doesn't matter, once they are folded no one will know (or care).  They taste great, and as long as you keep them in an airtight container, they stay crisp for quite a while.

These were definately tricky, but worth it.  They make an excellent presentation and people think you're Martha Stewart when you announce that you made the fortune cookies!  I used a silcone baking mat sprayed with Pam to keep the cookies from sticking (essential).   I would also recommend baking the cookies until they are more brown than white. The white part of the cookie stays chewy.

I found this cookie to be overly sweet it uses equal amount of sugar and flour. I also found that the cookies stuck a bit too much for my taste I was able to fold the and make them fine.I added a bit of melted butter to the batter and it helped quite a bit with the sticking. I would if I were to make these again adjust the recipe quite a bit.

Wonderful idea for parties.  I used them for a baby shower and incorporated them into a game.  Instead of putting a fortune inside, I put the first line to a nursery rhyme on a slip of paper.  Everyone drew a cookie and had to recite that nursery rhyme.  Another idea... Dip in colored almond bark for a particular occasion.  Good Luck and happy eating!!!

When I was mixing the batter, I'd already formed my opinion that these would be terrible!!!!  However, they did turn out okay, with some adjustments.  I quadrupled the recipe, which may have something to do with it.  I needed 24 cookies.  I followed the recipe, but it never mentioned anything about using the egg yolks, so I didn't.  Were they supposed to go into the cookies?  The batter was very thick, and there was no way it would pour.  I added skim milk by the tablespoon until it was thin enough to run.  After that, everything went okay.  They wouldn't stay folded around the measuring cup, and I found that if I just sat them on the counter in the folded position they stayed closed.  The taste was wonderful!  They taste and look just like the restaurant kind, after trial and error!!!!

They tasted good and my four year old had fun helping me make them. They were pretty easy, I only had to make two for a test batch to get used to the folding and how long they need to be cooked. They weren't crunchy but I actually preferred them softer. They kind of tasted like an ice cream cone.

Although it's a bit tricky to get right at first, the cookies are delicious, and once you get the hang of it the effort is really pretty minimal. I found an added tablespoon of water was necessary to make thin enough cookies (otherwise, they wouldn't get crisp for me), and added a little more vanilla to suit our personal tastes. Now, whenever I make bread with an egg yolk wash, I use the remaining egg white to make fortune cookies, and my family loves it.

For taste, this recipe deserves 5 stars. It was very simple, quick, and delicious. The only problem was that i couldn't get the cookie off the cookie sheet. First i used ungreased, then ungreased tin foil, and then greased tin foil. non of it worked.

The batter was too think so I thinned it out, but the cookies still did not turn out crispy. I think I will just stick to buying them from the Chinese restaurant.

Very good tasting cookie and plenty crispy.  Baked for 6 minuets.  Had trouble spreading batter in perfect circles.  I'm going to try adding 2T of water to the batter to help this as suggested by others.

Couldn't get them brown on the inside.  I don't know why, it may be because I used regular all-purpose flour.

These had a yummy sweet taste (I kept the sugar at 1/4 cup, it was a bit sweet, but good). I added almond extract as well, and I think that was a lot of what the good taste was. I'm really unsure if the proportions are really correct or not. My oven cooked them a lot faster, 400 was too high. I did about 4 minutes at 375. Later on they got soft, even though they were very crunchy before (perhaps the muggy weather outside?) and I tried to re-crisp them in the oven but they burned! So don't make my mistake!

Excellent! I don't care for the taste of store bought fortune cookies, but this recipe was great! I tripled the batch because I was taking them to a potluck. I also did as suggested by a previous post & did half vanilla & half imitation butter. I also lowered the heat in the oven to 385. My oven is a bit weird & uneven so they didn't look as pretty as the picture, but good enough. My kids can't wait to make them again

I love this recipe! I added butter to the batter and generously greased up the pan before each batch. They were easy to shape and a lot of fun to make. Easier than I imagined. The hardest part was writing my own fortunes. They're not as smooth as a fortune cookie you'd buy but they look great.

Sorry-As submitted, this recipe is disappointing. It worked out only when I added 2T of butter and some water. And even then, I never got the pretty all over golden color featured in the picture. I kept trying and made it several times. This was to be a gift, but I'm a little too embarrassed to give it now.

Great fortune cookies! My 11 yr old daughter and I made these for her class Chinese New Year party at school. All of the kids loved them! Great flavor! It did take me a few tries to get the folding down, but they were a lot of fun...and delicious!

These were yummy!!  And defiantly easier than I thought they would be.  I did add 2 Tbsp. melted butter, and I doubled the recipe and got exactly 2 dozen.  The cookies that were not SUPER thin did end up being a bit chewy, so I recommend spreading super thin if you want a traditional crunchy cookie.

These are really good.  I have a few suggestions. If you want them crunchy, place them back in the oven for about 5 minutes once you have folded them. I made about a dozen (this was recipe x2) put them in the cup of a cup cake pan and put them all back in the oven together. It is not necessary to do this immediately. Also, use SUPERFINE sugar only. if you don't the texture is way off and it almost tares when you fold it. If you don't want to purchase superfine sugar then just put regular sugar in a coffee grinder for about 10 seconds.

this is the best fortune cookie recipe!  My 15 year old daughter made them with her friend, and honestly, I didn't think they were going to come out that well, but they were perfect!  They actually taste and look like actual fortune cookies! so easy and fun to make with ages 9+!!!  VERY GOOD!

My neice and I tried this 4 different times trying to get the cookies to get flat and pliable. They tasted good but we just could not get them to fold without cracking. We even tried to add water to get them thinner and moved quick while they were hot but no good. Not worth the effort we put into it

Absolutely so fun! Used only 2 Tablespoons of sugar and added a Tablespoon and a half of water. As well as Almond flavoring (about the same as vanilla).

not bad, took the others advice and lessened the sugar to 2 Tbs. and added 1/2 Tbs water--also subbed almond extract for the vanilla.  MUCH easier to work with than other recipes I tried, after the tweaking it was a fun recipe!

I made these to take to an Asian themed dinner party...so I wouldn't show up empty handed.  They were a big hit.  Its cool that you get to write your own fortunes (maybe even dirty ones).  They taste pretty good to  (and I don't even like the taste of fortune cookies).  The high altitude recommendation worked great and you should add a little bit of water.

I didn't add any water to the batter.  It's thick, but I just spread it into a circle using a rubber spatula.  I also had more luck with using parchment paper (sprayed with a little bit of noon-stick spray) on top of the cookie sheet.  It was a little tricky folding them...mine weren't pretty shapes, but they held the pieces of paper ok.  The hardest part was thinking of something original to write as a fortune!

these looked and tasted very good.  it was a little hard to get the little papers out of some of the cookies, but everybody liked them and thought they were cute.  don't think we'll be doing this any time soon though because the process was very tedious and time consuming since we could only do about 3 at a time.  you really have to work fast with these otherwise the cookie will crack as you're forming it.

After all the great reviews, I thought I found the perfect recipe. I had a problem with this recipe. They stuck really bad and I couldn't peel them off the sheet. I ended up serving them flat. However, they get 5 stars for taste.

The taste is great, but the original batter is too thick.  The second time around I added only 2/3 of the dry mixture and a little bit of water to thin it.  This time they came out great!  Good recipe, it just needs some individual tweeking.  :)

This recipie is terrific! In my first few tries, the cookies stuck to the sheet, and by the time I pried them off, they were too cool, and broke upon folding. 
It's not very kid friendly because it involves handling hot cookies, but my son loves to eat them! 
A few hints: Add 1-2 teaspoons of melted butter to the batter and spray the cookie sheet with cooking spray. This makes it easier to remove from the sheet. 
You can do up to 6 small cookies on a sheet if they're small and if you have a someone to help you fold! After you fold a cookie, put them in the wells of a metal 
muffin tin, to help them keep their shape. That way you don't need to hold them until they cool!

I made a double batch to get 12 cookies. They turned out really good other than when I stopped watching one pan and got them quite crunchy and dark. I did as suggested and use the cookie sheets upside down and covered in lard. I also reduce the sugar to half the amount called for in this recipe.

Okay.... I am PICKY!  I wanted the perfect recipe and this is IT.  I scaled the recipe up to 96 servings since I was wanting to make them for friend's kids for Valentine's Day. The ONLY thing I changed was adding water so that the consistency was *much* thinner. I did figure out some tips that make it much easier!  
HERE IS WHAT WORKED AWESOME ::  USE A LARGE ELECTRIC GRIDDLE ON 225.  Take non-stick foil and score 8 - 3" diameter circles on the non-stick side and place it on the griddle.  Spray it lightly with oil.  Put the thinned out batter into a squeeze bottle (the kind that are sold with icing supplies) and trace the first circle with batter and then do a large blob in the middle and then fill in the circle and move quickly to the next one..... allow the 8 circles (or fewer) to cook but NOT too long.... I found it worked better to flip them BEFORE they got light brown.  And WHEN YOU TURN THEM.... flip the entire piece of foil over and I used a hand towel to rub each circle.  Allow them to cook about 2 minutes and MAKE SURE to use a spatula to gently ease the small "pancake" off that you made first.  Work quickly to put it on the counter, place the fortune in and use the spatula to fold in half and then use a coffee mug with a thicker edge to do the last fold - I had to use a tea towel to keep from burning my fingers!  (NOTE:: one last thing I did do was add almond flavoring and a few drops of yellow food coloring and one of red to get an authentic color)  PERFECTION!

This recipe is delicious... I did add the 2Tbs of water to the batter. When I baked it I baked it at 350F for 2 mins, rotated them, then for another 2mins. After I shaped them I put them in a muffin tin and baked them until golden brown. They went great with my beef and broccoli dinner.

Fun and easy and tastes like it should! I added 1 Tbsp of water to the batter to make a thinner consistancy for spreading.

While I appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients and ease of preparation, I feel like this recipe was over-simplified. The cookies had the taste of fortune cookies-- mostly. The dough was hard to work with, the edges browned in the oven before the middle was cooked, and they were very hard to form into fortune cookie shape. When done baking, the edges were crispy and the middle was still puffy.

Wonderful! These cookies are so much tastier than restaurant Chinese ones. I am 14 and these are so easy to make. Its okay to use 1/4 tsp of vanilla if you over measure by mistake. My only recommendation is: ADD A TABLESPOON OF WATER!! It is completely necessary. If you don't at first, you will quickly. Be quick about folding. These are great.

Followed the recipe as written and, after many test cookies, created one perfect one. I had not made fortine cookies before, so I had to get used to the technique. I tried to use parchment paper, but found that it was best to butter the pan and spread the batter on it. I can't imagine doing a large number of these without a helper! They sure taste better than store bought fortune cookies.

not sure if it's an altitude thing but my cookies stuck to the baking sheet.  After reading reviews of others having this issue, I added melted butter to my batter.  Turned out great after that.  Good taste, easy to put together, just very hot on the finger tips, ended up using paper towels to grab the cookie ends with.  I baked 2 cookies at a time and seemed to work well.

Loved it. My figers are a bit red (didn't use gloves) but they turned out way better than I expected. I followed the recipe to the t except for adding a tablespoon of water. They're nice and crispy all except for the very center (which might have been my fault). Should I have left them in a bit longer (I was leaving em in approx. 7 min)

I'm pretty good at baking, but couldn't get this recipe to work.  I tried.  I really tried.  I tried the recipe 2 separate times, as well as, doing things differently on each tray.  I used butter on the sheet.  I used cooking spray on the sheet.  I baked them at the right temp.  I tried to lower the heat.  The outside rim would get over baked/burnt and the inside would stay undercooked.  The flavor is good and the folding is super easy.  Don't know why.

I followed the directions and greased the pan. As soon as I took them out of the oven, they were very hardened. When I tried to bend them, the broke. They were only in for about 6 minutes, yet somehow they managed to get horribly burnt. My oven cooks evenly, but this recipe does not work.

These were okay. I'm sure I'll get better with more practice. They were really hard to thin out, but I'll add water next time, as suggested.

Hit and miss with a grade 12 class. A couple of groups did perfectly while others were bad.  A few suggestions: 1. Make in a large measuring cup, this makes it easier to pour the butter onto the pan. 2. Bake 3 on one cookie sheet, then 3 on aother and 3 on a third. Stagger the times that you put them into the oven so that you have a couple of minutes between them.  This way, you do not have a few that get too cold while you shape the first couple. If you fold the egg yolk back into the batter at the end, the colour will be more rich and golden - then nothing goes to waste either.

I am giving this 4 stars because they tasted good but they did not shape well for me.  I think it was may pans that over cooked them and burnt the bottoms.  They are good and I will try them again once I get different pans.

Added the 2 Tbsp butter and a little water like other reviewers talked about.  It was a little tricky to get the right shape but a couple more batches and I think I'd get it.

I was looking forward to making these so much but was very disappointed.  I made the first batch exactly as indicated but the batter was way too thick.  I added a couple of tablespoons of water which fixed the consistency but the taste was still off.  My second batch I tried with Vanilla but still a no-go.  The third batch I tried with Almond & they still didn't taste like fortune cookies.  The batter is way too sweet, I should have cut the sugar in 1/2.  I only gave this recipe' one star because no matter how I adapted the recipe' these were just no good cookies.  I was very disappointed.

These cookies are DELICIOUS!
They were a bit putsy, especially for as few cookies as you get, but they are great for writing your own fortunes!

Fabulous!  We made these for Father's Day and inserted special things the kids love about their dad in the cookies.  Great fun, and can't wait to make more custom fortunes!
I used parchment paper on a cookie sheet, lightly buttered and had no problem with sticking.

i consider myself to be a pretty decent baker, but i can not figure out what went wrong with this recipe! i thought they'd come out thin, but they puffed up in the oven, & i couldn't flatten them out. they didn't spread when baked, so they were the same size when they came out, as when i put them into the oven, & they broke while we shaped them. they do taste all right, & from a distance, look good too. but when you pick them up, you can see the cracks from folding them. next year will look for a new recipe -

I followed the other directions (adding 2tsp water and spraying the spatula with non-stick spray) and I really had no problems. The batter was runny enough, butnot too runny. I tried 3 at first but made them WAY to big; be ready it spreads in the oven! I was also really slow making them so the edges did crack, but if this happens fold them in half again and it looks like a nice flower :) - I would say go for it. My roommates all LOVED the cookie taste. It is a lot like a sugar cookie, but if you don't like sugar cookies then something is wrong! I'm at sea level and baked them as directed.

I finally got the hang of them on the last 2 or 3 cookies, but they were awesome.  My guests loved them.  I'll definately try again.

Loved this recipe! I did have a hard time folding the cookies in time b/c they ended up cracking a lot...oops. They did taste super yummy, though. :). I think with a little of practice I'll get better at making these. Try them!

I was really surprised when I tasted the batter that it was so good! I followed this recipe exactly, however I did have to add about 5 teaspoons of water (1/2 tsp at a time) I baked them for about 10 minutes, but probably could have done longer for less chewy-ness. putting them in a muffin tin is a great idea!

I'm not sure what happened, but...I followed the recipe exactly and the consistency just didn't seem right to me. I made these twice, thinking that I had maybe messed up the first time, but it came out exactly the same both times. The taste was great but the consistency just didn't seem right either time. I thought they were extremely chewy. However, my boyfriend thought that these tasted great so I will probably be making these again. Thanks for the recipe.

I agree with the other reviewer who used less sugar, more flavorings and a little butter. I followed the original recipe and I think the recommended changes would have helped.  My batter was also a little thick - maybe I over-beat the egg white?  But overall a really good recipe, thank you!

This worked wonderfully.  I've tried 2 other recipes and neither ever got crispy.  This had significantly less ingredients as well.

This, I think, is the easiest way to make fortune cookies, but that's not saying much; baking fortune cookies is *really* hard work (as far as baking goes). But if you are looking to do this for the first time, this recipe is a good way to go, and the end product tastes really good.

These taste really good.  Mine looked terrible.  When the recipe says work quick, it means it.  And I suggest using an egg carton or a MINI muffin tin to hold them in shape as they cool.  My batter wouldn't spread by tilting the pan so I spread it out with dampened fingers.  Maybe I didn't get them thin enough, but mine wouldn't bend without breaking.  The kids wouldn't touch them.

I make these every year for a Chinese New Year banquet.  The only change I make is substituting almond extract in place of the vanilla.  Super easy using a silpat.  I use fortunes found online.

I made these. The original recipe is perfect. DO NOT ADD OIL OR BUTTER! It makes them thick and rubbery. They do not stick to the pan if you don’t use oil or butter.

I had great success with this recipe exactly as written.  I took several reviewers suggestion to bake on a Silpat silicon mat sprayed with oil and then lightly, very lightly wiped off, leaving a generous film.  I left a cookie sheet in the oven, and just swapped out the Silpat mats.  While one set of 3 cookies were baking I prepared another Silpat with 3 cookies. I had the best results when I made sure the circle of batter was a uniform thickness up to the edge.  This way the edges don’t get too crispy and crack when bending them over the edge of your cup.  After forming all my cookies and putting them in a mini cupcake tin, I turned them over (the bottoms were still a bit moist) and put them in the oven that I turned off earlier for about 30 minutes.  I plan to dip them in chocolate and decorate with sprinkles.

These taste really good, but I added a little bit more of vanilla and should have added a little more liquid after that. The perfect texture and taste, the batter was just too thick. I am glad I tried  it and will be perfecting it eventually :D Thank you.

loved it. super simple and easy I actually prefer to make the egg white a little bit firm it helps the dough and they wont burn as easily you do have to bake them a bit longer but that's not a big issue. would definitely recommend. Also if you make the egg whites firm then when you put It on the stone make it really thin.

This recipe does not work very well. I followed the instructions exactly yet the cookies came out puffy and each time I tried to bend them, they would break in half. Even when they were soft. I tried adding more oil, adding more eggs, adding more vanilla, and nothing work. The batter was very thick and it's supposed to be a thin batter. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone thinking of trying it.

This was awesome! I made it easily with no issues. I even dyed it red for Valentine's day. The only changes I made were taken from other comments. I added a tablespoon water and almond extract equal to the vanilla. I doubled the batch and was able to make 18 of them. I took another suggestion from the comments as well and used the silpat silicon mat sprayed with pam and wiped down with a paper towel and had no issue at all with sticking. I made them two at a time and when I was done I turned off the oven, waited 10 minutes and them put the muffin tins in the cooling oven for an hour, this made them perfectly crunchy, exactly like store bought versions only extremely tasty!

I so wanted this to work. The flavor was great. Not sure what went wrong. I even tried to add the butter as other people had suggested. But found them to be more cake like. I thought the batter was suppose to be on the thin side. So I even tried to thin the batter a little and got the same result... Argh!!!

These turned out reasonably well. Absolutely add the tablespoon of water. I tried baking on parchment (on the back side of pan) and my cookies wrinkled.  Tried non-stick foil. Success! Bonus--Cut the foil into squares and impress your round shape right into the foil. I used the foil over and over, no sticking. I did stick them all back in the oven after it cooled down a bit to finish crisping. Very labor-intensive, but worth it for an occasion.

These tasted great and were fun to make. We made them with Christmas greetings & jokes and put them in our Christmas cookies. They are not quite as crispy as the ones you get in the restaurants. It was much easier to fold them than I thought it would be, but much harder to spread the dough out into a circle than I'd anticipated. The batter is quite sticky.

I cut the sugar down to 2 tablespoons and didn't add butter because I wanted them crunchy. I also added 2 or 3 teaspoons of water to thin them. I needed 6 cookies, and I burned my first three! I corrected by turning the heat down to 375 and baking two at a time for about 4 minutes . Much better! I ended up with 7 good ones, so I know that the recipe makes closer to 10 when I make them. Be sure to take them out when they are just beginning to get brown around the edges. They firm up very quickly.

We tried the recipe and followed the directions exactly.  The batter was a bit thick which made the cookies thick.  When we folded the cookies they all cracked and were crumbly.  Taste was only fair not great.

quick, easy, what more could you want in a fortune cookie recipe?  I used a spoon to spread the batter out which worked well. You don't need to make it too thin to get a crispy finish.

When I tried these for the first time, mine came out all cakey in the middle, and way too sweet, only the edges were good. Next time, I might have to follow the reviewers comments.

Really fun to make. But it is tricky and be prepared to spend a lot of time making these. They worked well on one of my pans, but consistently forced me to chisel them off another. I'm planning on trying another batch tomorrow!

My particular cookies aren't uniform or necessarily beautiful, but they are fortune cookies! The recipe was easy, tasty and with a little practice I could do 4 cookies at a time. My daughter is thrilled to be taking them to school.

They turned out great! My only suggestion is based off another review - make sure the cookies are so thin that you can see the pan underneath. I also unfortunately had to use a new pan for each batch, otherwise I'd have to wash it.

This was my first time. I took other reviewer's advice and reduced the sugar a little. I quatrupled the recipe. Came out pretty good. Since I kept switching baking sheets, as one cooked I started another, I could see a difference in quality. I sprayed the baking sheet with butter spray.My darker pan cooked them faster. My lighter pan a bit slower. I got to the point that I just kept them in the shape of a cookie, I had so many. Also the batter should be thin and when I poured the batter on the sheet I did it in a circular motion without touching the pan, this eliminated the need to tilt the pan to form a circle. All in all the kids liked them.

i thought this was a really easy recipe for them. It was pretty good. The first time i made it  made one giant one(it was going to hold a gift card for by friends birthday gift, thought it would be a fun way of wraping it)it worked but kinda chewy. I think it was due to the size though.

I wanted to try this recipe as is before I brought them to move in day at my college with some nice fortunes inside offering good luck for the coming year.  I found them easy to shape once I found a good way of not letting them stick.  I originally used wax paper, but it did not work at all.  I put them straight on the cookie sheet, after spraying it with a hearty amount of PAM.  They came right off.  I did find this recipe a little too sweet and too thick, that is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I think when I make them for real in a few weeks, I'm going to cut back on the sugar like many of the suggestions to 2 Tbs. I also added a few tablespoons of water to thin out the batter.  It was very good once they were formed and it's going to be super fun to offer them to my friends with funny fortunes in them!

Ive tried these twice now with semi-good results. They tasted great, but i found that they were really difficult to shape - I dont know if it was because it took me too long, or because they were too thin?! But when i tried to push them gently over the edge of the glass, they often opened right up or broke. I still like the recipe but any ideas on how to make them look better?!

The recipe was good, but it was a little difficult.  I added butter because I didn't think that it was liquidy enough and had read the other reviews.  Next time, I will make the recipe as is before thinking that it might be not runny enough because with the added butter more fried looking than fortune cookie looking.  My family loved the flavor though.  You do have to be quick to fold them, and I agree not to make more than two or three at a time.  My 8 year old daughter was able to hellp me though and that was fun.  My husband said they reminded him of the waffle cones that you get at a fair.

I've made fortune cookies before that came out better. The paper soaked into the dough and was hard to pull out after it had cooled. Plus the batter ran once it baked so the size changed and they ran into each other. They tasted good though! Kinda like sugar cookies.

I made these today for an asian themed dinner party and was really nervous about them being a total bust, but they turned out really well. I would suggest thinning the batter with a bit of water because my early cookies were too thick and never really got your typical fortune cookie crispiness. Other than that, this recipe worked great!

i did this for my gcse food technolgy exam and i took me 5 attepts to get it right in the practise before i had something sutibul for the photo but for the actual thing it was perfect what i would say is hold them in a tea towel when they are firming  or they just ping out of shape (attempt 3 and 4) and make sure you get the right amount of batter on the sheet or they just come up as  big soft biscuits very yummy but not worthy of a gcse (attemt 1 and 2)

Tastewise I'd say these were a 5!  It was pretty remarkable how much they resembled storebought, but man were they difficult to work with.  First I made then too thin, then I didn't fold them fast enough, (etc).  In the end after I doubled the recipe, I only got 6 cookies done with fortunes in them.  Fun but hard!!

The batter was too thick for the cookies to be thin enough to fold after they were baked. I added a little water to the second batch and they worked quite well.

They didn't quite taste or look like the ones you get at Chinese restuarants, but not bad! I still haven't gotten the hang of folding them...it's a lot more difficult than it looks.

I love the way these cookies tasted... so sweet! It was quite difficult to get the cookies out and with the fortune in them and folded in time before the cookies hardened. I suggest having a friend to help!

I had to practice a lot before I could get the consistancy right, but once I got the hang of it, they turned out wonderfully... I used butter extract and almond extract, which made it taste yummier, I think. I also liked the idea of rolling it into cigar shapes instead of fortune cookies, and then adding chocolate inside. I tried making these into bowls for icecream and fruit, but it was much too hard to shape without cracking it.

These came out really good. I had a little trouble spreading them on a greased cookie sheet....next time I will try thinning the batter as suggested in other reviews or use parchment. I used lemon extract as I was out of vanilla. Also, I made 2 giant cookies instead of a dozen! I spread them to about 8 inches diameter and baked about the same 5min.

I found this recipe hard to work with because there wasn't enough liquid.  I had to add some water just so they would work.  Otherwise pretty good once you get the hang of it.

These did not turn out well at all! The cookies baked up too thick, and when I tried to thin them down they stuck to the pan. I could not fold them, they kept cracking. After making the batter twice and ruining it , I finally gave up! What am I doing wrong?

I had a hard time finding the right consistency for the batter.  In fact, I still have not found the right consistency.  Shaping the cookies was easy and they looked like restaurant style cookies (only bigger), however, they were far too sweet.  This is a recipe that requires a lot of practice, and I do not have the patience for that.
