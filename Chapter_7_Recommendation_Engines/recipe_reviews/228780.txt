HELP!! I so so wanted to try this fudge. It sounded so yummy! I'm a fudge making newbie so it could have totally been something I did. Again, I followed the recipe exactly too. My sugar dissolved wonderfully. I went by the thermometer which climbed slowly, and I even experimented with the "thread" and "soft ball". I stirred it constantly while boiling and it slowly thickened. Then suddenly, just before the thermometer got to 230F, it got very powdery and began to resemble cookie crumbs rather than liquid. I still followed the rest of the instructions, hopefully to salvage brittle from the fudge. Didn't happen. Id be thrilled if it's something I did wrong because I really want to try this! -Laura

The concept is awesome and the flavor isn't too bad, but I also ended up with a grainy batch of sugary sand once I was done, and I have made more than my fair share of fudge.  Even when using a candy thermometer and pulling the fudge off as soon as it hit the Soft Ball temps, it cooled into a grainy mess.  The sugar had fully dissolved at that point.  I tried reconstituting it by re-boiling it to the Soft Ball stage again, but it still failed.

For those interested in the favor and concept I'd suggest trying an easier fudge recipe using marshmallow crème and incorporate the bacon into it just after mixing in the marshmallow crème.  To add an extra maple kick, use a teaspoon of maple extract (can be found with the vanilla extract at the grocery store) to boost the flavor a little.

I followed this recipe exactly and the fudge turned out horrible. The sugar never completely dissolved so it had a grainy texture. Not sure if I did something wrong or if it's just the recipe.

We love this fudge!  The saltiness of the bacon offsets the sweetness of the fudge and my family couldn't get enough of it.  I only had regular bacon but had to make this, so I drizzled a little real maple syrup over the cooked bacon pieces.  Yum!  It takes about 30 minutes to cook the fudge, maybe a bit longer.  I'll make this again for friends!
