This is a great recipe. One of my family's favorites.  In place of the Hidden Valley Ranch Salad Dressing, I use powdeed butter milk.  Works great.

These were the best pork chops I've ever made.  I placed seasonings in a ziploc, shook them up, and put them on the grill. Great reviews from my family.

I used my own homemade dry ranch dressing mix instead of Hidden Valley (same principal, just less salt/more flavor)--other than that I made no other changes. The boys thought this was FANTASTIC, they ate every single pork chop. I served this with Baked Mushroom Rice and steamed broccoli.

This was the first time I've made pork chops like this, this they were delicious!! I read most of the reviews before making it, you like to hear others input and how I can make it better.Most of the reviews said it lacked flavor so I wanted to make sure mine had tons of flavor. I used 4 pork loin chops pretty big portion, I used a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch, a packet of the green onion dip packet added garlic powder, bread crumbs,and other spices I had in the pantry that I thought would go with pork chops, combined all the ingredients then put it all in a Ziploc bag. They coated the pork chops just perfect.it looked good before it was even cooked. I had errands to run so I left it in the fridge for a few hours. I cooked it at 400Â° for about 45min turning them once, also uncovered. They came out so juicy and full of flavor. The best chops I've had hands down.Even, my picky son set it all, and my mother in law who never raves about anything loved them when she set one the following day. This is going to be one of our favorites from now on. KiM roasted asparagus as a side. Hope this helps.

My four stars are a compromise.  I would give this five stars for ease of preparation and tenderness of the meat, but only three for flavor.

I am not a fan of pork chops, so when I say that these were fantastic, you better believe they were FANTASTIC!  I buy ranch dressing mix in bulk, so I just sprinkled it on along with a little salt, pepper, and paprika, then rubbed it in to both sides of the chops.  I baked them on a rack on the baking sheet, so the heat could circulate all around them.  My chops were only about 3/4 inch thick (maybe a little less), so I baked them for 20 minutes and they were perfectly cooked.  This one is going into our regular rotation!

We loved it BUT I didn't have Ranch. I used Green Onion dip that I got from Stater Bros chip isle. I have used it before in recipes and we love it so, I had that already. I added onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and garlic pepper to the dry dip. Man, these were so good and easy. I love not having to fry the chops. My hubby went crazy for these.  FYI: I tried it with regular Onion Dip and we didn't like it as much.

The ONLY thing I did differently was add some Panko crumbs for texture. I'm glad I found this recipe--the family LOVES it, as do I! :)

This was super easy and tasted great! The only thing different I did was not add any salt. The ranch package has enough salt. Kids loved it and my Husband like it. I also am not a pork chop fan but with this receipe it was great.

I wanted to like this based on it having few ingredients and the ease of preparation, but I was expecting more flavor. This was kind of bland.

I followed this recipe exactly - and it was awesome!  The best part - the chops come out moist - moister than any recipe I've tried in years. Definitely a great recipe!

I thought this was "okay".  Gets 3 stars because of ease of preparation, and yes the chops were moist.  but the flavor was very lacking IMHO.  I much preferred a recipe I made last week for Parmesan Pork Chops, and a coating of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.. now those got my family's thumbs up!  This recipe got a luke warm reception.. but they did get eaten all up!

This gets 5 stars from me because of how invredibly simple it is. Trust me when you are exhausted after taking care of 3 toddlers all day a quick easy meal that actually tastes great definitely earns 5 stars in my book. Made exactly as recipe stated with boneless chops about 1/2 thick. They were a little salty. I used a seasoning packet that said Ranch Dips. Not sure if that is the exact same thing as the regular ranch packet but it was great. next time I may use a few more pork chops or a little less seasoning. Still 5 stars though. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely will be making this again. I almost felt like I got to take a night off from cooking.

I had boneless thick pork chops, so that's what I used. Increased cooking time to 30 minutes. Other than that didn't change a thing. Very moist & fantastic flavor. LOVED them.

I was looking for a quick, easy, healthy meal with  items I had on hand and this one fit the bill. EXCELLENT!! This one goes in the permanent cookbook and will be a go-to meal often. I placed all of the ingredients in a big baggy and massaged the meat and the seasoning until evenly spread.Give it a try, you won't be sorry.

This is a nice quick "go to" recipe when you don't have energy. I did not use all of the ranch seasoning because I thought it would be too salty...next time I will use more...

Here' s the problem- One packet is not enough to provide the proper flavor. If you just sprinkle the packet over the chops, they're bland. If you put the seasoning in a bag and shake the chops in it, you'll have enough for 2, maybe 3 fat chops. I may try this recipe again given how easy it is, but it's just as easy to douse the chops in rosemary, thyme, basil and garlic.

Followed instructions, however, I baked it at 400 degrees for 30 min. My husband is not a big fan of pork chops and loved this recipe.

I lined my smaller roaster with tinfoil for easy clean up, reduced the heat to 400, and added halved potatoes and baby carrots on top of the pork steaks. (oh, I used pork steaks.) I cooked it for about 30 minutes, or until the potatoes were done.  It was great!  I love one pot meals!

These were a little bland.  Super easy, but they need more flavor.

Loved this recipe.  It was so easy and my family loved it.  Will definitely make these again.  I made the large boneless pork chops and kept them in for 40 minutes.  Came out very juicy but I could have shortened time a few minutes. Made these with red potatoes (sprinkled with remaining pkg of hidden valley ranch) and asparagus topped with shaved Parmesan cheese. What an awesome meal!!!!

These were tasty.  I had boneless thinner chops so I just cooked mine 10 minutes on each side and they were perfect.

Made this tonight.  Super easy, moist and delicious.  Served with Uncle Ben's Sundried Tomato Florentine Rice Pilaf and green beans.  This will become a regular on my menu.

Wow ..... I doubled the amount of Ranch powder and the four pork chops were just OK with this seasoning.  (I was disappointed!)  What I was impressed with was how MOIST the chops were!!!  I need to put this into a memory bank for future pork chop recipes.

I thought these turned out really good. I was a little skeptical of how ranch would taste on pork chops but my husband and I liked it. I did mix garlic salt in with the ranch seasoning and it gave it more of a garlic flavor.

I was really hesitant to try these because using ranch seasoning seemed a little strange to me.  These were really good though.  The flavor is not overwhelming and doesn't taste like ranch.  Both my husband and I really liked them.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because they didn't smell good coming out of the oven.  The scent was actually quite bad, and my husband immediately asked what it was when they finished cooking.  We almost threw them out without even trying them.  Glad we did though.  I think next time I will try to mix the seasoning with bread crumbs and then make a breaded pork chop and see if that will help with the aroma.

I tried it and loved it.  I am not a big pork chop person so I needed something to give them flavor.  I am a big  ranch dressing fan as it is.  These were easy and delicious although I decided to add a little extra garlic powder and also used himalayan pink salt instead of regular or kosher salt.   They came out tender and good.

It was bland. I added paprika to the ranch mix then shook the chops in a bag to coat well and let sit for an hour or so in the fridge. They looked good and were very moist but the ranch mix didn't add much flavor. Won't be making it again.

I have made these twice now, they are rather delicious. I just wish my chops had more crispiness on the outside which is something you can really only get pan frying. None the less, this recipe will be a staple I'm sure. Not what I was expecting for flavor.
