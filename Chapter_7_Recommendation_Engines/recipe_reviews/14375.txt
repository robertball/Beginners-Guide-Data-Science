My kids had a good time with this tonight and *I* liked it because they were giggling and enjoying themselves so much. The hardest thing about it was getting the kids to eat the faces. Next time, I'd like to try this with more variety of vegetables.

Thanks for the idea!  My daughter wanted to make the salad last night and this was just right.  I set out the ingredients for her and she made a little face for each member of the family.  She made crouton eyes, bacon mouths, tomato noses and cheesy hair, each on a big piece of lettuce.  We found it didn't need any dressing, and most members of our family rolled the little face right up into the lettuce and ate it as a salad roll-up.  A big hit!

What a cute idea!  Fortunately my boys love salad, and this one was no exception.  What I really like about this recipe is that it leaves plenty of room for the imagination so the kids will never tire of it.  My boys like cucumbers, so I add those sometimes.  Thanks Kyle!

Very cute!  I like to try to make fun food for the kids and they loved looking at this.  My 5 year old is not a fan of salad but he did take a bite because of how it looked.  He did enjoy the bacon and croutons!

Very cute idea. My kids love salads but they still found the face humorous.
