Great coleslaw - it's definitely a combination of sweet and tangy! I love the vibrant colors and mix of flavors. I used a bag of coleslaw mix and 2 mangos vs. 1. I also added about 1/2 cup of raisins for contrast and they paired nicely with the walnuts. I mixed the dressing basically dissolving the sugar in the rice vinegar - taste it before you mix it in, if you don't like it before it goes over the salad you'll ruin the whole thing. I mixed everything and let it set overnight. It was a great accompaniment to grilled pork tenderloin.

The combination of cabbage, mangos,and walnut was very good. The recipe called for too much dressing. I'm thinking of making the dressing a little different with something other than just vinegar. The dressing was a little tart.

I've made this three times so far and each time, my partner who doensn't like fruit salad loved it! I like it because it's simple and easy and tastes great. It's even better I find if I let it sit for about 30 mins in the refrigerator beforehand to let the flavors meld together.

This is going to go PERFECTLY with my barbecued short ribs that I am fixing today.  I picked it because it calls for ZERO oil or mayo.  If you like a tangy cole slaw, you will love this.  I heeded what others said and used the same amount of dressing in twice the amount of cabbage.

Fabulous combination!  This will be a regular on my table as long as I can find fresh mangoes!  My only criticism is that the recipe makes too much dressing, so next time, I'll either double the veggies or halve the dressing.

I ommitted the onion and walnuts and used celery instead.  Also, I used real sugar instead of Splenda.  This has a very pungent flavor and there is plenty of dressing, so I think I would cut back next time.  Overall, this is unique and very healthy....would make again.

I was looking for a fresh recipe to use my mango, but this slaw is a bit bland.  I found it too sweet.  I did add a bit of light mayo as a binder.  It was OK, but I won't make it again.

Excellent salad - everyone at our table of 8 thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  As one reviewer suggested, I did taste the vinegar/sugar mixture before adding to the vegetables and while it was very good, I will increase the sugar a bit.  Two days old now and it's still as good as the 1st day

Awesome! Super super yummy! I don't like mayo ladden coleslaws, so this was perfect since I had so many mangos I needed to use up. I used agave nectar instead of splenda because I  never use splenda. I cut back on the vinegar to about half a cup and it was perfect. I also didn't add the walnuts to the slaw because I didn't want them to get soggy, I just sprinkled them on top. Amazing!

This was way too sweet for me and there was too much vinegar. If I make it again, I will definately cut both the vinegar and the Splenda in half. Otherwise, it's low calorie and has a great amount of vitamins so it's great for us who watch our waistlines!

Mmmm!!! Even my 3 yr old ate this! And I couldn't get enough! This is DELICIOUS the way it is, but I made a few changes to cater to my family's tastes:
-only used 2 Tbls of red onion finely chopped
-used regular white sugar 
-added 1 Tbls mayo to thicken the sauce -replaced walnuts w/ almonds 
-added pineapple tidbits & shredded coconut

We found the flavour of this slaw to be very strong.  There was nothing wrong with it, a nice combination of flavours in fact, but it wasn't really for us.

This is a really great slaw recipe and has become a go-to side salad for me. I use a few tablespoons of sugar instead of the Splenda. I recommend using less rice vinegar at first and then adding to taste. I've also made it with dried cranberries when I didn't have mango and it was equally if not more delicious that way.

Really good recipe, & very versatile. But strong for the wife & me, so I added 2 cups more cabbage. Bingo! Another time, out of walnuts, so I subbed sunflower seed kernels, which turned the taste in a dfferent (& tasty!) direction.

Made this to use on my shrimp taco's tonight....Yummy! I did change it a little and made the dressing like I do for slaw; Sugar, onion powder and a dash of salt, mix in rice vinegar till blended and dissolved, taste and adjust, add a tablespoon or two of mayonnaise depending on how much you are making and mix well.

Did what others suggested:  increased the cabbage (half of a medium-sized green and half a med. red cabbage heads) and added raisins.  Fantastic.  Also, subbed brown rice vinegar.  Used two mangoes but it would've been better with three!

I would prefer honey (about 2 Tbsp) to the Splenda.I would add a small amt. of olive oil as well. Drizzle the oil over the slaw to taste.
