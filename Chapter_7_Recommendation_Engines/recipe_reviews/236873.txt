This turned out really good. My family loved it. I did make some changes. I used 1 can of cream of chicken rather than using half chicken and half mushroom. also didn't use butter just pan fried the chicken in the bacon grease. Cooked it all in a cast iron so I threw the chicken and the sauce into the oven without the rice and just served it on top of the rice. Didn't want to dirty another dish

It was easy. I liked it but hubby said it was too rich for him.  I would not want it often. I used half and half instead of heavy cream.... still rich!!!

Very good I made one minor change and that was adding shredded cheddar cheese on top during last 5 minutes

Everything about this dish is special. Bacon? Heck yeah. Cream? Yes please. Butter, rice, chicken, and all the drippings? Give it to me. Weâ€™ll be making this one again!

Easy, speedy, good!  I followed the recipe but subbed the mushroom soup with celery (hate mushrooms LOL). Cut the chicken before I seared and cooked - I hate burning my fingers. I served it with coleslaw- great textures and flavor combo!

It was a quick and easy recipe. I loved it I did add onions. I cooked them in the drippings from the chicken. It was really good if you like onions
