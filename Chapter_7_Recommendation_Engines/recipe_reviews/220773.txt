I submitted this recipe but the editors must have changed it. I never cook the taco seasoning and water separate from the meat! I brown the meat, drain it, and add the seasoning/water in with it. No need to dirty an extra pan!

Great recipe and a fabulous combination of crunchy and soft!  I followed the submitter's advice for the cooking instructions...  I used lean ground beef and for the seasoning I used "Seasoning For Tacos" from this site.  I'm not the biggest fan of Velveeta, but my husband loves it and this really worked for this recipe.  This was so good with all the fixin's - chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, picante sauce, and sour cream! Thanks for a great recipe cwoods81!

I don't know why allrecipes does that, change your submitted recipe. I've seen that on other recipes before and the submitter has to come on and restate the original steps because someone in the allrecipes kitchen or editing department thinks it should be otherwise. Your recipe sounds great, I am definitely going to try it very soon. Thanks for sharing.

Yum! Couldn't get many takers on the double taco at our taco bar, but those that had it loved it! Our people tonight just didn't have taste buds for anything fun and unusual! Will serve it next time to a more appreciative group.

Never thought to stick tortillas to taco shells but it worked nicely.  We even used regular shredded cheddar cheese instead of velveeta.  Tasted great!

This was very good. I liked the contrast between the soft flour tortilla and the crispy corn shell inside. It was easier to eat then a regular taco since when the shell broke during eating, none of the filling fell out. I used onion powder instead of fresh. I tossed the water, the uncooked beef, onion powder, and the taco seasoning all in at the start and it made a raw meat soup but once it cooked down, it was so delicious. I used a lean beef so no draining of grease was required. That's the secret to getting the super fine texture adding the liquid from the start and breaking down the meat. I'm going to fix this again, it was a huge hit here.

These were tasty double tacos!  I used the super size hard taco shells and the fajita size flour tortillas and they were a perfect fit.  Much more filling than a typical taco.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, cwoods!

I've made this a bunch of times...it's a great alternative to plain tacos. The most amazing part about it is the leftovers the next day...making tex mex breakfast burritos.

We liked it but read the description.  Add toppings like as recommended.  Would've been even better with some lettuce, tomatoes etc...
