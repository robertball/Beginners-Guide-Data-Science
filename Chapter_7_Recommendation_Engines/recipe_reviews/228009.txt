This had a fairly good balance of tea flavor vs citrus flavor with the citrus dominating just a little.  I don't drink sweet ice tea, so I didn't use Sweet'N Low, but it was a refreshing summer drink.

I just finished a batch of this drink using fresh clementine juice and cranberry teabags without herbs (don't have it readily available to me). Everything else was the same and it is a nice, refreshing drink that is not overly sweet but has a delightful fruit taste with each gulp. I will make this during our hot humid Toronto summers.
