I did add some extra vegetables that were in the refrigerator, as we all do when we're making soup :-). I also found it in need of more space, so I put half a pack of taco seasoning in which made it a little spicy, but everybody loved it!

I have made this recipe for several years before I saw this one on all recipes.  The one idea I want to share is grinding your own spices especially the cumin and oregano.  It makes a huge difference.  I also grind Coriander and add frozen corn just before serving.   This is my husbands favorite soup.

I didn't have fire-roasted tomatoes so I used petite diced tomatoes with green chiles. I added a dash of cayenne to kick it up a notch. Followed all other ingredients and it was delicious and filling! Great recipe.

We love this soup! The tortilla chips add the right amount of salt on their own. I recommend doubling the recipe because leftovers are just as good if not better

Love making this soup. Add cilantro, avocados, and a dolup of sour cream to top it off and a little spritz of lime juice. A family favorite.

I used chicken thighs and canned corn - what I had on hand - but otherwise stuck quite close to the ingredient list here. And all of the flavors blend together very nicely. As I was testing seasoning toward the end, it just seemed to be missing "something" so I added fresh cilantro, and that brought it all together, at least for my taste buds. (From the photo with this recipe it looks like there's cilantro in there, so maybe it  just got missed in the instructions.) Another bonus - the overall flavor got even better with the leftovers the next day!

So, so yummy! I ate off this for a few days! The only changes I made was to use pinto beans instead of great northern, and I threw my chicken in the crock pot to cook in some chicken broth instead of boiling it. I liked using the bone in chicken breast. It seemed to come out juicier than just using boneless breasts.
Definitely a repeat!

This hearty and healthy chicken tortilla soup with beans is filled with shredded chicken and many other flavors that blend well together for that perfect meal. We don't like our soup too thin so we added less broth.
