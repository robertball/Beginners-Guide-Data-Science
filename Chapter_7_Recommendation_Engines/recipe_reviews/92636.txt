We've been making this BÃ»che for the past 2 Christmas holidays. It's amazing how the flavors meld together when it rests! The wafers get soft and really incorporate themselves well. This log is nice and light-- not too sweet either. We use raspberry jam with a little liquor. The nonpareils and kisses are all extra stuff. 

Can't say enough positive about this one! :)

I made different yule logs over the past few years, and they all came out too dry and tasted so-so.  I tried this one last year and it was a total hit.  I didn't use the liquor (kids) or the marmalade.. I just basically made the recipe that's on the wafer box.  It looked great and tasted so decadent.  I'll be making it again this year.  Thanks for the idea!  Edited to add: when I make whipped cream I usually add a little instant pudding mix.  Partly because it adds flavor and sweetness, but mostly because the gelatin stabilizes the whipped cream.

I made this for a Christmas party potluck at my boyfriend's parents house. Everyone loved it! They ate the entire thing! Even the kids loved it, which surprised me because I wasn't sure if they'd like the dark chocolate flavors for the cocoa or the orange marmalade.  I couldn't find chocolate wagers anywhere! I checked three different major grocery stores. I substituted with Nilla vanilla wafers and it worked out great!   I also loved how everyone thought that I put so much time and effort into forming the "cake" into a log. None of them had to know that they were actually eating Nilla wafer cookies and it only took about 30 minutes of prep time =)  Will definitely make again next year. Absolutely delicious!

I made it exactly as the recipe said with one exception. I added some vanilla pudding, as one reviewer suggested, to the cream mixture to make it more stable.  The flavor and texture were great.  However, if the yule log is not eaten by the day after it is made, the frosting loses its fluff.

The alcohol was very strong for my family and I. It was difficult for me to  make, but I've never made a yule log before. Some directions were confusing for me as well.
