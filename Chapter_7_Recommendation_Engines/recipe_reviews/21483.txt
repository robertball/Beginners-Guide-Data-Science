I made this in a 9x13 pan and cooked for 38 minutes - came out great.  Topped with commerical cream cheese frosting.  More like a spice cake, than "bars."  But really very good.  I'd make it again.

My friend made this cake for a baby shower and it disappeared in no time flat. She made a simple cream cheese frosing from 1 stick butter/1 package cream cheese, 1 tbsp vanilla and 2 cups powdered sugar, and the cake melted in your mouth. Yummy!

Wonderful! I agree that it is more of a cake than a bar, but thats alright with me. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, and reseved a little and dyed a little green and a little orange and decorated a little pumpkin on each piece. Very cute for Halloween or Fall treats.

My family loves these things.  My husband tells people they are bad just so that he can eat them all.  I have to stop him sometimes.

Very tasty and moist.  If you don't have all three spices, you can substitute them for McCormick's Pumpkin Pie Spice.  I would definitely make these again.

I can't say enough good things about this pumpkin spice cake.  It is very moist, tender and not too sweet.  The spices are just right.  The only change I made was to bake this in a 9 x 13 inch pan because I didn't have the specified size.  I had to bake it an extra ten minutes.  It turned out perfect.  I made homemade cream cheese frosting and topped with toasted pecans.  Everyone at Thanksgiving loved this and took pieces home with them so it must have been good.  Thanks for a new go-to Thanksgiving recipe!

11-16-2017  ~Are you craving a dessert NOW or need one, fast, for an occasion? Got a couple of minutes?  Make these bars.  Though I’ve made a number of variations of this recipe probably a hundred times, I still couldn’t believe how easy and quick it was to mix these up.  I prepared the recipe as directed, only adding a teaspoon of vanilla cuz it can’t hurt, right? I also topped it with a delicious homemade cream cheese frosting, Cream Cheese Frosting II, recipe also on this site.  To emphasize how good and satisfying these are, let me say this: Hubs is not fond of either cream cheese or anything pumpkin, yet not only did he try these, his remark of “yum!” spoke volumes.  As this type recipe always is with a cup of oil, they are very moist, and I found this particular recipe to have just the right amount of “spiciness.”  There was a nail-biting moment when it looked as though the bars just might overflow the 15x10” pan, but it apparently knew just the right time to stop, and all was good.  Hubs took these to the office today and this big pan (whoa, it was heavy!) was devoured quickly.  A bonus was that they were attractive to the eye and easy to cut and serve cleanly.  I wouldn’t hesitate to make these again, particularly for an occasion where a darn good dessert is needed in a hurry. Note: be sure and check these a good few minutes before the directed baking time.  Mine were done at 27 minutes.

I loved this!  So moist with a nice balance of the spices.  Instead of bars, I made this as a bundt cake; just bake for an hour and ten minutes.  Cream cheese frosting is awesome on this too.  Completely devoured by my coworkers and then at my sister's birthday party.  Definately a keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe- we're not pumpkin pie eaters, so my family asked me to make this for Thanksgiving this year. I only used 1/2 cup oil and subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the rest. The cake was so moist and flavorful! I followed another reviewer's advice for the cream cheese frosting: 1 stick butter, 1 (8 oz) block cream cheese, 1 Tbsp vanilla, 2 cups confectioner's sugar. So smooth and creamy, the perfect topper to this cake! Enjoy!

Absolutely wonderful!  Loved the spice combination.  Will be making this again very soon!  I was 1/3 cup short of 2 cups of white sugar so I substituted brown sugar for white in the last 1/3 cup.

I made half the recipe (13 servings). I baked the mixture in a 9 inch square pan and frosted with homemade cream cheese frosting.  My family liked them as they weren't too spicy.  I saw in the newspaper where a lady won first place at a state pumpkin festival  using this recipe.  Thanks for posting.

Awesome!  I did add 1/4t nutmeg to the recipe, and then I sprinkled chopped walnuts on top right before going in the oven.  The nuts toast a bit while they bake giving a yummy flavor to these.

Perfect!  These turned out very moist and the spices were just right.  I made my own cream cheese icing using the Pumpkin Bar Icing recipe from here.  The two complimented each other perfectly.  The cook time was right on for me and I used an 11x15 pan.  People kept coming back for seconds.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This turned out more like a cake, probably because I tripled the recipe and didn't put it in the right sized pan, but it was good just the same. I'll make it again.  Beckyaunt

Loved this! Nice mix of Fall flavors. I made no changes to the ingredient list. I didn't have a jelly roll pan though so I used a 9x13 glass dish at 345 degree (my oven runs hot) for 35 minutes. Delicious!

Excellent! 
I will be making this recipe for a long time, It's just delicious.
 I lined my 15X11 jellyroll pan with parchment paper that was very lightly sprayed with Pam and it was so easy to remove & cut it, no mess at all. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this with my students in China and it was a big hit! Very easy to follow, yummy! I'm sure you could cut the sugar down to half if you wanted to. I just tried the recipe to the tee and it was great.They didn't taste too sweet to me though. 

I substituted pumpkin pie mix (Libby's) in for the pumpkin puree because I couldn't find it here in Chengdu, but it worked out perfectly. Don't be afraid to do the same!

This recipe is fabulous.  I hande made it many times with only minor changes.  I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and just under 1/2 cup white. The frosting will add sweetness.  It's perfect without frosting as well.  We grow our own Japanese or Kubota pumpkins and they make for a delicious combination.  The only other change Is that I add some allspice and sprinkle nutmeg on the top. At least 8 stars here!!!

I took this this to a lodge meeting last night and got great reviews. We have a family night supper tomorrow night and I was asked to bring it again.I did as was suggested and used a 9X13,added orange coloring to canned frosting and it looked great . When I get that many compliments and recipes request,it's a sure keeper.

I made these today with cream cheese frosting. They were WONDERFUL.I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices, and put 2tsp. in my frosting.
