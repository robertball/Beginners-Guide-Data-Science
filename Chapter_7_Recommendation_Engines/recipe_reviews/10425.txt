I added 1/2 tsp. of coconut flavoring because I thought the dough didn't taste like much of anything. The end result was pretty good. Very soft, like I like 'em. Flavor was okay.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  Everyone in my family raved about these cookies - I already have requests for another batch. Just be sure to use good coconut for premium moistness. YUM!

They turned out harder than I thought they would and there were way too many pecans for my liking.  It was ok :-)

These are a little bland.  I added some salt to my second batch and it helped a lot.  I may add some coconut extract next time.

They were easy and delicious. We made these gluten free by using rice flour and xantham gum. It's a great recipe to make gluten free. Yum!

I agree there was not enough flavor and too many nuts. Maybe I'm just comparing it with the Magic Cookie Bars recipe, they are far superior. This falls flat.
