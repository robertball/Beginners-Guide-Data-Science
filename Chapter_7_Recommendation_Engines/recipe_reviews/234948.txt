The we're OK. The kids seemed to enjoy them but I think I was expecting more flavor. I used a pack of Onion Soup mix to the chips. Glad I did.

This is a mix for the rating here.  Hubby liked them a lot.  I was going to rate them a 4 because of the cooking time that I thought was off.  I baked them for 20 minutes at 350 and they still weren't really very browned at all.  I then turned up the oven to 400 and it still took a little while for them to brown.  In the meantime, the chicken was done.  It's always hard to get an even cut when dealing with chicken (in my opinion at least), and I think I'd cut these a little smaller so that kids could get a better bite of them.  I'm not sure if the measurements of the potato chips was right on because I only used two half chicken breasts, and I kept crushing more chips.  I also think you need a really strong potato chip to use.  I would not recommend Lay's Classics that I used----I'd think a stronger flavor with onion or garlic or ranch would be much better.  I know my granddaughters would like something with more taste than what I produced.  I served these with Honey Mustard II from this site.  I'll give this a try with the little girls sometime soon. l I know they will like them!  Thanks for this recipe.

Used sun chips. Kids loved them. Delicious! Also used southwest ranch dipping sauce.

Kept it pretty close to the vest, only added a little bit of Lowery’s seasoning salt. They were excellent! Even my picky granddaughters are them.  And they don’t need anything! I didn’t want to change it too much, so I’d have a baseline for how to play around with it in the future, going to be fun!

It took a TON of potato chips for me to make this work.  Not my favorite homemade nugget recipe.  The kids didn't like it as it had very little flavor.

Wasn't enough potato chips.  Best to add them to a bowl as needed so they don't get gooey from batter.

BIG HIT WITH ADULTS & KIDS...EASY, FAST, JUST A FEW INGRED.
Will definitely make again.  Use organic or regular ingred.  Provide dips (bbq, honey, ketchup, other) on the side.

Best if served straight from the oven, but I had an hour wait so warmed a ceramic lasagna pan and transferred the chix over after cooking to hold.   Don't overcook; don't cover tightly or steam will make soggy; reheat can dry chix.

Turned out very moist but did not have much flavor.  Next time I will add spices, from thai curry to bbq, to italian, depending on our mood.  Will make this again.

I made this recipe with lays potato chips, classic. I added some salt, pepper and garlic to the coating but I should have added more. If you are using any basic chip that isn't super flavorful, you're going to want to add seasoning. I baked them for about 20 minutes, and the came out mostly crisp all around which was a worry. I didn't drizzle butter (maybe that's why I'm not as impressed as I hoped I would be?). I also cut the chicken into bites, therefore I required more crushed chips. 4 stars is because this recipe would be quite bland without seasonings, and even with them, it isn't 'wow'. I prefer the Butter Chicken recipe to this and probably will stick to that from now on for baked chicken.

Came out amazing, the kids loved it! Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I added a little seasoning to the chips. Other than that I followed directions given. Will definitely be making this again!

These were great.  I used Lays Cheddar and Sour Cream potato chips.  I covered a baking pan with foil and poured a little of the melted butter on that and added the breaded chicken nuggets and baked for 25 min.  Perfectly crispy.  Served with my version of Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce which I revised from this site.  Can't wait to make again.

Simple, easy, quick, tasty, inexpensive.  For the people complaining about the chips to chicken ratio? Did you think it might be due to the size of the chicken breast or nuggets? How about how much you crushed your chips?  Two cups are plenty if you read the direction and measure them after they are crushed.

First endeavor into fresh chicken vs frozen!  LOL  And they turned out well.  Cooking time worked for me.  Cut pieces a little smaller, more "bite" than "nugget" size.  Definitely need a stronger chip flavor.  BBQ flavor was a little there, as was corn chip.  Sour Cream & Onion flavor disappeared for me.  Pringles Kickin' Chicken Taco chips has lots of kick!  So strong and spicy the way to go.  Very good snack w/ honey mustard or BBQ sauce.

This was really awesome. Our picky eaters loved it!  We used sour cream and onion chips and made a dipping sauce of Dijon mustard and honey for parents.  Be aware the chip to chicken ratio isn't nearly enough.  We used 2 chicken breasts and all of the chips. We'll definitely add this to our repeat recipe list!
