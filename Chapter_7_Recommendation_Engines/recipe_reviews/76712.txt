This was soooo good! I'll give it 4 stars though, simply because I changed quite a few things (like everyone else!). I used about 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup lite mayo. Used cream of mushroom soup instead and frozen french cut green beans. I browned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper until almost completely cooked through. Also added 1/2 cup or so of shredded monterrey jack into the soup mixture. Served it with angel hair pasta. We thought this was great comfort food, will definitely make again!

Made this for dinner tonight...was a little skeptical...but my husband loved it. He said it was like something you would get in a fine italian restuarant. He is right!  Delicious served over angel hair pasta!!!  Will add to my favorites! I would like to add that if you have picky eaters, combine the soup, mayo and garlic, cheese and mix....brown the chicken and cook until almost cooked...then place chicken in dish and cover with soup mixture...then serve green beans (personal favorite for this diah if made this way) on the side. I find that even picky eaters will try it this way and end up saying...I think I would like this with the beans in it too!

Great recipe.  Easy, too.  Tastes even better the next day.  The first time I made this, it came out watery and the chicken was not done.  The second time, I cut the chicken into smaller pieces before browning, added the parmesan to the soup mixture and sprinkled a little more over the top.  I also increased my oven temperature.  Yummy!

This was really good!!  The sauce is awesome!  I didn't have the time to make this into a casserole, so I put it in the slow cooker.  I put the chicken in the bottom, topped the chicken with the green beans.  Then I added the wet ingredients to the top.  I cooked the whole thing on high for about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. The chicken was really moist and not dried out.  My kids loved this.  I was happy because they even ate the green beans!  I would for sure make this one again.

Excellent. I used chicken tenders instead of breasts. Since other people said it came out soupy I drained the greenbeans & did not cover it while it was baking & I had no problems. Looked great & tasted even better. I also add mushrooms when I make this.

Very goood!  After having it a few times, we decided to use cream of mushroom soup instead.  It was wonderful.  We also use frozen beans instead of canned.  I found that you need to brown the chicken til it is almost cooked or it will take alot longer in the oven.  This is one of my husbands favorite dishes now.

I made this using fresh french green beans and it turned out great.  It was very simple and quick to prepare and it makes a great hearty meal. My husband and young daughter also loved it.  They were fighting over the leftovers the next day!

Made this with Miracle Whip instead of mayo, but otherwise followed the recipe; served over buttered egg noodles.  Family response:  eh.  I'm not throwing this one out completely, but will save it for when I don't have ingredients for anything else.  

I'd recommend substituting sour cream or plain yogurt for part of the mayo, and adding some extra parmesan on top to make a crispy topping.

My husband is tired of eating chicken from me trying to diet. Even he liked it very much. Very Good! I used light Mayo and did not put over mash potatoes, but the next time for sure over potatoes! oops I forgot the garlic powder. Bet that makes it even better! A must try... I had to change this to 5 star. I want this at least once every other week!

Yummmmmm!!!  Perfect when you have green beans that need to be used and you probably have the other ingredients around the house.

We us fresh green beans, cook them first, serve with rice, and follow other suggestions of browning the chicken sprinkled with garlic powder and pepper.  

I love that I can make it earlier in the day or the night before, and then it only has to go from the fridge to the oven to cook.

This WAS quick, easy and delicious as promised. I served it over cheesy garlic mashed potatos (mashed potatoes w/ sour cream, cheddar cheese, green onions, garlic, and bacon bits in them) and got rave reviews from my family! I would definately make this again

Excellent with some awesome healthy alternatives.  Used (minute rice) as my bottom layer, used 1 can healthy request cream of mushroom soup and about 1cp light sour cream, used a rotissery chicken instead of cutting and cooking chicken breast WAY EASY and QUICK!  For my topping I used crumbled reduced fat cheez-its.

I like this, but one thing I would change is to use half of garlic powder because to me it had just a little bit too much garlic other than that I really like it. Plus I added French's fried onions on top! Yum

To be fair, I made one or two changes for convenience and speed but overall followed the recipe to a "T".  I used a roasted chicken from the local grocer which I chopped and boned; added a 1/2 large can of Durkee Fried Onions.  I then topped it with both shredded Parmesan and the other half large can of onions.  This was THE most amazing dish for a planning meeting for the local Optimist Club.  Usually there is so much food that everyone takes home leftovers but I did not even have enough left for my husband to try.  Everyone raved about how good it was and I was very impressed. Simple, easy, quick and delicious.  That is my idea of the prefect recipe.  This earned a full-fledged 5 stars because, as written, it is perfect. Thanks for sharing.  In fact, it was so good I made it for a luncheon the next day but saved some for my husband and he said, "KEEPER!"  What more can I say than that?

Good recipe, I cut up the chicken used cream of celery and a little more garlic. (My family loves garlic) my husband really liked it and he's a picky eater goes great with mashed potatoes.

I thought this recipe was really good and super simple. I did it with frozen french green beans. I browned the chicken with olive oil, a clover of garlic, onions then sprinkled with cracked pepper, sea salt, basil and a little bit of red chile powder I did a little more than brown to ensure the chicken would be done. I used mushroom soup and mixed it with a 1/4 cup mayo and 2TBSP of sour cream. I covered it for 30 minutes and then baked uncovered for the last 10. I ate it as is and didn't put it on noodles or potatoes.

I loved this recipe!  It's quick and easy.  I used frozen beans and cooked them in the microwave because I love the color better.  My husband loved it and keeps asking me to make it again.  I served it with rice but he perferred it with stuffing,both work well.

We liked it a lot, but it didnt really have enough green beans in it for us, so next time I will probably us 4 cans.  Also it was a bit runny.  But such great flavor.  I will be making it again for sure!

I made this for my family and they loved it.  I did make a few changes.  First, I cut up the chicken breast, then browned it.  And I seasoned it with seasoning salt, a little cajun seasoning, garlic powder and pepper.  I also omitted the Parmesan and instead topped it with shredded cheddar/monterey jack cheese.  Served it over rice and everyone loved it.

This was delicious.  I made some changes, though.  I used fresh green beans instead of canned and cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I also cut the chicken up into bite sized pieces so it would be easier to eat as a bowl dinner.  I served it over noodles.

I made this for one using one chicken breast.  I also used an italian 4 cheese mix and it turned out beautifly.  Next time I'm going to try adding a small can of mushrooms with the green beans to see how that will taste.  This is a great dish and would be wonderful at family gatherings.

It was ok.  Good for a quick all in one meal.  Used half mayo, half sour cream.  Cut chicken into pieces and cooked pretty much all the way before adding to casserole (in butter, garlic powder and pepper).  Added white cheddar to mayo/sour cream - would like to try swiss.

recipe did not state where to use the 1 t garlic powder, I sprinkled it on the chicken while cooking it, that is the only reason it has 4 stars instead of 5.  Delicious and will make again.  Served over noodles.

This was good, easy to customize. I cut my chicken into smaller pieces and also added some crushed french fried onions on top.  Served with couscous.

Overall this is a super easy and tasty recipe. Here are modifications:
-I added silverbeet (swiss chard)
-I cut the chicken into smaller strips
-I used lowfat mayo
-Added a few dashes of hot sauce to the soup/mayo mixture
-I added panko breadcrumbs to the parmesan cheese
- I served it on top of a cauliflower mash I made up.

This recipe surely makes enough for 8 people.  We had 3 sets of leftovers for our lunches.

This was a great recipe... i made the following variations: mixed cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup lite mayo, frozen grean beans, and cut up the chicken into chunks before browning.  The only downfall was that the recipe was slightly watery... it may have been helpful to mix the frozen grean beans with the soup mixture prior to adding to casserole dish.  I also served it with whole wheat angel hair.

After cooking for 40 minutes at 350 degrees, I stirred up the mixture and cooked it for an additional 10 minutes to bake out some of the water at the bottom of the dish.

Great comfort food on a chilly early spring evening!

Really good. My husband loved it and my 3 year old ate it up. Modified by using 1/4 C of mayo and 1/2 C of yogurt. Also used condensed mushroom soup. Next time would add mushrooms too.

This was great comfort style food. Super easy and hearty too. I cut the chicken into strips and used whole green beans, I served this over mashed potatoes for a wonderful filling meal. It was really creamy with the mayo and it really didn't taste mayonaiss-ey to me at all. This did end up watery somehow at the bottom of the pan even though I drained the green beans well, so ??? Still good for a weeknight meal and we'll eat this one again. Thanks!

Great recipe! I made a few minor changes but didn't really alter the recipe. I like shreded chicken so I just mixed in three shredded chicken breast and instead of serving it OVER something, I added two cups of cooked wild rice!

I'm so glad I tried this as it's not just another ho-hum chicken casserole recipe. I used condensed cream of mushroom soup; that along with the mayo and garlic powder topped with parmesan cheese made an interesting yet delicious sauce!

I made this dish last night because the ingredients were basicaly all I had on hand. I was highly skeptical about it all and didn't know if it would turn out any good. I was suprised that yes, indeed, it was very yummy. I spooned it over mashed potatoes as requested and it made for a very filling meal. My 6 yr old who is a budding food critic announced that the "sauce" was very "yummers". I did as other's suggested and cut the chicken up into pieces and cooked it a little longer before putting it in the casserole. The only thing I will do different next time will be to flavor up the chicken a little more. This is a great dish to play around with. I will be making this again. Thank You. P.S. My little one called this "Green Bean Pie" lol

I made this for dinner the other night. Took the advice of some other reviewers and decreased the mayo to 1/4c and replaced the rest with sour cream. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. I just don't think mayo has a place in a "creamy" sauce. I bumped it to  2 stars since my husband said, "it's not bad. I mean, it's not good, but it's not bad."

Loved it though I did make some changes. Only used 2 breast, cooked & shredded them used part mayo part sour cream like others did, added 1 can rotel (drained), used 1 can cream of chicken/mushroom mixed in a little cheddar, blended all together then put in dish and sprinkled parm & cheddar cheese on top served over rice. Cooked for 30 min. It had Perfect consistency & we all loved it!

Great recipe!! My husband gave his approval stamp by having thirds :) So simple! To keep it on my weekly dinner, I do the original one week and the next week I do 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and half of chicken cream soup.. I also cook the chicken with onions.

This was surprisingly good, but I did make minor changes.  I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder and  mixed a can of Cream of Mushroom with about 1/2 cup of chicken broth and only 1/4 cup mayo.  I placed frozen broccoli on the bottom of my casserole dish, spooned some of the soup mixture on that, put my skillet-browned chicken on top of the broccoli then spooned the rest of trhe soup mixture on the chicken.  From there I sprinkled with the parm cheese and baked per the recipe.  I served this with egg noodles, which was delicious topped with the broccoli and sauce.  My maniacally picky 9-year old ate a huge plateful!  Thanks for sharing!

Everytime I want something good that my mom would make, I look at your recipes! They're so good, and of course because it's down home Texas cooking, especially the casseroles! I'm from Texas but currently living in Tulsa, so we share that little bit in common :) thanks again for taking me to my home kitchen table every once in a while

I too topped it with French Fried Onions... I think it would be good with Cream of Mushroom soup, but then it would be Green Bean Casserole like you eat around the holidays. I put it in a 9x13 pan, and the sauce didn't quite cover everything... next time I will use an 8x8.

Edit: I'm coming back to move this up to a 5 star recipe. It has become a regular meal in our house (we have it at least once a month). It's SO simple, and it's all stuff you usually have around anyway, and it tastes great.   Very tasty! I made it for dinner, we had it again for a snack that evening and breakfast the next morning!

Very good base recipe. I followed it exactly and poured it over bow tie pasta. Really simple and uses items most people always have on hand, which is exactly what i was looking for. next time I will add a few extras just to jazz things up!

I made this recipe a few nights ago for dinner but I thought it was a little salty using the soup. Next time I will deffinitely buy the low sodium type. Make sure you cover the chicken too, because it makes it super moist! I opted to use cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken, I prefer that soup instead. It came out really well and my family (including my very picky brother) really enjoyed it.

This was really easy and had really good flavor.  Mine wasn't wet or soupy at all, as some other reviewers had problems with. I chopped the chicken into bite-sized pieces, seasoned with garlic salt and pepper and cooked it all the way before layering over the green beans.  I also used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken and added cheddar cheese and parmesan to the sauce.  I served it over mashed potatoes and it was really filling - good comfort food.  I think the taste would be perfect with angel hair pasta, so that's what I'll try next time!

This is our new family favorite! I halved the chicken breasts before browning and cooked about half-way through before putting it all in the oven. We eat all organic so I used regular cut green beans b/c I couldn't find french cut. I only used half a cup of organic mayo (it's a little sweeter by the way - great sub for reg. mayo) and 3/4 can of cream of celery soup instead of chicken. Also added a little extra parmasen about 2 minutes before taking it out of the oven. Next time I'll use 3 cans of green beans though. 2 just isn't enough for us! Great with rice or mashed pot's.

It was pretty good, but kind of runny. My husband like it, my daughter hated it, but she is 1 and a half and hates most anything! I think I will cook it again, but I will tweak the recipe a little.

This was very good. My picky boyfriend who had his doubts while I was cooking it, really liked it and had seconds. However, I thought that it needed a little something; maybe the addition of a different kind of sharp shredded cheese, and some black pepper.

The recipe is flexable enough to allow creativity.  I have made it with chicken cubes, turkey leftovers, and ground turkey.  I have also used cream of celery, mushroom (with mushroom slices) and cream of cheese soups.  I usually mix the slightly undercooked rice into the mixture before I bake it.   All have been a hit at the potluck dinners we frequent.

Great taste and easy prep.  I made a few modifications.  I didn't use the mayo instead I added milk.  Also, I used the reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and it tasted great!  We will definitely have this meal 2-3 times a month :)

I basically followed the recipe. I did use fresh green beans and cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. Everything else I did the same. Very good. We had it with rice. Easy and yummy

I cubed up the chicken instead of cooking the whole breast at once.  I also used regular cut green beans and shredded parmesan instead of grated.  Was very tasty!

Quite tasty. I used fresh beans and did as others said used 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream. The sauce was a bit separated which hubby thought might be due to the sour cream. Next time I'll add some more seasoning and I the ink I'll stir the cheese into the sauce. Thank you for this easy dish.

I made this with the following changes. I put 2 cups cooked brown rice, 1/4 cup sautéed onions, about 1 cup pork gravy and a little chicken stock, and about 1 cup green beans mixed together in a 13x9 pan. Then put about 2 cups of cooked chicken, then mayo, cream of chicken soup, and garlic powder, and topped off with Parmesan cheese. Baked for recommended time. Both my picky granddaughters ate it up! Will make it this way again.

This is a very delicious recipe. I've made it several times. The first time I made it it was pretty watery. The next time I made it I took the advice of another reviewer and baked uncovered. It was perfect. Highly recommended recipe.

I really liked it!  My husband doesn't like casseroles so I was a little worried about this one.  The only critque he gave me was to change the veggie.  It wasn't soupy at all and it had a great flavor.  I will definitely make it again.

This was really tasty I tried it last night. My husband and daughter both loved it. Next time I will try broccoli and cream of mushroom soup instead also I will double up on the soup/mayo mixture because the sauce is really yummy served over rice.

Made a slight adjustment to the base recipe. I cubed the chicken before browning, and to the soup/mayo mixture, I added, black pepper, onion powder and a little shredded Colby-jack cheese. At the suggestion of another reviewer, I also increased the temperature to 375º. My husband and I loved it! It is certainly a keeper!!!

Very easy to make, and tasty too.  I didn't like the nutrition information, so I used some low-fat substitutions.  I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup.  I also added fat free mayo, but mixed half with low fat sour cream.  The  directions didn't indicate where the garlic powder went, so I seasoned the chicken with some garlic salt before cooking and added the garlic powder to the soup mix.  This will definitely be added to our dinner rotation.

This recipe was pretty good.  I am not to fond of mayo so I do not put the full amount that was suggested and it still tasted good.  It came out creamy and that was my husbands favorite part.

The flavor was good but I was expecting to use the green beans as our side item. The casserole dish was so soupy I had to "fish" out the green beans. It was definitely better the next day as leftovers. I wouldn't call this dish a casserole. It is really just baked chicken.

Very soupy.  As my husband said..if you can get past the looks, it tastes pretty good.  It was ok.  Don't think I would make it again.
