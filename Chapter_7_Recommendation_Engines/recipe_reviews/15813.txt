The family enjoyed it.  My son said it had a little too much bacon, but it was good.  I cooked the onions before adding them to the soup.

I decided to be creative with this, so bare with me here.  I cooked the bacon 1/2 way in the microwave & then put it in the pot and sauteed the onion with it to cook it through, then took it out & cut it up.  Since I have not seen ranch style beans since I was in Texas in 1995 and because I thought this was going to be like, maybe, campbells bean & bacon soup, I decided to wing it and use pork & beans (ha).  I also had (left over from another recipe) 1/2 can of tomato sauce & 1/2 can of tomato paste that I had mixed together & used that.  I did manage to use the regular chicken broth, and added a little water (due to the addition of the paste).  Over all it was pretty good, not exactly like any canned bean & bacon that I've had, but it went together well with grilled cheese.  Thanks Lyndell.

Very good soup Lyndell! I used pinto beans and instead of the tomato sauce I added a can of diced tomatoes with chiles. Onion and garlic powder, black pepper and a bit of liquid smoke gave the soup a really good flavor. I pureed most of the soup in my food processor to really thicken it up. Thanks so much!

I know this is not consistent with the other reviews, but I have to be honest.  I fried the onions first and used beans in molasses.  Not using the ranch style beans may have been where I went wrong, but all we could taste was spoonfuls of tomato sauce and beans with some bacon chunks.  The soup was very acidic and the taste was not enjoyable.

3 stars for being relatively quick(aside from the bacon) and easy. The taste was fairly good but much too salty. If I made it again I would substitute plain water for one of the cups of broth to eliminate some of the saltiness and use pre-cooked microwave bacon to make it a true quick and easy soup.

great base.  however, i sauted the onion first in with the mostly cooked bacon.  then, did what the recipe said.  at the end, i added about a tablespoon of cane sugar (my brown sugar sub.), tabasco and black pepper.  was great!  esp. with grilled cheese..as mentioned by another reviewer.

I was very pleasantly surprised with this recipe. The cupboards were bare & I didn't feel like going to the store. I had to cook mine longer because my husband doesn't like crunchy onions. Also took another reviewers suggestion & threw in some potato flakes. Served with homemade bread & had an easy, tasty meal. This was only enough for my husband & me (with a little bit left over) so either we are big eaters or this doesnâ€™t make a lot.

I've used the ranch beans before, but since there is some mysterious fatty substance in that can, I switched to pinto beans instead.  I just add a little garlic salt, onion salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper, and use probably about 1/3 cup of onion total, and make it as otherwise written.  I love this soup!  So simple and hearty.

This soup is super easy with few ingredients. My family loved it! I was a big fan as a kid of this soup-just the canned version. This is really close!

quick easy to follow directions... just a nice hearty meal... I viewed everyones critic on this.... ranch and baked beans have a totally different taste? I suggest to the person who used baked beans in mollasses... yes that's what was Wrong with your Results... pinto beans are a good 2nd choice if ranch are not available... 5 stars with some tweeking... thanks for this quick meal!

I loved it and so did my family. We were a little tight on ingredients so i used shallots and beef broth instead of onion and chicken. I also tried carmelizing the part of shallots first and it made more an amazing taste. Would i make it again? Yes.

We loved this soup! It's very easy to make and ready in about half an hour. No ranch beans available in my area. I realized that the flavor would all come from canned beans.  So I  chose a flavor of beans we all like, Bush grilling beans brown sugar bourbon flavor.  I fried the onions in approximately 1 tablespoon of bacon grease for extra flavor. Then I followed the recipe exactly. I'll have to make a double batch next time so there are left overs!

I had to modify it a bit.  I only had a can of chicken stock, which 14.5oz, an 8oz can of tomato sauce and a can of great northern beans.  I needed something creative between paychecks, so I used 1 tbsp dried onions instead of fresh and added 1/2 tsp rough ground black pepper, a dash of fresh basil and half tsp red pepper flakes, along with half a can od sliced carrots, also left out the bacon.  The result was a very tomato-y bean soup, but I would make it again.
