Flavor is ok, ended up adding a tad more honey. But the texture was way too dense and chewy. Are you sure you didn't mean almond flour instead of meal? It's nearly impossible to incorporate the stiff egg whites into coarse almond meal without them collapsing which probably accounts for the dense texture.
