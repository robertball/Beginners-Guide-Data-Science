A few tips:  The cornflakes should be finely crushed, and measure 2 cups AFTER being crushed. (This is close to 6 cups before crushing.)  Also, if you put the sour cream on the chicken and refrigerate for at least an hour, the sour cream will stick to the chicken when you add the cornflakes and bake them.  You will NOT need 2 cups sour cream!  More like 3/4 cup.  I added 1/2 pack Ranch dressing seasoning to sour cream.  I also seasoned the cornflakes generously with garlic salt, onion salt and seasoned salt.  My chicken breasts were large and cooked in 50 minutes.  Longer than that, they probably would have been dry.  I also left off the margarine and didn't need it.  With these few tweaks, this was a delicious way to prepare chicken!  My husband says this is his new favorite chicken dish!

My husband, the pickiest eater ever, loved this. I made some changes. I had no corn flakes so I used the new extra crunchy bread crumbs by Progresso. I mixed in about a half of a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix to which I added some garlic powder and pepper. The last few minutes I put the chicken under the broiler to make sure it was crunchy on the outdide. It was tasty, moist and tender and best of all very simple to prepare.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I make it quite often, as it is easy.  I've found to avoid some of the mess, just place the chicken in the baking dish.  Then spoon some sour cream over it and smooth it over.  Then sprinkle the crumbs over (I use italian style bread crumbs w/some spices added by me!) and pat down.  Flip them and repeat.  If you use one hand for your utensil and one for the patting, you can avoid contamination.  
The chicken is always tender and very flavorful!

Excellent Dish. I made my own modifications. For those who complained about not being very flavorful, this is what i did. I seasoned my thick chicken breasts real well first with Garlic salt, Pepper, Italian seasonings.(Generous amounts) then in a large zip lock bag, i added half sour cream, half ranch dressing, tossed the Chicken in there and marinated overnite. It really brings out the flavor, then i used the shake and bake hot and spicy mix, added my own seasonings to that because i love spicy, So added more Italian seasonings, a little garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, drizzled with butter. I put foil at the bottom of my baking dish, made a difference in the cleanup and browning of the chicken, I agree with someone, 60 min is way too long for this dish, i baked it at 400 for 35 minutes.Let me tell you, it was soo moist and tender, i literally used my fork to cut the chicken, never used a knife. And talk about Flavor. Its worth the extra step of marinating it overnite. Thank you for this recipe.

I put the chicken in some sour cream for about a half hour or less before coating it with the corn flake crumbs. I also put ranch seasoning in the sour cream and used a little salt, pepper, and garlic salt in the crumbs. A good way to crush the corn flakes is to put them in a ziploc bag and run a rolling pin over it!

Wow! I'd give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could. I'm a vegetarian, so I've not tasted this myself, but my 2 1/2 year-old son who has never eaten more than a few bites of any chicken (including nuggets dipped in ketchup) devoured a 1/2 breast! He started eating before we even said the blessing! My husband also really liked it, so it will become one of my staple recipes.  I love it because it is easy (I don't have a lot of experience cooking meat so it has to be easy) and it uses ingredients I always have in the house. I followed the suggestion to put dry onion soup mix in the sour cream. I used half of a package for 1 cup of sour cream. I only had 3 chicken breasts (they were large) so I used 1 c. sour cream and had plenty left over. I used 2 cups of cornflakes and had to crush up more. Because I used the soup mix in the sour cream I only added a very little amount of pepper and garlic powder to the cornflakes. The chicken was VERY tender! It was incredibly simple and a big hit with the family. Thanks!

Excellent, NO modification necessary.   In other words, THIS recipe, as it's written, is delicious.  I didn't change anything.  If I had, I wouldn't be reviewing THIS recipe, because had I changed something, I would no longer be reviewing THIS recipe.  I love it when some idiot says "This recipe was great!  I changed 5 things"!  What they're really saying is, "Oh, MY version of this recipe was 5 stars"!

Well I want to thank YOU for creating this recipe, because I didn't have to change a thing and it turned out wonderfully!  We will be eating this once a month!

I made this last night and it was so fantastic I'm going to make it regularly.  The measurements seemed a little off, so I played that by ear.  I just used enough sour cream to coat each piece and I think I used a lot more corn flakes than was called for.  I seasoned with garlic powder and added about a 1/4th of a cup of parmesan cheese.  For those who say it's too bland, be sure you use enough sour cream.

This was delicious!  Very quick and easy to make.  The chicken was real moist on the inside and nice & crunchy on the outside.  I made one change by adding dry onion soup mix to the sour cream.  Yummy!

very good and EASY!  however, I needed more cornflakes than it said - I had decreased the serving number from original recipe but needed more cornflakes than the revised recipe called for.  Very tasty - added dry ranch dressing mix to the sour cream - gave it a good flavor.
UPDATE - tried this with a whole chicken cut up - put the chicken in a ziploc bag with ranch dressing all day and then coated it  like the recipe called for - it was fantastic and not as dry as the boneless breasts!

OK, maybe not THE best,,,,, but right there up with the best!  Made this tonight for dinner. I had 3 chicken breasts & I put them in a resealable bag w/ the sour cream and refrigerated for a little over an hour. I used the boxed corn flake crumbs with a packet of Ranch dressing added along w/ some garlic powder and salt & pepper and dredged the sour cream covered chicken in that mixture. I lined a 9x13 pan w/ foil just so the clean up would be easier.  I melted about 2 Tblsp of butter and about 2 Tblsp of lemon together and drizzled over the chicken, mostly to use to help keep anything from sticking.  I cooked at 350* ~ covered the pan w/ foil for the first 20 minutes, then uncovered for about another 20. It was so moist,,,, did not even need a knife.  Will def make this one again!!

Really good recipe. The breading is great with the sour cream and seasoned corn flakes. Like others, I used ziploc bags and clean up was easier. I just had to fry because I was low on time, but I really liked the recipe and will make again.

Awesome juicy chicken everytime!! We have tried this many times as an alternate to fried chicken - amazing :) We do use fat free sour cream to make it more healthy and we add smoked paprika to the italian seasoning mix. Tip = use parchment paper when baking, this will save you a boat load ot time cleaning and the chicken doesnt stick to the pan. Gotta try this one! Even kids love this - we made this for our neices/nefews and they ate it up (only thing we changed was to cut the chicked into strips so it would be a familiar looking 'chicken finger' to them!)

Excellent!!  I followed other reviewers and added dry ranch dip mix to the sour cream, marinated the chicken in it for a couple hours in the fridge, then added some spices to the crushed cereal.  I baked it covered w/ foil for 40 min, then 20 min uncovered.  It turned out fabulous!

This chicken was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside, just as expected.  It just needs a little more flavor mixed in with the cornflakes. I guess i needed to up the onion and garlic salt.  It was; however, very easy to prepare on a weeknight with little hands on preparation and an hour worth of baking time to do something else while dinner cooks.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years now.  The BF is picky about chicken, and he loves it!  I simply add garlic powder, Tony Cachere's, salt, pepper, and cayenne to the sour cream, and sometimes a handfull of shredded cheese, coat the chicken in sour cream mix, and then roll in corn flakes.  Drizzle w/ 3-4 Tbsp butter, and bake at 350 for about 45mins.  YUM!

It wasn't the best chicken ever, but it was pretty good. Next time I will try to remember to season both sides of the chicken to give it some more flavor.

This recipe was awesome!! I made it for the first time this past week. It was so moist and flavorful! I tweeked it a little. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and baked it at 400 for 35 mins. Great chicken!! Next time I will use regular bread crumbs and add some Franks Red Hot sauce to the sour cream for some added heat!! LOVED IT!!

Simple & Tasty.  Made this for dinner last night and my husband raved "how did you get it so crispy!??"  Will definitely make it again.  I'd advise two things: #1 as others suggest, season all layers (chicken, sour cream & cornflakes) with what YOU like & taste to make sure it's flavorful; #2 watch cooking time - I thought 20 minutes would suffice (I pounded my chicken thin), but needed another 10 to get good crunch.  I look forward to experimenting with the spices.

This was pretty good. I'd make it again.
I marinated the chicken in the sour cream for about an hour before adding the coating. I used a cereal similar to bran flakes, because that's what I had.

Excellent!  Everyone in my family loved it.  The chicken is so moist and tender.  I used Kellogg's Cornflake Crumbs in a box, rather than crush my own, mainly because that's what I had on hand.  Also, I forgot to drizzle the butter before cooking.  I seasoned the cornflakes with the italian seasoning, onion powder and garlic salt.  If anything, the coating could have a little more seasoning.  That's the only change I would make next time.  This is one recipe I'll cook again.  Thank you!

I was prepared to not like this because we usually like our chicken fried. However, this was pretty tasty! First off, I put the cornflakes in my Magic Bullet (mini blender) to make them very fine. I only used about 1 1/2 cups because I only had 3 boneless skinless chicken breast.I used 1 tsp. Italian seasoning and 1 tsp. garlic powder also. As a personal preference, I cut them into strips instead of baking them whole. Then I put the sour cream with the chicken into a ziplock bag. Refrigerated for about an hour prior to cooking. Then after coating chicken with cornflakes I placed them on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet (several  reviewers had said that their chicken wasn't crispy enough when just placed in the bottom of a pan.) I omitted the butter, as I didn't find it necessary. After 35 to 40 minutes in a 350 degree oven, they were done. I was very pleased at how well these turned out and will definitely make them again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very impressed with this recipe! Based on other reviews, I baked at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. I seasoned the crushed corn flakes with garlic salt, seasoning salt, onion powder and a 1/2 packet of dry ranch dressing. You definitely won't need 2 cups of sour cream. I used probably 3/4 of a cup and my 3 breasts were liberally coated. My husband said he would rate this a 20 if we were comparing it to KFC!

I'm rating the recipe as written. With my changes I would add a star. :) Great recipe to use as a base for some great chicken, but needs more flavour and less cooking time. It might have been good for the recipe author to have included the onion and garlic salt in the Ingredients rather than buried in the directions --  many people seem to have missed that ingredient.

Changes I made: used about a cup of nonfat Greek yogurt mixed with a few tablespoons of Ranch dressing, coated the chicken and let sit in fridge for about an hour before breading.

 I added 1 tsp garlic powder and some generous shakes of all-purpose (Lawry's) seasoning along with the Italian herbs, to the Cornflakes. Baked at 375 for 45 minutes. Breasts were cooked through and perfectly tender and juicy inside. Family loved them.

Wonderful and super easy!  I didn't have sour cream, so I tried Mayo (which I had seen in another recipe) and it worked great!  I also added italian seasoned bread crumbs to the cornflakes instead of other seasonings.  Yummy!!

This chicken was very flavorful and moist.  I did use less sour cream as someone else suggested.  I put about 1 cup of sour cream in a ziplock and added the chicken.  Then I let that sit in the fridge for a few hours.  It turned out wonderful.

I thought this chicken was very good.. not the best as a leftover because it looses its crunch.. but overall it was very good. Hubby enjoyed it as well

Let me start by saying that I don't even like sour cream, but I did with this recipe! I used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes (what I had on hand) and a spice mix that included garlic powder, paprika, fresh ground black pepper, cayenne pepper, poultry seasoning and salt. I only had 4 boneless chicken breasts and so I used 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of bread crumbs... next time I'd only use about 3/4 cup  since there was a good amount of each leftover that had to be discarded. I baked my chicken  at 400 degrees F for about 40 minutes. Chicken  turned out very moist. The leftovers tasted as yummy (if not better than) the first ones.

Delicious. I did what others recommended with the pack of ranch seasoning in with the sour cream, and it really gives it a fun flavor. Also added some poultry seasoning and dill(my favorite spice), and frankly I think you can spice this up with whatever you like, very easy and basic recipe to make your own. I also used NO butter, I can't imagine why you would need it, it crispens up really nice. I have spritz butter and I spritz 2 spritz on each side just to keep it from sticking, but 6 tbsp of butter sounds like a heart attack

Awesome!  My kids devoured this.  I marinated the chicken breasts in sour cream mixed with onion soup mix (gluten free ... my son is celiac) for about an hour and a half.  I then crushed GF corn flakes in my food processor and tossed them with garlic powder before coating the (very thick) breasts.  I baked at 350 for 40 minutes and they were perfect.  This will stay in our rotation!

Well, I’m sorry to say that this didn’t work well for me.  I used half the amount of sour cream (I can’t imagine using the amount indicated) and seasoned it with the rub used in Sarah’s Dry Rubbed Chicken (also from this site).  I also used the same seasoning to season the corn flakes.  I applied the sour cream and corn flakes ahead of time as suggested by another reviewer in the hopes of helping the corn flakes adhere better.  Unfortunately, it didn’t help and when plating the chicken, half of the corn flake mixture fell off.  The corn flakes didn’t get as crispy as I had hoped either, even though I baked them atop a wire rack.  I also believe the baking time of one hour is excessive - mine were done in about 30-35 minutes.  The flavor of this chicken was good, but not one we will be repeating.

This dish was really yummy! I made a couple of modifications basedon other's reviews. First I cut my chicken breast in half to create smaller strips (to reduce cooking time). I only used 3 chicken breasts instead of 6. I coated my chicken with 1 C sour cream and refridgerated for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, I put cornflakes, italian season, pepper, crushed red pepper, garlic powder and minced onion flakes into the food processor to create fine crumbs. I then coated the chicken with the mixture, drizzled melted butter over the top and baked at 375 for 30 minutes. The chicken was cooked through and really moist. It also made for quicker total cook time since I am working and alwas in a rush to get the food on the table. Next time, I will put a half of package of rancth seasoning in my sour cream and cover the chicken with it the night before. My husband loved this and at the leftovers for lunch today! The cornflakes made a really yummy crust around the chicken. I will definitely be making this again.

This turned out PERFECT! Like all the rest, I made many modifications to it. I only used four breasts, soaked it in sour cream for 2 hours. In the meantime I crushed two cups of corn flakes, mixed with a half teaspoon of each; onion salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning mix and salt and pepper. A tablespoon on fresh grated parmesan and Romano cheese and a packet of Lipton Onion soup mix. Drizzled with 5 tablespoon of melted sweet butter. I only baked for 50 minutes @ 350. Then served with homemade mashed potatoes and steamed sweet corn. My boyfriend that is very finicky and raised his nose up when I told him what I was making for dinner... licked his plate clean! It was GREAT!

Good recipe Mae! This isn't the best I've ever had but it is pretty darn good! I only needed 1 1/2c of sour cream but had to use more cornflake topping (apprx 2 1/2c).  This worked well with 5 chicken breasts. Also, I used a little more italian seasoning and also added some garlic/onion powder to taste. Very good and every bite was devoured. Thanks!

It turned out pretty good, but I used a lot less sour cream (don't need so much for the corn flakes to stick!).  I sprinkled with seasoning after putting on the sour cream, then did I roll the chicken in the corn flake mixture.

Everyone in my family really enjoyed this great recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars because I had to change somethings. I added a packet of ranch dressing powder to the two cups of sour cream. I used chicken tenders and let them marinate in the fridge in the sour cream/ranch mix. I omitted the butter and baked them at 400 degrees for 35 minutes. They came out very tender. With proper seasonings this recipe is a winner and very versatile!

My husband without knowing the name of the recipe said "this is the best chicken ever!" lol  I used chicken drumsticks and omitted the melted butter...trying to cut calories. Baked at 375 for 45 minutes. It still turned out wonderful and even my picky 3 year old who has sworn off meat ate it. I love that this recipe only has a handful of ingredients and it bakes while I make the side dishes to complete dinner.  Definitley will go on the top of my recipe list.

Mu husband really liked this but I thought it was just okay. I think the butter on top just made it greasy. I will probably make it again but I will leave off the butter. I like the flavor from the Italian seasoning and the crunch from the corn flake crumbs.

I loved this recipe.  It's one of those recipes that you can change according to how you like your chicken.  The best part is the sour cream.  I did like other reviewers and added ranch dressing to my sour cream then put them in the fridge for a bit so the sour cream would stick to the chicken.  Everyone had commented on how the breading was bland so I decided to go a bit overboard on the seasonings.  Glad I did.  It was amazing.  I added some more of the ranch dressing mix, cayenne, salt, pepper, paprika, parsley flakes, and honestly anything else I thought might be great on fried chicken.  I did cook it differently though.  I had pounded down the breasts so they were thinner and I cooked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. It came out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy!  I added some seasoning salt to the cornflakes and to the sour cream before putting it on the chicken.  I had smaller breast pieces, so it only took about 30 minutes to cook.  My son ate a ton and was asking for more.  Thanks!

My child that is a picky eater ate 2 whole pieces. I used garlic and onion salt in the cornflake mix with pieces of minced onion, and just lightly coated the chicken in reduced fat sour cream and it turned out delicious!

My husband loved this one. Used the ranch mix in the sour cream, finely crushed the corn flakes. It was a big hit. This ones a new family favorite.

I've made "cornflake chicken" before but never with sour cream. This was so good! The sour cream almost disappears while it's cooking, but the chicken stays so moist. We chopped it up and put it on salad. Yummy!

I really liked this recipe. My husband loved it. I put the corn flakes in my food processor and added some Emeril Essence that I made from the Food Network site. I baked it in the oven for exactly an hour and I served it with macaroni and cheese and broccoli. Thanks for a great dinner.

Made this in my Nuwave oven Turned out great. I would add some salk maybe to my meat before coating it. I also added some rosemary to the sour cream before putting chicken in it. It was so tender and juicy with a little tang..but was sooo cripsy.

I like the idea of the sour cream instead of eggs for coating the flakes... thought the recipe was still bland and "heavy". It was okay - I'll probably make it again when I'm craving corn flake chicken

My husband and I loved this recipe. I wouldn't exactly say best chicken ever but definitely good. Things i did differently: For the marinade I did 3/4 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup spicy ranch dressing, but i did still add some of the onion soup mix along with it. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of cornflakes. I also seasoned the bread crumbs with lots of garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe.  Used ranch dressing and panko bread crumbs because it was what I had.  My husband, who is not a big fan of chicken, loved it.It was tasty, tender and simple.  What more can you ask for?

this was a pretty good recipe.  I didn't want to buy a whole box of cornflakes....so I just used some Matzo meal that was already in my cubbard.  I used olive oil instead of the butter to make it a little healthier.  I wouldn't say DELICIOUS....but it was really good!

This was awsome!! I took some advice from others and marinated my chicken in sour cream and ranch dressing for about a hour and threw in a little chili powder and salt in pepper. Then I added seasoning salt, itlian seasoning, and garlic salt to the corn flakes. I also topped it with parmesian cheese before baking! I will make this again for sure!!

I marinated the chicken in sour cream for a couple of hours before I baked. I don't really follow seasoning guidelines for most recipes because I like to use garlic salt, seasoning salt, and various other spices depending on that the dish is. With this one I did season the chicken, sour cream and corn flakes. This smelled great when cooking. The chicken cooked for the 50 minutes and I had it on a cookie sheet instead of a baking dish. This is definitely my go to for chicken breast- it was great.
Thanks for sharing

Wonderfully moist chicken.  Except instead of corn flakes I used a cereal with more flavor like "Honey Nut Clusters".  And I covered it with foil but poked a few holes it in to breath. It was great.  A favorite in our house.

followed directions exactly, cooked the chicken for only 40 minutes and took it out to check how much longer to cook it and it was already way dry. :-( And I only cooked it at 315F instead of 350F! I felt like the seasoning was lacking, Next time I would try using ranch seasoning and maybe using mayonnaise instead of sour cream.

This was very bland and came out dry. Will not make again. To be fair, I did omit the butter. Maybe if I give it another chance, I will make it with the butter.

Amazing! The chicken was super moist and delicious! I can't wait to make this chicken again. I did make a few minor changes based on other reviews. I put the chicken and about 1 cup of sour cream and left it overnight. I added garlic powder, salt and a touch of cayenne to the crushed cornflakes. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My only complaint is that the bottom of the chicken was not as crunchy as the top and a bit too moist. Next time I will bake it on a wire rack so the juice drips down and it crisps all around. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!!

Came out great! Chicken was very tender and juicy. I used 1 1/4 cup sour cream for 4 servings and it was WAY too mouch sour cream.. next time I will opt for 3/4 cup. I added a packet of dry ranch mix into the sour cream to give it some flavor and it added an awesome kick. I also threw in a couple teaspoons of black pepper and oregano into the crushed corn flakes.

I love this chicken. It was easy to make. My boyfriend loved it to. Don't need that much sour cream, but coat generously. Next time I will flatten out chicken breast a little before hand.

The chicken turned out really tender. It was really good, although I added hot sauce on top of it afterwards because a little bit lack of seasoning. The corn flakes make great little holders for the hot sauce ;)

This chicken was very good, was very moist. I used frosted flakes instead and it turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time I will stuff it with cream cheese.

I tried making this on 2 different occasions, thinking I might like it better if I seasoned the chicken differently. Still no luck. I'll stick with parmesan chicken with panko bread crumbs.

Very simple!  We really enjoyed it.  I added some ranch dressing to the sour cream, but I think that was the only change I made - oh and I used Crispix cereal since I had it on hand.

I kinda just stole the sour cream covering idea from you and did chicken breast instead and fried them.It was excellent. 5 stars for your great sour creams idea,I always used egg and milk,but its always been so runny.

Made recipe as directed a few nights ago.  While the chicken was moist, I found this lacked flavor.  I did love the corn flake crunchy texture, but I think I will try this recipe again using some rotisserie chicken seasoning and/or paprika and black pepper added to the sour cream.

Very good for a weeknight meal. Both my husband 
and 2 yr old really liked it. I added the ranch seasoning to the sour cream. I had so much of the sour cream mixture left over. I probably could have cut it in half. I only used about half the butter. i cooked it for 45 minutes. Any longer and it would 

have been too much. Served with mac n cheese and

 mixed veggies.

Used 6 small/average boneless chicken breasts. 2 cups of sour cream is far to much for this amount of chicken and increased the flakes to 5 cups before crushing. I used alot of my favorite spices for chicken in the flakes and used ALOT of them for a stronger flavor.  I also cooked covered at 400 for 35 minutes. End result was PERFECT, AMAZING, DELICIOUS and best of all GONE!! Use 3/4 cup of sour cream, crush the corn flakes very small for better covering on chicken, use alot of your fav seasoning, and cook for 35 min and it wil be PERFECT!!

You leave yourself open to criticism when you call your recipe the best ever.  This isn't the best chicken ever -- it isn't even in contention.  I added lots of extra seasonings, but it still was barely average.  Sorry, thanks for the submission, but this one I won't try again.

So  good!!  I can't wait to make it for company . . and not tell them how I did it!! :)  I used one whole packet of italian sald dressing mix used most of it in with the sour cream. Next time I will put one in with the sour cream and one with the corn flakes. I was scard of using too much . . but now I'm not!! I also put some cheese with the flakes.  Next time I may not use the butter . . . maybe I'll just spray it with Butter Pam. Can't wait to do it again!!

This was very tasty!  I didn't have garlic powder, but I did have chicken seasoning.  I salted and peppered the chicken, followed by the (light) sour cream and then the chicken spice then the corn flakes.  I agree with some of the other folks here about the amount of corn flakes needed; you'll need more than called for. Next time, I'll bake the chicken on a rack inside the pan so that the chicken gets crispy all over.  Thanks for the recipe, Mae Wagner!  Much appreciated.

I have tried this with both chicken tenders and chicken breast and it came out great with both, although i did have some issues with the breading sticking to the bottom... it is quite bland as written, so I added generous heapings of cajun seasoning, cayenne and black pepper to give it more flavor.

Everyone loves it! I add ranch powder to sour cream and cook it a little shorter; stop at 165 exactly so it is more tender.  Last night I made a cream sauce to go with it.  Fabulous!  Two table spoons cream cheese, generous amount ranch power, flour and milk.  My husband and I both really liked it.  **UPDATE**  I have kids now, so I chopped up the chicken into cubes and made it into a casserole...equally yummy, but easier for portions!  Reserve Corn Flakes for topping and drizzle butter over top...perfect!  HUGE HIT!!!

Extremely good.  I followed other suggestions and marinated the chicken approximately 4 hours in 3/4 cup sout cream and 1/4 cup SPICY ranch dressing.  Also, I added paprika, garlic powder and italian seasoning to the corn flakes.

We LOVED this recipe! Yum! Very easy, super moist chicken, and best of all, it is gluten free!! (If you use gluten free cornflakes of course.) It is not easy to find really delicious recipes that are also gluten free, and this one gives you that fried chicken feel without all the oil or gluten. I found that the melted butter was kinda unneccessary though. Tastes just as wonderful without it!

Very good and very easy, but the cook time is a little off.  I took mine out after 45 minutes and the chicken was a little overdone.  Loved the crispy coating though, so thanks for the recipe!

Great, simple and quick recipe!  I definitely added more spices, as others suggested which made it more flavorful.  I was a bit skeptical how would trun out, but actually I loved the corn flake "crust".  It was crunchy and the chicken was very moist.  I, however, only cooked it for about 40 minutes and it was done perfectly.  Thanks for sharing!

I don't know that I'd dub this the "best chicken EVER", but it was pretty tasty.  The seasoned breading does detract from the fact that it's baked chicken.  I found it best, though, when I made it a chicken sandwich.

I tried this recipe a few different ways, with ranch seasoning mixing in the cornflakes, with italian seasoning mixed witht he cornflakes and with garlic salt mixed with the cornflakes. Changing the recipes a little didn't make it much better. I apologize to the creator but it is not the best chicken ever.
Reasons:
no matter how many variations you make with seasoning the sour cream makes the chicken taste bland and gives the chicken a weird creamy look.
No matter what baking dish and amount of cornflakes used the juice from the chicken and the melting sour cream makes the cornflakes get soggy and impossible to stick to the chicken. 
and again, it just turns out so bland.

This was good.  I would make the following changes though.  First I would use THIN skinless and boneless chicken breasts.  I would also cut the butter in half as I found it a little greasy (and believe me I like butter).  Also, I would turn the chicken over half way through cooking as the underside was a little soggy whereas the top was crispy.  
Although I did like this I probably will stick with my original chicken recipe.

I liked this recipe. I changed it up a little. Only because I didn't feel like running out to the store and I only had an individual size box of corn flakes. So I mixed half corn flakes and half French's fried onions (crushed up). It was really good this way too.

This really is the best chicken ever!!  I made some modifications to suit my family's taste for that evening.  First I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings.  Then I added 1/2 packet taco seasoning to the sour cream before coating the chicken.  I also only added 1/8 tsp salt to the crushed corn flakes (didn't want to ruin the flavor of the taco seasoning).  The taste was amazing!!  I served it with spanish rice and a veggie and it was a hit!!  It was moist and tender on the inside and nice and crunchy on the outside (Oh, I also omitted the butter drizzled on the top.  I don't think it needs it).  Next time I will try, as others have suggested, adding Ranch dressing mix to the sour cream.  I can only imagine that the flavor will be wonderful made that way too. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

This came out delicious! I marinated the chicken for 1.5 hours in the fridge. I baked 6 chicken breasts, adding to the recipe one packet of onion soup mix, onion salt, lemon pepper, and once it was out of the oven, drizzled lemon juice over the chicken. It was so juicy inside and crispy outside.Even the underside was crispy! My fiance loved it as well.

Very, very good! I found it very messy to coat the chicken with sour cream but other than that, it was so simple and the result is delicious and the chicken is so flavorful and crispy. Like the others, I eyed the sour cream and cornflake crumbs. I marinated the chicken in sour cream and then also coated it and still used less than 2 cups. I added salt, pepper and Italian seasoning to the cornflake crumbs. It's a keeper!

Delicious! Even my fiance and Dad (who are not big chicken-lovers) LOVED this! I added about 1 tsp. each of salt, pepper, garlic salt, and montreal chicken spice to the cornflake crumbs. I also ommitted the butter. Baked 4 large chicken breasts for 45 mins and they were done wonderfully. So moist and YUMMY!

Tasty, but as other reviewers did, I added more spices to the breading mixture(garlic powder, seasoning salt, and more Italian seasoning - be generous as amount indicated in ingredients is a bit bland).  Be generous with the sour cream, that is a good source of flavor in the chicken. P.S. - An easy way of crushing the corn flakes is to put into a ziploc bag and mash with just abotu anything.

This recipe was amazing! I was moist, tasty, and very different. I loved it as did my picky boyfriend. I used the variation by kbresler: --soaked it in sour cream for 2 hours. --In the meantime I crushed two cups of corn flakes (the best way I found to do this was put a little in a bowl at a time and then get a matching bowl and crush them between) --mixed with a half teaspoon of each; onion salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning mix and salt and pepper. --A tablespoon on fresh grated parmesan and Romano cheese and a packet of Lipton Onion soup mix. --Drizzled with 5 tablespoon of melted sweet butter (for those that don't know unsalted butter) --50 minutes @ 350...

Great, simple recipe. Sometimes I use mayo instead of sour cream; same concept, slightly different taste. I also add parm cheese to corn flakes or  bread crumbs, maybe some paprika or chili powder just to kick it up a bit.

Husband loved it and it's so simple (and easily improvised)!  I didn't have enough corn flakes (actually, Special K) so I added grated parmasan cheese, bread crumbs, and crushed goldfish crackers.  I also forgot the butter, but it still tasted wonderful!

I've been making this for years but with a variation.  I use 1-part grated parmesan cheese to 2-parts cornflake crumbs.  Also, I've made this using Miracle Whip and Mayo.  All are tasty!

This was soo quick and easy! I was very generous with the sour cream and the chicken breasts came out so delicious! ---crispy on the outside and juicy/tender on the inside. Will definitely make it again. Perfect for people who are cramped for time!

Excellent.  I used McCormick Italian Seasoning grinder and added garlic and onion powder to corn flakes.  I only used 1-1/2 cups sour cream and 2 cups corn flakes with five decent sized chicken breats (probably 1 - 1-1/2 lbs).  Definately a keeper.

So simple and cheap, with such great results. I would have never thought to use corn flakes to coat chicken, it was so crunchy and flavorful. It's great to add your own spices of choice to the coating, I used finley grated parmesan cheese and minced garlic, came out sooo flavorful. Thank you!

Not bad!  I did add a bunch of spices, otherwise it would be too bland.  Next time I might take the advice of adding the french onion soup mix.  (I read the reviews after it was in the oven!)

I made several modifications to this recipe that I thought kicked it up a notch.  I added seasonings and S&P to the sour cream.  I also used herb stuffing mix (Stove Top) for the topping instead of cornflakes.  It added a bit more 'crunch' to the dish.  Drizzled with butter and baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  A one-dish chicken and stuffing meal!

This recipe is very easy and gets a lot of compliments.  I use "Salad Supreme" seasoning, instead of the garlic/italian seasonings they mention, and it has a wonderful blend of flavors.

This recipe was wonderful!!!  I only made 4 breasts so I used about 1 cup of sour cream.  I also added garlic powder and onion salt along with the italian seasoning.  I also made ranch mashed potatoes and a veggie that was perfect with it.  The chicken was moist and everyone in my family loved it!  I will definately make this again as it was so simple and quick!

This was simple! And the cornflake coating was a nice twist. If you like a little crunch with your chicken, this is for you. The chicken was especially tender and my boyfriend ate the whole thing! Overall a good, standard recipe. Even I could make it!

Definitely giving this 5 stars-Like fried chicken! I had a box of cornflakes no one was eating, so this was the perfect recipe to get the leftover cereal out of the pantry and surprisingly delicious!!! Made one change- I didn't use Italian seasoning- I added garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika (like a any good Hungarian would do) to the sour cream, baked on convection 375 for 45 minutes. Will definitely make again!

This was yummy. I'm a hot sauce junkie, so I ended up putting some hot sauce in the sour cream mixture along with the ranch packet. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

This recipe is so good, it tolerates substitutions well.  I didn't have sour cream, so I used 3/4 c. Greek yogurt, 1/4 c light  Mayo and 1/4 c grated parmesan.  I seasoned the chicken on both sides with garlic salt and pepper before brushing the yogurt mixture on each side.  After that I followed the recipe directions. SO delicious.  I am going to experiment with substituting tempeh for the chicken!  Thank you Mae!

I only used 2 skinless, bone-in chicken breasts that I marinated in a 1/2 cup of buttermilk and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce for a couple of hours. Then I sprinkled a bit of garlic powder, onion powder and freshly cracked pepper over them before rolling them in the cornflake crumbs. I baked them for an hour in a 350 degree oven and they were so moist and tasty. Next time, I think that will sprinkle some freshly grated Parmesan cheese on them before baking them. I served the chicken breasts with sides of: made-from-scratch potato pancakes, made-from-scratch creamy chicken gravy (for topping the potato pancakes with) and steamed carrots.

These were dry. I don't think that they need to cook for an hour. They did have a nice crunch to them, but they didn't live up to their name for us.

I just made this dish, and my friend really enjoyed it.  I wasn't so into the flavor of the sour cream with the corn flakes.  I used Daisy SC and Trader Joes corn flakes (I LOVE these corn flakes by themselves.)

This wasn't too bad... I put some of the cornflakes in the blender for finer crumbs and some I just crushed in a baggie with a meat mallet for bigger ones.  I seasoned the heck outta the crumbs but next time I think I will try what a lot of others did and use powdered ranch dressing with the sour cream and then put it on the chicken.  Then I will cut back on the seasonings in the crumb mixture.  I butterflied my chicken breasts and cut them smaller so I only cooked them for like 35 mins MAX.  They came out perfectly cooked.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was disappointed in this dish.  The final product was very bland.  Given such positive ratings from 350+ reviewers, I have to assume that I made some error in the preparation.  It's just that this dish calls for such a short list of ingredients and cooking steps that I'm not sure where I could have gone wrong.  The only ingredient I left out was the margarine...could that really make the difference between best ever and bland?  Maybe I have developed such a taste for spicy food that a good but basic chicken dish doesn't do much for me.  If anyone has troubleshooting ideas, please let me know.

It needed a little more seasoning. I think next time I make it I will add the hidden valley ranch mix to the sour cream and see if that helps like others suggested.

Pretty good. Cut dowon on the sour cream (3/4 cup) and seasoned chicken with Season all, garlic powder, onion powder and italian seasoning. Turned out juicy.  I wouldn't bake over 40 min at 400 degrees. 35 min is ideal.

Even my very picky daughter loved this! I used Corn Chex instead of Cornflakes so it would be gluten free, and I used chicken tenders. It was super easy, and the result was crunchy and delicious.

Chicken was very tender and flavorful (I added ranch dressing and onion soup mix to the sour cream). My toddler gobbled it up, so that was a bonus.

Maybe not the best chicken ever, but pretty tasty.  I followed some of the other reviews and added some dry ranch seasoning to the sour cream.  I also let the chicken sit in the sour cream mixture for an hour or so before cooking.  I coated with italian seasoned panko crumbs (did not have corn flakes on hand) and cooked for about 40-45 minutes and broiled for about 5-10 to try and crisp up the outside.   Chicken was juicy and had good flavor, but was not my favorite way to prepare chicken.

After reading the reviews i ommitted the sour cream, floured the chicken before dipping in anything and I used a half mayo/half milk combo.  I added about a T of ranch to the cornflakes.  I cut the breast into strips and placed on aluminum foil for easier cleanup.  I also baked at 375 for about 35 min.  My hubby thought this was delicious

Instead of using cereal, I made this using bread crumbs and it was great! I followed the advice of another user and refrigerated the chicken in the sour cream for about half an hour and it really stuck to the chicken. This is a delicious recipe and will definitely be making again.

This was a very tasty chicken.  Maybe not the "best chicken ever", but my husband and I enjoyed it last night.  I soaked the chicken breasts in the sour cream, (I used lite sour cream) I used the suggestions to add a package of dry ranch dressing mix and mixed it up with the sour cream.  Put it all in a covered dish and let it soak in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.  Pulled it out, coated it with the smushed up cereal.  I forgot to season the chicken before.  I think it would be wise to add whatever seasonings you like before putting on the cereal coating.  Salt, pepper, garlic salt, onion salt, whatever you prefer.  It was moist and delicious.  I cooked for 50 minutes and the chicken was tender and juicy.  I made it with the glazed carrots from this site as well.  Yummy meal!

Amazing! This chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and delicious. I will definitely make it again! I wasn't sure how much onion and garlic to add as seasoning, but I made a few dashes, and that ended up being fine. Also, I had four large chicken breasts instead of six, but kept the same amount of sour cream and crushed corn flakes. Perfect.

I made this with the suggestion of others- mixed some ranch dressing with the sour cream (about 3/4 cup of sour cream with 1/4 cup ranch) and brushed it on the chicken breast.  I covered the dish and let them marinade in the fridge for 1 1/2 hours then coated with corn flake crumbs seasoned with garlic powder, paprika, italian seasoning and pepper.  DH raved about the moist chicken and he doesn't like chicken. Thanks for a delicious and moist chicken!

Giving it three stars, I probably will make this again. It was easy and a quick way to dress up chicken (and we buy the large bags of frozen chicken breasts, so this was an inexpensive way to add some variety to our meals). That said, I would coat the chicken VERY heavily in the sour cream and make sure that you crush the cornflakes VERY finely.

When I fixed this I added a little oinon powder and garlic powder.  I found it was too dry for my Mom to eat without a sauce, so I took a can of cream of cicken soup added 3/4 can of milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It was GREAT.  Tasted even better the second day.

So easy to make, which is a real bonus. The directions don't say what to do with the Italian seasoning, but I just mixed it, some lemon pepper, and some pureed garlic into the sour cream. Even really big boneless chicken breasts only took 45 minutes, so be careful not to over cook this dish. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good with some minor adjustments.  First I crushed the corn flakes in a food processor and it was quick and easy. I added 1 pkg of hidden family ranch to the crushed corn flakes along with 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, onion powder and paprika and the chicken came out very flavorful.

I have never made chicken breasts that turned out this moist!  I used rice krispies for the cereal and it was great.  Also I used about a half cup of sour cream and refrigerated the coated chicken for a half an hour.  My only complaint is that the breading on the bottom of the chicken was mushy.

This is my favorite chicken but I use another version which is adding 1 tablespoon of Lawry's seasoning salt in the sour cream, adds immense flavor and softens the meat. I also use Ritz crackers, crushed fine, for a buttery flavor too. I bake at a lower temperature 325 for 1 1/2 hours. This ensures that the coating doesn't melt off of your meat, plus do not cover with foil this causes the coating to come off. Make sure you let the chicken rest for 15-20 minutes, allows the coating to stay on the chicken when biting into it.

This was okay. My husband liked it. I'm not sure if it was the temp or the sour cream, but our chicken was a bit soggy.

Chicken was moist and delicious!  I changed this a little though:  I used grill seasoning instead of the recommended italian, and I used finely crushed corn tortilla chips because I was all out of cornflakes (oops!) it still came out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, very easy to make.  I only had to cook mine for 45 minutes, any longer would have over done it so make sure you watch the time.  Will definitely make again.

This was really very delicious. I wouldn't change anything, but would add to be sure that you dont over-season the corn flakes. I like alot of flavor, so i added season-all and some other seasonings to the cornflakes. This was a (my) mistake! this made the recipe way too salty. Anyway this was delicious and the chicken was moist. it got a little messy in the preparation, but thats to be expected. thanks for a new recipes to change things up!

This was very tasty.  I ground the cereal in my food processor so I was able to give the chicken a nice coating.  I also added some seasonings to the crumbs before coating.  I eye-balled the sour cream and just put a dallop on each breast and rubbed it on.  I would make this again (especially since it's baked and not fried!)

Literally, one of the best chicken dishes ever! The only thing I changed was instead of using cornflakes, I used honey almond flakes cereal. The girls loved helping me "smash" the cereal in the bag! Chicken was so moist and delicious. This was an instant family favorite!

We loved this recipe.  I did not measure the sour cream, just added enough to make a good sticking layer for the corn flakes.  I   also added a little garlic salt to the sour cream.  Overall, excellent.

I made this for my wife, and we both thought it needed a little heat. It has a nice tangy and crunchy flavor.When I prepare this dish again,I am going to make it with panko and mayo,but all in all,it is a quick meal for two.

I thought this was ok, but do not make it if anyone you're serving dislikes sour cream. My husband hates it, but sometimes I can sneak it in the recipe, knowing it'll be disguised. Not so with this recipe. You can totally taste the SC. I liked the fact that it was different than any chx I've made, but I found  that it did not do well for seconds the next day. The cornflakes are all soggy and it just didn't have the same overall taste. Was my family fed for a night? Yes, absolutely. So thank you for that :)

Great recipe. I made this tonight and it went over very well. I did follow many of the other "cooks" suggestions in regards to extra cornflakes, less sour cream (1 cup) and I added the half packet of ranch mix, plus a little paprika. This was a wonderful recipe, and the chicken turned out very moist. Thank you. I will be sure to add it to the list!

I thought this recipe was good and my 3 boys ages 15,12,and 10 thought it was good also..I did follow the instructions from others to put in the fridge first and that helped but I did leave it on the pan when I took it out of the oven and it still continue to cook it which made it alittle drier inside. Next time I will shorten the time in the oven and take it right off the pan..

Pretty good. I took into account what others wrote though and modified. I did use the butter and it came out a little soggy in some spots. My 8 year old didn't like it for some reason but my 22 month old did.

This was fantastic. I was having guests over for dinner and made this dish. It got rave reviews. I used other recommendations - 6 c. cornflakes, refrigerating chicken coated with sour cream for an hour, garlic & onion powder in crushed cornflakes. I also mixed onion soup mix with the sour cream because I did not have any of the other suggestions on hand. It was delicious!! Definitely make a lot, I had 6 breasts of chicken and 6 guests and my husband was looking for more! This will be a staple chicken dish in our house. I only gave 4 stars because I altered the original recipe.

pretty good. i love baking chicken for how moist and tender it is afterwards but the flaky crust was almost too much breading for me. but it was still a good base chicken -- doused in bbq sauce, we loved it.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, but not great.  I seasoned my chicken breasts with S&P and garlic & onion powders, coated them in sour cream (used way less than the recipe called for, maybe 1/3 c) and let them chill for about an hour before pressing into crushed corn flakes.  I baked them on a rack over my cookie sheet so the bottoms wouldn't get soggy.  I felt that the tops remained soggy where I drizzled the butter (again, I used a lot less than called for) and had to cook too long to get them crispy on the edges.  I did raise the over temp to 400 as I pounded my breasts to about 1/3 inch thick and cooked them for about 35 minutes.  Pretty good for not frying them, but not as good as fried chicken breasts.  I may try frying them in olive oil next time rather than using my standard egg/bread crumb coating.

We thought that this chicken was great! Very tasty. I added ranch mix to the sour cream, which gave it flavor. The corn flakes give the chicken a nice crunchy coating as apposed to bread crumbs. This is definitely going in my recipe box!

I gave the recipe 4 stars because I changed a few things about it. I added 1/4 cup of shredded italian cheese. (A store-bought blend of parm and asiago)I seasoned the recipe myself due to dietary constraints of the family. I also used corn chex instead of corn flakes, something I have never done before. It made a huge difference, it made the flavor unique. But the recipe is a good guideline-portions are correct, cook time is correct. Everyone wanted seconds! Make sure you make enough!

WOW!  Great flavor. My fiancé never had chicken cooked this way.  I AM A STAR… YEAH..

   I read most of the reviews and decided to add one can of cream of onion soup and the Zesty Italian dressing to the sour cream (reduced the sour cream by 1 cup). I also reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes - because I used frozen skinless tenderloins.  
Also, used more cornflakes. Didn't crush them all up, which made it more crunchy.  I too used parmesan cheese with each piece of chicken drizzled with butter... mmmmmmmmmmmm good.
Thanks for the recipe.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was good but I will make some changes next time I make it.  First, I used some ranch mix but didn't use enough.  Next time I think I will add the ranch mix to the sour cream.  The chicken was very bland.  Also, 60 minutes was way too long and they ended up very dry.

So good! I definitely would "marinate" the chcken in one packet of Ranch Dip Mix to give it that extra flavor. My whole family loved it!

This was great!  I made a few changes.  I added Italian dressing seasoning to the sour cream earlier in the day (so the flavors could blend together).  I also used frosted flakes b/c that is what I had in the house.  Everyone liked this.  I think next time I will try golden onion soup mix with the sour cream and add some spices to the cereal for more flavor.

This chicken was super yummy! I did have to add a lot more sour cream then it asked for. I used a season package that you would use for a soup and added it into the sourcream. Also, I added cheese to the top while it was in the oven to let it melt right before it was done. I would totally make this again because it was SUPER easy. I'm a college kid who is just starting to learn how to cook and I did this one great. (Dont plan on left overs, it is soggy the next day)

I wouldn't necessarily call it the best ... kind of bland.  Not a lot of spice to it.  It was a nice try, but lacks something.

This was very good.  For the seasoning I used some of the dry Hidden Valley ranch dressing mix as I had some leftover from another recipe.  It was so good and smelled wonderful while it cooked.

Very tasty recipe. The crumbs fall off when you turn the chicken so just pile them back on as they seem to stick very well. I put them under the broiler to crisp up the crust and it was very enjoyable. Will be a keeper!

We loved this recipe.  I used Shake 'n Bake instead.  The butter added a nice flavor and color.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good the sour cream was!  Thanks for sharing!

Great easy recipes, the 4 year old loved and so did my wife and company.
Used less sour cream and added diced garlic over the chicken withthe butter, but other wiseas written.

I follwed some of the tips from the other reviewers. The first time I made it I added McCormick veggie dip to the sour cream and glaric powder.  Added different seasonings to the corn flakes.  I thought it didn't have any favour and was too wet but the chicken was very moist.  One cup of the sour was too much so before I did the chicken I set half of it aside to be used as a side dip with the meal.  My boy friend loved it too much he showed up last night with all the ingredients and asked me to make it for him again.  this time I didn't drizzle the butter over the chicken and it still came out too wet for my liking.

I gave this five stars for ease!  I made this for my folks and my father didn't even criticize it (a rarity)!  My only complaint would be that the cornflakes were a bit soggy.  I did add a good amount of seasons (salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and paprika) otherwise it may have been too bland.  Also, I really piled on the sour cream (I used lite) and I probably only used about half.  I don't know how anyone could get the full two cups on six pieces.  Finally, the baking dish size they recommend would be for very small breasts.  I had to fan the chicken to get it to fit.  All and all it was really good and super easy!  Next time I’ll try adding parmesan so other cooks recommended.  I’ll probably add oregano too to give the flavor a little more direction.

This was an exceptionally easy recipe to make.  I would add a package of onion soup mix to the sour cream and maybe just some black pepper to the cornflakes next time.  I turn up the oven to 475 for 10 minutes (cover the food) to seal in the juices - excellent! This is a great recipe to make if you near the end of your cereal box or if your kids refuse to eat the healthy cereals that come in the variety packs!

This is a different way to prepare ordinary chicken breasts.  I added a bit of Parmesan and Cheddar cheese (after reading the "Cheddar chicken" recipe).  It was yummy.

Printed recipe and gave to my husband for him to cook because I had to work late.  The dish was absolutely delicious.  We even added shredded cheddar to the cornflake mixture.  We always tenderize chicken breast by beating it and it made it unbelievably moist and delicious.  I've passed this on to friends!  Definetly a keeper.

Wonderful, the whole family loved it.  I switched the amounts of sour cream and corn flakes.  4 - 6 cups of sour cream just seemed like *way* too much!  2 cups of corn flakes wasn't enough.  I reversed those 2 and it was just about perfect.

I loved this recipe and only made a few changes because I was using ingredients on hand. I exchanged the corn flakes out with Italian style bread crumbs. I mixed some Parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs and this gave it even more flavor. I followed the rest of the recipe as is. It was one of the moistest chicken dishes I have ever had. I was skeptical about all that sour cream, but it was a winner! I will definitely try the cornflakes next time.

This is definitely one of our favorite chicken meals. I mix about a half a packet of dry ranch seasoning mix to the sour cream. I coat the chicken and let it set overnight. To the corn flakes I add onion powder and garlic salt. I do not add melted butter to the coating as we like it crispy. This probably took about 50 minutes at 350 degrees.

Easy and very good. I added 1 pgk of onion soup mix to the sour cream and then used Rice Crispies instead of corn flakes added some pepper to the mix with 1 tsp of crushed garlic!

This was a bit bland...I cut back butter as advised by most reviews but found the crumbs don't stick real well.  The chicken was super moist...may try again with a mayo layer instead of egg.

Lots of crunch to this chicken. It's a tad on the messy side to make but tastes great. I followed it exactly as is. I would add a bit more herbs and spices next time so it's not too bland, but it's a great base recipe to play around with. Makes a nice change if you're tired of same old shake'n bake. A new go-to recipe for me. Thanx!!

This was a great recipe, my family loved it! After reading some of the reviews I decided to make some modifications, I added ranch dressing mix into the sour cream and placed the chicken in the refrigerator for a few hours before cooking. I also seasoned the bread crumbs (I used italian bread crumbs, since I didn't have cornflakes) with garlic salt, pepper, ms. dash original blend and garlic powder, all to taste. I also drizzled melted butter over the chicken to help browing. It was great!

I have to be honest.  I love chicken but this recipe really left me feeling 'chickened out!'.  My husband and I both agree it was JUST chicken.  Nothing outstanding or extremely delicious about it. I made it 'as is' so the 'improvements' may add some flavor.

I really loved this recipe! Couple of changes.. I used bran flakes (more fiber), and after putting the chicken in the SC I sprinkled lowrys, onion powder, garlic powder, and italian season directly on the chicken.. then rolled in the flakes. Also went light on the butter... Chicken was SO SO moist and Good! Thanks so much for this GEM.

I thought the flavor was really really good.  I added lots of garlic, oregano, thyme, basil, salt and pepper directly on the chicken with the sour cream.  The reason I rated it so low is because the chicken turned out really tough.   I don't know if it was just over cooked or what.  I cooked it for 50 minutes instead of an hour and maybe I should have just cooked it for 30 or something....I think I'll try it again sometime.

Followed some ideas from the other reviews as far as adding a little more spice. The chicken was moist and taste. I did let the sour cream sit on the chicken for over a half hour in the fridge

I made this for my hubby last night - and although this review is coming from a vegetarian - he really liked it!  I followed the recipe quite closely except I only made half the recipe and I used 1 lb. of tenderloins (less traumatic to prepare for a veggie).  I also mixed in a touch of ranch  with the sour cream since I didn't have any good seasoning (like onion or garlic) other than the Italian spices.  The first 20 minutes in the oven were @ 450  degrees because I was also making buttermilk buscuits.  Left for another 45 or so at 350 and they were very nice and crispy but tender in the inside.    Enjoy!

Delicious! I love how the sour cream makes the chicken super moist. The only change I did was instead of italian seasoning I just threw in some salt and pepper and some cayenne for a kick. Great chicken!

Just ok.  The chicken didn't have much flavor but I did like the crunchy outside.  Next time I will marinate the chicken and use the corn flakes for breading.

Excellent recipe - followed reviewers' suggestion and added one-half package ranch dressing mix to sour cream.  Also added onion salt, garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper, and dried parsley to the cornflakes.  The chicken was tender, juicy, and delicious - one of the best recipes on this site so far.  My husband and all three sons love it!

This was not the best chicken ever.  It was okay - tasted like cornflakes and seasonings and most of all sour cream.  Way too much like sour cream.  The breading was good at least and it looked pretty!  I added the ranch mix to the sour cream and let it set for a couple of hours as suggested but it was just...not great.  Maybe I should have wiped the sour cream off before breading?

I used 1 cup of cornflake crumbs & 1 cup of cheeze-its crumbs...I did not have enough of the cornflakes.  I also drizzled olive oil over the top but I  think you could leave out the butter or olive oil & get a nice crunchy result.  This is a great recipe to experiemnt with diferent coatings &/or seasonings.  The chicken was tenderr & it was sooo easy!

This was really great.  I used my magic bullet to make the corn flakes into a fine powder and used  half plain yogurt and half ranch dressing instead of sour cream.  Seasoned with garlic salt and onion flakes.  Will be making this again for sure!

It was good but I think I used too thick chicken, thinner would be better. I just laid then on a cookie sheet thickly spread mayo, sprinkled garlic powder and italian seasoning followed by crushed corn flakes.  Used less than one cup mayo for four big chicken breasts.

This is a great recipe for tasty and moist chicken breasts. I used ranch dressing instead of sour cream, and seasoned the crushed cornflakes with onion powder, garlic salt, pepper and a bit of Italian seasoning. I think sour cream would not have provided as much flavor, but if you season the chicken it would probably work.

This recipe was amazing! Instead of using regular chicken breasts I used the chicken breast tenderloins (just a thinner cut). I too did half sour cream and half ranch dressing. And seasoned them with garlic, onion, and pepper. This is one of my new favorites!!!

I'm a sucker for sour cream. In my house, we put our cereal in unmarked tupperware so it last longer, so I ended up making this with frosted flakes the first time. Once I did it right, it was worth it.

I wouldn't say it's the best chicken ever, but it is the best oven-fried chicken I've ever had. I can't fry chicken (or so I've been told), so this will become my alternative to frying. I followed others suggestions in that I used used bread crumbs (I didn't have corn flakes) and I used ranch dressing instead of sour cream (I didn't want to go to the store). I did marinate it for 1 1/2 hours. I baked it at 400 degrees for fifty minutes because I had fat chicken breasts. It was very moist and juicy. My only downfall was that I didn't broil it for a few minutes before taking out of oven. I wish I had because the crust would've held better. But overall, I would definitely make it again.

This was the best oven "fried" chicken I have had. I added a little milk and one egg to the sour cream because I only had one cup of it. I used Special K cereal. This was even delicious the next day reheated, still crispy. Would be great on drumsticks!

A blast from the past.  My mother used to make this when I was a kid.  She used chicken pieces and mayo instead of sour cream, but boy was it good.  This is also very good, and much healthier using the chicken breasts and sour cream.

this was okay. I agree that it needs more seasonings of some kind.  I am always looking for something my 2 year old will eat (believe me, it is very hard) and this wasn't it.  The rest of my family ate it.  I will make again as it is really easy and tastes good.

This turned out much better than I anticipated.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions/ideas because I didn't have corn flakes so I used tortilla chips.  The only caution on this is that the tortilla chips made it a little more salty.  I added ranch to the sour cream.  Excellent.  Extremely moist.  I did have to cook for the full hour because I only could fit 3 boneless chicken breasts in a 9x13 and they were still partially frozen -- yes they were huge and it fed 7 people with a breast left over.

This was quite good. I used reduced fat sour cream (next time I think I'll use fat free) and mixed in some dry ranch packet dressing.  I also put onion powder, garlic powder and Italian seasonings in with the cornflakes.  Cooked for about 40 minutes at 400 degrees and it came out quite moist and delicious.

Overall this was a really good recipe and very easy. Typically I find recipes dont call for enough cook time and I felt like this one called for too much. No biggie though since I am a borderline finatic about watching my food cook. I made the mistake of overseasoning like a few others did. Wasnt bad just didnt need as much seasioning as I thought. Will definitely do again with minor adjustments.

I am a beginner at cooking and I made this for a party of eight. It came out amazing. Everyone gobbled theirs up. I used frosted flakes instead of cornflakes which I was worried it would be to sweet. It turned out very well. I didnt measure the sour cream out just coated them. I also used diferrent seasoning like seasoning salt, onion powder, galic and rosemary. Just a lil pinch. Would make again.

These were really good I would just add herbs or spices to increment the flavor.

The recipe wasn't as great as I thought it would be, the cornflakes didn't really stick to it well and I ran short of the cornflakes fast so I had to add more. I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out kind of greasy with the cornflakes falling off, I had to be very careful. Me and my fiance are very cautious about eating healthy, so the greasiness after it was cooked and other things kind of turned us away from making it again.

The possibilities for this chicken dish are endless.  For seasoning I used Italian seasoning & garlic powder.  But, you could use any combination of spices you wanted!

I let the chicken soak in the sour cream/ranch seasoning mix for 5 hours. 4 breasts took about 40 mins to cook. My whole family loved it, even the 4 year old ate it (without ketchup I might add). Next time I may bake it on a cookie sheet as the bottom was a little soggy. Didn't use the melted butter either.

Ok, so I liked the fact that this was an easy recipe in that I had everything needed on hand but it just seemed bland. I added seasonings to it (garlic salt and italian seasoning) and was extra generous with the sour cream (as others have suggested) but it still came out ho-hum. My husband loved it though so that's a plus.

The flavor was great (I did, however, follow the advice of another user who recommended marinating it in sour cream with onion soup mix prior to breading).  Unfortunately, the bottom of the chicken got all soggy from the chicken juices as it cooked.  I greased the pan as the recipe called for, but the underside was all soggy and goopy.  I'm sure it was my own fault.  I baked it at 400 for 35 minutes and the chicken was cooked perfectly!I'll try this again and maybe put it on a different oven pan that will not allow the chicken to sit in the juices.  Great recipe!  This is a keeper!

I made this with another reviews suggestion of adding onion soup to the sour cream! It was GREAT! I also made a mixture of crushed cornflakes, ritz crackers, and a little bit of italian bread crumbs. It was good but I will make it with only cornflakes next time as I think that may be the reason it had some soggy parts. Otherwise, tasted GREAT and the meat was SOOOO juicy and tender! My husband now calls it my "heavenly chicken" lol

The name of this recipe says it all! I made it last night and it was soooo delicious! In the body of the recipe, it didn't mention the Italian seasoning, so I forgot to add it. Once I realized I had forgotten, I just sprinkled it over the top of all the chicken after it was in the oven. LOL! Fantastic!!!

This recipe was good; I'll make it again with some minor spice adjustments. I marinated the chicken breasts in buttermilk ranch dressing for about an hour. I used corn flakes and rice flakes and added some garlic powder, onion powder, fresh ground pepper, Creole seasoning, and red pepper flakes. I crushed this all up and dipped the chicken into it and placed them on a parchment covered cookie sheet. Since I only cooked two boneless chicken breasts I kept them in the oven for about 30 minutes. They were rather juicy, but the coating just wasn't my cup of tea. My boyfriend liked it and was looking for more. Next time I make this I think I will adjust my spices, I think that is where I went wrong. Other than that, it was good and I'll probably make this again.

This truly was a great recipe! I used low fat sour cream and half a packet of chili seasoning mix and put the chicken breasts in it to marinate in the refrigerator.  I didn't have corn flakes so I used a combination of coating mixture that consisted of crushed items: town house crackers, panko, Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and chow mein noodles.  I drizzled olive oil on the baking sheet, but did not drizzle butter on top.  Halfway through as others suggested, I turned the chicken over.  The better the cut of chicken breast that is used, the better they come out.  I had two different kinds and they looked completely different.  The ones that were butterflied and could lay out flat did well.  The ones that didn't and that I didn't butterfly myself, didn't look as good, but still came out good.  For looks, I would choose the butterflied breast.  They were moist, but you couldn't guess that sour cream was used at all.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe.  I used some of the suggestions listed here.  Added the onion soup to the mixture, and put the chicken in the fridge after putting the sour cream on it.  That seemed to help a lot.  I also had it in the oven for less time than suggested.  I think it depends on the thickness/size of the chicken breats you use.  Mine would have been dried out had I kept it in for as long as suggested.

This is wonderful!! The chicken was moist not dry.  I did substitute and add my own ingredients.  I used fat free sour cream and added 1 /2 cup of Progresso Italian bread crumbs to 3 individual Kellogs corn flake boxes.  Instead of drizzling butter, I coated the bottom of the pan with extra virgin olive oil.  Yum!!!

Had to use 3 single serve boxes of corn flakes, so this fit the bill, but no one in the family was all too crazy about it. Not that crunchy, and a tad bit greasy. Probably won't make it again.  Thanks for the idea, though.

These were so crunchy! I used light sour cream, and a bit of ranch seasoning instead of Italian. I let the chicken sit in the sour cream/ranch mixture, in the fridge, for about an hour. I omitted the butter. Couldn't taste the sour cream at all, which I think is a good thing. As crunchy as fried chicken, but healthier. This recipe is a keeper!

I was interested in trying this recipe but, since my husband and I are trying to drop a few pounds, I decided to omit the sour cream from the recipe. I replaced it with some diet creamy ranch dressing, added a touch of Parmesan cheese and onion soup mix to the corn flake crumbs, fresh cracked pepper, seasoning salt, onion powder, garlic powder and parsley flakes. I baked the chicken for about 50 minutes and served it with baked potatoes and glazed carrots. My family loved it and my daughter couldn't stop eating it, even though she normally dislikes most chicken dishes. Thank you for this recipe -- it was delicious!

The sour cream overpowered the flavors, in my opinion. My husband was the only one who would want this again. I will use this recipe again, only I'll either scale down the sour cream or simply dip the chicken in milk instead.

i really liked this recipe because of how easy it is to make.  i cut up my chicken and made chicken salads which were awesome. i also let the chicken marinade in the sour cream for at least an hour an d that made the chicken juicy.

I made this when my family came over to my new home for the first time, so I really wanted to make a good impression. No worries! They loved it! I took someone's suggestion and added ranch mix to the sour cream for a little extra flavor and it was awesome. To play devil's advocate, the meat was ever so slighty drier than I'd like, so next time I'll cook it at a slightly lower temp.

I think it would be a 5 if I did it right. I cover the dish when baking and it was quite moist in there.

I made this today and it tasted pretty good. The only problem was it was a little bit dry. I used a lot of sour cream and I even marinated it with sour cream and zesty italian dressing. Maybe I cooked it too long. It baked for about 50 minutes. My guests seemed to like it though.

We loved this idea! The sour cream made the chicken sooooo moist! I used the advice of refridgerating the sour cream coated chicken by placing it in a zipper baggie and letting it thaw that way. I was actually looking for a good lemon pepper chicken recipe and adapted this to make an incredible lemon pepper chicken! It was fantastic! I also used this idea to make chicken parmesan that was amazing! Thanks for the idea! We'll have to try it the original way when we have corn flakes in the pantry!

I found this recipe to be okay. It was a little bland for my taste, and I used a lot of sour cream! We ate it and got full, however, I don't think I will make it again.

This was a fantastic recipe! I loved the chicken and sour cream. Even my very picky kids loved this!  The chicken was perfect and tasted great. We are big into sauces, so we topped it off with a sour cream, buter, garlic salt, bay leaf and pepper sauce. We heated the sauce and poured it right on top of the chicken. It was perfect.

I really like this. The sour cream makes the chicken creamier. I used italian seasoning bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes. I also added some Mrs. Dash Italian seasoning. We also added mozzerella cheese on top. I loved it! It was easy!

I made this last night and it was GREAT! I did add ranch seasoning to the sour cream and Parmesan cheese and garlic powder to the corn flake crumbs, then when it was all in the pan I sprinkled feta cheese on top. About 50 minutes and it was done. My picky boyfriend even loved it!! :)

YUMMY!! My family ate all of this chicken right up!! My 2 year old even asked for seconds!! I added a little parmasean cheese and garlic powder. I was generous with the sour cream.  Next time I would probably reduce the cooking time to 45 mins as little as my oven is fairly hot. Will definitely make again, no question!!:)

This chicken was not the best ever.  I thought it was pretty plain although I did like the thought of sour cream as a binding ingredient.  I will probably use sour cream instead of mayo in the Amazing Chicken recipe.

Excellent! Very moist, but next time I will add garlic and increase the amount of Italian spice from 1 tsp to 1 tbsp to give it more flavour. A very yummy way to do chicken.

Love the cornflake crust idea-I give it four stars because I couldn't really taste the sour cream coating-next time i will add teriyaki to the sour cream. Still, definitely great!

very good!
i used 1/2 cornflakes and 1/2 frosted flakes (1 tiny box each from those sample packs you get) added garlic salt, salt and pepper, and some bread crumbs to the crust mix.  my 3 year old helped me 'paint' the chicken with light sour cream with basting brushes!
I might add a little more garlic salt or regular salt next time, and i also left off the butter.

I crushed left over crackers (even the Kashi Ranch kind) and substituted some ranch dressing for some of the sour cream and even my picky preschoolers loved it!  Kashi crackers at least have good fiber!

This is very much like Shake and Bake, I didn't think it was anything special.  Just make sure to crush the cornflakes really well.  I don't think I crushed mine enough because some of it came out a little "hard".

Interesting flavor.  Hubby has categorized as a "KEEPER"  which means "the best"

I used a Key West grill seasoning packet in the Sourt Cream and this turned out wonderful and I used lite sour cream and drizzled the chicken with olive oil and it was a very low fat dish.

I adored this recipe. It is so quick, easy, and cheap. I used crushed club crackers instead of cornflakes because that is what I had, and as always used more butter than the recipe called for. Like most people I used less sour cream and more crumb topping.I also grated some romano cheese on top of it.

I made the recipe, and thought it was great, however, the amount of sour cream must be wrong.  I only use about 1/2 cup for 6 chicken breasts.

This turned out wonderfully. I did add some spices to it, onion powder, paprika and chili powder, but my husbad has been raving about it and already wants me to serve it again. I also ran low on the breading mixture before I had all of my chicken ready, so I crushed and added a half a cup of stuffing mix I had in the cupboard. It tasted great!

This was alright but doesn't even come close to another recipe from this site which is similar in its preparation. (famous butter chicken). I think i would have liked it better had i not had the other recipe first.  I also think i should have crushed the corn flakes alot finer.  Other than that it was edible but i think i was just expecting something more.

I really like this recipe. I make it all the time.  I think the butter gives it a very rich taste.  I add some season salt and it gives it a nice taste.  Good recipe!!

It was quick, easy (my 3yr old helped), and a wonderful change from the usual baked chicken breast.

I'll never use flour or bisquick for coating chicken again!  I was a little disapointed that it wasn't as crispy as I expected, but I used a cut-up fryer instead of breasts and left the skin on.  I only needed about one cup of sour cream.  Great Chicken!

I used precooked chicken and used Ritz
crackers and added slivered almonds.
My kids loved it.
