Iâ€™d make the dressing a little spicier with some Dijon mustard. It needs a kick of something.

Love this salad!  The fresh rosemary is really necessary to get that nice clean taste. I also made it without the onions and I thought it was just as good..

Although I have not made this dish I did give it 5 stars.  I grew up eating sliced oranges with olive oil and black pepper.  Loved it! Can't wait to try this version.
