I used ginger ale as the recipe submitter and I am giving this 5 stars due to how fun the drink was. It was a little sweet for my liking but this is one your kiddos will love. Some of the strawberry puree stays on the bottom while some floats to the top. Once you start drinking it the bottom layer starts making its way to the top creating a lava lamp effect. This was super cool. Be sure to serve it in a clear glass so that you don't miss out on the show.
