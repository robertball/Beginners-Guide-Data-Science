Made this for a family dinner get together, everyone loved it. Used chunks of 5 different cheeses instead of the shredded and cut some grape tomatoes up rather than a whole tomato(stuff I had on hand), the rest the same. Tripled the recipe. Very good :)

A really good pasta salad with a lovely fresh flavor to it, which we all enjoyed quite a bit. I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil, as well as diced grape tomatoes instead of one large tomato as they're both what I had on hand. I also shredded my own sharp cheddar instead of using pre-shredded as well, but it was still sharp cheddar so that's not a drastic difference. It was pretty easy to make and enjoyed by all, and I will definitely be making it again!

This was good.  Next time I may try it without the cheese, or with significantly less cheese, just based on my personal preference.  I used grape tomatoes in lieu of a tomato.  Thanks for sharing your recipe,ISLANDGIRLEJFAN!
