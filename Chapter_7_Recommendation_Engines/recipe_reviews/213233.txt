Really good, basic recipe.  It loses something without pickle (I recommend garlic pickle or mango pickle).  I added scallions and a touch of garlic to the original recipe.  Just keep adding water until the dough forms.    Fairly simple and with a mixer it goes quicker than the time listed.

I love this easy to follow recipe. I made a few changes to suit my needs., I used all purpose flour instead of wheat, I left out the spices since my mashed potatoes already had some seasoning in them, and then I added a tablespoon of sugar. Also I found they came out really pliable when I rolled them Thin, thin enough to see the board beneath them. I will definitely use this recipe again, maybe with tomatoe and basil.

I had to knead the dough way more than I had anticipated but it came out well. Loved it. The suggestion to serve with butter brushed on the chapati is classic. Thanks for this.
