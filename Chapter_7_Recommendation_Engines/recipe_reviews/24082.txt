Just like the Italian Restaurants in New York City.  I added 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, and 1 tablespoon dried basil for perfection.  My family begs for it all the time!!!

Oh dang... I just about ate this whole pot by myself.  Wonderful sauce!!  I did have to add about a tablespoon of sugar to counteract the tartness from the tomatoes, and like antoher reviewer added a bit of oregano, parsley and basil to set it just right.  Definitely worth the calories. Good Recipe.

I have been searching far and wide for a GREAT vodka sauce and this one is it!  Only thing is that I made a mistake when making it!  I only added ONE can of crushed tomatoes instead of two and it came out creamy and awesome!  I also added chopped pancetta or proscuitto when I was browning the onions - this one is a keeper!

Wow! Great sauce! I cut the recipe in half and sauteed three cloves of minced garlic along with the onion in the butter then added 1/4 tsp. of  crushed red pepper flakes along with the vodka. After adding the crushed tomatoes I added 1 Tbsp. of basil, 1/4 tsp. of oregano, 1 tsp. of parsley, 1/2 tsp. of salt and 2 tsp. of sugar. I  used a good vodka and light cream. I also added 1/2 cup of grated parmesan to make it extra creamy. We grilled some chorizo sausage and sliced that up over some penne pasta  - poured the sauce over top.  Great with a side of garlic bread!

Please resist the urge to customize. Except for perhaps reducing the amount of fat (butter) or adding salt (depending on the amount of sodium in your canned tomatoes), this recipe is all about the gloriously subtle richness of tomatoes, onion, vodka, and cream. While all those sauces with added herbs are surely lovely, they aren't this sauce in its purist form. Give it a try, and take pleasure in less being more.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made several times. I make a few small changes...  I saute onions and garlic in olive oil instead of butter and I also add salt,pepper, oregano, parsley, and basil after adding the crushed tomatoes, which give a wonderful flavor.  Last night I used this sauce over stuffed cabbage and it was delicious.

With the addition of about 1 1/2tsp of sea salt this is fantastic. I pureed about 2/3 of the sauce after cooking it. This helped thicken it up a little and smoothed out the flavors. After pureeing it I just added it back into the remainder of the chunky portion.

This sauce is to die for! It has a gorgeous color and texture--looks very fancy, but with minimum work! I added some garlic powder, rosemary, fresh basil, oregano, and sea salt along with the tomatoes. After I added the cream, I added sliced fresh mushrooms, and mussels, shrimp, and calamari rings, along with a touch of cayenne pepper to add just a hint of heat. Next time, I would use fresh garlic, and add it to the onions. I also would use a bit less butter, or substitute olive oil instead. I would also add either the mushrooms OR the seafood, but not both. Although this takes a bit of time, it really is quite easy, and well-worth it! I served it over angel-hair pasta with warm bread. This one is a keeper!

A wonderful change from a traditional sauce. This freezes very well. Now a standard in my home.

Very delicious, and stay true to its claim of being easy.  I added garlic, and put it in a blender for smoother consistency.

Super easy and so much tastier than the store-bought version, plus I had enough to use one portion and freeze two more. I used about 1/4 cup olive oil and a couple of TBSP butter. I also used a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk instead of a pint of heavy cream. Also lots of garlic (that's just me) and a couple of sprigs of fresh basil. This is a great basic recipe that can be altered to your own taste. I like to use San Marzano tomatoes as well. I only cooked it around 30 minutes total, but I think the initial 10 minutes after putting the vodka in is necessary to burn off the alcohol (don't get too close to the pot while the vodka's burning off LOL!) I served this over store-bought lobster ravioli, but could see using it in all different things by adjusting seasonings. Thanks for a keeper!

this is a great base recipe to built on and I  read  a lot of  the other reviews. I  took hints >>I cut it to half for 2 of us  and served it over lobster ravioli- it was delicous!!! I added a lot more spices> several cloves of garlic,more vodka,red pepper flakes, oregano,basil and  shallots-- I  also added about 1/2 cup grated fresh parmasan,  which gave it  a very ceamy texture-- it will become a favorite  for other pastas as well!

OK, can I give this a 15! I thought this was a delicious pasta sauce. I cut it in half and added a crushed garlic clove. I also added salt to taste. Thats it! I made it the night before because our plans had changed so I put it in a container until the following night. I gernerously seasoned boneless skinless chicken breast with sea salt, fresh ground pepper, fresh lemon juice and olive oil, and grilled it. I served it with penne pasta, sauce on top, and it was incredible. I think I might ad sundried tomates next time...not to many but I think that might be really good in there too..

A good basic recipe one can use to create an amazing sauce.  I followed the recipe amounts, but from there added minced garlic (added with the onion), oregano, basil and parsley (all herbs added with tomatoes).  I rated this recipe 3 stars because I did alter it so much.  It was well received by both adults and kiddos and was declared a 'keeper.'  Be mindful the recipe is for 10 servings, and will yield a large amount of sauce.  Thank you for the recipe!

This sauce is great and so simple. I make it without the onion because I don't like onions, and I usually use cans of crushed tomatoes with seasoning, and I use Svedka vodka, although I've never experimented with other vodkas because I never use it for anything besides this sauce. It's great with whole wheat penne and fresh grated parmesan (not the kind in the plastic tube though) or any other fresh quality cheese.

This was my first time making vodka sauce as well as eating it. It was so easy to make. I took advice of others and added fresh garlic and mushrooms as well as basil, parsley and oregano. My family and I fell in love with this sauce and can't believe we've never had it before. We served it over ravioli but can't wait to try it over other pastas. This is an excellent sauce!

LOVED IT!  this is one of my favorite meals and this recipe is so close to an Italian Restaurant in Howard Beach Queens, I added garlic when sauteeing the onions and crushed red pepper flakes at the end with a few dashes of grated parmesan to bring it closer to the restaurant taste I love. Delicious!

Pretty good stuff! I halved the recipe, but found if you think a halved version serves 5 you don't like food that much. I'd say it made two main dish type (hearty) servings. Since I like spicy, I added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red chili peppers and salt and pepper to taste. Otherwise, I made it to specs. It was good, fast and I will make it again. Thanks, Married!

Simple and tasty! Definitely a repeat - 2 changes we made because of what we had on hand: canned spaghetti sauce instead of crushed tomatoes, and used milk for half of the cream. My husband thought it tasted like a fancy restaurant!

This sauce is fabulous and so easy to make! As most other reviewers mentioned, I too, added spices and seasoning to make the flavor pop. I put 4 cloves of crushed garlic in with the butter and onions.  I added: salt, pepper, basil, parsley and honey. What I did differently was add a dash of nutmeg (just like an authentic Northern Italian sauce) and a dash of cinnamon. Make sure to only use a tiny amount or the spices will overpower! I used half heavy cream and half buttermilk. I will use this recipe over and over again!

This is a tasty quick vodka sauce,the name says it all! I did use crushed tomatoes that were seasoned with oregano, basil & garlic, only because that's all I had. The flavor was good, but next time I'm using the plain tomatoes as the recipe states because the herbs seemed to overpower the sauce a bit. Very nice, simple recipe, I needed a quick sauce recipe with few ingredients and this was wonderful. Thanks for sharing :)

This was great! I didnt have exact engredents on hand so I had to make some changes, I used garlic instead of onion and diced tomatoes instead of what was called for.  This came out so good, even the 4 year was happy!

Excellent!!  As reviews suggested I did add some basil, garlic and oregano.  The canned tomatoes also had all of these in them.  I had just gotten some "jarred" vodka sauce a few weeks ago and wasn't too sold on it.  But this is absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing such an easy, simple but great recipe. Addendum:  Made this again a couple of weeks ago for friends.  My friend's husband could not stop "grunting" as he ate this delicious dish.  DH and him ate almost half of the 13x9 dish that I made it in.  I use grey goose vodka and this time I added a little bit of browned hamburger.  Can not believe how GOOD this really is.

This was really good!  I simmered for about 30 mins longer while my pasta and garlic bread cooked and also added oregano, parsley and basil (at the end), also S&P.  I sauteed about 2 cloves of garlic with the butter in the very beginning but will probably use 3 or 4 cloves next time.  I'd love to try this with fresh ingredients!  We had some left over that we froze -- definitely looking forward to the leftovers!

This requires time to monitor but it is very easy. I made a half and followed the recipe. I tasted it before adding anything and while Vodka Sauce is supposed to be pretty basic, I wanted a bit more flavor and added a teaspoon of Italian blend of spice. I served this over Italian sausage ravioli and loved it!! Thank you!!

This was delicious!  It made a ton, easily enough for 1.5 to 2 pounds of pasta.  With the onions, I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic and with the vodka, I added 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper (we like things spicy).  With the tomatoes, I added 1 tbsp. of dried basil, 1/4 tsp. of oregano, 1 tsp. of dried parsley, 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Everything else was the same.  Served over rigatoni and topped with a little parmesan cheese - yummy!  EDIT:  I still make this and I like it better than any restaurant's vodka sauce!!

Delish! I also added about a tablespoon of minced garlic to the onion butter step. After adding the tomatoes I added 1 tablespoon of basil, 1 table spoon of oregano, and  1 teaspoon of parsley. After the heavy cream, I added 1/3 cup of mozzerella cheese, and 1 1/2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. I added sugar and salt to taste. It turned out wonderful, but I had lots of sauce left over. I hope to use it later this week! Thank you!

This recipe yields enough sauce for 2 lbs. of pasta, but it is easily halved.  The sauce is deliciously rich with butter, heavy cream and grated cheese. I soak a dried red pepperI overnight in the vodka, and cook it into the sauce for some extra bite which works nicely with all that dairy. I also use whole canned tomatoes, which I puree in the blender for a smooth, velvety sauce. I recommend adding  penne, cooked al dente, to the sauce to thoroughly coat before serving. Top with grated romano or parmesan, and chopped fresh basil or Italian parsley.  Also, it's great with ravioli!

Definitely easy but not quick. My mistake! I did add herbs like others suggested. Also found that it made quite a mess (splattering) so I had to cover skillet. I halved the recipe and the times were off. All in all i would make again, very tasty!

Nice base recipe but too bland for our taste.  We spruced it up by adding black pepper, salt, fresh basil, oregano and a healthy dose of chopped garlic.  Once we added these ingredients the sauce was perfect.  Will definitely make this again with our changes.

Fabulous! A cinch to put together - I was able to study and check on the sauce in intervals. I made the stated serving size amount and froze it in quart size zip lock bags for when we don't feel like cooking during the week. To my amazement it reheated with the same flavor and texture as the day I made it! Highly recommended. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very nice base which I add a couple of small items to give it more flavor and to take it over the edge. I use diced tomatoes and quickly blend them (not too much), saute 2 cloves of fresh garlic with the onion. Add 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp of ground pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, 1/4 cup of Parmesan to the blended tomato mix. bon appetit

I added about a 1/2 cup fresh basil and switched the canned tomatoes for fresh ones.  Also added a bunch of garlic in when I sauteed the onion, and don't forget to season! Any blend of Italian seasonings along with a little salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and this dish becomes unstoppable.  Some people like to add prosciutto or sausage but I prefer it meatless.  Pour it over cheese tortellini and you're set. To lighten it up you can just swap the heavy cream for a pint of plain, nonfat greek yogurt.  This is literally a masterpiece and people think I'm a professional chef when I make this!

I was looking for something other than just standard "tomato" sauce to serve with Chicken Parm and Eggplant Rollatina and this sauce was the perfect match.  I made some minor changes to the recipe for personal preference. I added 4 cloves of garlic - minced - when I sauteed the onion, but that's because we LOVE garlic!  I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half and it was fine.  To make the sauce a little chunkier I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of crushed tomatoes instead of 2 cans of crushed tomatoes.  This is my new "go to" sauce for all of my italian dishes.

This was a great base to start with, I did use diced tomatoes instead of crushed and used an immersion blender to blend up the tomatoes. I also had to let this simmer much longer than listed so it would thicken up. Overall very good sauce.

This was a good basic vodka sauce. I let the marinara simmer for about 3 hours, added the cream and let simmer for another 40 min. I added 3 cloves of garlic to the onion and butter. Tossed the sauce with grilled chicken, penne and peas. Yum! Hope it freezes well because I had half left over!

So easy but missing so much. Everyone has added something to the mix. First I made half as much. I added garlic with the onion, my crushed tomatoes was a 14oz can and  were garlic roasted and I added basil and oregano at the same time. I also used light cream and Parmesan cheese. As a base I thinks its a good sauce add some stuff its a great sauce. This came out creamy and a little pinker in color. This went awesome with the gnocchi I made for dinner!!

Came out really well with the changes that ppl recommended. I forgot the garlic but added only one can tomatoes, added dry basil, oregano and parsley, 1.5 teaspoons sugar. Next time I make it I will add a little less sugar and maybe half the heavy cream since it came out too watery and needed a much longer cooking down.

This didn't work for us even after doctoring it up.  Used fresh garlic, italian seasoning, seasoned salt, fresh gound black pepper, a couple pinches of white sugar, red pepper flakes and extra vodka, as my cans of tomatoes were larger than the recipe stated. Even after that, it had no flavor.  It was just flat.   In the end I wound up adding 2 jars of store bought vodka sauce to make it edible.

This is the best vodka sauce I ever made - and also the best vodka sauce I have ever had.  This recipe makes a nice size batch of sauce.  I was able to freeze half and use for another dinner a few weeks later.

Best vodka sauce I've ever had. Does need a little extra flavor - I add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic when you cook onion.   There's no need to cook for so long. I simmer for 20 mins after adding tomatoes, and another 20 mins after adding cream.   Season to taste w/ oregano and basil in the last few minutes of cooking.

This is a very nice sauce. I used about 3/4 olive oil to 1/4 butter mixture instead of just butter. Also,I sauteed about 4 finely minced cloves of garlic with the onions (after the onions started to get translucent). With the tomatoes was added a couple teaspoons each of dried basil and oregano and a handful of chopped fresh parsley. Seafood goes particularly well with this sauce, so on the side I sauteed 1 lb of shrimp and 1 lb of scallops in butter/olive oil and garlic. Added on top of the noodles, then covered with sauce...very addictive.

My grandmother, who's almost 95, said she can't live without this sauce.  I think that says it.

This is a wonderful sauce that is very well suited for ravoli.  I did add a tablespoon of dried parsley.  Also, watch the cooking time - this sauce can be done in less time than an hour.  Make sure you stir often or it will stick and burn.

Took other reviewers advice and made a few modifications.  Used combination of butter and olive oil, added minced garlic and 1 t Italian seasoning (Penzys).  One note - after initial onion/garlic and vodka cooking, I reduced heat to simmer - medium on my stove was much too hot.  Served over rotini pasta on a bed of wilted spinach.  Yum!  We loved this recipe and will use again and again.  Put the leftover sauce in the freezer for easy future dinners.

I have made his recipe a few times now and it's excellent. A very easy and flavorful dish that everyone loves. I follow the directions exactly and it turns out great everytime! However, I have been out of vodka before and have used white wine as a substitute and even once I used chicken stock instead. Still great. I sometimes add a touch of fresh basil at the end and/or use a crushed tomato variety that includes basil. You have to use heavy cream. Other dairy doesn't work. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!

Loved this! But I did tweak it a little bit. Great base recipe though! I cut the serving size in half and did 5 servings worth. I added about a 1/4 cup more vodka to the recipe, 1 tbsp dried basil, 1/4 tsp of dried oregano, 1 tsp of dried parsley, 1/2 tsp of salt and 2 tsp of sugar. The dried ingredient amounts for 5 servings I got from another user on here. Thanks Jilian! It was perfect! I also added about a 1/4 cup of grated parmasan cheese when I added the heavy cream. Helped thicken it a bit too. Try this too.. add prosciutto and minced garlic when your browning the onions and slice up some sun dried tomatoes and put them in when you add your heavy cream! Garlic and prosciutto idea I also got from another user. Thanks! It really helps being able to see other's feedback! This is definitely a keeper!

Easy to make and delicious.  I sauté pancetta with the onions.  Gives sauce a smooth and rich flavor.  In addition, I add sliced grilled chicken to go with the vodka rigatoni.   The whole family enjoys!

This was a great recipe.  I added a big pinch of Italian seasoning as well as garlic to the onions.  I also cubed some pancetta bacon, but think it isn't necessary nor does it add anything extra unless you want the meat.  I followed the rest exactly!  Everyone loved it, even my son and husband who usually don't order penne alla vodka when we are out. Make sure you have some fresh Italian bread for scooping up the extra sauce.  Yummy!

Well, I had a devil of a time with this one.  It was fine until I added the heavy cream.  Even though I was just barely simmering, my sauce broke and fat from the butter and cream leached out and looked very unappealing.  In an attempt to “fix” it, I made a  cornstarch/water slurry and kept adding it trying to bind up the fat.  It did finally work, but the sauce was a little thicker than I wanted.  Just before serving I reheated the sauce adding a little milk to thin it down a bit.  I served this over spicy sausage and meat raviolis.  After all that Hubs and I thought this was just ok, but nothing special.

We're getting ready to move, so I need to use up the stuff in the kitchen.  I found this recipe and I had all the ingredients except cream, so on that note it was perfect.  Following other reviews, I added oregano, salt, sugar, minced garlic, and thyme.  I think that sugar and salt are definitely crucial to the recipe, but probably could have left out the oregano and thyme.  Garlic is optional, based on your personal preference. 
The recipe is super creamy, and a bit on the heavy side.  Still, quite tasty and definitely an interesting take on pasta sauce.

Awesome recipe! Incredibly tasty and addicting! I did add chopped garlic with the onion and dried herbs (basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme) to the sauce. Salt and pepper are a must too! A pinch of sugar works well if your sauce comes out tasting a little bitter (it's because tomatoes are quite acidic). Enjoy!

Oh my gosh, I've been looking for a good recipe that will come close to the sauce from an A.M.A.Z.I.N.G local Italian restaurant's that was used with their Spinach Gnocchi. This was AWESOME and even better when sitting in the fridge for a while. 

I literally made enough for one bowl of gnocchi, HAHA (have a tendency to mess up recipes, LOL) because I didn't want to waste it if it didn't work out. I made it with the highest ranking ricotta gnocchi recipe on this site (silly me forgot the main ingredient though - ricotta. Haha. Now you understand why I made such a small portion of this recipe, LOL. Anywho, BRAVO and VERY DELICIOUS sauce !!

I make this all the time.  I use one can of crushed tomatoes or diced tomatoes and one can of sauce.  I use a shallot instead of the onion and I add the vodka last and allow to simmer while pasta cools.  We love this sauce.

Good Vodka Sauce.  I did use 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 1 jar of chunky spaghetti sauce to give it some added flavor.  Had to cook / reduce down much longer than recipe called for to get a hearty thick sauce in the end.  Will make again!

This was a really easy sauce. Just needed to add some salt and pepper. I didn't realize how much sauce I was making, so next time I will reduce the recipe by half.

My husband who has been begging for me to find a recipe like this LOVED IT!!!! It was so good even better the next day. Added a few more ingredients like other reviewers: sauteed garlic with the onion and added a teaspoon of sugar and salt and pepper to the sauce. Perfection!!!

This was fantastic. I made just as directed and my fiancee kept telling me how much he liked it even days later. I suppose seasonings would be nice in here but as written I really appreciated how rich the sauce was and the little pop the vodka added. The perfect fast homeade sauce, thanks so much for sharing.

fabulous recipe!  I halved the recipe and since I didn't have enough heavy cream used 1/2 heavy cream and half skim milk --- creamy and delicious.  Served my family of 4 and put a whole container in the freezer.  Looking forward to making it again.

This was incredible! As suggested by others I added 2 tsp of sugar, garlic, 1 Tbs basil, 1/4 tsp oregano, 1 tsp parsley, and 1/4 tsp salt. I also added fresh chunks of tomatoes and mushrooms.

The sauce alone is pretty good. We used tomatoes that were pre-spiced. However, we made it a second time and added italian sausage and that just put it over the top for us. Such a delicious, flavorful sauce.

This Vodka sauce was so good! It was a perfect companion with the gnocchi we cooked up. I'm sure it would be the perfect addition to any pasta.

I made the vodka sauce and follow the recipe to a T.  I added some seared scallops and sea bass on top of the pasta then pour the sauce on top of it.  It totally amazed my family and everyone rave about the dish for weeks afterward.  Will keep this recipe as one of my favorite.

I was a little skeptical of the sauce before it was fully simmered and the flavors were developed.  But after that, holy cow- AMAZING!!!  I did variations like the others:  added oregano, basil, parsley and garlic, sugar, salt, pepper.  Used olive oil rather than butter (and less).  Simmered for 45-hour after adding the cream.  Served with sirloin meatballs.  Amazing.

Great basic recipe!  I halved the recipe (and it still made plenty) and I added a few things.  First I added just a couple teaspoons of sugar to mellow out the tartness and I also added garlic, dried basil and salt.  I gave it 4 stars only because I don't think it would have been as good without the extras but definitely try this recipe!  Also, I didn't cook it for as long as it states because even on low, it reduced down too much for my liking and I added a little more cream (light cream) at the end to regain the creaminess.

This was great.  I added 3 cloves of garlic to the onions, as well as a bit of italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.  Served over gnocchi with a few garlic shrimp on the side. yum!  It made a lot and there are only two of us, so I ended up freezing a lot.

follow-up:  because there is only two of us, and we had so much leftover, I wish I would have frozen the leftover in a few smaller containers rather than one large one to make it easier to take out a meal at a time.  I ended up with one large frozen chunk in one container!  The good news?  It freezes well!!

Amazing!!!  A beautiful sauce from start to finish.  Love the process... totally worth the time!!!  I did use only one can of the crushed tomatoes and a little less butter, cream and vodka.  I also added minced garlic, dried parsley and basil as well as sugar and salt to taste.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!!!!!

I would have never believed that adding vodka to a pasta sauce could have tasted so good, but it does! As others have noted it's a little bland as written, so I added oregano, basil and garlic powder and it was to die for! Five stars and highly recommended!

Excellent recipe! I followed as written with the exception of adding garlic & seasoning to taste (salt, pepper, dried basil). You don't have to use all the heavy cream called for - add slowly until you get to your desired creaminess. I don't like my vodka sauce to look like alfredo so I probably added 1/2 to 3/4 the recommended amount of cream.

This was quite tasty. I followed other reviewers advice and added garlic, oregano and basil, along with fresh cracked pepper and salt. I simmered in the crockpot with chicken breast and served over pasta. Everyone enjoyed.

This is great! I did add some herbs and a few teaspoons sugar for some added flavor, but I am absolutely making this again! Better than any vodka sauce you can buy in a store; and five servings was just enough to throughly coat a box of penne. YUM YUM!

This was really good. I put fresh garlic in with the tomatoes, a little sugar and italian herbs in also. I like spice with mine though so i put in fresh not dried crush red pepper. Victorias is a good brand i found. I even put it over whole weat pasta and it was still delicious

I just wanted to say that this easy sauce is quite delicious - no changes need to be made to the original recipe either.  My 94 year old Mom absolutely has to have a supply of this sauce in her house. If she runs out of it, my niece (who lives with her) has to make another batch.  It's that good.

Very Good.  I served it with Penne and baked chicken breast.  I used Italian Style cushed tomatoes as other reviewers stated thay added italian spices and I wanted to save time.  I also added fresh minced garlic and a little grated parmesan cheese.  I will be making this again maybe with italian sausage next time.

This was wonderful, and so easy.  A few tips:  I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the onion.  I added 1tbls Italian Seasoning, 1/2tsp crushed red pepper, 1tsp dried basil and 1/2tsp salt to the tomato.  I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream.  Also, don't use a skillet to avoid the mess.  I used a dutch oven with splatter screen and it was perfect.

Never reviewed anything on here but HAD to review this one... absolutely delish! if you've ever been to a certain Italian restaurant in Hoboken nj on Washington street, this tastes JUST like their sauce..I followed the recipe exactly. Only minor complaint is that I had to stir the ENTIRE time or else sauce went flying!

Great one! Tried so many too! I dont like a chunky sauce, so I'll substitute crushed for sauce. I also use shallots instead of onions (gives delicate taste) and sometimes - dont ask how - but the sauce can be too thin for preference. So i combine penne with the sauce when both are complete and simmer together. The starch from penne makes the sauce creamier and adheres to the pasta better! And nothing is complete without some handfuls of grated cheese! Perfect.

I love this recipe and use it often. The only change I make to it is I add a pck or two of Sweet n Low, or any type of sweetner, to cut down on the acidic taste of the tomatoes. I does not take away from the sauce at all, just enhances it.
I like to take very thin chicken breats and dredge them in beaten eggs and grated parmesan cheese, and then cook them slowly in olive oil. I serve this over Angel Hair pasta with the vodka sauce. I have many people request that I cook this for them if they are coming to my home for dinner. This recipe will always be at the front of my cookbook.

VERY good.  Added crushed red peppers to give it a kick.  Also added Italian herbs.  Served with penne, shrimp and asparagus.  Rave reviews from friends.

This was really easy and really delicious!  I followed the recipe as described, except I took another reviewer's suggestion and added some diced pancetta to the saute'ing butter, onions and garlic, just to add some more texture to the sauce.  I will definitely make this simple, tasty sauce for my family again.

I made this last night with a few suggested modifications and it was wonderful.  I added a little minced garlic, basil and salt.  I also pureed half of the tomato mixture to make it creamier.  My family loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This sauce is excellent and very easy to make!  One warning...be sure that all the alcohol has cooked off...we all could feel it after dinner.  I did, as other reviewers suggested, add garlic, pancetta, and other spices.  This is a keeper in our house, but I will be sure to cook the vodka a bit longer next time.

Excellent!  I've made this several times and forgot to rate it (oops). I added clams once and mushrooms several times and that's good, but I usually just make the plain simple version and my family thinks I've fussed!

Great flavor for a simple sauce...followed others suggestions, adding oregano, basil, parsley and a tbsp of sugar.  Makes about 2 1/2 mason jars of sauce.

Well easy to make...do not need so much butter...puree tomatoes works good too...use olive oil in place of butter...1/4 stick of butter only...great with 1/4 pound of ham and lots of garlic...

This makes a HUGE amount of sauce - enuogh to toss with a whole 16 oz box of pasta and then some.  Next time I will split it into two or three servings and freeze the rest because it took awhile to make.  Definately not a quick work night dinner - better for a weekend dinner with wine and crusty italian bread.

complicated sauces.  I had raves from family and friends and had to share

I also took the advice of other reviewers and
used 2 cloves of minced garlic, 2tsp sugar, and
fresh chopped basil. I also by mistake bought
only 1/2 pint of cream, and it was just fine.
At the end I sprinked on some fresh chopped
parsley over the raviolis and sauce.

While this recipe is easy, it's not outstanding. Anyone who uses this MUST use fresh garlic! Also, a half cup of butter is excessive. However, I made a baked ziti subbing this sauce for regular marinara. It was good for that but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much over penne or another pasta. I'll try another recipe for that purpose - but this is a good one to use for ziti.

Not the best sauce recipe in the world - these types of cream sauces can be tricky to make.  I may try it again with some more spices and instead of using canned crushed tomatoes use fresh jarred tomatoes (My in-laws are Italian, I am lucky I get fresh jars of tomatoes!!) Wouldn't recommend again without a little tweaking!

I was skeptical about this but it turned out fine.  I think next time I might add 1 cup red wine instead of vodka, for flavor. Also, this sauce definately needs Italian spices and a bit of garlic.  Use a high quality canned tomato for the best results!

Found this recipe over the summer to accompany my first attempt at lobster ravioli.  THIS WAS TO DIE FOR!  It's sooo easy and tastes like the sauce found at gourmet Italian restaurants.

Note:  don't "sniff" the sauce until AFTER the vodka cooks away...I almost passed out over the stove!! :)

this dish was a hit with my husband and friends.  I turned it into a meat sauce by adding cooked ground beef and Italian sausage after the sauce was finished. I'll definitely make it again with or without meat.

I cut the recipe in half as there were only two of us and accidentally used a 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes with seasoning instead of crushed tomatoes. The result was awesome! I don't know how it would've tasted if I followed the recipe exactly but it was really yummy and half the !

I made this as written and it turned out pretty bland. I ended up adding garlic and italian seasoning to make it taste better, but it was also very watery. Probably wouldn't make this again.

LOVE this recipe. so easy to make. I tweak it to make it a bit more calorie friendly. I use a tbl of olive oil instead of butter. I add a shallot, red onion, fresh rosemary and dried sage as well as minced garlic to the olive oil. I also add whatever 'marinara' sauce I happen to have on hand plus organic diced tomatoes. I add fat free half and half instead of the cream. Always delicious! A keeper.

I've made this three times now - once for a family holiday dinner with some picky eaters (served pasta with choice of red vodka sauce or pesto) - and the overwhelming favorite was this sauce. This sauce is very easy to put together with a crowd around. At that dinner we had "add ons" of chicken breast strips and feta cheese, both of which were popular.

OMG! This may be the best sauce I've ever made! I've never written a review for any of the recipes that I've added to my box, but I wanted people to know how great & easy this is. The only things I added based on my family's preferences were a little sea salt, garlic & basil. After it cooked, I poured it in the blender & pureed it. All I can say is wow. Even my picky son said, "Mom, I don't think I can ever go back to your regular tomato sauce." At the end of the meal, we were all cleaning out the bowl with bites of bread! Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

This was the first time I have ever tried or made vodka sauce. It was really, really good! Did use half and half because that is what I had on hand. Did add garlic with onions because we love garlic on just about everything. Next time I will use heavy cream to see if we like it any better. But did work with half n half. Thanks

This recipe is delicious! The only thing I did differently is saute the onions AND tomatoes together in the pan first, then puree the cooked mixture in a blender to make it smooth.  I like a very smooth sauce, so I wanted to make sure there weren't any chunks in it.  THEN I transferred the hot mix back to a sauce pan to add the vodka and the cream.  The kind of vodka you use does make a difference! Splurge and buy a really good vodka! Not saying you have to buy Grey Goose, but DO NOT buy stuff like Nikolai, Vlad, or Bankers Club for this recipe or it will turn out awful!!! (Personal preference)

Extremely rich sauce but totally worth the time put into it.  Just like the other commetators, I added basil, fresh parsley and oregano into the mix and even through in some mushrooms and garlic.  

Excellente!

This sauce is delicious!!  I tried to make it true to the recipe, however, I used olive oil instead of butter, half & half, kettle one vodka(they say to only cook with liquor/wine you would drink) and most importantly Marzano tomatoes...they truly make a difference..they are the best you can buy and worth it.  I grow an herb garden so I did add a little fresh oregano & fresh basil, kosher salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and literally a pinch of sugar, probably didn't need it since I used marzano's.  I browned some ground venison which I put in it, and some grated parm and romano cheeses; then tossed w/ rigatoni, put in a 9x13, topped with shredded cheese and baked until melted...they love it that way...but the sauce is soooo good it would be good on anything, in fact, i'm going to put some WITHOUT venison on my salmon(of course i put some aside for me).  It's sooo quick to make and will absolutely make again.  I must note...you must let the vodka cook for 10 minutes...I did not taste any strong vodka taste at all...only pure deliciousness..i would think that the cheaper the vodka, the stronger the vodka taste.  And i read that many of you added fresh garlic, i like garlic, but the onion was perfect...I didn't feel it missed garlic, but ,maybe next time i will try it.  I agree...simple is best...too much customizing ruins the sauce it's meant to be...Bon Appetit!!  Gigity, Wixom, Michigan

Very yummy sauce. While I can appreciate that vodka sauce is very simple I did have to add some things to this to give it a touch more flavour. I added some garlic to the onions and added some spices while it was simmering. First time I made this I added ground sausage to the sauce and it was delicious. I also used diced tomatoes as that's all I had and just used my potato masher to smooth it out abit. It's simmering on my stove as I type this and this time I stayed closer to the recipe. I'm sure it'll be as good as the last time. Very good base for a sauce and adjustable to your liking. Just what I look for in a recipe.

Sooo good. Added fresh oregano, basil and parsley as others had suggested.  Also some salt and sugar. Gave it 4 stars because of the "alterations".  Amazing - can't wait to make it again!!

This sauce is a great base! I made it half sized and really like it! However, i am a bit of a flavor fiend, so i spiced it up a lot.  Added some oregano, some parsley, some crushed red peppers, 3 cloves of garlic, some salt, and cracked black pepper.  I also added in italian sausage (out of the casing) as I was sautéing the onions.  Came out great! Thanks!

This sauce was very good.  I did however add 1/4 tsp. of oregano, 1 T. dried parsley (didn't have fresh on hand), 1/8 tsp. of basil (the crushed tomatoes I used already had basil in) and 1 tsp. of sugar.  I will definitely make this again and next time I will try adding some diced pancetta in with the onions.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very good! I halved it and made a few adjustments, using ingredients I had on hand. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and used 2 14 oz cans of whole tomatoes (that I crushed/cut up with scissors in the pan while the sauce cooked) instead of crushed tomatoes. I also added dried basil, parsley, and oregano, as other reviewers suggested. Yum! The sauce was perfect over some 7-cheese tortellini.

It was hard to waiting for this sauce to be done cooking because it smelled so delicious! And once it was done, tasted even better. The only change I made was adding some basil and oregano. I'll be making this again!

Good. But make sure to boil out the Vodka - otherwise it tastes too much like alcohol. Maybe use less Vodka, half to three-quarters of a cup instead of a full cup?

When I made it, my kitchen smelled like Vodka. I added 2 extra tablespoons of butter to the sauce also. It was really Vodka-heavy.

This was a great vodka sauce recipe.  Even better the next day.  

I didn't add as much cream as it called for, because we don't care for our vodka sauce super creamy.  Otherwise, a very delicious recipe.  I will make this again.  And maybe some shrimp and crushed red pepper for a little more zing.

As someone stated this is a good base but does require additional seasoning.  I took the advice of some of the reviews and added 1 tbsp dried parsley, red 1/2 tsp redpepper flakes, 1 tbsp salt and 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic.  Pretty tasty!

Excellent sauce. Modifications: used butter and olive oil mixed. Browned 1/2 piece bacon in butter/oil mix with shallots and 2cloves garlic. Added some basil,oregano and thyme. Excellent with Sam Mariano tomatoes. Rich, but not heavy.

Was super with White fish Ravioli for Feast of the Seven Fishes!  Much easier to make than the traditional Italian Red  and didn"t overpower the mild ravioli stuffing!  The enitre family (30+) loved it!

I made this once and it was excellent!  The second time I added minced garlic and a bit of salt.  It really is easy to make and it's great over spaghetti for a very tasty meal.

Delicious! Super easy and taste is great. I added some sun-dried tomatoes while cooking the onions and a few shakes of red pepper flakes before adding the cream. I like sauces that are a little spicy. This is a keeper. Will serve to company.

The sauce was good but not quite what I was looking for. It was a rich but mild sauce and would no doubt be better if spiced up a bit.

Made as written but added 3 cloves of garlic (minced) with the onions.  DELISH!!!!  Makes plenty for a whole box of pasta PLUS leftovers!  We'll be making this again...and AGAIN!

Cut the recipe in half and sauteed three cloves of minced garlic along with the onion in butter or olive oil  then added 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes along with the vodka. After adding the crushed tomatoes I added 1 Tbsp. of basil, 1/4 tsp. of oregano, 1 tsp. of parsley, 1/2 tsp. of salt and 2 tsp. of sugar. Great with a side of garlic bread!

This was excellent.  I didn't have 28 oz of crushed tomatoes so I used 14.5 can diced tomatoes and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Delicious - served on lobster ravioli.

I cannot locate the jarred stuff since we moved overseas so I was really excited to find this recipe. I do have to say it was a bit bland. I will likely keep looking for another recipe for vodka sauce. There was too much butter for sure.

I just made this last night and it was delicious!  Now here are the changes I made: Added chopped onion and garlic to the butter to saute, then added italian seasoning, honey (to counteract the acid in the tomatoes), parmesan/romano cheese and some shrimp.  My DIL was thrilled with it and asked me to please make 5 lbs of it next time!  LOL  I was a little concerned about the proportions at first but they are perfect.  I forgot to say that I also add a few pinches of baking soda to cut the acid. (Baking soda is a base and base + acid = neutral for those that didn't take chemistry)

Always delicious! I've made this close to a dozen times over the last few years. You can't go wrong. It makes a lot of sauce so I usually halve the recipe and it turns out great. I also add fresh crushed garlic when sauteing the onion then dried oregano and crushed red pepper after adding the cans of crushed tomatoes.

This one is a keeper. Everyone in my house loved it, from my 11 year old to my 80 year old Mom-in law. Added a little minced garlic and some Italian seasoning to the onion. I used half and half in place of the heavy cream to cut the fat down some, it turned out great.

This was really good.  I made it slightly healthier by using smart butter, and I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  I also used 2 can of tomato sauce instead of crushed tomatoes.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic, oregano, red pepper, and mozzarella cheese. It was delicious.

This recipe exceeds five stars - it has been my standard pasta sauce for a few years, and it is pretty much fail-proof. It doesn't take long to make - I think chopping the onions is the most time consuming part of the entire recipe, other than just waiting for it to simmer properly. Do make sure your onions begin to carmelize, that adds a nice sweetness that can counteract any tomato tartness. Otherwise, you may want to add a tablespoon or two of sugar. I usually add a capful or two of Mrs. Dash's garlic blend to add some nice flavor, and on occasion a table spoon of crushed red pepper flakes to give it some bite. I use the stick blender right in the pot to make it perfectly smooth just before I add the cream. The result is a gorgeous, velvety sauce that freezes beautifully. I've used it for every kind of pasta under the sun, and most especially for baking manicotti. This recipe is sublime - without a doubt my favorite recipe from Allrecipes in the over ten years I've been visiting this site.

I just made this for the second time tonight.  Man, is it ever good.    I don't know what "authentic" vodka sauce really is, but I do love garlic and oregano and basil, and even rosemary, so I added these things.  Didn't measure, sorry, just kinda to taste.  Also added a touch of kosher salt, as a few others have said.  Like I said, don't know if it's the way vodka sauce is supposed to be, but dang, it was tasty!

This is a wonderful, "base" recipe for vodka sauce.  But where are the herbs/seasonings?  Just using crushed tomatoes will give you a pretty bland flavor.  Instead, I use a batch of my homemade tomato sauce, which includes a little garlic, fresh basil and oregano.  If you do use the canned tomatoes as indicated in this recipe, do yourself a favor and add some herbs in there.  The end result is FANTASTIC!  Tastes just like restaurant vodka sauce.  A very impressive dish for company or special occasions.

This sauce was delicious!  I made it for our Grandparent's Day dinner and everyone loved it.  I did make one change though, after it had cooked and I tasted it, I thought it was pretty bitter, so I added 1/2-3/4 cup of sugar to take some of the acidity away.  It was really, really good!

I can't believe how much flavor this has. I attempted to make a pink sauce before, but the vodka really pumps up the flavor. I cut down on the time in each section because I was in a rush, and it still came out great.

This was a very simple recipe that turned out great for a quick meal on a work night.Along with the onions I added some finely chopped garlic and browned it in the butter, I also added a touch of garlic powder and a pinch of sugar to the sauce as it cooked during the last 30 minutes. You can definately eat this sauce alone or over some penne noodles or do as I did and add some grilled chicken with it which was great....This is another keeper.

I made this last night to go with fish. Added my own fresh herbs and it turned out amazing.  Thank you for a great, easy recipe. I'll definately be making this again.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is super easy to prepare, it is delicious and only takes a couple simple ingredients.  I have made it twice for big parties and it goes far.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very Very good.  This was my first time making a vodka sauce and it was delicious.  I served it with premade ravioli.  The recipe made a lot of sauce so I froze the rest and plan to use it in a baked dish with Italian sausage.  Thanks!

Very good sauce.  I did add some fresh garlic to the pan when I was doing the onions.  I think with out that it would have been to bland.

I made a half batch without any changes.  It was so simple and so good.  I wouldn't add any spices, we didn't even season with salt/pepper.  I think the key it so let everything cook for as long as it is written.  That just makes it sweet.

OMG.. This was good and very easy to make. I also added 1 Tbsp. of Sugar,Oregano,Fresh Parsley & minced fresh garlic. My family loved it. I also used Absolut vodka.I was afraid of using any cheap Vodka. My local liquour store said it was better then Smirnoff.(OK it was more expensive). I also grilled some shrimp to go w/ our Penne Pasta.

I am a virgin vodka sauce maker, and this turned out delish!  I admit I had to change one thing, I forgot to pick up the cream so I improvised by spraying in some whip cream.  It added a nice sweetness and came out very creamy.

This has become one of the most requested meals from my fiance. It is so simple and delicious we can't stop eating it! Like a few others have suggested, let it cook for the full time it says. It really makes a difference in the flavors.

This sauce was great- even better than some I've bought at the gourmet grocery store. Just be sure to start it an hour ahead. I also added Italian seasoning and oregano as some other reviewers suggested. Delicious!

A+ Can be easily customized. I substituted olive oil for butter and used the sauce in a spaghetti lasagna casserole. I agree that a little sugar is needed to counteract the tart tomato. Grind the onions for finicky kids and 1/2 tomato sauce 1/2 diced makes a more popular texture.

This was a good sauce but not as good as I was hoping.  Might use it again but will continue searching for one that is closer to tasting like the one my family loves.  The sauce was easy to make and did taste good though!

This recipe is excellent and super easy.  Of course, the addition of garlic, basil and parsley are great and add a touch of color.  I also added a package of frozen peas for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Everyone loved it!

Very good and easy sauce.

I think next time I will add a litte garlic with the onion and maybe some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little more.

This is great! I gave it 4 stars because I made some changes, without which I think this sauce might've been a little boring. I added 3 or 4 cloves of chopped garlic with the onion, and I also added about 2 tsp. of Penzey's Pizza Seasoning, which gave it great flavor. I was able to freeze almost 1/2 of this, and I can't wait to eat it again! This one's a keeper!!

I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and added Italian spices, which kicked up the flavor; I also cut down on the butter.  You only need enough to keep the onions from burning, since you're putting in cream later.  It turned out to be a good, basic sauce.

I love this sauce. I already made it several times and here are my changes that make the sauce perfect. I add pachetta with the onion and brown it before adding the tomatoes. I also add Italian seasoning with tomoatoes and fresh basil after the sauce is done cooking. DELISH!

Amazing, really.  My boyfriend and I tried different sauce recipes last weekend.  This Vodka one was by far the best.  It was the first time we ever looked forward to our leftovers!!!  We are now keeping a ready stock of this in our freezer.

I originally had a different recipe for this, however was missing an ingredient so I tried this one.  Now this is the only one I make. And there is not meat so a few of my "vegetarian" friends can try it as well.
Delicious!

My family absolutely loved it, and were eating it even after there were no noodles left for it. Great sauce! GREAT!

The name says it all - easy.  Flavorful but not overpowering at all.  Best vodka sauce I have ever had.  We added sliced proscuitto the last 5 minutes before serving over penne.  We have given this recipe to everyone and it is now one of our favorites.

This was very easy to make and tasted great!  I did add some seasoning such as oregano, basil, parsley, and salt and pepper.  I also sauteed some minced garlic along with the onions.  Adding the seasonings definitely gives the sauce more flavor.

It really is a quite simple recipe. However, I found some simple ways to jazz it up. First, I use about 3 cloves of fresh garlic. I also use fresh basil. The most important part is that I use fresh tomatoes rather than canned. And to replace the liquid from the can, I use jarred tomatoe sauce. 
Even though this is such a simple recipe, it can really seem like an extravagent meal to entertain company. It has always been a crowd pleaser.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I did make a few changes, I combine a R. Ray recipe and this one. I added three cloves of garlic to the onion , 1 can of tomato sauce, 1 can of crushed tomatos and fresh basil at the end. My friends mopped the their plates with bread. Yum

This sauce was good, but not quite what I was looking for.  My boyfriend loved it, though, and said it was the best he's had.  I guess it's just preference.  I did use shallots instead of onion, and added garlic and some oregano, which I think added some flavor.

OH MY GOSH!!  This was WONDERFUL!  I followed other suggestions and added garlic and fresh herbs (basil, parsley, oregano) and served it over fresh artichoke ravioli topped with fresh grated parmesan.  I served it to my vegetarian friends and they raved over it!

This was excellent and very easy.  I cut the recipe in half and also added italian seasonings and garlic as well as veal.  It was the best sauce I have ever made, kept eating way after full!

Very easy ... good basic sauce.  Had more of a generic spaghetti sauce flavor/texture to it rather than a true vodka sauce but pretty good nonetheless.  I had to use light cream rather than heavy, which probably accounts for some of the taste difference.  Makes a TON!  I altered it slightly by adding garlic, using olive oil instead of butter to saute the onions, adding 6oz proscuitto (needed much more ~ disappeared in the sauce), and adding oregano (couldn't get my hands on any fresh basil). I served it over rigatoni.  I wish I would have used canned roma tomatoes & chopped them, instead of the crushed tomatoes.

this vodka sauce is exceptionally easy and absolutely delicious. You can add salmon or sauteed chicken and both are wonderful with bowtie pasta, a nice salad and french bread and of course your favorite red wine.

This recipe is great. It's really easy, although it does take quite awhile to cook. I used a little less butter, and I added red pepper flakes to make it spicy. My roommate is volunteering me to make it for our friends. Very yummy!

I agree with the reviewer who said resist the urge to add herbs, etc. This is great sauce just as it is. If you add a lot of herbs, spices and cheeses, it becomes a tomato sauce with vodka in it. The only adjustment I make is to sauté  the onion in just a few tablespoons of butter, then add the rest of the butter after the onions start to turn. If you start out with a whole half cup of butter, you kind of get onion butter soup. I like my onions more carmelized.

Wow. Just wow. I was expecting it to be blah, or just okay. I've purchased Vodka sauce in the past/ ate it in restaurants and for the past 10 years no one and I mean NO ONE had reached my level of satisfaction! Well until yesterday, I love this Vodka sauce recipe, it was brilliant and easy. I wanted to drink it, it was that tasty! I used Tito's vodka and you couldn't tell it was titos, I followed this recipe through out. Except, I lowered the temperature to a simmer once adding the tomatoes. Then increased it to medium when adding the Heavy cream 30 minutes later, then reduced it again. It was fabulous! I can't wait to make it again. It was so good that, I ate it for lunch and dinner the next day!!! I recommend this recipe!

First time making it, and I think 2nd time eating it in my life. I followed recipe. I only had whole peeled tomatoes so I purée them up. I cut recipe in half because it was only 2 adults eating it and even half the recipe was a lot. I felt it needed salt. Even with salt from butter and tomatoe can it was bland. My husband always says follow recipe first before you add stuff to it the second time so I didn’t add salt. It to me was a good base and needed maybe salt, garlic, and or some Italian seasonings. Otherwise delicious. It was thin Also so maybe some tomato paste to thicken up a little. I will make again and tweak it.

I made this recipe although I added more vodka than the recipe called for because I couldn't taste the vodka.  With that said, I also added a little bit of parmesan cheese and I cooked it about a half hour less than suggested (Hubby and I were starving!).  We both really loved this sauce and one week later I'm back to make it again!  This time I'll cook it for the recommended time but will keep my other adjustments.  If you like vodka sauce, definitely try this recipe! It's delicious!!

So simple and delicious!  I added fresh basil I had on hand, dried oregano, a pinch of sugar and a Parmesan rind I had frozen. And no one else said they added salt and pepper but I did. Will definitely do it again!

To quote my 19 year old daughter, "freakin' incredible." The only addition to the recipe was adding a bit of minced garlic  for 30 seconds before adding the onions to the  butter.
I served it with parmesan on the side so people could add it  if they wanted.

I have made this twice now. Once following the recipe exactly which was great so I made it again.  The second I diced a couple carrots and celery stalks and cooked them with the onions. I used a submersion blender and blended the onions , carrots and celery down.  Then I added the vodka.
I had a couple of whole lobsters.  I cleaned the meat out and set aside.  I added the tomatoes and the lobster shells to give the lobster flavor to the sauce.  After the 20 minutes I  strained out the shells and returned the sauce to the pan.  
I added the cream.  Then after 15 minutes I added the lobster meat.   Cooked the final 15 minutes.

My 11 yr old made this on her own and it was ABSOLUTELY amazing.  She did add some oregano and basil, but as far as I know that is the only change from the written recipe that she did.

This is amazing. This is vodka sauce at its best. Do not add garlic or basil or whatever your whim desires. It does not need sugar or anything else. This recipe is perfecto, as is. Whoever said this is a bland sauce, forgot to put the vodka in. :)

Easy and delicious. My little boy requests this 1-2 times per week now. If I don’t have crushed/diced tomatoes, I’ve used any jar of spaghetti sauce and/or tomato sauce to equal portion in the recipe. I mix in sautéed chicken chunks and mushrooms at the end and serve over pasta.it’s to die for. Every time.

Excellent!  I took others advice and sautéed 3 cloves of garlic with the butter and onion.  When I added the crushed tomatoes I also added 1 T of Basil, Oregano and Parsley.  Also added probably about 1 T of sugar.  I also used half and half which created a plenty rich.  It was so great and rewarms really well!

Easy and delish!
I didn't have any plain vodka, so I had to use cranberry vodka.   It turned out just fine, but I never think it tastes like vodka.  I usually make it without vodka and you would never know!  I did add salt to recipe and shrimp that was pan sauteed in a touch of olive oil.

This was pretty easy and very yummy. Even the picky teenage eater in the house had a big bowl (his didn't include the yummy veggies the adults had). I did make a few minor additions to the purist recipe. I added 4 crushed and minced cloves of garlic for the last minute or 2 of onion saute, then added a bit of basil, oregano, black pepper, red chili flakes. I also added a little under a tablespoon of sugar in the raw with the Centos brand crushed tomatoes. I used mostly a vegetarian brand of half and half because it was in the fridge but still used about 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream because I'm not vegetarian and there wasn't a whole pint of the other stuff. I served it with sauteed mushrooms, tossed with cooked rotini pasta, baby spinach, and sliced grape tomatoes. Topped it with shaved parm and served with garlic bread, yummy! The recipe made enough sauce for me to bag and freeze half for another meal.

This is a very simple & delicious recipe. You can add to it or just make it as is.  I did add some garlic cloves to the butter.  I am a Vegetarian  so I made this with penne pasta.  I also added a lot of grated Romano & parmesan cheese.  YUMMY!!!

This was a really good vodka sauce recipe.  I made some adjustments like adding parmesan cheese, pepper flakes, garlic and parsley, and I substituted half and half for the heavy cream. I also added a little baking soda rather than sugar to the sauce to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  It was still a really tasty sauce overall and the substitution of a lighter cream didn't affect the taste, just made it lighter.  My family loved it.  I will totally use this recipe again.

I added a teaspoon of salt - then it was terrific. Put chicken and peas in it and served over spaghetti, but I think it might have stood on its own as a vegetarian meal.

I literally NEVER review recipes, but this one was so good that I had to! Listened to other reviewers and added a bit of sugar and some other herbs, and it came out to be the best homemade sauce i have ever made! My family is not a fan of onions, so I skipped that part of the recipe ( I also made a half batch) and it was still better than I could've hoped! Try this, you won't regret it!

I had a half can of diced tomatoes leftover, and this worked perfectly. I ran them through my mini processor (next time I'll use the crushed tomatoes). Since it was just for myself, I scaled it down to 2 servings. I followed Jillian's recommendations (just eyeballed amounts), adding  a few cubes of the frozen garlic to the onions, as well as crushed red pepper, dried basil, oregano, parsley, salt and sugar to the tomatoes. In place of the cream I used 2% milk. I also did not cook as long as the recipe states. Had with angel hair pasta. Excellent, restaurant-quality sauce! Thanks for the recipe!

Added garlic to sauté. Added chanterelles dried mushrooms and pork tenderloin. Added 2 tablespoons sugar. Used one can crushed tomatoes and one can of Italian diced tomatoes. Would be delicious as a marinara sauce without cream. Used half n half instead of heavy cream. This was a delicious vodka sauce!

I made the recipe as stated, only substituting diced tomatoes as I didn't have crushed. I used a potato masher on them after they cooked for 30 minutes for the desired effect.  My family LOVED the recipe. I LOVED that  it reheated even BETTER the next day and the day after!  The sauce was creamy, delicious, and easy.  I'll definitely make this for family parties -- especially since I can make it ahead of time.

I made no substitutions, however I cut the recipe in half (very easy to do that).  I cut the simmering times by almost in half, too, yet the flavor and consistency were great. This easy vodka sauce is now in my favoritesl.

First time around I had one large and one small can of crushed tomatoes, used them. I had no heavy cream so I tossed in one whole package of Boursin garlic and herbs cheese. Mmmmm! Oh and my fiancé does not like onions, so replaced with thinly sliced fresh garlic! Tonight I'm going to add in crumbled Italian sausage and chopped spinach!!!

Definitely one of my family’s favorites! It is very bland so u have to spice it up. I did add more seasoning and also used about 3 cloves of diced garlic with the onions.  Red pepper flakes,salt, and  Italian seasoning  are  also a great addition. This recipe makes A LOT of sauce. You can 1/2 this recipe and still have left overs for a family of 4.

This is tremendous. Cooking off the vodka is as much fun as I’ve had over a stove in a while. The fuel coming off the pan was something to behold. Next time I’ll make this in pure form, as the touch of oregano and red pepper flakes I added were superfluous. Just make this as it is. I  also don’t understand why anyone would ruin the beautiful texture of the crushed tomatoes and long simmered cream by puréeing this. The melding of the butter, tomatoes, vodka and cream is almost alchemy. This, over the homemade penne my machine cranked out tonight...wow.

So this is a seemingly easy dish. However it's rather time consuming to make. Not all that big of a deal but there is something missing. Im not entirely sure what it is. Maybe oregano or parsley or sugar. Maybe all three. 
Nevertheless the fact is was a bit bland it has a lot of potential.

Please do not alter this recipe. I keep reading reviews about adding herbs. That completely ruins the sauce in my opinion. The point of the vodka is to change the flavor of the tomatoes themselves.  When you add herbs you cannot taste the difference in the tomatoes

I made this for lunch today. I used crushed tomatoes that were preseasoned with oregano and basil and served it over chicken and herb Buitoni tortelloni, just adding a little bit of salt and a pinch of black pepper. It turned out great, a new favorite in our house.

I used half diced tomatoes and half stewed tomatoes; all canned from Costco.  As written, it tastes bland to me and is 4 stars.  Even as written, the recipe is time consuming, so I had to adjust for my tastes.  The first time that I made it, I added dried oregano, fresh parsley, dried basil, minced garlic, a few red pepper flakes and grated parmesan reggiano/pecorino romano.  With these additions, it's AMAZING.  The recipe easily doubles (I'm tripling it today) and freezes well.    I immersion blended all sauce ingredients but the second time: roast the garlic (for 10 servings, I would cook 2 cloves of garlic)in high end olive oil.  Roast and then broil the chopped onion.  While garlic/onion are cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a sauce pan and add the vodka, simmering until the alcohol is cooked off.  Immersion blend 3/4 of the tomatoes and add to the pan.  When the garlic/onions are roasted/broiled, add them to a food processor bowl as well as the remaining tomatoes.  Pulse to reduce in size and add to the pan.  After adding the oregano, the flavor was slightly flat but I didn't want to add processed salt, so I added ground, dehydrated shrimp.  Anchovy paste is another option.  By adding parmesan/pecorino (I use these cheeses 50/50), I added less cream - since I tripled the recipe, I added 2 pints of cream and 1.5 cups grated cheeses.  I used fresh Italian parsley and fresh basil.

I had to take a minute to leave this recipe a 5 star rating.  It is absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe as I was making it for my son.  I took some previous reviewers suggestions and added a little salt, basil, parsley and garlic.  My son, who is so picky, went nuts over this sauce.  I will be making this again and again!

We loved it! The flavor was great. I'd try to make a bit more sauce and we like spice, so I'd add a bit more crushed red peppers next time. Definitely going to be a staple in our house!

I loved this sauce!  I didn't change anything except add garlic.  Used it with ravioli w/ sausage, black olives, and wild mushrooms.  Would make again in a heartbeat.

Not 5 stars because I made a few changes, we all have are own personal taste...The only changes I made were that I added fresh garlic, Italian seasoning to taste and instead of crushed tomatoes I used fire roasted diced tomatoes.... It was just too good, nothing was left.

Excellent is the only word to describe this dish.  Followed the recipe, except for these minor changes;  Used 1/4 of a cup of olive oil instead of butter "health reasons", added 2 tablespoon of fresh minced garlic to the onion while frying, added 2 teaspoon of dried basil, used only one 28oz. can of crushed tomatoes,  used Hood non-fat no sugar added coffee creamer "health reasons as well" & halved the amount of Vodka since was using one can of crushed tomatoes.  This is a keeper in my recipe file.  Thank you so much for sharing it with us all.

The sauce was delicious. I decided to make it because I wanted to experiment with using the dried double cream that I had purchased online. Because I had used unsalted butter to saute the onions, and unsalted diced tomatoes (which I pureed in the blender) I needed to add quite a bit of salt. I also added Italian seasoning mix, sugar, fresh basil, fresh parsley and grated cheese. I prepared the dried double cream by placing the required amount in a measuring cut and then adding boiling  water to the 2 cup mark, and then whisking it together. The sauce thickened up nicely after the addition of the cream and the 30 minutes of simmering. We are pasta lovers and this recipe will be made often for many different occasions. Thanks for sharing it.

This was SO easy to do (not  fast - EASY) and it was DELICIOUS!! I've never made vodka sauce before - always cheated and used the jar stuff - never again!!
I used 1 can of plain tomatoes and 1 with seasoning.  I also put the tomatoes in the blender because I prefer a smooth texture. 
Of course, everyone seasons to their own taste - as did I - and I have to say this was by far one of the BEST Vodka sauces I've ever had.  
This will definitely be my "go-to" sauce!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was so good! Simple and easy with big flavor! Instead of canned tomato sauce I used sauce I made from fresh heirloom tomatoes from my garden. The inly change I made was less cream to match less tomato.

Great base! Added a tbsp of sugar to offset tartness of tomatoes, fresh garlic, basil, parsley and a dash of red pepper  flakes. 

Added some mild Italian sausage. Next time will add pancetta.

Amazing! I used one can petite diced tomatoes with one can tomato sauce as this is what I had on hand and it turned out wonderfully. There were no leftovers and I'm torn between being glad that it was just that delicious and upset that I can't have it again for lunch tomorrow. Great recipe and super easy! Perfect for a weeknight! Thanks!

I did add some hamburger and a bell pepper, but honestly, this is a great base for putting your own favorite stuff in - I'm going to do mushrooms and zucchini next time. The only problem I found was having a pan large enough. In the end I was forced to separate it into two pots because there wasn't room for the cream!

I could seriously eat this sauce like soup if it wouldn't be so gluttonous. You can add some bells and whistles if you like but I made it exactly as is and it is rich, creamy, decadent and perfect.

This was a good recipe to start for a base, like others have said I added some sugar, salt,  fresh herbs and dry herbs. Also for a smoother sauce, I put the onion, vodka and tomato part in a blender before adding the cream. It was delicious.

We  tried this recipe last night and I think it was excellent especially considering how easy it was. I did reduce the vodka just a bit but now I know that it could have easily taken the full cup.  If you like vodka sauce, add this to your list of go to recipes.

I only added oregano, basil, parsley and sugar to smooth it out as recommended.  I agreed that more than that would have overpowered the dish.  Makes quite a bit.  Had two more servings to freeze.

Loved it. I got so many compliments. I did make some small adjustments. I thought it was a little sweet so I added salt and it was missing the kick I've gotten from other vodka sauces so I just threw in some cayenne pepper. I hear red pepper flakes go well with this also. To complete the dish, I grilled 3 salmon fillets (1.5 lbs) and 8-10 scallops. After they were cooked, I cut the salmon into chunks and threw that into my sauce. Next went in the scallops. So good!

I loved this sauce.  I did add a dash of sweet basil and sauteed 1 1/2 teaspoons of minced garlic in with the onion.  Next time around I would like to try sauteing some pancetta in with the onion garlic mixture.

I made this sauce last night and didn't like it at all!! It tasted like bitter canned tomatoes and I followed all of the instructions and even added garlic and parsley like others recommended.

This was amazingly delicious. I halved the recipe and used a fresh tomato from my garden instead of canned. I also added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning. This was great on tortellini!

Made whole grain rotini pasta with this recipe. Added in some basil, oregano and parsley as DEED330 suggested. Finished it off with some Italian sausage crumbles cooked with green bell pepper, San Marzano tomatoes and a bit of spinach.

Will definitely be making this again. The way I prepared it was absolutely amazing!

Delicious base! I add oregano, parsley and basil as others have suggested (to taste) and I start by adding 5-6 sauteed shallots and 3-4  cloves of garlic, as well. Another recipe that makes me grateful for my immersion blender! It is 3-4 stars as is, but with the additions I like, it is certainly 5 stars.

I have made this recipe a few times. It comes out great! What I like about it is that it's basic, and as some of the others did, you can add other things if you like. My additions were a shallot sauteed in with the onions (it helped cut out the bitterness I experienced the first time as well), about 1/2 tsp. each of dried oregano, parsley, and basil, and just a dash of crushed red pepper for a slight kick. Great recipe!

So good! made this recipe with a few minor changes. As other reviewers, I added seasoning to my liking, and since I had all ingredients other than heavy cream, I made my own. 3/4 cup of milk with 1/3 cup of butter. Made two batches of it. Put the milk in a bowl, Melt the butter in microwave for 30 seconds and whisk the butter in milk slowly. Now that's your heavy cream! Then just mix in as the recipe says. Wonderful! Put leftovers in ziploc bag and placed it in freezer for another day.

This sauce is so delicious! Because I like chunky sauces and my boyfriend likes smooth, I used one can of the crushed tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce. I also added some oregano, parsley, and basil. I've gotten several compliments on this sauce, it's a keeper!

This sauce was just okay. You have to add just the right amount of sugar to it to make it likable. Would probably make again but for the time it took to make this, I was expecting something phenomenal. I will definitely be testing out other recipes for vodka sauce.

This is a great sauce. After reading reviews, we decided to stick with the original recipe and keep it simple to compliment our homemade ravioli. It was incredibly easy, and although it takes a while to simmer, there is close to no work involved. We made a full batch and saved all the leftovers which should make for some delicious gourmet lunches!

Awesome recipe!  I have made this more that a dozen times.  Usually spicing up with pepper flakes and adding Italian seasoning.  I actually won best recipe award with this in a contest of about 30.  Thanks so much for adding.

Absolutely amazing recipe! Could not stop eating it - so wanted to lighten it up a bit so we could enjoy it more often! We used Grade B tomatoes which we puréed in the food processor, olive oil instead of butter (also decreased the amount slightly), used maybe three to four tablespoons of heavy cream, and the rest 1% milk and this recipe was still ridiculously amazing. We also set the vodka on fire to speed up the process and because it was fun. But be careful! The flames got about three feet high, much higher that I had expected and I had to quickly move it to the island counter so that it wouldn't scorch the microwave.

Be sure to use a good vodka or the liquor is overpowering.  A good vodka won't have as strong of a bite to it as the cheap stuff.

I gave it 4 stars simply because I had to doctor it up.  Doctor it up with oregano, marjoram, garlic and it tastes great!

Very simple; very good.  Stayed pretty true to the recipe, but did halve the butter and used an equal amount of olive oil.  I also added a bit of salt.  I allowed plenty of time for the alcohol to simmer out before adding crushed San Marzano tomatoes, then let the tomato mix simmer long on low heat (about an hour) before adding the cream at the end.  Got lots of compliments!  Will definitely make this one again!

This was great and loved by all who had it. I served it with homemade gnocchi and made the following alterations: sautéed 3 cloves of garlic with the onion, only used one can of crushed tomatoes, and added 1 cup of chopped asparagus.

The sauce as written is okay.  It's a good base but needs a little help to be truly awesome.  Here's what I did (when making half the recipe):  I used Olive Oil instead of butter and added 4 cloves of minced garlic along with the onion.  When adding the tomatoes (I used pureed instead of crushed).  I also added 1 Tbsp each of fresh basil and parsley, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. After adding the cream I left the lid off the pot to help thicken the sauce.  My Italian foodie neighbor loved the sauce and his wife asked for the recipe.  I will make my rendition again and again!  Thanks for a great starter Married!

I halved the recipe. I also added dried oregano and basil. It was wonderful! It will definitely be a regular pasta sauce in our home. I served it over lobster ravioli.

I thought this recipe was quite good as a starting base, but like others mentioned, it needed a bit more flavoring.  I added a few cloves of minced garlic that I sautéed with the onions in half butter/half olive oil before adding the vodka.  Once the red sauce was in, I added chopped parsley, dried oregano, dried basil, and red pepper flakes.  With these few additions, this is a simple yet impressive tasting sauce you can proudly serve to guests.

I really shouldn't give this 5 stars because I made additions (which made it 5 star worthy); the recipe as is is bland.  I used EVOO instead of butter and added 3 minced garlic cloves to the onions.  I added the following with the tomatoes: 2 tsp oregano, 2 TBSP basil, 1 TBSP parsley, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1 TBSP parm cheese.  I also let it simmer an hour before adding the cream and an hour after.  It was excellent and tasted even beter the next day!

Great sauce base.  Add garlic, oregano, basil, and parsley, otherwise it's a bit bland. I also add freshly shredded Parmesan cheese at the end. To make it more hearty, ground Italian sausage is a great compliment.

I add a little garlic, chopped pancetta (deglaze pan with vodka), small slivers of sun dried tomatoes and some fresh Italian parsley - it's simple to make and turns out great every time - also has more substance and taste than you will ever find in a jar or most restaurant versions of this sauce, which disliked until I made my own.

Wonderfully easy vodka sauce recipe.  It makes enough for two meals even.  I've added Italian sausage to it for a little different flavor.  My whole family loves this sauce.

My husband made this for me...great!  We did not have vodka in the house, so he used a red wine...still fantastic!  Also cooked turkey italian sausage and added to the sauce to increase our protein.  Used cheese ravioli.  Yummy!

I halved this recipe and still thought there was too much butter (it pooled a bit on the top of my simmering sauce), but that's an easy fix for next time. Sauteeing 1/2 an onion in a Tbsp of butter (or a tad less) would've sufficed. I did add a bit of sugar, salt and basil just because I felt it could benefit this sauce. Served over some packaged lobster ravioli, it tasted fine, though I think an alfredo or a gorgonzola sauce would've complemented the lobster in the ravioli better.  However, that's just a personal preference....I give this sauce a solid 4 stars...easy to prepare and a nice accompanying sauce to various types of pasta.

This was so easy & so delicious!  I used over lobster & crab ravioli...amazing!  With the leftovers, I actually added some chicken stock and made a soup out of it by pouring it over tortellini and oven roasted vegetables...again, incredible!

Simply amazing! I will admit, I used this as a base to supplement my own recipe, but I can tell that even by itself, it would be awesome! It's a perfect start to one of my favourite sauces!!

Quick easy and tasty!  I used Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, 1/4 cup butter and evaporated milk.  I put the sauce in the blender as recommended by another reviewer.

Made this last night and oh my, this is YUM!  I sauteed a few cloves of garlic with the onion and added a little olive oil and used only a few dabs of butter.  I had a McCormick Italian grinder and gave it a few twists.  I also added a pinch of sugar.  Easy and DELISH!!  Thanks!
Update: I froze half of my last batch- it freezes beautifully!  Excellent!  Served over rigatoni with some browned ck sausages.  YUM!!

Very good. Need to add your own touches. I didn't have vodka so used white cooking wine. It had a nice flavor but vodka would ofcourse be best. Add garlic, dried oregeno, basil, parsely, 1 1/2 tsp salt. Made a half recipe for 20 oz of chicken torellini and had plenty to spare. Even the kids loved it!

This was outstanding.  The only change I made was I added 3 cloves of minced garlic.  I think next time I would add even a little bit more.

My 14 month old clapped for more, and my picky Italian husband asked for seconds.   Added oregano (1t) , basil (1 1/2 T), and parsley (2 T) and 2 cloves of garlic to the onions before adding tomato products.  Also added 5 chopped up slices of prosciutto to the onions b/c we were looking to use it up.

this sauce is wicked good. I added Parsley, Oregano, and salt and pepper. The salt and pepper really added a lot. I also added bacon bits. I added them in at the very end, and it added a great smokiness to the sauce and made it even better

Perfect!  I had a vodka sauce craving tonight and this is exactly what I was looking for.  Hubby and I really enjoyed it!  I halved the recipe since it's just the two of us and added a few spices.  Restaurant flavor at home...will definitely make this again.

Made this Vodka sauce tonite and thought it was a little bland (I added salt & pepper to my serving).  Next time (and there WILL be a next time), I'll add some fresh basil, pancetta, a shake of hot pepper flakes and garnish with fresh parley to try to duplicate LaPosata's in Marlton, NJ (they make great Vodka sauce!).  It was good and easy!!

i loved how easy this was! i did make minor changes, but i'm giving a 5 because i'm sure it would've been even better as written. i didn't have cream and was hoping for a healthier dish, so i substituted 1% milk mixed with a tsp of flour to help thicken. i also added garlic, red pepper flakes, and italian seasoning based on my food tastes. i also served this over penne, but added shredded chicken to the sauce first for some extra heartiness. delicious!

This was ok, I expected it to be thicker and creamier.  I used fresh tomatoes so I'm not sure if that made a difference.

This was tasty and got good reviews from my guests, but I thought it was a little bland. Like others have said, it is probably a good base, but definitely needs some doctoring up to bring it to the spice and garlic level that you like. I froze the leftovers in small tupperwares, which made for easy thawing for a pasta side in this rich sauce.

I don't like giving reviews when I don't follow the recipe exactly BUT, this was so good with off the cuff ingredients that I'm sure the actual recipe is a 5.  I halved the recipe, omitted the vodka, and used petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed (it was what I had on hand).  Absolutely delicious & easy. I was able to whip this up during lunch to put over some leftover pasta.

Simple and really good.  I added garlic because we love it.  I served it over angel hair but wasn't fond of that choice.  Will use a more substantial pasta next time.

Love this recipe.  Only change was to add a bit of garlic when I sauteed the onions.

I like this vodka sauce over the other ones here because it sticks to the essentials.  If people want to add stuff to it, go for it, but this is good for the basics.  I used vegetable oil instead of butter and evaporated milk instead of cream, and I added prosciutto and pepper to make it spicy.  It came out quite well!

This is a great recipe. I did as other reviewers suggested and added oregano etc. People think I am twice the cook I am after eating this sauce over simple pasta. The basic recipe as shown is a solid foundation for pasta sauce and it is now a permanent resident in my recipe book.

I had no idea that a good vodka sauce would be so easy to make!  This is a great base recipe, and I am always trying out different combinations of basil, rosemary, oregano, etc...  I also add just a bit of sugar to bring down the tartness.

Seriously easy AND delicious to boot! The only thing I changed was I added some herbs to our family's taste (dried basil, oregano, Italian seasoning, tiny amt. of rosemary, and then fresh basil strips for garnish). We made this with crab ravioli so I added the reserved juice from the can of crab too. All i had was good vodka in the house so that's what i used, not sure if that really makes a difference though. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I rate this a 4 because of the lack of seasoning in the recipe. After adding salt, pepper, fresh garlic, oregano, and fresh parsley, this was an INCREDIBLE dish! I also added 1/2 lb of italian sausage. My husband loved it, I loved it, even my son thought is was great! I will be making this again.

Awesome sauce!! Lives up to its name as well. I'd like to add little cubes of prosciutto to the sauce but haven't had the extra money. Still delicious in itself.

Great!  We use Pinot Grigio and let the whole pot simmer and extra 20-30 mins while the pasta water boils and the pasta cooks.

This is pretty good.  I halved it based on other reviews since I'm only feeding 2 and it still made more than necessary.  I think it could use a little less butter.  I actually liked it better before I added the cream, maybe I'll make it again with out it.

Absolutely wonderful!  My husband woke up Saturday morning and announced "I want sausage and pepper rustica with a vodka sauce."  This sauce perfected his request.  I stuck to the recipe, save for adding basil and oregano.  We had plenty of leftovers, and this sauce is perfect for that too-hot or cold!  Thank you!

Awesome. I always freeze the sauce into serving size bags so I have it on hand for quick dinners.
I've made it so many times, and everyone loves it. 
I do add some dried basil, I don't know, maybe a tablespoon, and maybe about the same amount of sugar. I usually just add a bit, let it sit, taste it, and add more if needed. 
To make an easy dinner I buy thin sliced chicken breasts, lightly coat them in olive oil, salt, pepper, and some Italian seasoning and broil it. Add some steamed broccoli and it's a complete meal. 
Hint: Don't use half and half, it messes up the texture. Also, don't use the cheapest vodka if you don't have to. Vodka that's a step up gives it a cleaner taste. Usually we have Absolut on hand, but I made it with some Belvedere and Grey Goose that was left at my house and it was even better.

I'm rating it a 5, but it didn't seem too easy.  I had to stir it a lot to get it to thicken.  I made it twice.  Made with 1/2 & 1/2 was not so good.  Much better made with heavy whipping cream.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipie!  Instead of using crushed tomatos I just used a regular jar of sauce.  It came out great.  A great way to make plain sauce exciting.

This was ok.  It made a lot of sauce, but it did not have a lot of flavor.

Great recipe.  I add a few things such as basil, oregano, crushed red pepper and garlic.  I also put a bit more cream than they call for but it's good either way.  I've made it a couple of times now and it has been amazing each time.

This recipe was fantastic. I did make a few changes. I added proscuitto and garlic while browning the onions. I also added fresh parsley,oregano,salt and pepper while simmering the crushed tomatoes. This was a huge hit in my family and will be served as left overs. Great idea!!

I honestly did not think this the best vodka sauce recipe.  The proportion of ingredients seemed "off".  I wound up scrapping this, and making my regular old recipe.

After I made a few adjustments..I only used a 1/4 cup of butter and combined it with 1 tbs of olive oil. I also sauteed pancetta with the onions. I only used one 28 oz can of the tomatoes and 3/4 a pint of light cream. It was phenom. My boyfriend loved it, and I didn't feel that guilty about eating it!!!

I cooked Sweet Italian Sausage chunks with the onion. Then let it simmer in the crushed tomatoes. I agree with the other reviews to cut back on the cream and add italian herbs. I put it over wide egg noodles. Yummy. My 8 yr old daughter and her friend had 2 helpings and my daughter's friend insisted that she take home a doggy bag for her mom.

This sauce is truly delicious.
I added proscuitto in when I was frying the onions like some suggested, and I also added only one can of tomato sauce and a LOT less cream.
All that cream is not needed in order to make it great.
Also.. used a little more vodka then mentionned.

This recipe as printed is pretty bland, but after taking the advice from other reviewers, it was very flavorful.  First I grilled up some chicken breast in a cast iron pot, removed the chicken and build the sauce in the same pot.  I used garlic, basil, oregano, and parsley to enhance the flavor, then put the chicken back at the very end and served it over pasta. YUMMY!!!

This is a fantastic easy recipe.  I thought there was too much cream and not enough vodka used, so I'm going to try for doubling the vodka and halving the cream next time.  Also, I used a skillet to cook this, and ended up making a huge mess as the tomatoes boiled and splattered all over my stove.  Oh well.  Delicious!

This sauce is very good over chicken, shrimp or salmon.  My wife and all our friends love it!  One thing, though - according to the sodium content in the nutritional information the original recipe must assume you will be using salted butter.  My wife prefers to use unsalted butter and adjust with the salt of her choice as she goes along.

Everytime I make this recipe, everyone loves it! I add a bit of crushed garlic when cooking the onions and I also add the grilled chicken to the sauce. The sauce takes on a whole new taste. It's great vegetarian or with grilled chicken!

I made this sauce and my guest loved it as well as I did too. I did add the crushed red pepper flakes (we like a little heat) and some sea salt too. After it was cooked, i did use some freshly diced Basil. Delicious, is all I can say. Easy to do, no reason to but the bottle stuff full of other stuff too!

Lovely! I'd been pining for a good vodka sauce, and this did the trick-you won't bother using jarred vodka sauce again after making this. I did make a few adjustments, as recommended by others. I sauteed about 3 cloves fresh garlic in with the butter and onions, along with a small amount of crushed red pepper. Once I added the tomatoes, I included some sea salt, and I finished the recipe off with 3-4 leaves fresh basil, chopped, and ground pepper.

Great recipe! I added salt, pepper, and some crushed red pepper to mine. I also substituted half-n-half for the heavy cream to lighten it up just a bit. Served it over bowtie pasta, and it was a hit!

This is fantastic!  I have made it at least a dozen times and I never change the proportions although I do add garlic, oregano, parsley and basil while cooking and salt, pepper, parmasean cheese at the end.  If you have it, make half of your vodka Citron.  Enjoy!

Made this one tonight - the sauce was very good....but it lacked the "wow" factor for me.  I froze the leftovers and will make it again in a few months....I had the sauce with crab ravioli (one of the other reviewers suggested lobster ravioli) and they were very good.  I would probably make it again.

wow! excellent sauce! i followed some tips and added garlic, fresh basil, and parsley. also added some cilantro for a slight kick. seafood is a must-do addition, especially clams, which give it that restaurant-style seafood pasta taste. shrimps, scallops, crab meat too. i would add lobster but couldn't find any where i live.

made this because I had leftover smoked salmon.  I have had this previously in restaurants, and am afraid I was not able to recreate it...  That being said it's a nice quick recipe.

This was fabulous!!  I used olive oil and a little butter to saute onions and 2 garlic cloves.  I also added about 8-10 leaves of chopped fresh basil.  To die for....

Very easy. i added spices (oregano, basil, parsley, salt and pepper) along with putting some galic in with the onion. Have added shrimp, chicken and clams, all with great results.  Freezes well. Half and half will also substitute for the cream, in a pinch. Also used olive oil, not butter. Make sure to have some good bread to sop up the sauce with!

This recipe is wonderful!  I added minced garlic with the onion and butter, and right before serving added shrimp and fresh basil.  My family ate the whole thing!  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a great sauce and easy to make.  I added dried oregano, dried basil, cayenne, and a dash of sugar while cooking.  My husband liked it, and he hates onions!

Yum yum yum yum yum. When I first heard about this I thought it sounded terrible. But, it combines the tomatoes that my hubby likes and the cream that I like.

This recipe is excellent, and very easy to make!  I didn't have any regular vodka, so I used Inferno spicy vodka and it added a nice bit of heat to the sauce.  Served with homemade ravioli stuffed with squash and roasted garlic.

This was pretty good, but would have to agree that it was a little bland. I added some Italian seasoning and garlic and then I still salted it at the table (and I am not a heavy salter).  I think I didn't use a good pasta choice for it.  I didn't use all the sauce, so I intend to use it on a different type of pasta next time, before I decide if I really like this or not.

This recipe was so easy and so tasty.  I have made it several times and it freezes so well, too.  I served it to friends, one of which stood by the pot dipping her bread in it.  Excellent, quick and easy.
