I cut this recipe back to 12 servings and made muffins out of the batter. Instead of vegetable oil, I used melted butter. I cut the melted butter by half and substituted homemade applesauce for the other half. I also increased the baking powder/baking soda and cinnamon to a teaspoon each and I used organic raisins. Very good zucchini bread recipe--very moist and slightly chewy. We really liked the cinnamon sugar topping but there needed to be a little more. We'll increase it next time. I think I'll add a half cup of pecans next time, too, as one of the other reviewer's suggested.

This was delicious!!! I made so many batches and gave them to friends and family. They all loved them!!! And now i have tons of people asking for the recipe.  However I didnt add the raisins ... I've never been a big raisin fan. And i added more cinnamon. Also i made a batch with walnuts which was also very yummy :)

Excellent - other than making muffins instead of bread I didn't, and wouldn't, change a thing. Just right cinnamon flavor - neither too heavily spiced nor too sweet.  Loved the raisins, which contributed interest as well as flavor.  My raisins were a little on the dry side but plumping them up for about 10 minutes in hot water did the trick (actually, I really liked how they turned out, all puffy and moist, and I just might do that from now on!).  The simple cinnamon-sugar topping was just perfect for these muffins, which I baked at 350 degrees.  This batter was so nice, and so accurate that I'll keep it in mind to substitute carrots or apples as well.

This was really good. I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1/2 cup regular raisins and 3t. cinnamon (instead of the 1t) to the mix and it turned out perfect!

This zucchini bread was very good.  I made this as written with the exception of omitting the golden raisins and adding a cup of chopped walnuts.  I would make the following changes next time.  I’d try adding another cup of zucchini and increase the cinnamon in the batter to 2 t.  And I would increase the brown sugar topping probably by half.  The recipe didn’t specify what size loaf pans to use and there are a lot of different sizes out there.  A word of caution – don’t use two 9x5” loaf pans like I did!  You will end up with very short, squatty loaves.  Mine probably were only about 1 3/4” high – a big disappointment.  I would think 8 1/2x4 1/2” pans would be more appropriate for this recipe.  I would definitely make this again, with my tweaks, and use smaller pans!

I actually forgot to add the topping (I know!  I can't believe it!) but this bread was still yummy without it!  Omitted the raisins and added chocolate chips instead.  No complaints heard in this house! :)

Excellent.  Only thing I had an issue with is it took around 15 min extra to bake.  Did not use raisins.  Very good breakfast treat!

Very moist and delicious.  I made a few slight changes.  Used 2 cups whole wheat flour and one cup of white, 3/4 cup veg oil and 1/4 c apple sauce, added chocolate chips and didn't make the sugary topping.  Will make them again!  Sooo good!

This is pretty good. LOVE the topping; jazzes up the recipe. Thinking it could use a little more flavor, somehow. Maybe some more cinnamon or something? I like it a lot better than the first recipe I tried; the batter is much more of a batter than the other was, which was way too dry, scary dry LOL. I believe I've found a keeper in this one :-)

Yum!  I´m in china and could get all the ingredients bar the zucchini which i substituted for a similar type of marrow and just drained off the extra water.  I cooked it in 2 batches the first one burnt a bit even though it was only in there half an hour.  The second one i put in for only 25mins and it came out well .  I really liked the textured taste .

This was amazing! I reduced the sugar a little bit, and it was still plenty sweet. I will be making this again soon!

This is a great recipe. I substituted the apple sauce I made for the oil to make it healthier. For a twist, I doubled the recipe using a total of 7 cups of zucchini (instead of recommended amount), added 1 & 1/2 cups of peanut butter to the batter and peanut butter chips sprinkled on top prior to baking. My family and friends absolutely loved it!

Excellent recipe. My family loved this. I have not tried it with the raisins yet, and it was still so good. Will not look for another zucchini bread recipe. I have found the one we love.

I had zucchini in the house, didn't know what else to do with it (with what I had) other than saute it with onions...came upon this recipe...figured, what the heck, why not? Result...everyone loved it (even the people who don't like or eat zucchini, let alone, many other veggies) definitely a winner...the cinnamon and sugar topping...great touch (sweet crunch)

This is a good recipe, I have made it many times and it is so versatile. Lately I have taken to using coconut oil in this recipe and find that it makes a more flavourful addition.

It was good and my family enjoyed it, but I would add some cinnamon into the batter next time too...maybe also add a few chopped walnuts for the extra flavor!  Overall it is a good recipe!

I love the cinnamon topping!  I actually halved the recipe, but used the full amount of topping on one loaf.  I also lightened it up a little by replacing about 2/3 of the oil with cinnamon apple sauce.  (Omitted the rasins, too.)  It was still very moist and super delicious.

So so good. I had tons of zukes from my garden that I needed to use up and this was great. I made several loaves and anyone that ate it loved it. So moist and tasty. The brown sugar topping really makes it. Even my seven year old loved it. Definatley a keeper.

This was very easy to do. I added a lot more zucchini for personal preference. My first real bread baking experience, was a huge hit at work. Will make again.

This is similar to what I make several times every year.  Very tasty treat for friends and family! They freeze very well wrapped in wax paper and plastic.  I place wax paper on the bottoms of the loaf pans to ease removal.  I use the listed ingredients, but I substitute applesauce for all of the oil, use 2 C flour, 1 T cinnamon, 1 t nutmeg, 1/4 t cloves, ALWAYS 3/4 C raisins.  And I have blueberry bushes, so 2 C are tossed in!  And for a special treat, I'll often make a batch with 1 C chocolate chips and 1 C cocoa!  I've only overflowed the pans once!  I'll have to try the cinnamon/brown sugar topping this year!

This was delicious, I used the suggestions of switching oil for apple sauce and adding walnuts.  I also added raspberries but probably not enough to make the flavor stand out.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks a lot!

Best zucchini bread I've ever head. The cinnamon sugar topping was my favorite part, and for someone who is not a fan of surprise raisins in my baked goods, I loved them in this.

Fantastic recipe!  Left out the raisins for picky eaters.  The crumbly topping is great - I just kinda wing it there until I like the consistency & taste.  I had several fresh-from-the garden zucchinis.  So I ended up making 8 loaves one day to pass around to friends & neighbors!  Thanks :)

This was a good recipe no doubt, and I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the flaws in the recipe. #2 repeats the end of #1, and then there are no instructions on what to do with the topping.  Do you put in on before you bake it?  Or after?  If it's after what makes it stick to the top?  I am confused.  I tried cutting the sugar in half, like many recommended, but it wasn't quite sweet enough, next time, full sugar.  I did triple the cinnamon, as reviews recommended, and it was perfect.  I didn't have enough golden raisins, so I added in some dark raisins, very good.

This recipe is good, sweeter than most zucchini bread recipes though.  I liked the topping.  I made this recipe exactly as written but for some reason it fell apart a little when I took them out of the pans. We'll still eat it but I never had that happen with zucchini breads before. Not sure if it was the recipe or not.  Would try with less sugar next time.

This is probably the best zucchini bread I have ever made. Really easy to make and my kids loved it. I ended up pulling it at 50 min because my oven runs a little hot.

Very moist, dense zuccini bread with a good rise. I used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c apple sauce, 3.5 cups zuccini, and 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar. That was plenty sweet for me. I also used both raisins and walnuts. We dry our own raisins and they are more tart and flavorful than the store-bought ones.

So good! I made it the first time as written (except raisins). The 2nd time I subbed half the oil for applesauce and used 1 cup of regular sugar and 1 cup of Splenda brown sugar and I couldn't tell the difference. Coworkers keep asking me to bring this bread in again!
Edit: After making this several times, I couldn't figure out why the loaves were so flat. It's not enough batter for regular loaf pans. Today I upped the recipe by half and came out with 2 beautiful, rounded loaves!

Very good recipe. The crunch on top of the loaf from the brown sugar is very nice.   The batter seems overly sweet BUT the flavors even out nicely once baked. Thumbs up from grown-ups and kids alike. This will be a go-to recipe. 

My substitutions: I used half vegetable oil and half baking margarine, dried cranberries instead of raisins and added half a cup of black walnuts.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. I find that if you add chocolate chips or get rid of the raisins it tastes just as good. You can add as much cinnamon as you desire since you can never have enough cinnamon! Great recipe!

Best I've ever made!  No changes at all  -  it turned out perfectly.  I made it with shredded zucchini from last summer.  Be sure to squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can when it thaws.

I added 1/2 cup of walnuts and used 2 tsps. of cinnamon in the batter and added an extra 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to the topping. I baked the loaves for an extra 15 minutes but should have only added 5 or 10 minutes.

I scaled this down to 12 servings and made six jumbo muffins, baking for 25 min. I expected them to be like some zucchini breads I've had, but they weren't.  They were on the chewy side, very light in color. The topping added a nice sweetness that wasn't in the muffins. They're good.

It was a little dry. I wish I'd read reviews before I made it, I'd have added the extra cinnamon.  I did double the topping and am very glad I did. I also used about 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup olive oil to lighten it up, and 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup white. I think I'll stick with Moms Zucchini Bread recipe, my favorite for years.

I thought this was good bread but might have been better with a sprinkle or two of nutmeg and/or ginger.  I used a half cup of coconut oil and a half cup of applesauce in place of the vegetable oil.  I omitted the raisins though I put a quarter cup of chocolate chips in one of the loaves.  The topping is a nice touch!

Amazing! Squeezed the zucchini after grating, used 1/2 cup lite butter & 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil. Used 1 cup Splenda & 1 cup brown packed sugar instead if all white sugar. Heavy on the cinnamon. 1 1:2

Best Zucchini Bread recipe I've used yet! The rasins are wonderful in this bread(if you like rasins).

Fabulous bread! This was my first shot at making zucchini bread and it turned out amazing. Very moist and the topping was a great addition. I did as another suggested and doubled the topping, YUM!! I did not alter the recipe but next time I may add some nutmeg or extra cinnamon. Great recipe, you won't be disappointed.

This is wonderful; one of the best ones I have tried...great exactly as written.  I do often substitute half of the oil in breads for applesauce to cut down on fat and calories.

This was okay.  Not too flavorful even with the cinnamon.

Delicious. I used cinnamon chips in the place of the raisins. The family loved it.
