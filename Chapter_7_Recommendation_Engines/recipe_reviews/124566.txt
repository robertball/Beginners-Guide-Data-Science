My new favorite roll recipe. I doubled the salt and was glad I did. Good rolls are made from notoriously sticky dough, and these rolls are no exception. Don't add extra flour if you want nice soft rolls. Some tips when working with sticky dough that have really helped me: Use a standing mixer to do all of the kneading so that you avoid the mess of handling the dough. Roll the dough on a floured piece of foil paper. This keeps the dough from sticking, with a minimum of added flour (so your dough stays tender), and it makes for very easy cleanup. A pizza cutter makes cutting the dough into crescents really easy. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I served these rolls for Christmas and they were wonderful...tasty and convenient.  I like that they are made ahead of time and then set out the day of to rise and bake.  How great is that? I also made cinnamon rolls with the basic recipe. Instead of rolling and cutting for crescent rolls, I rolled the dough into a rectangle, brushed with some melted butter and sprinkled brown sugar, cinnamon, a bit of nutmeg and raisins on the dough. I then rolled up from the long side (creating a log) and then cut the rolls from the log every inch or so.  From there I just followed the rest of the recipe.  Great!  I will make again for Easter.

amazing!! my family can't get enough of them.  very well done, but if you decide to freeze them, make sure you let them rise and then poke the air out of them.  they get a little odd-textured if you don't.

other wise, my new favorites!

Made these 6 times, put it in the bread machine for the 1 hr 50 min; dough cycle, rolled out as crescent, let them raise for 4 hr; then cooked, also popped them with a toothpick and froze. Took them out at midnight, was ready to cook at 6 a.m.They are alot fresher the next day if you don't do the freeer thing, but if you plan on eating them the same day after the freeze thing, you can'tcan't tell the difference. That saves alot of time. I cut the recipe down to 18 and it will do 12 large crescents. I have done alot of rolls and this is the best recipe I have ever found. I have stopped looking now. I have made 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour and those are great too!!

Very tasty. Thawed well and baked up golden and yeasty. The kids gobbled them up in a flash. Love the fact that you make a bunch and keep them in the freezer for that homemade taste. Infinitely better than Pilsbury! The only drawback is remembering to take them out 3-4 hours before you want them, but you can't have everything. They are worth the effort.

I had high hopes when I was making this recipe, but WOW!  I impressed myself!  The dough is sticky, but if you keep kneeding and resist the temptation to add more flour, you will be rewarded.  These are fantastic!  I'm dough shaping impaired, so I found it easier to make smaller circles and cut them into 8 pieces each.  It worked perfectly with my schedule--I was able to make them on my day off, pull them out of the freezer early Easter morning, come home after church and they were ready to bake.

These turned out well, according to exact recipe. Mine needed over 4 hours to double. I did bake them at 350F along with dinner items, which allowed them to raise a bit more before crusting. They were big, tender & fluffy. I think they are a trifle too sweet, but hubby loves them. I will make again, and compare with less sugar. I think a 4 due to sweetness, but will give a 5 per  DH and for good method.

I now make these rolls for every occassion. Everyone loves them.
My son was a cook in the Navy. He said to use warm water instead of milk.  Make sure the water is from the tap at a 7:00 angle.  Great recipe.

The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is they need more salt.  I will double the amount next time.  My kids love them, and to speed up the thaw/rise time, I stick them in a warm oven for an hour or so.  Works like a charm.  Thanks Linda!!

I had been looking for a recipe like this forever! Only one that actually worked and rose for me! I did double the yeast (when it had trouble rising) but after a few hours it was gorgeous and tasty! I put half the batch in the freezer and they tasted JUST as good a week later!

These were easy to make, however mine took longer to rise. I used this dough to stuff with sausage and eggs like breakfast pockets. Make sure you have plenty of time on your hands when you make these. They are worth the time. Thanks.

As a very frequent homemade bread baker, I was not sure if these would really be super good. It was a break from my typical method, and SO good. We now try to keep them in the freezer for a wonderful snack or to go with dinner. My children really like them and will eat the whole pan up within minunites! My mother-in-law drizzles chocolate on them when warm for a treat, and one daughter loves to put butter on them. A fantastic recipe!

Great!! I read the reviews and tried not to use to much flour while kneading....but I think I still did...they could have been lighter, but still great!

Made these for Thanksgiving after trying some dinner roll recipies and not liking any of them.  These were very nice.  I doubled the salt as recommended by other readers and tried to make sure to keep a fairly sticky dough.  I also used 1/2 lard and 1/2 butter for the fat. I would definitely try this again with all butter in the future.  I will say that no matter what I did I could not get this dough to be truly smooth and elastic, not sure why.  But they were fine after they rose.  All the same they came out really nice.  Such a lovely presentation.  Don't think that these are going to taste like the store brand crescent rolls, they don't - they taste more like a really good dinner roll.  I suppose you could even do them round instead of in crescents if you wanted to.  The only thing I will do differently on the next batch I bake is I will brush them with melted butter before baking.  I love the fact that you get to freeze them and use as needed!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

I substituted 3 cups of the all purpose flour with whole wheat. I baked some and put the rest in the freezer. These are some of the best rolls I have ever made. These are going to replace my standard recipe for rolls this year at Thanksgiving. Simple to make and wonderful to eat.

I use this recipe to make mini pigs in a blanket appetizers.  Make up the dough (change the servings to 32), then roll it out into several 6 inch circles about 1/4 inch thick.  Cut into 8 wedges.  Starting at the wide end roll up a 'little smokies' sausage into each one.  Bake on a greased baking sheet for 15 minutes or until done .  They are fun and easy and a tasty snack.

Genius!  Made exactly as directed using a KA.  Dough was very soft, but used a bench scraper to turn and fold which helped immensely.  I made a half batch, cutting each section into 8 pieces so I only ended up with 16 rolls - but they're perfect for splitting in morning and filling with bacon or sausage and eggs.  Delightfully soft and fluffy interior and while they *are* more like a crescent shaped roll, they're more than close enough for me.  Initial rise only took 1 hour;  shaped and froze as directed.  For baking, mine took 3 hours to defrost and rise, and were perfectly cooked in 11 minutes.  I love love love this recipe!  Thank you SO much for sharing!

Super light, fluffy rolls were delicious, but I like something a bit more substantial. If you love lighter-than-air rolls, these are perfect. If you like a more moist, dense roll, keep looking. Great recipe.
