This has been my basic macaroni salad recipe for almost 40 years.  I use more hard boiled eggs, frozen salad shrimp, omit the dill and use MiracleWhip in place of the mayo.  It's the only time I ever use Miracle Whip! Make it a day ahead, except for the shrimp as the flavors meld and the macaroni tends to absorb the MW, you may need to add a bit more. Then gently fold the shrimp in before serving.

This is SUPER delicious!!!  I made it for a family get-together and everyone loved it, and I've made it a few more times since then.  The first time I made it, I chopped the shrimp up, but I didn't like that the pieces were so small you couldn't really get a strong flavor from them, so the second time I left them whole and it was so much better.  And I use some I get at the meat counter rather than canned.  I also sub dried dill for fresh, and use about 1 1/2 Tbs, and that works well.  I also double the lemon juice.  One time I made these I had no eggs, and it tasted delish without them, too.  Really, I think this is a hard one to screw up no matter what you do...which is nice.

This is salad is divine. I had second helping as it was so addictive. I used Japanese mayonnaise and thawed fresh shrimp. Added crab-meat as well. Added more lemon juice to make it more tangy and the result was excellent! Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Wonderful!!! I use much more shrimp, hard-boiled egg, and all the other fixin's in the recipe because I like a really "full" salad :) I might even add some white lump crab next time hmm....  As promised, this is VERY refreshing, and light! Perfect for a summer's day. Thank you so much for sharing your grandmother's magic :)  I've used both the canned shrimp, and larger frozen salad shrimp. Delicious either way!! I will use one or the other depending on what kind of event I'm attending, or throwing ;)

Absolutely the best pasta salad I ever made!! I used mayo light due to the calories and had more shrimp. I added the eggs chopped inside the mix because my family is not much for garnishes. The green onion, dill, parsley combo was outta this world! I had my doubts cause I usually make a heavier, more spicy pasta salad. Never again! This is our new favorite!

Perfect when made as submitted.  My only change was to use fresh shrimp.  Next time, I'll try adding chopped avacado, too.  This had lots of flavor.  I'm not sure why someone had submitted feedback stating it was bland...

Prepared this just as the recipe recommended. EXCELLENT!! I severed this to my family, at a BBQ and a work potluck - everyone loved it! For the best flavor, prepare the night before. Really yummy the next day.

This was such an easy dish for a newbee like me!  The 1st time I made this I used small shrimps & I couldn't taste them very much.  The 2nd time I made this I used medium shrimp & it was much better.  I made it exactly like I was shown & it was great!

I made this recently for a BBQ at a friend's house, and everyone loved it, even the kids!  I made it again tonight at the request of my husband.  I should also say that I'd never attempted to make a shrimp or pasta salad of any kind before this.  It's super yummy and we'll be enjoying this recipe for a long time!

Made this for a family BBQ and it was a big hit!  Making it again tonight for another family get together tomorrow.  The only changes I made was I used fresh frozen large shrimp and cut it up into smaller pieces and used a little more mayo.  Also, didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I used dry.  The fresh lemon is key and really gives this salad a fresh flavor!  Love it!  And thanks for the recipe.

I know when people ask for the recipe it must be good!  Thought it was very tasty yet light. I made ahead of time but added shrimp closer to serving.   Will definately  make again.

This was the best pasta salad I have ever put in my mouth.  Made it almost exactly as directed except for had to use dry dill and also used fresh cooked shrimp.  Even my husband who hates macaroni salad liked it.  Thanks for my new macaroni salad recipe.  It's going to get showed off a lot this summer.

Great salad - I made for Father's day and it was a hit.  I made up the recipe on Friday evening (minus shrimp which I added on Saturday) and was concerned that the lemon was too much but when I tasted it on Saturday it was perfect.  I did not add the eggs and used 51-60 count shrimp.  I also added Old Bay instead of salt (I am from Maryland couldn't help myself).  So good!!!

I used bow tie pasta since I couldn't find the pasta mentioned.  I also added extra mayo, extra lemon, mustard & garlic salt.

This is a wonderful hot weather salad.  Could not find the pasta named so used rigitoni. I omitted celery as I can't stand the taste or texture, added additional lemon juice and lots of fresh cooked shrimp.  Served on a bed of lettuce with brie crostini.  Yum!!!

i really like this recipe and will for sure make it again, but next time will use only half the lemon juice. i know "lemony" is in the name of the recipe, but it was still too lemony for me, personally. i also used half mayo and half greek yogurt, just to make it a little healthier.

I could eat this salad everyday. I made this for 4th of July. I love anything that's lemony so I figured I'd try. Although I omitted the celery cause I hats that crunchiness in a soft salad but I replaced it with celery salt. And I did end up using much more Mayo.. I used the olive oil Mayo.  I didn't care for the canned shrimp next time I will try fresh or leave it out all together...  it didn't even need it with the lemon dill and celery salt flavor...

This is quite possibly the BEST pasta salad I've EVER had!  I followed this exactly and it turned out fabulous.  The only change was  I used frozen cocktail shrimp instead of canned.  I used a little less low fat mayo.  The salad is delicious and creamy but not heavy, unlike other mayonnaise pasta salad recipes.  Everybody I've served it to says it's outstanding!
Update:  Subbed shrimp for canned tuna and it turned out equally good!

I made this recipe but did a couple things slightly differently.  I used fresh shrimp and added a lot more than the recipe called for.  I added much more green onion, dill and parsely.  It was excellent.  I also used 3 egg whites and 1 egg yolk

Good but not outstanding... Unlike other reviewers, I couldn't taste the lemon at all. Will make again but I think I'll use cut-up regular-sized shrimp instead and maybe add a little bit of shredded cheese.

Good, but the lemon overpowered the other flavors. I couldn't really taste the shrimp at all. If I cut back on the lemon a bit I think it will be a better balance of flavors, so i will try again using less fresh lemon juice.

Make it the day before. When I first tasted it after mixing everything together, the lemon was a little overwhelming. The next day it was perfect. Instead of canned shrimp I used small frozen salad shrimp. I also used 1/2 regulary mayo and 1/2 vegannaise and the non-vegans at our bbq where raving and didn't taste the difference.

This is very good.  The lemon flavor is really nice, and the combination of the dill and shrimp and egg works well.  The celery amount seems fine to me, but I did find that I wanted a bit more flavor in addition to the lemon.  After the first spoonfuls, I added Old Bay and a bit more dill which helped.  For me, it still needed a little something for a contrast.  We added some very sharp shredded Colby which did the trick for us.  Very nice recipe!

I used fresh shrimp and elbow noodles. It was great and everyone raved about it.

This was very good. I've made this several times this summer already for picnics and it's always a hit. I have, however, made a couple of changes. I added crab to salad and used a bit more lemon and mayo than recipe calls for. My husband loves it!

This is one of our favorite 'supper on the patio' meals.  I add crusty garlic bread and sliced tomatoes on the side and it's just perfect on a hot Summer's day.
The first time, I made it as is and it's really good.  The next time I changed just a few items to suit our own tastes.
I added only one can of shrimp and about 1 1/2 cups of larger, cooked, fresh shrimp (coarsely chopped).  I used dried herbs rather than fresh and extra lemon juice.  Also I add ½ to 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper.  So good!

Delicious!  Love the lemon flavor!  Cooked my own shrimp.  Used some Miracle Whip as well...personal preference.  Wonderful summer salad.

This was wonderful. I used a bag of frozen salad shrimp and 4 eggs instead of 3. The kids even liked it,

I'm not a huge fan of macaroni salads in general, but this one has more flavor than most and is really good. I use the frozen salad shrimp in mine.

I sauteed frozen shrimp in olive oil covered in old bay.  Added 1 T of lemongrass.  Family loved it!  So easy!

This salad was a hit with hubby and coworkers.  Will make again. Thanks for sharing.
