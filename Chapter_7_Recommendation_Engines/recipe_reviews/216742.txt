This is my own recipe, and of course, I think it's fabulous!  When I cook in my Dutch ovens, I use CHARCOAL and wrote the instructions for using CHARCOAL.   6-9 coals underneath and 12 to 18 on top will give you approximately 350 degrees in your Dutch oven.   Also, as any seasoned Dutch oven cook will tell you, you need to monitor your coals and add more as they burn away to maintain the proper temperature.   Hope that helps!

I did not use a dutch oven to make this, I used a cast iron skillet in my oven. I just sauteed the sausage in the skillet with a little butter, then added the onion, garlic (I did add more garlic, six cloves or so), bell pepper, the hasbrowns and let them brown up in the grease. After the veggies had browned, I added the eggs. I stuck the whole skillet in the oven and baked it for the 40 minutes, then sprinkled the cheese and baked for another 20. I did salt/pepper the food while sauteeing the vegetables and I added a little hot sauce and garlic/onion powder to the eggs before adding it to the skillet. This was very easy for me to adapt to the stove and we all really liked this. I was tickled because I got a chance to use my cast iron skillet from start to finish.

I've used this recipe twice while camping.  The first attempt was done as suggested and seemed a bit dry, so the second attempt I mixed the cheese in with the eggs then folded it into the potatoes and finished it off with some sliced american cheese on top.  Seemed more moist and better overall.  Either way it's a great recipe and we found it to feed 6 easily with a little leftover.

This recipe tasted great! I cooked it at home, in a frying pan on med heat, and put it in the oven at 350 for the same amount of time. My family really enjoyed it.

This really turned out to be an awesome breakfast treat.  I didn't have any sausage, so I fried some bacon.  Then added the onion and green pepper to the bacon grease.  Mixed everything together then baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  Topped with shredded cheese.  Hubby topped his with sriracha sauce.

I have made this several times.  It is a great way to feed a large crowd when camping or doing outdoor activities.

I found that the type of sausage you use has a big impact on the taste of the breakfast.  For the first batch I used a maple and honey breakfast sausage.  It was a little too sweet for my taste (personal preference!).  The next batch I used a hot Italian sausage which was much more to my liking.

Ok made 2 of these for my son and 12 frat bros! Made one with Sausage as written...was ok...needs hot or seasoned sausage. Mild sausage gets lost in the mix.  Made another one with bacon (chopped the cooked) and they finished it off.  It was definitely the better of the 2.
I was at home so baked them in 13x9 pans in 350 oven for about 40 mins.

This was a good breakfast, but I thought it was a little dry too.  I used half the potato called for because 2 lbs seemed like a lot. Next time I will try adding more egg and some milk and see if that helps out a little.  It was still darn good.

I have made this recipe for many, many  years. It is one of my families favorites.
 I have modified it for baking indoor home oven(  put in 10x13 baking dish. preheat oven for 350* bake for about an hour or until a little shake and its solid and golden on top).  Dutch oven or home  ovens  both ways are delicious. 
You can add some herbs(garlic salt , rosemary, basil, marjoram  or...) to make it unique. Over the years  I've added when experimenting jalapenos, O'Brien mixture, ham, bacon  and different cheeses  too.
HINT: Great with salsa. 
It is a very versatile dish. Great for crowds or a Christmas Morning brunch. 
It is very filling. Left overs if any are an  wonderful.
 I have taken it to carry in's for a breakfast at work. It's been a hit everywhere.

Total camping favorite.  First time made it on a cast iron skillet on propane portable stove, was even better making it in cast iron dutch oven using charcoal briquettes.  I did do a 'misen place' camping method by precooking bacon, chopping veggies. mixing eggs and storing in a take out soup container, which worked great both times.  It's now become our favorite go to camping breakfast.  Leftovers keep and reheat well.

Excellent recipe!  Everyone loved it.  I used the syrup flavored Jimmy Dean suasage which turned out nice.  I could have used a lot more seasoning, as it was a little bland, but that was on me for not adding enough to the eggs; but it's rare for me to cook 12 eggs at a go so I just didn't add enough.

Basic and very good mountain man recipe. It definitely needed some seasonings though. I made this in my oven in an enameled dutch oven. 350 degrees and it turned out perfect in the same amount of time, probably could have gone a little hotter.

I make this while "Glamping in the RV" whenever we have guests. We never have any left over and my son-in-law likes to take 2 pieces of toasts and makes a sandwhich with the mixture as a filling.
Personally, I have found using diced potatoes rather than shredded potatoes easier to cook with.

Went camping with a group of 15 friends and was in charge of breakfast, I made this dish. It turned out great and everyone loved it.  Does need a little salt and pepper but we added that while eating.  For less fuss in the morning, I chopped everything the night before and used pre-cooked Jimmy Dean sausage to insure the sausage was cooked fully since using a campfire.  Everyone loved it and I was told it had to be used on the next camping trips!  If you have a second dutch oven biscuits go well with this meal as well.  This year we had more campers, make sure if you increase ingredients to increase your cook time as well.

I enjoyed this recipe.  The few alterations I made, I used rum extract (not as much as recipes for rum) I use pepridge farm brown sugar bread and cinnamon raisin bread.
I used condensed milk ( bought wrong milk but it worked) Trying to reduce sugar I used stevia for white sugar, and brown sugar.
I would do over however if using a abolong cake pan I would either double the recipe as it was too shallow pudding,  or use  a  smaller dish.  Over all a great recipe.

I made this recipe “as-is” and I feel like it could use a little seasoning.  The recipe itself was great, and I’ll definitely be using it again.  However, I added a little salt, pepper, and garlic salt to individual servings and it added a nice flavor.  This may be my new “go-to” for Saturday morning camping!

This is a favorite with Boy Scouts.  Such a good and hearty meal.  I have made a home version and either way, it's so good and satisfying.  Wrap the filling in a flour tortilla, and you have a great breakfast burrito.  Yummy!

HUGE hit with our camping group. From starting the fire to meal time was @3 hours (most of that time was getting the campfire coals just right). Great recipe if you have the time. Making it on our next camping trip.

Easy as can be. I used 9 coals on the bottom and 16 on top and it was perfect. I added extra garlic and also some seasonings I like. This fed 6 adult men.

My sons Cub Scout Pack used this recipe on our camping trip.  It was a big hit.  The parchment paper made easy clean up which is an awesome benefit when cooking in the woods.
This is an easy recipe to make your own.  Use different breakfast meats like bacon, ham or spicy sausages or different veggies.

Certainly worth cooking again. I will attempt to keep it from being so dry by adding a little cream to the egg mixture, btw I added 6 eggs to recipe which could have played in the role in the dryness. I should have added more salt. Over all every one liked it including all the kids.  Will be making again, this is to easy, especially when there's a group and you are not wanting to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.

This is a delicious meal to have while camping, especially during the cold. We prepared it while at BALOO training for our local scouting program. Everyone loved it!

Added water to the eggs to get them to flow.  Added spinach.  Yum.

This is an awesome breakfast for camping!  I have fixed it three times for various groups we have camped with and it has been a hit every time.  I really like serving it with flour tortillas.  This is on my permanent recipe list for camping.

I think charcoal briquettes work the best for temperature control.  I tried one time with lump charcoal and another using hot coals from a campfire but the briquettes worked the best!

Giving this 5 stars because of the inspiration & idea provided. Used the basic recipe idea but added crumbled bacon & cayenne pepper. Camping with multiple families ....a 7 qt Dutch oven fed 8 adults for 2 breakfasts...the leftovers were even better! I precooked the sausage, bacon & home fries...easier storage for travel plus good call;  unforeseen overnite rain storm= no campfire in the am...so had to cook this on propane grill...took longer but still a hit! Leftovers tasted like hash.

I simplified this by buying the precooked crumbled sausage and just put all the ingredients in at once, mixed it well and topped with some more shredded cheese.  Turned out great!

So yummy! We've used this recipe for camping and tailgating at football games, putting the coals down right on the pavement! Works great!

I don't use coals on the top, it gets hot enough to bake. She's right though, this makes allot!!! I also used a 10 inch oven and cut the recipe and half. Still made enough for breakfast for a few day's. It freezes and refrigerates good too for the next time. Maybe try with extra ingredients next time, but like it the basic way.
