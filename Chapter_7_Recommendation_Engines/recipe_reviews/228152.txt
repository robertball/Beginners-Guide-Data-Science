This was delicious!  We made it for a party and cut it into smaller pieces so it was more like an appetizer.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  The only thing we did different from the original recipe is to brush the crust with a little olive oil before we baked it.

This was so good! It was a nice change from typical pizza. I made this with shrimp, I sautéed them first in butter, olive oil, garlic and salt and pepper, turned out wonderful! My husband said this recipe is a keeper!

My roommate and I just made this and we loved it.  We put some olive oil on the crust before baking it.  Also, we laid all the tomatoes flat and then put a little cheese on it, then a little chicken, then a lot more cheese, then all the chicken then the rest of the cheese.  It was really delicious!

This was amazing!  I will be making this quite often. It was so easy!  I couldn't find the artisan pizza crust, so I used pillsbury thin crust.

So easy and so tasty! I hadn't used a can pizza crust before, but the Pillsbury Artisan crust is hearty and delicious. Perfect just like it is!

This took very little time and even my picky man loved it!  I had to remove the tomatoes because I live with non-tomato living people, but I added a few thin slices of red onion and finely chopped fresh jalapeños to add heat, and it was delish!
