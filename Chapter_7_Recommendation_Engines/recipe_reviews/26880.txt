I loved this recipe.  I served in a bread bowl, though.  After the dip began to bubble, I just transfered it into the bread bowl and put it back in the oven for 5 minutes.

Very delish!  Quick and easy.  I followed others' advice not to use all the chiles --I'll use the whole can next time.  I also substituted the remaining quarter cup of sour cream for some of the mayo and was generous with the garlic.

I doubled this recipe -- and used lowfat mayo and cheeses -- it was wonderful!  People loved the spiciness that the chiles give it.  Made pita chips (from this web site) to eat with it -- perfect fit.

My new specialty! Everyone loves this one and asks for the recipe. I served it in a bread bowl with french bread and tortilla chips. Amazing

I served this at a party with pita crisps this weekend and everyone loved it. It was a bit too mayonaisse-y for me, though. I think it would be better if the mayo was replaced with cream cheese. Either way, it was a favorite at the party.

I served this dish last night at a Christmas Party and received nothing but rave reviews.  I doulbed the recipe and it was almost gone (with only 16 adults).  I recommend using all the chile - added just the right amount of spice.  One particularly picky guest stated I outdid myself.

I get rave reviews every time I take this dip to a party and everyone wants the recipe.  My children even love (although I haven't told them they are eating artichokes just yet!).

I love artichokes, but was'nt sure about my guests.  This dip was gone in just a few minutes, I barely got a few tastes, but what I did manage to taste was delicious.  Only one recommendation, double the recipe!

Good appetizer! I made this for a christmas party today and I was worried b/c I normally taste-test my new-found recipes before they're served to guests.  I took a chance and was pleasantly surprised.  This was a great dish, enjoyed even by my brothers who typically pass up anything with artichokes. I served in a Hawaian bread/bread bowl with toasted bread and butter crackers. I would make this again. Also, it's VERY easy to make. Any novice cook can successfully make this.  Thanks Ortega!

This is an awsome dip! I have made this a number of times and get alot of compliments and requests for recipes. It is great served with sourdough bread. Also I use fresh grated parmesan in this recipe.

Very delicious and addictive.  My husband and I went through a whole bag of tortilla chips...quickly!  It was spicier than I thought it would be.

I made a double batch of this dip for our housewarming party and I should have quadrupled it.  Everyone raved about and wanted the recipe.  Now, when we all get together, I bet we'll all bring the same dip!!!

I didn't have tinned chiles so I finely chopped a jalapeno pepper and threw it in...next time, I'll do two peppers.  Also, only had about 1/2 cup of Parmesan so I used Romano as the other 1/2 cup.  The dip turned out a little salty for my taste but other than that, I loved it! :)

I made this dip for a soccer party ( for women) and the recipe was right... no one stopped dipping until it was gone. I only got one bite, so I came home and made it for my family the next week.

We like our food HOT !!  So I used Jalapenos instead of green chilies, added a squeeze of fresh lime and chopped up the artichokes. If you like spicy... give this a shot.

I made this dip, on faith from other reviews, to a Christmas Eve party.  I was so disappointed. It was very oily and the taste was definitely not worth the calories.  I threw out the leftovers - of which there was plenty.

Do you need a great appetizer for a party or family gathering? I tried this artichoke chili dip and my friends all asked for the recipe.

Great Dip,

I only used half the amount of mayo in the recipe and substituted the rest with the sour cream - turned out great- everyone loved it. Unfortunately its a hot dip so you have to keep heating it up

I brought this dip to a Cinco Demayo party and it was very popular!  The only thing I would do differently next time is to use only 1/2 can of chiles.  Some people thought the dip was a little on the hot side.

I have gotten nothing but rave reviews when I make this. I have found it doesn't travel well when it's hot, which may account for the reviews that said it was oily, so if you have to take it somewhere try to bake it there if you can!

I didn't care for this recipe.  My dip was pretty watery (maybe my fault).  Won't make again.
