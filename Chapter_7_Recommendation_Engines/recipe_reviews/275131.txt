I needed a recipe to use my fresh picked dill and green onions and I saw this one. It turned out really well although I halved the amount of lemon juice because sometimes recipes can be too tart for me.  I used the extra sauce for mashed potatoes and it was really flavorful.  Thank you I will be making this again!

Not interested in making it. The photograph does not make it look very appetizing The picture doesn't even look like chicken. It looks awful . You should change the picture and make it look like you would want to make it. Sorry...
