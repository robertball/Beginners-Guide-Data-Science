OMG This was a fantastic recipe, the batter stayed on perfectly and the Cajan Ranch Sauce was excellent also! I decided to expermint and used 1 tomatoe that was riper. There is a reason they call it fried green tomatoes as the red one was mushy, I sure won't try that again. I have an over abundant supply of tomatoes and decided to try something different. I made the recipe exactly as written. You won't go wrong with this recipe. Loved, loved, loved it!

For those needing "cajun seasoning" for the dipping sauce but don't have it premixed... put together 1 tablespoon dried oregano,1 tablespoon paprika, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper and 1 tablespoon ground black pepper and use 1-2 tablespoons of this in 1/2 cup of Ranch Dressing depending on how spicey you like your dipping sauce. Use caution if you don't like spicey-ness.

Perfect Fried Green Tomatoes  (aptly named)! I even breaded and fried all the scrap pieces -too good to waste any piece!  I used Bolthouse farm Greek yogurt ranch dressing, but that was my only concession to healthier eating. I also didn't use a deep fryer, just flipped them in oil, not floating, but they were still amazing. I've tried other recipies, but this is the one I saved and will pass on. The ranch dressing mix with spices was the perfect complement! Delicious.

You are absolutely correct; this is the BEST fried green tomato recipe. My dad actually licked his fingers. Ha (that's saying a LOT!) I had a freshly picked summer squash on hand - guess what? It was delish made right along with the tomatoes. The dip is spot on as well. I am so happy you took the time to share your recipe. It is now in my recipe binder along with all our other favorites! Than you again for sharing.

I made the fried green tomatoes as written except for using ALMOND MILK instead of buttermilk and GLUTEN FREE RICE FLOUR instead of wheat flour. It came out fantastic. I liked how breeding stayed on the tomatoes. I'm going to try other vegetables.

Very good but thought they needed a little more salt, which I added after they were done. I used sea salt. Very good and even better after they sat a little while. I did not make the sauce because we like 'em just plain. DH was so impressed. Thank you for a good recipe!

Hands down, the bomb. We grow our own tomatoes each summer and use the recipe again and again. We can't stomach fair fried greens, after having these at the house! ??

Need to watch salt content in the Creole seasoning I use next time.  Other than the sauce was too salty, THE TOMATOES WERE FANTASTIC

It was very good.  However next time I'll leave out the flour. I think it made them too thick.

Used this recipe purely for the sauce to accompany fried green tomatoes - yum! Even if you don't have cajun seasoning (I didn't), just google what makes up the seasoning and still make to this recipe. Perfect flavor. 
For the tomatoes themselves, I simply coat in eggs then italian breadcrumbs; pan fry them with a little bit of oil - simple & delicious.

I made these fried green tomatoes for the first time in my life, tonight, and this recipe is DELICIOUS! I'd give it 10 stars, if possible! I used some large heirloom variety green tomatoes from my garden, and my entire family LOVED every single bite. This recipe and its companion Cajun Ranch dipping sauce is a definite keeper! I didn't have cornmeal on hand, so used packaged plain (Progresso) bread crumbs instead; I also didn't have buttermilk so used regular whole milk instead - both substitutes created zero problems. Make sure you coat any leftover tomato pieces to fry as well - they are just as  delicious. This truly is the Perfect Fried Green Tomatoes recipe! Enjoy!

These tomatoes cooked up great! I bought the only Cajun seasoning my store had (McCormick brand) and unfortunately, my first batch of the ranch was ruined bc of how salty the seasoning was. So I went back to the reviews and used the mixture another reviewer had suggested and that did the trick! The tomatoes themselves had a wonderful crispy coating that was delicious with a little sprinkled salt or the Cajun ranch.

This is indeed the PERFECT way to make Fried Green Tomatoes! I am not a big fan of frying but by using your method, these were the best fried green tomatoes I've ever made. I used my own spices, and I used Panko Bread Crumbs instead of cornmeal. The tomatoes turned out light and crispy and DELICIOUS!

My fried green tomatoes turned out perfectly, although I did do something’s different do to the lack of ingredients. I don’t buy buttermilk but, I did happen to have some sour cream so I thinned it out using milk and it worked great. The second thing I did different was i didn’t use red pepper in the cornmeal mixture I used the two tablespoons Creole/Cajun season. (I didn’t make the dip)

The breading is important in making this an excellent recipe. Adhered to the tomatoes and produced a crispy outer layer. We cooked these in a cast iron skillet, and turned the tomatoes at about 1.5 minutes. Otherwise, made as written. The dipping sauce was so so but that may have been caused by using buttermilk ranch dressing. Definitely going to make more fried green tomatoes using this recipe. Thank you Crystal McGlown.

I've made fried green tomatoes several times and this is by far the best! I think the flour drench and allowing to rest before frying made a big difference.

Loved the recipe.  If you like hot I mixed sweet n hot Hungarian paprika.  My cornmeal was medium grind n very crunchy.  I used measurements exact of the flour mixture, used 1 1/2 on the buttermilk recipe and double on the cornmeal recipe for 3 large and 2 medium green tomatoes—ripe heirloom fresh green tomatoes from my organic garden!! Finally—I’ve been wanting to do this since watching the incredible movie with Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates!!!

With an abundance of Beefsteak tomatoes in my garden I was driven to find a good green tomato recipe. This recipe did not disappoint! I stuck to the recipe as it was written and it was perfect. The only thing I will do differently next time is with the sauce. I imagine it’s delicious but the Cajun seasoning I used was way too salty for my taste. I should have started with half as much and add from there. Lesson learned. I ended up just using regular ranch for the sauce and it was still perfect.

Perfect recipe...I did do something different with the dipping sauce and it was fantastic. I used ground chipotle peppers and lime juice instead of cajun seasoning...yum!

I made no changes period. The cornmeal crust came out very thick and overpowered the flavor of the tomatoes. It did not fall apart when I bit into it, though, which was a plus in my book. If I make it again, I'll make sure to sprinkle rather than press the cornmeal into the tomato to make that part thinner. Also, for my taste, I could have sliced them a little thicker. Otherwise, for my first attempt, I'd say it turned out OK. If you're more experienced with cornmeal deep frying you may have a better experience. Also, next time I'll add more spice so that I don't have to use so much dip. :)

This recipe is superb. My first picture is of morel mushrooms using the batter recipe. Cooked them while green tomatoes were resting. Batter is perfect. Dipping sauce is spicy. We can stand a lot of heat but didn’t add pepper sauce because I made my own Cajun seasoning and it was hot enough. My husband says these are the best fried green tomatoes/morel mushrooms he has ever eaten and he’s quite the connoisseur. Thank you for sharing this incredible recipe.

These are truly excellent - as is.  The sauce I used was with the Cajun season #3.  Also great.
