Very tasty! I just bought umeboshi for a different purpose and then saw the recipe. This turned out so light and tangy.  I did add a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil because I like the flavor so much. Thank you for a new favorite.

Good recipe! I added double the amount of umeboshi to the recipe after tasting it the first time around. Thanks!

This was great. I used it to cook some eggplant in and it was delicious!
