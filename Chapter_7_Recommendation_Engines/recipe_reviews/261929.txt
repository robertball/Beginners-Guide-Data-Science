I made this for supper tonight and enjoyed it. I used a frozen pie crust in a foil pan and just layered all the ingredients into the frozen crust and baked it at 375 degrees for about 50 minutes. I doubled the broccoli. One mistake that allrecipes needs to correct is the amount of dry mustard in this recipe. I checked the submitter's personal recipe, and it called for 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, not 1/2 cup!
