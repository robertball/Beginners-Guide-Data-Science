Beyond perfection - and really easy!  I had a 20 lb ham, so I did two sticks of butter and a cup and half of honey.  I only really had to baste a handful of times.  My company raved and raved and raved about this, asking where I bought the ham, and trying to decide why it was so delicious--everyone wanted to take leftovers.  A huge success!

Very easy & very good. I had plenty of lefover butter mix for my 10.5 lb ham, so if you don't have all the butter on-hand, don't sweat it. The ham came out wonderfully moist & still a little sweet. I did have to cover the ham with tin foil half-way through as the top was burning quite a bit, but I will definitely use this recipe again!

Ham is not my favorite meal.  My family loves it so every so often I make it.  I have to say this was one of the better hams I've tasted.  I would make this again.  The butter and honey gave the ham a wonderful flavor.   Tender and didn't taste like a sugar glaze.  Very good.

YUM~  I had a whole uncooked ham that I had cut into 3rds and frozen.  Not sure how much.  But I put one of the thirds in the slow cooker on high for 8 hours.  I melted some butter and honey and added 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  Poured it over the top and let it cook all day.  The house smelled great - like grandma was doing the cooking.  I ladled a spoon of the sauce over the ham before serving. 
Ended up very moist, tender, tasty!  YUM~

This was amazing!  And so easy to do.  I used an injector too and it made the ham so moist and flavorful.  The ham was gone in minutes and even my 9 year old loved it.  He wanted it as a snack the next day!  I would highly recommend this recipe.  But, use the injector to get the flavor throughout the ham.

Yummy! I had a pr-sliced ham so instead of using whole cloves I addded a couple tsps. of ground cloves to the glaze before putting it on the ham. This is a tasty & easy recipe.  :)

I forgot to get one of the ingredients for the glaze I usually use. This was so much better and so simple. My husband normally has a couple of slices of ham and that's it, but he kept coming back for more with this one. Thanks.

I don't particularly care for ham and this was very good.  The honey/butter really made for a beautiful glaze and tons of sweet flavor.  We used some of the extra drippings to garnish the meat on the plates before serving them.  If I'm making ham, it's going to have to be this recipe!

Very good Easter ham!!! My parents, fiance & friends really enjoyed this. :-) If you are expecting a fancy ham, this is not the recipe to try. If you are looking for a simple, honey baked ham, then you gotta try this! Having said that, I did find it necessary to make a few adjustments. B/c this recipe didn't specify the type of ham to use (i.e. shank, butt or whole), I went with a bone-in butt. B/c I was only cooking for 6 adults & a child, I chose an 8 lb. ham (anticipating leftovers). I adjusted the honey/butter mix. accordingly (i.e. 1/2 c. ea.). I didn't use nearly the amt. of cloves called for either. I didn't even need a 1/4 c. worth (and my ham was completely studded!). Oh, and I used an injector, although I could barely tell I had done so (most of the glaze flavor is on the outside). A couple things to note: a) It is advisable to place a c. or so of liquid in the bottom of your roasting pan. W/o it, you'll barely have enuf drippings to baste with. Use whatever you like - H2O, ginger ale, cola (I used ginger ale). b) I had to add another c. of liquid 1/2 way thru cooking (butter mix. dripped off ham & carmelized in pan). c) Always cook your (uncooked) ham to an internal temp. of 160 deg. and let it rest for 15 min. or so b4 slicing it. My ham was fully cooked in 2.5 hrs.& sliced perfectly after cooling down (I set my WS digital thermometer to register 160 deg., but still set my oven timer for reviewing purposes). Try this. I'm sure you'll enjoy it! :-)

This recipe is so tasty and easy that I am ashamed to admit I didn't think of it myself. I usually don't review recipes that I have altered because I don't think it's fair to the person who submitted it, but I will make an excpetion in this case.  My husband usually gets a giant ham from work every year for christmas. It is way too much to have for  even Christmas dinner since we usually do a turkey also. It is hard to store whole so I always cut it up and divide between large ziplocks to fit in my freezer.  For this reason I could not do the recipe exactly at it is written.  I did not change the ingredients, just the method.  I heated the honey and butter and cloves then dipped each slice of ham into the mixture and layered into my slow cooker. I poured the additional honey butter on top of the ham and put the cooker on low for all day. I am sure that this would be delicious cooked the way the recipe states in the oven, but I was worried that since my ham was in slices already that it might get too dried out. I must try it sometime with a whole small ham or spiral cut in the oven.  I still can't believe its so easy and using my slow cooker made it even easier!

I normally make a Brown Sugar style ham but one Sunday morning as I was preparing a dish for potluck I realized I had left my brown sugar at work where I had made apple cider.  Oh no!  I used this recipe simply because it had no brown sugar in it and really enjoyed it!  Great, simple recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

Very moist, not too sweet.  I was able to use the drippings off of the ham for gravey.  I smothered the whole 20 lb ham with the honey butter (I omitted the cloves), placed pinapple slices on the top for looks, cooked it in an electric roaster, and basted it every 30 min.  It cooked for about 6 hours, and it almost melted in you mouth.  Thanks for the suggesstion.

I used this recipe for my first ham.  It is honestly one of the best hams I've ever tasted!  I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 c of honey for a 9lb ham.  Put in roasting pan with 1 can of ginger ale in the bottom, and covered with foil.  I only basted it 3 times in 2 hours, and it was tender and flavorful---but not too flavorful.  I wanted it to taste like grandma's ham with my twist, and it did!  This is perfect for beginners or those who haven't baked a ham before.  I'll use again for Easter!

My boyfriend and I absolutely love ham, and I was exicted to see a recipe with such good reviews.  We were disappointed in this glaze.  It is just too bland.  Plus, it was very greasy.  Ham makes enough grease without the added butter.  You could maybe overlook the extra grease if flavor was added, but it wasn't.

Simple and delicious. This turned out moist and didn't seem overly sweet like I was afraid it would be. I used a hickory smoked pre-sliced ham that was precooked but it still had to bake in the oven for an hour so I glazed it with this. I left the clove out because the hubster doesn't like it.

The best ham ever! I made this ham for Thanksgiving last year and everyone requested that I make it again for Easter.  So, this is what is on the menu tonight for dinner!  I left out the cloves since I'm not a huge fan of them.

Pretty good, however my husband tweeked the recipe a little and didnt used the optional whole cloves. Instead he added about the same amount of (Smuckers Orchards Finest Northwest Triple berry Preserves) as the honey and butter then blended everything while heating in the microwave. He then used this as the glaze and it was very good.

We loved this.  The only thing I will do differently next time is make sure to use butter with no salt.  Our ham was a little  to salty, but you could really taste the honey, it was great!

The honey butter mixture did not make any difference in the flavor.  The top of the ham burned do ti so much sugar.  It might work better if applied the last 20 minutes of baking.  I have heard that glazes burn if put on too soon.  I had to trim the ham to get rid of the tough black burn on the top.  I will never try this recipe again and was greatly disappointed in it.

I think the secret here is to use a ham "butt" portion. This recipe made for a very juicy flavorful ham...YUMMY!!

Had a cottage roll and decided to try a new recipe. I usually make a bone in ham. (boil first in maple water/sugared water, then bake with a maple/hot Tony Roma sauce) so this was totally new to me. And it was fabulous! The honey butter glaze is fantastic. Can't wait for lunch tomorrow.... Ham sandwiches anyone? Lol

Not salty, great tasting.  Omitted optional cloves and cut down on butter like previous reviewer suggested.  Mine was starting to burn on the top corner 2/3 of the time through, so maybe to cook time can be shortened...

I made this ham tonight for myself and my little sister. But i added pear juice and pears to the pan. It was AWESOME and DELICIOUS and as my sister says "YUMMY IN MY TUMMY" I thickened the juices a bit and my sister dubbed it a sweet pear gravy. It was amazing

Yummy! I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it! I cooked the ham in the slow cooker on high for about 6 hours. I also injected before cooking (and then about 3 more times while cooking) And I also had to add about a quarter cup of liquid to the  slow cooker (as per the slow cooker instructions) I had apple juice on hand, which worked well with the honey and butter. I am planning to make this ham recipe again next Easter! It was super.

Very good, this was a hit at my Christmas dinner. We cooked our ham for 3 hours (it was small) and basted it with the glaze several times, and everyone loved it. Also, I did cover it with aluminum foil, and added some water to the pan. Will make again.

I used a precooked ham instead of the bone in ham and followed the cooking directions on the wrapper using this glaze. I did not add the cloves. I have never tasted anything so delicious! The glaze was really good with potatoes too! Considering the glaze consisted of only two ingredients but tasted better than anything a gourmet chef could make I would say this recipe is a keeper!

I made this for my first "solo-flight" Christmas dinner.  Not only did it make the house smell amazing, but the ham was incredibly juicy and tasted wonderful.  The only change I made was to add a dark, grainy mustard to the honey and butter.  The spice added a great complement to the sweetness.  I'm making this again this weekend for Easter and my family is really looking forward to it!

This was by far the best ham I've ever made.  I used an injector, like some other reviewers suggested and the result was fantastic!  I doubt I'll ever make ham any other way from now on.  Thanks a bunch!!

I made this along with a turkey at my first Thanksgiving, it went over great! My husband continued to rave about it for the week following, having it on sandwiches almost every day. I got creative and used an injector to inject the honey butter mixture into the meet, which helped get that yummy flavor all throughout.

Certainly easy, but not the best ham glaze I've ever had.  I found this a bit bland even with the cloves.  I also had to add a good bit of water to keep the glaze dripping from burning up inthe bottom of the pan.

So delicious and not too, too sweet.  Just enough balanced flavor and sweetness.  I cooked mine in a large roasting pan with the top on and basted every 30 minutes.  I had somewhere to go so I turned off the oven about 45 minutes early and left it in there until I got back (about 2 hours later) so it was literally falling apart off of the bone and the front was a little dried out but still tasty.  However, everywhere else was still moist and delicious.  So just don't do what I did (leaving it in way longer because the residual heat was still cooking it) and you will have a perfect and yummy ham.

I don't know what else I could add that has not yet been said.
This is simply the most delectable ham with glaze that I have ever had. We will have this again and again. 
It was my very first time ever baking a ham, I couldn't have been more pleased with the results. Thanks Betty

The ham was very moist and tender. I mixed the butter, honey, and 1 tsp of ground cloves. The mixture smelled divine and I was excited to taste the finished ham. I used a Smithfield Ham for the recipe but I expected the results to be more grand. It just didn't have "Wow" results.

This recipe is yummy and very easy. I altered it a little bit: I halved the recipe, giving me just enough of the honey/butter concoction to thoroughly coat the outside of the ham and I poured gingerale in the bottom of my pan. I stuck whole cloves all around that outside of the ham. It turned out so moist and so good even my picky husband loved it! Will certainly make again! Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm rating this recipe as 4 stars because my husband loved it.  I found it to be a little salty, and the ham cooked much quicker than the recipe called for, so it was a little over done before I noticed.

This was just OK for me. I used two ham steaks and cooked like the recipe said - 20 min. per pound and it must have been too long or you just can't use ham steaks. They were dry and really didn't have much of a flavor.

Made this for Christmas dinner. Was looking for a ham glaze with ingredients I had on hand. Turned out wonderful - even my mom who has made ham a zillion times asked what was used; she said it was delicious. I'll use this for ham again.

I made it without the cloves, but added a cup of brown sugar. Delicious.

I made it for Christmas cold meats and everyone said it was the best/most tender ham they'd ever eaten. They were directed here for recipe when they asked. Thank you.

Even my husband had to concede that this recipe was far tastier than his.  We had an 8 lb half ham with 8 people.  At the end of the meal, the only ones who had any leftovers to take were those that still had a piece on their plates!

I threw all the ingredients in a crockpot, set it on low heat for about 4 hours, and it came out great! My family loved it and I'd definitely make it again.

The honey mixture burnt the ham.  Baking it with nothing would be better

Thanks so much for the great recipe!  I changed everything but appreciate the template. I had a 20 lb. whole ham so I mixed the honey & butter until I was happy; about 2 sticks butter to 1.5 cups of honey. I cross-cut the ham, smeared on the thick mix, covered with a loose foil tent and baked @ 325° for 15 min/lb. (per ham instructions) in a deep roaster on a rack.  I added more honey butter mix every hour and removed the tent for the last 30 minutes to sear the glaze in.  I think the rack was essential because the ham won't wallow in the greasy baste or suffer heat transfer via the metal pan.  I sliced the entire ham and it was juicy to the core. Amazingly good!  I don't feel this method added a ton of flavor, but I didn't inject or marinate it either.  regarding those that complained it was too greasy...how? all the grease stays on the outside and below the rack level.  

bottom line: give this recipe a shot.I did and it's good!  see my pic, it turned out beautiful!
