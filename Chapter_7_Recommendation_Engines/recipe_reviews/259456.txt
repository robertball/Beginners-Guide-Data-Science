I followed the recipe as written, with the exception  of the rosemary, I didn’t have any.  Even without the herb, this recipe was amazing!  The short ribs were extremely tender, so flavorful and the gravy was perfect.  I will make it again with the twig of rosemary, just so I can compare with and without.  My husband loved it and said it was better than any restaurant.  This  is definitely a keeper.  Thank you to my daughter for sending me this fabulous recipe!

Very good.  First meal in my new instant pot and it was a hit!  I left out the carrots, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe. I have made this twice and both times we loved the flavor of the meat. I made exactly as written except I cut the recipe in half.

The ribs were wonderfully tender. That was it! Very little flavor so I added  2 T of “Better than beef” bouillon , another 2 T of cornstarch and 1/4 cup water...but a bay leaf or  perhaps even herbs de provence would’ve provided a richer flavor.
Don’t be afraid to add your herbs and cornstarch, otherwise you’ll get a thinner , less flavorful sauce. I even suggest a can of diced tomatoes! I served these ribs with some gnocchi and it ended up very very good!

This was a big hit at our house.  Fall off the bone goodness.   The recipe made a TON of sauce/gravy, so there was plenty for the mashed potatoes, too.   I followed the recipe exactly and had dinner on the table within the hour.  Not bad for a Sunday afternoon!  This one rates applause!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe but my family did not like it at all.  The beef was very tender and the sauce made from the wine marinade was superb.  Unfortunately I was the only one at my house who enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I followed the recipe correctly except that I used arrow root powder to thicken the sauce. To my surprise, the ribs weren't "fall off the bone" tender. I think the next time I make this I'll up the cook time from 35 to 45.  That's the reason for the 4 star rating.

I made this exactly as written using fresh ingredients and just over 3 pounds of ribs. But the meat was tough, good flavors but not even close to fall off the bone tender. I will try it again but add at least 5 minutes to the cooking time, and let the pressure release naturally. Staring the sauce was time consuming, mainly due to the volume of minced carrot, next time I would use sliced carrot

I made half batch of the ribs so I cut the recipe in half accordingly. Other than that I followed the recipe. I used a homemade wine but I don't think it was "bold" enough. Next time I'll buy a "full-bodied" wine. But the ribs were moist and tender and there was a lot of juice which would have been better with the bolder wine.

I used Penzey's Sunny Paris spice blend instead of rosemary, but otherwise followed the directions.  My husband and I loved this.  For those who thought it was tough, ours turned out fall off the bone tender.  I cut the short ribs into pieces before cooking and let the pot natural release for over 10 minutes before opening the lid.

Ya.  Way too dry.  Good taste.  But if something is dry in an Instant Pot it's an issue.

These were tough and rubbery with little flavor. Perhaps it was the instapot because the crock pot does a great job on short ribs

tried this and couldn't stand it. Now, being from the BBQ capital of the world does jade one in how ribs should be done, but this turned out just bad.   Also, as a note, I could not find beef ribs at the store. I had to use pork ribs which may have made a difference as well.   The wine marinade overpowered the meat. The flavor was just absent and even BBQ on the ribs couldn't save this poor pig. Good luck if you try this.
