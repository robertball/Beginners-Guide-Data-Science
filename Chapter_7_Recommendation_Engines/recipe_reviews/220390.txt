I'm rating this 5 stars on taste. I took this to work and had several requests for the recipe and no leftovers. The cream filling made with cream cheese is a nice change from the usual pudding. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and used a combination of strawberries and blackberries. I also only used 3/4 of an angel food cake, but all the cream filling. This completely filled my trifle bowl. I guess I need a bigger bowl, but everyone seemed happy with the proportions. Thanks for a keeper!

Very easy recipe, but the cream is a little too sweet for my liking. Maybe I'll add less sugar next time. I will definitely be making this again though.

We loved the creamy, not too sweet filling. I used all low fat everything and you'd never taste the difference.  I made it in a glass lasagna dish which kept it pretty but very easy to serve.  Mixed blueberries in with the top layer of strawberries for a festive look.

I made per the recipe, but just added a touch of powdered sugar to the strawberries, since they were bitter.  It tasted great and I look forward to serving it to a crowd.

A recipe for strawberry trifle very similar to this has been in my family for years. The changes we make are: 1) mix your torn angel food cake with one quart sweetened sliced strawberries, 2) instead of Cool Whip we whip our own cream, this cuts down on the sweetness of the desert, 3) the cream cheese is mixed with the confectioner's sugar and the whipped cream is then folded in. When layering the cake fresh strawberries sliced are always their own layer. Delicious! I believe the best thing about this recipe is its' diversity.

I've prepared this dish twice now, and it is by far my husband's favorite dessert. It's always a hit with the whole family. The first time I made this with blackberries because my son was out of town (he's allergic to them). The second time I substituted raspberries and I think I liked it even better.

This was very good.  Our store didn't have angel food cake so I had to substitute pound cake. I read all reviews prior to making and decided to reduce the sugar as several people said it was too sweet.  I'm glad I did because it was plenty sweet without the full amount.

This was very good.  I liked the cream cheese mixture and the touch of almond really shined through and gave it something different.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to mix everything together (all the sugar and vanilla) in with the cream cheese mixture and then fold in the whipped topping.  One less bowl to dirty up that way.  Thank you for the recipe!  It made a great dessert!

I followed the recipe to the T, except that I added lots of spiced rum to the angel cake.

Made this recipe one weekend for a get together after my kids and I went strawberry picking and it's been a hit ever since. Made it several times since and have had to double the recipe since it goes so fast. I did decide to add more strawberries than the recipe calls. Other than that, kept the recipe the same.

This was pretty easy to make and was delicious.  I ended up having only two sets of layers since my trifle bowl is so large, but it worked well that way.  Also, I added blueberries to the top and that was pretty and tasted great.
