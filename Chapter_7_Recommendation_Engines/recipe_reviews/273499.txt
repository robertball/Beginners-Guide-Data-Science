Fantastic bread, added parmesan cheese and butter 10 minutes before it was done. It was delicious

Smells and tastes delicious. I didn't knead mine properly so it turned out pretty rough. Knead until smooth

Iâ€™ve made this at least 6 times in the last 4 weeks...given it as a gift, had at a dinner party and made for us!
