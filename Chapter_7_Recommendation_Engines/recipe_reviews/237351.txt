This made for a nice Sunday breakfast.  It doesn't say when to add the bacon so I just stirred it in with the tomatoes, avocado and spinach.  Next time I think I would either add the spinach a little sooner or wilt it slightly in a separate pan and then stir it in. As my eggs were done before the spinach had wilted enough for me.  Overall, a very tasty meal that would work well for dinner as well.

I made this for dinner because I had an abundance of fresh eggs. It truly was amazing! I added an extra egg because they were small and plenty of fresh spinach.  Yum!

This is a good way to spice up the standard scrambled egg. I like my spinach well wilted when served warm, so I did that first. Then added the tomatoes, avacoto and cooked bacon. Cooking until all of it was thoroughly heated, then I set it to the side while I made the scrambled eggs.

Good eggs!!  Like someone else said, the directions don't say when to add the cooked bacon, so I just stirred it in at the end.  Loved all the ingredients and it makes for a great breakfast!!

I thought the spinach was a little overpowering.  I will make it again and use half the spinach and chop it up.  Otherwise it has good flavor and a different spin on breakfast.
