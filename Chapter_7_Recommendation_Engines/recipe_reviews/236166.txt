This was just what I was looking for today - light, tasty, and easy to make.  It wasn't "wow", hence 4 stars instead of 5, but very enjoyable.  I'll make this again.

This salad was a lot of effort for little return.  There was nothing "wrong" with it but it definitely needed more taste and the avocado, apple combination is fine if everyone loves avocados; I noticed it did not go over well with those who weren't passionate about them!  The look was not very appealing either- it looked brown and somewhat "dirty" from the cinnamon and the apples starting to turn color.
