Greetings all! :-) Thank you for trying my recipe, and for your reviews. This is a good, basic recipe and best when made a day ahead to allow the flavors to blend. What fun to read what others have added, mustard, pickles, bacon, radishes, etc. Because everyone’s tastes vary, as mentioned in the description, I encourage you to add "additional ingredients" to make this recipe "your own". Don’t be afraid to experiment, that's what makes cooking fun.  When adding bacon or chopped dill pickles, you may want to reduce the salt called for in the recipe. Have Fun and Happy Cooking! Joslyn

I have three favorite potato salads from this site but decided to try this one to start the 2007 summer.  We loved it and made minimal changes.  To make this quickly - first start cooking the eggs - then take out the large bowl that you will be using to serve - I peel and dice the potatoes and rinsed them in that bowl to get out starch - put potatoes in cold water and bring to boil - then lower heat to a slow boil and cook approx. 10 to 15 min.  Your eggs will probably be finised by then so cool them down with cold water.  Then mix all the ingredients for dressing in the bowl - add the chopped eggs and by then your potatoes are probably ready to add.  Very little clean up and no waiting time for things to be done - I added a tablespoon of ground mustard to dressing and only used 2 eggs but that is just a preference.  I thought this turned out great and it was fast.

Good, but needed something. I added 2 more eggs and 6 tablespoons of deli mustard and used red onion. Delicious.

Amazing! I add 2-3 tsp dill, parsley, 2-3 tsp of spicy mustard and an extra egg and paprika for the top. i also mix all the spices and mayo in a small bowl, minimizing the mixing of the potatoes. Great recipe. The inlaws (in sweden) are in love with this and have asked for the recipe! thanks a bunch!!

Great base recipe.  My grandmother used to make a potato salad similar to this and I had a terrible time finding this recipe!  I add some dill relish and a little yellow mustard.  Some garlic powder sprinkled in at the end, and it was perfect.  Thank you, Joslyn, for reminding me what good potato salad tastes like!

I get rave reviews with the following changes:  omitted the bell pepper:  increased the eggs to one dozen: mixed the mayonaise with 1 Tblsp salad vinegar: 1 Tblsp sugar: 1 tsp Lawrys seasoning salt: 1/3 cup sweet pickle relish; 1/2 tsp black pepper.  Added all to potatoes, celery, and (sweet) onions.  This is how I always make potato salad and it never fails to get compliments and eaten up.

Makes a large amount of salad (larger than I expected).  Simple to make.  Could use a bit more something to add flavor but is definitely edible the way it is too!

This is the perfect recipe. You can leave it the way it is,and it is great, or you can add almost anything you want to it! I added a bit of mustard, and I loved it. Living in Europe, I was seriously lacking some good potato salad, and this recipe hit the spot!

This is a great basic potato salad recipe. I have made this a couple of times and I wanted to share the slight modifications I have made to mine through my experience. First is the size. I suggest you use the six serving size as a starting point instead of 12. You will still have enough potato salad to serve 12 people seconds. Also, I use red pepper instead of green for the sharper taste. I also doubled the amount of celery for the added crunch. Most importantly is adding two table spoons of classic Dijon mustard (the kind where you still see the mustard seed). I am not a Dijon mustard fan in any way, except for using in small amounts to compliment some sauces. It really does add another dimension to this recipe and, it goes a long way to turn a very basic recipe into something more (it is very subtle). Lastly is the cook time for the potatoes. I suggest 20 to 25 minutes instead of 15 - 20 minutes, which I find leave the potatoes slightly too hard. I like my potato salad to have a bit of mash to the potato pieces and 25 minutes is just about right. Salt and pepper to taste.

This is an excellent recipe. Add more mayo and lots more pepper. Pepper is the key.

OKAY.  Very good.  But in my opinion, all potato salad ( and for the record, macaroni salad) HAS to have a little mustard in it to give it the "edge!"

Great recipe.  We have been making almost this exact recipe for years except we make it a potato/macaroni with the addition of a little elbow macaroni.  For our tastes, you definitely need all the eggs suggested in this recipe but I must admit we don't add any bell pepper. It repeats on too many of us!!  This is a wonderful recipe for new cooks who need to start with the basics and then venture out to add other ingredients as they get more comfortable. Thanks Joslyn!

If you're not an expert on making potato salad, this recipe is the one!  I got nothing but rave reviews and I must admit it was delicious!  I made a couple changes, I added a bit of mustard as someone else had suggested and I omitted the green pepper and instead added sliced radishes...  It just isn't potato salad without radishes!  
Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

I haven't tried this but my secret to potato salad is I cook my potatoes the day before and let them get cold so they won't smush. That gives the potato salad a good crisp taste and good flavor.

Very good.  I added a little mustard, rosemary, and garlic.  Also, and with most potato salads--- make it one day ahead of time because the flavors really come out after a night in the fridge.

with the following changes I give this 5 stars: omit green pepper(yuck). double the eggs,and save four eggs to slice and place decoratively on top(looks beautiful when sprinkled with paprika). I also like a combination of real mayo and whipped style dressing with a couple tablespoons of milk added to better the consistency. Also if possible i use baby(new) potatoes with the skin on.

I agree, this is a good basic recipe: I cut it in half, we're only 2 people, I used less green pepper, as I don't like too much, added the 4 hard boiled eggs, as someone suggested, grey poupon mustard, splash of rice vinegar, salt and pepper until it tasted good, little garlic powder, sweet onion and celery, AND I added about 3-4 crispy chopped bacon slices, low salt,  you can see I only made a couple of additions to the basic recipe. I would certainly make this again.

Absolutely awesome! I added some celery seed, a little bit of spicy mustard (like 1 tsp) and half a red pepper also to give more color. So good. It is now my staple potato salad recipe!

I've tried many different potato salad recipes over the years and this one is by far the best!  I like the fact that there is no sugar or vinegar in the recipe.  It's just delicious and my family absolutely loves it!

This is a pretty tasty potato salad, but it makes WAY more than 12-15 servings! I made a full batch because I had a lot of guests coming over, and had so much left over that I doubt we will be able to finish it all. The salad itself is good, but nothing spectacular. Just a simple, basic potato salad. I felt that it didn't have quite enough flavor...too many potatoes, and not enough taste. I did skip the green pepper, and used extra celery instead. Altogether, it was a good salad, and people liked it, but no one raved about it. Thanks for sharing!

Perfect potato salad. I left out the peppers . Took this to a family gathering and received rave reviews. My husband is a potato salad connoisseur and LOVED this salad. Is the only recipe I will use from now on. THANKS!!!

This went over very well at a picnic.  I too added a little mustard for color, and used both yellow and red onions, for variety.  On top I sprinkled the green onions and some paprika, which made for a good presentation.  I will definetly make this again, because I am already being asked to!

This is very good, but substitute mayo for sour cream and mayo, 1/2 and 1/2 and add sweet relish and splenda sugar (two packets) and dried onion (2 tablespoons) along with the green onion and add 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed  make sure the potatoes are over cooked, falling apart and they are cold before you add other ingredients Betty Parker

I added a little mustard, about 1 cup mayo, added chopped pickle, bacon, and cheese. Next time I will leave out the green pepper, I didn't think it went well.

Very good.  I add carrots for color, more mayo than recipe calls for, and more celery for the crunch.  I cooked the potatoes a little too long.  Jay likes them very firm.

This is the best potato salad I've ever had! I usually prefer more of a mustard potato salad, but this recipe has changed that. I diced the potato's before cooking, used red onion rather than white, added a bit of dill relish, mustard and bacon. I cut the eggs down to 3. I served the potato salad in a trifle dish, topped with extra bacon and red onion. Made an attractive dish! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I would add 6 table spoons of hellmans sandwich spread and 2 table spoons of Mustard to give it some kick. Thats the down south way of making Potato Salad. With some fried chicken and a biscuit and you got a good meal.

Turned out great.  I had to cook for 25 people, but I only added 1 onion and also added mustard.  Otherwise it tasted too much like mayonaise.  I also increased the salt and added black pepper.  And the red potatoes were so high at the grocery, that I bought regular and they worked out great.  Overall great recipe, but definitly needs mustard!!!

For my taste this recipe was exceedingly bland.  It is a great foundation for making one's own personal recipe to be spiced up with mustard, pickles, pepper, whatever.  Fun if you're an adventurous cook.

This is my new favorite! I followed the recipe exactly except for using dried minced onions instead of fresh. They give good onion flavor without biting into pieces of onion. I mixed everything except the potatoes together and let it chill while the potatoes were cooking so the onions would rehydrate. Left the peel on the potatoes when cutting them up. Add to dressing and chill. Very excellent. I also will try some crumbled up bacon (not bacon bits) at some point. I think it would be good, but it is fabulous just the way it is. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This is a great basic recipe but I omit peppers. Dont like the way they "come back on me". I will let you in on a family secret before adding any ingredients sprinkle worcestershire sauce on potatos and let soak in. Always use real mayo. YUMMY!!

Just made this today and it turned out wonderful! I only peeled half of the potatoes and left the skins on the other half. I cut each potato in half and then boiled them, took about 15 minutes. Cut them up after boiling and  after they cooled. I mixed the celery, eggs, mayo, onion and spices together and then added it to the potatoes. I also added some mustard. I used only red onions...it's just what I had. It's a great simple recipe, so you can add other ingredients if you like. It was very yummy and so easy to make.

This just didn't do it for me. It wasn't horrible by any means and I still ate it, but it just wasn't what I was looking for.  My husband on the other hand had 2 helpings and then was eating it straight from the bowl I had chilled it in. I tried to jazz it up with a little bit of mustard, but it was still missing something.  I'll keep looking for a potato salad recipe that suits my taste a little better.  Thanks for sharing though.

Thank you Joslyn. As you said in your post, it's best to make this ahead of time to let the flavors blend. This is a wonderful recipe, and the seasonings can be ajusted to fit your individual palates. Love the recipe.

This is a nice, basic potato salad. For some zip, you can add a few chopped dill pickles and 1 T. of mustard.

I make my potato salad the same way except I don't use the green pepper. I use garlic instead. Add parsley, maybe some sweet or dill relish and yellow mustard and you gotta party!!

This is like my mom's basic potato salad with exception of adding several different ingredients such as, a little mustard, sliced radishes, diced celery, and pickle relish. Also top with paprika and boiled egg slices.  Always a winner!

I added extra flavor to this - about 1/4 cup chopped fresh dill and a tablespoon of spicy brown mustard - and it was kind of on the "missing" side of things.  The taste was good, but I think I would have liked a little extra something.  Next time I think I'll add some crumbled bacon, garlic salt, pickles/relish or more pepper.  But as is - the basic recipe is great.   Perfect amount of mayo to potatoes & crunch.

Definitely worth the 5 stars.  It is also a recipe that you can easily modify to your taste.  I added some vinegar to the vegetables before I mixed them in for a bit more pzaz.

Very awesome Potato Salad. I made this last year for Thanksgiving dinner at my fiance's family's house and it was a big hit. The only deviation that I made on the recipe is that I added two tablespoons red wine vinegar. Perfecto!

Overall quite good! However, I tweaked it a bit (substituted the green pepper for chopped radish and added a little bit of prepared mustard and spices to modify it closer to a family recipe). Without these, I would imagine the salad would be quite bland. The eggs were also a bit too much, which earns the 4 star review, otherwise it would be a 5 if I didn't need to tweak it so much.

Excellent recipe!  I eliminate the bell pepper and add granulated garlic to seasoning.  The garlic flavor makes the dish! I top with  paprika, parsley flakes and halved, hard boiled eggs for presentation.

This is great! Thanks for the recipe! I made this for two parties and it was swept clean. I skipped the salt and added sugar instead. I also added ground oregano leaves and it tastes great! Thanks again.

Key Word - All American! This delicious potato is wonderful and I've made it three times.  Great taste.  You can taste the other ingredients and you may dial back the onion if you like less without hurting the flavor.  It's July 4th, so I'll be making this family favorite.

Good basic recipe, easy to adjust for individual tastes. My changes are this: I would cut the mayo about in half and then stir in milk until it's to the consistency I like. It's much easier to coat the potatoes that way and is much lighter. I like to add dill weed, some mustard (either dry or prepared), and paprika. (sprinkling paprika on top gives it a nice look too) I've never tried pepper in mine though. Sliced radishes are good if you like them. I don't care for eggs but my hubby does, so I just lay them on top whole and let him stir them in when he eats.

This salad is exactly what I was looking for! It is traditional, old fashioned potato salad that reminds me of happy summer days! I did use half the eggs only because I wasn't looking for so much of the egg flavor, but would definitely make this again using the amount the recipe suggests. Thanks, this is a keeper!

This is the perfect base potato salad recipe to play around with by adding different ingredients each time you make it. I have made this many times and my favorite additions are finely chopped red onion (to replace the green onion), 3 tsp dijon mustard, garlic powder and paprika. I always get lots of compliments (and requests for the recipe) with this version.

I could never find a potato salad recipe that I liked so I thought I would try this one. I made it for the 4th of July and it was a big hit. My family said that I am now the designated potato salad maker at family get togethers. The one thing I did add to make it perfect was cut up hard boiled egg. Personally I just couldn't have potato salad without the eggs!

This was okay. I added a little bit vinegar and mustard. I think I probably needed more mustard at the end, and next time I won't use the pepper.

Good, but I felt like the potatoes got lost in the mayo. A little less perhaps? Try adding diced pickles...adds a slight sour crunch...nice addition to the overall texture.

Just as Joslyn mentioned, this is a great basic recipe that can be adjusted accordingly to your own taste. I used only half of the amount of mayo (used light mayo) and added some sour cream. I don't like much eggs, so I omitted them and added pickes. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but just needs a little something more for us.  Probably some crisp fried bacon pieces and perhaps a teaspoon of garlic salt replacing one of the teaspoons of regular salt, 1 cup mayo/1 cup sour cream instead of 2 cups mayo.

I usually use a cooked dressing for my potato salad.  Have always like mayonnaise dressings but they never quite hit the spot.  This recipe is absolutely delicious.  Friends took it and leftovers home from our Labor Day Picnic.  A real winner!

Great classic/base recipe. I was in charge of potato salad and that's when I learned there were sooo many different ways to make it! I made this recipe exactly and it was good, but my husband and I like a bit more flavor so we added lots of pepper and some other ingredients: 1 diced pickle, some fresh dill, and about 1 Tbl. hot sauce (surprisingly the hot sauce really worked); we also left out some yolks, using mostly egg whites. This is a great recipe to either take as is or add you own personal tastes to at the end. I've already been asked to make it again!

This ia a wonderful potato salad recipe. I taste almost like my mother's recipe that I love. I would have given it 5 stars but it lacked the sweet pickles that I love in potato salad. With them added it taste much better.

Excellent! I did squirt in a bit of yellow mustard and subbed radishes for the green peppers.

this was very good. The only change I made was to add a little mustard. Thanks for a good recipe.

I made this for the bunco group.  Everyone loved it, I thought it was a bit bland myself.  Just adding mayo alone makes for a very thick salad.  I think the dressing needed to be more liquid-y.  I alos didn't have success with boiling whole potatoes, I'd rather cut first then boil.  Easy enough for a crowd!

I made this as written, and it was very bland and the flavours unbalanced, like it was missing something vital.  Two things I did like about it was the addition of green pepper, and the use of two onions, both scallions and a regular onion.  I felt these were both great ideas.
But, something was still missing.  I went through some of my Fanny Farmer and Betty Crocker cookbooks as well as a few others, and noticed that mustard was one ingredient they all mentioned that this one was missing.  So, I added a tablespoon of whole grain mustard.  This seemed to balance the flavours out so much more.

Save yourself a little time by cutting your potatoes ahead of time.  Getting a consistent dice allows for more consistent cooking.  I like the addition of the pepper, but I used orange instead for a little sweetness.

It tastes good using only 1 cup of mayo with 4 pounds of potatoes. 2 cups seem too fattening. Also, as a warning red potatoes are expensive. This is not a budget friendly potato salad recipe.

I just made this yesterday for a BBQ I had today for like 60 people. All I changed was using some green onion and relish. People loved it and quite a few people said it was one of the best they ever had.

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S !!  I brought this salad to a 4th of July cookout and everyone loved it.  I did omit the onion (kept the green onions) and added a little mustard.  It's my new favorite.

This recipe is awesome!!! I have made it about 4 times in the last 3 weeks for various get togethers, and everyone loves it. The first time I made it, i used the 2 tsp of salt called for in the recipe, and it was way too salty, so each other time i make it, i reduce to using just 1 tsp of salt. Also, I add about 6 slices of chopped cooked bacon and it is super yummy!!

This was great. My mom always tried making her own but it was usualy bland and tasteless so i always bought mine from the store. Since i moved from the states i have had to learn to do things from scratch and cant depend on my local grocer to have the short cut type things i am used to. This salad beat store brands hands down and whats great is you can play around with it and as long as you follow the basics of it you come out with a great dish everytime. Thanks for this recipie

When I use these ingredients for potato salad, I add a T or so of mustard (prefer stone-ground), paprika, and some Italian dressing. The mustard provides the tang and the dressing moistens and gives wonderful flavors. I still use some mayo or salad dressing, along with the other ingredients above. It's always different: sometimes with cayenne and/other spices.

This is really a great recipe as written.  I dug up potatoes out of our garden and wanted to make some sort of a potato salad with them.  I wanted a basic recipe.  We didn't have a green pepper so I left that out.  My husband and I were both so pleasantly surprised.  We ate from our big salad all week long.  So delightfully fresher-tasting than the tubbed stuff from the store that everybody seems to bring to potlucks/events.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I use only red potatoes and after cooking them, cool them in the refrige usually the day before.   I mix the mayo with a little milk and add salt, pepper, lawrys, paprika and a little garlic salt and a couple squirts of yellow mustard or more. 2 tsp. of salt sounds like way too much. I omit the green peppers and use about 4 stalks of celery, diced and about 1/4 of an onion diced.  Sometimes, I put a little sweet pickle relish in it too. When finished, I sprinkle it with paprika.

It's a good basic recipe.  Missing mustard and relish juice.  For anyone that just can't get the boiling of the potatoes just right, try this cheat from my aunt:  Buy canned whole potatoes in the huge commercial sized can!  The consistency is perfect every time AND you don't have to wait for the potatoes to cool.

Did not add green pepper because we are not fond of it. Added a bit of mustard to the mayo for an extra kick

Very good recipe. My husband subbed part of the mayo with bacon flavored mustard but otherwise we followed the recipe. Thank you.

I think that for every 5 lbs. of potatoes a pound of crisp, fried, crumpled bacon would be great! Maybe then you could eliminate the other salts all together.

Great standard recipe - basically use the same exact ingredients just add some dry mustard and the real key is some white vinegar.  My potato salad gets requested CONSTANTLY and is one of my nephews favorite foods!  It's a must try.

Plain American good!  The stuff the young kids like and us older types recall from quick summer lunches and thrown together picnics.  We enjoyed the taste of the diced green pepper and will do it again.  We use whatever potatoes are cheapest, usually Idaho or whites on the new side.  Red potatoes are a buck more a pound here and we just can't like them for that.  This recipe just keeps a very fresh, clean taste...a nice break from all the mustards and relishes and who knows what all goes in the bowl with more uptown folks.  Some times we put a little fine dice of celery leaf, too.  Our home recipe is identical (barring the red spuds and sweet green pepper) from the first heat of May through the end of November...and now we're going to spend the extra for that little green pepper!  Thank you!

I made this for a guy's wing night and it was awesome. I fried up a few slices of bacon and added it in. I also added a red pepper for some colour. Will definitely be making again and again! Play around with spices to find your own unique taste.

My family can't get enough of this potato salad! The only thing that I did differently was add a teaspoon of celery seed and a 1/3 cup of sweet relish and sprinkled paprika on the top for presentation. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. We love, love loved it!

Made this for dinner, it was really good!  I'm not one for potato salads normally, but I made sausage and I had some potatoes I wanted to use, so I decided to make it.  It was only the two of us (I only had 5 potatoes) so I changed the serving size to 2, but I think I changed the amount of ingredients for 4.  I used 5 potatoes, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup mayo, 2 slices of onion, no pepper, two stalks of celery and some sprinkles of black pepper.

I love this potato salad recipe, it's my go-to and everyone always loves it. I do although make a few alterations to it but this is a perfect base recipe. I like to cut up 6 eggs and mix them into the potatoes and add a few eggs and mash them into the mayonnaise, and add 1 Tbsp. of mustard. I also omit the green pepper as we dont prefer to have in our potato salad. And finish with a generous dusting of paprika

This is a great base recipe to tweak to your own specific tastes. For us, I nixed the bell pepper and added a bit of our favorite mustard, dill, and a dash of paparika on the finished the product. We just about ate it as our meal instead of a side dish.

It needs dill pickles.  Add about 4 or 5 dill pickles diced and you'll get the flavor that's missing.

i enjoyd this potato salad i would have given it a 5 star, but it needed something more, so i added 3 more hard cooked eggs, and mustard!, needs mustard for my taste, and 2 small green onions, was not a good mix with 5 lbs of potatos, so added a small bunch of green onion, and added a red bell pepper (like better than green bell peppers) also added a couble of small diced dill pickles (I know most people like sweet pickles) not me, my sister, grows and cans her delish dill pickes, (wish i knew what she puts in them) i will need to make the 1 and 1/2 hr  trip when she jars these tasty pickles, which she grows her own cucumbers, and herbs. also freshly ground black pepper, small amount of salt, due to the mustard, and pickles adds a fair amount of saltiness, love it this way, try this next time, i think you will love it!

My potato salad is similar but has a little more taste than this one.  I use a small amount of fresh Cilanro (well diced), yellow mustard, and cubed sweet pickle (for a tangy sweet crunch).  Sometimes in addition to the salt and black pepper I also add just a couple of dashes Cayenne pepper.  It makes a heck of a difference and even some picky kids like my potato salad.  Since I already have something green (the celery and cilantro( in my salad, I use a Red Bell Pepper for visual appeal.  Also the potatoes do not need to be boiled 15-20 minutes.  I just bring the potatoes to a boil and let them boil no longer than 5 minutes.  Don't forget to leave the skins on the potatoes for color as well!  Top off the dish with a light sprinkle of Plain Paprika.

My family has made this potato salad for almost 100 years, except for the green onions.  For those of you who want a little more zip . . . make sure both the green pepper and onion is grated by hand and use some of the juice from both . . . and finely dice the celery.  It's very hard to say how much of these to use.  I use about 10+ lbs of red potatoes and at least 2 lg onions and peppers and 18 large eggs.  Some of the eggs are sliced thin and placed all over the top of the bowl and sprinkled with paprika. By grating and using the juices, the mixture works overnight and is delicious.  This is always a winner, but the prep work takes a while.

I am not a big fan of mayo plus my Doc told me to stay away from it, so we made a small modification to the recipe. We used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1 1/2 cups of fat free greek joghurt, other than that we stuck right to the recipe and it was very good.

I just made this recipe this morning for a family barbecue!  I added some balsamic vinegar and sweet hot mustard and garlic to it.  Upon completion, it tasted great and my husband thought so too!  I can hardly wait to share with my family this afternoon!

Love this recipe! Simple to make and delicious. I've tried lots of different types of potato salad but this one has just the right combination of ingredients that makes it taste perfect. My family fights over who gets the last bite. Yummy!

I made this for 4th of July and my family loved it!  I used miracle whip instead of mayonnaise and I left out the green pepper and it was a huge hit.  I also only used 5 eggs because that was all I had left.  Will definitely make every year!

I followed the recipe with a few changes. I used russet potato’s and boiled them peeled and cut into ready to mix pieces in salted water. I added one Tblsp of Dijon mustard. Tastes great right after mixing and expect it to be even better tomorrow when served.

This was a great base for a potato salad recipe!!  Are used Yukon Gold potatoes with the skins on. And when I boiled them, I added salt and about 5 tablespoons of vinegar in the water as well.  This helped flavor the potatoes too.

Just like my mom used to make.  Did half mayo and  half Miracle Whip  and added 1 tablespoon of Dijon but other than that followed the recipe and it was a hit!  Will definitely use this recipe from now on!

I make several types of potato salads throughout the year, and this recipe is in my rotation. I think its best made with onions, as well as red or gold potatoes in season.

Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any green pepper and green onion, so didn't use.  I added a little bit of sour cream, only because I had to get rid of it.   Added 2 eggs.  This tasted like my Mom's and was a big hit with the family!

A really nice base recipe on its own or that you can jazz up whatever way you wish.  We added 1T of dried parsley and about 1/2t of fresh dill, along with a couple teaspoons of mustard.  Was just perfect.

Absolutely phenomenal! I have made this a couple of times and I've followed the recipe but have added different things to change it up too but it is awesome as is! I have added dill relish, and just a few diced up radishes, dill and garlic powder but you can't go wrong at all! I have added a little yellow mustard for just a little more tangy flavor! Definitely a keeper!!

A very simple recipe for a great tasting potato salad! the recipe does leave room 2 adding your own flavor. I used green and red peppers to add color and reduced the mayonnaise so it wouldn't be runny. Also, mixing the chopped ingredients, mayo and seasoning in a separate bowl made it easy to then just pour over the larger potato pieces and toss.

I omitted all onions  (as salad becomes very 'oniony' after a day or two.  I use garlic salt instead of regular.  Sprinkle the top of salad with paprika.  Delicious!!!Everyone raves about this salad and asks me to bring this to parties/pot lucks.

This was my first attempt at potato salad and I needed a basic recipe to give me a starting point and this recipe is perfect!  I just added things my family loves, like dill relish, celery, celery seed and a little pickle juice.  Delicious!

This is the recipe I chose to use as a guide for my first time ever making potato salad. I used 3 pounds of small red potatoes with the skin left on. I couldn't find a bigger bad with smaller potatoes in it. So, I cut down on some of the other ingredients. I used 1 1/2 cups of mayo, half a red onion, 4 eggs and only 1 large celery stalk. I didn't have green onion or the bell pepper, so I left those out. Everyone at the party I brought this to loved it. I got a lot of compliments and there was none left over. (There were only about 20 guests at this party throughout the day.) I will be making this over and over again. Definitely a keeper.

Love this one! I always add dill, parsley and ground mustard to taste. I also leave out the green onions and sub green peppers for red. I've made it several times now for cookouts and it's always a big hit!

This is the potato salad I grew up with.  I guess I like a little more egg, sometimes I also add a bit of yellow mustard and some sliced radishes.  Of course the kids pick out the radishes.

Good, basic recipe but as others have noted, a bit bland.  I need to play with it a bit, but next time I make it I'm probably going to add some mustard, or perhaps pickle relish or something to it to give it some more sizzle

Needs to sit overnight.  Added a splash of apple cider vinegar like others suggested.  Also added some sugar, paperika, garlic, a splash of olive oil.  Needs lots of salt and pepper.  I might add bacon next time.  Left out celery and bell pepper be I don't like them.

This is the bomb! I did make changes as suggested by Dale's review, and before I even finished it, I was "tasting" a little too much! Changes made: For dressing, mixed Miracle Whip lite with 1/2 Tblsp white wine vinegar, 2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp Lawrys seasoning salt,2 Tblsp Famous Daves spicy relish, 1 Tblsp dijon mustard, 2 t salt, 1 tsp black pepper and a sprinkling each of dill weed and garlic powder. I reduced celery to 1 stalk and whirled the peppers and celery in the food processor (my family doesn't care for the texture of big chunks). Next time, I may also add about 1-2 tsp of dry ranch dip mix (we like very flavorful food!). I boiled 2 extra eggs to slice as garnish for the top and sprinkled paprika over the whole lot. Definitely a keeper!  Thanks Joslyn for a great recipe :)

I have never had much luck with making potato salad, until this one.  It's now officially on my husbands "feel free to obligate the wife to bring this to a summer gathering" list and I know I won't screw it up.  Flavorful and easy.

This is a great recipe but all it needs is seasoned salt Plochmans stone ground mustard, bacon and radishes. This has been a family fav since I was a kid. There are many variations that work well with this.

This is our traditional recipe, too  I add a bit of mustard for some zing (used dill mustard and some fresh dill for this batch).  Simple and delicious, and adapts easily if you want to add extra ingredients to spice it up.  Mary Beth

This is a good basic recipe but I suggest a few more steps & you'll have a kick butt salad! I steam potatoes instead of boiling & also use a combination of different types of potatoes for texture, once the potatoes are cooked, peeled, cubed & still warm I spray a little apple cider vinegar on 'em.  I also add spicy brown mustard, slice olives, dill relish, a touch of sugar & a squirt of ranch dressing.

To get this to a 5 star recipe, you should add a couple of tablespoons of juice from sweet pickle relish.  About once a year I make a batch of the juice and keep it in the fridge, just for salads.
