Soft, buttery and delicious!  I didn't use the macadamia nuts, so I added an extra half-cup each of cranberries and white chocolate chips.  Also, I thought the cookies were too small when made with a rounded teaspoon.  There just weren't enough morsels in every bite, so I made them bigger and cooked them around 14 - 15 minutes.  Perfection!

This is one of my all time favorite cookie recipes.  Every time I make them, they disappear!
I did find however that they take more like 15 minutes to bake.

5+++! Absolutely heavenly! I was looking for a macadamia nut recipe other than the normal cookies I bake. This one is a true winner. Not only do these look good, they are soft and taste buttery rich. I followed the recipe to a "T". The batter is easy to mix up and I ended up with about 46 cookies. Baking time is approximate and the cookies will sink slightly once removed from the oven to cool, just as submitter states. I love the combination of the buttery, tart, sweet and chocolate all mixed up in one. In every bite I can taste the tart cranberries and bits of chocolate chip morsels. And I especially love the macadamia nut crunch and texture it gives the cookies. The sugar adds a nice balance of sweetness, not overly sweet. These are a delicious delicacy! I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe. These cookies are so delectable and pleasing and I think these could be baked for special occassions or holiday's.

I took this cookie to several christmas cookie exchanges and each time received many,many compliments.  Nice Christmas cookie since the cranberries add a nice holiday color. Very buttery and delicious!

When I sampled the dough before cooking, I felt something was lacking.  I added about 1 cup of fruit punch to the recipe to moisten the dough and add a kick.  My family, friends and I were very pleased with the results after that little edition.

Wow!!  These are the best white chocolate macadamia nut cookies i have ever made.. they're really good with the cranberries but i think they'd be awesome without them too.. in fact, i am tossing out all my other white choc mac cookie recipes and from now on, this will be my ONE recipe.. family says its one of the best cookies i've ever made.. and i've made a LOT of cookies..  i followed the recipe precisely and i flattened my cookies a bit before baking.. they turned out to be beautiful as well as delicious.. thanks for a great recipe!

These cookies are the bomb! I did do a few things different though. I didn't have any macadamia nuts, so I used pecans and I used orange extract and about 1 tsp grated orange rind in place of the vanilla.

VERY puffy cookies, and as per other reviewer's, definitely on the "cakie" side.  Mine did not deflate when cooling as the recipe submitter states, the only change I made was to sub un-salted, chopped cashews in place of the macadamia nuts as I was all out.  Someone suggested making these into bars - heck of an idea, have half the dough left and may do just that.  Otherwise, the taste is very good, not too sweet - OH! and I cut back on the sugar too, used 1/2 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugars.  I don't like cookies that make my teeth scream :)

Delicious!! I cut back on the white sugar and replaced half the butter with applesauce. The second time I replaced the macadamias with almonds and 1/3 of the flour with oats. Absolutely to die for, especially if you dip the bottoms in dark chocolate. Mmmmm

Delicious!  I used parchment paper lined cookie sheets and chilled my dough for about an hour before rolling into small balls. Perfect for your Christmas cookie tray.   I think the macadamia nuts really work well in this recipe but they are quite pricey.  You could try subbing cashews or walnuts and I think either would work well.

I found these to be way too sweet, but I love the white chocolate/cranberry/macademia combo. I think next time I'll just use my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe and sub the chocolate chips for this combo. And I might use extra cranberry and macademias and go lighter on the white chocolate to reduce the sweetness too. Great idea, though!

Made these using dried cherries. Didn't have enough macadamia nuts so tossed in some toasted pecans.  We couldn't stay away from them.  Testing various new recipes to include as holiday gifts to neighbors.  I doubt if these will leave the house!  Excellent cookie and totally out of this world delicious!

My cookies look just like the picture! Wonderful! Changes I made are: 1/2 c sugar, 1-1/4 c brown sugar, 2 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp almond extract, toasted the macadamia nuts then chopped, refrigerated dough for about 1 hr before dropping large Tbsps of dough on cookie sheet, bake for 14-15 min.  Honestly, I didn't think they would be this good, but was I wrong!!

This was exactly what I was looking for! This is my favorite combination in a cookie and these were so delicious. The only change I made was to add more cranberries and white chocolate chips, probably about 1/2 C of each but you can estimate to your liking.

My new favorite holiday cookie! I increased the recipe by half, omitting the nuts, using a full 12 oz bag of white chocolate chips, and a 6 oz bag of dried cranberries. Subbed in Smart Balance 50/50 Butter Blend sticks for the butter. Mine turned out perfect after 9 1/2 minutes (or the full 10 min. if you chill the dough). Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing! UPDATE: You can use dark brown sugar and they'll be just as tasty, but they won't be  as pretty.

Fantastic!  I didn't change a thing.  I did half the recipe since I only had 1-1/2 cups of flour, and then I heated up plain white chocolate chips in the microwave and drizzle them over the cookies after they came out of the oven.  I brought them to work for Valentine's Day and I got rave reviews; one coworker also asked for the recipe!

Absolutely the BEST tasting cookie I have EVER eaten!  Buttery cookie base, sweet white chocolate, salty macadamia nuts, chewy/tart cranberries - a PERFECT combination!  Followed recipe exactly, except made a little larger.  Baked for about 11-12 minutes and took out just before they started to turn golden.  They kept shape and were perfectly moist and chewy!  You will be the hero of all when you make these!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

These cookies are wonderful!  Very easy to make too.  My boyfriend said they were so good they made his knees buckle!  They also make a lot of cookies.  I was able to make 50 decent sized cookies.

Absolutely loved this recipe. Found the Macadamia nuts at Target and should have bought bulk at BJs because everyone wants more! I followed the recipe as followed but left the cookies in a while longer. Came out wonderful and soft but not soft enough to break to pieces. I will be using this recipe at all my get togethers. Thanks!

This is one delicious little cookie!  Very light, buttery, and just sweet enough.  I made these for our annual family cookie exchange and they were a hit!  I ended up giving the recipe out.  I have to say I had a heck of a time finding macadamia nuts.  They are a wonderful addition to this recipe but the dough is so good you could add anything to it and it would be yummy.  My new favorite cookie!

My family proclaimed these as the BEST cookies I ever made! However, I should have taken them out EXACTLY when the recipe stated.  I thought they weren't done, so I left them in 5 minutes longer.  Although they were GREAT, they didn't turn out as chewy as they should have. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

GLUTEN FREE variation: Substitute 1 c tapioca flour, 1 c chickpea flour, 1 c brown rice flour, and 3 tsps xantham gum for the 3 cups all-purpose flour.  This was a great cookie! The only thing I did different (besides converting to GF) was to use broken pieces of pecans instead of the macadamia nuts. DELICIOUS! And very easy. I'll have to put this up amongst my top cookie favorites. Mmmm...

Yummy! I halved the recipe, but somehow ended up adding the full amount of white chocolate, so they were quite chunky! So good though. I used egg replacer powder because I was making these for some of my family that don't eat eggs and they turned out great. Thanks!!

These cookies were fairly easy to prepare and came out moist and delicious.  I added slightly more vanilla baking chips than the recipe called for.  There must be something strange going on because it was difficult to find macadamia nuts at the grocery stores here unless they were chocolate covered .  I did find them at Walgreen's of all places.

My favorite cookie for XMAS 2011.  I used cashews instead of macadamia and a bit less white sugar.  Perfectly tasty and everyone raved about them.

Delicious! My husband said they taste like the Pepperidge Farm Sausalito cookies, but with cranberries.  You could also do these without the craisins to make some amazing white chocolate macadamia nut cookies.  Yummm!

What a great cookie recipe!! Made as directed and loved it! I did use white bakers chocolate and cut it up it because I don't like the white chips, they are all oil and no cocoa butter. But that was not really a variation of the recipe, just preference!!

I love this recipe! I left out the macadamia nuts and added more of the white chocolate chips and cranberries. I also added the zest of one orange and then about 1-2 tablespoons of the freshly squeezed orange juice to give it a little extra somethin'. I made them a little bigger than the recipe suggested and baked them for 13-14 minutes. They turned out great and were a big hit!!!

Don't know if I measured something wrong, but these came out puffy and crumbly.  After they had cooled, tried one again and was very dry and tasted of baking soda.  Sounds like a great recipe so probably was user error.  I live at a higher altitude and that has affected recipes before.

Yummy! Based on other reviewers and my personal preferance for a denser cookie, I added 1 cup of oatmeal that I had put thru the blender so that is like flour. Also added some OJ, orange zest and more craisens and vanilla baking chips, omitting the macadamia nuts.  They are very pretty and very tasty!

Great recipe.  I tried four different ways to "drop" them -teaspoon, teaspoon flattened, cookie scoop and cookie scoop flattened.  Cookie scoop (the medium one from Pampered Chef) won.  Biggest cookie with greatest texture.  Baked it for approximately 14 minutes on convection bake.

A very good recipe. I made it just as it is, and in the future will add in more cranberries, as others have suggested. The recipe overall is quite mild, which is nice - as many white chocolate/macadamica/cranberry cookies are overly sweet. More cranberries, however, would give it just that slightly sour/sweet kick to make these out of this world.

I like the concept of these cookies but was disappointed in the result.  They came out very cakey and didn't have the cranberry flavor I expected.  After these flopped I tried using my mother's chocolate chip cookie dough and loading it up with white chocolate, macadamia nuts and fresh cranberries.  Yum!

Just wonderful!  Taste is perfect.  I thought they were a little 'thick' so I slightly flattened the doughball with the bottom of a cup.

This recipe is just ok.  It was a good cookie, but the batter was too sweet and with the vanilla chips it was just too much for me.  If you're looking for a really sweet cakey cookie this is for you, but if you're looking for a moist soft chewy cookie, continue your search.

These cookies were easy to make and had great flavor. I used salted macadamia nuts, and they had a sweet-salty taste, which I liked.

this receipe is great --- i took it took work along with my oatmeal cookies and these cranberry ones were gone in a flash --- the guys couldn't get enough of them. Several of the men even asked me for the recipe.
When I got home my kids were upset because I took them to work - they wanted more of them.

These are the first cookies I've tried to make and all I got were raves from everyone who had one.  I'm already booked to make them again for Christmas!  I do most of the cooking as my wife still works and every recipe I've tried has been really good, they've made me a legend in my family!  Thank you All Recipes for making my culinary endeavors so very yummy!

I recently made these for coworker Xmas presents and got rave reviews. Truly, I almost didn't want to give them all away! Because of the price of macadamia nuts, I only included half a cup and put in more cranberries. I also used dark brown sugar instead of light--which usually means a chewier cookie. It certainly did in this case.

I've made these cookies 3 times now. People rave about how delicious these cookies are and at least one person asks for the recipe every time I make them. I have made them with a variety of nuts each time including walnuts and pecans as macadamia nuts are very expensive. The cookies have enough flavor and yummy umph without the nuts if one desired to omit the nuts. I do make them bigger and roll them into tablespoon size balls after chilling the dough--bake 13-14 minutes.

These were a hit in my house.  I made a batch with the macadamias and without (only because we have a child with a nut allergy) - both ways are phenomenal.  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect.They are like clouds. So chewy and delish. Bake them just until set as the recipe states-no need to brown them (a little brown around the edges is ok.) We doubled the size of these to make huge cookies, pressing them down before baking because they don't spread much. Make sure you have a good cookie sheet (air pocketed) or other high quality brand.

Made these for Christmas for my best friend who said these were his favorite, but I didn't know they were supposed to be without the Cranberries. When he tried them, he said they were now his new favorite cookie. So easy to make. :)

OMG these are fantastic!!! So rich and great dunked in a cup of coffee after a meal!  Have made them twice, the second time I used half milk chocolate chips and half white.  I think next time I will add a little orange zest as I love orange and cranberry together.

I thought these cookies were just ok.  I added pecans instead of macadamia nuts because that is what I had.  I also added more white chips and about a cup of oats to give it some extra texture.  They were good but kind of bland.  They need something else, maybe some cinnamon.

These turned out wonderfully! Easy, quick and tasty! I didn't chop the macadamia nuts because I like my cookies chunky, but I think they were too bulky for the cookies. Next time I'll chop them and they'll be perfect!

Mmmmmm, these are so good!  I had a heck of a time finding macadamia nuts, and when I did, it was a 3 oz. pkg. for $5, so I bought a pound of pistachios instead.  Their greenish hue looked very pretty with the cranberries!  Not the same crunch as a macadamia, but was a fine substitute.  I made these today for a cookie swap.  Doubled the recipie thinking I would get 6 dozen, but got more like 9 dozen!  This was a good thing, because they are very addictive!  My hubby commented several times how good he thought they were!  I dusted some with powdered sugar and the rest got a drizzle of semi-sweet chocolate!  They were as pretty as they were delicious!  I found the batter to be very stiff when I doubled it and it certainly gave my Kitchen Aid mixer a good work out!  If I double it next time, I may do two seperate batches.  I also would like to try the cocoa powder version, I bet these would be killer in chocolate with a white chocolate drizzle!  Overall a great cookie recipie, I highly recommend giving them a try!  :-)

Loved this cookies. I didn't have macadamia nuts so i didn't add them. I doubled the recipe and used half butter and half maragarine. the dough came out perfect and everyone at the fire station loved them.

I just made these for my New Years party tomorrow.  I followed the recipe as given.  I loved the taste of the salted macadamia nuts along with the sweet vanilla chips.  I followed the fancy directions at the end of the recipe and drizzled dark chocolate over the cookies after they cooled for a bit.  I of course had to sample them.  MAJOR YUM!!

The whole recipe was wonderful except it was a little dry. After being out of the oven for a time, it seems to settle and get stiff. The flavors were great and scrumptious. My mother loves cranberries and food with texture so this was perfect for her. I'd adjust to your tastes.

I made these to take to my family for our Christmas trip to the cabin and they were gone SO fast! A definite keeper and new favorite cookie.  I used cashews in place of the macadamia nuts and used white chocolate chips.

I think these cookies are VERY good. I brought them to work for the holiday's and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe exactly, not changing a single thing. Personally, I think you could cut back on the sugar a bit, as they are a bit on the sweet side.

These are really yummy but I'm surprised to hear that no one else seems to feel they're a little dry. Next time, I'll up the butter and cut the flour.

Very good cookie dough that you can use to add extras to suite your taste. Next time I am going to try it with the white baking chips, chopped blanched almonds, and white raisins -or chopped candied cherries for Christmas color. Wonderful the way it is though.

These are really delicious!!  The dough is quite stiff, so you have to mix the dry ingredients in by hand, but it handles really well, and you don't need to chill it before baking.  I used more white chocolate chips, macadamia nuts, and cranberries.  I chopped the cranberries in the food processor, which made the flavor more evenly distributed throughout the cookies.  I also chopped the macadamia nuts in the food processor.  It was really important to bake them just until set, as they stayed softer that way.  Mine took more like 15 minutes, though, so I guess everyone will have to adjust the baking times to their own oven.  I will put this recipe in with my best for the holidays.

These had good flavor, but were a little too cake-like texture for me.  I like my cookies with a little firmness to them as opposed to soft like a cake or brownie.  They would probably be better as a bar.  The combination of flavors is really nice.

"Holy Favorite Cookie" is what my 9 yr old said!  Pretty much sums it up, don't you think?  haha  I also had to bake 13 minutes so they weren't goopy in the middle and I dusted LIGHTLY with powdered sugar for looks.  They turned out absolutely PERFECT!  Festive looking too!  Five stars in this house is not easy to come by!!!

We loved these!!  I don't like nuts, so I omitted them, and used an extra 1/2 cup each of dried cranberries and white chips.  Everything else I did the way the recipe says to do.  What a great change instead of regular chocolate chip cookies.  I will make these again and again.

Everything is great about this cookie except that with the given amount of white chocolate chips it makes the cookie too sweet (at least for me and my family). So I cut the chips back to 1/2 cup and add 1 1/2 cups of the macadamia nuts and dried cranberries, then you have perfection.

I fancy myself quite the cookie lady and this is one of my old reliable cookies!  Folks call them my New England cookies and I get emails from my old boss several states away asking when I will send him some!  The only thing I do differently is LOAD UP the chips and cranberries.  I use a whole bag of each!  The nuts I play around with every time!  I have actually never used macadamia in these!  Walnuts or pecans usually and I probably use more than I need to in the nut department too.  SO yummy!

Very good addition to my Christmas treat boxes!  I omitted the macadamia nuts because I didn't have any on hand, and added the zest and juice of one orange.  Delicious cookie!

OMG!  If I could give these cookies 10 stars I would!  I didn't change a thing.  They are THE best cookies I've ever made and believe me, I've made my share of cookies!  They set up beautifully, are chewy and bursting with flavor.  I just took the last batch out of the oven and I'm afraid I'll eat too many they are soooo good.  The batter is so great that I think you could use this basic batter and add lots of variations to create different flavor profiles.  Definitely will be making these again and again.

Yum!  This recipe was great.  I made two little changes....left the nuts out, and used dried cherries instead of the cranberries.  These went FAST!

I gave an assortment of homemade cookies to my daughter and her family for Christmas.  These cookies rated highest and received the most compliments among the varieties I made. They were easy to make, and yummy to eat. I will certainly be making them again. P.S. no substitutes, I stuck to the recipe. Also I premeasured everything for the recipes ahead of time, put them in storage containers, and labelled them according to the recipe. I taped the recipes to my upper kitchen cupboard doors, and set the ingreds. on the counter below them, respectively. The day I baked, everything was ready to go. Just mix and bake! Wet ingreds. were premeasured and labelled for refrigeration until needed as well.

These were perfect. For those having trouble with dry dough, try using a much larger egg because even at over 7500 feet, where I live, this came out perfectly as written. My family and a couple guests (did include 3 teenagers) ate the entire batch in one afternoon.  I am thinking of subbing artificial sweetener for part of the sugar for my diabetic parents, adding more nuts and fruit just to increase the protein and nutrition but these are not necessary changes.  The other change I will have to make for next time is to double or triple the batch!

These cookies are GREAT! I don't eat chocolate so I was looking for an alternative to the regular chocolate chip cookie.  The base recipe can be combined with the cranberries, white chocolate, and macademia nut OR simply chocolate chips.  My husband gets what he wants and I get what I want. 

Also, the second time I made this recipe was with margarine instead of butter.  Don't do it! The texture is not as smooth and the flavor wasn't as rich.  Go for the real thing, you'll be glad you did!

Very good cookie, I used hazelnuts instead of macadamias and it worked well. I will cut back on the amount of cranberries next time I make them.

These are delicious, decadent, and will only be given to my favorite people at Christmas! I had a cookie similar to this at Subway, called Birthday cookies, and vowed to find a close recipe. I followed this recipe exactly. My daughter said these were even better than Subway's. A little pricey to make but well worth it.

I have the hardest time making a soft cookie, such a simple task youd think, lol. Well, these turned out perfect! I didnt add macadamia nuts since we have a nut/peanut allergy in the home so I avoid all things related, but I did use cranberries and white chocolate chunks. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these today as a pre-Christmas trial cookie.  It has definitly made the list!  Very good as is; I may decrease the flour a bit next time to make them a little less crumbly to scoop.  Also, I may alter the ratio of sugars: I think more brown sugary taste might be good, too.

I mistakenly rated another recipe for this one.  Haven't made that recipe as yet...cannot change that but this is the recipe I meant to rate....probably one of the best cookie recipes I've made.  Had company and I've never seen a cookie jar empty so fast.  Followed recipe - no changes! Thanks, Debby, for posting!

Loved this recipe, and will add it to my "Best macadamia Nut Recipes" blog over at Squidoo! I Used fresh Hawaii macadamia nuts for this recipe. I get mine from www.maunakeagold.com. In my opinion, Hawaii produces the best Mac Nuts!

These cookies were wonderful. First time I followed the recipe but found it alittle to cakey and tiny bit bland. So the second time I did 1/2 cup less flour and melted some of the white chocolate chips to add a little icing to the top and everyone LOVED them.

This recipe is awesome! These cookies went over so well and they melt in your mouth. I didn't have light brown sugar so I used dark brown and they we great. I will be sticking to that from now on. I didn't change anything. I did use a little extra cranberries since there were only a few left and that is my favorite part. I use this recipe over and over again and would recommend it to anyone. Happy baking :)

Excellent!  I had to cook for 12-14 minutes though, definitely not done at 10 minutes.

OMG these were terrific. Thought that I might have to do CPR on my husband though after sending him for the macadamia nuts! He said that he sure hoped that these weren't for any cookie exchange!! They weren't!

The perfect cookie! Although I did cook it for 15 minutes instead of ten absolutely the right thing to do! Thanks for sharing! It was a hit with friends, family, administrators, and random people for the last day of school!

I used pecans rather than macadamias.  These are pretty cokies that will look good on my Christmas cookie plates.  I liked the soft, puffy nature of these and will use the dough recipie with semi-sweet chocolate chips and nuts in the future.

Great cookies, moist and delicious.... I made no changes the only thing I did was split the dough in half, omitted cranberries in one half, some family members not to fond of cranberries!

This recipe is nice. I didn't have macadamia nuts so I used hazel nuts instead. I made half the batch without nuts for my cousin who's allergic to them and it worked out well. When I get my hands on macadamias I'm going to make it again.

I made these today for my cookie exchange.  These are excellent!!  Love the taste and the combination of flavors.  I followed the recipe exactly, baked them at exactly 10 minutes and they came out perfect.  Make sure to use parchment paper.  I got about 55 out of the batch.  Yummy!!!!!!!!!

I have been making a version of this cookie for years. I do not add the macadamia nuts. Substitute Brandy for the Vanilla, makes all the difference in the world. You can also sub dried cherries, chocolate chips, and Amaretto instead of vanilla. Both of these varieties never stay around for long!!!

Fabulous. The only thing I did differently was to use cashews instead of macadamia nuts.They were the only nuts I had on hand. They worked beautifully. Yummy! Great recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I did not change a thing and they were perfect. WHEN I make them again, I'll probably use 1/2 cup of the white chocolate chips and melt the other half-cup to drizzle on top after they come out of the oven. These are my NEW favorite cookies! Thank you so much for the recipe!

These little delights just came out of my oven. I substituted a cherry/blueberry/cranberry blend for the cranberries and pecans for the macadamia nuts, as that is what I had on hand. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This is a wonderful cookie. We have since changed the nuts to cashews, the macadamias plus the butter seemed to make them a little greasy. But either way delicious.

Pretty easy to whip up in the morning first thing. I wanted to use up the last of my white flour/white sugar and this was the way to do it. I didn't have macadamia nuts, so I just added more white chocolate chips and Craisins. I took another reviewer's advice and made the cookies a little bigger than I normally would. These ones are full of add-in's so the bigger, the better. They smell amazing and I bet they'll taste even better.

This cookie bakes so nicely. You get a round, moist cookie. I think it needs some more white chips though. So next time I will add 1/4-1/2 c more.

I was disappointed by these cookies. They weren't very sweet, the cranberry taste was all but lost, and they just had a "health cookie" taste to me. I think I'd try it again, but I'd tweak a few things.

10 stars I would gladly give to this recipe, one of the best I've ever tried (and I've had my share of cookie recipes, believe me!). They are perfection, and the basic is so amazing that you could easily work with it adding this and that, or NOT adding, we didn't put any macadamia, for instance, and went heavily with cranberries. My 5-years-old loved to form the little balls, only we made them bigger than indicated, and both the kids were very pleased with the result.

I've always wanted to find a white chocolate cookie that tastes like it came from a gourmet bakery and this is it!  I think these would be fabulous with or without the cranberries.  The butter and full tablespoon of vanilla are musts for creating the perfect flavor and texture in this delicious cookie recipe!

These were wonderful!!! I made them without the nuts, I just added a few extra chips and cranberries.  I may try later with pecans because Macadamia nuts are so expensive. My family loved them and so did the person I swapped cookies with.  This will probably be a recipe that I make every Christmas!! Ü

I used orange-infused cranberries and added a little orange zest other than that made according to the recipe. So yummy and everyone loved them.

Have made the original recipe numerous  times. Always turned out delicious. This time I wanted to had a twist. So I added 1 teaspoon of orange zest. Next time I want to try different nuts based on reviews. A cup of macadamia nuts $4 walmart. People loved it.

Excellent cookie recipe. I made recipe as is, then divided the dough in half and added dark Chocolate chip to the other half. That way people that don't care for chocolate have their cookies and chocoholics can indulge as well!

This recipe won a me a cookie bake-off at work! I have made these several times;  they are always a hit and turn out perfect every time. I think this is the best dough recipe I've ever come across -- they bake up so perfectly every time and are never flat. I make  just as written and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the great recipe!

The video you showed is not for the White Chocolate Macadamia Cranberry Cookies but for the Magic Lemon Pie.  There must have been a mistake somewhere.  I would really love to watch the video for the White Chocolate Macadamia Cranberry Cookies.  Thanks.

This is a fabulous and easy recipe. I followed it with only a minor adjustment, per one reviewer. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 & 1/4 cups brown sugar. Otherwise, I followed it exactly. It made a lot more than it says - I used a tablespoon scoop and it made about 5 dozen cookies (two-bite size). Also, I did find they needed more like 14-15 min, rather than the 12 mentioned. Great recipe and got rave reviews from all my family and friends!!

These cookies are absolutely amazing. I made them for the first time around Christmas and they were a huge hit with my co-workers and everyone who I gifted cookies to. I have made them several time since. Definitely a new favorite.

I'm always looking for at least one new cookie recipe to add to my Christmas cookie collection each year. I'm so glad I found and tried this recipe.  While I don't think they have much flavor that has nothing to do with the recipe itself. To me, white chocolate chips, macadamia nuts and dried cranberries don't have a lot of flavor. Then again, it could be my tastebuds. These cookies stay soft and chewy  with slightly crispy edges. I have looked for the ultimate chocolate chip recipe for years. After the holidays, I'm going to try using this base and add chocolate chips and walnuts. Trust me, you can't go wrong with this recipe!

I did not have all the correct ingredients and they came out awesome anyway. I was short almost a half a cup of butter and used shortening as a substitute even though the recipe says not to. I have always used half butter, half shortening in my cookie recipes and knew they would be fine. I only had dark brown sugar instead of light brown and knew that wouldn't cause a problem either. A keeper for sure.

Delic. Only difference is I used white chocolate chips...

Does anybody know if the cookies will freeze well? Just so I can make a batch and hide them from the kids so they're ready for guests at xmas...

I followed the recipe as it is written and now it is my family's favorite cookie! So delicious. I overflowed my 1/2 cup of Macadamia nuts just because they are my favorite nut - Yummy. Highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe is good. I agree that it might be a little too sweet given the chips are very sweet on their own. Next time, I will definitely lower the amount of sugar and probably add a bit more cranberries to balance the sweetness. Will definitely make them again.

couldn't find vanilla chips so I replaced with Greek yoghurt chips. They seemed under cooked so I added 3 min. to cook time . Kids really enjoyed them but they don't know I froze half the cookie dough.

This is the only cookie recipe I now use. I have made mine with white chocolate chips and dried  cranberries. It s a light airy cookie and the only thing I can think of that makes this the best recipe is the dissolving of the baking soda in hot water prior to adding to mixture.  I have used nuts, raisins, any flavor of chips. It's a great recipe.

Deliciously addictive! Definitely make again -- I just wish macadamia nuts weren't so expensive, even in bulk.  My favorite cookies with or without the cranberries but I can't make them often because of the cost of my favorite nuts!  Couldn't find real white chocolate chips so chopped up a couple of Ghiradelli bars which just elevates the whole cookie because, I mean GHIRADELLI--best chocolate ever!

These are amazing!! I have never made the cranberry ones, I just made macadamia nut with white chocolate chips, regular chocolate chip cookies, and then for Easter, I made them with chocolate chips and spring colored milk chocolate M&M's. They're so delicious, fluffy and soft! The softness sticks for well over a week, especially if you keep them in a tightly sealed cookie jar (or even a zip lock bag). These things are dangerous in our house! lol!

It turned out to be more like a scone rather than a cookie. I did it with cranberry, pumpkin seed and white chocolate chips. It is easy to make, soft and delicious!

I made these exactly as the recipe states. I used gfJules cup-for-cup gluten-free flour, and they are delicious. Extended family loved them, too.

I was really  looking forward to these cookies but  was really not happy. I followed the recipe exactly but was very disappointed in the results. This is the first time I ever gave a bad review to a recipe, and I really hate to do it. But, the cookies ended up being very dry. I really think 3 cups of flour is too much I should have followed my instincts and cut it back. I don't understand how it got  rated so high as is.

made these cookies twice. Most recently for my Air Force son and three of his buddies.  Got rave reviews: "best cookies I've ever had." Told my son I would make a big batch to send him so he could share with his buddies. His response? "Share them??"  I always add a little extra nuts, chips and craisins... You won't be disappointed with these cookies!!

These are favorites in my house, and because macadamias grow here in Guatemala, they are inexpensive (about $2 lb.) so I can make them often.  Today  I tried them using half butter and half Coconut Oil (extra virgin).  The smell is amazing.   Like others mentioned, I toast the nuts in a hot pan for a few minutes so they are crisp and tender, and so much better than when raw.  The addition of coconut oil gives a slightly different, but very nice, flavor and the cookies are a bit drier than with all butter.

Followed the recipe 100% and they're perfect, really chewy with a great flavor. I overcooked one batch by about 3 minutes and they turned out super dry and gross, though, so KEEP AN EYE ON THEM at the end of their bake time. As long as you don't screw up the baking time, these are some of the best cookies I've ever made (and so easy)!

These were so good! This was the first time that I made these and did so because I was looking for something different than the usual chocolate chip or snickerdoodles. My husband suggested these and I'm glad that he did. I followed this recipe exactly and had no issues. My family loved these so I printed out the recipe to add to my collection. These will definitely be made again.

Tasty, buttery, with a bit of a tang from the cranberries, these are just delicious!  This was my first time using macadamia nuts in a recipe and they really added a lot of different flavor from the typical walnuts and pecans.  Since I baked these only for my husband and myself, I halved the recipe and it still made nearly 30 cookies.  The dough becomes stiff with the addition of the last bit of flour, cranberries, nuts, and chips, so hand mixing works far better than a mixer at that point.  I baked them close to 10 minutes  BUT after the 8 minute mark they brown quickly so watch them closely.  One key for success in baking these cookies, in my opinion, is creating equal-sized "drops."  Some of mine were larger than others and in order for the larger ones to bake through, the smaller ones got a little crispy on the edges.  All in all these are delicious and I will definitely make them again.

These are delicious and buttery, but also look beautiful like the gourmet cookies at coffee shops.  I did bake them for 15 minutes, instead of 10, which surprised me since my oven runs hot.

I tried this recipe and used about 2/3 of a cup for sugar and it turned out great! I added about a 1/4 cup of milk as well since i found the mixture to be a little too crumbly to work with.

The best cookies ever! I use a bag of fresh cranberries, instead of the dried ones. Also, I just use the one cup of brown sugar, omitting the white sugar. It is plenty sweet for me and mine that way!

These are delicious! And boy---does this recipe make a good lot of them. I made these for Christmas and my family really enjoyed them. The cranberries had the perfect spark of color. The only thing I would do differently is to add more cranberries. I didn't have quite enough and that's the sort of thing a person would notice in a cookie---where are all the cranberries in this one?! Anyway, yum!! Just increase cranberries by about 1/4 C.

Used 1/2 King Arthur un bleached white whole wheat flour and 1/2 all pulse flour, added 2-3 tablespoons flaxseeds, and substituted half the butter with Smart Balance Original to cut back on the saturated fat and they turned out great. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

wonderful cookies.  super easy and hard to mess up, which is sometimes good for me.  Used chopped almonds instead of macadamia nuts because it was what I had but otherwise made as is.

These cookies are really sweet but I do like them. However, they don't spread a lot so you have a small squat cookie. The first sheet I used the small cookie scoop as listed and got the squat cookie. I flattened them on the rest of the sheets with the back of a cup, which helps them spread a little better but it made a crispier cookie. I want a big beauty that is also crunchy on the edges and soft in the middle. For those requirments this recipe isn't quite right. Even if I had used a bigger scoop I feel like it would have been the same scenario.  Still tasty though for sure.

Absolutely delicious. Good hearty chewy cookie!  I made them for my son's Biathlon team and the athletic boys devoured them, for the coaches were pleased at least there was nuts and cranberries in them - ha!

These were ok for us. I made them as part of my Christmas baking.  I don't know if Ibwould make them for Christmas again.  I would possibly make as an "everyday" cookie.

I made it as per the recipe but with pecans since I didn't have macadamia nuts on hand. Very tasty and a bit cakey as some have mentioned. I was worried about a whole Tbsp of vanilla extract but went ahead since I didn't see any mention of a problem - and it is just fine, I have pure vanilla extract from Mexico. 
Next time I think I'll try using oats and cutting back on flour, as well as more brown sugar - less white.

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have macadamia nuts so I used walnuts and I used dark chocolate chips as I love dark chocolate.  Well everyone raved about these cookies last year.  My girlfriend and my sister keep asking when I am making then again this year!   Another thing is don't over bake.

Amazing. I rolled & froze the dough before baking so they'd come out thicker than regular flat chocolate chip cookies. Mixing was easy and by rolling all the dough and freezing it, baking was even easy. This recipe has become a must-have for Christmas at my house.

Another review suggested 1/2 cp white sugar, 3/4 cp brown sugar and this is perfect for our family.  I cut the salt in half and didn't use the dried cranberries.

These were tasty enough, but I found the dough very dry and hard to work with - very crumbly.  If I make them again, I would chop up the cranberries a bit, which might help everything stick together more.  Not sure I would make again - though I like the combo of the white choc, cranberries and nuts.

These looked and tasted like something I would get at a gourmet cookie shop! I added some shaved dark chocolate, and used cherry flavored dried cranberries. Definitely a recipe I will make again and again.

These are sooo good. I made them for Christmas and my family couldn't get enough. Better than plain old chocolate chip cookies.

Way too sweet. The cranberries and macadamia worked fine,but whenever I had a bite that contained a white chocoate chip, it was just too sweet.  I would suggest just using a good oatmeal cookie recipe and instead of using raisins/pecans, use cranberries/macadamia instead. I would not recommend the chips at all!!

We're not big cranberry fans in this family. I used dried cherries instead. It was just the right amount of tart and sweet. Thanks for the recipe Debby! -- SMAC

Wow, these are divine! The best cookies I have ever tasted, I'm hooked. They are very similar to the cookies that I'm rather partial to from Subway. I haven't heard of vanilla baking chips, so I used a 225g bar of Whittakers white chocolate chopped into small chunks, perfect! And I made them bigger than suggested, I got 25 cookies. Brilliant recipe!

I have to say this recipe rocks! The only thing that I did different was not adding the nuts..my husband hates nuts! I made these cookies for our annual Christmas Eve party last year and will be making them this weekend for an annual Back to School Deaf event! Great recipe!

This is very good. A nice chewy cookie.  The cranberries add a nice amount of "tart" to the sweet.   I forgot to buy macadamia nuts and these were just fine without them!

Great cookies.  Soft and moist and buttery.  I was convinced I had an entire costco bag of dried cranberries, but then couldn't find them when I was baking these, so my cookies went without.  They are still great, and honestly so full of nuts and chips I think they may have been overpowered by even more additions.

This one is a winner! Excellent cookie: flavor,texture too. They keep at least 3 days. Makes at least 52 cookies. I recommend taking them out between 9-10 minutes before the edges brown and they should keep longer. Next time I would double the cranberries and reduce the chips for more tartness. I liked Carina's idea to add the juice/zest of an orange

Oh my gosh! These were absolutely fantastic. I took some to my mom's work to sell, and once they were out, everyone just wanted more, more, more! I usually don't prefer white chocolate, but it was perfected by the cranberries and macadamia nuts. I wouldn't change anything. I will definately make these again.

These cookies were wonderful!  I didn't have macadamia nuts so I used toasted almond slices.  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla extract. My children and husband gobbled them up.  This is now my new favorite cookie recipe!! Thank You!

I hold a Christmas Cookie exchange and went looking for a cookie to make for 2008.  I found this cookie and so glad I did.  It's a keeper!  I submitted my own photo of what mine turned out like.  I called my girlfriend after the first batch was out of the oven and told her if they tasted anything like they smelled and looked they were going to be a hit, and they were with me when I tried one after they cooled enough to taste one!  I made them as directed maybe putting in a little more white chips than it called for, and cooked them for the 10 minutes they called for and they were perfectly done!  One batch for me made 6 dozen and a couple extra but I made them about 2" big for the exchange.  If made bigger, they would have made less.  The recipe says one batch made 3 dozen.....those must have been BIG cookies!  

Thank you for this recipe I'm sure all the cookie exchange group will want a copy of it too!

Very soft and delicious cookies. I used Hazelnuts instead of Macadamia and they were still as good. I have made these several times for cookie exchanges and holiday gifts for friends. Each time they are eaten quickly and the compliments flowed. I do have to bake them for about 14-15 minutes to get them done but otherwise great recipe!
