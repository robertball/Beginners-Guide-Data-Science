This excellent recipe, this awesome dessert, has been remarkably neglected and apparently ignored for nearly six years and I'm amazed. This dessert is gorgeous. Delicious. And decadent.  Without question the piece de resistance of tonight's dinner. This is not difficult to make but does require a few extra steps and a couple of extra bowls but oh, boy, what a pay-off.  Creamy, velvety smooth, fluffy and light as a feather with just the right intensity of chocolate flavor.  I made half the recipe and it worked perfectly with a 7" springform pan.  I added two tablespoons of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to the one cup of whipping cream in that half recipe.  Curiously, according to the recipe a 12-oz. package of ladyfingers should have been used for a half recipe, yet the 3-oz. package of ladyfingers I had covered the bottom and sides of the pan exactly. (Come to think of it, I've never seen a 12-oz.  package of ladyfingers)  I plated this with a chocolate syrup drizzle, whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  I was proud and thrilled to serve this beautiful dessert tonight and hope that with this review (and my posted photos) others will be encouraged to try it too.

I love this recipe.  It was easy and very good.  However, the only reason why I am not giving it five stars is because, in just reading the ingredients, and in tasting as I went along, I thought it needed a little sugar in the whipping cream.  I added about 3 tablespoons of sugar and it had just enough sweetness to add a little oomph.  Also, I decorated it with fresh raspberries and cool whip which both offset the richness of the mousse.  This recipe will become a standard in my kitchen for those special occasions when you want something a little unique.  And it was so easy to make.  Thanks!

I love this recipe.  It's quick and easy, yet everybody that has a piece can't believe it's not time consuming.  My children help make it, and that also says a lot.  I've downloaded this several times because I keep wearing out the print!  I've mixed in different types of chcolate for a variation, and it always comes out great.

This was pretty good and fairly easy.  Everyone finished their cake, but I felt like something was missing.  Maybe a little sherry, or extra chocolate?  Maybe with chocolate cake?  I don't know, but it was good.

This is a very easy and tastey chocolate mousse.  I've made many chocolate mousses with the ladyfingers, but none were this easy.

I could not find ladyfingers any stores, so instead I used thin slices of pound cake.  I also added powdered sugar and a touch of vanilla when whipping the cream.

Served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

I am so happy to find this recipe.  It is very similar to one I had years ago and cannot seem to find.  I always added a bit of sugar to the whipped cream as one reviewer stated and also used fresh raspberries.  I love the combination of chocolate and raspberries! The only other difference I see is that I don not line the bottom of the springform pan with ladyfingers, just the sides and I freeze it for one hour and then refrigerate for 4!

Made this in combination with "Strawberry Chocolate Mousse Cake" recipe on this site. I took the strawberry edging, whip cream on top, strawberries on top, and the crushed Oreo (chocolate cookie) crust. This was the mousse filling. Man was it good! I didn't change the filling at all. Lots of people added sugar to the heavy cream, but with the strawberries, and whipped cream on top (to which I DID add sugar), it was fabulous. I made it in a 12 inch spring form pan, so I increased the ingredients by 50%. This was so good. My father who doesn't usually eat dessert said it was a 5 out of 5. Three of us had two slices. Really good with the strawberries. A light and fluffy mousse that isn't over powering with heaviness.

Wonderful recipe.
I though I messed up but the result was still good.
My mistake was to beat the heavy cream and the egg whites too much. It made them hard to integrate to the chocolate mixture. I'm sure the result would have been a lighter mousse had I not done that. It still turned out great though, so really it's a great recipe. Just be aware of that.
Also, I followed someone else's advice to refrigerate in the fridge and then the freezer, and I'm glad I did. It was very refreshing.
I did 4h in the fridge and 1h in the freezer; next time I'll try 30 min or 1h more in the freezer, I think it would be better.

So good! I added some powdered sugar and vanilla to the cream, and instead of using lady fingers I poured the mousse on top of a thin layer of yellow cake I had baked in a 9x12 pyrex. Turned out great.

I made this according to the directions except for the cookies. I couldn't find the ladyfingers so used shortbread cookies instead. My husband said this was 4 stars, I'd say 3 stars. If I made it again, I would try milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. Definitely serve with berries to soften the chocolate overload.

I should have cut the ladyfingers in half because the filling reached half the height of the cookies.

For those concerned about the safety of raw eggs, many stores sell cartons of pasteurized egg whites, which are both convenient and worry free.

first time making chocolate mousse. Taste was delightful! I  lost patience whipping the cream.. peaks weren't happening. I threw out the first batch of egg whites, second round was much better... folding everything together.. I know it was "loose" .... maybe next time I'll have better luck!

As an novice baker this recipe was a tough one for me.  I had never made my own "pudding" or "whip cream" before.  However, after making this recipe I think I should advance my title to intermediate baker, lol!  First, I followed the recipe for the filling exactly as written with the exception of making a cookie crust.  My family (including myself) LOVED the recipe!!  I just wished it would have come out fluffier (like one reviewers, "Naples", picture).  My mom said to get the fluffiness I need to make sure my bowl & beaters are cold when I make the  "whip cream".   I will definitely try this recipe again to see if I can get a light , airy mousse.   Either way I am very proud of myself because I made one heck of great pie!!!

This recipe is fantastic! My father used to make this exact recipe when I was young 30+ years ago and it tastes exactly as I remember.....pure heaven!I made the mousse following the recipe and added raspberries around the sides, shaved chocolate for the middle and drizzled a chocolate sauce thru the berries.  I will keep making this again and again. Delicious!

I cut the ladyfingers on one end (just enough to reach the height of the pan) and very lightly sprayed the pan with PAM. The ladyfingers were impossible to stand up perfectly, but it was done after about, I don't know...an hour!!! anyway, this tasted delicious. I too added powdered sugar and vanilla extract to the cream. I will not do the ladyfinger thing again, I'll tell you that much.
