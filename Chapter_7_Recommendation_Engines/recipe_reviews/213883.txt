I'm only rating the Malt Vinegar Tarragon Dip, as I did not make the fries. We really enjoyed this! I used this as a dip for 'Roasted Spicy Mustard Potatoes' from this site. I used light mayo and it was very good. I would totally make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was not our thing. The potatoes were great (used red potatoes instead of russets b/c I had to use them up), we wound up eating them with ketchup and bbq sauce instead. Not a fan of the dip though, I did sub sour cream for mayo but I don't think that would make a big impact on the overall taste. Grilled potato good dip bad...

This is a really great recipe for the dip! Watch the vinegar though, because it quickly goes from reducing to being burnt sludge on the bottom of the pan. I love mayonnaise, but next time I'll make it a little healthier--1 cup mayo and 1/2 cup fat free sour cream.

This was QUITE good, even using my substituted ingredients. Looking forward to trying the recipe as written, that HAS to be great.
