I was apprehensive that I could cook shrimp in 10 minutes on a sheet pan and it turn out well, but I was amazed at how EASY this was to do - not to mention delicious!! After eating out so often lately because of long hours at work, I was craving a home-cooked meal but didn't have the energy for too much prep or clean up. This satisfied all my needs AND I got to relax and enjoy a glass of wine while it was doing the brunt of the "cooking" - no active babysitting of the stovetop necessary. Talk about a winning weeknight meal. ;)

Very good!  The shrimp actually took about 12 minutes to cook through for me.  I coated the shrimp with the seasoning in a freezer bag and then added the veggies to coat as well before dumping on the sheet pan.  Delicious!

I cooked for 6 minutes and broiled for 2 minutes. Perfect! I added Mexican oregano, some coriander (from the cilantro plant). Served with cilantro, avocado and chopped tomato. To make clean up easy, line the cookie shet with foil. Put flour tortillas in foil in the oven while shrimp was cooking. Muy bueno!!

Amazing and soooo easy!! Perfect week night meal for working couple! I make this at least 2x per month or more. The only thing I do differently, is to put the shrimp on a separate small sheet pan, so that when they are done, you simply take them out and then turn the oven to broil for the remaining peppers/onions mixture.  We love this recipe and you will too!

This was not worth making in our opinion. First, the instructions are not specific. It tells you to lay the shrimp out in a single layer on the baking sheet, then add peppers, onion etc & mix with the shrimp. Well why put the shrimp in a single layer 1st, why not just mix it all together & then spread out evenly. The second thing that was strange is after it bakes with ingredients all mixed, your to take the shrimp off & broiled the peppers.  OK, but the shrimp is all mixed in & a pain to dig through everything. My third problem was you hardly tasted the fajita seasoning. Since we just made the Quick and Easy Shrimp Fajitas from this website we'll stick with that because you use a whole package of fajita or taco mix, & no messing trying to separate peppers, onions & shrimp.  You fry the peppers & onion then set aside & do the shrimp. This to me is much easier.  For those who want to mess around go for it, but I like quick & easy without fuss.

This is one of my family's favorite meals!  Super easy and delicious.  I have made it with both shrimp and chicken.  It makes the best chicken fajitas that I've ever had - moist and tender chicken every time.  I used chicken strips and marinated them in the olive oil and fajita seasoning mixture then baked with the peppers for about 20 minutes.  The shrimp took about 10-15 minutes to thoroughly cook.

These were so easy & delicious! I used a yellow onion, because it's what I had on hand. When I make them again, and I definitely will, I will sub a green bell pepper for either the yellow or red as the two together made them just a little sweet for my tastes.

I loved this recipe but I did change the cooking method.  I marinated the shrimp and veggies separately for about 4 hours, using more oil with homemade fajita seasoning.  Then I grilled the veggies on a foil covered sheet pan for 15 minutes, moved to the side and added the shrimp (discarded the extra marinade).  Served in lightly toasted corn tortillas with cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Delish!

These are SO good and so easy!! The cooking time for the shrimp is perfect. I broiled the vegetables a bit longer than stated, and added green bell pepper to the mix. We loved them and I'll make this recipe again soon!

I didn't have the fajita mix so I used a taco mix and it still turned out delicious.  I will make it again.

Easy to make. I did roast shrimp first,. removed from pan and then roasted veggies worked just fine. I also used two tablespoons of olive oil with Fajita seasoning. Yum!

Yummy! Replaced jalapenos with diced mild green chilis (two of our family are anti-jalapeno). drizzled olive oil over the veggies. Excellent!

This turned out great! Cooking the shrimp in the oven this way was new for me, but so glad to have tried it.

I placed the shrimp on one pan and the pepper mixture on another just to make it simpler to remove the shrimp from the oven separately from the peppers. It took about 13 minutes for the shrimp, and 17 minutes for the veggies, but I do have a very old oven. As with any recipe, just keep an eye on things and adjust for your conditions.

I also tossed in some Tajin to both the shrimp and the peppers after they were done cooking, just to add a little more flavor. Fajita seasoning mix packets are not all the same, and taste preferences vary, so that addition may not have been necessary for us with a different spice mixture. The fajita seasoning mix I used was Spice Hunter. It was good, but just needed a little livining up.

I will definitely be making this one again; thanks, Jen!

Incredibly stupid directions! Mix the shrimp with the peppers and roast. Then take out the shrimp (which are supposedly already mixed in with everything), set them aside and now return the peppers to the oven to further blacken the peppers. I have no doubt this ends up tasting delicious, but I can picture the inexperienced cook trying to carefully pick  out each shrimp so the peppers can go back in the oven!

Delicious!  I didn’t change a thing except I took another reviewer’s suggestion to cook the shrimp on a separate small sheet pan so I could remove quickly from the oven. Will definitely make often!

Incredibly, absolutely  "muy delicioso". I refer to myself as a "DP Texan", I can't afford to move back home & am stuck in the lovely hilly part of the land of Oz, Translation, the lovely hilly part of Kansas.  This recipe brings a little taste of home to my taste buds,  by all means people should at least try this. I will definitely make this frequently, at least twice a month though I may add a bit more spice to mine in the future. Thank you so very much in sharing this recipe.Very definitely worthy of more stars!

Make as written first, very good.  The next time you make it jazz it up any way you like.  There is no need to sort shrimp, just use two sheet pans.

Marinated the shrimp for a few hours with a homemade fajita seasoning found on Allrecipes.  Holy moly was this dish tasty and easy!  My hubby said it was the best shrimp he's ever had.

VERY easy recipe!  The only thing I would have changed is the fajita seasoning mix... Not the recipe's fault but I'm stuck with the same seasonings as my other fajita recipes which makes it all taste the same.  I'll keep looking for another brand for something different.

Made these for the Daytona 500 race and they were AWESOME . I did add mushrooms and home made fahita  seasoning and added it to the rice in my instapot then topped with some butter and salt. To wrap all this was wonderful and I did add mushrooms. This was as good as going out.  Thanks.

Finally, healthy Mexican food!  This recipe was delicious!  I followed the recipe closely except for the fact that instead of fajita seasoning I used Spiceologist  Chili Margarita and Smokey Honey Habanero rubs.  Since we like a bit of crunch to our shrimp, I did not separate the shrimp from the vegetables for the final broiling.

Easy and delicious! I suggest mixing the shrimp, oil, and seasoning together, then spreading it on *half* of the pan; then mix the vegetables into the remaining sauce in the bowl and spread on the other half of the pan. This way it's easier to remove the shrimp before broiling the vegetables in step 4.

Loved this so much! Great tasting as a meal or appetizer warm or room temperature it has so much flavor!
I needed to change it based on what I had. For four servings I used 1 and 1/2 pounds of shrimp, 1 Anaheim pepper, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1 red onion.
Made my own Fajitas seasoning using 2 teaspoon of Chile powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, paprika, sugar and cumin. Then 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon cornstarch, mixed with tablespoon olive oil and 2 tablespoons butter. Big alternations but wonderful flavor, was not too spicy. Again I used what I had I would do this again.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe and mixed everything on the pan and it was a pain to find all the shrimp before broiling it. The second time I put the shrimp on one side and the peppers and onions on the other. It was much easier that way. Then I mixed the veggies in the seasoned juices that was left from the shrimp. Before serving, I sprinkled some chopped cilantro over the top. My husband really liked the addition of the cilantro.

Really good!   I’ll never fry veggies for fajitas again!  The only thing I had a problem with is the amount of olive oil called for, there wasn’t NEAR enough to make sauce out of the seasoning packets, and it looked like a lot more in the video.  For 1.5 lbs of shrimp I used 2 packages of seasoning, and to make up for the lack of oil I added tequila (why not??).  Instead of cooking the shrimp, taking them off the pan and setting them aside, I baked the veggies first for 20 minutes, then put the seasoned shrimp on there for the last 10 minutes....PERFECT.  Everything came out at the same time.  Excellent flavor.

My family loved it.  Thought about doubling it but wanted to try the recipe first.  Should have made more shrimp.  I added a green pepper. Quick easy delicious dinner.
