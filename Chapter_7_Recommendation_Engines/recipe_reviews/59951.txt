If you use fresh brussels sprouts and cut them into 1/4's and stir fry them in a little olive oil (or your preferred oil)instead of boiling then continue with the rest of the recipe instructions it's even better.

This is a really good healthy side dish! I steamed fresh brussels sprouts which I think makes a big difference. For the sauce I used light margarine and cut the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons. Also cooked it in a saucepan instead of the microwave which eliminated the grainy texture some others encountered. I definitely recommend cutting the sprouts in half before coating with the sauce. It allows the flavor to soak in.

Pretty good and tasty but a bit too sugary. Believe it or not a little bit of water helps the sauce come together if the sugar and butter don't come together. It tasted a lot better the second day. 5-stars for leftovers!

Wow I never would have thought that brussel sprouts could actally taste this great! This recipe is so easy and tasty. I used fresh brussel sprouts roughly two handfuls and then pretty much followed the rest of the recipe but eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. I don't have a microwave so I simply let the sprouts remain the strainer and put the butter (margarine actually) nuts and spices in the same pot I cooked the sprouts and let it all melt and warm up. I put the sprouts in a glass dish and poured the sauce over top. This is worth trying and I'll make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Way too Bizarre! I made this last night and my kids asked for seconds. I have always liked brussels sprouts but when I found this recipe for adding brown sugar I thought it might give me a shot at getting my kids to eat them...So happy I found this recipe! Very easy and yummy. We all really loved the walnuts too....we were fighting for them at the end of the bowl!

Pretty yummy! I didn't add the walnuts because I hate nuts but the butter/brown sugar combo was nice. My only complaint was that when I melted the 2 together in the microwave all the butter settled to the top and the sugar to the bottom. It didn't combine very well and the sauce was a bit 'grainy' then.

I'm not a huge brussels sprouts fan but these were quite tasty. I liked the contrasts between the brown sugar and the sprouts. I'm considering this dish for Thanksgiving dinner. My husband really liked this dish.

I love brussels sprouts. What I didn't like about this recipe was the allspice and the nutmeg. I think I would have enjoyed it more with the butter and brown sugar only with some salt. Thanks for sharing.

We really enjoyed this! I used chopped pecans because I didn't have walnuts - I wasn't sure how much 8 oz. was so just used 1/4 c. because I only had 16 oz. of sprouts (rather than the 20 the recipe calls for). Probably my favorite brussel sprouts recipe I've had.

I loved these! I cut the sprouts in half and steamed them then I microwaved the sauce separately. When both were done I combined the in a skillet and added the walnuts and sauteed them together for a few minutes then turned the heat on low and let them simmer. My husband hates brussel sprouts but he even ate them!

I really liked the flavor of this - I used fresh brussels sprouts and then combined all of the other ingredients in a saucepan. Next time I will let the brown sugar/butter get a bit thicker to provide a nicer coating over the brussels sprouts.

Liked it -- an interesting spin on brussels sprouts. Wouldn't use this recipe every time (it was a big sugary/"festive" if you will) but definitely want to come back to it around the Holidays/when we have company!

Quite nice. I used hazelnuts instead of walnuts and sauteed fresh brussels sprouts instead of using frozen. The "sauce" was more nuts than liquid (I even added some extra butter) but it complimented the sprouts well - just a hint of sweetness and the nutty flavor and crunch was good.

Perhaps it was my lack of observance while microwaving but my walnuts clumped a bit. I increased the salt a bit to play up the sweet/salty factor too. Very good!

We have never been brussel sprout fans but this recipe rocks. The 12 and 10 year olds and husband all enjoyed this. The only objection came from my son who didn't care for the walnuts. Very slight changes: I sauteed halved sprouts in an olive oil/butter combo to lightly brown some sides then steamed for 5-6 minutes. Made sauce w/ slightly less sugar than suggested. Excellent.

After a disastrous attempt at adding brussels sprouts to a pasta dish I didn't think I'd ever be able to eat them again but this recipe was delicious. I mixed the brown sugar in water because some people reported having problems with mixing the sugar in the butter. I also subsituted raisins and goat cheese for the walnuts and they were very good.

I'll put it this way - I could actually eat the sprouts without gagging which doesn't happen often. I rather enjoyed them but would add additional brown sugar next time. Husband and son really didn't care for them at all but they were better than plain sprouts with butter and salt.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I had to do a variation of the recipe. I used a small spoon of molasses and 2 tbsp. of white sugar instead of brown sugar because I didn't have any and replaced the walnuts with pecans. I also made the sauce on the stovetop and it was still very easy. It was delicious.

This was REALLY good! I didn't have 8 oz of walnuts on hand so I used what I had (about 1/3 cup) and it was plenty. I can't imagine using the full 8oz. I've found my side dish to take to Thanksgiving dinner!

I've made this a few times now! I quarter the sprouts to make them a more toddler friendly size... if you do this and put in the fridge for later the insides turn pink. Don't let it creep you out they still taste great warmed up.

I think this recipie made me like brussel sprouts. I cut the butter down to only one tablespoon and cut the sprouts in half since mine was pretty big. The combination of flavors play well of each other. Yummy.. it went very well with some steak.

This was my first foray into brussels sprouts and I was pleasantly surprised. I definitely have a sweet tooth so it was bound to be decent but the way the walnuts and the butter sauce and the sprouts go together was really nice. The only thing I would do differently is to toast the walnuts to bring out their flavor even more.

Unfortunately my kids still wouldn't eat this. BUT my husband and I really liked it! I didn't have walnuts on hand... but next time I make it I will try it that way because I'm sure it will add a ton to the recipe.

Great recipie for brussel sprouts. Gives them a little more flavor but turned out a little sweet the first time can cut down on the ammount of brown sugar

Pretty good... for brussel sprouts. I am a person who likes eating most foods. I am not picky at all however I have yet to eat a brussel sprout I truly love. I tried this reipe in an effort to like brussel sprouts and to introduce them to my children. I thought each bite was better if it included a walnut. I liked the sweet buttery sauce (I also added some cnnamon ) but still didn't like the sprouts. None of my three children liked them. I probably wouldn't make this recipe again. Thanks anyway!

This was an AMAZING RECIPE!!!!! Everyone raved about it!! The only thing I added was garlic powder. But next time I might substitute the butter or olive oil for a healthier recipe! Definetly a most even if you arent really a brussels sprouts person!! Happy Cooking!!

I've never had brussel sprouts before so I gave this recipe a chance and couldn't even eat it. My husband and I both thought it was so bitter.

Pretty good.. although you could coat just about anything with brown sugar and butter and it would taste wonderful. This is about the 3rd time in my life to eat Brussels Sprouts. I kind of like them but my husband thinks they are the worst vegetable known to man. The sauce was great. Really liked the Allspice/Nutmeg/Salt Addition. Thanks

These were delicious. My husband said this was a keeper. I don't cook in the microwave so I steamed fresh sprouts (cut in half) for 8 mins. I put the rest of the ingredients (used 2 T brown sugar instead of 3) in a skillet added the sprouts and cooked at med high for about 15 mins until they were golden brown. Yummy!!

This was good. I cut them in half so they would soak up more of the sauce. I think it may be the allspice that turned me off a bit...maybe? There was a bit of an after taste I didn't like. I would make them again though.

I have never been a fan of brussel sprouts but though I would give this a shot. Im still not a big fan but my in-laws who love brussel sprouts thought they were fabulous.I quartered them so the flavor really penetrated them.

Delish! My husband thought it was a little too sweet but I loved it. The sweet cuts the bitter of the sprout. I did saute fresh sprouts instead of frozen and subbed peacans because I don't like walnuts. Will definitely make again.

These were so delicious and simple to make! My husband who is not a brussel sprouts fan even enjoyed them. The only change I made was after I put the sauce over the sprouts is when I then sprinkled on the walnuts (because I forgot to stir them into the sauce) but it was fantastic. Next time I'll probably try to make half the amount of sauce for the 2 12 oz. bags of sprouts I made just to cut calories a bit. But if you like 'em really saucy definitely use the extra bit. Wonderful!!!

I was pleased with this recipe. I used fresh sprouts and quartered them and cooked them in olive oil as suggested below. I did microwave the other ingredients per instructions but I then just ended up dumping everything over the sprouts when then had cooked enough. I stirred it around and served it up. Great flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This is the best recipe ever. I call it Brussels Sprouts for people who think they don't like Brussels Sprouts. I cook the sprouts I buy the small baby ones i melt butter in a large skillet add the brown sugar and pecans or whatever nuts you use Drain the sprouts and gently stir into the butter brown sugar mixture put in a serving bowl and sprinkle a few nuts on top before serving. I use a more butter and brown sugar than in recipe but i tend to like them a little sweet. and I prefer Pecans over walnuts.

I like brussels sprouts so I don't need any ingredients to make them taste different than they do. For those that don't like them this recipe made no difference. The walnut/brown sugar/spices mixture added nothing to the flavor. Plus the proportion of the topping to the brussels sprouts was way too high.

Well... brussels sprouts are big deal on the Christmas table in the UK. Personally I could take them or leave them and don't see them as a Christmas treat. However THIS recipe made them worth eating. Three of us at the table who don't really like brussels sprouts ate these up. Thank you!

A nice change from the usual butter and herb combo. Substituted sunflower kernels for the walnuts. A real keeper.

O.K. recipe but something just didn't come together. Won't be making again. My husband semi-liked them but liked a recipe I made a few weeks ago better.

This was a delicious base recipe. My alterations were just for personal taste...so I didn't take advantage of the rosemary (though I use often). However my substitutes were cashews and three slices of large diced cooked bacon. It was a slam dunk at our dining table! I did take the advice from others to cut the sprouts into quarters and chose to steam them without added spices rather than boil. Credit to the contributor for sharing! Thank you!!
