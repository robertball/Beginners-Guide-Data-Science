this recipe is good, but excellent if you doctor it up a little.  while sauteing the chicken, add garlic, diced onions, chopped mushrooms & fresh basil. before you serve, top with shredded romano or parmesean.

At 4pm on Wednesday afternoon--telephone call from friends who found themselves in town for the evening. My car was in the shop so no way to run to the grocers.
Then I recalled seeing a couple of recipes that I thought I had ingredients for and found this one.  IT WAS A HIT!!!
I used leftover peppered chicken breasts, sliced and warmed. No fresh tomatoes, so I used Del Monte canned tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano. Tossed in more garlic (never enough of that)and some fresh basil.
When I served it:
Drained and put the pasta on a large serving platter, poured the sauce over it, placed the warm chicken breast slices nicely over the sauce--added some fresh basil sprigs. It was a delicious as it was beautiful.
I also made a topping (for on the side) of italian bread crumbs, chopped garlic,and fresh grated romano cheese. Threw that in a skillet and lightly browned it--tasted yummy over the pasta. 
Served it with some warm vienna bread.
Everyone asked for the recipe and I felt like the local Martha!

this was an easy recipe. i had to add onion and garlic per other reviews.  i hid some mushrooms and grated carrot too. however i used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of broth which made it much creamer with out more cheese. ground black pepper will bring out the missing flavor of this dish. sprinkle with Parm. cheese and flakes of red pepper. its a winner! thanks for the recipe

I didn't follow this recipe exactly so I'm not sure how fair it is to review.  I'm going to do it anyway. I modified things quite a bit but the bones of the recipe are good.  Instead of using cream cheese, I used whipping cream, milk and fresh parmesan cheese to make a sauce.  I browned chicken pieces in a skillet with olive oil, onion and garlic until the onions were a little carmelized.  I also added sauteed mushrooms, a handful of capers, about 6 sun-dried tomatoes (chopped into small pieces) and red pepper flakes for spice.  I drained the spinach well and chopped it very fine.  We topped it with more parmesan.  This was quite tasty.

This is SO extremely good and easy. My family loves it and its great still warm or as a cold pasta salad the next day. I added a pack of Italian mix too, and highly recommend doing so. Fast, easy and awesome, thanks for our latest family favorite!!!!


If you want it more creamy add a pack of buttermilk ranch dressing mix instead of Italian. SO GOOD!

I used leftover chicken breasts and fresh spinach. I also skipped the tomatoes. This was really good; my only complaint is that my husband ate so much I didn't get to save any leftovers!:) I bet it would be good with fresh mushrooms.

I gave this 4 stars because I agree with other reviewers, it is a great starting point.  Here is what I did- sauteed the cut up chicken in a little olive oil and chopped fresh garlic with salt and pepper.  Then simmered in the chicken broth, added the cream cheese, added a box of creamed spinach instead of plain, and followed it up with a can of diced tomatoes.  It made ALOT!  But my kids enjoyed it, top with a little parmesean and it is a good weeknight meal.  Good luck!

Took the advice of others and gave it some flavor with fresh mushrooms, onions, pressed garlic and s & p.  It is very good!  The kids like it and it's easy.  It doesn't have much sauce for the whole pound of pasta, so I would maybe add some cream or more cream cheese, maybe another 4 oz-especially if you are going to have leftovers.

Not one to make again.  Gave two stars because it is a mix of good ingredients and it makes a generous amount.  But it is very bland.  The sauce is thin.  Even adding salt, pepper, parsley, chopped onion, fresh garlic, oregano and shaved parmesan it lacked flavour.  To doctor it up any further would be a whole different recipe.

This was a good base recipe.  I used vegetable broth and a package of tofu instead of chicken.  I also added garlic, onion and yellow pepper in the broth mixture.  I used fresh torn spinach instead of frozen and even though I let it simmer for at least 15 minutes, the sauce was still too thin for me, so I added a handful of shredded mozzarella cheese. I used two cloves of garlic this time, but next time I'll double that.  I might add walnuts at the end also for that added crunch and the health benefits.  As other reviewers stated, this was great cold the next day.  I might even try serving this as a cold pasta salad!  I served over fresh fettuccine this time...delish!

Wonderful base recipe! My boyfriend loved it! I did make alterations as follows. I didn't have cherry tomatoes so I used a can of drained diced tomatoes-in-italian seasoning, I used fresh spinach that I sauteed down before adding to dish, I added 2 diced carrots, and I sauteed a diced onion and 8 oz pkg of sliced portabello mushroom. As for the sauce/chicken, I sprinkled my chicken cubes w/ various herbs/s&p then cooked in 2 cups of Chicken broth (as other reviews said there was not enough sauce). I then added 12 oz of cream cheese and a packet of Italian dressing mix. Lastly I used Fettucine instead of Penne. Like I said, I did make a lot of alterations, but this is a wonderful base recipe as the sauce is quite tasty! Thanks Ourgang for a sure to be repeated in our house recipe! :)

Oh my goodness this was so good. I did change a little. I added about 1/2 cup of frozen peas, no spinach, and about 1/2 a bag of frozen broccoli, and about 1/2 a cup of sliced mushrooms. I will definently make this again.

Good recipe, nice way to make a cream sauce.  Needs significant doctoring to add flavor.  Added garlic, onion, basil, pepper, salt and parmesan and next time will double what I added.  But will make it again.

I really wanted to love this.  After all was said and done, this was a delicious meal.  However, it took some doctoring to get there.  Most cooks can taste the meal half-way thru and know whether their family will like it, or if it needs changes.  My changes were as follows: I browned the chicken in some olive oil until nice and brown.  Stirred in the broth and about a cup of white wine for simmering.  After I put the cream cheese in I realized it needed some more flavor.  I stirred in a packet of Italian Dressing mix (the dry powder) and let it all simmer together.  Then I stirred in the tomatoes and a 9 oz bag of FRESH spinach.  Now we're talking.  I want to rate this a 5* but due to all of the modifications for my family to enjoy it, I have to rate a 3*.  That being said (yeah, I have a point, I'm getting there...lol) this is a great base recipe that folks can use to adapt to their liking.  The idea of the poached chicken in the broth was soo tender and tasty.  Just add the ingredients you know that your family loves and you won't be disappointed!  :-)

Not my favorite chicken and pasta dish, but it was pretty good and very easy to make. A little lacking in flavor for my taste. Next time I'd leave out the tomatoes, add some garlic, Parmesan, and perhaps broccoli and peppers. I thought it was a good place to start and has potential.

I sauted the chicken in a little olive oil and butter with minced garlic and onion and salt and pepper. Used fresh spinach and a little fresh basil at the end. Very very good and quick dish.

I make this each month to replenish the  stock of frozen lunches for my husband. This beats anything in the "Budget Gourmet" frozen meals line, and I'm able to add a little bit of love to every bite.

I did not like this dish very much. I was so disappointed in the flavor! It was so bland. I even added the chopped onion and garlic as suggested and it just turned out so bland. It looked absolutely beautiful though, like a restaurant would serve, but maybe I'll try it again and add more spices and garlic.

I'm not that picky of an eater - and I should've changed up the recipe a bit. This was absolutely NOT TO MY LIKING. I don't understand how it's getting such amazing reviews...it seriously tasted like the spinach taste overwhelmed the pasta and the cream cheese and chicken broth just made it waaaaay funky tasting. It definitely was bland as well. I will neeeeever make this recipe again.

Way better than I thought it would be!  I only used 1/2 bag of frozen spinach and subed half can diced tomatoes (drained) for fresh.  I also browned the chicken first in olive oil with garlic powder and italian seasoning.  Top with grated parm for a pretty presentation.

This recipe is very plain without making changes.  I am allergic to tomatoes so I left out the tomatoes and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Also, the recipe calls for way to much spinach.  I used half of the recipe amount, and it was plenty.  The chicken and pasta was very bland when finished, so I added cajun seasoning and topped with fresh shredded parmesan for more flavor.  It was ok, but will definitely not make again.

Good starter recipe, for added flavor I seasoned the chicken with MRS.DASH GARLIC AND HERB, and browned it in butter and olive oil first, removed the meat to a plate and poured off the oil from the pan, added the meat and broth back to the pan and followed the recipe as written from there. My DH liked it so much, he went back for seconds, and continued to pick at it as we cleared the table.

Pretty good! I will be making it again. The only thing I changed about the recipe was I added a little less spinach just because I am not a huge fan. It was a delicious! A must try!

My husband loved it! I used seasoned tomatos and seasoned the meat while it cooked with onion & garlic. I only had 1/2 a box of pasta. That seemed to be fine as the sauce wasn't thin. More pasta & it really woulld have been.

This is now one of my go-to recipes. I have made changes here and there depending on what's in my fridge at the time. I've used normal tomatoes (they work just as well as cherry), and if I need the sauce to go further, I add cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, sour cream, or plain yogurt. I also like to throw in onions and mushrooms.

As several other viewers suggested, this recipe is quite plain as it stands. It really does need some garlic at least. I like to add fresh basil if I've got it, as well as oregano and pepper. I'd give it a 3 without the herbs and spices and a 5 with them.

I have made different variations of this dish; but have to say this one has been my favorite.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except scaling back on the spinach, just because my family tends to like dishes where the spinach isn't so overpowering.  Also, I didn't have the cherry tomatoes, so I used a can of diced ones and it turned out well.  I wil definitely make it again.

Very quick and fresh. I had red peppers on hand so I subbed in one of those for the cherry tomatoes that I didn't have, but I think I would have preferred the spinach-tomato combination. I also used a 10oz bag of fresh spinach and that worked great, I didn't think there was too much of it either. I am not a huge fan of the cream cheese sauce, though. I think a can of cream soup (chicken, maybe mushroom or celery) would make this as creamy and be cheaper and more flavorful. I will make this again with that change. Thanks very much for sharing.

This was very good.  I took others' advice and added garlic, salt, pepper, a little red pepper and onions.  I used canned diced tomatoes and mushrooms and fresh spinach that I had on hand.  It needed more salt and pepper at the table, but that did the trick.  Very elegant, easy and delicious.

Not very good - quite flavorless- the amount of doctoring required makes it a completely different recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly except, I substituted steamed broccoli for the spinach.  I liked the idea of having some vegies in a pasta dish and no heavy cream.  The problem I had was that the sauce didn't thicken up at all.  The sauce was completely runny and sat at the bottom of the dish.  It was also rather bland, so I added salt, pepper and plenty of parm cheese.  I might try again and saute the chicken then add some flour before adding the broth and cream cheese.

This was pretty good ... I pretty much followed the recipe at first, using sundried tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes, and adding a quarter of an onion to the mix.  Thing is, it was pretty bland and I had to add salt and pepper ... it still seemed to be missing something so I added a handful of feta and used a lot of sprinkled romano on top of each plateful.  That helped a lot, but because of the initial blandness I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I will make again using my changes.

Made this for dinner tonight.  I used a can of mild Rotel tomatoes instead of the fresh cherry tomatoes, and used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  This is the second time I've made this and it's REALLY good!  The slight spicyness of the Rotel adds good flavor and just a bit of heat.  My kids (ages 6 and 3) ate it!  Definitely a keeper!

This is a great base recipe. I made adjustments based on what I had. I sauteed some onion and garlic in a little olive oil. Then added a splash white wine and the chicken broth. Added cubed cooked chicken, and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Stirred in 1/2 package thawed leaf spinach, 1/2 package cream cheese (all I had), 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup grated parm. Cooked about 5 minutes. Then added halved cherry tomatoes, 1/4 t. pepper, 1/4 t. garlic powder, 1/4 t. red pepper flakes, cooked 5 minutes. Served over wheat penne. My husband gave it a thumbs up. Will try it over rice next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

Do NOT, and I repeat NOT use an entire bag of frozen spinach... The sauce was so good, but the spinach soaked up all the moisture, so I had to keep adding more water.... Giving it 3 stars because the sauce and chicken was yummy, but adding that much spinach made this recipe very bitter!

This is a great base recipe but a little bland so I sauteed chicken in olive oil with minced garlic, added 1 teaspoon basil, 1/2 cup white wine, and fresh mushrooms, coarse black pepper and sea salt. The family loved it and asked for it to be put in the regular meal rotation.

I can't imagine this being any good without some flavor!  Use fresh spinach over frozen.  You can add this with the cream cheese, and it wilts nicely.  I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in a small amount of butter, then cooked chicken for a few minutes until white on all sides.  This seemed to lock in some flavor.  I also added red pepper flakes, salt & pepper to the chicken for a boost.  Overall this is a wonderful & simple recipe, although I had to thicken with corn starch.  I think a can of cream of chicken soup would have substituted the cream cheese & chicken broth nicely.  An ok recipe with changes.

I made this twice, once as written and once again with added onion and garlic.  It was good the first time but great the second time.  It just needed more flavor.  I sauted onion & garlic in a pan and then added them when I added the spinach adn cream cheese.

Sooo good!!  And so easy! I did however cook the chicken first with some onion, garlic and seasonings but followed the rest of the recipe and loved it.  Also, instead of using frozen spinach which I think is a pain to drain, I just tossed in fresh spinach.  Delicious recipe.  It was creamy without the heavy feeling of a  cream based sauce.  Everyone loved it!

i tried this recipe just two nights ago, and i thought it sounded good but the big test are the opinions of my two girls (one 13 yrs old and the other 1 yr old). They both loved it! My oldest told me so and the baby, well she ate her little portion up quick! i sent some along the next day for her with the babysitter and she told me its the first time she finished her lunch that quick! this is most definitely a kid friendly dish that kids of all ages will like!

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I added chopped onion, garlic, basil, parmesan cheese, and nutmeg. The result was awesome. My fuzzy partner loved it. I would give that version 5 stars. I think if I followed the recipe to the T, the sauce could have been bland like the other reviewers mentioned. Thanks for this recipe though.

After reading the reviews, decided to doctor it up with a package of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing seasoning mix....that definitely did it.  Just bursting with flavor.  Didn't add garlic or onions or anything else.  Just the chicken, spinach, and tomatoes.  Yum, yum.  It's easy an easy crowd pleaser!

This is a good base recipe but I definitely needed to follow the recommendation of other reviewers.  Garlic, salt, mushrooms, basil, and onion were must haves. I will try this again since it was a good way to get spinach into my family!

This is a great recipe as is, but it's also good for tweaking many different ways.  I used more chicken so I needed extra sauce.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup in addition to the cream cheese.  I also added a can of mushrooms, garlic powder and capers.   Excellent!

Eh, I'll give it three stars for being quick and easy, but the flavor was kinda bland. I'll try it again, but it definitely needs the garlic and onion to tweak the flavor as well as ground black pepper.

Forgettable.   Even after doctoring it up with onions, garlic, paremesean it was just ok.   Not enough sauce for the amount of pasta.   Might have been ok with less pasta and perhaps some salt.

This is a really great base recipe! Too bland just as is for my family. Doctored up just a tad and it's definitely a 5 star recipe. Like others I added mushrooms, onions, garlic, other spices, etc.

As the other reviewers said, this is a good base recipe. I seasoned the pieces of chicken and sauteed them with onions and mushrooms. Then I added the broth, a can of cream of chicken, the cream cheese, spinach and a can of diced tomatoes w/basil, garlic & oregano, let that simmer and then stirred in the pasta and Parmesan cheese. We did find that it needed salt and pepper but my husband and I really liked it where as my children didn't really care for the spinach but liked the rest of it. I think if I would have used fresh spinach it would have been better.

This was a really good recipe. I of course had to make a couple changes, due to what I had on hand. I used fresh/chopped spinach instead of frozen. And I didn't have any cherry tomatoes, so I just drained a can of diced tomatoes and threw them in. (which I think may have made it better) My family ate this up. And my usually picky husband gave it a '10'! He said it had a sauce that reminded him of a bisque. Mmmmm yummo!

As is, this recipes is very basic and needs flavor. I think it is a great start and will make again, but will add more seasoning. I did add a onion and mushrooms this time around.

Not good at all. Waste of chicken. I should have known better since the recipe states to basically boil the chicken. Nobody in the family liked it and I am an fairly experienced cook so I know i cooked the dish correctly.

So simple and so good!  Just used the Tyson precooked sliced chicken and simmered in the chicken stock until hot.  Followed recipe to a tee and it was delicious, froze leftovers - this dish freezed VERY well!

It will be an easy one to adapt to whatever fresh vegetables I have on hand. Will definitely make again.

My cherry tomato plant went crazy so I went looking for a recipe to use some of them.  This is a great basic recipe.  I did do what another reviewer suggested and used Rondeles cheese spread (reduced fat) instead of cream cheese and it came out pretty good.

We followed the recipe nearly to the T and found it a little bland. My husband said it was good with barbecue sauce. We did use canned spinach when we realized we were out of frozen spinach and one and a half fresh diced tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes, so that might've made a difference. It would probably be better with some of the suggestions in the reviews. All in all, though, it wasn't so bad.

This is a good base, but it has no flavor.  I added garlic, garlic salt and onion, but this still wasn't enough.  It also took a while for the sauce to thicken up.  Next time I will try adding some dry Italian or ranch dressing.  I will also try sauteing the chicken first as I don't really like the chicken boiled in broth that much.  It really is a good base though.

This was a big hit with my family. One change I made was to use La Roule cheese instead of cream cheese.  The garlic and herbs in La Roule gave the dish a lot of flavor.  If you don't have La Roule, Boursin or Rondele would be good subsititutes as well.  I also increased the chicken broth to about 1 3/4 cups.  Will definitely make it again!  Thanks for the recipe.

Even with the addition of two cloves of fresh garlic and 2 TBSP of fresh basil, this was still pretty flavorless. It would need a lot of tweaking before it could be called "unbelievable".

Great Recipe!!  My picky 6 year old loved it and so did my 8 month old.  We didn't have tomatoes, but it was just as good without it.  The only addition I made was half a pack of ranch dressing mix & garlic to the chicken while it was cooking.  I think mushrooms would be a great addition next time.

This is a good recipe. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars for the simplicity & the fact that my picky eater gobbled it up. I am not giving it 5 stars because it does need a little something. Next time I will use garlic and maybe Greek seasoning. Otherwise - it's GREAT!

this turned out really good.  i tweaked it a bit, i added minced garlic to the chicken broth while it simmered the chicken.  i also added mushrooms to the sauce.  after reading some of the other reviews, i went on ahead and added more chicken broth and cream cheese to make more sauce.  everyone loved it!

I couldn't follow the recipe exactly since I didn't have the same ingredients.  Here's what I did:  cooked bacon and fresh spinach, added chicken stock and cream cheese and cooked it down.  Then added leftover rotisserie chicken.  Garnished with sliced fresh tomato.  My somewhat picky children loved it and ate seconds!!  For adults, I think I would add some red pepper flakes. . .I think this would bring this recipe to a whole new level of yumminess!  Thanks for sharing!

This was great, with the addition of half a chopped yellow onion, a lot of Italian Seasoning and Garlic Salt. Would have been terribly bland with out it. Good base recipe to work with.

I made this almost exactly as described.  I sauteed onions and garlic and then added the chicken.   There were no spices listed, so I seasoned the chicken with 1/2 a packet of dry Italian dressing seasoning.  I made the sauce in a separate sauce pan and used the other 1/2 of the seasoning for added flavor.  Everything else was the same.  I topped it with parmesean cheese and served with garlic bread.  Absolutely wonderful the first day and for leftovers.  Even my three-year ate it - spinach and all!

I'm really unsure how to rate this. I followed the recipe as it was written. I used full fat cream cheese and not a lighter version. So, I know it wasn't my ingredients. I don't know what I did wrong but it was a watery/soupy mess and wouldn't get thick. I ended up putting in shredded cheese (cheddar and parmesan) to help it along and eneded up putting it in the oven for about 40 minutes. Came out fine but it was rather bland... hard to believe with all those cheeses in it!! BUT it tasted WONDERFUL the next day! So, nothing was wasted. I still think I will give it another try - maybe next time with tuna. I know it HAD to be something I did.  Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe. Needed more pizazz though.... I added garlic, garlic salt and some seasoning from a grinder. Used about 3/4 lb of penne, and there was just enough sauce. Added extra cherry tomatoes, too, made it taste even better!!

This dish gets 5 stars for taste and volume. My family of 5 ate this for dinner and again for lunch the next day. The flavors are simple, so if you are looking for a WOW flavor, this isn't your recipe. For variety I will try adding a little lemon juice and maybe chopped onion and julienne carrots.

This is a pretty good starter for an amazing dish, but alone... not really so much. I had to doctor this up A LOT, and it was still missing something. Also, the sauce was way too thin, it just runs to the bottom of the bowl and doesn't really cling on to anything.    Some changes I made: Used less spinach - I added about 7 oz and then realized the whol package would have been waaaaay too much for our likings. We like spinach, but that would have just overpowered the dish. Added fresh mushrooms, garlic, onion, salt and pepper, and a few more of the tomatoes. After all of that ,it still seemed kinda bland. I think the next time I make it I might add more cream cheese to help with the flavor and hopefully to thicken things up a bit.    Thanks for the recipe!

Probably all my fault, but this did not turn out well...  The only changes I made, was that I used fat free cream cheese and left out tomatoes, (which my family will not eat).  Followed other reviewers' advice and I added onion, garlic and sauteed mushrooms.  The main problem is that I used chopped frozen spinach, which completely overtook the look and flavor of the pasta.   I have never written a negative review before on this website, but this one just did not work for me.

This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly except that I added sauteed onions, zucchini, red pepper and fresh diced tomato to the mixture after the spinach and cream cheese were added (only to sneak in veggies). The kids loved it! I think it would be fantastic with shrimp too!  Great recipe!

This was very easy to make and no fuss clean up to boot. The cream cheese makes a nice flavor base and consistency for the sauce. You have to think of this sauce as background music - it allows for individual flavors to stand out. Whatever you put in this is what you are going to taste first, the delicate sauce second. I used a little garlic and pepper along with sun dried tomatoes, and I am glad I did. I can see this with artichokes and maybe capers. And, it would be fabulous with caramelized carrots added!

I, too, altered it after reading reviews.  I used what I had on hand. . .chives cream cheese, added basil and garlic to broth and I cooked the pasta in the broth rather than have another pot to wash.  I used half the pasta called for because what some say is 6-servings it's really more like 10 for us.  I stirred in about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  I gave 5 stars for helping me figure out what to do with the chicken and random stuff in my fridge!

I cubed the chicken instead of making it strips. I only had about 8 oz spinach, and I left out the tomatoes because my husband doesn't care for them. Added a tablespoon of minced garlic, a tablespoon of ground black pepper, and a packet of Italian dressing mix like another rater suggested. Turned out pretty good. keeping the recipe and planning to make again... might add red pepper flakes or something to get more flavor out of it.

I made this as written and it's very bland.  My kids even found it to be tasteless.  I agree with other reviewers that it's a good base to start with, but would need lots of doctoring.  I most likely won't make this again.

Very tasty base recipe. I did make a couple slight changes and will be making a couple more next time since it didn't seem quite as flavorful or rich as we like. We used morningstar chicken griller patties and veggie broth instead of of the meat products. We also added 3 small cloves of garlic, maybe a teaspoon of oregano, a bit more pepper, and a little salt.   Next time we will be adding another 5-10 tomatoes as well as about 3/4 cup parmesan or similar cheese toward the end.

This was very good. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese & grated parmesean cheese on top. I also doubled tomatoes & used grape instead of cherry. It could use a little something. Next time I think I will follow other reviews and saute onion & garlic & add to chicken.

Very good base recipe!  I modified according to my families tastes.  I added garlic, onions, and rosemary when the chicken was simmering.  Instead of cherry tomatoes I used diced tomatoes since the rest of my family doesn't like large, fresh tomatoes.  Thanks for a great start to a great dinner!

Quick and easy to make!  I doctored a bit--used whole boneless breasts, sauteed in olive oil/garlic/seasoned w onion powder and sea salt.  I added the cream cheese, broth, spinach, and since I did not have tomatoes I used some left over pico de gallo.  Let it simmer for about 15 mins.  Served as a topping to the penne.  CAN YOU SAY DELICIOUS!!?

Great recipe just a little light on the seasoning. I also sauteed the chicken in garlic and onions. I also added greek seasoning at the end to pop the flavors. Great base recipe that had by two year old eating spinach and asking for more!

Very good, and very easy.  I didn't have 8 oz of cream cheese, just 6,and it turned out pretty good, a little on the juicy side, so maybe next time, i will add cornstarch, mushrooms, garlic, and onions too.

I loved this recipe with a few minor changes: sauted chicken cubes with a finely chopped onion, a cup of chopped mushrooms and a tbsp. of minced garlic.  I did not add the broth, but after cream cheese was melted, added a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and fresh basil which made an amazing rose sauce.  Even though my kid have to have theirs without spinach, it's still a winner.

This will be one of those recipes you love to make. So easy, fast, minimal clean up, and completely fool proof, which makes it perfect for those nights when you come home from work and don't want to think. Also, most of the ingredients you'll have on hand, which is always handy. *teehee*

I tried this with fresh asparagus instead of spinach.  I took the chicken out of the broth and cooked the aspapragus for about five minutes then took it out and added the cream cheese then I returned the remaining ingredients to the sauce.  Even my picky eater ate the veggies!! It was great!

Like most of the other reviews, Great base recipe but I doctored the sauce a bit. So I cooked the chicken and pasta with mushrooms, spinach, corn and canned tomatoes. For the sauce I heated up about 2 cups of milk and about 1/2c of white cooking wine (I use wine for all my sauces white for chicken, red for beef you won't regret it) then slowly stirred in the cream cheese. Added salt, pepper, garlic with parsley (I don't measure my seasonings, just tossed it in until it tastes good) Cooked stirring until melted. Toss everything together...Result: Yum!

Very bland.  Tried to add some flavor with suggetions: saute with onions and mushrooms, fresh basil, salt, pepper and it was still very bland.  Would really need to modify to get some flavor and that would make it a very different recipe.

As instructed on here, it was alright. We will probably make it again when we need something easy and quick. We didn't modify it at all and it was okay but a little bland.

Good, hearty meal... Cut calories using no-fat cream cheese, switched to low sodium broth and added Italian seasoning, garlic and onion powder for extra flavor.  Canned Italian style tomatoes might have added a bit more flavor than the regular style I used, but all in all a nice choice for a quick, easy and filling dinner!!

I added a little onion powder and 1 clove of minced garlic, which was my only minor change.  WOW!  this recipe is awesome for sure.  I will try fat free cream cheese next time to alleviate my guilt.

LOVE this recipe. Added sun-dried tomatoes as that was all I had available, and red crushed pepper flakes! Even my 16 month old loved it!

To be fair - I discovered I didn't have any penne pasta and I used linguine instead, but something was just off on this one. I found the chicken rather bland and the sauce never did get thick at all. Maybe that's okay over penne pasta, but it doesn't work very well over linguine.

I don't know why this is so good, but it is!!!! And it's so simple.

I did substitute canned, diced tomatoes, and velveeta instead of cream cheese the first time time I made this because I used what I had on hand time. Either way it is a simple, easy and delicious dish.

Yum! I used green beans instead of spinach and left out the tomatoes and the whole family loved it. My 5 year old, super picky son even ate every last bite. It's super easy to throw together and you can easily switch it up by changing the vegetables and/or pasta. Definitely a keeper.

Wow,, I enjoyed this. I did use fresh baby spinach, and added some mushrooms.  I needed to make this a low cal dinner so I used low fat cottage cheese,, and it turned out to be a dish to make again. THANK YOU .. great meal here.

This was absolutely delicious, I wasn't sure if they kids would like it, because of the spinach, but they did.  I knew it was a hit when my pickiest eater asked for more!!  I added more tomato, just something I love more of.

Excellent recipe. I altered the recipe a bit by using fresh spinach (which I think makes such a difference), seasoning the chicken with garlic, and using whole wheat spaghetti noodles instead of penne pasta. My entire family LOVED it, and it make a great meal to deliver if you are cooking for a family that has just had a new baby, etc.

Very good. I love how quick and easy this recipe is. I omitted the tomatoes and added some minced garlic while simmering the chicken. I'd like to try adding artichoke hearts and/or sun dried tomatoes. This is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe, made it tonight very easily. It does need some doctoring up though. I cooked the chicken with a chopped onion (next time will be adding some mushrooms) and it was amazing. I will also be adding some garlic as I didn't use any this time and really regret it. Overall it was great and will be making it again.

Great started recipe!  I followed another review and added a few things - onions, mushrooms, garlic, salt and pepper.  I also sauted the onions, garlic, mushrooms and garlic in oil and simply added a little chicken broth when I added the cream cheese.  It was missing one thing.  Next time, I will definitely be adding some white wine! Overall - great recipe.  Even my fussy 5 year old loved it.

We just found this to be very bland.  Per other reviewer's suggestions, I used garlic and chive cream cheese, added some minced garlic and about 1/2 cup parmesan cheese plus I used my own homemade chicken broth and used a can of diced tomatoes.  I think this needs to be kicked up with a packet of ranch or italian dressing mix.

It wasn't very flavorful.  I even added parmesan, and that didn't help much either.  My husband added garlic powder, but that just seemed to overpower the entire dish.

So good and easy with common kitchen staples! My modifications: Marinated the chicken cubes in some vegetable oil, white vinegar, oregano, Italian seasonings, garlic, and pepper for a short amount of time. Then added more garlic, pepper, and Italian seasonings to the chicken cube/stock mixture in the skillet (I had stock on hand instead of broth). Strained out some of the juices before adding the spinach and cream cheese and used strained canned tomatoes because I had no fresh ones. I was worried when it came out a little runny, but it was delicious! Also used rigatoni instead of penne - amazing!

Great meal, kind of heavy (pasta), but with some fresh garlic and minced onion in the chicken broth really adds flavor. Also, reading a previous review i added pepper and this completed the sauce.

Loved it and the family loved it too- even my 3 year old. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and will probably make this every time I buy a chicken. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Four stars only because we needed to tweak it to taste.  We used fresh chopped spinach (don't keep frozen on hand), added a little red pepper & garlic & onion to the chicken, and used cream of mushroom soup as well as a few shakes of Italian seasoning.  Worked well - the kids (ages 3&5) absolutely raved.

Made this is as written, tasted perfect.  The only thing I might change is I would probably make more sauce, but we just love sauce to soak up the french bread we added as a side.  Wonderfully delish!

Due to other reviews, I intended to modify, but I have a fractured arm, so my sister prepared it for me. she ended up following the recipe exactly except for the addition of some fresh basil. the recipe was a hit with the whole family and its the first time my two year old ate, or make that devoured, spinach!

I think this is delicious, and so easy to make. I have subbed asparagus for the spinach, just because I didn't have any, and it was good too!...I have made this many times now. I have used the sauce with lots of different stuff, last night I used shrimp, sundried tomatoes,and artichoke hearts, and it is soooo delicious!

This is a great recipe.  Easily adapted to family tastes or what's on hand.  I used fresh spinach, vegetable broth and added some garlic, basil and lemon juice.  I also used half of the chicken and twice the tomatoes.  I used low fat cream cheese and whole wheat pasta.  I'm sure this recipe is great as is, I just changed it to use what I had on hand and meet my family's tastes.  Thanks for sharing!

MMmmm..So tasty, and so pretty, and so easy. I served mine over noodles instead of mixing because I only had spaghetti noodles.  Added extra tomatoes. We will make this again!

You know I can't say enough good about it. All I added beyond the original recipe was minced garlic. The nice part is, various people in my family won't tolerate the sauce or mixing stuff together or spinach... so I was able to pull out THEIR portion as I went thru this and by the end, those of us who actually love to eat FOOD, enjoyed this rich, tender, and flavourful dish without the griping of others "forced" to eat it. Perfect!

Not much flavor.  The sauce was way too runny.  It was even worse reheated the next day.  I need meals that make good leftovers.

Absolutely fantastic! I made this last night and had everything but cherry tomatoes on hand. I added a bit of granulated garlic and topped it with a handful of toasted pine nuts! I'm looking forward to making it again when I have some grape tomatoes (I prefer them to cherry tomatoes) and will continue to add the garlic and pine nuts. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I did use canned seasoned tomatoes, but other than that I followed the recipe as is.  I thought it could use a little flavor punch, but I'm not exactly sure what to try.  I might use flavored cream cheese next time.  It is a great way to get the kids to eat spinach and a great way to use up leftover chicken.  I will make again, it is nice comfort food.  Thanks for the recipe.

Perfect! Just creamy enough without being too heavy. Flavors are even better the next day. Add browned garlic and onion first before doing anything else (adds just the right amount of extra flavor).

Really great and simple, nice for company. I seasoned and then seared the chicken first then followed the recipe. Added a little grated parm when it was served. The flavor is subtle, the texture nice and creamy. It's the kind of recipe you could do a lot with - add swiss cheese, other herbs & vegetables, change chicken to shrimp then serve over linguini, etc.  It's a keeper.

I used what was on hand. I didn't have chicken breats, so I used 1 lb of ground turkey. I added mushrooms, onions, and garlic. Instead of tomatoes, I used sundried tomatoes. It was awesome. My son ate 3 helpings. This is a keeper!

Loved this recipe - left out the cherry tomatoes because they are not a favorite with my eaters.  Added some chopped sweet onion when cooking the chicken and used whole wheat pasta for my diabetic.  Very flavorful way to use boneless chicken breast!

This is the first time I have rated a recipe but felt that this one deserved a rating. It is just fantastic. My husband said it was good, very good. Please make it again and again. I went by others and added mushrooms, only because I had some I needed to use. And then I took the advise of another and browned butter in a saucepan and added breadcrumbs and some Mizithra cheese. WOW Please try this you will not be disappointed.

This is a great recipe!  Admittedly, I did make several modifications.  Like many others, I sauteed garlic and onion in olive oil, then added the chicken.  I used half the cream cheese and used fresh spinach.  I topped with Locatelli cheese.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

Like other reviewers, I sauted the chicken in olive oil with garlic and onions.  I used cream of chicken soup which may have made it too thick but I added a can of undrained diced tomatoes and that helped thin it out.  I used fresh spinach and also added some red pepper flakes. Served with wheat penne.   Its very good but it does make a lot!

This was so yummy!  I didnt have cherry tomoatoes, so I left them out. It seemed very spinachy to my family, but I loved it.  This (minus a bit of spinach), is definatly a keeper!

A very good recipe!  We'll definitely use this one often.  

We changed it up a little though bc we thought it was a little bland.  We used green peppers instead of spinach and added two teaspoons of cajun seasoning. 

Very good though!

This was a good base recipe, but my family likes lots of flavor and this recipe was rather bland the first time I made it. I have since modified it a bit and made it a 5 star by cooking the chicken in some olive oil first, than adding a can of cream of chicken and a little broth, then I added some fresh basil with the spinach and garlic salt and black pepper. I also like a can of diced tomatoes better than the fresh cherry tomatoes. It's also cheaper that way. This makes ALOT of food which is good for a big family like mine!

Pretty good base, but like other cooks I added some personality and flavor. Sauteed mushrooms and onions with some garlic and the chicken, then added the chicken broth. Also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. A pretty good recipe, just needed a bit of love! I have also changed it up a bit by adding a packet of ranch dressing to the sauce.

4 Stars seems about right.  It was tasty, but it got a little sticky as it cooled on our plates, which made a weird texture.

I added 2 cloves of garlic and 1/4 of a small onion to the broth while simmering! And a can of tomato paste after I added the cream cheese and spinach! THIS WAS DELICIOUS!

Amazing!  I used a can of diced tomatoes and i used broccoli instead of spinach.  I also added a splash of marsala.  I would cut the pasta back to 12 oz. so it's saucier.  Very versatile recipe.

I made this for my family and it was well received, but needed a few changes. The grape tomatoes were overdone so the second time I made it, I left them whole and sauteed them in olive oil, so when they started to pop I knew they were done. I also grilled the chicken on the george foreman... quick and pretty! I also sauteed mushrooms, vidalia onion and added Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb Seasoning. I used 16 oz of cream cheese... one I mixed with fresh chopped garlic and the other one was the chive & onion mixture and mixed the two together with some pepper and it was great.  Loved it!

I really enjoyed this.  But I did take a combination of reviewer's suggestions to add more flavor.  I sauteed white onion in some bacon drippings, added the chunked pre-cooked chicken (rotisserie), mixed in the cream cheese, and added chopped tomato and fresh-from-the-garden spinach.  Seasoned to taste with oregano, basil, garlic, S/P.  The second time I made this I used Orzo pasta that I added in cooked and simmered a while to absorb more flavor.  Served with parmesan cheese on top.

I read the reviews for this recipe and combined them together. I added onions, garlic, and mushrooms and cooked them in the skillet before adding the chicken and broth. I also followed the suggestion on using 12 oz of cream cheese instead of 8. 10 cherry tamatoes wasn't enough so I added about 10 move. We loved the pasta it turned out great. Wasn't as good left over but I will definitly make it again!

My hubby makes a dish like this often. But, we don't use chicken broth because of the sodium and/or MSG added to most canned or boxed broth. But, we add Mrs Dash to it, and it's great. We also love garlic at our house, so a little extra garlic helps too. You can also substitute a basic white cream sauce for the cream cheese, and it is just as good.

My whole family (even the picky kids) loved this recipe!  I make this often, and enjoy using fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen, adding it at the end so it's just wilted.  Also, instead of cooking the chicken as directed, usually just add some leftover grilled chicken breast.  The grilled flavor adds another dimension... even better!

The basic recipe wasn't bad. However, this sauce was a little too rich for my tastes. I'd like to try it again, experimenting with ways to reduce the amount of cream cheese but still have a tasty, creamy sauce.

I really liked this recipe b/c I had everything on hand to make it.  I also followed other reviewer's suggestions and added garlic, mushrooms, and used canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also used two large cans of chicken instead of fresh.  This recipe was good, but still tasted like it needed some other kind of seasoning.

Enjoyed this.  As others suggested, sauteed chicken with an onion, sliced fresh mushrooms and 4 garlic cloves in olive oil, added salt and pepper.  Used cream cheese flavored with chives and onions, also added a few splashes of half and half at the end because I had it on hand.  Smelled great cooking, had nice, even creamy and chickeny flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great base recipe, but like others I added some things to the original recipe...browned the chicken in olive oil, garlic & onion. Once the chicken was browned I sauteed it in a little white wine. I also used fat free cream cheese, 1/3 cup lowfat sour cream, 1/3 cup parm cheese, !/3 cup shredded mozarella. I also sprinkled some crushed red pepper on top before serving. Both my husband and 4yr loved it.

I was pretty pleased with this.  I cooked the chicken in water and bouillon granules, along with some white wine vinegar and fat free dry italian dressing, AND fresh minced garlic.  The vinegar added quite a bit of tang, but I liked it.  Next time I will try plain white wine and some sweet basil.  I also used fresh torn spinach instead of frozen, and grape sized tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes.  Non-fat cream cheese as well...it melted great.

Very nice recipe.  I followed it as written, except I used rotini instead of penne pasta, and didn't use quite as much pasta as called for, so I found it had just enough sauce.

This was very easy to make! I used light herb & garlic cream cheese and added a bit of pepper to add a punch.  Next time I will saute the chicken separately with mushrooms and add it at the end so the chicken has more flavor.  Very good.

This was okay but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't as creamy as I had hoped.  I added a few things to it which seemed to help (a splash of heavy cream and a handful of grated parmesan). This is a good base recipe to play around with your own ideas and ingredients!

Good base recipe but definately needs some improvements.  I added garlic, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. It was still a little too bland for our tastes so I will add some sauted onion as well next time.  Maybe part of the problem was the low sodium chicken broth I used, but I never buy regular.  I also used lowfat cream cheese as suggested but will use regular next time. My 2 1/2 year old did love it though.

The nice thing about this recipe for me was that I already had everything - or I thought I did - ended up having to use feta cheese and a little milk and butter instead of cream cheese, and it still turned out quite good. Would definitely make it again, it seems like a go-to recipe and was very easy.

Quick and easy when I was in a pinch and only had a few ingredients at hand. It seemed pretty bland when I made it so I added fresh basil, oregano, garlic, and a small can of tomato paste since I’m a sucker for tomato based sauces. I didn’t have any penne or rigatoni in my pantry so I used orecchiette and it added some fun to the dish.

I like how it turned out, but I did sauté with garlic,onion,chicken together. Then I add dry or powder chicken broth sauté it about 5 minutes,then add water , cheese spinach. I didn’t have cherry tomatoes so I use regular tomatoes cut them . Taste beautiful!

This is an excellent recipe - relatively quick to make, but tastes like you slaved all day.  I made it pretty much as stated except  I sautéd chopped onion and garlic before adding the chicken.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and doubled the number of grape tomatoes.  Dressed it with some grated Romano cheese when serving.  The sauce was light, not too thick or heavy - perfect for warmer weather. This is company worthy with a salad and some nice crusty bread.

I love the base recipe! I did take the advice of the others who have tried the recipe and "fluffed" it up by using  grilled chicken, adding pimentos, added some chopped onions, chopped garlic, a wee bit of Italian seasoning mix and it was super!

I agree with other reviewers. It’s a great base recipe but it needs some more flavor. I also sauté onions and garlic with the chicken and added pepper and Italian seasonings. I will definitely make this again, it was cheap and delicious

This is a great starter recipe.  I cooked as is, but used fresh spinach and added fresh basil, garlic, and bacon to turn this up to a 5 star recipe.

A huge hit in my home......a weekly must!  I do add some extra spices and have made variations a few times - tried it with shrimp instead of chicken - really good... also tried it with rice instead of pasta - awesome! :)

I made this for a crowd of 20 people.  I did make changes.  Sauteed vidalia onions and garlic in olive oil, then added chicken stock. Added salt, pepper, garlic salt, garlic pepper , and basil. Added cream cheese along with some cream of chicken soup, thickened up with cornstarch, let that simmer, added fresh spinach and tomatoes.  Used Tyson grilled and ready chicken breast strips which was placed in the sauce at the last minute. Mixed sauce with penne pasta and added extra sauce to each individual serving.  Everyone loved it!  I had several request for any leftovers, of course there was none!

I've made this twice- once as written and the 2nd time with a  few changes. Both were great! my 2nd time, I added some diced onion, mushrooms and a bit of garlic (just because I love those 3 thing- ha ha ha) and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen because I had it and it was easier than thawing and draining the frozen spinach.I think I used more cherry tomatoes both times too because we love them.  I got raves for both versions! This is a definite keeper for me and I've saved it to my Favorites. Thanks a lot!

First time making this dish and I plan to make this for my family again!! Of course with any dish you have to add your own flavor of preference.  I seasoned my meat with Lawreys season salt, basil, pepper, onion powder, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 stick of butter.  The taste was phenomenal.

This is a great base-recipe. I tried it at first without cherry tomatoes because I don't like tomatoes. It was still good, but when I tried it again with them, it was fabulous. This recipe got me to like cherry tomatoes. You can definitely make it your own by adding other ingredients. I like sauteing onions and garlic in some oil and then browning the chicken before adding the other ingredients. Will definitely make this again and experient with other flavors.

It was great! The only problems that I had with it was that it was bland and the sauce was thin, but I just salted it and mixed it with the noodles and it was just amazing.

I added garlic, onions, mushrooms and s&p based on previous reviews, and for me it was bland. I ate a bowl but felt like I was eating way too much cream cheese. I will not make again.

This is a very good recipe.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and one larg white onion while sauteing the chicken.  I also use frsh spinach instead of frozen, since that is what I had on hand.  The sauce is very thin, I might try adding some corn starch next time to see if I can get it to thicken up a bit.

Maybe not a totally fair rating as I didn't completely follow the recipe ... I had cooked chicken to use up, so I sautéed onions, garlic, celery, and zucchini in a bit of oil then I added the broth and cooked chicken and simmered it for about 10 minutes. I then added baby tomatoes and fresh spinach after the cream cheese. Just before serving, I crumbled some left over bacon onto it.  My kids enjoyed it. For myself, instead of the pasta, I put the sauce onto a bed of raw spiralized zucchini noodles.

My family loved this. I made some changes based on the reviews. I used canned seasoned diced tomatoes and added salt, pepper, garlic and onions. I also topped it off with grated Romano cheese. In my opinion, the recipe as written is 3-4 stars.

Like others have said nice base recipe.I used my own chicken stock, thickened it with a roux, added only 4 oz cream cheese and flavored with 1/2 tsp ground fennel. Cooked chicken separately in a skillet. Also added sautéed onions, garlic, mixed veggies and spinach. I didn't cook anything in the sauce, did it all separately, then mixed it all together. It was more work but I could control the degree of doneness and maintain the flavors. Next time I will add more fennel.

I agree with Susan about adding garlic, diced onions, chopped mushrooms & fresh basil. before you serve, top with shredded romano or parmesan. I tried the original recipe and then added the tweaks and it was much better with the changes. Make sure you dont add too much garlic, though. I put a bit too much and it turned out tasting like mostly garlic. One tablespoon, MAX!

basic recipe is ok, tweaking is needed. I sautéed the chicken in olive oil with a chopped onion and 2 tbs chopped garlic. I used sun dried tomatoes in stead of fresh, added black olives and capers. hubby loved it. will make again with changes.

So good. Four starts because some modification is necessary. Like other people, I added garlic and onion. Then I substituted canned diced tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano for the cherry tomatoes. The result is amazing.

I absolutely love this recipe! I did take the advice of other reviews and doctored it up a little. I sautéed chopped onions, mushrooms, garlic and the chicken to soften the vegetables. I also added some lack pepper and some Italian anything mix (half while sautéing and the other half with the broth). It tastes wonderful! Added to my recipe box. My husband suggested trying it with shrimp instead of chicken next time. I think it would also be good with broccoli.

My Family loved this receipe and even our very picky 5 year old ate it!! I have made it both ways-with and without the garlic and onion. I used cream of chicken the first time and chicken broth the second time. My favorite combo is fresh garlic, basil and onion and cream of chicken , with about 1/2 as much cheese as what the recipe calls for and of course all the other ingredients. All in all, it's very easy to make and loved by all.

After reading some of the other reviews, I added a bunch of garlic and dried minced onion into the chicken as it cooked. Even my very picky 7 year old loved it! He asked if I'd make it two nights in a row!

Other than seasoning re chicken with garlic, lemon pepper, basil and black pepper, I used the receipt exactly the way it explained and it came out amazing. And I don't cook often but this dish made me feel more confident about trying new things. Thanks!!

This recipe was not very good. After I made the pasta according to the recipe, it took quite a bit of doctoring up to "fix".

Pretty good. I like the healthy spinach, but it does overpower the other flavours a bit. Nicely cheesy - not enough tomatoes in this recipe. Good way to use frozen cream cheese too.

My son Has a tomato allergy so I was looking for a non tomato sauce he would like.  He is four and approved of this recipe...without the tomatoes of course.  I added a generous amount of garlic to the sauce.  I am thrilled he ate spinach!

My family found this bland as is, however, it is a good basic quick recipe that you can spice up to your family's liking.  I added garlic powder, a little salt and topped with crushed red pepper for a more tasty version.  Also, I used Goldbaum's gluten free brown rice pasta.  Delicious.

I loved this!  I added garlic powder, and a small amount of mozzarella and parmesan.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of cherry, only because I didn't have any on hand.  It turned out fantastic!

This was ok. I used chicken stock instead cause it has more flavor. follow the recipe but had to add cheese at the end which made it much better and creamier. Any cheese will do because everything is better with CHEESE. I think I will make this again but will do much doctoring like everyone else did and said. Oh and I forgot I used fresh spinach not frozen.

As written, bland, however, I could see a beginning to a rather tasty dinner, so I dove in. Here's what I did. First, I bought 8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and cubed them. I sautéed a large diced onion in olive oil and butter. Added 12 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, a heaping cupful of shredded carrots, then 6 finely minced garlic cloves. Added the chicken and browned. Then, added 1/4 cup flour and mixed all well. Added about a teaspoon each Kosher salt, Oregano, ground pepper and Thyme. Then added 4 cups rich, homemade chicken stock, heated,  TWO cubed 8 oz blocks of Cream Cheese, let is simmer for 1/2 hour, added the fresh tomatoes, about a cup of frozen peas, a 9 oz package of fresh spinach, then stirred in a 16 oz package, cooked Linguine. Topped with shredded Italian cheese, and this was simply fabulous. I give it a five for inspiration, but as written, only a 3.

Great comfort food dish. I followed other reviewers and sautéed onions and garlic with the chicken (I used chicken thighs) in olive oil. I added salt, pepper, and a no-salt seasoning mix. Once cooked, I added the broth and cream cheese. I used fresh spinach. Delisch.

Easy and quick; but after trying the sauce the way it was written, I had to embellish it quite a bit to get it to my liking. Way too bland as written. Suggestions: saute garlic and onion with spinach, add italian seasoning, along with 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese. It was a hit after that.

The first time I made this, it was ok. To me it needed some punch. So the second time I made it with these changes: I didn't use any tomatoes,I also didn't use any cream cheese. I used fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms, shallots, fresh thyme. I also used chicken leg quarters (that's what I had on hand), that I took off the bone and cooked in the chicken stock. I used heavy cream and freshly grated parmesan cheese and a good splash of white wine. It was to die for!!

I give it 5 stars with my modifications. I added a small amount of roux to thicken it a little more. We like ours a bit thicker. I also didn't have any cherry tomatoes and am not a fan of whole tomatoes. I had petite cut tomatoes that I blended up and added them that way. I chopped fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also used the pasta I had on hand. The chicken I baked in the oven with garlic and onion. Using Italian dressing would be a nice touch as well. It was so good that my youngest child was raving about it a week later!

I made this as is and only added a clove of garlic to the chicken. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen. It was good and super easy and fast to make. It's a great quick family meal and it makes enough to feed 6 adults. I didn't rate it higher because to me, the flavors were good but not great.

We all loved this and it was so easy!  I went ahead and made some enhancements per others' reviews: onions, mushrooms, baby carrots (finely julienned to be hard for the kids to pick out), and a half a bag of fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I didn't have cherry tomatoes, so I diced 2 regular instead.  I used Neufchatel, low fat cream cheese.  I forgot to add garlic with the onions which I intended to do, but I really didn't miss it.  I will make this again.

I did as other reviewers said and browned the chicken in oil with salt, pepper, onion powder, and lots of garlic.  I then simmered that mixture with chicken broth and added the cream cheese and spinach.  I threw in a jar of artichoke hearts (wish I had done 2!), and when done, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Very delicious this way!  My kids loved it.

Like many other people have said, this recipe is good if you tweak it. I followed the garlic and onion sautéed in chicken broth and chicken for closer to 15 minutes and turned it up to high since it was taking forever to cook on med. I added some fresh basil and parmesan cheese to the blend as well as plenty of salt and pepper. Once I did all that it was very tasty. Used gluten free spaghetti and it was delicioso! Husband said "it's a winner", and I concur.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't follow the exact instructions.  I used mushrooms instead of spinach because that's what I had on hand.  I added white wine to the sauce and a little bit of Italian seasoning.  Will be making again soon!

I really liked this recipe. I used some left over chicken, so it was REALLY fast. The chicken already had lots of seasoning, and the only addition I made was some garlic. My kids actually liked it - once they got past the fact that they were eating spinach. 
This is a keeper for me.

I thought this was really good- very easy, quick, and tasty. I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry just because I prefer their flavor so I had to use several more. I cooked the entire 16 oz. box of pasta but that ended up being way too much pasta for my taste, so next time I would cut that down significantly, probably closer to 12 oz. if not 8 oz.

This was good.  I did have to sub 2 things..I didn't have broth, so I used a can of cream of chicken and added water....I also didn't have the tomatoes..so I threw in a handful of mixed veg.  We liked it..and will have it again according to the recipe next time!

This was OK - husband liked it more than I did! The texture was a bit strange for me. It scores a spot in the recipe box, but not the rotation :)

This is definitely a "keeper", says my DH. I did take the advice of other readers and added diced mushrooms, onions and garlic to the chicken while I was cooking it.  I had fresh spinach and used a couple of handfuls, which was just perfect. I had about 1/2 box of whole grain penne pasta and 2 chicken breasts on hand, which was a perfect amt for the two of us. The sauce was a little runny, I guess I should've used less but I think with the leftovers we'll have tonight, it'll be fine. The flavor was excellent, we just put a little pepper on it when it was served. It was nice to use some of my end of the season basil and cherry tomatoes. This recipe was quick and easy and one I will definitely make again.

I made this for my family including my in-laws.  There were 12 of us.  This recipe was super easy to make and so delicious!  It was a hit and everyone requested a copy of the recipe.  Next time I would try to use 1 can of broth and 1 can of cream of chicken to thicken up the sauce.  And some garlic for a bit more flavor.  Otherwise, it was so tasty and total comfort food!

My kids devoured this (I avoided their "what's the green stuff?" question until after they decided that they liked it).  I thought it was really good, but I did add onions and garlic and lots of salt and pepper as other reviewers recommended.  I can imagine that it would be very bland without these additions.  Next time I will probably saute the chicken first and make the sauce separately, then add the chicken in the end with the pasta.  It did enjoy it, and it was very easy.  I will definitely make it again, especially the way my kids loved it.

Quite nice. Nothing amazing, though. I used canned tomatoes not cherry tomatoes, but I followed the rest of the recipe to a T.   Think it was missing something, like garlic... Might try again and change it up a little.

This was pretty good. The only change i made was that i used a can of diced tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes.  We also used parmesan cheese on top.  We will make this again, but it will be a once in a while meal.

I made this recipe with Italian style canned tomatoes, and it was still definitely missing something. If I make it again, I'll try to spice it up with red pepper flakes and/or green onions as others have suggested.

This was wonderful - quick and easy - right up my alley.  I used chicken thighs instead - more flavorful I think, and since the farmer's market had shiitake mushrooms this week I sauteed them in butter and added before serving.  Scrumptious!

We are a midwestern family who have grown up on things like hamburger helper with a side of canned green beans for our veggie. So I'm trying to do better with my eating. I recently bought a bunch of great stuff from a farmers market one of them being spinach that I wanted to use. Now I love spinach with almost anything but getting my husband to eat it is a different story, he's a meat and potatoes guy. So I made this however like others mentioned I made some additions. I added scallions,garlic powder,onion powder,fresh basil, and too many red pepper flakes. So ours was pretty darn spicy. Lucky for me we like spicy so it worked out. It was very very good. Next time I'll try to tone down the red pepper flakes though and maybe add some shrimp I think that would be good too. Plus this is major here, my seven year old actually WANTED to try this but alas, since I accidently made it too spicy she couldn't. So she's excited for me to make it again. That's a winner in my book!!

I needed a quick dish for a catering of 100 people and I thought I would try this.  It was pretty good, although I changed a few things.  I used broccoli instead of spinach and it was fine. I thickened the sauce up a bit with some flour and water. I also felt it needed a bit more seasoning so I used a little more salt, white pepper and garlic powder and it was delicious!

I liked this.  It's definitely something that I will make again.  I substituted about 4 medium sized chopped tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes since I do not care much for them (I think I'll try sun dried next) and also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and seasoning salt to the sauce. The sauce was a bit runny at first but after sitting for about 15 minutes it thickened up nicely.  I would advise cooking the chicken with minced fresh garlic and whatever seasonings you like because this helps give the dish a little something extra.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe, and with those changes it was definately worth 5 stars. I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom instead of chicken broth. I used Rotel tomatoes instead of cherry. I also used creamed spinach as suggested in another reviewed. I added garlic powder and red pepper for a little extra kick. I used linguini pasta because I had that on hand. With these additions I absolutely loved this recipe!

This receipe is fabulous all by itself.  I can't see garlic with chicken at all.  The second time I made it I used sundried tomatoes which gave it a lot more flavor, otherwise I changed nothing.

Sorry.  I can't figure out how this recipe keeps getting such good reviews.  Even "doctoring" it up a bit with garlic didn't make it good.  And we aren't picky eaters. SO BLAND.  Will not make again.

This was very good.  I was a little worried that it would taste like cream cheesed-chicken and pasta but it didn't at all.  I did add some salt, black pepper, and garlic powder.  I also used fat-free cream cheese and Ronzoni Healthy Harvest pasta to make it a little healthier.  We also added some grated Parmesan cheese to it after it was plated.  We really enjoyed it!  Thank you so much.

I also tweaked the recipe because of what I had in the fridge.  I thought it was great - I used alfredo sauce instead of cream cheese and used canned tomatoes with basil and oregano.  Delicious and will use this a regular dinner from now on!

Good but not unbelievable. Easy enough to make. I added salt, it definitely needed some. Didn't use full box of 16oz of pasta. Once it sat a minute the pasta soaked up a lot of the sauce. Used twice as many tomatoes and still didn't seem like enough.

I changed so many things that it probably cannot be called this recipe anymore.  I added 1 large onion and some red peppers and a can of mushroom soup.  And since I had no chicken breasts, I made some chicken and turkey meatballs and used that instead.  Also decreased the cream cheese by half.  But we still loved it, served over spaghetti noodles.

This recipe is fantastic. I took the advice to simmer the chicken with fresh garlic and add fresh sliced mushrooms. I'm on low carbs right now so I didn't even pour it over pasta. It's great on it's own!

Good but missing something to give more life.  Next time will try adding hot pepper (sauce) or spices (oregano, celery, sage).

Absolutely delicious!  I used shrimp, began with olive oil and sauteed onions and garlic, but did everything else the same and it was so well received. Used light cheese as well.  Excellent choice!

This was a very good starter recipe...I took the advice of other reviewers and added minced garlic, onion, mushrooms, and basil to the chicken.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup the the cream cheese and chicken broth (I used soup and broth for more sauce).  It was a hit...Thanks!

I had leftover cooked chicken, and found this; I used reduced-fat cream cheese (neufchatel) and added two tablespoons of pesto - also used fresh mushrooms (sauteed) and fresh spinach.  Very good - will make again.

As did others, I think this is a great starting point. I sauteed onion, mushrooms & garlic in a couple tbsp of butter, added the stock, pre-cooked chicken (in an effort to save time). I would either use fresh spinach or 1/2 the frozen chopped spinach next time, as we found it overwhelmed the dish. Great recipe to play with according to your family's taste. Thanks!

My 6 yr old daughter loved this! I would have rated it a 3, but was a 4 after I doctored it up a bit. Added fresh spinach, steamed broccoli, sauteed onions, fresh basil and garlic. Added some seasonings and parmesan. I guess I did add more than I thought....anyway, I still felt it was missing something, a little bland. This is a great Base recipe and I will use again and play around with other ingredients. Thanks Laura.

I followed the recipie EXACTLY and it was GREAT! The only thing I didnt follow were the times cause every oven is different obviously. My husband said it definetly needs made again and SOON!. I think I may try some variations next time to see if it improves it. I thought that it might be good with some gorgonzola mixed in with the tomatos at the end. Just to give a KICK!

My picky step-boys LOVED THIS RECIPIE!!  I did some slight changes, I used chicken tenders and cut into bite-size pieces. In a stock pot, I sauted them w/a little olive oil, garlic, and Italian seasonings. Then I added the broth etc.  I did't have spinich, so a tossed salad was used, and instead of fresh tomatoes, I had a small can of petite diced tomatoes. Rinsed them off well. Added them at the last minute to warm them and it turned the sauce pink!!  The boys thought that was cool!! BTW, the husband, in-laws, and cousins loved it!  Passed out the recipie to all the women. Great light summer dish that took no time at all, and the best part....ONE POT!! Enjoy!

This is an awesome recipe, I did as the others suggested, browned the chicken with garlic, onion, canned shrooms and then added the broth, spinach and the tomatoes with fresh basil, salt and pepper.  It makes a great meal for entertaining and tastes like it was prepared in a fine restaurant, it came out very well.

This was delish, we used low sodium broth so it needed salt on the finished dish, but otherwise the sauce was great and easy to make too.

Very easy to make and the flavor combination works well. The cream cheese and broth made a nice sauce. I will probably make this again for a potluck event, since it made SO much!

I made this last night and it was delicious! I made a few minor changes and was very happy with the results. I sautéed onion and garlic ( 1/2 medium onion chopped and 1 large garlic clove minced) in about 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Once the onion and garlic started to sauté, I added the cubes of chicken, which I seasoned with salt and pepper. As soon as they started browning I added the chicken stock, spinach, and cubed cream cheese. I only had regular size tomatoes from the garden, so I sliced these in small chunks and added them along with the juice from 1/2 a lemon. This is a great recipe that is fast, easy and very tasty.

This was easy to make but very bland.  I made the recipe exactly as written but later had to add lots of parmesan and salt just to make it taste like something.  I would make it again but I would have to add some ingredients to give this flavor.

If look of finished product and ease of making were the only guidlines for rating then this would be a 5 * recipe.  Add flavor & it drops to a 3 *.  Not bad just not there.  You have to add spices (basil, salt, pepper, onion and garlic)for any flavor at all.  After that it is pretty good but only because you doubled the ingredients.

Yum! I modified it and did it w/o chicken, wasn't in the mood. I had some extra tomato paste so I added that. I used, spinach, mushrooms, peas, carrots. I didn't use fresh garlic and onion- I used powder, that was a mistake.

WOW! this is sooo good and very easy!  I followed others advice and cooked the chicken with onions, garlic, and mushrooms. I also used 1/4 can of diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano, and basil instead of fresh.  I halved the pasta, and cut the amount of fat in half by only using 4 oz of cream cheese... and it came out PERFECT!

Sorry, even with some "doctoring" it's not much better than cream of spinach over pasta...maybe it's just too much cream cheese...

Great great great recipe!  The ingredients are ones that I usually have on hand and it was super easy.  I cooked the chicken in a bit of the broth with some onion, then added the rest of the broth, spinach, cream cheese and a can of diced tomatoes.  Delish!

This pasta was yummy. 
- I browned the chicken pieces a bit first before adding broth.
- I added minced garlic
- I used a drained 14oz can of petite diced tomato instead of fresh

The cream cheese and chicken stock make this have the best sauce - tastes like you worked much harder than you did!  I added onion and more of the tomatoes.  A good recipe to sneak in extra veggies since the sauce is so tasty.

This was really good and very easy.  I added spices to the chicken stock before adding the chicken--Pampered Chef's Chipotle rub and Italian Seasoning and Tastefully Simples Onion Onion.  I also added fresh grated parmesan to the finished product.  It was great!

I feel like it lacked a little flavor.  I addeded the garlic to the chicken while it was cooking and that helped.  It still seemed like it was missing something.  My husband liked it though, so guess it's a keeper.

It was ok we added Garlic, Salt and Pepper & topped it with Romano & Parmesan cheese. We will probably use it again, but definately not without seasoning it

This looked sort of strange but tasted really good. :) I used two huge chicken breasts (weighing maybe 1 1/4 pounds total), a can of vegetable broth, no tomatoes, and I used macaroni instead of penne. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and seasoning salt and then I sauteed it in a little oil. Oh, and I added some chopped onion and a drained can of mushrooms to the chicken while it was sauteeing. Really good! I would advise that you really drain your spinach (I wrap thawed spinach in a towel and twist the towel on either side of the spinach to drain as much water out as possible) if you like a thicker dish with bigger chunks of spinach throughout. I added a little sour cream (maybe half a cup) when I mixed in the pasta because it wasn't quite creamy enough for me. Thanks for sharing, Laura!

I liked the idea of cooking the chicken in broth instead of oil. However, I found this a bit bland and not very creamy. My husband and I thought it was ok, but I don't think I'll make it again.

i didn't have tomatos, so i used a can of tomato puree instead making it a cream/tomato sauce. i also stirred in some shredded cheddar. i love it! like what others said, this is a great base recipe, just play around with it adding whatever you fancy. makes a great healthy meal served over wholemeal pasta. thank you for this!! =)

This was really good.  I did make some changes though.  I used canned Italian style diced tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh.  I also used reduced fat herb cream cheese.  This made a lot of sauce which I then had to reduce, but it was still excellent.  Even my veggie hating husband said it was great!

Very good...I was a little unsure after I had made the sauce, it turn a little green from the spinach and was watery but it turned out to be a wonderful surprise...quick, easy and very good. My husband loved it.
