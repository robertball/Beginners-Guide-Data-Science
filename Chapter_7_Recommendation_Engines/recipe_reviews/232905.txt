Just loved it.  Did not have half and half so used 2% milk.  Will be making again and will try different fruit.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful dish Paula.

i believe this is the right idea but the ingredient list needs to specify frozen berries with sugar or without.  mine were without and it  needed lots more sugar and some more berries for more strawberry taste.  when i was finished tinkering though it tasted exactly like the carnival cruise version.  i think the sweetened berries would be the better choice as they will result in a sweeter mixture and more intense strawberry flavor (just like a macerated berry mixture does)

simple and delicious.  A small serving on a hot summer day is perfect. No changes needed.

We made this for fun and were skeptical about the sour cream but it turned out great we did not change the recipe at all and we are making again today
