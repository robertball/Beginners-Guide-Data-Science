This was a yummy pasta dish, but next time I will do a few things differently.  Next time, I will remove the chard stems all the way up into the leaves and not just chop off the bottom parts - this was my very first chard cooking experience, so this may have been a novice mistake.  The pieces were huge!  Also, if I am unable to find pre-pitted olives, I'm just not going to make this.  I greatly underestimated the work involved in pitting so many olives.

This was wonderful!  I made it with whole wheat spiral pasta and added a 1/4 cup of feta which was a great addition.  I also used dehydrated sun-dried tomatoe rather than oil packed.  I soaked the dried tomatoes in warm water with a few drops of oil for about a 1/2 hour.  Worked great.  This recipe will definitely be coming out for company!

I made this with chopped black olives instead of kalmata, and spinach instead of chard (i'm but a poor college student), and it was UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS!!!!

Since my family isn't wild about olives, I omitted the olives and increased the sun-dried tomatoes to 3/4 cup.  I also topped with some fresh chopped oregano.  Delicious!

I had some Swiss Chard from my local farmers market and needed to fix dinner, so I found this recipe. It was delicious! Swiss chard is rather strong so the other strong flavors in this recipe balance it out nicely and make a really nice combination.

Very good recipe and very easy to throw together. I used Kale instead of chard, but this is a personal preference. I didn't cook the kale first in water. I just added it to the skillet with the Garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and kalamata olives. I added a little of the pasta cooking water and let the kale steam a bit. I also added a can of quartered artichoke hearts with the pasta. The flavor was excellent. Finished with a sprinkle of Pecorino Romano, Yummy!

This stuff is fabulous!  It is super easy, few ingredients, uses Swiss chard...what more can you want.  I actually made it with spinach because that was what was still growing in my garden. I omitted the step of steaming the greens in the microwave since spinach is faster cooking. I used some dried cherry tomatoes that I had preserved this summer, and just added extra olive oil.  I threw in a few black olives because they were in my fridge.  I added a bit of cooked chicken to make it a meal.  Wow.  I made this two times in 3 days! The second time I added a couple tablespoons of pesto.  I found it is equally good warm, room temperature, or cold.

These ingredients are great, but the end result was a bit dry.  Next time, in lieu of sundried tomatoes, I might instead halve Roma tomatoes, roast them with olive oil and some spices like oregano and crushed red pepper, and then add these to the pasta, with half the tomatoes mashed up with their juices, to add some light sauciness to this.

An easy way to pit Kalamata Olives is to hit them hard with the flat side of a cleaver.  The pit pops right out.  Yummy recipe.

I loved this!  I had purchased a bunch of Swiss chard from an Amish vendor and needed a recipe. The dish was quick, easy, satisfying, and very healthy!  I only used 13 oz of pasta, and think the proportions are better this way.

This was pretty tasty! I chose it b/c my family eats gluten, dairy, soy, and corn free (child with allergies) and this recipe fit the bill, once I replaced the cheese with a vegan alternative. I used GF pasta, spinach instead of chard, and adapted the method a bit to make it saucier. 

I sauteed garlic in EVOO then added the chopped tomatoes and olives (I used all kalamata). Once those were warmed through, I added about a cup of white wine and let that reduce. Then I added about a cup, maybe 2, of veggie broth. I put the spinach on top, and wilted it down. Then added the pasta and stirred in the vegan parmesan. The result was a little saucy and delicious! I did find it needed a good bit of salt, probably b/c my 'parmesan' wasn't as salty as the real thing. 

Overall a tasty, simple dinner everyone liked - husband and kids included!

This was quite good. I had swiss chard in my CSA box this week and was looking for a way to use it- this was great. Per other reviewer suggestions I added a can of diced tomatoes to the skillet- this helped to make more of a sauce. I also used feta instead of parmesan. Very good.

Excellent recipe!  I used some leftover sauteed kale, added crushed red pepper and used feta instead of parm.  Next time I'll use 1/2 the pasta and increase the greens.  So good.  Thanks!

I wasn't sure what to do with the rainbow chard that arrived in my organic delivery box, and this recipe was the perfect solution. I added a few canned tomatoes to make it a little saucier as other reviewers suggested, and also substituted feta for parm. Delicious!!

Nothing wrong with chard stems, chop them smaller. Did not microwave, just sauteed in oil then followed with other ingredients. Next time, I will try with kale or spinach and another clove of garlic.

This was a great recipe to start with, but I used it as a basis for my adjustments:  I don't care for Kalamata olives, so I only added a few.  I used black olives instead of green, garlic powder (its what I had), and I added some collard greens that I 'chiffonade'd and steamed separately, alongside the chard.  Lastly, I added a can of diced tomatoes for body, some of the pasta water, and a few tablespoons of cream...this definitely pushed it over the top.

i was a little wary of this recipe at first because I cook with a lot of spices.  I thought it might be bland so I threw in about 1/2 lb. of bulk Italian sausage.  I shouldn't have worried; this recipe was bursting with flavor even without the sausage.  My family deemed it restaurant-worthy!

This dish was really good!  I picked this dish because I wanted a meatless meal for my meat eating family that included pasta but was not the standard spaghetti and marinara sauce.  Pleasantly surprised by the flavors.  They were great and it was not bland by any means which I was afraid of.  My DH wants this as a every week meal.

It was pretty good but not that exceptional.  We did make our pasta from scratch and that added a great fresh component.  We made fetucine as fusili is a bit more advanced than we're ready for. We also added more olive oil to coat the pasta a bit more.  We probably had too much pasta for the ration to be right.

We made a lot of changes but it was a absolute hit with family and company!  Sauteed 1 head of diced fresh garlic and added fresh mushrooms then a pound of diced tomatoes to it.  Was fabulous!  Would give five stars just changed it quite a bit!

A great way to eat Swiss Chard. My kids weren't happy about it, but ate it (yay). My husband and I loved it. I agree that you need to cut the whole stem out. chopping the kalamata olives was also a bit time intensive, but worth it.

Very good.  I left out the chard, which I guess defeats the "...with Greens" portion of the recipe, but I just didn't have any.

I thought this was delicious and I prepared it just as the recipe was written.  I couldn't find the olives already pitted, though, and that part was a bit tedious.

Really liked this. You could easily substitute chard with spinach, but I think the more "assertive" flavor of chard goes well with this dish. My mistake putting too much oil in the dish--2 T. is plenty. Could probably play with the ingredients a bit--I added extra garlic and cheese, as well as freshly ground pepper.

A very tasty dish. I shredded the chard coarsely before placing the leaves in water. Also, I didn't have green olives, so I substituted with a slightly smaller amount of sun-dried black olives. As a preference, I doubled the garlic and added mushrooms. I think I would add more sun-dried tomatoes next time. I used whole wheat fusilli too, because whole wheat is always better for you. I didn't use much cheese because the dish is already so flavourful--it doesn't need much else.

A brilliant low-cal and delicious pasta dish! I made a couple of adaptions, i used already-pitted olives, to save on time, and i used wholemeal Penne pasta instead of fusilli.

Oh and i dont have a microwave, so i just steamed the chard for 10 minutes instead. Thanks for sharing!

Hmmm. I'm not sure what happened, but this was not great. It looked wonderful, but it just lacked that punch of flavor I was expecting based on the ingredients. I will try this again wtih a few modifications and hopefully up my rating. For now, this was just an okay dish...nothing to write home about.

I really liked this recipe because it was easy to make and tasted great. At first I was a bit worried that it would be too salty, but it wasn't at all. I couldn't find chard, so I used spinach and it tasted really good.
