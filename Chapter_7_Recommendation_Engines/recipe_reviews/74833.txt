Very refreshing and colorful! I made a few substitutions that I think put this recipe over the top. I used white kidney beans instead of red, an orange pepper instead of the green (adds sweetness), white onion instead of green onions, I used an orange and a red tomatoe, cut the vinegar down to 1/4 cup and sprinkled it with goat cheese. Perfect!

This is a fresh and flavorful dish.  We love it.  I used less red wine vinegar than the recipe called for (about 1/4 cup) just as a matter of taste.  I also used it half and half with a salsa for another recipe because we ran out of salsa.  It worked well.

Very good! It has a strong vinegar flavor, so I might cut back on that next time. I'm rating it five stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I had to use canned tomatoes with green chilies and cilantro. I had no fresh tomatoes, bell peppers, green onions, or cilantro. Our pantry was running low, and this was the best recipe I could find for what we had. I'd like to try it with fresh ingredients next time, but it was still very good!

I loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as stated for a family BBQ and it's all I wanted to eat all day!  Everyone loved it!  I've been eating all week over romaine lettuce and I'm in heaven.  Can't wait to make it again!

I took this salad to a family event and was asked by more than one person for the recipe.  It was a hit!  The salsa was a very creative touch - will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

A bit vinegary for my liking but I'd definitely make it again.  I liked eating it as a chip dip/salad.

This salad was super easy and so delicious!  It was even better the next day for lunch.  It reminds me a little of the bean salad you can buy that is slightly pickled.  DELICIOUS!

This is a very yummy bean salad! I made two changes, I cut the amount of vinegar in half, and I used parsley and dried cilantro instead of fresh cilantro, because I didn't have any :)I loved it this way...and so did my mom! This is a very filling and healthy salad; thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Great for lunch. I used some extra veggies and added some navy beans. The dressing was nice and simple with just the vinegar and salsa. I would make this again!!

This was sooo easy and amazing!!! I did do whatever else said by cutting the vinegar in half.(1/4-1/3c). Now, I love cilantro so I didn't even measure...I just chopped away and and this was oh so good! Definetly going to continue making ;-)

I made it like they had it but instead of the red wine vinegar I only had raspberry blush vinegar and it tasted great. I will definately make this again. Loved it

I love this recipe. I've made it three times and now bringing it to a family gathering. The only change was yellow and red peppers instead of green.

I used a different kind of vinegar since I don't like wine. Next time I make it and I will make it again, I will use less.

This salad was delicious. My husband also thought so. Added a little cubed cheddar cheese; used parsley instead of cilantro; halved the vinegar as others suggested. Served over lettuce for a light dinner. Also served a crusty bread with it.  Will definitely make this again.

I didn't really care for this.  It tasted like a taco salad without the lettuce, cheese and chips.
