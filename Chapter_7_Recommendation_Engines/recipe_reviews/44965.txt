I am the author of this recipe and I had originally written one large bar of ghiradelli chocolate for the recipe - the really big bars. The 5 oz bar listed was not my intention so it definately has more flavor when you use more chocolate. It helps to use parchment paper to avoid the cookies sticking to the pan as well.

These cookies were a disappointment.  They took a lot of ingredients and a lot of time to make and weren't very flavorful.  If I was making them again, I would not chop a chocolate bar by hand but buy the pre-chopped Hershey chocolate chunks.  Also, rather than coarsely chopping the candy canes (which took a LONG time), I'd grind them in the food processor to a very fine consistency.  Then you still get the flavor without large hard pieces in the cookie that might crack a tooth.  I think this recipe does have some potential if someone is willing to take the time to experiment.

I liked this yummy way to use my broken candy canes, but would have some small changes to the recipe:  First, defintely grease the cookie sheet!  Also, I would add more peppermint extract and maybe more chocolate to give it more flavor.  These cookies MUST be removed from the pan immediately because the melted candy cane pieces harden very quickly.

These cookies were VERY easy to make and did not take a long time, I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about. I put the candy canes in a sealed plastic baggie, then smashed them with a meat "pounder"...so that cut the time. Also, I shaped them into balls then flattened them a little before baking. They are not very sweet though, so I drizzled them with milk chocolate and they tasted great! They look very festive and took no time at all to make!

I'm baking these right now and know that I have a winning new Christmas cookie!  They are delicious and very easy to make.  I did make a few changes to the recipe:  lowered the oven temp to 350 degrees, I had no candy bars so I used mini chocolate chips and I added a few drops of red food coloring.  Also, somebody mentioned that they used wax paper, I think parchment paper will work better ... they didn't stick at all. I think when I put them out for company (if there are any left by Christmas Eve!) I'll dust them with powdered sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe Loren!

Parchment paper. 350 oven, 11-13 min. semi-sweet choc., 1 tsp. peppermint extract.  Crushed candy canes.  Not too sweet, just perfect!  They've made it into my recipe box...we used earth balance margarine and non-dairy choc. chips as we have a dairy allergy in the family

This was not as tasty as I wanted and it was tough to make. You have to get the candy canes small or they melt all over and ruin it. It also stuck to the pan real bad. It was ok but could have been sweeter and maybe use parchment paper.

Few tips:
REMOVE IMMEDIATELY means "immediately!"  These have candy (canes) in them and will stick to your pan like crazy.  Be generous with the non-stick spray.

Crush candy canes pretty finely.  Otherwise, they melt during baking, leaving a big hole in your cookie and causing them to break.

Make cookies smaller than you might think you need to; they spread.  Bonus: You get a LOT of cookies per batch.

I needed to bake mine 11-12 minutes.  Test your first batch.

My DH pronounced them "GREAT!"

Loren's right--we've decided this cookie will be made every Christmas! My kids loved crushing the candy cane (I double ziplocked them). I only made a couple of changes as suggested by other reviewers...1 cup of chocolate chips and on the first batch I made, I added several drops of red food coloring since it seemed mostly white after I crushed the candy cane.  Well, some cookies look fine, others look like open surgery!  So the next batch I didn't add the food coloring and there was still plenty of red flecks in the cookies-a good lesson learned!  The cookies are fabulous and I'm not even a huge peppermint fan-thanks for a fun recipe!

VERY good cookies! A friend and I just made these and were thoroughly impressed. We used the food processor to chop the candy canes, making the canes into a fine dust that we mixed into the dough. For an added touch, we put a Hershey Kisses Mint Truffle on top of each cookie right after they came out of the oven. Added a nice touch to the cookie. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very easy and tasty cookie.
I made the following substitutions: 
1 c. butter flavor shortening sticks plus 6 tsp. water for the butter
1/2 c. of miniature milk chocolate candy bars chopped and 1/2 c. semi sweet morsels for the 5oz. choc. bar.
I also used silpat lined pans to bake them on and had no trouble with sticking.
This one is a keeper.

This receipe was so easy to make.  I did modify it a little.  Like I greased the cookie sheet.  Instead of using 1/2tp. peppermint extract I used 1tp. Also I took three peppermint candy canes and put them in a zip lock baggie and took a hammer to them making them into a powder.   I also reduced the oven tep to 350f.  Very tasty cookies!

Yum, they are a little messy with cooking the candy cane - I used a silicone mat underneath to permit for easy clean up - so I had to a tack on a few minutes until they were done. Great cookies for the neighborhood cookie exchange -thanks for sharing!

UGH!! This was lots of work to make. From the candy cane unwrapping and chopping to chopping up the candy bar (if I ever made this again I would just use milk chocolate chips). I read through the tips about using parchment paper and I used my silicone baking mats -- rotating them letting each batch cool before I removed them. The dough was not that great-- all the flavor comes from the candy in the cookie. I have had better cookies with less work. Everyone likes them but just after all that work. . . but for less work I can get the same kind of reaction with other cookies.  I have come back to add a star -- even though I still think it is a ton of work -- I had great feedback on this cookie to all that I gave it too.

this recipe was a waste of time, and ingredients. We followed it right, and, they turned out with a runny middle, and cooked edges.. bad flavor too. Dissapontment to my daughter, who was very excited to make these. We are now making 1 we know and trust.

Great cookies. Some reviews claim that they aren't sweet enough. I thought they were perfect. My three boys can't wait to make these next Christmas so they can bring them to school and share them with their classmates.

Used 1 1/4 chunky chips.  Probably could have used more or maybe small chips would be better to distribute chocolate better.  Used 1/4C white sugar & 1/4C light brown sugar to make cookies softer.  Didn't have peppermint extract - I think it would have helped to add flavor.  Baked on Silpat mat to avoid sticking.  Cookies tended to stick a bit to the spatula when removing.  Need to continually clean end of spatula.  Overall, a good way to use up those candy canes from the tree!  Maybe with the added mint extract and mini chips I'd give this 5 stars....

I've been making this recipe for the last couple years and it is my primary Christmas cookie recipe. We all love it! I put a bag of milk chocolate chips in and chop the candy canes in the Cuisinart which makes it much easier.

Yummy cookies!
I used almost a whole bag of milk chocolate chipits instead of the chocolate bar and they were great.
I would flatten the dough balls out next time just for a better eye appeal.  A great treat for xmas!

I used the sil pad so that I wouldn't have sticking.  I did add more sugar and it was a pain to chop the candy cane and I guess all and all, I would say these cookies were not worth the effort.  if they were wonderful, I would make them again, but I am deleting this from my personal recipe box

Santa loved these!  There was nothing left on the plate but crumbs.  We used 5oz of chocolate chips instead of the candy bar, and to crush the candy canes, I just unwrapped them, sealed them in sturdy ziploc baggies, and let the kids pound them with plastic hammers.  Better than a food processor.  The candy canes did melt out of the cookies a bit as they baked, so lining the sheet with parchment paper is a good idea. That way, you can pick the melted candy bits off the paper and eat them- yumm.  We will definitely make these again next Christmas.

These were good and certainly fit the Christmas season.  As other reviewers suggested, I baked them on parchment paper at a lower temperature.  I cooled them on the parchment paper and they didn't stick at all.  I about doubled the chocolate but only had mini chips on hand.  In the future, I think I would use bigger pieces, chips or chunks.  My kids liked them and we will probably make them again after the holidays with any leftover candy canes.

We've made this recipe for a few years now with a few modifications.  First..definitely use parchment paper!  We also use the chocolate chunks instead of chips, and bake 12-13 minutes.  We let them sit to cool on the parchment paper approx 2 minutes after removing from the oven & they're a lot easier to get off the pan as the candy canes have then cooled to the point of being a bit firm.  Thanks for a great recipe...we will continue to make these every year.   ;)

I have been making Chocolate Chunk Candy Cane Cookies for many many years with my childre (Its a Christmas tradition) 

Over this course of time I have discovered a few things that work to make the cookes taste better.  Along with the origional rescipe I added my own touch of taste.

1) Parchment paper (I always add a little bit of water under the parchment paper so it sticks to the pan)

2) In a plastic bag crush candy canes until they are really small almost to a dust but not quite (This way the flavour is full but no one has hurt teeth)

3) In a plastic bag crush Hard Chocolate to small or medium chunks (I always use pure milk chocolate from the Bulk Barn - you can buy this chocolate in huge pieces from the Bulk Barn

4) Add 1 cup of sugar

5) After baked Remove from pan ASAP and place on a cooling rack.

Alrighty well thats my two cents......Have a great day all, and Merry Christmas :)

I had a great time making these cookies. I used a couple of regular candycanes but then found it easier to use soft candycanes. Smashing the candycanes did take a bit of time but it was fun and the cookies turned out delicious.

My cookies came out dry and crumbly-but really tasted good!!! I used semi sweet chocolate chunks instead of the candy bar and used peppermint oil instead of extract. Thanks for recipe!

I'll have to try to make these again - My first batch came out with the consistency of dry cornbread and pretty much tasted like flour. I added an extra egg to get some more liquid in them, added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and another 1/3 cup of white sugar. Those came out better but still with a flour taste. I LOVE the idea of these and the chocolate (I used chips for ease) I'll have to give them another shot with all of these 5 stars attached - I must have gone wrong somewhere.

Very Good - I used 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips in stead of the candy bar.  This has been a crowd pleaser time and again!  Also a great way to use up the leftover candy canes from Christmas!

These cookies taste delicious. Here are my suggestions: Instead of 1/2 cup white sugar, I used 1/3 brown sugar & 1/3 white sugar (as per a suggestion to make the cookies softer). SKIP THE CREAM OF TARTAR as it made the cookies cakey and kind of crumbly which isn't my idea of a chocolate chip cookie - the cookies still taste delicious but it isn't the ideal texture. I bought the 6-pack of Hershey's Milk Chocolate bars (45g x 6 bars) and used them all after I chopped them. I needed two packages of 10 candy canes in order to make a cup. Put on parchment paper - so much easier to remove the cookies and an easier cleanup too. Bake at 350 degrees (as per a suggestion)...although I needed to bake mine for about 15-20 minutes opposed to other's that have said 11-13.  I got 75 cookies out of ONE batch, the balls of dough must have been 1 tsp. Will be making these again :)

I origionally made and reviewed these on Dec. 3,2011, I have to add a bit to my comments. First I said these were "Musty".Correction "Verry Musty". I have made them them many times now and am in big trouble, can't keep my hands off them. Like the fact that they are not as sweet as some cookies. I have also ased 1 tsp. peppermint extract instead of the listed amount. I also have started using a whole bag of Dark Chocolate  Chips,YUM. These could be hard to mix, but I use my Kitchen Aid. I also use parchment paper.Would add  five more stars if  I could. Everyone I have given them to loved them also.

This recipe was an easy and delicious way to use up leftover candy canes.  I would definitely recommend baking and cooling the cookies on parchment paper.  

I love the combination of chocolate and mint, however, my husband doesn't care for it.  So I made a batch without the chocolate and they were delicious too.

These are great cookies.  I used parchment paper and lowered the temperature to 350 degrees.  They needed more time than the 8-10 min. the recipe called for though.  I did them for 12-13 min.

This was great for using up leftover candy canes. The cookies turned out pretty well, although several stuck to the pan where the candy can melted out. I used up some leftover Christmas chocolate as well. I would probably just use chocolate chunks next time. Will make again next Christmas.

These just became a holiday tradition.  They taste great and my two kids loved helping, from breaking the candy canes and chocolate to ROLLING the mix into balls readying them for the oven.  I made a couple of changes: 1) I added a teaspoon of Almond Extract, and 2) I cooked them at 350 for 15 minutes.   Also, I divided the finished dough in half, I added a 1/2 cup of cocoa and an additional egg to make a Chocolate Chocolate Chunk  Candy Cane Cookie.  They were all delicious.

I read some reviews and have to say I agree with most. Crush the candy cane in a ziplock bag -- doing in the food processor dulls the blades. Double the mint extract. I always use parchment paper for my cookies makes burning less likely and clean up so much easier. I rolled mine into balls after the first batch -- much nicer look and less candy cane leakage. I love mint cookies but have had a hard time finding a recipe that isn't over powering. This is just the right amount of mint and not super sweet, a nice contrast to some of the other cookies I make for the holidays.

Defiantly lower temp to 350, I cooked mine on upper racks  and rotated after 8 minutes. Total cook time was 16 minutes but the cookies turned out perfectly cooked.

This recipe was easy and tasty.  I took them off my baking stone while they were still very warm and transferred them to a rack and had no problem with sticking.  I'll DEFINITELY be making this crowd pleaser again.

My best advice would be to use 1/2 cup of candy canes instead of 1 cup.  Even though I lined the cookie sheet with wax paper I still couldn't get the first batch unstuck from the pans.  Made a second batch with less candy canes and it turned out much better.  I also lowered the temperature of the oven to 350 degrees on the second batch.
