I made this with Andrea's recipe for steamed buns. I don't eat pork so I can only review based on my experience of cooking, and my kids' opinions. Cooking was relatively straightforward, though I probably could have sliced the pork more accurately. The sauce reduced nicely. I added cilantro and coarsely crushed peanuts as well to serve.
