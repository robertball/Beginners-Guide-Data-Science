Lasagna is always a labor of love.  Making the sauce is task enough but I love how the whole boiling of noodles thing is gone by preparing this with dry noodles.  I also made this the day before to ensure the noodles soaked up the sauce PLUS all the flavors marrying.  You know how leftovers always taste better the day after? Well making this the day before helps with that HOWEVER keep in mind, if you heat this up stone cold it will take 1 hour and 1/2 instead of 45 minutes when it still warm from preparing it.

Real lasagna noodles that bake in their own sauce.  How easy is that?  This is a delicious recipe that will be a new base standard in this kitchen.  The tender pasta and combination of meat, cheeses, and sauce is spot on.   When you cut in to it to serve, it stands on the plate.  The only suggestion I would make is that you adjust the amount of herbs and seasoning to suit your taste.  Other than that, it's a terrific dish.  I'll be looking forward to making this again.

Very easy - especially with "no boil" lasagna noodles plus clean up was a breeze since nothing stuck to the pan! And it was very tasty - perfect for a weeknight meal! I did however make a few changes...I used 90/10 lean ground beef, I opted to use  wine instead of water for the sauce, added some additional Italian seasoning, and I used seasoned diced tomatoes. Overall, very good with warm garlic bread, a fresh garden salad and a nice glass of wine!

I made this with my 6 and 8 year old granddaughters and it was a complete success.  People often wonder why their lasagna is runny and watery - solution, don't pre-cook the lasagna noodles!  Yes, you could use jarred sauce but the kids really enjoyed making 'real' sauce.  Spraying the foil with PAM cooking spray is a great tip, not one bit of cheese stuck to the foil.  This did take about 15 minutes longer to bake - an hour with the foil on and 15 minutes without the foil, 15 minutes to rest.  While the lasagna is resting heat a loaf of french bread in the oven.  Serve with a nice green salad.

Lasagna can be a time consuming dish to make if you want to make from scratch. This recipe takes one step out by utilizing uncooked noodles. I was leery of that since my past experience has left my lasagna a little on the gummy side. I'm not sure if it was this recipe or the noodles in the blue box that start with B that controlled that but either way I was very impressed. The sauce was very juicy before cooking , which is the way it is supposed to be to properly cook the noodles. That had me worried that the top layer of cheese would just melt right into the sauce leaving none to brown up nicely on top. But after removing the foil sprayed with cooking spray I was giddy to see the melted cheese remained where it belonged and not absorbed into the sauce or stuck to the foil! After cooking the additional 15 minutes my cheese wasn't golden enough for me so I turned the broiler on for a couple minutes to brown it up. Between that and using my stoneware pan that really holds the heat this over cooked my lasagna just a tad bit. Next time I will remove the foil a few minutes sooner to finish up. This lasagna was very good and I was impressed with this method. I think the seasonings in the sauce needs to be amped up a bit for me which would include the addition of fresh basil when available or dried when not, but fresh is always tastier to me. I cut back on red pepper flakes and will leave out next time as well as the vinegar (personal preferences). Great recipe I will use again.

This was my first time making lasagna... and it was a complete success! I did add pepperoni to every layer, and on top, and upped the red pepper flakes to a tablespoon because I like a little heat to my food (tablespoon makes it PERFECT). Will make again, and again, and again!

I doubled the recipe and made two, one for my family and one for my brother's family who just had a newborn. Everyone loved it and it even tasted delicious as leftovers. I'll definitely be making it again.

This was very tasty. Made it exact to the recipe and it turned out wonderful!  It was great to eliminate the step of boiling the noodles. Clean up was so easy. I love using Pam Cooking spray and nothing stuck to the pan!

The lasagna was very good.  Whole family agrees this is a keeper recipe.  I could not find the fresh Italian flat leaf parsley so I used dried.  I also add one extra lasagna noodle to fill in the empty spaces.  I was worried that the noodles would not cook properly but thye came out perfectly.  The next time I make this dish I will add a little more Italian seasoning or as other reviewer suggested I will add some Italian sausage.  We enjoyed this dish and will be making it again.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

My family loved this recipe!  In making it heart healthy for my condition, I used ground turkey instead of beef, and part skim milk cheeses.  I also liked how the recipe called for using water rather than egg in the ricotta mixture.  This made for a very low fat, light meal, and didn't leave that heavy feeling in my stomach after eating.  One of the few heart healthy versions that my family all enjoyed.

Love how the noodles cook in the sauce, eliminating one more pan to clean up.  This lasagna cooked up beautifully, with just about textbook perfect texture.  The only thing that I really missed was the flavor that Italian sausage brings to lasagna.  In the future, I would use 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground Italian sausage in the meat sauce and adjust the seasonings to suit our taste.
