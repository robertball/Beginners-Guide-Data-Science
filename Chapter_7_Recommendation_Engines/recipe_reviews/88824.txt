I thought this recipe was great. I just made it 4 days ago right after chistmas day. Everyone liked it. 
It does have a bitter taste, u know, the oysters and chedder cheese together. I can see how not everyone is fond of the flavor. You'd have to really like oysters I guess.
I added an ingredient topping it with Frenches fried onions. And to keep them from burning I set the oven temp about 50 degees less. 
Im making this again, and next time im using Cambells nacho cheese soup instaed of just regular cheddar cheese soup. I want the Zing!

I do like oysters and this recipe.  I did not use the salt which is optinal anyway.  This is another way for us to use oysters which taste so good at this time of year.

This tasted bad with the oysters.If you want to make this omit the oysters.Without the oysters it was passable.

I took the advice of another reviewer and used Campbell's Nacho Cheese Soup. I thought this turned out pretty darn good. It wasn't too much cheese like another mentioned. It was perfect actually. You do have to like oysters to enjoy this though. I am not a big mac and cheese fan and I thought this turned out great so take that for what it is worth.

I posted this decades old recipe my late Mom came up with. I don't add the salt listed in the ingredients...there is enough in the soup and cheese. This recipe isn't for everyone but I love the combination of ingredients and how the oysters integrate into the casserole. I use 2 jars of small oysters ideally. I fix it for me and my 100 year old Dad. Feel free to modify it as desired. I like adding mushroom, onion, garlic etc.

Made this the other night, swapping the bell pepper for mushrooms, came out pretty good if you like oysters.

Excellent recipe! I made a few substitutions,  including using mushroom soup, Velveeta, and milk instead of shredded Cheddar cheese, and cheese soup. Also left out the green pepper and substituted regular onion for the green. All with excellent results!
