This is a simple and delicious recipe. Once I tried it, I was also able to riff with the flavors to use in potato and ramen dishes.

Made this with leftover medium grain white rice and doubled the recipe. That, along with sunny side eggs on top (humanely raised), made a perfect dinner for 2+. It could feed more if also served with a side dish. Absolutely delicious! Boyfriend and I immediately agreed it's a"make again "... and soon. This recipe is going in my regular rotation. It was fast and easy. Perfect weeknight dish.

I usually don't like kimchi, but this flavor combination with rice and the sauces coming together really made everything delicious! Definitely healthier than what I usually eat and it definitely tastes how I imagined!
