Due to amount of chicken sold in the market I make this twice a week and have been doing it for months (possibly over a year now).

I double the seasoning salt, cumin, chili powder and cumin. I use Extra Sharp Cheddar (shredded off the block) instead of Pepper Jack cheese. I use a Large Anaheim Pepper and Large Jalapeno Pepper for each serving as well as some extra onion. I use Daisy Light Sour Cream instead of regular and always use Swanson Chicken Broth. For Pico De Gallo I seed 1 Large Jalapeno and 5 Large Roma Tomatoes and dice them up along with about Half a Medium Yellow Onion, diced and about a Quarter Cup of diced Cilantro. I layer chips on the plate and put the mixture then Pico De Gallo then continue until all the mixture is gone.

You can't ask for much more, quick, easy and flavorful. I used shredded chicken with a little extra diced jalapeno.

Have made this twice and loved it.  Made it with only jalapeno and no other hot spices to make it more kid friendly.  Was popular with the group I shared it with.

No changes (surprise!) and this was EXCELLENT. Perfect amount of spiciness for my family of teens and adults.

I thought the Chicken Enchiladas Nachos looks and sounds very yum. I'll definitely make it. I'd like to double it up, and I'm curious or perhaps making an suggestion. You always do great job  mentioning the nutritional valves, including calories and fat PER serving, but I never see the amount of servings each recipe makes. For some, like the Artchoke Heart au gratin, is pretty self explanatory. I'm assuming since it makes 1w halves that it is 12 servings, but some recipes call for 2 as being one serving. With this particular recipe, I'd really like to know the number of servings, especially when I want to double it. For that reason only, I gave you 3 stars, otherwise I would have gave 4, and when I finally figure out how many servings and make, my guess is I'd be giving you a whopping 5.

I doubled the recipe and made this dish for my family for dinner and my son loved it - even went back for 3rds. Also made for a potluck at work and several people asked for the recipe. I made no changes to the recipe and it was perfectly seasoned!
