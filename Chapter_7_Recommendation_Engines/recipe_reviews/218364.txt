I've never made a sangria before and didn't know what it should really taste like. I did the recipe as close as I could to begin with except I used Zinfandel instead of Rose' because I couldn't find any in 4 stores here in Hawai'i. After the initial double recipe was made I knew it wasn't going to be enough, so I add 1/2 bottle of leftover  Merlot, 1 bottle of Chardonnay, another 1/2 cup of vodka, and 2 extra cups of pineapple juice. The party was BYOB, but the punch bowl was empty before the party was over! Was asked several time where the recipe came from.

This is delicious!  I made it exactly as written except I doubled it.  Took it to a party and it was a huge hit. This is my new favorite drink recipe. YUM!

We made a double batch (following directions exactly) of this last night for a birthday party. Very nice! As has been mentioned, goes down quite easily! Several notes for y'all: 1) Doubling the recipe doesn't necessarily mean doubling the fruit. Next time: 2) I might skip (or at least lessen) the simple syrup as it made it a tad too sweet for my personal taste, especially since I plan to 3) make ice cubes out of the remaining pineapple juice that I will add to the Sangria at the last minute; 4) and I will serve it in a punch bowl so that my guests can get a couple pieces of fruit with each cup. 5) A 9-oz. clear plastic cup, short and wide at the top, is the perfect sized cup to enjoy this delightful Sangria at an outdoor gathering. Yum! [If this matters to you, because of the pineapple juice, the Sangria is cloudier in appearance than the photo might indicate.]

This was the first Sangria I ever made and it was amazing! I doubled the recipe and the guests loved it. Perfect for a summer BBQ. Thanks for sharing!

My ratings is based on the comments I received at the party I took it to. I took 1/2 gallon to a party of 40 people.  It was gone within 15/min.  Several people asked me for the recipe. The thank you note I received from from the hostess said it wsd "amazing".  I left out the simple syrup.  I thought that would make it too sweet.

Very tasty! I made it for a party of 25. Although not everyone had one, I tripled the recipe. I also made my own simple syrup on the stove from a recipe that I found online.

This was the HIT of our party!  I multiplied this recipe by 6.  We added sliced strawberries and didn't do a true 1 to 1 with the raspberries.  When we needed to make more, we didn't need to add more fruit.  This is my new favorite drink!!

I made this for a party and it was a hit!  I made two batches but ended up running out and getting more rose to make 4 because people were drinking so much of it! I've made a few sangrias before, but they all required overnight soaking.  This one was quick and easy without sacrificing flavor.  I did not include the simple syrup as many of the commenters suggested - instead I topped it off with a little bit of Orangina for sweetness & carbonation.  I made two batches in one bowl, and then once it ran low I would just refill with the rose, triple sec, pineapple juice & vodka without adding more fruit.  That worked great!

We followed the recipe exactly, and were very disappointed. We used good ingredients, although it was an inexpensive rose. The flavor of the vodka overpowered the rest of the ingredients.

I really like this recipe. I use a cheap rosé wine that's about $12. The only thing I do differently is I use a pineapple vodka in place of regular vodka. It makes it more fruity or tropical tasting. I also didn't want to have the alcohol from the vodka over power the taste of the fruit and wine. It's delicious. I've doubled this recipe as well. I think it would be good with any fruit flavored vodka. I'd like to experiment with different flavors of vodka or add different fruits to see how it turns out. Yummy!

Used Barefoot Sweet Red Blend for the wine, a shot (ish) of grenadine and an extra lime (and maybe a little extra vodka). Cut the fruit and put into a bowl. Left the little bit of water from washing the raspberries and poured a shot (ish) of vodka mixed with patron citron, and left in freezer while the other mixture chilled. Fruit had a nice ice glaze when I added it. Turned out pretty tasty!

Overall, it was a light beverage for a retirement party.  I loved the fruit in it - I used raspberries, green grapes halved and a large peach.  I'd use more peach next time.  I would eliminate the simple sugars.

Followed the recipe exactly. Used a dry rose (2018 Le Grand Noir). Overall I thought this was a bit too sweet, and I wouldn't add the simple syrup next time. But my friend loved it as is.

I made this exactly like the recipe said and even made my own simple syrup. It came out great although I would probably leave out the simple syrup next time I make it to cut down on the sweetness a little.

Very tasty! It was a big hit when I served it. I recommend muddling the citrus fruit before adding to the liquid base. You get more juice flavor, and the fruit still looks nice for garnish. I was a little short on simple syrup, so I added some sugar and it works fine.

This is unbelievably delicious! I've made it for any number of summer events, and can't wait to make it again this season. 

Make sure you add the juice, vodka and triple sec because I've accidentally left one of those out and it's just not the same. Of course you can adjust the amount of juice and vodka to make it stronger or weaker to your taste. I don't add the simple syrup, because it already seems plenty sweet to me.

Try this recipe! You and your guests will all be so glad you did!

Delicious, but skip the syrup as it is sweet enough with out it. The second time I made it, I added some club soda for bubbles - turned out great.

Well, you don't really taste the vodka, but it's a little sweet, which keeps it from 5 stars. Very easy to make. Unless you have triple sec and vodka already, it's going to be expensive. Still worth it! Enjoyable. Worth a try.

I made this yesterday for my book club post-Christmas Christmas party.  It's light, delicious and smooth.  It was  happily enjoyed by one and all.  The only change I made was to use white zinfandel in lieu of rosè and a bit less fruit.  Don't skimp on the raspberries though...

This is our second attempt at making sangria. This turned out better than our last attempt for sure. Was very good. Will definitely be making it again!
