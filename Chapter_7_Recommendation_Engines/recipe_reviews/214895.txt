This is exactly the pineapple mango salsa I have been looking for!!  I while ago my husband & I went to our favourite fine dining restaurant and they served their panko crusted tilapia with this salsa...the grilled flavor of the pineapple really makes the difference!  Thank you!

Was looking forward to trying this with red snapper I was preparing for dinner.  Made as directed and found it to be just okay.  Salt & pepper improved somewhat, but none of my family would do more than try a couple of bites. Will not make again.

I made this salsa to go along side "Marinated Pork Tenderloin" also from this site.  I cut the recipe in half and from there the only change I made was to add the zest of 1/2 lime and the juice from the whole lime - I also added salt.  The end result was delicious and went with the pork very well.

This was my first time making a fruit based and bbq'd salsa.  I threw all of the ingredients, minus the mangos on the grill.  It turned out really well, good flavor, lots of compliments.

great with Jerk Chicken.  Also - recommend using a little apple-wood smoke when grilling the pinapple and peppers - added a nice flavor.

I added a lot more pineapple and only used half the mango.  I enjoyed the fresh citrus taste, but could only eat so much of it.

Grilling the pineapple really added a nice smoky flavor to this salsa that I enjoyed.  It went well with our meal.

Served this salsa over spicy grilled shrimp and wild rice - it was delicious. The flavors were nicely balanced - sweet with a bit of a kick to it. I made it about an hour before serving, next time I will be sure to prepare in advance to let all the flavors come together more.

Loved this fruit salsa.  Left out the jalapeno, but kept everything else in.  Had never tried rubbing the skin off peppers.  Didn't work the way I expected, so I'll have to try that part again.
