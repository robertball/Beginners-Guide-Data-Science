Frankly, I was amazed how delicious this was. Added chopped tomatoes, used Colby Jack cheese and Mrs. Dash tomato, basil, garlic instead of salt & pepper. Forgot to dip in salsa, but didn't matter!

Fantastic!  I have never put mozzarella on my quesadillas— it was excellent. I only added some salsa and used a little garlic aioli for dip. Thank you!

Simple and very tasty. I should add that I haven’t made the tortilla part yet, just the filling, but boy is it good! I added a chopped scallion to the onions (had one and needed to use it) and a bit of garlic powder and cumin (because I love those flavors). The folks at work will be jealous!

I loved this! I made it exact, except I used smaller tortillas, so it made 4 instead of 2. It was delicious. I had a side of corn on the cob (from which I got an easy way to get the husk off from this website). It paired perfectly. I will definitely make this again!

A great blend of flavors with the mild creaminess of the melted mozzarella cheese allowing  the flavor of the black beans to come through.
