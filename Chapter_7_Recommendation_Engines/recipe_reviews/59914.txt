Fantastic!  Perfect for a hot summer day, and easy to make.  I skipped the sugar, the mangoes I used were very ripe and were sweet enough on there own.  I found that the soup tasted a little too much like a dessert, so I added some fresh grated ginger (about 4 tbsp.) and it made all difference!  I also made a lemon cream reduction to swirl on top and served with a sprig of mint.  I would reccomend this to anyone!

While I adore this recipe I only make it as is when I am using the soup as a dessert course.  As a first course to a savory meal (this is AWESOME as a starter to a spicy, coconut curry)I omit the sugar and add fresh grated ginger and a pinch of salt.

Wow, wow, wow! Life is very good when you can eat this. So quick and easy. Guests will think you have slaved. I didn't have half and half so I used straight heavy whipping cream, could have probably mixed it with milk but I took one taste and just kept pouring and pouring. Made a lot more than I expected probably due to the heavy handed pouring. Lovely to serve.

I love this recipe.  It is the perfect blend of sweet from the mango & tart from the lemon.  I used the half and half as the recipe calls for, but I think I will try it with sour cream or plain yogurt next time just to cut calories.  I also sprinkled a few blueberries on top.  Even my 14 month old daughter loved this.

This almost the exact recipe that my wife uses. She does add the bluberries and I sometimes add a little hot sauce. This summer I even plan to try some in the ice cream maker.

Yum!  I made mine w/Fat free sour cream and added some ginger.  It tasted great but a bit too lemony.  Next time I might decrease the lemon and increase the mango.  But overall a great recipe and wonderful when paired with fresh fruit.

I used fat free half-and-half and Splenda instead of sugar, and everyone loved this soup as a dessert course.

Excellent!  I cut the sugar down to about 3 tbs. and used jarred refrigerated mango that was on sale.  Also followed the advice of another reviewer and added a few tbs of grated fresh ginger root- delish! :)

This recipe was pretty good if you want more of a lemon soup. I thought that the lemon zest over powered the flavor of the mango. I was disappointed.

This is very good.  I subbed 2 containers lowfat plain yogurt for the half and half to make it a little healthier.  The lemon I used was very large and combined with the sourness of the yogurt I had to use extra sugar, about 1/3 C.  Very good I will make this again when I have extra mangoes around.

I found a great price on mangoes, and had "soup" in mind when I bought them.  This recipe was good.  The lemon really comes through.  It is screaming for some sort of garnish--something to add texture.  Yummy for summer.

YUM YUM YUM!!!! What a delicious soup!, very fresh and tasty, the only change I made was that I added 1 Tbsp of hot sauce in the blender, salt and a bit of ginger and I served it with a swirl of Tabasco sauce, fresh chopped strawberries 3 mint leafes and fresh pepper, so not only was delicious but looked awsome!, thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious, but doesn't need all the sugar. I used soy milk and it was really yummy and still creamy. my husband loved it too, but said it was a dessert.

Pretty good, but would have been better if I had picked really, really ripe mangoes.  I have never made anything with or eaten mangoes, so I had no idea how to pick them at the grocery store.  Lesson learned!

The flavor of this soup was great! But I couldn't get past the "hairs". I wonder if there is a way to get rid of them? This was my first time having mango that wasn't from a jar. Unless I can eliminate the "hairs" I won't make this again, or anything mango!

I made it with nonfat vanilla yogurt and it was delicious! Very refreshing summer treat. We had it as an appetizer, but it's sweet enough to work as a dessert as well. It's quite quick and easy to make, except for the pain in the butt that is peeling mangos... Next time I'm going to try using frozen mangos.

This recipe has written is too sweet and lemony for our tastes, and we like lemon. I like sweet, but with diabetes, that's out unfortunately. I wondered what I could do to make this more to our liking. I took the mangoes and the half and half and added a couple of dashes of ginger (ground) and a couple of dashes of cinnamon. Blended in my blender. Served cold for lunch. It was a huge hit. Will make again.

I found the pairing of mango and dairy a bit odd, but a number of members of my family really liked it. I didn't have half and a half so I used half sour cream and half milk.

Really liked this soup, but found it a little bland.  I added fresh minced chili pepper (to taste) and fresh mint leaves julienned for garnish. A bit of fresh squeezed lime juice sets the flavor nicely.

Sensational! On a hot evening as a start to a formal dinner. Just don't use the sugar if you are serving it as as a first course.  I tried adding powdered ginger ..it didn't work for me.  I will try grated fresh as recommended next time

A fantastic dish!  Next time I will drop a few sprigs of fresh mint on top for a garnish.  The flavor was great, almost like a lemon meringue, which makes me want to adapt this for a pie filling.

This was a sweet and tangy recipe that I will freely admit I licked the bowl when done!

THIS IS SO GOOD! I didn't have any half and half so I used Rich's Whip whipping cream + milk (and left out the sugar.) I also added a few strawberries and some blueberries.

My husband, who typically doesn't go for the chilled fruit soups, loved this - as did I!  My kids, however, who love the strawberry and cantaloupe soups didn't like this. Go figure!  The lemon really enhances the mango flavor.  Would be great to substitute the half & half with whipping cream and throw it in the ice cream maker.

I love this recipie!  I made it last night and my daughter and I went crazy over it.  The only small change I made is I blended in a few strawberries.  We have more mangos falling off the tree than we can really handle, and this is a perfect summer soup so I will definitely be making this again!!!

I made this with coconut milk instead of the cream. I poured it into a wide shallow container, froze it, and shredded it with a fork like a granita. With whipped cream and coconut chips on top it was yummy. I might pull back on the lemon juice for my personal taste but overall a keeper.

Delish! I served it before the meal like soup but it easily could be a served for dessert instead.
