I make my own vanilla extract and this is a great way to use the vanilla beans a second time. Once I take the vanilla beans out of the vodka I allow the beans to air dry overnight and then throw them into sugar. I then have vanilla sugar to use in baking or for adding to coffee/tea.

A good alternative to some vanilla beans I had in my cubbard. I use it in recipes that call for vanilla extract and sugar. I use it in my coffee because it's a nice lean alternative to loaded with calorie vanilla coffee creamers. I just add a splash of milk with a spoonful. Thanks for sharing!

This beats store-bought vanilla sugar. I made these as gifts and kept one for myself. I donâ€™t really care for vanilla and still loved it in my coffee. :-) Thank you for the recipe.

Quick to put together.  Placed in cute little jars tied off with string and added a spoon.  Made a great neighbor gift for Christmas.   Will be making again.

I have no idea what I'm going to do with this sugar, but I had a vanilla bean I'd mostly scraped out for some vanilla ice cream, so I thought I'd give this a try.  After a week, it really does taste like vanilla, and it smells wonderful!  Great use of a leftover vanilla bean.  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

Love the idea of this.  It seems like it could be made with stevia or Splenda instead.  Has anyone tried it?
