So good! My husband and I love Italian sausage & peppers, so this recipe just hit the spot for the two of us after a long day at the zoo with the kids. I super simplified this by using a bag a pre-cut, frozen tricolor peppers & onions, and a bag of pre-cooked, pre-sliced Italian sausage. I sauteed the veggies & meat in a large skillet until tender, then added in the delicious Classico sauce and stirred it all together until hot & bubbly. I went with Paula's suggestion and only used a bit over half the jar. This recipe takes minimal effort, but you get maximum results. I served it with some crusty bread and even though it serves four, hubby and I just kind of pigged out. This would also be amazing served over top of some rigatoni.

One of our favorite meals is Italian Sausage and Peppers, and this recipe was great-very saucy. Maybe next time we'll use half the sauce. Other than that, excellent on rolls (we added a slice of provolone on top)

It was just like the Italian sausage from the State Fair only better! Used Johnsonville Sausages. Saucy, flavorful, and a hit at our house! Will be making again!

5-19-2016  ~Whether you make this with the sponsored brand of sauce, another brand or, as I did, your own tomato sauce, you’re going to like this.  I added some mushrooms because I love them and had them to use, and served this tossed with spaghetti.  One suggestion from an Italian who knows a little of what she’s talking about, resist the urge to drench this (and that means your pasta too!) in too much sauce!

I loved the versatility of this recipe. Prepared as is, it's great over your favorite pasta. If you reduce the amount of Classico sauce,  it makes an awesome sandwich with your choice of hard or soft roll. Delicious!!!

Sausage, peppers and onions are always a hit in this house.  My husband said this was as good as you get in any Italian restaurant.  I served it over pasta but it would be equally good on a roll.  I used Johnsonville sausage so I needed to add a little olive oil because they are not as fatty as other sausage.  It was delicious.

Used bulk sausage and an extra leftover pepper;  turned out well, but it was better with a big sprinkling of sharp cheddar melted on it in the microwave.

For health reasons I can't have sugar or flour, so I'm always looking for recipes that will be good without them. Since I couldn't have the bread I added more onion and bell peppers. Also we like things spicey so I used hot italian sausage instead of the sweet. I thought this tasted really great.

This was a hit. I also added mushrooms and used frozen tri-colored peppers. The peppers added a bit of water which I had to drain. Another recipe I looked at recommended adding Italian seasoning and red cooking wine. I only had cooking sherry so used that instead. Everyone had seconds!

I will make this again. I didn't make any changes. I did serve it over leftover rice and it was delicious. Very tasty.  I will try over pasta next time.

Easy and delicious. Took everyone's advice and used half the jar. Served it on Hawaiian bread rolls and it was excellent.

Love it. Simple and easy to make. Only thing I did differently was to use 4 cloves of garlic, but I always double or triple the garlic in a recipe (can’t help myself). ??

YUM!  This is one of our favorites!  My only change was to use garlic salt as I didn't have any fresh garlic.  Hubby loved it!  It was gone by the time I remembered to take a photo!   I served it on Italian rolls.  Thank you Alesha for sharing!

Italian Style Sausage & Peppers  Haiku: "Didn't serve in rolls. Love sloppy, rustic sausage - this dish is a win." This is fantastic, and we ate it alongside a roasted cauliflower "steak" that beautifully absorbed the sauce. Classico's, well, classic tomato and basil sauce is a simple, unfussy foil to the delicious fatty goodness of the sausage. Mwah, yum!

Loved this meal!  Along with the colored peppers, I added two jalapeño peppers, as we like this dish spicy.  I had an opened jar of spaghetti sauce in the fridge, and that is what prompted me to make this recipe.  I only used about 14 oz. of sauce, and it was plenty for us.  This was served over whole-wheat pasta rather then in a roll, Italian cottage cheese and garlic bread.  Thank you Alesha Walker, for sharing your recipe!

This was good. I also used about half the sauce and it was just right. Served with crusty bread. I think I'll try it on a roll next time.

Delicious!!!! I followed recipe exactly. Except I cut the sausages on half instead of bite size.
