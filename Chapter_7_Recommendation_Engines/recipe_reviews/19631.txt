I didn't have orange juice, so I added some honey instead.  Turned out perfect!  You can adjust this marinade any way you want and it will likely turn out great.

Excellent sauce!  I stumbled across this recipe when I was looking for a recipe to dress up store bought teriyaki sauce.  After reading the reviews, I tossed the store bought marinade in the trash.  I changed the recipe slightly by adding 2 more cloves of garlic, 2 tsp of minced candied ginger, and 1 tbl of cornstarch.  I microwaved it on high for 3 minutes and then poured it over skinless, boneless, chicken breasts that I had pounded flat.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  The sauce thickened nicely, and I had plenty to put on top of the chicken.  I served it all over steamed jasmine rice, and topped it with fresh cilantro and sliced green onions.  It had a wonderful flavor and so much better than any other teriyaki that I have had.

I added some chopped green onion. I let my meat (beef) marinade for almost 24 hours before cooking it. This was good but I think it's missing something. Maybe rice vinegar? I'm not sure.

I used this with chicken breasts I put on to marinde at lunch time.  They were perfect.  I used the orange juice as called for and found just a hint of the fruit taste in my meat, they were not too salty and came out perfect.  I served with potatoes and grilled veggies.  Given the ease of this marinade I am sure I will be making it again.

This marinade worked out great!  I used it with chicken and put it on kabobs with bell pepper and pineapple chunks.  Grilled nicely on our camping trip.  I use it all the time now...and its so easy too! Thanks Denyse!

This is the first Teriyaki sauce I have made and it will be the only one I make in the future!  I did all the suggestions Denyse has made - marinated overnight, added fresh ginger, reduced the sauce (without using cornstarch, however) and garnished with sesame seeds.  I marinated both chicken and beef...really really good!  Thank you Denyse!

This is awesome!  I have done of both chicken and beef on the grill.  Marinade for 3 hours if you like alot of flavor. If I dont have the OJ, I substitute with lemon and taste just as good. I also add a little ground ginger.

Very easy and tasty, and the common ingredients are so convenient...I didn't even have to go to the store. :) I made skewers and grilled them on the George Foreman...everyone in the house liked them!

I marinated this overnight and made and had tender, tasty chicken the following day. I plan on trying this with pork in the near future.

This is our new favorite sauce for pork chops- haven't tried it on anything else yet. I put them in to marinade in the morning, and they seem just right at dinner time. The kids really like this sauce.. they pour it over their macaroni, potatoes, and anything else on their plate with it!

This was AMAZING! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because I changed it up a little bit. I added about 1/2 cup bourbon, about 3 teaspoons of cinamon and 2 teaspoons lemon juice. I made extra sauce to reduce down and poured it over my mashed potatoes and green beans. It was perfect, and after just making it, my family wants me to make it again soon! I highly recommend pork chops, grilled, like I did. Yum! I was very happy I found this!

This is the easiest and best marinade I have ever made.  I use it all the time on flank steak/skirt steak then grill them.  Rave reviews all the time!!!  The best part is that I always have these ingredients in the house.  I am not a big fan of traditional teryaki sauce but this is awesome!!

This is a great and easy marinade. I only marinated my chicken breasts for 2 hours and they were very flavorful! I would suggest only using a little bit of pepper for taste if you make the marinade into sauce. Using the full teaspoon was to spicy for my 8 year old.

Didn't have much flavor, marinated for 4 hours.  Used flank steak.  If I use this again, because it's easy, I will try to marinate overnight to see if the flavor is maximized.  I did, however, boil the marinade and poured some over each serving, which helped to give some flavor.  Otherwise, the meat alone was flavorless.

Delicious!  We love this marinade.  I doubled the recipe and used half orange juice / half lime juice.  It was tangy and tasty.  After marinating the chicken all day, I let the marinade simmer on the stove so that we could use it over our rice.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is excellent with chicken kabobs.  I use premium dark soy sauce that you find at an Asian grocery and add lime juice.  Yum!

I used this on an inexpsensive roast that i sliced thin and made into kebobs after marinating.  WONDERFUL!!  my husband said it was one of thosse meals he wished he could never get full.  Making a sauce with the leftover marinade and spooning it over the done meal was excellant!!!

Marinated 4 half-inch boneless chops in this for 2 days and cooked them on the George Foreman for a little under 3 minutes.  I accidentally forgot the pepper, and I'd definitely include it if I used this recipe again.

Fabulous marinade. I doubled the garlic and added a bit of rice wine vinegar to give it more kick- but it was really good even without my alterations.

Perfect marinade for pork loin!  I ended up marinading it for 24 + hours & was afraid it would be too strong but it was great! I cooked my loin on the grill by indirect heat.  The meat was tender & the taste was suttle!  I did not change anything & wouldn't! Yum!!!

Very good.  Fast to put together and pour over skinless/boneless chicken breasts to cook the next day.  I had a late start so it all  stayed in the fridge and put on the grill tonight.  Flavor was excellent and the chicken super tender.  A great way to make a very simple, low fat, delicious meal.

Super easy to throw together if you are out of teriyaki sauce. I marinated tuna steaks in it for an hour and then grilled them...very good.

This was a huge hit at a family (large) dinner!  I used chicken breasts, marinaated them in the teriyaki for about 3 hours, and basted them with it while grilling.  Everyone flipped over them!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely FABULOUS!!!  I used it on some thick boneless pork loin chops.  I used lime juice as I didn't have orange juice.  I prefer lime anyway.  I marinated for 4 hours and grilled.  This is one that I will be using often and would like to try it on chicken, flank steak.....  This is a definite keeper!

Perfect! I absolutely loved this Marinade.  I marinated chicken for about 10 minutes and pan-fried it with the marinade. It tasted super and was very easy to make. I would definitely make it again.

It was very good and easy. Not any weird ingredients either. I didn't expect it to be so orange-y.
