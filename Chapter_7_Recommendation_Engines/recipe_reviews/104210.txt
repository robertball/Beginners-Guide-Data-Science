Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved this! I used a gourmet jalapeno salt (sorry Morton's) & I only used 3 salmon filets (cooked them inside on a grill pan)...making all of the salsa. I deseeded a jalapeno & added it to the salsa but made no other changes to the recipe. Served the salmon on a bed of Lemon Thyme Rice & I drizzled a bit of mango vinegar (it's a Michael Chiarello recipe from foodnetwork) around the plate & over the salmon, then topped the salmon w/ the salsa & garnished w/ a sprig of cilantro in the rice. It was soo beautiful.... although I wish I had thought to serve it on a bed of greens instead of the rice. The mango vinegar would have made a nice dressing. And this would have been the perfect meal to serve a cold fruit soup as a first course with....wish I had thought of that as well. For dessert, I served Sangria-Spiced Melon (from allrecipes) in wine glasses...it was a great finish to a great meal. I will use the leftover salsa tonight in chicken wraps.

This is the first recipe I have reviewed, but it was so good I wanted to take the time.  All of the flavors worked great together.  The pickiest eaters in my family enjoyed it.  I am not even a big mango fan myself, but I ate all the leftover salsa. I served it with brown rice, and we all felt very good about eating such a healthy meal.

my local grocery did not carry hot salt, even though I could have sworn i  have seen it there...nonetheless, i mixed hot sauce with salt and pressed it into the salmon on both sides. I also put some fresh cracked pepper on too, and also some sea salt. I cooked for 7 minutes each side. IT was the first time EVER that I nailed salmon! And the mango salsa is to DIE for!!!!!! LOVE it! I will definitely make this again. I feel like a chef.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I served this at our dinner club and everyone loved it - including the teenagers and the "single digit" crowd! Very easy, very tasty!

This recipe was delicious!  I didn't have any HotSalt so I added one chopped jalapeno to the salsa instead.  I also cooked the salmon on the stove, spraying the fish with Pam Olive Oil Spray and sprinkling it w/ a little garlic salt.  I served this with steamed veggies and rice.  This is definitely a keeper.  THANKS!

Wow. This recipe has met the vital code earning for it a place in my "Tried & True" files...it pleased my finicky spouse! But who has time to grill? I pan-fried my salmon. And, sorry Morton, I didn't have your fancy "Hot Salt". I finely minced a jalapeno pepper (after seeding it) and threw that in the mix. I served the salmon with its wonderful salsa alongside good old Rice-a-Roni. This one will be served regularly in this house. It is very satisfying without being too filling. Thank you, Morton!
