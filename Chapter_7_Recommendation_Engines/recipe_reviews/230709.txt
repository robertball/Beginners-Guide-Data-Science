These almonds would be great if the sugar coating would stick to the nuts!  (My photo shows the sugar mix just spooned on top of the nuts.)  I wondered how that was going to work when they were tossed onto dry nuts.  I saved the coating and will try to dip the almonds in some honey and shake them in the sugar coating and return them to the oven for a little bit to see if that will help.  The sugar mixture is good, so I hope that will work.
