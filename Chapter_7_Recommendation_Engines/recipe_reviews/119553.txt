Impressive. Very easy, and fast to make, everyone loved it. You could add some tortilla chips if you wanted, my son topped his with spicy ranch, and couldn't get enough of it. Will definately make again

Pretty basic spanish-rice-kind-of-casserole, but still, it's super-easy and we all really liked it. Definitely a crowd pleaser. I admit that I did stovetop instead of microwave cooking...something about cooking meat in the microwave just seems too fast food to me. Call me crazy. We kicked it up a notch, too, by topping it with our fav taco ingredients like shredded cheese and lettuce, fresh onions and tomatoes, black olives, and sour cream. Yum!

Ok, here's the thing, I don't really think this is a "dinner" item. We started to eat it as is, but my husband grabbed a bag of tortilla chips and went at it as a dip.....much better fit. And the spicy ranch that hockeymom089's son liked....perfection! While it was an overall tasty dish (as a dip & w/spicy ranch), We decided that it wasn't worth making again. Worth a try though.

Delicious! I made essentially exactly as written. I used Uncle Ben's Ready Rice (brown rice) instead of the instant. If you do this, eliminate the 1/4 cup of water, as this rice will not absorb as much as instant. Delicious recipe, and made the house smell wonderful! Thanks for sharing, Dianne!

Very good, fast meal; I completely disagree with Firefly9 about it not being a dinner item.  It's certainly not gourmet, but it's healthy, fast and filling.  I've made it several times and added various things at different times like chopped zucchini, mild rotel tomatoes or salsa (adjusted the water accordingly), subbed cooked brown rice for instant - it's very forgiving. Basically, you could try whatever you have on hand that your family likes.

I made this for a church potluck.  It was all gone!  Everyone liked it.  I will make it again, but will probably add more spices.

Very good for something so simply made.  I'd call it a quick microwave chili recipe.  Everyone really enjoyed it and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again.

Since I'm not a student, I have access to more than a microwave and preferred not to use it for this recipe. I prepared it in a skillet on the stove adding ingredients as directed. I left out the water as I used Uncle Ben's Long Grain White Boil-in-Bag Rice and prepared it before adding to skillet mix.I also added garlic powder. Once  everything wa mxmixed in the skillet and simmered for a few minutes, i poured It into the casserole dish. All ingredients were then toppped with double the amount of shredded cheese.  Casserole was baked in oven at 350 until cheese completely melted.  Turned out excellent. Served with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, onions and guacamole. Husband commented on flavor and went back for more. 6 yr. Old granddaughter went for thirds exclaiming, "I don't like it, I LOVE it!"

Pretty tasty with a little bit of heat.  Very easy to assemble and nutritious.  Didn't use the microwave, opted for stovetop and oven instead and it turned out great.  Would make this again
