Cute and creative - plus you look like a genious in front of little kids! For some reason anything with whipped cream and sprinkles just sceams of something a little extra special! And I must admit this is a great way to liven up instant cocoa which tends to be a little boring. Overall, great recipe for kids of all ages....

When I first saw this recipe, like everyone I thought is this really a recipe. However, my neice and nephew always stay with me and ask for hot chocolate. Although, I like it from scratch, they are more than happy with the packets. I add whipped cream, to make it special sometimes, but they also ask me for chocolate or caramel drizzled on top and that gets very messy! I always have leftover sprinkles from the holidays, anyhow. It makes it more special, and they love it! It also works for other holidays to with different colors. Thank you

As a new couponer, I have several boxes of cocoa that I got for free that I needed to use up. This is great for that.....and the kids are super happy. Really, all it takes is a little whipped cream and sprinkles to make a child's morning. My kids are thrilled with me right now. I get to be Super Mom with little effort. I dig that.

Yeah, so it may not be much of what most consider a 'recipe', but it's a cute idea for dressing up hot cocoa for the kids (and adults for that matter, lol), and my son absolutely LOVED it (he kept calling it santa cocoa), so that's good enough for me! Thanks for sharing. :)

I would agree..not really a recipe...but my kids didn't care.  They cared that they were drinking hot cocoa with sprinkles and a cherry on top.  Of course, the cherry kept rolling off the top of the whipped cream and sinking in the hot cocoa, so they all got a few cherries before we got it right, lol.

I remember this recipe.  It's from one of my favorite tv shows from  Disney back in the day... "So Weird". Season 2 Episode 13: Fountain.  The Christmas episode.  I can't believe someone actually posted it in here. Lol

Cute. My whipped cream melted so fast that my cocoa rose and spilled over the rim of the mug!  Reminder to under-fill a quite a bit; I usually don't add whipped cream to cocoa-to save calories, but it's a fun, festive drink at the holidays.  Skipped the cherry since we don't eat maraschino cherries in our house.  I'm giving this 3 stars because it's dressed up packet cocoa, but I like the idea.
