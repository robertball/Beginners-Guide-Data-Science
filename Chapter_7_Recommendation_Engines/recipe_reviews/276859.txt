I liked it a lot.  The liquid smoke is a nice touch.  I had all the ingredients ( a rarity) and the flavors were a great balance.  My wife is gluten-free, so I paired it with Jovial Egg Tagliatelle GF Pasta and it paired so well I doubt most would know it was not real wheat pasta.  She suggested a a little heat, so I think I will try a few red pepper flakes the next time around.  Good recipe!

The only change I made was to use ground venison as I have  plenty in my freezer. Excellent cold weather dish!

Would be my last choice in a beef stroganoff recipe...  If you make it as per the recipe, it tastes like beef stroganoff without garlic and an over abundance of salt and worcestershire sauce.  I had to eat it, since I went to the trouble of making it, but I never would again.  There are lots of GOOD stroganoff recipes out there.  There is no reason to use this one.

Wow, super comfort food quality!  I would like to say that I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have any liquid smoke so I had to leave that out.  It was very thick so I added a teaspoon of Better than Bouillon beef concentrate with a cup of water and this was made it the perfect consistency to spoon over the egg noodles.

Very easy and delicious recipe. The sauce is very thick. If you like a thinner stroganoff I think this would be good by including a little beef broth when adding the ingredients at the end.
