I was looking for a potato cheese soup recipe that I could use here where I live-- in Germany-- because cheddar cheese is almost nonexistant here.  I live in middle Bavaria and none of the shops around here have it, not even the cheese shops.

I LOVE this recipe!  I find that it tastes better with only two tablespoons of fat free mayo and broccoli added.  Everytime I've made it this way people have raved!  Thanks for this GREAT treat!

I havent tried this recipe yet but to reply to the reviewer from middle bavaria, I also live in middle bavaria (regensburg) and I was about to make the same comment about callling a recipe german that calls for swiss cheese, but you beat me to it. However the point of my comment is this, if you are looking for cheddar go to the closest kaufland and head for the cheese counter- it does exist here, it just takes going to a giant discount supermarket to find it (I've never found it in netto but ours is small, and a bigger aldi might have it too).

This had great flavor and everything cooked evenly.  Didn't need the potato flakes for thickening, the cheese did that on it's own.  This is not a 5 star for a couple of reasons.  First off b/c of all the cheese, chicken broth (low sodium at that), and mayonnaise, this was nearly too salty.  Second, for our tastes it was way too rich.  I think next time I will half the Velveeta and add low fat milk instead.  Also, we topped it off with about a T of bacon, did not use any of the grease.  It was very pretty with the carrots and red bell peppers and the celery was a nice touch.  All in all a great winter time, stick to your bones soup recipe.

There is nothing German about this soup except that maybe it was made by someone that is of german descendant.  If you must, call it American/European Cheezy Potato Soup

The taste of this soup is very good with the vegetable combination. I like the idea of thickening the soup with instant potato flakes. But cheddar is not an ideal melting cheese in soup, it clumps making the soup unappealing..and the greasy yellow layer on the surface of the soup. I will make this again but use only the loaf cheese, cube up a 2lb box. Leave out the swiss and cheddar.

We got snowed in today and this made a HUGE pot of soup that we were able to share with our neighbors.  I replaced the celery (because I am not a fan) with broccoli and the swiss cheese with shredded asiago.  I added about 12 oz of velveeta cheese, because I felt it needed to be a little thicker and I definitely needed to add salt.  I also added some turkey bacon for a little flair.  Dee-lish!!

Loved this soup! I cut my veggies up the night before so I wouldn't have to do much prep work the next day. After reading other reviews I decided to use 1/2 the mayo and It turned out wonderful! 5 Stars from the family :)

A harty and good meal but the mayonnaise overwhelms the flavor.  I added bacon to it which I think was a good addition.  The next time I make this I will not use the mayo.  I think you can go without it.

This soup was very good, we enjoyed it a lot! Some people said they had problems with the cheddar cheese melting, but I think that if you just melt it on low it shouldn't clump or leave a greasy layer, none of those problems for us anyway. Loved that the soup had tons of veggies in it, and the mayo gave it a nice little kick. We will be making this again definitely! If you're looking for a slightly different soup that feeds a crowd, this one is it.

Very, very good and rich.  I'm not real big on peppers and carrots, so I plan to leave them out next time and I think it will still be just as good and flavorful.

Loved this, made as directed except instead of the 4tbsp chicken soup base and 4 cups water, I used all chicken broth and total of 6 cups.  I did add some cayenne and garlic as well.

This soup is very rich, very good.  I used it in addition to a main course but next time it will BE the main course.  I followed the recipe to a tee, and it was terrific. I would not change a thing.

Awesome recipe.  The mayo added a little zing to the soup.  I would recommend a little hot sauce so spice it up a little further.  Try popped popcorn on top instead of crackers!

I made this with broth from a ham bone (instead of the chicken broth) left over from Christmas! It was a hit with my picky husband however I did not have potato flakes to thicken the soup so I blended ( a lil to much) the cooked potatoes. If you opt to do this only blend 1/3 of the potatoes. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes to spice it up. Yum Yum...enjoy!

Yummy. I followed the recipe but replaced the red pepper and cut up carrots with a 1# bag of cole slaw mix, it is delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is absolutely delicious! I was out of red peppers, which I didn't realize until I had the soup started, so had to leave those out. I also didn't have the potato flakes so I whisked a little cornstarch in with a little extra mayo & whisked into the soup at the end. Perfection! LOVE the richness that the mayo adds & the combo of cheeses. Great with  diced ham or bacon added in also. YUM!

I found the original recipe to produce a satisfying, but somewhat crude, overly thick result - and I actually left out the velveeta and flakes. I find you can produce a much more impressive and complex soup by easing back to a thinner consistency sans flakes and ditching the velveeta for asiago. Between cheese and mayo you will get all the thickness a soup really needs. I tried adding some rosemary and bay leaves to the broth , which adds a very earthy and vivid ambiance to the odor. It is necessary to remove the bay leaves at the end of the boil though, or all the cheese will congeal on them when you add it in to melt. Dijon mustard also made a nice addition to thicken and flavor.

Made this for a potluck at church and it was the first dish gone! Everyone was asking "who made the soup?" Even my pastor said "this is Soup Plantation Good!" I cooked it in the crockpot all day and added the cheeses when I got home. I omitted the bell pepper only put in a third of the mayo and added broccoli and bacon bits. It was very smooth, rich and delicious. It's a keeper!

FANTASTIC!!  made a few modifications to suit my fridge contents, omitted velveeta, swiss cheese and potato flakes; and added in chopped zucchini and portabello mushroom, 2tbsp of white pasta sauce and a little Mrs.Dash.  Soup ended up amazing.  If left on a very low heat, it thickened up perfectly fine for thickness.  Husband who typically prefers heavily spiced foods found this to be delicious and worthy of rave reviews!

I could really taste the mayonnaise in this, so much so I thought it took away from the other flavors (and I doubled the velveeta cheese).  I think you could get away with 1/2 the mayonnaise, or maybe even leaving it out.  Thanks for the recipe, William.

This is one the best recipes I have ever come across. I made it for a November tailgate party and served it in bread bowls, therefore, needed to thicken it with corn starch. What a hit

This soup is very yummy. I substitute veggie broth for the chicken broth it calls for, and it came out great.

I fried some bratwurst, sauteed the vegetables in that grease then added it to the soup. It was very good before, but I think the brats made a huge difference.

Absolutely delicious. I made it as the recipe says minus the celery, it reminds me of  a pimento cheese flavored soup. I have made if several times and is on list of favs.

I have made this recipe a number of times and it is delicious every time! It is very rich but I also try to use low/non fat where I can. It is so rich that these substitutions do not make any difference. I also try to add extra celery and carrots (to make myself feel better).

This soup is AWESOME!  I scaled it to feed 40 people for a family reunion and i should have scaled it to 100....it was THAT good.  I will definitely do it again.

I didn't have chicken base, so I subsituted mushroom base.  Lots of veggie prep, but well worth the time.  Soup is very thick and creamy, taste is incredibly good!  I did add some crumbled cooked bacon just before serving as my husband is a meat lover.
