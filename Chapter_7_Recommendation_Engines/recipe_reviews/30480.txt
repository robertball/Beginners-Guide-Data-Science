This is by far the best hamburger I have ever tasted. I chose to eliminate the cajun and add a lot of fresh garlic. The brown sugar really shows off the spices while maintaining a sweet taste.

Pretty "Good Burger"!  I only used 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar which seemed to balance the heat of the cajun seasoning and used bit of minced garlic vs. garlic powder.

These were great!!!  The only thing I changed was I did not use steak sauce.  Instead I used the same amount of Worcestershire sauce.  These received a lot of comments and I have given the recipe to several people since I served them.

This a very tasty burger. One of the best I have tasted in a while. I didn't use the onion due to the fact I am not an onion fan. Over all though it had a very good taste and it will be made again.

This recipe is a good place to start, but I wasn't thrilled with it as written.  I like sweet foods, but my burger was so sweet I couldn't even finish the whole thing.  Also, they didn't hold together very well while cooking, but that might have been because I pureed the yellow onion.  It might also have been because our burgers ended up HUGE -- we used extra lean ground beef, which basically means we had enough mixture for six patties instead of four.  They also turned out very sticky and gooey, which was pretty unappealing while they were being put together.  The best thing about this meal was the chipotle pepper flavored corn chips I found at our Asian market to serve with them!  Reduce the sugar by maybe half, make the burgers pretty small, and add cheese, chips, and anything else that will tone down the sweetness & stickiness, and they just might work.

My husband and I were surprised with how good these burgers are.  They are sweet and yet spicy.  This is by far the best burger recipe we've ever had!

Unachica, you're absolutely right, these are not your every day burger, but that IS the beauty of it = a great change from the every day version.  If you read the description of the burger, it states that they are not exact measurements, so I really didn't have a problem in that area (my tastes), I did use a little less sugar, but everything else was as written.  Oh, I also mixed it into a pattie and put it in the fridge so that the flavors could "marry".  It was a good burger, not an everyday burger, but a really good once in a while burger (sweet tooth burger).  Next time I will try it topped with mango salsa, thanks Unachica!

We liked the kick of the spices (just right for me) but WAY too much brown sugar for our tastes.  Instead of 6 Tbs, I would try 2-3 TBS.  We wanted it to be flavor enhanced, not sweet like a dessert.  Otherwise, tasty :)

This is a sweet burger, but I thought it was good.  I made it at a BBQ and all but 1 person liked it, he thought it was too sweet.  It's terrific for a change from the regular burger though.  I will definitely make it again.

I was looking for a change from the same old burgers and saw this recipe. At first, after reading the other reviews, I was wary of the brown sugar but it turned out great! This has become a new family favorite for every cookout we have! Thanks!

I needed to do something new to buffalo burger, and this hit the spot.  I didn't have Cajun seasoning, so I threw in a couple dashes of hot sauce.  Next time, I'll cut back a bit on the brown sugar.  A sweet burger was a bit of shock to the system.  However, the burger was still delicious!

Did not care for this recipe at all. The burger consistency was more like meatloaf than a burger. Wont be making again.

Pretty good, but a little too sweet for our taste.  I'll make them again using less brown sugar next time.  With that change, I think they will be perfect!

Loved it! Easy and quick.  I used a little less brown sugar and a little more spice.  I even was telling the people at my work about it.

Oh my, this was really good indeed!  I admit, however, to toying with the recipe as follows:  First, I carmelized a couple of large sweet onions in olive oil and then set aside.  I omitted the raw onion from the recipe and reduced the brown sugar to 2 TBL.  I made pretty large burgers, more than 1/3 pound each, and pressed them to about a 4" burger.  I fried them in a fry pan on the stove using just a little butter in the pan.  After the burgers were cooked, I topped each burger with a dollop of the carmelized onions and then a slice of provolone cheese (melted over the onions).  WOW!!!  Now that was really delicious.  I even over-cooked them to well-done (by accident), and they were still incredibly moist and juicy.  Don't put ketchup or anything on these until you taste.  They were so flavorful, we ate them "bare!"

I wasn't sure that adding brown sugar to a hamburger would be very good but these burgers are actually deserving of the name "Good Burger".  My husband and I both thought they were delicious and we will make them again.

these were soooo good. i am currently teaching my older brother to cook and these were easy to teach on and so delicious. however, they came out very sticky, something i was not expecting. also, my brother is not a fan of onions and didn't really appreciate the amount of onions in them. no big though. overall they are possibly the best burgers we have ever had and we will make them again.

We love this burger.  I didn't have cajun so I used cayenne it was delish!! I'm lazy so I just used 1/4 cup of dried onion.  We like to make them into bacon cheeseburgers with no other condiments, so as not to cover up any of the taste!  Ty so much for this recipe!

It was a great hit with my Hubby! I loved it the sweetness and the cajun it was perfect! The only thing I changed was onion power for the real onion. I hate real onion but I love the flavor it gives food. Totally going to have it again!

DEEE_EEELICIOUS!!  I used half a red onion and replaced the cajun seasoning with steak sauce (feeding small children who don't do spicy).  Also used minced garlic instead of powdered.  So so so good!

Amazing. Have been making this for 2 years now.  A favorite at tailgates. I put Pepperjack cheese on it to offset some sweet. Other than leaving out the onion, I leave everything else the same and LOVE them.

Hmmmm...This was a bit too sweet, nice flavor, very juicy, just a little different but not too odd. I liked this but I can't say for sure I would make it again. I know my husband would not have liked this since it was sweet. Thanks, I enjoyed my lunch.

These were good!  I cut the brown sugar in half and they were still a little too sweet.  I might use even less next time.  I, like another reviewed, subbed in worcestershire sauce for steak sauce, and I didn't really have any cajun seasoning on hand.  But all in all, these were great.  My husband loved them.  An awesome alternative to traditional burgers!

Too sweet (my 10-year-old son would not eat them), and though I chopped up the onion very fine, the patties still fell apart and crumbled all over the place.  If I ever make it again, I'll leave out the brown sugar, and add an egg to keep them from falling apart.

My kids gave these 5 stars.  They are sweet.  The brown sugar comes out and makes a sort of sweet glaze on the burger.  Something different.

I've made these several times now and they have always turned out amazing. My girlfriend won't even let me make "regular burgers" anymore... I also cut back on brown sugar a little.

I thought this was a very tasty burger. Based upon others suggestions I cut the brown sugar down and used only 2 tablespoons. It was perfect with just a  hint of the sweetness. Only note I made for my own purposes was to cut the grilling time compared to that of a normal burger. It seemed like the bread crumbs soaked up some of the juices of the burger.

I used 1/2 the sugar and more cajun seasoning and the burgers were still way too sweet, I couldn't finish the hamburger either, but I can tell you my 4 year old LOVED IT, but then again he likes raisins on his hotdogs!

This is the worst burger recipe I have ever tried.  It was way too sweet and I only used half the sugar the recipe called for.  Only use this recipe if you want to waste good hamber meat!!!

These burgers are great. My kids love them. The only challenge I face with these burgers is the meat often falls apart on the grill. Has this happened to anyone else?

Very, very god. Just like many others, I cut the sugar in half and also cut the bread crumbs in half, the burgers were perfect. Next time, I might add a little more spice. But right now, great mix of salty and sweet.

Very good and unique burgers.  After reading some reviews I only used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and it turned out great.  I will make these again.

This guy underestimates the name of his burger. My family is the most picky people you will ever feed, they really don't like change and usually we just add bbq sauce to the burgers after they are cooked. My dad doesnt like a whole lot of spice and my mom doesnt like onion. But i decided to try this out and they both loved it! Nether of them had any complaints about anything in it and now when we make burgers, they actually request that i make this recipe. When i make it just for myself, i add more cajun and sometimes a little hot sauce but other than that, I keep it the same. 

My only suggestion when making this recipe is that you may need to add more bread crumbs depending on what meat you buy. I had to add more because the patties weren't stable enough and we used extra lean ground beef. So just add more breadcrumbs if you feel you need to

Good...odd, but actually good. However, I used 3 lbs of chuck and I only used about 3 tbls of sugar...I couldn't imagine, 1 lb with 6 tbls....I also used red pepper flakes instead of seasoning....moist. Good. Odd...does that make sense?

Excellent! Instead of Cajun seasoning, I used paprika, chili powder and garlic pepper. I also added a bit of Liquid Smoke. The burgers were delicious! So glad that I made extra patties, we're having them again tonight! :)

Great recipe!

I just reduced the amount of brown sugar. 2Tbsp per lb is great.

2lbs made about 5 patties for me.

I will not be making burgers any other way now. I was lazy and didn't feel like chopping an onion and I never have bread crumbs so I eliminated those two ingredients. I also just guesstimated on the rest -- "season to taste". Turned out fabulous. I threw two patties on my George Foreman for Hubby and me, and it was awesome. Will make again and again and again...

Excellent!  I tweaked a bit based on what I had in the house and our preferences. I added brown sugar, steak sauce, Garlic powder, a little ground mustard. Left out onion and cajun season because of taste choices and bread crumbs because we didn't have any. EXCELLENT burger. We added white american cheese and it was perfect.

I didn't have thawed hamburger so I thawed meat in microwave and made loose meat sandwiches.  Since so many said it was too sweet, I only used half of brown sugar but next time I will use a little more.  I didn't have cajun,seasoning so I found a recipe and made my own.  My husband love this so I will make this again.

Best burger recipe ever! I have always prided myself on making great burgers on the grill, but this recipe blows away anything I've ever made!  The brown sugar gives a sweet taste to the burger, if you can live with that.  I will always use this recipe everytime I make burgers.

These are the best burgers ever! I love how the brown sugar makes it taste. I like spicy so I add more cajun seasoning but otherwise don't change a thing!

I didn't like it and my husband thought the burger was "Okay".  WAY TOO SWEET.  I even cut the sugar in half but it was still too sweet.

This has been called "the best burger ever" by my fiance and several of his friends after tailgating. Don't skimp on the seasonings, and add some more if you would like! I always start with sazon, a puerto rican garlic-based seasoning.

My 17 yr old son has now taken to these as his favorite burgers.  I find you have to cut the onions very fine or they will tend to cause the patties to fall apart.  I should probably try it with a burger press, but don't have one yet.

Amazing! -Great taste. Sweet AND Spicy, what else could be better.  A bit more garlic & slightly less sugar for us, but ...Wow.  My family just loves these burgers. I WILL be making these again!

Read this recipe, thought it sounded interesting with the whole brown sugar thing.  Tried it and it definately was different.  It was ok. My husband liked it and said that we should make them like this again.  I think if I do make them again, I'll cut the brown sugar in 1/2.  Maybe then they won't be SO sweet.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

Great flavorful burger that will put the national chains to shame.  We used turkey instead of beef.

I really liked these burgers. Reduced the sugar to only 3 tablespoons as anymore would have made them way too sweet.

I wasn't impressed with this one - it was much too sweet for me! My husband thought it tasted "fine" though.

If I try this again (big if), I'll use much less sugar.

This just didn't set well with our tastes. I reduced the brown sugar to half of what the recipe called for and we still thought it was too sweet.  But then our preferences tend toward the spicey.  I'm sure it would be great for anybody with a sweet tooth.
