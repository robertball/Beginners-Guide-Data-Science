1.30.18  This recipe is almost identical to a Calico Beans recipe that I’ve made for years, except some of the ingredient amounts are different, and my old recipe calls for garlic salt and baking in the oven.  I followed the directions up to the point that it was supposed to go into a slow cooker for an hour (another dirty pot) which simply didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me.  I ended up cooking this stove top for about 20 minutes, and it turned out well.  For us, it was a bit sweet (personal taste preference) but still tasted very good.  Thanks for sharing your dear friend’s recipe.

I've been making this forever, always popular. You can change the beans, this time added some black beans, my hubby likes garbanzos. Water chestnuts add a nice crunch. I like extra bacon. Had to look this up because my recipe did not say how many servings it made so needed a comparison. Over the years I've made double for pot lucks, but did not want a lot left over, this makes for eight and that's correct.

Betty, you old Devil!  Heck of a recipe. The whole family loved it. The only thing I could not find was butter beans. I only went to one market, and I am sure had I cared more I'd have found some. That said, I used Great Northern beans instead.

Okay, no bacon, onion, butter beans or brown sugar. It was still awesome enough that there was almost nothing left. Everyone had seconds! Definitely a keeper!

My new "go to" bean recipe. It has more of a BBQ flavor then the traditional sweet recipes.   My husband often request it for dinner as it makes a great meal all by itself (like chili) .  I love it for pot lucks and sometimes add an extra can or two of beans to make it go further.
