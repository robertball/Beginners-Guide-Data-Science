These grilled game hens were a wonderful diversion from our usual, more mundane (i.e. chicken) menu.  I confess that I only had two hens for the 4 servings I was hoping for.  Prior to marinading, I cut each of them in half lengthwise, so that each half had a wing and a drumstick.  I placed the four halves in a glass baking dish and poured on the marinade. (I made 1/2 the marinade, since I had half the game hens!).  My husband, who is the Grill Master, popped them on the grill and cooked them slowly as he would a large, bone-in chicken breast.  It didn't take anywhere near the 1 hour called for in the recipe (probably cutting them in half cut down on the grill time.) These were delicious, juicy, and visually appealing.  My whole family was impressed.  Served with long grain rice and stir-fried    snap peas. The 1/2 hen was just the right amount for each serving - no one was still hungry, but alas, there were no leftovers!  I will most definitely be making this again when we are in the mood for "something out of the ordinary".

I've made these 3 or 4 times now, and they are always great. The marinade has a great flavor. I'll make these at least twice a year now.

OMG!  The flavor was to die for!  I marinaded for about 6 hours and then put them on the grill for about 70 minutes.  The flavor was excellent and so very tender.  Everyone raved about them.

Followed the recipe and found that even after marinating overnight, the flavor was very mild. It was still good though. I cut 2 small hens in half lengthwise and its a perfect serving for 4 people.

I liked this recipe.  Hubby thought it was too lemon-y so I might cut down on the amount of lemon juice next time or use a better quality olive oil than I used this time around.

Fixed this yesterday using whole hens and, I must say, the sauce makes this dish. The flavor was wonderful and not overpowering. The skin was nice and crisp and had great flavor and the meat was mouth watering. Only change I made was eliminating the white wine simply because we don't drink and I didn't feel like going to the store for some. I don't think it would have made any difference though. I suspect this marinade would be good on almost any meat. I must confess, though, this was an experimental recipe for me since I was using my rotisserie for the first time and wanted something fairly simple. I do plan to use it again and I will let you know how it is with other meats. Again, great recipe. Thanks

This recipe replaced one that we've been using for over 15 years.  The flavors are absolutely incredible.  It's best on the BBQ, but if weather turns bad (we can get early-evening monsoons) it can be baked in the oven.  Heaven!

excellent, but double the marinade, and save 1/4 of it for basting. Made for Thanksgiving dinner.....all I can say is WOW.....so very good....don't skimp on the lemon.....I used even the pulp, and with rosemary sprigs, garlic and onion.....pulverized it all in my Vitamix and let sit overnight before applying to bird....wow....lets just say they ate it all....and loved it....requests are already in for Christmas dinner. mmmmmm

This recipe was AWESOME! I only had 2 hours to marinate the hens but they still turned out great...I can't imagine how good they would taste after being marinated for 4 hours. The only change that I made was I did 2 tbsps of Worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp of Hot Pepper sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. I will probably never bake a Cornish Hen again after using this recipe...family favorite.

I cut the recipe in half as I had 4 split hens. The weather also did not co-operate, so I cooked them in the oven, basting them a couple of times. The flavor was outstanding and the meat very moist and tender. I will definately keep this recipe and try it on chicken pieces or split fryers.

These birds turned out really well. I was sure the lemon juice would overpower everything but I was wrong. The flavor sublime. I followed another poster's suggestion and pureed the onion, garlic and lemon juice in the Vitamix. Then added the rest of ingredients. Marinated butterflied birds for 5 hours and they cooked in about 35 minutes. Served them up with the Mushroom Rice recipe from this site and steamed broccoli. A winner!

This was a really good, simple marinade that doesn't overpower the delicate flavor of the game hens. The only things I did differently was that instead of plain black pepper added garlic pepper; and a teaspoon of fresh rosemary because I had some on hand.

Turned out ok.  The flavor almost overpowerd the meat.  I would cut back on the time is marinates next time.

Very nice. I let the hens marinate overnight, saved the marinate, reduced it, added some hot pepper jelly and used it as a glaze during grilling. Quick, good and easy to fix.

This was tasty. I made this for company. They enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. (That always gives me a tickle in my stomach) I only gave it 4 stars because even though I thought it was good, I think it has too much salt. I have been trying to cut back abit on the families salt and sugar intake. I'll make it again for company.

My family likes very seasoned food, the stronger the better. This does not mean salty, just lots of herbs.  I marinated the hens for about 20 hours, and they did come out flavorful, but not as strong as we would have liked for as long as it marinated.    I will make this again, but I will increase the Worchestershire sauce next time because it is a strong flavor.

All we could say is WOW! These are amazing! We marinated them overnight (approx 24 hrs) and then grilled them on charcoal with mesquite wood chips. It was wonderful and SO easy!

Very good dish, not much to complain about. On my side, I had to buy a bigger grill to accommodate for the free-loaders always looking for a free meal. Great recipe.

VERY GOOD and as an added bonus its so simple! My daughter who is 17 months doesn't really like meat but she loved this. When I first read the ingredients I was a little worried of it being too lemony but the flavor is great and the meat is juicy. I cant wait to make it again.

I'll start by saying I had to bake my birds, due to rain.  I split them up the breast before putting them in the marinade, letting them sit overnight, and turning in the morning.  They turned out fantastically.  I cooked at 375, and basted at 15 min. intervals until done, about 1.5 hours.  The birds had a great citrusy flavor all the way through without taking away from the flavor of the meat.

This recipe was very delicious.  It was a great idea to keep the hens moist while grilling.  Perfectly delicious!   My one comment would be to tweak the ingredients according to your family's taste, which any cook would know to do.  In my case, I used the juice of two lemons and was less than the cup but enough for me.  Had it been more it would have turned more into the deli lemon pepper chicken sold at Walmart (not my intention).  Next time I will use more of some of the ingredients like tabasco and worcester as I personally felt the taste needed more of a kick.  Delicious and a keeper!

GREAT recipe! I love grilling and I love Cornish hens so I made it for Thanksgiving and I was so happy with the way they tasted. My husband loved it as well.

Great recipe! I added a few herbs to our personal tastes, used white vermouth and increased it to 1/4 cup, and added a 1TB of honey because I was concerned about the tartness of that much lemon juice.  Like another reviewer, I blended the marinade. Also, I sliced the onions instead of chopping so I could top the hen halves on the grill

Delicious!!!!  I only had a 1/2 C of lemon juice and these were so good.  I didn't really taste any "distinctive" taste from the marinade, just great.

We loved this recipe.  I didn't think they would take as long to cook but they really do.  Really easy to prepare and serve.  Easy on the lemon juice if you aren't fond of it as it does come through in the end.  If you are worried about spice, the hot pepper sauce and pepper it's very mild.

I just used olive oil, garlic salt, pepper, rosemary sprigs and garlic cloves. Turned out suprisingly good. To me the other ingredients weren't necessary. They weren't missed.

Delicious. Husband immediacy said a keeper. Better than hens I’ve cooked in oven. Made full marinade recipe (even though only did 2 hens) so had more than enough for basting. Cooked on low med heat for an hour and basted about 5 times.

Marinated per instructions. Removed backbone from hens before marinating. Grilled flat on grate. Grilled 45 mins. Probably 35-40 would have been juicier. Very yummy & eye appealing. Definitely would make for guests. Will make again & again.

I marinated together 2 whole Cornish game hens with this recipe using all the listed ingredients.  My husband grilled them on the grill.  They turned out pleasantly spicy and savory.  They were just the right tenderness and the skin was pleasantly crispy.  We both ate all.  The only things left were the wish bones and they soon were broken in half to make wishes.

My wife loves lemon and this recipe put her in heaven.  Followed the recipe except I cut the hens in half. Grilled skin side up indirect heat for 25 minutes and then turned them for the last 5 minutes over the flame to turn the skin crispy. Finger lickin' good. Juicy, tender, tasty and just as good the next day!

Recipe a keeper! My hubby and I loved the taste. I made extra marinade to use for basting-I did not think it healthy to use the marinade raw poultry was in.
Plan to make for extended family of 17. I'll have to order 9 cornish hens from grocer and figure out space to cook them all-maybe use my oven.

Outstanding!  I used red onions, and let the hens marinate overnight in the refrigerator.  Then I cooked it on the rotisserie on my gas grill and the skin was perfectly crisp, and the bird delicious!

I'd make again.  Skipped the Worcestershire and hot sauce and only had one lemon, but I only made 2 birds so it worked out fine.  The main points I took from the recipe were to marinade it for a few hours and using fresh onion and garlic in the marinade, hadn't tried that before but I'm glad I did.  I split them down the breast had had them pretty much "splayed" on the gill, breast down first with some leftover marinade poured int he cavities.  Worked out well on a charcoal grill using indirect heat.

This is a great recipe !! I added some tandoori spices, and used yogurt (about 1 tablespoon) for the marinade !! To really get the tandoori spice in I did the following marinade: into a bowl add hen, add olive oil, cumin seeds, puréed garlic & ginger (go extra on ginger), add cayenne pepper, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt, tandoori spices, and yogurt. Marinade for few hours to 2-3 days. When you grill the hen, you'll notice how tender and flavorful it will turn out !! Garnish with coriander and yogurt raita.

This is a super receipt. I added some red pepper to spice it up. Followed the time cooking and it was cooked just right.
