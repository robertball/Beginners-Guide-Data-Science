This was delicious! I am really surprised that more people did not use the beans, they were great! I love potatoes but I did not miss them! I dusted my stew meat in 1/4 cup of seasoned flour and browned it in olive oil first. I added some things-chopped onion, celery, sliced fresh mushrooms, 6 minced garlic cloves, instead of the powder, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, seasoned salt, Emeril's Essence, and a bay leaf. I used beef consomme instead of the broth, and Great Northern beans. I added in some fresh minced parsley when I added the beans. If you think the stew is too soupy, the flouring/browning the meat will help thicken it and also when adding the beans, take out a quarter of them and mash them before adding to the crock pot and it will thicken it nicely. I served this with crusty sourdough rolls. I will love to make this again! The broth/gravy is wonderful!

This was great!  I substituted Campbell's condensed onion soup for the beef broth to add more flavor.  I also omitted the cannelini beans this time, as I served over noodles.  The beans will be great, however, especially for a hearty stew on a cold, winter day!  Try this recipe--you won't be disappointed.

This was delicious! Perfect for a cold night in. I couldn't find canneloni, and so I used Great Northern Beans, and I also added water where it called for wine (my husband doesn't like the taste of wine in food), but it was wonderful!

I *loved* this stew. I made a few changes that were suggested by other people and a couple of my own... About an hour before it was finished, I checked on it and the broth seemed a little too thin for me, so I mashed about half of one of the cans of beans and added them to the stew. This helped a lot. I also browned the meat with flour a little as suggested before adding it to the slow cooker, which also helped... In addition, I added about 4-5 medium sized potatoes to it. The mix of beans and potatoes was perfect... I also used fresh garlic as opposed to the powder and threw in some other seasonings that I tend to like in things like this. I added celery, carrots and onions as well. I used a little water instead of the wine... And instead of cut stew meat, I instead got a whole beef roast and put it in... When it was done, I used a fork to pull it apart. I preferred it over meat chunks usually used in stews; The juices from the roast gave the broth a better taste and the meat itself was delicious in the stew. It was delicious served over buttered biscuits.. Since this was made for a family of two, I had a ton leftover. I put it in containers and froze it for later. This recipe is definitely saved for later.

Very Good! The only thing I might do different next time is use only 1 can beans and throw in some potatoes. I really missed potatoes in my beef stew. But this was fabulous even when going by the recipe.

Great recipe!! I used chicken stock instead of beef because it is msg-free and I substituted a few potatoes for a can of beans. My family loved it, even my toddler and preschooler at it all!!!

Great recipe - The first time I followed the directionseryone enjoyed but felt somehing was missing. Since then I've made this several times and have modified to add potatoes and celery, increased the dried italian seasoning to 1 tblsp, 1/2 tblspn of onion powder and pepper -   Highly recommneded ! - with the additions above I would rate 5 stars ! !

This was a huge hit at my hunting camp this past fall.  Its hard not to make a meal that the guys won't enjoy but they all requested that I make this again next season!!  Great recipe and great taste.

Very easy and surprisingly good.  I followed the directions closely (I always do the first time).  I may add onions next time.  While I loved the beans I liked the idea of using one can beans and a few potatoes.  Definitely a keeper.

I went with other reviewers and added potatoes and left out one can of beans.  Just a personal preference of liking potatoes with beef stew.  I also added a little celery.  The flavor was very good and I will make again.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I have to admit - I used it as a guide only - because my pantry was lacking this week - need to do some shopping!  Still - it turned out great - and can't wait to make it again using your ingredients!!!  Thanks!!!!

Easy to make, I added some extra spices to make it more flavorful.  I also put in a large pot roast piece of beef since I don't like the cubes (they dry out too easy).  Added a potato and 1 can of beans instead of 2.

Bland & Boring.  Followed the directions to a tee and it wasn't anything special.  Added kosher salt and cayenne pepper to make it edible.  Won't make again.

This was really flavorful. Hubbie can't have salt so I used some low sodium vegetable base mixed with water for the beef broth. I also used low sodium fire roasted diced tomatoes. Not a fan of beans in stew so I left those out. The broth for this is really good.

This one was definitely a keeper.  I cooked it on the stovetop for a couple hours, since I didn't get going early enough to use the crock, but the meat was quite tender.  Next time, I think I'll increase the Italian seasoning and add a bit of crushed red pepper.

We are not huge stew eaters, so I figured this would be a toss up. There was something about it that we didn't care for. For me, I think it was the wine I used because I still felt like I tasted it even after it cooked for 9 hours. My husband thought I used too much of one particular spice, though we weren't sure which one. Good recipe, perhaps....just not for us.

I liked the beans in this dish. (which surprised me)  My beef was quite dry.  Might try again with a different cut of meat.

Excellent flavor in this stew, the only thing I run into is that the carrots don't cook all the way, so I precook them just slightly.

What a delightful change from the heavy gravy from the typical onion soup beef stew. Still very flavorful! I wish I could have used the beans as I love them and it's kind of the point of the Tuscan theme but my husband won't eat them. I used baby red potatoes. I followed the recipe with the exception of fresh garlic, a half quartered onion and extra carrots.

This is very good!  I noticed at the last minute that what I thought was a can of seasoned diced tomatoes was actually seasoned tomato sauce, so I used that. I replaced the beans with frozen peas and added some baby red potatoes.  I did add a few shakes of sea salt (for the potatoes), coarse ground black pepper and 1 tsp. of liquid browning sauce.  DELISH!

I love this recipe as a fall back for guests or a busy night.  It doesn't require much effort and is so versatile.  My family loves this stew.  I've tried red kidney beans, pinto beans, garbanzos and a mixture with the northern beans.  I love using a rich merlot with this as it really helps the flavor. Add a little chili powder to spice it up or some sour cream to cool it down.  PS I always add more wine towards the end of cooking, a little more garlic, plus a bay leaf.

I love this amazing stew!  I brown all the chunks of meat before putting them in the slow cooker, gives another layer of flavor.  I use great northern beans (mainly because at my store the cannelini beans cost 3 times as much)  I also just use 1 can of beans and then add 2 medium red potatoes cubed.  I serve this alongside a homemade loaf of crusty bread.

I found this recipe in my slow cooker cookbook and only chose it because I had a lone can of tomato soup that I refused to eat by itself (yuck!). I swear, I did not expect it to come out so well. It tasted (and smelled!) AMAZING. I will make this over and over and over a million times. By the way, I used water versus the wine and beef bullion cubes.
