This was a yummy recipe!!  Some small changes though, little more than 3/4 molasses, not 1 cup, 1 Tbsp cinnamon (says 1 tsp) and 1 tsp of all spice.  Those spices really kicked up the flavor.  Also make sure to use lots of flour to roll out the dough as it is sticky.

I was apprehensive, with the variety of reviews, but this recipe turned out great.  I've made gingerbread cookies in the past; either the dough was too tough to work with, or they did taste like cardboard after baking (the frosting redeemed them).  I did double the ginger, as suggested.  The dough was soft, easy to work with, and did not get hard and tough as we continued to work with it. The dough we were working with mixed very well with the dough we added from the refrigerator. The cookies were  soft when done baking.  The kids and I both liked the flavor.  I will use this recipe again.

I doubled the cinnamon, left the ginger the same (a whole *tablespoon* is plenty), and cut the molasses to 34 cup.  They came out tasting great :)  I also dumped the cloves because I don't like that flavor.  The dough wasn't the easiest to work with, but I didn't wait the full three hours to roll it out, so I can't complain.  The cookies held their shape in the oven and stayed soft in the middle.  Another minute or two would have added some crispiness, and I'll probably try that next time.  Great cookies, thanks for the recipe :)

Recipe was easy to follow, dough looked great but compared to the genuine swedish recipe this was not good. I can not believe anyone ever got a compliment on these cookies. Usually the dough is great to taste too but this i could not even take a tiny bite. I decided to make them anyway thinking maybe when they are cooked they would taste better. I ended up throwing them all away! Tomorrow I am calling my mother for her recipe!

Excellent soft gingerbread cookies. I have received many compliments!! I must have been using potent powdered ginger: unlike other reviewers, I found my cookies to have a hot ginger taste. As suggested by others, I doubled the cinnamon & added 1/2 tsp allspice. Next time I would leave the cinnamon at 1 tsp, to keep the ginger dominant. I used 1/2 cup shortening (all I had on hand) and 1/2 cup margarine. I did not notice a 'molasses taste'. I recommend rolling the dough out between 2 pieces of plastic wrap, rather than using a floured surface, to reduce the risk of dry cookies. Bake only until the cookies don't look wet. They will be sturdy but still soft when cool.

I hate giving a bad review to a favorite recipe of another, but these tasted awful and I was extremely dissapointed.  The shortening taste is more pronounced than it should be and the taste of molasses and cloves is overwhelming.  For the cost of the spices and the time it takes to work the dough together, this recipe was a huge let down (my son and I had planned on decorating gingerbread men and had all the fixings to do so - we decided to make another dessert after tasting the cookie) I would choose a recipe with a "sweeter" base.  These are spicy, but not in a way that will be pleasing to children and I have to agree with another reviewes when they said these tasted like dog biscuits.  Sorry!!

Delectable.  Use only 3/4 cup molasses, it's enough.  You want these sweet and spicy, not too molasses-rich.

Reading some of the other reviews, I almost decided not to try these.  But I'm sooooo glad that I did.  I didn't change anything and they were great.  I baked them only until they were slightly firm to the touch.  Perfect.  Thanks, Kim.

Fantastic!  My kids as well as the adults in the family loved this cookie.  If they come out too dry, try cooking them for a minute or so less.  The dough was easy to make, at the end it got a little difficult for mixing but once the dry ingredients were all absorbed it was a dream!  Give it a taste test before you divide it up for the fridge.  This was a really nice cookie, I will make it every year!  Thanks Kim!

Though the dough takes a good deal of time and effort to prepare ( it becomes very thick and dificult to mix) this recipe is well worth the effort. I served them at a neighborhood cookie swap and they were the hit of the party! Thanks Kim!

This recipe is excellent, i don't know what the others are talking about. I have three points to make to the people who have been having problems: 1) Chilling the dough is extremely important, you are using melted butter which is essential for the texture, you must 'set' the dough in the fridge and it will be very easy to work. 2) pet peeve: stop complaining about the flavour of recipe's like this. Adjust the spices! amount of spiciness is a personal preference and should not have bearing on the quality of the recipe when baking. 3) Do not overbake, bake until just dry. If the edges start to become brown you have gone too far.  I added a few tablespoons of B&B to mine, baked them in small rounds and dusted them with powdered sugar when they cooled. They were beautiful!

I made few adjustments to the recipe based on previous reviews...used 2 tbsp ginger (I like the heat), 1/2 tsp allspice, 3/4 cup molasses, substituted 1/2 of the shortening with butter, added a half teaspoon of salt and substituted orange juice for the water.  The orange juice *made* these cookies.  I also dredged the cut cookies in a light coating of granulated sugar.  These cookies are soft and lovely.  *Awesome*

after reviewing other similiar recipes, I ended following this one mostly. However, steps differed, I used black strap molasses 3/4 c and added the baking soda to it, letting it sit till frothy and lt brown. In a separate bowl creamed shortening and brn sugar, then added all spices (doubled the ginger and added 1/2 tsp allspice), vanilla, molasses and then water. Tasted and decided to add 1C of reg sugar, 2 more Tbs of vanilla, and one Tsp of Salt. Gradually added the flour until forming a moist yet firm dough. refrigerated as recipe suggests, then removed and let sit at room temperature for 15-20 min. Rolled mine to just under 1/2" and baked at 375 for exactly 10 minutes. These were deliciously moist yet solid, had a great spice to them!! After reading reviews, I speculate others may be using milder forms of molasses. Black strap is very robust and melds with the clove and ginger to awaken your senses. The batter is almost too much...but the taste cooks down a bit to make very palatable yet flavorful.

I've never baked gingerbread cookies before, and aftyer trying this recipe, I'll probably never stray from it! The dough was very easy to make and work with, I don't know what others are complaining about. I was very (very!) generous with the spices. You have to make sure you are using fresh spices or you will get no flavor! I think I may have also added some allspice. I rolled the dough a little thicker than 1/4 in., and didn't bake for long. I ended up with a wonderful, soft cookie that held it's shape well during decorating and transportation. I made a simple powdered sugar glaze and added fresh orange juice and orange zest and some nutmeg to it -- it was the *perfect* accompaniment to the subtley flavored cookies and everyone loved it! Consider this recipe as a basic foundation, and be creative to suit your own tastes.

This recipe was very good.  I did take the advice of a previous review and increase the cinnamon to a tablespoon and add 1 tsp allspice.  Friends have been asking for more!  My husband likes it because the cookies are soft not crunchy.

I made this recipe last night and the first pan was gone before the second came out of the oven! I used real butter. I am not a fan of shortening in cookies. I rolled out the dough on plastic wrap and did not use flour. the dough was easy to work with and nothing seemed dry at all! Thanks Kim!

This is a very mild gingerbread recipe but tastes good. My husband, the expert cookie dough roller in the house, said the dough is more crumbly than the sugar cookie dough he makes and you have to roll this dough out gently, at least until it warms up, but he said it's pretty easy to work with. My middle son wanted gingerbread cookies for his Royal Rangers class Christmas party so my husband looked for and found this recipe to try. We'll likely make these every Christmas now! They're just as fun to make and decorate as the sugar cookies he makes. We're wondering if anyone has ever frozen the dough, though.

I'm pretty sure that anyone who liked these has never had good gingerbread cookies. I have been making them since I was 5 and while studying abroad I decided to make some but didn't have my own recipe with me so I found this one. I went against all its bad reviews and made it anyway and now I regret it so much. I gave it a star because it makes great play-dough since its texture is incredibly soft, but the end result is completely flavorless. Great dog biscuits too.

This recipe turned out pretty awfully.  It was dry and tasteless.  Frosting them made them only slightly better.  We chose this recipe because of its high rating, but were disappointed with the results, to say the least.  You're better off frosting cardboard!

No losing with this one.  Just good ingredients and they turn out perfect.  Anyone have ideas for an interesting frosting other than the plain white icing?  Anyhow, I've made these many many times and they're just plain good.

The first taste impression from these cookies is that of shortening.  The ginger is a distant second.  Rats! Still searching for a good gingerbread recipe.

I read all the bad reviews and regretfully made them anyways...even worse I made 2 batches before tasting the first.  They are not to my liking (both batches) they are dry and tasteless.  They were very difficult to roll also.
I made all the recomended changes but I do not care for the taste.

This was not to my liking.  The proportions liquid per dry ingredients were way off, the cookies weren't spicy, and no matter how thinly I rolled the dough, when cooked, they were still super thick.

I made a batch and they did turn out good but tasted more like pumpkin cookies then gingerbread and my cooking time was 20 min not 10-12 min as it said.

The recipe looked good, but when made the taste was off- the spices need to be adjusted.  There is too much flour in this recipe and will need to be adjusted as well- the dough was so thick that it was virtually impossible to roll out – the dough kept crumbling.

I'm convinced that being part of a good cook is making slight adjustments to a recipe as you go along based on your culinary intuition. It's very possible that a good cook could have made the necessary slight adjustments to this recipe to make it delicious - certainly enough people have given it high marks to suggest this. I've never claimed to be a good cook, but I did follow this recipe to a T, and they came out tasting pretty awful - not nearly sweet enough. They were still fun to make, but even with plenty of icing only two got eaten (by me). Disappointing.

I added more cinnamon and other spices the second time I made it. I thought the dough rolled out GREAT and they were moist (2 things that have been lacking in other gingerbread cookie recipes I've tried) but they needed a pinch more flavor!

When I first took the dough out of the fridge it was dry and stiff. I heated it in the microwave to warm it a little and then it was great. I don't think this dough needs to be refridgerated like the recipe calls for. If the dough seems hard to work with I suggest warming it a little first. The cookies turned out great!

Was very easy and quick to make (for a rolled cookie).  I haven't frosted them 
yet, but I was a bit disappointed in the taste - a bit bland.  I noticed that the 
recipe did not include any salt.  I wonder if this would affect their taste.  I think
also that I would increase the amount of cinnamon.  Overall, though, a very nice
cookie.

If you are looking for a soft gingerbread cookie, after baking,  this is the recipe for you.  Dough cuts and handles nicely, feel the spices should have been more intense.  I will frost these with lemon flavored icing, hope it redeems them!

After reading both pro and con reviews of this recipe, I decided to try it. Unfortunately, I am another of those disappointed in it.    As others have mentioned, the dough is VERY hard to work with.  My hands were cramping up by the time I had worked in the 6+cups of dry ingredients.    As others have also said, the flavor was lacking.  I tasted the dough as I was working the ingredients together, and decided to add some salt.  This helped a little, but probably would have been better to have a whole teaspoon sifted into the flour from the start.    After letting the dough sit, I cut and baked the cookies, all of which bubbled up, leaving my gingerbread men looking like they had boobs, goiters, or aliens about to pop out of their bodies.  Never saw cookies do that before. *L*  Tasting them, however, was the biggest letdown of all.  After all that hard work, they were mediocre at best.  My toddler loved them, of course, but I wanted more flavor from them.  They didn't need more ginger; my husband thinks they needed more sugar, and I think he might be right.  I didn't want to just ice them for the extra sweetness, though, because then you're just eating dead cookies with sugar for flavor.  Next time, I will definitely put more brown sugar in, and perhaps more liquid so they are not so dry.  (Once cooled, they were like crackers!  I let them sit out for several hours before putting them in a container, and then, somehow, they softened up.)  My father-in-law loved them, at least.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!!!! Bravo!! I have never made gingerbread cookies that didnt come in a box! Thought it was too difficult. The only thing I did different is instead of refidgerating it I used my cookie press and they worked wonderfully. I had a box of mix and made that and then made this and \i will tell you I WILL NEVER BUY IT THAT WAY AGAIN!!!  BRAVO I SAY!!!!

Make a couple days in advance.  I followed the recipe with the exception that i ommitted 1/2 cup flour as I knew I would add some when working with the dough.  Intially I was really dissapointed in the flavor.  I made them two days in advance of using them.  When I went to decorate two days later, the flavors had infused and the cookies were soft and delicious.  I used very little icing because I didn't want to overpower the spiciness with sweet.  Yummy!

I read reviews after I had already adjusted and made up dough from recipe to make 3 dozen cookies and was concerned about the taste when baked but the cookies were delicious and the dough was so easy to manipulate to move from counter to cookie sheet.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This year I had my neices, nephews and sisters out for a cookie baking party.  We had a blast.  This is the recipe I used.  The first batch we didn't get even close to the number of cookies we were suppose.  Then we realized we were making them too thick.  Next time I might add some more molasses, cinnamon and allspice.  I plan to make this my recipe every year.  Thanks.

This was a good cookie recipe but it did seem to be a tad bit bland at the first bite but leaves a wonderful lingering flavor on the taste buds.  I did increase the ginger and cinnamon.  It is a great dough to work with though and produces as wonderful, chewy texture.  My kids flipped over them especially after I iced some with the Gingerbread Cookie Frosting (also on this site).

This is soooo good!!!  I made a couple of batches, so I could have some gingerbread men and a gingerbread house.  It is very soft and chewy, which is good for the men, bad for the house.  I cooked the house pieces a little longer though, and it worked out perfectly.  THANK YOU!!

Great Recipe! i even used 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon :-)
PS: Due to unavailability of some ingredients in my country, i replaced the shortening with unslated butter and the molasses with melted sugar*.
I melted 1 cup of sugar with drops of lemon juice and continuous stirring.

the mixed reviews surprised me, this is a simple recipe that really works. i tried it yesterday and we all had a cookie frenzy in the evening after enjoyable colorful icing process. even before it was baked the dough was very delicious. 
i did not have some of the ingredients so i used margarine instead of shortening and skipped vanilla extract. it took more flour than recipe. i put less molasses, just above 3/4 cup. i am allergic to nutmeg to i replaced it with simple ground nuts. although i altered the recipe a lot, the end result was very tasteful. this gives you half soft cookies not all crunchy and hard ones. i recomend it.

Really good recipe.  The 1 tbs cinnamon instead of teaspoon and extra teaspoon of Ginger really kicked them up a notch. I added an extra egg and that made it even easier to work with, no need for flour when rollin out the dough only a stretch of wax paper instead. My husband absolutely loves them and can't stop eating them!

I made the recipe using just 3/4 cup of molasses and it seems to be doing good. Letting it chill now. My girls are anxious to roll it out and use cookie cutters. The dough was easy to make.

i just made the dough it is in the fridge right now though following others opnions i made my own changes. i upped each spice to 1T and after seeing somone complain about the taste of the shortening i cut that to 1/2 a cup with a half a cup of melted butter to make up the difference. with the additional spices and butter the dough tasted pretty good but i'll update after i roll it and make the cookies

This recipe is excellent. I chose to follow the suggested changes minus the all spice: the taste was wonderful, the dough was so easy to handle, and the results were perfect. Unbelievably delish!

The flavor is WONDERFUL, and they cook up nice and crisp.  However, don't chill TOO long because the dough gets REALLY hard.

Really disappointing. I've baked gingerbread several years in  a row now, and I like it savory, sweet and spicy. This recipe entirely failed in all those respects. The texture was fine, and I added more spices, but the baked cooked came out very bland despite that, with only an aftertaste of real spiciness. I think it might have been helped by more brown sugar and more molasses, but at that point, it's not worth changing the entire recipe to make it worth the effort.

Saben riquisimas estas galletas...PERO las trate de cortar en forma de Gingerbread men y la masa estaba demasiado pegostiosa. Cuando finalmente pude hacer algunos monitos, al salir del horno algunas se quedaban medias crudas y aunque las dejaba mas tiempo comoquiera seguian crudas....si tuviera paciencia las volveria a hacer...pero neee

Easy and full of what makes gingerbread good - molasses and ginger. Perfect for cutting into you favourite shapes for icing. Hard enough that they keep their shape, but soft enough to be enjoyed.

This is the BEST gingerbread cookie recipe I have tried in years!!!  The taste is very mild so children love it.  I made large gingerbread men and the dough handled well and was very smooth.  This is great to make the dough ahead and keep in the refrigerator.  Just perfect!

I was a little skeptical at first, I never made a gingerbread recipe that wasn't as hard as a brick, but this one really changed my mind! The cookies were soft, moist, and not too sweet.  Not to mention the dough was incredibly easy to work with.  Got a winner here!

I read many reviews first before making these cookies.  I halved the recipe since 6 cups of flour seemed like a lot of cookies & used 1/3 c oj instead of water and used a whole egg.  I also used half shortening and half butter. I didn't refrigerate the dough which didn't seem to matter. My cookies were nice and soft.  I did find them a bit bland.  I remade the cookies as above and doubled the spices (tripled the cinnamon)-much better tasting!

This was not the best gingerbread cookie recipe I've used.  They ended up tasting like Molasses cookies, and NOT like nice, spicy gingerbread cookies.  Overall, I'm sure they would be wonderful if the molasses amount was cut.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  It's good, and makes very soft gingerbread cookies.  That is my complaint, they're too soft.  Almost too soft to decorate.  The spice was good but I wanted it spicier, so if I were to make this recipe again, I would use more ginger.  This recipe makes a LOT of cookies!

There isn't enuff ginger. I put 2 teaspoons instead of 1. They don't need to be in the fridge for 3 hours. 30 minutes worked well. They are good with sugar cookie icing that DRIES. They aren't always the amount you want. 24 doesnt make 24 cookies. It says 3/8 of an egg. You can do 1 of 2 things: mix it in a bowl and use half or use just the whites. Both are good. Ive made these at least 5 times. They're great! (with some changes) ps. I use butter instead of shortening. Still works great!

I honestly don't know how this recipe has any bad reviews. I followed it exactly and was really happy with the results. I chilled my dough for about 8 hours to make it easier to work with, and I like them soft so I only baked them for 8 minutes, but I was very happy with the outcome! Ignore the bad reviews and try it for yourself..

I halved the recipe (with the exception of the egg, kept that whole), and had plenty of cookies.  I would use this recipe again, though I can see why someone thought they tasted dog-biscuity.  Here's what I found: the first batch in the oven were kept in a tad bit too long, and they just weren't that great.  I was a little disappointed until I pulled out the second batch, and they were perfect!  Tasted great, not too dry, and were very tasty.  I would try this recipe again, though watch that they don't get overbaked as it can ruin the taste.

I wish I would have read more of the reviews before I wasted a ton of ingredients on them! I agree with all of you who describe these as "dog biscuity". They are dry and very bland. Not what I was expecting at all.

I give it 3 stars just because I am hard to please, I made those cookies prior reading the reviews, when I was done with the dough, I thought i messed it all up, and the strong smell worried me, but put it in the fridge anyways, they came out great, I like it even though I am not a ginger bread kind of person, I was worried my sons would not like them because the flavor was really strong, I think next time I would hold on the clove, not my favorite flavor... whoever messed up this recipe, I don' t know what to say... I am not a cook at all, and followed directions by the letter, dough was easy to make, pretty easy to work with ( easier though with smaller cookie cutters) and crispy on the outside soft on the inside. Not like cardboard at all, did not taste like dog cookies at all, but hey everyone is entitled to there opinions. IF MY FAMILY LIKED IT, THEN I' M HAPPY.

This recipe tastes fine but it is the most difficult dough I have ever worked with. I could not pick these up after cutting. I eventually had to put the dough on the cookie sheet, roll and pick out the excess.

This is the first time I have ever written a review.  These were so bad I thought I would take the time.  Sorry but these were so flavorless and not sweet enough at all.  I double checked my ingredients thinking I must have overlooked something, but I didn't.  The dough rolled out easily and it was simple to do, but I didn't care for the flavor.  Sorry, can't believe so many wrote in that they loved these.  They must have a fantastic frosting recipe is all I can say. We are planning on smothering these in frosting and hoping my son's classmates can stomach them.  Very spicey.

These are great!  It looks more complicated than it is, and it's totally worth it!  I recommend adding a little powdered sugar glaze, it adds the perfect touch!  COMBINE 2 cups sifted powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons milk, 1 tablespoon melted butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract in small bowl until smooth.

I halved the recipe, maybe that is where my problem lies... but I didn't like these cookies one bit.  They were more like clove-bread cookies than ginger.  They were oddly puffy, rather than dense. I think that they would probably taste a whole lot better if one used butter instead of shortening.  The vegetable fat has a weird flavor in this context. Another recipe might be a little more satisfying if you are looking for a traditional gingerbread.

I made these cookies just as the recipe is listed.  The dough was easy to make using a stand mixer.  After the three hours of refridgeration time the dough was soft but had a tendancy to crack and break when rolling out.  The cut outs held their shape in the oven.  Unfortunately, my family and I found the taste bland and not at all sweet.  I would not recommend these cookies for eating.  However, they make great christmas tree decorations.

This was the first time I have made Gingerbread cookies, and I was quite disappointed in the taste.  They are spicy but not sweet at all.  I agree with another review that referred to them as "dog biscuits."  Not worth all the trouble of that dough, and it was all wasted!  sorry.

So after trying about 20 recipies i have to say this one was the best. It does seem complicated but it was so easy. I had to make over 200 of them for work. I am really picky when it comes to gingerbread cookies. I hate really stong ones. So i did this one and they were delicious they were soft and were not over powering. they had just enough flavor. I thought they were easy to make and all of our kids helped out. I recommend this one to anyone who has to make a good cookie.

These were great! Me and my amily loved them! I used a teensy less molasses since I am not a huge fan and they were great! I also added a bit more cinnamon since its one of my favorite spices. These were not too sweet and not too spicy, just right!! I would definitly recommend them to anyone! I will definitly be making these again next holiday season!

I was disappointed in this recipe for gingerbread. My family gets together for baking Christmas cookies and we were disappointed in the taste. I did change the cinnamon to a tablespoon and cut back on the molasses but apparently it did not help. I would not recommend this cookie.

This is not gingerbread.  what a disappointment.  I made this recipe because it makes so many cookies, not really realizing my usual recipe that makes less than half the cookies has the same amount of spices.  Do not make this recipe.  Make the Good Housekeeping cookies.

Sorry, but these gingerbread cookies were horrible. The spices were overwhelming and I thought the overall taste was just awful. I ended up throwing the entire batch in the trash.

The dough was pretty easy to work with,if you like your gingerbread cookies soft and chewy this is the recipe for you.Next time I might switch up the spices, the flavor was not that great and I had to add some icing but they were ok.

I knew I should have added different spices! These cookies taste okay, but if you cook them even just a little too long, they end up tasting terrible. Add allspice.

I found them fairly easy to make.  I doubled the ginger and still did not find them as flavourful as they should be.  Maybe some fresh grated ginger next time.

Excellent recipe! I'm only 14 and before these cookies, my cooking experience was limited to popping a lean cuisine meal into the microwave.  The recipe was very easy, and the cookies came out great.  Now whenever I could something and ask for a reaction from my family, they always say, "Good, but not as good as those gingerbread cookies - those were great!" I definately recommend this recipe.

I followed the review and added double the ginger and cloves, and less molasses. The cookies still came out tasting too much like molasses, and nothing much else.

I will not make this recipe again.  The dough crumbled in my hand after leaving it refrigerate for 3 hours.  It was impossible to roll out.  I ended up having to roll them individually just to salvage some of the dough. The recipe yields 6 dozen cookies - that is a total joke.  I got maybe 1 dozen and threw the unused dough in the garbage.  Very disappointed.

I love this recipe! It makes sooooo many cookies that I split it in half (even the egg!) but I've made it exactly like this several times and loved it every time. Icing keeps the cookies at the perfect spice-sweet balance!

Sorry but this turned out to be the worst ginger cookies ever in my household. Cinnamon must be at least tripled in the recipe as others did. I would have actually also put a bit more molasses in it too. I found the texture extremely hard, usually it is much easier to work with. The color was white when I took it out from the oven and not the typical darker gingerman colour.

I made these cookies this a.m. Christmas Eve 2012, the dough is perfect for soft cookies.  I grated fresh ginger into the recipe to add a little bite but next year I will also add more sugar. I also added a tbsp of orange juice. My husband, the gingerbread cookie lover in the family likes them a lot but thinks they should be a little sweeter.  I read some reviews that said there was too much molasses, that is funny because my husband asked me if I had put any in them.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  Now to ice them!

This a great recipe for gingerbread cookies! The dough is very easy to work with and has great flavor. The only change I made to the recipe is I omitted the ground cloves because i didn't feel like buying it. I baked them for exactly 10 minutes so that they wouldn't get to crispy and they are nice and soft. So glad I found this recipe!

I love this recipe!   I have used it for a few years now.    I tend to roll the dough out thicker and let the cookies be softer.   I also make a cinnamon/ginger frosting to drizzle over the top.   I always make them star shaped and add red decorative sugar.   They look and taste great.   Oh, and I'm always a little loose with the vanilla cinnamon and ginger.   To each her own, right?

I enjoyed making this recipe.  I had to chnage shortening to butter. I don't believe in them.  Also, I had to chnage the amount of spice.  I needed to add more spice to bring up flavour. Otherwise, I think this recipe was good!

These cookies were too hard for my liking. They didn't taste good. If I were to make these again, I would just use it to make a Ginger Bread house instead.

Keep using this recipe over and over its all in the decoration. Refrigerating and cooling the dough is the secret for the best cut outs.

Gave this a 3 because you can still utilize the dough.  If you are looking for a recipe to "build" a gingerbread house, this would be the one.  Just don't eat the house when you are done.  The shortening in this recipe is horrible.  I even tried 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter, but it didn't help.  It is very crisp and cardboard-like and will work well for a house, but the flavor is not good.

I only cooked my cookies for 10 minutes and they ended up a bit over-cooked.  I chilled the dough overnight, just because that's the way I've done gingerbread my whole life, and they rolled out and cut perfectly.  This was NOT my most favorite gingerbread recipe, but it was pretty good.  I will continue on my search for the "perfect", soft gingerbread cookie.

I followed the recipe exactly and we did not like the flavor. It seemed like there just wasn't enough of the spices for our taste. I've had much better tasting Gingerbread cookies, so I'll try a different recipe next time.

These sure did have a weird taste. Maybe less molasses and a little more sugar next time would help. Also the cloves were a super-strong flavor. (And normally we do like cloves.) We'll probably use these for decorating the house, as they are nearly inedible. I guess I'll keep looking for a good gingerbread recipe! Dancing Deer has a great kit, but $20 is a bit steep for us...

I was seriously underwhelmed by this recipe...the reviews had given me high hopes that were not met.

The dough is easy- a joy to work. The finished product does indeed have an excellent moist texture.

I followed the ingredients list completely and used the exact amounts indicated. I bought ALL the ingredients brand new for this recipe, so they were as fresh and potent as possible. Unfortunately, I found the taste of the cookies to be pretty bland- lacking in both spice and sweetness.

I might try the recipe again, but increase the spices and molasses/brown sugar by 1/4 or 1/3...

They were very soft, but lacked flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, but they just weren't good. They were indeed soft though, excellent texture!! But I recommend going much heavier on the spices.

These held the cookie cutter shape perfectly.  They also stayed nice and soft for over a week (stored in a zip bag). My only complaint is that the flavor seemed to be lacking something.  I suspect that all three of the above qualities (soft and shapely yet bland) are caused by the shortening, which I usually try to avoid using anyway.  So, I will keep looking for the perfect gingerbread recipe.

this was a great recipe! It definitely doesn't taste like store bought mixes so if that's what you're expecting, plan to be disappointed. Otherwise, it's delicious! I too reduced the amount of molasses. I was also out of ground ginger and so I used about 3T of pumpkin pie spice as my only spice.I also substituted some wheat flour for white and the taste is hardly noticeable.

Quick and easy.  My only change, and this is personal taste, would be to add more ginger and cinnamon.

This recipe would be ideal for pieces for a gingerbread house. The baked cookies are very firm and will not crack or bend with lots of toppings. 
However, I wanted a tasty, spicy, chewy gingerbread cookie and this was not it.

I just was looking for a cookie recipe at first. But then I saw a lot more exciting foods to cook. For the holidays and for just after school, home from work quick and easy meals. And now I am hooked. And on those Sundays after church meals are even better. They have recipes for everyone q

I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only two things I changed were adding extra ginger and decreasing molasses to 3/4 c. MY cookies needed sugar which is probably why some people said they taste like dog biscuits. I’m not sure why 6 cups of four is needed because other recipes use 3 cups. This recipe might be palatable if you play with the measurements. I would add sugar or decrease the flour but it needs work.

I couldnt find MY (written) recipe so in a pinch I made this as stated and added orange zest. The raw batter was okay but not six dozen blah cookies! Ugh! ...dog biscuit reject! Their saving grace by my peppermint buttercream frosting and a holy ton of sugar sprinkles.

This recipe is terrible. I made this exactly as called for. The cookies came out nice and soft, but were unedible. The taste was purely molasses. I then made cream cheese icing to try and make it better but that didn't work. I just wasted so much time

I used butter in place of shortening and removed the cloves because cloves tend to be over powering to me. Thanks for the recipe :) I also increased to cinnamon like previous reviewers.... but that might just be a me thing because my family LOVES cinnamon.

This recipe was easy to follow, but not very flavorful. When eating a gingerbread cookie I expect a bold, rich, flavor of Ginger and Cinnamon. This had neither of those flavors...all I tasted was flour. I don't think I'll be using this recipe again and I know I definitely won't be giving away these cookies as Christmas gifts as intended. If you like bland cookies, then this recipe is for you.

Awful. Dry and chalky with very little flavor. A waste of a lot of ingredients. After tasting the first batch, I turned the rest into shapes for a gingerbread house, since no one eats those anyway. The dough was fun to play with and easy to work, but that's the ONLY good thing about these cardboard like "cookies".

I made the recipe, swapping out 50/50 coconut oil/butter mixture.( I didn’t have shortening on hand.) for rolling out and cutting, this dough is very easy to work with. 

Taste is OK. I think I’d put more ginger, maybe even sugar (which I almost never want more of).  I think if I ice it, it’ll be better. As far as eating, it’s not my favorite. I was hoping for more of a butter cookie texture, these were very solid, but not in a crispy sweet way.  B/c of the texture, I think this may work GREAT for building.

Best gingerbread cookie recipe ever!  
I used real butter instead of shortening which made the moist!  I will continue using this in years to come!!!

Loved these. I took the suggestion about using butter in place of 1/2 the shortening and used extra spices for a more flavorful cookie.

This was horrible! I don't know what happened, but they came out hard as a rock! They also did not taste very great... They lacked sugar and all I could taste was molasses. Do not recommend

Great Recipe! The only thing I would suggest is rolling out the cookie dough between plastic wrap. Adding flour to roll the dough leaves the white flour on your pretty brown dough! Thank you for the recipe! Merry Christmas Everyone!! Have a Happy, Healthy New Year!

Wonderful recipe, I did make some changes though. Instead of molasses I used honey. I also used allspice instead of cloves and canola oil instead of shortening. Worked great.  I made it for family and friends and had to make more.

Don't do it! I've had better cookies made by kindergarten kids using playdough instead of flour.  
Needs more of the cinnamon and nutmeg, not to mention ginger.  Maybe a bit less molasses and more brown sugar.  They held their shape nicley so one star for that. 
Not worth making again.  They all went into the garbage and I didn't even bother rolling out all the dough. 
So sad ??

About 20  years ago I had this recipe and lost it to a hard drive crash.  I've been looking for it ever since and I am so pleased to have found it!  The dough is amazing; shiny, malleable, soft... like millionaire's play dough lol  When you bake it, not only does it not spread, it holds lovely detail for formed or sculpted cookies.  The taste is homestyle and the bite is soft.  I really like this recipe.  :)

I found my "dough" turned out much too crumbly. It is suggested to add water only 1tbs at a time, though I ended up doing it 1/3 of a cup at a time. Afterward it all turned out great! :)

I followed this recipe exactly. I refrigerated the dough overnight as I didn't have time the day before. Maybe that's why my dough crumbled after I took it out of the fridge. Got about 12 cookies out of the crumbled dough and they look terrible. Lots of cracks!! I won't make this recipe again!!!

Great texture. Beginner friendly. 
The only thing I would change is double the amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg. I bake a lot. I felt everything else was spot on. DO NOT CUT DOWN THE MOLASSES, use a full cup. (1 cup) 
I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I made the cookies exactly as per the recipe (exact American cup sizes) set the oven temp to 20c lower then in recipe as using a fan oven. They only need 10 minutes as 12 will make them harder. They are perfect to ice or leave as is.  I did not cut back on any ingredients or make changes. They turn out soft and puffy, but keep their shape well. They remind me of the German gingerbread. I think for any body leaving a negative review it could be because you are not using the correct measures....With regards to the dough being crumbly you need to make sure you have a cool work surface, you need to work at a medium pace so the dough has time to adjust to room temperature (slightly) but not so much that it gets soft. The oven needs to be set to the correct temperature (adjust for fan assisted) and do not substitute as that is when things go wrong...

This  recipe was great! But I did change it a little. I would recommend replacing the nutmeg and ground cloves with 1 Tbs pumpkin pie spice. The only  problem I have with these cookies is that they are not quite as  crisp as I was hoping, but still, I would totally make it again!

This recipe is WAY TOO DRY. It came out just crumbly. I added 1/3 cup more liquid which made  it quite gummy. Also the flavour was weak. Not enough ginger.

Made with my daughters and it was so easy. Used the suggested change of 1 Tbsp cinnamon and I used wheat flour for half the flour and did not reduce the molasses.  Instead of icing them, I let the girls put crystal sugar sprinkles on them before baking. They are perfect and so delicious! Next time, and there will be a next time soon, I will roll out some a little thinner. I like a crispier cookie with my tea!

I should have followed the original recipe and put in the whole cup of molasses as with only 3/4 cup it wasn't sweet enough for my likes. It did roll out nice and I used the suggestions of others to increase spices which I am glad I did. Next year, I will keep the molasses where it should be and you should too to avoid cardboard comparisons.

I did as other reviewers stated and decreased the molasses to 3/4 c and doubled the cinnamon, omitted the cloves, and added a teaspoon of allspice. These were incredibly difficult to roll out unless warmed up a bit, and even then, not ideal. You have to be extremely gentle with it while rolling or it crumbles. They came out dry and tasteless and I was very careful while rolling out not to incorporate too much flour. Tried rolling out between wax paper sheets and that was worse, it stuck to the paper even when straight out of the fridge.  I will return to my mother's recipe and probably not make these again. Lacking flavor and moisture.

I have never written a review for a recipe before, but am so frustrated with this one that I want to warn others against using this recipe.  I am very glad I halved the recipe so did not waste even more ingredients. It was impossible to roll out, and the cookies ended up tasting like cardboard, with a little shortening and molasses.  Ugh, wasted so much time on these!

i made the recipe as is.  definately too much molasses.  has a very strong spice taste.  some people may love it but i prefer gingerbread to be more of a subtle taste.  could be improved with some adjustments but for whats its worth i'd just try something else

If you want a cookie that isn't too strong then this is an okay recipe.  I however, prefer more flavor and to me these were just bland - thats after I added twice as much cinammon and extra cloves.  In my opinion the amount of ginger should probably be doubled.  I also added a tablespoon of orange rind which is probably the only thing that saved them from being tossed...  I also ended up covering them in a glaze with ginger sprinkled over the top in an attempt to get more flavor out of them.  The recipe was easy to make though and the dough was very nice to work with, and didn't have much spread so your gingerbread men wont lose their shape!  Ill still be finding a different recipe next time!

I always use real butter in place of shortening and these turned out great! I also used 1.5 tablespoons of ginger because I just love it. :)

I don't usually post a negative review, but save your money and effort. These are great for decorating the tree with, as the hold together nicely, but they taste terrible!

I just finished the dough and put it in the refrigerator for the asked three hours and now I am reading the reviews and I am apprehensive, because they are so mixed. I hope they turn out good because it is the 23rd and I am planning to bring these as a hostess present for tomorrow. I didn't change anything with the recipe. Now I am making some icing to decorate them. It is 23:15 and they really better turn out great because I won't have time to make another batch.

2:45am; I only kept the dough refrigerated for 1h30. They turned out really great. I made some royal icing and with or without the icing they taste great. Yeah!!! However 12 minutes is too long; I kind of overcooked the first batch. but the ones after were good.

Yummy. Only 14 years old and I made this work. I was scared that they wouldn't be good because of the other reviews but I think it's better with 3/4 of molasses it's just perfect :) and decorated them after. It takes time but we need patience right? Anyways amazing cookies :)

This recipe is great, but I suggest cutting it in half. I'm drowning in cookies. I gave half of them to my mom and she had to get rid of them by giving it to her friends and then she had to bury them in the backyard. It never ends. Every time I think I have eaten  the last cookie, 10 more appear.

I used 1 Tbsp cinnamon instead of 1 tsp.  I left out cloves.  I used 3/4 c molasses instead of 1 cup and added 1/4 c dark corn syrup plus an extra 1/4 c brown sugar.

I mean no disrespect, but these are the worst gingerbread cookies we have ever tasted.  We followed the recipes exactly.  We were hoping to make a delicious holiday treat as a family activity, but we will try a different recipe tomorrow.  If you don't like the taste or smell of food made with shortening, then avoid this recipe.

I tried this recipe yesterday and I followed the recipe instead of others tweeks thinking that I should try as written before changing. The dough was easy to work with but wouldn't let me roll out more than 3x and the cookies were kind of bland and boring. I will say that if I do decide to try it again I will definitely up the spices as others suggest. I used a whole cup Molasses because you can't over do it and I thought it might keep them more moist.

I made only 1/2 of this recipe. I subbed 3/8 cups of molasses instead of 1/2 cups. I doubled the cinnamon and ginger, and only refrigerated the dough for an hour or so. I subbed in butter for shortening and baked at 180C. They turned out really well.

It is a very delicious cookie! I made them today. The only thing I don't like is that you need icing! It is very dry, and hard to eat by it's self. I like this because it is soft and very tasty, and it only takes 10-12  minutes! Overall very good recipe!

The texture was great-- soft almost like cake which I love.  But the sweetness was lacking and could've used a little salt.  I was surprised at how soft the dough was, but was very pleased with how easily it rolled out and cut.  So add about 1/2 tsp salt and up the sugar just a dash and this would definitely be a winner.  I will make it again with modifications.

I changed the amount of servings to 36. and it was a mess.
The dough was pitch black, so I had to add about 130g more of flour, but the bitterness of the molasses wouldn't go away. I even reduced 120mL to 90mL. What did I do wrong??!!?!? But again, it was probably me that made the mistake.  Thankyou for the recipe! I'll have to try again somtime.

This was my first attempt in many years. I made these for my two sons who won't get any until Christams :-) They are sure to be a hit with them. For me they could have been a little more gingery, but that's just my tastes.

I made these cookies and found that it took a long time to add the dry to the wet ingredients.  But that is not the issue I really had it was the end result that I was unhappy with.  They were not sweet enough and and lacked spice. All in all very flat when it comes to taste.  The recipe called for 1 cup molasses when it should have called for 3/4 cup. I wouldn't recomend this recipe to anyone.  Sorry.

Best gingerbread man recipe!  Soft yet firm and holds up. Dough is very easy to work with.  I didn't change the recipe at all and it tastes great.  Not a very sweet cookie but perfect with some icing. So yummy with tea.  Rolling between two pieces of Saran wrap worked like a charm.

Not my favourite cookie recipe. I lowered the molasses and doubled the cinnamon as suggested. Still...too molassesey and not enough cinnamon flavour. Disappointed. Will be looking for another gingerbread recipe.

These are fabulously balanced in flavor. For all who think the flavor is insufficiently spiced - buy new bottles of the spices, or buy fresh and grind yourself. Certainly if you want something more of this or more of that, you can, but for balance, overall taste, consistency and ease of use, you must try these as they are. And take it from a guy that has licked every desert mixing bowl near me since in 40 years, including at the restaurants I worked at, the dough is edible raw.

While this recipe was super easy to work with, it turned out quite bland- it did not pass the husband test. I guess I prefer a spicier cookie. If I make it again I'd add more spices overall. I'll keep searching for a good gingerbread cookie recipe!

I hate to give this only 3 stars but I just didn't like them. I only used 3/4 cup of molasses like others suggested but followed everything else.  The taste too much like flour.  They cooked nice and rolled excellent (my 5yr old was able to do it) but even my cookie loving husband doesn't like them much.  I was careful not to use too much flour when rolling but maybe I did something wrong.

I gave this two stars only because the texture and look of the cookies was nice, but otherwise, bland, bland bland. These did not satisfy my craving for gingerbread cookies at all.

I made these for Christmas and did not alter the recipe at all. They had a very interesting flavor and the soft texture was wonderful. My entire family really liked them.

I found the flavor didn't quite come out. I must not have used enough ginger or something and the dough was hard to work with to get it soft. However, once the cookies were rolled out, they baked up nice as they didn't spread and were crisp on the outside and a bit chewy on the inside.

A little strong on the molasses. If it was sweeter it would have been ok, but as it was, there was a little too much molasses.

The dough was easy to handle and they rolled out great. For me they had too strong of a molassas flavor. Maybe next time I will reduce the molassas. Once they were frosted they weren't too bad and they seemed to go over well with family and friends.

These are WONDERFUL homemade gingerbread men!  There is a definite molasses taste, as others have mentioned, but if you like real gingerbread you will love the taste it gives these cookies.  They are really moist, and I have gotten lots of compliments on them!

I used this recipe to make Gingerbread man cookies for my kindergarten class. They kept asking for more. Thank you. They loved the cookies.

The only bad thing about this recipe is that it produces a really dry cookie. Better for decoration than consumption. The kids had a great time working the dough. It was very good dough, easy to roll and cut.

This was a great recipie, everyone loved it and asked for the recipie. I liked the idea of splitting the dough into thirds. It made it so easy to work with. It's a great, non messy dough. I got rave reviews when I made them.
