I love a good fresh cranberry relish!!  I have been making my own version of this for several years, and it is DEMANDED!! not requested  :)  every year for Thanksgiving.  One note:  I add chopped pecans and some allspice to mine.  And it is best to make at least one day ahead to let the flavors blend together.  Just an idea to try for your own.  Happy Turkey day!

Aside from making a huge mess with my food processor, everyone LOVED this recipe.  I added crushed pineapple, pecans and used Splenda instead of sugar.  Be sure to strain for couple minutes before adding sugar and refridgerating.

I'm not a big cranberry fan and this was so good I took a bowl of it to work for lunch.  Everybody including all the grandkids who won't touch the "sauce" at least tasted it and said it was good.

This has been a family favorite for years. Watch out for the sugar - it will depend upon the sweetness of the oranges and apples. We also add chopped nuts sometimes.

Very good, but a little tart.  I added 2/3 c. drained crushed pineapple and that was exactly what it needed.  Perfect!

This was a nice change from cranberry sauce which I don't care for. Very refreshing! I will have this for more than Thanksgiving.

We've made this every year for years now.  It's fabulous.  I usually make it a day or two beforehand.  The texture is best if you let it drain in a strainer for an hour or so.  If it gets too dry, just add a little of the drained liquid back in.

I've used this recipe for a few years and my family loves it.  I've tried this as a cold relish and have cooked it as well.  My family prefers it cooked, so that's how I usually prepare it.  I also put it in pint jars, process it in a water bath caner and give it out as a thanksgiving gift.  We often eat it after thanksgiving on leftover rolls and sometimes over ice cream.
