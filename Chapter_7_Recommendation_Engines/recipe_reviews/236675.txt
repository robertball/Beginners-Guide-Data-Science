This was so fast to make! I did not heat the milk separately. Simply melted the butter added the flour, whisked it to make a roux, and slowly add the milk while continuing to whisk the mixture. Buffalo mozzarella is easy to find, one brand is made by Galbani it won't specifically say buffalo mozzarella but it's the same thing. I followed the recipe the rest of the way except I used Panko breadcrumbs... Fantastic recipe!!!

The whole family absolutely loved this! It was perfectly cheesy and creamy.  I used the Roasted Garlic Marinara by Barilla and OMG- that sauce is fantastic! I definitely found my go to store bought sauce!

I really liked this recipe, especially since the mozzarella was interspersed throughout the dish instead of all being on top. It was easy to make and heated up beautifully for leftovers. Hubby wasn't too impressed, but the kids and I really liked it (and they usually only want chicken nuggets.) An excellent meal alongside a salad and garlic bread. Five stats yum.

This is a great comfort dish. I love cheese so I sprinkled some on top of the breadcrumbs, making it extra cheesy. Everything about this dish is tasty - I have no complaints and I'll be making this again.

As others have stated, this dish is labor intensive. In my opinion, the final outcome wasn't worth all the work, as we thought this meal was just okay. My husband stated that he wished it had meat in it.
I did like the flavor combo of the bechamel and red sauces - but because this took so many pans on the stove at the same time, plus the baking dish, I don't think this is something that will make it into our dinner rotation very often.
The only change I made was to cover the top in additional cheese layer with the bread crumbs to entice the kids to eat it.

This was just OK for my gang.  My 14yo daughter made this by herself and it was certainly easy enough and uncomplicated. She boiled the pasta then placed it in a baking dish.  Using the same pot from the pasta she made the Bechamel sauce in it. Rather than dirty another pot she heated the milk in the measuring cup in the microwave.  She did add garlic and some pesto she found in the fridge to bump up the flavor along with crushed red pepper.  The pasta baked very nicely and was cheesy but the main thought from everyone was they did not like the "jarred sauce essence" and were left wishing it had some ricotta mixed in. No one left the table hungry but we won't likely make again.

I'm a fan of baked ziti and often find recipes that use all red sauce or all bechamel. This recipe uses a combination of both which I love. Don't skip the bread crumbs on top, it finishes this dish off with tasty perfection.

I'm giving this four stars due to the fact that it really does dirty up a lot of dishes!  I made a lot of changes but I DID keep the original intent intact so we'll go with that.  I used shell pasta (my favorite shape and the only thing in the cabinet) and added some portobello mushrooms.  I didn't have any pasta sauce so I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes.  Added garlic, onion, and fresh basil.  I also used a combination of goat cheese and fontina.  My husband actually said, "This is pretty good!" and got seconds.  If I could at least save myself the trouble of the béchamel sauce for the dirty pan, that would be amazing!

It was good but as Bibi said, not convenience food. It took quite awhile to prepare. I liked the flavor but it tasted like it had a little too much marinara in it. I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to it after reading the other reviews. For me, I'd give it three stars. However, my boys, husband and best friend all loved it and wanted seconds. So that brings it up to four. All a matter of preference :)

This was good, and though it uses some prepared foods, it is not exactly convenience food.  I followed the recipe closely, and I thought the finished product could have the flavor amped up by the addition of some additional herbs or some garlic.  It was a nice Sunday lunch though, and I feel like a fussed a little bit.  DH and DS enjoyed it, and they would be happy for me to make it again.

We enjoyed this dish.  I didn't have any ziti, so had to substitute rigatoni, which worked out just fine.  While delicious, I would have preferred a stronger tomato flavor and less of the bechamel sauce flavor. I might add some drained canned tomatoes next time I make this.  I also  used the same pan I cooked the pasta in after I drained it to make the bechamel sauce and heated the milk in the microwave in a glass measure, which saved on dishes.

I like this one.  It's simple to make, it has a nice flavor and it's cheese and pasta; what's not to like?  I added a little more salt to bring up the flavor of the cheese and I left out the nutmeg just for preference.

The hardest part about this recipe is the sauce at the beginning. After that, it is easy peasy! I made this as a Mother’s Day dish for my mom and grandma. My grandma is an incredibly picky eater and she even enjoyed it. I will definitely be making this one again!

This recipe took a bit of time but the sauce turned out great making this a creamy tomato ziti dish. Was so tired of eating dried up ziti dishes. I added cooked ground beef to it as a husband favorite and it still was very delicious.

Personally I didn't like this. The sauce wasn't as good as I'd hoped. I added a can of sliced black olives to the mix and put some cheese on top with the bread crumbs. I used very high end Parmesan-Reggiano and mozzarella as well. My boyfriend did like it though, so there's that at least. However, the bechamel sauce seemed to take away from the recipe in my opinion instead of allowing the marinara to shine through.

I loved the combination of bechamel and red sauce in this recipe. The breadcrumbs on the top was a nice touch, and it was cheesy, which is GOOD!

Great Recipe!  My family loved it!  It does take three pans on the stove at once, but it is worth it.  The béchamel sauce took longer to thicken than the recipe mentioned, but I just kept whisking until thickened.  I think that the added nutmeg (I used fresh) gave it a great flavor.  I used Barilla Spicy Marinara Sauce for added flavor.  I would highly recommend trying the recipe --You won't be sorry!

We really liked this dish!!  I used regular mozzarella because I couldn't find buffalo mozzarella.  It did take 3 saucepans and a bit of time to make, but it was worth it...yummy!!

This was wonderful. It is a bit labor intensive as it takes three sauce pans to make but the end results are worth it. We served it with some fresh chopped parsley/basil combo on top and my family was raving. Be sure to have hot water ready to do the dishes as the cheese will bake on tight! Delicious.. thanks, Barilla!

Just okay.  I used regular fresh mozzarella, not buffalo mozzarella.  The cheeses are sooo good on their own, but the finished dish was not worth the cost of the cheeses in my opinion. Too bad because I really wanted to like it.
