In my view a bean salad is a bean salad is a bean salad.  They're all good, but none really stands out from another.  But THIS one? One thought says it all - the lime dressing makes THIS bean salad stand-out delicious!

This was a great recipe, thanks! If followed exactly, its quite yummy, and theres much room to tinker and adjust as well. Sometimes I add crushed garlic, or switch the cilantro out for basil. Have yet to find a combo that didn't work. I've made this a half dozen times since finding this recipe less than 2 months ago!

I was a little concerned about 1 tsp of pepper, but it wasn't too much.  The lime really brightens this salad (I added just a little more lime juice).  Pretty nice bean salad, and a healthy dose of daily fiber.

Really good salad. Dressing was perfect. The only thing I did different was add chopped red bell pepper as well.  Perfect for cook out or pot luck - no mayo to go bad!

The best Bean Salad I have ever eaten.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing!  The  flavors are so bright and fresh it brings  bean salad to a whole  level.   I personally do not like the taste of lime but in this,  it was amazing.  I will be making this many more times this summer.

Delicious!  I did make a few adjustments though.  I added 2 tsp dried cilantro (one third the amount of fresh cilantro the recipe called for since dried is stronger), and I added one whole tomato and one whole cucumber, simply because I didn't think half of each would be enough. I will definitely make this again.  Extremely easy and yummy.

Easy. Tasty. Added 1/2 clove of garlic. Makes enough. Not so much where you have to eat for days! Perfect for a bbq.

Delicious bean salad. I added green peppers, but followed the recipe otherwise.

This is one of the top recipes I've made from this site.  It's fresh, delicious and healthy.  Every time I have made it (which has been nearly every gathering recently), someone asks me for the recipe.  It is SO good!

Excellent!   Quick , easy & healthy. I  was out of cilantro  and planned on buying more but, the salad was gone before I got to the store! I made it the next day and used lemon juice because I was out of lime (no zest either) and it was still excellent. This is a very flexible recipe. I added some olives to my serving and they were delicious.

I made it, and I will make it again.  The flavors are refreshing in summer.  I like the fact that the ingredients are unprocessed, and there isn't any sugar in it.  I think  it would be delicious like a few Mexican salsas that use mango, jicama, or other sweet fruit for a small zing.

We thought this was really good.  Added at least twice as much cucumber and tomato because we got so many veggies from the CSA. Light and refreshing- love the fresh lime and cilantro dressing.  The only thing that might make it better is a bit of extra time for the canned beans to marinate in the dressing.

It was pretty good, but I found that the black beans were a little bit too crunchy for my liking. Maybe that is because I started with dry beans.

Love this. Have made it for years, since a friend's wife brought it. to a summer picnic and we loved it. There are two differences in her recipe and one is to omit the oil. The other is that the black beans are optional - LOTS of carbs w/ both garbanzos and black beans so I omit them. This recipe adds the lime zest though and that hadn't occurred to me. Delicious!

This salad is just amazing. It is so simple yet so flavorful. I've made it 3 times now, as it is great to have ready for quick lunches. I leave out the raw onion and cucumber, as I just don't enjoy those flavors. And I've found I can cut the oil down to 2 tbs with no consequences. Tonight I went to make it and realized I had no garbanzos! So I used fava beans, which added another whole dimension. I certainly suggest trying that if you are a fan of fava beans. Fava and garbanzos together would really pack a punch... Might try that next time!

This was absolutely delicious. I put in a little more lime to counter the cilantro. I don't like cilantro. And I used green onions because that's what I had in hand. Excellent bean salad!!

Great recipe! Thank you for sharing. I wanted something different and selected this from all the other bean salad recipes. For kicks and colors I added frozen/thawed/rinsed/drained petite sweet corn and petite sweet peas, and let the finished product marinate for more than a day (be sure to mix product or transfer to another container a couple times while marinating). Others like it also and received a couple requests for the recipe. Will most likely reduce the pepper next time.
