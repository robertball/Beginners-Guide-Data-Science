This tastes so much like mexican wedding cake. It was great, but all you need is a small piece, very rich.

SOOOOOOO good.  If you try this, be prepared for a very sweet and very rich, but delicious treat.  I love it.  The filling sandwiched between grahamn crackers with that delicious icing on top was so easy to make and the cherries are the perfect addition in the filling!! MMMMMMMM....

This was really good.  I think it needed about half of the frosting though.

Wonderful!  But definitely very sweet.  I would suggest a lighter frosting, maybe a cream cheese?  But absolutely fantastic.  I will make again for sure.
