My hubby has issues with elevated blood pressure. The taco seasoning in the packet is mostly salt and other non-natural ingredients that humans should not consume like monosodium glutamate (MSG which is a flavor enhancer). The cheese has enough sodium to meet the daily allowance. Instead of the seasoning packet I added chili powder cumin cayenne pepper and black pepper. Instead of Ro-Tel I diced roma tomatoes and chilies. It was delicious and with all the spices my husband did not notice that salt was not added. I would definitely make this again.

Quick easy and so yummy! I flattened two BLSL chicken breasts coated them with the taco seasoning pan fried them in olive oil removed them from the pan chopped them up and covered them to keep them warm and moist. Then I cooked everything else according to recipe directions adding the chopped chicken breast to the pan with the cheese. So good! I will definitely make this again.

Very easy recipe and we loved the dish. We will be making it again maybe with a little more spice for extra kick. This is a great addition to our "what do we do with the leftover chicken" file. Thanks!

We had this for dinner last night. Instead of Rotel I used a can of fire roasted green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes. I left out the water and made the rice on the side to mix in because I didn't have any instant rice. Everyone at it! That's amazing with 4 kids. I'm going to try to make it in the crock pot next time.

I boiled my chicken first then shred it for this recipe then used the water needed for the recipe from the boiled chicken water to add a bit more chicken flavor. I avoided the oil and just added everything into the pan and cooked it and didn't have a problem with anything sticking. The Rotel Original was a bit spicy for the family so next will also use mild. My husband doesn't like sour cream so those who wanted it just added it on top. We really enjoyed this recipe and will certainly make again.

Everyone in my family of 5 ate it all up with no complaints, just compliments. Even my super picky 7 year old daughter who eats like a bird ate all of the large bowl I gave her by accident!  That deserves 5 stars to me! 
It was also super easy to make! Bonus!

Family loved this recipe - Even the picky 10 year old. We recently substituted beef for the chicken and it was amazing! This recipe is on high rotation in our house.

This tasted great. My husband hates brown rice but it tasted so good that he went back for seconds!! The only change I made was that I used shredded pizza cheese it was the only one I had at home.

I enjoyed it it's simple. I needed to spice it up with hot sauce I also ate it with salsa. I wish it has a little more flavor.

Good but too spicy for my 9 year old. Next time I ll do regular diced tomatoes. It was good with plain yogurt mixed in as a sub for sour cream.

This was very simple and delicious. Loved by all including my 18 month old who kept coming back for more and then started helping himself to my plate when I walked away for a moment.

My family really liked this even my picky eater. This is a good recipe base very forgiving for adaptations based on what you have on hand. I had leftover cooked chicken and was out of Ro-tel (that NEVER happens in this house!). I substituted a can of enchilada sauce some hot sauce and some very chunky salsa for the Ro-tel. I followed the base instructions cooking only the onion adding the liquids and then the rice once boiling. I threw the beans and about 3 cups of chopped chicken on top and covered while the rice cooked. Once done I also mixed in about a cup of cooked corn (cleaning out the fridge!). We like it spicy and mine needed more liquid so I added salsa to suit our tastes. Got a big thumbs up from all my boys--will absolutely make again. I will probably add more cheese next time.

We have a 4 and 6 yr old and used Rotel Original. It was a little too spicy for them but we loved it with cilantro and sour cream. Next time I will try the Rotel Mild instead.

My whole family including 7 yr old son and 13 yr old daughter love this. I use a can of regular diced tomatoes and add chopped poblano pepper instead of using the Rotel and I add some corn which gives it a pop of sweetness. I also use jasmine rice (bc that's what is a staple in our pantry) and cook it for 20 mins instead of 5-7 mins. Finally I've tried it both ways but I prefer the Frontera liquid ground beef taco sauce (even with chicken) to the dry taco seasonings. We like to eat it with soft flour tortillas.

Made this very last minute for a potluck. Added a little extra taco seasoning and cheese. I substituted white rice for the brown since I didn't have the latter on hand. Everyone LOVED it. Didn't have any leftover sadly.
