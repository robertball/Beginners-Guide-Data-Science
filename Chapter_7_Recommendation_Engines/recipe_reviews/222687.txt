Good pops.   Used vanilla flavored greek yogurt instead of plain yogurt plus vanilla extract.  Will try with more sweetener and a touch of salt next time

I used vanilla greek yogurt and upped the vanilla to a full teaspoon. I used dixie cups and popsicle sticks. They turned out fantastic--even my husband loved them!

I made this recipe because of it's use of Stevia. The flavor is excellent and prep is not difficult, at all.

If you like  tart things, feel free to nix the stevia and vanilla! They're delicious that way. Haven't tried them with the stevia and vanilla yet, but will next time.

I enjoyed this with my sister ho serves in the air force. I finally got to see her again so making this brought use together as well.
