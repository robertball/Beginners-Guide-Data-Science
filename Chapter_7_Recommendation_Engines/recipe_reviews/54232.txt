I didn't have all the fresh herbs, so I just used a good handful of parsley. I doubled the garlic because I had a big fish. 20 minutes was the perfect amount of time. Thanks for sharing.

This was wonderful!  :o)   The lemon gets all caramely, the herbs are fresh & the grill flavor comes thru in the flavor of the fish.   I brined the fish for 20 min.  to ensure it would turn out moist & I was blown away that fish on the grill could turn out this way!  The brine was 2 c. water, 1 Tbsp kosher salt, 1 tsp. sugar, for 20 min.  Sprayed the grill and both sides of the outside of the fish with Pam....no tin-foil needed!  Cooked perfectly without falling apart.  Thank you, will definitely use this again!

DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE FRESH STUFF, I USED SOME GROUND ROSEMARY AND DRIED BASIL SPRINKLED INSDE WITH FRESH SLICED GARLIC AND POURED 1 T OF LEMON JUICE OVER EACH FISH.  COOKING TIME WAS PERFECT.

YUMMO Emily!! Hubby cooked freshly caught trout on the grill as one of our appy's for Mom's Day. What a treat this was! Added some onion powder to the seasoning mix but left out the rosemary. Didn't even need the foil as it worked well directly on the grates. We were all fighting over the last piece. Thanks so much!!

This was a very simple way to fix fresh fish.  We prepared some fresh Kokanee this way, and the flavor was delightfully subtle.  Thx Emily, for this recipe.

Great recipe :) I cooked it on the grill in the backyard and since I think the fillets I got were thin, it didn't take but 5-10 minutes to cook. It flaked right off the skin and had great flavor (I prepped them about an hour before grilling them to let the flavors come out a bit)

I served this for my husband and myself for Valentines Day. I had some extra limes to use up, so I threw them in, too. I also added fresh oregano and marjoram(what was I thinking on that one?)which really made for a strange taste.I hate to let things go to waste, so I'll often just toss them in with the other ingredients, hoping for the best. I will try this next time as written. I cooked them for about eight minutes per side, which was perfect. Overall, a yummy, fun way to cook fresh fish.

pretty good - we sprinkled ours with parmesan cheese. goes well with baked potatoes, which are also easy to do camping.

Very good and tasty. Easy to fix, could do without the rosemary though.

It was good.  Not quite enough flavor for me, but good and much healthier than pan frying.
