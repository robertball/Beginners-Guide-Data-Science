The only change that I made was to sprinkle both white and brown sugar on the top crust with the dotted butter.
It is the best pie that I have ever made!  My husband said that it was so good that he could have eaten it without vanilla ice cream (that would have been a first).  I will definitely make this again, and again.

What  a great idea to bake this in a cast iron skillet. I always bake my fruit pies till they bubble,  so,  the skillet depth keeps the pie from overflowing.  My daughter in law made this first, but found it too sweet.  So I reduced both the brown sugar and the white sugar by  half.  (I did have sweet apples tho).  I will definitely make this again, and, next time, will reduce the butter by half.  Will let you know how it turns out!  ps: don't expect to even find that bottom crust after covering it with apples.

I made with a few times with adjustments and each time pie was wonderful.  I mixed my sugar seasoning mix with apples before putting over pie crust.  (seasons 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1 tsp Apple Pie Spice)  Next Time I will add 1-2 more apples.   My skillet is bigger than 9" so I gently stretched the 9" room temp pre made pie crusts with rolling pin just a touch so I had a little edge to crimp and seal.  No big deal if you don't have enough pie crust to seal. The yummy sugar butter mix just oozes up over the top crust when it bakes but regardless put aluminum foil at bottom of oven to catch bubble over just in case.   I also had to bake mine longer than the recommended 45 min at 350.

Hot mess. Came out great. Just not out of the skillet lol.  Not a snowball chance in hell youâ€™ll ever seam the two crusts together. Served warm right out of skillet. Definitely make it again

Easy and by far the best! I wasn't able to connect the two crusts(top to bottom) but it was still awesome! It didn't come out of skillet in slices more like globs of Apple pie like greatness. Made this twice and still getting requests for it!

Husband loved it, went back for seconds imediatly. He said if an apple pie and a cinnamon roll had a baby this would be it. We like how the bottom almost crystalisezes. Super easy. I was making pie because I had a bag of apples that were to tart to eat plain so I made minor adjustments to make up for that. I added 1/8 tsp  ground cloves and 2 dashes allspice to flour mixture. I later realized I added 2 tablespoons  flour instead of 2 teaspoons like recipie said. (woowps, but still we Loved it). And like another reviewer said i tossed the apples in the flour mixture then added to crust. Everything else the same. Will for sure make again.

Phenomenal and so easy. This was the first pie gone at Thanksgiving. My husband doesn't care for apple and he ate a slice, my MIL asked for the recipe, and I denied my friend taking some home because I wanted to eat it. This one is going in the recipe box!

Wow.  This was truly the best apple pie ever!  The bottom crust was crispy because of the butter/sugar step. Thank you so much for this recipe!  Perfect in a cast iron skillet.

I made this as written. Very easy to put together. It turned out too sweet for me. Next time, I'll cut the white sugar in half and add more apple. Will definitely make again with changes. Thanks for the recipe!

Will definitely make again, but will start the brown sugar/butter on the stovetop to make sure the brown sugar melts completely. Wasn't a fan of the gritty texture from the unmelted sugar.

I made this for my friends & family & followed the recipe as written. We all felt there was WAY too much sugar & butter on the bottom. They bottom became carmelized & the crusts almost all but disappeared. I would probably try again but I would cut butter & sugar in half & use thicker crusts.

Tasted incredible. With the hot skillet I was not able to keep the dough from falling to the bottom so the top and bottom were not pinched together.

Recently went to an apple orchard, with plans of making baked apples. I came across this wonderful recipe and decided to make it instead. WOW!!!! So few ingredients.. so little prep.. so easy to make. This is one good pie! I used half the sugar (white and brown), and added a tiny bit of real carmel flavor. Thank you for sharing! I'll definitely make this again.

I am a novice baker and this is the easiest and most delicious pie/cobbler I have ever eaten. 
I cut both sugars down and added other spices.  I made my own crust as well.  I think the butter and brown sugar bottom makes this dish the best ever

This is so sticky and gooey- my husband, a pie traditionalist, said it's not really a pie, but more like a caramel apple gooey mess.  It's delicious, would totally make again.  Much easier than expected, particularly with store bought pie crust.  Would make again!   (I'll note- my husband still had two slices!)

I have made this pie several times and will make it again. Says a lot since I am not a pie maker. Easy enough I can make it and my guests always love it.

Loved it. Used Buttercrust Pastry Dough recipe. However, substituted butter for shortening.

Wow! Only making Apple pie in cast iron from now on. Really really Good and so easy and fool proof to make like this. 
Only change I may make next time, is less sugar; both the brown sugar in the beginning and the sugar mix to sprinkle on the apples as  well. It was a little too much.

Absolutely wonderful.  The caramel oozed up over the top crust and made for a spectacular presentation.  I sprinkled sugar & cinnamon on the top crust.
