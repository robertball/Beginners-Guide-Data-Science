This is so good and it is also quick to make. I used the calculate button to change it to 8 servings and it made a 1/2 cup as the full recipe is 2 cups. I used Kraft mayo with olive oil and it worked great. Such a nice change over plain ketchup. We dipped fries and onion rings in it. Only problem with this dip is that now I might eat too many fries!

I thought this was a flavorful dip/dressing/sandwich condiment.   It does remind me very much of thousand island dressing, without the islands (pickle relish).  Why buy it when I can make it?  Thanks.

Another former Utahn here. While I thought this was pretty good, I will tweak a few things next time. I think it's too sweet. I would only use half the sugar. I like the mild heat from the mustard powder, but rather than adding more I would add just a touch of prepared horseradish. Even without the tweaks, this is the best fry sauce I've found in my quest to copy the old Arctic Circle sauce.

LOVED IT! The only change I made was to halve the recipe. I knew I had a winner when hubby said 'someone should bottle this', lol! I served this with fries and tots, and actually used some on my burger too, which I definately recommend~ YUM!!! I will definately be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My kids make fry sauce using mayo and ketchup all the time, and my husband (who is from ID) always says that's it's missing something.  This recipe hit the spot for all of them.  The only downside...now they all want it this way and not the old simple way:)

YUM! I lived in the Spokane area and had this, but now that I'm back in TN no one has any idea what I am talking about! I had been settling for just mixing ketchup and mayo BUT now that I've found this recipe I can FINALLY have some real fry sauce again:) Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

THANK YOU! for posting this recipe... I lived in Utah for 2 years and frequently miss having fry sauce with my fries/onion rings/wedges. "Boo!" to those that say fry sauce is just mixing together ketchup and mayo... it is NOT the same! :o)

Giving it a 4 since it is much better than ketchup and mayo but I needed more spice myself.  Made as directed but cut the sugar in half (enough in the ketchup).  After using it a bit I then added more onion powder, paprika, salt and dry mustard but really looking for more of a kick.  I did enjoy it though but next time, I think I'll try doubling the seasonings or add some hot sauce.  ******Made a second time, doubled all the seasonings, but kept the mayo and ketchup the same.  This is what I was looking for, very nice.

This is a quick dipping sauce to make and tastes good.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Next time though, I will omit the sugar as the first batch was way too sweet.  Ketchup has a lot of sugar already in it, so I don't see any reason to add more.  Other than that, thank you for this recipe.

Haven't tried this yet but sounds very much like what we've been making for years to emulate fry sauces made at several restaurants here in Washington State.

My husband and my father-in-law are native Idahoans and were always on the hunt for the perfect fry sauce.  I took a chance today and made this one for our oven fries - and I'm so glad I did!  Great sauce.  Sweet, tangy, and without the overly-mustard-y flavor that some fry sauces have when trying to depart from the Thousand Island-type fry sauce.  This sauce is a winner and we'll be making it a lot from here on out.  Thanks for sharing, Heather!

I LOVED this. Served this last night with fries, but I was even dipping my garlic bread into it.  Hubby wasn't as thrilled with it but he thinks ketchup is great - even puts it on his steaks.  This sauce is like a seasoned thousand island dressing.  I halved the recipe, and still have plenty left so I'll be trying it on grilled hamburgers tonight. Thanks for sharing!

What a delicious recipe!  My husband and I had never heard of fry sauce until Allrecipes.  We discovered we both like it.  I halved the recipe to use on 'Tail Burner Firehouse French Fries' from AR.  This might have been my first time trying the recipe, but it won't be the last.  Thanks Heather, for sharing your recipe.

I love this sauce! I do cut back or leave out altogether the sugar as I like a more vinegar tartness to my sauce but I have yet to have home baked "fries" without having this sauce too. I think it's just great. Thanks for sharing.

Yummmm. Really good. Creamy and rich with flavor. The submitter is right, after this I tried fries with ketchup and I much preferred this sauce to the plain now boring ketchup. From Idaho and now to Texas, I liked this too!

My family really enjoyed this dipping sauce.  We like a little spice so we added a few drops of hot sauce.  We will use this again.

This was excellent! I know its intended for fries but I used it as a dip for some grilled artichokes.  Served with Marinated Tuna Steak with white rice, Grilled Artichokes, and Cherry Cobbler I.

I didn’t care for the flavors in this sauce but my daughter thought it was ok, however she preferred the ketchup.  It just didn't work for us.

Wow!  I made this last night to go with burgers.  I have to say, I was very skeptical.  I am a die-hard ketchup user!  It was all I put on my burger and was it amazing!  Even Mr. Picky thought it was good!  We proceeded to discuss all the varied ways to use this sauce, as a dip, a condiment on sandwiches, even as a dressing!  Can't wait to try it out on the extended family!  I may have some on my cereal this morning!  Seriously, try it, you WILL like it!  Mmm-mmm good!

THIS. IS. FRY SAUCE. Ignore the review that says fry sauce is a simple job. Anyone who believes this is so so  wrong! Arctic circle, who invented this work of art sauce, has a secret recipe with spice blends! If you know fry sauce like Utahns and Idahoans do you knkow THIS. IS. THE. SAUCE. god bless you!!!!

I've  been looking for a good recipe for fry sauce and I've finally found it! My kids protested because we ate hotdogs tonight and didn't have fry sauce.  I made as the recipe directed and it is so close you can't tell the difference.  I did have to use balsamic vinegar because  I didn't have red wine vinegar, but it didn't change the taste. In fact,  I liked the sweet tang of the balsamic. I will definitely make again...I think I will also use a little more onion powder and throw a pinch of garlic in just to test it. But this recipe is a keeper,  'as is'!!

Way too sweet. I ended up adding more WHITE vinegar and a little bbq sauce to balance it out, which helped. Next time I would omit the sugar or add it in slowly, to taste.

I'm from Utah and have grown up on the good ole' mayo and ketchup fry sauce. Saw this and tried it... AMAZING!! It brought fry sauce to a whole new level!! My husband, who is also from Utah, was doubting this recipe as he watched me make it. But he took one taste and said "that's  good!" We will definitly be using this recipe everytime we need fry sauce! Thank you!

I have been using this (your) recipe for years now.

This recipe is awesome! As with any recipe you can modify it to your tastes. I make this in huge batches for my hubby and son who love this more than anything else on their taters. 


Thank you for sharing,

Great fry sauce. The vinegar adds the acid and kick that most recipes lack.

Made it as written, and was a little too sweet for me. I think it will be perfect with half the amount of sugar listed.

I was going for a copycat recipe, and found this thinking it would be similar. Really good, but needed a little kick. Added some Texas Pete, turned out great.

My first impression was that the sauce was too sweet, and I could taste the vinegar; I don't want to be able to pick out any one ingredient.  I have to admit that I didn't make the recipe as written because I only had approximately a half cup of homemade mayo, so I halved the remaining ingredients.  Next time I'll try cutting the sugar in half, and maybe use a little less vinegar while rounding the other ingredient measurements.  Will definitely make again.  My husband liked my first attempt enough that he had a second helping.

This was not what I was looking for.  I wanted a tasty dipping sauce for fries, something to add a zing of flavor, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Meh, not what I wanted at all.  I've never been to Utah or Idaho to be able to verify if this is their authentic fry sauce, but I know it wasn't impressive to me.  Ketchup would have been just as good.

I grew up in western Washington state, so was looking for a fry sauce like I used to have as a kid. I think this is on the right track, but was so sweet I didn't even want to eat it.

Very good Fry Sauce, so much better than Ketchup and Mayo. I did reduce the amount of sugar by 1/2, I'm not sure that you really need any sugar.  I've tasted a lot of different fry sauces and I think that this one is the best, hands down!!!!

We made this as to serve with deep fried lake trout, caught at Priest Lake, Idaho.  We also made a popular tartar sauce recipe from this site.  Our guests thought it needed something, a little more bite, so we added a tablespoon of horseradish.  Everybody loved it.  For any kind of potatoes, though, I will use the recipe as written.

By far my favourite fry sauce recipe out there. Sure, you can just mix ketchup and mayo and it's fine. But when you add all of these other wonderful flavours it's just magical! I added a touch of garlic powder too!

Good stuff! I halved this recipe. I also decreased the sugar called for by half and only had regular yellow mustard so used that. Still turned out great.

Great recipe. I didn't make any additions or subtractions to the ingredient list and its perfect. Definitely make the sauce the night before you plan on eating it, the flavors tend to blend if it sits 24 hours.

Good recipe! I halved the recipe because I wanted to start out with a smaller amount, in case I didn't like the outcome. I think it came out exactly as intended; halving it does not generate any funky measurements.

While I do believe that the use of vinegar in this recipe is authentic, I will omit it next time. I believe the vinegar in the ketchup & Worcestershire sauce is enough to give it a small bite. Omitting it will save my throat & stomach, the pair of which can no longer tolerate even moderately acidic foods (sadly).

I am 81 yrs of age and have been mixing most of those indgrediants  together for many years. Try a little orange juice with mayo too. my new Philapino relatives turned me on to mixing half soy and half flavored vinegar for a dipping sauce. Very tasty, especially with spring rolls or egg rolls.

I'd been making close a variation of this for years before I saw it made on an episode "Triple D" and never new it had a name. I use steak sauce because I don't like the idea of there being anchovies in every brand of Worcestershire sauce I've come across. When I want some good homemade thousand island dressing I just add diced pickles of choice. It beats plain ketchup every time. It's not just for fries either, it's great on a burger or with diced pickles it goes good on a Ruben also.

This recipe has been in Washington for over 35 years at this one burger place in Puyallup, Washington.. This place was called burger box it was a place where it had no sit down tables unless it was outside you ordered your food and either left or ate in your vehicle. The sauce was the best for there fries... They would scoop a huge amount of fries in a brown paper bag that was there fries... Filled to the top and the secret sauce is what they called it... But if ya worked there you knew what was in it

This is just about as close as you can get to the best fry sauce ever (Arctic Circle's), but I strongly recommend halving the sugar. It's a bit too sweet with the amount the recipe calls for.

We love this sauce.  We use it for steak finger, burgers, fries.....it's good on every thing.  The only substitution i made was using balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  This is definitely our new go to sauce!

A friend of mine just came back from a trip to a place where fry sauce was an actual thing in restaurants/stores. Being in Virginia, I've never even heard of it until now.  I was curious so thought I'd try making it... You totally lost me at the 1/4 cup sugar part though. I'm going to try it without the sugar and some of the other things.

Very easy to make and much better than just ketchup. It has zing. I added pickle relish to bring in some texture and flavor notes.
