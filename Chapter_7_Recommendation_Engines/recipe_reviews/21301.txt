The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly.  I can't give it 5 stars as written.  The flavor is very good but it was not filling or hearty.  The second time I made it I used triple the amount of oysters (fresh), doubled the onion and celery and used 8 oz. of sliced baby bella mushrooms.  Much improved!!!  We like our soups to be a main dish and these additions brought it up to that level without adding a whole lot of calories.  I might try adding a cup of cubed potato next time to give it even more body.  The flavor was there with the basic recipe and as is, would be a nice first course at a special dinner.

Just made this soup.  Made the following substitutions in the recipe:  Can chopped asparagus instead of artichoke hearts, half and half instead of heavy cream, margarine instead of butter and I added four diced potatoes (cooked).    Good Grief this was good stuff.  Recommend making a double batch on your first try.  A keeper for sure

this is AMAZING!!! i don't seem to be able to stop eating this...! the only thing is that the artichoke doesn't quite fit in here... i love artichoke, but it taste weird in this soup. i'll leave it out next time.  i added a couple red potatoes (saut√©ed with the rest of the veggies) and corn kernel (frozen. added when i added the veggies to the liquid). i think both fit really well with this soup. used veggie broth instead of chicken, fresh sage instead of dry, fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. worked out fine. i also used more oysters than called for since i love oysters. my tip is don't put all the oysters in the soup if you know you're not gonna finish the whole pot. add as many as you think you'll eat in one setting, save the rest and add them (again, only as many as you can eat at once) when you reheat the soup, so that you won't end up having gross chewy oysters that's been reheated 3 times.

This soup was very easy to make and relied on easy-to-find ingredients.  (I used 2-8 oz. cans of oysters w/ juices in lieu of fresh.)  The result is excellent!

Every time I make this stew it's gone in 
no time at all. There are never any leftovers.
This is my mother-in-law's recipe. I'm realy
glad she shared it with everyone in the 
family. I hope everyone will enjoy it.

This is a wonderful recipe and I'll probably make it again for Christmas. To lighten it a bit, I halved the butter used and also used half evaporated milk and half cream. I added a little white wine and paprika as well. Yummy!

This was excellent.  I wanted to make half the recipe and did not want to open a second can of chicken broth for just 2 ounces so I used 1 can broth and 3/4 cup cream.  For half the recipe I used an 8 ounce jar oysters and would have liked more. Next time I will use 12 ounces.

To me it was a lot better when I made it the second time with modifications. I didn't add the mushrooms, artichokes, thyme, oregano and sage but added black pepper and a bit of Old Bay. I added leftover mashed potatoes for thickening and left out the flour. I also used half and half in place of the cream and canned oysters.

This is a very easy, very tasty soup.  When I made it I cut way back on the amount of butter and I used half and half instead of cream, I also doubled up on the carrots, celery and onion.  Replaced the fresh mushrooms with canned and canned oysters instead of shucked. If I make it again I'll use 2 cans of oysters rather than 3 I use.

My family and I are positively giddy after having this for our Christmas Eve supper!  Other than substituting diced potatoes for mushrooms, I followed the recipe precisely.  It was perfect!  Thank you for posting.  UPDATE:  5th Christmas Eve in a row....and I used the mushrooms instead of potatoes...better than remembered.

We used the oyster liquor in lieu of the chicken broth, and shallots in lieu of the onions.  The carrots we omitted.
More spices were added, otherwise it was good.

Absolutely delicious! It is very flavorful and filling. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and used asparagus instead of artichokes. Thank you so much for sharing, DSPROUT! This will definitely be made over again in our home!

This was absolutely wonderful! The flavors blended so well together and the cayenne pepper gives it a nice little kick. The added bonus is that it made the house smell great and it drove my husband nuts! :)

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!!  I love regular Oyster Stew using milk/cream, butter and oysters, but decided to give this w try, YAY!  I used my mini food processor to chop all the veggies uniformly& that cut the prep time drastically!  I used a combo of veggie & chicken broth and a bottle of clam juice I had in the cabinet to add a lil more flavor and used the oyster juices as well.  I doubled the recipe & omitted the cayenne bc my toddler but otherwise followed everything exactly, Oh I did only use 2-6oz cans of artichokes (and should have chopped them better).  I highly suggest trying this, it is wonderful, the sage is very complimentary to the oyster flavor, this is a keeper!!

We have made this for the last few years at Christmas. It is delicious. It would also be good with no oysters for vegetarians.

This recipe puts to shame any and all storebought or restaurant made Oyster Stews or Soups that I've ever tried.  I will never be able to order an Oyster Stew or Soup anywhere, ever again!  My husband wants me to make this at least once a month from now on.

This was amazing! I had to change the fat content though. I just couldn't bring myself to put that much fat in my body and still enjoy... so I used olive oil to soften the veggies in the beginning instead of butter. I used half the butter with the flour mixture.  I used part half & half and the other part I used 2% milk  to total one cup.  I left out the artichokes to save some money. It make sense to double it since it's better the next day anyway.

Definitely do what the other reviewer said--make a double batch!!  I never eat leftover seafood (ugh! Usually turns too fishy for me.), but this delicious soup tasted even better the next day. Definite keeper. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was pretty good. I did not have the artichoke hearts, but based on some reviews, they were better left out. I doubled the celery, mushrooms, and onion. At the end, I tasted the soup and it tasted fairly generic, like canned soup, so I added about a cup of white wine, a few extra shakes of cayenne and hot sauce, and some paprika. The extra spice and wine gave the soup a more polished taste. Thanks for the recipe.

very good soup i am only giving it a 4 star do to i thought it really needed alot more veggies, i added a red potato diced i cooked it in the micro wave first to soften it up before add it to the carrots,onions, and celery, i didnt use mushrooms as as i didnt think they belongs or the artichoke i used old bay seasoning along with thyme, salt and pepper and Cayenne. and i used half and half instead of heavy cream  to cut back on the fat. next time i will use a little less butter  maybe even use light smart balance in replace of the butter. but it was very good over all will be making it again. even my daughter that is groused out by oysters ate it..

This soup was awesome. I didn't make any changes. The flavors worked so well together. Next time I might try it with clams because the base is so good it could make it's own soup.

This is identical to the recipe I have for Cream of Artichoke soup.  If you omit the oysters and oyster juice, it becomes a phenominal artichoke soup.  The recipe receives compliments like crazy every time I make it.  Yummy!

I wish I could give this soup more stars.  Excellent!  I did omit mushrooms - simply don't care for them.  I combined 1/2 Cup flour w/1 Cup milk in a gravy shaker. Increased chicken broth to 6 Cups,  brought chicken broth and 1/2 Cup butter to boil, and stirred in gravey thickener.  Add veggies and spices, simmer for 30 minutes then added oysters.

This was the best oyster stew I've ever had!  It is definitely not bland; nor are the spices overpowering as I thought they might be.  I suspect that if I were to have followed the recipe exactly the soup would have been just as good, if not better.  However, I did have to make the following substitutions:
- 2 cans (8oz) whole oysters (use 1/2   
  liquid from the cans) instead of fresh
- One 15 oz can asparagus (drained)  
  instead of artichoke hearts
- 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup skim 
  milk instead of 1 cup heavy cream

Followed recipe as far as ingredients, however did add oysters. Husband was disappointed I wasn't frying oysters tonight, but once he tasted this soup. He said 'don't lose that recipe'. I did use some of the liquid from the oysters, but recipe doesn't really say. Thanks for a great dish!

We made this for Valentine's day dinner and it was delicious.  To lighten it up, we used fat free evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream.  It has a wonderful flavor.  We will be making again.

I made this for my mother for her birthday because she and my father love oysters so much.  I don't really care for oysters but decided to try this.  The soup was very tasty and creamy.  Its a lovely soup as well.  It has a small kick to it too, which we all liked.

Wonderful recipe - best oyster soup I've ever had!  I had to use canned oysters & juice, and it was still delicious.  I'm sure it's even better with fresh.  I substituted half & half for the heavy cream, and will probably try to reduce the butter next time, just to lighten it up. I'll definitely make this again!

Just made this soup tonight. It's delicious. I used 2 cans of oysters as some reviews suggested. I loved the artichoke hearts in this soup! Next ime I will probably halve the butter. Great soup!

My boyfriend has been making this soup for a few years now.  We both love it!  After the first batch, we decided that there was too much butter.  He now makes it with half the butter called for.  He also likes to sneak in extra oysters when he can.  Try this recipe for an excellent Christmas Eve tradition!

My other half LOVED this stew! I would kick down the cayenne pepper a little though, his mom usually uses milk and flour and oysters, i told him mine had more nutrition values and was way better and he actually agreed! Knowing his eating habits he had 3 bowls in one night so i had to double batch. I'm totally making this again!

I have made this many times now, and I LOVE this recipe.  However, I have made a number of changes.  I just couldn't handle the fat content.  I double all the vegetables and oysters.  I sub margarine for butter, and I too use only about half of the quantity called for.  Then I either use half cream and half 1% milk, or I use a mixture of half n half with milk.  Also, I cut the cayenne pepper in half as we have thre kids -- this gives it a small kick, but not too strong for the kids.   I'm sure it would be AMAZING as written, but I cannot afford the fat.

I love this soup! Smooth taste, creamy and so quickly done! No need to buy a precooked soup at the store. Only thing you might have to go and buy quick is a glass of oysters (if you do not find fresh ones!). I used oysters in a glass, made my chickenstock with the Knorr Chicken Flavor Bouillon (Caldo de Pollo) granulated and a glass marinated artichoke hearts. So good. Buy a french long bread and surprise your big love or family with this easy soup!

A CROWD PLEASER!!! Oyster Soup has always been a Chrismas Eve tradition in our family. The family member who prepared it is no longer with us, so this year I was placed "in charge" of the oyster soup. I had no recipe and no idea what I was doing. EVERYONE (from our 4 year old and up) loved it! It has cream but is not too rich which was an important component for us. The flavors are delicious. However, I did scale back on the cayenne.

This is very good. Bursting with flavor (it has a great spiciness), but not too overwhelming. I followed the recipe exactly but used one 8 ounce can of whole oysters. I bought the cheapest can of oysters at the store, but will not do that again - the oysters were kind of icky. Next time will buy a more expensive can of oysters in hopes that they'll be better quality.

10,25,19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21301/elegant-oyster-soup/ ... Very rarely, veryyyyyy, do I have oysters.  I had an 8oz "can" of fresh oysters.  'Didn't know how many were in there.  I underestimated - yes, I could've counted first, but I didn't - so I halved the recipe thinking I had  closer to a half plus than the full recipe.  'Turns out I had a few more than a full recipe.  I liked this soup.  It's a wee bit spicy.  'Would've liked it thicker, but I used half & half instead of heavy cream so I'll take a bit of blame on that one.  Sum up:  double or triple the vegetables & not finely chopped.  Add cubed potatoes.  Double the oysters.  A little sherry or white wine would make even better, I think.  :)

what a great oyster soup!  as that my husband and I like "more", i doubled the veggie amounts and used cornstarch vs flour for less carbs.  I also added a couple of jalapenos (diced) for a little kick.  much better than the traditional oyster stew.

Loved this recipe. I would probably cut back on the 1/2 cup of butter next time. I may try potatoes as a thickening agent and try asparagus instead of the artichokes as others have suggested.  Overall though I really enjoyed it.

Made this soup using some leftover oysters I had in the freezer from my last batch of fresh ones. I made some changes based on other reviewers. Used half n half instead of heavy cream. Used whole wheat flour instead of white since that was what I had. Used less butter, specifically to make the roux. Instead I used a little butter and some coconut oil. Also added 3 red potatoes, which I nuked for several minutes then added when the recipe calls for a 30 minute simmer. Didn't have cayanne pepper so I added some cajun seasoning. I actually overcooked the roux a little so I was worried the soup would come out bad. It actually was pretty tasty! Thought the artichoke hearts would be weird so I added only a few that were marinated in olive oil...they didn't change the flavor or impact the soup at all. My only issue is with the mushrooms and other veggies, I thought it took away from the oysters. I actually didn't really taste any hint of oysters so next time I think I will add more of them with their liquor. May also use less butter and half and half to reduce the fat! Overall, a very good recipe though.

Make as directed and it is best.  This is also a great base if you want to make with clams, thicken for potato soup, shredded chicken with corn.  Will continue to make

Great recipe! My in-laws love oyster soup and it has been a family tradition started by the matriarch of the Family, Grandma, who passed away a few years ago. I made it for Thanksgiving this year and after dinner family members told me it reminded them of Grandma. They also mentioned it was better than her recipe

This was a wonderful recipe! I made a couple changes. I added 2 medium red potatoes and I substituted the cup of heavy cream with 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup whole milk. I also used 2 cans of oysters instead of fresh shucked oysters. This is a great receipe - sub what you want, it's very easy to work with. Thanks!

This is our new Valentines day tradition! Substituted red pepper flakes for the cayenne, and made it a little spicier. So good. Makes me sad that Valentines doesn't come more than once a year!

I've used this recipe a number of times, changing it up to fit what I have in the fridge.  Although its great as written, we really liked substituting additional mushrooms in place of artichokes and oysters.  Everyone I make this for loves it.

Wow - fantastic! Only changes was doubling the celery, onions and carrots, and using half and half instead of cream. Oh and adding a cup of white wine as suggested by another review.  That wine added a nice finish to the soup. I used frozen artichokes instead of canned and jarred oysters.  Thanks for a great recipe -- will make this again!

I can't complain about this recipe.  First time making it 2nd time trying it and I fell in love!  I doubled the recipe and by accident I added 1 teaspoon of oregano instead of half and it still tasted amazing!  I am making it a second time and I am adding potatoes in for something different.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This one is husband approved!  He grew up with milk and oyster stew, I don't like it.  This has veggies and tastes great, we both enjoy this soup.  We will be making this again.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.

Absolutely fantastic without the artichokes and cayenne.  Artichokes just don't fit and cayenne is a little off with oysters. I love oysters so much i used a whole lot more, all without the juice as I don't like the look of it.  Couldn't get enough. A recipe keeper for sure to go in my Moms recipe book that has been passed down to me.

This is amazing! It is actually very easy and fast too. I just left out the artichokes and added some garlic, garlic powder, and onion powder. Next time, I would like to add beer or white wine to add even more depth and flavor.

This is the most incredible soup. You can also turn this into a seafood chowder by adding scallops, shrimp, crab, fresh fish and have also added fresh corn. It has been passed thru the family as a favorite.

I also add 2 cups potatoes, finely chopped.  This is one of the best tasting oyster recipes I have ever tried.

It is well worth the work.

Although I prefer my regular and simple oyster stew this was very tasty for a change.
