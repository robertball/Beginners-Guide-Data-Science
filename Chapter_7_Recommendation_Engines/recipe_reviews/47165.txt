I view this recipie as sort of 'chili lite' and as such can't help but add most of the contents of the spice cabinet to it. Yummy! First off along with the onion I added a good helping of minced garlic and seasoned the meat a bit at that time. I reduced the amount of chili powder called for in the recipie greatly and made up for it with cumin - my favorite spice for chili and other mexican dishes. I also added sage thyme oregano basil and rosemary to round out the flavors - I know I'm a spiceaholic but when I make my "everything in the spice cabinet chili" I always get rave reviews. I also added a can of red beans because I felt as a couple of other reviewers also did that something else was needed. Served with brown rice and with a bit of cheddar cheese sprinkled on top this is wonderful!

this is a good starter recipe. only used 1 tbs chili powder as my kids don't do 'spicy'. i added 1 chopped celery stalk and garlic salt while cooking the beef. then i added a can of corn at the end.

Very easy dish to make. A bit flat on flavor and definitely needs a pinch of oregano or something but the recipe itself is a good starting point for personalization. I added kidney beans and regret not adding garlic. It needs something extra.

My family thought this was pretty good - a filling tasty meal. I added kidney beans because I thought it just needed something and was happy with that choice. It was also pretty fast and easy. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good base but of course I tweaked it. I didn't puree the tomatoes and used a variety that also had green chiles. I added about half a cup of tomato sauce a couple cloves of minced garlic some frozen roasted corn kernels a diced bell pepper a dash of liquid smoke some cumin and oregano half a teaspoon of white sugar a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes. The resulting flavor was vaguely "southwest barbecue" with more depth and meatiness.

This is a fantastic base recipe and I admit I tweaked a bit but the results were tasty. Instead of ground beef I used Johnsonville Italian sausage. And since this recipe is perfect for whatever additions you desire I added some black beans and corn and served it over mashed potatoes.
