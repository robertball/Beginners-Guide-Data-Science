Not bad for a quick meal - I did omit the apples and potaotes from the skewer.  For the glaze I just mixed a bit of BBQ sauce with the preserves.  I served this with grilled baked potatoes on the side.

Simple and Tasty. Don't forget to soak wooden skewers in water or they will turn black and break.

Excellent quick meal on the grill.  I used kielbasa and added pineapple chunks to the skewers as well as other ingredients.  Served over noodles and butter.  No leftovers!

Good, but the apples seemed out of place. Maybe i was not using the right kind but I think pineapple would have had a better texture. Some sort of glaze would have been nice too.

Tried these while camping last weekend.  Used everything but the potatoes.  We loved them and can't wait to have them again.  Going to use the potatoes and add pineapples next time.

We LOVED these! I did omit the apples and potatoes as a personal preference and accidentally omitted the tomatoes, lol. I used the Hillshire Farm Turkey Kielbasa because that's the only one I buy. This was a great idea and we will difinately be having these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Super easy and tastes great. I used light smoked sausage to make it a little healthier, and it was really good.

Yum! I like the suggestion to serve over hot sauerkraut! The sweetness of the peppers/onions/apples totally balance out the smokiness of the sausage and the sauerkraut. Gonna make this for the holidays!
