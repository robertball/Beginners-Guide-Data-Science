Ty Mrs. Carrigan, this bread is so yummy! I think it would make a great wheat bread even for those that don't typically eat wheat bread. I have made quite a few, in my bread machine, and this is my favorite so far. All the flavors balance well. It does have a tad sweetness, but it could be used as toast, meal bread, or even most sandwiches. I love how soft it is. I followed the recipe exactly, just using Gold Medal white whole wheat flour milled from a lighter color grain than traditional whole wheat. I also used the regular wheat setting on my machine as opposed to basic setting. On my machine the white and wheat settings are separate. I also don't have to set the lb size, or even the crust color, which is automatic. I couldn't understand why there were two measurements for water, but I just added them together when adding the water. This will be going in my bread machine recipe box. ty

I have made this recipe countless times, and because I pack a LOT of school lunches, I've tweaked it so it is even easier for our busy family to have fresh, preservative free, fiber full bread!  The kids love it even more than the potato fiber bread I sometimes buy.

I pre-measure and mix 1 1/2 batches of dry ingredients (except yeast) and store in labeled 1/2 gal. mason jar.  Make 3-4 of these batches at a time and making fresh sandwich bread becomes even easier!

I also found I can use olive oil (equal substitute) instead of butter (faster and healthier fat), and I use 1 T. of vital wheat gluten in place of 1 T. of wheat flour for each cup of wheat flour, which gives a great rise!  And for my larger batch (1 1/2  of this posted recipe), I don't increase the honey and it is still enough sweet.

Tip: Use a small marked measuring glass (like a tall shot glass), to measure & pour in the olive oil, THEN measure out the honey and it will release SO easily!

1. Pour warm water, olive oil, honey, white wheat flour (my substitution again), bread flour, salt, and yeast, respectively, into the pan of a bread machine.  Run JUST the Dough cycle (1 1/2 hours).
2. Lightly spray LONG (Wilton) sandwich loaf bread pan with non-stick spray.  Shape bread dough to fit pan, lightly cover with a towel and let raise in a warm place, 1 - 1 1/2 hr.
3. Bake at 350Â°F for 26-28 min.  Turn bread out onto cooling grid to cool completely before slicing (I use a Hamilton Beach electric meat carving knife..

Delicious! I used freshly ground coarse whole wheat flour, and used the bread machine for mixing the dough, put it in a loaf pan, let it rise  till I was happy with its size and baked it at 325 for 25 mins (my oven runs a little hot fyi)

perfect amount of density, sweetness and fluff l. I think I will add cinnamon and raisins next time!

My favorite wheat bread. And better than any I could buy in the grocery store. Not too sweet and I like the texture. I made it just as the recipe states. My bread machine has a wheat bread setting so I used that. I was suspicious with the small amount of yeast for a 2lb loaf but it turned out great. Making another loaf now for my college son to take back with him.

Just took the loaf out the oven.  Looks and smells really good.  Going to let it cool down on a wire rack and then have it for dinner.  I made it  with a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.  Proofed the yeast and baked it at 375 for 30 min.  I did have to add about 2tbs of bread flour and 1 tbs of water.  But, adjusting those two ingredients is necessary with different atmospheric seasonal temperatures.  Everything else was followed exactly.  The initial rise was for 1hr and the second rise was for 30min while the oven preheated.

FINALLY! I found a bread machine recipe that WORKS! This one is fantastic, and it makes nice bread for sandwiches. At first, it's a little soft inside, but if you let it cool and dry out a little, it stands up well to spreading peanut butter. I split the butter into two pieces and dropped it into the machine. Followed all instructions exactly as written. Came out PERFECT! I might try adding ground flax next time, but it's pretty good as is. I might also try this same recipe with white flour only, for the "wonderbread" lovers in my family. Thanks, Tracie!

Great, simple recipe. I used Best for Bread Whole Wheat flour and also 1 cup of stoneground flour; added 1 T of ground flax and 1 T wheatgerm as well. So good, and lasts well without getting too dry. I used the "light" setting on my machine for the best results.

Excellent tasting bread! 
Easy to make...I  increased the amount of butter to a fourth of a cup. I also made this recipe by hand instead of using a bread machine. I baked it for 30 minutes in a 375 degree oven. 
It came out perfect. Make sure you have good yeast growth and knead till dough is very pliable.

I made this for my children's school lunches. It was delicious and sliced well. I started mine on the dough cycle then moved it into a bread pan for the second rise (40 min) and baked in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. I hate the shape in comes out in the bread machine.

I make this for my grandson in my bread maker.   I use organic whole wheat pastry flour in place of the bread flour and it comes out beautifully every time!  Thank you!

Made this bread to serve with a deli/salad dinner. We were 8 people and the whole loaf disappeared! I have another batch in my bread machine now, but this time on the dough setting, as I'm going to make it into 2 sandwich loaves. The only change I made was to use olive oil instead of butter, so as to keep it dairy free. The texture was perfect. I used the whole wheat setting on my machine, with a medium crust (to make it a little crunchier on top). It made a perfect 2lb loaf. Am saving to my favourite bread machine recipes.

This bread is okay, but needs some changes (SOME might be because of my environment).  First of all, and most importantly, it was WAY TOO SWEET.  All I could taste was honey (and I LOVE honey), I have no idea how others are not finding this sweet enough.  Both my husband and I agreed that, as written, it was basically a dessert bread.  I cut the honey down to 3 tbsp, which I find to be about perfect.

Also, it was rising and then falling significantly every time.  I'm not a chemist, so I've just been playing with things to try to fix this issue.  What's worked best so far is to cut the water down to just over a cup (I wasn't precise), and to cut the yeast down to 1 1/4 tsp.  It has been insanely humid here though, so it is possible that is impacting it.

My family loved this bread.  This was the first bread I made using my bread machine.  It will probably be the only wheat bread recipe I use.
