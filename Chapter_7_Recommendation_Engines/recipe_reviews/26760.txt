I'm rating this recipe on the little princess in our life, my 6 year old grandaugher who says this is a 15.  We used this recipe one day when I was babysitting and she asked if we could have a real tea party.  We did sub texas toast bread since the princess and her friend of 7 and my 2 year old prince of a grandson are not partial to rye bread etc. at this age. We lightly toasted the bread and cut off the crust, then cut the bread into triangles.  We proceeded to mix the rest of the ingredients as to recipe and made finger sandwiches. Since I told the princess that you have to have tea at a tea party we used the instant russian tea recipe on this site, which we made and put into a kool aid pitcher then chilled with ice and served with our sandwiches.  They ate all the sandwiches and even liked the tea.  I must say this is one of the most rewarding times that I have spent with my grandchildren and we will now have a tea party every month and have decided that we will go around the world every month and find a sandwich and tea to serve.  So needless to say I will be a busy Nana on allrecipes looking for worldwide tea parties.  This is a great and rewarding way to spend time with your children or grandchildren.  Enjoy!

Simple and delicious, what could be better! I put the cheese mixture in a pastry bag with a large star tip, put just a dab on the bread to "glue" on the cucumber and then piped the mixture on top. Garnish w/ chopped fresh dill or chives.YUM

Two hours before my friends baby shower, the hostess calls and asks if I can bring something, as someone else had to back out.  These were fast, and everyone loved them!  I couldn't find the cocktail rounds (and I was in a hurry!), so I used dill rye, quartered.  The dill accent was just wonderful!  I doubled the recipe, but could have trippled it, these went over so well.  Looking forward to serving these at my next get together!

Doubled the recipe.  Used one fat free and one regular cream cheese.  Put in a piping bag and in the fridge for 1&1/2 hour - enough to let flavors mix. (still soft enough to pipe) Used mandoline w/english cucumbers - 2 slices per serving. Dill on top.  A HIT and the kids use leftovers for after an school snack!

I've made these many times for all occasions and we never get tired of them. Very addicting! The only difference in this recipe and the one I use is adding a small pinch of dried dill weed (not seed)to the top of the cucumber slice. They are also very easy to make and very inexpensive.

This recipe was a big hit at a potluck event I attended.  I made the cream cheese mixture the night before to allow time for the flavors to blend.

This is a great recipe.  I have found that these are even better when made the day before.  Gives the flavors time to blend.

These sandwiches were very tasty and refreshing.  I used pumpernickel instead of rye for a better color presentation and refrigerated the cream cheese mixture overnight.  These were nice to have for vegetarians and I will make again for my next party.

Wow is this ever a keeper! I made this for a bridal shower and one day later for a graduation party.  Both times these little delightful sandwiches were the delight of the party.

Whenever we are invited to a summertime cookout I usually offer to bring this as an appetizer. It is always a big hit with everyone.  I whip the cream cheese and salad dressing the night before, if I don't have sour cream I substitute mayo and that works well.  I assemble the sandwiches no more than an hour before we leave for the party because they do not keep well if you make them too far in advance.  I like to sprinkle a little McCormick's Salad Supreme or a similar seasoning over the top just to give them a little splash of contrasting color.

A winner at a baby shower today. I added a small dab of the cream cheese mixture to the top of the cucumbers and added a few sprigs of fresh dill which gave an extra flavor and eye appeal. I added a sprinkle of paprika to the top some for a pop of color.

When shopping for the ingredients, the store did not have available the coctail rye.  I substitued a loaf of regular rye and made complete sandwiches cut diagnally instead of open-faced ones.  Tasted great!

I also added about 1/4 of a can diced water chestnuts (they add crunch), green onion, some grated carrots and some celery and spinach under the cucumber as wells as some chopped dill. I only used 1/2 the packet of ranch as suggested and used the other half in a "pinwheel" recipe on here for a baby shower.

I actually made this for my lunch.  I did as others and replaced sour cream with mayonnaise and only used 1/2 oz of dressing mix instead of a whole packet since I didn't want it to be too salty.  I like the suggestion of another reviewer to fill a pastry bag with a star tip and top a cucumber slice with the spread.

These are lovely little appies!  I needed a use for cukes after Mr. LTH mistakenly picked up a couple thinking they were zucchini, so I turned to the RE and someone (CC?) recced these.  I made them for an appy for dinner w/my in-laws and they were a hit.  I followed the recipe to a "T" (though I did half my cuke slices and kind of stagger stack them on my bread slices) & will make these again. Thanks for a great recipe for "zucchini"!

I followed the recipe as written. People did like these, however, I find its one of those appetizers people would eat 1 and that's it. Not something you can really eat a lot of. I think the italian dressing called for was a little overpowering so I will cut down on that if i make them again.

These are great!  I love this recipe because there is no mayo.  I'd much rather have sour cream.  Also, I don't think this is to salty.  Remember - the rye bread and the cucumbers are pretty bland.  You need something with some zip. Also don't slice your cucumbers to far in advance because they get watery. Thanks!

I made these for a family reunion and everyone loved them. My mother-in-law has all ready requested I make them for the next get together.
 I used a seedless rye bread and really liked it. I am going to double the recipe and use both rye and white bread this time for added eye appeal. I am also going to add onions because our family loves them.

I served this to some friends of mine. They really liked it. It is very simple and easy to do, but has a wonderful taste. Very light and wonderful for snacking before a meal.I can't wait to have it in the summer time when I am grilling.

Made these for a dinner party and they were a big hit.  They are very impressive looking and easy to make.  I used Pumpernickel as well as Rye to add some color and variety.  The plate was empty in 10 minutes!!

Yum yum! I didn't tweak the recipe because I wanted to get a feel for what it was supposed to taste like. Turns out, making it as directed works well. I'm going to eat another one and see if it tastes better on toasted rye. *really quick and easy to make.

These were just okay, nothing to write home about. It could be the bread I chose, but I don't think I will make them again regardless.

I really like the flavors in this recipe, and it was easy to make a triple batch to serve at a baby shower. However, the bread started getting soggy after the sandwiches sat for about an hour. The second time I tried the recipe, I used Ritz crackers instead of the rye bread, and it turned out tasting just as great with a bit more crunch!

This was a big hit at a bridal shower I just gave. Delicious AND easy. I used another poster's suggestion of topping each sandwich with a sprig of fresh dill. This would also be good as an evening apppetizer. Great recipe I will continue to use!

This was great! I was in a pinch while having an impromptu tea party for my 3 year old and her friend. I thought that this was a great recipe. I whipped everything together with a touch of extra sour cream and the little bite size sandwiches were a HUGE hit. The girls LOVED them! I will definitly keep this recipe on hand for "quick fixes".

Than you for bringing this recipe back to me.  Prior to misplacing the recipe I served this at bridal and baby showers.  My tennis team also enjoyed it could be served at room tempeture or above.  It is quick and easy to prepare.  Thanks again.

These were very good.  I tweaked the recipe just a bit.  Used ranch-style dressing instead of Italian and sprinkled with dill and paprika for color.  Next time I think I'll use Ritz crackers since I'm not a big fan of rye bread.

Very good!  These were easy to make.  I cut the rye bread into different shapes using metal cookie cutters.  More tedious to do, but the presentation was better.

My husband and I loved it! I used white bread because I have three young children and they are picky with breads and this is a new spread so I had to introduce it gently. My youngest one, she's 5 years old, loved it too! I'll try to have a tea party today and see how my other two like these refreshing sandwiches. I used the recipe I found here at Allrecipes.com for Italian Seasoning Mix (dried) and mixed it in with this recipe. (Note: I cut down half of the salt requirement for the dry mix though.) This is definitely going into our favorites list! Thank you for sharing

I actually made these as real sandwiches, with the cucumbers in between two slices of crust-less white bread. I soaked half of the cucumbers in vinegar and added some black pepper for those who wanted a spicier snack. The sandwiches were a huge hit at girl's night and even more popular that the chocolate fountain!

I did not love these when I prepared them for a baby shower, but about half of the guests thought they were great.

I made these the night ahead. It made the Rye bread a little softer to eat. I made these for my baby shower and they where a hit! Everyone loved them. I also made these with seedless cucmbers.

I'd try something besides the packet of Italian dressing - I think that made the flavor too predictable.

I made these for two 4th of July gatherings. They were a hit. I think the whole package of dressing mix is just right, as long as you mix it up a day ahead. I used small French bread, or baguette and sprinkled with a pinch of parsley.

These were okay.  They didn't go fast at all at the shower I did and I had to throw most of them out at the end because the bread got stale.  I think the spread was a little too strong and half a packet would have made them better.

This is a terrific, easy to make recipe.  I actually blended the cream cheese up the night before. I added some black pepper, minced garlic and minced onion for additional flavor. The next morning I just beat the cream cheese again to make it soft and more spreadable and proceeded to make my sandwiches. I tried a few varieties of rye bread and was pleased with all the results. They were a rave hit at the baby shower I hosted--even some of the husbands tried and loved them when they dropped off their wives!  I had a few left overs but I had people almost fighting over who got to take them home. I will definitely be making these again.

These are the best.  People eat these up everytime I take them to a party.  Use a toothpick to keep the mess together when transporting.  I've been told these are "retro" by older women who haven't had them since they were kids.

These were really quick and easy to make.  I used pumpernickel bread instead of rye, and I quartered the slices.  Several people complimented the taste, and wanted the recipe.  They were light, and served as an outstanding afternoon snack at a small gathering.

I love cucumbers. I used wheat bread and just made regular size sandwiches with this recipe. Turned out great. Will continue to use the cream cheese blend in all my veggie sandwiches.

Made this recipe multiple times before.  Very easy and very addictive.  Try sprinkling each sandwich with a little bit of Old Bay seasoning for an extra kick!
