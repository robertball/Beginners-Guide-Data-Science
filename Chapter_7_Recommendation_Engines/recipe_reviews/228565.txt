It was ok. I Think the Cook time was too long. I Cooked 45 min and they were beginning to burn. I may try it again but just in a casserole pan and reduce  cook time.

Combination of ingredients good,but not worth the work involved and presentation difficult.  Would consider something else

It wasn't bad but not as a expected. Although the fried cheese on them was good, it made it very hard to separate them. They were too bready and not attractive. Probably won't try again even though they taste good.

Had this for dinner tonight. Used up some soy chorizo which gave this a little kick. It was a little bready for me so I'll play with the filling to biscuit ratio a bit.. nice recipe
