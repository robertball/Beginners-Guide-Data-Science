We very much enjoyed this rub, even though I did have to make two slight changes to the ingredients:  a decrease in the amount of cayenne (someone who shall remain nameless in this household does not like very spicy food!) and regular paprika rather than the Hungarian. The way I used it tonight was delicious---Trader Joe's bone-in skin-on chicken with a dab of butter under the skin, a trace of lemon olive oil on top followed by the rub generously scattered all over.  We don't eat the skin, but the flavor gets through in the 45-55 minutes of baking at 350 degrees.  Yummy!  I'll be sharing this rub with my son's family!  Thanks for the recipe!  YUM!

1st time using a rub. Tri tip came out wonderful! In full disclosure I must say I only used 1TB of salt and may actually omit even that next time. Next up is turkey breast for Thanksgiving. Thanks Phil for a great recipe!
