Wasn't much flavor. I marinated for an hour and didn't really even notice.

I marinated the shrimp for 2 1/2 hours and didn't get a lot of flavor from the marinade.  This was just ok.

Oh my goodness, this shrimp is amazing! I only had a little over 1 pound of shrimp and increased the cilantro to 1/4 cup. I let the shrimp marinate for 8 hours and only grilled them (separate from the veggies) for 2 minutes on each side because they had already "cooked" in the marinade. My family and in-laws LOVED this. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for my husband and he said it was good, but he wasn't wild about it.  I did make kabobs with the mix though and the veggies turned out awesome!
