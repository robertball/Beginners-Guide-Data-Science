This was very tasty. I didn't use the tomato paste as I didn't have that much liquid from the tomatoes in the first place and I couldn't bear the thought of mixing canned paste with my fresh-from-the-garden veggies! Something I do first with my eggplant always is salt it. Slice it 1/4 inch thick, layer it in a dish, sprinkling each layer with salt. Put a plate over it and weigh it down. Let it sit for at least 1 hour. Then rinse and pat dry and continue with your recipe. This will take out some of the bitterness and make it less spongy. That way when you put it in your oil to saute it doesn't soak it all up in 2 seconds flat.

I am new to eggplant and this was my first recipe to try it....and it was GREAT!  Really like the texture of the eggplant, too.

The prep time on this recipe is especially long but definitely worth it with the finished product!  Full of flavor, everything about it was great.  The only thing I did differently was added some grilled chicken breast directly to the sauce as it was cooking and served it over ziti.  Could make and freeze if you have summer tomatos and eggplant that you want to do something with rather than regular canning!  Fabulous!

it gets easier to make the more you make it.
It goes great over pasta (angel hair is my favorite).

This was delicious and reminiscent of the store-bought mediterrenean eggplant salad my husband loves (though certainly much better with fresh ingredients!) My only complaint was the amount of cayenne pepper called for; I found it too spicy, and while that's likely just personal preference, I would warn others to be wary of 1/2 tsp and use a sprinkle instead for flavor's sake. Otherwise, this is a delicious and healthy recipe I will use for years to come. Thanks for sharing!

This is delicious, but I made modification to the prep to make it faster and have less clean up. I oven-fried the eggplant- tossed the eggplant in oil in a bowl, then placed on a parchment paper at 375 for about 20 min, till golden brown. Less time, mess, and same results if you use enough oil. I also grilled the peppers in the oven at the same time. Yum!
