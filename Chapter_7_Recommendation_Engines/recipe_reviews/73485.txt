Big disappointment.  Edible, but wrong so many ways.  First of all, there were 3 big eaters and I bought just 2 pounds of mussels and we had leftovers (maybe wouldn't have if they had tasted better), but 2 pounds for 3 was ample - not 5 pounds for 4! Secondly, boil 10 minutes and then lower heat and cook another 5 until the shells open?  You're kidding, right?  The shells opened within a couple of minutes in the pot.  That left the onion and garlic not cooked enough and the beer taste very pronounced.  Glad I didn't bother with the linguini, as the the broth was, well, broth-like and not likely to stick to anything.  We fished out the mussels and ate the bread.  First time I had tried a recipe that included both beer and red wine.  Probably the last.  Try another recipe.  At $4.99 a pound, mussels deserve better.

This was my first time making mussels at home; this recipe was easy and delicious.  I stuck to the recipe, but added mushrooms, and served over pasta.  My teenager and I loved it!  Fabulous!

Melissa's recipe is terrific, just like the other reviewers said! I served it over linguine and sprinkled red hot pepper flakes on top for an added kick. A must try!

Absolutely delicious - wouldn't change a thing!  Made it for an appetizer before our baked haddock dinner & it was so yummy!

I didn't have the onion and used onion powder instead, used red cooking wine in place of red wine. I used canned plum tomatos and pureed the ingredients. It seemed to have a really nice flavor before mussels added.  But as the mussels cooked, the sauce thinned and lost flavor.  I imagine not using the onion & real red wine made a difference in the flavor.  I prefer a white wine base with garlic instead of tomatoe/red wine base.

Easy and Excellent.  I didn't use the peppercorns and didn't miss them.  The cooking instructions were right on for plump well cooked, but not chewy mussels.

This was fantastic.  I used a a can of diced tomatoes with chiles, which added great flavor.  The broth was a little watery(but so was my can of diced tomatoes), so the mussels were removed when cooked, and the liquid was reduced.  This was served over angel hair.  Will definitely make again.

Sorry but this was just OK. It was missing flavour. Maybe a little red pepper or more garlic,believ it or not. The sauce was too thin for pasta. Oh well, at least it was edible.

Pretty good recipe - made a few changes:
1) cooked the onions in the pot first - there's no way they would have been thoroughly cooked given the original directions
2) added some dried basil
3) served over rice in the bottom of a bowl - because like a soup after eating the mussels.


The recipe still could use a little something more to increase the flavor profile of the dish

We had this with bread and it was fantastic. I did not have an open wine so I used Creme de Cassis I am trying to use up - would definitely make it again! It was delicious - soup like- sauce too thin for pasta. I also saut√©ed onions, garlic for a bit, added tomato and cooked for a bit while I did other things. Then added liquids and let it all simmer a bit before I added the mussels. I can see just throwing in everything at the same time and bringing to a boil would not be as good.
