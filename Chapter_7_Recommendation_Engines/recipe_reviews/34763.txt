This is a great base recipe!  I made it using frozen hashbrown potatoes, & it couldn't have been any easier.  I did use fewer eggs, 10 instead of 12 & still came out perfect. Guests raved about it! Husband thought it was excellent with salsa on top.  Will make over and over!

The key to this recipe is to use the 'potatoes o'brien' found in the frozen potato section in the grocery store.  Thaw and then brown them in the skillet with the butter and some season salt. This cuts the prep/cook time considerably and makes it taste YUM!

I used Hash browns O'Brien to make it easier and it tasted a lot better too. So much easier when you want a good breakfast just don't want the mess and lengthy cooking time either. Will definitly make again.

I made this recipe for Christmas brunch along with my usual french toast casserole. I used frozen hash browns instead of fresh potatoes and Monterey Jack cheese w/Jalepenos instead of cheddar cheese. I also added diced cooked ham.
My family enjoyed it very much. We ate some left overs for breakfast today and it tasted just as good. Thank you very much for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again. Next time, though, I do plan on using the baking potatoes and not the hash browns.

I made this recipe for my christmas eve brunch. My family raved about it. I will definitely make it again. I read the reviews & they were very helpful. I seasoned & pre-cooked the hashbrowns in the oven for about 15 minutes. (next time I will cook them in a little oil to make them crispier instead of baking them) I used 10 eggs & one cup of milk. I assembled the casserole as follows: potatoes, onions, bacon, & then egg mixture.

This is a great recipe.

This was an awesome dish!! My husband raved about it and he's not a big breakfast fan.  I did add a can of diced green chilies to the eggs and a little extra season salt and garlic to the potatoes while they were browning.   I also used maple flavored sausage.   I was a little worried how that would go with the green chilis, but it was really very good!!!  This is definitly something I will make again!!

I'm not sure what to say about this. I liked it, but too many potatoes, and for some reason there was liquid in it, although I followed the recipe to a T. Anyone have any idea why that could have been? I baked it in a round casserole dish, had the sausage browned and drained, the potatoes and onions were cooked until tender, no added liquids at all, only the eggs.Next time I will cut down on the potatoes, but other than those two things it was great.

Potatoes can be cooked in microwave faster and also try adding a touch of savory and oregano with black pepper.  I used Italian sausage another time, and it was great.  Also try topping the casserole with juicy sliced tomatoes!!!!  Absolutely wonderful

Absolutely wonderful!  I added some mushrooms and used Colby Jack cheese instead of cheddar.  Also, I cut some time and created more flavor by using frozen hash browns with onions and peppers. Then I used pork sausage seasoned with sage.  My weekend guests loved it!!!!!!

made for Mom's birthday. loved by all. my husband said it was a " keeper." I used OBrien potatoes, sage sausage and sharp cheddar cheese.Cooked potatoes in sausage pan when finished with sausage for flavor. 12 eggs as recipe calls for perfect for 9 by 12 dish. I made the night before with all ingredients EXCEPT the eggs. whisked eggs and added them on top in morning and baked for 50 min. came out great and so tasty!

This was a little heavy on the potatoes.  Next time, I think I will use half the amount of potatoes and keep the rest of the recipe the same.  That might make it a little more like an omelette, but I think that will be good also.

I made this for out of state company.  It took about 1/2 hr to assemble (while taking care of 3 yr old), and 1/2 hour to bake.  I mostly followed recipe.  To save time I used a bag of thawed southwest style hashbrowns (which was too spicy for my taste & I didn't realize this when purchased).  Because I used these hashbrowns, I didn't add onion or seasoning salt as I thought it would be too much. (Next time I will use hashbrown OBrien or plain hashbrowns).  I also added about 1/4 c milk and pepper to eggs when whipped.  It's a personal choice as I like my eggs fluffy.  In directions, I was distracted by my son and placed egg before cheese. It didn't matter, as it was still molded together and tasted great (with the exception of the added spice from store bought hashbrown).  Although I didn't care for the added spice from hashbrowns I used, I believe this to be a 5 star recipe.  Casserole texture was great, and it molded together nicely, despite my mixup in egg/cheese order.  I will make again for special occasions or just because.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This was really good! For a family of three I made the following changes - Lightly beat 5 eggs and set aside. In a large skillet, browned 1/2lb roll sausage, drained and set aside. In the same skillet I added 2Tblsp oil, 1/2c chopped onion and 1-1/2c. defrosted frozen hashbrowns and tossed until browned.  Sprinkled with seasoning salt and poured into greased baking pan. Sprinkled with cheddar and poured eggs over, then sprinkled with pepper and no additional salt.  The eggs didn't fully cover the sausage - but it baked up great.  Baked 20min 350*

I made this last month w/out looking at the reviews (which I always do). So, needless to say, I made it as the directions read, and it came out ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! Not only did my boyfriend & I enjoy this, but 2 of my neighbors who dropped in unexpectedly! Of course they have asked me for the recipe, which is why I'm back in here today. All four of us give this recipe the 5 star's!

I modified this recipe quite a bit to make it a big winner in my house. Microwaved the diced red potatoes to save time (used only 3), then fried them with 1/2 cup diced sausage, 1/2 diced onion, 2 T. minced garlic, cajun seasoning & no-salt seasoning. Added 1/2 cup shredded cheese and mixed all in a glass pie plate, then froze til I needed it. I defrosted dish overnight, & in the morning mixed 7 eggs together (12 would have been way too much), poured eggs on top & mixed a bit, then baked at 350 for 30 minutes. PERFECTION!-- came out like a frittata. Thanks!

I so did not find this edible, but everyone else picked at it and ate it. It must have been me...the eggs puffed up swell, the potatoes took forever and a day to cook thinnly sliced. I threw in some onion and another cup of mozzarella cheese. If I ever made it again, which I won't, I'd use a spicy sausage to kick up the flavor, crumble bacon on top, and layer the sides with halved biscuit dough and glazed the whole thing with milk or garlic butter.

I followed others in cutting the potatoes down to just 3, and that was plenty.  In fact, they were the bulk of the preparation and next time I might substitute hash browns.  I sauteed the potatoes in half butter/half garlic oil.  I also used leeks instead of onions.  It was a hit with my clan.

We really enjoyed this casserole!  We would have used the frozen hash-browns as others suggested but did not have any.  I baked potatoes as the recipe stated and added green pepper along with the onions and butter.  We served it with pepperd gravy. Wonderful recipe.!

Great recipe.  I used frozed potatos obrien instead of baking my own.  I also added some chopped bell peppers to the sausage when I browned it.  As great as it was, the leftovers were even better the next day wrapped in a tortilla with some sour cream and hot sauce!

I used potatoes O'brien like some of the other viewers. Added in some chopped garlic and mushrooms. Used mild Italian sausage, it added just the right amount of spice. I will cut down on the amount of potatoes next time (I used a 2lb bag). This is a good recipe.

My boyfriend and I both thought that this was fantastic! I used only a half a pound of sausage and substituted the other half with fresh mushrooms that i quickly sauteed with thyme. I cut my potatoes in cubes then browned them on the stove top and once browned added onions and let them cook for a while. I also substituted half the eggs with egg beaters...it took a little longer to cook but it was well worth it!

I made this for a mens prayer breakfast.  I made 20 servings.  I only used 10 potatoes, 2 lbs of sausage and alsmost 2 lbs of bacon.  I also cooked the potato and onions in the bacon grease for added flavor.  After layering the sausage down I layed down strips of bacon then cheese and eggs.  Very moist and delicious!!!!  My entire family loved it also including my son who hates eggs!

I have made this recipe (with my own additions) several times and it turns out great everytime...but I would like to know if anyone has tried this recipe without meat. I have to make two pans for a brunch this weekend and to cater to everyone, I would like to make one with meat and one without.THANKS!!!

After reading other reviews, I came up with this version: used turkey breakfast sausage sauteed w/a little onion; instead of baking the potatoes I shredded 2 med. potatoes and lightly sauteed them w/e.v.o.o. and s&p. Layered potatoes, then sausage, then added a layer of some leftover homemade creamed spinach, then mozzerella, then the eggs. It was so delish. The whole family, from 14 month old on up, just loved it. I served it w/the Strawberry Oatmeal Breakfast Smoothie from this site to round out an easy supper. Thanks for this one!

Good base recipe!  I used frozen hashbrowns, fresh sliced mushrooms, 1/2 can rotel with chilis , 7 eggs with about 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream and 1/2 a can of cheddar soup in addition to the cheese called for in the recipe.  When there was about 10 min remaining I placed several spoon fulls of sour cream over top and returned it to the oven.  Taste great with salsa over the top!

I have made this twice now and both times it required much longer cooking time than indicated. However, it has certainly been added to our regular weekend breakfast menu. So simple to make the night before then pop in the oven in the morning. Thanks for submitting a great breakfast recipe!

The first thing to note is that cubed potatoes take longer than 30 minutes to cook. To make it easier, I used a 1-lb 4oz package of fresh (not frozen) diced potatoes with onions. It took about 50 minutes to cook (it it's watery when you cut into it it is not done). I never cared for the breakfast casseroles with the cubed bread. This is a GREAT alternative.

This was wonderful.  I used frozen cubed potatoes to save time, cooked it with butter & 1/2 the onions.  I used bacon instead of sausage.  I brought it to work and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I also had made it the night before and baked it in the morning while I got ready for work.

This recipe was great..I saved a lot time by cutting out the step of baking the potatoes 1st. I just peeled and cubed, then stirred and browned them in saucepan til almost done. Also I added diced plum tomatoes, onions and green peppers...everyone loved it including my Mom, who has a hard time trying anything new.

A simple tasting, but still flavorful dish.  I cook the onion & potato mixture in the sausage grease, adding additional butter as needed.  It *is* pretty greasy, though, when you cut into it, despite thorough draining of everything before baking.

Very good and easy if you use the hash browns, which I did. I also added a box of chopped broccoli. Other than that I didn't change anything. This all fit into a 7x11 dish perfectly. Will do this one again.

I subsituted frozen hash browns by thawing them then browning them with the onions. This made the prep time must quicker and easier. Only used about a teaspoon of seasoning salt but that was plenty for our taste. I made this the night before and then just popped it in the oven the next morning. It was very good and I will make this again.

We ended up having surprise guests the day I planned on making this.  It was a hit.  Only suggest microwaving the potatoes.  30 minutes turned into an hour and then an hour and a half and I would have saved myself tons of time.  I also used reduced fat cheese to cut down a little of the fat, but that was the only modification on this one.

wonderful! i made half of this the night before so that i could bake it before school. it definatly takes longer for 30 minutes to cook, so be prepared to wait longer!!! i didn't add the green chiles like someone said i shouldve, and i regret it. it's a great recipe and the green chiles would make it better with more flavor.
thankyou!


remember-

-leave extra time for baking

-add chilis for more flavor

This is a great breakfast casserole. Very flavorful and moist.This is definitely a keeper in this family! When I make it again, I believe I will either reduce cooking temp or time. The egg portion of the dish turned out dry and rubbery. I'm thinking a little less cooking time will get them firm, but not overdone.Thanks Robbie.

Tasty, and enjoyed by the entire family.  
I used some leftover skillet red potatoes to shorten the process.  I cooked it a bit longer than recommended because the eggs were slightly runny. 
Will be making this again soon.

easy and quick to put together. i used frozen hashbrowns instead of potatoes -- which cut down on cooking time considerably. hearty dish with lots of breakfast flavors. served with biscuits makes it a complete meal.

I would've given this four stars but based on my wife's 2, it averages out to three...I liked that it was a hearty, simple breakfast dish but it did take some effort with the potatoes; she didn't like the proportion of ingredients and felt like it was to heavy, something maybe for a deer camp but not for everyone.

Pretty good.  I used 3 potatoes, shredded them, and sauted them along with the onion.  I subbed turkey sausage, used 2 cups of cheddar cheese, and added mushrooms.  After the eggs were set, I broiled the casserole for a few minutes to get a crisp top.

Great base recipe.  I cubed and boiled the potatoes for only 5 minutes then drained and rinsed them in cold water.  I cooked the potatoes with butter, the onion, mushrooms and garlic.  Just before the potato mixture is done add about a tablespoon (more or less) of low sodium soy sauce.  It gives the potatoes more favor and turns them nice and brown.  Be sure to add less season salt on top of the potatoes.  I just sprinkled it lightly over top.  I also dotted the top of the casserole with 4 oz of cut up cream cheese.  Yum.

This was a "house pleaser" here. I added green chilies, as the other reviews suggested. This was a simple recipe to make and there were no leftovers. I did use 12 eggs and next time I will decrease it to 10. Great casserole, thanks for sharing!!

Used frozen, shredded hashbrowns (instead of baking potatos), low fat sausage, and two percent cheese for reduced calories/fat. Definitely needs a good amount of salt and pepper or will turn out bland. Also, I stored in fridge before cooking next morning - that required a solid hour of baking.  Recipe is great - has real potential! Other reviews are correct, green chilis and/or bell peppers and other vegetables etc. would definitely add different flair to dish.  Could even do that on just half the dish in case kids don't like "green." Also next time I make it I'm going top with a jar of salsa shortly after removing from oven.  Thanks so much!!!

Made w/ frozen tater tots (cooked).  Added 1/2 c mi1k to 10 eggs, w/ small can of diced chillis.  Topped w/ salsa, and sour cream on the side.  
Very good!

Ok, so I made mine a little different.  I used bacon, then just cubed my potatoes and fried them in a little bacon grease,without precooking, until they were done.  It took about 20 mins, but its still 20 min. faster than precooking them.  I added about 2 tbsp. minced garlic to my potatoes and onions.  My husband, son and I loved this!

I made this recipe for a brunch after my daughter's confirmation.  I'd say it was alright, but not up to my standards for entertaining - probably won't make it again.  It's adequate - just not memorable...  I didn't like the chunks of potatoes, might be better with hash browns.  Baking the potatoes, then cooling, peeling and chunking was a hassle.  If I were to do it again I would either buy the potatoes already in this form (simply potatoes brand) or else peel and boil them the night before for ease in preparation.

We loved this one.  It's pretty simple and my son loved helping makes this one.  Next time I might put a couple extra eggs because mine came out a little dry.

This is a nice meal, but I didn't love it. My husband, a huge breakfast fan, said it was good but not great. It was really soggy, I don't know what went wrong. I may try it again with some tweaks, but I'm not sure.

The family of 6 adults and 5 children loved this tecipe. None was left after breakfast. The only thing I would do different next time is add the sausage to the potatoes. Thanks for the delicious recipe. Making it over night was wonderful. All I had to do was bake it the next morning. Which was a blessing with a large crowd to feed.

Great recipe. Had many compliments and requests for it. I used shredded hash browns and lightly browned them in the oven before adding the rest of the ingredients on top. I also used maple flavored sausage and added spinach. Very yummy. Will make again.

I made this for a friend, so I didn't actually taste it.  It smelled really good, though.  It did take MUCH longer to cook than 30 minutes - the eggs were still runny so I had to put it in for probably another 20-30 minutes!

I made this exactly as it was written and I agree that it called for a little too much potato, so I did maybe four the next time.  I got a little impatient waiting for them to cool enough to peel them, so now I use either red or gold potatoes.  No peeling necessary and it's extra delicious.  My kids love it!  Also, I poke the potatoes with a fork and microwave them for about 12 minutes (for smaller potatoes, probably close to 10 of them) and then I can chop them up promptly and cook them with the butter and onion.

I wasn't crazy about this one - I used 5 small russet potatoes (peeled, cubed, sauteed with green onion) and the 12 eggs as called for - too dry for my taste. I like lots of flavor, so I added TJoe's 21 Seasoning spice blend as well as garlic salt and even some tobasco - still not as much flavor as I'd hoped for. Will try again, cutting back on the potatoes as others suggested, so the sausage/egg/cheese flavors can come through.

I used tater tots instead of baking potatoes and made it all on top of the stove. The two teaspoons of seasoning salt was WAY TOO MUCH! I only put in one tsp and IT was too much.  The saltiness ruined it for me so I plan on making it again sometime and totally leave out the salt.

I made this for dinner one night and I Love breakfast for dinner. I changed this a little bit I added diced ham w/ the sausage, I also browned the potato's w/ a little bit of cayenne pepper and I put white and yellow corn on top of the egg layer and cheese on top of the whole thing. The corn added little bit of crunch and just a little bit of sweetness. I will be making this again. Thank you

Great base recipe. Way too many potatoes though. I used 3. I added 3 more eggs and 10 sliced green olives. I used a variety of seasonings otherwise this would have been quite bland. I put in some New Orleans seasoning for some kick.

I too used the hashbrowns from the freezer like other users. Served on Christmas morning, it was a great hit!!  I added mushrooms and will probably add some green chiles and tomato for next time.

I had a 1/2 lb. of Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage leftover from chili I made the previous night, and since there is only 2 of us, I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 metal baking pan. I baked the stated time of 30 mins and it turned out great. The only other change I made is I microwaved the 3 potatoes for 6 minutes instead of baking to save time, but I don't think that makes a difference for taste.  The reason I give the recipe only 4/5 stars is because when made as stated, I thought it was a little on the bland side, even though I used hot sausage. However, with some hot sauce sprinkled on top, it was delicious. I think if you can add something flavorful to make it your own, it makes the recipe 5 stars.

For my first time making this tonight, I used 2 baking potatoes (microwaved, then cubed), 11 eggs (didn't have a full 12), and 3 wheat dinner rolls (torn to pieces; to use them up), bacon, ham, and a variety of cheeses (cheddar, monterey jack, mozzarella, and havarti). Seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder (preferred to actual onions), garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Topped with a few unsalted, sliced almonds. Had to bake for an extra 15 minutes before it looked done, and will reduce the time by 5 minutes next time since it came out a little dry. Probably needs that extra egg too.  Great flavor and a great base recipe to tinker with in the future!

This is a great starter recipe.  You can dump almost anything into it that you have on hand.  I used bacon sausage, and hashbrowns instead of potatoes, and it was great!!  Next time I'll add some diced tomatoes, green onions, and maybe some bell pepper!

I made this with a bag of hashbrowns from the fridgerated section of the grocery. Soooo good. My husband is completely enamored.(I personally don't like frozen hashbrowns so I get the refrigerated ones. I never can shake the frozen taste off the frozen ones.)  Update: I usually make this with turkey  sausage, however, my grocery store stopped carrying. So I now make it with the Turkey Sausage recipe from this site.:) I personally like pork sausage better than turkey sausage but I this with this casserole turkey sausage tastes better.

I made this recipe for a "breakfast for dinner" night with friends. I added bell peppers and extra seasonings and baked it in two pie plates. I also made it a few hours ahead  and kept it in the fridge until it was time to bake, just before dinner, so the baking took a little longer. It turned out great!

I tried this recipe for dinner.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions.  I used bacon, which is what I had on hand, fried the potatoes in the bacon grease to save time and then put it all together to cook.  I also replaced the cheese with velvetta.  It was good. It needed more seasoning, but I did not cook the potatoes in onion because I am nursing a baby and have to avoid onion.  I think the onion would have added the extra flavor.  Everyone asked for seconds so it must of been tastier then they lead me to believe by their responses.  We will have it again, especially when I can add the onion.

This was pretty good, but mine turned out rather dry with crispy/hard meat. Good flavor though, I seasoned to our tastes.  I went back and rechecked the recipe after it was done to make sure I hadn't left out milk or sour cream or something, or not assembled it correctly.  I wish I'd more thoroughly read the reviews before trying this though.  Because of reviews stating a longer baking time was needed, I used a 9 X 13 pan thinking that would help it cook in 30 min.  I don't care for the bready breakfast casseroles with tons of cheese and butter, and that is why this one caught my eye.  Next time, if I try this again, I will probably add some milk or sour cream and use a deeper casserole dish.  The only change I made was using turkey sausage.  Kids and hubby liked this, and my pickiest son's only complaint was the hard meat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was quite good!  I decided to follow it exactly since I have a tendency to want fidge around with recipes. :).  So, the next time I make this I will mix the ingredients together and maybe top it off with additional cheese.  We found the bottom all potato and needing something.  I did season as suggested too.  Also, I didn't have time to bake and such as the recipe called for the potatoes...so I washed, peeled and boiled them in salted water to speed that process.  Worked out great.  Thanks for sharing this casserole.  We had it for dinner with fruit salad..quite yummy! :)

To cut down on time, I used the frozen hashbrown potatoes and they worked great.  Tried sausage links cut up and they worked good too.  This came out wonderful.  I recommend this to any breakfast lover!

Prefect breakfast this morning. I did halve the recipe. I like the idea of real potatoes so I nuked my 3 russet potatoes for 15 minutes.  I then peeled and chopped and fried them up with the onion.  I forgot the seasoned salt but just added salt at the table and it really filled us up!  We won't have to eat until dinner time, and that works for me.

Loved it! Made half the recipe in an 8x8 pan for two people. I baked the potatoes as directed and I'm glad I did...it was a great foundation for a casserole that I let sit in the fridge overnight. I didn't have sausage so I used ground beef and added garlic powder for flavor. I used eight eggs; enough to cover the casserole and the cook time was longer than stated--approximately 40-45 minutes or until the eggs were set. We loved it and the leftovers were delicious too! A definite keeper!

I only did a half recipe and baked the potatoes a day before. I added milk to my beaten eggs. I also added chopped green and red pepper, as well as spinach for some extra nutrition. I used bacon instead of sausage and cut off the extra fat. Great base recipe, and I will be tweaking it to make it a healthier breakfast option since it would reheat fairly well.

I made this for Mother's Day Brunch.  I used hash browned potatoes. Didn't measure ingredients , but I probably used three cups of cheese (we LOVE cheese), and used 16 eggs. I also added a layer of fresh spinach. After baking about 30 minutes, it was watery - continued cooking for 10-15 minutes and it was perfectly done. Mom, husband, and guests all loved it.

I prepared this on Christmas Eve and put in the oven while we were opening presents Christmas morning. It was delicious! I used diced ham instead of sausage and put in some broccoli florets. I will definitely make this again next year!

I made this for my family for Christmas morning, it was very good. Everyone loved it and went for more. I will make it again.. I used frozzen hashbrowns and it came out great. Make sure you season the potatoes while you are cooking in the pan I used a litter extra butter.

I was looking for this type of casserole for Christmas brunch one year and this was the recipe I used.  From that time forward I am not "allowed" to omit this from Christmas brunch...I see that I printed this originally in 2004!

My husband is making this a once a week must! I would cook the potatoes a little more so they arent' so firm on the first serving, but on warm up the next day it goes to five stars all the way! I used Jimmy Dean spicy sausage to give it a boost also.

Very good.  I made it twice in one week for two brunches I had over the holidays. I thought this tasted alot better with veggies, so I added 8 oz of sliced mushrooms, 1/2 a diced red pepper and 2 sliced green onions.  I also used a 12oz bag of unfrozen shredded hasbrowns which tasted great as well as cut back on time.  This recipe is alot better with cheddar cheese.  I made it with swiss the second time and it did not taste as good/or give as much flavor as the cheddar.

this was very good. I just made it for my mom and I. But I made a few small changes that saved time and money. Instead of baking the potatoes in the oven to make tender for 30 mins. I microwaved them for 10 mins. I also didn't use the butter to cook my potatoes and onions. I just took out the pork sausage and drained it on paper towels and reused the pork sausage grease to cook the potatoes and oninons! I also chopped the oninons instead of slicing them.

Great breakfast casserole. I put everything together except the eggs on Christmas Eve and then just added the eggs in the morning and bake, covered. I left it in while we unwrapped presents, it took about 45-50 minutes probably because it was cold going in.

Yum! I halved the recipe (fed three of us) and used frozen cubed hashbrowns. Used garlic instead of onion, 3 whole eggs & 3 egg whites. Added a can of chopped green chilis and 1/4 cup of reduced-fat sour cream. Used reduced-fat mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar. Sprinkled sliced green onions on top in the last 5 minutes. I cooked in a 2 quart casserole, and it took longer to cook than the recipe instructed, I would probably use a 11x 7 glass pan instead next time. SOOOO good! There were no leftovers.

I altered this recipe for time.  I use hash browns and just brown them in a pan.  Then my family prefers bacon, so I just the pre-cooked and just crumble it into the potatoes as I add them into the cassarole dish.  I top with some Cheddar and Mozarella cheese.  When whipping the eggs, I add some milk, so they taste more like scrambled, and then pour that over the potatoe mixture and top with a bit more cheese.  It does take a bit longer for baking. Bake for 45 minutes.  It's easy and tastes great!!

This was very good! To save some time I used large unpeeled redskin potatoes and cut them into bite size pieces. I baked them in the oven for 10-15 minutes, and then followed the recipe from there.

I make this recipe for our Easter egg hunt every year, and for other brunch occasions.    I make it easier by using a bag of hash brown potatoes with onion and peppers.  I just leave out steps 1 and 2.  It turns out great every time, everyone requests it!

I cooked the potatoes in the microwave the night before I was going to make this and the next day while they were cool from the fridge, it was easy to grate them, mix them with some sauteed onions and peppers and butter and put them in the baking dish.  I also added some cream cheese (about 3 oz. I had left over from something else) with the eggs.  It was good and we also enjoyed it as leftovers.

Very good recipe. I didn't have baking potatoes or frozen hash browns as some had suggested, so I grated red potatoes and cooked them with the onion. It turned out great. This is an easy to make recipe and very good. I will make this again!

I made this with two large baking potatoes (cut into chunks, boil in microwave until tender, then pan fried).  I had plenty of potatoes.  I thought it was was pretty good and a nice change for the usual, but my family prefered the Egg and Sausage casserole with the cresent rolls as a crust.

Took this to an AM ladies bible study group and it was a BIG hit. This is a keeper that I will use again for different breakfast/brunch functions. Thanks!

This turned out pretty well. I did not follow the recipe exactly though....I used only 3 potatoes ((as it was there was a lot of potato, 6 would have been way too many!!)) I used 1 lb. Italian Sausage instead of the bulk pork. I added garlic powder to the potatoes while browning. I ended up using a 9x13 pan ((due to the amount of potatoes)) so I added 6 more eggs to help cover the rest better. I used an 8 oz block of sharp cheddar, which I shredded. I had to bake it a bit longer than stated. I think that would be due to the extra eggs...they were still a little runny after 30 minutes. But I let it set for about 5 minutes and then ENJOYED!! As did the rest of the family! These are good reheated too! Thanks....

I would use more seasoning when doing the potatoes. I halved this recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan. Also, I needed to microwave the potatoes as 30 minutes in the oven didn't cut it.

I used regular russet potatoes and not frozen hashbrowns. My hubby and I both agreed the regualr potates do not need to be substituted for hashbrowns. I peeled, cut up and boiled the potatoes until they were just soft enough to easily peirce with a fork. Then put the potateos in a pan with, butter, mild green chilies, and pepper. Cook it 5-10 minutes then layered everything per the directions. Definatly serve with salsa. My mother who does not like salsa actually agreed that salsa was good on it.

I gave this four star because my husband liked it although we both thought it was a little bland.  With that said I did switch out ham and bacon for the sausage which could be part of the problem but will probably add more onion and bell peppers next time and maybe a dash of something to add a little spice.  Like everyone else said no matter, it is a good base recipe.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit! Even my brother ate it when I made this for a big family get together at breakfast time and he doesn't normally eat sausage. I used canned potatoes, turkey sausage and skipped the onions. Next time I'm going to substitute bacon for the sausage. This has become a favorite for the family.

Yum!  We had this for dinner tonight, and it was great.  I used frozen hashbrowns (kudos to those who have the patience to cook potatoes) - they worked great!  Added a diced red bell pepper to the potato mixture, and combined both sausage and ham.  Other reviewers are right - this a great "kitchen sink" type recipe that you can use to throw in any veggies/meats with success!

Very good!!! I read several reviews, and followed recommendation of using hash brown potatoes...they worked very good...I also used 1/2 lb sage sausage, and 1/2 lb maple sausage, because that's all I had on hand...I was a bit worried about the flavors, but it worked out just fine...I will definately make this again, only next time I think I'll use a red or green pepper to add a bit more color...

We used a flavored sausage (green pepper and onion) and I added 1/4 teaspoon sage.  We also subbed Montery Jack for some more flavor.  It was good but probably not something I'd make again.

My family has been making this since I can remember.  We slice the potatoes and fry them in the sausage grease.  If I'm feeling lazy, I also will use frozen hash brown potatoes.  And Velveeta makes it so creamy and delish!  =)

This was exactly what I was lookinf for.  I had read the reviews about the potatoes needing more flavor so I added more seasoned salt and some onion powder.  I also boiled the potatoes instead of baking them.  I think I boiled them too long, but it turned out good.

This recipe takes quite a bit of time, but, the end result is definitely worth the wait.  I scaled mine back just a bit for size portions, but, did exactly what the recipes said to do.  I could not keep the other people in my family out of the potato and onion mixture before it actually went in the dish.  You will not be disappointed..

I made this for a ladies luncheon at church and everyone raved on it!  I went about half and half with bacon and sausage and rather than baking the potatoes, I pan fried them and the onions until just tender.

This was very good and exactly what i was looking for, Thank You. I didn't add the onion for the kids sake but added some onion powder for the  flavor. I would only say do not use really big potatoes, use meduim sized ones. I ended up adding more egg to compensate for the mistake but it was still very good!
Thanks again.

This was a really good recipe. I added bacon along with the sausage, and I used frozen hash brown potatoes. I also used Sharp cheddar cheese and used more then it called for. It turned out great. And my kids absolutely loved it. I will definately make this again. Thanks.

This was my first time making this and it came out great! I did substitute the butter with olive oil and added 14 eggs plus green chilies. It's outstanding!! My husband is going to be excited when he wakes up :)!!

I used a hot pepper cheese and cooked my potatoes in the microwave instead of the oven.  I also was in a hurry so I did not peel the potatoes.  Instead of putting the cheese on the mixture and then putting the eggs on that I put the cheese on top of the egg mixture.  It turned out really well.  The family is asking that I make it again.

The time and trouble to cook and peel the potatoes detracted from this recipe, but worst of all, following the cook times given, the casserole wasn't baked in time for the brunch I was taking it to. It needed an extra 10-15 min,  and still the potatoes were not done (I have a gas oven). Also, taste was very bland (and I added a bit of minced garlic to it as well).

I made this today!  The flavor was excellent and the ingredients were all so simple.  I was a little disappointed with the details of the the ingredients.  I would recommend the potatoes  be finely chopped into bite side pieces, i cut them in cubes.

Wow, a new favorite breakfast casserole!!! I absolutely can not believe how great this turned out. Following previous suggestions, I made a few minor tweaks. (And also to lower the fat/calories significantly.) I used garlic and herb seasoned shredded hashbrowns, cooked per package instructions. I also subbed out vegan sausage which I sauteed with chopped onion. Instead of a dozen eggs, I used 2 whole eggs and egg substitute in the equivalent of 7 eggs, which I beat with 2 TBPS fat free sour cream. (Gives eggs a nice fluffy texture.) The cheese layer as fat free cheddar. For assembly, I used a greased deep round Pyrex dish, and layered per recipe instructions. It was the perfect amount for this size casserole and looked really nice when the eggs puffed up on top. It took closer to 45 minutes total cook time. At the last ten minutes, I added a handful of reduced fat cheddar to the top and let that melt and brown. Turned out absolutely amazing and relatively guilt free!! A definite keeper!

Really good, simple and satisfying.  I didn't entirely follow the recipe since I omitted the baking step for the potatoes and also only used 3 (plenty).  I peeled, cubed and sauteed the potatoes with a combination of oil and butter.  I added the seasoned salt as specified, but I didn't measure it.  I'm used to eyeballing my seasonings. The sausage I used was spicy which helps with flavor and made a difference in the overall outcome (IMO).  I added milk to the eggs and ended up baking this closer to 45/50 minutes as my eggs were not set in the half hour stated.

I cooked this for a camp .... 28 people. It was a HUGE  hit. They absolutely loved it. Kids who don't usually like caseroles or cheese were coming back for seconds and thirds. I reduced the eggs a tiny bit...10 instead of 12. I also used more sausage than it asked for.  I recomend having ketuchup on hand for the ketchup lovers....goes perfectly with it. I will definetly make it again!

I make this all the time using frozen shredded hash browns and a tube of sausage, but it's just as good with ham, diced and browned.  I freeze it in individual portions and re-heat it in the microwave, and it is still excellent-I love it with a little salsa on top.  The only thing I do differently is I bake it covered in foil for 30 minutes and take the foil off for 10 more minutes.  My co-workers request it for their "Birthday breakfast" instead of cake!

VERY good!! - just dont use as many potatoes as called for.  I made a serving for 4 and used 2 potatoes & it was perfect. 
Also added green peppers with the potatoes & onions, cayenne & paprika.  
My fiance' & I like it spicy, so added hot sauce on top when ready to eat!  YUMMMMM!!!!

This is really tasty, although I added only 6 eggs. I peeled and cubed potatoes, then boiled them until tender. I layered everything in a baking pan and I threw in some other leftovers from the fridge to use them up. I will be making it again. Thanks for the great idea.

I used hashbrowns instead of potatoes and Jimmy Dean Maple sausage.   Turned out pretty good.  My boyfriend loved it.  It did require an extra 10 minutes to bake.

Really good....great recipe for real potatoes, but I think next time I will try to shred the hashbrowns instead of cube them and maybe do less potatoes and more eggs.  It might need to be baked longer than 30 minutes though because the eggs in the middle of the casserole stilled seemed runny.

This was great! It was very simple to make and very tasty. I did make a few changes. To suit my family's taste, I used frozen tator tots instead of potatoes and fried them together with broccoli, mushrooms, minced onion, and 1 tablespoon of garlic salt. However, I think it would have tasted better without any seasoning. I added light salt and pepper on top as instructed and that was good. All in all, it was like a giant omelette. Delicious!

This was really good but I did make some changes.  I used 4 TBLSP butter to brown the potatoes and used 13 eggs instead of 12.  I also added some parsley and spinach for color and added 1/2 a cup of colby jack cheese.  It probably would have been great how it was written, but I thought I would add my own stuff also!

I agree with some of the other reviewers who said this was dry.  I think next time I'll stir in some salsa or even just chopped tomato to give it some moisture. I did make this a one pot dish though.  My pots are oven safe so I browned the onion, sausage and hash browns in the pan then just added the cheese and egg on top and put the whole thing in the oven. I'll probably make this again, but I'll definitely be adding either salsa or a cream soup to give it some moisture.

Great recipe.  I used what I had in the refrig/freezer - 8 link sausage cut into pieces, 11 eggs and 1/2 bag diced potatoes w/ green peppers.  Was awesome. Thank for the recipe!  I baked in an 8 x 8 pan and cooked an additional 10 minutes.

I would add more veggies next time.  Bell peppers, maybe mushrooms (if I were not going to serve it to a large group), howeverI got tons of compliments and none was left at the end of our breakfast.  very easy and fast to make I could have made the first half the night before and added the eggs while taking my shower the morning of the party.

This was super easy to make.  I did as others recommended and made it using potatoes O'brien to cut down on the prep time.  I was pleasantly surprised it didn't get dry.  I would make this again because of the ease, but I didn't think there was really anything that special about it.

I thought it was great! I couldn't stop eating it!  I would follow the direction part to the "T" the next time though.  I didn't and I think it would have made a difference if I would have done it right.  But do notice that I used the phrase "next time" because I will definitely be making this one again. :)

I made this for a church brunch, using regular frozen hash browns for one and O'Brien for another.  They were gone in a flash! Having never made it before and wondering how it was, since I didn't get any, I found my 14 year old son and asked him.  His response? "MAKE THIS AT HOME!"  It was a huge hit!

I was a little disappointed in the end result. I found it dry. I followed the recipe but used Ore Ida hash browns as suggested by others. The recipe did not suggest covering it with foil ~ maybe that might have helped. Also, I thought that maybe adding milk to the eggs would make it moister. Some of my family dipped it in ketchup or hot sauce to moisten it.

YUM!! Don't forget to season with salt & pepper.  Add a few dashes of hot sauce after plating. Delicious!!! I will definately make it again.

I used hash browns, good and easy way to make breakfast for a crowd. I thought needed more spice, so will add garlic and maybe some cayenne or something.

This recipe (as written) is pretty good. I prefer this type of casserole over the others on this site that require bread in the mixture. I do add more seasonings (Mrs. Dash Table Blend) green onions and only use a bad of hashbrowns rather than baking my own potatoes so to speed things up. Very good!

I made this recipe for a brunch.  Everyone loved this casserole.  I will definitely make this one again.  I didn't use as many potatoes as the recipe called for - I used one less.

This was quick and easy which is just what I needed so that I could pitch in for a work "Spirit" breakfast. I used a dozen Medium eggs but next time I'll use large. I also used frozen O'Brien hashbrown potatoes as some of the other comments suggested and it turned out great! There wasn't any left after the masses got to it!

Made this for Sunday morning family breakfast.  The kids enjoyed it.  I should have cut the butter in half though and the baking time was closer to an hour.  I will be making this again just with less butter.

I would defenitly make it again, i followed the exact recipe exept i spiced up my potatoes(wich i only ended up using 4) wile browning with the onion with "maggy chiken bouliion" and added a layer of fresh baby spinach(i buy organic pre-rinsed) between the potatoes and the sausage. and i used an extra cup of cheesse(white extra sharp cheddar)it gave it a much more fresh flavor!! also i used an 11" 1/2 by 14" corning ware dish and it all fitted perfecly. my hubby loves his breakfast casseroles and this one hit the spot!!!

Mmm...yummy! I cut the recipe in half and seasoned the eggs instead of placing seasonings on top. Since I was using cheese leftover from Macaroni & Cheese, I added mozzarella and american cheese to the mix. Breakfast felt so decadent and fancy, but it only took a little while to make. I'm sure that the leftovers will pack well for those breakfasts on the go during the week too...

Made the following changes: used potatoes O'Brien. Added 10 oz spinach and a can of mushrooms. Turned out well, and was definitely liked, but I was hoping for something with more egg flavor. I tasted mostly meat and potatoes. May try again altering the ratios.

Easy and delicious.  Browned up the potatoes and sausage (Jimmy Dean hot) the night before, thew it together and baked in the morning.  Used the review tip from other users (O'Brien potatoes).  It's a keeper for my family.

This is quite probably the most adaptable of all brunch casserole recipes.  I threw in cooked hash browns, bacon, pre-cooked sausage, diced canadian bacon, diced ham leftover from Christmas dinner...then found out that we had five more people coming for brunch!  OK...fried up some more hash browns, added two extra eggs, and voila!  Brunch for a zillion, and this recipe made it look easy!  Thank you so much for a great outline for a holiday brunch casserole!

Followed the recipe to the T...just okay for me.  I thought it had way too many potatoes.  It might be better if done with shredded potatoes.  Will probably look for another breakfast casserole recipe the next time I make one.

I cheated and made this with the frozen O'Brien potatoes. It is great. Be sure not to bake too long. It will be really good with some homemade salsa on top. Can't wait to make it for my husband when he gets off the road. Very easy to make.

This was really good and pretty easy to make.  I took some of the other reviewer's advice and cooked the potatoes in the microwave - really cut down on a lot of time.  I took in mind some of the reviewers saying the potatoes tasted bland so I salted them and fried them in the same pan I had made the sausage in so they got some flavor with the sausage drippings.  My husband loved it and had 2 big helpings and said definitely make it again.  My kids aren't huge egg/sausage eaters but they each had some and liked it still. (I made french toast and served this as a side dish).  I will make it again for sure!

I halved this recipe just for me, hubby, and daughter (no one else like eggs) and made a few small changes...I cooked the sausage and then cooked the chopped onion in the grease. I cooked frozen hash browns (loose in the bag, not the little rectangle ones) until they were nice and brown. The egg was a little too dry (and I didn't even cook it the entire 30 minutes) - next time I'll add more egg and cook it a little less time. I think this would be delicious with sauteed green pepper and a creamier cheese added to it. Hubby and daughter loved it. We had soome left over, but not sure how reheated egg would be???

My whole family enjoyed this dish, especially picky husband.  I only made one addition - I added garlic per other reviews to add some flavor.  I also used pre-cubed bags of potatoes and onions to save time.  We will be using this one again!

Served for the first time at Family Christmas Brunch.  It was a huge success. I will have to make two next year!  I did substitute the baking potatoes with frozen, cubed hashbrowns to make it easier.

kind of a pain to make and tastes a little bland unless you add lots of seasoning salt, but very delicious and filling. A favorite in my house.

I made this one night before because I knew I wasn't going to have time to fix breakfast the next morning. I didn't have any seasoning salt and instead of baking the potatoes, I used SImply Potatoes with Onions. That made it a lot easier and faster. We liked the recipe but it was bland wihout the seasoing salt. Next time I'll make sure tho have some!

This was good, but could it could use something more.  Perhaps seasonings or different cheeses.  Mine was also runny and needed to cook longer.

This recipe was wonderful!!! I used sweet baby red potatoes instead of the baking potatoes and it turned out awesome with so many endless possibilties!! It's also a hard one to mess up (which is what usually happens when i cook :O)- I will make this over and over again. Even my hubby who isn't a big breakfast ate it and loved it even when it was reheated! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

We have guests at the lake and I love the ease of casseroles for breakfast. Potatoes O'Brien is the only change. Cook them in some butter and then continue the recipe from there. Everyone loves it.  For several years now actually,

I thought this was easy and very good.   All my brunch guests liked it, but my picky husband did not.   For the first time ever  I used frozen prepared potatoes - following others' advice - o'brien hash browns.   I cooked them in a skillet following the package directions, used them in the recipe, and I thought they were great.    I was concerned they would not taste good or have weird texture or something - but they didn't.   I don't plan to become a regular user of prepared convenience foods like this - preservatives etc. - but for the occasional breakfast  casserole I will.

Good recipe but was kind of bland. I will make it again but will use sharp cheddar instead of  mozzarella. Also will add crumbled sausage. But that's just me.

I made it and added mushrooms,onions,garlic,and spinach to the mix and traded the cheddar for an Italian cheese blend. Gonna divvy it up and use it for individual breakfast for my husband and I. After having my son mornings get a little bit hectic, so prepping this ahead of time and freezing what we aren't ready to use is a great time saver

This casserole was great! The only thing different I did was add celery and bell pepper along with the onion. I also added sausage with the bacon. Everything else I followed.  My co-workers loved it. It is great the next day also!  I will definitely keep this one and make it again.

Yes I made changes. No I would not make it again. I used Chirizo. It was much more time consuming than anticipated to make. It does not come out looking like the picture shown at all. I needed to serve it with catchup for necessary added moisture and flavor. It was rather plain in flavor.

It doesn't matter what you add to this.  Make it on Sunday and put it in the fridge.  My kids spooned it into tortilla shells all week with sour cream and salsa for a great, hot, easy breakfast!

To make it easy I used 2 bags of  Jimmy Dean's mix of crumbled sausage, and o'brien potatoes. Cooked ahead of time and froze then took on vacation. Added the remaining ingredients and fed 8 happy family members.  Great leftovers.

I'm not sure what the proper rating for this should be. Sure it is tasty, and I could go 5 stars on taste. But it so much more time intensive than it needs to be, in my opinion. My first piece of advice is to follow the given suggestion and prepare it in advance so that you can eat sooner.  I had big potatoes and 30 minutes at 350 was not long enough, and I only needed 3 of the 6 to fill my baking dish. I probably should have known to adjust down, but no worries as there are tons of ways to use the leftover potatoes. I'm wondering if all the baking then peeling, chopping, frying is really necessary. A bag of frozen chopped or shredded potatoes that were thawed and skillet fried with the onion would have been much easier. You might lose a bit of tastiness but I may have been okay with that to save time and effort. Just a thought. But the recipe concept is sound, and of course you can personalize it by adding different items. But it is very good as written.

I used new potatoes and diced them up into small cubes. I boiled them in salted water for 15-20 minutes just until tender.  I added a few extra spices like sage and parsley, also added garlic and onion powder to sausage as it cooked.  I used maple flavored  breakfast sausage, this gave it a nice little perk. I mixed the cheese into the casserole to meld flavors better  (used Colby -Jack as it's what I had on had.)  All my family loved it . I will definitely make again

This was just ok - potatoes took up alot of time.  If I make it again, I'll use hot pork sausage to give it a boost.  Would also add onions and use frozen potatoes.

Nice recipe but a little bland once past the cheese layer on top. If we try it again, we will add more seasonings and maybe sprinkle the cheese, layer by layer, as opposed to just on top.

I made this vegetarian. Added mushrooms, peppers and turmeric. And topped it off with a bit of sour cream. I also blanched the potatoes first or they end up being too hard.

The flavor was good, but the photo shows a green vegetable in the eggy casserole which I was looking for.  Obviously, upon reading the recipe, I concluded that this was either not a photo of this recipe, or the person who authored the recipe made a mistake.  I added spinach and it was good, but I wish the photos of the recipes actually reflected the recipe.

Question:  The photo shows something green in the casserole...I don't see anything in ingredients that would add this color.....is it something someone added that isn't listed?  Looks like broccoli or green bell peppers.
I have not made it yet...but plan to sometime.  Just wondering.

The picture looks nothing like what I made. Where did all the green come from? I don't see anything green in the recipe. Very disappointed in the result. Still can't figure out why I have to basically cook a breakfast of sausage and hash browns, then put it all in a dish just to cook the eggs. This takes an additional half hour when I could have just cooked the eggs while the sausage and hash browns were cooking. There's nothing special about this recipe.

I've made this tons- it's a great base recipe! Use whatever veggies you have leftover (I like a little red and green pepper, onion, broccoli, etc for color, flavor and up the nutrition a bit) as well as leftover baked or boiled potatoes- I don't even peel them. I've also used diced ham instead of sausage, or cut up leftover breakfast sausage and leftover hash brown patties. Flavor it how you like as well- I sometimes throw in a little mustard when I do ham. I've made this in an 8" square pan for 4 at home, 13 x 9 for a potluck at work, or a large pan for 20 at summer camp (with thawed shredded hash browns or leftovers from baked potato bar lunch (potatoes, ham, broccoli) the day before. A great way to do eggs for a crowd and amp up the breakfast protein!

Definitely use frozen hash browns or O'Brien potatoes.  And it's fine to use Egg Beaters for  most of the eggs.  I've also made this without sausage, to serve to vegetarians.

2/10/2016, Great recipe.  I cooked 1/2 pound bacon and crushed it up and mixed them with the egg.  I also added some spinach to this recipe.  I used two red potatoes cut into small cubes.  I recommend this recipe.....

I made this without meat for Christmas breakfast since we had ham. I made one with peppers, onion, and garlic too. Both were a hit and will be be a standard in Christmas.

I made with hash browns instead of potatoes and prepare all the day before except the eggs. I refrigerate the night and in the morning add the eggs and bake.  So easy for Christmas morning.

My family enjoyed this. I took the others suggestion of using bacon grease to fry onion, bell pepper & frozen hash browns. The family liked it but I thought it was a little greasy.

Love it, I make it often for co-workers. I sometimes add a layer of steamed broccoli and cauliflower on top of the potato for my healthy friends. It was a huge hit. I love it both ways. :)

This dish was awesome. I'm stuck in China right now, so don't have access to the traditional American foods like hash browns. I did what the recipe said, without the seasoning salt, and it was delicious!Thanks so much!

ok here is my 2 cents.  I cooked 3 new potatoes in the microwave cut them up and browned them.  I had no onion so added onion powder garlic powder, red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning while frying potatoes.  Had no sausage so cut up what bacon I had and fried that.(about 6 slices.)  I added parsley and fresh basil to the eggs.  I also had a little chunk of mozzarella so added it with the cheddar.  Used no seasoning salt.  My husband said "you could sell this stuff"  Also I only had 7 eggs.  Was excellent!

Thanks for the recipe. I used thawed hashbrowns, sliced chicken sausage, added fried mushrooms and green onions to egg mixture, turned out great even though I didn't have seasoning salt( just salt and pepper instead). Easy peasy and delicious!

I made this when we had houseguests recently and it was a big hit. I, like some other reviewers, went easy on the potatoes.  I didn't have seasoning salt so I used a little salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic power.  Turned out wonderfully and leftovers were just as good.

Great breakfast casserole!  I used 6 very small potatoes - just enough to cover the bottom of the pan.  Will make this again.

The first time I made this dish I had a 10 people for breakfast...definitely an easy way to feed a crowd...prepared the night before and popped it into the oven for 2 hrs the next morning...I tripled the recipe and needed this much time for the eggs to cook...loved it! Was a big hit....will definitely make again.

Took this to a Father's Day breakfast at church, came home with a clean dish!  I made it the night before, and baked it the next morning for about 35-40 minutes until the eggs were set.  Used Country Style hashbrowns, egg beaters, and sausage.  Very tasty!  Will definitely add this one to my favorites!

My whole family loves this recipe.  Instead of pork sausage, I use bacon.  Also, when browning the potatoes I add Mrs. Dash Table blend to them.  I also add it to the egg mixture.  Makes this recipe twice as tasty.

Baking the potatoes definitely enhanced the taste, however there seemed to be too much potatoes.  It IS tasty, however!

I used 'Pototoes O'Brien' from the frozen food section, it comes in a 1 lb 12 oz package. Cooked the sausage first, transferred it to a bowl then cooked the potatoes along with some diced onions & green peppers I had on hand in the sausage grease. Did everything else as directed. I think the eggs could have used some milk added to them. We thought the potato layer came out a little dry but that was no fault of the recipe. I also would double the cheese if I had this again but that is a personal preference. This was good, thanks for the recipe.

Very simple to make with ingredients I had on hand.  I used sage flavored sausage and may add
chopped green chiles or hot sauce next time.
