I too have been looking for a better Jam Thumbprint recipe.  We have been making these cookies every Christmas now for over 20 years.  I was never completely satisfied with the taste or the look.  I hesitated when I saw the rating of two stars, but the other recipes were the ones I had already used at one time or another.  My daughter and I decided to give this a go and it is GREAT!!!  We sometimes will adjust but decided to follow this recipe to the letter and we loved it.  The dough held and formed wonderfully.  The true test was when friends and family took a bite and they didn't fall apart.
This recipe earns it's place as a true Classic Thumbprint Cookie recipe.

I have been looking for a good thumbprint cookie recipe for over a year. Unfortunately this is not it. It was hard to make the print big enough, the jam did not melt into the bowl but sat on top, and they crumbled when I went to take them off the cookie tray. The taste was only so-so. Therefore, I am still looking for that good recipe.

I made these b/c I was looking for a slightly different jelly thumb-print cookie and these came out perfectly!  They rolled well, the chopped nuts stayed on, and the jelly stayed in the finger-print well.   For those who experienced problems with the cookies falling apart after baking: try using a finger, rather than a thumb, and don't press too far down.

I'm not a cookie maker but I made these cookies and found them delicious. I'm wanted to use up my own freezer jam. I strained out the extra liquid and use it for the filling. That all worked great. Thanks.

The dough was crumbly and dry. There are other thumbprint recipes on this site that I like better.

I made these last Christmas and had the same trouble as the previous reviewer.  The  cookies crumbled being taken off the sheet, and the ones that were salvaged had a very dry taste.

this recipe was very easy to make but it lacks flavor-it tastes like flour - so make adjustments for flavor before you bake...

These are definately a keeper- make sure to recreate the thumbprint after the inital bake- they do tend to melt and flatten out a bit. really good with pear butter and raspberry jam-
