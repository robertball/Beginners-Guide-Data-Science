So good and yet so easy!  Left out the carrots because I didn't have any in the house. Makes  great sandwiches.  You could also use beef for this and it would be delicious!

Followed this recipe exactly.  It was very dry.  There may be too much beef broth in this recipe as it almost looked like a soup when done.  I won't be making this again.
