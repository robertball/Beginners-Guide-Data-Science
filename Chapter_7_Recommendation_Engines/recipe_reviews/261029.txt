This soup was amazing! I thickened the soup with 1 T of cornstarch before it got hot, and 1T of mustard powder. It was a hit with the grandkids!

I did half head of cauliflower half head of broccoli and one summer squash instead of 3 cups broccoli.  (I used the vegetables I had on had which were keto-riffic)  I placed the vegetables in my food processor and "riced them" before placing in my  crock pot.  I love this recipe - it is hearty and tasty and a great use of left over fresh veggies.  I also added left over cooked chicken to it for a protein boost one pot meal.

I had all the ingredients but the broccoli, so I did switch that for a cauliflower (1  large which was cut into florets and simmered until soft for 25 mins).    I omitted the bacon and used 1/2 milk 1/2 cream instead of the full heavy cream.  I   added the cream and milk in at the end, after pureeing the cauliflower.
I love soups, and this was comforting and filling.   Next time I would caramelize half an onion with the garlic.

Had to make changes. Chicken broth, 4 slices of bacon, extra garlic, and thickener (way too thin).

This was so good and so easy and quick to make!  I chopped up most of the broccoli and left the smaller pieces whole. I used 2 different cheese only because I was almost out of cheddar. I also used chicken bone broth instead of vegetable broth.  This will easily become one of those recipes that I make all the time, it's just so simple and tastes great!

I added an extra cup of broccoli and extra cheese to finish off what I had left of those and it came out delicious,  didn't need any pepper just a light sprinkling of sea salt.

Needed to use up a head of broccoli before it turned.  Nice quick and easy soup and was perfect for a cool fall day

Awesome, this is the second time making this recipe first was a bit thin. Increaced broccoli and cheese. Had sauteed onion with first as I did with this one. Cooked my bacon(saved for topping) in same soup pot removed and drained fat and continued with butter to onions and garlic. Though of deglaing with wine for flavor afraid with keto would be to thin although with increased (2nd try)cheeses which happened to be a mix of open packages and blocks cut up it is magic. Tops off to the cook!!!!!

Getting used to eating soups instead of 'real' meals...this is a great soup! I used already minced garlic and low sodium chicken bone broth. Really good! This freezes well.

I always thought I didn't like broccoli and cheese soup but this tasted great. I wanted to try it because of low carbs. I added carrots and celery for a little more seasoning and textures, chopped my broccoli in food processor.
