I didn't think this would really taste like gyros like other review, but to my surprise it really did!  Family loved it and requested it for a weekly dinner.  Instead of celery I used 1 tbsp of celery seed, omitted mushrooms.  I also added salt to sauce, and used Cavendar's greek seasoning liberally to meat.  Great recipe!!

This was very good! I don't think it tasted like a traditional gyro, but it was tasty. I did have to add some salt and pepper to the meat mixture. I omitted the celery, but did use the optional mushroons, which I thought were great in this. I actually think it could've used a little more spice, like it was missing something, but I can't put my finger on it. The Scottziki sauce was a little bland, but I ended up adding some salt, pepper, garlic powder and a little sour cream to fix that. All in all we enjoyed it and I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My family and I loved this recipe.  It tastes very close to the original gyro.  We didn't have red peppers, dill weed, or yogurt on hand and it was still great.  I think it will be even better when we make it again with all the ingredients.  I used sour cream instead of yogurt, added the cucumber and seasoned it with a little garlic salt. So, even if your short on ingredients you can still make it.

7-12-11: Pretty good, but the beef didn't get browned.
8-13-12:  This time, I cooked the beef first, then added then other stuff, with about the same results.
7-19-13: For the third time, not all that great.

This was okay, but it did not wow me. I used roasted red pepper (from a jar) instead of banana peppers, but I don't think it made much difference.  I used the mushrooms, a lot of Greek seasoning in the meat and added some onion to the yogurt, all for more flavor, but it still wasn't enough. Something is missing...
