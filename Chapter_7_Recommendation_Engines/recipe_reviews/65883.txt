I made this ham for our Christmas Eve dinner.  We had some friends over and everyone just loved it.  One of our friends doesn't even like ham and he loved it too.  I didn't change anything, but I did end up with quite a bit of glaze leftover, next time I'll just cut it in half. Thank you!

This ham is so good! It is very sweet but I think that is the best for ham. Using real maple syrup is the best and the glaze can be cut in 1/2. This is my favorite ham! It also tastes great frozen (leftovers!) with a little of the glaze on it.

I made this for Easter and really enjoyed it.  I used Kassler ham though and accidently put Golden Syrup in instead of Honey (similar bottle, I was in a rush) and it still tasted delicious.  Everyone commented how tasty it was. I will be doing this for Christmas this year.

very sweet, just how I like my ham glaze.  I didn't have any allspice, so we used 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, and my husband didn't know that there are both whole and ground cloves, so he put in whole cloves, because thats what he came across first in the pantry.  And it was still delicious.  I saved half of the glaze to serve with the meat, 5 strs all the way!!

It didn't work well on a pre-sliced ham.

pretty good but would prefer to leave out the spices as it left  the glaze a little gritty.

This was delicious!! I cut slices in my ham and then brushed the glaze in between the slices. My whole family loved it! The recipe does make a lot of glaze though. Almost 4 cups. The drippings made a wonderful gravy!!
