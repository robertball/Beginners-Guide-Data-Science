Fantastic and something different for a party besides onion dip. Also for low carbs company I cut up different colored bell peppers to be like scoops for the dip!

The only change I would make is half the whipped cream cheese. Other than that, get some crusty bread and dig in. Thanks McCormick

The family really liked this one. Took it to the next level and made sliders .  Perfect dip for get togethers or just watching a game. 
I did add 1/4  cup of water at the end when the cream cheese was melting, it seemed a little dry. Worked out beautifully.

Delicious! Tastes remarkably just like a cheeseburger. Forgot to buy pickles but that's ok I don't like em on my burgers anyway. Easy to make too. Served with slices of toasted French bread. I'd definitely bring this to a party, where I'm sure folks would rave!

Made this for the first and followed the recipe. It came out great. Husband loved it.
