I made it! And it was AMAZING! The only "twist" that I made was actually not using the slow cooker. It took me 1 hour to make this dish on my pressure cooker! So for those of you who own one and don't have the 8hrs luxury, go ahead and follow the instructions just place everything on your pressure cooker and let it do its job for and hour or hour and a half. The beef was so tender, shredded itself while cooking. Everybody at home loved it and it was great with tortillas, over potatoes, you name it. Great way to cook beef or pork. I cooked both and in my opinion pork tasted better with this recipe, although the beef was great too.

My family LOVED this roast. I made it just as written. (Except MAYBE added some extra garlic!) We ate it plain, ate it with pico and cheese on a soft taco shell, AND we had left overs so I made a pizza! BBQ sauce, pineapple, red onion, tomatoes and three kinds of cheese. AMAZING. None of this roast went to waste. For sure a keeper.

This was a GREAT dinner! My husband loved it. I made a Chipotle Aioli,Pico De Gallo and added Queso Fresco and served them on warm corn tortillas. Very good! I will be making these again!

These were quite tasty!  I took the Cook's Notes advice and skipped the ginger and jalapeno and instead used 2 T. Thai Chili Sauce.  I topped my taco with some shredded cheese, bagged coleslaw mix, chopped green onions and more Thai Chili Sauce, all wrapped in a small flour tortilla.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

OMG my family & I stuffed ourselves silly! I used the chili paste as suggested in the cooks notes. This is so easy too! My 9 year old was helping me, but could have easily done it on her own. I served it with Asian peanut coleslaw. YUMMY!

All family members wanted seconds-great hit! Didn't have dark so used light brown sugar but added a spoonful more. Added an extra tablespoon of rice vinegar as well. Meat was dry upon shredding but we put shredded meat in with the sauce from the slow cooker and it turned out perfect! My husband put cilantro and spicy kimchee on his soft taco while I preferred icebrerg lettuce. For a sauce, we made a mayo/siracha sauce we made (used about 1.5 tablespoons of siracha for 1/2 cup of mayo for just a little kick-this served for 8 tacos). Will become a household staple-plenty of meat to reuse too.

Delicious!  I used the same ingredients, but cooked it in a pressure cooker for 20 minutes.  Made rice and stir fried zucchini, onions and red bell peppers with sesame oil, salt and pepper to go with it as a side dishes instead of eating it as a taco.  So good!  Husband and I LOVED it.  Will try it taco style next time :)

Absolutely delicious.  I do a lot of cooking ahead on the weekend since we're so busy during the week and this is a gem that will be used over and over. 

The only change I made was adding a bit of beef stock to the crock pot just because it made me nervous not seeing any liquid in there.  I added maybe a cup or two and when the beef was done most of it was gone.  I just shredded the beef right in with it and it turned out great.  

We ate it on grilled flour tortillas to make tacos and topped them with shredded cabbage, cucumbers that we marinated in rice vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar), chopped peanuts, and a bit of sriracha.    My 3 year old ate hers on a tortilla with shredded cheese.    EVERYONE loved them.  Will definitely make again and again.  

Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and included the jalapeno pepper.  My boyfriend and I loved it!  I used broccoli slaw with the rice vinegar and soy sauce, and it added a great tangy crunch to the tacos.  Awesome recipe!  Will definitely make again.

Our family enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked it all day at 300F in the oven vice in a slow cooker.  A good Korean taste - dark, sweet and savory, with a little bit of spice.  We ate the meat straight instead of as tacos, and with a lot of veggies, plus white rice.  We are fans of bulgogi and Korean bbq...this wasn't exactly the same, but pretty good nonetheless.  Thank you!

Very good I must say however, I do not know where everyone is seeing the Cook's notes about using 2 T. Thai Chili paste instead of ginger and jalapeno...anyone know? lol

Delicious, I will definitely it make again!  I did it as Korean barbecue with layers of rice noodles, the beef, diced red pepper, zucchini, red cabbage, carrot shreds and topped with an over easy fried egg.

DO NOT USE A PRESSURE COOKER TO MAKE THIS. I read another review suggesting this and what I ended up with was a horrifying piece of shoe leather surrounded by burnt sugar sauce that took two days of soaking to remove from the bottom of my pressure cooker. Leaving a 5 star review bc the recipe prob would have been great if I had just dumped the whole thing in the crock pot

To avoid drying out the beef, I checked for doneness after four or five hours, and it was already fork-tender. I also added a heaping teaspoon of chili garlic sauce, and that seemed to give us the right amount of heat—no complaints from my 10-year-old.

I didn’t like this at all mainly because of the sweetness of the meat. Instead of just throwing it away, I tried to save it by cooking the shredded meat for awhile with taco seasoning. It ended up a little better but I ended up tossing it anyway.

This is always a favorite.  I omit the pepper because my kids won't eat spicy and it still tastes great.

Excellent finish. Did not read low for 10 hours and high for eight hours.  Took it out after low for 8 turned out brilliant.  I wanted to see if I could save the sauce for the tacos but remove the fat.  Was anyone able to this properly?   Thanks for contributing this masterpiece!

I liked it! Changes I made were to add two Tbs of Thai Garlic Chili Paste as others suggested and three Tbs Rice Vinegar as I  only had about a tablespoon of Rice Vinegar remaining in the bottle so I thought I might as well just throw it in.   I will make it again but will cut the Chili paste in half as it was a bit spicy for our tastes.

So easy and flavorful.  Followed the recipe almost exactly, using jalapeño, adjusted amounts only to account for a larger size roast.  It is a little on the sweet side, might use less sugar next time.  I served it with floppy corn tortillas and Asian toppings to choose from like shredded radicchio, radishes, cilantro, scallions, shredded carrots and sriracha sauce.

The seasonings all blended together nicely for an authentic Korean taste, and it was great to be able to easily make this in my Crock Pot.  We had this for several night's worth of soft tacos made with shredded cabbage, sour cream and cheese.

Update: When I made this a second time, I used flour soft tacos and Asian style slaw. This was a real hit with my family.

I used chicken, halved the garlic (chicken absorbs flavor better) skipped the jalapeños because hubby hates them and chicken halves the cooking time. It was seriously delicious!

Fantastic!  Substituted Apple Cider vinegar and it did the trick.  I recommend adding the diced jalapeno for the accurate level of spiciness.

I only had a 3 lb chuck roast, but after adding 3 cups of liquid it seemed to be swimming so I did not add the rest. Which may have significantly concentrated the flavors, but my family raved. They said I should have doubled it! Delicious and now in my regular rotation!

Loved this recipe and it was super simple to make. I made the sauce the night before so all I had to do the morning of was put the beef in the crock pot and cover it with the sauce.
I paired it with a come slaw mix from a bag (that came with a sweet and tangy dressing) and then lightly crisped up some corn tortillas. Delish!!

I did not include the jalapeño, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was such a tasty way to prepare beef. My picky 13 year old even said, "Please make this again, it was really good." I highly recommend this dish!

I omitted the jalapeno and substituted Vietnamese chili garlic sauce a little on the heavy side. Also went slightly heavier on the ginger. And man am I ever glad I did!!!! It was pure torture to smell it cooking counting down to dinnertime, but it was well worth the wait!!!!! DELUCIOUS!!!! I will be making it at least once a week. Thanks!!!!!

I took a different approach with this, cutting the roast into chunks before cooking. They turned out fork-tender. I served them with stir- fry vegetables and rice. This is absolutely delicious.

I added a little Chinese 5 spice powder, turned out great. Also, after Browning the meat, I used the vinegar to deglazed the pan, added the onions, chopped the garlic and added the brown sugar, cooked it down a bit then poured it over the meat in the crock pot.

Made this exactly as the recipe calls for. Topped the tacos off with Pico De Gallo, some shredded cheddar cheese, and instead of salsa we used chili sauce. Family and inlaws loved it. Will definitely make again.

Used bottled ginger and dried minced onion because I was out of fresh.  Only took 5-6 hours to cook, and that was a double batch.  Tried on flour tortillas as tacos, but I think I will serve over rice next time.  Will also add a little more spice.  Husband really liked it, I thought it was ok.

I don't think this needs to cook as long as indicated and there isn't enough liquid.  All the liquid completely dried up and the meat dried out.  I got home just in time to find everything burnt in the bottom of the crock pot.  Whatever meat was salvageable was very tasty.  I will make it again either adding more liquid or cooking less time.  I will not make this again when I am not at home to keep an eye on it!!

We really liked this Korean beef. I only used 3 cloves of garlics, 10 seemed like way too many. Also served over rice as the liquid made a great sauce.

Wow this smells amazing while cooking and tastes just as good! I made a double batch and froze half. This is so good it can be eaten on buns, soft shell tacos, on top of baked potatoes or alone. Just writing this review makes me want some! I can’t wait to try it with the peanut slaw another reviewer suggested!

We enjoyed it but I do recommend having some kimchi or cabbage salad to put on top. We put it over rice and put kimchi on top. Did not take the full 8 hours but I did have less meat in there. I used two onions and olive oil because I didn't have the other oil on hand. It is a pretty sweet dish I want to use  two jalapenos next time.

It was pretty good! I used chili oil instead of jalapeno because that's not super Korean.

Followed the directions exactly but I ended up with black pieces that while weren’t quite shoe leather, are certainly not so tasty or attractive. I also don’t think it has much flavor as the flavor is overwhelmed by the over-doneness. When it first started cooking in the crockpot it smelled delicious. But as the hours went by it just smelled “done.” I cooked it on high for 7 1/2 hrs. My husband and I will go ahead and eat it but we pretty much wasted $18 worth of beef chuck roast.

This was a great recipe.  I started using corn tortillas, but switched to flour as the corn would not hold together.  I also put allrecipes.com's simple kimchi salad with it.  Also I saw an Siracha Mayo in one of the other hints and that was great.  I added few slices of avocado.  The rest of my family used it on salads, pizza, and a sandwich.

This was delicious.  I did find it necessary to pour off the sauce and reduce it quite a bit before adding it back into the meat, but that was no trouble and also gave me a chance to skim off the fat.

This recipe is SO good!!!!!  My kids are Korean and they absolutely love it, and so do we.  We add a little kimchi to the tacos and it gives them the spice that some of us a like a little more than others in our family.

I made it as written but used the chili paste instead of ginger and jalapeno.  Nice change from the normal roast I make!  Topped it with broccoli slaw with soy sauce and rice vinegar.  This was good with rice and as tacos.

Wonderful recipe and fairly easy! I would double this recipe if it’s for a crowd of 5+ and half the jalapeño since it came out a bit spicier than I can handle. After 8 hours on high, the meat genuinely fell apart with minimal effort.

This has become a staple in our house. So YUMMY! I've had to modify a few times because I didn't have something, and it was still delish. Have served as tacos and also over rice with sautéed veggies. Always fantabulous!

Omg. This is my new favorite thing. I made this as is except for the onions (no one will eat them but me).  It couldn’t have been easier, and I had just about everything in the pantry. I made a taco bar with julienned carrots, chopped cabbage from a bag of cole slaw, cilantro, sliced jalapeños, and kimchi. The salty, crunchy, and tangy kimchi balances so well with the sweet and spicy beef. I’ve made this a couple of times since finding the recipe.

This is soooo yummy!!!!  I put the jalapeno, ginger, and garlic in a food processor to get the pieces really small and added to the other sauce ingredients.   I cooked it in my pressure cooker for an hour and it shredded beautifully!  I have a very picky son and he devoured the tacos!  My husband said he would eat this every week!  Whohooo, thanks for the recipe!

Made it exactly as written and left out jalapeno that was listed as optional anyway.  Absolutely delicious.  Made it to serve as a taco filling.  Will definitely make it again.

I loved this recipe, easy and delicious. I am making it again today but instead trying it in the pressure cooker, not the slow cooker. Wish me luck!

My Filipino family LOVED this recipe. I was too lazy to shred it and cut the roast in pieces. Was great with steamed white rice! I will shred the leftovers in my processor tonight to try in the corn tortillas.

I made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  I used it in a lettuce wrap and it was just what I was looking for.  It had wonderful flavor with just a hint of sweetness.

Wonderful. Tender, juicy, flavorful beef, and just perfect with crunchy cole slaw topping.

Made this recipe just as it says.  Husband absolutely loved it and said as much as he loves pot roast he thinks he would rather have roast cooked this way from now on.  It was that good.  I found an Asian dressing recipe for slaw and used that on the cabbage which also added even more flavor.  This recipe was a hit.

We had two nights meals with this recipe.  Doubled the number of whole garlic cloves and added 2 Tablespoons hot garlic chili sauce. I really trimmed the fat to avoid too much grease, you do need to strain it or it can be too wet. The first night we made tacos. The second night we made sliders with toasted Hawaiian rolls, topped with crushed peanuts, thin sliced cucumbers, green onion carrots and cabbage. Huge hit! And very easy. We let our guests build their own. Don’t butter the rolls just slice the entire dozen in half, open up and broil until they brown. Watch closely they cook quickly.

We subbed chicken for the beef and it was amazing. Cooked it on high for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, took out the chicken & shredded it, put it back in for 30 minutes to 1 hour on low. PERFECT! We didn't want tacos so we paired it with rice.

Family loved it. Husband cannot eat garlic so rested meat on top to obtain flavor, which worked out well. It is not a lot of liquid at the end which makes the meat flaky, but you have to add the cooking juices back for moisture and full flavor. I suggest separating the liquid first, to draw out the fat before mixing it back to reduce any greasiness. Really yummy!

My review:  so-so.  I only used 5 garlic cloves (used whole, not chopped up) and I didn't use sesame oil, as I didn't have any and it didn't seem necessary to be in the recipe.  And I don't like jalapenos so didn't use them.  In my crockpot, I used the 6 hours on high setting.  It was done in 5 1/2 hours (or maybe sooner, but I didn't check until 5 1/2 hours).  We used the meat for tacos, but I wasn't thrilled.  It just didn't seem right to have slightly sweet meat in a taco!  We'll try the leftovers with rice tonight.  By the way, some reviewers said their meat was dried out.  Mine had plenty of liquid!

Flavor was very mild. I seem to have overcooked mine a bit. Disappointing that the liquid never came together to make a sauce or glaze, the sesame oil was very visible on the meat. Was an ok dish but wasn’t a huge fan.

I was searching for a recipe to use stew beef and came across this. Since I wasn't prepared to make tacos I served it over mashed potatoes. Other than that I made it as per the directions and added the garlic chili paste as well. I put all the ingredients together and let it marinate overnight. It turned out well. The meat was tender, not dry, and so flavourful. I can't wait to try the taco form.

Excellent flavor. My family loves to eat this over jasmine rice, so I usually add a can of beef broth and a little corn starch to thicken it up as a topping.

As recommended, I swapped the jalapeno and ginger for Thai chili sauce. I also got a better cut of meat. Served with shredded cabbage and carrots on tortillas. A bit more Thai chili sauce to top it off, and this was fantastic! I will definitely make this again!

This was SO GOOD. It was fun to make, made my house smell delicious, and everyone loved it. It made enough for my family of 4 (two of them are teenaged boys) to have for two different meals. It was so good that they didn't even mind eating it twice. I left out the jalapeno, but that was my only change.

This was so easy and a new favorite in our house. It was made pretty much as written, next time I will add a little extra garlic,ginger, and heat. The coleslaw mix as a topping was good but will look for the kimchi for the next time

The flavor of this recipe is outstanding! The ingredients are inexpensive and easy to find. The recipe was easy to follow, with preparation time taking only about 15 minutes.

We used a 2 lb roast and over-cooked it slightly. It was still delicious, but there was a few tough pieces. So, if you adjust the cut or size of your roast, keep an eye on it in the last few hours.

I followed the recipe exact for the beef and coke slaw. The only thing I added was to spread a little hoisin sauce on the warm corn tortilla.  This added a nice flavor to finish it off.  Definitely will be a family favorite meal!

Super easy and so flavourful. I swapped crushed red pepper for the jalapenos and just finely chopped the ginger - skin and all. Turned out amazing. For my first batch, I truly cleared out the frozen beef we had on hand, for the next round we'll probably go buy some specifically for this recipe.

Whenever I make this for lunches, people at work get curious (smells amazing) and then jealous. It's delicious! I make the meat pretty much exactly as the recipe says, serve it over rice and it gets the two of us 5 full lunch portions each for the week. I also often will put a bit of greens, dry cole slaw mix or other salad greens in each lunch portion. All mixed together it's yummy!

Very good and at low did not dry out.  It took less time though, more like 7 hours on low.

This meat makes amazing Korean tacos! I heated some corn tortillas and filled them with this meat, finely chopped cabbage kimchi, cilantro and onions - it was amazing!!

Excellent recipe. Admittedly, I used pork instead of beef b/c I went to my local coop (organic store) & the beef was too pricey. Was still delicious albeit bit fattier than it was supposed to be. Even better 2nd & 3rd day. Served on corn tortillas topped w/ kimchi & sriracha.

This was so good, we had 3 meals from this recipe; soft tacos,  stir fry rice and  the last of the beef went in to ramen   with veggies for lunch. Used a 3.4lb chuck roast.
We upped the garlic to 15 cloves, and added 2T sweet Chili sauce, decreased the brown sugar because we didn't have enough for the recipe..

Korean food (beef dishes especially) is consistently made with sugar so those new to this cuisine need to take that into consideration  (or REDUCE the amount of sugar). If unfamiliar with Korean flavors I'd recommend visiting a Korean Restaurant FIRST. By sampling a few dishes first  you'll know whether you like the Korean 'sweet meat' dishes before attempting it's cuisine untried or tasted.

Not sure why the flavor didn't really get into the meat.  Just tasted like flavorless cooked meat, which is odd considering the amount of flavorful ingredients added to this pot.

Cooking it just like the recipe and turned out great. Ate it with a cold “slaw” of green onions, julienned carrots and cucumber seasoned with sesame seed oil, apple cider vinegar, and a tiny bit of soy sauce.

Absolutely a hit!  I left out the ginger but I used the jalapeño, 2 tbls of Gochujang and a can of beef consomme as that is what I used to deglaze my pot after searing the roast.  We ate as lettuce wraps with coleslaw mix for crunch and also mixed it with white rice.

It came out great. I used a large 5 lb round roast. Also used a large sweet vidalia onion and then left off the hot pepper since we were going to serve it to small children.  Served it with an Asian slaw and tortillas. Everyone enjoyed it!

This turned out pretty good. Added more onion (we love onion), substituted ground with fresh grated ginger, and we cooked in the oven opposed to crock pot. We also made the slaw that the notes had but we added a little sugar and some chili powder. Turned out pretty good. We will probably make it again.

These are amazing!
Made it in the instant pot: Cut roast into 4 pieces, salt and peppered and seared, sauted onions and garlic, mixed sauce ingredients (used chile garlic sauce in place of jalapenos) + ~3/4 cup beef broth; pressure cook 60 min, 15 min natural release; shred and cooked down liquid. 
Made tacos w/homemade flour tortillas and topped with asian coleslaw recipe from this site.

Im not really a lazy cook, but i rarely have time to make a quality meal.   I work 12 hour days with a 40 minute one way commute, so a breezy recipe is a must.   This one didnt disappoint.   I threw the onions, garlic, ginger and Jalapeno in my mini chopper, i did the same thing with the brown sugar, soy, vinegar, and sesame oil (since my brown sugar was stiff).  I added sesame seeds, because why not.  Seered the roast with more soy and sesame oil, and poured the sauce and chopped ingredients over the top turned on the cooker and went to sleep.   Maybe took 15 minutes.    When i got to work people could smell this from 20 feet away.   It didnt turn out dry as some have mentioned.  I always seer my roasts to keep the moisture in.   Tasted great, but using the tortilla seemed weird.   Tomorrow ill have left overs with sticky rice.

Once a month a good friend of mine comes to spend the weekend.  I always try to make something for Friday night that is special or that we never had before.  This was my last Friday night dinner and it was a hit.  My daughter was here as well.  We all loved it.

I have made this about 3 times.  I use pork roast instead of beef.  Also I serve this over rice and make some oriental veggies.  This has a great flavor. I use low sodium soy sauce.  I really like ginger so I add extra ginger as well.

This is delicious! My kids are on the picky side when it comes to trying new foods, and they loved it! I skipped the jalapeño pepper (only because of the picky kids lol) but stuck to the recipe otherwise. I also made slaw using packaged slaw mix, a little rice vinegar, a little sugar, and some sesame oil (I didn't measure it). So good and quick! It has become part of our regular rotation, thanks!!

This smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted great while eating! I need to figure out the right toppings for it. Maybe some sriracha?

Super yummy.  I’m doing whole30, so I used soy free soy sauce (found on amazon) and used no sugar and we love it. I put it over a baked potato with some other veggies and it made a great dinner. My son put it on a sandwich. It will be made again!

Easy to make. The recipe delivers exactly what it promises: Korean-style beef. Made the tacos with the beef, Store-bought chopped cabbage salad (Asian or Southwestern are both good) and home made salsa. Delicious. It seemed a little sweeter than the Korean beef dishes that we’re used to in Hawaii, but we liked it.

I made this to serve burrito style for dinner.  I made it according to the recipe. It turned out to be very good . Next time I think I will add some more spice (more jalepenos or other hot pepper) as I thought it was too mild.

This is a great recipe!  I served with corn tortillas as suggested and I topped with cucumber, cilantro and Sriracha.  Grrreat!  I had wanted to top with a Korean style quick vegetable pickles (carrots, cucumbers, radish) but was feeling lazy and went with straight cucumbers.  May have turned out for the better but will try it next time to confirm.

I cooked exactly as per the recipe and then had to order in pizza.  My family and I really did not enjoy this!! I seem to be able to cook with pots and pans but the slow cooker always seems to disappoint.  Maybe I have a dud slow cooker but I can’t give this recipe a good review. The beef was very tender, but the flavor (and after taste) just weren’t pleasant.

We loved the recipe. I skipped the ginger though. it was so savory and my husband and kids loved it too! or was barely enough for 5 hungry people so next time I need to double the recipe. Also we ate it over rice as more of as filler. Thank you for sharing!

I made this for a casual dinner party and it was a hit!  Several people asked for the recipe.  I used a pinch of chili flakes instead of the jalapeno pepper.

I'm changing this to 5 stars because I made it again and I really loved the flavor...so did everyone else.  This meal is a huge hit with my family.

Will definitely make this again. Even picky daughter loved it.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of dry ginger in place of real ginger, as I am not a huge fan of the taste.  I also omitted pepper and added 1 Tbsp. of Thai chili paste.  Otherwise, I followed recipe. Very yummy!!

Used 3.5 lb roast and extra onion. Could use a second jalapeño. 4lb roast would make enough for 3 big dinners for us 3. Served on corn tortillas with broccoli slaw, sour cream, peanuts, hot sauce and rice on the side.

This was a huge hit!  I left out the jalapeños and corn tortillas and scaled it down for two.  This recipe is so good and so easy!  I will definitely be making it again.  It is also good the next day for leftovers.

This was a big hit with everyone.  I didn't have any sesame oil on hand so instead I used some garlic olive oil and about a 1/2 teaspoon of sesame seeds.  I skipped the jalapeno pepper too since I didn't have one but next time I'll try it with the pepper.  I tossed everything into the crock pot and it came out perfectly.  I served the beef on flour tortillas with some avocado slices and sour cream with a cilantro-lime coleslaw on the side.  Perfect!

Excellent! Didn't want to lose any flavor so after shredding the beef I defatted the cooking juice, put it in a skillet and simmered until it reduced by about 2/3, then added back to the beef. Rave reviews!!

The only change I made was that I used a large pork roast instead and doubled the recipe.  It is outstanding!

Surprisingly good!  I expected it to very spicy, but it was just right.  The reason I'm subtracting 1 star- it was very watery/juicy, so it wouldn't have made a good taco.  We opted to serve it over rice instead.

My family loved it...even my dad who never likes to try something new. I used Fresco Queso, cilantro, and lettuce.

Wow!  I followed the recipe exactly (only omitting the jalapenos).  It was wonderful!  My family gobbled it up, singing my praises in between bites.

Yummers! Only change was to sub a couple of tablespoons of ground fresh chili paste for the jalapeno. Served on whole wheat tortillas with cabbage mixed with Asian salad dressing.

A nice flavor with a great texture for tacos.  3/4 kg roast is enough for about 12 tacos.

I thought this was very good.  On the sweet side but I liked it (I couldn't read the cooks notes on my phone to make changes to the heat,  but also have a toddler so I didn't want to make it to spicy.).  I substituted a poblano pepper for the jalapeño and used 1/2tsp dried ginger (I would increase that next time). I cooked on high for 6.5 hours ( 2.75 lb beef roast ). I made pickled onions,  peppers and cucumbers for the topping, but my husband and toddler ate it with cheese like a taco. I might try leftovers over rice.  Hope it freezes well.
