This is a fantastic recipe for chocolate lovers.  I made this three different ways over the past holidays and here are my suggestions. I tried Baker’s, Nestle and Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate. My guests preferred the Nestle brand the best. Just as good as Ghirardelli but at half the price.  For you mint lovers, for one cake I added ¾ tsp. of mint extract to the mix. Very nice and subtle result. The other reviewer advice I tried and agree with includes:  Eliminate 3 egg yolks and use 3 eggs and 3 egg whites; Use parchment paper in bottom of spring form pan. I sprayed the parchment and sides of the pan with PAM; Use a lot of heavy duty foil to seal the pan and keep the water bath out. By the third try, it was totally dry; Use Grand Marnier instead of the water. It’s pricey, but what the heck; Use a long very thin blade knife to cut the cake. Run it under hot water before each cut. This eliminated sticking. I made a raspberry sauce that I served on the plate but also put a small dab of whipped cream on each piece. “Nuked” each piece for 15 seconds before adding the cream and raspberry sauce.

This was wonderful.. the second time around. This may sound a bit moronic.. but the wording threw us the first time. We used 18 squares of chocolate, instead of 18 ozs. Ended up laughing about it, taking a picture and calling it " Chocolate Passover Quiche 2005". Personally.. I would take out the (1 ounce) and just say " 18 ozs.

Wow! Definitely going in the mainstay - tried and true - file of my recipe book.     I'm a personal chef/caterer and last night I catered for a group of very well known classical musicians - beef tenderloin, fresh herb roasted vegetables and new potatoes, field green  salad, vermouth roasted shad, prosciutto pesto palmiers, macaroons, and this flourless chocolate cake. I had several marriage proposals, was approached in the kitchen for more of this cake, and was personally brought out and given a toast for the meal (but really the cake).  Are you sold? Follow the recipe exactly! I usually change things around - but there is NO NEED TO CHANGE A THING.  I used ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips (about a bag and 1/2 of 11.5 oz bags).  I wrapped my cake pan in foil for the water bath because I used a cheap spring form pan.  Amazingly, the cooking times and everything are perfect. DON'T CHANGE.  And a big thanks to Maggie. oh yeah - served with whipped cream (heavy whipping cream and a little powdered sugar) and fresh strawberries.

Great!  I just got back from an office party where I made this for my boss, as she is allergic to wheat.  Every single person out of 10 people ate both the cake and the ice cream I served with it!  Like others have said, a little goes a long way.

Things I didn't bother with: 
1) the water bath
2) the wax paper
3) the dunking the bottom in hot water before serving

These didn't make any difference at all. It still came out perfect.  I simply unsnapped the springform lock and voila, ready to cut.

Things I did do:
1) Followed others' suggestions of one bag of chocolate chips and 4 squares unsweet chocolate
2) Used a springform 10.5 inch pan sprayed with Pam.
3) Served it with vanilla ice cream
4) Served it at room temperature  

It absolutely needed something like the ice cream to go with it.  I wished I had fresh whipped cream, it would have been better maybe.  But as it is, this recipe comes out like the moistest, richest brownie you've ever had.  So between the "brownie" and the ice cream, no one could refuse!  I don't think it would be good just by itself, as it needs the vanilla or cream to offset the richness so you're not overloaded with chocolate taste.  I don't think the caramel drizzle others have suggested would be good, as it is extremely sweet already.  Your call.  Enjoy!

This should not be considered just an alternate for those who can't handle gluten!  This is a spectacular, elegant, high end finish to the best of the best meals. You can delight SO many as you needn't(shouldn't) slice hearty portions. I used semisweet chocolate chips, and it was VERY GOOD, just cut back a bit on the sugar.A dusting of powdered sugar fresh raspberries and a sweetened sour cream garnish bring it up another level. Could CAUSE a celebration if there isn't one!

Rich and delicious. I baked it it in small ramekins that were greased and dusted with cocoa powder. Cooking time was decreased by about 15 minutes.  I poured blackberry sauce over the top and ate them straight from the ramekins. My guests couldn't finish theirs so I might make them even smaller next time.

People will think you spent hours making this wonderful dessert yet it's so easy. The only change I made was using fresh brewed espresso instead of water. It tasted like pudding when it was warm & like a truffle torte when it was cold. WOW!!!!!

Excellent flavor ! Tastes like a rich truffle cheesecake. Best when made the day before and chilled. Here are the changes I made to the recipe 1)Reduced the butter by 2 tbsp 2) Used 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites 3) Used strong brewed coffee instead of the water 4) Used 12 ozs of Ghiradelli bittersweet (60% cocoa) chips and 6 ozs of Ghiradelli semisweet chips (but did not change the amount of sugar that the recipe asks for) 5) added vanilla essence. I used a 9" round non-stick cake pan, and sprayed lots of Bake-Ease non-stick spray before I poured the batter in. I baked it at 300 F for 50 minutes, in a water bath. I allowed it to cool to room temperature on counter, and then flipped in onto a tray. I had no problems with the cake sticking to the pan, and I think this was because I used a non-stick pan. Decorated the cake with strawberry syrup (made from microwaved strawberry preserves), fresh cut strawberries and powdered sugar. I chilled this cake in the fridge for a whole day before I served it. Got rave reviews on it - "Wow, this is better than what you get in top quality restaurants", "Tastes exactly like a truffle", "Absolutely delicious when eaten with the strawberries". This is a rich cake (richer when you increase the proportion of bittersweet chocolate or coffee) that you need to serve with something fruity (like berries) to complement the taste. On the whole very impressive and tasty and not at all time consuming. Will make again many times ! :)

This cake was to die for.  Everyone thought it was so rich and incredible!  I think next time I will add 1/4 c. more sugar.  Thank you so much!  This is a keeper and so perfect for any special occasion.  The texture is amazing!

Did I do something wrong?? My cake was grainy and lacked that smooth truffle-like texture. It also had a noticable fat layer at the bottom from the butter - ewwwww!
I used a silicone cake pan with good results, as far as being able to remove the cake without a lot of the hassle of all those foil layers.

This cake is excellent.  We had a flourless cake on the Royal Caribbean's Enchantment of the Seas cruise.  This cake tastes just like their recipe!

This cake was really, really good! It is very chocolaty and SUPER rich, so don't cut yourself a big slice, you will never be able to finish it. The texture is along the lines of a chocolate truffle. I served it to my husband and a couple of our friends and they all said it was excellent. I was even asked for the recipe. I only made one minor change to the recipe itself, which was using 18 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the bittersweet chocolate. I baked it in a spring form pan and didn't bother with the water bath. I also added the butter in all at once instead of one piece at a time. Make sure your butter is at room temperature before adding it to the melted chocolate. If it is cold the chocolate will seize. It is crucial to bake the cake a day before you plan to eat it. When it comes out of the oven the center is very jiggly and it needs plenty of time to set up in the fridge before serving.

Made this for my GF daughter and son. It is a very rich dessert, very chocolatey. Some suggestions for those who said it had an eggy taste. You must incorporate the eggs well and I temper the eggs so that they don't scramble. What I do is to add a little of the warm sugar water to the eggs so they don't scramble. Then I fold in already beaten egg whites whipped to soft peak stage. Bake in a spring form pan greased well and line the bottom with greased parchment paper. Cover the outside bottom and up the sides of the pan with foil. You do not have to rest the pan in water. You can add a pan of boiling water on the bottom of the oven. Bake just till done and wiggly in the center. This will achieve the most perfect result for creaminess. DO NOT cook till set as the torte will be very dry. Cool on counter top and then refrigerate overnight. I have made this using bittersweet, semisweet, and milk chocolate. My family's consensus was that the combo of semi and milk tasted the best as it was a little less intense of a chocolate flavor. I have also made this torte sugar-free by substituting Splenda for the sugar. The flavor combinations are endless....any liquor you want, any extract you might like too!! If you don't have chocolate chips or chocolate squares, this can be made with cocoa powder. The texture will be different. It will be less fudge-like and more cakey but still delicious!! If you love chocolate, this is the dessert for you!!! It is basically a fool-proof dessert!

I lost the recipe for flourless chocolate cake I'd used before, so I made this. The flavor is great - I drizzled with a raspberry sauce. However, even following the directions exactly, I still ended up with some tiny bits of cooked egg, which ruins the silky texture. My other recipe had you temper the chocolate mixture with the egg mixture to avoid this.

I have made this "cake" several times and it always gets rave reviews.  I would suggest you ALWAYS use a spring form pan and this prevents having to fight to get it out of the pan.  Hold a large knife under running hot water and it cuts like a dream.  I like using a good Ghirardelli bitter-sweet chocolate and the chips melt easiest.  I use a double boiler because you can easily burn chocolate in the microwave!  I also substitute the sugar with Splenda and believe me you cannot tell the difference!  Try using 1/2 cup of Grand Marnier instead of the water and add a 3oz. bag of coarsely chopped dried Bing Cherries.  
Throw them in to the wet mixture when melting the sugar/Splenda..........to die for!
A dollop of unsweetened whipped cream is a must!I'm melting chocolate to make another one as we speak!

This was so good and easy recipe.  I made it 3 times already. 1st time I baked it for about 55mins as it didn't look cook when I checked at 45mins, but it was a bit over cooked.  2nd time I baked it for 45min(as directed) and it turned out better, so don't change the time. 3rd time, I add some coffee to the water but couldn't really taste the coffee flavour after baked for some reason. and I use mini cupcake muffin cups to bake them it the 3rd time and it turned out nice, only baked it for about 25mins though.  It made about 4 dozen mini chocolate cups. great for pot-lucks.  but my husband thinks, it looks better in a cake form though.  all 3 times, I didn't bake it in any water.  turned out fine. but curious to find out how the difference is if I did bake it in water.  Maybe on my 4th time....very soon.

My husband made this as my birthday cake and it was out of this world delicious. He followed a few of the reviews and replaced the water with liqueur (we used a raspberry one since we knew we wanted raspberry syrup too). He used 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites as per one review. To make the topping, we used frozen raspberries, defrosted, and simply blended them along with enough liqueur to make them fluid. Served on plates drizzled with the raspberry topping and whipped cream. Yum!

This really is better than any other flourless chocolate torte from any fine restaurant (and believe me, I've tried quite a few!).  I think most of the poor reviews must be from people who don't know what to expect - definitely NOT a cake like texture, or even fudge or cheesecake like.  And yes, it is very rich, and should be served cut in the smallest slice you can manage, and savored in small mouthfuls.  It has a wonderful, dry but silky texture which will literally melt in your mouth.  Also, any chocolate lovers will thank you for NOT adding anything that will ruin that texture - nuts, granola, sauces with seeds, etc.  I did not have a 10" pan, so I scaled the recipe to 10 servings so it would fit into my 8" pan.  The scaling resulted in 3 and 3/4 eggs, which I interpreted as 3 whole eggs, and 1 egg white.  I also reduced my baking time to 38 minutes since I had a smaller cake.  I was a bit impatient after I took it out of the fridge, and tried to slice it right away, resulting a some crumbling - it was much better when I waited 30 minutes, and also used the tip about running the knife under hot water in between slices.  Thanks Maggie - my daughter (who also is a chocolate lover) said that we no longer need to order the expensive torte from the gourmet chocolate store!

I've made this three times this month for birthdays - they keep requesting it again!
I've done it in custard cups, well wrapped springform and a 9" cake pan - each time in a water bath.  The springform wasn't worth it - the others worked great.  The custard cups required less time of course but I cut the recipe to serve 8.  Don't forget to use BOILING WATER in your water bath or your timing will be a good 15 minutes longer.
Also - I used dark belgian chocolate instead of bittersweet twice and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup - STILL perfect!
Covered the cake with same dark belgian chocolate substitution, cream and butter (Ganache II recipe on this site) and served with lightly sweetened fresh whipped cream.
This one is in my permanent collection-
Thanks Maggie!

Following the directions carefully are important to your results in this recipe.  Your cake should not be crumbly or dry on top.  The water bath moderates the cooking of the egg custard so you end up with something more like creamy fudge with a nice, dense firmness.  Fresh fruit takes the edge off of the richness.  As others have said, use good chocolate.  It's worth it when you watch your guests eat this with their eyes closed!

AMAZING! Best dessert I've ever made. My new favorite and so easy to make. I made mini ones in a muffin pan. I cooked them for 35 minutes and they turned out perfect. AWESOME! Also, I used a combo of dark and milk chocolate. The dark chocolate gave it a much darker look and taste which was so tasty. This is a really rich dessert no matter which you use, definitely a special occasion cake:)

Fabulous!  Rich, dense and easy to make.  Being a very forgiving cake, you don't have to be afraid to play with the sugar/chocolate ratio.  I only had an 8-inch cake pan, so couldn't use all the batter, but filled the pan to the brim since the cake doesn't rise, and it turned out fine.  I have also made it with semi-sweet chips (1/2 cup sugar) with great success.

I used 18 oz semi sweet nestle mini chocolate chips and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also served this with whipped cream and a strawberry sauce recipe found on this site.  Holy cow.....this tasted amazing.  My boyfriends eyes rolled into the back of his head on first bite!! I will be making this in a springform pan next time.  It's too hard getting this to drop out of a normal cake pan.

Dense, dark chocolate was soft and moist. 

An edit: Instead of water for the syrup, I used strong coffee with a tsp of vanilla extract. It didn't impart a coffee flavor to the cake, just enhanced the chocolatey taste. 

Because the cake is SO dark and rich, it really needs something creamy to serve with it, and some acid to cut the richness. I decided to top my cake with whipped cream and balsamic-macerated strawberries. 
(Toss cut, fresh strawberries with 1/3 cup of sugar and a healthy splash of balsamic vinegar. Allow to macerate for an hour. Pour 4oz of heavy cream in a stand mixer and whip until soft peaks form. Add macerated strawberries & their juices. Finish whipping cream until stiff peaks form. You can either spread the whipped topping over the cake itself & decorate with thin slivers of strawberry, or simply serve it on the side. Tasty either way)

Confused.  Do I use 18 squares (1 oz. each) of chocolate?  That sounds like a whole lot.

Fabulous dessert! Very rich and special, only a small slice will do for a satisfying treat. 

Whipped cream was my topping of choice. I would suggest to half the salt if you use salted butter. Berries would be lovely but not necessary. 

I did not cool overnight, I made it in the morning and put in the fridge asap and served for dinner. It was unbelievable! Do take it out of the oven at the suggested time, and ignore if it doesn't look done. Mine looked wet over the whole top, but it was done when it was cooled. 

My family raved over it, and agreed that it would be a treat whether gluten free diet or not! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

So easy, so fabulous! I used very strong coffee instead of the water and a combination of Lindt and Ghiradelli 60-70% bittersweet chocolate. I topped it with a very thin layer of ganache just to get a smooth silky finish. Garnished with fresh raspberries, a drizzle of raspberry sauce and a small dollop of whipped cream.

I made this cake for Christmas. My daughter-in-law is Gluten sensitive, but everyone loved it. The directions should include: Allow it to cool overnight in the pan but don't cool it too quickly. Allow it to cool gradually. Cooling too quickly causes it to contract and makes it more dense. It needs to be served in small portions with something like vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. We went with the ice cream and caramel syrup drizzle. It was unforgettable. Definitely going to make this again.

I made a great topping by using a can of bing cherries in syrup.  I put the can, juice and all in the food processor to make a syrup that I poured over.  Yum O.  Next time I'll probably only use about half the syrup in the can to make it a little thicker.  Can always add more juice if needed I guess.  This is a great recipe - very very rich.  I also used the springform pan and wrapped foil around the outside of the pan on the bottom and up the sides to keep water from the water bath out of the pan.  Put parchment on the bottom of the pan, but just buttered the sides.  I think the waterbath is very important - it keeps the temperature even so it will "set" correctly - just like when cooking a custard or creme brulee.  Also, don't get freaked out because it doesn't look done.  It will be tomorrow after it sits.  This is definitely a keeper.  I love it because 1) it's so good; 2) you can (actually must) make it a day in advance; and 3) you can do so many things with it - cherry/raspberry/caramel topping - serve with ice cream - serve with whipped cream - eat it straight out of the pan...  you get the picture.  It's dog gone good.

**UPDATE** This is SO good that my Dad and now stepmom asked me to make it as the centerpiece for the dessert table at their wedding! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe! This is a perfect dessert for a severe chocolate fix. I made it for a family gathering around Christmas time, and even my picky stepsisters still comment on how good it was! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. I didn't have a springform pan, but I would recommend using one.

I made this using concentrated fruit juice in place of the sugar (apple juice concentrate boiled down by half) and the cake turned out very well. It was fantastically chocolatey (use high quality chocolate, if you don't love the chocolate you use, you won't love the cake) and very moist. Maybe a little too moist for my taste- I'd have liked it to be a little chewier (which is why I'm giving 4 stars, not 5). It was almost cheesecake like in it's texture. The flavor is outstanding and it is very rich and decadent- like others said, cut the pieces small and maybe serve it with whipped cream and coffee to help cut the chocolate. It's worth the cost to make and I'm sure I'll make it many times in the future.

Also, while you can skip the water bath with this one, it will turn out better if you use it. The one I made in the water bath turned out level and shiny, while the one I didn't use the bath on raised up on the edges and cracked and looked dry. Both tasted fantastic, but the one with the bath was prettier.

This is an awesome dense rich cake.  A little goes a long way!  My only change - I used 10 oz semisweet and 8 oz unsweetened chocolate.

Fantastic recipe. I've made it 3 times so far, and it turned out amazing every time. Once, I added granola into the batter, and another time some walnuts and these additions made a world of difference. I serve it with fresh berries, but will try making a sauce today. I just wish it were lighter on the calories ;)

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I didn't change anything!  I have never made a cake like this, or a torte or a cheesecake for that matter.  I do have a spring form pan though, so I used that as my baking pan.  I wrapped the outside of the pan with aluminum foil so that the water bath wouldn't leak into the cake pan.  I also added a piece of parchment paper to the bottom of the pan and sprinkled it with powdered cocoa before pouring the batter into the pan.  I let the pan sit for 45 min in the oven before removing, to allow it time to settle and solidify.  I then let it finish cooling on the counter before covering to place in the frig.  (Condensation will cause a gooey top!)  I made this cake for a baby shower.  I used a piece of lace fabric layed over the top and sprinkled over the lace with powdered sugar to make a pretty lace design on the top.  I served the cake with ice cream, whipped topping, chocolate sauce and a cherry - it was a hit!  It has a consistency of cheesecake and melts in your mouth!

This cake is wonderful!  Dark, rich, fudgy and decadent, just as it should be.  In other words, if you make a *flourless* chocolate cake and expect it to have the texture of a layer cake, that's not a failing of the recipe.  That's just you not being bright enough to be trusted with hot things in the kitchen.

What a gigantic disappointment. I've made flourless chocolate cake before, and always use a springform pan, which is what I used here. The "cake" leaked out into the foil I wrapped around the pan and made a mess. Plus, I left the cake in the oven for almost an hour and it STILL never set up. I have some great-tasting chocolate pudding now, but no cake. Stick with the flourless torte recipe in the cake bible if you want one that won't disappoint.

Oh my. This is quite possibly the most decadent dessert I've made. Ever! This is the chocolate lover's dream. I couldn't find bittersweet chocolate (at least any that was affordable), so I used 16 oz. semi-sweet chocolate and 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate. This was just a treat for my husband and I, but when I make this for guests, I will probably spring for the good chocolate. I baked it in a 9" pan and increased the baking time 10 minutes to compensate. I lined the bottom of the cake pan with parchment paper, then sprayed all with cooking spray, and the cake popped right out after a dip in hot water. I served it with "Raspberry Sauce" from this site, fresh raspberries and a dollop of whipped cream. This is the perfect recipe to serve guests, whether they are gluten-intolerant or not!

Oh my God, this cake is TO DIE FOR. Instead of using all semisweet chocolate, I used half semisweet and half dark baker's chocolate. It was WONDERFUL, so rich and dense and moist! Just like the Flourless Chocolate Cake that I had at a fancy restaurant recently.   I also followed the advice and accompanied it with a nice glass of Port (as well as a side of ice cream); I had bought a tiny bottle before Christmas, as I had never tried Port before and boy was it a nice, warm treat. It went wonderfully with the cake, especially since it was a rich, dark chocolate cake and not too sweet. I also dusted the top with a little icing sugar (and had dusted the springform pan with cocoa as well, before baking). I didn't, however, use the bain marié (water bath), and it still turned out beautifully, with no noticeable cracks.

PURE CHOCOLATE HEAVEN!!!!! I used brewed coffee instead of the water, a bad of semisweet chips and a nestle 4oz bar of bittersweet. used large eggs. baked in my 9 inch springform pain for exactly 45 minutes, refrigerated for a few hours, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with real whipped cream and fresh raspberries. PURE CHOCOLATE HEAVEN! I'd give this 10 stars if I could!

My previous review is at this moment being revised. This is a stellar cake. I just did a couple things wrong. I came back to this recipe for the silky-smooth texture and rich flavor. My previous cake was a little on the thin side so I made some suggested changes this time and it was WORTH coming back to!  1.) As suggested I used 4 eggs and 2 egg whites. Still nice and rich, but gave the batter some height without adding too much density. 2.) I used 1 cup sugar and all bittersweet chocolate. I wanted that dark flavor but just a tad sweeter. 3.) I added 4 T. sifted cake flour at the end. Beat it in for 30 seconds on med-high.  4.) I wrapped the springform pan in foil to avoid water leakage(I suspect water leakage may have caused my cake to be thinner last time) 5.) I lined the bottom of my springform with parchment sprayed with PAM cooking spray. NOW it's the perfect cake. :)

OMG!!! This is the best chocolate cake ever! I LOVE chocolate and this cake is definitely for those who absolutely love chocolate. Before making this I read the reviews and got a bit worried about some sickeningly sweet taste this cake might have. But the result was awesomely surprising! The cake tasted just like a big, yummy, scrumptious truffle! Chilling this cake before serving is a must, it makes a huge difference in how the cake tastes and the texture of it. My husband said it tastes best the day after it is baked and I do agree. The first time I made it, I added whipped cream, as other reviews suggested. But after taking a bite, I realized that what I should have done was simply sprinkle cocoa powder on top, no glazing, no topping, no ice cream, nothing at all except cocoa powder. Making this the second time around, I just loved this cake: it tasted just like the truffles I usually buy at the store.  Another suggestion is to make the extra effort and bake this in a water bath, just like the recipe suggests. The cake does bake fine when you just stick the pan in the oven, but it does not raise uniformly and you end up with quite a messy looking cake. The water bath helps it bake more evenly. Other comments: I really did not notice a difference when making the cake with 6 eggs or 3 eggs and 3 whites. You will need 18 oz. of bittersweet chocolate (or a bit over 500 grams), do not get confused when reading the ingredients.

Initially I made this for a friend who is allergic to gluten, but it's a decadent dessert. It is so rich, one slice is enough. It's almost like a dark chocolate fudge. My co-workers loved it! I used 3 eggs and 3 egg whites instead of 6 eggs. I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips because Nestle Chips are exposed to wheat (bad for Gluten allergists). I added a buttercream frosting in small swirls on top and then topped the swirls with a mini Reese cup for a little something extra. Mine stuck to the pan and the dipping in boiling water trick didn't work. I would recommend putting parchment paper at the bottom of the pan for easier removal. Definitely would make this again!!!

This was terrific - for true chocolate lovers only! I've never made a flourless cake before but this was a snap. I used a 10-inch springform pan, lined the bottom with parchment paper, and then sprayed the pan with oil. I then used aluminum foil around the springform pan to keep the water bath from seeping in. I ended up baking it for 55 minutes. Served with raspberry puree, real whipped cream, and fresh raspberries, this got rave reviews at the office!

Definitely fudge, not cake. Good fudge, bad cake. I'll keep looking for a recipe.

Great recipe!! I am a pastry cook in a hotel where a cake similar to this is made and I can say this is far better than the one served there.  I used Chambord Liquor instead of water and semisweet chocolate (13oz) and unsweetened chocolate (5oz).

Wow, wow, wow!  Incredible, and so easy.  I used Lindt 70% chocolate, which made it an expensive cake, but worth every penny.  I followed another reviewer's suggesting to line the pan with parchment paper and had no trouble turning it out.  I took it to a big potluck event with a whole table full of desserts and it was the first thing to disappear.  I cut it into 32 slices and several people told me that they had a slice and didn't need any other dessert.

I have made this several times for my friends who are allergic to wheat, and they were in heaven!  Well, actually they hated me because they ate the whole cake in one sitting. I have made it for just about everyone in fact, and it is always a smash hit.  I serve it with whipped cream, pecans, and strawberries or kiwi - it is way to rich to eat by itself.

What a hassle... This cake was a lot of work for the less than impressive end result. I chilled it overnight & inverted it as instructed, and the first cut came out like a pile of dry earth, crumbly and messy. It tastes like a compressed brick of unsweetened cocoa. I followed all the directions exactly, and I was really disappointed. Wish I would have made an alternate dessert as a back-up!

Phenomenal. Have made this a few times and it has gotten rave reviews. I'm a beginner at cooking/baking and found this cake very easy to make (but it TASTED like it was REALLY difficult...what a great combo!). I used a springform pan wrapped in foil, as suggested in previous reviews/comments and it worked great. Was definitely glad that I could just unhinge the springform, rather than stress about getting it out of the cake pan without wrecking it. Served it with a rasperry swirl ice cream and it was perfect. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, it is a staple for all parties/dinner parties/etc from now on!

Unbelievable.  Everyone devoured this at a dinner party. I topped with "chocolate ganache" from this website to be extra decadent. I served with whipped cream and rasberry sauce (as recommended by another user).

While this "cake" tastes good, it was not what I was going for. I expected it to be a little more cake-like, but instead it's more like fudge. I guess I should have known based on the ingredients. So if you are going for something more like fudge and less like cake then you will like this recipe.

This recipe pulled me in with the 18 oz of chocolate it called for.  Oh how I love chocolate.  Oh how I had such high expectations for this cake.  And while I have rated it four stars, it was a bit disappointing.

First, why 4 stars.  Well, it cooked really well.  Conceptually, a flourless chocolate cake baked in a water bath could be a real disaster, and this definitely was not.  The directions were easy, it was easy to remove from the pan (which is not always the case with flourless cakes), and it definitely tasted very rich and chocolatey.

Now, why I was disappointed.  Because of the fact that it had SO much chocolate (and I should have thought of this), the texture and taste very much resembled a fabulous recipe I have for chocolate satin icing that has been refrigerated.  That is to say, it almosts tastes like a piece of chocolate rather than a cake or torte, and the texture is dense.  Now I know this is all the qualities you are supposed to like in a flourless chocolate cake, but it was just too much for my taste.  I would have liked it to be a bit lighter, and I think a recipe with less chocolate would be more to my liking.

As far as modifications I made that worked well:  I used a 9" deep cake pan, and it was fine (had trouble finding a 10" pan).  Also, I used a combination of Scharffenberger chocolates - the bittersweet (around 80%) and a few midway bars at about 60% and a few bars which gave it a rich flavor.

If ultra dense and superchocolatey is what you want, t

Gorgeous!
My chocoholic family LOVED this cake- covered with the Dark Chocolate Ganache from this site- and all were definitely impressed. **added notes: BE patient when adding the butter- it is key to make sure that the butter does not separate during baking. If you use a double boiler to melt the chocolate, make sure you dry all condensation from the bottom of the bowl/pot before tipping the chocolate into mixer. If any water gets into the chocolate before the butter, the chocolate will seize, and you will have an expensive mess! I used a 9 1/2 inch springform pan which worked beautifully, and as others suggested, put a silicon pan on lower rack with water as opposed to a traditional water bath. Cooked 1 hour, as the center did not seem to be set at the 45 minute mark. I also trimmed the top to flatten ( the center had sunk a bit) before inverting onto a rack.
Using a parchment paper circle in the bottom of the pan ensures easy, clean removal. Will make this again and again- and a hit with my Celiac husband who has not had cake for some time!
(And do cut small pieces- a little goes a long way!)

Oh, my! This is the second time I've prepared this 'cake' and it turns out perfectly every time! It really is an "upscale" dessert, not a cake at all...reminds me of a most decadent chocolate cheescake, as far as texture goes. Truly elegant for any occasion! I subsituted the water with Kahlua, and used equal amounts of dark and semi-sweet chocolate. I also make a raspberry sauce with seedless raspberry jam, thinned with Kirsch, and serve it drizzled over the slice. I use my 10" springform pan and line it with a parchment paper circle and pieces along the inside edge. I also wrap it in foil to prevent any water from the bath from seeping in.
You don't need a big piece of this dessert...a little goes a long way!
My kitchen smells like a chocolate shoppe! ;-)

OH MY GAWD... This is really really rich, really really good. I used part bittersweet part semi-sweet chocolate and omitted the sugar. I used about 1/2 cup butter too, so the mixture wasn't too greasy like the other reviewers said. Everything came out JUST NICE, minus the sugar and 1/2 cup butter calories. Everyone who has tasted it loved it.

It was good.  I think I'm looking for a flourless cake that is a bit less dense.  Also, I would prefer the chocolate to be somewhat sweeter - not so bitter - and I used half semi-sweet and half bitter!

I made this recipe for a holiday dinner.  It was wonderful!  I plan to bring it to a New Year's dinner party.  Most of the people attending are trying to adhere to a low carb diet....so this is perfect!  

Thank you for the scrumptious and decadent recipe!

This recipe came out absolutely delicious! I will be keeping it on hand for all future parties and gatherings where I am asked to bring some sort of dish. It is sure to WOW everyone there and make them think you are a professional baker!

I actually did not make a glaze to cover the top, but I did have a chocolate/fudge frosting on hand that I thinned out and spread over the top. It worked nicely. In the future I think I will make a raspberry or strawberry chocolate glaze with the actual fruits in it to add on top. 

My suggestions/recommendations for those who had trouble with this recipe:

1. The cake is supposed to be wet when it comes out of the oven. DO NOT bake it at a higher degree or for longer or it will be dry.
2. Freeze the cake in the freezer overnight. The fridge just did not get the cake hard enough and didn't congeal everything properly. ALSO, when you are done eating it, put it back in the freezer. It starts to melt a little bit like an ice cream cake. This will keep it firm.
3. Line the pan with parchment paper and cooking spray. It becomes fudgy and will be difficult to remove.
4. Chocolate/bakers squares can be expensive. I used kroger/store brand semi-sweet chocolate chips and it was delicious. I measured out 18 ounces in a measuring cup and couldn't tell there was a difference.
5. Make sure you boil water FIRST to put into the water bath pan. Also, make sure that you place the pan with batter into the water bath pan first before adding the water.

Enjoy!

Just made this recipe for the third time, and, as always, we LOVED it! This time though I used coconut oil in place of the butter due to my daughter's casein sensitivities. Was a little worried I'd ruin it but it was even better than I imagined! Not sure it it was the coconut or the type of chocolate I used but it was creamier/smoother than the other times I've made it. So amazing! There was a slight coconut taste but I used virgin coconut oil instead of refined. Using refined should eliminate that. It actually was a wonderful flavor combo anyway. Needless to say, my daughter devoured it and was very thankful for the tweak so she could enjoy it with us. I highly recommend this recipe for those who have allergies or know someone who does. It's an easy way to make someone feel special with this amazing recipe! Thanks for sharing it with us Maggie!

Awesome gluten free chocolate cake. I made this cake for family that was visiting. Changes:
- I used 70% dark chocolate
- 1 cup margarine (because it was all i had on hand)
- Instead of 6 eggs, I used 4 whole eggs (beat into the batter as the recipe indicates) and then whisked 2 egg whites and folded into the batter. No eggy taste to the cake.
- I lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and that made it very easy to remove the cake from the pan once baked. (Didn't have to soak the bottom in warm water)
- Instead of wrapping the pan and placing it in a water bath. I placed the cake in the oven and on a rack right beneath it, i filled a deep large baking sheet with boiling water.
- I also didn't cool over night, I just placed it in the fridge for 4 hours or so and served.

Great chocolate cake and like most of the previous reviews said, you can't really eat a lot of it so it will serve many people!

WOW!!! This was amazing.  
Because I'm on a health kick, I made it sugar free.  I used 18 ounces Sugar Free semi-sweet chocolate chips & splenda. It's amazingly good, yet still incredibly rich, so literally a bite or two does it- a small piece goes a long way!!
UPDATE: I've been sharing with friends, family & co-workers, many of which eat plenty of sugar and flour, all loved it and have begged for me to make again.

This recipe is great. I make this cake often and it always turns out perfectly. I do not add the butter one piece at a time nor the eggs and it doesn't make a difference. I sometimes substitute the chocolate for cocoa pwder when I do not have chocolate on hand. I like to top it with sweet whip cream and fresh berries. I also halve this recipe sometimes and use it as the base layer (still in a 10 inch pan) of a chocolate mousse cake. Looks like you spent hours making it, but in fact is verrryyy easy!

This was a little on the dark side for chocolate in my opinion.  It definitely needs a sauce to cut the intensity of chocolate flavor, but is a good recipe.  Next time I try this it will be with half semisweet and half bittersweet.  Also, be prepared to spend more money than the average cake.

EXCELLENT!! However I did make some changes (accidently) I used SEMI-SWEET chocolate chips instead of bittersweet, and I used 1/2 unsalted and 1/2 salted butter. It still was a great hit at work : )

Don't let the description fool you.  This is not just a gluten free cake that you "settle for".  I make it for very special occasions.  It is SO rich!  Very dense and very sweet, you only need a little.  I like it serve it with frozen rasberries.

Chilled over night was still very hard to cut into a slice. Very strong lemon and coke taste.

This cake was great! However, you may want to bake an extra 10 minutes and bake in a spring form pan.

I've tasted better and other flourless cakes recipes I've tried turned out to be cakes.  This was more gooey and I would possibly consider this like a torte?  At 5,280ft here in Denver I believe the baking temp and/or time needs adjustment.  The middle of my cake was just raw.  Tastes better cold than warm.

A great recipe that received many moans of enjoyment. I changed a few things. I used an 11.5 oz bag of gharidelli's bittersweet choc. chips and 6.5 ounces of the gharidellis semi-sweet choc. chips. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract as well. I also laid a small towel in the bottom of the larger pan and sat the 10 round on top of that. The towel helps prevent the pan from sliding.

My mother-in-law is 70 and gluten intolerant.  When I presented this cake on her birthday with raspberry sauce she said she plans to live a lot more years so she can keep enjoying this cake!  
I doubled the recipe and used Cherry Marnier instead of water.  Also I had dark chocolate Ghirardelli chocolate chips for the chocolate.  I decorated the cake with cherries and whipped cream.

Wow! Served to my book club where one member can't have gluten.  Everyone LOVED it!  It was easy to prepare w/ ingredients I had on hand.  I used a 10" springform pan, lined the bottom w/ parchment and greased the sides w/ butter and the cake popped out fine.  I covered w/ Hard Chocolate Glaze recipe from this site.  It was beautiful!  I will make again and again for special occasions ( not more than that cuz I'll get fat!)!

I wanted to try this cake, but did not have an occasion or someone to give it to, but did not want to make the whole thing. I cut the recipe to 1/3 and put in mini cupcakes (which made 2 dozen). They were so rich and good. I cannot wait to have an excuse to make it the regular way. I shared with a neighbor who already wants me to make more.

I made this, and while I'm sure it would have turned out well, something happened that I can't explain.  The eggs must have settled to the bottom during the cooking process and they scrambled at the bottom of the dish.  I used a different tin (not a cake pan) but I don't know if that had to do with that.  Very weird.  Good, the egg at the bottom was like a custard, but nonetheless, I don't know where it went wrong.

*Note: I used semi-sweet chocolate, I don't care for that bitter taste....
I have to say this is one of the best cakes I have ever tasted VERY RICH, but oh so good, I could only handle 4 fork full.... I made a layerd "Death by chocolate cake" for my husbands birthday party using these two recipes...  "Flourless Chocolate Cake I"  & "Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake", frosted with a thin layer of dark chocolate fudge, and crushed walnuts. I used 10" pans, and froze the baked cakes over night, I then sliced all the cakes in half, so I had 6 layers, then I placed a thin layer of frosting between each one... I sprinkled the nuts all over the top, and I swear I had 3 guests bow down to my feet... seriously. now everone wants me to make the cakes for celebrations.. haha!

Although the top of the cake came out very oily, after the cake was refridgerated, it was extremely dry.  If you would like to moisten the cake before serving, add butter and microwave for 45 seconds.  Makes a very good a la mode.

Made it dairy free (with earth balance) and GF. It was great. I used the 1/2 cup of grand marnier vs. water for a much richer taste. 6 full eggs. Covered the bottom of a springform pan with tin foil, but skipped the water bath and that was sufficient. Those of us who can have dairy loved it with fresh whipped cream.

This is just what Flourless Chocolate Cake should be! It  was outrageously popular with company! The first time I baked it in a 10" springform, parchment base, greased and dusted cocoa powder sides, with foil outside to protect from water. (Needed only abt 3/4" water) Mixed chocolates since I didn't have all bittersweet(4oz bittersweet, the rest semi chips). The microwave has been the easier way to melt the chocolate. 1 min on high and then check it every 15 sec or so until melted. I've made the recipe as written and also tried adding instant espresso crystals. I also tried cutting the recipe to 2/3 (12 oz of chocolate) and made  it in a smaller pan. It was easier to find a waterbath pan to go with my 8" that the 10". Putting parchment paper in the bottom of a regular pan meant I didn't need to warm it to get it to release. This recipe is worth the effort -- Creamy, Dense, Sumptuous! I'd give it 6+ stars if I could!!

Love the recipe! My first attempt at a flourless cake was a success. I made this for my friend's birthday & it was AMAZING! So rich and decadent... My changes: I used 3 eggs and 3 egg whites, per another reviewers suggestion and used a combo of bittersweet chocolate sqaures and semi-sweet chips, simply due to cost. I baked this cake in a 9" springform pan, so I let it cook 55 minutes without the waterbath and it was perfect! I served it with raspberries & Truwhip to cut the richness. This is definitely a special occasion cake! Everyone loved it! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I went to a little Bistro last night and ordered one of these, and it was great, and so today I decided to try to make it.  Oh. My. Gosh. It was like a party in my mouth.  It was so good I almost cried.  I followed the recipe exactly like it was, and holy cow.  That's all I can say.  Ho-ly Cow.

I thought this was delicious!  Made it for my bf's b-day, so I (gluten-free) could enjoy a b-day cake with him.  He also loved it thankfully!  Not being an experienced cook, I was a little intimidated by the cooking in a water bath, but it was easy.  The bf got it out of the pan no problem after the pan sat in warm water right out of the fridge.  I used 1 bag of semi-sweet and 1/2 bag milk chocolate and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Next time (oh there will be a next time!) I will try the suggestions of less egg yolk and whipping the egg whites. Served with vanilla ice cream and red raspberries.  So good! Thanks for a fantastic gluten free chocolate cake option!

This cake is outstanding. It tastes like the one I had at the Capital Grill in Troy, MI. I loved that I didn't have to separate the eggs. I did use both dark chocolate chips and some semisweet chocolate bars. It got rave reviews and will become a standard Passover favor.

This is so absolutely delicious and decadent.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, except I used a 10-inch springform pan wrapped in foil.  It tastes so rich.  I made sure my butter was at room temperature and I sat my eggs out to get close to room temperature as I made the cake.  Really, really worth the price of the ingredients!

I love this cake so much, I baked it for my own wedding. I have also baked it for several family birthdays and most recently for a raffle (it brought in over $100!!!). I use Trader Joe's 72% dark chocolate. Every bite tastes like a truffle.

Amazing! The center comes out like custard and you can spread it around a bit like icing. I left it to sit overnight and served it at room temp. Followed the directions exactly. Sifted powder sugar on top and added some fresh strawberries in the middle and strategically around the edges. Soooo good!

I have to make 100 flourless cupcakes for a New Year's Eve event. I decided on this recipe. I added two tablespoons of dark cocoa but other than that, followed the recipe. They are very, very good. My only complaint would be that they sink. I am covering them with ganache so it shouldn't make a different. Until they sank, they were beautiful!

A huge hit at Thanksgiving!  We have a new family member who has celiac disease and can't eat gluten so I made this for her, but I'd make this again just for me!  Very rich, very chocolatey.

VERY YUMMY! If you like chocolate, you have to make this! The only negative comment I have is t needed to be less buttery and im not quite sure how to do that without ruining the cake. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know. But seriously still a good cake. Worth Making!!!!!!!

Easy and decadent dessert!! It is also has a very low sugar and glycemic index effect. My husband is diabetic and I substitute splenda for sugar and its a perfect treat. This is a great dessert that you can serve at a holiday event. My hubby and the guest can eat the same thing - which is always a big score for me.

Great cake, thanks!  I found that if you beat the yolks and whites separately, then combine together before adding into the chocolate mix, it turns out MUCH better!  I add baking soda too.

Seriously good recipe that gets rave reviews.  It's very rich, so serving with cream, fruit or both will help out.  Use extra tin foil around your spring pan to help with leaking.  Tried serving warm and cold, and we all agreed that chilled was the way to go.  Will make this for parties in the future for sure.

This was awesome! My family loved it, and I'll definitely make it again! I couldn't find bittersweet chocolate squares, so I just used chips and melted them on low in the microwave--worked perfectly!

I also didn't have any unsalted butter on hand, so I just used salted butter and omitted the salt in the recipe. 

I don't have a springfoam pan and didn't want to bother with the foil-wrapping suggested by other reviews, so I just used a regular 8x8 pan inside a 9x13 water bath. I ended up baking it about 55 minutes. 

To make sure it didn't stick, I sprayed the pan, put down parchment paper and sprayed again. I dipped the pan in hot water before flipping it and it came out really easily! It probably would have come out fine without all of these steps, but I really wanted to make sure it worked after going through the trouble of making it.

To decorate the top I cut some thin strips of paper and arranged them randomly on the top of the cake, sprinkled powdered sugar, then removed the paper. It looked really neat! The powdered sugar did absorb into the cake after about 15 minutes, so next time I'll put it on more heavily.

I served this with whipped topping, vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce (frozen raspberries cooked down with sugar, water and cornstarch).

I'd like to try it again with different types of chocolate or adding some mint extract, but it was beautiful and delicious as it was!

We decided to try this recipe because we are on the South Beach Diet and wanted a dessert but we can't have white flour on the diet.

The ingredinets were cheap to buy and the cake was easy to make. We didn't have too much of a problem with it sticking to the pan at all. The cake is good, but other people wanting to make this should probably be aware that its more brownie-like or fudge-like in texture/taste than cake-like. Very good though and will definitely make it again.

I made this with sugar free dark choclate melting chips and splenda for my diabetic husband.  It is so rich and good!  I did use the 3 egg whites and 3 whole eggs version.  I am on the lookout for flourless sweets that I can share with some friends who are gluten intolerant and aalso that I can make sugar free, this is one I will gladly serve!  Thank you for the recipe and all those who gave thier opinions.

This was EXCELLENT!!! WOW!!! It's a dense chocolate torte. Not a cake. Don't think "cake" when you make this. It's a cross between fudge, brownies and a torte. It's fabulously rich and kind of melts in your mouth.

I put a package of chocolate chips in as well. Boy, was this good!!!

I try to save 5 stars for extra awesome dishes.  This was FABULOUS! I didn't have any bittersweet chocolate, so I used 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate and a bag a semi-sweet morsels.   I also followed two pieces of GUYCHEF's advice...I used 3 eggs and 3 egg whites and I nuked each piece in the microwave for about 10 seconds.  Everyone loved it at our Passover Seder.  My husband's biggest complaint...there were only 2 mini pieces to bring home (and that's because I made sure we had some leftovers, so I hid two small pieces).  He loved it with cherry pie toping and I loved it with vanilla ice cream (you definitely need something to cut into the sweetness a little).  Keep in mind that this is flourless, so it isn’t really fluffy…much more like a gooey brownie (PERFECT in my opinion).  Next time I make this I want to try making this cake with less butter…maybe substitute some margarine…I’m exactly not sure.  But I’ll probably try something.  I promise if you make this you and your guests won’t be disappointed!

I thought this was a great recipe.  I have made it twice for people who enjoyed it (not gluten sensitive people) - they have said it was great.  My husband describes it as a very dense, fudgy cake.  It turned out perfectly both times I made it.  I prepared it in a cake pan and turned it out with no problems.  Thank you.  Will keep the recipe on hand.

My husband who has Celiac Disease, LOVED this cake.  Although, it's not really a cake; it's more like fudge.  The cake didn't come out of the pan very well, so it looked really ugly.  I took some fudge icing and covered it and then used some canned raspberry filling and put that over the top.  It tasted really good.

Delicious, huge hit at my party. Changes I made: 1) cooked in 8" round since that's all I had, snug fit, but it rose and then deflated perfectly. 2) increased cook time to 60 minutes 3)Used just a little less butter (2 tbsp) 4) 4 sq bakers unsweet choc, 1 bag semi-sweet choc 5) Water replaced with 1/2 oj and 1/2 brandy (didn't have grtand marnier).  I lined w/ parchment and sprayed with Pam, but I did have trouble getting it out of the pan, so did the brief submerge in water bath, which possibly helped.  I did not need to use any foil to keep the water bath out, it was fine the whole cook time.  Let cool, then fridged for a few hours, then to room temp for several hours prior to party.  Dusted with confectioner's powder, few mint leaves, and raspberry sauce on each slice.

Wow. Deceptively simple to make, but amazing. It turned out denser than I was hoping (but not denser than I was expecting), but that's just fine. I didn't have a 10" pan, so I used a 9" pan. It swelled a bit upwards during baking above the lip of the pan, but shrunk down and condensed during chilling without wrecking the cake. I only chilled it for about five hours, and it was still perfect. I topped it with a layer of whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa. I also didn't have bittersweet chocolate, so I used mostly semi-sweet, plus three squares of bitter, and it turned out just perfect. I also didn't have any butter (expensive, and I'm poor) so I used margarine, but no one noticed or cared. I made it for a potluck (still currently in progress) of about 12-15 people, and I still have a quarter cake left. The flour-intolerant guest was particularely delighted to find a dessert she could eat, and demanded the recipe from me. A big hit. I will DEFINATELY make this again (and try some of the other flavor alterations, especially the orange one, that other people suggested!).

This was absolutely amazing! I was nervous to make it because a lot of reviewers had trouble getting it out of the pan,I greased mine well and lined with parchment(I used a 9" cake pan-not springform)it came out no problem and was beautiful. I used 4 large eggs and 1 egg white instead of 6 eggs because they were so huge.I baked for the full 45min and the top was completely dry-I think due to using less eggs-next time I will watch closer and bake a bit less. I also used 5oz unsweetened choc. and 13oz semi-sweet chips. I've been asked to bring this to christmas and my husband definitely wants me to make it again. But even though I cut it in 16slices, its hard to eat the whole slice. Very rich!

I have made this recipe at least 10 times and it always comes out perfectly. Many people have told me it is the best dessert they have ever had! If I don't have time to chill the cake overnight, I put it in the freezer for about 4 hours and take it out before dinner. It is a chocolate lover's dream and is so easy yet elegant!

Amazing recipe! Used Splenda instead of sugar and replaced half of the eggs with egg whites (may have helped to cut the richness).  Bittersweet chocolate is the way to go.  Used half water/ half Amaretto and it gave it a nice flavour. Used a 8" spring form pan (hard to find a "bath" big enough for a 10").  The smaller pan makes the cake a bit higher. Baked it for oven for 55 minutes.  Line the pan with parchment and spray with Pam. It's virtually foolproof.

This is the best chocolate fix around!!  To make it a bit more exciting, try using orange juice instead of water and add the zest of one orange, or use cranberry juice and add sliced cranberries just before pouring into pan.....

This is a dense, rich cake that is very much like fudge, without actually being fudge.  Best served at room temperature with fresh raspberries or strawberries, and a fresh berry sauce to accompany.  Vanilla ice cream or whipped cream pairs perfectly as well.

The flavor was excellent.  Everyone at our dinner party loved it (as did I).  Some people had seconds.  One person said that it is the "perfect" dessert.  (I served it with raspberry sauce and Ben & Jerry's vanilla ice cream.)

One suggestion and one disappointment:
Suggestion is that you place parchment paper on the bottom of the pan.  I was unable to get the cake out of the pan.  No matter how much I rested the pan in hot water, the cake wouldn't release.  So, instead of presenting it (whole) on a nice (large) plate, I had to cut it directly out of the pan (and then onto dessert plates).  Not a huge deal but still ...
My disappointment was that I expected a creamier cake and, instead, it was a bit crumbly.  It still tasted great and it was definitely dense and delicious.  But I would've liked a creamier cake that held together when I cut it and placed it on the dessert plate rather than, to a certain extent, falling apart into crumbs.

I will definitely service this dessert again.

Delicious - I used semi sweet chips (3 cups is 18 ozs) and did not alter the amount of sugar - it was sweet, but still fine.  I used a 9 inch spring form pan and cooked 50 mins, and it was still runny in the middle. It is a little tough to tell when it is really done. Also, I think the instructions should say that your butter should be at room temperature, otherwise it won't incorporate very easily. I used a hand mixer and it took forever to get the mixture smooth. I like the idea of using coffee instead of water, or maybe even a few tablespoons of kahlua to give it a little different flavor.

I have made numerous flourless chocolate cake recipes, and this ranks amongst the best. I made a few modifications, but only because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used 12 oz of bittersweet chocolate, 4 oz of semisweet and 2 oz of unsweetened chocolate. I added 5 large eggs (it was what I had!). I used a 9-inch springform pan, didn't use the water bath, and baked the cake for the amount of time indicated. The cake was superb - it cut beautifully, was smooth and as many suggested I served it with a lightly sweetened whipped cream to balance the chocolate. I thought the preparation method was very unique - this is a definite keeper. Thanks for sharing Maggie.

This was incredibly chocolatey and fudgy!  Only change I made to the recipe was baking it in a 9 inch pan for about 50 minutes, in the water bath.  It did fall apart when I cut it, but it wasn't dry.  The end result is not really like cake, but I can imagine it being awesome in layers with a traditional chocolate cake, or with vanilla ice cream.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and served with canned whipped cream and mixed berries, which complement it well.

This was absolutely the most decadent thing I've ever made!  I followed the recipe only making one change and it came out perfect.  I used Splenda half & half for sweetening and the taste was absolutely wonderful.  I will use a springform pan next time, as others had suggested.  It was a little difficult coming out of the cake pan, but with some minor effort it came out and was just amazing.  I dusted the top (after removing from pan) with cocoa powder and served with melted sugar free blackberry jam drizzled on top.  My husband and father-in-law scraped their plates clean! Very easy to make!

This is a definite keeper. My daughter is gluten free and I am always looking for tasty desserts. I took some of the others advice and substituted 3 eggs for egg whites and substituted the grand mariner for the water and it turned out excellent. I baked it in a spring pan with parchment paper on the bottom and it was so easy to remove. Don't over cook, it wont look done in the middle, but once you let it sit, it thickens up. I will definitely make this again!

I have been baking for about 30 years & I thought this was a good recipe. There is no need for a water bath. Put parchment paper sprayed with Pam in the bottom of a spring form pan. You really don't need to cut it to fit, but the edges with come out sort of scalloped. I used a bag of Nestor's chocolate chips @ about 3 ounces of bittersweet cocoa/oil, as I was out of chips. The only difficult thing about this recipe, is the need for extra hands/bowls. I left 6 eggs lightly beaten out on the counter while I made the other stuff and I microwaved the chocolate with no issues. It might help to use room temperature butter-because the hot sugar cools off a bit & might not melt your butter all the way through. I also substituted Kahlua for the water. I baked it for about 45 mins-perfect. It is very rich-the edges have an ever slight crisp while it's still warm & the whipped mouser texture as you bite into it. We are going to try it cold as well.

Silky, rich and decadent.  It was a smash hit at work.  I decided to make it because we have several gluten-intolerant co-workers, but I'll definitely make it again and again regardless.  I used 12 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 6 ounces of bittersweet.  The flavor was really good.  I'm thinking that a dash of vanilla would round it out really nicely, though.  I'll have to experiment. Definitely cut the pieces small - it's very, very rich.  I decorated by just melting some white chocolate and drizzling it all over the cake.  I'll make this one again and again!

Oh.  My.  Goodness.  This cake is incredible.  When you eat this decadent delight, you are not overwhelmed with sugar, frosting, or anything of the like....just beautiful chocolate.  This cake does not whisper chocolate, it screams it loud and clear.  What a fabulous recipe.  The only changes I made were the following:  I subbed coffee for water, Earth Balance for butter, Egg Beaters for eggs, and a 10" springform pan for a regular cake pan.  My only regret is that I can not award this recipe more than 5 stars.

Excellent!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will add coffee instead of water to try it.  Creamy, just like a truffle.  It is very rich so the serving size can be small.  Served with whipped cream and strawberries.  I'll be making this one again!

Amazing!  Definately use a springform pan, I had a 9 inch pan, and did the water bath as per other reviewers suggestions.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was PERFECT!  It came out like cheesecake, did not stick to my pan, and was absolutely delicious - very rich.  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

So amazing.  I had no idea this cake would turn out like this... almost tasted like a cheesecake!  I used 1/2 cup of coffee like some other reviewers suggested, and used 6 eggs but separated 4 of them and beat the egg whites folding them into the mixture at the end.  Baked in a springform pan lined with parchement, but cooled the cake exactly as recipe describes to, and it came out no problem.  I used dark chocolate shaving on top, and put blobs of whipped cream around the edge with chocolate covered strawberries.  (served the whole thing with "sweetened whipped cream, from this site).  I already got requests to bring this to two parties!

This is a good but not a great cake. It is dense, rich and soft and better if compare it with some flour chocolate cakes. Easy to make too. Mine was ready after 30 min of baking. But I can't  say it would be my favorite chocolate cake.

The only problem I had with this recipe was that it doesn't specify that it must be SERVED chilled. I chilled the cake overnight, per the instructions, but left it out for about an hour before serving. It ended up being an absolute mess. I will say however with some re-sculpting and topped with fruit to hid the flaws, it tasted amazing.

I made this for Christmas Eve. It was so easy, and beautiful as well! I didn't have a springform pan, so I just made it in a regular cake pan, greased with butter, and it didn't stick. Sprinkled with confectioner's sugar, piped on some holly, and served with a raspberry sauce from this site, a coffee sauce from Epicurious, and fresh whipped cream flavored with almond extract. I just used the Baker's bittersweet chocolate - not the best chocolate, but it's what my grocery store had, and the cake was still wonderful!

I made this for my husband's birthday and he asked for it to become the *only* birthday cake I ever make!  It's very moist, and dense, and almost like a big truffle. I'm not a huge chocolate fan but this was perfect - not too sweet, and with a perfect texture. The best chocolate cake I've ever made, hands down!

Wow - talk about rich! I have a friend who has celiac's and whenever we get together in a large group I don't want her to feel like she can't enjoy dessert with us.  I'm always on the lookout for something new to try, and this was one of the first things I tried.  Absolutely delicious, and incredibly chocolaty - I brought the leftovers to work with a disclaimer that said "If you think you know how chocolaty these are you're wrong - they are chocolaty-er."  I dusted the top with powdered sugar and brought whipped cream to take the edge off a little.  But they were still a hit!  Thanks for the recipe :)

Guests raved about this cake! Not only delicious, but probably the most professional looking cake I've ever made.  I used salted butter as that's all I had on hand so I omitted the salt.  Also, best if heated in the microwave for 40 seconds before serving!  Can do many sauces or toppings with this...whipped cream , caramel, raspberry sauce, vanilla ice cream or peanut butter all come to mind

this is just amazing! I enjoyed flourless chocolate cake from a fancy bakery at several dollars a slice.  I reviewed several recipes online  and none looked quite like what I had tasted.I craved Fudgy and decadent with almost the feel of ganash.  I found this one and new it was the one. but could I make it great? You betcha! I have now made and served this several times to family and even our missionaries and everyone raves! the only change I made was that I left out the salt but used salted butter and this has without fail been perfect each and every time. Thank you.

This cake might just be TOO good!  Definitely the best torte I've ever made (all credit went to Maggie, of course!).  If you're looking for a rich, thick, so-chocolate-you-could-die torte, then this is it!  Absolutely delicious!

It's just wonderful! This is such a flavourful and decadent treat. I made it for a friend who's allergic to gluten, lactose and soya. I used 78% dark dutch chocolate (dairy free and soya free), substituted the butter with margerine and added a tsp of instant coffee to intensify the chocolate flavour. I also put the cake in the freezer 20 minute before serving to get it extra cold. It's heaven! The texture is something between dark chocolate icecream and a rich chocolate mousse. My friend made me give her the recipe and the list of products I used because she couldn't believe that this rich, delightful, chocolate treat was gluten, lactose and soya free. Absolutely loved this recipe. Thanks!

Fantastic - we substituted espresso for the water and used 72% dark Belgian chocolate - it was amazing! The texture was exactly like a truffle. 
We also had more people show up than expected, and had to cut this one cake into 24 pieces - but it was so rich, it was still plenty! Now I want to make it in a square pan, cut into bite size squares and top each with a choc. covered espresso bean - this would make a great addition to a dessert table.

Outstanding!  The texture is smooth and rich, similar in some respects to truffles, and the word 'decadent' is not an overstatement. Serve it in small slices and pair it with something fairly tart, such as a raspberry coulis, to act as contrast, otherwise it will quickly become overpowering and "heavy". For those of you who are inclined to follow alteration suggestions of other reviewers, my suggestion is don't change a thing. Make it exactly as the recipe states, at least the first time, anyway. You won't be disappointed. (By the way, a springform pan isn't necessary - a regular cake pan works just fine. Line the bottom with parchment paper, and run a sharp knife around the edge as it cools, and you'll have no trouble getting it out of the pan.)  This recipe is a showstopper and a definite keeper!!!

Cake was amazing!  Was used as a Passover birthday cake but will make this all year.  Used 1.5 bags of Ghirardelli bittersweet chips.  Used parchment paper on the bottom of the pan (I used 7 x 11 pan).  Served with ice cream and strawberries. Very rich, you don't need much.  Yum!

This is AMAZING, rich and yummy.  I too didn't have bittersweet so I used semi-sweet chips (18 oz.) This was a five star  restaraunt cake.  LOVE IT. I put a bit of fresh whipped cream on top!

Used 1 bag of Ghiradelli bittersweet and 1/2 bag Nestle semi-sweet for the chocolate, and strong coffee in place of the water.  I served it with chocolate ganache and raspberry sauce, both from this site.  Only complaint (my perfectionistic streak) was how it crumbled when I sliced it.

I made this cake the other night, and it was absolutely incredible. It has such a nice dark chocolate flavor - so incredibly rich, but not too sweet. I paired it with the Honey Vanilla Ice Cream (also from this site), and that definately helped tone down the chocolaty-ness. So good. 5 stars, definately!

THIS RECIPE WAS A BIG HIT!!! I HAVE MADE IT SEVERAL TIMES NOW. THANKSGIVING WITH MARZIPAN PUMPKINS IN THE MIDDLE AND SLIVERED ALMONDS AROUND THE EDGES. AND WITH DRIES COCONUT PEICES HAT WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL. I LOOK FORWARD TO TRYING OTHER ADDITIONS TO THIS FANTASTIC RECIPE.

Fabulous! This was easy and very rich but soooo good! I made it for a chocolate lover's birthday party and it was loved by all.  Strawberries and raspberries can make a great garnish.

Made this in my pressure cooker and it turned out beautifully.  Put mixture in springform and covered tightly with foil.  Placed in cooker on rack and added 2 cups of water to base of cooker.  Brought to boil, put cooker lid on and brought to pressure.  Once at pressure started timing for 10 minutes.  At end of time, took cooker off heat and let pressure reduce naturally.  Removed from cooker and put on wire rack to cool one hour, then refrigerated.

This is truly an incredible cake!  I actually love using milk chocolate chips (Guiradelli) instead of a more bitter chocolate, as I could really enjoy every bite.  The semi sweet cake was amazing too but I needed a lot of whipped cream to offset it.  Mind you, we don't like dark chocolate in general.    The second time I made this, my water bath looked like it might have seeped into the cake...I was horrified, but it tasted fine.  Next time I will use parchment to line the pan and foil on the outside.  Everyone who had a piece asked me for this recipe!

This dessert was like something I'd get at a fine upscale restaurant. Decadent, rich, totally incredible. Very high in "everything" but a perfect dessert for a group as one can only eat a very small portion.  Will make for special gatherings.

I have a friend who is allergic to glueten, so for his birthday I made this cake for him.  Let me tell you...very rich, very indulgent, and very delicious!  I served it a with an itty bitty scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top (trust me on the itty-bitty part, this cake is decadent enough by itself) and everyone loved it.  Next time I make this, I might try adding in 2 tbsp. of ancho chile powder to try out the spicy-chocolate flavor combination that works so well in chocolate bars.
**UPDATE** There were left overs from the birthday party, so we put the cake in the fridge.  The next night we chopped the cold cake into cubes and mixed them with the vanilla ice cream that was left over.  It was fabulous.  I think I actually preferred the cake cold!

Very rich and chocolaty! I find that it is closer to fudge than cake in consistency. Overall excellent gluten-free dessert. One piece of advice: do not try making this in a springform pan - I found out the hard way that springforms let water in when placed in a water bath and had to start over.

Loved this. As another reviewer noted, it's good cold or warmed up (which gives it a pudding-like consistency that is delicious).  I found this recipe to be much tastier than the Flourless Chocolate Cake II recipe on this site.

Having a problem with the cake sticking to the bottom? Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. I like to use a springform pan with this type of cake, it makes it easier to release the cake from the pan.

I cut out 2-3 egg yolks, and followed the rest of the recipe. Absolutely love it when served cold, taste too egg-y when served hot.

I love flourless chocolate cake and discovered it during my low carb diet days.  I took this recipe and transformed it to be not only flour free, but sugar free and near fat free. You would never guess with the richness and texture of this cake.   - chocolate can be substituted for a combination of special dark cocoa powder (which is 0 fat compared to regular cocoa powder)/splenda/smart squeeze nonfat margarine (1 3/4 cup, 1 1/3 cup, 1/2 cup respectively) - sugar for splenda - smart squeeze nonfat margarine for the butter - 3 eggs & 3 egg whites for the 6 eggs.  I followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  I couldn't wait to let it cool enough before I took it out of the pan... whoops.  Most of it stayed together when I flipped the pan, but there was some breakage. I will have to be more patient next time... I just couldn't wait to eat it.  Enjoy!

For serious chocolate lovers, this is the best.  My family is GFCF so I make a thick raspberry sauce and use Soy Whip for topping.  We are so in love with this recipe.

I had a flourless chocolate cake in a very nice restaurant this past weekend and enjoyed it very much.  I did a search for flourless chocolate cake here on AR – so that I could duplicate the dessert.  Here it is – Flourless Chocolate Cake with a warm raspberry sauce – served with two small dollops of sweetened whipped cream on the side and a very small scoop of raspberry sherbet.  Mine came out just like the restaurants and I’m so glad, because now I can have this fabulous dessert anytime and I even get to share it with family and friends.

Need a Chocolate Fix?  Here it is!  Hubby wanted Chocolate cake for his Birthday, and this is what he got.  I used 3 cups semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the bitter sweet squares, put it in a Spring Form pan, didn't put it in a water bath, and it still turned out melt in your mouth yummy!  I don't think you can ruin this recipe.  Very rich.  Don't frost, don't even sprinkle with Powdered Sugar, doesn't need it.  I made home made vanilla icecream to go with it.  Perfect.  Top with a few fresh raspberries and it's Heaven!

Watch out! if you're adding powdered coffee products to this recipe (as suggested/tried by some reviewers):   Many of them contain wheat products and will render this SUPERIOR recipe NOT gluten-free.

This cake was amazing!  I'm not a master baker by any means and it was very easy.  I made it for a class function (grad student) and a chef in our class went nuts for it!  I followed some of the reviewers suggestions - 8 squares bittersweet choc. than almost whole bag semi-sweet chips.  Served with whip cream and fruit.  Huge success!  Thank you!

I made this without the water bath or wax paper.  I just sprayed the springform pan with PAM and it turned out perfectly.  I served it with a fanned strawberry and whipped cream on top.  Our guests absolutely loved it.  I used Ghirardelli's bittersweet chocolate chips.  This definitely has a dark chocolate taste.  Personally, I would probably do half bittersweet and half semi-sweet next time.  Also, be sure to give it ample time warm up to room temperature (a few hours at least).  It makes it so much more enjoyable.

I only give this a five because I had to use smart balance margarine (the harder kind, not the soft spreadable kind, it makes the cake way too gooey to use the latter) to make this dairy as well as gluten-free. Apparently, some kinds of bittersweet chocolate do not use milk. read the ingredients, I found Baker's bittersweet chocolate doesn't use milk in it, so my little brother on his gf/cf diet can enjoy his favorite dessert again! now if only I could master gf/cf pizza... Also, this is wonderful with the high rated raspberry sauce from this site!

I cut the recipe in half and made individual servings using silicone muffin forms, and they were amazing! Also, I made some fresh whipped cream to go with and then sprinkled with some sliced almonds--a fantastic combination...

I have baked this cake 3 times. I just entered it in the holiday bake-off at work and won first place! This is a restaurant-quality flourless chocolate cake, and it is extremely easy to make. I used 16 oz of semisweet baker's chocolate (two boxes) and didn't want to buy a third box, so I just used a Hershey's Special Dark bar. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee. 

You cannot miss with this one!

WOW. This is the most amazing chocolate cake ever. I doubled the recipe and made two cakes. Used Ghiradelhi (sp?) choc chips. I shared it with all my friends and coworkers because this cake is just too good to keep to myself. Everyone agrees that it's the best. Thank you for sharing this, Maggie!

I know this recipe already has enough rave reviews, but I just have to add one more.  Y-U-M!!  I made exactly as the recipe was writte, except I replaced some of the water with strongly brewed coffee.  I also poured the chocolate ganache recipe from this site over the top and let a little of it drip down the sides.  The ganache on it was superb - and easy!  The flavor is so rich and decadent.  I think next time I might try it in a smaller springform pan as it wasn't very tall.  The ganache helped with that.  Excellent recipe!

It is so good to have something delicious to eat without worrying about gluten!! This recipe is WONDERFUL! I used choc. chips and 4 sq. unsweetened choc. I tried using orange juice to replace the water but you couldn't tell it. I served it with lactose free vanilla ice cream.
It messes up alot of dishes preparing it but it was fairly simple to do. This was my first time using a springform pan so I was a little nervous but I did as other viewers said. Line bottom with parchment paper, spray with pam, wrap foil around the outside. No water leaked in and no cake leaked out!!
It came out beautifully. Next time I think I'll try a raspberry sauce to cut the sweet a little.

This is the cake people ask me to make for them when going to parties or having one.  This is a very rich, dense, cake.  I have made it differently adding chocolate ganache with raspberries or strawberries added to the top of the cake.  I have also added orange zest into the cake or served it with a raspberry coulis to pour on top with whipped cream as well.  

To save time and cleaning, I do everything in one glass bowl.  I heat the chocolate in the microwave and go from there.  I also use parchment paper to line the bottom of the cake pan which makes it a little more easy to get out.  If you have trouble getting the cake out of the pan, dip the pan into warm water and then try again.  

This cake is wonderful and everyone will rave.

Really amazing! I used Kahlua in place of the water, but I really couldn't taste it. This chocolate cake has super powers! I thinned out some strawberry jam with water and lemon juice, pooled it in a dessert plate and served with sliced strawberries and whipped cream.

Many of my cakes are sold to individuals with high-end taste and pocket books, and this one received, if possible, higher raves than any I've made thus far. Worth a review for sure.  Used Drambuie instead of water, but I presume Kahlua or other liquor would work just as well. Only use Ghirardelli. No question I prefer an 8" spring form pan; produces a slightly higher (thinker) result.  Made a Raspberry Coulis from Emeril's website, but used frozen raspberries instead of fresh.  Worked perfectly.  Drizzled that onto a plate and placed 1/16 of cake onto it.  Dotted with slightly sweetened whipped cream, 1/2 of mint chocolate-filled mint flavoured Pirouette (Pepperidge Farm) cookie on top, a couple of fresh raspberries and a fresh mint leaf.  And voila, an unbelievable experience.  My client served this to the President of Ukraine's wife and entourage, and they were blown away.  Oh, and just follow the rest of the recipe and you can't go wrong.  Easy.  Definitely worth a try, even if you just eat it "nuked" with some vanilla ice cream as a previous reviewer suggested...delicious.

YUM!  This was absolutely delicious. This is VERY dense and rich.  Make sure you only serve extremely small slices.  We made this in a spring form pan and it worked great.  Just be sure to use one that does not leak at all or line it with wax paper as suggested in another review.  The more you mix the batter before baking, the better.  This came out so creamy and wonderful.  It was like a big fudgey truffle.  We served this with vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries.  Everyone raved.  We will definitely make this one again.

OH MY GOSH!!!The most decadent cake I've had - very high end.  Topped it with the stabilized whipped cream icing from this site and served on a pool of raspberry sauce from the Snow pudding recipe from this site.  Should be named something else - flourless makes it sound like there's something missing, but there sooooo is not.

This cake was delicious and easy to make, but VERY rich and heavy.  You really need to be a chocolate lover to enjoy.  Most of my guests found it too intense for their tastes.  I have already served it for Passover AND Easter and still can't get rid of it!

I make this cake a lot. I often get requests from friends who have had every time there’s a gathering.  I read one review that said they ended up with chocolate pudding.  I have to assume something went awry in the process. I have never had anything but success and compliments every time I make it.  I haven’t tried leaving out 3 of the egg yolks, but I might try it. But why mess with a perfect recipe?

I loved this cake - I did make the following alterations - 1st I had some large crystal beet sugar and I used this instead of processed sugar.  I did strain the sugar after heating - in this type of sugar there typically is some residue.  I did find that using this kind of sugar helped with the sugar spike.  I used 4-oz of unsweetened chocolate and the rest bitter. Yum!

There is no reason to change one single thing about this recipe. It's perfect just the way it is, and I mean Perfect!  My tips:  use a stand mixer with the dough paddle, cut the very cold butter (mine came out of the freezer) in fingernail sized squares and be patient about adding a few pieces at a time and incorporating it all.  By the time the butter is beaten in and you add the sugar water and eggs, it will look like cake batter.   I used a 9 inch springform sprayed with Pam with parchment on the bottom, although I'm thinking I didn't need the parchment.  Did use the water bath. Served with a bit of real whipped cream and dark sweet cherries.  Maybe the best chocolate dessert I ever made!

I have eaten my share of cake in my lifetime, and I have to say this is easily the BEST chocolate cake I have ever eaten.  Dense, moist, and rich.  Actually easy to make and the directions could not be clearer. However, read your chocolate amounts carefully as my squares were half ounces and not ounce squares .  Look closely at the amounts on your chocolate packaging!

I tried this one yesterday.  it was ok.
My spring form pan must not have been 100% sealed so I had a bit of cake batter drip out.  In the end there was a thin pale layer at the bottom of the pan that tasted like nothing, but had an odd look.  The rest of the cake tasted really good, smooth, creamy, delicious.
It only ended up being about 3/4 inch thick so I made a chocolate mousse to top it to make the cake a total of about 2-inches high.  the mousse is what save it all ---- totally delicious!

Love it but I need to cut back on the sugar, especially if I am using a chocolate chip (semisweet). I usually make my own bittersweet with cocoa powder but I have made it with semisweet chips. I also like to add vanilla or almond extract. I want to try mint for christmas, too. I made this in cupcake form for a bake sale and got many requests for the recipe.
Top with whip cream and raspberries! so creamy and delicious

I made this for a company dessert tonight and followed the recipe exactly-it was perfect, exactly like one I had recently made by a much more talented cook than I am! Not hard at all, and the flavor was out of this world. I served it with homemade whipped cream with just about two tablespoons of sugar per 2 cups-the cake is plenty rich without it though. My only issue was that it did not come out of the cake pan, I ended up just having to cut it like pie-but I think that was my fault, I did not have the time to let it refrigerate overnight. Next time I will make sure I do that and I bet it will come out great. This is definitely a keeper!

I used my KitchenAid stand mixer and found that the batter cooled toward the outside so it got sticky and I had to scrape it down quite a bit. Bigger chunks of butter (more than 1 Tbsp) might have helped, or melting the chocolate (I used 60% Ghirardelli) to a higher temp also might have helped. I used a springform pan with a water bath and a little water leaked into the edge of the cake. I chilled it overnight. When I served it the consistency was very gooey although the flavor was good. There were occasional bits of egg white so I think the mixer wasn't effective. Would consider trying this again with different process.

This was absolutely delicious!  I did follow the advice from other reviewers and used 3 whole eggs and 3 whites.  We skipped the liquor for this one.  It was silky smooth, melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness.  We all started with thin slices but kept going back for more.  I made this with a simple raspberry sauce using thawed raspberries, a touch of sugar and water which I cooked, strained then reduced before adding a little cornstarch.  This concentrated raspberry flavor was a perfect compliment to the truffle like cake.  Looking forward to trying this with Irish Creme or a good orange or raspberry liquor.

Made this at my husbands request. Read the reviews first and decided to use Trader Joe's semi sweet chocolate chips and the 3 egg/3egg white suggestion. Also, added a packet of Starbucks Via  instant coffee to the sugar water mixture. Lightly beat the eggs (used room temperature) and tempered with a quarter of the sugar/water mix before adding to chocolate. The result was amazingly smooth with a hint of mocha! Should point out that I used a darker finish springform pan and needed 5-7 extra minutes of cooking time.

Totally sinful!   I drizzled blended strawberries with sugar and raspberry schnapps over the top.  Added some fresh mint and raspberries for an elegant touch.

My 13-year old daughter made this with minimal help from me to take to a dinner with gluten-free guests. On the plus side, it was easy to make. We used a springboard pan but no water bath. The cake is definitely ultra rich like eating a truffle. We made a strawberry sauce to go on the side. While this was an okay dessert, I'd rather have a brownie or other chocolate treat. Too rich for me.

I made and loved this cake! Family, friends & coworkers raved!!!!!
This recipe used to be accompanied by the recipe for the Raspberry Reduction Sauce the cake is drizzled with in the picture. Where did it go? I searched this site and it's gone. Luckily I already have it printed out, but it's a shame future bakers won't have it.

This was great!  Much creamer than others I have had before. I used I Ghiradelli chocolate and served it with raspberry sauce.  It was wonderful. I did not used a spring form pan,  and had no trouble getting it out of my cake pan-just run a knife around the edges and set it in a pan of hot water for a few seconds. I do think that next time I will line the pan with silicone paper,  as that will be much easier.

Absolutely fantastic - very rich...cut small slices or it will be too much of a good thing!!!  I used 12 ounces Ghirardelli Semi-Sweet chocolate and 4 ounces Ghirardelli Bitter-Sweet Chocolate.  I used a greased cake pan -  my spring form pan was already being used - worked fine.  I love this cake - will definitely make it again - as a bonus it is naturally gluten-free for those with gluten issues.

This is FABULOUS!!! It's less cake than a wonderfully smooth truffle!!!  I have made it for three occasions in the last month and it always gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I make a frosting just like you do for the main part of the cake (without the eggs), pour it on top and down the sides on the cake plate... decorating it with seasonal sprinkles before it hardens.  It is beautiful!!

This went over really well with the whole family! This was despite the fact I'd baked it in the wrong pan and couldn't serve it cut into slices, but that wasn't an issue as we simply scooped it out of the pan without altering the taste :) 

In terms of the actual recipe, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead, as some here complained about the flavor, and it was wonderful (and a lot less expensive in terms of ingredients). My butter was already salted, so I skipped the added salt. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this today for my husband's birthday. Followed every step. The only thing I did differently was I used 16 oz instead of 18 oz of bittersweet chocolate. Butter was still a little hard but it still came out wonderful. My husband loved it and said that it is better than the one we had at the restaurant.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I really loved this recipe.  I followed the directions as written, the family loved it. I made a quick raspberry sauce with frozen raspberries, raspberry jam and a little corn starch.  I topped it with whipped cream. Delicious.

Great recipe.  The flavor and texture are delicious.  I made this for some guests that were coming over that are trying to eat gluten-free.  I had several guests say that they preferred this over regular (flour) chocolate cakes.  I did take the suggestions from some of the other reviews.  Including using 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips (2 1/4 c) and lowered the sugar to only 1/2 c.  The only problem I had was trying to get it out of the pan in one piece.  I used a springform pan and that helped, but will have to make this again (oh bummer) to try and get it out without falling apart.

So easy to make and delicious!  It is very rich so you'll want to include some fruit with it...I just pureed some raspberries with a little bit of wildberry jam - yum!  Next time, I'll try this with expresso or coffee liqueur instead of water :).  Definatly will make this again!

This cake is SO EASY! I've made three of them in the span of one week. I brought one to Passover and two to my husband's pHd defense. The professors LOVED it (including one with celiacs) and everyone wanted the recipe. Don't change a thing. I do have to mention that when I can't find bittersweet chocolate, I use semi-sweet and cut down the sugar a bit. I did the first one with semi-sweet without altering the sugar and it was still great, but some of the adults were a little overwhelmed by the sweetness.

I baked this cake for my daughter's birthday, so that her gluten sensitive husband could enjoy the birthday cake.  It was amazing.  It is exactly like the expensive Chocolate desserts I've often had in upscale restaurants.  I followed the directions exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Served with vanilla ice cream, it  was a decadent,  melt in your mouth splurge!

I made this cake specifically for my gluten free brother inlaw, but everyone else said they thought it was better than chocolate cake.  Its very rich so only small slices are needed.

I made it exactly as stated, it looked very wet when I took it out of the oven, but it firms up.  We served it with whipped cream and rasberries.  Next time I would add a liqueur.

Decreased sugar to 1/2 cup, used 18 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and only 5 eggs.  I did take some shortcuts.  First, I added the chocolate chips to the saucepan of water, sugar, and salt so that it would melt thoroughly with it.  I through in all of the butter at one time and stirred a lot until it melted.  Removed all of this from low heat, tempered my 5 eggs with a little of the batter thus far and then slowly poured in the egg while my cake beater was on constantly.  I used a spring form pan with parchment paper at the bottom and greased entire surface with butter.  I did not use a water bath during the baking process.  I did get distracted and let the cake cook for 49 minutes rather than 45.  Was worried that it would be overdone, but it wasn't!  Topped with powdered sugar (that disappeared too quickly) and raspberries with a raspberry-whisky sauce on the side.  Highly recommend this cake for all important birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and other days that end in the letter "y".

This was a great cake.  My only regret is that I didn't use individual ramekins.  I could not get it out of the pan and it broke.  I just served it on plates instead of a whole cake.  It was also very, very rich.  I couldn't finish even a small piece.  Still very good.

Made it as described and it tasted great. Used Bakers chocolate brand

Only reason I didn't give all 5 stars is that it came out more "fudgy" than I would like in a flour less cake.  

Going to try next time cutting down the butter and/or eggs.

This is an amazingly delicious and easy dessert!  I used semisweet chocolate chips and salted butter and it was still great!  I didn't use a water bath, but I did use parchment paper, greased and dusted with cocoa and it didn't stick.  I made this for my daughter's birthday because she is on a glutin free diet and (she loves chocolate!), but it is a gourmet dessert that can be served anytime to everyone!  It will be a hit for sure!  I dusted with powdered sugar and put raspberries on the top.....beautiful display!!

Great recipe. Grease pan and "flour" with cocoa. Use the really good dark chocolate chips (the darker the better). I used cream instead of water and added instant coffee/espresso, and vanilla.  If you're doing a 9" pan, increase cook time by 5 min.  You can cool in the freezer if you have less time.

Oh my god.  This is like a really dense fudge truffle cheesecake.  You could probably use a melon baller to scoop this out and roll it in toppings to make truffles, actually.  I made this exactly as is and served this with some black cherry sauce and Chambord-infused whipped cream.  FYI - for dessert sauces, you can get real fruit and do all the hassle - I just grab whatever seedless jam/jelly I have in the fridge, and melt that down over the stove and then doctor up if needed.  (Never hurts to add a little liquor)  Enjoy!!!

Great recipe for everyone (even gluten-intolerant folks) to enjoy.  It's rich, so it's best served along with a cup of coffee or hot tea.

Holy heaven in my mouth! This is like a fancy dessert I would expect to find in a very small sliver on a very small plate after a very pricy meal. However, now I can make it at home and impress guests (which is just what I did). Reviews are true, its very rich and you don't need to eat much to be quite content. You most certainly DO need to wait the day in between or overnight for it to set. It ocntinues to be just as good for a couple of days, and as it hardens in the fridge takes the consistency of the middle of a truffle. I will make this any time i need to make something special, or something gluten free. Followed the directions exactly, and it turned out flawlessly! THANK YOU!!!!! HEAVEN!

This cake was exceptional! I made it exactly as written, however for a little twist and color I added two beets to the recipe. Made it extra moist and gave it a lovely deep red color. Bake the beets in the oven and then blend them in a food processor. The color was lovely and I could not keep my hands off of this cake

**AWESOME**
This is the cake I had in a coffeeshop in Erie, PA 15 years ago and have been trying to replicate ever since. It is so dense and rich -absolutely perfect with a cup of chai tea. I made as directed with the following exceptions: used 8 oz Bakers chocolate, 7 oz toll house chips, and followed the directions on Hershey's baking cocoa to make up the difference. I opted out of the hot water bath. The oven was on all day at 500 degrees baking pizzas, I turned it down to 300 after the last pizza, waited 2 hours and baked this exactly 45 mins. It came out perfect -the center wasn't gooey or anything (although it appeared so, the toothpick test came out clean). I tried it when cooled to room temp and it was great with a glass of milk as well. I made it in an 8 inch round cake pan and it was fine. It rose up about 2 inches above the pan and then sunk back. 9 or 10 inch would be better if you have them, as it's a rich cake, but 8 inch worked out good and you can slice thin pieces.

SO good. the best flour-less cake ever. it was so moist and perfect. i used a glass bowl and skipped in the boiling water thing and it turned out fine! i cranked the oven up to 335 and it was in a little longer then an hour, but it was worth it. so chocolaty and fresh. definitely using this recipe again

Just made this cake.  Fantastic.  I accidentally left out an egg and also baked at 350 for 40 minutes before i realized.  opps!  thought I ruined it- but it was perfect.  I may purposely make the same mistakes again!

This is incredible.  It  doesn't matter if you are on a gluten free/wheat free diet or not.  This is a must try recipe.  I used semi sweet chocolate and did not use the water bath.  I ran a knife round the edge before I unlocked the pan and it was fine.  I served it with whipped cream.  This was an amazing dessert.

Exceptionally delicious for dark chocolate lovers. Don't try this cake unless you enjoy those 70%+ dark chocolate bars.  I used unsweetened baking chocolate, therefore I increased the amount of sugar to about 2 cups (also used 2 cups of water). The end result was delicious! I do agree with other reviewers that the cake was quite crumbly, but that didn't bother me :)

I scaled this recipe down from a 10" round cake to an 8" round, estimating it at 10 servings instead of 16. Next time, I might use some semi-sweet chocolate or add more sugar. It was a bit bitter for my taste. I also found it crumbled when cut. (I served it cold). I dusted with powdered sugar & served with chocolate raspberry sauce.

An insanely dense and decadent dessert! That said- I only used a stick and a half of margarine (instead of butter for lactose reasons) and that was plenty. The batter was easy to make, however my springform pan leaked for the first time, and thankfully not much.  Very simple. Served with soy vanilla ice cream. great summer dessert. most likely will freeze the rest and use as chocolate chunks for ice cream.
For anyone reading- you need 18 oz of chocolate total for this recipe.

This was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly, but used one bag of semisweet chocolate chips and baking squares for the rest.  It was SO rich and delicious.  I topped it with the hard chocolate glaze from this site, some fresh whipped cream, and a raspberry puree.  I served it at a dinner party and my guests were commenting that it tasted like something from an upscale restaurant.  Amazing! I will make this again.

Oh my goodness, delicious! I have given this recipe to every celiac i know. I made it a few days ago for my boyfriend's birthday in a miniature springform (1/2 recipe), used 8 oz unsweetened chocolate and stick margarine instead of butter. It came out perfectly after 35 minutes. We each at a small piece and sliced and froze the rest. This cake thaws beautifully and even tastes great as a snack straight from the freezer. Like others, I recommend a raspberry coulis.  I served it with fresh strawberries but it needs something a little bit saucy.

Very rich.  Can be served with many different sauces to suit your mood/occasion.  Used 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites as others suggested.  Cooking times were spot on.  This makes enough to feed an army because it is so rich and satisfying.

WOW!  This was pretty easy to make, and it is just delicious!  Very rich and dense, but chocolatey through and through.  I did use a bag of semi-sweet Ghirardeli chocolate chips and 4 blocks of unsweetened chocolate.  Worked very well.  I did not think this cake was done at the end of the baking time, and if the directions had not specified that it would look wet after bake time was done, I would have thought there was some mistake, but I took it out of the oven, hoping for the best.  After being refrigerated overnight, it is just perfect.  I had a bit of trouble inverting it onto a serving dish.  I think I waited too long after allowing the pan to rest in hot water for 10 seconds.  Either way, a success!  Looks and tastes great!  And my husband says he hopes I don't get any marriage proposals after we serve this at a get-together tonight!  Thanks for the recipe!

I love, love, love this cake!  I cannot eat wheat, corn or dairy and this is great!  I sprinkle it with some baking cocoa to cut down on the sweetness, and occasionally serve it with a side of raspberry sauce.  I've found that the ingredients don't need to be separated- I throw in salted butter with the water, chocolate, and sugar until it melts, then beat that in with the eggs.  I don't even have a double boiler- just stir often.  I sometimes use a few pieces of dark chocolate for the last few ounces of chocolate on this recipe as well.  Another no-spill tip- I put the water-filled pan in the oven before I preheat so as not to spill water over the entire kitchen on the way from the sink.

Rich, decadent and delicious!  This recipe is a definite keeper.  It was really easy to make, turned out great and was a hit with my whole family.  I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and made a raspberry sauce to drizzle over over it at serving time.  Yum yum!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Delicious and totally worth the work.  I topped with fresh whipped cream and mini chocolate chips.  A little tricky to get out of the pan, even when following the recipe exactly.  Took this to an adult dessert/coffee time, and was asked many times for the recipe.

This recipe is sensational.  It is delicious, easy and absolutely forgiving. My daughter does not eat any desserts - except occasionally flourless chocolate cake.  She was married two weeks ago and asked me to make flourless chocolate cakes for the wedding reception (150 people).  I made ten 10-inch cakes, 1 8-inch cake and 1 6-inch cake using this recipe.  I froze them and my husband drove them from Minnesota to New York in coolers of dry ice.  They defrosted in a cool basement for 3 days.  They were absolutely perfect when served.  People loved them - one guest commented to his mother, "This is the cake you've been trying to make for 30 years!"  I was even able to create a "traditional wedding cake" using one 10-inch; the 8-inch and the 6-inch versions.  I cannot recommend this recipe highly enough.

WOW!!  I followed the instructions in the comments - used a springform pan wrapped in foil in a water bathand cut eggs to 3 eggs and 3 egg whites.  Seriously, one of the best desserts I've had.  It was SO rich - needed a big glass of milk with it but neither myself nor my guests could stay away.  I will for sure be making this again......and again.....and again!

This is a very rich cake, it came out very fudge like. As per another reviewers suggestion, I used 3 eggs and 3 egg whites. I also added 1 tspn vanilla. It definitely should be served with some type of whipped cream or ice cream since it is extremely rich. I whipped 1 container whipping cream with 1/4 cup confectioners sugar and 1 tsp vanilla to serve with the cake.

This is VERY rich. I'd say the consistency is like a mix between cheesecake and fudge. I topped this with a brown sugar frosting (homemade). This tastes AMAZING with ice cream, or adding some type of peanut butter (reeses like) layer would be great! Thanks for the recipe  = )

It was perfect. 5 stars. I cut down about a 1/2 tbs. of butter. But I didn't have time for it to chill, so I stuck it in the freezer for an hour and a half and it was perfect. I blended up a blackberry sauce in the food processor with vanilla and sugar.I also added some thawed fruit to the blackberries and it was delicious.  It was the best cake EVER.

Very tasty. I used Ghiradelli 60 percent cacao chips and 1 cup sugar, baked in a springform pan, no water bath. We couldn't wait, so we ate some after it had been refrigerated for about 3 hours. It was like fudge. The next day, it was more "cakey" but still very dense and delicious. I sprinkled it with powdered sugar. It would've been even better with just a swirl of raspberry, orange or even apricot sauce. Will make often.

Really quite good! This recipe needs no changing. Almost just like a cheesecake, but better. I served with some homemade whipped cream. Rasberry sauce I think would be a good idea for tartness. Hugs all around for this one.

This cake is amazing - so rich and dense and chocolatey. I made it in a springform pan and was glad I did because I don't know how I'd have gotten it out otherwise. Served it with vanilla whipped cream and raspberry coulis - awesome. Thanks for the recipe!

Ah-may-zing!  So easy and it tastes sooo good.  I used 18 oz. of bittersweet Ghiradelli chocolate chips (as another reviewer suggested) and it was great.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  Yum!  This will be my new favorite dessert to make and share. :)

Simple to make and decadent.  Brought it to the inlaws for Christmas Eve and my mother-in-law wouldn't less us take any home :(  The only reason there was some left was because we were only 5 adults and this easily serves 16.  Serve with fresh raspberries on top and a dollop of whipped cream.  To die for!

This deserves 5 stars because it doesn't just taste great, the recipe works perfectly, and the cake looks beautiful, too.  Other flourless cakes fall in the center, but not this one!  It was pastry chef quality, and we all loved it!

Amazing!!! Perfect for any elegant meal, it will impress any crowd!  Just like the ones we got on a cruise, and cruise food is THE best!  I put them in mini silicone muffin pans and only baked for 30 mins, worked great, and after chilling they just popped right out without the hot water. They look so elegant on a plate with pureed strawberry sauce and a mint leaf for garnish.  For those who have never tried this, it is not at all like regular cake, almost like a dense cheesecake texture or even like fudge, but so rich and decadent.  Good chocolate is a must for this.  Thanks for the great recipe, will definately make this again!

I have made this several times and it always is well received.  This dessert is also great for those with wheat gluten allergies.   The best one I made was with rich dark chocolate from Pierre Marcolini.  The best ever! Any dark chocolate is good. I don't like it as much with a sweeter chocolate.

I had a tenuous relationship with this recipe, but we have now worked out our flaws and I now make this all the time. A few things: I bake this in the water bath for a full hour, cool until room temp on a cooling rack, and then refrigerate overnight.  I put parchment paper in the bottom, and butter the sides of the spingform pan and BOTH sides of the parchment paper.  I boil the water bath in a kettle right before filling it.  I mix this VERY well between each addition.  This makes a lighter and higher cake.  I use 4 eggs and two whites. I have used very strong coffee in place of the water for very good results.  Also, I have made versions with raspberry extract and mint extract to great reviews.

At first I was disappointed because there was a noticable grainy consistancy to it. I think that I added in too much air though with my mixer, because as it sat in the fridge it became much smoother. Three days after I made it, it was perfect! So my advice would be to make it several days before it is needed and let it sit. Definetly ages well.

This is incredible! It's so rich and smooth. I only had semi-sweet chocolate to use, so I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup, and added 1/2 a tsp of instant coffee powder to the sugar-water. I didn't add any salt to it, because I had to use salted butter. I thought it might come out too sweet and too salty, but it is amazing! Finished it with a dusting of unsweetened cocoa powder. It really reminds me of the inside of a good chocolate truffle.

I would go for a 9-inch springform pan next time because a 10-inch one makes such a thin cake that the slice kind of looks pitiful.  Regarding the taste, I have nothing to complain about.  I read other reviews first and am glad I only used 3 yolks, too, because the cake would have been too rich had I used all 6 suggested in the original recipe.  The consistency reminded me of truffles, and I imagine it would be amazing in combination with regular chocolate cake and a layer of chocolate mousse.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Amazing recipe and easy to make.  I did have some difficulty removing the cake from the pan after letting it sit in the refrigerator the first time.  After some experimenting, I recommend dusting the greased pan with cocoa powder.  Also, I found that inverting the pan onto a cake dish and then placing a pan of hot water on the bottom of cake pan to be helpful in removing the cake.

Oh. My. God. 

This is outstanding. Totally decadent. We had a dinner party with 4 adults and 2 kids and barely ate a third of it. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips since I didn't have any squares in the house. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Unmolding was a little tricky, but once I ran a knife around the outside of the pan it came out great. Made an 8" cake pan plus two 7 oz ramekins. Served with plain (unsweetened) whipped cream to cut the intensity a bit. Will DEFINITELY make this again!

This recipe was alright. We all agreed that it was way too rich. The cocoa on the outside that i used to dust the pan gave the cake a pour bitter taste. We ate this cake with cool whip and candied walnuts.

This was both a snap to make and a huge success at the Thanksgiving table! After reading other reviews, I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and used 6 oz. unsweetened chocolate and 1 bag of semi-sweet chips. I did not do the water bath, but did set a pan of water on the rack below while baking. This recipe worked really well in a disposable pie pan; it popped right out when I was ready to serve it. This is definitely a keeper!!

This recipe was very easy to follow.  I couldn't believe how easy it was.  I have never double-boiled anything and it turned out perfect.  Everyone thought I bought it.  I used a springform pan which worked great, a powdered sugar stencil for the top, and a raspberry sauce with a strawberry on the side.  My only suggestion:  SMALL SERVINGS.  Half my guests ate the whole thing, the other half couldn't finish half of it.  It is super rich.  You only need a sliver.  I think it could potentially serve more than 16 people.  Thanks to the person who submitted this recipe!  You made me look like a real baker!

I followed the recipe exactly and it got rave reviews! I, personally, loved it  - but I think next time I make it I'll experiment with half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chocolate chips just to see how it turns out. I topped each slice with a dusting of powdered sugar and a dollop of fresh whipping cream. DELICIOUS!

ps. I also agree with another reviewer - it tastes exactly like what they serve on the Royal Caribbean ships.

i can't not give this 5 stars because i'm a choco-holic, and everyone knows the candies and cakes are the best things about passover :) this is RICH and thick, very like fudge, almost. but it's sooooo good. i used a springform pan, which made it easy, and when baking i only had water up an inch or two on the side of the pan. this would be great with raspberry sauce, as others suggested; next time i might add a little almond or hazelnut extract. i made most of the sedar meal -- it was all a big hit, but the cake by far got the most rave reviews.

This was very yummy,rich and delicious!
It was slightly dry so I think I will cut down the time by at least 5 mins. I didn't use the water bath but will when making it here in Denver.I think the high altitude may have affected the consistency. I served it with a raspberry sauce and dollop of whipped cream. Everyone loved it and I will make it again with the slight changes next time.

This was extremely delicious!  I used a springform pan lined with parchment paper.  Instead of an actual water bath, I just put a pan with water in the oven on the lower rack.  Next time I make this I will make it low carb by using Splenda.  Should turn out the same!

I made this for a work potluck and it was definitely the star of the dessert table! Such a simple recipe, though I'm not sure of the significance of baking this while the pans are half submerged in water. I doubled the recipe and used two 8" pans instead of 10", and baked this for just over an hour rather than 45 minutes and it came out fantastic.

Amazing cake!  I made it with a girl from work who had never baked from scratch before.  It was so easy to make, and it was a hit at the office the next day.  Even the person who didn't like desserts raved about it!

This cake is definately a WINNER. My husbands comment was "now that's how to make a cake" and the kids adored it.  My 7 year old boy insists I teach him how to make it!  I actually just used a normal pan that I sprayed with cooking spray and then lined it with grease proof paper.  I immersed my springform pan in the water bath, and after watching the water seep through decided I would opt for the normal pan as I didn't want to risk water running into the mixture.  To those who didn't have success, I encourage you to not give up and have another go.  It's worth it!!

Excellent recipe, as good as any I've had at cafes and restaurants.  I've adapted the recipe to lower the cholesterol and its still the best flourless chocolate cake I've had, by replacing the butter with an equal amount of canola oil.

As the mom of a little boy with celiac disease, I am always looking for cake recipes without gluten.  This cake is great! Just perfect with a bit of unsweetened whipped cream, and everyone loved it... except my son.  It's probably too sophisticated for a four year old palate!

Incredible!!! So wonderful!  I made this for my hubby and I for Valentines Day. I used a pretty expensive brand of chocolate, but it was well worth it.
Only trouble I had was getting it out of the pan that baked it in, so I think that I will line the pan w/ parchment paper next time.

This is the first flourless chocolate cake I have made and everyone enjoyed it -- even people who usually do not eat dessert.  I used a springform pan, but next time I will use the regular 9 or 10 inch cake pan.  I lined the pan with parchment paper on the bottom but still had trouble getting the cake to release because of its density.  I also took a doilie and put it on top of the cake, sprinkled it with confectioner's sugar, and removed.  It gave the cake a very decorative/professional look.

Fabulously rich and satisfying! Definately needs to be served with a generous dollup of whipped cream to tone down and complement the chocolate. I also served with raspberry puree. Did have trouble getting the cake to unmold from the non-stick pan. I eventually gave up and cut slices from the pan.

This definitely depends on your fondness for a rich dessert.  I made it and it came out lovely, but to me, I felt like I was eating chocolate butter.  Too much of a good thing.

This is my new favorite dessert. I am serious about my chocolate and frequently disappointed that other desserts are not chocolately or rich enough.  Well this one is THE one!  I had to substitute for the bittersweet chocolate (had none) so found a suggestion online to use 2/3 as much unsweetened chocolate plus 2 tsp sugar per oz. I used all the eggs as written, but tempered them.  My butter was a little melty when added. The cake was tricky to get out of my 9” round uncoated pan even with Crisco and cocoa powder applied; will use springform pan next time.  We ate the cake with Cool Whip and topped with powdered sugar sprinkle and fresh raspberries.  Superb.  Definitely top of the line dessert.

Oh my. This was the best ever flourless chocolate cake. HOWEVER, much credit must go to Chef Guy, the chef who posted that he substituted some of the eggs for egg whites. Genius, simply genius. It came out silky, light, decadent and fabulous. I tried another recipe yesterday.....noooooo......don't do it. This is the bomb. Thanks, Chef Guy!

This cake is awesome. I originally made it in September and it was so good, then I froze the rest. So, now we’re in January, my husband surprised me and dug it out of the freezer and once thawed was even better than when I first made it! Almost like chili, maybe it’s better after it sits? Who knows, this cake is worth making!

I made it in a springform pan so needed to wrap the pan in tinfoil before the water bath, but it turned up perfect. 

A huge hit with my Gluten-free friends. Rich and dense, so only needed a sliver!

Super delicious! Easy to put together and always comes out perfect! Read all the directions, be sure to leave it in the pan in the refrigerator over night to set completely!
I have lost count of the times I have made this cake! Always a hit! The last time I made it, I placed it in a bed of slightly whipped sweetened whipping cream, then placed dots of sweetened red raspberries around the cake. Then using a toothpick draw a line through the middle of all the dots going in the same direction. Sweetly little hearts appear!!

Dense, creamy and delicious!  I had to make a couple of substitutions due to dietary restrictions, I used coconut cream (3 of the 5 oz cans, drained)instead of the butter, and coconut sugar instead of the cane sugar. I tempered the beaten eggs a bit with the melted chocolate before beating them in. I used the water bath and baked for 50 minutes, refrigerated it about 24 hours before serving.  Really great recipe!

I used this recipient as the "crust" for a vanilla cheese cake. It was AMAZING!! Just follow this recipe as written, while it begins to bake, mix your favorite cheesecake batter up in the mixer. Once the chocolate cake is mostly set, about 1/2 to 3/4 the way through the cook time. GENTLY spoon cheesecake batter on top and bake according to the cheesecake instructions. Cool it overnight and serve.

I made this cake twice in one weekend for 2 separate occasions using the same ingredients for both. 
Followed the recipe to the letter the first time but tweaked it the second time. Based on some reviewers' suggestions, I   cut sugar back to 1/2  and left out 2 Tbsp. butter. Oddly, the second cake was too cloying sweet. I can't explain why. Most people, including myself, didn't finish their small serving.  The first cake, following the recipe completely, was incredibly wonderful and no one left even a tiny piece on their plate.  My suggestion is, don't change anything!

Used coffee liqueur in place of water.

I make this fairly often. Usually I will add a little bit of liqueur  to it. It’s a wonderful cake except I wouldn’t really call it a cake. More like a fudge pie without the crust. It has a texture like a really nice truffle.

I've made this twice, and it always turns out delicious. This is a surprisingly easy recipe too.. I was expecting it to be much more challenging than it turned out to be. I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate, so I used unsweetened cocoa powder and melted it with the sugar. It worked like a charm, and the end results were fabulous. I only have two things to note. Make sure to beat the eggs REALLY well, and mix them into the chocolate smoothly. Otherwise you'll end up with little pockets of plain cooked egg in the cake. Also, this cake is much smoother and richer if you wait a day before serving.

Excellent & very rich, so a little goes a long way. Followed GuyChef recommendations and used off brand orange liquor, 3 eggs & 3 whites. I baked mine in 10 inch spring form pan lined with parchment paper greased on both sides. Removing it was easy & looked fine when I turned upside down on cake platter. Will make for next Passover & serve smaller slices with some fruit & whipped cream.

I have made this type of cake a long time ago but I was looking for an easy recipe for a party.  This turned out wonderful, everyone loved it. I did use coffee instead of water, it enhances the chocolate flavor. Added a bit of vanilla and I also cut the sugar because my chocolate was semisweet. I definitely prefer this cake at room temp, made it in the morning and served it that night, chilled it a little but not completley.  Thank you for your recipe, it's a keeper.

Great recipe! Made exactly as written except I used 3 3/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips instead as thats all I had in my pantry. I'm looking forward to trying another poster's recommendation to sub grand marnier for the water.

Just made this yesterday.  It was fantastic.  We really just loved it.  In an attempt at making it a little more heart friendly, I made these substitutions:  I used coconut oil in place of butter and coconut palm sugar for the sugar.  I also used 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites.  Put in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving.  It is just so delicious.

I found that this recipe produced the most incredible, dense, moist chocolate cake that I had ever eaten. My guests were "wowed". At least 8 people tried it and I stil have half the cake left, it was so rich, without being cloyingly over-sweet. However this was the cake that produced the 2nd time I tried. The first time, after following the recipe to the letter, I produced a cake that had the consistency of mousse. I was nearly impossitble to cut and by all looks and apperances was underdone. I tested my oven and found the temperature was correct. I decided to try again and made 2 changes, first I left it in for 55 minutes, after taking it out it still was not done, so I increased the temparature to 325 and put it in for another 5 minutes. This seemed to make the difference, it was still we in the center, but I left it on the counter for 30 minutes before putting in the refrigerator to chill (my 2nd change) and it receded a bit away from the edge of the pan during that time. That was the cake that wowed my guests and after 3 days is still moist. I will thru at least 2 hundred reviews looking for a similar problem and have found none so far. The only thing I can think of is that I used a dark colored Calphalon 9 inch round pan. I will use a silver colored pan next time, continue to let it sit for 30 minutes after coming out of the oven and see if that producres that same rich, dense, moist creation that came out of my oven several weeks ago.

I have made this cake multiple times. Great recipe, I took the advice from another review and used three whole eggs, and three egg whites. It's delicious, but it is very rich. I have been changing the type of chocolate I use, last time I used 8oz of unsweetened and the rest bittersweet, it taste like a dark chocolate truffle. Next time I will try 4oz unsweetened.  I would suggest this to anyone who likes chocolate, its a big hit with the whole family.

Chocoholics beware. You have met your match! I didn't have unsalted butter so I omitted the extra salt. A m a z I n g! I will make this again and again and again. 

Warning, don't lick the batter bowl or it will never it into the oven.

For me, it was way too rich. 

Aside from the mass amount of butter, the actual taste was spot on.

I've made the cake version a couple times, and folks loved it! But, it's so rich that it's hard to make the serving size work. So I tried making it in mini-muffin tins, and it works beautifully. I adjusted the cooking time to 25 minutes; the mini's won't look wet in the center, but don't worry about that. Also, I spray an ocean of non-stick spray in, even though the muffin tin has a coating. I let the mini's cool at least 30 minutes, then go around the edge with a butter knife or a mini icing spatula to loosen them.

These look really nice on a cake stand drizzled with raspberry puree and a puff of whipped cream. As others have said, you really need some tartness to balance the richness of the chocolate. The whipped cream is nice but not as necessary.

This is incredible!  It got rave reviews from everyone, even those not crazy about chocolate (me.) It's both elegant and easy and will definitely be on my family's special occasion list from now on.  I used butter that was perhaps a bit too soft and was afraid it would separate when I mixed in the syrup and melted chocolate, but it was fine.  My only suggestion is to make sure to use room temperature eggs and then temper them before adding to the rest of the ingredients.  Texture was silky smooth, the taste rich but not heavy, better than truffles!

Be sure to use the water bath - I did not and my cake cracked.  Still absolutely divine, but the small cracks were disappointing.  I wanted to lightly powder with powdered sugar, but ended up adding a strawberry topping instead. YUMMY!!!!!

Delicious and easy!  I get wow's aplenty whenever I make this, whether for my gluten-intolerant friends or any chocolate lover!  I use 18 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of bittersweet and pull back on the added sugar to 1/2 cup.  I did make the mistake of overcooking it once and it was dry and a bit grainy, so do leave some of the shine in the middle, as the directions note.  Thanks for an awesome go-to chocolate fix!

This is delicious, I have been buying one of these every year for over 10 years, never again. I did have 1 problem, while each bite was melting in my mouth i felt like little clumps were there but all I could see were a lot of small air bubbles. Any ideas why this happened?

Turned out well.  Didn't quite compare to PF Chang's dessert, but it was very tasty.  I agree that it was more of a fugdy brownie than a cake.

AMAZING.  Everyone at my dinner party loved it.  Not sure if "cake" is a good description.  It's very creamy and dense...almost like a brownie flavored truffle.  But it was seriously amazing!

Very rich but oh so good!  I made this for my gluten free daughter and she said she's tried other flourless cakes but this one was by far the best!  I would suggest making it in a spring form pan as it was very difficult to unmold out of a regular cake pan! I served it with fresh raspberries!

I just made this wonderful chocolate cake recipe for a co-worker's birthday. I changed the 3/4 cup sugar to 1/2 cup agave to help cut down the sugar. (he's borderline diabetic) And, I used 57% coco solid chocolate lacquer from the bulk section at WinCo. Everything came out great. It came out dense, but it easily cut with the edge of a fork. Not having a spring cake pan, I used a glass pie pan and sprayed pam in the bottom. To release the cake the next morning, I then put the pie pan over a pot of boiling water for 10 min. This melted the chocolate off the bottom glass and I inverted the cake onto a plate. The edges did have a small sloop from the pie pan form, but no one cared at all.

Served with ready whip and raspberry and orange jam. 

Now my wife is jealous and wants me to make it for her.

This recipe is perfect! I followed GUYCHEF's review from Jan. 10, 2005...sub water for Grand Marnier, used a spring form pan with parchment paper on the bottom, 3 eggs and 3 egg whites, heavy duty foil on the bottom to keep the water out, and I served with homemade raspberry sauce. Perfect perfect, it was a BIG hit at the family Christmas party (which is a big deal in a big Italian family)

For my first attempt I think it turned out pretty good. I didnt bother with the water bath and used strong coffee to replace the water. I used valhrona chocolate and needed to add a bit more sugar otherwise it would have been too bitter as others have experienced. I always cook by taste though so any recipe to me isnt set in stone. I crunched up an oreo pie shell and poured the batter over that for some texture. Next time I would use parchment paper to help ease it out of the pan. Calling it a cake is misleading though. Its more like a dessert that you would get in a fine coffee shop or cafe.

Super easy, was a hit .  I brought it to a party and came back with an empty plate.  Very rich and creamy, very much like a genache only much more dense.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made this cake I used semi sweet chocolate chips and a 10 inch springfoam pan, couldn't get the cake to come out of the pan in one piece.... Bummer! So I tried it again in a 9 inch cake pan, cooked it in water bath and also used milk chocolate chips. I love chocolate but not bitter or even semi sweet. After running a knife around the pan and using the parchment paper buttered well in bottom it came out great!
I think I should have baked it 50 or 55 minutes but it's still really creamy and think, just like a huge piece of fudge. :)
Keep it in the freezer and put whipped cream on it whenever I want a piece, which is everyday :) my daughter loved it and danced around the kitchen while eating her piece. Will absolutely make this cake ( fudge) again & again!

So amazingly good. I'd suggest using a mixer or food processor right before putting it in your cake pan because it was a tiny bit lumpy....but overall, the taste was flawless.

My friends all LOVE it when I bring this cake to our potluck dinners. I make it just as the recipe is written except I used a regular round cake pan lined with parchment paper (sprayed with PAM). Because I thought it could use some EXTRA chocolate, I topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze (recipe on this site). I highly recommend this cake!

I've made a couple of times too and tweak and modify it now and then.  Guests loved the taste of the one I made but dusted the pan with cinnamon (not cinnamon sugar).  Other tweaks:  a dash of cayenne mixed into the sugar; substitute vanilla with peppermint, almond, or hazelnut extract.  I am making it without the cocoa for a moister cake this time...substituted dark chocolate bar - giving it a little extra time.

Delicious, however, think of it as a truffle.  It's as rich as a tiny truffle, so cutting yourself a cake-sized piece of truffle is WAY too rich.  Everyone loved it and raved about it, but in the end, several could not finish their smallish piece of cake, even cutting it with whipped cream.  This is not an entirely bad problem to have, however.  I will make it again, but I will likely bake it in my mini cupcake pan next time.

This is amazing! As a nineteen year old college student, i'm eager to learn to make new dishes/desserts but always seem to ruin them. I decided to make this for a 4th of july sit down dinner with my family. The only change I made was using chocolate chips (1 1/4 cups) because I didn't have the bars. Very easy, and quick! I actually chilled it in the fridge right after it was done for about 45 minutes before serving it even though it says to leave it overnight. It was AMAZING, and had a more lighter mouse taste. My family all kept going "Wow!" with every bite. After chilling it overnight it had the very dense flourless chocolate cake taste I love. I'm not gluten allergic, but this is an amazing dessert that I actually prefer to regular chocolate cake. YUM.

I followed this recipe exactly using Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and liked it warm but refrigerated it overnight and served it with homemade coconut icecream yum! Have made it twice and would make this decadently rich cake again.  Was very nice with the icecream but served it with strawberries and it worked well too.   Its so rich it needs to be served with something to cut the heavy rich flavor fruit or icecream worked in my experience

Wow, this far exceed my expectations, even after reading all the great reviews!  We served it to a customer in our restaurant last night, and he said we've come up with a whole new texture.  It's somewhere between cheesecake and mousse I'd say; silky smooth.  I used 3 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips as I prefer it over bitter chocolate.  Absolutely divine, one of the best recipes I've found on this site.

Fantastic.  I made it exactly according to the recepie.Next time i will look for a smaller recipe that uses 12 ounces of chocolate. It was hard for me to find a pan that would accommodate a 10 inch pan for the water bath.

This was very good - everyone at my church and work loved it! I used xylitol instead of sugar and did not use water bath as I didn't have anything big enough. Also used 10" springform pan which made it easy to remove.

My personal opinion is it tastes better the next day. The only thing I might have changed is I might have accidentally added more chocolate than it calls for. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. People have been asking for the recipe!

Sooo yummy! Eighteen oz is a lot of chocolate and  this makes a very big cake. If you compare the ingredients to other flourless chocolate cake recipes on this site, it calls for much more chocolate than of the any others. But it's so good. I serve it slightly heated in the microwave with vanilla ice cream. Nice dessert to serve guests.

Wow!  This cake is absolutely amazing!  It is gourmet quality and turned out perfectly every time I made it, following the recipe exactly.  It was LOVED by all of our guests, both gluten free and not.  It has the consistency of cheesecake, and I served one with a raspberry sauce, one with caramel and toasted almonds, and another with whipped cream.  All were delicious!

Stunning!  I have adopted this as my go to recipe for my daughter's school's dessert auction.  It is so easy to make, can be dressed up with raspberries, a caramel drizzle, chocolate covered espresso beans, or holiday chocolate packages for variety.  It is always one of the top bids at the auction, and I get rave reviews.

Was happy to find this pretty simple recipe for my glueten free friend. It was simple and turned out delicious tho ugly. I LOVE the suggestion of small glass of port with it! YUM! I skipped the water bath, baked for 45 minutes and put it in the fridge immediately. It was NOT coming out of the pan no matter what I did, so I just sliced it and "scooped" it out onto plates. Everyone loved it! Made it for a casual family gathering so it didn't really matter what it looked like. If it were a more formal occasion I would have gone the whole nine yards; water bath, parchment paper, spring form, yada yada. But it was a bit last minute and who cares? Chilled for about 4 hours, had a smooth consistancy. Next time I will go the extra mile. Will also probably omit and egg or two. Baked in a 9" nonstick cake pan.Oh ya, I used one bag semi sweet chips and 3/4 bag milk, perfect! Also only had one stick butter, used cirsco to make up the difference. This is a very forgiving recipe!
UPDATE; second time around, same pan, did the water bath, used 3 eggs and 3 whites, one bag dark chocolate chunks and half bag semi-sweet chips, chilled immediately. Much prettier this time, a little bit smoother consistancy, but still not comin out of that pan! Well, it is, just not onto a serving platter, only onto my plate and into my mouth! Maybe a little better than the first try, either way still outstanding!

This was good, but not amazing. After a few bites, I realized that it was really just another version of Southern chocolate pie. Maybe this is silly, but I don't see the point of calling a pie a "cake." Would be excellent with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. I also think that next time I make this I will line the bottom of the pan with a chocolatey crumble crust (I'm not gluten intolerant).

Used 8 inch pan, 70% chocolate Lindt bars, cooked it for 50 min. Refrigerated overnight. Placed on counter for 2 hours before serving. Used thin knife in very hot water. Also used prepared espresso coffee that was left in our French press for the water. It was delicious. 4.5 Stars

Delicious! Halved the recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly. It was really rich so I only served small slices - three of us only ate a quarter of the halved recipe! Served with whipped cream and a tart raspberry coulis which complemented the cake perfectly. Highly recommended.

This tastes just like the flourless chocolate cake at Ruth's Chris (that they took off the menu, which is why I came looking for the recipe). I followed the recipe exactly, and got exactly what I was looking for.  Amazing!

Honestly it was great!  I did everything a reviewer named Wendy (2006) did, i.e., no water bath and use a springform pan, etc. and it turned out fabulous!  Even the pickiest chocolate snobs here loved it!  So read Wendy's review and do what she says and it will be perfect!

This was amazing! I sprayed a springform pan with olive oil and placed the water bath in the oven with it (but the pan itself wouldn't fit in the water bath). The cake was AMAZING! Rich, fudgey, and perfect. Served with raspberry sauce and homemade whipped cream (both recipes from this site, too).

I always make this when i have dinner parties, always a huge hit! I have to make sure the left over goes home with my guests or i will end up eating it myself! I use salted butter: that way i don't have to add salt into the cake batter and there is also less salt.

This was a big hit at our dinner party.  I substituted splenda for the sugar to make it more low carb friendly.  Noone could even tell even after I told them.  I topped it with whipped heavy cream.  My husband wants me to make this every week.

Delicious cake that looks impressive and taste like a fine restaurant's dessert.  Much like a truffle in consistency.  I added a raspberry sauce and whipped cream.  A tiny slice is all folks will be able to finish, so the cake goes a long way.  It will keep well for a day or two.

A bit too dense & rich for my liking. I've had other flourless chocolate cakes that seemed a bit lighter. I'll keep searching.

Yum!  Delicious and pretty easy.  Wish the directions had you prep the boiling water for the water bath beforehand - I had the cake all ready to go and then had to wait for water to boil.  I only had a 9 inch cake pan, so used that and then filled two little ramekins as well.  Still delicious if you don't chill overnight, but it will just be gooey and not cake-like at all.

I made this recipe exactly as the directions say. FANTASTIC! I put the "batter" in my 9" springform pan, and wrapped the outside of it in 4-6 pieces of foil so that the water bath didn't get in and spoil it. It was so good and fudgy!! I would recommend making a simple raspberry sauce as a counterpoint to the density of the chocolate. Warning: this recipe is highly addictive and you will find yourself thinking of this in the middle of the night.

This flourless chocolate cake is by far the best most decadent cake ever! I made this cake for my boyfriend for his birthday. He LOVED it. Now I used a 70% chocolate, I must say my boyfriend recently lost 100lbs so I didn't want to sabotage he goals. I used a sugar substitute as well as smart balance butter it was amazing you couldn't tell that these substitutions were made as we've had this cake in elegant restaurants. I also served it with a chocolate sauce I made from this site & whip cream. Next time I will try the espresso tip. This is a keeper!!

I followed the directions exactly and think it turned out well.  It was really rich & just melts in your mouth.  I served this with fresh raspberry sauce & whipped cream.  It's just almost too rich so I"m not sure how often I would make it.

This is divine!  I have made it three times now.  I have changed one thing:  Half the chocolate and added 1/2 cup of cocoa powder.  It is just a preference of a richer chocolate taste.  The original recipe is amazing as is.

This was fabulous.  We ate it as soon as it cooled.  I imagine once it hits the fridge it will change the texture somewhat.  Loved it.  Will make it again,  and again, and again...

You don't need to chill overnight!  Had a last minute birthday party this evening and started making the cake 2 hours beforehand.  It was excellent.  Had to make a few changes b/c I didn't have time for the store.   Had 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate in the house so I used the other 14 oz semi sweet chips.  Added only 1/2 cup sugar and used instant espresso for †he water.  Only sprayed the cake pan with oil, didn't use water pan. Cake was still warm when served.  Everyone loved it!   ps I am gluten free and that is why I chose this.  BUT, I was the only one, nobody even cared or asked if it was gluten free. Served 12 with ice cream.

This was a fantastic cake. I would definitely make it again. I did do some things differently, I used all semi-sweet chocolate and I baked it in a 9 inch pan for 10 minutes longer. I served it with a Port reduction sauce, fresh berries and whipped cream. My guests couldn't stop talking about it.

I chose this recipe because my daughter who was visiting from out-of-town is gluten intolerant, and everybody raved about it.  I followed the directions exactly as written and will make it any again for company. BYW-I've used this website for years and this is the first time I have reviewed a recipe.  Couldn't pass this one up!

All we can say is YUMMMY!  We made one change, used 1/2 cup sugar, it was a oversight the first time but did the second time as well, because it wasn't missed. If you are a true chocolate lover, this will simply be a slice of YUMMMY for you!! Would strongly suggest, you try this.  I used a 9" springform pan, which I greased & then lined bottom with parchment paper which I sprinkled cocoa over,  wraped the bottom of the entire 9" pan with tin foil to keep the bottom out of the water bath, one piece of the heavy would do.  I baked 10 min longer than recipe called for, every oven is different, it seems mine always requires this.  We have some friends we are serving this too ,one of them has celiac problems.

This is hands down my absolute favorite chocolate cake...ever! IMHO, there is not a flour cake out there that can compare to this recipe. Incredibly rich and flavorful, very smooth. Lends itself to tweaking by adding different garnishes. Gauranteed to impress your dinner guests, it's a fabulous way to end a meal!

This cake was fantastic.  I baked it in a 9 inch springform pan (my 10 inch wouldn't fit in my roasting pan for the water bath!) and had to bake about 10 minutes longer than instructed, but that could just be my oven.  Delicious, rich, and filling - I highly recommend.  P.S. We couldn't wait overnight to eat it and dug in about an hour after it came out of the oven - still delicious!

My sister made this for my grandma for our 4th of July cookout (can I review it??), I gave her the recipe, but I was making about 4 other dishes and asked her to make this one, she isn't on allrecipes, so I am reviewing it anyway!  My grandma LOVED it!  My grandma requested semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet, and I am glad we used that, but that's just a preference thing.  I would describe the consistency as more along the lines of a dense cheesecake than a cake.  It's VERY rich, and I would like to try to make into a smaller version (like mini muffin size) but that might be difficult.  This is still a great dessert for those on a gluten free diet!

this was great; I followed the directions exactly... except for chilling it overnight in the pan.  I was impatient and wanted it sooner, and it wasn't completely set.  My fault completely, but the taste is great!

This turned out perfectly!  I took the suggestion of using 1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 4 unsweeted baking squares.  I forgot to pick up butter at the store, but the margarine didn't ruin it at all.  Next time, I'll try real butter.  I served it for Mother's Day and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic!  Took one reviewer's advice and subbed Grand Marnier for the water.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to a "T" and baked in a 9" springform due to lack of a 10" pan.  Very rich, and was a big hit.  Served with fresh, slightly sweetened whipped cream to cut the richness a bit.
------------------------------
Update!  Have also made this with Framboise instead of the water--also fabulous!  Bake in a 9" springform and don't worry about the waterbath...just put a pan of water on the rack below the cake.

Decadent and rich!  We served it with homemade caramel sauce and toasted salted pecans.   I put my water bath in the oven as it preheated, then just lowered my cake pan into it once it was ready.

I have a couple friends who are allergic to gluten so this was the perfect cake! They all asked for the recipe after. I found that mine took longer to bake than the directions stated so, after 45 minutes I turned up the oven to 400 degrees to create more of a crust on the cake and left it in for about an hour and 5 minutes in total.

Wowee!  If I could shout from the roof tops about how good this is, I would!!!  :)  This is restaurant quality, lick-your-plate clean good!! A true chocoholics dream!  I found it to be a combination of a truffle/cheesecake/chocolate mousse extravaganza.  Very dense, very rich, very elegant - and extremely easy!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a spring form pan instead of a cake pan.  Came out perfect!!!  I found best served chilled.  Try it and enjoy!!!! You will not be sorry!  Thanks for my favorite new recipe!  :)

Excellent, just like I remembered it in a favorite restaurant.  I serve it with a little dollop of whip cream (whip to soft peaks with a little vanilla extract added) and some fresh raspberries.  You could easily add a cafe' twist & use espresso instead of water.  Don't be afraid of the loose center & fight the urge to leave it in longer.

Fabulous! I made this to take to my in-law's Thanksgiving dinner and everyone wanted the recipe.  The only change I made was to use half bittersweet and half milk chocolate - I was afraid the family might not like it w/all bittersweet.

I have made this twice and it was a HUGE success. My book club loved it which is why I plan to make it again for the meeting.  I followed  the suggestion to use ghitadelli chocolate chips. Did not use a spring form pan, justed sprayed a 10" round cake pan and placed a circle of parchment in the bottom.  I did use the water bath. Easy, impressive and delicious.

My brother-in-law is on a gluten free diet and has been bummed about not being able to eat dessert When I made this for Christmas he absolutely LOVED it. This will be my second time making it in one week. First time I tried making it with 4oz unsweetened chocolate squares and 12oz chocolate chips with 1/2 cup sugar. This time, since I am out of chocolate squares I'm making it with all chocolate chips and not adding any more additional sugar. I beat it longer and it looks a whole lot smoother. This is, from now on, my go to dessert. I LOVE IT!

This cake is incredible and totally gluten free for us Celiacs! 1)I made it with half milk chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips instead of the dark chocolate suggested. I like the lighter flavor of the other chocolates. 2)I cut the recipe in  half. This is too rich to have too much on hand. 3) I got scared as I added the sugar water that I had done something wrong because the chocolate and liquid were not mixing together well. Never fear! Keep mixing it suddenly smoothed out and mixed together perfectly. 4) I topped it with canned raspberries.

I made this for my son's first Communion party, and it was a HUGE hit. Tasted as least as good if not better than an upscale restaurant. I did use strong brewed coffee instead of water, 3 eggs and 3 egg whites, and a little less butter, per some suggestions, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I made a raspberry sauce from this site, and dotted each plate with it. Put fresh raspberries and whipped cream on top.  Not a big chocolate/fruit combo fan, but it was delicious for this cake. This one is a big keeper for entertaining!

people are still talking about this cake I brought to a Holiday Party 5 months ago!  It was pretty simple to make and drop dead delicious.  We served it with fresh raspberries and whipping cream.  It really needs the whipped cream to offset the richness of this dreamy smooth and super rich chocolatey cake!

This was really, really good!! Like a giant truffle! I just used a bag of Ghirardelli chocolate (18 oz) and it was easy to make. Everyone at work was asking for the recipe. I'm glad I made it.

Very chocolate-y and surprisingly easy to make. I did not use the water bath when baking, and it turned out fine. I used a spring form pan lined with parchment paper at the bottom. I just took off the sides to serve - made it very easy! I also heated some frozen raspberries and mashed them into a sauce to drizzle on top of the cake - it helped it from being too overpowering.

It's heaven for chocolate lovers! I made it twice for two parties and they were cleaned up quickly! It's not easy to un mould it though even though I greased, floured and also laid some baking sheet at the bottom and on the side. I put lots of fresh raspberries on top and served it with fresh whipped cream and raspberry coulis. Wonderful!

I've been looking for a flouless chocolate cake recipe forever, and they always turn out to be disappointing. Not this one- melts in your mouth! I brought it to work and it was gone within an hour (at 9 AM- not exactly chocolate time). I've had people raving about it ever since. Thank you!!!

I have not tasted it yet. My butter was cold and the "batter" ended up being more like a heavy whipped cream rather than a batter. The butter pieces took a long time to mix in.

Unbelievable.  Cooked this for my wife on our first married Valentine's Day.  Followed the suggestion to use 3 eggs and 3 egg whites.  As other reviewers, I used a spring form pan wrapped in foil and set into the water bath.

I melted the butter like chocolate flourless cake II said to do. I didn't have a double boiler so I just put all the chocolate squares & the butter in a bowl and melted in the microwave, but make sure to check it often cause I put it in there too long the first time and somehow burnt the chocolate.

I LOVE chocolate, and this was a bit much for me. Tiny slices are best & would serve many more than recipe states. I served with raspberry puree and whipped cream. I prefer molten chocolate cake or traditional chocolate cake to this. Cut into tiny squares, these taste just like truffles!

This is an incredible recipe. Ironically, my first time making it was practically a disaster. Firstly, as per other reviewers that's 18oz of chocolate... careful of 18 x 0.5oz squares trap - that'd be wrong :). Thankfully spotted that in the nick of time. Second, attempts to melt the chocolate in my new microwave - aka nuclear reactor - ended up with me fishing a couple of burned chunks out. Settled on using a Pyrex jug suspended in a pan of simmering water to resurrect... much better. Despite these pitfalls the result was amazing, with guests describing it as "restaurant quality". Followed the recipe pretty much to the letter; only change was 1 tsp vanilla essence added.

This cake is seriously rich.  I baked it in individual ramekins and piped the peanut butter mousse from "No Bake Peanut Butter Pie."  Incredible.  Next I think I'll swirl a raspberry topping on top before baking.  Definitely one to impress the inlaws.

I followed the recipe, and found the end result not to be a cake-like at all, but like chocolate truffle-ish. If I made it again, I would line the bottom with parchment paper, as it took a lot of effort for it to come out in one piece. Tastes great, but somewhat a disappointment.

This was good.  Fairly easy to make.  It had a liquid center though and I would have liked it to firm up just a bit more so maybe need to bake it longer.  When I put it in the fridge, it firmed up and could heat it up to get it back to the original consistency.

The only flourless chocolate cake recipe you will ever need.  I made this for a baby shower, and everyone was shocked to hear that I made it.  It was described as "restaurant quality" by many people.  I used a 9.5 in. springform pan, and it worked great.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Pretty good, as far as gluten-free recipes go. I think I may have overbeaten the batter a little. I needed a lot more cake pan space than I thought I would. With the overbeating, this turned out more like a souffle than a cake. I served it with raspberries or cherry pie filling and whipped cream and it was well recieved by my guests. We all ate one very thin slice and agreed it was very rich. I may make this again, but I will put it all in ramekins. I have made better gluten free "cake" recipes than this one though, if you want a true cake.

I made this for a family gathering because a relative is allergic to wheat,corn and rice. It was a hit, and I was asked for the recipe so the allergic person could make it again. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chips and it was just fine, but I think you could use semisweet if bitter chocolate is too much for you. I wouldn't try it with milk chocolate, too mild. I used a square 9" brownie pan, it was very easy to cut into servings, and served sweetened raspberries and a meringue cookie on the side.

This cake was a hit with the family and easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe except I did not have enough bittersweet chocolate so I used 8 ounces of semisweet and 10 ounces of bitter sweet.  I also make a raspberry sauce to drizzle over the cake.

Just made this weekend for a family get together.  Everyone loved it!!!  I used the Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips and freshly brewed coffee instead of water. I used a nine inch springform pan and increased cooking time by 5 minutes. It turned out perfectly.  We ate it without any toppings and it was incredibly creamy.  Very easy and will make again.

I added a little bit of nuts on top and it was very good. You can put caramel sauce, chocolate sauce or raspberry sauce on top to decorate. Even the ones who can tolerate gluten/flour enjoy this cake very much.

This was incredibly rich. ItI made it for a bachelorette party for a girl who can't have gluten. She and another gluten-free guest enjoyed it, but couldn't eat a whole slice because it was so rich. I used baker's chocolate as the recipe said and it had a very bittersweet taste, even after I tripled the sugar! Maybe there was something wrong with my chocolate. I topped it with frosting made from semisweet chips. I had one bite and it was too much chocolate for me, but other guests (even those who can have gluten) raved about it.

Even with 2 possible cake ruining events this turned out really well for me.  It sat on the counter for about 15 minutes before going inthe oven, AND the spring form I used leaked water in to the pan (yes I wrapped it with 3 layers of foil, still leaked).  I served it with homemade whipped cream & fresh strawberries.  Only one person didn't like it, but he admitted he's more of a white chocolate person (um, hello, there's no chocolate in white chocolate.)  Definitely use good quality chocolate, I used Ghiradelli & just melted it in the microwave, also just microwaved the water & dissolved the sugar & salt in that.  Good advice to use a knife dipped in warm water to cut, makes very clean & neat slices.

Tasted like very rich fudge, you can only eat a little. Everyone at the party loved it. I followed the suggestion of 3 eggs and 3 egg whites. Emeril’s Raspberry Coulis and vanilla ice cream made a fantastic topping.

It's a little too fudgy and dense for my taste, but it was still very delicious. When I served it, quite a few asked for seconds which is a good sign. Give really thin slices, too, as this cake is quite powerful.

The Starbucks junkies among us may remember that the company sold a decadent drinking chocolate a few years back (known by many names, including chocofino).  This is that beverage in cake form.  It has a sublime chocolate taste and a smooth texture that melts in your mouth.  It's like eating chilled brownie batter.  WONDERFUL.  Some things to note, most in recap what others have said: 1) use soft, room temperature butter; 2) use three eggs, and three additional egg whites; 3) springform pan w/ freezer paper works VERY well.  4) This is so rich, a little goes a long way.  A 9" springform pan would likely satisfy 15-20 people.  5) Have coffee or a cup of milk ready before serving. :)  Enjoy! This one's most definitely a keeper.

I made this for Valentine's as noted in recipe.  I used 12 oz. Baker's chocolate and 6 oz. Ghiradelli.  I did not think it was sweet enough, had to add lots of whipped cream to get down a small slice.  It was very rich and heavy.  My husband is a dark chocolate lover and really liked it, along with our guests.  I need more sugar, little less chocoloate, maybe less dense.

This is the best flourless chocolate cake ever!!!  I went to a restaurant opening in NY when I first tried this cake.  This is a recipe that will get you noticed for making something so elegant and tasty.  Most people I have come acrossed have never tasted anything like it.  It even wins over anyone that says they don't like chocolate cake....YUM

This cake was absolutely the BEST chocolate cake I've ever eaten or made, and that's saying a lot since the only thing I like better than baking desserts is eating chocolate. I made this for Christmas and it was a huge success. My husband couldn't stop eating it or talking about it. This has definately become a staple in my recipe box!

I think this would be better if you used a ratio of 2:1 semi/bitter.  However, this recipe was very easy to make.

Bubba Gumps serves a flourless chocolate cake like this one, and they cook it in  mason jars and then add icecream, raspberry sauce and whip cream. It was out of this world.

I made this last night for our guest who can't have gluten.  What a hit!  I made a few changes of my own.  I used unsweetened squares so increased the sugar by 1/2 cup and the water by 1/4 cup.  I took the advice offered and used 3 eggs and 3 egg whites.  I did not cook it in the bath and it turned out perfect.  I also heated each slice for 15 seconds in the microwave and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Delish!  The major change i did to the recipe was to add a shortbread crust.  I made it with gluten free flour (rice flour), brown sugar, butter and pecans.  I baked it first and then put in the chocolate mixture.  The crust offered up a little bit of crunch and color to the plate.

Will definitely make again!

Great recipe.  I used 12oz semi-sweet chocolate chips and 8oz Nestle's bittersweet chocolate. Using a springform pan worked well, but 3 layers of heavy duty foil is a must.  I had water seep in all the way to the layer closest to the pan but no water made it's way into the cake.  Took quite a while to incorporate all of the butter since it needs to added a little at a time.  Might be because I used a hand held mixer.  Easy and delicious.

This recipe is a great diving-off point for a killer desert.  Because I was cooking dinner for a 12-person family dinner that included young kids, I replaced the bittersweet chocolate with a 50-50 blend of dark (Nesstle Premium Baking Bar) and semisweet chocolate (Ghiradelli morsels).  I also cut the water by half and replaced the balance with raspberry liquer (I may try amaretto or Grand Marnier next time).  Chilled, the finished product is fudge-like, but I chose to let it sit at room temperature while we ate, then warmed it in the oven for 5-10 minutes.  It softened to something between fudge and custard, and I served slices with French Vanilla ice cream on top and berries on the side.  *** As a previous reviewer said, use a good deal of heavy-duty aluminum foil around the panto ensure you don't get seepage in the water bath!!

Absolutely the best "Death by Chocolate" EVERY.  No one will believe that it is Kosher for Passover.  Switch the butter with margarine and enjoy your Seder.

Not many bittersweet fans in my circle, so I made with semi-sweet and a great result.  Its like a giant truffle and the flourless cakes are my favorites, even from before me having celiac's disease.  GREAT!

This is rich but, in my opinion, not cloying or heavy. I followed GUYCHEF's advice and served after nuking each slice for 10-15 secs, topped with raspberry sauce and whipped cream. It was a total hit. The raspberry sauce was more difficult to make than the cake. I used water but any flavored liquor would probably be good (kahlua, amaretto, chambord, grand marnier, etc.). Enjoy!

This was incredible.  It was very rich and moist.  I did mix bittersweet & semi-sweet chocolate and I topped it with peanut butter icing although it did not need it.  Hands down this will be the birthday cake of choice in our family, thank you for sharing!

absolutely amazing.  if you 'like' chocolate, but don't 'LOOOOOVE' chocolate, it may be a little too intense.  i did make two minor changes per several people's advice.  instead of 18 oz of bittersweet chocolate, i used 4 oz of bittersweet and 14 oz of semi-sweet.  and instead of using 6 whole eggs, i used 3 eggs and 3 egg whites.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!!  This cake was so smooth, so creamy and SO full of chocolate... it was incredible.  I took the advice of others and used 5 oz. of bittersweet bakers chocolate and 13 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate chips and also used 3 eggs and 3 egg whites instead of 6 full eggs.  This has a few extra steps, but it still isn't terribly hard and the final product is well worth it.  I can't wait to take this to a family event and "wow!!" everyone.

WOW.  I was looking for a special cake to make for my best friend's birthday, as she has become allergic to gluten.  This cake was so rich and sinfully good that my friends though it was a chocolate truffle cake from a fancy restaurant until I showed them the recipe!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, used 12 oz. of semi sweet chips and 6 oz. of unsweetend bakers chocolate, and used orange juice instead of water, and it turned out FABULOUS!  This one will now be a must for any special occasion.  THANKS!!!

This cake is great! I've made it a couple of times and it always turns out great. I followed another reviewer's advice and replaced the water with Gran Marnier (even better than OJ) and the zest of an orange. Also, I've not seen bittersweet chocolate in my grocery store, so I use six ounces of unsweet chocolate and 12 of semisweet. I also dip my knife in hot water and wiping it before cutting each piece.

YUMMMMM!!!  Loved this!  Made this for my mom for Mother's Day (she's another true chocoholic) and we were in heaven!  Very rich and creamy.  I used about 1/3  semi-sweet chocolate and was glad that I did.  I baked this in a springform pan and wrapped foil around the bottom edge to keep out the water bath.  Had NO problem getting this out of the pan that way.  WARNING: some people may find this to be "too rich" or "too sweet".  I made a cherry crumb pie to satisfy these "wimps" so they were happy.

WOW. Not too hard to make and was fantastic! I made it in a cupcake tray, same cooking time, and it turned out great. Also mixed in a few tablespoons of peanut butter which added a gret kick and it still set well. Substituted margarine also for some lactose-intolerant eaters, and it was still fabulous!

What a great recipe, made this for my future in-laws and it was a huge hit! They're still talking about it months later. I also lined the pan with parchment paper like others suggested. And I used half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chocolate. Love this cake!!

This cake was a hit for a birthday party! It is so rich that a little goes a long way. Great with a fresh cup of coffee. The first time I made it I found the recipe the day I needed it. So, it did not chill as long as recomended. It wasn't set quite as well, but it worked fine. No one cared because it was so delish!

Excellent cake that I made for a friend with celiac.  I added orange juice and zest from an orange instead of water like someone suggested and served it with whipped cream.  Comments were that it tasted like a Terry's chocolate orange egg.  A very rich cake so only a small slice will do.

This cake was amazing! Super easy to make too!   We made a whipped cream for the top of the cake with a touch of raspberry/strawberry/blueberry coulis in it.  Then we served it with the coulis drizzled on the bottom of the plate. Tasted just like a truffle!!!!!

I made this for a friend at work who couldn't eat wheat and It was a huge hit! Everyone thought it tasted like chocolate cheesecake! I added fresh raspberries and some powdered sugar on top. Yummy!! A spring form pan is a must!

This is a great recipe. I used a package and 1/3 of semi sweet chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. I don't think it needs any sort of topping at all, it is so rich and sweet. Definitely a dessert for a crowd because of this. I'll make it again. It is like something you would get in a restaurant.

Amazing!  This "cake" was more like a Godiva truffle!  This is a chocolate cake for adults.  You have to love bittersweet chocolate, which I adore.  I recommend using the springform pan wrapped in foil someone else suggested, and parchment paper to line the bottom.  Also use a good quality chocolate.  I even put a chocolate glaze on top to give a finished look.  Make sure you cut it into at least 16 slices---it is incredibly rich.  Thank you, Maggie.

This is super rich, but a nice once a year kind of treat!  Made it for my friend's Seder and they all really liked it.  It's kind of the consistency of chocolate mousse, but more dense.  Although they thought it tasted like brownie batter.  I used semi-sweet chocolate by mistake, but it tasted good anyways.  Also used a 10" spring-form pan which helped in getting this tricky cake out of the pan!

Wonderful and so easy to make.  I had more success preparing it in a heavy saucepan on very low heat, to keep the chocolate melted while I added the butter.  I served it with a strawberry sauce and fresh whipped cream.

Very tasty. A little fudgy, and so it was very, VERY heavy. I made it for a couples evening, and only the guys were able to finish their slices. Speaking of the guys, they LOVED it.

This is easy to prepare, and the results are fantatsic.  Use the best chocolate you can find.  I served it with fresh whipped cream and sliced strawberries.  It's VERY rich, so a little goes a long way.

Made this cake in a springform pan. Used 8 oz Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate squares and 10 oz semisweet chips. Put pan of boiling water in the oven on the rack below the cake. Served with vanilla ice cream. The cake was delicious.

I made this for a friend’s birthday dessert. I would definitely make it again. Very easy recipe and ingredients you typically have on hand if you bake. I used a 10 inch spring form pan and it turned out great. I was afraid it wouldn’t be ready in time ( only had 4 hours to chill)
So I put it in the refrigerator and then in the freezer for a while and back in the refrigerator before serving. It worked and I was pleased !

OH MY GOSH, this is wonderful. I read 3-4 of the most helpful reviews and watched the video. Had to use a 9" springform, so I baked 5-10 minutes longer. 

Followed the the directions exactly as written, using a hand mixer. 

This recipe is a keeper.

Turned out delicious!! I made it almost exactly as instructed. I couldn’t find 1 ounce squares anywhere, so I bought 2 10oz bags of  bittersweet chocolate chips. Having the extra 2 oz of chocolate didn’t seem to make a difference. I didn’t have a cake pan, so I used an 8x8 Pyrex baking dish instead. I also only have regular egg beaters. The only problem was, when I flipped it over, the bottom middle was still runny. I put it in the oven on low broil, and that seemed to cook it. (Since it’s square, I haven’t cut into the middle yet, so I’m not positive, but I won’t really mind a gooey mess, anyway) I poured homemade raspberry freezer jam over the top. Next time maybe I’ll try mint or espresso flavor. I wonder if substituting coffee for water would taste good

I make this for every special occasion! Super rich and creamy. I use ghiradelli bittersweet chips, I use 2 full bags (20 oz minus a few for my kids to nibble on) because it’s easier than getting the kitchen scale out ;-) I usually sub the brewed coffee left from that morning in my carafe for the water. Make sure the chocolate is really warm and runny because it will be easier to mix the butter in if it doesn’t firm up as you are mixing. I top with lightly sweetened whipped cream. I use a springform pan. Definitely make the day ahead so you have plenty of time for it to chill. Soooooo good!

Baked this twice in a row.  I used the dairy-free bakers chocolate for my dairy allergy people, 56% cacao.  Used Crisco instead of butter and added a touch extra water.  I cut out 2 of the egg yolks and whipped the whites.  Did not use a water bath but baked at 275 instead.  I only had a 9" pan which seemed fine.  Turned out great.  Super chocolatey and smooth. To cut into pieces without crumbling I used a hot chef's knife run under hot water between each slice.

Was a hit at tonight's dinner. Used 18 oz of Giradelli chocolate chips...60% bittersweet chocolate. It was done with only 5 hours in the fridge. Sprinkled some powdered sugar and decorated with a raspberries. But it is so rich that I have half left over. Can't do this too often. Next time I might half the recipe.

This is my go-to chocolate torte-like cake. I have made it at least 30 times over the last decade. Sometimes I sub coconut oil for the butter. I use one circular pan or  two loaf pan. I split the mixture into two loaf pans, bake, cool, refrigerate overnight and then slice into pieces that are approx 2 inches square. I put the pieces into several ziplock bags or containers and then freeze them.  

The individual portions defrost quickly or can be heated in the microwave and served with a simple vanilla ice-cream.

I made this cake completely like the directions and the family said it like a restaurant quality version.  Very rich, chocolatey, creamy and delicious.  Unfortunately, I dusted it with cocoa, rather than confectioners sugar, and that was terrible without whipped topping.  Dust with confectioners sugar, not cocoa.  This is a keeper.

Spectacular in taste and consistency and appreciated by everyone I shared it with. It was a little difficult to turn out of the pan and to cut and serve, but it was very forgiving in being remolded when it got damaged, and no one seemed to mind how it looked once they tasted it! Served with icing sugar and raspberries. Very rich and decadent.

I've made this recipe many many times and everyone LOVES it! I usually just use half semisweet chocolate chips and half bittersweet chocolate, but I've also tried all semisweet and it's still great. This is now one of our family favorites.

This cake received rave reviews, from the lucky ones who had a taste.  (It brought it to a potluck party of 100).  One change...I substituted Kahlua for the water.   I didn't have time to refrigerate overnight.  Instead, I cooled on counter for 30 minutes,  put in refrigerator for 30 minutes, then put in freezer for 10 min.  The center was still pudding like, the edges firmer.  But the texture difference made it even more special!

Absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Smooth, creamy and very rich chocolate flavor.  I did use 1/4 cup coffee and 1/4 water (for the 1/2 cup water).  Another review recommended parchment in bottom of pan.  I will try it without next time - and oh yes, you can bet I'll be making this delicious cake again! - because I had trouble getting the cake to release.  If no parchment, I think the cake would have come out easier after placing in hot water for a few minutes before turning out.

I have made this recipe several times!!  It is awesome no changes needed!!  I made the mistake of not paying attention to the type of chocolate I bought this time :( Ghirardelli chocolate  Unsweetened is not the same as bittersweet!!  One of the reviews comments were that there cake turned out buttery and grainy, that is why!!  A very unfortunate expensive mistake :(

I made this EXACTLY as directed, with the exception that I used Kahlua instead of water because, why not? Also, since I serve as suggested with fresh raspberries and compote, the cake needs no fruity flavor from any liquor. Because it is so rich, I had enough for my contribution to a potluck and also for my book club. My husband (who ate more than his fair share at the potluck) begged me never to make it again as he couldn't resist it. Even my calorie-conscious sister ate the whole piece with relish. The members of the book club all wanted the recipe, as well as several people at the potluck. Pricey ingredients but way easier than slogging through cookie baking.

A delicious cake, very rich & dense. I served it with homemade whipped cream. I also did not read the directions prior to making it and did not realize it had to sit overnight. I served it 6 hours after making it and it was delicious.

I made this and it didn't look good. The taste was okay, but it was grainy and lumpy. It was very watery. I am sorry for being so negative, but I wouldn't suggest it.

This was completely amazing. Best served with whipped cream and berries to balance the richness - cut small slices - a little goes a long way!!! Guests exclaimed with delight at the first bite.  The second time I replaced the water with espresso - elevated to another dimension.

This cake is a winner every time! I pair it with raspberries and a dusting of powdered sugar and it looks elegant. What I love is that I can/must do it ahead of time.

Very rich - almost fudge consistency. Great with whipped cream and berries. I made once with Swerve instead of sugar for my Keto pals - well received.

This was a hit at the holiday get together. Everyone was on a gluten free diet. Needless to say when they had a piece of this cake with the homemade raspberry sauce, they were delighted! Everyone loved this recipe. Cut small pieces, this cake is rich!

Made it just as written but did add 1 tsp. vanilla...served with homemade vanilla ice cream...it was a hit...wanted something both gluten free & that could be served for Passover. They loved it so much  I have been asked to make it for Easter also.
will serve with homemade whipped cream... it is so rich that it does need something with it & as was written by others, cut in small pieces... I will pre cut when taking it for the holidays, don't want it to get wasted.

I needed a cake I can bring to Passover for my mother’s birthday. This recipe is amazing! Tastes unbelievable, and it’s easy to make. Better than the gourmet bakery bought equivalent. Will make it this year and for many to come!

Very good, used semi sweet chocolate as the only bittersweet I could find was $3 for 4 ounces.

Topped with a chocolate ganache

Delicious indulgence. Used a 9” pan instead of the 10”, and it turned out insanely delicious. Served it at a dinner party last night and everyone was crazy happy. I did not use the raspberry nor the cream- just sprinkled with confectioners sugar for presentation. I will be doing this again. Thanks for the scrumptious recipe!

I added a teaspoon of vanilla during the blending process, which really came through in the finished product. This is a very rich, creamy, and indulgent treat. It's by no means a "gluten-free" type of cake--it stands alone without any qualifiers. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe to a T, yet it turned out awful. After it was chilled and I took it out of the pan, I noticed the cake had a gelatinous texture. It tasted so heavily of eggs even though i put in the proper amount. After spending so much time on it, unfortunately had to be thrown away as it was inedible.

I've been making this recipe for the last few years now. I cook and bake for a very large family, some of which are diabetic. I have been able to substitute Splenda, along with a mix of bittersweet and 70%  cocoa bars, without any problem into this recipe to allow for everyone to have a very delicious dessert treat!

I did it following everything exactly and it's amazing!! Its true that the cake has a very gourmet taste while its easy to do, Loved it! 

I did it in round mini-cake moldes and served each on top of a layer of cream anglaise then  toped everything with pistachios, mint and albahaca. It was a perfect mix!!

This cake is so decadent! I had a chocolate craving and decided to give this a try. The process of beating butter and eggs into chocolate was very therapeutic.  I didn't have any issues with the eggs cooking because by the time I got to that part the chocolate was all cooled down. The one near-disaster i had came when i put the spring form cake pan i was using into a hot water bath. I thought it would be watertight, but it definitely wasn't! The finished product reminds me of a chocolate cheesecake. SO. DELICIOUS! I will be making this again!

Followed recipe exactly. Put a pot of boiling water in the oven under it rather than placing the springform pan in the water to avoid water leaking into pan. Served with strawberries and whipped cream on the side. Made for 12 ladies, only one of whom is gluten free. Everyone raved about it.  I will make it again. Came out like a rich dark chocolate cheescake. Used Ghirardelli bittersweet 60% chocolate chips.

The only change I made to the recipe was to use half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate baking squares/chips so that the cake would be sweeter. I followed all the steps to a T. The cake would not bake. Over an hour and a half later the cake was still pretty much raw batter. I think the baking temperature should be much higher... is the 300 degree Fahrenheit temperature a typo? This was a huge waste of my time and expensive chocolate. It was meant to be a birthday surprise for a friend who is gf. Very disappointing.

This was my first time making any flourless cake.  The taste was spectacular, but ti did not turn out for me.  I'm certain that I mixed too fast for too long.  Once in the oven my batter overflowed into the water in the pan and made a mess.  I salvages what i could, but it never quite set, and ended up an ugly (but tasty) mess.  I will be trying this again - with, perhaps, a little less enthusiasm on the mixer.

I am giving this one star mostly for the complicated preparation, with the use of a second pan larger than my cake pan to bake it in.  It is partially my fault for not reading through the entire recipe before making it, but it would have been nice for that pan to be mentioned in step one.  I ended up putting too much boiling water in the larger pan and the water got into the cake batter.  With some difficulty I was able to remove the cake pan from the boiling water and  then siphon the water off with a turkey baster.  The end product was not bad, but it was too much of a hassle to make.

Best flourless chocolate cake ever! I substituted the bittersweet chocolate squares for semisweet chocolate chips and it turned out quite well. I also dusted the inside of my pan with cocoa powder after having greased it to facilitate easier removal and give it a nicer crust.

It was delicious . Very rich and chocolaty. My only problem was I couldn’t get it out of the pan in the morning. I forgot to put one egg in, so don’t know if that would have made the difference . But when we cut it in the pan, it came out very nice. Everyone loved it and it was pretty easy to make. I will make it again. Maybe use parchment paper next time.

We loved it! I followed several reviewers' suggestions and they worked brilliantly:
1. Lined my springform pan with buttered parchment paper.
2. Tempered the whisked eggs with some of the hot sugar mixture.
3. I made sure the butter was warm and mixed it into the chocolate while it was still sitting in the double boiler. I made a similar flourless cake and didn't remember to warm up the butter first. It was a disaster! The chocolate curdled and I had to throw out the whole cake.
4. I didn't have 18 oz of bittersweet chocolate, so I used one bag (12 oz) of semisweet chocolate chips and an entire bar (8 oz) of Baker's unsweetened chocolate, and it still turned out beautifully.

I would definitely recommend this for a large crowd. Serve with berries and coffee and you've got a rich dessert!

Super good. Used orange liqueur instead of water. Need to bake it the full amount of time. I was nervous about overcooking & it was a little too soft, even after all night in the fridge.

I decided cutting pats of butter wasn’t necessary so I melted butter and 18 oz choc tog on low while stirring. I used bakers semi sweet but u could use chips. Added teaspoon of expresso crystals to syrup. Put choc mixture in bowl and beat with hand mixer a few minutes.  Beat in syrup. By this time mixture was cool  enough to beat in eggs one at a time. If not, wait a few minutes. I forgot the water for bath had to b boiling so my batter sat while I did that. So I gave it a quick beat before pouring into prepared pan. I used 10 in springform with outside covered in aluminum and up over rim. Batter will not come to top. I buttered bottom then laid parchment then buttered parchment. Batter will have a few bubbles but dont worry. I baked as directed and my center looked wetter than sides but not giggly. I was worried it would b dry but it was perfect. Sliced strawberries and cool whip finished it off.

This is the easiest and most consistent flourless cake recipe I've used. I have had a couple booboos. Always because I didn't follow the directions exactly right; too much water in the outer baking pan did not let the cake get hot enought to cook all the way through. Miscalculating the amount of chocolate (I added 10oz  oo much) made it candy-bar firm. They were both still very eatable. The only thing I do add is some Mexican vanilla. This cake has great texture and the flavor is whatever chocolate you choose to use.

This received rave reviews from friends and co-workers. I have a friend with Celiac which lead me to find a dessert we could have with her for her birthday. Las year, I made one using almond flour, but this year I tried this one. I served it with raspberry sauce, shaved dark chocolate, and real whipped cream.

I bake for people and I'm always looking for something new, easy to make & serve, and taste fantastic.  This recipe filled the entire requirement bill.  It's so rich tasting, that I bet this 10" cake will easily serve 15.  I tried it because the one commenter is a caterer.  I personally wouldn't bill it as a flourless choc cake, but rather a fudge cake w/glutton free in ( ).   Try it!

Amazing and delicious! I made it exactly as directed except for using salted butter (it was what I had available) so I just cut the salt amount in half. I served it with fresh whipped cream and received rave reviews from all who ate it. After  cooking the sugar water mixture, I allowed it to cool while melting the chocolate. By the time I was done adding the butter and then adding the sugar water to the chocolate, the mixture was just slightly warm so there was no issue adding the eggs. Will definitely be making again!

Needless to say for those inheriting a good dose of common sense, do not use a springform pan. The cake looks decent but there is water inside and moves when I move the pan. It’s baked, there’s just water inside. I’ll shove it into the fridge for a few hours and pray that it’s delicious afterwards and the water didn’t do too much damage. If it turns out alright I’ll change this review or post another one or whatever allrecipes lets you do.

I've been making this recipe since it first came out in Bon Appetite and it is always a hit.  I've use all types of chocolate from Trader Joes 72% to Nestle's chocolate chips, it's always a hit.  I make it even more chocolately by pouring a chocolate ganache over the top:  1 cup heavy cream and 8 oz of semi-sweet chocolate, heat the cream and whisk in chopped chocolate.  Because it is so rich in flavor I have a lot left over.  This cake freezes beautifully.

People loved it so much, that I didn't even get a chance to taste it! It was soft and gooey on the inside and tasted like a chocolate bomb (or so I hear...)!

Perfect for those with dietary restrictions! I made this for my sisters birthday, she is diabetic and avoids all grains and sugars. I used xylitol instead of sugar and it turned out perfectly! I also added a bit of orange zest to the hot sugar water and that gave the cake a beautiful citrus flavor. I topped it with whipped cream with a touch of almond extract and candied ginger (again using xylitol) and the bit of spice and crunch that added made this a too die for cake. One party guest offered to pay me to make this for her next party, it’s that good!

This was a really good cake. I made it as a birthday cake for my best friend and she loved it. I couldnt find bittersweet chocolate at the store so with some research i bought 70% dark chocolate. I followed the instructions as it was and it turned out really well. I double broiled the chocolate not microwaved it. When the butter had to be mixed i made sure it was well blended before adding another one. I think it could use maybe 40 min and it would have turned out fine. I covered it with a foil overnight. It definitely needs some sauce or drizzle on top of the cake. The cake alone doesnt look very pretty to serve but inside the cake it was very smooth and tasted expensive. Just be warned this chocolate is very sweet.

I made this for my husband for our anniversary dinner and it was an absolute success! He said it was the best meal he had ever had in his life! Wow! It was truly amazing!
I did run short on chocolate, as the packages here in Canada come in smaller oz sizes I believe. I was short about 4 oz, but I had 4oz of unsweetened chocolate on hand (I normally eat sugar free), so I used that to get to the quantity of chocolate needed. Since I read a few reviews that stated it was a tad sweet, I opted to leave the sweetener as is, even though I was using a few squares of unsweetened chocolate. It turned out absolutely perfect!

I also used a springform pan in order to be able to remove it easily. I used a small pan, so the cake ended up deeper than in the recipes. I added about 15 minutes of baking time in the waterbath. I used a 6inch springform pan.

I made this as written, except that I sent other people to the grocery and they came back with Ghirardelli bittersweet chips instead of squares. It worked just fine! We drizzled with a cherry-rum sauce and served with a dry red wine. Decadent and delicious.

I did as other said and used 3 whole eggs and 3 egg whites instead of 6 whole eggs. I substituted strong brewed dark chocolate flavored coffee for the water. Cooked exactly 45 minutes in a water bath as stated in the directions. Perfect!!! I glazed it with a dark chocolate mirror ganache and garnished the sides with toasted almonds. Served with light  french vanilla ice cream.  The ice cream cut the richness of the chocolate.  Made for my husband's birthday. It was a big hit.  Very easy to make.

I've made this cake at least 10 times and is a huge hit with family and friends and always gets rave reviews. We are not gluten free, it's just that delicious. It is more like a truffle in texture and quite dark chocolate, which I love. I've made it in a spring form (wrap in foil) and in a basic cake tin, works in either.  I always use a water bath.  I use my favorite brand of chocolate chip, Guittard bittersweet and I reduce the sugar by a couple Tbls. For those that have had issues, make sure you don't over heat your chocolate, make sure sugar is completely dissolved and let it stand to cool slightly before adding. Use room temp butter and eggs.  Do not add eggs if mix is still hot, or temper them before adding. Really do beat in separately until each addition of butter and egg is well incorporated. 45 min really is long enough.  Cool completely on the counter before refrigerating. Turn out when cold and let it come to room temp before cutting with a hot knife and serving. I always serve with a quick raspberry sauce (seedless raspberry jam mixed with a bit of water, heated) to help cut the richness and fresh fruit, if I have it. Trust me, this cake is worth the effort.

This is like a cross between fudge and cake. I didn't make it, but the "cake lady" in our office did. EVERYONE raved over it (someone commented they had drool coming out after the last bite)! Caveats from the baker:  use wax paper underneath because none of the instructions for removing it worked; a springform or tart pan would be best.

This is a great start to a flourless chocolate cake.  Very heavy and thick.  If you want the same great flavor but less dense and more airy, follow the recommended changes. The one change I would recommend for is to cut all ingredients in half.  Then separate the whites from the eggs.  Make the recipe as normal using the egg yolks in replace the eggs.  Just before placing the batter in the pan, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold the whites into the batter.  Cook as suggested and this will add a lot of air to cake and make it lighter.

Terrible.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cake was grainy and greasy - it did not hold together because it seems there it too much butter.  Had to dump the whole thing and started all over again and followed another recipe and it came out perfect.  This recipe is easy but did not work.

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate and added melted butter while melting the chocolate to help it along. (It wasn't melting well without it but the butter did the trick.) I made mini single-portion cakes (using crème brulee ramekins) to make it a really fun dessert. After the cakes chilled,  I used the icing from the Sacher Torte recipe on Allrecipes and chilled them again. (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/110312/sacher-torte) The cake came out creamy and delicious. The icing hardened nicely after being chilled to make a nice, easy-to-cut shell on the outside. The cakes were a hit. It was decadent.

This is my go-to recipe for entertaining. It's rich, elegant, relatively easy, and caters to gluten-free guests. Follow the ingredients as they're written (except you can replace some or all of the water with liqueur or rum; my favorite is half rum/half water). Make sure to use good, mostly bittersweet chocolate (I use a bag of Guittard bittersweet chocolate chips and half a bag of Guittard semi-sweet and it's a perfect sweetness level). 
I would suggest the following techniques to get the texture right every time: 1.) lightly grease the pan before putting wax paper at the bottom. 2.) Once you've set aside the sugar/water mixture, combine the chocolate and butter in one large bowl and microwave on high for 1 minute, then stir completely (breaking up all lumps). Microwave again for 30 sec., then stir until smooth. 3.) Put a kettle of water on; it will be boiling by the time you're ready for the water bath. 4.) Whisk all of the eggs together in a mid-sized bowl until they are all thick and yellow. 5.) Temper the eggs with the sugar/water mixture by slowly pouring a bit of water at a time with one hand and whisking the eggs continuously with the other. Do this with about half the sugar/water mixture. 6.) Add the other half of the sugar/water to the melted chocolate and stir until smooth. Then pour the egg mixture to the chocolate a little at a time with one hand, while stirring the chocolate with a whisk with the other hand. 7.) Your kettle will be boiling. Pour your batter into

Excellent!  Did not have anything fancy so just used a 10 inch cake pan in a 12 inch cake pan woth water.  Lined the bottom with parchment then sprayed with cooking spray .  Melted chocolate in the microwave, dissolved the sugar and salt in hot tap water, and melted the butter. Mixed all with a hand mixer.  Despite my dumbing down the execution, the results were phenomenal! Want to try it with Gran Marnier as another critic suggested.

I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate.  Followed the recipe exactly and used a springform pan.  It didn't look very done, but after a night in the fridge it was PERFECT.   Best I've ever had!

Took this to a gathering. It is hard to cut and serve, but if you are looking for something very rich and decedent, this is it! It was like eating a chocolate truffle.

This cake was absolutely wonderful.  Very easy to make, but it really does require chilling overnight.  I had to try soaking it in hot water several times before it finally came out of the pan.  The last attempt I sat the pan in a few inches of boiling water for several minutes and then it came right out.  Had rave reviews from everyone who ate it!

This was a great learning opportunity!  Thanks to other reviewers, I studied up on egg tempering and chocolate seizing.  The recipe is deceptively simple but the ingredients require special handling.  Much thanks to  Shweta’s modifications.  It was perfect with the Framboise.  My only problem was that I couldn't get it out of the 9" pan (I had been afraid of leakage with a spring form pan),

Followed the recipe to a T and it was so delicious. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate. My husband rated this an 8.5 only because we didn't have whipped cream, or he would've rated it a 9! Will make this again definitely.

This was a decadently delicious and rich cake and came in 2nd in our office holiday bakeoff. The texture was wonderful - thick and creamy - a lot like fudge! I used Nestle bittersweet chips (two, 10 oz bags), after baking ~48 minutes, let it cool in the pan and then flipped onto  the serving plate, once cool, and placed overnight in the fridge. In the morning* I sprinkled confectioner's sugar and added "holly" via red gumdrops and spearmint leaves (I cut the height of the "leaves" in 1/2 so they weren't too high). See the 3 photos - right out of the oven, undecorated on the green plate, and fully decorated (I could not figure out how to attach the photos to the review). *The confectioner's sugar absorbed into the cake though so I would sprinkle that on at the last-minute next time.

Instant hit!  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.
I will be playing with  this recipe in the future trying different chocolates, liqueurs, edible flowers and perhaps layering with a fruit filling.

I don't have a microwave so, I melted the chocolate in a lightly oiled oven proof bowl and placed in a warm oven, ensuring to stir occasionally. I also used a mixture of dark chocolate and bittersweet chocolate.
Next time I will skip the water bath.

I made his for my mom's birthday. She loves cheesecake, but another family member is allergic to milk, and I didn't have time to go get specialized vegan cream cheese. WELL, this looked like about the right texture, and so I tried it. I modified it by using a bit of dairy-free margarine , and dairy free chocolate, and adding a chocolate crust to the bottom that I baked in a spring form pan while the chocolate was melting. (If you have a spring form pan, then you can just bake it without the water bath, and adapt the time based on the size of the pan. It bakes evenly and then if your pan has a slight leak like mine does, it's still no problem. You can also just use chocolate chips and a baking bar, like the other reviews mention. It actually melts a little more evenly that way. )
Anyway, it was one of the best cakes I've ever made. My mom thought it was as good as cheesecake (High praise), and everyone in my family enjoyed it. it served 10 people, and because it was so intense, there was still about half to enjoy the next day. 
I actually made an account just because it was soooo good. I'm baking it again with a little raspberry extract added to the sugar water in it right now and it smells amazing.

This was an excellent recipe! Finally, a flourless chocolate cake with the dense, rich texture it should have. Most recipes come out like brownies. Per other reviews, I used 3 eggs and 3 egg whites. I didn't miss the yolks at all. I also used 16 oz bittersweet bars and 2 oz semisweet chocolate chips (mostly because I didn't want to buy an extra bar). I made it in a springform pan to make things easier and it came out perfectly. I chilled it a few hours rather than overnight before eating, and it was fabulous!

My first flourless cake & it is delicious!  I don't like cake but decided to try this since its looks more dense & fudge-like. OMG is all I can say!  I kept everything the same but did not use the water bath & it turned out fine.

Fantastic, delicious crowd-pleaser. Super dense chocolate cake, very fudge-like. I added an extra 1/4 cup of butter and about a cup of cocoa, and sprinkled sea salt and powdered sugar on top. Delicious!

Instead of putting it in the pan with water, I just served it like that, and it turned into a pudding cake!

This is the flourless chocolate cake recipe I have been looking for!  I made it exactly as instructed, although I did change out the pan for a 9 in. glass pie dish, which made the cleanup a snap ( just use caution in the heat /cold changes.)  It came out perfect, and was a incredible favorite with everyone ages 20-70.

Made this for friends who are gluten-free and came over for dessert.  I followed the recipe except for I didn't use the water bath method.  I simply put a baking dish of water on a lower rack.  As a result, I wonder if doing this altered the baking time because I ended up having to bake the cake for over an hour.  No problem - it's probably just the variance of ovens.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because the cake was more of a baked fudge than cake, though it was made via a "cake" method.  I served it with Cool Whip and fresh strawberries.  I think these were necessary in order to balance the chocolate decadence.

I have made this twice now and love it.   I made it this using espresso and semi sweet chocolate chips. I used the bath method in an 8 inch square pan lined with foil and butter. Using a hot knife makes the cutting easier for sure and it really is decadent for this small 8 inch square pan would feed a lot of people.  Drizzled with raspberry sauce and raspberries this dessert is really rich like a truffle and a wonderful dessert regardless if they need a gluten free dessert.

This is an excellent cake. I thought I read the recipes carefully, but put in 18 squares, instead of 18 oz. The cake still tastes good, but would be richer with more chocolate. I'd only suggest changing the wording on the recipe to say 18 oz chocolate.

I'm an amateur hobby baker on my best day. I've never made anything like this, but I wanted to make something for my MIL's birthday that was really special. I followed the directions exactly, used Baker's bittersweet baking chocolate, and this turned out beautifully. Its smooth and truffley and melts in your mouth. I was going to do a ganache frosting, but its so rich, it didnt need it. I put a big dollop of whip cream and a strawberry instead and it was divine. I'm going to use Ghiradelli next time to see how naughty it can get. ;D

I made this for Mother's Day this year and it was perfect! I used three 6oz bags of Scharffen Berger Bittersweet 70% Cacao Baking Chunks, which I melted in the microwave. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. It was so jiggly when I pulled it out of the oven after 45 minutes that I was sure that it wasn't going to set up, but by morning it was completely set and ready to go. After turning it out onto a plate I put a layer of whipping cream on top with strawberries. I served it with a scoop of homemade mint chocolate chip ice cream (also from All Recipes :) and it was a hit. I will say that you can't cut the pieces too small... The chocolate in this is overwhelming... it's great, but it's a lot of chocolate :) I really liked the idea someone had about making it in a mini muffin pan. Those would be a perfect size. There was zero grit to this... it was perfectly smooth and a real crowd pleaser!

This didn't work out for me, but it's likely my fault. I used chocolate chips instead of chocolate squares. I normally bake with them and it's never a problem. Either way, it tasted like a chocolate omelette and took on a grayish color! Very strange! Will try this again with chocolate squares instead.

I used semi sweet chocolate chips and reduced the recipe to serve 10 as I wanted to use a smaller pan. I found it relatively easy to prepare, and had no trouble with the eggs even though I didn't temper them. The one thing that I had a hard time with was cooking time. I did a water bath and covered with foil. Even in my smaller pan, this cooked for over 70 minutes. I removed the foil after 38 in hopes of getting it to cook. I cooled it in the fridge for several hours before serving it to a group. One individual is gluten intolerant, but I got RAVE reviews from everyone. It was smooth and creamy. I topped it with whole raspberries and whipped cream to cut the intense chocolate taste.

I made this and followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect first try. I did use a 10" spring-form pan lined on the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal. If you do use a spring-form pan use a couple layers of heavy duty foil around the pan to prevent leakage from the water bath. I used Trader Joe's pound plus bar of 72% Dark Chocolate. I wish I could attach a photo of it as it looked so good!

I did not have enough bittersweet chocolate, so I added some semi sweet and unsweetened to bring it up to the proper amount of chocolate.  Made a rasberry sauce to accompany the torte, lovely.

Fantastic recipe.  Very dense , sinful actually!  I substituted water for espresso for an even deeper, richer flavour.

I've made this "cake" twice now.  It ends up being more like a fudge in both taste and consistency rather than cake.  The flavor is rich, but not bitter.  I substituted Splenda Blend for the sugar; it was wonderful.  Since I don't have a 10-inch round pan, I used 8 ramekins and it was all good!

All my German colleagues loved it! They said it is not too sweet and texture is quite good. I used eight inch round cake pan and divide all the ingredients by 1.5 in amount. The cooking time is reduced to 35 mins. It turned out perfect. I will definitely recommend it to chocolate lovers.

Delicious, smooth, decadent, rich, dark chocolate cake. I used slightly less than 1/2 cup of a sugar/stevia blend and Dove dark chocolate candies left over from Christmas--I think the quality of the chocolate you use will make a significant difference. Made this again 7/9/16. Definitely use a high quality dark chocolate. Excellent for entertaining, garnished with fresh whipped heavy cream and raspberries.

I made this exactly as written, used Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet bars, and it turned out perfect! Texture was exactly like a store bought truffle, smooth and melted in your mouth almost immediately. Originally I had intended to cover it with ganache but ran out of time and am glad I skipped it! It really didn't need it. Dusted with some powdered sugar (just for looks). Couldn't be more pleased with the results!

I modified the recipe by adding a generous jot of vanilla extract and a teaspoon of instant coffee. Turned out delicious!

Update: It's even MORE delicious with the generous jot of vanilla (maybe 2 tsp), a small jot of almond extract (maybe 1/2 tsp), 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and brewed coffee in place of the water. I used 3 c. of regular old Nestle's chocolate chips, and the texture was perfect.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I made this for Valentine's Day and after each bite my boyfriend always said "d*mn homey!"  We can't get enough of it!  Due to my misreading the recipe, I made a few changes and it still turned out great.  I used 18 oz unsweetened bakers chocolate and, though I kept the sugar the same, it turned out rich and bitter and comparable to espresso in flavor.  I also used an 8x8 pan and increased the cooking time to 55 minutes.  Additionally, I made this in the afternoon on Valentine's Day, and to set the cake I stuck it in the freezer for 3 hours.  I didn't make any frosting or glaze, and it definitely didn't need it.  Pair it with a glass of port and you're good to go!

When I make this cake I use a 16 inch Tart pan. I use Pam on the pan but I also use Parchment paper. This makes it easy to get the cake off the bottom of the tart pan.  I usually put the pan of water under the cake on a lower rack. This always comes out perfect. I get a lot of requests for this one, so thanks for sharing this recipe! Making one right now for a Birthday with a Chocolate Mousse layer and then a Chocolate Ganach (?) topping. Yum!!

I follow the recipe just as written, the only time I've changed it was because I didn't have the kind of chocolate they mention.  I used semi sweet chocolate chips and it was just as good, if not a little smoother.

I have made this recipe a few times now.  Always comes out great.  A few notes.  Chocolate is melted so it can be chips or blocks for the 18oz.  This last time I used chips.  Bake for the listed 45 min and the result gives that truffle like texture.  Someone said it was grainy and I would say the butter and eggs were added too quickly and not enough beating between or the chocolate was Scott he'd in the melting process.  I would use a double broiler over a microwave.  Easily can serve 24 as you just need a sliver.  Dip the knife into hot water between cuts for clean Cuts.  Also if the top is not smooth after releasing from pan.  A hot knife will smooth out the top.

I did not make any changes to the recipe and I followed it exactly.  I couldn't remove the cake from the cake pan so presentation was a big let down, even after dipping it in hot water and inverting it like the directions say.  Next time I might try skipping the hot water bath  so I can bake it in a spring form pan and not have to worry about removing it from the pan. update: I put a square of parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and ran a butter knife around the edges, flipped it over and it came out very easily and looked beautiful.

I didn't have unsalted butter so I used 1 cup veggie shortening and 6 tbsp water. I also used ghirardelli chocolate . It was delicious!!! I sprinkled with powdered sugar (which sorta got absorbed by the cake) and sliced strawberries.

I didn't read carefully and skipped the water bath portion! I quickly put my cake in a bath, but I was using one of the two piece pans and water flooded into the batter, it was a mess!!! Thankfully I had a second pan handy. The cake came out beautifully.

Excellent dessert !   using the previous reviews gave me tips for making it the first time and I was grateful!   I used melted butter and it made the cake batter creamy.   I  did not bake the cakes in  a water bath but used a suggestion I read here.  I put a foil pan with boiling water on the bottom shelf and baked two cakes on the shelf above the boiling water.    I used  two metal round 9" baking pan's  that were new and  had a layer of insulation.   After an hour of cooling on the counter the cake came out of the pan with no problem !   I then put them on a plate and refrigerated them for our dessert the next day.   I served them using canned whip cream.  DELISH !!!!!!!!

This cake was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I did use a springform pan and wrapped it in foil to prevent leaking. The texture was wonderful as it was dense but melted in my mouth. I found the recipe easy to make and will definitely be making it again.

This was easy to make and was fantastic! I didn't see the note to let it chill overnight so it was made the same day we ate it. It was still great, but leftovers the next night after bring chilled were even better.

Exquisite.  This torte is amazing.  Imagine the texture of a fine cheesecake with the silky bitteresque taste of a truffle.  these simple ingredients, combined expertly, result in a divine dessert.  Excellent served with barely sweetened whipped cream and raspberry purée.  Thank Jlu

SOOOO GOOOOD! Easy to make, easy to eat! I followed the recipe closely.  I used a 9" springform pan with foil around the bottom, but the 45 minute time seemed to be enough. Another 5 minutes might have been okay. It turned out solid but kind of gooey. I microwaved some red raspberry preserves and drizzled it over the top and sifted some powdered sugar over the top. If you like chocolate, you'll love this. If you need gluten free, you'll love this.

Made this for the weekend needless to say everyone loved it. I followed the idea to use 3 eggs and 3 egg whites and I also added some vanilla and orange extracts. Because orange goes well with chocolate. I also made a vanilla-orange icing using confectioners sugar some oil and some almond coconut milk blend then added the extracts and food coloring to make it orange. This could be modified to be mint or whatever flavoring you want.

All in all good recipe but not the best out there. When it comes out of the oven it's phenomenal but let it rest for a little bit to get ready to serve for people the following day not really the best recipe.  But may i suggest using coffee instead of water to add more flavor give its sorta mocha feel to it

This is an unbelievably delicious and rich recipe! Oh my gosh! I needed a smaller size for a party of 7-8 and reduced the recipe to 1/3 of the original, which was easy to do. I used a 6 inch springform pan, I reduced the cooking time to 35 minutes and that was perfect. I wrapped the pan in three sheets of foil so that the water wouldn't leak and and I definitely recommend doing that. The cake came right out of the pan with no difficulty, even though I forgot to grease it. It also slid off the bottom so I didn't have to flip it. I was gorgeous and very elegant looking. Everyone was so impressed. This is restaurant quality or better. I made homemade cinnamon spice whipped cream and it was divine with the chocolate, if I do say so myself. It definitely needs whipped cream to cut the richness. Highly recommend!

5 stars do not do this dessert justice!  Magnificent!  The intensity of the chocolate and the creamy texture, like that of a truffle, make it absolute perfection!  I can't say enough about it!  Make it!  You won't be disappointed!  And your guests will never forget it!  :-)

Made recipe as written twice! Perfect!! 
I used Scharffen Berger Chocolate  because giant eagle had it on clearance-  I'm glad they did! Good stuff! I made a raspberry sauce and whipped cream to go with! Sex on a plate! Yummy! 
I'm not gf , vegan or anything like that! I tried this because it looked good...its Really good! I used 10 inch springform sprayed with Pam-  No need for parchment unless your pan is scratched to h*'ll and Back! Chilled in freezer an hour b4 popping out , cut slices and placed in fridge overnight. Tip: If you cut your slices before it's 100% chilled you won't have to heat knife etc etc to cut. It will be ready to go once chilled through

This recipe made an amazing flourless chocolate cake.  I made it just as listed by Maggie.  The chocolate flavor was very rich and delicious.  The texture was creamy and just perfect.  I brought this cake to my quilt group and everyone loved it.  Everyone wanted the recipe as well.  I did use a springform pan and wrapped foil around it to ensure water did not get into the cake as it baked.  This worked perfectly.  This is a recipe I will use again and again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made the cake twice with different results.  The first time, I used a springform pan and it sank in the middle.  The cooking time was too long, as the springform allowed more heat to circulate and baked the cake too quickly.  The second time, I used a 9.63" Nordic Ware non-stick pan and it turned out perfectly.  I substituted coffee for the water and used 12 ounces of 70% cacao bittersweet Ghirardelli chocolate and 6 ounces of 60% bittersweet Ghirardelli.  It was perfect!  The consistency of this cake should be creamy and dense like a truffle.  If it's dry and cake-like, it's been cooked too long. It's simpler to release the cake from the pan if you use a piece of round parchment paper. Before you serve it, let it sit at room temperature for a while because it brings out the flavor of the chocolate (much like fine cheese).  It needs something acidic such as raspberry coulis served with it to counteract the sweetness or unsweetened heavy or whipped cream. A very elegant and sophisticated dessert. I want to try using 70% bittersweet Lindt chocolate next time.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  Must eat with vanilla ice cream or coffee as it's very rich.  I didn't have the chocolate the recipe called for, so just used a large bag of dark chocolate chips.  This was a Mother's Day hit for a Mom who loves chocolate!

This recipe is great. The end result will be more like a chocolate truffle taste/texture than a typical chocolate cake. It is very rich... however, it is great for chocolate lovers. I followed other reviews and used strong brewed coffee instead of water. I also used three egg and three egg whites. I baked mine in a muffin tray for little individual cakes. I've eaten one already to sample but I plan on serving them with a home made strawberry coulis and a dollop of unsweetened whip cream.

This came out great! I used a non stick cake pan and it came out fine after putting in hot water for about 5 mins. You do have to be a chocolate lover to like this. It is very rich. Has a cheesecake texture without the cheese. I made a strawberry sauce and also topped with whipped cream.

This is really good straight out of the freezer. It's so smooth and rich. If you like dark chocolate, this is the one for you. I did not cook it in a water bath, I filled up muffin tins and put them on the rack below the cooking cake to keep the moisture up in the oven. This will work in any size cake pan. I cooled it on the counter and then froze it when it was almost cool. I also used parchment paper in the bottom of the pan to keep it from sticking. Very rich and good in small amounts with or without syrups or garnishes.

Made this cake for my husband's birthday.  He just became gluten intolerant and told me didn't want a cake.  Well, he was very surprised and now says this is the BEST CAKE HE HAS EVER HAD!  I used strong coffee from the coffee press, a fancy spring form pan and the raspberry sauce from Chef John's Peach Melba recipe.  This was the perfect combination!  Always make sure your batter isn't hot enough to cook the egg as it is added.  Can't wait to make it for Mother's Day!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. I tried this because it looked good in the picture and because of all the great reviews. The chocolate was expensive but i thought it would be worth it. It turned out bitter and just didnt taste right. It did indeed look exactly like picture.

I love this cake. I followed another reviewer's advice and used three eggs and three egg whites, and I also added in a bit of mint. It turned out to be absolutely delicious. I had a bit of trouble getting it out of the pan after it had set overnight, and once I did get it out, the bottom had melted a little bit. Fortunately I had taken it out of the pan with enough time before I needed to serve it, so I just smoothed out the top and put it back in the fridge. It stiffened right up again, so no serious issues there.

This cake tasted just like it came from an expensive restaurant.  I used Ghiradelli chocolate and made it exactly as the recipe said.  I did use a springform pan and wrapped the bottom in two layers of foil to keep water out. The only problem with the springform pan is that water leaks onto the cake when trying to loosen it in order to invert onto a serving plate.  Then I unfortunately cracked the cake getting it off the pan.  Next time I will use parchment paper to line the bottom of the springform pan to make removal easier.   I decorated the cake with a stencil of a heart outlined with sifted cocoa. Served it with raspberry sauce and whipped cream. Delicious!

I made this cake two ways based on other reviews.  The original recipe is very dense almost like fudge.  The altered recipe with folding in egg whites gave it more air and a more cakelike texture which I preferred.  It can also be made with various types of chocolate depending on what you have.  I didn't have all bittersweet so I mixed semi and milk chocolate to arrive at the 18 oz.  I altered the sugar for the sweeter chocolate.  Overall a very nice cake.  Thank you.

I have a friend who has Celiac's disease. Her birthday just came about and I wanted to do something special for her, so I decided to make her a birthday cake. I can't afford to get alternative, gluten free flours, so I decided that I would make a flourless chocolate cake. Upon scour the internet for recipes, I found this one and many like it. While the averages to most of them were high, all the reviews were consistently mixed and complaining of too much chocolate flavor and a problem with dryness. Noting that, I decided to use this recipe but alter it some. 

I cut the amount of chocolate down to 8oz and used a mixture of both dark chocolate and semisweet chocolate. I also added 1 cup of cherry cola to give the cake some lightness and moisture from the carbonation as well as a complimentary flavor for the chocolate. This was all an experiment so I wasn't sure how it would turn out. In fact, the soupy texture of the batter had me freaking out for a moment. I ended up with two cakes out of the mix and baked them both for about an hour at 325 instead of 300. I haven't tasted the final product yet as I am saving them to enjoy with my friend, but they came out light, springy, and absolutely gorgeous. The batter tasted great so I imagine they do too. 

So, for being a good base recipe I give this 3 stars. However, as my experimentation points out, this could be much better.

I experimented with this recipe for a group where one member needed a gluten-free dessert.  Also found it needed to be dairy free and soy free!  Well, I tried it and had good reviews.  I used 1 Cup of earth balance buttery spread(no soy)for the butter.  Everyone loved this cake.  I will make it again soon using the regular butter for a birthday cake since you can make it ahead and keep in the 'fridge.  Used the strawberry sauce from this site that others suggested. Yum!

Fantastic! I made this exactly as directed and it came out perfect. It is very rich so slice it on the thin side. I served it with fresh raspberry puree and whipped cream. This is best served slightly chilled but not cold.

I made Strawberry Sauce by Chef John (also on this site) and whipped cream to go with this. Delicious! I made the cake exactly as directed, but for some reason it took way longer to bake and never did solidify completely in the middle. Even so, it was still wonderful! I will make this again!

This cake came out great!  It's more like a cheescake. I used 8 oz of semi-sweet chocolate and 10 oz. of bittersweet chocolate. I followed the recipe directions and it came out perfectly .I did use a spring form pan instead of a cake pan.  I definitely would recommend the spring form because it was much easier to get the cake out of the pan.  I sprinkled powdered sugar on top and served with a strawberry sauce on the side. Everyone loved it and yes it is rich!

Recently I cut sugary foods from my 3 1/2 year old's diet (not that she had much to begin with) although the difference has been minimal over the last 2 months. I started doing some research and I have a feeling it's not so much the sugar that is an issue, but the glutton. This recipe sounds so delicious, the whole family would love it, and my hubby won't even know it's glutton free. I can't wait to make this later and test it out. Love baking with my daughter, but feel so guilty that she hasn't been able to reap the rewards of het own projects. Thank you for sharing! Can't wait to try and report back!

I had a flourless chocolate cake at our local bistro and was determined to find a recipe. THIS IS IT!!!!! I follow the directions exactly using 60% Ghiradelli chocolate. I have used both a 9"   sprinform and 10" regular cake pan. Both work fine and the cake releases easily. It is beautiful and absolutely delicious. The second one didn't age for 24 hours, and it seemed the texture was not quite as smooth, so from now on I won't skip that step. All in all, this is a definite keeper!!!!

This is a great recipe!  I followed the directions exactly with no problems.  I used 60% Ghirardelli chips- made for a very rich and delicious torte.  I felt the texture was like a silky smooth truffle.  I topped mine with homemade whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  I think adding something with some sweetness helps balance out the richness from the chocolate.  Very delicious!

This is wonderful!  I made it for my son's birthday, since he has a wheat allergy.  He(and everyone else) begged me to make another as soon as that one ran out.  I used different types of dark chocolate each time and it always turned out wonderfully.

This cake is so easy to make and it's very smooth and decadent. If you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate, this dessert is for you. Make sure that the center looks uncooked because the last time I made it I overcooked the middle and it just didn't taste as good. A home made raspberry sauce goes great with this.

I made this for my son's birthday cake as his birthday was the first night of Passover this year.  Everyone at the seder loved it.  It is more of a custard texture than cake.  I used half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chocolate.  And, as I didn't have unsalted butter, I used salted butter and omitted adding the salt to the recipe.  I served it with strawberry sauce and it was a hit.  I don't know how it would come out with margarine for a meat meal, however.  I'll make this again for Passover and year round.

Really enjoyed this! Scaled it to 3/4 amount of the recipe so I could use my 8" heart-shaped springform pan.  Turned out great!  This recipe worked best for me when I halved the butter.

A phenomenal hit! I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and she was still talking about it weeks later. Great if you have a gluten intolerant person at the table.

I made this for my girlfriend (she is gluton intolerant, but loves chocolate) and it was quite well received.  When I took it out of the oven, I took the pan out of the water bath (burning myself in the process...too long to explain here) and then placed it in the fridge to cool over night.  Was I supposed to leave the entire thing in the fridge (i.e. water bath and all)

Feel like a big loser.  Batter tasted divine -- used 1/2 cup kahlua instead of water and three eggs and three egg whites, as previous reviewers suggested.  The water bath was a huge FAIL.  My brand new springform pan leaked.  I now have no dessert for my boyfriend's surprise birthday party tomorrow.  I may try remaking in the morning but...what a disappointment!

This cake is wonderful, a chocolate lovers dream. It is the perfect party dessert, you make the day ahead, feeds at least 16 and very impressive!  I used a bag of Giradelli bittersweet (11.5oz) and a small bag of Nestle (6oz)semi-sweet I would have liked it a tad sweeter so i may do half and half but it is still amazing. Next time I will try 3 egg yolks just to lighten up the recipe a bit and use the Grand Mariner in place of water.

I made this for my Mom and we both LOVED it!  It is VERY rich, but it freezes well and it serves as a great way to have a little chocolate fix on hand ;o)  It is as good, if not better, than any of the gourmet flourless chocolate cakes I've had.

This cake turned out AWESOME! This is one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever eaten. I made homemade caramel sauce to go on on top and the presentation was flawless and the taste...OH, the taste! Perfectly rich and moist. My taste buds were singing!  This cake WILL be made again!

Outstanding!  Topped it with the Hard Chocolate Glaze recipe and people went nuts for it.  The cake goes a long way too, you can only eat a super skinny slice because of the richness.  I served it with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.  This is the perfect Passover dessert!

I must have done something very very wrong because this did not work for me at all. I was so excited to make this because it was Gluten Free and I thought I would finally have cake. I went over the recipe so many times for the life of me I do not know what i could have done wrong since everyone spoke so highly of this.

Brilliant! Absolutely delicious! Made this cake for my host mother (Spain), and she said it was "divine"! It's really fool-proof. I served it with whipped cream and crush candied-peanuts on top. Yum!

Only ONE problem...I greased the pan very well but it still stuck to the bottom because it was so moist (which is of course better than burnt).  Next time (and believe me, there WILL BE a next time!) I am going to either dust the pan with cocoa or use a lining.  DELISH!

I was somewhat disappointed in this cake. It was very crumby so it kept breaking and the taste was too rich for me. I think I may keep looking for a good flourless chocolate cake recipe.

This was a huge hit at a dinner party I went to.  Yet I think it tasted even better a few days later.  The chocolate is rich but a bit bitter, so I decided to serve it with fresh whipped cream.  I prefer my chocolate a little sweeter than this but how can argue with all my friends who fell in love with it?

If you want to go through very little effort and impress the pants off your guests, make this cake! It is very rich and anyone who is a chocolate lover will think it's amazing. I usually serve it with raspberry sauce and whip cream. I've never served it and not been asked for the recipe. Actually, people are usually surprise when I say I made it rather than buying it at an expensive bakery.

This cake was just delish!   I used 4 eggs & 2 egg whites instead of all 6 eggs.  Turned out really good.  I did the waterbath and it came out perfect consistency.  I did make it the day ahead. Very rich, but with a little raspberry sauce & some whipped cream, it was wonderful!

Wow! This is the tastiest "cake" ever. I used 11.5 ounces of Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and the rest semi-sweet chocolate, 3 eggs, 3 egg whites and it was spectacular. My family and our guests couldn't stop raving about it. One of my guests is a celiac who now claims this will be the only cake for her birthday. THANKS!

Excellent recipe - can't wait to make it again!  
I used 12 oz bittersweet, 3 oz milk chocolate and 3 oz semi sweet - 
I also use 3 eggs and 3 egg whites.
Mine had to cook for 60 minutes - let it sit overnight in refrigerator-serve with strawberries and whipped cream - heavenly!!!!!

I made this for a family gathering and they loved it! My boyfriend cannot have gluten, so this was a great dessert to prepare that the whole family would enjoy. I served with fresh raspberries and whipped cream. Yummy!

Loved it!
Rave reviews from everyone who tried it

Changed recipe a smidgen 
I didn't boil the water- just used hot tap water,stirred it until sugar mostly dissolved- then added water and eggs to a bowl- whipped it super well with a mixer.
Melted chocolate in the micro and then waited to it was cool enough to stick a finger in- the added to egg mixture (if added too early it would make scrambled eggs)
Baked it in a square 8x8 inch pan, since I need to transport dessert-no need to invert it-kept it in pan to serve.
Baked it 55 minutes- need some extra time- I am guessing because of pan .

wow! Like a log in my stomach, but a good one. I found it needed more time to cook, it was just too liquidy after the time in the instructions. Another 5 minutes cooking would help. And yes, a hot knife is a must for cutting.

At first I was very worried because I wasnt sure how liquidy the batter should be. Mine was pretty liquidy. But after about 50 min to an hour it was done. it rose up and the sides cracked a tiny bit. I added the Chocolate Genache recipe, found on this site, on top of this cake. I also made mine twist by making chocolate meringue cookies and crushes some to use on top of the cake over the genache and then use some of the whole cookies to places on top. It was soo yummy and everyone loved it!!!

I followed the directions as written, except for substituting 4 oz. of semisweet chocolate for bittersweet and it turned out great! Easy to make, delicious, and can certainly feed more than 16- about 1/3 of the cake easily fed 7 people, so I would estimate at least 20 servings.

Excellent. Chocolate overload.  I didn't have time to chill it overnight so I stuck it in the freezer for an hour.  It didn't set up completely and so tasted like a decadent chocolate mousse pie.  The guests loved it.  A little definitely goes a long way.

I recently went gluten free and have been searching for a good cake recipe. This was AWESOME. I read all the suggestions but only took a few. I made this with all semi-sweet chocolate (its all I had). I kept all the other ingredients the same. I used a 10" cheesecake pan and didn't bother with the water bath. I can't imagine it turning out any better! I baked it for exactly 50 minutes....it was perfect. I served it with whipped cream and strawberries. Just make sure you have a crowd as it makes a lot and is very rich.

I made 2 for Passover Seder dessert.  wow!  No problems at all with the texture or removing from pans (used the dip pan in hot water trick).  I did use half orange juice half water for extra flavor.  Topped with a dollop of homemade whipped cream.  Just so creamy... kinda like a fudge brownie!  YUMMY!

This recipe is incredibly rich and decadent. As my friend put it: "this is the kind of dessert that you want to sit in a quiet corner and savor."

I can not believe how easy it is. I had some bittersweet chocolate left over and added 7 squares unsweetened and 8 squares semi-sweet chocolate to make up. 

I did not read the note on the Baker's package that had the 3:1 rule until AFTER,  but no matter--it was a hit!

I tried this recipe for Mother's Day and everyone loved it. I used a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 4 squares of unsweetened chocolate and my guests said it was the perfect sweetness. I used a springform pan lined with wax paper and had no trouble getting the cake out. We didn't even bother with the water bath and I don't think it made a difference. Everyone should try this one!

This cake was a bit of a dissapointment because the texture was fudgy - not what I expected.  Definitly serve room temp and with a strawberry or raspberry sauce.  I probably won't do this again.

I got varied responses.  Either they loved it or couldn't eat it because it was too rick or bitter.  I sub. hazelnut liquor for water.  Couldn't really taste the hazelnut.  Came out perfect following the other directions exactly.

This cake makes a beautiful presentation sprinkled with confectioner's sugar and topped with a dollop of freshly whipped cream. I made it for a dinner party because my brother-in-law's girlfriend can't have wheat or flour. She was so excited because she hasn't had a cake in years. She took half of it home for her breakfast! Even the guys thought this was great.

This was WONDERFUL!  Served this at Superbowl last week and it got rave reviews.  I threw a couple of chocolate covered espresso beans on top to garnish and it was beautiful.  If you follow the directions carefully, it's fairly easy to make.  Will definitely make again.

Sooo good! I made it for my husbands birthday cake. He's been asking for fourless chocolate cake since I started trying to cook our favorite foods at home. This was much much better than I expected and no trouble to make either. I used Ghirardelli's chocolate- half semi-sweet and half double-chocolate chips. SERVE IT WARM. When it was chilled, it was pretty heavy. I prepared it in an aluminum disposable pan and it worked very well.

My husband and I went on the Royal Caribbean's Rhapsody of the Seas and had this on the ship, and when we got home I was pleased to find this on Allrecipes!  I just made it last night and it was very easy to prepare and bake.  I almost thought I wouldn't find a pan big enough to put the cake pan in, but I used my roasting pan.  This a very thick and very rich cake.  I would recommend just serving a very small piece.  I also garnished each is a dallop of whip cream.  It tasted just like it the Rhapsody's! Very good!

Sensational! I used a springform pan and good quality semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.
