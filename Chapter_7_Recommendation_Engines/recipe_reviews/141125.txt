So filling and delicious! I pressed the hamburg as thin as possible and made equal sized patties.  Next time, I think I'll deliberately make two diffent sized patties, putting my filling on the smaller one, and topping with the larger hamburger patty to make more secure topper and edge. I omitted the BBQ sauce (not a bit fan of it) and added the slightest bit of powdered garlic.  For the life of me I can't grill hamburgers without their falling into the flame, so I pan-fried these and it worked wonderfully.  Boyfriend raved about how good these are and I agree.  Thank you for a fun, different and tasty way to make hamburgers!

Deeeelicious!  I added a little minced garlic to the ground beef and didn't have any onions on hand, so I did without.  I added a little bbq sauce to the top of the burger just before serving.  My picky teenagers are still bragging about what a great cook I am! =)  Thanks for a great burger recipe!

Full of Flavor!! I am learning to cook so mine looked a little less than perfect (mainly because I had to defrost the meat in the microwave (last minute dinner) and it didn't stick together (but that was entirely me, not the recipe) Anyway, I will be making it again Everyone enjoyed it..except my brother, he still refuses to even TASTE anything I cook.

Great burgers, I spice up my ground chuck a little more with different seasonings, I place the stuffing in the middle only and I grilled them. But the best thing I get out of these burgers is, watching people faces as they reach the middle while eating. SURPRISE!!!!!.

GREAT recipe!!
im on a diet so I couldnt actually taste them but my family LOVED them!! I live in chile so for election day I wanted to make an all american meal so thanks for the recipe
ps. if your cheese comes out of the sides its because you didnt close them well.. you have to play with the meat (with your fingers) to make sure they dont have any holes where the cheese can escape! i "molded" them alot of times so that i wouldnt have that problem
also, if you dont like your burgers GIGANTIC divide every pound of meat in 8, they still came out HUGE 
try to not make them too thick.. keep in mind that 2 of them will make one!

I am not a big hamburger fan but these were very tasty. I used real bacon bits instead and then sauteed my onions in butter. I liked that in every bite you had onion, bacon and melted cheese.

Made these burgers twice in one week!
I prepped (16) 5" wide patties and chilled in fridge while preparing the rest.
I believe I made minor changes to this recipe.
I used a full pound of cooked bacon, but did not mix it with the cooked onions.
After cooking onions in bacon grease, I placed several paper towels on top of onions (and then discarded) to get rid of excess grease. 
I allowed onions to fully cool. Then divided among 8 patties evenly. 
I divided cooked bacon among those 8 patties . . . 
and then divided EXTRA Sharp Cheddar cheese (shredded)on top of the 8 patties.
I sealed the edges well and refrigerated for at least 1/2 hour.
Hubby grilled and all raved! Somehow with 8 burgers . . .  only 4 four were fed.
Tonight, I had to double this recipe.
They could not wait for the burgers to be cooked quickly enough!
Totally Awesome!!!
I think it's important to allow all cooked ingredients (bacon and onions) to cool fully before assembling burgers . . . and especially allow burgers to be refrigerated at least 1/2 hour prior to grilling. This will help keep burgers from falling apart in the grilling process.

yummy! did this two days since I made for six. the first day I did just as the recipe called for. the second day I tried with mushrooms sauteed and then stuffed. both times came out great yet I had a hard time keeping them together. 

I usually make this sauce from this other website that replicates shake shacks sauce. its amazing on fries and all over the burger. lol, usually end up with the sauce all over by the time I'm done with the burger. try it! 

Sauce Ingredients
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 tablespoon ketchup
1 tablespoon yellow mustard
4 slices kosher dill pickle
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
Pinch cayenne pepper

These are excellent with blue cheese crumbles vs shredded cheddar.  I omitted the barbeque sauce and used a TBS of Worcestershire instead and minced garlic ( about a TBS from a jar) vs garlic powder. Also added a tsp of dried tarragon. YUM!

These burgers were fantastic and I would give it a 5 for flavour, but I had trouble keeping the cheese from leaking out, even though I sealed everything very tight.  Nothing worse than seeing your hard work melting into the bar-b-que.  Great flavour and wonderfully different burger!  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't like this recipe at all. The burgers didn't stick together and the cheese just melted out of them. And it was way too time consuming for a burger.

It was an OK recipe. Followed all the directions to a tee the first time. Second time, we stuffed the burger with cheddar and velvetta, then topped the burger with the onion and bacon. We liked it much better the second time!!

We really liked these burgers! Definitely fairly time/labor intensive for a burger but really I didn't think it was that bad - gives you time to bake up some fries, boil some corn, etc. and this was a nice change of pace! I scaled back the amount of meat per burger a little bit since I didn't want to eat a 1/2lb of meat! :) I clumped my grated cheese into a little ball by squeezing it before putting it on top of the onions/bacon so it would be easier to keep it in place while sealing the edges. I worked the edges very carefully and smoothed them out before moving the burgers to the grill. I cooked over medium heat for about 10 minutes total to make sure they were seared nicely and cooked solid before flipping them. I had very little "leakage" of the cheese - only a couple spots on each. My son doesn't like onion, but he didn't taste it in this at all, and raved about the flavor. We will definitely use this again! :)

These tasted great. They were easy to make but I wouldn't say it was quick. By the time you fry the bacon and prep and cook everything, it can take time. I think we spent about 50 minutes from start to finish including the grill time. They were definitely a crowd pleaser.

these were just awesome. only thing i did different was i used a pack of onion soup mix in the hamburger mixture and they turned out great. just make your patties real thin and definitely refrigerate a hour or so before cooking. seal your edges good by working edges with your fingers and use i clump of cold cheese in the middle and they come out perfect. thanx

This took more time than I wanted to spend on making burgers. The taste def made up for the time. I made the burgers bigger and all four of us liked these. My step daughter still raves and this is after she didn't even want to try them.

I thought these were very good!  I made the burger part per my own personal burger recipe and then added the filling as suggested here.  Also, next time I think I will try it using ground sirloin!  Next time I will also make sure to make the patties a little thinner!

great recipe although i added an egg or two to the meat mixture before assembling & this will help bind the meat ensuring it sticks when cooking. I also used chopped parsley in the meat mixture.

I don't usually eat burgers, but I liked these, and the family enjoyed them as well. Instead of adding salt and garlic powder I just used garlic salt. I also added some onion powder and seasoned salt. And As Amy, the submitter said she did, we had ours with fries and root beer floats. Yum!!

Good! Recipe. I tweaked it a bit to in my opinion give it a little more flavor. I added more BBQ, added a little less onion, added cheese etc.

These burgers are extremely filling. I liked them a lot, but would recommend using a little less pepper. I used Muenster cheese on half the burgers and Swiss on the other burgers;I'm still undecided on which I liked better. Also, I added mushrooms to mine as well. I think next time I'll add some green peppers. Thanks for the recipe, we'll definitely make stuffed burgers more often than regular ones!

Great burger but just put a slice of sharp cheddar on top.  Mend the burgers well so they don't separate when cooked.

These were great!  I didn't have garlic powder, so I used minced garlic from the jar.  My son suggested next time I just mix the bacon in with all the burger because it "fell out" of it.  I will make these again!

Hey people.....if you are making hamburgers from 'scratch' you need to add an egg to 'bind' the meat and keep it from falling apart on the grill.  a few seasoned breadcrumbs will also help with that.  otherwise, this is awesome eats!

It was really good. I added some bbq sauce in with the bacon and onion mixture as well.  I will be making them again. Once stuffed it really did only take maybe 4 minutes tops to cook.

Very good recipe.  Made a few changes though.  I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of salt, 1/2 tsp. season salt, and subbed 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce for part of the BBQ sauce.  In the filling, I added 1 diced jalepeno pepper ( and 1/8 tsp. cayenne if isn't spicy enough), and used 1 cup of shredded cheese.

 

They were sure yummy!

While the taste is awesome, even though I did not add the cheese inside, but put it on top... it is a rather messy burger, and like many, it easily falls apart on the grill.  So in concept it was delicious, but execution was problematic.  I would suggest, sauteing the onions with the bacon, and draining on paper towels.  Then incorporating the whole concoction together, mixing the beef, salt, pepper, bbq sauce, garlic powder and the sauteed onion and bacon together, form into individual patties, grill 2-3 minutes per side, and add a nice slice of your favorite cheese on top...  Heck I would even cook up some extra bacon and add a slice or two on top of the burgers with the cheese.  Add a nice butter toasted bun and some more bbq sauce, dang that does sound like a winner!!!

It is important to make your burgers thin and larger than normal. And you must chill them. I didn't add the barbecue sauce, just Worchestershire, ~1 tbsp/lb of meat, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Add your filling, press top burger into bottom together, and if it's chilled properly, you can pick the whole burger up and round the edges by patting and pinching. These were good on the grill, but cooked in a copper grilling pan. No loss of filling. Really good idea.

I never truly follow a recipe, but more so use them as idea guides. this is a great base recipe for stuffed burgers. I made these tonight, (my first time ever attempting to make stuffed burgers) and everyone loved them! I made a mixture of crumbled blue cheese, crumbled bacon and fresh shredded Swiss cheese and reserved some to melt on the top after cooking (on the stove) just for pretty (and tasty). Served the burgers on oven toasted ciabatta bread with condiments. I sliced onion for dressing up, rather than cooked inside because I mixed French onion soup mix into the ground beef.

Recipe was alright. It wasn't flavorful enough in the end so I topped it with more cheese,  whatever was left of the onion mixture and barbecue sauce. Bumped it up a few notches. Burgers fell apart a little but other than that they were pretty easy to make!

Absolutely the BEST "at home" burger I've ever made! I followed the recipe as it was given and - as I munched out with much pleasure- was happy I did! My compliments to who ever originally posted the recipe!

A lot of effort for an average  burger.  Took way longer than 3 to 4 minutes each side.  The BBQ flavor was a little too strong...should have skipped that and just made regular burgers topped with sauteed onions, bacon and cheese.

I'm giving this a 4 because my husband said these were the best burgers he has ever grilled but I think it was because they were so thick, as a 1/2 pound hamburger would be, that he didn't have time to slaughter them.  He isn't the best at cooking burgers on the grill.  With that being said with all that meat I really didn't taste the middle stuffing.  I mean I know it was there, I could see it and it was a really "cool" thing....I just can't personally see the reason to make the effort EXCEPT my husband now thinks he is king of the coals.  So, there is that.

My family loved these.  I grilled on the stove and tried to make them as thin as possible. Next time I might buy a patty press. Others said the cheese seeped out so I tried the presliced cracker sized cheese and it worked perfect. These burgers had so much flavor. We had them on onion buns with grilled mushroom and a homemade onion ring to top it off.  Yum

We made these after seeing Juicy Lucys featured on TV. I added onion flakes instead of fresh onion (what we had on hand) & put the bacon on top after cooking it. The only thing we didn't care for was the BBQ sauce. The rest was awesome, would make these again!

very tasty burgers! I had trouble with these babies falling apart on my grill, but that was kinda my fault because i didn't seal the edges enough. as far as flavor goes, spot on.

I would have given this recipes 4.5 stars if I could.  It was really delicious!  We ate them too quickly to even take a picture.  

I used turkey meat and turkey bacon instead, red onion, smoked barbecue sauce, and a little more garlic.  After stuffing them, I had to make the patties very thin and large because the first one didn't cook thoroughly, but they shrunk to an edible size.  They did come apart a little at the edges at first but just pinch the edges very well and flip only once.

The boyfriend really, really liked them.  Even the next day.

I halved this recipe and made the burgers a little smaller, and they were still HUGE.  Good for big eaters.  A little greasy, no surprise there, but tasty.

Really liked the recipe- even my picky husband didn't detect the BBQ sauce.  Next time, I plan on making a little more filling- was that a hit and topping the burgers with cheddar while grilling.  These were a no brainer hit!

Needed more salt and garlic. The patties didn't stick together very well, and most of the cheese melted out. A waste of time really - could have just added the bacon, onions and cheese when the burgers were done.

These burgers were very tasty and I really liked having what would usually be toppings in the middle of the patties!  I did add some minced garlic and some finely chopped onion to the meat mix and look forward to spicing it up some more the next time I make these and there will be a next time!  The burgers also assembled easier than I thought they might and I was able to seal them well enough to keep the "stuffing" inside and yet maintain the size of a normal burger.  Thank you for this recipe!

These were good.  I fried cut-up bacon pieces, towards the end of frying added chopped onion, cooked until onion was tender.  Put bacon and onion mixed into beef, just put cheese on top.

I made these last night and they were a huge hit!  I only had about a pound and a half of ground round, but I made the patties thin and I still ended up with 6 good sized burgers.  My 3 daughters (ages 9, 5 & 3) ate theirs bunless and loved them!  I will keep this recipe for sure.
