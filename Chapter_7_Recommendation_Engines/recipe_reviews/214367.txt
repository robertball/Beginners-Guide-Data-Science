This is my recipe.  Be careful with the sugar!  Depending on how sweet your watermelon is I would start with 1/4 cup of sugar and taste.  Then keep adding sugar until your reach desired sweetness.  Enjoy!

Such a pretty, fresh tasting, pleasantly sweet treat! I never had this before and it was a such a nice surprise to find just how darn good this was.  No sooner did Hubs down his (and it was quickly too) and he wanted more.  And so did I.  I did press it through a wire mesh strainer as it was just a little too pulpy for me (maybe it's just my blender), but I followed the recipe for everything else, including the fresh mint, lime and the amount of sugar, which we both found to be the perfect amount.  So we had more - and Hubs requested that from now on I make this with Splenda, which indicates he plans on drinking a lot of this!  Thanks for sharing this delightful treat, SB - we couldn't have enjoyed it more.

Great recipe ... I added Tequila and triple sec (instead of sugar)  to the recipe and garnished with very thin slices of cucumber.  I was inspired by a similar drink in Las Vegas and the outcome is delish and refreshing!  Served these on Fajita night ... out on the patio .... buen provecho!

Very good and refreshing.  I used frozen watermelon chunks to make a slushie.  And I just tossed everything into the blender including mint and juice from 1/2 lime because I'm basically lazy.  My son really loved it.

We made this for a dinner with friends last night and it turned out wonderfully.  Not only did it taste great, the color was gorgeous and made a nice presentation.  I did make a few adjustments per other reviewers suggestions.  I only added about 1/4 cup sugar and I strained the watermelon puree as I poured it into the pitcher (it really was quite pulpy).

Yum, I've never had one of these. They are very refreshing. My MIL brought a delicious watermelon over for Mother's Day. We ate most of it & I only had about a cup & a half leftover so I decided to try this on a smaller scale. I'm glad I did, I really like it, thanks!

This was allright. For someone who doesn't care for watermelon (I keep trying...), to my surprise, I liked this better than I thought I would. Having said that, I didn't enjoy this enough to ever make again. For all you watermelon lovers out there, this is a real treat. Not that my two cents matters (remember, I wasn't fond of this...), but I do think the amount of sugar is a tad too much (start with less and add the suggested amount if you still feel the need to). I also think running your mixture through a strainer would be wise (my drink was a little too pulpy for my liking - and I have a VERY powerful KitchenAid blender!!!). Maybe this will float your boat, but it just didn't mine. Thanks SB! :-)

Don't have a muddler, so I just added the mint leaves to the blender and added some lime juice, as well.  The melon was very sweet, so I skipped the sugar completely (just didn't need it).  Very refreshing.

Delicious & refreshing!  I actually preferred lots more lime in mine.  Hubby wasn't a big fan, but I drank both our portions, so it worked out for me!

Next time I would add half of the sugar, taste, and add in more if it needed it.  Depending on how ripe the watermelon is, you may not nearly as much sugar.

Unfortunately, although I followed the recipe to the letter, we did not care for this recipe. It was too lumpy and it lacked taste... maybe it's due to the fact I don't have the right watermelons, but I won't be making this recipe again..

Oh my Goodness!!!  This is SO good!   I've had this saved to my box for while and just now trying it.  I wish I would have tried it when watermelon was more plentiful.  I strained mine and saved the pulp and put in freezer.  I'm thinking that's gonna be a good treat too!!!  YUMMO!!

Oh my gosh!!  I love it.  I put in the watermelon, 1/4 cup sugar and 4 packets of Splenda, which was perfect for our tastes.  Then using the  pampered chef pitcher (the one you can mix with the handle) I put in a quarter of the lime and about 8 mint leaves and then poured in the watermelon mixture.  It was great!  I was modest because it will be in the pitcher soaking up all the flavor for a while and didn't want it overpowered by dinner time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Love this recipe. Just made a single serving for myself and it's really good. The mint is a nice touch and is really refreshing for summer.

This was good...but it was too pulpy for me. I was actually looking for a recipe of a drink I had as a young child. This was not it. :) but my 2 friends that were with me when i tried it liked it.

Woh!  This turned out amazing! I ended up using twice the watermelon, and I put the mint leaves in the food processor with everything else.  I am a HUGE hater of pull, so I strained the processed juice afterwards.  I served over ice with a slice of lime as suggested and was AMAZED.  I’ve never had this drink before, but the flavors really work so well together.  The mint, the watermelon, the lime..... so amazing.  It was a very cooling drink and I definitely can see how it would go down well during a beach trip on a sunny day.  My husband is not a fan of very sweet drinks and he was very pleased by the mild sweetness.

So refreshing on a hot summer day!  I had this in Mexico, but this recipe was better because I could control the sugar.  I did a few tablespoons sugar and a few drops of liquid stevia to cut calories without compromising taste.  I squeezed the limes into the juice for a bit more tart.

I don't much care for eating watermelon, but juicing it sure was tasty especially when adding sweetened lime juice.  May want to strain before consuming.

Ok, don't freak out.  I made a lot of adjustments, but I think I would have still loved the recipe without them, so I'm breaking protocol.  Here's what I did:  I did strain the pulp as others mentioned; the only problem with that, is that it really decreases the yield - it barely made four drinks.  So if you plan on straining because you want it w/o pulp, plan accordingly.  I prefer more lime, so in addition to the muddling in the recipe, I added a splash of lime juice at the end.  Oh...and we made it 'adult' with the addition of some rum.  Really delicious and refreshing.

Totally refreshing and perfect for a summer barbeque.  I still stop to pick out the white seeds from the 'seedless' watermelon.

This was just OK.  I didnt add any sugar and the watermelon itself was plenty sweet. I wasnt a big fan of the texture but the mint was a nice touch. I enjoy trying new recipes but I wont be making this again.

I checked at several local grocery markets and couldn't find "mint leaves." So unfortunately I had to do without this specific ingredient but it was still delicious to me. I probably will make this beverage again for an intimate house party or small events.

Doubled the watermelon, only used 1/4 c. sugar and it was sweet enough for my family. Put into a pitcher and it made about 2 quarts.

This was great! I didn't add sugar as the watermelon was sweet enough for me. Instead of keeping the lime as slices I just squeezed it in before blending.  Very refreshing.

I only gave this 1 star because I felt the mint combined with the watermelon tasted like imitation watermelon flavor (think watermelon bubble gum), of which I am not a fan.

Really good. Instead of crushing the mint leaves on the bottom of the glass I just chopped them together with the watermelon. The taste was yummy and it had nice little flecks of green floating around. I made a large batch and froze it for my daughter's grad party. I hope it tastes just as good as fresh.

Omg this recipe is super refreshing and so Perfect for summer my boys loved it and they are super picky. I recommend as well 1/4 cup of sugar; usually watermelon is already sweet. GOOD TO KNOW..... A watermelon is good and sweet when it has a yellow spot, that means it ripe well .

Just mixed up a batch of this in my Vitamix.  Added a little rum to mine & Hubs, for a refreshing adult beverage at the end of a hard days work.  I didn't add as much mint as called for (only about 6 large leaves), which was good, as we don't like too much mint in our drinks.  I also just squeezed the juice of 2 limes right into the blender.  Nice, refreshing, tasty beverage.  Thanks for sharing!
