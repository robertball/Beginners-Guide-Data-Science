I went to my daughter home in Detroit,I brought this recipe with me. She has already bought the white turnips.So I used them. My grandaughter,who said she does not like turnips , tasted them and said they were good. My husband who said he just like the yellow, said I can make these again I used everything else in this recipe.

This was not a hit with us, though it may be more because we are not huge turnip fans. My husband and I both felt there was too much bacon grease. I tried it because my husband is doing low carb and I'm trying to get creative with veggies, but I won't be making this again.

I have made this twice now.  It was such a hit with both the kids and adults that I was requested to make again and my daughter in law bought the turnips for me since both her boys loved it.

I wouldn't go as far to say you could (or should) pass these off as mashed potatoes BUT these are excellent and a great way to incorporate turnips in your diet. Hubs wasn't thrilled when he saw turnips on the grocery list but I got a huge thumbs up on these in the end. I will definitely make this again!

I lessened the bacon grease based on other reviews, added about 2 tbsp light cream cheese and a little fat free milk, and spun it through the food processor for good texture.  All loved it.  Try the Garlic Mashed Cauliflower on AllRecipes for another veggie side dish!
