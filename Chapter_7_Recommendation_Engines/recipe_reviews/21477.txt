This is a recipe for sausage balls but for some reason it was changed.  You don't cook the sausage first.  If you mix the ingredients raw, they come out fantastic!

These aren't dry at all if you don't brown the sausage before you cook them in the oven.  Just let the sausage get room temperature and mix with the other ingredients and it will completely cook in the oven.  Makes a big difference!!!

Brought these to a party and they were the "joke" of the party.  But.......at the end of the party, they were all gone!  So someone must've loved them!  Oh, to prevent the dryness that others mentioned, i didn't drain all the sausage grease, that seemed to keep them "moist".

I just want to offer some advice...This is the same recipe I use to make sausage balls and the directions are all wrong.  You are NOT supposed to cook the sausage first!!! I'm not surprised so many people had such poor results!!

my cooked meat would not stick together with other ingredients. there are comparable recipies where you do not cook meat first that worked out better for me.

I liked this recipe, but it is not for those who fear heartburn.  Make sure not to overcook the sausage, it makes all the difference.

Excellent for parties! Very easy to make, however, the mixture is decieving at first. I didn't think it would hold together in balls, but you just have to kinda squeeze them together. I had 2,5,&6 yr old helpers. The balls were a great hit with everyone!

This was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted it tasted like straight baking mix you needed some sort of liquid to put in.  I will never make this again

This recipe goes under 'What was I thinking?'  I found if you DON'T cook the sausage first and add about 1/4 cup of milk it works, but the recipe as written is a flop.

Went over great at holiday party.  Best with extra extra sharp cheddar and the spicy pork sausage. Simple and tasty!
