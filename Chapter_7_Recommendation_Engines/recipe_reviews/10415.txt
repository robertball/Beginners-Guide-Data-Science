These turned out great, but we changed them a little.  I wanted a light dough, so I replaced cocoa with same amount of flour.  And we decorated the cookies with royal icing instead of dipping into chocolate.  And finally, we made it a lot easier when we cut the cookies 1/4 inch thick instead of 1/8 inch.  And instead of craft sticks, we used barbecue skewers inserted directly into the cookie dough before baking.  We do many, many cookie bouquets and cookie pops and we never soak our skewers and we've never had a problem.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe, Robin.

Very good!  They took a bit of time to make from start to finish but were well worth it.  I tasted without the white chocolate coating and thought they were dry; but tasting a dipped and cooled cookie I found them to be perfectly crunchy and delicious. The icing didn't set as expected, but I used powdered egg whites instead of the real thing.  A 3" heart is much too big; a smaller, 2" is the perfect size for school parties. Thanks for the recipe!  I’ll be making more this weekend!

These were ok.  The cookie by itself was kind of dry and bland.  It was better with the chocolate.  My 4 year old daughter did like decorating and cutting them out though!  I did like how you rolled the dough between the wax paper and froze it for a few minutes, easy and turned out good.  I may look for a better chocolate cookie recipe next time though!

Made these for the grands for Valentine's day. I agree w/ so many others...w/out the chocolate these were dry & tasteless. (I thought they tasted like cocoa-flavored cardboard). I suspect that the dryness may be necessary to maintain the integrity of the cookie as a lollipop though...if they were moist, they would probably crumble. They looked great & tasted fine after dipping them in the chocolate so I will probably use the recipe again. I sprinkled mine w/ red colored sugar before decorating but no way am I gonna post a pic & put it up next to SugarPlumsCookie's. ;o)  Thansk for sharing the recipe Robin...my grands enjoyed them & I had fun making them.

I give this recipe 5 stars for looks, but 2 stars for taste,  i followed this recipe to a T, but alas... I made these for my son's preschool class valentines party, they looked awesome and held together great (i thought for sure they'd fall right off the stick) the kids ate them and enjoyed them.  My husband and i love cookies, but not these.  I think the recipe calls for to much cocoa, and not enough sugar.  The cookies tasted like cocoa powder.  They were really hard too.

I too thought the cookie itself was dry and not very flavorful.  Also, I didn't have enough white chocolate to coat the cookies.  But I used the conversion chart to double the recipe.  
I must say though that these all sold within 5 minutes for our PTA fundraiser!

These were time consuming but so delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, doubting the little amount of sugar, the heavy amount of cocoa and the dough consistancy made me fearful of crumble.  I'm glad I changed nothing, they were really fabulous in taste and presentation.

Great idea!  I’m going to make these for my children to give at Valentine’s Day to their classmates.  I looked online and found cello bags with hearts on them from a company called Box and Wrap.  They are super cute are very inexpensive!
