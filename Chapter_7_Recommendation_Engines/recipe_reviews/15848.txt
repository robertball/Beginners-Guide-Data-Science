My cheese balls turned-out perfectly, but I made these changes: Substituted olives for small cocktail sausages, cut into thirds. Used cayenne pepper, instead of paprika, adjusting the heat to your preference. Used parchment paper, and do not overcook-adjust time according to your oven-mine was 20 minutes cooking time. I put toothpicks in each one and they were very impressive on a platter and delicious. I made some them ahead of time and froze them in a zip-lock bag, after refrigerating them for several hours to prevent them from sticking together in the bag. I allowed the frozen ones to sit out before baking about 30 minutes before baking, otherwise they can be dry. This is my favorite snack for my family, and they like a large pecan  inside the ball, instead of an olive or sausage to change it up. I put a few drops of food color in the dough to mix  them up: Red food color for hot with cayenne and sausages....Green for olives...Yellow for pecans....Looks pretty for buffet table. I used Kraft Shreddered sharp cheddar cheese only for the best flavor. JUst experiment, but too much flour will make them dry. The pan does not need to be greased, and using parchment paper makes an easy clean-up possible. The heat from sausages, tabasco, or cayenne pepper picks it up, and you can always omit the heat for those who can't eat it. The food coloring of the dough allows everyone to choose their preference.Enjoy!

This is a good recipe, but to make it great...use cayenne pepper instead of paprika and green olives instead of black.  It's very easy and very tasty!

This sounds very similar to a recipe my mother made every Christmas.  She made the cheese "dough" with the Kraft Old English cheese spread in the little glass jar instead of cheddar, and added a pinch of cayenne pepper.  She used the whole, green spanish olives instead of black olives.  These have a little bit of a kick to them and they always go FAST, so double the recipe!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I made these and no one liked them except the dog.  They were dry and all you really tasted was the cheese.

Yum. This is so straight forward to make and always popular. I did substitute green olives for black, and cayenne pepper instead of paprika as well.

I was a bit disappointed because in the oven these do not retain their shape. In fact,they end up flat with a round bump in the middle and I don't have to tell you which part of the female anatomy they resemble. Very greasy and floury, too. My dog loved the scraps I didn't eat.

My family loves these!  We are huge olive fans and I was looking for a way to change them up a bit.  My only tip is to use real butter and not the newer soft baking butter, they lose their form a bit with the baking butter.

These are a little work, but the results are great!  My neighbor immediately asked for the recipe and my (picky) mother-in-law liked them, too.  I made them early in the day and kept them in the fridge.  In the evening, I just popped them in the oven and voil√°! They were done in no time.

I found this a very easy recipe to do. My ten yr old daughter helped, too. We used it for our Holiday party at work.  They came out great!  Thanks! Note: I did not use the paprika.

Yum, these are so good. I lost this recipe from at least 40 years ago and am so glad to have found it again on allrecipes. They do just melt in your mouth.

Very easy to prepare, but extremely bland with black olives.  Suggest using any type of stuffed green olive.  Garlic and almond stuffed were excellent.

This was not what I remembered from my childhood at all.  I even used sharp cheddar cheese.  One thing, though.  I used small olives and it probably would have been better with at least a medium sized olive.

VERY tasty, and the dough is PERFECT.  I hate a lot of bread and was hesitant on the breading, but it was cheesy and delicious! The only complaint is that after cooking they were VERY oily, so a little too fatty for me, even after using reduced fat butter.  Otherwise, tasty!!!

Too bland. I used kalamata olives to jazz it up a bit bit they still turned out really bland. And they were rather greasy. I won't be making this one again.

I made a batch with black olives and a batch with green olives and served them at a party. Everybody loved them! Use BUTTER, not margarine. Takes a little time to wrap the olives, but  they're very good.

I tried making these for a shower and was very disappointed. I followed the directions exactly but they were a little too greasy for me and they had no flavor to them. I would definitely recommend skipping this recipe.

This was great WITH additions, some which have been mentioned. I used Mexican 4-Cheese, a few hardy shakes of garlic & onion powder + some red pepper & then only 1/2 t. paprika. After mixing the dough, just taste it & adjust seasonings. I made some w/ stuffed green olives, well dried off & some I stuffed w/ pecan halves. I rolled the pecans into logs instead of balls. BTW, I've had a similar recipe for yrs. that calls for 1/2 c. chopped pecans in the dough & no stuffing. The dough is formed into 2 logs (1 1/2 in. diameter) & chilled until firm & then sliced to cook, 400 degrees for 10 minutes.

I read all of the reviews prior to making this and I'll admit some made me giggle a little bit. I am not a baker and am dough challenged so I didn't even bother trying to tweak but just made as written. I too had the same problems as the others. They were dry, very flour-y, the olive got lost, and they melted down like cookies instead of the pretty balls they started out as on the cookie sheet. I think there is probably an easy fix to these but being dough challenged I don't really know what to suggest.
