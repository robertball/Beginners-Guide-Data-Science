I cut the dressing down to 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream, 2 tbsp dill and 1 tbsp lemon pepper.

I thought the 3 cups made too much dressing for a pound of pasta.

This has become "my" pasta salad recipe that I take to picnics and barbecues.  It's nice and creamy, although I think it calls for a little too much dill.  I half the dill, and the salad still has a good taste, but it's not overpowering.  I also like to add about 1/8 cup of parmesan cheese for a little extra flavor.

This is a ton of mayo and sour cream. I cut way back on that and the dill and also added spices and a lot more vegies with the addition of feta cheese.

I have made this pasta salad for a few years now, and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews.  I am asked for the recipe every time I make this salad.  It is definately a family favorite!  I like to make this salad using bow tie pasta.  I think it is very important to allow time for the flavors to mix.  Make sure to refrigerate the salad for a few hours before serving.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Seasoned perfectly!  This recipes makes a lot, so you'll be eating it for days unless you make it for a crowd.  Although good, it needs more variety of ingredients (maybe black olives, etc.)

What a yummy yet easy salad.  I made this salad for my office pot luck and it was a huge hit.  I added a large red onion, black olives, and a bottle of italian dressing to give the salad a little more flavor.  I also used a little less dill as suggested by the other reviewers.

Man!  Was this good!  I ate a bowl full of it before even putting it in the fridge. Yum!!  You know how pasta soaks up the dressing and you usually have to add more the next day?  Well, not with this.  It did soak it up, but when I had a bowl at noon today the dressing amount was just right.  What a great way to use all those tomatoes and cucumbers coming out of the garden right now.  Thanks Kristy!

I found the missing ingredient as mentioned by Nina 3/6/08.Worchestershire Sauce! I added 4 teaspoons of Worchestershire Sauce to the sauce mixture. I also made some of the changes others have suggested: I put in 1 tbsp of dill, 2 tbsp of Lemon pepper, 1/2 cup fresh shredded parmesan cheese, green bell pepper, 3 tomatoes, 1/2 cup chopped red onion, black olives.  I used 3/4 of the mayo/sour cream mixture (all of it would be too much) but preferred the taste of the proportion of 1 cup sour cream and 2 cups mayo.  I took it to a neighborhood cookout and everyone loved it!  With these changes I rank it a 5-star and will do it again.

As written, the recipe has some issues - it is however a good base. I agree with previous reviewers, the recipe calls for twice too much mayo, sour cream, and dill. I highly recommend making the dressing in a separate bowl and adding it to the pasta in small increments to ensure you don't over dress. I added red onion and green pepper for added texture.

Refreshing salad on a hot day!  I used shell pasta rather than penne and added small amount of onion.

I loved it the way it was written (I only added one extra tomato), and my teens and hubby said there was way to much dill. I plan on making this for my Daughter's Graduation Party, but will make two changes based upon my family's comment about the dill and the fact that I found this exact recipe at www.redgold.com.
I will use 1.5 tablespoons of Dill, and instead of the Roma tomatoes, I will use two 14.5 ounce cans Petite Diced Tomatoes with Sweet Onions. Is it creamy? YES! But that's what made it taste so good the next day! Much better after sitting overnight! A+ Thank you for sharing! This just may be my go to pasta for future outings!

FANTASTIC! My family has been raving about this since I made it. Don't mind the people who say it's too creamy...it's perfect! Here are the changes I made, which I HIGHLY recommend:  1. Use grape or cherry tomatoes,   2. use seedless cucumbers (regular cucumbers sometimes can create a sort of gritty texture in pasta salads)   3. Add diced olives of any variety (I used green, but I imagine black or kalamata would be just as awesome)   4. I used colored spiral pasta (Penne pasta doesn't seem right here to me)  This dish is good if served immediately, but takes on an entirely new characteristic if let to sit overnight or longer.

Instead of the dill weed, I use finely diced dill pickles (polish/kosher).  As well, I add finely diced yellow brick cheddar cheese.  It's a summer favourite in our house.  My son-in-law insists on having the leftovers to take home.

We really liked this cucumber/tomato pasta salad.  We wanted to find a recipe where we could use cucumbers and tomatoes out of our garden and were happy with the results!  I used tri-colored spiral pasta (12 oz) and cut the mayo and sour cream basically in half which was enough and only put 1 Tbl of dill weed which was also plenty.  Instead of lemon pepper (which I didnt have) I used 1 Tbl lemon herb seasoning (which didn't have salt) and 1 Tbl seasoned salt and added some black olives.  Very tasty!  Thank you for sharing!  Will make again :)

I should have gone with my instinct on this one and reduced the lemon pepper or added it to taste.  It was far to strong.  No one liked it.  Even with that problem, it was rather bland.  You could only taste dill and lemon pepper, nothing else.  I think it needs some onion and a little salt.

I am so glad I listened to everyone on halving the mayo and sour cream.  It was so creamy with just half of the dressing, I can't imagine what all of it would have looked like!  Also, I didn't have any cucumbers on hand, so I used green peppers and it still turned out super yummy.  Even the 2 year old loved it!

Really good & really easy!  I too took some advice from other reviewers and cut the mayo to 1 cup.  Also added some fresh lemon juice.  I love dill so it wasn't too much for me :) I used farfalle instead of penne, but that was a personal preference.

This is fantastic! I used small wagon wheels instead of the penne. I initially tried to cut down on the mayo, but it was too dry. I suggest following the recipe exactly. I made this for my son's birthday party and it got rave reviews.

This was pretty good, there is a lot of dill in this and I advise to cut back. I made this for a family picnic and it was a big hit. I think I will add some shrimp or crab meat to my next batch, to kinda make it a meal on it's own, with some bread.

I ususally don't change the original recipe but there are so many reviewers that said the dressing was too much, so I halved the mayo,sour cream and dill.

I thought this was really good.  I did add more veggies because (once I tasted it) I thought it needed more - Vidalia onion and green pepper and I also added feta cheese.  With these additions it was perfect!

Made this one for a picnic with my boyfriend. We went with other reviewers' recommendations of cutting back on the mayo, sour cream and dill - we cut the amounts almost in half - but I still found it to be way too much dressing for the amount of pasta. I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise though, so that might've been part of the problem. My boyfriend enjoyed it much more, but did mention that the dill was a little overwhelming.

Recommendations: cut back on the mayo and sour cream and dill - use half of what the recipe calls for or less. Also, making it a day ahead of time might help the flavors work together better - I definitely enjoyed it more the second day.

Good, but I agree with most reviewers on this site - the recipe as it is calls for way too much mayo, sour cream, and dill. IF you cut down on that part it is a good recipe.  I did add bite size pepperoni pieces to my salad and it added a nice kick .

I followed other reviewers advice and cut the mayo and sour cream down by half.  I used fresh dill instead of dried, and it looked and smelled delicious when I mixed everything together.  However, after being refrigerated for several hours, the dressing itself was no longer creamy and the flavour was a bit bland.  Maybe it does need that much dressing...

I'm not sure if I should rate this recipe or post the one I created from it! This recipe is a great start for the base flavors of a basic pasta salad. Many of the reviews this got had suggestions or negative feedback. A simple solution to this salad is to create the dressing in a separate bowl, tasting frequently and flavoring as you go. Once you've got a good flavor, then add to the pasta and veggies. But add only as much as you like. Just because you have three cups of dressing, doesn't mean you have to add all of it.  I added carrots, black olives,and chopped red onions in addition to the veggies in the recipe. For the dressing I used 1/2 c. fat free mayo, 1/2 c. fat free miracle whip, 2 tbs Fat Free Ranch Dressing, 2 Giant Scoops of Sour Cream. It was approx 2 cups of dressing total. To that I added Worcestershire sauce, dill, cracked black pepper, onion salt, and lemon pepper. I just continued to taste the dressing until I liked the flavor. Then I folded it in with the pasta.   Mine turned out great.

I was a bit skeptical about the simple ingredients but I happened to have everything on hand for short notice family get together & every single person wanted to know where I got the recipe & could I share!  I followed the ingredients to a T but used the new Olive Oil Mayo cause that's the only kind I had...funny though, the salad went so fast I didn't get to taste it.  Time to make again!

I have been making this for years, my kids love it and request a huge batch of it for camping. I do make a few changes though, less mayo and I add dill pickles instead of dill, and also add celery. And it definitely is better after it sits in the fridge for a few hours before serving it!! It's great!

I have to agree with some of the other reviews...need more tomato, dill was fine (similat to amount that would be in a dill-based veggie dip)and if  you don't want a "dried out" salad Mayo/s. cream amount IS appropriate!   Thing I didn't care for was the lemon-pepper.  If I were to make this again, which I won't, I would double tomato and decrease/omit Lemon Pepper.

excellent salad, add extra cucumber and tomato and a pound of bason, cut into 1" pieces, fried crisp and drained.  Decrease dill by 1/3.  Totally awesome as a lunch by itself or great with grilled chicken, fish or steak....

I would advise cutting back on the dill - tasted great, but we were still tasting it hours after actually eating it!  I also added red onion, feta cheese and a little grated parmesan.  Excellent!

I love this salad, and did cut back the mayo by 1 cup and halved the dill weed and lemon pepper due to others' reviews.  However, after refrigerating it overnight, much of the mayo/sour cream had been absorbed and it needed more creaminess; so I will be only cutting the mayo back to 1-1/2 cups...and adding some salt.

I made this exactly by the recipe, but with worst quality ingredients and it still turned out great! I love dill and this hit the spot. I had never thought of lemon/pepper in a pasta salad, but it compliments everything to a tee. I have terrible cheap lemon/pepper seasoning and store bought winter tomatoes and cucumbers... but it is still wonderful! You'll be glad you tried it! In the future, I may add more cucumbers and tomatoes combined with some onion just to make it fit my palate a little more.  Thanks for sharing ILOVETOCOOK!

Tried this just last night and although it was good... it couldve definately used less mayo & sour cream.  Next time I make it I will cut the mayo to 1 cup and the sour cream to 4 oz.

Calls for WAY too much dill and I wasn't a big fan of the base. I tried adding a little bit of ranch to the mix and that helped. Would probably not make again.

I made this recipe from what I had on hand-- green bell peppers instead of cucumbers and I added black olives-- delicious!  For the sauce I used about 1 cup sour cream, 3/4 cup lite mayo and a couple tablespoons of ranch dressing.  For seasoning I didn't have dill OR lemon pepper, so I used a couple sprigs of lemon juice, a lot of fresh cracked pepper, onion powder, some garlic, salt, crushed red pepper flakes (for a delicious kick!) and a bit of cayenne pepper too.  It was a huge hit! I had it for dinner last night and lunch today, and I'm still craving it!

Way too much dill and mayo for our taste.  If you really LOVE dill you may really like this pasta salad but I think if you try this recipe cut the mayo in half to start with because you obviously cannot take any back out.  I do think adding some garlic salt might make this recipe better.

I'm sorry, but there is way too much mayo and sour cream going on in this recipe. None of my coworkers were fond of this pasta salad and I myself found it to be pretty bland. I won't be making this again, but thanks anyway.

This is very good with modifications- that is why its receiving 4 stars.  I halved the Mayo, added 1-2 tomatoes, and I halfed the dill.  
Took it to a baby shower and received compliments!!

This was really good.  I made a few small changes just for my families taste prefrences...I used 2 Tbsp. of dill, 1/4 c. of grated parmesan, and left out the lemon pepper seasoning.  Next time I will try the suggestion of adding a little bacon, but it was great without it!

This is a very good pasta salad although I probably wouldn't say "best ever".  It is VERY easy to make.  I only added 1 1/2 Tbl of dill weed, which was plenty.  I also prefer it chilled for awhile to give the flavors time to marinate together.  I used about 12 grape tomatoes (halved) instead of plum tomatoes.

That being said, I served it to company and it went over very well.  I plan to make it again in the future.

This was very good but I added pre-cooked chicken to this to make a main dish. Overall, very nice recipe.

This is a great pasta salad for the summer.  I used english cucumbers, an extra tomato,and a little kosher salt.  It was a big hit.  It has a nice crunchy feel, yet is smooth and creamy.

I reduced both the dill and lemon pepper to 1Tbls. +1tsp. each. Also added 4 oz. can of sliced black olives. My husband does not generally like cold pasta salads, but I gave this one a try and he LOVED it! It has great flavor and texture and is extremely yummy! Definitely a must to have in the recipe box for it's ease and taste!

Yech!  What a waste!  I've had a similair pasta salad, so I had high hopes for this one, but it was awful!  I can't believe I made it when company was over, I was ashamed to serve it to them.  I thought that was way too much mayo/sour cream, so I just used 2 cups of sour cream, and that was PLENTY of sauce.  Also, after 2 tablespoons of dill, the whole salad was coated, so I stopped.  Everything else I did the same, but it was just not to my liking.  Good luck to anyone else who wants to try it, I have no idea why everyone else loved it so much.

I tried to adapt this recipe by adding 8 oz yogurt and 8 oz sour cream instead of mayo and it turned out awful.  Haven't tried it the other way, just wanted to warn anyone else who may try this.

Our family loves dill so this was perfect.  Very tasty and very refreshing.  The only addition I made was purple onion, not much though.  Do not add any salt or pepper until you taste it, to me, does not need any.

I used to eat this all the time as a kid and still love it to this day. I omit the sour cream (the mayo is more than enough) but otherwise leave as is. Great side dish to use up our surplus of cucumbers and tomatoes!

Followed recipe exactly. Love this recipe! It's basically like a basic dip. And it makes a ton! What I also like about this recipe is that 1. you can use it minus the veggies and pasta for dip. 2. minus the pasta for a dressing. How great is that?! I make this several times in the summer.

Fantastic pasta recipe...has a very different twist to the dressing used with the dill weed and lemon pepper seasonings.  I added more cucumber and tomato (mainly because my garden is flourishing and I love these fresh ingredients!) and it is still wonderful!  Thanks for the great recipe!

As it is written this recipe has too much dressing.  Another reviewer said that it was to keep it from drying out?  There is NO chance of that.  Cut the mayo by half and the dill and I think it would be a good recipe.  Will try it again but will make the changes I mentioned.

I used 1/2 the amount of dill and lemon pepper. You need to like dill for this recipe. I do like dill and this was a nice change for pasta salad. My hubby does not like dill, so I will not tell you what he said about this. I took this to work for a potluck and I did not get any good responces, no responce was understood not to bring again!

Great pasta salad - It was the hit of the party! I would suggest cutting back on the mayo and adding more veggies.

Delicious! I think the lemon pepper really makes this stand out. I'll be making this again and again!

I found it lacking in flavor a bit.  I ended up adding cayenne pepper afterwards which really kicked it up.  Next time I'll keep the recipe the same with cayenne pepper and maybe I'll try some different veggies.

This was a really great pasta salad AFTER it was completely chilled.  My only
suggestion is to cut down on the amount of dill you use if you use fresh.  I went
by the standard 1 tsp dried dill=3 tsp fresh dill.  It was a little much, but, I still
enjoyed it anyway.  I also added a little more tomatoes than called for.  All in all,
this recipe was very good and with the changes, I will make it again.

This wasn't terrible--but only make it if you really like dill and cucumbers--niether of which I'm too high on.

This is a tasty pasta salad with lots of possibilities.  I added onions and green peppers for a little more veggie variety.  It's easy to do and goes well at a barbecue.

I just made this salad and my daughter and I can't stop eating it!!  The only change I made was to substitute plain yoghurt for the sour cream.   It's delicious!!  Can't wait to make it for a pot luck.

I think this could have been better. I don't like dill so I left that out, and I cut down the mayo. I think I would have liked it better if I cut down the lemon pepper. The taste was almost overwhelming.

This was very bland to me and was tasteless. I followed other's advice on cutting  back on the mayo and sour cream but then  I added more thinking it would give some taste to it.  I also added more dill and lemon pepper. Will not fix this again.

I just made this and agree with what alot of other people said, cut the dressing in half (1c of mayo and 1c of sour cream) and it was still more than enough. I added artichoke, black olives, and yellow pepper, very tasty!

I really wanted to like this, and maybe it was just me, but I really was not impressed with this recipe. I felt like it was missing something, but since I'm not sure what it was I probably won't make this again. I just hated wasting all those veggies, but it just seemed bland and the dill was the only thing I could taste. I can see how this recipe has potential, but I'm not sure what to do to make it better. I'll keep looking for a pasta salad recipe, sorry.

This was a very easy salad to make. It would be good with some other veggies and black olives.
