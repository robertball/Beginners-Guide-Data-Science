This is good, but if you are picky about the appearance of your appetizers, you may have a problem with the layers of skin that develops on the top as it sits. Stirring does take care of it if you donâ€™t mind the maintenance of it. The flavor is very good though!

Yum! It is a little thin but so good!  So good, I started to eat it by itself.

This was very good.  I made this for my wedding (tripled the recipe) and everyone liked it.  I actually used ground beef instead of ground pork and I added a cup of salsa as well.  I will be making this recipe in the future when I entertain.

This is so much better than typical velveeta and rotel! I did make a couple of changes.  I did not add the pork (wasn't missed at all).  I did add a cup of salsa (as suggested in another review).  We loved it!  Will make it again

Pretty darn good!!  I would have liked it be have been a bit thicker...I added about a half cup of corn starch...it still could have been a bit thicker.  Over all, the flavor was very good.

This recipe was so good!  I made it for a New Year's Eve party and everybody loved it!  I didn't have any pork and it was just as good with out it.  I also ended up throwing in about 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 cup of salsa, and a small can on sliced olives.  I also used a can of spicy diced tomatoes with green chillies.  This is one recipe I will be making again and again!

Very good cheesy dip. This was creamy and had a great flavor with the sausage. My hubby loved this stuff. It wasn't spicy at all. I used Wolf brand chili no beans. It was good but I prefer plain Rotel and cheese dip instead. I didn't drain the juice from the can, just dumped it all in, and it was fine. Hubs is taking the leftovers for lunch. Good. Thanks.

This is one of those "you can't get enough" dips.  What a crowd-pleaser!  I made it for an office birthday celebration and the bowl was literally scraped dry!

Would have given this 5 stars if I didn't have to add cheddar cheese to thicken. As some of the other reviews have said, this is quite a thin dip. I added 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese to thicken. Took to a book club and everyone loved it. Some ladies poured the dip over chips and ate them as nachos. Very easy and great flavor.
