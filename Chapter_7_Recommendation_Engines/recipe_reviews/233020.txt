This was quick but needed a bit more than what is written to kick it up. We're vegan so I used vegan "beef" broth and added some Braggs Liquid Aminos and soy sauce, plus some garlic. I also used vegan swiss on top of my whole wheat baguette slice. Nice for a quick lunch but add your own spin.

Made sure to use "beef broth", not those cubes and simmered broth with thyme a few minutes and let set to meld flavors. A good strong cheese gave this soup a nice flavor family was happy with. Not having to chop the onions was a real time saver. Maybe add some garlic next time, I love my garlic and Birds Eye has a onion and garlic blend I might use next time.

This was just ok the way written.  I added some sherry and garlic to give it a bit more flavor.  I liked the ease of the already chopped onions but I did feel like it was lacking in taste.  With some tweaks this would be very good.

I'm gonna have to agree with Patty Cakes on this one...no flavor! I ended up adding garlic, salt and pepper, and thickened it w/ a slurry of wine and Wondra flour. I do like the concept and ease of this and the idea of not having to chop a ton of onions is a major time saver, but as written, it is definitely lacking.

Was not a big fan, I made it as written except I used a roux to make it thicker. The flavor was missing. Sorry
