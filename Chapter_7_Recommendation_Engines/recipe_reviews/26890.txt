Excellent! Here's my tip. Skip the marinara completely. Once out of the oven and cooled so they are firm but still warm, drizzle a creamy garlic butter/garlic paste over them. That way you get a nice garlic flavor over the base of cheesy dough. My wife and I loved them! :)

I've made these two times for my husband and they turned out great both times.  The second time I added garlic salt and pepper for an added kick.  If you have had problems with the milk, your heat may have been to high, try turning it down and try the recipe againg - they are really good.

Fantastic!

The secret to these is keeping the balls REALLY SMALL as the recipe says; do not go above one rounded tsp. and you won't get soggy middles.

I added: garlic salt, about 1 tsp. dried basil, fresh black pepper, and about 1/2 cup grated cheddar.

Watch them carefully so the bottoms don't burn; if they start over-cooking just turn it down to 350 for the last while.

Thank you so much for these! They're beautiful & delicious.

Great Idea!!!  This is basically a cream puff recipe with cheese added.  I have made basic puffs many x's. Instructs are a bit vague and my recipe for uses water instead of the milk. Made recipe twice as follows:  1/2 c water, 1/4 margarine or butter (both work), 1/2 c flour, 2 eggs  1/2 tsp Garlic Herb seasoning with 1/2 c real Parm. cheese or 1/2 tsp dry ranch mix with 3/4 c cheddar.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Heat water, butter and seasoning to a rolling boil.  Stir flour in vigourously over low heat until mixture forms a ball. Remove from heat.  Beat in eggs, all at once with an electric mixer until smooth and a bit drier.  Drop by tsp or small cookie scoop onto wax paper lined pan.  Bake until puffed and golden. The leavening is the eggs. Important that they are beaten (with a mixer) into the flour mix until smooth and gets a bit drier looking.  I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes for puffs the size of a walnut.  Normally puffs are filled with something.  Try these sliced open with a chunck of string cheese , pepperoni, cream cheese etc. Use your imagination. Enjoy!!

This was the easiest appetizer I've ever made that looked somewhat complex, and everyone loved them. They are a perfect winter appetizer as they come out hot, crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. I doubled the receipe to serve 12 at Thanksgiving.

I also tried to make these twice.  Didn't have a problem with the milk separating but the first batch was burnt on the bottom and they are extremely greasy!  The second batch I don't know what went wrong but it was way too sticky and liquidy to even form a ball with. I would never make them again!

I don't know why some reviewers have rated this recipe so low because every time I've made them for parties, they are gone within 10 minutes!  I suspect any low ratings (e.g. coming out flat, not cooking right) may have come from not following the directions exactly.  That is extremely important for this recipe to come out as intended.  Do NOT attempt to skip steps (I know this from experience!).  For instance, skipping step #2 will result in them coming out flat.  Also, be sure to follow the sizing specs when putting them on the pan.  It calls for rounded teaspoonfuls, not tablespoon.  They will come out a respectable size, fully-cooked in the time indicated.  Finally, use an electric mixer!  This will help incorporate the egg into the flour ball and make them more "puffy."

This is an easy recipe that came out great! I seem to like the puffs a little bigger so I let them cook longer (about 25-30 min) and then took them out of the oven to let the insides cook. My roommate kept coming out to have more and she asked me for the recipe. I've eaten them both warm and cold, with and without warm or cold marina sauce, they still taste good.

This is an excellent recipe. I definately need to double or triple the batch next time. I didn't have any problems with the milk curdling(I used skim milk) and thought that the recipe was very easy to make.

These are easy to make, and came out fantastic. I didn't pull out any appliances - just used a big spoon - and it mixed fine.  I also didn't bother with marinara sauce or anything else.  I decided to taste on their own, and they're just fine with nothing.  I used actual grated parmesan (not the sawdust stuff!)  And I had none of the problems I've seen here - too eggy, too much cheese taste, too little cheese taste, came out flat, came out filled with air in the middle.  Mine were perfect.  I am not a very experienced cook, and I found these to be super-easy and well worth the minimal effort required. If I served for company, I would probably put something out for dipping, but honestly for myself I loved them as is.  Will definitely use this recipe over and over!

We had this with lasagna last evening and it was a big hit.  I was a little alarmed thinking that they were not completely done, but I let them set for about 5 mins out of the oven and they were perfect.

Need to cook longer than noted in the recipe or else they will fall flat when cooling.  But once I made that adjustment, they worked great and family loved them.  Special occasion food though.  very high calorie.

I got mixed reviews on these - they're basically the same as an eclair dough except for the cheese.  I've found with eclairs that people either love them or hate them, and that was the case here as well.  Personally, I liked them but be aware that some people HATE that eggy taste you get with these.

These turned out very well.  The texture was perfect, soft on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.  I used a whisk to combine the flour with the milk/margarine which combined it well, but had some trouble getting it out of the whisk.  Then I took it off the heat and pushed the mixture to the side.  Added the eggs to the side of the mixture, whisked them and then mixed it all together.  Worked very well.  These made a lovely appetizer for our Valentine's Day dinner.  Thanks for sharing!

These turned out so well, and they were absolutley delicious.  All of them were gone within five minutes of them coming out of the oven. The only thing I did differently was add small cubes of aged white cheddar instead of grated parmesean, and they so good. In fact, i'm going to make them again tonight!

yum!I really liked these parmesan puffs.
I used real parmesan cheese and rolled them into lil balls before baking them.
I then brushed melted butter and garlic over them and served them with a warm pizza sauce.the puffs were not bland at all and was not over powered by the sauce.this is a keeper.

Not bad!  Easy to make, too.  My husband could only eat two before he got tired of the Parmesan flavor.  I tried dipping them in leftover spaghetti sauce, and could only taste the sauce.  I probably wouldn't make them on a regular basis, but they'd be fine for every once in a while!  Maybe next time I'll add some garlic powder.  =)

I tried making this recipe TWICE!  Both times, when I brought the milk to a boil, it curdled and separated - it was disgusting.  (The first time I used 2% milk, the second time I used regular milk.)  I stirred it constantly as I was bringing it to a boil.  Not sure if there's another way to prepare this recipe; good luck if you choose to try it.

The key to baking the shells is placing them in a hot oven. Oven temperature is important since that is  what will turn the moisture to steam expanding the dough to double or triple its' size and then baking them just until light brown and crispy around the edges.  For those who prefer a stronger cheese flavor try using asiago cheese instead, or a blend of parmesan and asiago cheeses.  Makes 16-18 puffs when using about one tablespoon of dough for each (about 1" balls). I used a cookie scoop to portion dough. These are quick and easy to make and so delicious!

These were bland and greasy. My recommendation is to add onions/onion powder, garlic powder, maybe a dash of Italian seasoning. I found baking them in mini muffin tins to be a good size.

I really liked these. I made them into a abr but they were still so good right out of the oven. I'd warm them up because I didnt like them cold.

To avoid sticking, use parchment paper to bake these tasty little treats.  I used a hotter oven, 400 degrees, and shortened the cooking time to about 18 minutes.  I added minced garlic, (1 large clove), 1/2 t. ground pepper, and 1 t. ground Italian seasoning.  They were excellent fresh out of the oven.

Too strong of a flavor. Maybe it was because I used fresh grated Parmesan?? I also couldn't get the center to cook properly, even after adjusting oven temp. and cutting them open. Would not make again.

These were good, but a bit eggy.  Mine took  about 5 more minutes than stated to bake.  I'm not sure how they'd be cold, and since I have a few left I'm a bit worried.  I just used a spoon to mix the flour in and it was fine, but it was quite difficult to mix in all the ingredients at the end.  I was a bit worried about the egg cooking in the mix, so I put a bit of the mixture in the egg to warm it up and gradually added the egg into the mixture.  That seemed to work.  I'd probably use less egg next time and I'll try it with marinara sauce--we just ate it plain this time.

I think this is one of those recipes that you and your family is either going to love or hate.  I wouldn't be expecting anything when you make it, because this one is like no other.  It reminds me more of a biscuit than a puff.  I enjoyed it, and the recipe was incredibly easy, and fun!

They were ok. Mine didn't come out like they looked in the picture. They looked more like biscuits you would find at Red Lobster. They tasted good but the sauce overpowered the taste of the bread. I will try making them again though.

These would be a good starter for chicken parmesan.  I got 20 from this recipe dropping them with my cookie scoop by rounded teaspoon, but ended up baking them for 20 minutes.  I think baking them less time would leave them doughy in the center.  Mine came out pretty light and soft inside, but not doughy.  Good flavor--next time I think I will add some garlic.  I used a parmesan/romano mix of cheese and they're so good.  I wonder if they would work with a piece of string cheese in the center--will have to try that next time.  They couldn't be easier to make.  These definitely go in my recipe box!

Tasted exactly like those Goldfish Crackers. They don't rise, so next time I will try adding Yeast. Definitely an easy recipe to play with and customize to your liking.

So delicious and addictive. Followed the recipe but added oregano and cracked black pepper. At first, the puffs came out soft, but I let them set in the off oven for 5 mins and they were fine. Easy and good!

I just wasn't excited about these. I don't know if it was the consistency or that there was maybe too much Parmesan cheese. Just not my thing.

These were excellent! I made them for a coffee morning and they disappeared in minutes.  I added a little bit of finely chopped prosciutto to jazz them up a bit, as well as some garlic powder and cayenne pepper... delicious! Have made them twice in two days and will definitely have these as a favourite canapé recipe.  A keeper, for sure. Thanks for the recipe, Laura!

This recipe was SUPER easy to make! (& very fast). I used a hand held mixer/beater after I put the eggs in, just for a minute or 2, then added the parmasan cheese and then made the balls. They balls turned out to be a lot smaller than I thought they would be, but now looking at other people's photos of this recipe (on this site), I seemed to do it correctly. They were soooo good! I didn't serve it with any sauce because we ate it alongside pasta, so we could dip it in the pasta sauce, if we wanted to. Great recipe & I will for sure make it for friends!! (When I make it for my friends, I'll make it as an appetizer, served with tomato sauce or garlic buuter -yum!)

Fairly plain without any addition of spices (i.e. garlic, basil, oregano, salt, pepper).  With the addition of spices and some shredded cheddar, pretty tasty!

I was skeptical about these, considering the reviews were both good and bad. But, they turned out great. If people were having problems, it was because they didn't add enough flour. Add what it says, and then keep adding little by little, mixing each time until the dough wants to ball up. If it is too sticky, it will never rise in the oven.

These were quite good. Made them to go with dinner and followed the advice of another reviewer to drizzle garlic butter over top of them. I was nervous to plop down more than a teaspoonful of the mixture because a lot of people said that they can get too mushy if they're too big, but mine were SO tiny! I should've had spooned out a round tablespoon or even a little more. Definitely very tasty, but not sure if its worth the extra time just for some cheesy rolls.

These tasted really good. Since the recipe said it was for 8 rolls, that's how I measured it out. I think that next time I will make them smaller so that they cook more evenly. Very tasty though!

This recipe didn't work for me at all.  I used butter instead of margarine, so that might be the reason, but I also found the instructions somewhat lacking.  

I'm not a novice cook, but having never made this type of "puff" before, I had a lot of unanswered questions.  Should I use a whisk or a spoon?  What type of pan?  Was I supposed to transfer the mixture to a bowl before adding the eggs or beat them in the hot pan I was already using?  

More specific instructions would have REALLY helped!

I'm giving these 4 stars for now because they were a little wet in the center. I made these with a really nice/complex dinner that had me pretty scattered, so there were times I had to leave the dough unattended (such as after mixing but before adding the eggs & cheese & also before putting them in the oven). I'm not sure if this is what caused my wet problem but I will try making these again when I can devote more attention to them. I'll update next time!

I thought these were ok.  I made the receipe just as stated and they became parmesan flats instead of puffs.  The taste was good though.  Maybe I did something wrong.

These puffs turned out so bland and had a rather soft squishy texture on the inside even when done.  My two year old would not even eat them.  Next time I make them I'm going to try adding a mix of fresh parmesan and asigo cheeses and add some crushed garlic and herbs for more flavor.  Brushing some melted butter on the top would probably help too.  They did look pretty though and did rise right for me.

This turned out just okay.  They were on the bland side, and were completely overshadowed by even a tiny bit of marinara sauce.  I think that, I too, will be adding garlic next time!

These were very plain.  They looked yummy & very pretty, but didn't have much of a flavor to them.  I think adding garlic would improve the recipe.  I also was expecting the insides to be lighter - they were fairly soft & dense.  They're good if you like parm cheese, because that's pretty much exactly what you taste.  I found I had to cook for about 3 or 4 minutes longer for them to be golden, and I made about 15 puffs, approx. 1 inch in diameter.

After reading previous reviews, I added 1/2 tsp. crushed garlic and an 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper to the milk and butter mixture, for additional flavor. The dough is quite similar to cream puff dough. I am used to working with this type of dough, as I have been making cream puffs for 30 years. These puffs did not rise correctly, did not brown nicely and they collapsed as they cooled. I can only assume the addition of the cheese produces a heavier dough. The flavor was good but the finished product was disappointing.

They were pretty simple to make but i found them to be kind of plain tasting.  Maybe adding something like garlic would make a difference.

I have made this recipe for a couple of Valentine's Day dinners at home. I always think it is going to be much harder than it actually is.  It is so easy, and so delicious. We just eat them plain as rolls, and leftovers reheat in a few seconds in the microwave. I need to make them more often since they are so simple and so delicious!

Oh, I don't use margarine. I just use butter and they turn out just fine!

I've made these three times now.  The first was exactly as it was in the recipe.  The puffs were a little small, but very tasty, and they went  like hotcakes.  The second time I added some dried minced garlic to the butter as it was melting, before I added the milk.  Just like little garlic buns, as we made them with a tablespoon scoop (heaped).  The third time we also used garlic, and 2 year old cheddar cheese rather than parmesan.  They didn't puff as much, and the flavour of the cheddar didn't translate as well as the parmesan did.

I made this recipe for a dinner party in which I was to bring appetizers. I wanted to bring a dish that was out of the ordinary but common, quick and easy but appeared like it must have taken all day and I wanted the ingredients to be staples that I already had on hand. This recipe filled the bill! People raved about them and they were gone in a flash. I made another batch the next day for the family, but this time I added chopped green onion and pepperoni. WOW! is all I can say.

I've made these twice now, first time was amazing but the second time I screwed up. Pay attention to the size, I didn't the second time I made them and after 30 minutes in the oven they were still doughy in the middle. 

These are great with a marina sauce but also great alone, I put a garlic wine topping on them after they are done and omg delicious even when they come out wrong lol.

Good flavor, little spicier than I would have thought.  They turned out a bit drier than I wanted, but that could have been avoided if I'd used a marinara to dip them in.

I baked these for 15 minutes, and then an extra 5 or so because they didn't look done.  They ended up sinking after they came out of the oven... The parmesan was good but they turned out way too dense.

Made this last night along with a bunch of other appy's from this site. Was very disappointed with the result. After reading other reviews i doubled the recipe expecting these little puffs to be fantastic. Followed the intructions but added a bit of extra cheese. I found that they have little flavour if any at all. Maybe this would be better with an extra old aged cheddar to give it some umph. Doubt i will making this again.

I am a Parmesan fiend but these puffs just didn't do it for me.  I added garlic powder and used marinara sauce for dipping but they were pretty bland.  I think blending in other cheeses or ingredients might help but they don't really stand alone well.

These puffs turned out more like little lumpy biscuits. They were not puffy at all, maybe I did something wrong.  I did use Fat free milk, but maybe I was supposed to use regular milk. They tasted good, but they did not look like the picture.  I will try this again.

These were very tasty, but I agree with other reviewers, a little salt would've been good. But, they were very good! Getting the drops of dough so small was a little hard, but I'm thinking more experienced cooks with better tools than I have will have no problem!

I did use a mixer to blend the eggs up as some other reviews suggested. I also used wax paper but they still stuck to the wax paper so they didn't have bottoms. They also turned out pretty flat, except for maybe one of them was puffed up. I added some basil, black pepper, and some garlic powder to the mix but I forgot to add the parm cheese!!! So I sprinkled some on top before putting in the oven. That may have been the problem. My husband thought they tasted good though. I had some ranch dressing to dip them in.

My friend and I decided to try to make these together for a girls night in and they were really good. The main complaint I had was that the dough was REALLY thick and we had to take turns mixing it to get it smooth and both of us ended up with sore arms. But the cooked product was worth the effort. Next time I think I will try adding a bit more liquid if it's as thick to try to loosen it up. Thanks!

These were excellent! I quadrupled the recipe for a pot luck party and every last one was devoured!  I've already made them twice in the past month!

Not a fan.  Sounded great but didn't do anything for me or the family. Flattened out as soon as out of the oven.  Also laking something in flavor.  Probably won't attempt again.

Well, I'll definitely try these again, only because I can see the potential and I'm pretty sure I made them much too large for them to work out. They were greasy, but tasted ok.  Though my friends thought they tasted like a big, hot Cheez-It.  We'll see, I'll try again when I have more time to read reviews and do it right.  Bonus though - they whip up quickly.

This puffs are really yummy and light, but not as cheesy as I expected.  I love Italian food, and these puffs dipped in spaghetti sauce make the perfect snack!

Well...the puffs came out LOOKING like puffs, but the inside was somewhat empty with lots of airholes and stuff.  I think it's because I used butter instead of margarine?  I also used extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of parmesan...maybe that was it too?  I'm not sure, but these puffs weren't so puffy.  The insides looked undone and a tiny bit soggy and weird.  Anyway, everyone liked the way the puffs looked and tasted, so I guess it turned out okay.

Wow!  What a great appetizer.  In less than half an hour, they were on our plates and being eaten.  Very simple to make and even the kids (and adults) with the picky appetites loved them.  We will definitely make them again, soon!

I had a go at these for Valentine's Day.  I made them for an d'oeuvre and they weren't puffs but more like "cookies". I think it's b/c I added the flour too quickly to the milk/butter mixture resulting in lots of clumping.  When I added the eggs I tried to de-clump the dough but I don't think it worked too well.  I put in extra parm and also added  pine nuts.  They were good but I could definitely taste the flour clumps.  I will be trying them again b/c of the rave reviews they got!  My hubbie liked them  too, but I want to LOVE them like everyone else! :0)

Next time I'll use 1/5 the milk, some yeast cake and a little sugar, and SMALL eggs.

I thickened it up with extra flour and it still ran flat.  The flavor's pretty good.  Use fresh parmesan and grate it; don't be lazy.  I made a butter and garlic mix to put on it and it turned out ok.  This is a good recipe.  Someone needs to perfect it and post it.

These puffs were okay. They turned out flat, and the parmesan flavor was overwhelming. I'm not sure if I'd make them again; maybe with a few alterations.

This is a great recipe! My boyfriend and I loved them!! I didn't even need the marinara sauce. Got 12 in one batch... I tried freezing a few after they cooled and then defrosting at room temperapute a coulpe days later and they still were great!  I wonder how long they will keep frozen.

They came out a bit dry and not quite what I was hoping for. "puff" describes the way they look rather than the actual consistency.

Recipe sure didn't taste as wonderful as the recipe sounded.  Definitely too bland and needed some major kick.  IF I try this recipe again, I will definitely alter it.
