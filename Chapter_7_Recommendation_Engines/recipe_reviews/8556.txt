I would rate this 5 STARS but my husband did not like it so I'm giving it 4 stars. I LOVED THE FLAVOR and I am a fan of creamy/saucy dishes, and I am a huge Gorgonzola fan! I DID LOVE THIS! I think this is a love it or hate it recipe. I SUGGEST READING the ingredients and if you LOVE GORGONZOLA. mushrooms, cream sauces, etc... you'll love it, if not, this isn't for you. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was really good. Very intense flavor so I would make sure to serve w/very crusty bread and a side dish that's lighter. I used baby portabellas (criminis) and they add a wonderful flavor. I also used homemade pasta. The sauce is not very eye friendly (very off white looking) so next time I will either try adding brocoli asparagus or maybe just parseley to give it some contrasting color. I think serving this w/ a Pinot Noir would do justice.

I am a gorgonzola lover but this was a tad much for me. I made this a second time substituting 1/2 feta for 1/2 the gorgonzola and it was better. Overall very enjoyable.

This is a wonderful recipe. We made it even better adding a few personal favorites. We like to add 1 chopped sundried tomato per serving.5 slices cooked and drained diced bacon per serving and.5 diced shallots per serving.

fantastic flavour - easy to make too. I'm not a big fan of cream sauces in general but I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it. very heavy and filling so I wouldn't eat too much of it but it's sooo good.

I thought this recipe was very good but even better when I used shrimp and scallops instead of the chicken! Don't cook shrimp or scallops too long or else they will become dry and tough. Also add some parsley. A nice bottle of wine and you're good to go!!

I thought this recipe was good. However my husband thought it might be better if the gorgonzola was cut in half and 3 oz of a milder cheese was added.

My store did not have gorgonzola cheese. I had to use feta. It was excellent.

Delicious! I took the suggestion of others and used half feta and half gorgonzola as I was afraid it would be too overwhelming otherwise. Will definitely make this one again.

I wanted something different for my lunch and I had precooked chicken in the freezer. This recipe came up in my search. I basically halved the recipe. I sauteed about half a sweet onion diced in some bacon grease before adding the garlic and one small can of mushroom pieces. I then added the precooked chicken and the fat free half-and-half and let it reduce while the penne was cooking. Then I added the Gorgonzola cheese and just a handful of walnut pieces which I didn't bother toasting. I also added some red pepper flakes and some garlic salt for seasoning. I just ladeled the sauce over the cooked pasta rather than combining. This was good and filling. The color is rather bland and grey which isn't appealing but I'm not sure what can be done about that.

The directions were vauge. I cooked the sauce too hot and it curtled. The flavor was OK. I probably won't make again.

Made this yesterday for a crowd and got rave reviews! I used chick thighs instead of breasts. I would like to try it again perhaps substituting non-fat evaporated milk for a portion of the Half & Half as it is sinfully rich.

This took a lot longer to prepare than I thought it should. Used sliced baby bella as well as regular button mushrooms. Added a smidgen of ground nutmeg as well as some shallots. Also added some butter to the mushrooms and chicken while they were cooking. Overall a hearty meal that I am glad we tried but I doubt I will ever make it again.

I made this for my husband and myself. Being addicted to mushrooms I added a little more than called for and cut back on the garlic because it sounded like a lot. It turns out that in this particular recipe using the full amount would have been fine. The flavor of the gorgonzola helps to balance the garlic flavor. I enjoyed this immensely and my husband says it's a keeper.

This was incredibly bland..my husband said it was "just not exciting". I don't know how you could make it better. It tasted like a bland alfredo and I don't like alfredo so maybe that's why I didn't like it. My husband said it didn't taste like alfredo..that it hardly tasted like anything at all. It's too bad because I love bleu cheese but this was a very big disappointment. Sorry.

so yummy! I don't add walnuts but add some fresh spinach. It is the only "spinach" food they will eat.

I thought this was very good though I think I may have added too much garlic. My husband didn't like it at all but he doesn't like gorgonzola so that would be obvious. It really does whip up a restaurant quality meal and I would recommend it.

This was delicious. I love both garlic and gorgonzola cheese and it was a good combination (although if you're not a big blue cheese fan I would cut back on the cheese as it is quite powerful in this recipe). The leftovers were ok but better to eat this fresh.

I followed some reviewers' suggestions and did about 2/3 feta 1/3 gorgonzola. It was a lovely flavor and everyone in my family was happy with it. I personally am a fan of sharper cheese but I think it will have broader appeal if you do the substitution. I also roasted the nuts with a little salt first; a step I always take in nuts added to pasta. I used heavy cream instead of half and half because that is what I had but I think either way would work. It probably made the sauce a little thicker. Very good!

Very good! lots of flavor! I did 1/2 the amount of chicken and it was plenty. I can see how some fresh parsley may add color to this monochrome dish though. I'd definitely make this again. served with bruschetta and a kale dish.

Good dish...I knew that I had pasta chicken and gorgonzola on hand so this recipe saved me a trip to the grocery store! I added white wine italian seasoning sundried tomatoes and kept the chicken in the pot.

After reading the recipe I made a few changes. First I fried a couple pieces of bacon then removed them and sauted some onion in the fat....this add more flavor. Cut back on the cheese and added some nice white wine at the end. As for the pasta...try adding a tsp of dried Italian seaoning to the water when it is boiling. IT'S Great!!!

Quite disappointed. After seeing a 5 star rating I expected much better. The sauce was too heavy with gorgonzola and the rest of the dish had little to no flavor. Will not be making this again.

This recipe was okay...not the greatest. I used crimini mushrooms which were very flavorable. My husband and I both thought the gorgonzola taste was too strong and we love gorgonzola. I make another recipe with bowtie pasta shallots and lemon zest. Next time I might try combining the two recipes and adding less gorgonzola.

My boyfriend hated it my mom didn't care for it and I thought it was OK. It was way to dry not enough sauce and missing alot of flavor. I would add a can of diced tomatos double the garlic and add a cup of white wine along with the half and half and boil. Needs more flavor.
