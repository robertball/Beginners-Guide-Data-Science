Hey everyone! I'm the person that posted this recipe and I appreciate all the feedback (good and bad) along with what everyone did to make it their own. I read over some of the recommendations, and this is what I did to make this recipe even better. I replaced the water with Pepsi, added about a tsp of liquid smoke, and seasoned the ribs with a rub of salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and brown sugar. Added the onion and garlic as stated in the recipe, and cooked them on high for just under 4 hours and followed the rest of the directions. With these changes, I love the recipe even more (though as many people have stated, it's pretty excellent as written)! I know that many people love them to 'fall off the bone', but good ribs should still have a nice bite and pull when you bite into them. Adjust the cooking time accordingly, but for my slow cooker, they are cooked perfectly between 3.5 and 4 hours. Thanks again for all the feedback!! ~Norah

I was really skeptical about ribs in a slow cooker, so I tried this recipe twice to make sure that the first time wasn't a fluke.  I am a convert, that's for sure.  These were amazing! First time, I made it exactly as the recipe called for and these ribs were fall off the bone good.  The second time, I added smoked paprika and garlic powder to the rub on the ribs before I put them in the slow cooker.  I also used 1/2 cup of beer instead of the water (any liquid will add flavour).  I cooked them on high in the slow cooker for 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I covered a 9 x 11 baking dish with tin foil (to help with clean up) and put the ribs in the uncovered baking dish.  I coated the ribs with bbq sauce and put them in the oven at 350F for 20 minutes.  I pulled the ribs out and added another thin layer of bbq sauce before putting them back in the oven under the broiler for 7 to 10 minutes to get that crust on the top.  The ribs were perfect.  My family thanks you for this recipe which I will be using again and again!  Amanda

Slow cooking makes the difference here.  Instead of finishing in the oven, I basted with sauce and placed them on a medium-heat grill for 15-20 minutes.  Turn every 5 minutes and baste the meaty side 1-2 more times until desired level of caramelization (is that a word?).  Great recipe! We will use it every time we make ribs.

This is an excellent "cheater" recipe for the most part.  Still, it fell from perfection because the cooking time was too long. Hubs and I do far too much rib eating in our travels and one thing we've learned from the experts is that, contrary to popular belief, you don't WANT your ribs to fall off the bone.  If that's the state they end up in they've been cooked too long (or stewed).  We like our ribs tender, yet with the meat still clinging to the bone.  I cooked them just short of 4 hours on high, and if I do this again I'd shorten that by an hour.  The finish in the oven, however, was just right - 15 minutes at 375 degrees resulted in a sticky, caramelized,  glazed exterior.  I didn't bother with either the onion or garlic, but I did season them with a good rub seasoning a few hours before I started them in the Crock Pot.  The bottom line?  In spite of not being smoked or grilled, and in spite of too long a stint in the Crock Pot, these were some "D" fine ribs.

I made these today and they were INCREDIBLE.  I followed the recipe exactly except for one addition.  I marinated the ribs overnight in a mixture of Worchestershire, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, and sea salt.  I served them with loaded baked potatoes, homemade rolls, and salad. Thanks for the fantastic recipe.  I will definitely make my ribs like this from now on!!

Not bad, but the rib meat didn't have much flavor. If I try it again, I think I would marinate the meat overnight, and use a can of beer instead of water, to add more flavor.

The best ribs I ever made! I followed some of the reviews and used coke instead of water.  I slow cooked them for 3.5 hours because I checked and the meat was already falling off the bone and I wanted them intact though soft. From the crockpot it was straight to the broiler and let them brown on both sides then brushed them with a generous amount of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce and browned more. I do not have enough words to express how these turned out but will try - INCREDIBLY OUT OF THIS WORLD and my family were so impressed.   A definite keeper.

These ribs are wonderful! If you use a good BBQ sauce they will have plenty of flavor. They were definitely fall off the bone tender. Because I like to throw mine on the grill (rather than in the oven) the last 10 minutes, I prefer the meat  to be tender but stay on the bone. Next time I'm going to cook on high for 4 hours rather than low for 8 hours to see if that helps them stay together. A great BBQ sauce is Sweet Baby Rays, Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce. My new favorite!

Great!  I love ribs, but its too early to pull out my grill.  I should have marinated, but with working late...well, you all know how that goes.  My changes were a dry rub of garlic, chili powder, salt, red pepper and cumin.  Then into the slow cooker.  We don't drink, so there was no beer around to use as other suggested, so I used ac vinegar, liquid smoke, worchester sauce and water to total 1/2 cup that I poured over the ribs. Cooked the recommended time, topped with bbq sauce and popped into my Flavor Wave Oven for 20 min to get that crispiness.  super yum.  A lot of changes, I know, but that is what makes it fun for me!

Great recipe. Based on other reviews, i modified a bit. seasoned the ribs w/ a pork rub then place on grill for a few minutes on each side to sear (this will help keep some of the juices in). Placed in crockpot on high for 3 hrs and used 1/2 cup of beer instead of water (I've heard coke works great too). Didn't bother w/ the onion and garic. Then finished off in the oven for 10 minutes on each side w/ sauce to caramalize. Very tender and bone came right out when eating. 
P.S. It never mentioned how to put the ribs in the crockpot...After research I placed them on their side (Thicker end down and meaty side facing out). Worked great.

Love the recipe, but just wanted to throw out a little warning...make sure not to overfill the crock pot.  Probably a beginner mistake, but wanted to leave a note for any other beginners.

This was my 2nd time using this recipe.  The first time turned out great, but this time I overdid it and used 6 slabs of ribs when the max for my crock pot probably should be 4.

The ribs tasted great, but some of them had meat falling off the bone while others we had to work for.  Could have been a a coincidence with just a different quality meat (which happens sometime), but I noticed some inconsistency in how the meat was cooking in the crock pot.

Again, probably a "rookie mistake", but just wanted to pass it on for any others that are new to using a crock pot.  Once it gets warm, I'm going back to the grill, but until then, this recipe will get the job done...as long as I stick to the directions!

First off I'd like to say that I have been making all types of ribs all different types of ways for years. I love doing them in my smoker  and my grill using indirect method but I was wanting to learn a quicker way using my crock pot so I tried this recipe and I was pleasantly surprised by just how tasty, quick and easy this is compared to other ways that I do. I never really thought that ribs could actually be done in a crock pot and taste or have the consistency that we are used to. I have a rather large crock pot so I used one cup of water and one cup of apple cider vinegar, then I added some onion and garlic for the ribs to sit on as well as for flavor,then I rubbed the ribs with   salt,black pepper,garlic powder,onion powder,paprika,brown sugar and a little Old Bay. I almost forgot to say I also removed the white membrane from the underside of the ribs before applying the rub. I then set the ribs on top of onion/garlic and topped with more onion and garlic. Cooked on high for 3.75 hours and then put into a baking pan,applied my own bbq sauce and baked for 25 minutes (under the broiler for the last 5 minutes or so) They were "stupid good!" Also crock pots like ovens vary in temperature so use any recipe as a guideline, do not think they are written in stone. Also ribs come in various thicknesses as they are from an animal not created in a lab and have varying degrees of fat and these things will also effect cooking times. Thank you very much for posting!!

Absolutely delicious!!!  This recipe was so easy and I had most of the ingredients in my cabinet.  I made the ribs just as the recipe said, but I added smoked paprika and garlic powder to the rub on the ribs before I put them in the slow cooker.  I also used 1/2 cup of beer as suggested by SUGAR13......my family LOVED THEM!!!!  I will definetly be making this again.

Great rib recipe.  I did make a few modifications based on other review recommendations.  I used coke instead of water, an entire can as I had more than three pounds of ribs to cook. I added about 4 cloves of minced garlic and a huge "dollup" of liquid smoke.
Hubby absolutely loved the ribs and it is now my "go to" recipe for back ribs!

If you cook the ribs in chicken broth, seasoned with salt and garlic in crock pot the meat will be flavorful. I'm giving this a 5 star only with this change.

Awesome ribs! Ended up using the slow cooker for 12 hours as my job is a ridiculously long day. The meat was literally falling off the bone and only two ribs made it out of the cooker with the bone still attached. Used sweet barbeque sauce to coat the rips. After baking the ribs for 15 minutes, the other rib meat fell off the bone. Will definitely be making this again.

I've made ribs this way a few times. Maybe it's my slow cooker but I've found it takes less time than the original recipe calls for, I guess you need to know your equipment. As soon as the ends of the bones begin to stick out from the meat, I know they're done. Any more and they'll totally fall apart. Finish them off in the oven OR on the grill (low heat) and you'll have delicious, falling-off-the-bone ribs every time. Try a spice rub first, experiment with different BBQ sauces until you get it to your liking.

Had this in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours.  Instead of water I used beer. I used a dry rub of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried mustard.  I wanted to add brown sugar but didn't have any.  It still turned out wonderful.  It was falling off the bone.

I have made these slow cooker ribs 4 times now and they are a HIT with a picky 16 year-old who now requests them every week! I season them with garlic powder and a touch of ground cinnamon (not too much) in addition to the salt and pepper. I have some good tips for coating the ribs with the barbecue sauce before putting them into the oven. I place about half the bottle of barbecue sauce in an oblong, plastic bowl and thin out the sauce with about 1/4 cup of water---not too runny, though (use a little bit of water at a time). Using tongs, I then place one portion of ribs into the sauce bowl to coat them with sauce one portion at a time (I always cut my rack of ribs into 2 or 3 rib portions before seasoning and cooking them in the crock pot). Using the tongs, I carefully slide each portion around the sauce bowl and a spoon to baste hard to reach areas with sauce to make sure it is very well coated. I then place the portion onto a foil-lined baking pan (makes for easier clean up). They always come out great! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe. :)

These were fall-off-the-bone amazing. My 13-year-old son told me that this is the best dinner I've ever made.  I served the ribs with baked potatoes, green beans and honey cornbread.  Yum! This is the only way I will make ribs from now on.

My only suggestion is don't use water, it gives no taste whatsoever. Add beer, or low or no sodium broth. Beef, chicken and even vegetable broth works well and adds lots of flavor. I have even used coke and Dr. Pepper. And sear you meat.

So easy to make.  Cooked them on low for about 6-7 hours and went to high for about an hour.  Put sliced lemon in the slow cooker along with the sliced onion.  Finished in the over as written and these were awesome.  Thanks for sharing!

These are the best ribs I've ever made and I will continue to make them this way, but with a few minor changes.  I made a Memphis rub and let the ribs marinate overnight, slow cooked on high for 4 hours, then baked them at 350 for 15 minutes, baste with the leftover barbecue sauce and then broil for 10 minutes.  These ribs are so tender and finger licking good.

These are soooo easy to make and come out so ''tender''... I didn't have minced garlic, just sprinkled garlic powder over the ribs with some Salt & Pepper & cooked for 8 hours...they came out great.. I'll be making these again soon.. I used to boil ribs first, now no need.. Easy!!

The ribs were sooo good!  Cooked exactly as written, just added 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar to the water, and a few dashes of liquid smoke.  Everyone loved these.

Very good.  When they were finished tenderizing in slow cooker, I drained off the liquid and covered in bbq sauce and kept on low for 1 1/2 hours or so, wasn't really paying attention.  Added more sauce and serve about 30 mins later.  They were awesome.  No need to bake in oven or broil.  This way didnt heat up the kitchen with the oven and broiler.  My new way to cook ribs!!

I have never submitted a review for a recipe on this site - and I have prepared several recipes for my family from allrecipes.com.  These ribs were soooo easy and soooo good that I felt compelled to submit a review.  I prepared them exactly as outlined in the recipe and they were delish!!! This is a keeper and I will be making this for my family on a regular basis.  Next time around I may try substituting beer for the water to add some variation.  Other than that - this recipe is fantastic as written!  Thanks norah for a fast and easy dinner that is also yummy ;)

Put ribs in crock pot on low for 7 hrs..... Unfortunatly , when I tried to take them out to put in oven........meat fell off the bone . Pulled pork sandwhich was good , but not what the crowd was waiting for !
Maybe 4 hrs on high is the way to go.

Amazing! I cooked on low for 8 hours. Meat falls off the bone. It was falling off the bone when I attempted to transfer it to a baking sheet. Wonderful. I followed a few reviewers tweaks. I marinated the ribs overnite in a blend of personal preference flavors. I used a bottle of Fat Tire Beer instead of water. I added another layer of BBQ sauce and put them back in the oven on broil for 5 mins to get that crust. Wow! just Wow!

I liked it very much and received many compliments.  I have to admit I did change it a bit.  I rubbed the ribs with my favorite bbq seasoning and poured some honey bbq sauce over them in the crock.  When they were cooked, I let them cool enough to handle, slathered BBQ sauce all over them and put them on the grill long enough to caramelize because it was hot and I didn't want to turn the oven on.

I think this is a great recipe to make your own! The combination of slow cooker plus finishing it in the oven is the key. This is a very simple recipe with a lot of room for modifications. I made it exactly as written above and they came out so yummy and tender! Since then I've marinated them overnight(recommended), played with liquid smoke, switched up BBQ sauces, concoted new spice rubs etc....

All in all, use the ingredients you like and follow the cooking instructions and you'll be the rib king/ queen!

Great base-I followed it, but instead of water, just poured a can of beer over. Cooked on high, then on low b/c I wasn't ready to eat yet. By the time I was, too  hungry to put in oven, but they were great-some of the best I've ever had and so simple. Fell off the bone and fantabulous! I don't even like ribs!

I thought that the ribs were excellent. Followed the recipe as is, except that along with the salt/pepper called for in the recipe, I added brown sugar, onion powder and garlic powder (to taste) to the rub.  Poured Diet Coke into the slow cooker instead of water and cooked on high for exactly 4 hrs.  Conducting a little taste test, I coated half of the ribs with Sweet Billy Ray's BBQ sauce and the other ribs with Safeway store brand BBQ sauce and baked for 20 minutes.  Safeway won! The meat was tender, succulent and melted in my mouth without senselessly falling off the bone when being handled. After all, the fun in eating ribs is taking the meat off the bone with your MOUTH!

I made these and my husband loved them .  I didnt change a thing in the recipe.  And for us it was a plus the meat just falls off the bone made it much easier for my 1 yr old grandson the eat the rib meat and me to remove the bone beforehand. This is how they are going to me from now on.

I left them in the crockpot too long (11 hours on low) and they were fall-off-the-bone ribs but they were delish! Baked them at 350 for 20 minutes, then broiled on low for 8 minutes. Rubbed with onion powder, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic. Added soy, smoke to water.

I made this recipe the other night for my husband who LOVES RIBS and is very picky when it comes to them. He loved them!! I followed the updated recipe in terms of doing a dry rub and using Pepsi in place of water. This  recipe is fool proof. Thanks so much for sharing!! I will definitely make these again.

It was ok the first time, but improved on it with the following mods:

I used chicken broth instead of water.
I rubbed a combination of maple bacon and pork seasonings, and let everything cook on low for about 10 to 12 hours (low and slow is the secret folks).
Finished everything off everything with a generous coating of Bullseye BBQ sauce under the broiler for 2 - 3 minutes just to bake the sauce on to the meat.

The result was finger-licken' good ribs with the meat falling clean off the bone.

I loved these ribs so tender and flavorful they were pretty well falling off the bone. An idea to think about I bought my baby back ribs at my local butcher that already had a dry rub on it the seasoning on it was perfect along with the BBQ sauce. We have a rib fest every summer where I live in Canada, my husband said they were better than at the rib fest. It was so easy to prepare too. Nothing to it with some potatoes and a veggie it was a perfect meal!!!!!

Made this on Saturday night. Rubbed the ribs down with a BBQ dry rub just because I had some on hand the night before. After that followed recipe except put ribs on grill for final cooking and they were tremendous. I have always had such a hard making ribs for some reason, but thought I would give it one more shot and glad I did. A keeper and the only way I will make ribs from now on. Used Sweet Baby Rays sauce. Terrific.

I tried the original recipe and added a tablespoon of liquid smoke and used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce. The liquid smoke gave it  the flavor of being grilled and they were great! Thanks for the easy recipe without the grilling mess.

For me, I like to start off with a dry rub of salt,  course ground pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, crushed red peppers or paprika, and brown suger. (You can forego the salt if you use garlic salt or onion salt)

Instead of plain ole water use a Coke, Dr. Pepper, Beer, or broth. (I love Dr. Pepper so I use that)

Cut the rib racks into slabs of 5 to 6 ribs each. Cover the ribs generously with the dry rub and layer them with the onions and minced garlic into the slow cooker.

Follow the cooking directions in the recipe. (4 hours on high or 8 hours on low)

I prefer to finish the ribs on the grill instead of in the oven. It gives the ribs a good char.

Made two racks of these baby back ribs last night (photo attached). Amazing! I followed the origional posters updated recipe (she added in the comments) and was blown away by how good these turned out. I added Stubs BBQ rub and also chose to cover them in the Stubbs BBQ sauce. Two racks were a tight fit but they came out perfect. I was hoping to have some left overs but me and two friends devoured both of the racks in one sitting, that's how good these are. Thanks for the awesome recipe and the food coma =)

Wish I could give this 10 stars!!Thank you, Norah! These ribs were incredible, I added the Coke and liquid smoke to the pot, and rubbed with lawrys season salt, garlic salt, onion powder, paprika and black pepper. Rubbed them with the seasonings the night before and cut them up.  They were ready to drop into the pot in the morning before work.  Placed them in the crock added the coke and smoke and turned on LOW. When we got home, we heated up the grill, brushed em with some Masterpiece and carmelized them up on the grill.  AH-MAZING!!

Yum yum! Only change I made was I used a pork rub mix on the ribs before cooking them in the slow cooker. Did 8 hours on low and so happy with the results :)

After reading some reviews and then the original posters tweeks to the recipe, I made it basically the way she did after altering the recipe with a only minor exceptions:  I rubbed the ribs with a combination of salt, pepper, and garlic.  I didn't have onion powder on hand.  I let that sit overnight and then cooked it in a 1/2c water and about a tbsp of liquid smoke with slices of onion.  I cooked on high for 3 3/4hrs, took out and placed in baking pan then lathered in bbq sauce (I used Jack Daniels Hickory brown sugar).  I baked at 350 for 15 min.  I poured more bbq sauce on and cooked about another 5 minutes.  My son loves ribs and he thought these were very good.  I'm not crazy about ribs, especially the hours it takes to grill or smoke so for me this was easy and they were very tasty.

I have been a slave to ribs for 20 years.  This recipe has given me a new lease on my cooking life.  I followed the advice on here and did a spice rub on the ribs before tossing them into the slow cooker with a beer, onions and garlic.  Literally fall off the bone tenderness with great flavour.  If you like ribs and also like having free time, try this recipe.

Holy cow!  This was awesome!  Who knew ribs could be so tender and taste this good without messing around with the grill!   I read the reviews and decided to just follow the recipe as written and the whole family loved them!  This is my new way to cook baby back ribs!!

Very good with modifications based on other reviewers...thank you! I prepared 2 very meaty slabs from the night before, salt and peppering them, and marinating them in a little dijon mustard, garlic powder, and olive oil before cooking them in the slow cooker the next day on low for 10 hours. I had a hard time taking them out of the slow cooker because the meat was falling off the bones. Then I foiled a cookie sheet and loaded the fallen slabs of meat with BBQ sauce - use your favorite - and baked for 15 minutes at 400C then 10 mins for 475C ---my broil doesn't work! Delicious!

I skip the garlic and onion and use McCormack Pork Rub.  The ribs when done in the slow cooker are so much less fatty and fall off the bone good!

I've made this recipe exactly as the instructions dictate 15-20 times and every time the ribs come out incredible.  Perfectly tender, easy to pull from the bone without being overly soft.  Just enough bite.  Incredible flavor.  Because of this recipe, people now rave over my ribs.

The basic idea is not bad....but, not enough herbs and spices! And to discard the onions and garlic is a real sin!!! Should be put through a sieve and added to sauce.

Doesn't get much simpler than this - great, easy dish!  I took the advice of others - cooked on high for 3 hr 45 min, then placed in uncovered baking dish in a 350 oven for 20 min; finished off broiling for 10 minutes.  They look nice & crispy, but meat is still intact and juicy.  Used a can of coke in place of water.  Wouldn't say this is a "knock your socks off" recipe - but very good mid-week family meal!

I have been a vegetarian for 18 years but my boyfriend is full fledged carnivore. Ribs were on special at the store so he bought a bunch but he did not have time to cook them. I thought this would be the easiest and I would not have to taste to see if they were eatable. They were fall off the bone tender (I went to turn them and saw so), he loooooved them. So easy and made my man incredibly happy. The smell drove our dogs nuts for a while, every time either of us came into the kitchen they would follow and salivate until they got a little treat. So simple and perfect.

I am NOT a cook at all.   This was simple and came out GREAT. I did use beer instead of water.  I will make again.  For you non cooks out there don't be surprised at the amount of sauce you use at the end ( I was, but it worked out ).  Also do not be afraid to use more meat , I just used more of the other ingredients and DID NOT add time ( like I said, I don't cook so I did not know if I needed to or not). Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I made these per the recipe, and offer these suggestions. First, 8 hrs on low was far too long, at least for my crock pot. 6-6.5 would have been better. I struggled to get them out of the crock pot in one piece at 7.5. Definitely the first time I've had to eat ribs with a fork.  Second, season them in the crock before you cook. Even after simmering in garlic and onion, the meat didn't have much flavor. And third, baste both sides of the ribs with sauce, even though you only caramelize them on one side. You'll appreciate having the sauce flavor in every bite.

I lived in TX, I know BBQ.  This recipe rocks.  I tripled the onions and garlic and laid them on each layer of ribs  in crock pot, high, 4.5 hours using chicken broth instead of water (I used 2 racks of BBR).  Then as recipe says, I broiled them watching carefully to crisp them up.  I removed them added Sweet Baby Rays, and broiled again.  TO DIE FOR, even the next day.

Absolute deliciousness  !!!!!!!!!! 
If your looking for a great rib recipe this is it....
  I used onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, ground mustard, and a smoked paprika  (or cayenne pepper if you want them a lil spicy), 1/2 cup of beer, and cooked on high for 3-3 1/2 hours. I do the oven to 375° and put bbq sauce on them and place them in oven for 15-20 minutes. 
   My family 100% love these. Thank you so much for posting such a wonderful, delicious,  and easy rib recipe. 
   Sincerely, 
 The Esquivel Family

Cooked on low for 8 hrs. Meat just fell off the rib bone. I had plan to grill it but ended up baking it because the meat won't survive the flipping on the grill. I'll try to cook it for less time and see if the meat will hold up. All in all this is a great way to tenderize, just experiment on how long to leave in slow cooker depending on how you want to finish off the cooking.

Great tasting ribs but way too long in the slow cooker. I could not do the oven step because the meat just fell off the bones, leaving the bones in the slow cooker.

Made these tonight.  Based on the reviews, added half a can of coke instead of the water. That was the only change. My husband and I loved the meal and we will definitely have again.  Yum!

I made these last night according to recipe. I added a few shakes of liquid smoke into seasoning and made a dry rub. Crockpot for 3 1/2 hours. Baked in oven for 10 min, turned and another 10 min, then did as another reviewer suggested and broiled for about 5 minutes. These ribs are amazing!!! Would make them again in a heartbeat!  This is my new go - to recipe. I used Stubb's sticky sweet bbq sauce.

I have made ribs in the slow cooker before.  These ribs were AMAZING!!! Cooked on low for 6 hours.  Used Sweet Baby Jane's BBQ sauce. Meaty was flavorful.  So tender it just fell off the bones.

This was such a great recipe and so simple, who knew that the ribs would come out like restaurant quality. I've tried making ribs before in the oven but they never seem to come out as tender as this. I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and seasoned the ribs over night. I used a BBQ spice blend and a few other seasoning's (garlic powder, salt, Dijon mustard and paprika) and I am so glad that did, it really bumped up the flavour factor. The ribs do not need any longer then 3.5 to 4 hrs for cooking, they were delicious and I can't wait to make this again for more people, if you want to impress someone I suggest you give these a try.

I just made ribs In The slow cooker yesterday for the first time, then this recipe came this morning, next time I will add the onion and garlic, but instead of beer I'm going to try Bourbon.  Several years ago I made marinated steak with a soy sauce/ bourbon marinade and it was amazing.

I just tried cooking this recipe today. I had some ribs and could not figure out what to do with them that was easy. I came across this recipe and found out how easy this was to make. I added a few extra seasonings to the ribs to create almost like a rub. I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and a hint of brown sugar before I put it in the oven and then I carmelized the sauce on the ribs. AMAMZING!!!!!

This recipe is awesome.  You can season your ribs with any type of dry rub.  Great to come home after work and have ribs cooked.  Just throw them in the oven to caramelize the BBQ sauce and they are excellent.  Will be making these again.

5 stars for the cooking method, but I altered the flavor a bit because these sounded a little boring. If you like fall-of-the-bone ribs, you will love these. I cooked mine on low for 8 hours, swapped salt and pepper for blackened redfish seasoning, and swapped water for chicken broth and liquid smoke. I put my onion in closer to the end with carrots so that we didn't have to throw them away. I used a honey bbq sauce which was perfect.

Can I just say, "yummy".  This recipe is so easy and the aroma's make your mouth water.  Even our picky 3 year old loved the ribs.  The meat is extremely tender and falls off the bone easily.  I did add 1/2 cup of spicy mustard to my BBQ sauce.  Will definitely make again!..................Sherri

I basically followed the contributor's updated recipe trying to use things I already had at home because I was in a hurry to get the ribs into the slow cooker. No Pepsi but a small can of Coke worked. I rubbed them with salt, pepper, some chili powder and brown sugar. Cut the whole rack in three sections and overlaid them in the slow cooker, putting the onion and garlic on top. They cooked on low for about 7 hours. I removed the ribs to a foil-covered baking sheet, slathered them with BBQ sauce and baked for 15 minutes. They were fall-off-the-bone delicious! This will definitely be my go-to recipe when it's too cold to grill outside.

Awesome recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I eliminated the 1/2 cup water, and used 1/2 pineapple juice instead.  I marinated the ribs overnight in a giant ziplock bag with pineapple juice, garlic, and onions.

Then, I skipped adding the BBQ sauce, and instead just put the ribs in the oven for 10 minutes, then just dipped a few ribs in BBQ sauce while I ate them.  But they were great without the BBQ sauce too.

Real BBQ, as you'd get in a well-established rib joint in Memphis, are served without sauce.  Then they put a big selection of BBQ sauces on the table.  After all, BBQ is a style of cooking, it's not the sauce.

I ran home at lunch and started the crock pot and then ran back to work.  I accidentally added the barbecue sauce to the crock pot instead of waiting to transfer to oven.    Is that going  to ruin the  dinner?

I’ve never had better ribs, these suckers are fall off the bone good. Pay attention to OP’s updates in the rating section, she updated the recipe and made it even better. I used Dr. Pepper instead of Pepsi but regardless, this one is a winner. So easy in the crockpot as well, turn it up and walk away. Also! Don’t skip out on the liquid smoke. It adds that BBQ flavour you crave.

This was the first slow cooker recipe I tried and it was great! I really didnt know what I was doing and I left the ribs in for too long and they were hard to pull out without them falling apart, but they still tasted amazing. I used 1/2 cup of beer and about 3 cloves of garlic with the onions.  Messy to eat cause i cooked too long (which my boyfriend and I don't care about) and so yummy!

I just made this for my boyfriend and I, as he requested ribs for dinner. I wanted something I could put in the slow cooker and forget about it.  And were we surprised.  What an easy recipe and sooo tasty!  Definitely making these again!

I was sort of skeptic about these at first.   I said to myself "Ribs in a crockpot?  I don't know how this will turn out."   Well, it's a Monday night and I spent all day prepping these.   The last step was cake.   I bit into the first rib and my tastebuds started screaming with joy!  I will definitely be making these again!

Tasty and easy, uses beef broth instead of water and used a grill instead of a oven to sear in the sauce.

I love ribs - one of my all time go to faves, but hate the prices in a restaurant. I learned how to slow roast them in the oven, which is good, but sometimes too warm in always sunny So Cal. I bought a fixer-upper a few years ago. The kitchen was original circa 1955 and nothing worked, but one single induction burner on the cook top. So I've relied on my slow cooker quite a bit as I've refurbished my home. I was shocked and so excited to find this recipe. 
I made it exactly as stated and the ribs came out perfectly - I finished them on my outdoor grill - some BBQ sauce and a nice flame - WOW!!
Even after a fully working kitchen, my go to cook method for ribs is my trusty crock pot.

I would cook this on high the next time or leave the ribs on low another hour.  Eight hour was not enough on low.  Flavor good.

Made these the other night and they were amazing. Fall off the bone good. I did use beer instead of water as others suggested. Next time I think I might reduce slow cooker time a bit, and put under the broiler after putting the sauce on.
I don't know why you would discard the onions though. I put them in the oven with the ribs and they were delicious.

I tried cooking ribs completely with an oven before and it turned out tough and I had to watch it frequently.

The slow cooker was a easier unattended process and the meat in the end was fall off the bone tender.

A brief trip at the end in the oven to caramelize the BBQ sauce  and it turned out great.

Made this looking for an easy work day/school day /practice day meal. The family was pretty shocked at how good it was because we are pretty big fans of  bbq'd ribs. This is definitely a keeper. We prepared two racks of ribs (with seasonings, two cap fulls of apple cider vinegar, beer and a couple drops of liquid smoke ) in the crockpot and left overnight in the fridge. Cooked them all day on low. When we went to take them out, the meat did fall off the bones, but we broiled it in the BBQ sauce until a nice crust formed (about 15 minutes). Delicious.  One son commented on how quiet dinner was because we were all chowing down on the ribs!  Thanks for the recipe :)

I really enjoyed the ribs but I found that you can get rid of the bland boiled meat flavour if you add the barbeque sauce at the beginning when you put the ribs in the slow cooker. But make sure not to use the full bottle at first, so you still have some sauce left to put on top of the ribs before you put them on a baking sheet and in the oven. This allows you to skip the step of marinating the ribs overnight.
Also, note that the longer you cook the ribs in the oven, the more dried out they will get. I found that 15 min in the oven was a little too long, but this was easily fixed by just putting the ribs back in the hot slow cooker (with all the liquid still in it) for another 5-10 min to make the meat more tender again.
Also, for those of you who are unsure about cooking the meat from frozen, don't worry about it. I had no problems and I used ribs that were straight from the freezer.
Great base recipe but needs a little tweak. Thanks!

Perfect, I did 2 slabs, sliced them in half, seasoned with "Webers" Chicago Steak Seasoning"...yes, it is for more than just steak..., layered them in  the crockpot with about a cup of water, added another 1/2 cup of water  about 4 hours into cooking.  Cooked on low for 8 hours, then into the oven covered with BBQ sauce,  about 20 min, meat fell off the bone!

I didn't fully read the cooking instructions...I piled in the un-seasoned ribs, the cut up onion,  the garlic, the water and 18oz of barbecue sauce All at one time!!! I cooked it on low for 9 hours. I did add more bbq sauce before the oven. The taste tests were fantastic, though.  Though the meat fell off the bone it is still tougher then I expected.  The taste is okay but the lack of pre-seasoning / marinating is obvious.

I made ribs in the slow cooker,  then either grill, or broil. My family won't eat this any other way.

Since the first time I tried this recipe it has been the ONLY way I'll cook ribs!  Perfect every time and I make it exactly like this no changes or substitutions needed.

These ribs turned out very tender and were falling off the bone when I was transferring to the oven.  I only had a 2-lb rack and cooked for 4 hours on high.  They were not dry at all and still tasted great the next day.

This turned out so yummy!  I used chicken bone broth instead of water because I had some open that I didn't want to go to waste.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to the T and it was perfect!  This will be my go to for baby backs!

These were absolutely delicious.  So easy.  I seasoned them with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I did cook them in the crock pot with a bottle of beer, instead of water.  My bbq mixture, consisted of, bbq sauce, honey and DaiDay duck sauce.  They were finger licking good!

I was skeptical at first. Now this has become my go to receive. The only thing is depending on the thickness of your ribs, you may want to reduce the time in the slow cooker, and increase the time in the oven. This will prevent the ribs from getting soggy.

I loved how the ribs came out. The meat just fell off the bone and was so tender and tasty. Yes, I will make it again soon. The only change I made was that I did not use all that bbq sauce. It seemed a bit much. So I just covered all the ribs with sauce and then place in oven. I did not need the whole bottle . Actually I probably had a little over 2 lbs, not 3. I am always so proud of myself when the recipe turns out do well. Thank you AllRecipes.

Wow. These were amazing! Who knew that a little bit of onion, salt, and pepper could do such wonders. I left these in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low, then finished them off on the grill instead of in the oven. Not sure if this made any difference, but I'll be sticking with this recipe all summer. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce which is definitely on the cheap end of the sauce spectrum. Might try doing a dry rub after taking them out of the cooker next time.

Rubbed 2 slabs of ribs with 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/8 tsp pepper, sprinkle of salt, 1/2 tsp of onion powder and garlic powder.  B est to give it time to marinate a few hours or  overnight, but it will be okay if you don't have time.

Sliced one onion and layered it and sprinkled minced clove of garlic over each piece.

Used one can of coke rather than water, like suggested and added a tablespoon of liquid smoke.   I put this in the bottom of the slow cooker and then put the rubbed ribs in it.

I have cooked it high for 4 hours and low for 8 hours - both turned out tasty.   If you want the bones still on,  don't cook it too long.  It doesn't effect the taste or tenderness, but if you cook too long, it will fall off the bones.  Some people like like it like that,but I prefer to have the bones on.

Baking it with barbeque sauce adds that final touch. of yumminess.

I used to boil, then bake, then barbeque the ribs and that was a tedious, time consuming and messy process.  This is a much simpler and equally great tasting batch of ribs.

I've made this a couple of times now and it's by far the easiest way I've found to get wonderfully tender, great tasting ribs. I rated it a 4 simply because I made some modifications. I used a BBQ rub before putting the ribs in the crockpot and use root beer instead of water. I usually use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce... Don't overcook the ribs or you'll have trouble transferring them to a cookie sheet to put them in the oven for the final step... the meat will literally fall off of the bones!

It was fantastic! I didn't have baby back, so I used a slab of standard pork ribs pre cut.  I rubbed onion powder, minced garlic (1 tbsp), garlic powder and salt and pepper into them, and I poured a can of ginger ale into it. They went on high for 6 hours, and we're almost falling off the bone. Then they went in the oven as per directions. Amazing!!

Love cooking in crock pot but never done rids, Always done on grill.  I thought cook time was to long  and not enough flavor, so i made them again. I marinaded them in a rib rub overnight and used half cup chicken broth instead of water, cooked for 6 1/2 hours on low then 375 in oven for 20 min.. Yummy..

Made this for Sunday dinner today! I did alter it by adding 1/2 cup of budweiser and 1 cup of coke. Season as you wish, add 1/2 bottle of your BBQ sauce and cooked on slow cooker for 7 hours! I then basted with BBQ sauce and added to oven on 400 degress for 15 minutes. They were falling off the bone as it is but they were finger licking good and I'm not a fan of ribs. Will definitely make again! My family loved it! Tks for the recipe.

As a condo-dweller - grilling out is a huge pain, so this recipe appealled to me. Also - cooking ribs always intimidated me.  Wow! the ribs turned out great!  Moist, tender, flavorful and perfect.  I also used coke as a substitute for water and rubbed the ribs with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder before cooking.  Finished them with some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and they were perfection!

6/2015 This recipe is so super awesome. Super skeptical about how simple it is but thats its best quality after how DELICIOUS it is. Only change, beef broth rather than h2o. I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce! We've made this twice now and its always, GREAT.  11/18/15
Hi again! Made a few changes over the past few months :) Started seasoning the ribs with more than just salt and pep. Added some chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika to the rub. Also, a little bby sauce in the slow cooker never hurts. One time I accidentally poured all the bby sauce in the crock pot...but no matter! Still turned out super delishhhh! Love it.

My barbeque sauce isn't great but i tasted the pork ribs without the sauce and it was awesome. I just double the amount of ingredients(before baking).

Let me just say the hubby doesn't like ribs and DOES love these. This is a huge hit with my family. I tried using a hard cider with the ribs instead of water and didn't like the taste it added. I"m going to try the marinade next time I make them. They do fall off the bone, I love that. Yum. Awesome and easy!!

I have to add my two cents to everyone else's review - EXCELLENT!!! After reading just about every review I decided to take the plunge (I am not known for ribs. HAHA)
I took some others' suggestions and marinated the ribs in red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce (just mix to taste), then rubbed the ribs with smoked paprika and garlic powder before putting them in the slow cooker. 
I also chose High (4 hours), as others suggested, and they cooked up PERFECTLY - very tender, but stayed intact until we bit into them. I think the 8 hours would have made them fall apart.
Another suggestion I took was to use 1/2 cup of beer instead of water. It was delicious, but I think I'll use beef broth next time. The hint of beer was fine - just not my thing. You may love that touch, so don't be afraid to try it.
I have never been able to make ribs before, but this is now my "go-to" recipe!!!!

I used this recipe and the ribs turned out great. I did however add a half can of beer and 1 tsp of liquid smoke.

I just made these ribs with a little spin off. Instead of water in the crockpot, I used a REDDS Apple Ale. These were my first ever attempt at making ribs and I will definitely make these again.

It ws super easy and tasted good.  I followed the suggestions from the original posters follow up.   I made a rub out of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and rubbed it all into the front and back of the ribs.  I didn't have coke so I used Dr Pepper for my liquid with an onion cubed in it.  I cooked them for 4 hours on high.  Took them out and covered them with BBQ sauce and baked for 20 mins at 375.  Then I threw the broiler on for a few mins to sear the BBQ a little.  We both enjoyed them and think in the summer it would be great to finish them off on the grill.  Thanks to the optional poster, appreciate it!

Great concept but need more spices during the cooking process. Just adding sauce at the end is not enough. Definitely going to try this again though.

We absolutely loved these ribs! They are the next best to being cooked in the smoker. We smoke ribs all summer and fall.  I followed the directions exactly using norah's updates along with my own Northwood's rub for ribs. They were fall off the bone moist and delicious! Next time I'll take them out of the slow cooker around 2 1/2 - 3 hours and then into the oven for another hour on low heat with the barbeque sauce. I want the meat moist but also want the meat to tug off the bone clean. We'll definitely be having these again throughout the below zero winter months.  Thanks for the recipe norah!

Super easy and delcious!  My teen boys love these and there are no leftovers.  Great if it's sub zero temperatures outside (as it is now) and you just don't want to get outside to the grill and don't have time to cook in the oven.  Put it in the slow cooker and forget about it.  Finish it up when you get home.  No brainer!!!

Excellent recipe.  I let my ribs sit in the refrigerator overnight in a dry rib rub. I also substituted a 12 ounce bottle of backs beer for water.  Depending on your slow cooker, eight hours of low cooking may be too long.  6 1/2 hours on low was ample cooking time for me.  The last step of caramelizing the barbecue sauce in the oven should not be skipped. It is amazing to have a slightly crusty exterior with a tender rib.  This recipe is a keeper.

First time I tried, I grilled on bbq after slow cooker-were great but little blackened from leaving over direct heat and too long.  Second time I tried, dementia kicked in and all I could remember was putting them in the slow cooker and adding bbq sauce-nothing else.  Did not grill or bake.  They were fall off the bone good.  My guess is you would have to go out of your way to screw it up.

Just ok for us...these are a little more greasy than those done on the grill.  Definitely marinate the ribs in a dry rub for 24 hours prior to cooking - that's a must if possible!  They are pretty bland as written (I used onion powder, garlic powder, regular paprika, salt and pepper rub per the reviews prior to cooking but did not let them marinate... also used the beer in place of the water and added a tbsp of liquid smoke which really didn't seem to make a difference...no smoky taste really.)  I think if I made these again, I would finish them off on the grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

Rubbed ribs with salt, pepper, paprika, brown sugar and a pinch of garam masala; also added ginger ale to the crock pot - I didn't have beer or Pepsi and I figured it was worth a shot! The crock pot and oven method was easy and the ribs turned out perfectly, thanks for sharing Norah!!!

Fall off the bone, fantastic! My dad loved them despite being a smoker (person who smokes meat the "right way"). I did it exactly as written twice then took a more adventurous route by subbing water for beer. I like the way beer cooks so to me it improved on perfection. BBQ sauced used for all trials was Kraft Honey BBQ (apparently it is the #1 best selling BBQ sauce (do not quote me on that))!

This recipe is AMAZING!!! after about an hour in the crockpot, my house smelt like heaven! So good! After about 3.5 hours, I took em out & stuck em in the oven for about 15-20 minutes & marinated them with sweet baby rays honey BBQ--we actually bought ours already marinated in BBQ & it still tasted amazing!! I love my ribs that fall off the bone,  I know some people like it more tough..but personally it tastes better when it falls off & melts in your mouth!!! I can't wait to make this again... super easy & fast for when you get off work! (I'm off at 3) :)

My husband loves these. Although I make my own version. I rub with paprika and roasted garlic salt. I put bbq sauce on them just before I put them in the oven. Turns out wonderfully.

This is my first go at Ribs. They turned out very tasty! I made modifications by what the original author had updated in the comments with (cola instead of water and I used a whole 20oz, rub with s/p/garlic power/onion powder/brown sugar.) However, maybe mine were too thick or my crock is weird because the 4hrs on high still left some of the meat pink. I even did extra time in the oven at the end as well as it took my BBQ sauce a little bit to get crispy. So next time I will pay more attention before pulling them from the crock to be sure they are cooked through. Definitely a keeper of a recipe though!

Absolutely amazing!  I used 1 cup of an IPA brew instead of water, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 onion, and a "sweet heat" barbecue sauce. I also rubbed the ribs with Lawry's Seasoned Salt (an all-around awesome seasoning for any type of meat/fish. My boyfriend said it was the best ribs he's ever had- 
I agreed! This recipe is a keeper!!!

Cooked these and they were great. Only thing we changed was using beer instead of water to add more flavor. Slow cooking made the rib meat super tender! Delicious!

I will try cooking on low next time for 8 hours. High heat just didn't make it as tender as it should have been. Popping them into the oven did add a good amount of flavor.

I followed a few of the other "twists" to this recipe and, with a brown sugar/fresh cracked pepper/garlic powder and Johnny's Seasoning Salt (it is my go-to seasoning...from the Pacific NW) leaving it to absorb all of these spices overnight then into the crockpot they went.  I used the original recipe creator's suggestion of Pepsi instead of water, added some chopped onions, minced garlic and let them go for 4 hours on HIGH...think that is key, as well.  When I removed them they were still very well intact, just ready to fall off the bone, so draining the liquid and finishing with Sweet Baby Rays with a few dashes of Liquid Smoke in the oven at 350 for an hour, uncovered produced a HEAVENLY, tender rib!  Thank you, Norah, for a lovely recipe, and for being so forgiving to those of us that have tweaked it a bit.

Made this twice and my husband cant wait for the next bbq! Lol. I did twice the meat and water, and doubled the time in the 9ven to make them extra gooey and sticky! I served with corn on cob cooked with baby red potatoes and a stick of butter, and baked beans. Im hooked!

Salt, pepper and crushed garlic is what I put on my meat the night before I received this recipe. I didn't have any beer so I added beef bouillon to some water and slow cooked the meat for 4-5 hrs. Placed BBQ sauce on meat and placed on the barbecue. Yuuummmmmy! So good. Amazingly simple! A home run for sure. This will be a great recipe for company.

I have made this recipe a few times and find it to be easy and yummy.  I did substitute beer for the water and rubbed it with smoked paprika and garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper listed in the original recipe. I did refrigerate it for a few hours or, when time permitted, overnight.  No need for a grill but I suppose you could finish it there instead of the oven. Either way, it was delish.

This is a good recipe.  If you want your ribs faster, you can cut the ribs into 2 or 3 rib sections.  Add salt, pepper, onion etc. to each section and wrap individually in foil.  Place the pieces, seam side up, in a roasting pan (doesn't matter if you stack them on top of each other) and bake at 275 degrees for 2-3 hours.  Then remove them and continue with this recipe in the oven, basting with bbq sauce.

YUMMERS!!!  I made this on Memorial Day, right after having ribs the night before at a BBQ, and these were so moist and delicious. I used a half of a red onion since I forgot to get one at the store and I cooked them on the BBQ after the slow cooker, to carmelize them!  Definitely a keeper!  THANKS!!!  AND SO EASY!

Have made this 2x now.  This is a keeper.  Nice to have ribs all year around!  I am going to use this method to pre-cook my ribs in the summer before grilling.  The meat falls right off the bones and I love how lots of the fat cooks off in the crockpot!

Loved this easy recipe. I've even made this with just salt and pepper on the ribs and beef broth instead of water and it's still the best ribs I've ever had. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious recipe for ribs not BBQ'd. If you follow it exactly you will not be disappointed one bit. Substitute water with a different braising liquid or rub with more spices to make this recipe your own.

Oh my gosh!   This was perfect!  This was so good that I had no left overs and there's just me and my husband. The only change is I did not discard the onion and garlic,  I fried them up in with my morning hash browns for a fabulous distinctive taste!!!

These were unreal! I did make a couple adjustments, though. I also rubbed the meat with some cinnamon, and added some unsweetened applesauce. I let everything marinate overnight before slow cooking. Round two is marinating now, and I added a couple splashes of maple whiskey and a little mustard powder. I'm sure they'll be lovely, too!

My family loves, loves, loves this recipe.  My boys refuse to eat ribs any other way.  The meat falls off the bone.  I also use beer instead of water and season with "franks famous rib rub."

These were excellent and so easy!  I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the ribs over night (I used olive oil, apple cider vinegar, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, garlic powder, and pepper).  This made the ribs so flavorful!!  I also used beer instead of water in the crock pot.  I cooked them on high for 3 1/2 hours and they were perfect!

This Recipe is a good base for creating your own recipe for slow cooked baby back ribs.  I have used this recipe twice, both times adjusting and adding different spices and vegetables, and both times it was outstanding.  The cooking times were perfect and it was fun adding my own mix.

This is a good recipe I use all the time...Instead of water I use chicken broth and beer for a bit more flavor....I also recommend marinating the ribs for a few hours or over night if possible...I use a marinade called Chaka's MMM Sauce ..they have a website if you cant find it in your local market...its the best marinade I have found and I use it on chicken,pork,beef...

These were the most tender delicious ribs I ever had....I think when the weather permits, I will put on the grill for the last step instead of the oven...either way...this is how I will make my ribs from now on.

Absolutely delicious! They were tender, flavorful and all of my kids raved about them! I made my own BBQ sauce (nothing fancy, just out of my Betty Crocker cookbook). Definitely going to make them again!! Very easy to make which is a plus with this Grandma raising 4 grandkids!

What an easy and great recipe.  Rather than just salt and pepper, I seasoned our ribs with Cajun seasoning.  For the sauce, I used Guy Fieri's brown sugar bourbon BBQ sauce (I'm sure other brands would work well too).  Oven was set at 450 due to roasting potatoes and that worked great for caramelizing the sauce.  Fall off the bone goodness.  No leftovers.

OMG, this was so amazing!!!! I am not a huge ribs fan, but wanted to give this recipe a try. It was literally falling off the bone good! My husband and I couldn't get enough. I used an entire bottle of beer instead of the water and when I put the ribs in the oven I spooned the onions/garlic and beer sauce from the crock pot on top. (No use letting good stuff go to waste!) I think that really added to the tenderness and made for a nice sauce that pairs great with mashed potatoes. I'm making it again tonight!

Have tried this recipe twice now and love it. I did as one of the other reviewers did and after cooking in crockpot coat with bbq sauce and bake for 20 minutes at 350 and then put second coat of sauce on and broil for 10 minutes.  Very tasty and will keep in my rotation.

I made this recipe last night and the ribs were fabulous. It was the first time I have made ribs! I had lean cut spare ribs, and I put them in the slow cooker for 4 hrs on high as recommended. I was worried that they would not be as tender as baby back ribs, but they were literally falling off the bone. I used a Tony Roma's BBQ Honey sauce that was so good. Almost want to make them again tonight,as there weren't any left overs!!

In order to minimize grease, you can put them under your broiler 5 to 10 min. per side.  I like to cut ribs into serving size to make it easer loading the crock pot.  If you add 1/2 tsp or so of liquid smoke to the bbq sauce, it will make ribs taste like they were done on the grill.  I don't bother with the oven or grill to carmelize as we like them so tender right out of the pot.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used my favorite dry rub, and refrigerated over night. So tender, my family loved them. Totally fool proof, you can't go wrong, and so much less work!

This was a good method of cooking. The meat itself could use more flavor, even with a good BBQ sauce. Next time, I'll marinate the meat. Will cook again.

These were delicious.  Sometimes meat cooked in the slow cooker is a little bland, but these came out so tender and very tasty.  Was so convenient to be able to put them in the oven (I actually baked them for about 25 min) and they were ready.  Seemed so easy.

Had this for an office potluck and it went over exceedingly well.  I decided to give it a bit more flavor by adding a little liquid smoke and substituting some coke for the water.

Will definitely make it again.

First time for doing ribs in the slow cooker.  WOW!  They were fall off the bones tender...even that little piece on the end that always turns out dry.  I did use beer instead of water for an added flavor.  If I did have anything negative to say it would be that it could have used a little more flavor but the beauty of this recipe is it's begging to be tweaked with additional spices.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and only baked it for 10 minutes with the BBQ sauce.  Still moist and delish. Thanks, Nora, for sharing.

My first attempt at ribs, and it was very easy and really good!  I asked the meat guy at HEB to help me pick them out; used coke instead of water; rubbed down with a little liquid smoke & worc. sauce with the salt and pepper. Also, I had no idea what "trim ribs" meant, so I just chunked them in the crockpot.  Turned out great and meat just fell off the ribs.  Served with Restaurant Style Cole Slaw and beans.  Fam wants it to stay in the rotation.

this was an excellent recipe, and I don't give out 5's easily. The key to the greatness is slow cooking for tenderness, then baking gently in barbecue sauce to give that ooey gooey glaze!

I was a little disappointed! I followed the instructions but it was a little dry! :( maybe I overcooked a little in the oven. The family loved it but I wasn't 100% with my efforts. Still a great meal!

I read a review that said that they would try a liquid other than water so I used one bottle of dark beer.  I also had 5 open bottles of BBQ sauce in the fridge so after throwing out the two expired ones I mixed the remaining 3 together and used them for the sauce.  All I can say is YUM.

Followed much of the advice in the reviews... 

1) Rubbed the ribs with garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, salt, and pepper... wrapped them and stuck in fridge overnight
2) Used Dr Pepper instead of water and layered the onions between the rib slabs starting with the onions on bottom
3) Cooked on low for 6 hours (because I out of the house) 
4) Brushed them with a good BBQ sauce and finished in the oven for 20 min or so.

Very tasty, but too falling off the bone.  Even on low six hours is too long in a newer slow cooker as manufacturers have recently upped the heat at every setting.

Very well liked by my family and company.  This recipe is definitely a base recipe as adding other items definitely helped.  I added Worcestershire sauce and paprika to this.  Definitely a good method for the winter months.

I followed Norah's revised recipe: Used 1/2 cup beer instead of water; used the rub on the ribs prior to placing in crock pot- salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and brown sugar. Did not use liquid smoke as I did not have and didn't miss. Cooked on high for 3 hr 45 min and then placed in a 350 degree oven- after adding bar-b-que sauce. After 20 minutes put under broiler for 10 minutes. Flavor was fantastic. Loved that the meat was still attached to the bones. Not overwhelming bar-b-que sauce that happens when adding that from the get go in the crock pot. Super recipe! Look forward to cooking again!

I added some liquid smoke in the crock pot and lots of chopped garlic. Cooked on high for five hours and then in the oven for thirty minutes. Very flavorful and meat fell off the bones

rib rub, brown sugar. marinade overnight, layed ribs flat to cook. liquid used cherry Pepsi.  3 hours on high, liquid was boiling.  Removed from crockpot. placed ribs on aluminum foil sprayed with Pam, brushed with  BBQ sauce. Finished in the oven.,fall off the bone. Family loved. Best I've made. I will back off crockpot time a little next time so ribs are tender, but stay on bone.

These turned out great. I used dr. Pepper instead of water and added a couple of dashes of liquid smoke but followed the recipe otherwise. I will definitely make again.

Thanks! Made these a week ago and already requested to make them again. Good thing my local grocery store had a heck of a sale on baby backs this weekend! Only thing I added was the liquid smoke another reviewer suggested. Used to use it all the time when I got lazy and didn't feel like grillin' or wanted that smoked flavor in a dish and didn't have the right meat on hand to get it.  Excellent recipe.

These ribs were fantastic. I cooked them on high and they were done but not falling apart. Perfect to put in the oven with barbeque sauce. My family loved them so this recipe is a keeper!

I don’t know what I could have done wrong, but the ribs just seemed a little off to me. Ended up pulling off the meat and using it for BBQ sandwiches. They were fine, but hardly delicious.

The best and easiest using the original reciepe.  My son loves bbq ribs and always ordered them when dining out.  Not any more. He ONLY wants these.  He says they ARE 
the best.

This is the easiest recipe with the most amazing results.  I will never make bbq ribs any other way.  I have used this recipe about 4 times now and each time they are just as good as the first. I highly recommend this recipe.

Best ribs ever and so easy to make.  I used a bottle of beer instead of water and the the bones just pulled right off the meat.  The meat was moist and tender.  I will never go out for ribs again.  These are so much better then restaurant ribs.  Give it a try.  You won’t be sorry.

We don’t do ribs very often, but bought a large pack at Costco, and fixed half of them  the “usual” way - boiled for a couple of hours then finished them on the grill. They were kind of tough so threw the other half in the freezer & forget about them. Decided to clean out the freezer & debated how to fix the second half since they were frozen solid. I thought I’d give the crockpot method a try. I cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours, but used a bottle of beer instead of water and followed the rest of the recipe. They were very tender and turned out awesome! I think we will have to make them more than once or twice a year now!

The ribs came out amazing.  I cooked all the way until it was time for the barbecue sauce.  I then transferred them to the grill and put the sauce on until it was heated through.  Delish!

I cooked the ribs on low for 8 hours.  They were juicy and tender.  I topped the ribs with Stubbs' Sweet Honey BBQ sauce from Safeway.  Delicious.

This might not be as good as tending the ribs in a smoker all day etc. but it comes close.  I made these and had no complaints from the family. I followed the recipe as it's written.

Loved these with the following changes:  Made rub out of  
1 and ½ t cumin, 1 T paprika, 1 T garlic powder, 1 T onion powder, 1 ½ t chili powder, 2 T light brown sugar, 1 T sea salt, 1/2 t cayenne pepper, 1 t black pepper, 1 t dry mustard powder. After removing membrane, rubbed ribs and let sit overnight in fridge. Cooked in slow cooker in regular coca cola (not water) for 3.75 hours on high.  Left out onion and garlic as that is in the rub.   Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), transfer ribs to a baking sheet. Pat dry. Coat ribs with barbeque sauce. (I used Sweet Baby Rays Sweet n Spicy). Bake in preheated oven for 20 min; flip halfway through. Changed to high broiler for 4 minutes; make sure you do not go over and burn ribs.
Absolutely everyone wanted more of these!  Thank you for sharing your recipe. Will make these again and again...

Will definitely make again! The ribs were so tender and juicy! I cooked them for about 6 hours on low in the crock pot and then finished them up as recommended in the oven. I added garlic powder and onion powder to the salt and pepper rub before placing in the crock pot. Otherwise followed all of the directions. SO GOOD!

I was skeptical at first, I didn't want my ribs to turn into a version of pulled pork, They did not with the revised instructions on cooking on high in the crock pot for 3 1/2 to 4 hours.  After cooking we did the oven method only because it was raining.  Looking forward to putting on the grill afterwards to get that caramelized sauce coating.

I made it for Memorial Day and it was a big hit with everyone.  I did find that 8 hrs on low was too long for my modern slow cooker.  I checked after 6 hours and the meat was already falling off the bone.  That didn't affect the taste, though.  Took them out and wrapped them in foil until time to serve, then heated them in the oven slathered with original Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Tender and Delicious.

FINALLY!  I've been on a quest for the perfect rib recipe and this is it!  I read the reviews and made some alterations.  I used 1/4 c. white wine & 1/4 c. beef broth.  Left everything else the same.  My Crockpot cooks fast, so I only slow cooked on high for 3 hours, then I slathered the ribs in BBQ sauce and place in the oven for 20 minutes.  Perfect!

These ribs are not only good for "crockpot" ribs, these ribs are restaurant quality.  The absolute best ribs (other than smoking them) I've ever had.

OMG! Cooked these on high 4 hours. Also used beer instead of water.  Slathered with Scott  Hibb’s Amazing Whisky Grilled BB Rib sauce made from this site and baked as directed. Fall off the bone delicious. If you have the extra time, would highly recommend this home made sauce over bottled. So good. Grilled recipe is also awesome.

Excellent. My husband deemed them "legit." 

I ordered some bbq sauce from his favorite rib place in Atlanta and I'm going to make these again for him. :)

instead of water I used apple juice, added 1/4 cup red wine, i too put a dry rub on them along with sea salt, as well as the onion and garlic. The only thing was  I couldn't control the length of time since I was at work, so 9 hours on low really made them fall off the bone tender, it was wonderful to eat after finishing them in the oven with "Sweet Baby Ray's" original sauce on top, next time i will choose the keep warm setting to see the result

Simple to make and taste great. I used her altered recipe but used coke-cola instead of pepsi, I also seasoned with a mix of Corkys, Dancing pig and Rendezvous seasonings. Turned out well, I was impressed.Also forget the 8 hour cooking on low setting, Too many complaints. Only cook on high no more than 4 hours. Remember this is a substitute way to cook ribs that works well, not a replacement.

The ribs were "fall of the bone" and very tasty.  Liked the final step in the oven to give it somewhat of a crust as on the grill.  No fuss or muss.  Would use the recipe again.

Great recipe. Best ribs I've ever had. I'll  never do ribs on the grill again. These were that good.

I cooked it a bit long and it was falling off the bone. This wasn't a problem for us.  Absolutely delicious. The leftover broth is great for ramen (with a few added ingredients).

I made these for our family superbowl party.  They were fall off the bone perfect and delicious!! I cooked in slow cooker with one can diced tomatoes, worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and brown sugar.  Then cooked in oven with bbq sauce.

Very good and super easy. Only thing I did differently was put them under the broiler on low for 3 minutes to crisp up a little at the end. I used 6lbs of meat but didn’t double the recipe and it came out great.

The recipe was great, except for one thing: My ribs didn't need to be slow cooked on low anywhere near the 8 hours suggested.  (Perhaps my cooker's heat register is very different from theirs?)  I would suggest setting it for about 5.5 - 6 hours, check them, and then go from there.  The ribs, though overcooked, were delicious.

Pretty good! I brushed both sides with BBQ sauce but it still felt a little light on flavour, so next time I'll be a little more aggressive with the sauce. Also, importantly, the meat was falling too much off the bones, so I will cook only on low next time and/or cut the cooking time by about an hour. Very easy recipe though.

fabulous and easy.   who can ask for more?   I used leftover coke instead of water and spiced up the rub a little bit with garlic salt, onion salt,  light brown sugar  and papricka.  The leftover soup was almost as food as the ribs.  The ribs came out finger licking good.  I think anyone could change this as they desired and it would still come out perfect.  What a great recipe.  thank you so much

Line baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper for easy cleanup. Super easy and very tasty. Did some without the BBQ sauce and they were very good, too just plain.

I will never cook ribs any other way! Seasoned the ribs before putting them in the slow cooker along with the onions and garlic. They came out fork tender! With using a liner in the slow cooker and foil when they were in the oven, there were no pots to wash! Rave reviews all around!

These ribs are so simple and easy.  I did not use the onion or garlic.  I rubbed the ribs with a dry rub on both sides.  I let them rest for awhile .  Followed the rest just as written and they are outstanding! Will be in the regular rotation of meals!

These ribs turned out great! I never thought they would be so good cooked in a slow cooker, but they are! This will be my new way of making these until summer time when we cook out! I added Worcestershire sauce, apple cider vinegar and a Pepsi to the crockpot instead of plain water. It’s amazing. Thanks for the sharing your recipe idea.

These ribs are fall off the bone, good to the last bite, then lick your fingers after good!! I slow cooked them on low for 8 hours. Instead of using salt and pepper, I used a rib rub. Love these ribs! I'll be making more this weekend.

I followed this recipe exactly and did not make any changes.  It was so easy to make and everyone loved it.  My husband doesn't believe in making dinner in a crockpot but he has already asked me when I'm going to make these ribs again .  Thank you allrecipes for another great recipe.

My first time making ribs. They turned out so good, there was nothing left. I did add more water than the recipe called for as I wanted the meat juicy. And cooked it for 6 hours. Fell of the bones while eating it.

These were great--fork tender after 8 hrs on low in crock pot.I used baby back ribs as they are more lean. I layered like recipe showed, around the side of pot where the heat actually comes from.  Finished with Jack Daniels honey barbecue sauce in oven for 15 min. Yummy!  will make again.

We thought this recipe was just okay. They were ribs. They were edible but nothing really special about them. Will probably try something different next time.

This is my go-to recipe for ribs(too hot to bake all day and grill is not always available with fire danger, where I live).  I do change the seasonings and meat(although the stated recipe is good), but by far this is the most practical guide for slow cooker topped off by a quick baking (for texture) that I have found.  Just finished a rack of elk ribs this morning (less time than store meats, less fat).  Great instructions, works every time....season as you please.  Experiment, have fun.

Excellent recipe Norah! Doubled everything in the recipe for my family, and it came out FANTASTIC ! The next time I make it, and believe me with all the raves from everyone, I'll be making it a lot, I will not double the water, I'll just keep the 1/2 cup that was called for with the 3 pounds, as that was the ONLY thing that was brought to my attention.  Again high 5!

I followed this recipe as written and it was outstanding.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, but still held their shape.  I checked the ribs in slow cooker about 2.5 hours in and rotated them for even cooking.  I finished the ribs on the grill with a slathering of Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  About 15 minutes on a medium gas grill caramelized the sauce perfectly!  I will try a more flavorful rub (brown sugar, paprika, garlic power, onion powder, black pepper, kosher salt) next time.

My son loves these!  And depending on your mood or the crowd you are serving to, you can adjust how these taste based on what type of BBQ sauce you use.

These were the best ribs I have ever made.  I cooked 2.5 lbs of baby back ribs on low and they were done in about 7 hours.  I substituted beer (cheap brand) for water and used a whole onion.  I used Wegman's brand Memphis style BBQ sauce.  These were falling off the bone when done, and were so easy to make.  I, for sure, will be making them again!

Finally getting around to reviewing this. I've made this twice. The first time, 6 hours on low which was way too long and I ruined it. WATCH your slow cooker. You want the rib meat to start to pull away from the bone. A fork should go in, but not separate it from the bone. Then, take it out, put sauce on and bake it 350 until your desired doneness. For me, that was 4 hours in the slow cooker and 30 mins at 350. That knowledge came from the second try. I won't do ribs any other way.  Instead of the 1/2 cup of water, I used soda. Cherry cola this 2nd time. THANK you very much for this excellent cheat!  **Third time the charm. All the same as above, but salted the ribs one day ahead which acts as a dry brine. Wonderful...and thank you again.**

Very good ribs! The only thing I would do differently is use water like recipe suggests.  One of the reviews suggested using beer instead of water which I did.  Did not like the beer taste or smell to ribs.

Will make this again because it was so easy, but I would spice the ribs with a rub first for more flavor.  Ribs were a little bland.

I used Denise Smith's dry rub prior to proceeding with the actual recipe. Other than that, followed it exactly with crockpot on low for just about 8 hours. Husband is my judge and jury and it is a keeper.

Made today.  Only "change" we did was add garlic powder to the salt and pepper seasoning on the meat.  Turned out fabulous and a keeper in my house now.

I used the slow cooker as in the recipe. We brushed them with BBQ sauce and put them on the grill the last 20 minutes turning every 5 minutes and brushing with more sauce. We will be eating them often , it was so easy and delicious.

The reason I want to cook ribs in the slow cooker (at least in the summer) is to avoid turning on the oven. So I finished them on the grill for about twenty minutes instead.
After 3.5 hours on high and 30 minutes on low, my baby back ribs  fell apart when pulled out of the cooker, resembling pulled pork more than ribs!  Next time I'll try 5-6 hours on low.  They were tasty, though.

This is the best rib recipe I've ever had outside of grilling.  I didn't even marinate prior to placing in the slow cooker.  I used Coca Cola instead of water which added an extra fall of the bone tenderness.  Thank you to the submitter.

It was the best baby back ribs ever. I did add 6 minced garlic cloves, 1 onion sliced, left over roasted tomatoes, a bit of red pepper flakes, some Italian seasoning and 3 bay leaves. I used my air fryer instead of baking it.

I had a change in plans after I put ribs in crock pot so I ended up putting them in refrigerator after cooking until next day.   Finishing them in oven next day in BBQ sauce was so easy and they were delicious.

I made this incredible rib recipe, and my husband (who has a meticulous palate) said it was restaurant quality.
I used a little more garlic than the recipe called for, and the flavor was outstanding.
Just made a rib meat sandwich with the little bit of leftovers.
Delicious!!!

Such a simple recipe...but oh so good! So my only difference to the original recipe was that i used a rub i had. But every thing else was exactly as the recipe. Frankly, i was surprised that so little water was needed.

Easy!  I did 1/4 cup of Apple Cider Vinegar and 1/4 cup water in the bottom. Cooked in crock pot on low for 5.5 hours, then coated in BBQ sauce on a baking sheet, and cooked in convention oven for 15min. Came out falling off the bone PERFECT sauce carmelization!

An easy way to make ribs when you don’t want to fire up the grill! I used Zatarains as a dry rub, half cup water with some liquid smoke in the bottom of the crock pot, placed the ribs atop and cooked for 4 hours at high. Brushed Sweet Baby Rays on both sides of the ribs, baked for 15 minutes at 375 and they were great. Will definitely make again!

Simple and very tasty recipe, the best ribs that I have ever made. After reading the reviews,  I replaced the water with RootBeer (I did not have any Pepsi on hand) and seasoned the ribs with a rub of salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and brown sugar. Added chopped onion and garlic powder (I had no garlic cloves), cooked them on low for 8 hours,  then baked as directed in the recipe.  I will be making this again!

I used a pork rub instead of salt and pepper.  Also added a tablespoon of liquid Hickory Smoke and a quarter cup of Apple Cider Vinegar.  It really turned out good.    Next time i may let it stay in the oven a bit longer.   It was fall off the bone tender.

I followed the recipe exactly and used Bullseye Old West Hickory bbq sauce to finish them off. Oh man, they were so great! Definitely toddler approved, in fact, they were so good, when I tried taking the bones away from my 1.5 year old daughter, she growled at me. Going into the keep folder for sure.

This was my first try making ribs in a slow cooker. I followed the recipe EXCEPT that I added Dave’s Famous Rub before placing the ribs in the cooker. The ribs came out perfect. They were fragrant, tender and incredibly delicious. Now that summer is here, I’ll transfer the ribs from the slow cooker to my hardwood grill (instead of the oven) for finishing. Yum!

This turned out wonderful! The meat was falling off the bone after 4 and 1/2 hours in the slow cooker. The only change I made was I used hard apple cider instead of water for liquid. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

This is perfect!   I followed directions - I used beer in the crock - took ribs out at 2.5 hr mark - put on cookie sheet and brushed barbecue sauce on - baked for 15 min.   Fell off the bone!   This is a keeper!  

I made a spaghetti squash side for this which was perfect for this dish

We will make this again and again.  It was quick and easy plus delicious!  We chose not to bake the barbecue sauce on, after cooking it in the crock pot and just used barbecue sauce to add as we wanted. Scrumptious!

Very good ribs. I cooked 4 hours on high. Good, and tender enough, but not the fall-off-the-bone tender I was looking for. Next time I will cook longer. Maybe 8 hours on low will do the trick!

I started the crock pot on high for about 30 minutes before  turning it down to low.  The ribs were tender and juicy in about 4 hours time.  I finished them in the over as suggested and they were great.  I have shied  away from cooking ribs as I could never get them tender and they were dry.  We love ribs and I will be  cooking them often using this method.

Great recipe and easy to make. Added some paprika and additional seasonings and the meat turned out "fall off the bone" tender. Leave them in the oven a little longer for a crispier glaze. Family ate up two racks in about 10 minutes.

Ribs came out perfect. I added additional seasoning to them other than just salt and pepper. “Sprinkle on your favorite spice rub”. I was pleasantly surprised! I’ve always been a Smoker or Grill kinda of guy when it came to my ribs. But since it’s 9degrees outside I tried this slow cooker method. Glad I did. (I did them on high for 4 hours.)

This is the easiest rib recipe out there. Great for work days, just throw in the crock pot in the morning, ready in 15 minutes when you get home.  And the whole family loves it.

I've been making ribs in the slow cooker for years.  Over time, I've refined a recipe that never fails.  Before  placing in the crock pot,  a simple dry rub to add flavor.  Instead of water, try a can ok coke or Dr. Pepper.  This tenderizes the meat and adds a sweet flavor.  Instead of placing the ribs in the oven, I char them on the grill over a high direct flame. Add BBQ sauce, turn flame to med 5 min before removing from the grill.

While I love using the slow cooker I just was not pleased with the turnout of this dish. I cooked mine for almost 5 hours on high and some pieces came out still too tough. I used two slabs of baby back ribs and some parts were much thicker than the others (which would explain why some portions were tough.) I'm going to stick with my low and slow method in the oven.

We did this on a chilly winters day. We opted for the 4 hours on high in the slow cooker and it came out perfectly! Nice and tender but they didn't fall apart when you touched them.
  The only thing I will do differently next time (and this is my own fault) is I will do two or three 'layers'of BBQ sauce while the ribs are in the oven to give more flavour.
  While there is no substitute for a summer rack of BBQ'd ribs, this recipe is AWFULLY close!

I just made these ribs and they were great...So easy and they came out delicious.  I took the advise of the person who originally submitted the recipe and used Diet Cherry Pepsi in place of the water and I also added garlic & onion powder and some Splenda brown sugar to make a rub...cooked them 7 hours on low then baked for about 15 mins..tender and moist !! Thanks for the great recipe..I will definitely be making them again !!!

Great recipe for 'jumping off' to new horizons!  Done this twice now: First time just like instructed.  very good!  Done just like I like 'em!
Second time I 'sperimented a bit:
Rubbed with salt, pepper, and inexpensive Paprika.  Subbed No Salt Chicken broth for water, added 1 tsp of Better Than Boullion Vegetable Flavor. Added one half of a sweet Vidalia, and a clove of Garlic, to the top, per recipe.
Went with Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ, and the dish wuz Delish!  Thank you Norah!
Will likely play w/ it some more... will marinade the ribs in the rub and broth first, imparting (it is hoped!) more flavor to the ribs!  Don't get me wrong, the recipe, as is, was great, but my 'buds' are getting a little old and need a more intense blast, lol!
Thanks again, Noray

I had never made ribs before making this recipe. I wasn’t really sure what to expect, but this is was a WIN with the friends I made them for. I’m not really much of a grill master, so the slow cooker idea for ribs was very appealing to me. I used the updated recipe that the author recommended in the review section (using Pepsi instead of water, and using brown sugar, etc). I really wish she would just edit the actual recipe (if that’s possible), because with the edit, the recipe is perfect. You can kind of dink around with the cook time depending of your slow cooker and if you like your ribs more fall off the bone, or with more of a “bite” to them. I’m thankful for this recipe, it is SO easy and it makes me seem more impressive than I am ;-)

Excellent recipe!! I'd never made ribs before even on the grill but they came out GREAT!! I put them on for 4 hours at high and added half a bottle of beer when cooking . My salt of choice is Lawry"s seasoned salt. The taste was amazing and for the oven I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  They were fall off the bone good even though due to a timing error they spent more time in the oven than I had planned, at low. I will totally make them again!

I made it, along with the author's changes, and it was fabulous.  Took off the membrane on the back, gave it a rub of minced garlic, paprika, salt and pepper, some cajun seasonings. Cut up a whole white onion, placed in the bottom of the crockpot.  Put the meat in, meat side down. Poured over 3/4 cup Foster's ale and heated for 1 1/2 hours high. Then I did another couple hrs on low.  Took the ribs out, put on a baking sheet with foil. Spread BBQ sauce over the ribs and popped in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes. Scooped up the onions still floating i the slow cooker, and put them over the potatoes with butter. Heaven.

Will definately make these again.  Update: dry rub ribs with a spice combo, wrap and refrigerate 3-8 hours.   Place ribs in crockpot and cook 3-4 hours with 1/2 can of cheap beer.    Rest ribs on counter for 30 minutes.   Grill with sauce until caramelized.   Best ribs ever!   I used trader joes bbq sauce with a splash of the TJs ghost pepper bbq sauce...perfect combo.

This was super easy.  Put it in the crockpot as directed, and they came out nice and moist.  I always thought making ribs was hard, now I have a really easy recipe to go to.  Love it!

Terrific ribs.  Best of three recipes I have tried in the slow cooker.  I only cook for my wife and me,  so I make one pound of ribs.  I do remove the silver skin on the back of the ribs before I put them in the pot.  Instead of using a whole bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's like in some recipes, I only use about a third of a bottle. Love them.

I have only made ribs twice ever. I tried a recipe a few weeks ago and it was good. I wanted to do it again but the recipe I used was bbq sauce and soda. It wasn't saucy enough. I tried this one yesterday and it was amazing. So simple, and the perfect amount of sauce not watered down by the liquid. I think the onions in the cooking step flavored the ribs wonderfully! I will make this recipe over and over!

This method made bottom of the barrel ribs taste good! First I did a homemade rib rub overnight then  I used a can of ginger ale for 2 packs of ribs and put some BQ sauce on them and cooked on high for about 4 hours. Then I threw more BQ sauce on and more spices and put in oven for about 20 minutes. 
Update: I may just skip the slowcooker next time. I made these again and they seemed a bit overcooked rather than tender. This time I did a rub (brown sugar, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper) for the ribs, left on about 30 mins before I put in oven at 400 degrees for 15 mins per side. Then I slathered on honey and added more spices and bq sauce, poured apple juice in slowcooker and cooked it for about 3.5 hrs on high. I added more spice and BQ sauce throughout. I had so many ribs I had to cook some in oven, which I did at 275 degs for same length of time wrapped in foil. Then after I added mixture of honey, spices and BQ sauce I carmelized all for 10 mins. All were good but ribs that stayed in oven whole time were very tender and juicy.

Made these last night for dinner and everyone loved them. I followed the recipe plus the additional changes by Norah in her review/comments. I prefer tender ribs with the meat still attached to the bones and these ribs were just that, tender and very tasty. Will def make again.

Best way to make ribs if you're unable to smoke them. I even used pork spare ribs and the meat was so tender--just fell off the bone! I used a different sauce and mixed it with some Coca Cola in the crockpot.

Simple and delicious.  I used Avery's Ellie's Brown beer instead of water and Carolina bbq sauce.  I cooked the ribs for 4 hours on high in my slow cooker.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  I could not believe how well they turned out.  As good as any restaurant!!!!!  Thank you for this excellent recipe :)

These were definitely fall off the bone!  This was a very easy way to make ribs when you don't have the time to hover over them or if you don't want to heat up the kitchen baking them first.  I had doubled the recipe and this recipe still worked fine.  I will make this again and not sure I would do anything different.  I might make my own sauce since bottled sauce is not my favorite, but that doesn't change this recipe.

It was all right. I swapped water for porter beer. But it was a little dry and the bbq flavor didn't really penetrate the meat. Furthermore it was pretty crumbly and not very cohesive.

Rolyn Sales here.
I make my ribs in a slow cooker for 6 hours.  1-1/2 slabs of baby backs standing on edge, resting on a bed of thinner carrots.  Remove and placed on a lined cookie sheet and BBQ sauced in the oven for an hour @ 325°.  Unbelievably great tasting with 1/4 the fat!

This was my very first time making ribs in my life - EVER - and they turned out beautifully!  I altered this recipe by putting the garlic and onion in the bottom of the crock (lined it first with a crock liner) and using Coke instead of water.  Otherwise, I followed it exactly. 

A note for other first-timers: perhaps this is common but I didn't know to expect it: the ribs were GREY after being in the crock pot for 4 hours.  But after I put the barbecue sauce on them and baked them (on a foil-lined baking sheet), they looked exactly like ribs *should*, and tasted delicious.

I probably should have cooked mine a bit longer, since the meat was tender but not falling off the bone as I like it.  Still, they were really delicious.  The only other change is that I added a bit more chopped garlic than called for and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce to the coke, since I read in other comments that it was included in some marinades. I bet soy would have been delicious, too!

Served with cole slaw and baked beans.  Thanks for a great recipe - I will definitely be making this again!

Very nice! Didn't use all the bbq sauce. Just brushed generously to marinade and then finished with a bit more on the grill for caramelized goodness. Very delicious!

I pretty much followed the recipe but added a few additional spices to the rub and put it in the refrigerator overnight. I gave it the the full 8 hrs using beer instead of water then put it in the BBQ rather than the oven. It tasted great. The only disappointing thing was that the meat fell off the bones. I would have preferred that the meat would have stayed on the bones a little more.

I don't have a girll so this was a recipe I was looking for. These ribs are amazing. I read all the reviews and when I saw the review that the chef put on here saying they revised it I had to try it that way. I rubbed the ribs in the salt, pepper, garlic salt and brown sugar. Put it into the crock pit with the soda, garlic and onion. I left my crock pot on low because I was going to be gone last four hours. I followed the directions exactly after they were done. However, I did not throw out the onions or the juice. I out the onions on the baking sheet with the ribs and covered in BBQ sauce. Then I threw the baking sheet in the oven for 15.with the juice I made gravy for the side of mashed potatoes   The onions were AMAZING!!  Don't waste those opinions. They were sweet and crystallized like the ribs.The gravy was outstanding. I did add some beef bouillon to it before I made the gravy. The rib meat was perfect. Thank you for this recipe I will forever use this. Even if I do get a grill someday.

These were great!  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of cooking them longer.  I cooked them for about 5 hours on high.  Next time I would like to do for a full 8 hours on low.  Some were a little more tender than others.

We separated the ribs before cooking.  This recipe is the best rib recipe we have ever had.

Awesome ribs. I used a rub the night before and only cooked on low in slow cooker until just pulling from the bone before placing in oven with the sauce. Will definitely keep this recipe.

oh yes i will make this again. I used instead of spare rips pork loin. Has less fat and you don't pay for the bones. The Barbeque sauce is absolutely the best i ever had !!

Never made this before but I most definitely will again. So flavorful and tasty,my hubby and I ate them all! I left everything in the slow cooker, on high with just 1/2c water, turned them down to low for the last hour and added fresh made BBQ sauce to the slow cooker....AMAZING FOLKS...give this a try!

I made the Slow Cooker Baby Back Ribs, however I altered the recipe a bit.  Instead of putting the barbecue sauce on the ribs and putting them  in the oven, I put the sauce on the ribs in the show cooker and cooked them that way. In doing so you save time.  They were delicious.

These were amazing!! I don't have a grill so this recipe was the perfect solution. If you like onions don't toss them out! I used mine as a topping on mashed potatoes.

Great starter recipe easily tweaked for perfection! Before cooking an online recipe I always read the reviews and changes made to the original.  On the advise of another I shortened the cook time to 3 hrs to prevent it from falling off the bone and left it to warm while preparing the rest of the dinner. I also added additional seasonings as a rub for flavor on the advise of another reviewer. They would have been perfect without the bbq sauce.

What I did instead:
Added worcestershire sauce to the water. Used a flavored dry rub on the ribs (McCormick Applewood rub) before cooking instead of just salt and pepper. When putting them in the oven, I broiled them on the top rack instead of baked. They tasted perfect. Will make them this way again when I next make ribs.

1. Seasoning ribs with garlic salt, paprika, pepper, seal in the hot saucepan until both sides brown.
2. Add 2 TBSP vinigar in the slow cook along with water, onion, garlic and rib, cook 8 hours in low or 4 hours in high.
3. Move the ribs out of slow cook, brush BBQ sauce on the rib, put in oven at 375 bake 8 mins, turn over, brush BBQ sause , bake another 7 min.

Wow!  I was so pleased with this recipe.  I had a meat seasoning rub on hand that I used on the meat before I put it into the slow cooker.  I left it on high for 4 hours.  Then, I laid the rack on my foil-covered baking sheet, slathered on my favorite bbq sauce, and tucked it into the pre-heated oven.  Fifteen minutes later I was cutting the ribs apart to find that the bones just slid out, perfectly clean.  It was easy to plate up just the savory, tender meat.  Absolutely perfect!

I have made these ribs many times and keep coming back to this recipe. They are wonderful to make during a busy work week when we don't have time to barbecue. The only thing I do differently is rub down the ribs with a cherry rub my husband prefers. (We skip the salt and pepper) The onion adds a great flavor and it's a very easy clean up! Love, love, love this!!

These are amazing!  I've cooked these several times now, and they work best using a bottle of beer (prefer a lager-type).  I usually do 5-6 lbs of ribs and double the ingredients.  I usually cook them 7-8 hours on low, but the last time I made these, I cooked them 3-1/2 hours  on high, and 1 hour on low, and they completely fell off the bone.  Family raved about them!

Followed the recipe, came out a little dry. Did it on low and sauced it around 7 hours and just put  it in the oven. They were falling apart in the slow cooker at 6 hours...other than that it came out pretty good

They fell off the bone!! But like many others, I felt the meat needed more flavour. I will either marinate the meat meat or maybe try putting some sauce on the ribs while in the slow cooker.  But otherwise, a great method to cook tender ribs!

Beam of light, Angels singing.  You may as well make two batches because you will wish you did!!

Instead of the oven we finished them off on the BBQ with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

Such a simple recipe. So easy.  Dispells the myth of good ribs being a ton of work.  LOVE this recipe.

My dad gave me a frozen half rack of ribs which finally gave me a chance to do this recipe.  I was already excited about the recipe, but MAAAAAANNN!!! These were so good...and TENDER! They came out perfectly-I didn't want them falling off the bone too easily. I played around with the bbq sauce I had though. I had some  Kraft slow simmered barbeque sauce, added some hoisin sauce, and honey and they were lip-smacking, finger-licking good! I'll definitely do this again.

I've never even attempted to make ribs before so I was very nervous to try these (after all, ribs in a slow cooker??) Loved loved loved this recipe!! I followed Norah's advice in the comments (switched the water for Pepsi, added liquid smoke, and seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and brown sugar). Sooooo good. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!  However, the meat did not get as tender as I would have liked; probably the fault of the meat itself.  Would try it again.

These were so good and so easy! The only extra things I did - I took a moment to trim some of the extra fat off the ribs, and when I seasoned them, I patted them dry with paper towel first and  I sprinkled them liberally with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, a little cayenne, and lemon pepper,  as well as salt and pepper.  I had doubled the recipe, so I used a cup of water in the slow cooker. I cooked them on high for 2 hours and then low for 4 more hours. Perfect.  I used a bbq sauce I really like (Baby Rays Honey Barbecue)  and baked them until the sauce caramelized. They were tender and flavorful, and stayed on the bone. We loved them!

5 stars with some tips from comment section. I add vinegar and water to the pot, also dusted ribs with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and pepper. Cooked on 8 hr setting for 6 hours. Grilled them quickly and then into the oven. Delicious!

Amazing! The bones literally slid right out from the meat plus it's so simple and easy to make! I didn't quite use a full bottle of sauce, I just brushed sauce on once at the beginning and another halfway through. Perfection

This recipe is incredibly simple and easy. It is a great basic recipe with room to personalize. I added a ton more garlic, some hot pepper flakes and used beer instead of water. Turned out very tender and flavorful! Jack daniels barbecue sauce for the finishing touch!

I actually  messed up the first  time I made these......but it was good! I added the BBQ sauce in the crock pot, by mistake.  Turned out great. I continue  to add the BBQ sauce to crockpot   when I make, and place in oven, bast  with more BBQ sauce till  caramelized.....so good. Actually  making tonight!

I made this today and it was excellent!!!  Hubby kept going back for more.  I actually made 6.5 lbs in my slow cooker, I cut the racks in half, seasoned them with a little Lawry's seasoned salt and pepper on each side, used 2 cups of water, cooked for 4 hours on high, with garlic and one whole sliced onion.  When done, I put them on a baking sheet, covered them in BBQ sauce, and baked them on 375 for 15 minutes.  It was fall off the bone good, nice and tender, and very tasty.

Great ribs. I did rub with a pork seasoning and let sit for approx 4 hrs. Then cooked in Coke. Everyone loved them. Best slow cooker ribs I've made. 
The only reason I gave it a 4 star was when I followed the exact recipe, we found them bland.
Thanx

First time making ribs. Really easy and literally fell off the bone. I used Diana Gourmet BBQ sauce and followed some commentator suggestion on substituting water for beer. Will make them again soon.

Nice, simple and attainable. Salt & pepper ribs before putting them into the slow cooker, then top with onion and garlic. I  added 3 TBSP liquid smoke. I used Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce for the final cooking in the oven. With well-sourced ribs one should enjoy succulent, finger licking, falling off the bones goodness.

I was craving ribs, but with a foot of snow outside bbqing was out.  These were so easy to make, and fell off the bone, which actually made them easier to eat with knife and fork.  I think this is how I will do ribs from now on.  The flavor was great, and the meat super tender.

These ribs are still in the slow cooker and they already smell divine.  I used beer instead of water like another reviewer mentioned.
When my husband makes ribbon the grill he usually starts them in Apple juice, I might try that next time. I'll be back after they are devoured by my family.

Cooked these according to recipe. I did 8 hrs in crock pot on low which I think was too long. They were falling off the bone before I took them out of the crock pot. Roasted at 375 for 15 minutes which sealed the sauce onto the meat. They were tasty. May or may not make them again.

I wasn't disappointed.  Turned out terrific, tender, and juicy.  Falls off the bone. Added a few other spices such as ground fresh mustard seeds,  habenero peppers and some red wine vinegar.  
Wow! Will definitely be making again.

very good! I followed the updates and used Real Coca Cola no diet version instead of water. rub the ribs with common season blend of onion powder garlic powder salt pepper and paprika. left out onion slices and garlic cloves. will reduce slow cooker time to about 3 hours next time on high versus the 3.5. baked 15 minutes at 350 after adding sauce and broiled about 4 minutes. This ones going in my recipe box.

I'm rating this with my changes in mind. I used cider vinegar and chicken broth instead of the water. I also added a TBL of liquid smoke, Worcester sauce, and a1/4 cup of barbecue sauce. I also seasoned the ribs with garlic powder, onion powder, a little cayenne pepper for a kick, fresh ground black pepper, a little sea salt. I cooked on low 8 hours on low in crockpot. Transferred to a foul lined cookie sheet sprayed with Pam and slathered with baby rays barbecue sauce. Then ribs( mine were cut in half) then more sauce to thickly cover. Then baked as instructed, but you can grill them on the foil prepared the same way as well. These were the best ribs ever!

First time making it. Followed recipe. Seasoned meat with salt, pepper but added garlic powder. Also instead of water added equivalent of beef broth. My oven broke so could not do last step. So added sauce to ribs at end, and switched cooker to low at 4th hour, let cook in sauce another 30 min on low setting. Picky family loved it and said to make again!  It was delicious!

These ribs were very tender -- better than my usual boiling method. Next time, I will use a more flavourful liquid in the slow cooker and consider either smoked salt in the rub or else liquid smoke. I will add more spice to my rub as well, as others have suggested. Finally, I will either up the temperature on the over or cook longer for more sauce caramelization, which I like.

This recipe is amazing. They pretty much fell apart when I put them on the dinner plates. They were so good, my fiance got excited when he saw that I planned on making them again this week. This is one I'll keep for sure.

So easy and very tasty.  Love the method.  Will do this again.  I used  the Kansas-City dry rib rub and the sauce from that site as we love them and I had them on hand.  I usually rub the ribs with tons of rub and let them stand all day before cooking them.  I likely used too much rub and the 8 hours in the crock pot made the ribs a bit too spicy for my husband.  Not for me though.  And they aged well.  I had planned on making ribs and had them thawed out when this recipe popped up on my computer.  I took that as an omen to try the new recipe and I am glad I did.  This winter when it is too frigid to go out in the snow and wind to barbecue,  we can still enjoy ribs.  Thanks.  Clean up was a breeze !  I din't have beer so used beef broth as was suggested.  Next time i will buy a tin of beer .

This is a fabulous recipe! I put Greek seasoning on ribs before putting in slow cooker. Fell off the bone it was so tender. My husband normally does the ribs, but he said these were better than his!

I had been making ribs in my crock pot before finding this recipe but couldn't find the right combination of seasonings to tone down the tanginess of the BBQ sauce. I figured this would end up the same, so much better! my husband likes the ribs to fall off the bone so I leave them in the oven for about 1/2 hour longer.

This is a perfect base recipe, and becomes a five star recipe when you use the modifications suggested by the OG poster, or others. The method is perfect: 3.5 hours on high had these ribs ready to eat, I might even try less time next time, or cooking on low, for a bit more bite to my ribs. The water doesn't seem like much, and other recipes suggest "adding enough liquid to cover" but it wasn't necessary at all. I put this thicker rib sections on the bottom and the thinner layered on top and everything worked out fine. I used the onion/garlic/broth mixture leftover as the liquid in "A Very Popular BBQ Sauce" which is another recipe on this site (posted by JRNEUMILLER). Why let it go to waste? It was quick to prepare and left me with more than enough sauce for the next batch.

It was my first time cooking ribs... I put the ribs on before I went to church and cooked them on low all day. I had problems getting the ribs out the cooker because the meat was falling off the bones but I got them smothered in BBQ sauce and in the oven. My husband said they were wonderful. My only regret wasn't not making more. I ate mine way too fast! Next time, I will take the suggestion of others  to make a dry rub and put that on first. I did add more garlic and onions to begin with! This is going to be my go recipe for ribs. Thank you so much for sharing! I even told my girlfriend about how I made them...

I tried this recipe and it was alright, but not nearly as good as smoked ribs. When using the recipe, I prepared the ribs as if I were going to smoke them on a smoker - applied a good dry rub the day before I cooked them. I also used beef stock and Worcestershire instead of water. But I image anything to add some flavor would be fine (apple cider, beer etc..).

For the first time recipe these turned out very good. I did go with the beer & maybe next time try a Guinness instead and will definitely shorten the cooking time. I did the slow low for 8 where 6 will be what I'll go with next time. Also I add a TBS of red pepper flakes with the onion & garlic. Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked in slow cooker  a bit longer than recipe, probably 30-45  minutes longer.  Then transferred   to the oven for 15 minutes after brushing with BBQ sauce.  I used  K.C Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  Yummy and so easy!

I did use the beer instead of water & also used my own rub.  Very tender! Should have cooked about 45 minutes less but besides that we loved them.  2nd time i'll get it just right!  Thanks for recipe.

I made this pretty much as the recipe was printed. Only half the ribs called for and they were country style, no bone.  Turned out really good. 8 hours on low was too long for my slow cooker . Fortunately, I checked them at 6 hours. Already done. Will check at 5 next time. A few minutes under the broiler at the end makes a nice finish.

These were the best ribs I have made.  They are very easy to do but doing in the slow cooker they fell off the bone.   Delicious, my husband is a bit fussy about pork ribs but he loved these ones.

My hubby and I love this recipe!  I made one slight change - I used garlic powder because I didn't have any fresh garlic - and after about four, five hours I added some more water to the pot. When his shoulder heals from the surgery he had recently, we're going to use the grill to finish off the ribs instead of the oven. I bet that will make them even better.

Great recipe! I used spare ribs instead of baby backs, then finished them on the grill instead of the oven. They were so tender they were falling off the bone. So very yummy!

This was SO  good. Husband was skeptical about the rub, but couldn't get enough of it. It's been 2 days since I we grilled these babies, and he's STILL raving about them---even brought some to a co-worker! The ONLY things I did different: added garlic powder, and reduced the chili powder (had to take 2 12 year old girls' palettes into consideration). We grilled with only the rub, and served bbq sauce on the side... I think I'm the only one who used bbq sauce....NOM.

This came out AMAZING! I did the first hour on high and then the next 6 on low. So 7 hours total.

 However, I did alter the recipe a bit: 
I used Applewood rub instead of salt & pepper
 and I used Pepsi instead of water

For the BBQ sauce I used 'Sweet  Baby Rays' and I heated and charred it in the oven for 20 minutes. 

I would definitely make this again!

These turned out amazing! I read the original poster's new review as well as some others and made some slight modifications. I added a teaspoon and a half of each: salt, pepper, onion salt (I was out of the powder) and garlic and then added a hickory smoke spice we have from a local spice store. I didn't add the onions or minced garlic.  I then  added my own BBQ sauce and let it cook all day in the slow cooker. It really didn't need the 10 minutes in the oven. The meat fell off he Bone as I took them out. Yum!

I followed some of the advice about marinating with red wine vinegar, Worcester sauce and soy sauce. Then followed directions exactly. Very tender and flavorful. My first time making ribs and it was super easy. Great!

I made these in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and added 1/2 cup of beer,  salt, pepper and garlic powder. 
Finished in the oven with a few different sauces as I wasn't sure what I'd like. 
I was surprised that they seemed to taste even better reheated the next day.  Next time I'm going to make in advance and just reheat when I'm ready to serve.

I gave it my personal home touch for creole flavor. That secret is on your hands.  But the slow cooker receipe is a total success!  So tender, that the bones comes out wirh a shake.  Instead of the oven, I gave them a ride in my BBQ grill.  Now I'm stuck to it because my family wants every single time they get in the pool (almost everyday ahhhhhh).  Its a 10.

Fool proof. I was intimidated by ribs most of my life, but never again. This recipe was perfect for a beginner who doesn't want to put a lot of effort into delicious meats.  I added paprika and  chili powder to the ribs while they slow cooked.

If you are pressed for time in the AM, and just have to get the ribs in the slow cooker, this recipe is ok.  I would much rather make my own recipe or at least use root beer instead of water.

I made this exactly like the recipe said. I think my crockpot runs hotter and I probably should have cooked it for an hour to an hour and a half less on high. The ribs were yummy and fell of the bone just like I love them.

1st time trying in crock pot!!! Did change it up a bit from your recipe. I marinated overnight in foil, salt SMOKED black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and brown sugar.  In the crockpot,  I put 1 bottle dark beer, half onion chopped and because we love garlic probably a whole head chopped up!!!! 3.5 hrs was perfect. Our favorite BBQ sauce to carmelize on the grill !!!! Will be making them again soon!!!

Ok, here's another rave review!  I haven't made decent ribs in 50 years and my husband just gets this resigned look on his face every time I try a new recipe.  I followed this recipe word for word (except for 1 thing) and just crossed my fingers.  My husband took one bite and all he said was, "what did you do?"  The next thing I knew, he had polished off (or rather inhaled) the whole pile of ribs I had put on his plate.  They were tender and delicious and so easy to make.  The only thing I did different was add some barbeque sauce to the ribs in the crockpot.  Not a lot, just squeezed a little on each rib section so they would soak up some of the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe...I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The first time I made it, I perused the comments and ended up doing a rub the night before and then stuck it in the crock pot. The second time, I was short on time, so I just followed the instructions exactly, and they actually came out much better. They were just a tad dry, but still very, very good.

I used boneless ribs, onion powder instead of sliced onion, and parts of two different bbq sauces I had on hand.  I'd like to try finishing them on the grill next time instead of in the oven.

we're not rib fans in our household, but I had a weird craving for them. Thanks so much for posting this recipe, it was my first time making them and I think you've converted us! My 3 yr old daughter couldn't get enough and even ate all her veggies just to get more ribs!

I made this for Father's Day. Everyone raved about it!! The ribs were so tender, I had trouble getting it off the grill. This was definitely a hit! The only thing I did differently was put it on the grill and basted them with bbq sauce. This is my "go to" recipe from now on!

We added some parsley flakes and some italian seasoning along with the salt and pepper before throwing it in the slow cooker. The flavor was amazing, we werent sure how ribs in a slow cooker would turn out but they were so tender and were falling off the bone!

These are amazing!!! I used a dry rub (garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, paprika, brown sugar, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt and black pepper) overnight, followed the slow cooker instructions to althe letter and made small adjustments to the oven method. 350 degrees for twenty minutes, a second layer of bbq sauce and 20 minutes more. These may be my favorite ribs ever!

Awesome!   I couldn't believe how easy it is to make baby back ribs.   

Mentioning the delicious ribs to someone they asked, "did you boil them? ... Did you grill them on low?...did you..."  Dare I share that all I did was cut them in sizes to fit in crockpot (2 layers), added onion & garlic? pour in 1 cup beer, seasoned  with salt/pepper, put on low for 6-8 hrs.   The meat appeared to be  falling off the bone!

I used a metal spatula to transfer them to cookie sheet (covered in aluminum foil and nonstick spray for easy clean up).  Basted bbq sauce on both sides, cook 375 for 8 min, baste again with BBQ sauce, 8 minutes in oven...>>> Done and delicious!

My household ate them;  including my 2 and 4 year old!  Enjoy!

Have used this method many times, it's wonderful!  I am free to visit with guests and still serve a delicious bbq!  I use a dry rub on the ribs when I start them - I've used many different versions and it's always good - and when it's time to pull them from the crock, if I'm really lazy I have even poured off the extra cooking juices and poured the liquid bbq sauce over the ribs right in the crock and finished them on high for an hour - still delicious!

Followed your second posting. Seasoned the ribs with blackening spices, garlic powder and brown sugar prior to putting into the crockpot. Used Pepsi in place of water.
Cooked on high for 4 hours. They were tender but not falling off the bone. Broiled with a light brushing of Sweet Baby Ray's. Will make again.

I made this as written except that I put the crock pot on low for 7 hours.  Next time I would cut the time to 6 hours on low as the meat was falling off the bone, which was not a big problem, as my family is not fussy, but a little less tender would have been good.  Will use this recipe when I have the need for ribs!

Personally,  I prefer ribs with some "chew" but four hours on high made them "fall off the bone", so I'll watch that next time. Otherwise, this was fantastic. Finishing them in the oven gave them a nice glaze, just as promised. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I made these over the weekend and I was  skeptical of the time needed in the slow cooker of only 4 hours when I am so used to low and slow.  Needless to say, I followed the recipe exactly and wow were they delicious!  Who would of thought such few ingredients could make this dish.  Found a new way to do ribs.

This was the best ever! I combined this recipe with one of the reviews on this page that said to marinade overnight. I used the slow cooker on low for about 6 hours and it was falling off the bones. I put the barbque sauce on on baked it as recipe says and turned the ribs over, put on more barbque sauce and baked a few more minutes. Absolutely fantastic, and easy! Thanks so much!

I made these for a Memorial Day gathering where we wanted to join in on the fun rather than being stuck in the kitchen or sweating over the grill. They turned out being very good and so easy to prepare....allowing for time to relax with our guests.  I followed the recipe as written except Instead of finishing the ribs in a 375 degree oven, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and finished the ribs in a 350 degree oven for 20 mins. and then broil them for 7 minutes to crisp them up.  Will be using this recipe again.

I've never made ribs and I have to say these turned out great unless you wanted to eat them on the bone...because the meat just fell off. Moist, juicy, delicious.

I gave it 3 stars as it was easy to prepare and that is what I wanted . However for me it lacked taste. If it wasn't for the barbecue sauce it would not have a taste . I followed suggestions of using some cola instead of water as well as rubbing some spices on the ribs before starting to cook them. I put in more garlic & onion also. But I have had better recipes  with more taste but are more complicated . I might make it again but only if I was pushed for time.

My boys don't really like messy food much, but since I've been sick they've had to endure a number of easy dinners. Now that I'm on the mend, I decided to try these ribs for a real Sunday night dinner. I followed the suggestions of the original author, rubbed the ribs and cooked them in Pepsi, then popped them in the oven with the BBQ sauce on.  I did 15 minutes on each side, and would probably have increased that to 20 on each side at 375, or do the 15/15 split, then turn up the broiler for a minute or two. Really tasty, I highly recommend them, and the boys ate them with no problem - messy fingers and all.

It wasn't bad but wasn't 4 stars either.  Cooking time was off a bit I feel as at the 7 hour mark, it was starting to push as over cooked.  Maybe it was just my slow cooker?  I don't know.  Meat was fall off the bone tender though and recipe was simple enough.  I changed my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars while writing the review.  Maybe it was at least 4 star after all....but not 5

Omg! Amazing! Melt in your mouth delishisness! Best I've ever tasted! I used Dr. Pepper and did the rub of salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder and a little brown sugar and let it marinate in the fridge overnight. Cooked on low for 8 hrs and then Jack Daniels Honey BBQ sauce and 20 minutes at 350. Mmmmm!

This recipe was perfect! Although I used almost 4lbs, I just added a little more time to cook 4 1/2 hours on high! It was delicious!

Follow the exact recipe. Very easy to make almost idiot-proof. Made it for elderly parents who appreciated the ease of eating the falling off the bone meat. In my opinion it's far easier and probably better then the more complicated recipes found here.

It was great!! The ribs were tender, even after my mom, who has had five strokes, again touched a half finished dinner and throw a minimum amount of sauce on it before putting it into the oven for only God knows how long so......Needless to say she dried them out. I tried o restore them and the meet for the most part was still tender. I would have given them five stars,  My rating has nothing to do with the recipe itself. I also used my own seasoning salt( Lawry's) to season them before throwing  the ribs into the crock pot otherwise stuck to directions! Great method/recipe!

This is the best rib recipe I've found.  I made one change, as advised by another reviewer, and used chicken broth rather than water in the slow cooker.  My family raved.  Thank you!

Please do yourself a favor and make this recipe!  So easy and basically no mess nor fuss. Somethings to note though:  1.)  You will need to season the ribs BEFORE you put them in the slow cooker.  The meat needs salt, pepper, and whatever other staples on your spice rack.  2.)  Use something other than water as your liquid.  I used a Pepsi and it really helped add that special something to the meat.  I would use a Pepsi again, and would try it with beer, or a liquid smoke/water mix.  3.)  Like some of the reviewers mentioned, 4 hours on High is waaay too long.  I checked mine at 3 hours and they were just right - could cut them with the edge of a fork!!  Any longer and they would have shredded.  4.)  The oven option is a must.  This will give you the sticky sauce your looking for when you eat ribs.  Happy cooking!

I added a few extra seasonings (Lawrys, garlic powder, paprika, ground mustard, pepper). Substituted red wine vinegar and a.c. vinegar for water. Cooked on high for about 3 hours 15 minutes. Did the sauce/oven thing. It was super easy fast and delish.

I thought these ribs were wonderful! They were very tender. Maybe if I would have marinated them, the meat itself would have more flavor, but the BBQ sauce definitely made up for it. Great recipe.

I am currently making, as I type lol I am cooking it over night and was wondering of anyone else has done it this way. I plan to get up and have time to finish them and cool before placing in the fridge. I just really hope they still taste good after being reheated . Im having guests over and don't want to be embarrassed lol but I work 10 hour shifts and there is no way I would be able to come home on lunch...So over night it is. Thanks for the recipe. My fingers are crossed

This is like the 10th time I've made these. My mother is so mad I've found a way to out do her recipe and she doesn't even know mine is 10 times easier. This is my favorite meal. I did what a lot of others do, as Noah suggested in an earlier comment: replace water with Pepsi (or Dr. Pepper-amazing) and add some liquid smoke. These ribs are made so often I'm gunna break the slow cooker before Christmas.

The method here was right on. I think flavor also comes from quality of meat, not just the extras. I did use some Better Than Beef bouillon and garlic in the cooker, and then slathered on sweet hickory BBQ sauce for the oven finish. Mwah! Delicious!

I changed it up quite a bit.  Replaced the water with .5C oj and .5 C BBQ sauce.  Cooked 8 hours on low,  it had fallen off the bone the meat was so tender.  Then drained it, mixed with mroe BBQ sauce, and baked at 375  for 15 minutes.  It was good, the boy made sliders.  I eliminated the salt and pepper but next time I'd add just a dash of salt.  And I doubled the garlic and onion.  As cooked it was a 4.5, I gave it a 5 just because all it really lacked was the salt I didn't add :-)  Next time I'll follow the recipe owner's suggestion of adding a splash of liquid smoke, or some smoked paprika.

Cooked this on low in slow cooker.  It was pulled pork after 4 hours.  There was no way we were going to be able to get this in the oven for the last step.  If I want pulled pork, would use a totally different type of pork cut.  This was a sad waste of baby back ribs.  Followed recipe exactly.

Ribs are always great in a crock pot but the best way to do it in my opinion is to use country style boneless ribs and put a little salt and pepper on them throw them in the crock pot add bbq sauce of your choice then and some beer of your choice instead of water, then the only thing you got to do is let them cook, mixing them every 30 to 45 min. The slower and longer they cook the better they are!

First let me say I'm rating this on the METHOD.  Being in NE Ohio it was to cold to grill., came across this and thought ok I'll give it a shot.  I used my own dry rub that my family loves other than that I did exactly what the recipe said.  Oh MY......these were wonderful.  My family devored them and my youngest said, you've made some awesome ribs in the past but these are the BEST...dont change anything!!!! Amazing fall off the bones ribs (ok I might have cooked them longer in the crockpot but we like them falling off the bones.)  Thanks for the recipe!

Great with the use of Coke as other reviewers suggested. I blended fresh onions, garlic, and scallions to slow cook with the ribs. Halfway (2 hours) through slow cooking I added some BBQ sauce so they could cook with it. Then placed them in the oven after the 4 hours of slow cooking with additional BBQ sauce. Came out great!

I followed SUGAR13's review and was generous with salt, pepper, garlic powder and smoked paprika on the ribs.  I used a bottle of Mexican beer in place of water.  My husband says they are MUCH better than my normal method of boiling prior to bbq'ing.  His exact words were "*&^% yeah, they were awesome!".  I used bottled BBQ sauce.   I am making them again today with apple cider vinegar because we don't have any beer.  I will also be using 'Scott's Whiskey BBQ Sauce' recipe as it is listed on ALLRECIPE's.  It is the best BBQ sauce I have ever had.  I will let you know how they turn out.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Good recipe but I agree with some of the other comments on two points. First, you should definitely marinate it overnight so that the meat is more flavourful. Second, I'd cut down the cook time slightly (15 mins on HIGH and 45 minutes on LOW) and then put it in the oven for the prescribed amount of time.

Pretty good! I think I'll do 8 hours on low vs 4 on high next time to get more of the fall-off-the-bone texture.

the timing was perfect. the ribs were soft and tender. I think it need it a little more flavor. I would try again or maybe leave the ribs seasoning  for a longer time.(maybe add sazon) :-)

Delicious. A little tough to transfer from slow cooker as the meat is fall off the bone.

This was delicious!  I followed the authors updated recommendations.  My family loves it!  When they smell it cooking they can't wait til dinner!  I tried to cook two batches in one crock pot and it took longer....... worth the wait!
I have made this several times and it has turned out great each time!

I cooked it on low.  It was falling off the bone.  My family enjoyed it.  I probably left it for a little too long, but all in all if was great.

I just made these, and they are AMAZING! I liked them so much that I registered with allrecipes just to write a review (: I used a whole onion, 2 cloves of garlic, and beer instead of water (as suggested by someone in a previous post). Actually, I added an additional 1/4 C of water in case the beer cooked off too fast.  My only complaint is that they are so good that I'm going to eat ribs too often now!

Made it as written except for using tastefully simple garlic garlic seasoning and onion onion seasoning (a recent gift) before putting in crock pot.  Cooked on high 4 hours, then in oven 15 minutes w Sweet Baby Ray's original.  Got rave reviews from the family!  Will def make again, so easy!

I follow the recipe and used beer. I'm not sure why everyone is raving about this. The ribs were very very bland. Yes they were fall off the bone, but they still need to taste good. Maybe chicken broth would give better flavor .

I didn't love these - I'm not sure if it is my slow cooker but all meat recipes I try in it come out with the the same slow cooker taste.  I will try it again someday when I have a new one.

I used this recipe for country style pork ribs, instead of baby back ribs. I also used beef broth instead of water. This came out PERFECT-love it!

Used frozen boneless ribs I got on sale and had stored in the freezer.  Sprayed very lightly to make dry ingedients stick and coated ea. with a rib rub.  Also added a tsp. of liquid smoke and half an onion, sliced.
Cooked on high for an hour, then 5hrs. on low.  In my cooker, they were almost ready to fall apart by then.
Bonus:  I could not stand the thought of just tossing out that beautiful stock that was left after cooking.  Poured it into a batter bowl and refrigerated to get the fat to the top.  It made a jellied broth with a thick layer of fat on top.  Kept about 2 T. of the fat (for extra flavor) and tossed the rest.  After that just used the fat with Smart Balance, flour, milk, and a lot of the broth to make a lot of tasty gravy.  Yum.
Delicious.  Great recipe.

I substituted a bottle of beer in place of the water and rubbed them with a pork roast seasoning. I also recommend removing the membrane  from the back of the ribs before cooking. Meat just fell off the bone as I transferred them to baking sheet to put on BBQ sauce. very tender and delicious!

I basically did everything EXCEPT the night before I plan to cook them I buy a rub and put it all over the ribs and wrap them in saran wrap. I let them sit in the fridge like that over night then the next morning I cook them in the crock pot on high for about 5-5.5 hours and then turn it on low for another 2 hours. I broil the ribs for about 7-14 (varies on the size!) And it gets them crispy like on the grill! Just really watch them!!!

I substituted "Not Your Fathers Root Beer" in for the water so it gives the ribs a bit more flavor prior to adding the barbecue sauce - DELISH! I am a novice cook and even i can make this no problem - super easy!!!

I'm new to slow cooker cooking and wanted to try an easy & delicious recipe. I definitely found it in this one! No need to try any others! I followed Norah's revised recipe using the brown sugar/onion powder/ garlic powder/ salt & pepper rub along with the cola replacement for the water (used Pepsi Max). They were already falling off the bone when I transferred them to the oven. After baking them in the oven for 15 mins with the BBQ sauce, I put them under the broiler for about 3 minutes to get them crispy. WOW....they were sooooo good. Definitely a keeper! Thank you, Norah, for sharing your recipe & all those who posted your variations!

I made this for my boyfriend & I and we absolutely loved them! We're both college students so grilling isn't always an option. It wasn't too expensive (seeing as it was for his birthday dinner) and the very few ingredients made it easy. When we got home, the house smelled amazing, and the ribs FELL off the bone. I added some onion powder to the rub, and put some carrots and potatoes in when cooking. Next time I'll probably try beer instead of water, and I may marinate it beforehand. Overall, amazing and we're totally having this again!

These came out great! I used spareribs. I saw Norah's review of her own recipe and took her advice except for the Pepsi. I used beer instead. These were tender, juicy, and flavorful. They were super easy to make, too. Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I made as listed EXCEPT I dissolved a beef bullion (sp?) in a cup of water, instead of using just plain water. This is my second time making these & they are delicious. Very tender, very easy, my kinda meal!

I gotta say, these are delish, tender & so easy to throw together. I make them up right to the end detail of putting in the oven with the bbq sauce. Then I cool them, portion them out & freeze, so handy for a quick weeknight meal. I didn't alter this recipe at all!

Made the recipe as is with 2 changes.  1) I removed the membrane from the underside and 2) marinated it overnight so the sauce would so in.

Can you say fall off the bone delicious?!!! OMG this is the only way I will ever cook ribs again! Seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, brown sugar and instead of the 1/2 cup water I used 1/2 cup Coke and a tablespoon of soy sauce...cut up 1 onion and put over the top. Cooked on low for 8 hrs...sauced in the oven.  Perfection! THANK YOU NORAH!

What a fabulous recipe!!!!  I adjusted the recipe for 4 servings.  As suggested,   I baked them first for a total of 30 minutes.  Used 1 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's Orginal BBQ Sauce, 1/2 cup of ketchup, 2 Tbls. Red wine vinegar, 1 tsp. each or oregano and Worchestersauce.  Didn't have any brown sugar or hot sauce.  After dinner, all we had left were empty bones.

I usually seared the meat first, but I'm glad I tried this recipe, I love how BBQ sauce caramelized in the oven at the end, and the meat was so tender. I made some changes to the recipe though. I dry brine the meat by rubbing kosher salt all over and leaving it in the fridge over night. I made spice rub with black pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder and cayenne and rub it before putting in the slow cooker. I also sprinkled liquid smoke on the meat. I sliced a whole onion and laid them on the bottom, did not add any liquid. I placed pork meat side down, bone side up and slather some BBQ sauce on the top. I cooked for a little over four hours in the slow cooker, slather more BBQ sauce, and finished in the 400F oven for 10 minutes.

Was good each time I made it. Sometimes I add in brown sugar, olive oil and an extra dash of  dry onion and garlic powder in addition to the fresh ingredients. Making it for a job potluck tomorrow overnight as I type this and have it on a 10 hour setting. The meat will not stay on the bone after it's done and just how I like it. Yum!

I made this with pork spare ribs and Sweet Baby Ray's "sweet and spicy" sauce. I replaced regular salt with garlic salt, and otherwise followed this recipe to a T! It was delicious!

Great recipe for ribs in the slow cooker. I used a few suggestions that others had made. I used Red's apple ale for the liquid in the slow cooker and I only let the ribs cook in the slow cooker for about 3 1/2 hours. This all made them very tender and not fall off the bone.

Made this yesterday and wow they were just like the ones I had from Outback. I did make a couple of changes, I used 1 cup of water and half about 1/4 of beer (it was left over) used garlic powder just because I didn't have fresh. Cooked for 8 hrs on low. Oven for 15 mins with sauce and the meat was almost falling off the bone. I will diff. make this again when ribs go on sale again. :)

Recipe was easy and turned out great! In addition to the salt and pepper I added paprika, chili powder, and cumin to my liking.  Since all slow cookers are different, 3 1/2 hours in mine was a little too long, next time I'll check them sooner. Was already using the grill so grilled them for 10-15 with the sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

Was delicious! And super easy to make. Best way to male ribs is in a slow cooker. I used Jack Daniels spicy barbecue sauce which adds a little spice for those that like spicy food

Simple recipe to follow, ribs fall off the bones moist. They were good but I think what will make them great would be a good rub. Either way this is a 5 star meal!

This is a great base recipe. I put a rub of salt, garlic power, onion powder, cumin, chili powder, pepper, paprika, and cayenne powder, and season salt. I also use beef stock as the liquid. I baste with a little of the barbecue sauce and cook on low.

Very good recipe. Followed the recipe, except that I added root beer to the slow cooker as well. After cooking,  let them cool, and put them in the refrigerator overnight. Then it was an easy matter to finish them the next day for a party. I just put them back in the slow cooker with Baby Ray's BBQ sauce - never bothered to finish them on the grill or in the oven. They were still good, although next time I will not skip the last step. Just ran out of time with a house full of people.  One note - the suggested serving means each person will get about two or three ribs - so plan accordingly if you have hungry folks.

I always try a new dish using my crock pot because it's very convenient to use and it's wonderful to come home to an aromatic house and dinner waiting at home.

I tried this tonight and it turned out better than I thought.  The meat usually turns out way too dry whenever I have made them in the crockpot (and it could be something I'm doing wrong, I don't know).  Despite my previous mishaps with any type of meat that I've made in the crockpot turning out very, very dry (albeit, falling off the bone, whether it's chicken or pork), I've never made baby back ribs so I thought I would give this a try and I'm glad I did!

I followed the directions just as it was instructed, with some additions of my own, like adding largely chopped potatoes, carrots and slices of apples.  I didn't discard the onions because they came out so tasty and tender that we ate them as part of our side dish.  The only thing that didn't taste well was our barbeque sauce.  It wasn't too sweet at all.  I'll be using a different barbeque sauce next time.  But, nonetheless, this recipe will be a keeper, for sure!  Thank you for this recipe

I rubbed the ribs with brown sugar, garlic powder, and pepper before adding to the crock pot. I also subbed Dr. Pepper for the water. Turned out great.

I pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  At 3 1/2 hours on high with the slow cooker, I needed to run an errand.  Not wanting the ribs to cook another hour on high, I turned it down to low.  I could see they were done at that point, and fall off the bone tender.  They cooked another 90 minutes or so on low, then I finished them in the oven as instructed. They were perfect, so good and so easy!  I've never made ribs before and these were the highlight of my 4th of july dinner.  Better than the king crab legs.  I had found a 3 minute video on you tube showing how to trim them, that helped.  I will definitely make these again, so delicious and what could be easier.

Great recipe made the same alterations as most. Used beer instead of water, marinated the ribs overnight with spice rub, Worcestershire and soy sauce. Cooked in the slow cooker on high for 3hrs then put the bbq sauce on the ribs and ran them under the broiler for 15mins on each side!

Great recipe.  Basically copied everything but did add some extra garlic and some garlic powder along with the salt and pepper.  These are probably the best ribs I have had which is pretty awesome considering they were done in slow cooker.  Thanks a lot.

Made this with no changes or substitutions other than omitting the onions because my husband hates them. The end result was spectacular. I am very picky about ribs and I inhaled these, as did my husband. Very flavourful and quite literally fall-off-the-bone. So easy it's ridiculous. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made these as directed with the exception of using beer instead of water. I put them in the crock pot for 7 1/2 hours on low and the ribs were so overcooked I couldn't finish baking them in the oven. Instead I broiled them for just a few minutes with the bbq sauce. The flavor was nice, but this isn't a crock pot meal you can put on and forget until you get home from work.

These were amazing!  We bought ribs that already had a dry rub on them so we didn't add anything.  We used a cup of Coke Zero and cooked on high 3.5 hours.  They were really tender and only one fell off the bone.  They would have been great just like that but we put them on a baking pan, brushed with BBQ sauce and baked per the instructions - these were AMAZING!!!!

I read a lot of reviews before trying these today. The only other time I tried ribs in the slow cooker they fell off the bone which was not what I was going for.  I put a rub on the ribs last night. I used the rub on this site. I used chicken broth instead of water and added the tbsp of liquid smoke. I cooked them on high for 3:45 minutes. Put BBQ sauce on them and baked at 375* for 15 minutes. Turned up to broil for another 7 minutes. These were superb and I will always make ribs this way with the exception of finishing them. Winter I'll use the oven and in the summer I'll use the grill. Thanks!

I made these tonight for dinner.  The recipe was simple to make and the ribs were tender but the flavor was really lacking. I might make them again sometime but I think they you need to start with a rub or marinade them the night before like another reviewer mentioned to give them some flavor. I really don't understand how or why this recipe has such a high rating.

I made these last night and they were very good.  I peeled the membrane off the back of the baby backs and covered them with rub, wrapped them in plastic wrap and put them in the fridge over night.  I was planning on smoking them on the grill but didn't get to it in time so I looked up a crock pot recipe and found this one.  Cooked them for 3 1/2 hours on high.  Delicious.

Awesome recipe - I made a change though. I cut up the ribs and put everything into the crock pot and cooked on high for the 4 hours. Then transfer to cookie sheet and put under the broiler until crisp to your liking. The ribs were falling off the bone and the meat was well marinated.

I found this recipe after I realized my poor grill was broken.  I'd bought a rack and needed to cook it.  I definitely wasn't disappointed,  hubby was licking his fingers.  I used a BBQ rub instead of salt and pepper,  otherwise I made the recipe exact.  I might try a little dash of liquid smoke since I did miss the smokiness, but still best crock pot rib recipe I've found .

Very Moist. I took Norah's advice and used a dry rub of onion, garlic powder and brown sugar. I also used beer for the liquid in the slow cooker (wine would also be good). I used more garlic and onion and added more vegetables. Then spooned it over the ribs when putting them in the oven. 6 hours on low in the crock pot would probably be enough. Delicious and moist.

Delicious and as close to BBQ as you could get...just topped it with a few pats of butter to get the flavor of the onions and garlic to the lower ribs :)

I had 4 lbs and they cooked fine in 4 hrs. Falling off the rib done.  Did not use the whole bottle of BBQ sauce just brushed with sauce and baked and then served sauce on side.

I use Texas Ranch Rub on the ribs before adding them to the slow cooker, then pour in half a beer instead of the water. They come out fantastic!

This is the easiest and most wonderful recipe for ribs.  I made them with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and served them with risotto and steamed broccoli.  Thanks for sharing this simple and comforting recipe!

Tasty, terrific, and best of all SIMPLE to make! I follow the original recipe, with one minor change, which was a happy mistake on my part. When I first made these, I thought it said one clove of garlic, per piece of meat, so that's what I did! Using a garlic press, I mince one clove per section, and rub it in. Delicious!!

Fast and easy, delicious!!! I did your edited recipe a few comments down with the Pepsi and liquid smoke ideas, it was so tender and tasted great. FYI, if not using a crock pot brand cooker, low setting = 200° ,high=300° . Mine is in degrees. I will make these again and again.

I omitted the onion and garlic because I didn't have any. I made a dry rub with misc. spices, followed the directions. Amazing. Perfect times and prep instructions. Thank you.

I have a recipe similar to this but instead of using water, I use apple juice concentrate, the frozen kind, along with a little water added to cover the meat entirely.  I also rub the ribs liberally with pork rub and make sure to remove the membrane from the bone side of the ribs.  Also, before finishing them in the oven I pull the bones out of the meat so you are left with completely boneless ribs ready to be eaten with little or no mess.  I finish with a spicy barbecue sauce so the sweetness of the apple juice is a nice contrast.  Very good overall.  Instead of apple juice concentrate I have experimented with jams and jellies as well.  Plum jelly mixed with water is a great flavor for ribs.

I modified the recipe and added tomatoes and other seasoning to the slow cooker. I then used the broth for a rice dish while the ribs finished in the oven.

Awesome! Never thought slow cooker ribs would turn out as tender.  The extra step to put them in the oven is key!  They are fall of the bone and so yummy! This is definitely one of the best recipes! Must pass on...

Absolutely loved this Recipe & the Gravy, very simple and tasted oh So Good, BUT, instead add 1 ½ cups of water and once it’s all done add a little milk and flower until thick and it made THE BEST Gravy I’ve ever had in my entire life, no joke. So this recipe made ribs and gravy for my mash potato side.

I am an avid griller/smoker and was very skeptical of this recipe. Even when taking them out after the 4 hours on high they had a broiled kinda look to them that was not all that appetizing. They ended up turning out wonderful! I followed what another reviewer suggested and substituted beer in place of water and added smoked paprika. My kids inhaled these and they really were on par with ribs I would put in my smoker or on the grill. Thanks so much...this was an awesome recipe. I especially love it since we were able to have ribs on a rainy day :)This will move to near the top of my "keepers list".

Yes I tried them several times. Ever body gobbles them down, we use Stickey Fingers sauce and they are the best yet. Forget going to rib cook off's.  Wish there were 10 stars..

Have tried this recipe couple times. Substituted beer for water and added more garlic. Also used country style ribs same way. Scrumptious each time.

Wow - very good and a lot easier than grilling ribs.  I have made ribs every which way - including broiling them first before putting them in a crockpot. That comes out great but is a little harder to do when you're rushing off to work.  I like how the BBQ sauce gets  cooked on at the end.  Next time, I will try what one other review did, after cooking it for a bit, add another layer and cook another 10 minutes or so for added crust look and flavor.  Great simple recipe!

Excellent easy fall off the bone ribs. I finish them on the grill as opposed to the oven. Because they are braised they are much more filling than bbq. But i still had 4 ribs, 1000 calories. Yikes!

This recipe is amazing and simple! It will become a staple in my book.  Like some of the other reviewers I added paprika and brown sugar to the rub.  I also used half a bottle of beer instead of the water. I used a spicy barbecue sauce for the final step.  The ribs turned out delicious.

I just made this for dinner tonight. I did two things different. First, I used 1/4 cup of beef broth and 1/4 cup of beer (dark ale). Second, I rubbed a dry BBQ rub (a recipe I found on allrecipes as well) on the meat. It turned out really good. Next time I will let the meat marinate in the dry rub over night and add liquid smoke. Overall, a very easy and tasty recipe.

I love this recipe. They were tender and Here are my notes:
--I totally agree with marinating them overnight. I used Worcestershire, soy sauce (low sodium), minced garlic, pepper, and smoked paprika. I would have added some of the other things folks posted, but didn't have them all. 
--I cooked them in the crock pot for 3 hr. 50 minutes (on high). Shortening it under four hours does seem to keep the meat on the bone, but still tender.
--Fifteen minutes in the oven is perfect. 
--I used a rub on the ribs and let them sit for about 15 minutes while the oven pre-heated. 
--I reserved some of the bar-b-q sauce from the bottle and heated it to serve on the side with the ribs. 
--I served them with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Really good recipe. I seasoned mine with salt, pepper, garlic power and topped it with some Mild Jerk seasoning by Grace. I cooked them on high for about 3 hours but when I went to transfer them to the oven, my meat was falling off of the bone. #oops! 5 stars for taste, ease and convince.

I seasoned them with paprika, salt, and pepper and let them sit overnight.  I added a tad of liquid smoke to the broth and cooked on low for about 4 hours and then high for 2.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's regular sauce and my boyfriend said they were the best he's ever had!!

One word "Amazeing". I am a college student so my roommate and myself are always looking for and trying new recipe that are quick and easy or can cook in the crackpot while we are gone at school and work. This came out so good! we cooked it on low for 8 hrs. I wish I would have marinated but I know that for next time. I like spicy food so I added some of Noodles Smolder from Boulder seasoning while cooking and some before applying the BBQ sauce.

Usually make my own BBQ Sauce. Didn't have the time today ... used a bottle of Yuengling Traditional Lager BBQ Sauce.  Amazing! I don't see taking the time to make ribs the grilling way again.  This is so easy and very, very finger lickin' good!

I tried this for the first time today while I was away at a football game. I cooked it on low for 8 hours and came home and the ribs way over cooked and fell apart......I don't think that my crock pot cooks
high. I used apple juice instead of water. I will try again for a shorter period of time...

Really easy recipe that was delicious.  The great reviews posted helped to make it my own.  I think it would be hard to mess up.  I will definitely make it again.  Cooked it on low over 7 hours.  Baking it at 375 really adds a nice touch to it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Seriously easy - and they really were fall-off-the-bone delicious.  I like that you can either follow the recipe for the BBQ sauce or use your own favorite. These were great!

This recipe was SO easy and tasty.  Instead of discarding the broth and onions after I removed the ribs from the crockpot, I added some flour and cooked 5-10 min. in crockpot.  It made a fabulous gravy.

This turned out perfectly and I added some paprika and rubbed minced garlic all over the ribs before putting it in the slow cooker. It's actually good even without the BBQ sauce if you don't like things too sweet.

I cut a rack into thirds, rub each with Montreal steak seasoning and brush w/ a teeny bit of BBQ sauce. Put in slow cooker on low for 6-8 hours.  Remove and put on baking sheet slathered with BBQ sauce at 450-degrees for 30 minutes. Change to broil for 5 minutes and serve with baked potatoes I have cooked in my other show cooker on low for 4 hours.

These were great.  Every body gets home at different times so I refrigerated them once out of the slow cooker and extended the time in the oven by 15 min.  Turned out great, not a left over.

If you want more flavor when slow cooking I would add a cinnamon stick, bay leaf, black peppercorns and a couple of star anise. I make my own Chinese style BBQ Sauce. If anyone wants that recipe let me know.

I really wanted to like this recipe because it is so easy. They were not crispy --- skin was leathery in texture.  Next time, I'll try the grill.

This is a keeper. I switched out the H2O for APPLE JUICE.  Doubled the garlic & onion. I use a Lodge chicken fryer on my AlClad induction plate. Slow cooked for 4 hrs. Then, dried the ribs with paper towels, coated with my rib rub and a small quantity of BBQ sauce. The meat fell off the bone, served with my Boston baked beans and slaw.

Delicious! I used a combination of the review advice. Rubbed with garlic powder, salt & pepper and splashed with Worcestershire. For sauce, I used Cattleboyz BBQ sauce, small can of Coke, tripled garlic & added some more Worcestershire & Tabasco. Served with new baby potatoes & sauce on the side. Will definitely make again. Thx everyone!!

I fixed this pretty much as the recipe called for.  My husband was skeptical to start, but when all was said and done, between him and 2 stepsons, there were no leftovers.  Will use this recipe from now on.  I used a beef broth and  a garlic and my own spicy rub.  Just nummy.  Also cooked in the slow cooker 3 and one half hours and about 30 minutes in the oven.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I use my crockpot all the time and to cook something as good as ribs (on the bone) was great. I used pork ribs and like many others, along with seasoning it overnight, I used a can of chicken broth. Being that i was at work they were falling off the bone, WHICH WAS NO PROBLEM! :) but next time i will cook them a little less time. I put them under the broiler for abt 6 mins ... Didnt even get a chance to take a picture for yall!! :) Loved it

I like slow cooker ribs. I usually add my barbecue sauce to the pot. When done I baste with my favorite sauce (Zea's Asian rib sauce) and put under the broiler for 5 minutes. Everyone raves over them. Thanks, Norah.

Loved this and it was so easy to do. I added water because I had six half slabs. Next time I will marinate the meat to give it a flavor. Ribs are now in oven with homemade sauce from here: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Big-Als-KC-Bar-B-Q-Sauce/?prop31=2

Up to 4 hrs on high.  Followed my notes except used water.  Certainly try the beer or cola.

These were so easy and very good.  I made this recipe with meaty pork loin ribs.  Next time I will use the baby backs as called for.

Nothing beats slow smoked ribs, but for easy, this one takes the ribbon. The only thing I do different is finish them on the grill instead of in the oven. DH hates BBQ sauce, so I get it all, and even tho he's not a big rib lover, he takes seconds on this! Thank you, norah!!

I followed the directions somewhat skeptically and was really impressed with the results.  I thought it was at least as good as our usual grilled ribs and a lot simpler than monitoring a long slow grill for a couple hours.  I will be using this one a gain a lot!

This was an awesome recipe!!!!  It was easy to follow and made my fear of making ribs disappear.  My husband LOVED them and call this his "meat candy".  One of my all time favorite meals to make.  Thanks!
