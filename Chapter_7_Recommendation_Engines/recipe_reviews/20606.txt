5 Star Plus - I am switching my allegience from the Chicken a la King I recipe (on this site) to this Chicken a la King III.  I've used the other recipe often and loved it as long as you added sherry which was missing from the ingredients.  I saw this last night and decided to try it.  This is now the one I will make - the ingredients are all on the mark - I just added  two minced scallions and a pinch of thyme and cayenne pepper which it didn't need but that I like.  Both are 5 star but we prefer this one now.

Did make some changes.  Used a chopped shallot and minced garlic to saute with mushrooms, 1/2 cup carrots and 1/2 cup frozen peas. I used white wine instead of sherry and added about 1/4  tsp. dried thyme.  Turned out great, lots of flavour. Will make again for sure.

For luv2cook, who hates to waste the egg whites:  those egg whites can be saved in a little bowl or zip lock bag, and used the next day to make a heart healthy omlette.  I was surprised when I tried this type of omlette- very tasty!  Enjoy your a la king without guilt!  :D

Good basic recipe.  I followed other's advice and added garlic powder and chili powder to the cream mixture and worsterschire sauce to the chicken broth.  I will though, next time use only 1/2 cup of broth and 1/2 the amount of flour and 1/2 cup of sour cream and only 1 egg yolk.  Even though I added an extra bell pepper and an onion, the dish was drowning in sauce.  Very good though.

This is the best chicken a la king recipe that I've fixed and I've tried quite a few over the years.  I did it a little different.  I used whole chicken breasts and browned them first in my pressure cooker in some vegetable oil.  Then I added about 2 cups of water and cooked them in the pressure cooker for about 40 minutes and then took the meat off the bones and proceeded with following the recipe.  I had it with some biscuits and corn.  Yum!

What a fabulous recipe! It is so easy to make, yet it seems so indulgent. I added half an onion and a couple of cloves of garlic, and like other reviewers, I served it over puff pastry. I don't think it is bland at all, it's delicious!

Made this last night for Husband and daughters lunch today. Taste test was excellent. I always read the reviews and so because some said it was a tad bland I used Roasted Veggie Chicken broth and added some thyme and Herbs de provence. Thank you again for a good recipe. I served it with Buttered Noodles on the side.

I made this for dinner tonight and after reading all of the reviews, I did add garlic, onions, celery, carrot and peas which made this extremely awesome. Served over buttermilk biscuits. I also added garlic salt, thyme and lots of pepper while making the sauce. My husband said his mouth is still dancing with flavor. (Mine too). Whoever said this recipe was bland, needs to read the reviews to add more character to the recipe. Loved it!!!!

Very good!  I did a LOT of variation here.  I used a red bell pepper instead of green, and I also added diced snap pea pods.  I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh and turkey instead of chicken.  I did not add the egg yolks, but a bit more fat free sour cream and broth to keep it creamy.  No pimentos either, just didn't have any on hand.  I used cornstarch to thicken instead of flour.  Instead of serving this over noodles or rice, I made mini phyllo pies.  It worked really well!  Use 2-3 phyllo sheets, each lightly buttered/oiled.  Stack and fold the phyllo so it lines a mini pie tin (oiled) and hangs over the edges.  Fill with the a la king and fold the phyllo over the top.  Bake at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes.  Hubby LOVED it and actually called it "hearty."

MMMMMM Gooood.  Easy and deliscious.  Fat free sour cream made it otherwise healthier...it was "light" for sure, if concerned about that.  I used Cremini and Shitake mushrooms (Portabella would be good too), sweet onion and a little more of the fluids and flour for more sauce.  It went very well with whole wheat blend flat noodles. I will fix this again soon. Two digits up...THUMBS that is.

I liked this a lot. Quite easy to make and it smells delish while cooking. Didn't have cooking sherry on hand, so I used regular cooking wine and it still came out good. Next time I will use the sherry. Thanks for sharing.

This was delish.  Very yummy, creamy sauce.  Just wondering what would happen if I skipped the egg yolks.  I hated wasting the whites, but I am not the Martha Stewart type who plans ahead and uses it to make lemon merengue or whatever.   So they went down my drain.  My favorite all purpose seasoning to use is McCormick's Season All instead of salt, pepper, and other dried spices too numerous to mention. It added the right kick to this dish.  I served this over some tube type bake and serve biscuits....you know the brand... and hubby and I liked it a lot and I will prepare it again.  Thanx Joan!

The recipe is good. I however go with the viewpoint that you never cook with wine that you would not drink, so I used real Sherry.

We thought this was good, but a little bland. We added a little bit of garlic salt to it, which helped. I served it over top steamed rice. I will definetely make this again!

Basically a good recipe, but definitely needs some additional spices to add flavor. Too bland for our family's taste.

This was excellent and easy.  I reduced calories and fat by using light sour cream and poured finished a la King over light (90 calorie) toasted English muffins.  I also added some onion and peas to bulk up the veggies.  Absolutely delicious.

This was so easy to make. I just recently started trying to make "newer" dishes to relieve my family from the every day chicken and mashed potatoes, haha. I made this last night with Risortto and it was a hit! My hubby cant wait till I make it again, he actually took my left over to work. So two thumbs up!

I made this recipe after reading other reviews, so I added garlic salt.  It was outstanding.  I served it on top of toast instead of with rice.  I will definately be adding this to my repertoire of dinner recipes.

This is by far the best Chicken a La King recipe I've ever made. What a great idea "Jzerilli" to serve this over puff pastry. I just happen to have had some in the freezer and it surely was a special treat; especially if you try to forget about the calories. This was so delicious Joan and thanks so much!

This was delicious. I made it the 1st time exactly as the recipe stated. The next time I only sauteed the pepper,mushrooms,and added the flour. Then I added the rest of the ingredients all at once. It was delicious either way.

A new favorite that even a 10 year old would want again and again.  I deleted the pepper, added yellow onion and fresh garlic ad left out the pimento.  I also made extra sauce to go over the leftovers.  This is a very nice dish!

It's good but I eliminated the eggs.  Just don't need the added cholesterol.  Not bad sort of remember it from my childhood with my Mommie Dearest making it for me and my brother.  I just bought Grands biscuits instead of making them from scratch.  Too lazy tonight.

This was good, not WOW.  I added a little fresh thyme.  Served over egg noodles.

Good basic dish but just lacking something. I was anticipating loads of flavor but was let down. I even added garlic! I feel it is more a 3 1/2 star more than a four. However, I would make again with major adjustments.

Pretty good and easy. I used store bought roasted chicken, I think that helped the blandness issue some people had. I also used frozen green peas instead of bell pepper (added in the last step). Can't say that this dish was bursting with flavor, but we liked it. I served it with biscuits, but can also be served over rice or puff pastry.

This was good, but I added a few things. I added minced garlic and thyme when I sauteed the peppers and mushrooms. After I added the chicken the mixture was still bland, so I added garlic salt and onion powder(my husband doesn't like onions so I use powder and he doesn't notice). I didn't have pimentos and it still turned out great.

Tried this tonight. Yummy, very filling. For the chicken I used fajita strips for ease and after reading the reviews about the recipe being bland. I don't like peppers and I only had 1/2 cup sour cream and substituted 1/2 buttermilk. Will be adding this to dinner rotation.

Very good recipe, even if you're not a fan of cooked peppers or of mushrooms.  We chopped everything really fine and added some corn and peas as well and the whole family liked it.

I had to give this recipe 3 stars because I felt it was just average.  We liked it but wouldn't rush to make it again.  I substituted peas for the bell peppers just due to family preference.  The sauce is, however, very versatile and you could use broccoli or pea pods too.  I also added garlic salt as others suggested and still felt it could use something else.  It definitely has potential and I will try it again and tweak the sauce a little.

Was kind of bland. The mixture was too wet when added sour cream to sauce, had to let it cook down. Served over rice, but didn't have much flavor. I'm up in the middle of the night with a stomachache!

I thought this tasted pretty good, for finding it looking for a recipe to use up some cubed chicken. My only changes were using low sodium vegetable broth, reduced fat sour cream, and 1 egg instead of 2 egg yolks. I also cooked it all for a few more minutes, on medium, to cook off any alcohol flavor. I served with some microwaved jasmine rice.

I chose this recipe because I didn't have heavy cream on hand, but did have sour cream. I was very pleased with the results; I did make some changes, though. I added garlic powder and paprika, and a small amount of seasoning for chicken. I also added about 1  and 1/2 cups of cooked, drained peas and carrots. I served the entree in puff pastry cups. I also increased the amount of wine, as I only had white wine. This will be my basic, go-to recipe for Chicken a la King. This recipe was very easy to prepare.

This was great.  Of course, I hate green peppers so I had to do my usual sugar snap pea pod substitution.   Dropped them in place with no added fuss and really enjoyed my dinner.  Thanks

This was a great way to use leftovers and overall a really good recipe.  The only complaint we had was that the first few bites were great, but then it started to get a bit boring.  That said, it's still one I'll hang on to.

We loved this dish!  Per another reviewers comments, I subbed white wine for sherry (since it was what we had on hand, and I didn't want to go to the store), and reduced fat sour cream.  We served over whole wheat angel hair pasta, and it was great!  Thanks!

We thought this was very good, served over rice. In spite of a few minor changes, I pretty much stuck to the recipe. I sauteed onion & garlic since I didn't have any bell pepper or mushrooms, I left out the egg yolks--it was plenty rich anyway--and I added the pimento from a jar. The sherry addition was a perfect touch.

Didn't have the pimento, but I don't think that it would have improved the taste of this average meal. It wasn't bad, wasn't great - even added garlic, celery & green onions, thyme to the mushrooms as others have suggested. I served over biscuits - will not make again...BLAH! Sorry...

I substituted celery for the green pepper (family preference) and added onions. I also sprinkled in some paprika. Everyone loved it - sure made a quite weeknight meal. Next time I'll add minced garlic too.

Since I don't care for green pepper, I substituted sliced green olives for the pepper and pimiento and we loved it!

It's a good basic recipe but it is definitely missing a seasoning or two. I will probably make this again and use something like Lawry's just to give it the salt it lacked and a little extra kick.

This is simular to a Chicken al la King recipe that I received from my mother inlaw. Great recipe. I serve mine over a bed of rice with garlic rolls on the side. Thanks Joan :>)

One of my favorite meals however had never tried to make it myself.  Took others suggestions and added thyme and cayenne, and served on puffed pastries.  Was easy and so delicious.  Will be making this again and again per the families request.  Thank you!!

Words cannot describe how delicious this was. Of course I had to double the ingredients to make enough for the family. Although I had to omit the bell pepper and pimento and opted to put in Cream of Chicken, Peas, White Cooking Wine instead. Once I had it cooking I realized that it needed more flavor so I added a House spice blend and Misses Dash Table Blend which finally gave it the flavor of a Chicken Pot Pie.  My family enjoyed this and there's no doubt that I will make this again!

This is a very good base, we don't like mushrooms so I used one green, one red pepper and half an onion, It was quite bland when it was done so I added onion salt, garlic powder, seasoning salt and a bit of cayenne pepper. The result was delicious!! Served over biscuits with broccoli - will definitely make again

This was pretty good.  Used green beans, corn, onions, celery instead of the bell peppers or peas. Sauce could have used more flavor. Don't think the  pimentos added anything - just a nuisance since now  I have a little jar in the fridge I don't know what to do with.

Where are the peas?! Started with a sauté of celery, minced onion and garlic. Added frozen peas during the last few minutes of cooking. Also added a dash of thyme. Used pressure-cooked, shredded chicken. Skipped pimento because I not have it . Served over rice. Will make again!

This was awful-almost a one star (couldn't eat it) overpowering sour under taste from the sour cream maybe? I used less than half the recommended amount and added some sugar to counteract which helped a little-I added the garlic and onion as some others recommended and added some chicken bouillon to try and correct for the sour taste but to no avail.  I really wanted this to be good because we love chicken ala king and haven't found a good recipe. Guess I will keep looking...

This was awesome. Easy to make and so incredibly delicious. I had to substitute the sherry for port, the sour cream for non-fat greek yogurt, and I eliminated one egg yolk. All these changes were because I used what I had. My husband who typically won't eat chicken raved about it. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't have bell pepper or pimento and I did add onion and garlic, otherwise I made as directed. It was really good! Next time I will double the sauce. I served it over egg noodles.

It was great! My hubby gobbled it up. I used the leftover meat from a roasted chicken. My family doesn't do mushrooms so I finely diced half of a sweet onion and sautéed it in the butter. I used some homemade chicken broth then added the chicken and a bag of frozen mixed veggies. The sauce was tasty and creamy. I served it over Pillsbury Flaky layers biscuts. This is a keeper and will be added to the rotation.

I've tried different Chicken a la King recipes and still haven't found one that I like.  To this recipe I added onion, garlic, and thyme and I still thought that there wasn't much flavor; it was just OK.  I won't make this again, sorry.

Excellent, particularly with a few more spices, onion etc. as suggested by others, and in puff pastry also as suggested.

Maybe I did something wrong, but it just wasn't very flavorful.
