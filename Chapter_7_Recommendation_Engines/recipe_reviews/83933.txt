I used all of the ingredients listed (except i used 1 minced garlic clove instead of the garlic powder) but followed a different prep method. First, I used frozen peeled and deveined shrimp, so I didn't need to boil them first and then peel them. So, with that in mind I sauteed the onion (red onion) in olive oil till soft, then added garlic. I added the crushed tomatoes and parsley, and let it simmer on high until most all the liquid had evaporated. I then added the raw, defrosted shrimp and cooked them for 3 mins in the tomato sauce. I then added a cup of white wine. This is where I would alter the recipe - 1 cup is too much liquid to add at this point, as while the end result was tasty, it was too watery - this dish shouldn't be soupy, and with 1 cup of wine added that was the consistency I got. So after adding the wine and letting it simmer for a minute, I added the feta and transferred the skillet to an oven preheated to 400F. I cooked the dish for a further 5 to 7 mins, till bubbly and the feta slightly browned on top.

All in all the taste was delicious, but next time I will just start with 1/2 cup of wine and add more if necessary. Served with crusty bread it made a great supper and was surprisingly easy to make! I am also thinking of using a few shots of ouzo next time instead of the wine. NOTE: I did not add any stock as the recipe calls for and I agree with the previous reviewer that one shouldn't add it otherwise this recipe would be for soup!!!!!

I'd definitely reduce the "2 inches of water "- if I'd added the entire amount of shrimp stock, I'd have had soup. I only used a portion of the stock, then added 1 1/2 Tbsp. of cornstarch to thicken up a bit. Most of the flavour came from the feta cheese . The next time I'd add chopped kalameta olives along with some greek seasoning and fresh chopped  tomatoes.   Recipe does have great potential.

this was very good, fast to make.  I made a slight adjustment since I was out of metaxa so I replaced it with a TBL of ouzo which worked well, I thought.  I served it with olive oil, lemon juice and oregeno potatoes

This is a wonderful dish!  So simple to make but elegent in appearance!  Can be served over Rice or Orzo as a warm meal on a cold winter here in New York!  We also add some olives to keep the authentic greek tasting meal!

This was really good. I didn't add the stock back in though, and I used fresh garlic. This recipe is a staple for us.

I think this recipe was awesome. I just didn't add all the feta cheese since I wanted to taste more the shrimp . I cooked it with some other Greek recipes and it was a hit w my family. Also I didn't pre boil the shrimp, the shrimp I bought were already cleaned and I didn't  have to do any of that . I just cook the shrimp directly in the sauce . Not for too long since shrimp cannot be overcooked.

This was fantastic! I used 1/2 cup wine, added chopped olives at the end with the feta and served over rice. I also used frozen large shrimp and did not have to de-head them...Lovely. I would make this again.

Simple to prep and delicious. I added some kalamata olives for color and mainly because we love them. I followed the crowd and went with 1\2 cup of wine and served on a bed of whole wheat spaghetti. Nice and thick sauce. Definitely making this again.

I have been eating this dish for years under the pseudonym "shrimp Aegean ". My in laws make it sometimes for a special meal, and it is served over pasta, usually capellini or spaghetti. It is best with homegrown tomatoes!

Absolutely delicious. I added fresh cut garlic cloves, used real Greek feta and put it under the broiler for a few minutes.
