This review is for the shortcake only as I did not use the fruit suggested with this recipe.  The shortcake comes together very quickly and easily.  It bakes up great with a nice crispness to the outside of the dough.  We felt it is wonderful the night it is baked, and ok the following night.  We had a alot of strawberries to use, so I made a full recipe.  I would make them again with the intentions of eating them all the night they are baked or down sizing the recipe for the number of shortcakes needed.

This is a very nice recipe. One can not substitute vinegar and milk for buttermilk and expect the same results. To review the recipe one should make the recipe as it is written. With buttermilk, the batter is not runny at all.

I made the shortcakes to serve with strawberries and Cool Whip and was disappointed in how the shortcakes came out.  I modified the recipe slightly (1 1/2 tsp vinegar + 1% milk in lieu of buttermilk and a little bit of half-and-half plus some 1% milk in lieu of 2% milk) but I don't think the modifications were responsible for the problem.  The recipe says to roll or pat the dough into rounds but mine was a very runny batter.  I put globs of batter on a cookie sheet and baked it anyway.  The baking time was correct but the shortcakes came out as flat disks.  They tasted okay but didn't have the look I was going for.

My review is only for the shortcake, which came out extremely well.  The less you handle the dough the better, otherwise it loses its elasticity.  I think in future though I'd probably do an 8 serving recipe to make six cakes as the cakes seemed a bit small.  But so tasty!
