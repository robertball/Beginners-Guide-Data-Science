As odd as this combination seems it comes out tasting pretty good. (I've only had it with the cheese once since I have chosen to leave it out) I like to make it without the cheese and using pineapple tidbits or crushed pineapple and use it to top a pineapple coconut cheesecake recipe I have or I make a trifle with this cake chunks and whipped cream.

I've made this recipe in the past from my mother in law's recipe there is no egg in it and doesn't need to be. Also she used cornstarch not flour. I do add the mini marshmallows.

I make this every year. I use 20 oz can of crushed pineapples I strain ALL the juice set the crushed pineapples aside in a bowl bring it to a boil turn heat down to med high stirring constantly I add 1 cup of sugar 3 tlbs of flower 1 egg and slowly stir in 1 lb of Velveeta cheese. once the cheese is completely melted and the sauce is thick I pour everything in the bowl with the crushed pineapples mix well let cool. Add mini marshmallows and a few cherries for add color ( optional ) and enjoy??. I have tried it the other way but my family isn't a big fan of getting a mouth full of cheese and I have found that a lot of the Times when I get canned pineapple chunks they are usually hard at the ends.
