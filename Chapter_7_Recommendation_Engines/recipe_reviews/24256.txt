People can't get enough of this salad. No matter how much we make, people finish it off. With no fresh cranberries, we use dried. We also add a good splash of white wine vinegar for a litle pizzazz. Make sure the cabbage is just one of the ingredients, not a major player.

This was a delicious change to coleslaw or cabbage salad.  I used dried orange-flavoured cranberries instead of the sugared cranberries and I think it worked well.  I think I will use canned drained mandarin oranges next time.  I made this for a Mother's Day supper and everyone loved it!

Zing! I made this for a Christmas potluck dinner last night. Came home with an empty bowl. The cranberries really liven up the cole slaw while the apples balance out their tartness. It's a winner!

My daughter-in-law suggested a salad with cranberries for Christmas dinner. So, I tried this  one and it was great.  Following a review, I did add about 2 tlb of cider vinegar and used a very small red onion.

This is delicious and has become a favorite with family and friends.  I use dried cranberries that I rough chop, because I usually have these on hand.  I also reduced the amount of red onion to about 1/4 onion (which I mince) and add an extra apple.

Yummy!  I halved this recipe and didn't cut the cranberries in half.  I did add the sugar and let the cranberries marinate all day.  The sugar from the cranberries and the mayonnaise made a very nice dressing for this coleslaw.  My husband really enjoyed this and asked for the leftovers for his lunch.  This was served with 'Donair' from AR and we enjoyed a terrific meal.  Thanks WINNIFRED for sharing your recipe.  I look forward to making it again.  I'm glad I have multiple bags of cranberries in our freezer! :o)

I cut back on the onion, used dried cranberries, and added some chopped walnuts. My family and guests loved it!

I didn't care for the onion flavor mixing with the fruit, but I got used to it!  This is a colorful salad!

I did not care for the onion and will use shredded carrots next time - otherwise very good.

This was very yummy, good use of fruits! I used a  purple onion and I think it may be too powerful for some. Other than that, tastes great! I also like that it didn't use a lot of mayo.

I used mandarin oranges instead of cutting a fresh orange, but it was a nice refreshing dish.  If you like coleslaw, you should give this dish a try.

I made this salad for Christmas dinner and was a bit disappointed. Did not have any compliments or comments from anyone. I don't think I will make it again.
