This recipe turned out a wonderful meal.  The meat and potatoes were flavored nicely, lots of garlic and I really liked the taste of the lemon with the beef.  (In fact I added extra lemon peel).  Easy to prepare.  The only thing I changed was to add some rosemary to the rub.

Though I thought that this was a good dish, it was lacking in flavor.  Perhaps I should try stuffing it with garlic?  I will definitely make this again!  Love the potatoes!

Take it from the world's worst cook (trust me)- this is a great and fool-proof recipe.  I cooked it for my 21 year old son while he was visiting over Christmas.  He is one of the "pickiest" eaters I know, but I thought that living on his own for a couple of years might make him appreciate home cooking.  Not only did he eat this recipe - but he went back for seconds and thirds!  He couldn't stop raving about it.  I managed to get a little bit myself (even though I had to fight him for it), and have to admit that I surprised myself at making something so good that turned out so well.  Try this recipe!
