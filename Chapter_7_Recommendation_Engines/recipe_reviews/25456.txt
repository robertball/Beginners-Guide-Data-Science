My husband and I like a lot of spice and these were too bland for us.  The initial attempt required lots of added salt and pepper for extra flavor and the chicken broth/Worcestershire added almost no flavor.  The second time I made them, I coated the slices in a big bowl with salt, pepper, italian seasoning, about 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes and some olive oil.  Tossed to coat, placed potatoes on foil, didn't bother with onions, put slices of butter on top, sprinkled with plain shredded cheese and grilled.  They were incredible and much easier than the original recipe.  No matter how you cook them, you absolutely MUST spray your foil with a cooking spray or you will have a burnt, stuck-on mess!

Try making individual packages,with about half a medium potato each, sliced, and follow the recipe; leave the cheese out and cook as directed (I always omit the broth, add lots of butter, use double foil wrap and make sure itÂ´s well sealed)When they are almost done, open package neatly making a "bowl" with the foil and add cheese, wait until cheese melts. I always serve it with the foil directly on the individual plate, with a rib eye steak and a skewer of shrimps. It looks award winning, and tastes even better.

The worchestershire sauce in these adds a nice little touch I have not experienced in grilled potatoes before.  I really liked it.  Our grilled ran out of gas, so I had to cook these in the oven, I baked at 400 for 45 minutes and then had to microwave for another 10 because they weren't quite done.  I will make again, they were very tasty.

These were very good.  I used swiss cheese instead of cheddar, just because that is what I had on hand, and I reduced the amount of butter to 2 T, since the cheese and broth were really sufficent to cook and flavor the potatoes.  Very easy, very good recipe.  Thanks!

This concept is great.  When i made these for the first time i added a some fresh garlic, fresh chives and fresh rosemary.  Definately pepped up the flavor of the dish. I had problems with sticking to the foil and i didn't use anything like pam.  I did keep turning the packet on the fire.  Great recipe thanks.

Very good side dish for any BBQ dinner.  I put mine in a BBQ foil bag and set it on the BBQ for about 40 min and it was done.  Very easy.

This was easy to make, but lacked flavor. I usually grill my potatoes this way, but without the cheese.  It would be much easier to just sprinkle the grated cheese over the potatoes after they are done. No burnt cheese!

These were terrific. I took some of the advice listed and sprayed the foil with Pam. I also added some fresh cilantro along with the parsley. Very tasty. Great with barbecued chicken. We loved it and will make again.

The only problem I had was the bottom potatoes stuck to the tinfoil. Next time I will spray the tinfoil with pam and flip the potatoes regularly.
besides that it was a great recipe. Thanks!

Very good.  Next time, I will definitely use pam.  The entire bottom layer was stuck to the foil.  Might try a big more cheese next time.  My kids loved them too.  Overall, very tasty.

This recipe is fantastic.  I made them on a camping trip and they were a hit.  I sprayed the aluminum foil with Pam as someone had mentioned the potatoes stick.  I used a lot more cheese than the recipe called for.  I made two batches and used 2 cups of cheese.

I cannot fairly rate this recipe, as I saw another reviewer used an oven to cook these, and I tried it that way, too.  I wish the person would've said how long and what temp they cooked them.  I did mine at 450 for 45 mins, and they still weren't done.  I don't have a grill, as I live on the 3rd floor with no balcony, but these sounded so good!  I ended up dumping them in a frying pan, and they still ended up pretty good.  I'm going camping in August, and have every intention of making these over a campfire! I can't wait, because I really think these potatoes have potential.  Thanks for sharing!

Tried these on a camping trip this weekend. They turned out great. I scaled down the recipe by 1/2. I think the idea of using a foil bag would be easier, I had a bit of leakage with regular foil. The idea of making individual packets is great too! A little easier to handle that way. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

These were pretty good!  Because I made them in the middle of January, I didn't do them on a campfire or BBQ, but in the oven.  Turned out really well!  Like scalloped potatoes but with a little added zing!  I'll make them again - maybe even over a campfire!

Sorry but these were not for me considering all the work and ingredients that went into these. I will stick with my usual season all, butter and parsley. Family prefers that way.

These were good, though I miscalulated my time and had to finish them up in the microwave so they'd be done with the steaks!  Nice flavor to them.

I also reduced the butter. Replaced the broth with white wine, as its a lot easier to use up leftover wine than leftover broth when camping, and traded out the parsley for a combination of fresh tarragon and chives from my garden. YUM!  Leftovers made for great breakfast burritos the next day - sauteed the poataoes so they got a good crust and added eggs, bacon and salsa.

We all enjoyed these very much. My whole family requested that we have these again "very soon". Easy to cook. Make sure you put plenty of chicken broth in the foil pack though, it could burn very easily.

I thought this recipe was lacking in flavor, I added more cheese than called for as someone suggested but it didn't help much. It smelled really good while it was on the grill, but it's flavor just didn't match. I don't think I will be making this again unless I doctor it up a bit, however the concept on the grill was really a neat approach.

Excellent flavor.  Next time, I'll flip the packets more frequently as the food stuck to the foil and burned a bit.  The cheese could be doubled and added after cooking for additional burn prevention as well as extra gooiness.  Is that a word?

I was assembling this recipe and when it came to the 1/3 cup of broth.. I was afraid that I would have mashed potato's so I put 2 tablespoons and they were perfect! I also added cheese at the end for glamour!

We make these potatoes often using Reynolds Release non-stick foil, and they never stick! This recipe is very close to my own recipe. I use lots of spices, such as: garlic, dill, black pepper, seasoned salt, and paprika. I have never used the chicken broth, but look forward to trying it soon.

I think this was a good recipe, but they were a little bland. I tried them for the first time last night, and they were o.k. You do get the taste of the worstershire sauce and alot of the onion flavor but it really lacked salt or a little something extra. I think if i try this again i might just go with different seasonings, but stick with the chicken broth and maybe do half an onion. But if you are an onion lover for for a whole onion!

We thought these were ok - nothing spectacular though.  I didn't use as much butter as recommended, and I used more onion and Worcestershire sauce.  We both felt that the cheese added nothing to the dish (apart from extra calories!).  I make a similar dish that we prefer - so I probably won't make this again.

I usually like to grill my potatoes... this was a nice change.  The worcestershire sauce gave it a nice flavor.

These were very good.  I made them for an outdoor party and they were all eaten up immediately.  I'm definitely making them again.

WOW-WOW-WOW!!! So simple and what  a fantastic recipe. My family loved it and it definately will become a favorite in my recipe box.  I added some extra Veggie seasoning and cooked on a low-medium heat for 40 minutes while cooking a top-rack pork roast on my grill. The worchestershire sauce adds the perfect flavoring and the chicken broth makes for a delicately steamed creation. Yum!!! Can't wait to make this again.

I really like the idea of these - but the recipe didn't work out for me. The butter/broth/sauce all got burnt on the bottom of the foil and the whole thing had that burnt taste, and not the "good" burn taste of the grill. I only cooked it for 30 min, so it was not overcooked. I won't be making this again

Okay so I peeled/cubed the potatoes instead of slicing and I saved the cheese for the top when they were done and added as a topper along with some green onions but these were VERY tasty alongside my bacon and I recommend them to everyone. They turned out very crisp and brown like I like them and you really cannot go wrong with this recipe.

Only gave 4 because I did not follow the recipe exact. I fried some bacon and coated the potatoes with the bacon grease. I added the spices and the bacon, omitted the broth and didn't add the cheese until the end. Just served them out of the foil, so clean up was minimal. Thanks for a great and easy recipe idea.

We made this on a camping trip last year and LOVED it!!!! No dishes to wash because I cooked extra bacon at breakfast. Great flavor. Will definately be making this when we camp again. Can also be made on the grill.

These potatoes were OK, but not spectacular. I found them somewhat mushy in texture. Next time, I would probably omit the broth, and add some more herbs, like rosemary or oregano, which are both lovely with potatoes. Perhaps if they were made in the oven, with the foil open for the last 20 minutes of cooking they would be crisper.

I didn't really care for this.  There was too much Worchestire for my taste.  Perhaps cutting it back would help.  Also, the cheese was mixed with the worchestire and parsley and sprinkled on top as directed, but even after over 30 minutes, it didn't seem to melt the way you would expect it too.  Maybe I did something wrong in the prep, but it just wasn't for me.

I've been making similar recipe for years! I use 4 med. potatoes (diced), 1 med. onion chopped,10-12 baby carrots (halved) and about 1/2 stick of butter (cubed), (salt and pepper of course) I put these on the grill as soon as i light it and by the time it warms up and the meats done they're done! Then slice down center of foil pouch, place cheese of choice (i use american slices) close foil and allow steam to melt cheese, Remember to turn pouch about every 5 min. to assure even cooking and no sticking.

Weâve been doing this recipe for years, almost exactly as written and we love it. I slice both the onions and potatoes (I try various varieties of both) with a mandolin slicer so theyâre thin. Iâve also tried various cheddars and other cheeses with success. Iâve also found it better to use extra large, heavy duty foil wrap or use 2 heavy foil for ease of moving. Donât skimp on the cheese, butter or Worcestershire sauce.

Mr, LTH loved these!  I thought they were good, but they weren't my favorite.  I used one of the top reviewer's suggestions to up the flavor and skip the chicken broth (seemed like a big PITA on the grill). Our potatoes did turn fairly black on the bottom, WITH the grill on LOW heat, so I'd recommend grilling over INDIRECT heat. THANKS for the recipe, MARYANNE!

Amazing! I ususally load my potatoes, but the flavor of these was so great I didn't even salt them. I can't eat onion, so I left those out, and I didn't have parsley, but these potatoes are a tasty side to any meal.

We were going to do these on a camping trip over the open fire, but were rained out.  I did them in a 9 x 13 at 375 for about 45 minutes covered.  Then I added more cheese over the top and broiled them for a couple of minutes.  We really enjoyed the flavor of these.  They were mild, but you could really taste the individual ingredients. Super!  I would up the Wort. and maybe add some fresh garlic nest time.  The onions in the mixture were awesome, too!
