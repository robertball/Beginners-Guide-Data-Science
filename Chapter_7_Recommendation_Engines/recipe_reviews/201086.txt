Also tried it with just Russian salad dressing, onion soup mix, apricot jam, but no curry, it tasted like sweet and sour chicken!

I made significant changes, but it was such a great combination to begin with! We loved it. I used fresh strawberries instead of preserves, about 3/4 of a pint. blended them up with all the rest of the ingredients. I used Italian dressing on hand, so I used that instead of the Russian. Also, I used a whole packet of the dry onion soup mix. Also, I only used one very large chicken breast, a large red bell pepper, and some red potatoes to make it an all in one meal. It fit in a 9 x 9 and would feed 4. just cooked till the potatoes were done. oh, delicious!

Delicious! The changes I made were to use only 1 cup of Russian dressing (which is a whole small bottle of Wishbone), used the whole envelope of onion soup mix, and used about 10 chicken tenderloins without cutting them. I marinated it for about 3-4 hours and cooked for 30 min. Served over rice. This is a keeper!

This is delicious!  I do a lot of cooking, and my husband told me the first time I made this that it was the best dish I had ever made for him.  Russian dressing was hard to find, so I substituted Thousand Island.  This is going in my recipe book.

Yum, yum, yum, and yum!!  My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  Since it hadn't been reviewed yet, I made the recipe exactly as written, and we wouldn't change a thing!  And it's so quick and easy to make.  We served the chicken alongside rice and broccoli, then ended up mixing it all together, drizzled with the sauce, and it was EXCELLENT!!  I can't wait to make this one again.

I didn't use the curry powder because one member of my family is extremely sensitive to spicy. It turned out great without it.

Anything that my boys ask for seconds on gets a 5 star rating.  It was super easy to make and very tasty.  And not at all spicy.  Will be making this again.

I originally was looking for a recipe where I could use up some strawberry jam and came across this one. I made this recipe as it is written but I didnâ€™t have chicken so I used shrimp. I also added onion and bell pepper. It was so good! You can use that sauce on anything and it tastes awesome. I served it over brown rice.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but had some strawberry jam to use up....plus I like curry....so I gave it a try.  WOW!  Was this wonderful!  I had trouble finding Russian Dressing, but finally, at the the 3rd store, I found it!  Kroger carried their own brand.  This recipe was SO good!  Even the kids loved it.  We ended up scooping sauce out of the pan to put on top of our quinoa, which I had made as a side!  It makes a lot of sauce, so you could even double the chicken breasts if you like.  Amazingly good!  Will make again and again!

Took me a while to find Russian salad dressing, but finally found some at the Great Canadian Superstore.  I thought the recipe tasted great!

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used one bottle of wishbone (1 cup) russian dressing and the whole package of onion dip mix. I thought it was excellent but my hubby and company thought it was just o.k. hence the 4 stars instead of 5.
