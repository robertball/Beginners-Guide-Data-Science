I'd give 10 stars if I could! I did modify the recipe a bit though, making it more of a savory than sweet dish. I didn't have mango, so just left it out. Replaced the red onion with shallot. And cooked the shrimp in butter, garlic and a little lemon juice, leaving out the honey. Delicious!

Forget the honey  butter, saut√© the shrimp in olive oil and mix with taco seasoning, go lighter on the cilantro as others suggested, and add one half chopped red pepper! Divine!!

This is a new favorite-- really delicious.  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe except for the honey butter--  garlic and butter is just fine for the shrimp.   These are also great vegetarian (nix the shrimp and add some blackbeans and/or rice), and also as fish tacos (bake some tilapia and dust it with whatever seasonings you like).  The mango salsa is also great alone with your favorite tortilla chips.  Be careful with the cilantro-- 1/2 is a good amount as long as it doesn't get packed.  The second time I made this, the cilantro was wet and so 1/2 cup wound up being about double what I should have added-- just about ruined the whole dish.

AMAZING!!!   I ate these tacos until I was stuffed.   Seeing all the reviews where the honey butter shrimp was bland, I opted to follow the suggestion of one reviewer to saute the shrimp in olive oil mixed with a little taco seasoning.   It was awesome and so quick to prepare.   This will be in the "favorites" section of my recipe box!!

Fantastic recipe! Was a hit with the family!

Upon suggestion from other reviews, I also cut my cilantro portion in half, and was still a strong flavor in the salsa, so I would recommend the same. 

Also, took the advice of marinating in a taco/fajita seasoning instead of honey butter. It just gave it a little more zing to the shrimp, which I wanted. 

A great recipe and I suggest anyone try this at least once! Thank you for sharing!

Yum! This was excellent! I didn't have any pre-made honey butter, so I whisked a tbsp. of honey into 3 tbsp of melted butter.  I also added 1/8 tsp chipotle chili powder and 1/2 tsp Mexican oregano to the shrimp as it cooked, and I had large shrimp on hand so I used them.  Used low-carb multigrain tortillas instead of flour tortillas, too.  Delicious!

Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing.  I like the mango salsa so much I make it just to munch on with tortilla chips too.

This was a delicious change of pace from the usual tacos! After reading other comments, I opted to do away with the honey butter. While sauteing the shrimp in regular butter, I sprinkled it with cayenne pepper to add a little heat. After the shrimp was done, I drizzled a little honey over them to add a little extra sweetness. I also didn't have fresh cilantro so I used dry (1/4 of what the recipe called for. It's a strong flavor, and a little goes a long way, anyway). So yummy! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Just love making the salsa...very refreshing...but cut way back on the red onion otherwise it is too overpowering and the subtle avocado/mango flavors get lost

The salsa is so great! Ive made it several times sometimes using peaches instead of mango. You can season the shrimp any way and tacos are still delicious with this salsa. I also use corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. Definitely makes a special meal in my home!

The salsa was good in my opinion - hubbs didn't care for it. The shrimp were NOT good in my opinion - hubbs liked them. The honey butter made them smell & taste like old seafood - NOT GOOD. I wouldn't recommend these unless you seasoned the shrimp while cooking, maybe adding lime juice & salt with the seasonings. The idea is simple & I think the salsa was good enough for 3 stars, but no way is the shrimp good as-is. Not making this one again.

These were really, really good, and I didn't even have a mango.  I followed the directions for sauteing the shrimp in the honey butter, and they were very good. I was skeptical, but noticed most reviewers who did not recommend the honey butter had not appeared to actually try it. I made a simple honey butter by combining equal parts honey and softened butter.  We loved this, and adding the mango next time will be an added bonus. Thanks, abewasabe!

Amazing.  I added crumbled goat cheese and only cooked the shrimp in butter and garlic powder.  I added some taco seasoning to the shrimp as well.

In my opinion the flavors didn't compliment each other at all.  I didn't like the mango and avocado mix and I wouldn't have added so much lime juice.  I would recommend not using the honey butter because that did not give the shrimp much flavor.  My family didn't even finish their tacos :(

The flavors just clashed.  If I could do it over again, I would have added a lot less garlic and onion. I think thats why the flavors clashed so much.The mango and the onion just didn't do it for me.

Good recipe. I didn't use onions just out of preference but otherwise the avo-mango salas was great. I did flavor the shrimp with taco seasoning instead of honey butter. We had 4 people and I used a lb and half of regular sized shrimp cut in half but felt like we could have used more.

These are very good.  I cheated, and used prepared Pico de Gallo from the store, added the diced mango, lime, extra cilanto, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Great super quick meal!

Tried this recipe tonight.  I didn't have a ripce mango unfortunately so I doubled the avacado.  I also didn't have fresh cilantro so I used dried.  All else I used as defined except in my honey butter recipe I didn't use sweetened milk.  They came out very good but I would use less garlic next time (and we love garlic) and possibly less onion as well.  I will definitely try it with the mango next time and fresh cilantro.  My husband really liked them.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and the mango avocado salsa was seriously, deliciously, mouth-wateringly spectacular.  But the one disappointment was that the shrimp ended up tasting just a little bland.  I think maybe next time I'll try marinating them in some garlic butter and leave out the honey.

Wow!  These are so delicious!!!  And the salsa is to die for.  The flavors all work together so well to make an incredible taco.  Everyone will be "begging for more."

We really liked this recipe.  It was a great summer dinner for us.  I didn't add as much garlic and fried up some plain white onions instead of the red onions.  The mangos added a great flavor!  I tried this recipe with halibut (cooked in honey or maple syrup) and it turned out equally as good.

The only thing I changed was I used parsley instead of cilantro (we're not fans of cilantro).  My husband gives this a 5; me a 4.5... definitely a different flavor and it made for a fun dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow. Yum.

My husband doesn't like mango, so we left it out, but it was still delicious.

This recipe by itself is amazing! I always modify it for one reason or another (allergies, preferences, or just product availability). It always turns out great. It‚Äôs really simple, safe, easy go-to recipe, and it never fails to impress. I always get rave reviews when I make this.

This was really good, made it exactly as it was written.
Next time I will add a little hot pepper to the salsa-just needed a little bit of a kick.
The salsa was easy and healthy and fresh.
Thanks so much for the posting of the recipe!

First time 5 star; second time with a small change 7 star; good stuff. 
My mango was a little sour so I added 2 tblspns honey to it instead of the shrimp. I blackened the shrimp to cut the sweetness and this was fantastic.

I LOVED this recipe!  The only alteration I made was to omit the onions (personal preference).  The mango salsa was to die for and made this recipe absolutely delicious.

I tried this recipe last night and it was really delicious! The mango is such a nice change of pace for me and I really enjoyed the subtle sweet taste of the shrimp cooked in the honey butter. I didnt have any pre-made honey butter so I just melted some butter in the pan and used a whisk to blend in some honey. I used some of the left over mango salsa today for lunch on some tilapia and it was really really good that way too.

Made these last night just as the recipe states. Thought they were great! We loved the flavors, the salsa was so fresh and delicious. It had a Caribbean flair to it. Definately on our "keeper" list!

So amazing!  Despite never having had them before, I had a craving for shrimp tacos.  I made this recipe exactly as directed (only I added a dollop of sour cream) and they were sublime!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I should have trusted my instincts.  Honey and shrimp?  Not good.  The salsa was good, but the shrimp were strangly sweet and smelled odd.  And practically a clove of garlic per serving might have been too much.  It's a pass on this one.

Could have eaten these all day! I used plain butter (mango makes dish sweet enough) and used jumbo shrimp instead of salad shrimp. Everything else was the same. Thank you. Definitely a keeper.

So delicious! I'm a huge fan of garlic, but I might scale back on it to bring out the sweet in the salsa rather than savory.  Just my preference.   Love the salsa just with chips too!

Salad shrimp?
Yeah, No, I want to taste a real big bite of  shrimp. I used 41/50 and went without using avacado as well not because I don't like avocado I love it, however, last minute shopping on Cinco de Mayo and there were no ripe ones.
I didn't miss it, it was just as good without the avacado.

RAVE reviews from children and adults alike!!!  Stayed pretty close to the recipe, except for the mango salsa; doubled the entire salsa portion of the recipe, plus 2 extra avacados.  The leftover salsa was used the next day when I made my own taco salad recipe using ground beef and sweet Italian sausage.  It, too, was a hit!!!

Super fast, easy and good. Just season the shrimp as it cooks with whatever you want; I did garlic powder, garlic salt and cracked pepper. Its pretty hard to mess up. Thumbs up.

Double the recipe for a 3 person meal. It‚Äôs delicious though and will go perfectly with a light rose. I added jalape√±os to cook the shrimp in and a little to the salsa instead of cilantro.  One of the best dishes I‚Äôve made so far from this site.

This dish was excellent!!!  So fresh and yummy.  The mango salsa is wonderful on chips, even by itself.  I'll make this one a lot!

If you're from the Portland area, I know exactly where you got this recipe! I'm obsessed with their shrimp tacos. When I go there, I get three platters so I can have leftovers. Their food is so good. The only problem is, I cannot find tortillas like the restaurants. Your recipe is very close!

Outstanding.  I fried the shrimp in olive oil.  Didn't seem to make a difference.  I didn't have Sriracha handy, so I just added chili powder to the shrimp while sauteeing.

The shrimp was too plain, so I made my own variation using garlic, lime,  and cilantro. The salsa however, was to die for. I'll be using that for future recipes.

I really liked this! Made it twice so far. Second time left off the cilantro as it is too overbearing for me. Also the second time did not have the honey butter so did what others suggested - saute shrimp in olive oil and some taco seasoning. Both times were delious.

it was yummy! I will make it again, and again. The only adjustment I made was that I did not have honey butter. But I did have butter and I did have Santa Fe chili honey. I added one tablespoon of honey to the butter. it was a total hit!

I made this as the recipe states except I left out the cilantro (not a fan) and I used EVOO and taco seasoning, pepper, and chili powder on the shrimp.  These were very good and so different.  My whole family loved them, who aren't always happy about new flavors.  The only thing I would advise is making the salsa maybe the day before.  The prep time says 15 minutes, but it took me over an hour just cutting up all the ingredients for it.  It would probably be better after sitting longer anyway.

I made this for my family not knowing how they would like it, but they loved it! The flavors are fresh and stand out. Everyone immediately said we needed to add this to the rotation! I paired it with some black beans as a side. It was delicious and now one of our favorite meals!

These were excellent! I followed the recipe practically to a T. I could not find honey butter in our local supermarket so I made my own. I saut√©ed the shrimp first in a little olive oil then I removed them from the pan. To the same pan I added 3 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of honey, whisking it together to form a sauce. I allowed the sauce to reduce and thicken up a bit and then I added the shrimp back to the pan coating them with the honey butter sauce. The slightly sweet shrimp together with the tangy mango salsa was delicious. A few dashes of hot sauce woukd be good too. Excellent recipe!!

Really delicious.   Marinated the shrimp in taco seasoning and cut the honey butter and halved the cilantro.  
The mango flavor was a big hit with family.

Salsa was to die for but lots of work to prepare so probably will not make again for a dinner. I will  just make the salsa and double for a special occasion served with chips, it was that good.  PS - do not use white corn totillas - I did and they fell apart immediately. PSS - I bought honey-butter for this recipe - found it in the butter section and $6 for a tub. So not worth it. Hubby likes on his bagels though so will not go to waste. :)

This recipe needed absolutely no changes although I only did only about 3/4 cup of cilantro (I doubled the recipe) and more lime and the whole family of 6 loved it which or rare.  I also mixed my own butter and honey together since I didn't have honey butter. YUM!

Absolutely loved these shrimp tacos, and very simple to make.  I followed the directions aside from adding an extra mango (as i love mango) and added some bacon bits since i had extra.  it makes far more salsa than the suggested 4 servings.  My 10 tortilla shell bag was used up along with a 50-60 count bag of frozen EZ peel shrimp, and still had a bit leftover for chips.  The salsa was better the second day when my mangos softened up and the flavors had all marinaded.  i only used regular butter instead of the honey butter and it was delicious.  it will be hard to try another shrimp taco recipe after this...

I live the honey butter and we but frozen cooked shrimp and mix with honey butter. The butter doesn't melt and run all over. If I am making ahead of time though, I make an aioli with egg yolk, Dijon mustard, olive oil, vegetable oil, garlic, lime and honey. This stores much better in the refrigerator as the honey butter congeals when refrigerated. My family loves these and not cooking makes it even quicker to make!

Great recipe. I made it without the honey butter, as I thought it would be too sweet. I used garlic butter instead. I also served salsa verde as a topping. Yellow Spanish rice with corn and black beans on the side.

I know people hate this but here's my modification. We had some good fresh mango and pineapple salsa so I just used it instead of chopping onions and mangos and peppers. It was a great shortcut AND these were so amazing that we couldn't believe it.

It was excellent!!! I did not add the mango, the honey butter was enough sweetness & I added taco seasoning mix, just a bit as a seasoning for the shrimp. The salsa was really good. We have made it 3 days in a row and now friends are using it as well! Also, I did add sour cream to the shells to knock off some of the honey. Thanks

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I brought this recipe to a taco party and everyone loved it.  The mix of the honey butter shrimp and the salsa is so delicious.  I didn't change a thing and it was a hit!

This was great.  My seventh grade son loved it! I made a couple of small changes.  I cooked the shrimp in a little butter and olive oil with garlic.I sprinkled just a little bit of taco seasoning on the shrimp.  I made the salsa as written and it was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.
