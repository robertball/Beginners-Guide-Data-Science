Very easy pie to put together! However, I wasn't too pleased with the appearance of the pie once it was out of the oven. So I took the 2nd pie crust and cut lattice strips out and layed them over the poptart layer, then baked for an additional 13 minutes (on top of the 15 extra I had to do after taking the tin foil off). I hope it tastes good!! will update after family get together.
