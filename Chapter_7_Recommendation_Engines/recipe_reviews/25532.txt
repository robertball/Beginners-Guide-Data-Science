This is how my Mom has been making deviled eggs since I can remember. The celery and onions need to be chopped very fine. For a great presentation place mixture into a plastic bag and cut off the corner, you can then pipe it into your egg halves.

Really, really good, I added a good shot of dijon mustard. And used red onion as my onions of choice and it was a hit! Have to guard the fridge so they can make it Easter dinner!

I had my doubts about this recipe but they were the best deviled eggs i've ever had, my family loved them!!!  If you are looking for classic deviled eggs check out the recipe at goodegg.com.  If you want 'em "kicked up a notch" you've found the right recipe.  Next time i'm definately adding more redhot. Thanks Di!

I am well known for my deviled eggs, or I should say my old deviled eggs. I made this recipe for a party and I have to admit it was better than my old recipe. The onions and celery add just the right amount of kick to the filling. Thanks Di!

This was ok.  It is a little bland as is.  Adding sweet pickled relish and yellow mustard improved the taste.  Thanks.

We really liked these deviled eggs. Instead of celery and salt I used celery salt. I loved it. That is what I put in my tuna fish also. This is a very simple recipe where the results are great.

I was careful with the mayo and instead of hot pepper sauce, used cayenne and white pepper to spice up the base mixture which worked amazingly well. Even the white pepper alone was powerful and robust. I added a bit of horseradish/honey mustard (1 tablespoon) to give it extra kick or 'devil' and used paprika as garnish as directed and chilled. The mild modifications kicked this recipie up alot of notches! I still prefer WARM devil eggs (weird I know) but still love these in the traditional chill mode.

These were very good! I ended up adding a little dijon mustard and a little extra celery,  but the recipe was good just as written also.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

I used wasabi mayo and substituted red onion for white.  It was just the right amount of kick.  I love the teture the onion and celery gave to the eggs.

Super Yummy and my new go-to deviled egg recipe!  Thank you! I loved the addition of the hot sauce.  The only thing I did differently was to add a tsp of dijon mustard, and I used celery seed instead of celery since my husband hates celery.

Oh dear god these were delicious! I made them at Halloween and used food coloring to make the yolk mixture bright orange and the whites lime green! Looked eerie and tasted like heaven! I got so many compliments on them!

It never failed y'all, I couldn't make deviled eggs if my life depended on it.  They were too runny, too much mayo, not enough, spices were wrong, you name it and I've had it happen with the end result being all eggs and accompanying yolks hit the garbage--each and EVERY time I tried to make them--no kidding! Time to head to the ONLY cooking website I use and the hunt was on! Sure enough, I found Di's INCREDIBLE edible deviled eggs and we ain't talking a TV commercial here either! But we could be because these are that GOOD! They are indeed INCREDIBLE!! I've never had deviled eggs with celery and onion but hey, I'm game and so glad I was!  They are absolutely DELICIOUS!  I did make sure those 2 ingredients were very finely chopped & its now the only recipe I use. I've never been a big fan of "spicy" so in lieu of the "dash of hot sauce" I substituted a "dash of French's "regular" mustard" and my days of never being able to make deviled eggs has come to an end thanks to Di! :o ) Its a genuine "red letter, mark it on your calendar" day when I get compliments for deviled eggs!  If you're like me and wondered about the celery & onion being part of it--DON'T!  They really are WONDERFUL!  The truth of it rang REAL true when I had to make another batch because I ate all 6 prepared eggs in one day!!! Needless to say, I had to make another batch for the cookout! ;o) Give it try you won't be disappointed.

Sorry Di, but I hated the addition of the celery and onion.  I wanted to make sure they were chopped finely, so I put them in my mini processor and it was still too crunchy.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were much too tasteless.

my favorite deviled eggs.  I pretty much follow this recipie except I use a little less onion.  I add a little mustard and about 1 teaspoon of white vinegar and 1/2 t. of sugar, and a little pickles any kind is fine sweet or dill, or hot sweet even better.  Better double or at least 1 1/2 as these go so quickly.

They were ok, but didn't wow me. I actually ended up adding other things to the mix to give them a little kick. I added garden onions in with the celery and I added some spicy brown mustard and some of my home made zucchini relish to the mix. This made it taste way better!

Definitely love this recipe but it is missing something so I added very finely chopped dill relish, 1 T white vinegar & 1 T yellow mustard & 1 T dijon mustard. (Note that I also tripled the recipe so that is for 18 eggs.) And I LOVE the hint of spicy with the hot pepper sauce!!! Thanks Di!

This recipe for deviled eggs is fabulous! Great flavor and the texture the finely chopped onions and celery give is so yummy! The only alteration I made is adding 1 tbsp of spicy dijon mustard, otherwise a perfect recipe!

Loved the addition of finely diced celery & onion (though not as much as the recipe calls for), but we needed to add some dijon & relish to give this enough flavor. Topped with paprika, black pepper & olives - they were well received!

I tried to like them, but both my husband and I thought they were not worth the effort to "tweak." I'll just go back to the old one I was using.

not a fan of these. the spice was nice but I am used to a more basic deviled egg recipe.  I never use onion or celery- and now I know I prefer it that way.   Was worth a try and allowed a nice photo opportunity because they are pretty. but 3 stars is all I have for this one. A positive note:  I will be adding a little bit of hot pepper sauce to my own recipe. that part rocked. Who doesn't love a little kick now and then?

I should have chopped my onions much, much finer!! Super fine! The crunch of the onions with this mixture was not good! But, if all ingredients are blended well to a puree texture the flavor is perfect!!

I just finished wrapping these up to put them in the fridge. My family is raving over them! I used several "dashes" of hot sauce -- about 2 tsp, I would say, and topped them with bacon bits. They're delicious! :)

Good, I like the addition of the celery and onion.  Just seemed something missing that you usually get in a deviled egg - no vinegar in this one?  But for those who don't like vinegar these are a good alternative.

As others have mentioned, make sure the onion and celery are chopped VERY WELL!

This classic has been saved in my recipe box! I tripled it for my husband's retirement party, that I was catering. These were the first to go!
Recipe was followed as it is. I did cheat and use celery FLAKES and dried minced  onion.(these re-hydrated in the mayonnaise.  
This is a perfect recipe. Thanks Hipps for sharing with us.

These were so popular when I made them for a recent party! The celery was an unusual, but tasty addition and they were so easy to make. Will definitely make them again.

Made 24 of these for our cookout and only had 10 by the time the company arrived.  So simple yet so loved.  I also cut the mayo in half and substituted fat free sour cream.  No one noticed....  :-).

Disappointing. After so many great reviews, I was expecting a much more tasty result.  The flavor was bland.  Couldn't taste anything but onion.  I had to add way more hot sauce than in the recipe just to give the filling some flavor.

Very good. The flavors mix great together. I added a little more than 1 dash of hot sauce, and thought it brought out the flavors better. Also made it more zesty.

I added extra hour sauce but still didnt taste it so I was disappointed. I think for someone who likes celery and onions, they would be top knotch BUT for me they were a no go. It's not one of those recipes that hide the onion taste, it's obvious it's there. I wrong make then again based on my taste

Were the best deviled eggs I've ever made! The only thing I did differently, was add relish to it. I used Wickles wickedly delicious relish to it. Everyone ate them right up.

The onion made these made these totally unedible.  My onions were sharp and they overwhelmed the yolk mixture.  I still have nothing but onion flavor in my mouth after just tasting the stuff. If I ever try this recipe again I will use less than half the onion or perhaps caramelize it first, but I think onion powder would work better,

I haven't found a deviled egg recipe that I absolutely love yet but this one will work until then, or with a few adjustments.  The onion and celery add a very nice egg-salad-like quality to these but the lack of mustard makes them somewhat plain.  I plan to try this again with a few changes!

I don't get all the rave reviews.  I found the eggs edible, but there wasn't the depth of flavor I enjoy in the recipes with mustard in the ingredients.  My kids loved it, but I won't be making this recipe again.

I have been searching for a great deviled egg recipe and this is it!  I added dill instead of paprika for the garnish but this recipe is fantastic!

These were quite good.  I followed the recipe and finished with smoked Spanish paprika.  My kids and hubby liked them as well.

i used miracle whip for the mayo and didn't have any hot sauce and bf didn't want it spicy anyway. I added some black pepper also. We really enjoyed the 'crunch" of the veggs. will make it again for sure

I'm not exactly sure how to rate this since I do not like hard boiled eggs.   I did try one and these aren't dry, flat and tasteless like other deviled eggs I've had.  I could actually eat these.  The only thing I changed was I added quite a bit more hot sauce to give it more of a kick.  Everyone liked them but I don't think they are exceptional since I wasn't asked for the recipe but still pretty good.

Deeelish! I've never put anything but relish in my eggs before but wanted something new. This is a winner! I did add a smidgen of mustard, though, and used a chipotle hot sauce which gave it a nice smoky flavor. Di, your Delicious Deluxe Deviled Eggs are now in my recipe box! Thanks!

I have never liked deviled eggs (or hard boiled eggs for that matter) but I like these more each day I have some!  I did leave out the celery (forgot it at the store) but next time I will put it in for some crunch.  No onion for me though!  My husband though they were just like his grandma used to make them.

The first time I made these, they turned out wonderfully, but for some reason the second time, they were a little runny, so I ended up adding instant potato flakes to thicken them up.  Worked like a charm and no one was the wiser.

After finishing this recipe, I wish I would have just put all of the ingredients together in a blender.  I originally didn't do this as I was wanting the crunch of the onions and celery, but I had to double this recipe for my event.  By the time I was done finely chopping the celery and onions, I still had to peel the eggs.  It ended up being pretty time-consuming.  Next time I will not care as much about the "crunch."  The taste was wonderful, though!

NOT GOOD. I was really looking forward to trying this recipe since it had so many good reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, chopped the onion and celery very fine. It was bland yet onion-y. So I added mustard to try to help it, but there was nothing that could save this recipe. Just not good. I DO NOT recommend.

These deviled eggs are decent, but it's missing some umph. I haven't figured it out yet, but when I do, I'll update.

It still sells out out though. :)

Out of 6 of us, 2 love deviled eggs and they loved these.  Very simple to make, and I made them exactly as the recipe said.  My husband does prefer red pepper over paprika, but my son preferred the paprika.  Either way, these were a hit in our house for them.  Thank you.

These were eggcellent!! Exactly what a Deviled Eggs should taste like.  A great way to use up eggs.  I put the filling in a sandwhich bag, cut off a corner and piped the filling into the egg whites. Don't forget that older eggs work best for peeling!

Delicious! A perfect Deviled Egg!  It reminds me of an egg salad sandwich (w/out the bread of course!) Also,  removing the eggs from boiling point and allowing it to cool for 12 min makes the perfect hard boiled egg.  Doing it this way you get a pefect yellow yolk instead of the ugly green ring around the yolk that you see sometimes! THX.

This is exactly the way I make deviled eggs.  The recipe is also exactly how my mother makes her eggs as well.  I never had a deviled egg that would make me want to deviate from this recipe.  I am always asked to bring the eggs for any pot luck gathering.

Oh man, with onions minced into the egg, I had an onion hangover for the entire day.  I might add a lot less next time.

I used green onion as that is what I had on hand.  I substituted fat free plain yogurt for the mayo to cut down on calories.  These were really just ok for us.  Pretty bland.  Probably 2 stars for taste but I added an extra to be fair since I did substitute a bit.  Oh well, my search for the perfect deviled egg continues.....

great recipe. I didn't have hot pepper sauce, nor do I like spicy foods, so I added about 1/2 tbsp of dijon mustard. Like others have said, the celery and onion have to be very finely chopped. Also I would recommend putting salt in the water to boil the eggs, i think it helps the shells come off easier.

I put in too much salt, but putting the filling in the egg white helped (that and I like salty food).

I would def make these again, the method of boiling is just right. I usually boil (heat on all the way) for 15 mins.

Followed the recipe as is and didn't find it overly unique.  Too much celery for sure. I'll stick to other recipes.

Didn't use the celery, as none of us like it.  Great recipe.  Used Ken's method to cook the eggs, which makes the process of peeling go very easily and quickly.  I make deviled eggs all the time and love this recipe.

Awesome!  I changed it up a bit based on what i had around and I don't think they could possibly have turned out better.  Instead of onion, i used 1/2 of a shallot.  This gave it a great garlic undertone!  I also added a a bit of yellow mustard, not much, probably 1.5 - 2 teaspoons. I also chopped up (finely) about 5 hamburger dill slices for a little dill flavor and crunch. Love the crunch of the celery and shallot!  Hands down the best deviled eggs i have ever eaten.

This is a great, basic deviled egg recipe that is easy to make variations with but always works. I have swapped red onions for the white, miracle whip instead of mayo and other small variations with no problems. Very good and tasty.

I don't eat eggs at all, but going by my family's rave reviews, I would say that this recipe is the best! I served these eggs at a family gathering and they were gone in 10 seconds flat! The only change I made to the recipe was to add in a little yellow mustard to the mix for some extra zing. I would definitely serve these again.

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made these a few times now and there are never any left. In fact, I made them for 4th of July and they barely made it from the kitchen to the food table...  I follow this recipe everytime I make it and I've had nothing but good results! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I made this just this morning, and I thought they were fantastic.  I've never made deviled eggs before, so I have nothing to compare them to, but they were very good.  A big hit with the family.

Oh Yum! It's easy to please my family with any recipe for deviled eggs. Let me share a couple of my secrets. When you know you are making deviled eggs a few days before, you want to turn your carton of eggs upside down. This will center the yolk in the egg so it isn't all the way down to the bottom of the egg. Also, I mix all my ingredients together and put them in a quart zip lock bag. I like the quart freezer bags since they are heavier. I then cut one of the bottom corners off the bag and PRESTO.......you can pipe your egg mixture into your eggs with no mess!

Very delicious but I made the following adjustments: used red onion, added a splash of white wine vinegar and a dollop of Dijon mustard. My other suggestion would be to do a full dozen eggs because no. One can eat jut one!

Different but still tasty. My husband and I are not big fans of fresh celery so I made 6 eggs with about 1/4 stalk of celery. After mixing the egg yolks and assembling 1/2 of an egg, I did taste it and was not that pleased. To remedy that, I did add a squirt of regular mustard. With that said, this deviled eggs recipe is good and tasty but not exceptional.

Not much flavor.  I added a slice of cherry tomatoe to the top and added some drops of the hot pepper sauce to the top because the filling was tasteless.

Good! But I changed it for sake of using what I had avail. Used Celery Salt, an onion powder. No salt or pepper. I liked the hot pepper sauce and I added garlic powder, cayenne, a dash of pickle relish, a squirt of spicy brown mustard, and mustard powder. can't wait to taste after they chill, but so far so good! Thanks!

This deviled eggs were amazing!  I was a little hesitant to add the hot sauce, but they turned out great...just like my mom used to make!  If I could give this recipe more stars, I would!

I really didn't like these because of the onion and I missed the vinegar to give it the tanginess I love!!

These are delicious with a nice consistency.  I didn't have celery so I left it out and added a dash of Old Bay. My husband and I devoured these as soon as I was finished making them.

These turned out very well.  I cheated a little when I made mine.  Trader Joes sells hard boiled eggs in their dairy section, so I used them instead of hard-boiling eggs myself.  I was out of the hot pepper sauce, so I'll probably add some the next time to see the difference.  Our guests ate these up very quickly and I'm told they were indeed delicious.  Thanks Di.

These taste just like my mom's. I left out the hot pepper sauce, but other than that I followed the directions exactly. I chopped the onions and celery very fine with my mini chopper, and I piped in  the filling using a plastic bag as suggested by another reviewer.

I made this for a party I went to this weekend and they were a hit.  I did add some things to it for my personal preference - 1/2 Tablespoon sweet pickle relish, a teaspoon of prepared mustard and ground black pepper.  I absolutely loved the idea of adding a little piece of fresh dill to the top!  That is what really made the eggs I think.  I used light mayo and no one complained.  I accidentally forgot the hot sauce and am really disappointed but will definitely get it next time.

My mom always made her deviled eggs with vinegar, mayo, mustard and seasoned to taste. I thought they were pretty hard to beat, but this was an excellent variation. My son didn't like the celery, so I'll leave it out next time. Used 1 extra egg and chopped up the whites to add to the mixture. A good way to cool the eggs is to place in ice water for a few minutes.

This is the same recipe that my Nan made every holiday when I was growing up. I have tried many others but I always come back to this one and it's the only one that my kids will eat. I always make sure I put the celery and onions in the food processer for about 5 or 6 pulses but be careful not to over do it or it will draw all of the water out and turn to mush.

These were devoured pretty quickly by guests, I guess that means they're good!  I like them, also. I added onion, omitted celery, used a couple dashes of hot sauce for 20 eggs. I used prepared mustard to taste, salt and pepper.  I will make these again.

Extremely good.  I loved the texture from the onions and celery.  There has been mentioned that the onions and celery do not give it much taste.  I recommend using finely chopped white onions.  They added flavor to my recipe.

YUM!  These got raves when I made them.  I felt they could use a bit more hot sauce, to taste.  Note:  If you're not a celery fan than find another recipe.  I thought the celery was a nice texture and flavor in this recipe, but it not like traditional deviled eggs.

These eggs were a hit at the cabin.  They didn't last until dinner.  I added a good squirt of yellow mustard and some pepper to the recipe.  I made sure to mince the onion and celery very fine, making the texture more kid friendly. Loved the taste of the hot pepper sauce.

These deviled eggs were good but very bland.  I like my deviled eggs spicy so next time I'll add some dry mustard to spice them up like I use in my regular recipe.  The veggies are an interesting touch!

Every year at Thanksgiving, I've made different kinds of deviled eggs, trying to find The One. This is it. I changed nothing except for not including celery because I didn't have any. Usually there are tons of leftover deviled eggs, but not this year. I got rave reviews, including from my father-in-law who told me to stop looking. He agreed that I had found the best recipe.

My daughter made these, and they're incredible exactly as written. I've since adopted this recipe as "mine." :-) my family is not usually keen on raw onions or celery in recipes, but the flavors and textures are just right. Be sure to chop veggies very fine, with a hand chopper if possible.

I enjoyed these, but I after making the mixture something told me to add dijon mustary, about 1/2 teaspoon, and then it went to 5 star recipe.  I like the celery crunch in it.

Good flavor, but almost too much crunch in the texture with the celery and onion, for me.  Guess I like my eggs more creamy than crunchy.

This recipe is really delicious.  I made them for Easter and the eggs flew off the serving tray.  I did however add some wasabi paste to the mix - so they were wasabi deviled eggs.  They were yummy!

I doubled the recipe because I had 11 eggs. So I used half an onion.  It was awful.  The mix was very runny and the taste of onion was overpowering.  This may also be because I pulsed the onion and celery in my magic bullet to mince, so I kept all the juices.  I will take the blame and try it again but with less onion and celery.  If it doesn't work next time I'll switch to minced onion and garlic salt.  My batch was completely inedible.

The celery and onion made a great twist! While these aren't like traditional deviled eggs they were...EGGcelent! The filling was just a bit runnier than what I usually like :o)

These were okay; a tad bit bland and I definitely did not care for the chopped onion. Will try again with more black pepper and cayenne and perhaps a touch of mustard.

This is a great recipe. My family is not a fan of celery so we left that out. I used about a tablespoon more mayo than called for, added 1.5 teaspoons of mustard, and added salt and pepper to taste. This is the best recipe I've found. :)

I wasn't a huge fan of the texture from the onions/celery (I guess I'm more of a purist than I thought) - be really careful about the strength of your onion too - mine was way too strong and overpowered the other more mild flavors.

Hi it's Di the one who submitted. Thanks for all the feedback! here is my latest suggestion.I like just a little "heat" in my deviled eggs. Last time, after mixing the ingredients together, I OMITTED the hot sauce & sprinkled a very small amount of cayenne pepper to taste. I have also sprinkled a tiny bit of cayenne on top of the filled eggs instead of paprika..DELISH!But start with very small amounts..you don't want it too hot! Next time I'm trying finely minced jalapeno! :) Also I realize that 1/4 onion is going to be different for everyone. My suggestion to those who feel it's to "oniony" is to add onion to taste. Bon Appetite!

These are not your typical deviled eggs but they were still yummy.  I made 6 eggs and my boyfriend and I gobbled them up in minutes. The only thing I would change is put less onion and celery. That part was a little too overpowering, but the egg mix was great.

I rated the recipe as is because I felt it was lacking the mustard flavor I tend to love in deviled eggs!  The hot sauce and crunchy bits were a hit, but the eggs definitely needed mustard to make them "delicious."

Looks elegant and tasty awesome. I added 1 tbs dijon mustard and 3/4 tsp dill to the yolk mixture to give it a something special. This a great recipe to prepare with children. Be sure to make plenty, because people gobble these up fast. My friends loved them. Deviled eggs are not hard to make at all. It just requires patience and careful handling to not break the eggs. It's totally worth the time. You won't be disappointed!

This is a truly fabulous recipe for egg salad (cut up egg whites, too), but I liked it considerably less for deviled eggs.  It turned out quite runny:  one change I would make is to add part of the mayo first and then only add more if it is too dry.  Also, mash us the egg yolks before adding anything else, as it is hard to mash them up thoroughly with the celery and onion. Because the filling was so wet, I could not fill the egg whites very high, so I had filling left over.  Also, I really missed the mustard that is in many recipes, which is what makes it taste more "deviled" and less "egg salad."  However, I really did like the celery and onion (I used sweet onion, which was great), which I tend not to use for deviled eggs, so I am glad I tried it.  Next time, I will add celery and onion to a mustardy recipe.

I had to double the recipe so I decided to try to add the mustard to one half as one of the reviewers suggested and in my opinion it ruined it...  I am used to the taste of mustard based recipes but Di's is my choice from now on!!! My suggestion would be leave the recipe alone; Di got it right for you.

These are awesome, the celery and onion add the perfect 'crunch' to kick up the ordinary deviled egg. My father actually said they were the "best deviled eggs he ever had"! And even my 4 yr old daughter liked the filling (and she usually doesn't like eggs in general). I didn't use quite as much onion as the recipe called for, but otherwise I followed it exactly. If I make these just for our family, I'll add even more hot sauce for a bigger "kick". These were a huge hit at our barbecue (when the plate got to me, there was only one left!), and I'll be making these again!

Amazing! My boyfriend who does not like deviled eggs loved these! I didn't add any hot sauce or paprika, but it still tasted great. Will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for an Easter luncheon. It was well received. I would add a little more hot sauce for more taste.

I made these at a cookout and they were gone in seconds!  They were great!  Next time I will definately add mustard and more hot sauce and maybe a little cayenne.  It was a little bland for my taste, but I prefer everything to be spicy!

I was really surprised by this.  I thought the recipe sounded good, but didn't pull it off.  I found the celery and onion added texture, but not much flavor at all.  I usually add Claussen Dill Pickles, and they add a nice bite with texture as well.  Maybe add more hot pepper sauce...  I couldn't taste it at all.  I ended up just adding a ton of deli mustard to give it some flavor, because it was bland, bland, bland.

These tasted fine, but it took some getting used to the crunch of the celery and onion in the yolk mixture.  The splash of hot sauce was a nice touch, though.

This was amazing!! I kept adding the chopped celery and onion in small amounts and tasting it along the way, and ultimately ended up needing less than posted in this recipe. Great recipe - will use again and again! Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I substituted 1/4 cup mustard for half of the mayo, since my husband isn't big on mayonaise, and it came out bril.

I like this recipe for a change.  I use Frank's Red Hot Buffalo wings sauce for the hot sauce. (it is not as hot as it sounds) I also like to add some jalapeno mustard. I have also used tobasco sauce and that was good too.  I add atleast a good tablespoon of the hot sauce for my taste. I have also minced a jalapeno to give it a good kick. But that may be too much kick for some.  Good luck!

These were great!  I loved the crunch and flavor that the celery and onion added.  I also really liked the hot sauce in it, though I added quite a bit more than a dash, because I liked the kick.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time making deviled eggs for a barbecue today.  This was a good recipe but, after following the directions exactly, it still seemed bland.  I added more hot sauce (all I had was Tabasco, which isn't very hot) and ground mustard.  That seemed to do the trick.  Will make again as these are very good.

I added quite a bit more hot sauce (although it still didn't seem very spicy...maybe I overloaded my taste buds w/ sweet & spicy pickles) & I loved them!  did sprinkle some w/ paprika & some with dill.

These were really good.  However I took out the celery b/c it watered it down too much and I added mustard and parsely and a bit more hot sauce.

I changed it a bit. I use dill relish, onion powder, garlic powder, smoked paprika, onion soup mix (I just use a little of the mix, not the onions)dukes mayo, mustard and a little mustard powder, a pinch of cayenne. It's a BIG hit!

I do not think these were bland.  I was a little afraid of the onion and celery because it's difficult to cut them up small enough, but they added just the right amount of flavor.  I used a food processor to make it creamy.  These were delicious!

Excellent basic deviled egg recipe! Increase the mustard or use a different variety if you want to change it up a bit. Also try topping with minced tarragon for added herbal flavor.

These were great, I added a little cayenne pepper, Cholula hot sauce and a little bit of mustard and it was amazing. My family and friends couldn't get enough of them :)

I was skeptical about the onions an celery when I saw this recipe, but decided to make these wonderful deviled eggs as written. They were GREAT!

I like this recipe. Instead finely cutting celery and onion, i minced them. It came out perfect! I also added some Splenda.

First time ever making deviled eggs, crazy I know.  But this recipe was a good guideline for me.  I did leave out the celery and onion as we are not fans of "crunchy" bits in the mixture.  I added onion powder in stead.  Next time I will add a little more mayo, was slightly dry.  Will make them again!

The best deviled eggs we've had, for sure. I did not make any changes to the ingredients in the recipe and used the following specific amounts:
One dozen eggs (for 24 deviled egg halves)
One whole (very small) yellow onion
Three sticks of celery
1/2 cup Hellman's mayonnaise
6 turns on a salt grinder (coarse sea salt)
4 shakes of Texas Pete's hot sauce

I used a ninja to get the celery and onion extremely fine (pulp like).

I'm not really a deviled egg lover. We had these every Easter dinner when I was growing up, so I figured I'd make them for traditions sake. I just finished my batch and I swear; finger licking good!! I did replace the hot pepper sauce with cayenne and white pepper and it still turned out amazingly! I'm going to have a really hard time waiting one more day for Easter to get here with these sitting in my fridge!! I may just eat them and have to make some more! ;)

Love these eggs and so does everyone I make them for. The only thing I do different is I garnish with ground chipotle chili instead of paprika. It adds a little bit of heat and smokiness that is reminiscent of bacon.

Tried this yesterday, it went over beautifully!  Texture was very creamy and the hot sauce gave it just the tinest kick.  I scaled the recipe to make 18 servings.  I will definetly make these again!

This recipe is awesome like it is.  made it once with a couple dashes of celery seed, as I had no celery.  Worked great!  
Note:  Try adding 1/2 teaspoon of Dijon mustard for a nice variation.

Made as written and they were great. I don't usually put a lot of stuff in devilled eggs except for Miracle Whip and either a sprig of dill or chives, but these were very good. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

We didn't have any celery, but aren't big fans of it anyway, so we left that out.  That may be why these tasted just a little heavy on the mayo at first.  We added a few more drops of hot sauce & a little splash of vinegar & these are really good.

I love the basic recipe - you can't go wrong!  But as much as I LOVE mayonnaise, I am always trying to find ways to get the same effect with a few less calories.  I add equal parts mayonnaise and plain hummus and find that you really can't tell the difference and the hummus just adds a little body to the yolk filling.  And as others have suggested, a squirt of dijon mustard adds that little kick that puts them over the top!

This is good but a little bland. I usually add a small amount of spicy mustard and sometimes some relish. It really helps the mixture come to life.

Perfect! They're so simple with a wonderful flavor and that's what deviled eggs are all about. The crunchy hit of onion and celery makes them have great texture. Alternate toppings could be dill or smoked paprika.

Made these for a friend who is a new mom, so left out the onion. Wasn't sure if the celery would be a welcome addition, but the added crunch was brilliant! Used sriracha (also known to some as Rooster sauce - a Vietnamese hot sauce) in place of the hot sauce, and also added chopped capers and a bit of pickle relish. Garnished with chopped Italian parsley. Delicious! This makes a really good, basic deviled egg: very tasty. Chopped radishes make a nice crunchy and colorful garnish, too.

These were good but not great.  they tasted good -more like potato salad than a deviled egg.  Overall I didn't care for the lumpy texture of the yolk mixture (perhaps I didn't mash them well enough).  Next time I'll use a more traditional deviled egg recipe.

Yum! I tweeked the recipe a little and it turned out great! I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 miracle whip and also added about 1 tsp of dijon mustard and about 1 tsp of dried dill. I used 2 green onions instead of the regular onion.

Was Good. Just needed a lot more hot sauce than called for and ground mustard. Also, try to put the celery and onion in the food processor so it's not chunky.

this was a great and easy recipe to do!  i forgot to put the hot sauce but it was still great.  you do have to fine chop the veggies for best result and use less mayo; but that may be my preferences but i like my devil eggs a little bit drier.

Deviled eggs are awesome...because you pretty much season them to taste...and you can add all kinds of things just depending on whether you like them salty, sweet, zesty, spicy....and the list goes on....yummy, simple recipe.

Awesome take on the traditional deviled egg. I followed the recipe and enjoyed the final outcome, BUT in the end I did end up adding 1TB horseradish and some honey mustard per another reviewer's comment. Food's all about personalization, right? I made the eggs for a Steeler's game, so I dyed half of the mixture black and then filled two seperate pastry bags and piped the yolks back into the eggs. It was an AWESOME black and gold Steelers snack!!!

Great for the person who wants something other than the traditional deviled egg. The onion and celery are really powerful and adds lots of texture.

Really good! I did not grow up eating deviled eggs. I never realized that they didn't have to taste so relishy, watery or mustardy! This recipe is for egg lovers that appreciate the purist approach. Nothing in this recipe over powers the eggs. Deviled eggs should taste like eggs, and these do! I'm not a big fan of hot sauce, so I used a sprinkle of cayenne, and a squirt of french's mustard and they rocked!

I made these tonight and after sampling the mixture, I realized the onion is way too much. My kids won't eat this because of it. I did use white onion which may have been a mistake. I had to add sweet relish and mustard to cover the onion taste.

I think with less onion it will be a better recipe!

Looking for a twist on traditional deviled eggs, I tried these. I followed the recipe exactly and felt it needed some additional kick, which is the reason for the 4 star review. As far as my additions to suit my taste, I added cayenne pepper and stone ground mustard and really, really liked them.

Great eggs... very easy this is third time,
celery salt works if you don't have celery. Also great with or without onions. 
Thank you Hipp.

These received a lot of compliments at Easter dinner! I added a little bit of mustard powder to mine.

These were really good devilled eggs...except I found the amount of mayo to be a bit much.  Next time I would reduce by 1 Tbsp and go from there...I found the mixture to be a bit to runny.  The only change I made was to use shallot instead of minced onion as the flavour is a little milder.

These were one of the best deviled eggs I've made. Big hit for easter!  I added about a tablespoon each of shallot and green onion instead of the onion called for.  Used maille dijon - about 2 heaping Tbsp. and about 8 dashes of Frank's red hot and a pinch of cayenne.  Excellent w/ a little "kick"  :)

Delicious!!  I used green onions, and instead of all mayo, did half mustard. I also put about 3 dashes of hot sauce. Loved the crunch of the celery/onion!  The bits of green mixed in gave a pretty presentation.  Will make again!!

This was a great recipe. I ended up adding some celery seed, a bit more hot sauce, and some chives. It was really tasty. Classic, but jazzed up.

I liked these... I used celery seed in place of celery only because certain family members cannot chew it... and used onion powder also.  I also added a little sprinkle of garlic powder, just because it's a personal preference.

i didn't care for this recipe at all. i had to triple for an Easter recipe and ended up with too much onion. we cut the final product in half an added another cup of mayo to even out the taste.

Delicious! Nice and creamy with a great texture! The thing I like the most about these deviled eggs is the hint of hot sauce. It gives the eggs a nice spicy taste!


I will definitely make these again!

Turned out well, except that I used celery salt instead of celery, since that's what I had already. I didn't taste it before adding more regular salt, therefore it turned out a bit saltier than I would have liked. To asuage the saltiness, I added some dijon mustard and a thin slice of pickle underneath the yolk-mixture. That helped a lot.

These were really really good, so good in fact that I ate 4 before dinner, I have to admit I did not add the hot sauce, it did not seem right, but after reading the reviews I will the next time as I will be making these often. The only other thing I did different was, I garnish my eggs with chopped flat leaf parsley and paprika. The Best!!!!.

These were fantastic deviled eggs.  I followed the recipe but I used cayenne pepper instead of chili or hot sauce.  I kept adding a little at a time into the mix until they had enough heat.  I would definitely recommend, especially for gatherings!

These are YUMMY!!!  I have never had a deviled egg in my life so I have nothing to compare them to, but I have definitely become a fan.  I didn't have any celery on hand, so I used sweet relish instead.  I used a copius amount of hot sauce, and it worked really well with the sweet taste first, and then the spiciness catching you off guard towards the end.  Next time I might add a little vinegar to try it out, and making it the night before and letting it chill in the fridge might work too.  Thank you for a delicious recipe Di!!!!

These were good, but I thought the onion flavor was a little strong for me.  They did get eaten up at my party however, so maybe I'm just not a big fan of onions.  The celery gave it a nice crunch.

The flavor was fine, but I didn't care for crunchy bits in my deviled eggs. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. The hot sauce was a nice touch.

I made these eggs for as an appetizer for an Easter party for my family .  They all liked the texture that the onion and celery brought to the eggs.  From reading the reviews, I decided to add dijon mustard because I tend to like that pungent acrid taste that mustard brings to deviled eggs.  Some may think that it interferes with the hot sauce, although my family loved the eggs and I would definitely make them again.

These are good. I like the hot sauce in them and put way more than called for.  I think that was my husbands favorite part as well.  I am a purist also though and did not prefer the texture of the crunch in my deviled eggs... I kept thinking I was getting a bite of egg shell.

Pretty much flavorless, even with the hot sauce. However, I did enjoy the added texture of the minced onion and celery. I'll stick to my own recipe in the future, but add the onion and celery to my mixture.

When I make these, instead of celery I use chopped dill pickle. I add about 1/2 teaspoon of mustard instead of hot sauce. Otherwise I make them the same way. They are always a big hit!

These are simple and awesome! I might use celery salt next time and eliminate the celery and salt,  just to avoid bloodshed-fine chopping is not my forte!

OMG I just made these yesterday for the football game. 2 dozen eggs gone before the game started. Everyone was raving about them.  They LOVED the crunch from the celery and onion.  I followed your recipe to a tee.  Wouldn't change anything.  Will be making these from now on when I make deviled eggs.

Folks loved the crunchiness provided by the celery and onion. Served with a sliver of radish which served to add color and keep the aluminum foil away from the egg mixture. Used real mayo instead of salad dressing. Yummy! Did 9 eggs total with no leftovers.

Bland. Needs a little mustard in addition to the mayo, and skip the onions and celery and opt for pickle relish.

Loved adding a bit of Cholula.  It added the right amount of Zip.
Everyone liked them.  I didn't add celery since many in my family don't like it.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Made two batches, one exactly like this and the other I added little mustard, little cayenne pepper and green onions instead of white onions.  I loved both.

I used dried onion rather than real onion, and also used garlic. I added some mustard too, and skipped the hot sauce Quadrupled the recipe for family Easter get together. I liked this better than any other deviled eggs recipe I had tried before. Big thumbs up!


Made it again with onions. definitely use half as much as she says

These were pretty good and everyone enjoyed them.  To be fair, I would rate these a 4.5 without any changes.  I think they definitely need a teaspoon of Dijon Mustard & a 1/2 tsp salt added to the filling.  After these changes, it would probably jump to a 4.5 star deviled egg..

Did just as the recipe called for but I made nine eggs instead of six. I set them out while cooking dinner, they were gone in a blink of an eye! I love the thick & hearty flavor of the yolk, the onion & celery give them great flavor & crunch.

Wow what a difference the onions and celery makes. These are really easy to make and taste great. I made no changes to the recipe; however, found that mincing the onion and celery made it easier to come out of the pastry bag. Great recipe!  I will be making this recipe from now on!.. Thanks for sharing.

I will definitely make this recipe again! I minced the celery and onion very small. I submitted a pic of the final product.  I made the following changes:

-1/2 tsp celery salt (instead of salt)
-1/2 tsp lemon juice
-1/4 tsp yellow mustard
-equal amounts of celery and onion (so, less onion than in recipe)
-dash of cayenne (instead of hot sauce)
-garnish with chives & paprika

This is a great starting point for a deviled eggs recipe! I like a tangier filling, so I added dijon mustard, white vinegar and extra hot sauce (Louisiana Hot Sauce). They weren't spicy at all but had great flavor. They were a huge hit at the party!

Did you know you can hard boil eggs in the oven? Place your eggs in a muffin tin,no water, bake in a preheated oven at 325 degrees for 30 minutes, no more or no less than 30 minutes.When done cool in cold water right away.....so easy

This was a very good recipe..  A little too much onion for me.  I will make again and use a little less.  All in all, this was a great recipe and very easy to make.

I usually like the egg filling a little bit thicker. The flavors were good. I added garlic and onion powder as well.

I made this for a potluck at work and it was a hit. Everyone loved them. They asked if I can make them again at our next potluck. Such a simple recipe too. I did add a little more hot sauce (Red Hot) than what it called for.

I was to make 48 deviled eggs for my cousin's graduation party.  I decided to make three different recipes for some variety.  These looked simple and had great reviews...so I tried them.  They were a huge hit because they were absolutely delicious!  I made extra and added chopped egg for egg salad--it was even better the next day.  This is the new standard in my house!

Made these for mothers day and they were gone quick! My husband was very skeptical about the celery, but said they were really good once they were done. I didn't add the onion because I don't like them and used Siracha as the hot sauce. This will definitely be my go-to deviled egg recipe. Thanks!

My husband thought these were better than his mom's.  I added a tsp of dry mustard and seasoned with season salt and pepper. I made them for Easter so I dyed the egg whites.

This recipe was so good!  I did listen to other reviewers and added in some dijon mustard.  If you don't have a chopper, it can take forever to get the celery and onion small enough.

The opinion on these was mixed -- some loved them, some didn't. The hot pepper sauce was a nice addition, but I think the recipe calls for a little too much onion. To be fair, I should mention that I altered the recipe slightly, due to the recommendation of others, and added about a tsp. of dijon mustard and a little bit of sweet relish.  But I think that only added to the flavor.

Flew off the plate! This recipe was great, I would have never though to add hot sauce.  I did add way more than recipe called for, for a more spicy kick.  I also added a little bit of regular yellow mustard.

This was really good. I will use a lot more hot sauze next time though. A "dash" really isn't enough for a spicy flavor. I really liked the crunchiness though.

I didn't use the celery or onion and added a squirt of yellow mustard and some relish.  The hot sauce really makes these eggs the best.  For half a dozen eggs I used about 7-8 drops of Louisiana Hot Sauce.

those were great! I made 8 eggs and we just had those for dinner lol. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I sort of eye-balled all of the ingrediants and made it to my taste.  I added creamy horseraddish and a few shots of texas pete and it came out perfect. I really enjoyed the addition of celery and onion for some crunch. I sliced them very fine so the flavor of onion wouldn't over power me. Thanks again for this great recipe!

Yummy, but I am more accustomed to deviled eggs with a bit more tang.  Normally I'd use Miracle Whip, but I didn't want to deviate from the recipe since hot sauce is used.  Still very tasty, though!

This was an excellent deviled egg.  I didn't think it was much different or more special than the other very good ones I've had, but it was definitely worthy of sharing at a potluck brunch.  The onions and celery add a nice texture and an unexpected crunch.  I put in a ton of Tabasco and it wasn't enough--I'll probably use more next time.
