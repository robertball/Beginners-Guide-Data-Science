This recipe rocks! There is no reason to buy salsa, make it and you'll see it is really, the best. Thank you for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe.  Close to one I use but mine didn't call for bell
pepper.  I found the bell pepper really added to the taste.  Too, I use a can
of diced tomato/chile pepper (Rotel) rather than tomato sauce.  Next time I
make this I'll go back to that simply because I like the heat. This is a very
adaptable recipe where one can add or reduce the ingredient portions depending
on their taste. If you don't have a go to salsa recipe this is a very good
place to start.  Many thanks for a fine recipe, Big Nanc.
