This bread was just like the bread I had in Morocco.  Soooo good.  I used 1 cup of Wheat flour instead of Semolina because I couldnt find it at the store.  I ate it with baked chicken and potatoes the Moroccan way...thanks for this recipe.

A very nice Moroccan bread recipe for the bread machine. I did however increase my water to 1 cup. 7/8th was just not enough!

This was the best bread recipe I have tried in a long time. Very easy. Very soft texture-I brushed a little olive oil on after I took it out of the oven.Will be making this again and again.

I made this bread during the holidays and it was terrific.  I made the following substitutions which made it better I think.  2tsp of anise seed instead of 1tsp.  I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the white flour in the 2 1/4 cups called for.  After I divided the dough into two balls and rolled out 2 pizza like "rounds" I pressed in green olives and black olives then let it rise. Watch it though, the bread bakes really quickly.  Later I tried adding sun dried tomatoes in the same way and that was good too.

Seductively tasty, thx :-)

CAUTION:
Just don't leave the entire bread basket on the table; it'll disappear bef
ore the food arrives.

NO SEMOLINA FLOUR?
Just grab a box of couscous (that's wheat grain), pour it in the blender, and grind it into dust (couscous=pulverize).lv

NO COUSCOUS?
Pulverize your southern grits (but that's corn grain).

I did not use the two kinds of flour listed.  Instead I used all whole wheat flour, which made 2 cups of it be all that I needed.  Because  of using a heavier flour, the rising times were longer. Great anise taste!  I'll be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the icing on the cake for the moracan meal I served. It was great, and perfect for soaking up the juices from the Lamb Tagine recipe from this site.

fabulous, its perfect- does anyone know how to prepare baghrair

Also I increased a little bit of water so it was 1.25 cups and 

this is exactly as moroccan bread is -hard on the outside. soft on the inside-the olive oil brushing works wonders too

Thanks !

This was pretty good. Be sure to let your ingredients come to room temp before you use them. I didn't have a bread maker, so I just did it the traditional way. My husband didn't like it, though, so I'll probably not make it again.

Nice subtle touch from the anise - a relatively salty bread, though the salt was not overpowering at all, IMHO.  Wonderful with Cara's Moroccan Stew and Moroccan Mashed Potatoes (both also from this site).  My now 16 yo son especially enjoyed this bread, though I was personally a bit disappointed as I'm sure mine didn't come out quite right.  I did not have semolina flour and was in a hurry, so only used bread flour - and the gluten content was therefore higher than the recipe is designed to deal with.  As a result, the bread was more firm than I think it would have been otherwise..., I might even call it a tad tough, but it stood up to Cara's Moroccan stew quite stoutly..., perhaps a bit too stoutly.  I'll be experimenting with this recipe, using more and less whole wheat until I know how we'll prefer to make it in our home (I need whole wheat for the most part, as white flour tends to lean me hard towards blood sugar issues.....).  Thanks for the lovely recipe.  Oh! and the photo of the bread was inspiring.  My husband in particular enjoyed the designs put onto the bread using just a simple fork.  My daughter thought they were rather American Indian in nature, so I'll have to introduce her to the force, power, and beauty of African, geometric art.

if you use the metric measures instead of US, it calls for 9 grams of salt which unfortunately makes bread that is too salty to eat.

This bread was easy to make, but I don't know how it can be said to make 16 servings! I added dried onions bits and caraway seeds to the top and caraway seeds instead of anise seeds in the dough.  
It was heavier and denser than I expected, so I don't think I'd make it again.
