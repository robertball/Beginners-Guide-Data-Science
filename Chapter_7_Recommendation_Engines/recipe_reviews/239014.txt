I am a traditionalist when it comes to baking so I am always skeptical of "healthier alternatives" in recipes. This recipe absolutely impressed me! It was DELICIOUS!!! I followed the recipe as written except I used white flour instead of whole wheat flour. I made muffins/cupcakes instead of loaves. A single recipe made 12 muffins. Everyone raved about them all week!

I pureed the zucchini so my 5 yo wouldn't fuss, and I didn't have agave so I substituted sugar. Huge hit.

Very good.  Added carrot as recommended, nuts, and some white raisins for a little moisture and sweetness.

As a healthy version, surprisingly good.  I would have liked it to be a bit  lighter and might want to add some nuts and carrots next time.  I used frozen zucchini so that may have altered the outcome a bit. I will keep this as a perfect base and try adjusting.

This zucchini bread came out super moist and my 9 year old loved it!  The lemon adds a great flavor!!

Very moist and delicious! I made a lemon glaze (1 cup powdered sugar & juice of 1 lemon, mix) poured over. Yummy!!! I did use 1 regular sized loaf pan;  poured all batter in  and it came out awesome. Cooked for about 50mins 350 degree.  Also, added less than 1/4 cup reg sugar (just in case) and it is really unnecessary. I won't do that next time. Def naturally sweet enough! Enjoy

Fabulous recipe! Based on the other comments, I added 1/4 sugar and a grated carrot. Glad I did! It’s still not too sweet but just sweet enough. The lemon is a great addition! It adds a little citrus background that’s really good. Thank you for sharing!

Very good.  Didn't taste "healthy"  like some of the healthier recipes can.  I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat, but otherwise followed recipe.  I will make this again.

I made it exactly as written.   It was delicious.  Remade and put the loaf in the freezer.  I have 2 more giant Zucchinnis to use up, so will make muffins too.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe

Great flavor! I used honey instead of agave and Einhorn flour in place of ww flour. They turned out perfect and my kids gobbled them up. Super moist and the lemon-zucchini combo is on point.

This bread was very moist; I think the coconut oil and applesauce worked well.  It didn't rise as nicely as other zucchini breads I make. The flavor the first day it was made was just okay. I had added about 1/4 c of sugar to it in addition to the agave nectar. However, the next morning it tasted better, so I'm going to give it 4 stars instead of just 3. I definitely think it needs at least 3/4 cup of sweetner.
