These were actually pretty good. My husband loved them. They make a good quick lunch, especially for kids. Although i'd have to leave out the onions/peppers for my daughter, or she wont touch them! I think the one thing i might do to improve them would be to put a layer of cheese in the middle of the muffin (fill muffin tin halfway, put cheese, then fill the rest of the way) OR to put cheese on top of the muffin, as I coulnt really tell there was cheese in it because it was all mixed in with everything else. Overall a good, creative recipe and I will be making again. I think I'll experiment with different pizza "toppings"! Edit: After experimenting, the best way by far is to cube the mozzarella cheese (like 1/2 inch cubes). Also, its so much better if you omit the vegetables and put in sausage and pepperoni instead of ham.

These were ok, but I should have added much more cheese. I also wish I hadn't chopped everything up so small - everything kind of got lost in the mix.

These are great! I omited peppers and chillies.Used cheddar cheese (all I had). I had some extra cheese so I put it on top of several muffins and my husband said that those were even better. Definately a keeper.

My daughter made these muffins for her Home Ec class.  They were a hit!  She brought a few home and I agree.  They left the chilis out because she doesn't like spicy food.  They had a strong baking powder after taste to me, but I think maybe her partner added a little too much.  Her teacher is entering them into the state fair.  We'll see......

These were awesome. I followed the other reviewer's suggestion, and added extra cheese to the middle.
Had some leftover pizza sauce, so I warmed it up, and served it for dipping.
My grandson just loved them!!!

The adults said these are okay and the kids thought they were great. Of course, since I experimented with the ingredients, it might be unfair ot judge. We left out any peppers, as the kids don't care for them. We added a bit more cheese, too. We didn't use the warmed up pizza sauce, but I bet that would be good too.
