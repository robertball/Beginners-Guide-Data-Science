This was a really easy resipe, especially since I am an amateur baker!  I actually "veganized" this recipe by using soymilk and margarine instead, and they still worked out great!

I chose this recipe from many available online because it didn't contain a lot of sugar or honey.  This makes a nice savory roll when a little garlic powder and rosemary is added. I also brushed with olive oil instead of butter and salted the tops. Next time I might double the recipe to make sandwich rolls.
An easy recipe to follow and fast for a yeast bread.  Every element performed as expected and the result tastes very good.

I have been looking for an easy or quick whole wheat dinner roll recipe for several years, I guess I will have to continue looking. although the recipe is easy and quick, the resulting product leaves something to be desired, they were dry and a little doughy. I live at high altitude and I did not do any adjustments to the receipe, I wanted to try it with out adding extra this and that and adjusting the leavening. Next time I will try adjusting for altitude and do a follow-up review.

Very simple recipe and like the idea of mno molasses, but I think an egg was omitted from your recipe. This makes for a better roll. Tried both ways and the egg makes a great difference.

I use Robin Hood Multigrain flour and they turn out perfect.  The 1/2 white/whole wheat are rather bland.  I am not experienced enough with bread to know what to add or change to improve on the flavour for the original recipe (more salt?).  But with the multigrain flour they do not need any adjustment. Besides we love the crunchy grains.

the rolls were great, but your timing is off! You said that in total, this recipe is ready in 16 minutes, when it really takes over an hour and a half! You may want to fix this. I will always make this bread though, its very soft!

Very good, very easy, and very healthy! I used all whole wheat flour except for substituting 1/2 cup of wheat germ. I sweetened it with Splenda and used whole wheat yeast. They came out dense and delicious. Perfect with soup.

Balanced wheat taste and easy! Not too sweet and not overpowering on the wheat. Be creative and top with seasonings that appeal to you. We chose to sprinkle the butter (I used olive oil) tops with thyme and garlic powder. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this roll recipe with my Kitchen Aid mixer. I proofed the yeast with the warm water/milk and the three tablespoons sugar for ten minutes, then added the melted butter, salt and the flours. I did need a touch more flour to get the dough to form a firm enough ball to jump on the bread hook. I kneaded the dough for five minutes with the bread hook, then set it to rise for an hour in a covered greased bowl. I formed the dough into 1/3 cup bread balls and plopped them into greased muffin tins, covered them with plastic wrap and let them double again. Baked at 400*, these rolls were done at 12 minutes. I did NOT brush the rolls with the melted butter until they came out of the oven. This is a decent wheat roll recipe. It's just sweet enough without going overboard but it's a little lacking in flavor. For me, a wheat roll is much better when using honey for a sweetener or when there's an egg added. I don't know that I'd make this roll recipe again.

Amazing! This was my first attempt making homemade yeast rolls and this recipe was very simple and forgiving. The rolls were delicious and I wouldn't change a thing!

My boyfriend loves these rolls.  I add roasted garlic to the dough and top with kosher salt.  Makes a hearty roll.

All right - maybe good for a bread base in another recipe. I'll probably try other recipes before I ever come back to this one.

I doubled the recipe, but otherwise followed directions exactly. They were loved by the whole family, including the 2 that don't love wheat breads.  My husband told me to make sure that I bookmarked this recipe. It was perfect with our stew.

These were pretty good.  I am not very good at making bread, but they were pretty easy.  They didn't get quite as fluffy...they seemed a bit dense.  But the flavor was great.  I brushed with olive oil and sprinkled parsley and garlic salt on.  My husband and kids really enjoyed them.

They were good.  But they were a bit dry and did not raise very well.  I made white buns also, and they raised very well.

I was amazed.  I make a lot of homemade breads and rolls, but this recipe even exceeded my NO Knead Roll recipe from my mother-in-law.  They were light and delicate and very tasty.  I will be making these again  even when I'm not almost out of white flour like I was today.  Just a great recipe!

This was my first time to bake something with wheat flour, and because my family loves cinnamon rolls, I decided to make some using this recipe as the bread dough. I had to add more flour because my dough was too soggy, though. With all the alterations, my rolls came out great! My kids and husband loved them!

Made the rolls tonight,,not as tasty as I hoped. Kinda flat in taste. I think it needed molasses. I was able to taste way more of the real butter I spread on after baking then the roll its self.
