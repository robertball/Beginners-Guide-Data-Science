This recipe is a keeper; blondies with a salty twist. Made these for a church potluck, they travel well. I pulsed pretzel sticks in a food processor to crushed them (not pulverize). The smaller they are the more butter will get absorb, make a nice even crust and be less greasy. I expect these would be good with regular toll house chocolate chips if you can't find the caramel filled ones or don't want to fork out the $$, but you would be missing that something extra. Do try these if you like salty-sweet combinations.

I have made these twice for recent bake sales.  They are easy and super delicious.  I had several people ask for the recipe!

Made per recipe except I used milk chocolate chips as I couldnâ€™t find the chips in the recipe. I figured milk chocolate would be comparably sweet.

I looked at Wal Mart, Publix, and Target for the caramel filled chocolate morsels, but couldn't find them. So I found a bag of caramel balls and mixed them with the semi sweet. The pretzel crust probably needs more butter or something to make it stick together better.

These were so-so! The pretzel crust had a nice texture and taste but it really overtook the cookie bar part. They looked good, and didn't seem greasy though!
