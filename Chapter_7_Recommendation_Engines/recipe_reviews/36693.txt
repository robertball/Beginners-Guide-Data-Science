Well, this is a very quick recipe..The apple chutney is good,but it didn't really seem to go with the turkey flavor. It's an easy recipe and fairly inexpensive, something I would make once in a while, but we weren't crazy about it. Perhaps the apple chutney would pair better w/a pork chop/pork roast.

This dish is really good!  The apple chutney makes it good.  I baked the turkey in the apple chutney...I was afraid of dry meat!  It was very easy to make and the whole family enjoyed it.

This was really good.  It reminded me of a pork recipe, and I think you could use the chutney over pork chops with excellent results. There was not enough vinegar to really be noticeable,  and I used molasses as a replacement for the brown sugar since I was out. The one thing I learned was to never again use store-formed turkey cutlets,  but to make them myself.  My cutlets were tough... the first time I've ever had tough turkey! Anyway, great recipe for the coming Autumn months.

My husband didn't really like this recipe from the first bite and that is highly unusual; he's the least picky eater I've ever encountered.  As for myself, I found that the more I ate it, the less I liked it.  There was way too much chutney for the amount of turkey.  I won't be making this recipe again.

My husband and I thought that this dish was awful. I think the vinegar is what ruined the meal. I don't think I'll make this agian.
