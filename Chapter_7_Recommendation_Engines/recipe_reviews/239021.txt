Never made sushi rolls of any type before, but bought the needed utensils and have this a try. They were GREAT! My boys even liked them! Definitely going to use this for next get together.

I like it, but the guys loved it! I used leftover cooked chicken breast in place of the breaded tenders. Nice, mild flavor. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
