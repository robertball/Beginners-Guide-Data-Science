I'm the person who submitted this recipe, and I've done a lot of tweaking to it. The past several times I've made this, I've cut way back on the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I like it really spicy, but the 4 peppers and 1/4 cup of adobo sauce is quite spicy for most people. I usually tone it down to 1 pepper and about a tablespoon or two of the sauce and it still has a nice bite to it.

HUGE hit! Super spicy-I needed a chaser:) Unintentionally, I left out the dill completely. I'd probably do it again-it was perfect without! I made my own horseradish mustard w/dijon mustard & horseradish sauce.

This is SUPER GOOD! I did have to make some adjustments based on what I had, as this was a last minute decision... I had no fresh red or green peppers, but I did have jarred roasted red peppers, so I used those. Used sweet onion in place of red (had none on hand). I did reduce the amount of chipotles and adobo sauce, as per the submitters review, because my little guy was eating this too, whhich ended up being the perfect amount of heat for us, and I had to use dried dill because I had no fresh. This had a wonderfully different flavor from any other potato salads that I've had. I am a lover of chipotle, so I knew this was gonna be a hit, and it was...my little guy had 2 helpings! Thanks for this delicious new way to make potato salad. I will be making it often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow. This one kinda took words out of my mouth. Time consuming? A little....Worth it? YES.  I just made this this afternoon...can't go wrong making a recipe like this on a Sunday afternoon.  I also took others advice and cut back on the peppers and sauce. I'm truly blown away. Could almost cry over it. For real. Thanks for the recipe!! :)

Best potato salad I have ever had. Followed the suggestion on lessening the chipotles/sauce; Definitely still plenty of heat. Had to sub 1 cup of the mayo for nonfat plain yogurt and a little olive oil. Turned out great.

Made this a month ago and LOVED IT! Admittedly, I didn't add the dill  'cause it sounded weird with chipotle and adobo. Made it again today and wanted to rate it but didn't think I should without a key ingredient, so with much trepidation, I put in some dry dill. It was even better!

I'm not a big fan of potato salad, but this was actually pretty good. My family and I all had seconds!

I added 2 more chipotle peppers (and the whole 5 lb bag of russet potatoes) than the recipe called for  and we enjoyed it oh so much. Husband usually cooks but I wanted to get back in the kitchen groove and am so glad I did. It paired well with salmon and fresh lemonade.

This was a nice change of pace.  I didn't have horseradish mustard so I mixed some horseradish into regular mustard.  Not sure I got that right as the horseradish taste was strong, even though we like it.  I was making this on a Sunday evening so I'd have it ready for a Monday dinner.  For the sake of time I didn't roast the peppers and onion.  We liked the crunch without roasting, though I know roasting would give it some deeper flavor.  I will try this again when I can have the time to prep the veggies and be sure to have horseradish mustard on hand.

Absolutely, without a doubt the best potato salad that I have ever had. The only changes I made were those suggested by the author to reduce the number of chipotle peppers and sauce. Other than that, don’t change a thing. My family raved over this winner!

As I didn’t have all ingredients on hand, I used the following, ordinary mustard, Thai sweet chili sauce, dried dill, some paprika pepper and Adobo seasoning.I didn’t want it too hot either. I halfed the amounts too, as it was just too much for a first try. I didn’t have horseradish or the adobo pepper as mentioned. It turned out good, and my mum who is really hard to pleased loved it.

Loved the idea of this flavor combination, but the chipotle pepper flavor overtook the dill and horseradish.  We also found it to be a little heavy on the amount of dressing.

OMSmoky Spicy goodness, I love this recipe and so did everyone at my Kentucky Derby Party. I subbed plain yogurt for the mayo (extra tang) and added roasted red bells instead of fresh (added smoke flavor). WTG April, thanks for sharing!

Haven't taken it to the cookout yet but just tasting it I loved it! This was my first time making it and I went ahead and dialed down the peppers. I too like it very spicy but my dad can't handle too much spice. I also used Serrano peppers instead of Chipotle after spending forever in the store trying to find them with no luck!  Hopefully it will be a hit with the family!
