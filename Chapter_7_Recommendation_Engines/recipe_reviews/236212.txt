I was looking for another recipe when I stumbled across this one. Seeing that I had all the ingredients, I decided to try a batch. Wow, are these good!!! I can't believe how simple they are. To prevent the honey from sinking to the bottom of the chocolate, here is what you do. Mix the oil and cocoa powder. Stick this mixture in the fridge until it starts to thicken. Now you can stir in the honey and it won't 'sink' because the coconut oil is no longer liquified. I added a little less than 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, and a couple pinches of chipotle powder. I didn't have candy molds or a pliable tray, so I lined a small plastic container with foil. Once hardened, I was able to lift everything out of the container and cut into 8 pieces. Heavenly!!!

This chocolate is delicious, but I did have to switch up how I made it. I kept the ingredients exactly the same, but I tried this recipe three times, and the third time was the keeper! I know other reviewers said they also had the problem of the honey sinking to the bottom. When I tried the recipe, I tried the trick that others had given, to cool the mixture a little in the fridge before adding the honey, so that they consistency of the cocoa/oil mixture and the honey was similar. However, the first time, the honey sank to the bottom. The second time, I tried another suggestion, and heated the honey first, to give it the same consistency as the coconut oil. That batch was better, but it still had some honey on the bottom.  The third time, I did not melt the coconut oil, but kept it as a soft solid. I mixed in the cocoa, and the honey and vanilla, which made a thick paste-like consistency. Then I heated that on the stove-top, just enough so that the cocoa powder dissolved and it was smooth. Then I poured it into a foil lined dish and put it in the fridge. Perfect! The texture is amazing...so smooth. It is  great if you like dark chocolate. I added a little cinnamon to mine.

This was surprisingly good!  I used a whisk to mix the cocoa, honey and vanilla into the melted coconut oil,  then poured it into a foil-lined loaf pan (this size pan created the perfect thickness) and sprinkled in some toasted pecans.  Chilled for about 1 1/2 hours, popped the foil out and cut the chocolate into pieces.  Very creamy and definitely melt-in-your-mouth!  Will make this again and again!  Great recipe for a healthy treat!

I tried this not knowing what to expect. I loved it! In addition to the honey, I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of Agave nectar, I like it a little bit sweeter. Finally I added 1/2 tsp of sea salt and 1/3 C chopped almonds. Fabulous! I only made mine 1/4" thick and I didn't have a problem with the honey sinking to the bottom, as i read in another review. Thank you for the recipe!

Delicious just as written! But I have also played around with the recipe and I found that adding a tiny bit of sea salt makes this great recipe even a bit better. (Salt really brings out the sweetness in candies and chocolates!). I also have made this with almond extract and even coffee extract and I've added nuts and coconut. It is a great recipe that easily allows you to add your own special touches, or just make as written for a simple, delicious treat.

We love this, although the last time we made them, I used raw cacao butter instead of coconut oil as I had only liquid coconut oil and didn't know if it would set properly.  And oh my!  This batch was KILLER!  Full chocolate flavor, and it rivals my all-time fave, Scharffen-Berger.  I always add vanilla, and I use only 2 TBS honey since we like bittersweet chocolate.  Be sure to use cocoa you really like in this!

This "Homemade Melt-In-Your-Mouth Dark Chocolate (Paleo)" is out-of-this-world delicious! Oh my goodness! I used flavorless "refined" organic coconut oil (not "virgin" coconut oil) since I don't like the characteristic fruity taste of coconut oil in most recipes. My coconut oil was liquid at room temperature, so I wasn't going to bother to heat it. I found that the honey kept separating from the coconut oil when I tried to mix them at room temperature. Then I remembered something I learned in chemistry class: liquids are more soluble at higher temperatures. I heated the honey and oil together and they still didn't mix together very well (although better). Then I remembered something I learned in English class: read the instructions! Everything mixed together well when I followed the instructions. I put my organic dutch-processed cocoa powder through a sieve to make sure that it was free of all lumps. I also made my chocolates in a paper-lined mini-muffin tin (yield: 12). Important Tip: I found it much easier to remove my chocolates from the mini-muffin tin when they were freshly set after 1 hour of refrigeration (easy removal) rather than after they were well hardened (pry out with a knife). Thank you Linda (LMT) for sharing your recipe.

Made this twice now and it is really very good.  The first batch I made with some ground cayenne and the second time I made separate 1/2 batches with fresh mint leaves (I let the leaves rest with the melted mixture for a bit) and coconut flakes sprinkled in at the end right before pouring into the moulds, each was delicious.  I didn't have any issues with the honey/oil separation.  I actually melted them all together over super low heat then let the mixture cool a bit before pouring into silicone moulds.  I used wildflower honey (very thick and very flavourful) in the first batch and it overrode the flavour a bit much.  In one half I used acacia (very light flavour and very liquid) and the second half I used orange blossom honey (almost solid and only a hint of flowers) and let it melt. The honey was less evident in both of these.  All three solidified very well.  Definitely keep in the fridge.  These melt-in-your-mouth but also in your warm fingers!  Just a good reason to eat them quickly!  Will update a picture ASAP.

I tried this recipe and not sure if it was just first time bad luck but all the coconut oil stayed on top of the mold and the honey sunk to the bottom. So what I was left with was a chocolate that only tasted good on the bottom. I may try again though.

At 76 F and below coconut oil is a solid and at 77 F and above it is liquid,so you will need to mix it,cool it,mix it as it gets thicker and then keep in the frig.
I made this for my wife this afternoon and she loved it. It is quick, fast, simple and easy. Ya gotta love it.

I found this recipe when looking for Paleo options. I had the ingredients and made half a batch to try it. It was great and tasted like healthy creamy chocolate.

I saw some comments about the honey sinking to the bottom, so I put the honey in after the chocolate mixture was in the refrigerator for around 15 minutes.  The honey didn't sink to the bottom.  If you're going to try to put the honey in after it has been in the refrigerator for a little bit, I would suggest checking about every 5 minutes, to make sure you don't miss the perfect time to add the honey.

I made several variations of this.  I added a couple drops of mint extract and fresh mint...delicious!  Raspberries, orange, coconut, almonds...all wonderful!!  I used coconut nectar and stevia instead of Agave or honey.

I found this searching for recipes that work with my son's allergies, and I love it! Easy and delicious, and soy- free so my son can eat it! I heated up the honey before adding it to the coconut oil and cocoa powder, then put the chocolates in the freezer to set faster and didn't have trouble with mixing or separation.

You cannot beat the flavour of this chocolate!!!! I added chopped pecans and a bit of sea salt after I poured them into a foil lined mini muffin tin (made 12).  I also used a sieve with the cocoa to remove any lumps. Thx to reviewer Mrs.J for those tips. I did have issues with the honey separating and going to the bottom and not setting properly. I will have to play around with that one and maybe try reviewer LilSnoo's idea. Either way, they were to die for! I will make them again. I may even try carob powder next time just for a change. Thanks Linda(LMT)! Love your recipe!

This is my favorite recipe. I now add coconut flakes to the bottom of the container then I drizzle my chocolate on top and let it set. It's like a dark chocolate Mounds bar and its so good I hide it from T. ??

I too had the problem with the coconut staying on the top, but it was only a coating. I doubled the recipe, but forgot to double the honey. That ended up not being a problem since I added crystallized ginger to the recipe. I will be playing with this a little more, especially to make peanut butter cups. I love that it is a no guilt sweet.

I love this chocolate!  The first time I made it, I thought it was perfect.  The second (and third) batch, I added sea salt and found that the honey separated.  It was still very good, but the same issue others have faced.  When I went back to the original recipe, it came out perfect, again.  I wonder if adding additional ingredients, specifically salt, makes it separate.

OMG!!!!!!  This is heaven....and just the perfect sweetness. I have never made candy before ever.....seen this in my mail box yesterday and since I had all the ingredients....I just made it today. JUST as the recipe said....I didn't have a problem with the coconut oil either. I added some minced up crystallized ginger....WOW! I just used foil lined in a plastic container...it was ready in about an hour...took it out and it's the perfect thickness....I've got about 16 pieces. (Maybe I won't share....)

Oh my gosh, so easy and so awesome. I added chopped roasted and salted almonds to the whole batch, then coconut to the last half of the batch, then a pecan on top to the last third of the batch. they were so tasty, we had to hide them in the refrigerator in the garage to avoid finishing the whole thing. And I made a double batch to begin with. Definitely a keeper.

PERFECT as written ~ I used Hersheys Special Dark Cocoa Powder and just a tiny pinch of regular salt.  My Hubby loved letting the chocolate melt in his mouth and get that 'surprise' of the salt!  I used a clear candy mold & they popped out easily. Paleo is the way to go for us from now on!!

Yum! Delish. I wasn't sure what it was going to taste like but it's very, very good. I added some Vietnamese cinnamon. Next time I'm going to add chopped nuts. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Calculated Nutrition Information!

I made this exactly as written except I added a small pinch of salt. I let it set up in the fridge for 20 minutes before adding the honey, as some have suggested. I haven't checked for separation (hasn't been in the fridge long enough) but my eyes rolled in the back of head a little just licking the spoon! I know now what I'm making for Christmas goodie giveaways! So easy!                        1g

I used this to make almond butter and pecan butter cups. I make my own nut butters. This was perfect and awesome.

This is the best vegan dark chocolate recipe ever, I have tried others and they are not nearly as good. I. Used this recipe for my peanut butter cups because all the other chocolate recipe that are with the peanut butter cup recipes stink, at least what I have made. This is DELICIOUS!

I also followed a fellow review who stated to mix everything together in a paste then melt, and she was right no problem with the honey separating at all.

I will make this again and again!!

Thank you so much for this recipe. Excellent and super easy. I used 1/4 cup organic coconut oil and 1/4 organic cacao butter for the 1/2 cup oil. Everything else as instructed but added a very small pinch of Himalayan sea salt. I have since made two variations one with almonds and organic shredded coconut and one with organic peanut butter. This is my now my HG go to recipe for yummy chocolate cravings.

Awesome and easy recipe.  I've made 9 batches in 3 days!  I'm addicted to making and eating this.  I added different flavorings.  Added mint choc. Chips.  ; orange zest, almonds and coconut, hazel nuts, peanuts, peanut butter.  All in different batches.  What I did notice was that when I used plastic molds I had no issues with separation of the honey as many have complained about. I bought some silicone molds and viola, I have separation:( so only plastic for me, it's harder to remove but at least they solidify completely.

I've made this a couple of times now.  The last batch I added chopped almonds and a little coconut because I love texture.  A small piece in the evenings tastes so delightful, and I love the fact that it's not sinful to have a little indulgence!

This is absolutely delicious!  All the delights of bittersweet chocolate without the refined sugar.  The first batch I made according to the recipe, the next batch I added 3 tablespoons of powdered peanut butter.  Both ways were terrific!  I will be making this often. :-)

Unfortunately the recipe did not work out like I hoped. Now I try to finde out why the ingredients did not combine with the coconut oil. Maybe to much heat in the oil? I live in the tropics and I am wondering if I need to heat the oil at all even our coconut oil is always liquid? I will try it again but not before I found an reasonable explanation. Maybe somebody out there can help me on this. Still think it's a nice recipe and the picture of this recipe looks realy good to me.

Greasy and Bitter! Everything blended well so thought we had a winner. Plus, after an hour in the fridge they looked amazing. Definitely not sweet enough not even for dark chocolate, and they were very greasy. Definitely won't make this again.

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious. I had no trouble with adding the honey just as the recipe said. I added 2 tablespoons peanut butter and a little coarse salt. My whole family loved it and we will definitely make again!

Super easy recipe and incredibly delicious! I added a little sprinkle of sea salt to mine for a variation and it was amazing! Love that this recipe uses honey rather than granulated sugar.  Still high calories, but nice option for an indulgent sweet to eat in moderation that doesn't have all the additives of processed foods.  You could probably add even less honey and it would still be good.

It was wonderful - as tasty and tempting as any high priced chocolate.
I added chopped pecans and delicious!!! However,  I would appreciate knowing the calories, protein (if any) and other nutritional facts.

So good!! Was craving chocolate and this was the ticket. As mentioned by other reviewers the honey does sink to the bottom. I unfortunately did not get to them quick enough in the fridge to stir them but they were still delicious! Definitely cured my chocolate craving.

I made it exactly as stated, only doubling all the ingredients, and it is not sweet enough, as written. Very liquidity, and a complete waste of ingredients!

I am rather disappointed, because I was making this for a child who is lactose intolerant.

Hot ! Super yummy! I used cacao powder (mhm, it's diff. from cocoa powder: less processed; more nutrients), and only 1/4 c. coconut oil, yet next time I'll add the 1/2c. to have thinner chocolate. I heated up the honey (to prevent this scare of sinking honey, which worked), then whisked it in. Also, I omitted the extract, and added a pinch of sea salt. Bam! Super delicious nutritious chocolate. :)

Fantastic and amazing. I purchased a chocolate block mould just for this recipe. So far I have made fruit and nut, nuts raisins and raisins, peppermint, orange, strawberry and lemon flavours. All relish. So glad I can always have chocolate in the house now. I'm going to try caramel and lemon curd flavours next. THANK YOU

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I did make a few changes though.
First, I added less coconut oil (as recommended in another review), using about 1/4 a cup. I use refined, organic coconut oil if that makes any difference.
Also, I used 2 tbsp of honey and 1 tbsp of maple syrup. The sweetness of it is perfect! Not bitter at all.
I kept mixing as it cooled to prevent any separation and it worked.
I then cut a banana in half, put a chopstick in each (had to substitute lol), covered them with the soft chocolate, sprinkled them with chopped almonds and put it in the freezer.
The rest of the chocolate was put into a music ice mold I've never previously used and popped into the fridge. Some peices have almonds as well.
It set in less than half an hour but it does start to melt in your hands so they're best kept in the fridge until ready to eat.
My husband and I will be eating the bananas tomorrow. Can't wait! ^_^

I just finished making this and let me just say YUM!!!! I love it.  I used the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I did take other reviewers advice and put the coconut oil and cocoa mixture in the fridge for about 15 minutes.  When I added the honey and started mixing it I used a wire whisk which helped to cool everything down quicker and gave it a little fluffy creamy texture.  I spooned it into a foil lined baking dish and spread it out.  It looked very similar to whipped frosting.  The flavor is so delicious...a little bitter with some sweetness and a hint of coconut as it melts in your mouth. I will be making this from now on instead of buying store bought chocolate.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This looks great! When you say "Must be kept refrigerated", does that mean indefinitely? I was thinking of making some for gifts, but they would have to travel for a few hours.

This is a wonderful way to consume my daily tablespoon of coconut oil.   I use power level 5 to  soften the coconut oil in the microwave.  Then I just throw the other ingredients into the bowl and mix it up.

I like to make 1/4 of this recipe, then mix in a packet of instant oatmeal for a snack. It satisfies that craving for chocolate without being fattening. :-)

So good!  Added maybe a tblsb of agave sweetener and a pinch of sea salt.  Then put in plastic container about 8x8 lined with foil in fridge. When almost set sprinkled seat salt on top!  Perfection.

Very yummy!  I read the reviews about the honey sinking, so I placed the pot in the fridge for about 20 min after mixing all ingredients.  After it began to thicken, I stirred it for a few min, added walnuts, and placed it in a plastic container lined with foil, then back in the fridge.  It's rich enough that a little piece goes a long way.

Great recipe! I used agave instead of honey (same amount) and found it easy to mix together, since the agave is a much thinner syrup. Tastes amazing, and love it with almonds, pumpkin seeds, or unsweetened coconut. Filing this under go-to recipes for my chocolate craving! I'm nursing and my daughter has a milk protein allergy, so this is the perfect solution for a chocolate-loving mama!

I made this and added toasted coconut & chopped almonds. Then sprinkled some coarse kosher salt on top when it was in the pan.  It is fabulous, especially if you love coconut as much as I do.  Plan to make it again since I've shared it with so many people I have none left!

Followed the advice of other reviews on how to keep the honey from settling. Didn't work. Trying to get that balance right is too much effort for a recipe that doesn't even taste good.

I found it to be delicious! I’ve never made chocolate before and it was very easy. I took someones’s advice and mixed all the ingredients together first (used a teaspoon of vanilla), and then I gently heated it and stirred it until all the chocolate was dissolved and it was smooth. It only took a minute or two. I used a silicone mat in my small baking pan. After refrigerating it until it set up softly, I scored it so it would break into even pieces when I took it out of the pan. That worked great! I will be making this again. It does melt in your mouth!

Too greasy for my stomach, it is like eating oil and lacks body. It really melts the oil in your mouth and you miss the body of the bonbons.

I heated the honey and the mixture was ok, so no problem doing it.

When made with only coconut oil, the resulting chocolates were too soft at a room temperature of 68° F after 2 hours in a refrigerator (set to typical mid-range cold temperature).  Made with cacao butter instead, they produced a nice "bark" style sheet of chocolates (including some chopped dried cherries), which I broke into irregular bite-size pieces. I can see using the Allrecipes recipe as-is for the filling of a chocolate truffle. It's important to be sure that the temperature for the  melted fat does not get above about 110° F.

The texture was phenomenal. Sooo creamy and decadent. However, too bitter for me taste wise. You MUST love bittersweet dark chocolate in order to enjoy these

I needed to change the wat I mix the thing, so this can help if you're having trouble mixing. 
Melt the oil, pour the honey/syrup (i did a bit of both) and stir until honey is melted (on low heat). Pour the liquid into a blender/mixer and mix until it's even and the syrup/honey doesn't sink (it did for me). Thank pour the liquid back into the saucepan, put on low heat and gently mix in the cocoa powder, adding it little by little.
I think I lost some oil in the process so there was more cocoa than liquid. I gently added some oil until the scent wasn't that strong. That resulted in a bit of coconut oil being in the chocolate but i was planning to use it as a candy so it's good with me.
10/10, extremely tasty.

I love this recipe. I had no problems whatsoever with the honey. The only thing I changed was adding a pinch of salt.  I may reduce the honey to 2 tbsp next time to see if I like it with less :)  I will be using this recipe a lot because they are so good...may have to make "special" chocolates for holiday gifts too, LOL

I didnt do it the way that they said.  In all of the reviews it says all the honey sunk and the coconut oil floated. Not my way. Everything should be at room temperature and mix them all together. Put the mixture in a freezer or blast chiller. This works and all of the ingredients are well mixed together even after freezing.

Made this recipe as a fun family project and it worked out pretty well. Even though we had similar issues to other people with the sugary ingredients settling at the bottom, it still tasted great (especially with nuts!) Worth trying!

Simple and easy to make! I wasn’t lookin for paleo-specific recipes, but this tastes great and is a good way to use “green infused ” coconut oil! I keep the chocolates in the freezer for months and they keep very well.

Made this for the second time using cocoa butter instead of coconut oil. No separation problems like I had with the coconut oil (try 1).  Using chocolate molds with the coconut oil helped vs the ones I made in a pan. They cooled quicker, which might be part of the original problem. Either way this recipe is delicious! Thanks so much for posting!!

I just made this. added slivered almonds and walnut chunks to pan, then poured coconut oil/cocoa/honey/vanilla hot mixture over it.
OMG!!! and divide it up so it works with the 21 day fix menu plan. (one yellow and 2 teaspoons).

This was incredible! I followed the instructions in a review from "momtotwo Monument" which said that to keep the honey from sinking to the bottom you could keep the coconut oil as a soft solid and add in the other ingredients before putting over heat and letting melt until the cocoa has dissolved and mixture is smooth. I will be making this again, it is so simple and so simply delicious and decadent!

One time while making this (I've made it loads of times lol) there were no saucepans clean (welcome to a house with seven people in it haha) so I decided to improvise and microwave. Instead of batter being homogeneous, parts were clumped and parts were watery. It still tasted fine, just looked a little funky, the parts that had been clumped looked like the chocolate should and the parts that had been watery were a really light brown. I would recommend using a saucepan and following instructions in above paragraph and melting on stovetop over microwaving for absolute best results but microwaving is sufficient enough as well.

I wanted to make Chocolate Lava Cakes, with no chocolate in my cupboards and way to lazy to go to the shops! So I got to Google, and came across this!
Wow, wow, WOW! These are amazing! Even my husband who hates dark chocolate, LOVED these and was stealing them from the fridge all night lol!
The Lava Cakes were never made as hubby ate all the chocolates.

Very easy to make and personalize.  One note I made for the future - add the cocoa by itself - LAST - and get ready to pour as soon as mixed.  When I added the flavoring (peppermint in this case), the chocolate seized and I had trouble pouring it.  Still tasted yummy - but didn't have that nice shine.  Melting and incorporating the coconut oil, honey, and flavoring in a double boiler allows me to stir until absolutely smooth.

Good, good, good. Added almond slices. Microwaved honey for a few seconds to have it mix better with the other ingred and did not have layer of coconut oil like some others did. Also used healthier dark cocoa powder to feel less guilty about eating chocolate. Almost guilt free!! 2nd batch added finely chopped raisins , good.   5 year old grandchild insisted on adding peanut butter today and she scooped it into mold. Waiting on results.

I made this as directed, and it was wonderful. The consistency was slightly softer than store-bought chocolate, but I don’t mind in the least. So fast and easy! Thank you for a great recipe!

This was just ok for me.  Not sure I would make it again.  It tastes really good when you first bite into it but then it leaves an “oily” aftertaste.  Possibly that’s just the case with using coconut oil.

I made it as I am not fond or the usual kind of chocolates. I actually am fond of bitter cocoa. The recipe was fast and easy. I added a handful of coconut. I thought it was netter than a usual candybar.  Simple and quick to make.

Very good! 
I keep the chocolate in the freezer and use an ice cube tray as a mold and it works fine. 
I added chocolate and that has made it a favorite in the family :)

Made this just as listed and it turned out perfect. The honey didn’t sink to the bottom I did use a whisk. I used a bread pan lined in foil as others suggested and the thickness is just right. I do sometimes add some chopped almonds and/or sea salt...more for preference of other family members and to change it up a bit.

Soooo good! I have been buying Green & Black organic 85%dark chocolate to satisfy my sweet tooth. I love the taste of sea salt with chocolate and could not find any very dark chocolate with sea salt. This was the first recipe I saw when I searched. I had the ingredients on hand and decided to try it.  I added some sea salt , walnuts, almonds and coconut that I had on hand.  I only added 1 Tbsp of honey at first to see if it would be enough.  I was surprised that it was and tasted so good.  I think the sea salt definitely adds to the flavor, and therefore did not need to add more honey!  Thank you! Definitely a keeper.  The store bought chocolate is so expensive and this recipe will be fun to try different ingredients.

These are great! I made them yesterday and then made them again today for my grandparents coming over. Will make them so many times.

Edit: Just made these for the fifth time and put a bunch of different fillings!!! Doubled the recipe and made three with coconut, three with toasted walnuts, 2 with almond butter, and two with blackberry jam. So looking forward to eating them Thursday!!!

I added another tablespoon of Maple Syrup, a teaspoon of coconut sugar, salted it after I poured it in my loaf pan to cool (afterthought, next time I'll stir it in), and added some crushed almonds.  Delicious!  Even my 11 year old daughter loves it (had to sweeten it past the dark chocolate bitter taste they don't like).

I make this A LOT!! though, there's no need to use a stove, simply melt coconut oil in microwave, the. mix in the coco or cacao powder & sweeten with whatever you like, eg, maple, fruit or agave syrup..always taste before you set it though

This is a great guilt free treat, will make again for sure! After reading comments, I kept the coconut oil solid and mixed it in that way. I only had a little bit of oil hardened on top after refrigerating (I just scraped it off). Freeze well.

The honey gives it a bit of a fruity kick--absolutely the best and easiest homemade chocolate I've tried. Be sure to get the coconut oil very warm before adding it, work quickly and keep stirring every now and then as it cools. This keeps the honey from all sinking to the bottom.

My wife and I were both shocked at how good this chocolate is!  It doesn't get any easier than this recipe.  I chilled the pan a bit in ice water, to cool it down and then spooned the chocolate into various small plastic molds, put in the freezer for a short bit and instant great chocolate!  Thanks!!!

I LOVE this chocolate!  Some have said the honey settled on the bottom, but if you watch the video, you will see to wait for the chocolate to thicken (about 1/2 hr. before adding the honey, and then put in fridge.  I put  pecan pieces on bottom of loaf pan, then poured chocolate over it. (I also used 5 tbs. of honey) Then I sprinkled Chia seeds and hemalayan salt on top just before I put in fridge... IT REALLY IS SO YUMMY!

Absolutely fantastic! I am in the middle of the AIP, and needed a sweet pick-me-up, and this fits the bill! Super easy to make, I used paper cups in my mini-muffin tin, and got a dozen chocolates, plus some extra I put into a lined loaf pan. This will be my go-to chocolate fix!

I melted the oil in the microwave on low, then added the other ingredients. It was fast and very good. I also added some hot pepper oil to half a batch to give it some zing. It was great.

I was surprised at how delicious these are! I tried another recipe and it failed almost immediately. In a sinch I used 1/2 cup powdered sugar as well. They were wonderful. I added nuts, caramel, coconut to the middles.

I made this right when I was having a craving for chocolate but did not want to be "bad" Since I had all the ingredients on hand, I thought why not. I added a tablespoon of Diatomaceous Earth (DE) to mine as an added benefit, and it actually helped keep the ingredients smooth and not separated. I added some ginger powder, cinnamon and sea salt for complexity and I am in LOVE! Will keep this as a staple recipe :-)

Made this for the first time tonight. A few bites were really bitter, but for the most part it was enjoyable. I'm sure it was the honey not mixing like others had mentioned. Substituted mint extract for the vanilla and it had a Junior Mints/York Peppermint Patty taste. I'll

I used to dip strawberries! Excellent and healthier alternative for your chocolate dipped treats! I did cool the mix and added a bit more honey and whisked. I will use this recipe again! I used cacao that I bought in the Dominican and virgin coconut oil.

I made it, did not turn out, coconut oil seperated from cocoa mixture. I put in more cocoa powder and it creamed up a bit, but when I poured it in the pan, it seperated again. Oh well, at least I'm not out tons of ingredients. Seems to need some tweaking a bit.

I added coconut flakes and almonds to mimick an Almond Joy. I also used a muffin pan lined with paper cups. This worked well. It was a bit sweet so next time I will try less honey. A versatile recipe that can be used for a variety of chocolaty needs.

So delicious. Mine also separated maybe I didn't use enough carob powder. They were still delicious. I also added in unsweetened dried coconut and sea salt! AMAZING!!! I used pure maple syrup instead of honey because I have a ton and am low on honey. I used slightly less syrup since it is sweeter to me than honey and I am trying to lower my carb intake. Great with a cup of tea after kiddos go to bed!

I left out the vanilla as it didn't seem to set up well and it was delicious.  I didn't melt the coconut oil, just mixed cocoa in well then added honey.  Poured into molds and when hardened I put in the freezer and they are delicious treats!

So good. I was afraid the honey would sink to the bottom as some other reviews so I mixed the ingredients in the pan then turned the heat on. I added caramel to the middle and added a little bit more honey to make it sweeter.

I don't eat sugar at all, so I tried to make this chocolate using Stevia powder, instead of honey. First I added 1 tbsp of Stevia, then while stirring and tasting it, added a little more.
After it cooled down, I crushed it and used it to bake sugar free chocolate chip cookies with it. The smaller pieces melted into the batter a little, the bigger ones stayed in whole,  and my cookies turned out perfect! Thank you for sharing this easy recipe!

I was looking for a "healthier" rice crispy recipe and this worked perfectly mixed with unsweetened rice flakes.

I made this in the Thermomix (chocolate ingredients in together for 3 mins @ 80C; speed 1) and it worked perfectly. Stirred through about 150g rice flakes and refrigerated for perfect crispy cakes.

This is a very tasty recipe!  I substituted erythritol for the honey to make it low carb.  I made the recipe as written otherwise, and it was amazing!  It fits perfectly in a chocolate bar mold.  I made two other bars, one substituting the vanilla for peppermint extract, and the other for raspberry extract.  Both turned out just as yummy!

Here in South Fla I don't need to melt the coconut oil!   However, you can't let these out for very long before they get messy.  It does take a LOT of stirring to incorporate the Honey.  I have heated the oil for 30 seconds in microwave and that cutdown the stir time to incorporate the Honey.     If I leave this out of fridge the cocoa pwd end up on bottom, stir it up and it's was fine.  Once in Fridge or Freezer it sets up fast.

Also, I use this to make peanut butter cups.  peanut filling, 1 whole banana, 1/2 cup peanut butter, teaspoon of coconut oil (more is needed).

I was cautious about this recipe since I read reviews that said it wouldn't solidify or that it was really greasy, so I made it and reduced the amount of coconut oil very slightly. I also used maple syrup (around 3 and 3/4 tablespoons) instead of honey. At the end I added around two tablespoons of milk out of curiosity, and the mixture kind-of solidified. I'm not sure if this was because of the milk or because I kept it on the heat too long, but it stayed semi-solid even even without being frozen. I had to scrape it out of the pan. It looked terrible but tasted great. However, you probably won't like it if you dislike dark chocolate.

These are so addictive! I've tried different combinations with instant coffee( 1Tbsp/half cup coconut oil) , peanut butter, and mint. I chill after mixing for a couple of minutes to stiffen up a bit then just drop onto parchment paper and chill the rest of the way. Then keep in the fridge in a container.

Oh my goodness!  Thanks for posting this recipe.  Wonderful!  This was my first time making dark chocolate candies.  After reading all of the reviews, I incorporated a few changes.   I put the coconut oil in a stainless steel bowl, and melted it in a double boiler so I didn't have to worry about scorching the mixture. I added the cocoa powder, honey and vanilla extract.  After mixing all of the ingrediants with a whisk, I cooled the mixture slightly and reheated.  After adding the honey, I added some sea salt and peppermint extract.  During this process, I cooled the reheated the mixture several times.  The next time I make this, I am going to use Maple syrup.   Loved this!

I was looking for a good dark chocolate recipe and picked this one, based on all the great reviews...I must say, it was so dry and chalky in my mouth. The sweetness factor was on the low end, but it was ok, considering it's a dark chocolate. The kiddos tried it (dark chocolate lovers too) and they  very much so disliked it. Perhaps a refined coconut oil through things off?  I wanted to love it!! I have resorted to adding it to my coffee to give it a little chocolate kick. My search for a chocolate recipe continues.

This recipe is amazing! I love chocolate, but the kind I normally eat is very unhealthy. So thankful for the recipe because it totally changes things. I only added a little more honey and powdered peanut butter. I love PB and chocolate combinations!

I made this with some candy molds I had and it was delicious. I added a bit of sea salt because I love it with dark chocolate. I will definitely make this anytime I need a chocolate fix!

I made this for my grandparents, and they liked it.  I did have a problem with honey sinking to the bottom. So I think the remedy to that would be to leave it in the freezer for a little bit; then add the honey on-top later.  Not sure how that would work, or if it would even work. The only thing that I would say is, when you make this; don't expect a dark chocolate bar that you get at the gas station.  It's very rich, but yet good.

I followed the recipe with two changes. Instead of just using coconut oil, I used a 1/4 cup  food grade cocoa butter and 1/4 cut coconut oil. I also added toasted pistachios and toasted coconut. It was delicious! I didn't have the separation problem: I was careful not let the oil get too hot (I used low heat).

As the recipe promises, the chocolate really melts the moment it meets your mouth. I'm a chocoholic and had doubts about the result but it turned out great and it's so easy to make. I put three tablespoons coconut oil, three tablespoons  raw cocoa powder and two teaspoons honey in a double boiler. Before putting on the heat I first stirred the mixture until well cooperated. Then I turned on very little heat. The mixture melted in no time. Then I poured the mixture into chocolate moulds and added Ducan caramel granola for crunch. The chocolate was ready in about 15-20 minutes and gone in 2-3 minutes. Chocoholics and kids will love it! And it's healthy...

excellent texture and taste.  Be sure to remove the oil, honey and vanilla from the heat before whisking in the cocoa or you can overcook it and it will seperate

Found out my honey was rotten after I started making this so I used dark corn syrup instead.

Came out perfectly smooth. Mixes amazingly and has a gorgeous texture.
But it's bitter as all get out. I could've eaten cocoa powder straight and had less bitterness. Next time I'm dumping loads of sugar in there. This might work as a garnish or used for a decorative purpose but as a candy it's bust without sweetener of some kind. But overall it's a good recipe. Just bitter.

I used maple syrup instead of honey and it wasn't sweet enough.  Hubs could taste the coconut oil. I may try again and go for more sweetness.

Just made this using maple syrup, added pistachios, orange zest and a touch of expresso coffee.  Had no problems.  Quick and easy.  Will definitely make again

I was skeptical, but wow!  I like the taste of coconut so I used unrefined coconut oil.  I also used non-stick foil to line a 13x9 pan and a pizza cutter to cut it into 1" squares, but I wish I had candy molds.  I look forward to making it again and again with a variety of add ins.

I tried it out.The taste was good.I used liquid coconut oil.The problem for me is it did not come out of the chocolate mold even after refrigerating for 1 hour .It was sticky.Do we need to heat the coconut oil even if its  already in liquid form?

I was reading this recipe, I noticed i didn't have coconut oil and I read just for every 1/2 of cup of coconut oil you can use 1/3 of a cup of sunflower or olive oil. Post if taste good 5 stars because of how easy it is

JUST made these and i can't believe there are still a few left (trying VERY hard to contain myself!) I used agave instead of honey as I didn't have any honey in the house and I also added homemade crushed activated almonds and walnuts. This recipe is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!
