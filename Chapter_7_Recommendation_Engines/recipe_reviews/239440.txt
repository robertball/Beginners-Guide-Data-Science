I liked the flavor of this roast, plus is was really easy to put together.  The cranberries soaked up the wine and went nicely with the pork.  However, I am not sure if I did something incorrectly because the meat was very dry so the texture was not too pleasant.  I served this with mashed sweet potatoes and broccoli.  Taking a bite of the pork along with the sweet potato actually worked very well to add some needed moisture and the flavors complimented each other.  If I make this again, I might leave just a little bit of the fat and see if that helps keep some moisture in the meat.
