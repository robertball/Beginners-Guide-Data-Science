This is a great soup. I made it twice, one time with chicken and it was wonderful too. I used 3 chilies and the spiceness was perfect for our tastes. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've had this soup made by people from other parts of the world (Asia / Africa). There are definate regional differences and all are good, but this is the best one I've found so far!

This was delish.  Had to cut down the chiles for our taste but was still plenty hot enough.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I did tweak it a bit. I added a dash of cinnamon to the spice mix, and used a mortar and pestle to mix the spices. I did not want to blend the mixture once it was cooked, so instead of mixing in the spices, I pan fried them to release favours, then added them into a tea bag. I "steeped" the spice mixture and then took it out after cooking the soup.

Delicious, used Beef 'cos had no Lamb. Blended half the cubed Beef with the broth at the end as it tends to be a bit chewy if not cooked for long enough, should've blended all of it.Nice deep flavours. Thanks for sharing.
