The  combination of flavors was just wrong.  In fact, I didn't like the smell or taste of the marinade, but I thought maybe combining it with the chicken and cooking it would help.  It didn't.  It tasted exactly the same.  After a couple of forced bites, everyone at the table agreed that it was just inedible, and we threw the rest away.  It's a rare meal that's so bad we can't even tolerate it.  I followed the recipe exactly, so it must not be my family's type of thing.

Delicious and flavorful. I didn't make any major alterations with this recipe, other than probably going heavier on the spices that the recipes calls for and marinating this for probably close to 24 hours. This is so tasty moist. I've had this hot and cold and it's perfect either way. Thank you for the recipe. Oh yes. and I used chicken breasts instead of thighs.

The only change I made was using chicken breasts. I really liked this a lot, although I wouldn't say it's one of my favorites. This was my first time using cardamom and I think I'm a fan... this dish definitely had a very unique flavor and I really enjoyed the change!

This was very good--very moist and flavorful.  I increased the amount of cardamom to 3/4 tsp, so it had a stronger cardamom taste.  It still could have used more.  I also reccomend cooking the chicken longer--I cooked it for 55 minutes, covering it with foil for the last 15.

I've never tried Cardamom before and was shocked at the price (I found it anywhere from $8 to $18 per bottle!) but went ahead & tried it for something new.  My boyfriend wasn't nuts about it but did like it and wouldn't mind having it again (hey, at least he tried it!), I thought it was delicious!

This is a really nice recipe, and its easy to make ahead.  I just put frozen chicken in a bag with the marinade ingredients and let it thaw with them in the fridge for a couple of days and it worked great.

Best Chicken Ever!  I put too much salt on mine, but the color and the smells and the flavor is wonderful!!  I let mine marinate over 24 hours, but it is so worth it.  You probably don't need to marinate it that long, but it worked for me.  Merci for the recipe!  I cut mine down to three pieces of thigh using the calculator at the bottom.  You can find cardamom inexpensive at the Indian/Asian grocery store.

Loved it!! I followed the recipe exactly and my family told me don't lose this recipe.  DH wanted to know what spice I used. He had never heard of cardamom and I have only used it in baked goods but it gave the chicken a wonderful flavor. I will definately make this again and again.

Excellent. This recipe was easy! The chicken was moist and delicious. My advice: make sure you spray the broiler pan or cookie sheet as the marinade made of a sticky clean up!

AWESOME is the only word that I can use to describe this chicken.  It is definitely going to be one of my families regular dishes.  Flavor is wonderful, and very easy to make.

This chicken came out so delicious!  The salt and pepper crust make this dish and the cardamom is quite subtle.  I whirled together the marinade ingredients in my mini chopped and ended up letting the chicken sit in it for about 8 hours.

This is a great chicken recipe.  Lots of flavors, but nothing so to overpowering.  I love cardamom.  But I don't like it in heavy doses.  So this was just right.   My picky 19 month old liked it as well.

Just want to let people know I used fish sauce instead of soy and apple vinegar. The cardamom was a nice touch. So easy, too. A keeper.

The mixture of spices was not appealing at all. I did use more cardamom than the recipe called for, but I still won't be making this again.

This dish was delicious. The marinade provided some great flavor. The only problem I ran into was with timing in the oven. I got boneless/skinless thighs and the sizes varied, which made oven timing a little variable. 25 mins was probably right. Served with steamed zucchini and a spinach salad. I'd recommend adding a starch too

I used boneless/skinless thighs and it was delicious! I would probably cut the cooking time to 30 mins and go from there. Easy to throw together and easy clean up.

Very nice.  I used thighs but will try with breasts next time.  Did not have any rice vinegar so used red wine vinegar.  A keeper.

I followed the recipe and added a teaspoon of minced garlic, fresh grated ginger, increased the cardamom to 3/4 tsp and marinated overnight.  I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and these were so moist and flavorful.  I served with vegetable fried rice and my family said it is  keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

A quick and easy marinade. Works well with Chicken tenders (@350 degrees of course). I tend to go easy on the kosher salt, but that has to do with household preference.

This is an excellent, simple marinade. I didn't have enough fresh garlic on hand so I used garlic powder instead. Also, I didn't have time to let the marinade rest, and it came out full of flavor regardless. Definitely a recipe I'll use again!

This had a nice crispy exterior.  It was really good!  I liked the flavour, you'd think it'd be bland but the marinade gives it tons of flavour.

This is the best baked chicken I have ever had.  Absolutely amazing!!!  I used two big chicken breasts (boneless, skinless) and let it marinate most of the day.  Just heavenly.  Easy, and great flavor.

I needed something different to impress mom when she casually said she and my step dad were stopping by for dinner if we'd have her...in other words...i'm coming over and try and stop me lol like any good mom, pickiness is a forte..and she loed this! I cut down on the cardamom a bit and added just a bit more honey, it turned out wonderful and extremely moist..no wonder your guests liked this one Darla :)

Made this chicken for visiting friends... and they were pleasantly surprised that my obsession with cardamom yielded such a great find.  I'm not the biggest fan of skin-on chicken, but the simplicity and strong flavors of your recipe made it worth it.  MmmMmm.

This recipe seemed so easy but I did not know anything about cardamom, so I tried it.  I marinated it overnight and it is now in my recipe box because the flavor was wonderful and so moist. This is a keeper, the salt and pepper crust was exellent. Great taste, thanks Darla

I found the cardamom very subtle and pleasing, despite upping it to 3/4 tsp. I also  added 3 tsp of honey (one more) and only 2 Tbsp soy sauce, to suit my personal taste.  Next time, I would only lightly season the underside of the chicken with S&P and keep the kosher and pepper for the skin. I also found that it only needed 30 min at 400 degrees so be sure to monitor the cooking based on your oven. My husband likened this to the chicken you get in a shwarma - the seasoning allows the taste of the chicken to come through rather than just tasting the sauce. This was delicious!

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. The first time I followed the directions. The marinade  oozing out of the meat burned on the baking sheet, making for a very difficult cleanup. The second time, I put the thighs in a greased glass pan and made my hubby's life a lot more pleasant. He loved the taste and I enjoyed serving it with a Quinoa dish I invented "on-the-fly" and some roasted asparagus.

This chicken was amaaaazing! The cooking time and temp were off, though. I had deboned the chick thighs, so this might have been at play. Mine cooked thoroughly in a gas oven at 375 in only 20 minutes, and were both juicy and crispy on the outside. I doubled the cardamom as I love the flavor. Will definitely make again.

Really quite tasty. So simple too. Only let it marinate about 3 1/2 hours as I ran out of time. Next time will do it for the full time though. I used a little more cardamom than called for and next time will go even a little heavier with it. Also did just a tad less soy sauce but that was my preference. This is a keeper. Thanks Darla.

Thought this was really tasty given chicken thighs aren't my favorite.  I will definitely make this again, but probably modify the recipe with more of the cardamom and something to add a little heat.

The only change my wife made was apple cider vinegar for the rice vinegar because that was what we had. Normally she puts on her "Lab Coat" and changes every recipe but this one was perfect as is. Made the best chicken we have ever tasted, moist and every bite full of flavor. This one is a keeper!

This recipe turned out great.  I only marinated the meat for about two hours but the flavors were very present.  Also, I thought I had cardamom but didnt so I used a dash of Old Bay Seasoning.  Everyone really enjoyed this one.

My company LOVED this chicken. Simple to make, simple ingredients....what's not to love? We made this with boneless chicken thighs and grilled them a few minutes a side. I actually forgot to save the salt and pepper for the crust, and threw them in to the marinade - still delicious! A real winner.

I really wanted to like this, but I was disappointed. I'm not sure if it was the cardamom/soy sauce or the cardamom/chicken combination that turned me off so much, but whatever it was, it just didn't work for me. Sorry, I won't make this again, but thanks for sharing! :)

We weren't very impressed with this. I wish I hadn't been so over-cautious about adding more cardamon than the recipe called for - we found it to be a little bland. Like many others, I made this with boneless chicken breasts. I also did them on the Foreman grill as I didn't have much time in the kitchen tonight. Thanks anyway.

I loved this chicken. It came out a little salty with both the soy sauce AND a salt crust, but the flavors were spectacular. I was especially (pleasantly) surprised that the cardamom flavor was so infused into the meat.

This recipe was very good!  It was very easy to make and the chicken was tender and flavorful.

I will definitely be making this again.
