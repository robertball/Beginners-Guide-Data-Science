I'm pretty sure this recipe was inspired by a BLT. It is one of the best coleslaw recipes I've had. It's not the casual run of the mill, sweet version. Far from it. I love the mellow, understated taste of the blue cheese and the boldness of the bacon. One that I'm sure I'll be making again. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

This was good, I used broccoli slaw. Nothing to blow you away but easy side dish.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this, the bacon made it quite good.  I did not have tomatoes, so left those out.  Went will with buffalo chicken sandwiches.

I love blue cheese & I love cole slaw and this  has both of them! I made this one night and ate it the next day for lunch. It was good but not amazing. I will make it again though.

Five stars because it had the least/simplest ingredients and lots of BACON!!! My boys both cleaned it up and they almost never like the same thing as the other.

Easy to make.  Unique taste.  Even my hubby - who hates coleslaw - loved it.

This is a great recipe!! Delicious! For health reasons I changed to Bolthouse Farms Yogurt Blue Cheese Dressing, used Kraft reduced fat Olive oil Mayo, used Hormel Black label bacon pieces (real bacon) and lemon juice & lemon pepper! OMG! Now that fat is reduced, I can add crumbled blue cheese to each serving. This is great on top of burgers & sandwiches!

A nice change from regular coleslaw.  I cooked and crumbled real bacon, and added blue cheese crumbles as suggested in a previous review.

We loved this!! Used it instead of lettuce on buffalo chicken sandwiches. The boyfriend hates coleslaw and still liked this!

I can't wait for the next cookout to be able to bring this with me!  This was delicous, and a little different.  I'm not much of a cole slaw fan, but I do like blue cheese coleslaw.  The bacon and tomatoes really added to this.  I used tomatoes from my garden, instead of the cherry tomatoes, but I don't think it made a difference.  This is now a summer staple in my household!

This is wonderful! I made it as is and added a couple tbsp of crumbled blue cheese left over from the buffalo turkey meatballs I served it with. I really, really liked it as did my whole family! I will definitely  make it again. It was quick and easy. I think I only let it sit about 15 minutes before serving. No problem!
