Excellent. A cross between a Rice Krispy Treat and an oatmeal cookie.  Recipe worked much better when I accidentally boiled pb in with sugar and corn syrup.  For ease, boil ingredients in 2 cup pyrex measure in microwave (2-3 min) and use a stand mixer if you own one to mix ingredients.  Milk chocolate chips are delicious but messy if bars are used for hikes/ballgames where weather is warm.  This made 16 granola bar sized (2" x 4.5") treats.  A 54 cut made tiny 1" x 2" bars

Loved the recipie, had a little trouble with crumbliness but was probably due to a few substitutions I made to cut some of the calories.  Althought these sound like a lot of changes, I found they tasted wonderful, and were much less crumbly after being refrigerated:

Substitued 1 1/4 cups Splenda (sugar substitute) and 1/4 cup water for corn syrup

Substituted all natural chunky peanut butter for regular (eliminating the trans-fat that comes with the partially-hydronated oil added to commercial peanut butter)

Added some walnuts and sunflower seeds (Omega-3 fatty acids); also a mixture of dried cranberries, cherries, blueberries, and raisens 

Substitued high-protein, low carb cereal for the rice cereal; multi-grain mix for oatmeal

These granola bars are great! As previous raters commented, they were a little crumbly, so the second time around I added just a little less peanut butter and some honey! Perfect! I also used 1/4 c. of butterscotch chips and 1/4 c. of chocolate chips instead of all chocolate.

This was easy and tastes great. I like sweet granola bars. I made the recipe as written but omitted the raisins. Here are my suggestions: use mini-chocolate chips so the chips don't make the bars break up or melt the chocolate chips and spread on top of bars. You could also use all natural or organic ingredients. From my 9x13 pan I was able to get 18 1"x6.5" bars. They were soft and crunchy like chewy store made brands. I loved them and will make them again.

Really good.  They made a large jelly roll pan, but certainly not several dozen.  My fiance is a golfer, so I've been looking for a good energy bar recipe that doesn't turn to mush in the arizona summer sun.  I made a few adjustments to these; added about 1/3 cup of honey, substituted craisins for the raisins, added peanuts and sunflower seeds (for protein) and omitted the chocolate chips completely.  The result is a very tasty, chewy, high protein golfer's snack that holds up very well.  Still a little chewier than I would like, but the flavor is fabulous.  And SO easy!  Thanks for sharing!

After reading the mixed reviews (some said too crumbly, some said they had to add honey while mixing it together, and some said the recipe was fine just the way it is) I decided to limit the rice crisps cereal to 2 cups and am glad I did. They turned out great. I'll definetly be making them again. I'd like to try using crunch peanut butter instead.

Great recipe. Definitely use wax paper (or something along these lines) to make sure you press the mixture into the pan well. Otherwise the bars can fall apart easily. I can't wait to try this again, varying the ingredients each time. I'm thinking of trying almond butter as a substitute for the peanut butter just to try something different.

Quick, easy, delicious, and hey, they're made w/oatmeal, so they're good for you, right?  You can certainly add any flavor of chips, nuts, raisins, etc. to rev them up.  I think you also can get away w/1/3 cup of brown sugar and corn syrup instead of 1/2 of each. They are very sweet, especially if you add raisins or choc chips.

This is a variation of the bars I make. I like to use honey instead of corn syrup, and I omit the raisins (no one here likes them). I add the chocolate while still warm. My boys beg for these and at work carry-ins everyone asks for the recipe. So easy!

This was great!  I left out the raisins and chocolate and added the peanut butter with the corn syrup and sugar.  I put a piece of wax paper in my pan (no cleanup)and pressed it down firmly with the back of a buttered spoon.  I also added coconut and finely chopped pecans.  Tastes just like store bought. I can't wait to make new varieties.  A definite keeper!

These are fantastic.  I have made them many times with different add-ins and they always turn out great (except when I used low-fat peanut butter).  Today I made the 'sauce' and dipped apple in them to make diary-free carmel apples.  My daughter is allergic to dairy and these came out better than I imagined!!!!  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!

This is fabulous! I added some honey to the sugar/syrup, and let the peanut butter melt once I added it before I took it off the burner. Used craisins instead of raisins, also added some walnuts. Had no problems with crumbliness! This is great!

Very easy and good! I added a mixture of dried fruits and it turned out wonderful. The kids love them. You can also add the different flavored cereals like apple cinnamon, banna bread, etc.
Thanks for a great recipe!

These granola bars turned out soooo good, I will definitely be making these on a regular basis! I added about a 1/2 cup of coconut & instead of adding chocolate chips I added crushed smarties. I personally don't like chunks of chocolate and I had a couple of bags of crushed smarties that I needed to put to good use! Next time I'll add some sunflower seeds too. It was fine to mix until I added the smarties, then it was a little more difficult, but it worked out. A huge bowl helps too! I took the advice of the other reviewers and used folded parchment paper to help flatten the mixture into the pan. I then used my mini rolling pin to make the top nice & smooth. They sliced up really nice too with a really sharp knife. I personally do not like store bought granola bars at all, but these are really good & a nice fast snack too. Everyone loved them, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

these were really good.  I think next time i'll leave out the chocolate and put more raisins or other fruit.  The chocolate just seemed to overwhelm all the other flavors.  But, if you love chocolate, you will love it like it is.  Just don't add them too early like I did. By the way, pressing with a jar worked really well. thanks

I've made these 3 times now and I have to tell you that we really love them.  I've never added the chocolate chips but instead have added flavored dried cranberry's, dried apricot, & dates instead of raisins (which we're not fond of)  Whatever I have on hand at the moment.  I also always add 1/2 cup of toasted almonds .  Last time I added a couple of tablespoons of flax seed but the kids said they could taste it.  Wish it was lower in calories as the 54 servings is deceptive and would leave you with just a small square of this.  Great recipe and loved by my family.

I have tried other granola bar recipes in the past, and they were no where near as delicious and good as these! I didn't have any light corn syrup, so I used maple flavored pancake syrup instead, and it's delicious. You can't even really tell. And instead of chocolate chips I used mini M&M baking pieces. My kids LOVE them, and so did my other family members. Definitley a keeper, and I will make again and again! Better than store bought kind!!!

This is a great recipe and easily changable. This recipe produced chewey granola bars with all our favorites in them. I had no rice crispies so I used rice chex(the second time we made them I used Crispix which is rice on one side corn on the other, great results, we will probobly always make them with a chex type of cereal).  We have also added dry roasted peanuts and sunflower seeds.  My kids love them and can even help make them.  Great Recipe!!!

I make these all the time and follow another reviewers advice to melt the peanut butter in the saucepan instead of removing it from the heat first. It makes the sauce much more spreadable aand easier to coat the dry ingredients, plus there's no need to wait 10 minutes to mix it up.  I've tried adding different ingredients such as chopped walnuts or some trail mix type dried fruit.  Very good and very economical compared to buying the boxed granola bars at the store.  I've even substituted some Splenda in place of half of the brown sugar and it worked well.  Thanks!

I will not have to wait for sales on granola bars any more!!  To make sure the mix stuck together I added about a half a cup of mini marshmallows to the sugar and syrup mix and heated the peanut butter together with them.  I didn't wait till it cooled to add chocolate chips but put the hot mix straight into the lined pan and then pressed the chocolate chips into the top after it was set awhile.  Thanks to everyone who made such great suggestions.  Here's one more, for a bit of extra texture, and nutrition, I added about a quarter cup of dry milk powder to the cereal mix.

I did exactly what the recipe said to do except, I didn't add the choc chips. It was perfect. I had to stop myself and my two year old from eating them all in one siting. I can't wait to try different dry ingredients. Thank you so much.

YUM!!! This is really, really good!!!The first time I used mini chocolate chips and it was too much. I might cut back on the amount of  chocolate chips when I use them again-- or use regular size chips. The next time I added an extra cup of raisins and left off the chocolate completely! I added cinnamon both times, and used honey too as the other reveiwers recommended. If you leave out the chocolate, it is super easy and still really good!!

i've made these twice and i and my kids loved them.  Both times I used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup corn syrup and they came out extra peanut buttery!  I used a piece of wax paper to press them into the pan and help them hold together better.  A really easy good recipe!

This recipe was OK, but needed didn't come out as well as I had hoped.  The granola was crumbly and could have used nuts.  I will probably make it again, but will try modifying the recipe a bit.

These are awesome! We've made them at least 10 different ways, and they are great every time. Our favorite is with craisins, sunflower nuts and chopped almonds. I've also tried substituting almond extract for half of the vanilla, and it was delicious. The possibilities are really endless!

I do as another reviewer said and use a piece of wax paper so I can press them down TIGHTLY, and I wait until they are all the way cool to cut them. That way they are less likely to come apart. I store them in a big ziplock and they last about a week before they start getting crumbly.

Tasted good, but did not go together as the recipe indicated, first the sugar/peanut butter mixture hardened before I even finished putting it on the cereal so not everything would mix together.  Had to add honey just to try and make it manageable.  Not sure why you have to let it set for 10 minutes before adding the chocolate, stupid mixture was cool before I even finished mixing it.  Very messy, will probably just keep buying granola bars.

I used this recipe as a base to imitate some store-brand granola bars that I love.  I left out the chocolate chips and peanut butter, and added cranberries and almonds instead.  They tasted delicious, but were really stretchy and gooey.  They would have been perfect if they had set a little firmer.

I brought these to a Bible study and they got rave reviews. I made half with Craisins instead of raisins and left the other half with just mini-chocolate chips. That was a group of happy people. Thank you!

Flavor is really great!  My bars turned out very soft and didn't set up.  Any suggestions?  I'm thinking about boiling the sugar/syrup mixture  a bit longer.  ??

Very good and easy to make.  Added almonds, dried cranberries and a few peanuts.  Cheaper then buying store brands.

Fabulous!  These tasted just like a store bought chewy granola bar.  I omitted the raisins and used chunky peanut butter to get chopped nuts into the bars.  These didnt last long, but did get stale-ish within a day or so, but 10-15 seconds in the microwave softened them right up.

These are soooo yummy!! I added peanut butter chips with the choc chips for a total of 1 cup of chips. I also like to add them when the mixture is warm so they get a little melty. Makes 24 bars if you cut them into 1 inch by 4.5 in bars. Thanks for this recipe I'm sure it will stay a favorite.

yay, a homemade granola bar i like! myne turned out too soft but i'm pretty sure i know why, and it's easy to correct. also, i'm not sure how a 9x13 can yield 54 bars... (unless you're counting how many mouthfuls are in the pan).
i'll definitely make these again and again, with substitutes and add-ins of various kinds. thanks.

I make these instead of rice krispy treats.  I made them for youth group at church and they are their new favorite!  I was so proud!  These are great but should be thought of more as a dessert, than a healthy snack, as their name implies.

Yummy! I followed  a bit of reader advice and made a nice pan of bars. I put the peanut butter in with the corn syrup, and because of the 'sweetness' factor  completely omitted the brown sugar. I substituted minimarshmallows for chocolate(added them right in with the corn syrup and melted them) to help 'hold' it. All in all my two cents is: use a greased jar bottom, not a spoon, to FIRMLY press the bars.

Very good and very simple to make, not to mention superfast to put together. I used dried cranberries (personal preference)instead of the raisins. The combination of all the ingredients was fantastic. I will definately make this again.

These are very tasty, but a bit dry -- I wish I had read the reviews BEFORE making them.  Next time, I will add some more liquid and mix the pb in with the corn syrup/brown sugar.  I am looking forward to trying some other variations as well!

This is a great granola bar recipe. I have been looking for one like this for a long time. I didn't have any trouble with it staying together, just press FIRMLY into pan and let cool. Thank for this one, it's a keeper!

These granola bars taste great!! But I rated it a four because it was slightly crumbly (may try more syrup next time), and because I altered this recipe a bit. I used honey in with the peanut mixture, less rice crispys, and didnt use raisens. Thanx for the recipe, cant wait to play around with it.

These are the best granola bars I have ever eaten and they are so easy to make. They are also very easy to modify. I put granola cereal in place of 1/2 cup rice crispies and I absolutely love them. This will be my snack of choice from now on.

To avoid melting the chips, combine dry ingredients in a large bowl and other ingredients in a small bowl. Microwave the small bowl until ingredients are melted and pour into large bowl. Mix together throughly and press into a 9x13" pan (makes 24 bars). If your bars don't stick together try doubling the corn syrup.

I work with the jr. high youth group at my church and used this recipe for the snack one night.  It was easy enough that several students helped me to prepare them and yummy enough that everyone (both students and leaders alike) raved.  We made several batches varying the ingredients (choc. chips, no choc. chips, craisins instead of raisins, etc.)  I would recommend melting the peanut butter while the pot is still on the burner and we had trouble with the choc. chips melting while mixing even after 10 minutes.  Definitely line the pans with wax paper or foil.  The kids loved them regardless!

I found this recipie to be great!  I am looking for ways to creat good treats that my husband can take to work so he isn't treating himself to the vending machines! There were great!  I substituted the quick oats for just regular oats and dried cranberries instead of chocolate!  They were very light and YUMMY!  
(but they really don't make 4doz unless you cut them really small)

As easy as the No Bake cookies.  I wasn't crazy about the peanut butter in it, may leave that out next time.  Also rather crumbly.  I changed the raisins to a mix of dried cherries, blueberries and strawberries.  Very tasty.  I will make these again, tweaking the recipe a bit.

Added some honey to combine the last of the oatmeal.  Pressed extra chocolate chips on after it was in the pan to ensure even spread since mixing them in was a little tricky.  It was sweet so only use the natural peanut butter (unsweetened!)  Snuck walnuts in on my nut-phobic kids--like the ingredients control this type of recipe gives you.  Would have been five star but my two year old wouldn't eat them , just picked the chocolate chips off--argh. Also used craisins (cherry flavored) instead of raisins and this tastes good to me!

These only take a few minutes to make and my kids love them--they are better than the store bought kinds.  They are also easily adaptable to your own favorite tastes.  Skip the raisins and add marshmellows.  Add a little cinnamon instead of chocolate chips and you can't even taste the peanut butter.

Overall taste is ok but the preparation is not the easiest.  Its not bad until you get to the addition of chocolate chips.  They are not easily mixed into the rice crisp/rolled oats mixture as it has become clumpy and stucky from the peanut butter coating.  Not something I would make a second time.

I thought the taste was fantastic I used mini choclate chips and currants, but the bars did not hold together well. They were very crumbly and I wonder if that was why. They were still yummy though.

These were very good, and oh so easy to make!  My husband even liked them. He does not like raisins.(He says he is not picky, but I think he is!)

I got a little distracted while making these, and accidently dumped the pbutter and vanilla into the syrup mixture before it had boiled.  Thankfully, they still turned out, although next time, I will be sure to follow the directions better!  I also knocked out the raisins and just used chocolate chips.

Yum! I love the versatility of these. Don't save for too long or they become crumbly and stale.

Pretty good. Tastes good, although VERY sweet. Very simple to make. However, not really like a granola bar, to me. Almost like a crispy candy bar or something. However, was a big hit with the kiddo so will probably make again.

LOVED this recipe.  Upped the corn syrup just a touch.  Refrigerated my chocolate chips before I added them so they did not melt.  Will definitely make again and again.

I added crushed chocolate chips with the raisins and it tasted great.  I tried using 1/3 cup peanut butter and 1/3 cup corn syrup, but I had a problem getting them to stay in bar form w/o crumbling so next time I'll try the 1/2 cups - but it was still really good - and it lasts for weeks and weeks!

This was GOOD.  I added a couple of tablespoons of honey as some suggested.  I also just put the pb in with the corn syrup and brown sugar.  Omitted the chocolate chips and 1/2 c. of the rice crispies and added 1/2 cup of coconut.  Really good, and they are very sweet and chewy, but that's why we love them!

I thought these were way, WAY too sweet(and I didn't add chocolate chips!)  All I could taste was the rice crispies and sugar!  I guess it is just a personal preference, but I prefer a less sweet granola.  I was also looking for a recipe that made a crunchy, rather than chewy granola bar.  I actually didn't think the ingredients were that hard to work with, as other reviewers complained - I just didn't like it.

This is an exellent recipe. Mine did not turn out crumbly, I think the key here is to stir to coat quickly and then press into pan. mine held together just fine.  this ones a keeper.

Awesome recipe! I make this all the time. I send some with my hubby to work, take some to my work, and best of all it is so versatile. You can add so many neat dried fruits, nuts, candies, to suit it to whatever we are craving at the time. I can't ever seem to make enough of these!

Very strange recipe...it tastes really great, but parts of it were crumbly like granola...I think the wet to dry ratio needs to be played around with a little.  I did read other reviews and tips but chose to follow the recipe exactly as it was written.  I will definitely take others' advice and use less dry ingredients and play around with the add-ins if I make these again...otherwise it tasted really good (although it wasn't exactly pretty to look at!!)

REALLY disappointed with this recipe! How in the world do youmix it all together? The sugar/peanut butte mixture hardens too quickly and makes it next to impossible to mix. It has a great taste, but not great instructions. I ended up making granola balls and throwing the crumbs out!

These taste great!!  Very quick and easy to cook, thank goodness because the pan only lasted a day before it was empty!
