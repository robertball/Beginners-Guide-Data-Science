This recipe is amazing!  This was my first time making a cheesecake and it turned out great!  I did make one alteration, I used an oreo cookie crust instead of the animal crackers, we're a chocolate loving family.  I just bought a pack of oreos and threw almost a row of them in the food processor to make 1 1/2 cups of oreo crumbs and kept the same amount of everything else for the crust.  I also used special dark cocoa.  Just delicious!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I look forward to making it again.

This recipe is definitely going in "my favorites".  I took it to work and within 10 minutes the plate was empty, someone was scraping the knife and plate to get the last and I had requests to bring it in again "tomorrow."  It is not one of those things you can throw together because of the length of time to bake, sit and cool but the wait was worth it.

This is one of the most decadent cheesecakes I’ve ever made!  I pre-baked the crust for 15 min. It had a light delicate crunch and you could definitely taste the coffee.  The cheesecake itself is like a giant chocolate truffle.  I omitted the nuts from the filling as a personal preference because I like my cheesecakes to have a smooth creamy texture.  My only other admission was the cornstarch.   I bake a lot of cheesecakes and was very leary of the baking instructions.  Not wanting to chance failure, I used my standard baking method for cheesecakes which includes baking in a water bath.   I’ve never had one crack and this one was no exception.  It turned out perfect!

This is really yummy! Definitely good for a sweet tooth or a chocolate lover. The slight coffe flavor is nice too, you can taste it, but it isnt overpowering. To make the marshmellow creme easier to spread, i microwaved it about 15 seconds and it was perfectly spreadable and not too sticky. Thanks for the recipe!

I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and baked it for about 8 minutes at 350F. I also used almonds instead of pecans. I spread the marshmallow over the whole top and toasted it with a mini torch. Everyone who tried it loved it!!!!

First time ever making a cheesecake so I followed the instructions exactly. Turned out great. Very rich and very delicious. I was unsure about the coffee, but it is not overpowering. Takes a while with the cook and wait time,but the end result was worth it. I used chocolate animal crackers instead of plain ones. I will definitely make it again, but will probably leave the nuts out of the filling.

I made this to take to a bbq - only 1 piece remained at the end of the day. I very much liked the animal cracker crust along with the deep mocha flavor. I put chocolate sauce on top of the cheesecake, whipped cream at the edge,  and then sprinkled toasted pecans on top of half of the cheesecake on behalf of the people that are allergic to nuts. I, also, did not mix nuts into the cheesecake as I like it creamy. I couldn't bring myself to put marshmallow cream on top; cheesecake isn't meant to be that sweet. I cooked my cheesecake in a water bath following directions as to cook time and cooling in the oven. Then I chilled the cheesecake in the refrigerator over night. I definitely will make this again.

This is delicious. The only change I made was to not add any pecans at all, I like my cheesecake smooth and creamy, and this did not disappoint. Loved the mocha flavor! Will definitely make this again!

Loved it. Very rich. Skipped the marshmallow to make it less sweet. Perfect.

Everyone loved this. I used Oreos for the crust and without thinking added all the sugar. Next time I'll leave is out of the crust. This may be my new favorite cheesecake and I hate anything with marshmallow. I will make this again !!!

I used a well greased and wax papered pan instead of a springform  pan. It worked fine and came out easily. I left out  the instant coffee granules and was still delicious.

I don't drink coffee so the coffee flavor seemed overpowering to me, but everyone else swears it wasn't. My family liked it so I will probably make it again with less instant coffee.

This cheesecake was absolutely delicious and very rich. I will definitely make it again. I will admit that I made an oreo crust because I'm a total chocoholic. Absolutely wonderful.

This is the best desert I have ever made!  Delicious and rich!  I let it cool for 3 hours outside of the oven and it turned out great. I used Gadiva chocolate chips and whole milk for the topping and I omitted the pecans in the filling.

My sister's told me this was the best cheesecake they ever had! It was really sweet. I don't think it's a cheesecake everyone would love but we loved it. It wasn't quite done all the way through but then I found later on my room mate kept opening and closing the oven door :-)
