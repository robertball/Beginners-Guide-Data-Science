Perfect recipe. I followed the directions and the meal came out exactly as expected. I wouldn't change a thing. I was looking for a WOK meal that was easy and tasty and this is the one. Thank you!!!!!

I made this for my girlfriend who is Filipino and she said it was nostalgic. I followed this recipe precisely as I have predominantly cooked European dishes and it has turned out great.

It's good. But 1 tablespoon does not mix into 1 teaspoon of water. I used 2 teaspoons.
