This is a great recipe, and super flexible!  I used ground beef and ras al hanout Moroccan spice instead of the spices listed in the recipe.  Ras al hanout is a Moroccan spice. So you get everything in it.  I also used corn instead of peas and added a little honey to the sweet potatoes.  The flavor was amazing. A perfect blend of sweet and savory.  For presentation purposes, I sprinkled a little spice on the top for color and texture.

"It's a keeper!" commented my husband. I didn't have ramekins, so prepared it in a slow cooker liner. Doubled the recipe for a potluck of 14 adults. Added carrots, increased amount of peas due to slightly smaller amount of meat on hand. Did not use all the whipped sweet potatoes, so next time I'll cook fewer of those.

Awesome recipe! Used Japanese sweet potatoes and added chopped carrots and celery. Also recommended using the water from the sweet potatoes for stock.

! made this last night looking for a change from regular shepherd's pie which we have quite often. I used ground lamb but otherwise followed the recipe. We found it pleasant tasting  but the gravy was a bit too runny and the flavor a bit  odd. I probably will not make this again.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this meal.  I followed the recipe pretty much as called for,  though I did use  chopped sirloin, only because I donâ€™t care for lamb.  I added a few more peas than called for, and all in all it was pretty tasty!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was to sweet for me... if I ever make it again I will have to add more heat and maybe add some lemon juice to balance that overly sweet flavor.
