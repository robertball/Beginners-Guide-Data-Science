I made these as circles and they baked up better looking than they were raw. I used Nutella instead of jam.  Next time I'll roll the dough thinner as there seemed a lot more cookie than filling and I didn't get that many cookies from 1 batch.

Okay.  I'm rating this recipe a 5 because anyone who tasted them even without knowing how much work went into them, gave them 5 stars.  I made them for an Italian themed espresso and cookie night when some friends from where I lived in Padova, Italy were coming to the states to visit.  They definately passed as "Italian" and everyone loved how they tasted.  I was frustrated with how long they took to make and the fact that the dough was impossible to work with after being out of the fridge for even 5 minutes.  I had to keep popping it in the freezer to make it cold enough to be workable.  This added to the time-consuming aspect of the recipe.  I am going to try it again for a gallery opening event I'm going to tomorrow night, but this time I'll take the advice of other reviewers and make the cuts after the two sheets are layed on top of one another with the filling already in between.  Hopefully this will cut down the time and frustration and not take away from the pleasing taste!

Way too much work for what you get, but if you have plenty of time to spare, go for it.  Used strawberry perserves, and the cookies reminded me of mini Pop Tarts.  Tasty, cute, just too much work for me.  Advice:  When you cut the squares in the dough, cut them with one dough square on top of the other, so all cut squares are evenly matched with a top and bottom piece.

Out of the nine recipes [all five star rated] of Italian favorite cookies I made for my daughter's wedding these went first! Everyone loved them. Please follow the recipe; do not substitute pie filling.
              Thank you so much

My family loved these cookies.  
I used my own cherry almond preserves. These cookies are just perfect for the Christmas table.
The dough is easier to work with when kept chilled.  I made both round and square shapes.  If the dough becomes too soft, simply put it in the fridge for a few minutes.  I even put the squares (still on the waxed paper) back on a shelf in the fridge while I filled half a sheet.

I gave this five stars because the finished product is fabulous and so tasty!  I made this in two batches and I made the first batch as directed.  It was a little messy and hard to work with, so here are some simple changes that worked great on the second batch.  (The key is not to touch the dough too much after it is chilled.)  After the dough is mixed, separate into two balls.  Refrigerate for at least an hour.  After dough is sufficiently chilled, remove one ball from the refrigerator, place between two sheets of wax paper, and roll till it's fairly thin.  Peel one piece of paper off this layer.  Draw out a grid pattern on this layer with a knife.  Don't slice through the dough; just press enough to make lines.  Place 1/2 tsp of preserves or nutella in each grid section.  Set aside or place back in refrigerator.    Remove second dough ball from refrigerator and roll between two pieces of wax paper to same thickness as the first layer.  Take one piece of wax paper off the second layer, then GENTLY turn the layer over and place on top of the first layer.  Remove the wax paper from the top layer.  Cut the cookies between the filling plops, this time cutting all the way through.  GENTLY turn the cookies over and place on the greased cookie sheet.  Peel off the final piece of wax paper, separate cookies, and seal with fork tines.  Sprinkle with sugar and bake as directed.  Yummy!

Oh man, this recipe is one of the hardest I have ever made! Rolling the dough was incredibly difficult, forming the cookies even more difficult... wow! I'm not sure this is worth the effort for what you get and that's saying something since I often make cakes that take 3+ hours to make.

These are pretty good when you want something kind of light. They're kind of like two butter cookies with some fruit filling between them. Maybe on taste, they were four stars, but because they were so cute I had to give them five stars. They were also really fun to make. I used cherry, raspberry, and peach preserves (Smuckers) I liked the raspberry ones the best because they were the most tart. I think the only thing I will do differently if I make these again is to put more filling in each one. I used just 1/4 teaspoon of filling per square like the recipe said, but I found that I wanted to taste the fruit a little bit more once I actually ate them.

These cookies are excellent. I made 3 batches during the holidays and everyone loved them. I used a round cookie cutter so they looked more like little tarts than ravioli's.

These cookies were incredible - adorable looking and a wonderful flavor!  As mentioned by other reviewers, they are time-consuming to make, but they are great when you really need to impress.  I took them to a party, and they were the number one favorite!  I made the cookies 2" rather than 1-1/2" and used 1/2 t. cherry jelly on each, which seemed to work well. I was afraid the jelly would seep into the cookie and "disappear" from the middle, but it held its form nicely.

These were good, but very time consuming to make.  I would probably not make these specific cookies again, however the dough is delicious and I will use that for other cookie recipes.

Good cookies, even if Ravioli Dolci -I'm Italian- are quite different. Try filling them with Nutella mixed with ricotta cheese. Also, once you've rolled and refrigerated your dough, remove top wax paper and lay spoonfuls of filling in straight lines and set intervals on top of first -uncut- dough layer. Remove top wax paper from second dough layer and flip it  on top of first one. THEN cut squares or circles. Don't forget the vent holes!

Very good tasting cookie. Kind of shortbread like. The dough is difficult to work with, but I found that by rolling it out between the wax paper and then putting it in the freezer, the squares were much easier to work with. I filled mine with blackberry preserves and dusted them with powdered sugar. Others I filed with the cream cheese filling from the bakery and then drizzled those finished squares with chocolate. Very pretty and will be enjoyed by all. I will say that you only get about half of the amount the recipe is supposed to yield and I didn't make them huge. I'll make these again, only this time I know what I'm getting into. Merry Christmas and thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a very tasty cookie! I would have only given it 4 stars, but on a whim i added a drizzle of white and semi-sweet chocolate, it really made these cookies "pop" with the cherry perserves. They look great and are super Yummy!

For those who had problems with the dough becoming sticky once it was out of the freezer/fridge, if possible, I roll mine out on a chilled marble board that stay naturally cold. Another trick is after rolling both layers out, add the filling, place the second layer of dough on top and using a pizza cutter, run it between each section. Hope this helps...

Absolutely love this recipe. I use Blueberry preserves. I definitely don't think it makes 64 cookies, but it's plenty :-). Again, amazing recipe!

The name is misleading, these are nothing like ravioli.  The dough is a flaky pastry dough, not pasta-like.  Not at all what I thought it would be.

Regardless, these were pretty tasty and got great reviews.  I suggest making them a little larger and using more preserves than suggested.  I made mine into ~2" triangles and used about a teaspoon of preserves on each.  Also drizzled them with a bit of melted chocolate.

I have to give this a 5 just because they are so good, it almost doesn't matter how long they took. I was a little frustrated with the dough but didn't put it in the fridge, I put it in the freezer instead, until just about hard. They were easy to cut and fold together. I took another reviewers idea and also used neutella. WONDERFUL. I'm glad I didn't use the pie filling, I fell like it would have just been an ordinary strudel type cookie. This is a keeper!

Excellent taste, perfect blend of flavors.  Best filled cookie I've ever made. Didn't change a thing, maybe next time I'll try filling with figs and almonds.  The cookie part is perfect. I will be making these cookies often.

Very difficult to form, though. I made the squares a little bit bigger than suggested and it worked out terrifically.

This was a fun recipe to make and I used a circular pasta cutter instead of a wheel to cut out the dough.  I also used canned cherry pie filling instead of cherry preserves.  Next time I will try it with preserves.  The dough was nice and tender and the almond extract combined with lemon peel provide a rich nutty and tangy flavour.  Interesting, I would make it again.

These were so good! Very time consuming though. My cookies didn't look anything like the picture! They were very good though. I think next time i won't do all of the cutting of the squares and all that...I will just bake them like regular cookies and then put the preserves in the middle of the cookie. Overall, a good recipe!

I used a blueberry pie filling for the first batch and found that the sugar cookie overpowered the blueberry taste so I used fresh raspberries whole the next batch and found that it didn't make the cookies as mushy and you could taste both the cookie and the filling.

These are pure heaven!  If you haven't tried an Italian cookie recipe, this is the one to try!  The cookies are so light, buttery, and divine!  The only thing different is add 1/4 tsp. of anise extract instead of almond.  It was perfect!  I baked some extra to take to the guys at work!:)))

These cookies are delicious.  You cannot omit the lemon.  That's what makes them delicious.  Well, that and the butteryness of them.  I did leave out the almond extract, though I can't imagine them possibly being any better with it.  And I used raspberry preserves, and mmmm mmmm mmmm.

The reason I docked this recipe one star was for the amount of time it takes to make these.  Make sure you set aside a couple hours.

WOW!  These are awesome!  They are a little more time-consuming than simple drop cookies, but well worth every bit if effort.  I took these to a potluck dinner party and every single one was eaten.  Luckily, I had stashed a couple back at my house, and I loved them even more the next day!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  I will definitely be making these again.

These cookies are very good but the dough was a little hard to work with.  Even after leaving in the fridge it was just so soft that it kept tearing.  Even so,  I would make them again if I had time on my hands... thanks for the great recipe Justin!!
