I am the recipe submitter and was asked to create a recipe for the Panasonic countertop induction oven, hence the oven-specific directions.   However, these steak bundles are also equally as delicious on an outdoor grill.  Grill the asparagus a few minutes on a medium-high heat grill before assembling the bundles. Then return to the grill for approx. 2 minutes per side over medium heat, or until cooked to your liking. Enjoy!

Holy , this is amazing.  No idea why anyone would post a recipe using times/temps/settings on a specific device hardly anyone would own, here's what I did.  Coat the asparagus with oil, salt, pepper as directed.  Get 3 thick Ribeye steaks, find the ones with the most meat vs. fat.  Trim the fat and cut them into 1" strips, save the remains for a decadent treat.  Pound the meat flat as directed for wrapping.  Microwave the asparagus (big fat stalks) 2 minutes twice, not 4 minutes or it will get mushy.  Use your favorite meat rub on the steak, then Wrap the meat and peppers as directed.  Broil 5 minutes each side for medium rare on most pieces.  Try to convince yourself you are not at a fancy restaurant while you eat it.

I made these on the gas grill.  I blanched the Asparagus for 2 minutes then set to rolling.   I used 1/2 a fresh red pepper jullianed vs the jarred. I made 10 bundles.  I got flap meat, about 2.5 pounds,  from the butcher and had them add the seasoning. I only used 1/2 the meat after pounding it thin.   I placed the rolls on a piece of foil on a grill preheated on low.  I grilled for  about 4
Minutes a side.   I'll make this  again.

Happened to have cubed steak & asparagus & this worked out wonderfully. I am way too lazy to pound things thinner or pin it up nice or prep the asparagus other than cutting off the ends (man I am lazy) and I used roasted peppers from a jar. They fell apart a bit when I flipped them (as I broiled them in my oven for 5 min a side), but they came out delicious. I think hubby ate 9 of them! I also just had powdered parmesan, but I tucked in a small strip of provolone. Easy, tasty & quick... all my favorite things.

I totally forgot to add the additional 1 tablespoon of parmesan cheese on top, but you know what? I didn't miss it one bit! These were DELICIOUS! The only change I made (besides forgetting the add'l cheese), was to use my own roasted peppers, which I had in the freezer in olive oil, garlic and basil. These are elegant enough to serve for a dinner party, but easy enough for a weeknight meal. We served ours with some pan fried potatoes and sliced tomatoes. It was a fantastic Saturday night dinner, at home, for a lot less than going out! Thanks LilSnoo!

This is a delicious steak roll!!! Made it several times (although without the red peppers, honestly doesn’t need them). Tried to make them in the oven with the broiler and it just doesn’t come out right.

Yum!  Grocery didn't have skirt steak, so I used sirloin and just pounded thin.  Made my own "Montreal" seasoning(from Allrecipes).  Definitely want to use thin asparagus(less tough) if available.  I also made some with chicken for those who don't like beef.  Thought both varieties were delicious!

It was delicious and easy! I didn't use the pepper. I put some fresh minced garlic and less cheese on the inside. I served it with fresh squeezed lemon and rice. I cooked it on my George Foreman grill. I had to grill the asparagus for about 7 minutes and in 2 batches, but it gave me plenty of time to prep the meat and to start cooking the rice.

It was delicious. I used rib eye steak and dried Parmesan  cheese.  The red from the roasted peppers (jared) and green asparagus made it perfect for a Christmas appetizer. Next time I'll try fresh Parmesan.

Delicious! My 6 year old even loved them. I skipped out on the parm cheese and they were still amazing! Thanks for the recipe!
