I don't know that you need a recipe for this, it's just a good, old-fashioned hamburger.

Simple bit delicious burgers! We made ours into sliders with little Hawaiian rolls. The onions make this dish!

Loved this. Simple, quick, full of flavor. We always eat our burgers like this, normally without the onions (but from here on out, WITH the onions :D) Added a little garlic powder to the patties, personal preference. Look forward to experimenting with various cheeses, topping and condiments!

Family consumed these burgers before I could even add the onions to the serving platter! I'm glad I have found the recipe for the "perfect burger". No need to add anything to the beef. Pure beef taste is amazing. Used 80/20 and cooked on the grill perfectly done. I did place formed patties in freezer for a few minutes to firm up. No need to add anything to meat. Grilled onions added depth of flavor. Thanks for bringing us back to the simple roots of beef burgers.

Good classic hamburger, but, kicked up a notch with the grilled onions.  Easy to just add the onions right along side the burgers on the grill. True flavor of the beef comes through by just adding a little salt & pepper to the meat.

This is a basic burger recipe.  I enjoyed it, but may add some bacon next time, b/c who doesn't love bacon, right?!

This is a straight-forward, classic burger. The grilled onions add delicious flavor. I served them with homemade garlic-parmesan fries for an awesome meal that got devoured.

The perfect classic burger, but with cheese for us. Served on a pretzel bun, how can you go wrong?

Yum!  Of course, I added Valerie's Herdez Creamy Tomatillo Avocado Salsa and had bd.weld's pickled eggs on the side.  Hard not to love this dinner!  A few chips and a light green salad finished it off!

Restaurants almost always over cook burgers, so I make mine at home. Sauteed the onions in the same pan I used for the bacon. Ground chuck makes the best hamburger. Used cheddar cheese, and fresh  veggies. It's classic. Why go out when you can cook it better yourself?

What's not to like about a beef burger?  I topped mine off with provolone, guacamole, tomato, and grilled onions.  Just remember to season the burger, don't flip the burger until it let's loose from the grill/pan, and don't overcook.
