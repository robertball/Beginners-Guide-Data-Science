Used one egg and 2 3/4 of softened butter to decrease stickiness of batter, and chai tea powder instead of concentrate but other than that itâ€™s a really good recipe

This is a great recipe. I made regular snickerdoodles without the chai flavoring. Yes the dough is wet, but this makes the cookies soft yet crispy on the outside. They are like mall cookies but better! The dough is easier to work with once it's rolled in the cinnamon mixture. I made 1.5 - 2 inch balls and got about 32 cookies out of it.

I followed the recipe exactly but added a little bit of cardamom. The cookies turned out great. I did not have any trouble with the dough being too sticky, it worked out just right.

The dough was still too wet and sticky. I added a ton more flour, and it was still sticky. Needless to say, I had a hard time rolling the dough, but I tried. The taste was wonderful, but they were hard to make.
