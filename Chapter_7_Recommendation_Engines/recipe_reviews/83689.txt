I thought this was great.  It was super easy, fast and tasted good too. 

I made a few changes to the sauce though.  Doubling the coconut milk (I didn't have coconut cream) and peanut butter, really made the dish more saucy rather than dry.  I also added lemon juice and just used a serrano pepper.

This was great both with tofu, seitan & chicken.
I used regular coconut milk instead of the cream of coconut. With the sweetened peanut butter the dressing turned out fine.
Very tasty. If you add a lot of veggies to this (and make a little more dressing to cover them) this recipe shines!

This was fantastic.  I didn't have soy chunks on hand, so we used Quorn tenders instead.  Since they didn't need to be rehydrated, I simply cooked them in a pan  separate from the sauce and blended them together before adding to the quinoa.  I also just added a tiny bit of water to the sauce rather than the 1/2 cup the recipe called for- I wasn't sure how much water would have been left after the soy had been rehydrated, so I just guessed- maybe 2 or 3 Tbs.  I then doubled the amount of the sauce since the previous reviewer had said it was dry.  This made a perfect amount and was really delicious, though I think next time I'll add a little more peanut butter.  It also only really made enough for my boyfriend and I, so next time I'll definitely double the recipe as we easily could have eaten more and we both LOVED it.  Very nice flavor, and I love getting new recipes for quinoa!

I doubled the peanut butter and used coconut milk, as many others did.  Although I love peanut butter, that was really all that I could taste from the end product.  The texture was also creamier than I had expected, but possible due to having more sauce than the original recipe yields.  Overall, the recipe was okay.  I may try it again with more alterations/additions.  Thanks!

I was really excited to try this, as I cook this kind of recipe a lot, and love asian food. However, this was just not good, in my opinion. In an attempt to improve it, I added sesame oil, more peanut butter, herbed-garlic-salt, increased the coconut milk, added yellow & orange peppers, and still it was so-so. Sorry. Won't bother with this again.

YUMMY.  Doubled the peanut butter as others suggested, used coconut milk and Serrano pepper. Used tempeh for the soy chunks. Added 1/4c golden raisins to the sauce as an afterthought.  I inhaled this.

To quote from a previous reviewer: "I doubled the peanut butter and added extra chiles but the end result was disappointing. Like another reviwer (sic), the only taste that really came through was peanut butter." Then why did you double the peanut butter? IMHO people should try the basic recipe first (and review it on that basis first!) before making major changes. By the way, although I'm usually not fond of soy products, this dish was delicious.

I just made this and I liked it for the most part but did make a few changes.  I added more sauce like suggested in previous reviews but it might have been okay with what's written.  I also added baked tofu instead of soy chunks so I just added some water to the sauce then added tofu later.  I also added about a tablespoon of Tamari (aged soy sauce) for a little more flavor and 2 teaspoons of chili paste instead of the chili because I didn't have one.  In previous review there was some confusion about coconut cream.  The cream is the part towards the top of the coconut milk can before it's mixed together.  Overall I thought it was yummy and very forgiving to changes/modifications.

I found this to be very dry (even after adding a good bit more water), and the cooking time seems off. The flavors didn't do it for me, and I love Southeast Asian food.

I doubled the peanut butter and added extra chiles but the end result was disappointing. Like another reviwer, the only taste that really came through was peanut butter. Altogether too bland for me. I wonder if it would help if you soaked the soya chunks in something like onion stock? Thanks for the recipe anyway.

Followed this recipe exactly (found coconut cream at Trader Joe's) except for the pepper, which I had never heard of and neither had anybody else I could find, so substituted a spoonful of Thai pepper paste. Served it over steamed veggies, and am lovin' it!!!! Got enough leftovers for tomorrow...
