Easy and yummy! As others suggested, I used olive oil instead of shortening, and I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. I didn't have rosemary, so I used oregano (we were having it with my homemade spaghetti and meatballs, and there is oregano in the sauce), and it was very tasty. Everyone loved it!

Word of caution: don't use a handheld mixer! When I added the third cup of flour it nearly burned the motor out! I will use my food processor next time. I am also going to try sea salt/kosher salt instead of table salt next time as well.

Mine was done in 38 minutes but would have been ok at 40.

Very good bread!!!  I agree, it does closely resemble the stuff you get at Macaroni Grill.  The only changes I made to the recipe were to sub dill for thyme (I was out..oops) and also added on 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  The bread was nice & crusty on the outside & chewy inside.  Also, I love how there is no kneading invloved; this would be a very good recipe for someone who is just learning how to make bread.  Thanks for sharing!!  :)

I made this in my bread machine, basic white bread setting, and it turned out perfect.  I omitted the parsley (none on hand) and added garlic powder per other reviewers.  It sliced easily.

Loved this bread!  It reminds me of the bread at Macaroni Grill - yummy!  And easy to make, too!  I didn't have parsley on hand, so I used oregano to complement the pasta dinner it accompanied.  Very tasty.  Thanks!

Melt in your mouth, deliciousness!  This was sooo good.  I am in the process of making my second loaf already after a few weeks of making the first. The only changes I made were to substitute oregano for the thyme and olive oil for the shortening.  Absolutely perfect, thank you!!!!

Only change I made was to use EVOO instead of shortening and margarine.  Used a whisk instead of a blender.  Good flavor but very mild.  Next time will add oregano, garlic, marjoram, etc. to make it zing a little more.  Served it toasted with butter and 4 men made short work of a loaf.

I just love this recipe. I followed it exactly the first time and it was amazing. I am not known for my bread baking skills. This recipe is fool proof. I also bake it with no added seasoning and it is amazing. Great for sandwiches. I also added 1/3 cup sugar 
1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup soaked raisins and that was amazing. I now bake this bread twice a week at least. I no longer buy bread. The hands on time is minimal. So excited about this recipe.

This is an easy, tasty bread.  I didn't have to use a hand mixer and stirred this with a wooden spoon.  Since I didn't have dried parsley I increased the rosemary to 3 tsp., kept the thyme the same and added in a few dashes of basil.  I used olive oil instead of shortening since I didn't have any and brushed the top with olive oil when it came out of the oven.  A tasty bread that I will definitely make again.

This is an excellent bread. It is not batter like at all, however. Great flavor. I used olive oil instead of shortening. Don't let the one person that rated it 1 star because they didn't try it based on the directions stop you from trying this great recipe!

I accidentally added all 3 cups of flour at the beginning. I ended up needing to add some extra water to get the right consistency. I used dried basil, dill, thyme, oregano, and fresh parsley. I also used olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder and baked in a 8 inch springform pan. Turned out great. Tasted bland fresh out of the oven, but tasted much better a few hours later. Let it cool down!

Fabulous! Easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I used my KitchenAid Mixer with the cookie paddle attachment. I expected this batter to be loose like a batter, but it was more like a bread dough (tight). You can always add extra or different herbs or flavoring, but try this as printed first. I found it to be a perfect texture. I cut it very thin with a serrated knife and had no crumbling. Very good. Can't wait to make again (have a feeling it will be gone SOON!)

The flavor of this was awesome, as was the ease. I modified it a bit by necessity of time. I was making this for lunch, but was going to be gone for three hours immediately before needing to bake it, so I needed the proof time to be a lot longer. I increased the salt to 2 tsp and reduced the sugar to 1 tsp. Instead of shortening I used EVOO, like many others, and used oregano instead of parsley. Added 1/2 tsp garlic, but I think it would have been fine without it. The changes in the salt and sugar were just what I needed to lengthen the proof time, and this turned out wonderful. I'm looking forward to trying it as is for a quick side sometime.

Seriously one of the best bread recipes Ive ever made! I used my bread machine on dough setting and then folded the dough into a nice oval shape and put it in a loaf pan, brushed melted butter on the top and cut a long cut down the middle. LOVE IT! I added garlic as someone else recommended as well!

I lost my usual bread recipe that I knew I liked and so I've made a few from allrecipes looking for the softness that I like. This one came out moist with a nice crust that is not too hard or chewy. (I don't like hard chewy crusts. I would say that my 'batter' was stiff enough to be considered a sticky dough. 

The things I did different are this:
I wanted a richer bread so I used milk and butter in place of water and shortening. I left out the parsley and nipped out to the garden and grabbed some fresh chives instead. I also used fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden as well.

I'm giving this 5 stars. It's not the absolute best bread I've ever had, but certainly better than 4 stars. It's probably the recipe I will adopt from now on unless I find my other one. I almost forgot to mention, I doubled the recipe and used half to make cloverleaf rolls with it. they are wonderful!

WOW! This is incredible!!! It has so much flavor and compliments any meal perfectly. I served this with Delicious Ham and Potato Soup from this site, and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I definitely agree with other reviewers that it is very similar to macaroni grill.  But, if anything, this is better.  I will be making this again very soon.

I made this a few days before Thanksgiving. Very easy and delicious.  I did add garlic powder as others suggested.  I love this toasted which gave me an idea try so I baked some slices for a few minutes until they were a little drier and then cut them in cubes and threw them in the stuffing for the turkey.  It really added flavor into the stuffing.

This was phenomenal! My first time making bread and it was easy to do by hand as I don't have a mixer.  My house was a little cool and it took longer to rise than I expected, but the end result was beautiful and delicious.

My husband suggested adding more herbs next time for more of a kick and I might. 

It was great as toast too.

this is an excellent recipe for an excellent bread.  i made a few changes to flavorings as i do not care for herb bread.  however, the proportions, techniques and baking time are all accurate and the flavor is exceptional.

"Bake in preheated oven until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 40 to 45 minutes. Brush top with margarine. Remove from pan, and cool on wire rack." Are you supposed to take it out of the oven, out of the pan, tap it on the bottom and, then if it isn't done, put it all back and finish cooking it. Can hardly trust in the person who wrote this!

I made this in the bread machine on basic like another user suggested and added a little garlic salt and reduced the regular salt by 1/4 tsp. The bread turned out great. The middle fell and a friend said to reduce the yeast so next time I'll use 2tsp instead of 2 1/4 tsp. This had wonderful flavor and would make a nice side to a dinner with herbed chicken, 40 clove chicken or the like.

Product was a little too crumbly. Always fell apart when I tried to cut it. Time indicated to bake was too long for me. First loaf came out hard as a rock and I know my oven temp is accurate. Very good flavor though.

I HATE when people rate a recipe after they changed a million things about it. I only added a teaspoon of garlic powder, and followed the recipe as is. I didnt bother melting margarine over the bread. I just took a stick of butter and ran it across the top a few times, Why melt butter, if the bread is hot and will melt it on its own? I highly recommend this bread, it's so easy!

This recipe was amazing! I loved it! I frequently make bread, but this will definitely go into my weekly rotation! I added a tablespoon of garlic powder and some freshly chopped chives for a bit of extra flavor.  Mine was also completely baked and perfectly golden after 32 minutes, so I'd advise checking it frequently after the first half hour.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made this to go with a pot of veggie-tortellini soup.  The flavor and texture were good.  My first attempt fell slightly, so I will decrease the second rise time with my next batch.  I think I'll try it using fresh herbs and minced garlic next time.  This would be great with spaghetti or lasagna.

I wanted to make rosemary bread but this didn't do it for me.  The texture is nice but not enough flavor with the herbs.  I did add 1T of dried rosemary along with the parsley and thyme.  I thought it was an easy bread to make so I may try it again with fresh rosemary and a lot of it too.   Maybe larger amounts of other herbs, possibly fresh chives too.  I'll report back if I do this recipe again.

Been making this a few times and the results have been fantastic and consistent every time.  Followed the recipe throughout. The only changes made are the addition of herbs - 2t basil, 1/4 t garlic powder and 1t oregano.  It's so easy and pleasing.  Thank you Cindi for sharing the recipe.

Followed other's ideas and used oveo instead of butter but I used 2 tbls fresh rosemary, 1 tsp roasted garlic and 1 tsp dried oregano and I don't know if it's my meds or just old age but I couldn't really taste any of the ingredients.  I'll be asking a neighbor to try and then give me his observations.  I'll let y' all know how it comes out. L.

This turned out great! Made this exactly as directed, with the addition of 1/2C. grated Parmesan cheese! I'm sure this would be good with fresh pressed garlic in it too!

"This bread is the best bread in the history of bread." a quote from the hubby. I, too, used olive oil, added some Italian seasoning, and hand mixed with a wooden spoon just to avoid the trouble of cleaning the mixer. I doubled the recipe and am so glad I did. Perfect crispy crust, perfect fluffy and tender middle.

I'm very new to making bread, and since coming across this recipe I've stopped trying new ones. I love it. It's so simple and makes very delicious bread. Like many of the reviewers, I switch out herbs based on what I have, but it always tastes great.

This is the easiest bread I have ever made!  It has good flavor and is nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder but other than that I followed the directions exactly.  I will probably add more of the parsley, rosemary, thyme and garlic so it has a little bit more flavor.  Overall very very please and will be making this many more times.

Pretty good bread and easy too.  I did use the breadmaker to mix but I was tired last night and multitasking.  I didn't really modify the recipe, and the bread and water amount was spot on--guess it must not be too humid here!  The baking time and temp is what I generally use, although it depends on the bread as to whether it needs longer or not.  It took about 50 minutes or so in my oven.  If it doesn't work in your oven, try 350 instead--it's just a matter of experimentiing.  It turned out a nice, soft bread with a good crumb.  Excellent for sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent bread! I put dried chives in mine because I didn't have any rosemary. My loaf raised a lot more then the one in the picture, but turned out great! I served it with the lentil, curry soup from Allrecipes and both were a hit!

I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and substituted 1 teaspoon of butter flavored olive oil for margarine and added to batter instead of brushing loaf with margarine. Delicious and super easy. This will complement any pasta dish, hearty soup, or stew beautifully.

I baked a loaf of Herb Batter Bread starting at around 5:30 this morning. By 10:30 I was on my way with it through a snowstorm to cheer up my friend. We shared half a loaf of bread. My friend said, "I'm in my happy place." I said, "Perfect."

This has been a hit with everyone who's eaten it. Has a good texture and a very nice flavor. I have made it several times. The first time I did it as written but each time after that I have swapped the herbs around to compliment my meal. However it's flavored its always good.

This is the best ever. Easy and an excellent consistency.  The kitchen smelled heavenly while it was baking. I didn't change a thing. My kneaded breads are heavier. This loaf was light and airy. It's my go to forever now.

I followed the recipe to the letter, using fresh parsley and rosemary.  It was delicious.  I might ramp up the amount of parsley.

Made this at least a dozen times. The only changes I made  was to double rosemary to 1 tsp and add 1 tsp chives. I didn't have any problems with a hand held mixer. I bake mine about 33 min and seal it in cling  wrap 15 min after it comes out. This keeps the crust from getting too hard and makes it very easy to slice it like bread.

Made this a dozen times now. My husband begs me to make it and the kids even love it. I've been taking it to family events with rave reviews.

I made this as written, except I used about a tablespoon of chopped fresh rosemary instead of dried because I had a lot of it in my garden. This bread is amazing, with a crisp crust and light, tender interior. It made the house smell so good!  I love that it is so easy to make. I'll definitely be making this again.

I've made this recipe about a million times now with the herbs, plain, and with honey and cinnamon. It's just straight up fantastic. I never really am to concerned about how much time I spend mixing the ingredients, which is perhaps mine never comes out as a batter, but a full on dough? I actually prefer to have it be more of a dough than batter because it's easier to work with. I also have totally let my dough rise for like an hour on the second rise and all that happened was I got a larger, slightly more crumb-y dough. I DO always pull it out of the oven after 40 min, because in my experience 40 min is perfect for this recipe and it is always perfectly done! I don't even buy sandwich bread at the store anymore. No joke!

Once upon a time I had a recipe for "casserole bread" that was a favorite.  No idea where that recipe is now, but this one is as good as or better!  Followed the recipe exactly except for substituting olive oil for the shortening.  Could not WAIT to cut the bread!  My old recipe had the option of adding shredded cheese, so next time I plan to try it.  Make sure you start early to allow for rising time.

This bread was so easy, and just wonderful!  I served it with chicken cacciatore, and my family couldn't get enough of it.  Next time I'll make 2 loaves!!
