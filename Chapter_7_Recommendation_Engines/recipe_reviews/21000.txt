A note to a vegans: Emes kosher gel is not vegan. Vegan Supreme marshmallows recently went out of business when they discovered that Emes kosher does contain animal products. Find out more in the Sept/Oct issue of VegNews magazine. Use agar as an alternative gelling agent.

I hope that the person who posted this recipe will tell me how she whipped the marshmallows. I tried this twice. I used a thermometer to judge the temperature, but when I beat it, it turned to dust. I am desperate to find a vegetarian marshmallow recipe. I used a stand mixer. Too much power?

This recipe is not very good. When I tried to "whip" the "marshmellows", the off-white mixture became clumpy and crumb-like.

Hah, well, the recipe didn't work at all for marshmallows, but all was not lost! I heated it to around 20 degrees hotter, then added some powdered ginger and clove, and now I've got myself some tasty hard candies. =p
There is definitely some sort of ingredient or two missing in this recipe..

I think this recipe is missing agar agar or gelatin. Because you can't make marshmallows without one of those.

Hmm. I would be careful of any marshmallow recipes that do not contain agar agar,pectin,or gelatin to give that chewy texture...

I whipped and whipped and whipped and unfortunately the gunk never whipped!  It remained thick and liquidy. It's great that some people had success, I wish I knew how you did it.

Excellent recipe for me. Confections can sometimes be difficult to make. High humidity can keep this recipe from working.

Thank you for posting this. I had a marshmallow recipe years ago but I had lost it. I've made this and it's a cooking challenge! If you have a lot of cooking under your belt, yes I'm chubby, you know that you will have grains of sugar crystals in your final product if you don't melt all the sugar grain in the liquid over med. heat before it comes to a boil. I found that out the hard way a long time ago. As soon as the sugar is melted and the liquid is not boiling yet, use a wet cloth or paper towel and wipe away the extra grains of sugar. This works with brittles and other candies too.

This recipe didn't work for me either.  When I turned the mixer on I had to clear the kitchen to avoid someone getting hurt as the molten hot spatters turned to hard little pellets!!!  What a mess!!

My step-daughter is a vegetarian, like her parents, but of course, since she's 8 years-old, marshmallows have quite a pull on her... She wants so bad to try them! So i've been looking for recipes. 
I've found online a recipe with agar agar, but since I didn't have any (yet! will go get some today!), I decided to give this recipe a try, even though it's so badly rated. 
I read all the reviews, and hoped I would be one of the two or three people who commented here, who successfully made marshmallows from this recipe. 
Unfortunately... no. The crumbly white mess is here to stay. I put the saucepan and everything else that touched it into hot water, so it doesn't set and I have an easier time washing it; and I'm gonna look into candy recipes so that I can use the "stuff" (for lack of better word) into something else. 
Now, the lack of any gelatin/agar agar/other "jellifying" agents must account for something.

I completely agree that this recipe needs some sort of gelatin-like ingredient, otherwise it's just a recipe for plain ol' hard candy.

I was in a hurry and couldn't find my trusted marshmallow recipe.  So I found this one and didn't bother reading the reviews.  I wish I had!  After two ruined batches, which came out like thick, gooey, fondant for dipped chocolates rather than marshmallows, I give up!  How these are supposed to whip into marshmallow cream is beyond me.

Wasted 6 cups of sugar and 1 hour of my time. Turns to powder every time I whip it. Something's definitely missing. Wish I had read the reviews before I started. Won't make that mistake again!!

All three times that I tried to make it, it never turned out!  I dont know if the directions are wrong or just not specific enough but definately not one that I would recommend!

There is a product called Eme's Kosher Gel; it is a VEGAN alternative to gelatin, and I've used it a few times to make marshmallows.  They actually used to market incredible vegan marshmallows, but I haven't been able to find those for awhile.  The company is located in Lombard, IL.

For me, this didn't work out as a marshmallow recipe.  It definitely needed gelatin or a substitute.  After it crumbled in the mixer, I decided to add orange extract and a splash of water and it made a wonderful center for shaping and dipping in chocolate!

I followed the directions exactly and they came out good. I was able to save the cut marshmallows in a bag for a couple of weeks. I was skeptical of the no gelatin, but wanted to try it. I used a stand mixer. The temperature of the sugar is very important. I imagine if it came out a hard lump, the sugar was cooked too much.

You can't make marshmallows without a thickening agent. This recipient also doesn't say what speed you're supposed to mix the liquid at.  When I tried to pour it into the pan it hardened almost instantly.  It basically looks and tastes like really stale frosting. I'd give it a 0

I created an account with allrecipes.com specifically to tell people not to bother with this recipe. What people are saying about it creating nothing but hard sugar cubes is absolutely true, without hyperbole.  Keep searching for another recipe, folks and don't waste your ingredients and time with this utter failure of a recipe.

I made this and it turn out into little pellets. I think I over heated it becuase I did the water test and it was a little to hard of a ball. I would suggest heating it to about 225. Other than that I think it is a pretty good recipe.

Followed the recipe and made the most delicious marshmallows!  Will make again, and try different flavors next time!  So worth the time and effort for the flavor..  The hardest part is waiting until they are ready to cut and eat.

I should have read the reviews before I even attempted making this because I got the results that a lot of you got which was a clumpy gritty mess and nothing was "whipped"

Definitely will NOT make again. I should have read reviews 1st but I didn't have any gelatin on hand so it sounded like a good receipt to try.  I had not beaten half of the time when I saw what previous reviewer meant. Turned granular. I just wasted 3 cups of sugar.
