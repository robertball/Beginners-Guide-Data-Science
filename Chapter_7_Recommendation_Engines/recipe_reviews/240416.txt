Note: be sure to stir and not shake this drink. Shaking will cause the drink to become cloudy and lessen the flavors.

Funny thing is that I don't like Campari or Gin on their own but combined together with vermouth and the drink becomes one of my favourite drinks. Did not add simple syrup as I like the slightly bitter taste. Use two slices  of orange and no other fruit works.

Adding the simple syrup really ruined it.  Too sweet....not for me.
