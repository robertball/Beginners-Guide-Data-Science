I was having a hard time getting them to stay together.  I added an egg and that seemed to help tremendously!

This one is sooo good!  Was wondering what to do with the canned cream corn I bought by mistake! Voilla a great idea.  I did refrigerate before cooking so it was easy to patty up. thanks and so very very good.

These are absolutely delicious! However, I omitted the Tabasco because I can't do hot. Also, instead of using seasoned breadcrumbs, I used plain and then seasoned the cakes myself with Italian seasoning, paprika, dry mustard, and celery salt. They came out extremely delicious!

The final product was quite tasty (even if you don't like creamed corn).  We made the initial mistake of messing with the proportions (more crab, less corn) and the cakes didn't hold together well.  Once we corrected that, it was smooth sailing.  The whole family enjoyed them.

Made these for my husband's birthday and they were easy and delicious!  Very tasty!  Some of the other reviewers complained that they had trouble getting the cakes to hold together, but I had no problem at all.  The trick may have been that when I mixed the ingredients together, I used a fork to break up all the crab pieces, so that the entire mixture had a "tuna salad" type consistency.  That way, the cakes held together very nicely.  Just in case, I also put the cakes in the refrigerator for about ten minutes before I fried them, but I really think it was the mixing that did the trick.  
A P.S. TO THIS REVIEW.  I have made these several times since I most recently wrote this review, but tonight I bought canned "crabmeat" instead of the canned "lump crab" I have used in the past.  Now I understand why other reviewers have so much trouble with the cakes falling apart!  Use canned "lump crab", and break up the pieces with a fork.  Your cakes will stay together.  Do not use the "crabmeat" that is shredded into tiny pieces in the can!!

This recipe is excellent. My fiance, who is not a seafood fan, loves them. I am not a fan of mayo and I don't eat eggs. This recipe allows me to enjoy crab cakes without those ingredients that  keep me away from them. Really good recipe. :-) Thanks

I was very disappointed. I ended up adding A LOT of breadcrumbs and the patties still didn't hold together well. Plus they were not very flavorful. I may try again and add an egg, cracker crumbs, more seasoning of some type.

Very tasty! I followed the recipe and this worked out wonderful. I did put it in the refrigerator for about 20-30 minutes so the mix could harden. When I was done, I had extra bread crumbs left so I made the mix again this time using tuna and it was good although a little on the dryer side.

These are pretty good. I was hoping for kid friendly, but it didn't make that cut. Somewhat budget friendly at approx $8 for all ingredients. I mixed the ingredients and placed in the fridge in patties and didn't have too much trouble keeping them in shape. If I do make this again, I will blend the creamed corn first so that pieces of corn are not obvious on the cakes..that raised an eye brow or two :)

They had nice consistency and texture stayed together well, but were really bland. They just need something...I don't know what though.

Just made these for lunch. Very good but I think I will use less corn next time but it was still very good. Very moist and crunchy also.

It tastes ok, but I could not get the patties to stick together!  It ended up coming out like crab-mush.  Suggestions?

Easy. Relatively simple and cheap ingredients. And tasted great! I did refrigerate the mix for 15-20min before making them into patties and I think that helped. I love corn and I love crab cakes!

So Good! I threw in some chopped red bell pepper for color and flavor and used sirachi sauce instead of tabasco. also used small chopped regular onion in place of green.

These were good. I think I will use just a little less bread crumbs next time cuae it seemed to take away the flavor of the crab.
