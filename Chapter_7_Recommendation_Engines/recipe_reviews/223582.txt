Followed the recipe as is, but doubled it.  It was really good.  It was quick and easy and my husband liked it.  Will be cooking it a lot.

Used this recipe to try to replicate wraps we got from a food cart at a festival a while back. Not as good as the food cart's wraps, but close enough to satisfy our craving!

Good base. Added fresh ginger and a dried chili pepper from the garden. Also added chopped garlic and water chestnuts. Next time I will add crushed peanuts! Delicious! And so quick and easy to throw together.

I used the recipe for best thai peanut sauce but didn't add the hot sauce as I don't like spicy and it was excellent in this recipe.

My family loved this. We did follow the reviews and cooked with some fresh garlic, ginger, red and yellow peppers. We also made the surprising and spicy peanut sauce. All together was amazing.

I was surprised by how good this was! Followed other reviewers advice of making it a wrap and adding just a little bit of ginger, red pepper flakes and soy sauce.

This was pretty good. I used Tahini instead of peanut sauce, canned chunk chicken, a little soy sauce, a little sriracha and peanuts. I think next time I will try using the Surprising and Spicy Peanut Sauce as SunnyDaysNora suggested.

This is easy and delicious. I prefer it served with/over rice. it's a little too juicy to be wrapped in a tortilla - it's too drippy. I think this would be delicious with slivered almonds, also.
