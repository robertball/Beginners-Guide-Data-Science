Let me tell you... I never, I mean NEVER ever want to eat any other kind of shrimp other than these again! OMG! They are utterly delicious!   I did change it slightly... I was having a party consisting of 50+ people coming so I had to up the quantities.  Upon reading other reviews, I made the following changes... I used 6 pounds of shrimp, 9 jalapenos, 5 large lime (just the juice, I guess in my rush, I didn't remember to zest them), 7 heaping tablespoons minced garlic, 2 cups fresh cilantro, 2 cups sweetened shredded coconut, 1 cup oil & 1 cup soy sauce.  I also added one can of coconut milk to the mix.  Zipped everything through my food processor and marinated the shrimp for 3-4 hours. My marinade was not thick but it was chunky and when I skewered them, I made sure I didn't shake anything off of them, so what stuck to the shrimp stayed on the shrimp.  Hubby grilled them up and these were cleared out in no time at all!  Even my husbands family who usually doesn't comment on the food was asking what was in them! That tells me something... Yum! I can't wait to eat these again!

I made this for a couple of my girlfriends...and they loved it.  I used coconut milk instead of shredded.  I also added some chipolte powder, an Anaheim pepper because I only had one jalapeno, and a touch of agave nectar.  very tasty:>

I made this recipe for my mother, sister and very picky nephew who all loved it.  I only used about 1/8 cup of soy sauce and the flavor was still a little strong, so next time I would cut back on that. I'd strongly suggest adding some kind of chili powder for a little more flavor. Also, I made a 2nd batch of marinade and added 1/4 cup mayo to use as a dipping sauce that ended up being a huge hit.  I was a little disappointed that the coconut flavor did not stand out at all against the heavy lime and cilantro, but that was probably my own fault for not using fresh coconut.  Still a delicious dish that will definitely become a regular at BBQs.

This dish is amazing! I did alter it a bit however... added 1/3 cup of lime juice, 2 tbs of coconut milk, 1 tbs cayenne pepper, 2 tbs chili powder. When grilling poured some of the extra marinade onto the shrimp, the grill almost toasted the coconut which was great. Then served up the last bit of the extra marinade as a dipping sauce, was excellent!

I really enjoyed this recipe; the marinade has a good flavor. I'm not a huge soy fan, so I cut back on it just a tad. I was a bit disappointed (no fault to the recipe) that my jalapenos didn't offer much heat so I'll be sure to taste them beforehand next time. I'll definitely make these again - tasty and easy to make!

Very good, but ended up pretty salty.  I'll use low sodium soy sauce next time.  This can be used as a side dish or use larger shrimp and make it a main course.  I altered this recipe using half the amount of jalapenos and used thyme instead of cilantro (as I am not a fan.)  Turned out well.

This is an absolutely amazing recipe! I did make one modification, however. Instead of including the jalepenos, I opted for serrano peppers. My family was literally salivating for more after they tore through them. I loved it. I think I'll use this dish as a reward.

This is a fantastic (and fantastically easy) recipe.  The only thing I changed was to set aside a few tablespoons of the marinade to brush on while grilling.

This marinade is really delicious! I didn't have jalepenos, so just added a bit of sriracha and that gave it are really nice kick and I highly recommend that addition to anyone looking for more heat in the dish. I also had some coconut milk which I also added and I think it gave it a stronger coconut flavor than had I only used shredded coconut. This recipe is also very successful in a pan. Highly recommend!

The heat from the jalapeno drowned out the other flavors.  Next time, I will reduce the jalapeno.  For the person looking for a spicy jalapeno:  look for one with "stripess" or streaks that give it the appearance that it's bursting from it's skin.  Those usually have more heat.

Very delicious....I only added 1 jalapeño and put it in a ziploc bag as the marinade is very chunky and the first time I made it from a bowl not everything was coated! Amazing recipe!

I wasn't so sure about this recipe after putting the marinade together, as it didn't look very appetizing,but the flavors really blended together and made a good shrimp.  It was spicy, but not too spicy. The coconut flavor wasn't very strong though.  I may try adding coconut milk like other reviewers did next time.

My whole family loved this recipe, including my two young sons.  The marinade was spicy but also kept a great flavor.  It only took minutes to make using a food processer.  I served the shrimp on a bed of rice and it was delicious. My husband said this is a keeper!

My Housemates loved this. I thought it was good but couldn't really taste enough coconut. Next time maybe I would add coconut milk to thin out the marinade (was really thick!) and give an extra coconut kick.

Very tasty.  The jalapeno was just enough spice to tingle the lips.  I served the shrimp over rice pilaf and the combination was great!

Made exactly as it but can only give one star!  The soy sauce totally overpowered everything and the shrimp simply tasted overly salty and soy-ish!  I will try this again with about 25% of the soy that it calls for and may add some brown sugar, maybe 50% more lime juice and garlic and will leave in some seeds from the jalapenos to bring some heat!

This was a good "Asian" Grilled Shrimp recipe, but I couldn't taste any coconut.  I made a half batch but added almost the full amount of coconut as well as at least 3 tbs of coconut milk.  I think the soy sauce is such a strong flavor it overpowers other flavors.  As I said, good as a soy-garlic grilled shrimp.  If I made again I'd cut way back or even omit the soy sauce and just use a little or use all coconut milk in the marinade.

We loved this recipe.  Didn't even use the food processor, just through the shrimp in the mixture and let marinade.  Might use a little more coconut or coconut milk nextime though

Perfect! Fresh tasting with a little heat. Followed the recipe exactly except used 2 pounds of jumbo shrimp.  There was plenty of marinade. Also it didn't say either way but had a coconut so used freshly grated coconut.

I served this recipe at a small dinner party and it was a huge hit. I served it over broccoli slaw with diced mango, toasted coconut and jalapeño tossed with avocado mayo dressing.  So good!   I am sure there are modifications that you will make but you don’t have to, this is good as written. Thank you!

Does every recipe on this site use garlic? You will not miss the garlic, trust me it is like adding salt, and you won't notice it is gone! I used 1 jalapeno, and I did not blend it either. Marinated for one hour and grilled, turned out great!

Didn't change a thing but next time I will use lg or ex lg shrimp.  They fit better on the skewers and don't cook as fast as the medium shrimp did.  If you use medium shrimp, buy 1 1/2 lbs.

Really, really loved this and since I'm working on losing weight it was a great choice. We used low-sodium soy sauce and unsweetened coconut which was a great option for texture without the syrupy taste I'm used to with most coconut shrimp recipes. I love spicy stuff, and could barely taste the jalapenos, so next time we'll at least double if not quadruple the peppers. We served it with coconut rice and black beans and it couldn't have been better.

After marinating, I tossed the shrimp to coat them with additional shredded coconut.  I also added pineapple, papaya and mango cubes to skewers.

Used a little less jalapeno and doubled the marinade but otherwise made as directed. Excellent. Will make again. Thank you.

I made the marinade the night before . The jalapeños didn't have much heat, so I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne.  Based on the reviews, I also added about 1/4 cup coconut milk and added a couple of hefty tablespoons in mayo for a dipping sauce. I marinated the shrimp the next morning for a few hours, and my husband grilled over low heat. They were really, really good. No one tasted any coconut (despite the coconut milk). The primary flavors were cilantro and jalapeño (the pepper, not the heat since they were seeded and not too spicy in the first place).  While I'd be tempted to omit the coconut, I think it probably adds something, maybe sweetness? So I won't. This is really easy to make, and I can't wait to try it on other stuff -- fish, chicken, scallops.

Served this to guests...looks fab, nice presentation. The shrimp was very good...i also used it with chicken breast chunks...both delicious...it was not too spicy with 2 jalapenos. The coconut flavor was not prominent and I'll try to bump that up next time somehow...i wanted more coconut...this recipe is a keeper.

I followed this recipe and made a delicious grilled shrimp treat.  My only change was to omit the skewers and use a Yoshi mat.  The results were exceptional.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I served with grilled asparagus and a spinach salad for a healthy delicious meal.  I was going to serve it Saturday night, but we postponed until Sunday, so it marinated over 24 hours.  It was very flavorful.  I was afraid it would be too spicy with the 2 jalepenos, but it was not.  It had a bit of a bit and lots of flavor.  Yummy!

Like a few others I used Serrano peppers instead of Jalapeno and wow this was AMAZING.  Will make regularly so awesome. I served it over a bed of Zatarrain's dirty rice.

oh my this was amazing! i came across this while looking for ideas to make dinner with cilantro and lime as my key components and wanted shrimp. this definitely caught my eye and now it's been put into my favorites.
i did make the following changes - i increased all liquids slightly as i was making double the shrimp. instead of jalepeno, i used anaheim peppers (didn't want it too spicy). and since i live in an apartment, i don't have a grill, so i just cooked them in my large skillet. (i may consider using coconut milk as some did for more of that coconut flavor).
the shrimp were tender and juicy and the sauce from the marinade was perfectly flavored. i did garnish with a little chopped cilantro mixed with a little of the coconut. 
thank you for providing the inspiration for my dinner!!

Loved these shrimps! Used fresh coconut and coconut milk. Wrapped shrimp in bacon (half a thin slice), and deep fried for 3 minutes at 350°.Set aside about 1/3 cup of marinade and mixed with mayo for dipping sauce. That made the dish!

I think these are the best shrimp I have ever had! Growing up on the Chesapeake Bay I would consider myself a seafood snob. These hands down are the best. I am forwarding the recipe on to all of my family members as we speak :-) The only changes I made was I used one seeded jalapeno instead of two jalapeno's and it was perfect. I also used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular.

1 tablespoon of lime, that's what I will try next time.  I used a whole lime as the recipe shows -- but it was very ripe and the shrimp ended up citrusy for my liking.  Next time I'll just measure a fixed amount of lime juice to control the taste.  Otherwise I liked the recipe.  I didn't find the marinade thick as much as I found it chunky.  Next time I would save a portion of clean marinade to make an dipping sauce with mayo as another review suggested.
