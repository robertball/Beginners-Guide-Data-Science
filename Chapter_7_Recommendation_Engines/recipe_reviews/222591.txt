What can I say - this is tasty and crunchy & easy too.  I made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012 - it didn't have a review or a picture.  I will use this again for sure.

I would add a little crushed nuts in the cornflake mix.

No changes....great to have on hand. I use this for fish as well. Normally I used bread crumbs, but the cornflakes give it a crunchier coating. Thanks for sharing!
