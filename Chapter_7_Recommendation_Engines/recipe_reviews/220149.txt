We enjoyed this very much. We used lite coconut milk. Next time we will add more than 1/2 t curry because we really like it.

This was so delicious, I simply made it as a main dish and steamed up some green beans to serve with it. I would have licked my plate if I didn't have any class- the coconut makes such a rich and creamy sauce for this dish!

Tasty. Served to dinner guests with basmati rice and had rave reviews. I wasn't thrilled with it but I certainly liked it. I might make it again.

A blend of delicious flavours. Delicate coconut, with a nice zing on the lips from the chilli pepper flakes. 
I whipped up this recipe for two in 45 minutes.

I substituted the cumin seeds with a 1/2 tsp. of cumin powder. I added half the chopped onions and half minced garlic in with it to give more flavour to the chicken. I cooked the chicken most of the way before adding the oil and veggies (tip: along with the carrots, I added broccoli crowns. It holds in the flavours really well!) 

For the spices I skipped the cinnamon, added an extra dash of pepper flakes, and upped the curry powder to  2 tsp. I also substituted the salt with lemon pepper then poured in the coconut milk right away so the flavours could blend as it simmered. 

5 stars, I couldn't believe how easy it was. Next time, I'll try fresh coriander/ cilantro garnish.
Yummy!

This was delicious! I made it because I had pretty much all the ingredients. If you don't, it's going to be a pricey meal because there are a lot of ingredients. We served it with brown rice, but was also really tasty in a wrap. Tip on ginger: We keep ours in our freezer and it has lasted months! We bring it out for our favorite Thai meals. I think it's also a little easier to grate when frozen ;)

Very excellent recipe.  I made a few adjustments to make it more specific to my taste.  I added ground cumin + black mustard seeds. I replaced the cinnamon with ground coriander.  I added peas and then garnished with fresh cilantro and almonds.  Fantastic!

It smells delicious and was exactly what I was looking for in terms of a curried dish. Unfortunately it was a little low on flavor once we were actually eating it. I'm still not sure what exactly to add but preferably something that will add a more savory or salty edge.

My husband has had authentic curry while on business in England, but had never had it made with coconut milk. He absolutely loved this recipe.  I used half the crushed red pepper and double the curry powder called for, and it came out wonderful.  This will become a new family favorite for sure!

This was amazing. I only added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and we were sweating. I also doubled the curry. . .  Excellent!

Made this tonight for a change from the usual.  I loved everything in the recipe.  But I do agree with another reviewer that it smells amazing while cooking, but to eat it, it was missing something.  I had to add quite a lot of salt ( I use sea salt) to get the other flavors more enhanced.  It was quite dull as written.  But the salt helped a lot.  I'm not a salt person by any means.  But this one needed it BADLY.  I also found a 14 oz can of coconut milk to be too much.  The sauce didn't thicken while simmering;  it was rather soupy.  I had to add a gravy thickener to get it to my liking.  I also found that the honey did absolutely nothing for flavor.  I even added a lot more and it didn't help really.  I wound up adding brown sugar (in addition to all the honey).  Overall, great texture and it smells wonderful.  But just needs a little tweaking.

made it for the second time tonight and its still pretty good, i think the first time i made it i threw in some snap peas. followed the recipe exactly tonight except i dont have cumin seed so i just heated about 1/4 tsp of powder in its place and halved the chicken breast and onion. left everything else at its regular measurements. mixed up a batch of my own improvised coconut rice. definitely a keeper, and im not even a huge curry fan.

Everyone in my family (very very picky little eaters and one big one) had eaten all the chicken. I only put a 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes cause they don't like hot spices. I also substituted ground cumin for the cumin seeds.

Liked it, put a bag of Asian veggie mix to add a little more. Would thicken it next time and serve over a rice noodle.

A tasty, healthy supper. I wanted more veggies, so in addition to the carrots and onion, I added a red pepper, yellow pepper, and two zucchinis. I also used leftover chicken rather than fresh (added it after the vegetables were getting soft). The adults and older kids enjoyed this, but the under-10 crowd didn't go for it.

I make this recipe all the time, it's a favorite in our house.  I tend to add a bit more curry (1 tbls) and generous tsps of red pepper flakes but otherwise, make it exactly as directed served over steamed fried noodles or rice. It's DELICIOUS! Easy and quick too.

Great taste from a simple recipes.  I found the recipe to be very fogiving.  I made my own coconut milk, use ground cumin instead of cumin seeds and doubled the spices because I'm a spicy chick :-).  All the flavors meld well.  I will difintely be making this again even though I'm not a big curry fan. Sweet and spicy perfection!  I also served this over steamed coconut rice, YUMMY!!

Very tasty curry; not bland for us. Served with basmati rice. Definitely will re do this recipe and play with the vegetable to change it up now and then but original recipe is very good.

Very yummy! Kicked up the curry and the red peppers by an extra heaping half a teaspoon each and was perfect spiciness for me and my spice loving boyfriend. Just used regular rice, but next time I will add some broccoli, yellow pepper and do up balsamic rice.

Quick/easy weeknight meal. Good, not great flavor blend, since I had to tone down the spice for "sensitive" palates/wimps, so that might have been the issue, so will try it again with more curry/cayenne.

I made this with only 2 chicken breasts but left everything else the same because I love sauce. I didn't have carrots but didn't miss them. Instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil and ended up adding considerably more curry powder after tasting the dish at the end of the cooking time. To me, it needed more of it. I didn't take any stars out though because the recipe does say "or more to taste". It was great with basmati rice.

Needed about 1/2-1 tsp salt. I diced up the chicken in 1 1/2" cubes before cooking. I added snap peas and sweet bell pepper slices during the last few minutes of cooking because I wanted a one-dish balanced meal and I had them on hand. I used 1 t curry; that was about right but will try 1 1/2 t next time. Served over long grain brown rice and it was delish!

I cooked this for my boyfriend and his sister who are "curry connoisseurs" and they absolutely loved it! I'm not a huge fan of cumin so I'd put a little less next time. I only used the seeds and no powder. I feel like using both would be overpowering. Overall it was definitely a tasty Indian-style curry!

This recipe gives a pretty balance of flavor for most curry lovers. For  those of you who found the flavor blanch or missing something, I have this suggestion: season the chicken ahead with salt and pepper and then put spices in while stir frying the chicken including ginger, garlic, curry, cinnimon, cumin and I added also a bit of all spices until the chicken's done. I am sure that you will find the same recipe taste different.

This smells heavenly!  I made a few modifications, added 1/2 tsp of coriander, substituted freshly grated nutmeg for cinnamon (thought I had some but didn't so I had to improvise).  Used scallions instead of onion and added snow peas for color and texture.  Served over Basmati rice and sprinkled some chopped cilantro, mint and peanuts over the top.


I reduced the red pepper flake by 1/2, I love spice but my body doesn't. **Edited to add, I didn't use cumin seeds, couldn't find them at Publix, so I just used ground cumin with the butter and then again with the spice mixture added later**.

I really liked this recipe.  However I made some changes out of necessity.  I used coconut oil instead of butter (we are dairy free).  I also used cumin instead of the seeds to season the oil.  I didn't drain the chicken or use additional veg oil, I just added all the other stuff to the skillet and cooked for a couple minutes.  I then added almond milk (what I had) instead of coconut milk.  This was delicious!  I think I am going to try adding a few tablespoons of peanut butter and ground peanut garnish next time and serve it over rice noodles instead of rice.

This was delicious! My picky teenagers loved it. My son even went back for seconds.  I used frozen stir fry veggies instead of fresh carrots. I’m adding it into the regular dinner rotation.

Delicious!  But somehow came out extra spicy.  I doubled the curry powder and added chopped red bell pepper. Family loved it.

loved this dish.  2 tsp of pepper flakes is spicy yo the lips.  if you dont like the spice reduce to 1 tsp.  I agree about missing a little flavor.  I served with soy sauce and that made a great addition to the flavors.  definitely would make again.

Added 2 yellow peppers after adding the coconut milk, added extra garlic, ginger and was heavy handed with the spices.  Added a large handful of cilantro at the very end. Would consider adding pineapple to mix it up a bit. Will totally make it again.

I believe that this recipe needs some explicit direction related to the amount of salt, which will bring out the flavor of all of the other awesome ingredients.  This needs more than just a pinch of salt or it will be bland.  I would increase the amount of curry and perhaps decrease by a little the amount of honey.  Otherwise, this rocks.  Thank you for sharing.  Will make this moving forward with some small adjustments to fit our taste.

I  found this to be a bit bland, as if there were a key note of flavor missing. I used fresh ingredients, so it can't be that. I compared the quantities to other recipes, and they were more or less equivalent. I'm thinking that maybe it was the absence of a 3rd vegetable -- maybe some green pepper, snow peas, or rabe? -- which would be a good idea, anyway, from the standpoint of nutrition and aesthetics. Or maybe a simple garnish of cilantro would do the trick.

I made this for dinner today after reading the reviews.  So I added bell pepper, (and because I have little ppl eating), I only added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 1 heaping tbsp honey.  I seasoned my chicken (600 gr) with the salt, black pepper and ground cumin, all in 1 tsp (I didn't have cumin seeds). I love curry so I added 3 tsp curry powder and because I added the salt and pepper for my chicken I substitute the salty for fish sauce (I tbsp) and kept the 1 tsp ground cumin from the recipe (also the ground cinnamon). Another issue the coconut milk for the my amount of chicken and veggies I only added +/- 300 ml. I didn't have a chance to take a pic, it was that good!!!

This is really good.  Based on other comments I doubled all the seasonings (except the red peppers which I halved). I added a teaspoon of garam masala seasoning as well.  I also let the dish simmer for about 25 minutes which really thickened it up and blended the flavors well.  I'll definitely make this again, will likely add almond slivers and another vegetable to it.

I gave this 4 stars because the kids, who like spicier food, really enjoyed this, but my boyfriend, who likes things a lot less spicy, did not. The thing to note is that I only added a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper and the recipe calls for 2 teaspoons. I'm not sure even the kids could've tolerated that amount! So I would recommend this recipe, but I would decrease the crushed red pepper. With all the other spices in the dish, the extra heat really isn't necessary.

I made it as is with the exception of the cumin seeds which I didn't have. I also used chicken thighs and just removed the skin. I added more honey and garlic and little less red peppers. Turned out great. It's a keeper.

The sauce is delicious! I added a small sweet potato sliced fairly thin in quarters instead of one of the carrots, and it added a really nice base. Served over jasmine rice with a bit of saffron. Yum!!

Letting this dish sit for a while before serving allowed the flavors to blend, and it was delicious. I was forced to make one change when I went to the pantry and realized I had used the coconut milk in another recipe. All I had was coconut Greek yogurt, so I added a 5.3 ounce container. It was the perfect amount of creamy goodness. When I make it in the future, I'll probably stick with the yogurt.

I had some leftover coconut milk so I decided to give this recipe a try and it was absolutely delicious! I did make a few changes: I substituted ground coriander for the cinnamon, I added some broccoli florets, and I omitted the red pepper flakes because I don't like my food spicy. I will definitely be making this again!

This is perfect!  To make it even better for my taste, I added extra curry powder, only half the ginger and also added some pineapple and put chopped peanuts on top.

Perfect!  Our family loved loved loved it!  This was a quick & easy meal.  I only used half of the red pepper flakes for fear it might get  little too hot.  It was great!  Served with cauliflower and brown basmati rice.

Easy to make and with a different flavor from the usual stir fry.  I used carrots, broccoli, and pea pods for my vegetables and used light coconut milk.

This was great.  User 1/2 the amount in crushed red pepper and it had the right amount of heat.. Any more and would have burned our lips off!  Served over Jasmine rice.  Very very tasty!

My son liked it but the rest of us thought it was a little too spicy even with 1 tsp rep pepper flakes and lacked flavor (even though used 2 tsp curry powder). I added green pepper and cilantro as suggested by others and liked those additions.

So amazing. Make it once a month for sure. I add about 1 1/2 tsp of medium curry powder and I add shredded coconut to the rice. One of the best curry recipes I have had.

Awesome! Doubled the recipe, but instead of doubling the chicken, added shrimp. Also added red bell pepper strips. Finally, added extra curry powder and red pepper flakes. I also did not discard the juice from the butter and chicken. I removed about half and then cooked the veggies and chicken in the juice. I did not add oil. Served over jasmine rice. Family loved it.

Amazing flavor. Drove the lunch crowd crazy because its so fragrant.  Just the right mix of spice and heat. Added white and green peppers for extra veggies. Also used 1Tbsp of curry powder and a little extra ground cumin for more intense flavor.

Made it according to directions. I liked the cumin seeds in addition to ground cumin, it was very fragrant while cooking. However, when we ate it, it felt like it was lacking in depth of flavor and texture. I felt like I was eating curry that was just short of good. The following night we made chicken curry again, fried the cumin seeds, but added Mae Ploy red chili paste (has lemongrass), Mae Ploy green chili paste (already has ginger), with green and red bell peppers, green beans, carrots, coco milk, and added the honey and a dash of cayenne. Turned out to be more flavorful with heat level 4/10.

So, I have to admit, I probably can't give this recipe a totally fair feedback because I did change it up a little.
I doubled the recipe to start. I doubled everything but the pepper flakes. I used coriander instead of cinnamon and just did a dash of cinnamon. I did 4 times as much curry powder as stated because out of all the reviews I read, people stated that it needed it. I personally think that is where it went wrong for me. Not positive but something was just a little bit off for me. My fault, not the recipe...
To remedy this I added a bit more honey to cut the over spiced taste. I also added some frozen peas for more veggie and color.
All that being said, my husband absolutely loved this. My oldest son said it was good. My youngest and I liked it well enough to eat it. So I have to try this again but follow the recipe completely with no wavering... good enough to give it another shot. :)  
I am trying to cut back on my carbs a little so I had mine over roasted cauliflower with just a small spoonful of rice on top, sprinkled with cilantro. My family ate it over rice with a little cauliflower on the side... :)

I took the advice of other reviewers and added more curry. I used Patak's mild  curry paste in a jar and ended up using 3 huge tablespoons. And plenty of salt and pepper. I also doubled the ginger. It was pretty tasty and easy to prepare.

Oh, this was soooo good!  It tastes very much like a chicken curry dish I used to get at my favorite Thai restaurant!  The honey and spices gave it a delicious taste.  Can't wait to share this with guests!

A few changes I made was to use coconut oil instead of vegetable, omitted the cummin seeds, ground cummin,and butter, and I grated the carrots and garlic.  I also put a few sprigs of cilantro on top.

Didn't have cumin seeds, so I just melted the butter and cooked the chicken in that, leaving out the oil in the next step. I also added half a red bell pepper that I had in my fridge. This turned out very good. Will def make again.

I had to use up some coconut milk that I had opened, so I tried this.  It was fantastic!  I added more curry powder and 1-1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes were enough for me.  I think that, instead of adding more curry powder, I would use curry paste because I thought it was a bit 'gritty'.  Threw in some peas and cilantro at the end, as others suggested.  Overall a great dish!

I thought this was good and easy to make.  We cut way back on the red pepper flakes since we don't like real spicy.  I probably used about 1/2tsp and it still had enough of a kick for us.  I didn't have the cumin seeds but I bet that would only have made it better.

Excellent flavor and I was able to swap out the honey for a conservative amount of Stevia. I blended up fresh coconut meat with a little of the coconut water (for the coconut milk) and I only used 1T of oil and substituted Coconut Oil. These changes allowed it to be compatible with the Body Ecology Diet! I steamed extra veggies (Kale and Collards) and added a large scoop of Sauerkraut on top. Delicious! Thank you!

The boys loved it. The sauce was a little spicy for the ten year old but he loved the chicken. I used dried onions & garlic with no carrots but still great. Served it over rice. Ten thumbs up. We will make this again. Thanks greystonecooks!!

Excellent! Great spice combination, easy to throw together. Did not have red pepper flakes at my disposal but used Korean "gojujang" instead and that worked fine. Will definitely make this dish again :)
