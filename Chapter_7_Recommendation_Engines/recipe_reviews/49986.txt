I fixed the problem with this drink.  I added two more scoops of ice cream, vanilla extract and 6 cubes of ice.  This took away its runniness, i also added peanut butter.   Fantastic Drink

This gets a four because of the surprising yet ingenious ingredient of maple syrup which just makes the shake! But- beware it was very runny. I more than doubled the icecream and it was still runny. I also put peanut butter in it- mm mm good. It would get a 5 but it was runny...

This was way too sweet for my taste. I wonder if it's because I used 'maple flavoured' syrup instead of pure syrup?

This was good.  The idea to add PB adn ice along with doubling the icecream was a great suggestion!

i tried it and handed it out to my friends at a meeting. Over 20 people were there who didn't like it.
