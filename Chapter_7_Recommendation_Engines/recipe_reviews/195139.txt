"These are the best ribs I've ever had," were the first words out of my husband's mouth. I had almost 4 pounds of baby backs, and I went with the 12-oz. bottle of Lawry's Mesquite Marinade.  I added an extra onion, quartered, to the par-boil liquid.  The onions were so delicious at the end of cooking, that I served them as a perfect side dish with a pat of butter, S&P.  I also added a few extra bay leaves and one Tbs. of minced garlic-from-the-jar to the par-boil liquid. Omitted the brown sugar, because I didn't want sweet ribs, but I'll try the sugar another time.  Grilled the ribs 7 minutes per side.  Tender and moist results -- outstanding! Thanks for this simple, yet over-the-top delicious recipe -- fit for a king!!
P.S.  It's now July 5, 2010, and this is still my go-to recipe for babyback ribs.  Everyone loves them.  I now throw in about 4 onions to serve as a side dish.  I think that the sugar can make these ribs too sweet, compromising the good "barbecue" taste.  Lastly, the leftover broth is delicious, so I chill it overnight, skim the solidified fat layer, and then use it for other dishes.  For example, I cook Italian sausages in a cup or two of the rib broth to make subs.  I also make a huge pot roast in the crockpot with the rib broth mixed with half pkg. of dry onion soup and sometimes throw in a  can of mushroom soup.  You can think of all sorts of uses for the broth.

I'm glad I went for this one although there hadn't been any reviews before mine.  I loved it. We loved it.  The changes I made were minor.  I added 1 more bay leaf, quartered a large onion and sprinkled some rub into the water mix as well.  It smelled great as it was cooking and our mouths were salivating even prior to grilling.  I doubled the sauce because I had 3 racks of ribs.  I think that next time I'll either use a different BBQ sauce than Sweet Baby Ray's or use it but decrease the brown.  It was just a tad sweeter than I've liked.  But over all it was moist and fantastic!

My potluck crowd kept asking for more! It was tender after the  boil and the bbq-brown sugar glaze topped it off well; especially using Stubb's or Rudy's bbq sauce. I used country style ribs instead of baby back. I didn't have a large stockpot so I split the ribs into 2 pots with each pot consisting of water to cover, 1/2 the marinade, 2 bay leaves, 1/4 large onion. Total prep and cooking time took no more than 1hr -- too easy!

Seriously Yummy and Easy!  I didn't have "marinade" so I just used BBQ sauce in the water...soooo good!

Great recipe! The first time we made them, the ribs burned on the bbq because of the brown sugar in the sauce, but the second time we put the sauce on later and they turned out perfectly...not too tender that they fall off the bone, but so tender that they're easy to eat! Thanks for the base for great ribs!

Simple recipe that tastes like you've slow cooked the baby backs for hours. I agree with some of the other reviews that using either BBQ sauce or mesquite marinade in the stockpot makes no difference in the finished product. The one thing that I've tried different was to remove the thin membrane that you typically find covering racks of ribs.... I got much better feedback from the racks in which I left the membrane in tact.... I won't ever use another recipe for rigs again....this one's a keeper!

Let me preface by saying I don't love ribs of any kind, baby back, country, spare ribs, etc.  I made this recipe for some family members that do love ribs.  This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I was skeptical because this was so easy, but loved that this took so few ingredients, and tasted like I slow cooked these all day.  If you like your bbq sauce a touch spicy or are used to spicy barbeque in general, I put some louisiana hot sauce on mine.  Delicious.  Tender without falling apart.  Will definitely be my go to recipe for ribs!

These are great.  Here are a few suggestions:  1.  Peel cavity side to expose fat.  More fat will be boiled away.  If rack is thick, simmer for a full hour.  2.  Formulate witch's brew with beef bouillon and spices to make beef stew.  After boiling ribs, chill liquid, skim fat, and prepare stew.  3.  Cut ribs in 2-bone sections, paint with a variety of sauces and then refrigerate or freeze for serving as hors d'oeuvres or small meals later.  4.  Painted sections carmelize nicely on grill, under broiler and even in the microwave.  Sometimes I sprinkle a little bourbon on them.

Wow. These made me wish I had bought more ribs. I had to slightly alter the recipe and it still came out wonderful. I didn't have any mesquite marinade, but I had mesquite rub, so I added about a tablespoon of that to the water. My timing was off with my family, so the ribs ended up having to sit in the water an extra 30 minutes. I turned off the heat and just let them soak. No problems, they were very tender, but still stayed on the bone so I could move them to the grill. Excellent recipe!

My husband found this recipe, and made them.  They are wonderful, very tender, full of flavor.  My neighbor commented how good they smelled, and that was during the boiling part! My son loved them, and he is 20 months old.  If you do have leftovers, they are better the next day!

We didn't use the brown sugar because we used this local place's bbq sauce (its amazing by itself).  Because the recipes says to cook it in the stock pot, the bbq sauce we brushed it with after didn't "seep" in very well.  In the future, I might just marinade the ribs over night and grill them after brushing them with bbq sauce.

Have prepared 3 times and always enjoyed by all.  I used 2 T of Durkee's smoked  mesquite flavored seasoning in the water.  My daughter tried the recipe with beef ribs and it didn't turn out well (?).

These were amazing!! My husband is a rib "snob" and loved them. They were so easy to prepare and yummy.  Will prepare often this summer. Update 09.05.16.  Still love these ribs.  I use either Jack Daniels liquid mesquite marinade or (if Target is out) McCormick's dry mesquite marinade. Top off with Sweet Baby Rays and finish off in the oven (on cookie racks set on top of  a cookie sheet).   Since we like things sweet, I do mix the brown sugar and bbq sauce.

This is the first time I have made ribs that actually tasted decent. I changed it up a little and marinated them a whole day in the mesquite before boiling them, and then I broiled them. They were yummy!

A very easy recipe that brings out great taste in the pork.  I didn't have the marinade, so I used Stubb's BBQ and it was delicious.

Hands down the best pork ribs I have ever had! I've got to think that my beloved Gates BBQ sauce had a hand to play it that though. BBQ isn't BBQ unless it involves Kansas City's finest sauce in my opinion. This would work with any sauce and make the most tender fall off the bone ribs but if you go with your favorite sauce, you will end up with the very best ribs you have ever had in your life! YUM!

I made some variations to the recipe, I did not have pay leaves so I added my 4 go to spices, Oregano, Basil, Italian seasoning, and Thyme about a dash each. 

I diced the onions, and added two cloves of garlic

also did not have the marinade so I put garlic bbq sauce in the water

and finally I do not have a BBQ, so I placed it in the oven at 350 degrees F. and covered it in Aluminum foil 

but I followed all the directions to the tee, and I am not a fan of ribs and could have ate them all myself, they were fall of the bone good.

and I am keeping the broth for a stew or to slow cook a roast like others have suggested.... 

Definitely my new go to recipe for Back Rips... everyone loved them

I'm not very experienced with Ribs and didn't want something that was going to take all day. This was such a great recipe.  Super easy and the ribs turned out very tender and were falling off the bone.  Instead of the Marinade I used a packet of mesquite flavored Grill Mates seasoning with a little bit of BBQ sauce also.  Everyone LOVED them!

I just made these yesterday for my family and some friends and they were absolutely, falling off the bone delicious! I was only able to get a bottle of liquid smoke at the store so I used that, and I believe I had the ribs simmering for at least an hour. I slathered them with BBQ sauce and had them on the grill for only ten minutes or so. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I have experimented with lots of ways to cook ribs and this one gets first prize!

Best tasting ribs I have eaten.  My brother has been doing his special ribs for the family and  now all he cooks is the Hoot-n Holler ribs.  My girfriend even asked for these for her special birthday dinner.  They are so easy to do is another reason I love them.

I made these trwice already. Thenfirst time I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. A bit sweet but perfect.  Today I used all the ingredients but omitted the brown sugar completely.  I used my favoritew Sweet Baby Rays and they were again, perfect, just not soooo sweet. This is a family favorite.

these ribs were tender and moist, but boiling them took away some of the flavor and made the meat bland.  My favorite way to do ribs is still to rub with cajun seasoning, grill slowly and put the barbecue sauce on about 5 minutes before I take them off.

I thought the texture of these ribs was the best.  It wasn't so tender that the meat fell off the ribs, but it wasn't difficult to eat the meat right off the bone either.  It was just right.  I also think boiling in the marinade flavored the meat all the way through and made the final result more tasty.

I had bought the country style ribs and worried it might wreck the recipe but nope!!! They were so good.  I didn't have the mesquite marinade so I poured about 4TBSP of liquid smoke per rack into the pot with 2TBSP per rack of Apple Cider Vinegar AND 1/4 cup of Johnnys Salt. 20 minutes before I pulled them off the stove I added 1/2 cup BBQ sauce into the pot.  Followed the recipe from then on.

Fast and Easy. I used 5 lbs of Country Style Pork Ribs. Added 1 bottle of Mesquite Marinade and 1 packet of Grill Mates Mesquite Marinade Mix. Followed the recipe exactly from there, except I left out the Brown Sugar. It didn't sound right with Open Pit BBQ Sauce.

Some people said the Marinade doesn't make a difference, but I can tell you that it does. You can certainly taste it. Perhaps I used too much, but the flavor was apparent.

I was worried that the meat wouldn't be tender enough because people said it was not "fall off the bone." Well, it is tender enough and it will fall off the bone if you are not careful.

The only thing I would do differently is slather the ribs in sauce a couple more times. I like wet ribs and although these ribs had nice flavor, a little extra sauce would have been good.

Extremely tender..the meat came right off the bones. I used KC Masterpiece Mesquite marinade, 4 bay leaves, a large onion and about 4 lbs of baby back ribs, and finished them on the grill with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (did not add sugar).  My husband didn't think they were spicy enough and added some pepper to his so next time I'll use a spicier BBQ sauce.

This is a great way to cook ribs!  I have used this recipe several times.  It is easy with excellent results every time. The only thing I do different is omit the sugar because the barbeque sauce I use (Bullseye Guinness) already has enough in it for our liking.  I also put whatever kind of broth I have on hand in the boiling liquid.  If I don't have the marinade I just use barbeque sauce instead and it makes no difference. Last time, after taking the ribs out to grill I threw some new potatoes and frozen corn-on-the-cob in the pot boiled until tender.  Wa-La!  A whole meal! Turned out great!

These were great.  My husband thought boiling for 45 mins was WAY to long, but they were oh so tender!  We did omit the brown sugar due to other reviews.

I had never cooked ribs before trying this recipe. I was so disappointed that I didn't buy more ribs to cook. I had aa problem finding mesquite marinade so I purchased mesquite seasoning to throw in the water while the ribs were boiling. I also poured some of the bbq sauce in while the ribs were boiling. Wondeerfully easy and delicious recipe.

I used country ribs and they turned out great!  I cooked them on an electric grill w/out a cover so I wonder if they would turn out a little more tasty if I had.  Definitely would make again.

I had a real hankerin' for baby back ribs a few weeks ago, so tried this recipe.  Boy am I glad I did.  It was great!  Had it for a cookout with family and friends, and everyone raved about how good they were.  Couldn't believe how easy it was.  Having a family reunion in a couple weeks, and plan on making these again.

YUM! My husband's favorite rib recipe. He also uses BBQ sauce in the water instead of marinade.

Added a little liquid smoke to the pot when boiling meat but by far, this recipe will knock your socks off.

These are the best we have ever made.  I save the marinade used on the ribs, does take a large container.  Then I marinade brats before grilling.  I also added butter and whiskey to the bought barbeque sauce.

Awesome and easy recipe!  I was never a "rib person" before, but after trying this recipe, I am a convert, as well as my kids.  I never seem to have the mesquite flavoring (and never seem to remember it while shopping), so I usually just use two onions and the bay leaves when boiling the ribs.  No worries, because after brushing on Sweet Baby Ray's original barbeque sauce, that is all we need.  The first time I made these, my husband asked where I got the recipe from.  I told him, and he said "Be sure not to lose it!"  Mt kids even eat these ribs, and they are finicky eaters.  I've even boiled the ribs the day before, let them sit in the refrigerator overnight and cooked them the next day.  GREAT for saving time after being at work!  We're having these tonight with potato salad and grilled corn on the cob.  Yum!!

I made this recipe except instead of boiling the ribs I baked them in a 300 degree oven for 2-1/2 hours.  Followed everything else the same.  They were very good!

THE best ribs.  I simmered them for over 1 1/2 hours until just tender.  As soon as I took them out of the broth I slathered them with the BBQ sauce.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Vidalia Onion sauce and cut back the brown sugar just a bit.  This is definitely restaurant quality.

This recipe is excellent!!  My picky family enjoyed these ribs and asked when I would make them again even before we left our table.  I left out the brown sugar and used the McCormick mesquite marinate in the packet.  Finger licking delicious !!

These are so awesome! I agree with the first person... use 4 bay leaves. SO good. McCormick makes a wonderful musquite marinate. We put it in our burgers too. Mmmm

I have made these 3 times now, and I'll never use another recipe again! This one is PERFECT!! I did have to cook them in the oven, rather than the pit but I followed the directions to a t...my whole family raves over them. The 2 pickiest eaters in the house tell their friends, "the only food in the whole world that's better than dad's brisket, is moms ribs". (They're 10) Lol. Thanks for the posting this!

I have used this recipe several times and get great results and applause. One thing I do different is I don't grill them. After boiling I cut them into individual ribs and smother in BBQ sauce in a slow cooker and set on warm. they are tender and delicious and are great for finger food at Holiday parties.

These are the most fabulous ribs I have ever put in my mouth. I did use St Louis style spare ribs and they were so tender and flavorful. I used 1 bottle of marinade and a packet of McCormick's mesquite. I had 2 racks of ribs about 7lbs. Followed everything else exactly.  I added a small amount of the brown sugar so I would say that can be a personal preference. Use as much BBQ sauce as you like. Yummy!!

I have made this so many times and I have experimented a lot.  I have cooked it in hard apple cider, chicken stock, beef stock, beer... I usually buy the Jack Daniels Marinade in a Bag for my "jar".  Sometimes I even add a little apple cider vinegar.  If too cold outside, I simply broil in the oven for the final step about 3 minutes each side.  Delicious!
