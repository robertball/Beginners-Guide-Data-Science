My son liked this so much I made it twice in one week.  This was the first recipe that I tried in my new dutch oven - it's one of those ceramic coated cast iron deals - and it was perfect for this recipe.  I did not alter this recipe.  Be sure to use BOTH the chipotle AND ancho chili powders.  The cinnamon is what takes this to Africa and makes it a real gem of a dish.

Chef John, you never fail! I made this exactly as the recipe calls and loved it. An old dietary preference from childhood means I had never had lamb before. Recently, I decided to make some changes for better health and lamb was "in". Now I want it everyday (but will probably put it in an every-other-day rotation with salmon. Don't change a thing about this recipe! It is perfect. Thanks Chef John!

This was pretty good. I omitted the hot peppers and added a tsp of crushed red pepper instead for a milder flavor. Also I didn't have any tomato paste so I diced a 1/2 thick slice of fresh tomato and added that to the onion sauce.

Good!  But the Lamb Shank is a bit fatty.
