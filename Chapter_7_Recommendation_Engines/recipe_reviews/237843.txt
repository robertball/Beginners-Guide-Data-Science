This is such a simple recipe, but what great flavor. Not to worry if you haven't seen that pesto packet before because I haven't.  I used my homemade pesto and simply decreased the amount of olive oil.  Also, because the packet said creamy I used light cream instead of milk. Simple adjusments that work out very well.  I used Johnsonville sweet sausage.   It came out perfect. The flavor combination is spot on.  Everyone loved it.

Super easy and very quick, as promised. I don't know if there's a difference between "creamy pesto sauce mix" and regular, but I had regular on hand and it was delicious. Served with a side of steamed broccoli. Was gobbled up by the whole family, even the picky 2yr old.

We love this. Sometimes I add red bell pepper sometimes I don't. Good weekday meal.

This is DELICIOUS!!! Don't overcook the pasta and if you don't have pesto...simply use about 1Tbsp. basil and 1tsp (or more) garlic powder. Less sausage is better because it allows the pasta flavor to shine through and don't shy away from the Parmesan. I love this recipe and am going to kick this one up a notch as soon as I get some free time in the kitchen.

For the minimal amount of prep and ingredients it is pretty tasty. I only used have of a 12 oz box of penne and used the other half with a marinara sauce and it provided enough for me for a few meals.
