I have made this delicious side dish for years and everyone loves it. I like to add something red to make it really beautiful looking. Red bell pepper or pimientos are great.

I did this recipe twice this week.  Emjoy by all..Only thing I would suggest is check your curry.   I have a medium level so I used less then what the recipe calls for.

Made no changes, except had to add more curry. Tasted kind of on the bland side, which is kind of odd since it has curry in it. Had an issue with the sour cream kind of curdling and not mixing too well in with the corn.

Excellent recipe; very tasteful. Would definitely cook again. 
The addition of celery and diced bacon would also add a lot of flavor to this dish.

This was very different. It had a tangy flavor and a little spicy with the curry powder. I used dried minced onion and red curry powder. It was okay, but I don't think I will fix this again. I would eat it again though if it were served. DH didn't comment. I noticed he did finish his serving.

This was probably one of my favorite corn recipes i've ever tried.  I did increase the amount of the spices and added garlic powder and some dill. I had no problem with any curdling, the texture was just the perfect amount of creamy.  This is definitely a keeper

Delicious way to prepare corn.  I used corn that we had froze last summer.  It worked great.  This kept well as leftovers for lunches the next day.  Thanks Lewis for sharing this recipe.

This was pretty good, but there was too much sour cream. Next time I will only use 1/4 cup.

My son loved this! Used red bell pepper and red onion and hot madras curry powder. No problems with the sour cream, perhaps the previous reviewer had the heat to high -that can cause seperation. Will be making often! Yum!!

Love the flavor. It was a lot of sauce for my taste so I doubled the corn. I also added frozen shelled edamame to increase the protein.

This recipe was slightly disappointing. It's definitely not bad, and was edible, but it really didn't have much flavor. I expected with all of the curry powder it would be a lot more flavorful, but honestly, it just tasted like regular corn without any spices. Everyone in my house ate this without complaining, but it wasn't very exciting, and I will probably only make this again if someone requested it. Thank you for sharing the recipe, lewis718!

Quick and yummy. I went lighter on the sour cream and added some garlic and red peppers. Ah. And use fresh corn. I thought of adding green peas

This was amazing. Served with naan and aloo phujia. I used pam instead of oil and I tripled the curry powder and used greek yogurt in place of sour cream.

This wasn't bad. It had a nice creamy texture but not bursting with flavor although the flavor was pleasant. I think the recipe calls for too much sour cream and not enough curry. I would bump up the green pepper a little to give it more color contrast with the yellow of the corn.
