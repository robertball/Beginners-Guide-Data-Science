I (meaning my entire family) am NOT an advocate of either Chickpeas or Eggplant (except when prepared "Parmesan" and then we only kind of like it). Which is PRECISELY why, when I came across this recipe, I simply KNEW I had to try it. I omitted the salami (too expensive in our area) but substituted 1/2 lb. SWEET Italian Sausage in its stead. I RARELY use Tomato Paste, so I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead. I liked it well enough (even thought it was "GOOD") but when -- just last night -- my Husband asked me "when are you going to make that 'Eggplant thing' again?", I just KNEW I had to come in here to rate this a 5! Who could have known?! Serve over rice.

I used the basic ingredients, added more, subtracted a few and came up with a very tasty meal.  I added roasted red pepper and zucchini, old wine, white wine vinegar, a touch of chilli powder and cut out some off the water and replaced with chicken stock. Served over pasta.

Disappointing.  Having read the other reviews, I took some extra steps to add flavor - added basil too, used broth instead of water, used fire-roasted tomatoes, cooked in slow cooker...  (omitted salami though, as we are veg.)  Wasn't horrible, but still quite bland.

I thoroughly enjoyed this stew---much like a chili but much quicker to make.  Very nice flavor and texture and just the right amount of spices.  Would recommend with a nice piece of crispy French bread.

Great use of leftover eggplant!  Not spectacular but a nice tasting stew that got better after a few days.  I used a cup of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes and added chicken boullion, omitting any additional salt.  Also omitted salami just because I didn't have it!  Probably would have been delicious with it.

I love this recipe, but with a few modifications.  I add zucchini and curry powder.  I use chicken broth instead of water and only use 4 cups.  I serve over couscous.  I normally make a big batch and enjoy the leftovers for several days.

Pretty good, but wish the broth had more flavor.  As it was I used 1 can chicken broth for some of the water, but should've used more.  Adding a few red pepper flakes when serving gave it a little extra kick.  Family loved it though, so I may have been picky that night.

I modified this recipe to omit the meat and the tomato paste.  It was good, but not something I'm likely to make again.

right off the bat, I thought it was suspect no flavored bouillon/broth was required, as this is a must for most soups. I did omit the salami to make this vegetarian. at first bite thought it was bland but then after a couple bites i liked the flavor, the chickpeas really add something to this. tastes even better the second day.

This is my  first time making it and it is a keeper.  I did make it without oil or salami as I am on a plant-based diet.  It works very well.  I did not feel it was necessary to smash the eggplant as I like to maintain the integrity of the vegetable.  I did not serve it over pasta, but, it looks good and I probably will the next time I make it.

Good recipe. I made it without any meat as I didn't have any available. I served it over pasta and it turned out to be a good basic dish. I'm pretty sure with some well seasoned sausage it would be great. I also didn't have any cilantro.

Great! I used this recipe with what I had in the kitchen already, so it was modified a bunch, for example, I had ham on hand, so I used that instead if going out and getting salami, and used butter beans instead of chickpeas. Next time, I'll follow to a tee;  this time, I just followed the general idea. Very tasty, very filling!
