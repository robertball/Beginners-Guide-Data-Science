Actually hubby made these instead of me. I thought that they were just a bit bland. Probably because I am used to using a packet of Dry Onion Soup Mix when I fix potatoes this way.

These were a bit salty.  Still tasted great, but if you don't like salty things I'd use a bit less garlic salt in the mixture.  Also, these were done after about 20 minutes... maybe I just cut mine thinner than recommended, but if I had left them in the entire time they would have burned.

Potatoes were finished in 25 minites. Very Nice. We used an allpurpose Greek seasoning instead of the garlic salt.
