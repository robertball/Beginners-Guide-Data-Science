Yes this is one of my favorite things to make! Everyone loves it. Only suggestion, add some scrambled eggs to the filling part of the Baleada. Perfection! Had it that way at a Honduran food truck and wont go back.

Maybe I'm just an idiot, but I put the ingredients and the correct measurements in for the dough and it turned into a liquid. I had to add two extra cups of flour before it even came close to being solid enough to work with. Not really impressed with this recipe

I’ve been trying to make these for so long and I couldn’t. They either stick or were too hard but this recipe is the one and it tastes delicious.

This was unexpectedly quick and delicious. I happened to have leftover brisket and I chopped it finely and added to the mix. This made for a quick and filling late breakfast ?? early lunch ??. I used hot sauce and husband topped with salsa verse. He loved it and I think kids would enjoy it too.

It came out great, and I agree with other posters with it needing at least 2 more cups of flour for the tortillas to take form.

Agreed with previous poster. Needs more flour for the tortillas to take form.
Also, to clarify the description -it can certainly be made with corn tortillas

It was great! But you need like 1 1/2 cups more of flour for the dough to have the right texture
