Love this.!  I switched it up a bit (and thanks to all of the people who gave me all of the great ideas!).  I added the following (because I had it on hand): 1/2 (of each) red, yellow and orange bell pepper, chopped, fresh spinach (handful), fresh basil (2 Tablespoons), fresh Italian parsley (2-3 tablespoons), 3/4 cup of cherry tomatoes quartered, sauteed 1/2 red onion and two big garlic cloves in a little olive oil, used light sour cream instead of the oil (1/2-3/4 cup), sprinkled it with some olive oil, used Heart Smart Bisquick, egg beaters, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, baked it for 45-50 minutes in 350-degrees using a glass pyrex dish (10X13, I think).  It looks beautiful and tastes really great! What a wonderful way to get a bunch of healthy veggies in your diet.

I made this recipe for a brunch I hosted on Sunday. I made mini pies using my mini muffin pan the night before the party. The bite size were perfect. My guests loved them and I didnt have any left over. I would definitely make this recipe again. PS. I reheated the minis the day of the party in the oven and they were perfect.

My neighbor gave me some zucchini. My husband says he doesn't like it so I peeled the zucchini with a potato peeler and grated the zucchini instead of dicing it.  He loved the pie.  My mother-in-law and my neighbors both like it, too!  Thanks for a great recipe. I will prepare again & again.

Great recipe !! To make it lower in fat I used non-fat sour cream instead of the 1/2 cup oil, and then just added about 1 to 2  tablespoons of oil. Was a wonderful new way to eat zucchini !!

I have a similar recipe, however, mine calls for grating the zucchini.  The best part is, I grate the zucchini, onion and the cheese in the cusinart, then, mix in the rest of the ingredients.  What could be easier?  This is definitely a great way to use that abundance of zucchini.  My recipe calls for using cheddar cheese instead of parmesan.  Wonderful!

My husband & I loved this! The kids on the other hand were not thrilled, but will learn to like it because I plan on making it all summer! As menioned in other reviews, I shredded the zuchinni, carrot and onion. I used cherry tomatoes which I cut in half, and it made the pie very colorful. I also sprinkled cheddar cheese on top which enhanced the overall appearance. I used Italian seasoning in place of the marjoram which worked well. Next time I will use less oil. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was very good. Instead of 3 cups zucchini, I used a mixture of vegetables to total 3 cups, i.e. green pepper, carrots, & tomatoes.  I also added a little garlic and some spicy seasoning to give it a little more flavor.

I remember a similar zucchini pie that my mom made growing up.  I made this version and it was just too oily and it was just missing something..  SO here's what I do to make it much better - I add over a cup each of sharp cheddar cheese and parmesan.  And instead of all of that oil I just add 2 tablespoons of olive oil...better flavor. Lastly, fresh parsley.  Enjoy!  It really is a good recipe if you do it right.

Took reviewers advice and added one grated carrot and tomato.  Also reduced the amount of bisquick and oil used.  Turned out great! Sort of like a quiche but so much yummier.  My guests loved it and I loved the fool proof recipe.  Thanks!

Interesting and tasty! I used 3 cups total of grated zucchini and carrot, one minced garlic clove, 1/2 cup italian breadcrumbs, and a mexican cheese blend instead of parmesan.  I then topped it with grated parmesan. I also added italian seasoning, some red pepper flakes and cumin. Oh, and I didn't use nearly as much oil as per other reviews. It did not cut up as a pie, per say, but since I didn't use the baking mix or as much, no wonder.  It was a tasty veggie meal nonetheless. Something I will do again!

I made this recipe for a potluck dinner for 8 people.  I increased the zucchini to 6 cups, the Parmesan cheese to 1 cup and the marjoram to 1 teaspoon (I also added salt)and baked it in a 9" x 13" pan.  It was delicious.  I will make this often.

Oh, my goodness!   This was awesome!  My husband loved it!  I added a small amount of carrot and some red pepper.  I didn't have parm so I used the Sargento Mozzarella/Asiago with Roasted Garlic Cheese - wonderful.  I also grated all my veggies except the red pepper and onion.  Added a few spices from my cabinet also since I didn't have marjoram.  It bakes up beautifully in a Pampered Chef baking dish!! I will definitely be making this again for company.

I used up 4 cups of veggies including asperigus, red pepper, onion, snowpeas parsley,garlic.  Fresh stuff. Going away on vacation so had to use them up. Then I used 3/4c aunt jemima pancake mix as I didnt have the baking mix requested. I added 1/4 cup cajun fish batter (dry) to spice it up.  Added 1/2 cup swiss cheese and dollap of that so good french onion sour cream in the red container.  Just a tbsp of olive oil.  Made 15 cupcakes (regular cupcake pans).  Baked 30 mins. Turned out perfect.  Note that I did use my mini procecessor to cut the veggies small bits so that when I feed to kids, they may not be able to tell whats in it!  Delicious and perfect for on the go breakfast.  Veggie/egg muffins.

Use your imagination.  Pay attention to the 3 cups of zucchini.  That could become 1 cup ham, 1 cup mushroom and 1/2 cup squash 1/2 cup zucchini. Or 2 cups zucchini, 1/2 ham, 1/2 cup mushrooms.  I have even used bacon.    This recipe it good hot, it is good cold.  I have used as a breakfast dish and as a dinner side dish.

I could tell from the simplicity of the recipe and from reading the other reviews that this was not going to have enough flavor for my liking.  Here's what I did and it turned out really good:  I diced two med zucchinis and half an onion.  I sauteed them in a little olive oil with garlic, salt, pepper, and lemon pepper for a few mins.  Then to the batter I added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of oregano.  Then once in the baking pan, I sprinkled additional Parmesan cheese on top and seasoned bread crumbs.  Will serve with sprinkled, melted cheddar over the top.  Tomatoes would have added nice color, but I didn't have any this time, will try adding that next time.  I just used Jiffy baking mix as that's all I had.

Very interesting!  Worth a shot.  I will make again.  Not way exciting, but different.  Mellow.  Tasted great the next day.  With all the oil I thought it would be heavy, but was very, very light and flavorful. Sounded like it would use lots and lots of zucchini, but only used two medium sized.  More I write about it, the more I want to have again!

This is a favorite in our house, especially in the summer with all the fresh zucchini. It's delicious with cubed ham to make it more of a main dish. We also enjoy it with fresh sliced tomato. If you don't have parmesan on hand cheddar or mozzerla both work great too. Great go to recipe!

I mainly made this because I had ALOT of zucchini that I needed to use up. Boy was I impressed though! I diced up my zucchini. Some readers suggested to saute it first. I didn't and I think I'm glad I didn't. I liked the fact that the zucchini still had some crunch to it. I also added tomatoes and real bacon pieces. The possibilities are endless to what you can add. I did add 1/2 tsp salt and used Romano instead of Parmesan because I didn't have any parmesan. I couldn't believe it when my husband told me my 4 children ate it WITHOUT complaining! This is a keeper for sure! Loved it!

I added fresh garlic and green peppers and used pancake mix instead of bisquick. I also made this up the night before and just put it from fridge to the oven this morning, and it baked up in about 35 minutes. It was a hit for my sunday school class brunch. Only one slice left, and I was even asked for the recipe. I will make this one again. :)

simple and yummy!  made this for a light lunch, it was lovely, my guests ate it all, some had seconds.  It sliced very well after standing for about an hour.  Next time I will add a bit more seasoning, but overall, very good made exactly as stated in the recipe.

Very light and fluffy--would also be good for breakfast.  Baked in 11x7 glass dish for 35 min.  Marjoram was good, but might experiment with spices next time.  I shredded zucchini and vidalia onion and patted dry in paper towel before mixing in.  Husband asked me to make it again.  Easy and fast.

Yum, yum, yum!!! I took the advice of others and subbed 1/2 cup low fat sour cream and just 1-2 Tbsp oil to make it lighter. Used 1 tsp. Italian seasoning instead of the marjoram and parsley. Added some crushed red pepper.  I also topped with a little shredded cheddar cheese which I thought enhanced the presentation and flavor both. Baked in a 7x11 inch pan.  Would be great served for brunch, but I made it for a summer dinner and it was satisfying enough for that too. Was great reheated also.

Overall flavor was very good. Here are the changes I made: 1 large grated zucchini; 1 grated carrot; 1 chopped onion, 1 chopped green onion; 1 tsp dried chives; 3 eggs, 1/3 cup oil and 1 cup Bisquick. I didn't have marjoram so I used some Italian seasoning and dried parsley. I also added 1 tsp minced garlic. Grated fresh Parmesan into the batter and then sprinkled some sharp cheddar on top. I'm glad I added some salt (about 1/2 tsp) otherwise it would have been bland. This took about 40 min to bake in our oven. We enjoyed this with the Parmesan Basil Orzo.

Upped the recipe by using a total of 10 eggs, 1 cup cottage cheese (instead of oil), eyeballed 1 cup parmesan, 4 cups shredded zucchini, 1 whole onion diced small, a heaping cup of Bisquick.  Texture was great, even kids ate it.  Needs lots of pepper and a sprinkle of fresh parmesan on top.  With these additions, it made one smaller pie and one deep pie.  Baked at 380 for about 45mins.

A friend gave me some zucchini from her garden, so I tried this recipe out.  It was pretty good, though I did make a few changes.  I grated the zucchini instead of dicing, used a combo of yellow and green onion, used cheddar and parmesan (only had a little of both on hand), cut the oil in half, and added some diced asparagus.  It was good the night I made it, and even better the next day!!  I'm going to make it for a cocktail party this weekend, and just cut it into little squares.  Yummy!!

Very good, I didn't have 3c of zucchini so I used grated summer squash and finely chopped broccoli instead.  I omitted the cheese to keep the calorie count down and it still was wonderful!

I made this as written and found it rather heavy for having all the fresh veggies. Made, again, without that 1/2 freaking cup OIL. Happy to say it turned out light, fresh, and flavorful.

Really liked it! As other reviewers, I grated the zucchini. Also used sour cream rather than oil, added garlic powder, Italian seasonings, and some red pepper flakes. Thank you for the recipe.

This was pretty good, but I think some additional seasonings/spices are needed to make this a five star.  If I make this again, I think I will saute the onions with some garlic just to soften them (DH complains about crunch onions).  I used about 2 c. zucchini and 1 c. yellow squash, but I'd like to try this with some red or orange bell pepper, which would give it additional flavor and more color.  Thanks.

I had copied this recipe last year and filed it into my recipe folder on my computer and didn't get to making it until tonight.  I wish I had made it sooner.  There were six (vegetarians) of us plus a 2-year-old, and one little piece of a piece left, with everyone eyeing that last little morsel, licking their lips.  My 16 year old son finally grabbed for it.  My wife said the only thing wrong with the zucchihi pie is that I didn't make two of them.  I wish I had read the reviews first, shredded zucchihi sounds good too, and adding a carrot can only be a plus.

This recipe is so easy and turns out quite tasty. I took the advice of others and shredded the zucchini, added some tomoatoes from the garden and it was great! I also used cheddar cheese since I didn't have parm. and it worked well. My only advice would be to cut down on the oil next time, it was a little too greasy for me! Overall, an easy, tasty, veggie dinner!

Easy and delicious! A good way to use up extra zucchini. I read the reviews and made the following substitutions. I used 5tbs of oil instead of 1/2 cup. I used regular bisquick, and Italian seasoning instead of marjoram. I used 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup feta, and I left out the parsley because I didn't have any. Baked for 55 minutes at 300 F. The pie was delicious! I took it to a pot luck and it was gobbled up. This would be good as muffins as well.

Good enough but not awesome.  Used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup sour cream.  Also added sliced cherry tomatoes on top as a nice touch.

This was awesome!  I sauteed the onions in olive oil with some garlic and added the diced zucchini briefly.  I transferred that to a bowl where I added halved cherry tomatoes, the oil, the Parmesan, eggs and a fluffy complete pancake mix.  It baked beautifully, then I grated some sharp cheddar on top while it was still hot and served it with a salad.  Everyone loved it, great recipe :)

Wonderful!  I used 2 medium sized zucchinis grated and about 4 baby carrots grated along with 5 cherry tomatoes cut up.  I used 1 cup of Heart Healthy Bisquick and used 1/2 a cup of sour cream and a splash of olive oil after reading the other reviews.  My picky 3 y/o loved it and there were no leftovers.  A nice light meal that sneaked in veggies to the picky eaters.  Next time I will cut my onion smaller.  Update:  Made again since my picky 3 y/o ate it well.  DH said it was bland and he didn't really care for it.  This time I used the food processor to shred the zucchini and 2 small carrots as well as the onion.  I like the idea of this but will need to try other recipes or perhaps tweak this one with seasonings.  With the onion shredded I didn't find it too overpowering.  I used a small sweet onion.  My 3 y/o gobbled it down so it's still a 5 star recipe in my book.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, with the following small adjustments... First I used Bisquik heart smart mix as recommended by a previous reviewer, and it worked perfectly.  I can see that cutting this amount in half as suggested by some could be really good too, though, and give the dish less of a bread-like texture and more of a quiche-like texture.  Secondly, I added fresh chopped green chile for a little spice, and this was wonderful.  Last, I chopped about 2 tablespoons of fresh basil and sprinkled it on top with an extra 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesean and it gave the crust a nice cheesy crust on top.  (I added these with about 5 min of baking time left).  This was a great dish and I will definitely make it again.  Also, I'm glad that I chopped the zucchini because it still had a nice texture after baking 30 minutes, not mushy at all.

I like the way this tasted.  I used shredded yellow and green zucchini and peppers (red, yellow & orange).  I also added a couple of sprinkles of a cheese blend (Fontina & Asiago) in addition to the 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese.  Next time I'll add more cheese and maybe spinach.  Like other reviewers suggested, I used less oil (olive).  This took longer than 30 minutes to get done, closer to an hour or a little longer.

WONDERFUL base recipe - and works well gluten free, as well (Bisquick makes a GF mix now)!  I've tried it as is, and have added ham, bacon, basil, and cheddar  It will definitely become a standard at our house.

Super Yum! I also used the sour cream instead of oil.  I put extra parm and put fresh basil and parsley from my garden, what a great recipe! Even my super picky 7 year old devoured it.

My family loved this! I should have doubled it for my family of 7. Used cheddar instead of Parm. used half the oil, added 1/4 c. green peppers, 1/2 c. onion, 1/4 c. shredded carrots (cause I had them on hand), needed to bake a little longer, more like 40 minutes. Overall, a great easy recipe.

Good recipe, I agree with some of the reviewers after having tried the recipe exactly, I would at least peel, if not peel and shred the zucchini.  The skin doesn't soften in the 30 minute cook time, at least mine didn't so there were hard bits in it.  Otherwise quite tasty!

Super!  I added a 1/2 tsp. each of salt, garlic powder, and paprika, and a 1/8 tsp. red pepper.  Also, a T. of italian seasoning and parsley.  I definitely will make this again!

Like others, I'm trying new recipes to use the garden zucchini. This is one of my favorites. I added chopped green pepper, extra shredded zucchini and some fresh basil. Baked it in a 9x9 square pan a little longer than the recipe stated, probably due to my added ingredients. Excellent and easily adaptable! Thanks!

I personally felt it was a little bland and I added 1/2 tarragon,1/2 tsp of parsley because it called for it but didn't indicate how much to use also added a pinch of garlic salt and after baking for 30 minutes topped it with 1 cup of shredded parmesan cheese and bake for another 5-6 minutes.  My husband loved this but next I think I try and expirement w/adding some crumbled bacon.

EXCELLENT!  A few minor tweaks, I used half of the suggested amount of oil, I used 2 zucchini and I diced one and shredded the other to give it a nice texture so you would bite into bits of zucchini, added a handful of shredded mozzarella, some bacon bits, basil (did not have marjoram), a grated clove of garlic and a shallot instead of a yellow onion which gave it a mild onion flavor.  A real crowd pleaser! I will definitely add this one to the collection.

I give it a 5 for ease and appearance. HOWEVER it was so bland. Very dull flavor.

I'm making it again with these changes to see if I can boost it up. 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes, or 1/2 cup quartered cherry tomatoes. 1/4 cup diced fresh mozz OR feta cheese. 1 T fresh basil. That should boost it up in taste.

This turned out well.  I added fresh basil and oregano, as well as garlic, and I threw in about half a cup of diced tomatoes, too. I used an 8x8" glass dish, which was fine -- it just took about 45 minutes to bake.

YUMMY!! Hubby and I loved it so much there was none left! Only a few issues/changes..It took almost 3 times the cook time so next time I will do it at 375. I halved the oil, added some squash, shredded the veggies and added some basil, and used half the parm and other half shredded cheddar. WILL MAKE AGAIN!! Good recipe to play with..thanks!

This was delicious! I shredded the zucchini and added chopped tomatoes from the garden. I didn't have marjoram but I added a little onion salt & a few other spices from the shelf. I also added a little shredded cheese. For the biscuit mix I used low-fat Bisquick. Excellent- thanks!

Ladies & Gentlemen, We have a WINNER!  My 13-yo son detests zucchini.  Ha ha!!  He started to eat this pie and after the second bite, stopped dead and said, "Is there zucchini in this?"  Well, he was shocked and said, "I can't believe I'm saying this, especially since there's zucchini in it, but it's good!  And if I take seconds (which he was) it's REALLY good!  Okay Mom, it's a keeper."  Now that is something!!  Thanks Kim, we LOVE this recipe and I finally found a way to get my men to eat zucchini - which I love! :)

How can two people be so different? I LOVED this side dish; my husband thought it was just ok. But I'm the allrecipes cook, so 5 stars it is! I grated the zucchini instead of leaving it in chunks. It and the onion cooked perfectly in the allotted time.

I kept this one tried and true. We really liked this I didn't change a thing down to veggie size, spices, cheese, wet ingredients, nor cooking time or method. I even got my picky picky 8yo to give it a try! Its not oily, its not bland, and the veggies get cooked properly IF YOU FOLLOW THE RECIPE. I agree you could add anything to this recipe but its fabulous as written!!

Easy & quick but a bit too bland for me, especially the zucchini pieces in it tasted bland. Will add spices and saute the zucchini before baking next time.  Family liked it but added quite a bit hot sauce. Will add some cheddar to the mix next time instead of the Parmesan. Thanks for sharing :)

This is very similar to a recipe someone gave me a few years ago. I needed to use some buttermilk pancake mix (you know the kind u just add water) up and stretched it to make one cup with Bisquick. I shredded my zucchini added only 1/4 veg oil and a combo of sour cream and sour cream onion dip (in the container) for the other 1/4 cup. I used parmasan cheese and chedder in the batter and the last 5 mins or so sprinkled some more shredded chedder cheese on top and let that bake in.... mmm very good and this recipe is very versatile... I am sure you can use yellow squash(which I will try next time) brocolli or any combo of veggies that you want.  This is a real keeper. I had a piece for lunch with a cucumber salad... and also another piece with my homemade stuffed pepper dinner,mashed potatoes, and green pepper cucumber, and tomatoe salad.... went so well with dinner and hubby enjoyed it too.... thanx for sharing this recipe.

I tried following the recipe exactly, but did not have marjoram, so used italian seasoning and added a few cherry tomatoes quartered from the garden.  My husband loved it, said it tasted so "fresh".  I didn't care for the onions being on the raw side.  But it had good flavor, next time I think I will sautee the onions a little before adding to pie.  Diced zucchini which kept it semi firm after cooking it.  We liked that the zucchini didn't turn to mush.  Surprisingly the 1/2c veg oil did not make it oily or greasy.  Will make again, thanks!!!!

Delicious but mine came out swimming in oil, had to pour it off! Not sure what happened, maybe because I used homemade biscuit mix with shortening pre-mixed in. The taste is very quiche-like and I thought next time I'd add crumbled feta and bacon.

My whole family (5 and 7 year olds included) enjoyed this recipe! We used yellow crookneck squash instead of zucchini the last time we made this and you couldn't tell the difference.   It's a great meal for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

I sauteed the onions and garlic before adding it to the egg mixture and shredded the zucchini instead of diced it.  We LOVED this recipe.  It was a great way to use up all of our garden-fresh zucchini.  Will definitely make again.

Fabulous and mistake-proof. I used more than 3 cups of zucchini , over 1 cup of mixed Parmesan and Cheddar,[i repsect veggies and cheese] tossed in a tblspoon more or less of baking mix to make up the difference and the pie came out delicious. I made it for an office pre-thanksgiving feast and everyone went for seconds on this one.

I'm not a huge fan of either eggs or zucchini, but I had a bunch of both to use up. I love, love, love this!!! I used gruyere instead of parmesan because I had a bunch already grated. It was perfect. I chose not to add any seasoning, wanting the cheese's flavor to come out. Super easy and loved by everyone who tasted it!

The recipe was a good starting off point... I went with some of the additions that other suggested: a few cloves of garlic, lots of fresh veggies, like carrots and red peppers. I also used fresh basil from the garden and with these additions it turned out fabulous. Will definitely be making this again with variations on the veggies, whatever I have on hand.

Learned to cook from my grandmother who owned an Italian Restaurant - we use locatelli romano or pecorino romano rather than parmesan - tastes much better.

This was good with some needed changes. 

I cooked the zucchini and onions until slightly tender and then added them to the mix. I did not use parmesan but rather appr. 3/4 C of mozzarella. 

I omitted the vegetable oil as that just seemed weird to me and substituted the same amount of milk instead. I liked this and will probably make it again with the above modifications.

Absolutely fabulous and couldn't be easier! I have made this for a few parties and it's always a big hit. People fight to take leftovers home. I am not a cook and can only make easy things — this is a cinch and is SO tasty. I have passed along this recipe to so many people.

Our family likes this recipe, but it is important that alterations are made.  We use sour cream instead of oil, grate the zucchini, add cheddar cheese and bacon.  We will add tomatoes this time and some carrots for some color and change.  It is pretty basic and bland, so you need to add and flavor it to your liking first.  I bake it in a glass corning ware pie pan, it takes up to 1 hour.

I didn't like this at all, and I'm not a very picky person... I used olive oil and maybe the flavor of that was too much; I don't know. But it was a great texture, just not a very good flavor. I think adding some cheddar cheese would have helped a lot.

We've had this recipe at family gatherings for the past 20 or more years - mom got it from Bisquick box :-)  Super easy to make and tastes great.  Good when you have to bring a dish to a potluck.  Use fresh grated parmesan - makes a huge difference.

This was really tasty. I cut the oil in half, and added a cup or so of cheddar cheese. Also, I think I will saute the onions first, to add more flavor. (Some of the onion bits were still a little firm after baking.)

Really good...I shredded the zucchini and some carrots. Didn't have marjoram so used a little oregano.  Mine took longer to cook than is indicated by the recipe...a LOT longer.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I used cheddar cheese because I didn not have any parmesan and I also left out the marjoram.  I did add some salt and garlic.  Thanks and I will definately make again.

This was quick and easy. My biggest dilemma was whether to peel the zucchini or not because the recipe didn’t advise.  I went with not peeling and it worked out great. My family enjoyed this recipe and I’ll make it again.

What a fantastic recipe! Sooo good. My family is trying to incorporate  more meatless meals on a weekly basis and it is very hit or miss even with recipes that have great reviews. This is a hit! After reading the reviews I made a few changes for the tastes of my family. First I shredded the zucchini, second I sauteed the onions with garlic in butter before adding, I used shredded sharp cheddar and Parmesan, I also reduced the oil and added some sour cream, and last I added a pinch of  cayenne pepper (best way to liven up any quiche!).

I loved it, however it had parsley and oregano that my some is not used to so he did not.  I also added carrots and substituted oil with sour cream (1/2 C). I will make it again. Very easy, quick dinner idea.

I like to read the reviews prior to making most recipes.  However, I find it rude for people to write reviews and ' tweek, modity, and bump it up' by adjustments to the submitters recipe.  Please be considerate and like or dislike it.  You are free to submit your own recipe therby not reinventing the wheel.

I thought the recipe  turned out pretty good,

This was delicious.  I may add some vegetables as suggested by other reviews.  I think a little pineapple would be a nice compliment to the zucchini as well.  I am a vegetarian, so I enjoy trying new main dishes that my non-vegetarian husband will eat.

I'm always looking for good ways to use up a lot of garden zucchini.  This did the trick.  I adjusted the recipe to 12, made two 9" pie plates, and that took up 2 big zucchini.  I left one pie "plain," but added tomato and pepper to the other.  Instead of all the parm cheese, I did half parm cheese, half shredded cheddar. It was awesome!!!!  It seems like a very adaptable recipe (add as many or as few garden veggies as you have on hand.) Thanks for a great recipe!

I like this zucchini pie. I sauté the zucchini and onion before I mix it in because 30 min. is not long enough to cook the vegetables done. I don't use baking mix. I make a biscuit recipe instead. I used only 1/3 c. oil, and it worked well. I serve it with a salad because just eating zucchini pie by itself gets "old" quickly. The salad provides a nice counterpoint.

I have made this at least a dozen times in the last 3 months.  It is amazing!  I do add meat to this...have done bacon, diced ham, sausage.  My husband even made it once with hot dogs. I also use pancake mix instead of bisquick.  I usually double the recipe, cooking it in two 9 x 9 pans and add jalapenos to one pan for the heat lovers.  We absolutely love this and it is definitely a keeper!  Even put my over abundance of zucchini from the garden in the freezer in 3-cup increments so it is ready to go for this recipe this winter.  We have topped this with a variety of toppings, depending on the mood including salsa, corn salsa, tabasco, ketchup (not all at once, mind you).  YUMMY!

Made a few changes and found it delicious. Did very little measuring, just chopped a large zucchini and onion, added lots of fresh tomato and plenty of asiago cheese. I also added Italian seasoning and garlic salt. Used greek yogurt in place of the oil, then added a small amount of oil. Wasn't sure I liked it until it cooled a bit, now I can't wait to try it on my vegetable loving friend. my daughter didn't care for it until I added pizza sauce to hers, but I loved it without. The Italian seasoning, garlic, tomatoes and extra cheese did make it taste a bit like a pizza, only more healthy. Thanks,

This is superb. I think it's even better with other cheeses in addition or substituted in part for the parmesan. I have used mozzarella cheddar and Romano. So easy! I have also tried mixed Italian spices and pizza spice--also delicious.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious.  I use buttermilk pancake mix to give it a little sweetness.

This "pie" is exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted something I could toss together quickly, use zucchini with a great taste that looked good. 

I added tomatoes cut in thin wedges on the top in concentric cirles to add color and design- it was beautiful.  

In addition to the tomatoes I added 1/2 tsp italian spices, 2 cloves finely chopped garlic and some fresh cracked pepper to the top. (based on other reviewers recommendations)

My husband and I loved this and will make it again.  It is a dish you could serve as a simple supper with a side salad and be satisfied. Perfect for summer.

I made this EXACTLY as stated, except that I shredded 2 cups of the zucchini (diced the other 1 cup) and used cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. It turned out really, really good. I will make this again.

Nice change of pace for the extra zucchini.  Cakey, pie-like and yummy.  =)  How's that for a description???  I made no changes other than baking this in a bit smaller pan than a 12" pie plate (I think mine measured at 10") and it was just fine.

I love this pie... my mom always made a very similar zucchini pie when I was younger.  I used Hodgson Mill's whole wheat buttermilk baking mix (which made me happy!), and it still tastes great.  I'd suggest adding salt to taste, also.

Very much like a recipe my neighbor shared with me. (IN their family it's known as Zucchinni Slop Perhaps not to scare the teens.)   In her version, and now mine , there are a couple tablespoons of seseme seeds on top..plus  a couple dashes of hot sauce. the heat, with the olive oil, the toasting of the seeds.  Very good combo.  And of course, though the idea must be to get rid of too much Zucchinni; I have  made it with broccoli, and all sorts of other veggies.., but none is better than the zucchinni version.

Wow, this is delicious.  I love it, thank you for sharing.  I only altered the recipe because I bought jumbo eggs and they are huge so I used 3 instead of 4.  I also used romano cheese because I had no parm.  It has a great flavor, wouldn't change anything.  It's light and fluffy, cooked to perfection in 30 min.  Will be making this often.  Am on a low carb diet and diabetic so this one will work for a side dish with anything!!!  We are having it tonight with pork chops, no need for potato or bread.

I love this quiche - but I shred the zucchini, versus dicing it, and I add a heaping 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar to it, too. I reluctantly used Egg Beaters as requested by Mom, but it didn't seem to matter - it was still good! :)

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  Next time I will grate the zucchini and add carrot. This is a wonderful base recipe - easy to adapt.  Added some fresh parsley and basil.  Loved the texture.

Great recipe.  I look for recipes that use up alot of zucchini, (not like 1/2 cup). 3 cups plus fits the bill here.  Lots and lots of black pepper and less oil.  Tried one yesterday it was great.  Another one in the oven this morning and am planning on sharing with the neighbors. Definitely "worthwhile."  Thank you

I love this! My sister and I have added some "mexican cheese" about 1 cup and tomatoes. Also, I use basil instead of marjoram... because I didn't have any. I also add some garlic and Susie Q. Very yummy!

This is yummy! I had a lot of zucchini from my mom's garden. I altered it a bit following some other reviewers suggestions.  I grated the zucchini and onion.  I added garlic too and used lite sour cream instead of oil. I also added crumbled bacon and a little cheddar cheese.  I was really good, I served it with a side salad with a basalmic vinairgrette dressing.... perfect summer dinner!

This is great! I changed many things, such as adding yellow bell pepper, feta cheese, mushrooms, bacon pieces and using 1/2 fat free sour cream in place of half of the oil. Overall, it turned out great and it is a very flexible recipe!

Yummy! I shredded my zucchini and added shredded italian cheese blend to the mix. Then sprinkled parmesan on top before baking. This came out light, fluffy and delicious! Leftovers were good too ;-)

I read all the reviews before trying this recipe.  It was very easy to fix, I even made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I also added yellow squash and some garlic salt and it was the hit of our Thanksgiving Dinner.  I'm definitely making it again.

Not too good, sorry.  It has a lack of flavor and I even added salt, pepper, oregano, basil and parsley to it!  Looks pretty sloppy too.  And, I am not sure if it was because I used a stoneware baking pan but I cooked this baby for 50 minutes and STILL it was mushy!  It is missing something...  maybe cheese or olices on the top?....

Not only was this quick and easy, it was yummmmy! I ended up eating 3 helpings. Next time I make it, I'm going  to add some garlic. Might try it with some cheddar cheese too. I'm curious to see how well these freeze and reserve later.

Great recipe!  I used bisquick (I assume similar to buttermilk baking mix?) and it adds a great consistency.  Threw in some spinach and italian seasoning...really enjoyed the recipe.  Thanks!

This is great - my whole family (12 of us) loved this (good thing I doubled it - everyone had seconds). I added a couple of shredded carrots.

Very Good, almost like the consistency of a quiche. No one could tell it was zucchini.

This was great.  My 2 year old son who hates squash ate some of it - and that is a lot!  I actually made two pies by doubling the recipe and used both shredded zucchini and carrots - a very colorful arrangement!  I also used gruyere and cheddar (2:1) and it was very tasty!

Super easy and good. I think this would be much better with grated zucchini because the chopped pieces just didn't cook evenly or long enough for my taste. Very easy, good, and filling side dish; I imagine a great main dish for vegetarians. Reminded me of dressing to have with chicken or turkey. Thank you.

I've been making this recipe for years and love it. I only use 1/3 cup of oil.  I combine the ingredients for several at a time, bake one, and freeze the rest (raw) in ziplock bags.  To cook a frozen one,  thaw it in the fridge, squeeze the ziplock bag until all the ingredients are once again mixed, pour in pie pan,  and bake.

Easy to make, looked awesome, was light to eat.  The only thing I would do different next time is fry a little bacon or Italian sausage and add to the mix to make a little more flavour

Substituted 1/2 cup light sour cream and 2 tbsp olive oil for oil and added 1 cup grated parmesan and 1 cup cheddar, per suggestions from other reviewers. My daughter and husband really liked it. Next time they want ham added to it, though. Also, I had to cook it for 45 minutes to get it to set right.

I really liked this recipe, but it needs more salt (either apply ketchup if you are a ketchup on your eggs person, or sprinkle with salt or seasoned salt).   We used a Penzey's seasoning blend (Rocky Mountain Seasoning) that we love on our eggs.  Next time I'll put it in the dish instead of on it.

Yummmmy! I did follow most of the recipe but took tips from some other reviewers as well. I added some leftover diced bell pepper, some leftover chopped green onion, and diced a tomato. I used a 1/2c sour cream instead of the oil, and I made homemade baking mix (recipe on Allrecipes) since I was out of Bisquick. It was perfect and delicious and I can’t wait to make it again very soon. (I think it would also be delicious if you were to crumble cooked bacon or sausage into it as well before baking.) it did take a bit longer to bake and seemed to bake better on 375, probably because I cooked it in a 9x9 and so it was much deeper.

Very good way to use abundance of summer zucchini!  I grated the zucchini and  used fresh eggs from our hens, onions and parsley from my garden. So delicious and fresh. Next time, I will reduce oil because grated zucchini gives it lots of moisture.

This was my 13th day of making zucchini recipes. It was great. I did replace the oil with sour cream and 2T of vegetable oil, added a carrot and some garlic, and used half marjoram and half Italian seasoning. I too shredded the zucchini. Next recipe to tackle are the zucchini pickles.

My second time I doubled the recipe and added fresh basil and made a dozen Texas muffins, bake for 45 minutes, and a dozen regular sized muffins. They freeze beautifully.

I liked this recipe because it was different from my norm.  Added bacon crumbles, mushrooms, and garlic powder.  For those who don't have biscuit mix on hand you can use 1 cup flour, 1 and 1/2 teas. powder, a dash of salt.  I didn't have powdered buttermilk so I just omitted it and it came out fine.  Note also that the mixture seemed a bit dry but cooked fine.  For those who don't like the zucchini unless completely cooked, you may want to pre-cook a little in oil.  Our family likes varied textures.

Family favorite. We called it zucchini appetizer. I switched up the ingredients a bit. Added Tumeric for color and health. Left out Marjoram and used Basil instead. My quilting ladies loved the potluck dish and requested the recipe!

Really yummy but I modified it as i am using a parabolic mirror for solar cooking.  i added grated potatoes on the bottom of the cast iron pot and I added 3 tbsp of pain organic yogurt as well as splitting the cheese between sharp cheddar and pepper jack.  Delish!

Seriously so good. I was glad that I looked at the other reviews before trying it out. For the vegetables I ended up going with zucchini, yellow squash, and mushrooms (1 cup of each).  I used a potato peeler to cut up the zucchini and squash, I think they came out well like that. Used both Parmesan and Cheddar cheese. In place of just the marjoram I went with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, pepper and only 2 tbsp of olive oil (as per another reviewer's suggestion). Definitely one of my favorite new recipes!

Well the pie is still being eaten as I write this >).  I basically stuck to the recipe.  Small changes - used half sour cream/half olive oil, added 1carrot, 1/4 c broccoli no stems. Once in pie dish, sprinkled small amount more Parma cheese and mozzarella and finished off with a dusting of Paprika for color. It looked beautiful and inviting and tasted flavorful and healthy.  Since there were only 2 people eating this I halved the recipe and unfortunately only a small amount of leftovers. This is a keeper.

Great recipe! A few substitutions, I used applesauce instead of oil, a substitute I use for any baking now. Did not have marjoram, so I used thyme instead. Pancake mix instead of bisquick. Better consistency than regular cheesy quiche, yum. Made these as muffins 375 for 30 minutes.

Very good!  I used my fresh, home grown herbs and when I went to get the eggs out of the fridge there was only one.  I did a quick search for substitutes and found 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise can be used for an egg.  Yumm it was delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious. I made it "as-is" even though I was a little short on some ingredients. Next time, I will use a heaping half cup of onion. I was worried about the onion and zucchini getting cooked through, but apparently, I cut them just perfectly and they were "al dente" which is good. I used both yellow and green which made it nicely colored. Thanks for sharing such a simple and easy to prepare dish.

We loved this !  I did change it up a bit to meet my tastes.  I used 2 C grated zucchini, 1 C red bell pepper, 3/4 C onion, 5 slices cooked diced bacon, 1/4 t basil, 1/4 t thyme, 1/4 t red pepper flakes, 1 T fresh Italian parsley, 1/2 t salt, skipped the oil and replaced with 1/2 C greek yogurt and 1/2 C cheddar cheese along with the other standard ingredients.  I also sauteed the onion and red bell pepper together.  WOW!  It was so yummy!  What's nice is that even cold it's great, but if you pop a cold slice in the oven and heat for 15 minutes or so at about 400, the crust gets nice and crunchy!  Serve with some fresh cherry tomatoes to give it a fresh taste and it's great.  A great recipe to make your own by using your favorite ingredients.  Next time I'm going to add fresh mushroom!  Thank you for this great recipe!

I found this extremely bland.  I put Louisiana Hot Sauce on it.  Would be better with 2 things.  1)  bacon!  2) make it with a box of Jiffy Cornbread instead of the Bisquick.

Very good, however I didn't follow the recipe exactly I modified it based on the reviews of others. I used a half cup of light sour cream instead of vegetable oil, added a bell pepper, used egg beaters and added garlic salt instead of regular salt. It was way better than I expected it to be. A great way to use all those zucchini I have been growing this summer.

Made this as listed, but it was s little bland.  Would make again, but would add some garlic powder (and a few other seasonings) and shredded cheese on top.

I got this recipe from my mom who made it a number of times in my youth. Her version is almost exactly the same as this one except she used half zucchini slices and half yellow squash slices. Slicing them vs. cubing works out just fine and I imagine it is prettier.  My mom's version also says you can use oregano or marjoram. I usually use oregano and it is delicious. I also use 2 Tbs of chopped parsley instead of 1 tsp. I use Bisquick as the baking mix.

A BIG hit in this household~I live with my mother and she rarely cooks anymore, she LOVED it! She had helpings after helping! LOL. The only thing I changed was that I used 5 cups of diced zucchini instead of 3 and I think next time I will use more spices like garlic powder.

It was very good.  I only used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and I didn't have any marjoram, but my mother-in-law thought it was great.  Even my teenager loves it.  We have found a new summer time favorite!

I used less oil by 2/3 and regular flour and added two handfuls of sharp cheddar cheese. Two of my friends liked it and I will make it again.  I think yellow squash would be nice ,too

Took this to a pie party and people loved it! As I read from some other users,  added some shredded carrots to the mix and instead of marjoram, used Italian seasoning.  Used Buttermilk Biscuit baking mix. Delicious!

Always looking for ways to cook zucchini this time of year. Threw in finely chopped carrot from the garden.  Loved texture of this.

I made this two weeks ago with the abundance of zucchini that is growing in my garden.  I always make things exactly as stated, but didn't have marjoram, so used oregano instead.  I was a bit disappointed.  It just tasted flat.  I did however use the new Bisquick without transfats. 

I have been making almost exactly the same recipe for 35 years, but couldn't find my version until today. It was given to me by a colleague I used to work with.  Her recipe called for the zucchini to be sliced, which makes the presentation so much nicer and it also specifically states 1/2 c. of chopped onion and 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt and cooks for 45 minutes which I think makes it  a 5 star recipe in my opinion.  Now to use up all that zucchini.  I will freeze this and hope it reheats well.

It was easy, tasted OK, but it really was not very flavorful. I'll try cheddar and some crushed red pepper and cilantro next time to try for a little more punch. It's not something to be avoided, just something to be "modified"

Made it with ingredients exactly as written but I shredded the zucchini. This one is a keeper for sure! Came out holding each slice shape beautifully. Will make it again; a great use of all the summer squash.

I loved this recipe as is, but my husband thinks it needs something.  I'm cooking it today with 1 cup of diced ham added to it.  I may also try it will yellow summer squash instead.

I saw this recipe and had to make it, because it looked exactly like a pie my grandmom used to make - it tasted great, and exactly like grandmoms! Taking advise from other reviews, I first sauteed the zucchini and onions (and 1 clove of garlic) in some olive oil. I used 3 eggs and 2 egg whites, and only about 1/3 cup vegetable oil (next time i plan on trying it with Fat Free Sour cream, as other users suggested). I also used grated locatelli cheese. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Mine took about 35 minutes to cook, but it was delicious and very easy. Highly recommended!
