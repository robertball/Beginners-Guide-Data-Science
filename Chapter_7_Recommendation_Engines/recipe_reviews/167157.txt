I just used normal mushrooms because I was trying to find a recipe to use up what I had in the fridge. Very tasty and easy to make.

Ehh, just okay. I made the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of substituting ground pecans for ground walnuts and lightening up a little on the nutmeg, since I use fresh-ground. The nuts gave the dish a weird consistency, and it wasn't so much a sauce as a topping. I let the "sauce" start to brown as directed in the skillet before adding the fish and putting it in the oven, but it still looked kind of brownish gray when done, and was nearly impossible to plate without the fish falling apart.
