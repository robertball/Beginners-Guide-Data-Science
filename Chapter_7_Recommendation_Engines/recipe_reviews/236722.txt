I was looking for something to spice up the tins of sardines we had in the cupboard and this worked very well (good flavor). I did accidentally leave out the garbanzos (and I used the whole eggplant because I had a small one and didn't want to leave the rest in the fridge). The coconut oil I had was in solid form so I had to heat it to coat the veggies and I think it took more than 1 tbsp. to do it.
