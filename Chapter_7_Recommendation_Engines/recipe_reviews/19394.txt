Good lasagna Sabra! The pepperoni added a nice spice. I also chopped up fresh parsley and roasted red peppers to add to the ricotta along with mozarella. By the way, just a hint; no need to boil your noodles. Just soak them in a roasting pan filled with warm water for about thirty minutes. The noodles won't tear like they do when either trying to fish them out of the pot or draining them in a colander. This method leaves them just the right consistancy to start building your lasagna. Thanks so much!

This lasagna tasted GREAT!  The reason for the three star rating was the ingredient amount and yield amount.  In a 9x13 pan, you have about 12 servings, not 6.  I used a full 28oz jar of sauce, and it wasn't enough.  Make sure you get more than the recipe calls for and that it's not chunky, but smooth.  I also used about double the amount of cheese that they called for.  This was based on the given directions.  With less layers, the stated ingredient amounts might work.

Absolutely wonderful!  The best lasagna recipe I have ever come across.  People are BEGGING me to make this again!  I would recommend making it a day ahead and refrigerating for a day.  I also do half ricotta cheese and half cottage cheese.  Also adding 1 pound of Italian sausage seals the deal on this recipe!  The spices set it and the taste is even more fantastic!

I've never made lasagna before, so I came to trusty allrecipes for help. I used mild ground sausage rather than pepperoni and combined it with the ground beef. Also, I used regular Ragu Flavored with Meat, added red wine, and let it simmer for about an hour before preparing the lasagna. My family loved it! I made Garlic Bread Fantastique (from this site) to go with it, and it was a spectacular meal. I think it's the best lasagna I've ever had!

I made it for the first time today and the entire family loved it! I made a few changes which worked well for us. I first ground the beef,then once drained add all seasonings to the beef and let it cook well. Added the sause and set it on a low simmer for an hour so that the meat sauce had real flavour to it.I used two jars of sauce and tons of garlic and cajun seasonings to give it kick.

Gotta love it!! I used Barilla no boil noddles and italian sausage in place of ground beef. Very hearty and tons of flavor! The pepperoni and sausage together give it a nice zing.

Really great recipe!  I had never made lasagna before so I was a little intimidated but it came out great.  I added a little more garlic and it wasn't overpowering.  I did use 2 jars of sauce as suggested by other reviewers and it was perfect.  This turned out fantastic.  It was a bit of a mess b/c it ended up slighlty deeper than my pan but a cookie sheet lined with foil in the rack underneath saved my oven.  Overall all the dirty pots and pans were worth the effort as it makes a ton of food and we had plenty of leftovers.  Thanks for sharing this!

This was awesome!! It made alot so I had friends over to share it and everyone loved it! I accidently mixed the meat beef and pasta sauce the first time and the second time I did it according to the recipe and I liked it better mixed. I also used ground turkey and no one noticed! Great recipe! I make it atleast once a month now.

My mom always puts sliced hard boiled eggs in between the layers and it comes out fantastic and no one can figure out the secret ingredient.  That would take your great recipe over the top. Try it!

it was good, but I would suggest not to use 2 pounds of ricotta cheese that was way to much.

the pepperonit gave it nice flavor but we mostly tasted ricotta cheese - maybe use less next time & we also doubled the amount of sauce per a lot of other reviews.

I think my problem is that I'm not a fan of Ricotta cheese. I wanted to try it again since I havent had it since I was pregnant, thinking that might have been the issue. But I still didn't like it. The husband loved this though!

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the amount of spaghetti sauce.  I used 32 ounces and it covered the layers perfectly.  The pepperoni gives it a nice flavor without weighting it down like Italian sausage can.  Probably the best lasagna I have ever tasted.  Thanks Savery!

excellent lasagna!  I usually don't make meat Lasagna, but this was so tasty.  I did soak the noodles in warm water, it worked, but I prefer them cooked I think.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a super lasagna! I use the "no boil" noodles and they work great. I've also used sausage in addition to beef and that turned out good too.

I made this lasagna it turned out very nice.  I liked it, but I couldn't get past the pepperoni in the lasagna.  My husband and a girl from work love the pepperoni in it, but I thought the flovor was too strong, so if I do make it again I'll probably just put pepperonis on half of it.

Good lasagna!  I added onion and garlic to the hamburger, and simmered it with the sauce for about 45 minutes.  Did not add garlic to the cheese mixture because I don't like garlic-y cheese (personal thing).  Used extra sauce and no-boil noodles.  Yummy!

I made this for work one night because we were doing a Italian themed dinner. This was the perfect recipe to please everybody! It was very simple to make. The only changes I made was that I half the ricotta cheese, used parmesan cheese instead of romano and used turkey pepperoni. I also combined the beef and sauce into one saucepan to cook together. I found that it was easier to work with when topping the layers. I love this recipe and will probably use it again for the next time I want to make lasagna!

this was really good, but i did make changes. definitely need to use 2 jars of sauce. like others suggested browned meat and added about 1 1/2 jars of sauce to meat and some italian seasoning and simmered about 10-15min. i also only used about 1/8 c. basil since it's kind of strong and i'm glad i did anymore and it would have been too overwhelming. and next time i think i would only use 1 ricotta and 1 cottage cheese, just a personal texture preference. i think the romano cheese is what made this recipe outstanding. and as always when i make lasagna, i was only able to get 2 layers in my 9x13 and even then it was overflowing, i put a piece of foil on rack beneath to catch the drippings

I tried this lasagna after reading all the good reviews.  I actually made it for Christmas lunch.  Everyone raved!  It was a big hit.  They loved the layers of pepperonis.  I will definitely make this again.  I made one change.  I didn't use 1/4 cup of dried basil.  Instead, I used 1 full tablespoon of dried basil and 1 full tablespoon of Italian seasoning in the ricotta mix.

This was an absolutely delicious lasagna!  I made it for my husband and sister last night and they ate until they were stuffed, then went back for more as a late night snack!  I do agree with some of the others that you could use more sauce (you can never have enough in my opinion!) and I also added garlic and sauce to my meat (a pork, veal, beef blend) as well as parmesan cheese to the ricotta blend.  Besides these additions I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly!  I will definitely be sharing this recipe with others!

I've been making this for 5 years and I LOVE it! Everyone I ever make it for says it's the best lasagna they've ever had!! I've tweaked some things to make it just how I like it but the original recipe is fantastic! Make the "Garlic Bread Fantastique" recipe to go with it...it's amazing!

I have become famous for this lasagna-although I do give credit that it's not technically my recipe.  My nephew calls it "Aunt Mary's Super Yummy Lasagna."  I have never received anything but rave reviews, and I love love love this lasagna.  I don't think I'll ever try another recipe.  Thank you!

I did not care for this recipe. 2/3 of a 28 oz jar is not nearly enough sauce to make a 9x13" dish of lasagna. Also, the instructions say to place 3-4 noodles across the dish overlapping, but 3 noodles not overlapping is barely half the dish width. If you were to overlap the noodles, you need more like 5-6 for a 9 x 13" baking dish. Nothing is more frustrating than trying to make a recipe and finding that you don't have enough sauce. I added 15 oz of plain tomato sauce plus italian spices as well as red wine to my 28 oz jar of sauce, and this was still the driest lasagna that I have ever made. There was barely enough sauce to cover the last layer of noodles thinly spread, definitely not enough to 'pour' over the top. A cooking novice would be extremely frustrated with this highly rated recipe.

This was a pretty easy recipe to use and the taste is great!  I cut mine into 8 pieces because 6 servings of 921 calories each was too much.

I used ground chicken instead of beef, forgot mozzarella so used parmesan on the top, and used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce.  I also omitted the pepperoni for health reasons.  :)

This recipe was wonderful! The pepperoni really added a great extra flavor to the taste.  I used about 36 oz. of sauce and it was really great!  Family was very happy.

AMAZING!!! I added Kalamata olives and used Turkey Pepperoni. You will definitely need more sauce. If you feel really brave, try addding Artichoke hearts.......UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!

This turned out great! First time I've made homemade lasagna by myself. Based on others' comments, I used 1 lb Italian sausage instead of pepperoni (meant to use 1/2 lb, oops!), and let the sauce simmer with the meat for 20-30 minutes. I ended up using 1 and 2/3 medium (28oz) jars of spaghetti sauce. I also used 1/8 c of basil, but next time I am going to use the full 1/4 cup. I think I might also add oregano and more garlic, as it wasn't seasoned as well as I'd hoped. 

Wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it was going to be, and we ended up with TONS of leftovers (15 pieces in a 9 x 13 pan). Two pieces was plenty for two people.

Made lasagnas before, but we really enjoyed the pepperoni addition. Next time I might half the amount of ground beef and add a half pound of sausage, as well.
It also made teriffic leftovers, sprinkled in parmesan cheese!

I know this recipe already has a TON of kickin reviews. But, let me tell you, this was really Yummy! I've never been a ricotta kindove gal, so was pretty nervous. Fear not my friend!! 


Also, after reading the reviews, I couldn't decide if I should use pepperoni, sausage or ground beef. I used them all! One lb ground beef, 1 lb Italian sausage and 5 oz of mini pepperonis. One jar of spag sauce and (2) 15 oz tomato sauces w/added seasoning did the trick!

It made three healthy layers and baked nicely in a big foil pan I had leftover from Thanksgiving! 

The only thing that would make it better is if it was LOW FAT!! Get me my fork, I'm eating it anyway!

I used turkey sausage and turkey pepperoni. The sauce is way off on this. Needs at least double the amount of the recipe. I increased the amount of mozzarella because the ricotta seemed like alot.

Very good!  I used more sauce than it called for since other users had said it was a tad dry.  I also used no boil lasagna noodles.  I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef and about half the pepperoni it called for.  It was delicious and everyone raved about it at Christmas Eve dinner.  It was served with Garlic Bread Fantastique from this site.  Wonderful! I always make lasagna on Christmas Eve. This may be the recipe I use every year from now on!

I think this was the best lasagna I have ever had!  I changed some of the ingrediants to what I had on hand (1/2 ricotta cheese and 1/2 cottage cheese and ground turkey and pork instead of beef).  I loved the slight spiciness the pepperoni gave.  Will definatly keep in my recipie box for future use!

I thought this was a good recipe. I had to adjust a couple of the ingredients. I used more sauce and less basil. I also used spicy pepperoni b/c my husband and I like our food with a little kick. I will make this recipe again!

The pepperoni added a lovely taste to it, however I like meaty lasagne so would perhaps add some more ground meat next time. Also the cheese mixture was a little dry, then again that could vary from person to person. We enjoyed it.

Very, very good. I did half beef and half spicy sausage and felt that the pepperoni was a bit much. That is probably my fault for using the sausage but next time I will do the same and cut the pepperoni in half. Definitely double the sauce, it's not nearly enough. I'll make this again!

This was okay. There was not much flavor to it. If I make this again I'll probably add parmesian cheese, and possibly other types of cheeses. I also added some italian seasoning to the hamburger.

This is soooo good! I did it exactly the way it said and it came out extremely well! This is one of those recipes that you can follow to the last detail and if you decide to add layers of something else like olives or like someone stated below about their mom adding a layer of sliced hard boiled eggs then you can! This is most DEFINITELY a keeper and a recipe I'll use to impress!

5 stars from me here.  I copied the last person to review this wonderful lasagna, and also made the "garlic bread fantasique" to go along with the dish.  
 That said, lets turn the focus to this Lasagna dish and praise it, as I highly back this recipe.  I made it almost exactly as "reciped" here, but only did one garlic glove to keep sneezing down.  I also used one extra jar of spaghetti sauce.  This was the first time I made lasagna, and I'm glad it was this dish.  It to me was idiot proof, which I am, and that made the results even more grand to my girlfriend and myself who loves this dish.  I've made this twice in 2 weeks and love it.  I sound like garfield in making it twice so far, as its a huge dish full of greatness, so be it.  Wonderful ingredients, easy directions.  To new users, take a note of what other reviewers have said as the collective thoughts on this dish can only help in the long run.
 A HUGE THANKS to the recipe poster for doing posting this wonderful meal!

This lasagna was very tasty! My family really liked it. I added more sauce than the recipe called for. Next time I will increase the measurements for the ricotta cheese mixture because my husband and boys felt it needed more of the "cheese filling". I will be making this again and highly recommend this recipe. The pepperoni adds a lot of flavor.

Yes, pretty yummy.  I didn't have Romano cheese so used Parmesan, but otherwise made as is.  I do agree it could've used more sauce, though it was still good.  The pepperoni is what kind of made this different -- I used turkey pepperoni and kinda wished I'd used regular just for the extra kick.

I made this for a family party & everyone liked it alot...but they LOVED the creamy chicken lasagna recipe.  I changed this a bit to make the sauce better...I added the cooked beef, a package of pepperoni & 2 roasted red peppers to the sauce. They loved the sauce. Will definitely make again.

Very good. Very easy to make. I doubled the ground beef. Used low fat ricotta and cut the amount in half. Used turkey pepperoni and 12 pcs. of lasagna noodles. Added a little oregano.

This lasagne is amazing; I made it last night to rave reviews.  I followed the recipe, except I used two jars of sauce - one traditional, one sausage - and doubled the romano and mozarella.  Delicious!

My entire family enjoyed this dish, even the ones that aren't so crazy about pepperoni!  I thought the pepperoni was a nice little twist to the traditional Lasagna recipe.  The 1/4 CUP of dried basil kind of threw me off, because it sounded like a whole lot.  I used a tomato basil sauce and I did add a little more sauce to the recipe than called for and then I just added 1/2 tsp of basil to the cheese mixture and it tasted great!

I used ground Italian sausage instead of pepperoni and homemade sauce instead of jarred.  As other reviewers have said, I think one jar of sauce wouldn't be enough - my homemade version makes the equivalent of 2 jars and I used it all. Beware, though, if you do use extra sauce this will really fill up (to the rim) a 9X13 pan. It may run over... 
The flavor of the lasagna was great - my kids even liked it cold!

This lasagna was the BEST lasagna I have ever had. Instead of dirtying two dishes I decided to combine the beef and the sauce but in doing so, I ended up using two cans of sauce. I used the Prego Roasted Garlic Parmesan sauce and Boars Head pepperoni. The flavors were phenomenal together. I highly suggest making this dish. It is one of those dishes where I wish my stomach could hold the entire dish, haha.

Made it as a special Valentines Day dinner for my family.  The guys didn't like it but the girls did.  The guys said it was too dry, and I even added more sauce than what it called for.  If I made it again, it would have to be tweaked.

Very yummy indeed! I liked the combination of pepperoni and ground beef. I added a can of diced tomatoes on top because I ran out of sauce, but it made it extra flavorful. I'll definitely make it again.

This was the first time that I ever attempted lasagna, but it turned out amazing.  I used Italian sausage instead of pepperonni, and added almost 2x's the recommended sauce.  Everyone agreed that this was one of the best lasagnas they've had, I will definately make this again!

I love this easy recipe.  You do not need a whole lot of ingredients.  Just needs more spaghetti sauce.  I made it one night for my in-laws and I don't cook, nor do they usually eat anything I cook, but they had seconds.  My husband asks for it all the time.

My Italian husband who is usually not impressed with the way that I cook loved this recipie.  The only change I made was I used less pepperoni than it called for and he thought it was good that I did that to keep it from being too overpowering.  I used 2 tomato sause jars that were Garlic and Olive Oil flavored.  This really was the best lasagna that I ever tasted and definitely the best meal I ever cooked.

While I did make a few adjustments, this was a great recipe! I used a few of the suggestions like double sauce and mozzarella cheese, adding chopped onion to my ground beef (1.35lbs) and simmering in most of the sauce for about 45 minutes (reserved a bit without meat for the bottom of the pan and final layer). I also needed more noodles as the disposable, aluminum 9x13 pan used for the pot luck held three layers of four noodles. I held back a little on the amount of pepperoni, but love the kick it gives! The sauce I used was sweet tomato basil so it worked perfectly for my absence of dried basil.

Yummy is right. I made this for my book club & everyone thought it smelled and tasted delicious. I used: no bake noodles, 2 24oz Barilla Tomato & Basil sauce (I like a lot of sauce), and fresh basil and oregano, and Italian Turkey sausage and turkey pepperoni.

Flipping delicious ! I like it cheesy, used 3lbs of ricotta.  Biazzo is fantastic ricotta.  2 quarts sauce (I make my own). Didn't really care for the pepperoni. I used BPV (beef/pork/veal mix) plus a pkg (6 links taken out of casing)of HOT sausage.  16oz. of mozzarella. Let sit for 20-25 min covered.

This recipe needed about twice the amount of sauce in it and I wasn't thrilled with the overwhelming basil flavor. With a few tweaks, I will make again.

This was excellent. The pepperoni was a nice twist. My family loved it, my only regret is that I didn't make two pans! I have no interest in trying any other recipe. Ever. It was just that good!

So good! I modified mine slightly and everyone loved it. Instead of dried basil (cause I didn't have any lol) I used Italiano seasoning and fresh mushrooms to the Ragu sauce. Everyone loved it!

The changes I made were as follows:  I substituted beef with ground turkey and it was delicious.  Not only is it healthier but ground turkey absorbs flavors.  I use it for spaghetti, tacos, etc and it's much better tasting.  I did use oven ready pasta for the first time and it worked out really well.   I also used half basil and half Italian seasoning.  My husband loved it!!

Added a few cans of mild diced chilis to give it a kick.  Next time will try a hotter batch with the  medium or hot versions.  Even try a little Rotel in the sauce.

I made this for company and everyone loved it! I did swap out ground Italian sausage for the ground beef because I prefer sausage to beef in my lasagnas. Otherwise, the only other changes I made was to soak the noodles in hot water for about 20 minutes (rather than boiling them) and increased the spaghetti sauce to one-and-a-half jars.  I also seasoned the sauce a bit more with various Italian seasonings.

Best lasagna recipe EVER! ! It's very kid friendly, even for the pickiest of eaters. I did not add pepperoni, so I used 2lbs of ground beef instead.  I also use the ready to bake noodles, and cook for 45 minutes, covered.  Then another 15 uncovered,  perfect everytime!

This is good as written, nice and mild with a decent flavor, but I think I'm going to make some changes next time. I'm going to add a pound of ricotta (there wasn't enough to spread evenly), probably some sauteed onions and mushrooms, plus bell pepper and possibly olives. I also plan to double the meet and use chunks of pepperoni instead of slices - the pepperoni slices just weren't enough.

This is a great recipe. My family loved it, especially my 3 year old who is normally picky. I must say, if I had not read some reviews first that suggested twice as much sauce & twice as much cheese.....I could not imagine that this recipe would have turned out as well as it did. Good recipe but some measurements are significantly off.....but thanks just the same for sharing:))
BTW....tried this with chicken sausage & it was awesome!! Also added sharp cheddar. Will definitely make this again:))

May need a little more sauce than one jar; was kind of dry but the pepperonis were great!  I'm also going to try cottage cheese next time instead of ricotta.

Great flavor but the ingredient ratio was off.  Too much ricotta, not enough pasta or sauce.
Next time, simply buy ingredients and layer into pan until full..

Delicious recipe!! Thank you so much, my family dinner was a success!! I had to use more sauce than the recipe called for and added minced onion and green pepper to the sauce. I made 2lbs ground beef by mistake and used it all. I seasoned it with some garlic powder for some extra flavor and it worked out well, since I did not have pepperoni on hand.

Great lasagna! We don't eat pork, so we used turkey pepperonis and the dish was delish! I also used only 1 lb of ricotta. I could have used some more sauce; I only used one jar and the edges got a little dry. Yummy meal for the whole family!

I don't think my ratios were off, but the lasagna was pretty dry. Flavor was good, so next time I will add more sauce and cheese to make it more moist.

I like this lasagna recipe!  I did use ground chicken instead of beef and a little less mozzerella just to make it a little bit healthier.  Overall it was a hit at our house.
