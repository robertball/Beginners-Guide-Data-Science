Excellent Soup.  I used 2 cans of black beans, fire roasted tomatoes in place of the regular canned tomatoes, lean diced ham instead of the sausage, chili powder to taste, and fresh pico de gallo instead of the salsa.  I will add it to the rotation.  Maybe next time I will try adding rice for a change as others have suggested.

Simple and delicious! My husband couldn't stop going back for more. (Will add water today when I reheat some for lunch.) I made this with sweet Italian sausage, which I cooked separately. I used two cans of beans, added a can of corn and served this over rice (with bread on the side). Omitted the cilantro. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It's nice to find one my husband is so enthusiastic about!

All 3 of us enjoyed this.  It was a little salty for me, but my husband and son like it just the way it is.  Very simple and fast to make.

The only addition I made to this recipe was using a chunky corn and black bean salsa, which added a good kick.  I served with crusty whole wheat bread and roasted tomato tapenade.

I have used many recipes on this site, but this one is my favorite!  Thanks for posting this one on here.  Quick, easy and delicious!

This soup recipe tasted very good with just a can of regular pork and beans with the salsa and turkey sausages added to it for spicy tomato flavour that I like. It will always be a favourite of mine.

i thought this was ok, but too watery, not enough beans.  i had to add beans to the leftovers.  next time i'll add another can of whole black beans and maybe a can of refried beans to thicken it up.

Hubby made this for a chili-cook off at our church and called it "Cajun Chili"  He left out the cilantro, used smoked sausage and added quite a bit of Tony Chacheres creole seasoning and generic 'cajun spice'... It was very good and won 3rd place :)

This is so delicious, even after being full, I wanted more!  Some of the other reviews said the soup was to watery, so to be safe, I used 8 oz. of the beef broth rather than 10.5.  That's the only change I made and it was fantastic.  (It would be fine with the 10.5 oz, too, in my opinion.)  

The sausage added such flavor to the soup.  This is certainly a crowd pleaser, and I'm glad I found another way to use sausage.  Yummy!

We made this for a large group (75) today and got lots of smiles and thumbs up. I did add cumin for a smoky flavor and a bit of plain black pepper. Will definitely keep this recipe around. SallyD

We loved this recipe. I used turkey sausage in place of beef sausage. I also cooked the sausage in the pan took it out and then cooked the onions and garlic. I did add a little cumin.
Other than that, I went by the recipe!!

This was fabulous.  I doubled it first on the first try and was hoping for leftovers for my husband.  I was surprised to find that there was nothing left.  What is even better it was cheap, easy and fast to make.

This was awesome!!  my husband and I believe in making the recipe just as instruced and then add what we think would be better next time.  However this one needs no real help - it was great! - the only thing my husband wants me to do is add another can of black beans.  Realy Realy good - thank you for this one.

This was so good! I omitted the 1/2 cup of water and added half a can of fat free refried beans to make the soup a little thicker.  I used italian sausage and black bean corn salsa like others have suggested.  I also think it's really important to use the cilantro at the end.  It's gives a nice fresh taste mixed with all the spice. Thanks for sharing!

I made the recipe just instructed but added some corn and sauteed some celery with the onion.   It seemed to be  lacking  something; so I read the reviews and decided to add a little white pepper and some cumin as suggested.  It is a 5 star after the cumin was added!  Next time I will add  an  extra can of black beans as well.

Very good and tasty.  Quite versatile too, I imagine this would taste good with all sorts of beans or corn.  I left out the salsa and instead used petit diced tomatoes with green chillies.  Yum!

Super Soup with rich and complex flavors from start to finish.  We used hot Italian sausage.  If you love soup/stews give this one a try.

I loved the unique flavor I got while adding to and experimenting with the original receipe!  I added mexicorn, ocra, smoked sausage instead of regular, and I am eating a few one cup measuring cups before my husband comes home and cleans it out!

This was very good. I added a bit of green pepper at the outset. I had to use pork sausage instead of beef, but it was good. The salsa I used was Dee's Famous Salsa from this site. Like others, I felt it would play well over a starch, so we had it over a heavy duty corkscrew type macaroni. DH topped his with cheddar. I think we'll have take two tomorrow  night by adding 1/2 cup corn and serving with a savory corn muffin.

Deliciously easy!  I sauteed the sausage (smoke turkey) along with the onions and garlic.  Used two cans of beans, and diced tomatoes with mild chilies.  An instant family favorite.

Excellent recipe.  I had some left over hot Italian sausage and wanted something to put over pasta.  So I used all the ingredients except for the broth since I didn't want it that soupy for pasta.  It was so good on a chilly rainy day!

I have used many recipes on this site but this is the first one that I will being leaving a review on.  WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I misunderstood and did not read the entire recipe before I purchased my sausage.  I bought hot ground sausage.  It made a spicy, yummy soup.  I did as others had suggested and added green peppers, corn and added another can of beans.  I forgot to add the can of broth but did not miss it at all.  We topped the soup with sour cream and cheese.  We also dipped and scoped with tortilla chips.  Will make again!

This was very good. I added a green bell pepper and used water instead of beef broth. I added a ton of spices to it and served it with a dollop of sour cream and cilantro, yummy!

We really like this soup at our house.  It came out kind of loose for me too so I did add a can of refried beans as another chef suggested.  I also added frozen corn and frozen okra, which I love.  I omitted the salsa and added a small can of green chilis.  But, I think what really turns it extremely tasty is the Muir Glen fire-roasted tomatoes that use in any recipe that calls for canned tomatoes.  Their smoky flavor just takes me over the edge.

I have been using a variation of this recipe for years and I love it.  I substitute lean ground pork for the sausage and use low sodium broth and tomatoes to cut some of the fat and salt.  I also add in chopped baby spinach near the end... It's fantastic!

Impressed by how easy this was, and yummy. I ended up adding about 2 c. water to get it to our likeness. I also added half a can of diced green chiles.

Wow, this was a good soup. I was looking for a recipe to get rid of leftovers.. saussage and salsa... who would have thought this would be so great. I am buying more saussage to make this recipe now. I did not have the celantro, but I did have fresh dill, that was great too. My wife liked it with sour cream on top.

I doubled this recipe for our family of four, so everyone could have seconds.  These are my additions to the recipe as written (for four servings):   1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp sugar (to cut the tomatoes' acidity). and I cup of frozen mixed vegetables and 1/2 cup of frozen corn added the last 15 min.  I also doubled the beans.  I topped with a dollop of plain yogurt (healthy substitute for sour cream), some finely sliced scallions, and a sprinkle of Mexican-blend shredded cheese.  It was pretty good.  Next time I will try adding some crushed dried poblano pepper or some powdered ancho chile to give the flavors a little more dimension.

I have another recipe that is mexican based that use to be our favorite… This is now a family favorite forever!  I also loved adding corn and rice which helps soak up some of that rich, flavorful broth!  SO delicious and fast!  (I only used half the salsa for my kids' sake, and still delicious!)

I made this recipe exactly as directed except I used spicy turkey sausage. It tasted like bland tomato soup with sausage in it.  I have a lot left over so I'll use it as a base for chili.

Loved the soup.  Made it according to recipe.  One exception - I didn't have salsa, but I did have a chipotle chile in adobo sauce.  I used a whole chile with some of the sauce which can be quite hot, so use 1/2 of the chile.  Husband loved it.

Absolutely delicious!  Will make again and again, I added a can of corn, rice, and I used Italian seasoned stewed tomatoes instead of plain. The cilantro makes it delicious.

I make this all the time and we love it.  Made some changes just because it's what I had, it was really good!  I used "Mexican Stewed Tomatoes" instead of regular, and Campbells Beef Consomme.  It was a whole different flavor. Also, I always saute a green pepper in there as well.  Hubby said this was the best batch yet!

I love this recipe and think its great as is or a prime starting point to create something your taste buds will love. Have to say pick a good salsa though because it effects the flavor or lack there of. I like a chipotle salsa with fresh chopped jalapeños and adding different types of beans. Plus white rice and corn, when adding rice make sure to watch the fluid levels and add as needed :)

This was a tasty and filling recipe!  For some reason the shop was out of black beans so I substituted white beans, kidney beans cold have worked just as well I think.  They also only had pork sausages no beef so I purchased beef meatballs and fried them before cutting in half to put in the soup.  Thank you for sharing!

I didn't have a lot of sausage choice and I bought regular beef sausauge. I didn't feel comfortable adding it in without cooking it, so I did, after sauteeing the onions and garlic. I added the rest of the soup ingredients and brought to the boil. Found it a bit grey looking so I added some peppers for colour. I simmered it for about 20 minutes to cook off some of the liquid, because it seemed a bit watery. I also think it could use more beans because even though I used a whole 19 oz. can it didn't seem enough. The end result, though, was very tasty.

Very quick, easy & tasty.  I didn't read the recipe carefully and drained the beans because I usually do.  but it was fine.  I did use 2 cans of beans and one 14 oz can of chicken broth in place of the beef broth + water, only 2 links of spicy turkey sausage, and added a little cumin.  Served with avocado slices and homemade corn tortillas.  Will be making this again.

I just love this recipe and it continues to be a hit with the family. I normally use Italian sausage (sometimes spicy to give it a kick) and 100% recommend a second can of black beans. I use Goya Cilantro in a jar (very convenient) and also selected stew tomatoes with a little bite to it (for example, one with garlic and onions).

My husband made a lighter version of this. He put in chicken andouille sausage instead of beef sausage, added fire roasted corn and doubled the black beans. He also seasoned it with cumin, chili powder and black pepper like others had suggested. He also used pam instead of canola oil. It turned out wonderfully!! We will definitely make it again!

Okay, I wasn't really all fired up impressed with this recipe.  It was okay, but nothing that I got excited over.  The reason for four stars is because the ingredients are often items I have in the house, and I know in a pinch I can call up this recipe again.  I did add celery and carrots to the mix, simmering them before I added the other ingredients, plus I also added one can of white (cannelli) beans with the black.  I'll probably make it again when I need a quick and easy meal.

The only changes I made were to use extra spicy Andouille sausage, and I added some onion and garlic powders. Oh, I also omitted the water as I wanted it to be more of a stew. If I were to make it again - which I probably will as it was so quick, easy and tasty - I would add a can of corn. Thanks!

Loved it!  I read the prior reviews and added a green pepper and an additional can of black beans.  In addition, I made 1 other change, at the end of cooking, I used my stick blender and ran it through a few times to make it a little thicker.  Great soup for a cold night.

This turned out really good. I used chicken broth and chicken sausage. And canned tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. Black beans I soaked and cooked instead of using canned beans.

We had this on Christmas Eve 2008.

I changed the recipe, so I am rating how I think the original recipe would've been, not the recipe with my changes. I left out the salsa, which I think was a mistake because my soup was bland.  To make up for it, I added cumin, ground coriander, paprika and oregano.  I think it would've been fine with just the cumin and maybe the ground coriander.  It was below zero outside last night when I made this, and it was great with some toast and a glass of red wine - very hearty and warming.  It was also quick to make.  I'm not a big fan of chili (just because of the flavor of chili powder itself), so this is a great alternative.

This is good but I didn't think it had enough black beans, so I also added another can.  I also found it a little salty so next time I will soak the sausage in some water for a few minutes to try and reduce some of the salt.  I will make it again.

This soup made it into our regular rotation - it's really easy and tastes great! We often vary the meat in it and adjust the broth accordingly... we've used italian sausage (cooked first in the pot) with ham base and chicken sausage with chicken broth. And you can throw in pretty much any kind of canned tomatoes in there and it's still delicious. To make it a bit more hearty & nutritrious, we add about 2 cups of a wild & brown rice mix. We also like it with some extra black beans in there.

Not as thick as I thought it'd be, but easy and delicious! I added an extra can of black beans, drained, put in extra garlic, and used beef salami instead of beef sausage. My roommates loved this soup.

First recipe I've tried from this site. Very impressed, hubby and kids enjoyed it, too. I added more seasoning and used mild salsa and creole seasoning to give it some zing. I added more meat than called for (about 8 chopped Blue Ribbon sausages) and would have added more black beans if I'd had a couple of more cans. All in all, a good filling dinner---nice change of pace for my family.
