This dressing was very good. I added more of the balsamic vinager and less oil, since I prefer a more vinager taste than oil, and added a little more of the spices than called for, but I was quite happy with the results.

This is a very easy and tasty dressing, I use it over fresh spinach. Add a little extra garlic and a very small amount of brown sugar and it's perfect.

I use this all the time for my salad dressing. Our favourite is .. Sliced tomato topped with finely chopped red (salad) onion with the balsamic dressing sprinkled on top refrigerate for 30min and serve.  Its so simple but tastes devine.

Very good, although I think I'll use less olive oil next time.  It was a little too oily for my tastes.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried and it came out fine.  I also added some garlic to it!  Yummy!

Quick and easy. I made this on different occassions with fresh herbs and then dried. Both were very good. I would suggest an mild olive oil though.

I reduced the oil by half and even beefed up the balsamic- I think this is a good one to play with to find that magic mojo. Also added a crushed garlic clove and some fresh rosemary. A good all-around dressing for the Mediterranean Diet- I'm sure I'll be tweaking it some to suit different salads and moods in the future.

Good recipe!  Keep in the fridge though! fresh herbs and olive oil cause salmonilla! Dried herbs can be kept at room temp though.

This is okay, I think I'll be looking for a better recipe. This is way to oily. Also maybe if I used white balsamic vinegar it wouldn't look so bad on the salad. : )

Yummy. I used dried herbs and made in a smaller one time use batch and it came out fine. Good basic dressing. It did the job since we were all out of dressing.  Will make again for sure.

I make this all the time, but use lemon-infused olive oil and a little less oil (or more vinegar).  It is great!! When I stir fry up a bunch of vegetables, I use this as a dressing along with parmesan cheese ~ Yum!

Great dressing and easy to make with things I already had.  I made a smaller amount but used the same propotions.  It had a little too much oil for my liking but that was an easy fix to add more vinegar.  I didn't have fresh oregano so I used the dried, but my husband loved it.  I also used white balsamic

go lighter on oil and heavier on balsamic vinegar.  Girls don't like solid sprigs of rosemary in it so make sure chopped up.

I didn't add the herbs , so maybe that's what made it not that great.  I added a little sugar to it, and some apples and pecans.  It tasted weird, but my kids thought the lettuce was bad because the balsamic dressing makes the lettuce brown.  I don't think I'll use again.

Tried this recipe out as a lighter alternative to store bought dressing. It was yummy! Used grape seed oil as opposed to olive oil and added basil, a bit of ginger, a little cayenne pepper and ground black pepper and sea salt. Definitely will try again. I even made enough to bottle up and use for my next salad.

The simplicity is delicious. I would not have considered myself a salad eater, before making this dressing. Now I put in all salads and love eating salad. And by the way, those expensive simple dressings without the paragraph of ingredient preservatives are no longer needed with this recipe.
I am wondering how long the infused sprigs should be used before changing them out.

following the tips in other reviews I reduced the oil by half and added garlic.  It was good; next time I plan to add 1 tsp dijon mustard to help with the emulsification as well as add a little tartness.

I made this using 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 2 tbsp. balsalmic vinegar, 2 tbsp water. Everything else the same. It was delicious and so simple. I previously made a balsalmic vinegrette that called for multiple ingredients. It was good but time consuming. I believe this may be even better!

I found the white balsamic vinegar too jarring for my taste.
