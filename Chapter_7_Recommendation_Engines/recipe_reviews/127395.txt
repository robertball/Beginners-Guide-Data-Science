This makes a wonderful presentation.  It is very sweet. Found you needed 12 oz. size of cool whip.

For a decadent adult version of this, drizzle Kahlua on the chocolate cake layer! I have been doing this for years and it's definately a hit.

I make the pudding with only 3 cups of milk and then stir in 1/3 cup of Kahlua for a more "adult" flavor.

When my in-laws popped in unexpectedly, this was a life saver. I had seen this dessert brought to potlucks, but had never made one myself until the other night. It is so easy to put together, but the combined presentation and taste make it seem really special. I now have the ingredients stashed away for those last minute guests.

This is an excellent Dessert.  We have a group of friends and we take turns with Pot Luck Dinners.  They insist that I bring this every time.

I'm not sure Kahlua would have improved this.  I made it for Christmas Day dessert.  My kids (boys 16 & 19) actually fought over it!  Forget the rare prime rib I fixed, this was their choice.  How sad, I only got one serving before it disappeared.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Fastastic - I drizzled mine with coffee flavored liqueor, but I cant say we noticed a huge difference with that.  Going to try it again this weekend using all the low fat goodies (skim milk, coolwhip lite, SF FF choc. pudding) for hubbies college graduation party. YUM-O **UPDATE - was still fantastic with all the healthier option ingredients, I will make this one from here on out**

Delicious! I made this as a treat for a family get together and all day was told how incredible this dish was. I told them how easy it was and got a ton of, "you're kidding!!" responses. I will definitely be making this dish in the future, but next time instead of the heath bars I think I will try to substitute peanut butter cups instead. Also- I think drizzling caramel over it would be amazing too. =]

Awesome chocolaty taste....and simple to make! This was a huge hit at my daughter's birthday party. I used real whipping cream, not whipped topping and spread it smooth on top. Used a decorator's bag with frosting and wrote her name on it. Then sprinkled the rest of the chocolate toffee pieces around the edge. Lovely! We'll be repeating this again sometime soon I'm sure...

This was easy to make and didn't take that much time, but it wasn't as yummy as I thought it would be. Nothing bad about it but I don't think I will make it again unless I need to take it to a carry in, because it makes a TON.

A friend brought this to my house for a party. Not being a huge chocolate fan this thing is amazing since I made this 2 days later. I didn't have chocolate bars because she didn't mention it being a layer....so I crushed Oreos which seems to always work. One suggestion is to push down on cake so you have room for the remaining layers. So much air is in the cake. I think this recipe used more pudding than my friend's recipe. We will soon see how big a hit this version is. I'm only posting it now because I'm pretty confident we will start New Years day a couple of ponds heavier.

My aunt always brings this to family get togethers and I'm so glad to have the recipe!!! I think (I'm not sure) that she uses brownies.
