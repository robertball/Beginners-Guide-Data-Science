I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I have made it at least 6 times now and have learned a couple tricks along the way...  After trying several different things, some on my own, some according to some other reviewers, I have learned that the original ingredient suggestions are best, except I add one additional egg for extra richness/thickness.  I prefer this recipe with whole milk, although I think any milk will work.  The key to this recipe is in the length of time you cook it.  You have to be patient!  I found it works best if you bring the mixture to a boil first before starting your "1 hour" cooking time.  Once you add the egg mixture, cook this until it gets to the thickness you want it...  it does NOT get thicker while standing or overnight.  However you take it off the stove is how thick it will be - period.  So if it seems too runny to you, KEEP COOKING!  Also, making the egg mixture before you begin so that it comes to room temp is also key, and then stirring constantly for about 2 minutes once you add it.  Also, I think this pudding is just as good warm as it is cold.  It's very versatile that way and would be great served either way.  Overall this is a very easy and very affordable recipe that just turns out DELICIOUS every time!  I must make it once a week now!  Enjoy!

This is the greatest. I needed a good rice pudding recipe for a party a freind was having, so i looked here and found this one. I figured i would try it, well my stove stopped working so I put the milk and sugar and rice in my crock pot. It turned out to be the hit of the party. So the next time i made it i did it in the crock pot again this time i waited for the milk to get warm before adding the rice and it was even better. This should be rated more than 5 stars and it is worth the wait. In the crock pot it took almost three hours but if your not in a hurry it's a great way to do it cause you don't have to babysit it.i just didn't poor the egg mixture in until it came to the thickness I wanted then after the egg mixture was in i put in on low and let it cook for 20 more minutes. it was the first thing gone at the party

I'm a rice pudding afficionado, and this is a fantastic recipe. Some recipes you see call for the rice to be cooked in water first, which is a bit easier and faster, but doesn't make for very creamy pudding. 

I've made this particular recipe several times and found that an hour of cooking time simply isn't enough. I cooked the pudding on VERY low heat for 80 minutes after the rice, milk, and sugar came to a low simmer. You have to be patient and check/stir the pudding often (every few minutes), or it will boil over (doesn't really hurt the pudding but makes a heck of a mess). 

I increased to sugar by 1/3 cup (we like our desserts sweet) and tempered the egg mixture (I only use 2 eggs or it tastes too custardy) with the cooked pudding before adding the egg mixture to the pudding. Once you add the egg mixture to the pudding, you can only cook the pudding for a few minutes; if you cook it longer than that, you will overcook the eggs, and the pudding will be more like a custard and will have a grainy consistency. The pudding does thicken slighly as it cools, but only slightly, so make sure it's as thick as you want it before adding in the eggs and chilling. 

This takes a bit of effort, but it's well worth it. My husband says it tastes just like our favorite rice pudding we get from a local European bakery. I wouldn't go that far, but I think by substituting heavy cream for some of the milk (a cardiac nightmare but SO good), it would be very close.

Wow. I used 1 percent milk and short grained rice. A few tips (perhaps obvious to some): 1. Do bring the rice/milk/sugar mix to a low boil first over medium heat, stirring pretty often. This is usually the most annoying part, since it takes a while (~15 min?) and you have to monitor it pretty closely. 2. Once it starts to bubble set the heat to the lowest flame and cover. Check back every 10 minutes or so to stir and to make sure the rice doesn't simmer right up to the lid and start spilling over. If you really can't be bothered, just leave the lid slightly ajar and set the flame a tiny bit higher so the pudding simmers. A wooden spoon set on the rim of the pot helps keep the bubbles down, though it really is best to use a deep pot so there's plenty of room above the surface of the liquid.
3. i prepare a small mixing bowl with the remaining ingredients: milk, eggs, salt, some ground nutmeg, and a liberal splash of vanilla extract and whisk until uniform  4. This mixture i pour gradually in increments as i stir the ricemix.
At the end I also stir in about 2 tablespoons' of cold butter.... YUM...

I have to say if I could I would give this recipe a million stars!! It turned out WONDERFUL!  I followed someone else's advise and made it in the crock pot.. it was just way too easy. I used 1/2 quart of cream, and the rest 2% milk, put that in the crock pot on high.  Once it warmed up I added the rice and sugar, someone else suggested 1/3 cup more sugar so I did that, perfect!  I cooked it on high for awhile, then turned down to low..when the rice was finally tender and whole crock pot was thickened, I then added about 4 big spoon fulls of rice mixture to  my eggs (beaten), 1/4 cup cream, vanilla and cinnamon (to your desired taste), stirring well, then cooked it for another 20 minutes or so.  Divided into 2 glass serving dishes (not sure on the size, 7 x 8 maybe).  YUMMY! Move over Uncle Ben's...we've found a new recipe that is definitely a KEEPER! Thank you for submitting this recipe! LOVE IT!

I edited the recipe to fit into my weight watchers program.  I used non-fat milk, fat free egg substitute and splenda for the sugar and it turned out GREAT!  This is definitely a hit with everyone because it works for me (weight watchers) my father (diabetic) and my hubby (low cholesterol)... this was a winner all around!

My favorite Rice Pudding as a child came from the Horn and Hardarts restaurant chain; one supermarket still carries it. This is what I have been searching for, I am so happy to find this recipe because I can finally make it myself.  After reviewing other comments I knew to stir it on low heat to the consistency of my liking.  

I love coconut so I split the amount of milk cooked with the rice in half using coconut milk; which can be purchased in cans.  Also used a vanilla bean where as I split the pod and scraped out the beans and placed them in the egg mixture. I then took the vanilla pod and placed it in the pot to cook with the rice mixture, removed it when the pan was taken off the heat to cool prior to adding the egg mixture.  I love raisins so I soaked them in hot water to plump them up and added them to the pudding once in the dish to cool. Don’t be afraid to make this recipe it is really easy , and I did not have to consistently stand there and stir it.

I don't know where to begin. This is the best rice pudding recipe I have ever tasted and I'm not a big fan of rice pudding.This was GGRREEAAT! I read all the reviews and followed the most important directions:1.let the eggs mixture sit out while the rice cooks, 2.add the milk mixture to the eggs before adding it to the pot, and 3. I inceased the sugar by 1/2 cup. But I must say that an earlier review stated that the pudding does not thicken after standing/refrigerating. mine did and very nicely. THANKS EVERYONE FOR THE TWEEKING.

This recipe was awesome!  I am not sure why people are having trouble with it setting.  Mine was definitely creamy.  I used 2 litres of milk (I converted for Cdn. measurements) and then 1/4 cup of milk for the egg/vanilla mixture, and I beat it really well before mixing into the rice mixture.  You don't have to let it sit overnight - mine was creamy enough already that we ate it warm and covered the rest.  It was great the next day cold as well, and it didn't get soupy or really soggy.  It was worth the hour cooking it.  I did use homo milk (3.25%) and maybe the thicker milk helped?  Great pick!

Everyone one love it!!  I was kind of worried about making this. I read everyone's reviews. Just to make sure I'm doing this right. It asked for a 1/2 gallon of milk and one cup of rice. I wasn't sure how this was going to work out but it did! I used 1/2 gallon of Silk Soy Milk, Very Vanilla. I took one 1/4 cup from the 1/2 gallon of Soy milk. I simmer the soy milk for hour and 20 mins. I took part of the hot mixture and mixed it with the eggs. I slowly poured the egg mixture into the hot mixture. It came out great!! Will make this again.

Unfortunately, this recipe didn't make pudding for me. I follwed the recipe exactly, letting it simmer and stirring frequently. I used whole milk. Having read more reviews now I can see that the 1 hour time on the stove wasn't sufficient for many people. But the recipe is poorly written; it gives you no help as to what the pudding should look like after the one hour, doesn't instruct you to keep cooking if you havent reached a particular consistency. So I just proceeded with the recipe and ended up with all liquid. I'm planning on putting it back on the stove to see if I can salvage it but as written this is pretty much a zero star recipe for me.

I used this recipe and many of the helpful comments to create a TERRIFIC, old-fashioned, luscious vanilla rice pudding in my crockpot:

On the stove, I heated a quart of whole milk and two cups of half-n-half with one cup sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of salt until it just came to a boil. I added a generous cup of arborio rice, and then poured it all into my crockpot. I cooked this on high for 2 1/2 hours, stirring every half hour or so. 

When it was as thick as I wanted it, I whisked together 2 egg yolks, 1/4 cup half-n-half, and two teaspoons of vanilla bean paste. Then I tempered the egg mixture with perhaps a half cup of the hot pudding, a couple of tablespoons at a time. I added this back to the pot, along with two tablespoons of butter, and cooked it on low for twenty minutes, stirring once after ten minutes. 

I transferred the pudding to a storage container and pressed plastic wrap down on top of it to keep a skim from forming. It was DELICIOUS hot from the crockpot, but once it had chilled, it had set up a little more but was still a creamy, pudding-like consistency. YUM!! Thanks for the inspiration...

Delicious! I removed the lid for the last 10 minutes of simmering because it looked very soupy as others have reviewed. This worked well; just stand by and stir as needed so it doesn't get too thick too fast. Do temper the eggs with some of the rice mixture before adding. This is a must whenever you add beaten eggs to any hot liquid. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I actually cooked this in my crock pot on low all night. In the morning it was very thick and nice and ready for the egg mixture, which I tempered and to which I added 1/4 c heavy cream and about 3 or 4 T of butter. Stirred and let cook for another 1/2 hour.  Here is the winning piece: I soaked about a cup of golden raisons in same amount of O'Reilly's Caramel Cream Liquor overnight, then in the morning while it was finishing off I simmered it on the stove to really plump up. Add these to the pot, and surely brought this winning recipe up to the gold standard!

This is a great recipe! Along the way I have altered and tweaked and this is what I do now to the point where I don't even pull the recipe sheet out any longer: I put ONLY the milk and sugar in the pot and let it heat up significantly (to the point of being hot) before adding the rice. This speeds up the cooking process and I have found the rice "holds up" better--eliminating mushy or grainy rice in the end. The drawback is, you DO have to babysit it. Once the milk/sugar/rice mixture gets to a thickness where it is slowly sliding off the spoon and loses the runniness, it is done. Some say it will not thicken beyond this point, but I have found once your egg mixture is added, and the cooling process is done, mine really does thicken more. Allowing the milk and eggs to sit ahead of time until room temperature is essential. I use a light or heavy cream in the egg mixture to add some richness. Also, I find an aromatic long grain rice, like Basmati or Jasmati, adds a nice touch! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

You have to use a crockpot!  It was so easy!  4 hours cooking on high, then added the egg mixture.  be sure to mix it very well before letting it cook for an additional 15 minutes!  I've never been able to make it THIS GOOD!  It was a huge hit at our Thansgiving Day table!

I have scoured the web for a good rice pudding recipe. Found it!  This recipe turned out so much better than my expectations, I'm very happy to say.  I had fabulous results as it seems the majority of reviewers did.  Based on personal tastes and some advice I read, I did make some slight changes:  I waited until the rice was cooked tender before I added the sugar based upon reading that sugar can kind of keep it "al dente" which is not desirable in a rice pudding.  I added about 3/4 cup of golden raisins into the rice and milk at the beginning, and I put in about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of butter.  In the egg mixture, I used 4 eggs and I did add more vanilla, I used 2 tablespoons instead of teaspoons.  I put some freshly ground nutmeg in the egg mixture too.  I made the egg mixture as soon as I started the rice to get it up closer to room temp, and I tempered the mixture with the milk from the rice before adding to the rice to avoid the possibility of a scrambled egg effect.  When it was all finished, I ground some more fresh nutmeg over the top in place of the cinnamon, just a personal taste thing.  It has thickened up beautifully, perfectly.  It tastes divine, even hot, and I can't wait until it's cold.  I'm going to cut up some fresh strawberries to put on top along with some whipped cream, yummy!!

I have made this pudding about 8 times now and I've got to stop. It tastes so good I cannot stop eating it and when I can finally walk away from it I am back again shortly afterwards. The last batch didn't make it past 12 hours before it was gone.

For those that have had failures making this, well so did I. I finally worked it out by being patient; it has not yet come to thickness in 1 hour and usually takes closer to 1-1/2 hours. Part of the reason is that I hate standing around to constantly stir the pudding, so as soon as the milk/sugar mixture begins to boil I add the rice, turn the heat to low and stir until the mixture temperature has dropped to where I am confident it won't boil over if left unattended. I made the mistake once of turning the heat back up to speed the thickening and in the 5 minutes I was out of the kitchen it boiled over.

One thing I do that makes a big flavor difference is to put in a one or two sticks of cinnamon the whole time it cooks right up until I add the eggs. If you do this you won't need to sprinkle cinnamon powder on top as it will have all the cinnamon flavor it needs.

I also found that an egg substitute has less chance of becoming "scrambled," even if you temper the eggs. In other words the egg substitute seems to be more heat tolerant.

And, for me at least, contrary to what some have written the mixture will thicken more once poured in the baking dish. My last batch I cooked was really thick.

Wonderful just as written except I didn't want to waste all my time in front of the stove, so I plopped it into my crockpot on high. I started timing it when it boiled. Took quite awhile, but it was worth the wait. I wondered if it would ever thicken, but the eggs did the trick. Try it. It's the ultimate comfort food! UPDATE: The 2nd time I made this, I heated the milk a bit b4 I put it in the crockpot and it took only about an hour to get thick and done after it had started boiling. I tried something new....I had some leftover cream of coconut and crushed pineapple in the fridge, so I cut back a bit on the milk and added the cream of cocnut and crushed pineapple. I left out the cinnamon and added only about 1/4 cup honey instead of sugar. I can barely stop eating this although the next time I will add more cream of coconut. It tastes kinda like a pina colada. Remember that cream of coconut is sweet, so taste b4 adding any other sweetener.

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!  I made it on the stove yesterday and then again in the crock pot today.  I used arborio rice and used Splenda in place of the sugar.  I also added cinnamon sticks to the milk as suggested by others, PLUS raisins because we love them in our rice pudding.  Otherwise, the recipe is perfect as written.  It did take about 30 minutes longer on the stove than the recipe said.  FOR MAKING IN THE CROCK POT, I first heated the milk, Splenda and cinnamon sticks on the stove before putting in the crock pot on low.  I stirred it after an hour in the crock pot and then continued cooking it and stirring occassionally.  It took 3 1/2  hours on low.  Then I added the raisins for about 10 minutes to plump and slowly stirred in the beaten egg mixture and turned off the pot. Refrigerated until chilled. It was perfect. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

This has become the top-selling dessert at my cafe...we've been using arborio rice instead of the long-grain variety, and finishing off with heavy cream instead of milk, and vanilla bean paste instead of extract. I think it's got a better texture, looks better after cooking for so long, and seems to be an even starchier variety of rice...it comes out even CREAMIER in the end with these changes.

For those who are finding the pudding soupy or having difficulty with it setting up, the eggs need to cook, but not curdle.  If you remove the pudding before it has thickened it will not thicken much more upon cooling.  You need to let the eggs do their thing before taking it off the heat.  :)

Followed recipe exactly & it never firmed up. It is soupy. Must need to cook longer. Going to read more reviews to see what I can try different next time.

Yum!  I used cooked rice, since we had a TON left over from a church function, so I put in more than a cup of rice to start with, and cooked it only about 20 minutes for the first step.  I also used cardamom instead of cinnamon.  My kids started eating this when it was still warm, and I had to stop them to have any left over for breakfast tomorrow!

I give this 5 stars because the method was easy and the results were fabulous. A couple of small changes I made: I had 1% milk, and thought that might make for a thin base. So I used 1 quart of half-and-half and 1 quart of 1%. Also, after reading the reviews, I increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I was SURE to bring the egg/milk/vanilla mixture up to room temp while the rice and milk was simmering, and then before adding the eggs to the rice, I tempered it by adding some of the hot rice mixture to the eggs. If you take those steps, you shouldn't end up with scrambled eggs like some reviewers did. My results were just great.

I also made this in the crockpot.  It was delicious!!  Be sure to add 3/4 tsp. salt when adding rice.  Heated 2 cups heavy cream, and 6 cups 2% milk on high for 30 min in covered crockpot before adding 1-1/4 cups sugar, 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1 cup arborio rice.  Cooked in covered crockpot on high for one hour and then on low for 1-1/2 hours., stirring every 30 minutes.  Beat eggs with 1/4 cup heavy cream, 2 tsp vanilla and 3/4 tsp cinnamon.  Stir in 1/2 cup warm milk and rice mixture, stirring carefully.  Pour back into crockpot and cook covered on low for 15 minutes.  Pour into large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and cool for 45 minutes.  Sprinkle with more cinnamon, if desired, and refrigerate.

wow.  easy if you stir constantly on high heat until boils, then reduce heat so just sides of pan have small bubbles, cover and stir every 5-10 min for an hour.  Use caution when adding eggs.  my mom taught me to take a 1/2 cup and add it to egg mixture while whisking briskly...continue adding more hot mixture in 1/2 cup portions.  you will never have egg hunks.  thank you.  reminds me of watching her cook at the stove and waiting for spoons to lick!!!

Very good recipe for a stove top rice pudding. I followed it exactly. As far as the cooking time goes, I am surprised the recipe states to simmer for exactly one hour. It may take more or less time. Rather than say a time, just know that you need to cook it until it starts to thicken. Some reviewers stated that it will not set up in the frig. I have not had that experience. I simply cook the pudding until it starts to thicken. It finishes setting in the frig. If you cook it too long, it will not be creamy enough.

This was pretty good!  But cooking it for an hour made mine TOOOO thick.  Maybe my flame was too high and it cooked to fast, dunno.  But by the time I added the eggs, it was mondo thick.  Anyway, probably an error on my part.  If it gets that thick next time I make it, I'll thin it with some more milk before whisking the eggs in.  BTW, I tempered the eggs with a cup of the hot rice mixture before adding the eggs to the pot and had no problems with being able to incorporate the eggs into the pudding.

Three cheers for the crock pot version ! I made sure the rice was cooked before I added the eggs - tempered of course. Instead of ground cinnamon, I used ground cardamom, but next time would try whole cardamom pods.  Thank you Bonnie Q for the ingredient list and thank you to the reviewers who suggested using a crock pot. Definitely a keeper - family members had very positive comments.

This recipe was great, however I too had problems getting the pudding to set. After chilling for 8 hours, the pudding had not yet set, and it was soupy. I decided to heat it again in a pan, this time stirring continuously at high heat until the pudding had simmered for another 10-15min. This worked like a charm.

I've tried countless rice pudding recipes (stove-top, baked, etc) and have been hoping this would be "the one". It was very soupy, but I figured after I refrigerated it, it would thicken up as other users stated.  It didn't. I hated the thought of throwing away all that time/money, so I turned the oven on to 350 and put it in there for about 1/2 hour.  Thankfully, it did thicken up to the point where it resembled rice pudding.  Next time I make this I'll cook it a lot longer on the stove.  Otherwise, it's probably the best rice pudding recipe I've found.

Needed a gluten-free dessert for a Christmas Eve dinner. I love rice pudding, and was so excited to find an easy recipe. It was delicious! I ate a coffee mug full of it right after it came off the stove, and it was just as good cold the next day. I used whole milk, and it kept getting a film - I just peeled it away. I'm not sure that you would have the same issue with a lighter milk. Make sure you're whisking the heck out of your rice and milk when you add the eggs so they don't scramble! I can't wait to have an excuse to make this pudding again. Superb!

Very good rice pudding and except for having to babysit the pot so it wouldn't boil over, it was very easy.  Several folks requested the recipe.  I lightened up this recipe by using skim milk and 50-50 sugar and Splenda.  I also added 2 cinnamon sticks to the pot and left them in until it was ready for the eggs.  Instead of letting the pot rest for 10 minutes, I tempered the eggs and returned them to the pot right away and cooked for only about 5 minutes.  I will make this again.

I followed Bobbi's suggestion for the crockpot since I tend to burn milk-based things on the stove. What a winner!! I warmed the milk and sugar, added the rice, and cooked for 6 hours on low, stirring once an hour or so. When it was almost thick enough, I tempered the eggs/milk/vanilla and added them to the crock pot, cooking it all for another 30 minutes or so on low. This is fabulous right from the crock pot!

Just made this tonight. My Cuban friend
loves rice pudding. He said this was wonderful. Easy to prepare, like others I brought the milk, sugar and rice to a boil first and then timed 1 hour but it was actually ready in 45 minutes. I also tempered the eggs to the rice prior to mixing it in, no scrambled eggs here. I also added a cinnamon stick to the mixture while it simmered and a bit more sugar. This will be my keeper rice pudding recipe and I have tried many. Thanks so much for the recipe.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL RECIPE. I USUALLY DOUBLE IT WHEN I MAKE IT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG, EVERYONE ALWAYS TAKES SOME HOME. WHAT I NORMALLY DO IS START MY HOUR WHEN IT STARTS TO BOIL. I USE WHOLE MILK. I COVER AND SIMMER FOR ABOUT 50 MINUTES, GIVING IT AN OCCASIONAL STIL.  MEANWHILE I'VE TAKEN 7 EGGS (1 EXTRA BECAUSE I DOUBLED THE RECIPE) AND BEATEN SLIGHTLY, ADD MY VANILLA, AND FOR THE ADDITIONAL I/2 CUP MILK I INSTEAD USE 1/2 CUP HEAVY WHIPPING CREAM.  THIS REALLY HEIGHTENS THE FLAVORS.  WHEN IT IS TIME TO ADD TO THE PUDDING I FIRST WHISK ABOUT A CUP OF THE HOT MILK INTO THE EGG AND CREAM AND THEN SLOWLY WHISK MIXTURE, WHILE ON LOW HEAT INTO THE PUDDING STIRRING CONSTANTLY FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES.  I LET SET FOR A MINUTE ON SIMMER AND THEN I STIR IN ABOUT A 1/2 CUP OF BAKING RAISINS.  THIS RECIPE DOES FIRM UP AND GET THICKER AS IT COOLS.

I have never made rice pudding and for some reason I had the biggest craving tonight.  So I tried this recipe...Never again will I buy the Kozy rice pudding or order it at the diner down the street!  This was by FAR the absolute BEST rice pudding I have ever tried!  It was simple to make and nice and creamy.  I used brown rice so it took an extra 30 minutes to cook, but when it was done...my boyfriend and I jut licked the pot clean!  We couldnt even wait the 8 hours until it was done settling!  It's delicious and makes a LOT of pudding.  I intend on bringing this to Thanksgiving this year, and making it for my kids when I someday have them! :)  Thanks for this amazing recipe!

I have looked for a good recipe for rice pudding for years.  I have collected many over the years --- and this is the BEST of them all.  I may stop looking at this point. My attempt at this recipe came out perfectly the first time. I would make no suggestions or alterations other than being mindful of keeping the cooking temperature quite low and extending the cooking time to 80 minutes.

I had no problems making this recipe.  I substitued heavy whipping cream for the 1/4 c. milk that was added to the eggs.  You have to make sure to use whole milk and only cook for 5 minutes max. after you add the eggs.  This will thicken alot after it cools.  I also used arborio rice which is much better than a long grain rice. It was excellent!

This was relativley easy and it was the recipie that I've been waiting for!  THe worst part was waiting to eat it.  I substituted some light cream for some of the milk and the result was an ultra creamy rice pudding.  I also added 3/4 cup raisins.  This is just great!

This is a good base recipe that can be ajusted according to personal taste and or dietary needs. I used non fat milk and splenda so that this fit my eating plan. I am not an experienced pudding maker myself, so this has been a learning experience. For me, the third time has been the charm. I used the crockpot method and cooked it on high. The first batch I made came out overcooked and like paste...my bad. I went by other reviewers advise and cooked it for 2 hrs and another 20 after adding the egg mixture...too long. The second batch I cooked for 1 hr 45 min and turned it off after adding the egg mixture. I also added more splenda and some nutmeg and raisins and substituted a cinnamon stick in the milk mixture rather than sprinkling ground cinnamon on top. Much better, but still a bit overcooked for me. The third batch has been the best so far. I again bumped up the splenda slightly and cooked it  1 hr and 30 min and turned it off after the egg mixture was added. This batch was the creamiest and the best tasting so far. Let me just say that contradictory to other reviewers advise,the mixture definitely does thicken up after the egg mixture has been added and even more after it chills and sets up. So, cook it  untill it is almost, but not quite as thick as you want it before adding the egg mixture and avoid the paste experience...lol! Also do temper the egg mixture before adding it to the hot pudding so your eggs dont scramble. the nutmeg  and raisins are a great addition!

Perfect!  Mine was a little loose - I cooked it for way over an hour and then had to leave the house, so I finished it off.  Next time I make it (and I WILL make this a lot I am sure) I will take the advise of another who recommended taking the 1/4 cup of milk out of the 1/2 gallon, rather than using 1/2 gallon plus 1/4 cup.  I think this might have made the difference in the amount if time it took to thicken it up.  Otherwise - it was WONDERFUL

I made the recipe just as written and I'm very pleased with the results.  It was very creamy (I used 2% milk).  It was great for dessert and I added fresh fruit and nuts for breakfast.  I will save this recipe as my favorite rice pudding.

I just made this tonight and it is wonderful!  I cooked it a little longer, maybe an hour and 15mins... just until it looked thick and creamy.  I used 1% milk and it worked just fine.  It has thickened up a bit for me since I put it in the fridge, but not too much.  Overall, VERY good!

Im currently making this recipe..I really thought it would be way too liquidy but it turned out fine. USE THE CROCK POT. I put it on the stove at first but it wouldnt stop leaking out of the effin pot.. So yeah, Crock-pot for like 2 hours. I also added an egg and lots of sugar, Let the egg mixture stay at room temperature while the pudding is boiling. I wont wait 8 hours to eat it..way too long haha.

I don't care for rice pudding but my boyfriend loves it, so I got inspired to make some with what I had on hand. I used half a gal. of Silk brand vanilla coconut milk, Mahatma jasmine rice and subbed half and half for the milk in the egg mixture, and two eggs. Took a bit longer to thicken to my liking but he said it was phenomenal!!! I tried some and it was pretty good, even I would eat this version. Highly recommended, I will make this again probably often judging by my man's reaction. He ate two bowls!

I was looking for a gluten free, dairy free, soy free dessert to make for my daughter who was just recently diagnosed with these food intolerances.  In this recipe I substituted coconut milk & dairy free butter.  The entire family loved it and none of them knew it wasn't just a regular dessert. Of course they got the idea to top it with fresh whipped cream.  It did take close to 2 hours to cook and based on other reviews, I did make sure it was thick before I stopped cooking it!  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic! followed the directions- tasted  incredibly creamy- someone mentioned a recurring skin while cooking.  This won't happen if you keep it covered as the directions mention.  Anyway- everyone loved it, I loved it.  I will be making this over and over! Thank you!

My eight-year-old absolutely loves this rice pudding!!  It is time consuming, but not difficult to make.   I generally substitute half-and-half for a quarter of the milk, and always use whole milk.   It comes out very creamy and delicious.  I put it in small containers for my daughter to take to school - a lot healthier than prepackaged school snacks full of trans fat!

Followed exact recipe and came up with rice milk and no 'setting'.  I went back to the stove and re-heated almost to a boil until eggs thickened the rice pudding. Excellent taste. Nice recipe but a little vague on the temperatures needed to cook everything. So if your pudding didn't set, and you followed the recipe just put it back on the stove and reheat it until the eggs cook and the pudding thickens.

Thanks to the person that mentioned Wilmington Delaware.  I have been searching for a recipe that that I got from a Wilmington paper.  I couldn't remember all the ingredients. so I combined what I did remember like using half-n-half for 1/2 the milk, putting in 2 cinnamon sticks during the simmer and of course adding raisins.  After tasing I figured out that I must have used 2 eggs instead of 3 because this recipe has more of a custard taste than I remember so I plan to cut the eggs to 2 next time.  And there will be a next time....this recipe is delicious and is as good or better than that restaurant recipe I lost!!!!!

Poorly written directions made tasty and easy by all of the helpful comments. Read the comments before you try this recipe. I used 2% milk in this recipe and thought that 8 cups of milk was a lot at first. It turned out that the ingredients are in good quantities as is. Make sure you start out your milk at *medium/medium high* and get it up to a bit of a *boil* and then turn it back down to simmer at medium-low temperature. If not, your rice won't cook in the hour and you'll need to cook it longer. Pouring some of the rice mixture into the eggs and stirring before adding seemed to work for me (this prevents curdling of the eggs I am guessing). Also, there was a comment about the rice pudding not thickening after being taken off of the stove. *Mine definitely did thicken* and especially it thickened after refrigeration. I will probably cook it slightly less next time and half the recipe. It was way more than two people can eat :|.

This rice pudding is soooo good!  The flavors remind me of childhood.  As other members have reviewed, the pudding does not get thicker once cooking is done, so make sure it is as thick as you like before you remove it from heat.

**************** a million stars!!!  Mistakes, Crock-pot and Eggnog = Yummy goodness!!!! Ok So I did a little changes (mostly by mistake) and it turned out soooo good!  I put SKIM milk (bought out of habit), rice, and the sugar in the crock-pot for about 4 hours on high.  I realized that the skim milk was not thickening and I added about 1 cup of eggnog (the real kind).  I stirred it and let it sit on high for about another hour.  When I thought it was getting thick enough I added the 3 eggs, salt and vanilla- I didn't add in anymore milk because I had added the eggnog before.  I stirred it in and kept randomly stirring for 20 min.  on high.  SOOOOOO good I myself said forget the diet and had 4 gigantic servings.   We all loved it HOT with cinnamon (even my picky sister in-law)  :-)  YUMMY!!!!!!!!

I agree you need to cook it more than 60 min.  It takes 80-90 min.  The amount of milk does seem like a lot but it is the perfect amount.  My husband loved it.  Said it was just like his momma made.

This replaces any rice pudding recipe I have!  I only made 6 servings for the first time and it turned out wonderful.  I did use 2 cups light cream and 2 cups milk though.  It came out so creamy and rich.  I had to cook it longer than 2 minutes at the end.  I cooked it for about 30 minutes.  It sets a little more overnight in the fridge.  Cook until desired thickness.  Well worth the time to make!

My daughter had to make a traditional Spanish dish for her Spanish class.  She chose to make "Arroz con Leche" (rice pudding). This recipe looked easy (it was).  We made it twice - the first time according to the directions - the rice was a little firm and the pudding a little thin, but it tasted great.  The second time, at the suggestion of several other reviewers,  we brought the milk/sugar/rice mixture to a boil,then reduced the heat and started the one hour cooking time - perfect results!  She got an A on her project and there wasn't a spoonful of pudding left.  This recipe is a keeper!

I MADE THIS RECIPE FOR MY DAD, TRYING TO RECAPTURE A TASTE FROM CHILDHOOD...A FOND LOVER OF A GOOD RICE PUDDING !  THE FIRST TIME I MADE IT, IT WAS A FLOP. THE COOKING TIME WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND I ASSUMED IT WOULD THICKEN UP ALOT MORE UPON STANDING.  HOWEVER, I DID TRY IT AGAIN...COOKING IT VERY MUCH LONGER THAN THE RECIPES CALLS FOR UNTIL VERY THICK.  IT TURNED OUT AWESOME AND I HAVE BEEN MAKING IT WEEKLY SINCE THEN.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

EXCELLENT!!!!  I have tried many different rice pudding recipes, which all ended up being super thick globs at the end...without that ultra-creamy "pudding-like" consistency.  THIS is finally the recipe I've been searching for. I believe the real secret to the creaminess of this recipe is the LARGE amount of milk it calls for (since rice continues to absorb like a sponge as it cooks), as well as the lengthy time it requires to cook on the stovetop (to allow the rice to become super-saturated with milk so that it doesn't continue to absorb more liquid later). The results are so worth the time! I use whole milk. The "1 cup" of rice doesn't seem like it'll be enough, but you'll be surprised how much it'll expand during cooking. The longer you cook it, the thicker it'll become. I've had several requests for the recipe & keep hearing "it tastes just like my grandma's rice pudding"! Thank you, Bonnie.

Absolutely delicious and perfect rice pudding. I used 1% milk for the half gallon and then used cream for the 1/4 cup that the recipe says to mix with the eggs. I substituted Splenda for all of the sugar with fantastic results. I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and freshly grated nutmeg. It is the best rice pudding ever!

I have been looking for the perfect "diner" style rice pudding recipe for months.  I found it with this one.  Moist and creamy, it was well worth the cooking time.  The hardest part was waiting overnight before eating it!

I would give the recipe itself five stars as it tastes wonderful, but the written directions one star, as if you follow them you will wind up with what my husband referred to as "a tasty rice pudding drink".  I would revise the written directions as follows:

1.  In a large saucepan, combine 1/2 gallon milk, sugar and rice. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to low.  Simmer, covered, 1 hour, stirring frequently. Remove pan from heat and let rest 10 minutes.

2.  In a small bowl, combine eggs, 1/4 cup milk, salt and vanilla. Stir into rice mixture and return pot to low heat, stirring constantly, for at least 2 minutes or until pudding reaches them desired consistency. Pour into a 9x13 inch dish and cover with plastic wrap, folding back the corners to allow the steam to escape.

The third step was fine as written.  The second time I made the recipe, I modified it slightly by taking the 1/4 cup of milk for the second step from the original half gallon and adding a fourth egg to make the recipe just a bit thicker and richer.  The pudding is really delicious, but following the original instructions as written won't result in a thick pudding as it does not thicken on cooling.  A few slight changes and this is a five-star recipe!

Guaranteed you will enjoy this recipe! This is basically my mother's recipe, doubled.  We've had it in our family for over 50 years and it's terrific.

In our family we would use 4 egg yolks (not the whole egg), and we add the yolks with sugar and a small amount of cooked milk mixture.  That way, the egg gets used to the warmth of the mixture without cooking.  Mom always used 2% but I use 1% milk - tasty either way.

Glad to read that some of you cooked it in the slow cooker, I'm doing that next time (read: next week)!

Unfortunately I have to agree with the more negative reviews of this recipe because following the directions doesn't result in the correct result.  

To salvage the dish, I put it back in the pot after 8 hrs. in the refrigerator and ending up with rice soup. I added more sugar and cooked it for another 10-15 min. on medium high heat stirring constantly. As it began to boil it also began to thicken as it should have the first time. I then followed the directions again...and while it's been put back in the refrigerator (once again!) it seems like it will work out this time. Of course time will tell.

I gave the recipe 2 stars, by the way, because it does taste good. It's just the directions need a lot of improvement.

This recipe was very easy though time consuming.  Delicious and fool proof.  When you are done the steps prior to refrigeration I thought it would appear thicker and more pudding like. I thought I did it wrong but no -- after refrigerating overnight it was perfect.  Love Iran's will be making again - maybe with some raisins .

Wow - that was delicious!  I couldn't stop eating it hot before I put it in the fridge.  :o)  I used calrose rice and mixed lots of cinnamon in it when I added the egg mixture.  It's a keeper!

I love rice pudding and wanted to try this based on the reviews.  Cooked it according to the recipe, it had a nice taste but a little too thick/dense and not creamy enough for my preference.

Pudding never firmed up.  It is more like Creme Anglaise with boiled rice.  I followed the recipe and suggestions but this is a fail.  I've been cooking for 40 years and know how to measure and follow directions.

Very nice rice pudding recipe.  It takes a little attention since you don't want to leave it unattended on the stove, but its definitely worth the effort. I followed the recipe exactly as written and the pudding turned out perfectly.

When I read that it was like "he used to get at diner when he was a kid", I had to try it. My husband absolutely agreed. Best I have ever made, and have not any complaints before. Only problem-hubby didn't get chance to try it till 2 days later and I had eaten half myself before that! Now I have to  make again. I was a little short on milk, so only used about 1 1/2 qts, probably had temp a little too low, so it took a little longer than an hour to thicken as desired-but results were sooo worth it. This is the only way I will make rice pudding from now on. Have now made a second time, this time I kept heat on "2" instead of low-which gave me VERY low boil instead of a simmer. Cooking time was now perfect. Anyone who had "rice soup" probably needed to cook a bit longer and/or just SLIGHTLY higher temp. It does seem to lose some of the sweet after it sets up a few hours-which was fine. Also, if ends up too thick-just add touch of half and half till desired thickness.(milk would work too, but half and half tastes better)

Wow, really disappointed in this one.  Took twice as long to cook as stated to get it any thicker than rice soup.  Finally got it there and added the egg mixture which loosened it back up.  Smelled great cooking and probably tastes good, but this recipe is WAAAAY too much time and work for what it is.

I misread the amount of milk called for the first time I made this, and have been making it "wrong" ever since--we love it!!!  I use 1 quart of 1/2 and 1/2 (instead of 1/2 gallon of milk).  I then simmer for an hour, as the recipe states.  Then I mix 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 with 2 Tblsp. melted butter, 2 tsp. vanilla and the salt and mix into the rice pudding, letting it simmer for 2 more minutes.  After it has cooled according to the recipe, I sprinkle the pudding with cinnamon and raw sugar.  Then I broil it until the sugar caramelizes.  Then I wrap it and refrigerate overnight.  It is the best of the best!!!!

Bah!  So Good!  I stuck this in a crock pot and cooked it on high for a little over 3 hours.  I made the mistake of not tempering my egg mixture before sticking it in... so I ended up with a little bit of scramblage.  But it was still SO good.  I also sprinkled nutmeg on top.

When you get it right, the taste is amazing! The egg mixture MUST be tempered in to prevent scrambling. The first time I made it, I used skim milk and it was so thick and creamy...the second time I used 2% and it never set up, as other reviewers noted. I'm pretty sure I cooked it at a higher temperature the first time, so that's what I plan to do next time. I "fixed" the second batch by pouring it back into the pan and boiling it, stirring constantly, for about 20 minutes...the problem then was that the rice was over-cooked and the texture of the pudding was not a good one...Someone needs to make some serious changes to the directions of this recipe. There is no reason it should come out so different when you are using the exact same ingredients. It makes me not want to make it again, although I will, because when it does turn out, it's amazing.

Huge hit at our Halloween party tonight!  I went along with previous reviews and added an extra egg, but I also substituted that 1/4 cup of milk for heavy cream and added 1/2 a stick of butter.  For an extra layer of flavor, I also tossed in a thumb's length of peeled fresh ginger root (whole, not chopped or grated) and let it simmer in the milk for the first 30 minutes, then removed it.  Very nice, but suble, bit of kick that went well with something perfectly sweet and creamy.  Also, had to make this twice b/c the first time I didn't temper the egg mixture before adding to the whole pot and ended up with chunkies...NOT good eats!  Temper, temper, temper!!!  Hope you love it as much as my friends and family did.

This is a very good recipe, but I think I prefer it without the egg (could be because I grew up on Indian rice pudding, which doesn't have eggs). Hubby likes it with vanilla and cinnamon.  I like the Indian flavors of cardamom and golden raisins.  Either way, it's yummy.

Good stuff! I made mine in my Le Creuset french oven(enameled cast iron pot) and there was no problem with sticking or burning.  It took an hour after I brought it to a simmer to bring it to the proper consistency.  Made mine with 4 eggs per other reviewers' suggestion and it was perfect.  Used jasmine rice and 1/2% milk.  Served slightly warm and will add a little whipped cream on top next time.

This is the first time I made rice pudding and it is fantastic! I doubled the recipe as I had a full gallon milk that was nearing its expiration date. I took the advice of other reviews and added an extra egg and an additional 1/3 cup of sugar for each 1/2 gallon. (2/3 total). I brought the milk and sugar to a simmer before adding the rice and began timing my hour when the rice-milk-sugar came to a boil.  Meanwhile, the eggs, etc. were on the counter coming to room temperature. I also tempered the eggs as suggested in lieu of allowing the rice mixture to rest.  I loved this warm and my family couldn't get enough!

HELP! This is the closest to Kozy Shack I have found!  But I'm doing something wrong lol The first time I  made it I only had brown rice and after 7 hrs. the rice was still hard, I must have added another 1/2 gal. of milk and gave up.  The second time, I tried the crock pot, as other did, but by the time I got the consistancy right it was like paste....the rice had totally disolved!  I did use long grain white rice.  The taste was great but not the consistency.  Any help??? I really want to get this right so I can quit my addiction to Kozy Shack lol

I've made this recipe for three years now, still the best rice pudding ever. I cook for about half an hour longer and add a bit more vanilla to it. I get so many compliments, it really is the "perfect" rice pudding.

This recipe turns out every time.  A bit more time consuming than some other stove top recipes on the site, but it is definitely creamy and it does surprisingly taste similar to KozyShack.  I don't typically keep whole milk on hand, but I always get some when I know I'll be making this treat to make it that much creamier.  Sooo good!

Creamiest describes it. Filling, yet not fatteningly filling.  Used skim milk successfully.  Added four eggs as another user mentioned.

I made this yesterday and it is the BEST!
I used some tips posted by Bobbi on 12/15/06, since I wanted to use my crock pot. I put the milk and sugar in the crock pot and waited till this mixture was warm before adding the rice. I cooked on High until it reached the desired consistency, about 3 hours. 

I mixed the eggs, vanilla, salt, and ground cinnamon. Then I added some of the rice mixture to the egg mixture, very slowly to temper. Once the temp had been brought up, I added the egg mixture to the crock pot and cooked on low for 20 minutes. 

Again, great recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

June

The flavor was pretty good but it was too custardy for me.  I tasted it after it had cooked but before adding the eggs and it was just delicious.  Next time I think I'll try one less egg to see if that makes a difference.

I must be dense because I've tried this twice and while the taste is great, it's rice milk, not pudding.

I can't get it to set up...at all.

From all the fantastic reviews, I have to "out" myself as a hack in the kitchen. No clue on this recipe, which I'd like to share with my daughters.

Might try to suck it up and try one more time.

DON'T start your one hour of cooking time until AFTER the mixture begins boiling. I stayed with the recipe given and it turned out perfect and very flavorful. By the way, I used Splenda instead of white sugar and it still turned out perfect. Thank you for taking the time to add your rice pudding recipe to Allrecipes.com!

This is probably the fifth rice pudding recipe I've tried, and it's hands down the best. The first time I made it, the rice didn't soften as much as I wanted it to, so the second time, I cooked it with 2 cups of water, and just reduced the amount of milk by the 2 cups. It took a lot longer than the recipe cooking time, closer to 3 hours total, but it was definitely worth it. 

I agree with the commenters before me who suggested adding a little of the pudding mixture to the egg mixture to bring it up to temp before adding it, and who said that it does not thicken as it cools. Leave it on the stove until it thickens to the desired consistency, and it's just as good warm as it is cold. 

This pudding did not curdle, like most of the recipes I've tried, and it comes out fantastic- creamy, smooth, not too eggy- the perfect rice pudding!

I just made this recipe for the first time today.(first time making rice pudding ever!!)OH MY GOD!!!!  To die for!!!  So simple to make.  Just make sure you bring the rice mixture with the milk and sugar to a full boil first, then bring it down to a simmer for an hour.  Tempered the egg mixture first(put some of the rice mixture in the bowl with the eggs and mixed well) before putting it in the pot of rice mixture.  Came out perfect!!!  The kids tasted it and so did hubby, and they were very impressed!!!  Can't wait till it's chilled so i can have some!!  (tastes great warm too!!!)  This is definetely a keeper and one you'll probably have to make several copies of to give out!!!

I have never made rice pudding before and this one was very easy.  I was so glad to have all the reviews to help me make it.  Thanks.

I cut recipe to 6 servings.
I used 2 c of whole milk and 2 cups of 2% milk.  It did take about an hour after it came to a simmer and I did temper the eggs before adding them to the rice.  Then I had them on the stove about 7  minutes once I added the eggs and the consistancy is wonderful. 
Thank you for such a great, wasy recipe.

It was delicious -  for rice swimming around in milk.  The recipe calls for 1/2 gallon of milk which is definitely  incorrect.  It is far too much milk, then an extra 1/2 cup of milk is added later.  It was very good though, but the increments need to be adjusted.

This is the best rice pudding I ever made.  I used 1% milk and egg beaters.  The secret is to cook it until it is thick (slightly over 1 hour).  No one can believe how rich and creamy it is and tastes great.

Great tasting, but it definitely takes longer than this recipe said. Before the 1 hour of simmering, you need to bring the mixture to a boil on medium-low, stirring every 5 minutes or so. This alone took about 45 minutes. By the time I was done making it, it was so late that I just put it in the fridge w/out letting it get to room temperature. It tastes great, but it's a LOT of work. I used skim milk and it still turned out thick and creamy. Next time I'll probably add raisins before letting it sit over night.

This is very good. I did make the mistake of not bringing it back to a boil after adding the egg which does thicken it up. I did this the next day and still was great

This is it!  I have been looking for ages for a recipe this good for creamy rice pudding. Taste and texture are perfect. Even before it sets in the fridge it is excellent.  Thanks!  Note that I converted the recipe to 4 servings and it cut down on the cooking time.

I followed this recipe almost to the tee!! I used one reviewers suggestion which was to cook the pudding 80 minutes instead of one hour! It made a huge difference in the thickness I preferred for my pudding. Otherwise, everything else I followed as written!

This recipe was the ultimate! I had rice pudding years ago and quite frankly it was horrible. So I was a little apprehensive to give this a try. I am so glad I did. I served this at our Ladies Tea, and the crowd loved it. 
The only things I changed in my final recipe was the eggs. Instead of whole eggs, I used just the yoke. I also increased the yokes to 4. It came out very rich tasting. Yum Yum!!
I did increase the cooking time to about and Hour and 20 minutes. 
I would add that using real cinnamon (Ceylon) makes it tops!
Thank you BONNIE Q. for such a great recipe!!

Dee-licious!  Relying on advice from prior reviewers, I cooked my rice until it became "thick" not runny.  Took about 1 hour 20 minutes after the beginning of simmer, and I tempered my egg mixture.  From there, followed the recipe, except added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the pot, and scooped the pudding into individual dessert cups.  Also, for the last few dessert cups, I stirred in a few drops of orange blossom water as an experiment.  The few drops of orange gave the pudding a heavenly depth the plain ones lacked, but after one night in the refrigerator, both the plain and orange scented were out of this world!  I thank the prior reviewers for the excellent cooking tips.  My guests said the rice pudding was as good as the one from our local 5-star French restaurant.

My husband Daniel makes this rice pudding at least once per month. Since there is just the 2 of us since our 4 girls have moved on, he makes a half recipe. The pudding is freaking outstanding!!!  Daniel adjusts the recipe slightly by adding another bit of REAL vanilla and kicking up the cinnamon a bit.  If you love creamy rice pudding, this is the recipe for you.  ENJOY

Have made this 3 times. First time as directed, Second time with 1% milk and erythritol (sugar alcohol), Third time with 1% milk and stevia. Surprisingly, the best taste and consistency was with the 1% milk and the erythritol. Also, I put the pudding in individual dishes (ramiken-type; portion control!) to which I first sprinkle cinnamon on the bottom before adding the pudding. Adds a surprise when eating.

Great recipe. I halved it since I am the only one in the house who likes rice pudding. Next time I will reduce the sugar a bit and probably add another egg. Can't wait to make this again.

Absolutely the best rice pudding I've ever made!  I took all ingredients out of fridge when starting recipe to get them at room temp. I brought the mixture up to bubbling over med heat, stirring often. Then covered and simmered on low for about 40 more mins. Stirring often so it wouldn't boil over.  I used 2% milk, so I added a couple of tbsp butter at this point. I let it cool for 10 mins. Then I slowly added a couple of scoops of hot rice mix into bowl with egg mixture. Then slowly stirred it into pot. Brought it back to heat and let it bubble for about 5 mins to make sure egg was cooked. It was thick and creamy and delish!

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe except I used 4 eggs and tempered the egg mixture to be on the safe side.  I also followed Angela Cinaglia's suggestions to the "T". Thickening happens only after the egg mixture is added. This was perfect.

I've made this several times now and it's always turned out perfect!  I still bring the milk & sugar almost to a boil before I add the rice.  Once I add the egg mixture I stir it constantly until the desired consistency.    
I really need to double this recipe because it doesn't last very long in our house with 3 people.  I think the next time I make this I will make 1 on the stove and 1 in the crockpot.

I have always thought the best rice pudding was made on top of the stove with raw rice and this recipe so proves me right. The timing was perfect. The rice pudding was perfect. My only advice is to keep an eye on it while cooking as it will boil over quickly. I will be making this recipe many more times. Thank you Bonnie Q for a great recipe.

I am really impressed with this recipe. The finished pudding is very much similar to the deli style rice pudding I used to relish at the New York Jewish delis. I say that anyone who had problems with this thickening needed to cook longer with the egg addition before removing from the heat.

 I did add 1 extra egg and increased the second milk amount to 1/2 a cup and I used half & half. I skipped the 10 minute resting period by tempering the egg mix first before adding it to the pot. In a mixing bowl mix your eggs, salt and milk thoughly, then ladle in a small amount of hot rice/milk mixture from the pot while stirring constantly, add several more ladles of hot milk to the eggs slowly to bring the eggs to a warm to the touch temperature, then stir the whole mixture back into the hot pot and continue with the recipe, cooking until you reach a thick pudding before removing from heat. I only did this because I didn't want to wait the 10 minute resting period and cool off the stove, so that is just impatience on my part. I cooked professionally for 20 years and I know a lot of tricks.

I added the vanilla at the end, poured into my dish that I had scattered raisins on the bottom of first. Wrap and cool, then chill after sprinkling with cinnamon and covering with fresh wrap.

I am going to try extra long rice next time to see if that will make a more chunkier rice in the finished product. And if you like a sweeter pudding maybe add a 1/4 cup more sugar.

Yum!  I made some adjustments following other reviewers recommendations (increased cooking time to 80-minutes, tempered the egg mixture before adding to pudding).  I also used whole mile to cook the rice, but used heavy cream in the egg mixture.  Yum!

I have not had rice pudding since I was little girl. My mother used to make it for me and my siblings, but for the life of her when I asked her for the recipe she can't remember how she used to make it. I saw the star rating and read the reviews, so I was excited to try it. Might I say...... WOW! This was perfect. The taste was exactly what I remembered as a child. Thank you so much for sharing it. I will keep this on hand. I used whole milk to make it the creamiest it could be and I also added a cup of raisins as that was my favorite in my mothers. I followed a previous review and added the extra half cup of sugar and made it in a crock pot for 3 hours stirring very rarely, so it took out the worry of watching it consistently. Turned out amazing. Warm the milk and sugar before adding the rice. Cook on high. Add the egg mixture and raisins after the 3 hours are up. It was good warm and cold.

Delicious and definitely worth the time!!!  I've made this a few times now, and it's always well received.  I've modified it to make it sugar free and gluten free by substituting xylitol for the sugar and using GF all-purpose flour.  I also used 1% milk and egg substitute and it came out great.  My latest experiment was to add orange zest and orange flavored cranberries, and it was oh, so good.  This is definitely a keeper - thanks Bonnie Q.!

It's sooooo worth the time!  Creamy and wonderful warm or cold.

I get the milk and sugar boiling before adding the rice, once boiling again I start the hour simmer.  I did cheat a bit and substituted 1/4 cream for the 1/4 cup milk at the end.

I made this in the crockpot as suggested by some reviews, and it turned out beautifully!  At eight months pregnant I was craving rice pudding and this was perfect!  My husband and kids added raisins, and instead of sprinkling cinnamon on the top, I simply added two sticks while it was simmering.  Thank you for the recipe!

My dad loves rice pudding so I thought I would give this a try but I only had 2 eggs to add to the cooked rice/milk mixture.  It was just after the holidays so I used the 2 eggs plus 1/2 cup of leftover eggnog instead of the 3 eggs and 1/4 cup milk.  Delicious!

To my tastes, this is the perfect, stirred rice pudding. I make it with an arborio or risotto type rice, which makes the pudding extra creamy and thick due to the higher starch content in the rice. When this dessert is in the refrigerator, it calls to us and has to be rationed or else it would too quickly disappear.

As is, this is delicious, and well worth the wait.  I have made this many times with the recipe as written, and it's the basic rice pudding recipe I'll use forever.

Just made a slightly different version with is quite delicious.  I replaced the 1/4 cup of milk with light coconut milk, and added to the egg/milk mixture: 1/4 tsp ground cardamom and about a cup of unsweetened flaked coconut.  

Optional: eat when warm with a little bit of spiced rum mixed in (for adults only, of course), which is lovely.

I did use milk before but it didn't turn out as good but it was still edible. Lastnight I decided to make this recipe but with half and half. It turned out amazing, everyone loved it and there is none left. I'm going to keep this recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as instructed, and felt disappointed -- creamy is good; runny is not so good.  And this was runny.  However, the flavor is delicious.  I think next time, I will decrease the amount of milk by 1/2 cup to 1 cup and increase the sugar by 2-3 tbsp (as my husband said, the sweet factor was "on the edge").  It's definitely worth fiddling with the recipe to get it to your liking, because it is wonderfully creamy and delicious.

Deeelicious! This is the best rice pudding recipe I've tried. It actually taste better than the one we buy at a local restaurant. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it came out perfect! We also thought it was just the right amount of sweetness for us, no need to add an extra 1/2 c. of sugar or so but, of course it's all a matter of preference. I used 2% milk, added cinnamon and raisins on top when it was done, refrigerated overnight and it was SOOO good! We finished the whole batch within the same day and my bf is already requesting for me to make it again! Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Excellent recipe.  I used skim milk and it turned out great.  For those who added extra sugar, I don't understand...I actually thought the pudding was a little on the sweet side and thinking of cutting it back the next time I make it.

Love this recipe! The only change I made was instead of adding ground cinnamon, I added a cinnamon stick to it at the beginning.  When it was done, I removed the cinnamon stick.

I LOVE rice pudding!  This is an excellent and creamy rice pudding.  I followed some of the other suggestions and increased the sugar by 1/3 cup.  I also added about 1c of raisins when cooking the rice.  I cooked covered on the stove top for about an hour and then because it had not thickened as much as I like I removed the lid turned up the heat a bit and cooked for an additional 20 min or so stirring very often.  I tempered the egg mixture before adding and substituted nutmeg for cinnamon (my personal preference) I used some heavy cream and whole milk.   

Even though I have a recipie I love I would definately make this again, next time I am going to try the crock pot as suggested and also add a dollop of butter right at the end.

I cut the recipe in half.  I used skim milk and added some raisins before letting it set.  The only thing I would do different next time is to cut out some of the sugar as it was way too sweet for me.

UPDATE I had to change my rating because I made this rice pudding a 2nd time with half the amount of sugar and it is PERFECT!  I still used skim milk and raisins.  I dont think I'll ever try another recipe!  This ones a keeper!

Made this for the 1st time last week when we were snowed in and I only wish that I hadn't cut the recipe in fast because it was SO good! Whole family loved it. I'm making it again today, but trying with brown basmati instead and may add a touch of coriander. Though maybe I shouldn't mess with perfection...
Thanks for posting this! It's a keeper.

I'm not sure if I made this improperly, or if the recipe is just off, but I wasn't a big fan.  My husband didn't care for it either.  It just kind of tasted like rice with milk and sugar, and we tossed most of the batch.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I used whole milk and simmered for 70 minutes. It would have been fine at 60 minutes but I wanted it a little thicker. Also, I followed the advice from other reviews and let the egg mixture sit at room temperature while the rice was cooking.  Cinnamon and raisins were added at the end before chilling. Thanks for a great recipe!

Worth each of the 10 times I had to go check on it while it was cooking.  I halved the recipe but ended up using 3 eggs (I like thick pudding).  Tempered the egg mixture very carefully.  I actually ended up cooking it for waay more than 2 minutes after returning to low heat and had to also increase the heat, pretty much bringing it to a boil again, to get the desired thickness (probably about 10-12 minutes on heat after adding the eggs).  Flavor was perfect as written, no need for additional sugar or flavoring.  Tastes great plain or with cinnamon, hot or cold; very versatile, I'm thinking it would make an amazing pastry filling...

I made this as written except I used 1 1/2 cups sugar and only 2 eggs. It was perfect, creamy,thick,sweet and DELICIOUS. My husband said he likes it, and hes PICKY. This was my first time making rice pudding, I was intimidated for some reason, but now I know its EASY, just follow the directions and it will be perfect. Thanks for an awesome recipe

Mmmmmm, I am eating my third bowl right now.  This is sooo yummy.  I wanted to use up some leftover rice so I tried my own little experiment.  I added 3 cups of cooked rice to the warm milk and sugar in my slow cooker and let it go for three hours.  I thought perhaps there would be a lackof starch to thicken it properly and I was right.  So I added approximately 1/4 c of cornstarch dissolved in a bit of milk (didn't measure cornstarch or milk) and let that cook a few minutes.  That thickened it up nicely so I added my eggs, salt, vanilla and cinnamon ( and decided to throw in some freshly grated nutmeg, because that can't be wrong).  I left out the 1/4 c milk because I had already added some with my cornstarch.  Let that cook for the 20 minutes and then we dug in!!  Very very good.  This one will be enjoyed time and again.

This recipe did not work for me.  I did not substitute ingredients, but prepared it as written, and it never set.  After 15 hours in the refrigerator, it was still soupy. I was so disappointed!

Yes-- stove top is the way to go..I used only a 1/4 cup of sugar and added raisins.Stirring is essential but even when I get side-tracked, this still turns out well(if it is too dry I add an extra egg)..comfort food..yummm

This really turned out well. I wanted to see how low calorie I could make this and have it still taste good, so I subbed the following: unsweetened almond milk for the milk, splenda for the sugar, and egg whites for the egg. I used some basmati rice and left out the cinnamon. This thickened up nicely and tasted really quite good. I made half the recipe and got four very large servings for 88 calories each! I do think next time I may bump up the Splenda just a bit, but otherwise, this is a keeper. MUCH cheaper to make this than buy those little rice pudding cups in the grocery store

Am I the only one who made this because I opened the wrong gallon of milk first and the other one went way past its expiration date? Really, I love this recipe. Needed a way to not throw away milk and found a gem instead. High altitude, so I decided to follow the recommendation to use 4 eggs. Will boil milk first next time and probably simmer for the full 1 hr 15min - 1 hr 30 min. This is great!

This is the first time I have ever made rice pudding and I really wasn't sure what it was supposed to taste or look like.  My husband has been asking me to make it for some time.  I thought it was very good as is but a little bit sweet.  My husband thought it was good - but, not what he was used to growing up.  He thought it was too sweet and not enough "custard" as compared to the rice.  I will say many reviews said cook it longer if you like it thicker because once you take it off the stove and cool it - it won't get any thicker.  Mine actually did.  I thought it looked "soupy" so I cooked it longer but, once I cooled it in the fridge it did thicken up more.  I will definitely make this again because the taste was very rich and creamy. I will just use a little less sugar and not cook it quite as long so it is more "saucy".  Great recipe - just adjust to your taste.

I have made this in vairous combinations: 1/2 milk/hvy whipping cream, 1/2 coconut milk/milk, and 8 cups heavy whipping cream.  My daughter loved it with the coconut milk and my favorite was with the 8 cups of heavy whipping cream. I had never had rice pudding b4 but the reviews were so great I wanted to try it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

If I could give more than 5 stars I would.  This recipe is fantastic.  I did cook it longer like others suggested and to be honest I might have over cooked it but it was great anyways.  All I can say is I doubt that it could be improved.  I would like to put a stick of cinnamon in it just to see... Thank you so much Bonnie!

This dish is excellent but i made a couple (personal)small changes, I added some coconut milk to the regular milk for mor flavor and i decorated it with coconut flakes on top of the cinnamon just for it added a nice flavor.

I recommend everyone to try this. Is delicious.

Excellent recipe.  I used white basmati rice.  Cooked covered at very low temperature, stirring every 10 minutes until thickened, then more frequently.  Cooked until almost stiff before adding egg mixture.

This is the BEST! I did it in the slow cooker, also. Turned out great. I also used a mixture of Splenda and sugar to cut out some of the calories. I will definitely being making this again.

I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. The first time I made it the rice did not cook until after 7 hours. I read a review about putting it in the slow cooker and tried it. Again the rice did not cook. I gave it one final attemp on the stove and still the rice did not cook after hours. It is the creamiest rice pudding I've ever seen, too bad all the stirring went to wast since it never cooked right.

I loved one reviewer's idea of cooking this pudding in a crock pot since I have too little patience or time to baby sit a pot on the stove.  I followed the recipe, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that it took ALL DAY to cook.  And at the end, the texture was too grainy and soft for my liking.  The taste, however was fabulous (I added raisins and a little extra vanilla).  I'll definitely make this in my crock pot again, but I think using less milk will speed up cooking time and improve the final texture.

This recepie is excellent as written.  To adapt it to an asian meal, we made a few substitutions and my family liked it even more!  The substitutions were:  vanilla soy milk instead of milk (guest with a milk allergy), omit cinamon and add a pinch of sea salt and 1T extra virgin coconut oil (the kind that is white and solid at room temperature) at the end.  Cook everything else the same.  Here is the best part, drizzle with coconut milk and top with a sweet sliced mango.

OMG ... this is the best rice pudding I have ever tasted.  I'm eating it hot as I type this, I don't think there will be any left to put in the fridge (and I made it for 16) LOL  My hubby says it's to die for!  I followed the instructions exactly. I was concerned about the 1/2 gallon (8 cups) of milk ratio to the 1 cup of rice but it worked!  The only change I made was that I mixed in about a cup of half and half cream with the 2% milk to make a total of 8 cups.  I added a pinch of nutmeg and about 1/8 cup of Splenda brown sugar blend ... oh and I used Splenda instead of sugar.  When I mixed the egg & milk I put in some raisins and let them soak in the egg/milk mixture while the rice was cooking.  I tempered the egg/milk mixture as other posters suggested and added a large dollop of butter at the end as one poster did.  I can stop looking now, I've found my keeper rice recipe.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Bonnie.  Yum Yum!

Tastes just like my favorite (Kozy Shack). It may have been a little bit more liquid-y than it though, so maybe I'mm use 1 less cup of milk or sub the last 2 cups for a pint of heavy cream...

I have never made any kind of pudding before, so I didn't know what to expect. I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed when I got nothing but milk in the morning. Luckily, I was able to salvage my pudding by reheating it to a boil and then simmering. Once it is thick enough for the rice to float when spooned to the top, I put it back in the fridge to set. I then had some delicious rice pudding. So I will have to give 2 stars for instruction, but 4 stars for the finished product. I had a lot of fun making it and salvaging it. We're always learning and that's what I love about this website. Thanks!

THANK YOU!!! I've lost count of how many recipes I've tried while trying to find one that tasted like the rice pudding served in restaurants. They were either too dry or too thin or too complicated or too "eggy" ... well, you get the idea. This recipe is PERFECT! It's exactly what I've been looking for. It's easy, it's very creamy and it's absolutely delicious!  My search for a rice pudding recipe is finally over. :-)

VERY GOOD AND CREAMY RICE PUDDING.  HOWEVER, THE RECIPE SEEMS TO BE INCORRECT.  I FOLLOWED IT EXACTLY AND IF I HAD ONLY SIMMERED IT FOR TWO MINUTES AFTER ADDING  THE EGGS I WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH RICE SOUP.  I HAD TO SIMMER IT FOR AN ADDITIONAL 30 MINUTES. DELICIOUS

First time I made this, it didn't turn out well, but second time it was delicious. I needed to bring it to a simmer first and then cook it for an additional hour. Rice was tender and creamy. It was slightly yellow though and not white like I expected. Great flavor though. Thanks for recipe.

This is wonderful and easy.  I cook the
rice with salt to give it more flavor, then cut back on the salt in the pudding.  Sprinkle with cinnamon and a little nutmeg and serve warm with 1/2 & 1/2.

I scaled it down to 8 servings and it fit in a 2-quart casserole dish.  It was worth the time it took. I had a very hard time waiting for it to cool before sampling a spoonful.  It smelled and tasted so wonderful.  I will never buy store bought rice pudding again.  THANK YOU!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, except for the cooking time, and mine didn't set AT ALL.  I read the reviews first, and noted that some had to cook theirs longer to get it to set.  I cooked mine about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  The eggs scrambled, even though I put a little of the hot mixture into them, before adding them to the hot mixture.  12 hours later, it is like eating rice with sweet milk poured over the top.  Doesn't it need some sort of thickening agent like flour or cornstarch?  In my opinion, this was a huge waste of ingredients.  I am not sure I will try this again.  Sorry!

This recipe is the same one which my grandfather, a greek immigrant, used in his restaurant!  It's absolutely the BEST!  My husband doesn't like rice, but he LOVES this!  Just be sure to cook it long enough on the stovetop, as cook times vary greatly by make/model of stove.  Cook until thick BEFORE adding the egg mixture.

I agree with JESSGRIESS ... the pudding never set and I suspect that is due to an incorrect ratio of rice to milk.  One half-gallon of milk seems like an awful large amount for one cup of rice.  I wouldn't mind hearing from Bonnie with a correction  :)

This recipe is great, although it does need some changes! I have listed them below...
1. I use 2% milk which cooks and tastes great! I'm sure any type of milk would be great, although I find I make the best rice pudding using 2% milk.
2. I use 1 1/4 - 1/2 cups rice. The first time I tried this recipe with only 1 cup, it did not turn into rice pudding as there was too much of a gap between the milk to rice ratio. 
**NOTE** this is also preference. If you like your rice pudding more or less dense, add rice accordingly. To make a standard rice pudding though, about 1 1/4 cup rice should be fine.
**NOTE 2** As you are watching the rice pudding, you can add or take away rice until the last 10 minute mark (just dont take or put in too much!)
3. Time varies a lot!! I have made this recipe both in 1 hour, 2 hours, etc. You have to look at the rice pudding and wait until it thickens to let it sit for 10 minutes and then add the rest of the mixture! Be patient! If it is taking a long time, increase the heat slightly but watch it carefully!
4. I always put the heat slightly more towards medium heat. I think this makes for the right consistency. Along with this though, you have to be more watchful over the pudding to ensure the milk doesn't burn or the rice doesn't stick to the bottom.

Overall, this is a great recipe! It is a hit amongst my entire family! 

Happy baking! :)

I worked for many years at a family restaurant that made delicious homemade rice pudding almost daily. The only problem was, the quantities were so great that it was hard to scale it back for a normal family. when I saw this recipe, I was definitely intrigued. I was skeptical that only one cup of rice and a 1/2 gallon of milk would work. I read the reviews and was able to get some really good advice. So 5 stars for the recipe and 5 stars for those who posted helpful hints. Totally a success!

Delicious.

I will make it again for sure. I used short grain rice, which to me is the right thing for pudding, but I doubt it makes a great deal of difference. I skipped the cinnamon (I can decide for each portion whether I'd rather have plain vanilla, or add cinnamon to it then.) I used a bit less sugar, which for me is the whole point of making it myself.

As usual for these recipes, the actual time it took was more than the recipe said. An hour and 15 minutes did not allow enough time to bring such a large quantity of ingredients up to temperature.

To my mind, I followed the cooking directions exactly, but in reading some of the reviews, I can see that not enough information was given. To whit:

The recipe says to heat under medium low heat.  Simmer for an hour. So the hour starts after you get it to the boiling point.  Given the ingredients, I stirred constantly (but actually had it at a bit higher heat) while bringing it to temperature. Once simmering begins, it takes a very low heat to simmer  something covered -- so I would never expect to keep it on "medium low", even though the recipe didn't say to reduce the heat.

At the end... I see the recipe did not make this clear at all, but, eggs are not going to help set anything unless you actually cook them. The 2 minutes of cooking starts after the pudding is brought back up to temperature.

I did find that mine continued to thicken exactly as I would expect. (But then, that involves having a good feel for what to expec

i have made rice pudding many times but couldn't locate my previous recipe... i think the 'half gallon' of milk measurement is slightly off... i only used 6 cups of whole milk and at the point when my rice was completely cooked the mixture wasn't very solid so i tempered and added the egg mixture with 18% cream instead of more milk... it's trying to thicken up now.  It' been simmering on the heat for 2 hours already and still counting.... it smells and tastes delicious so I'm hopeful!! next time i'll use 4 cups of milk, 1 cup of rice and 3 eggs (i added an extra egg this time to help it set up).

My son and i love rice pudding and  I think I finally found a good rice pudding recipe, who hoo!  After trying several recipes, I think this may  be a keeper.  I only had skim milk and medium grain rice, so I used that and followed the recipe plus added the additional 1/3 cup sugar others suggested.  I taste pretty good. Next time I'll try whole milk for an even creamier taste.  Thank everyone for the suggestions.

This was excellent! Made exactly as instructed except I didn't use the second pot, and I omitted the raisins.

I've been searching for a good rice pudding recipe for a long time now. I tried this one today and it reminds me of the one my used to make. This is seriously a keeper.  I might use a little more sugar next time.

This was a big disappointment ,I did not care for the appearance.To yellow for me,I want my rice pudding nice and white. For the taste,I love sweet stuff but this was just way to sweet.I couldn't even bring myself to ask my family to try it. Didnt make any changes to recipe.

I had some concerns about the amount of milk but mine turned out thick and creamy.  I substituted 4 cups fat free half and half and 4 cups of 2% milk to reduce the calories and I omitted the 1/4 cup of milk and tempered the eggs before adding.  Added raisins.  This took slightly longer than the one hour (more like 80 minutes) but I made it while I was getting dinner in the crockpot/dishes/etc. so it didn't really tie me to the rice.  Good basic recipe and tasty.

This was a gift to the tastebuds! I deviated from the recipe just a smidge to arrive at my result. 1.) I used medium grain rice. (It's just a preference) 2.) I increased the rice amount from 1 cup to 1-1/2 cups. And after seeing the consistency at the end (which was NOT bad), I will probably just make it 2 cups altogether next time. 3.) As someone else mentioned, I increased the sugar amount to 1-1/2 cups to complement the added rice. 4.) I used whole milk. It's the only way to go, truly. 5.) I increased to 3 eggs. 6.) I added some raisins at the end. 7.) Oh, and 2 tsp. unsalted butter. Utterly divine. It tasted amazing warm, and legendary when chilled. Thanks a ton! I'll be making this for the holidays for sure.

This was the exact recipe I have been searching for. It tastes the same as my mother-in-law used to make it!
This was so easy to make and it turned out great. I used  4 cups of whole milk and 4 cups of half/half with 1 1/3 cup medium grain rice. I used  1/4 cup heavy cream in the egg mixture. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar as that is plenty sweet enough for my family's tastes. I added a couple of cinnamon sticks while it was simmering for added flavor.

This is the best rice pudding hands down.

Even though I read the recipe many times (since I didn't want to ruin it), I didn't see the word 'covered' referring to the saucepan. After cooking the rice mixture 45 minutes I realized It needed to be covered....so it took about 2 hrs. until the consistency was thick. I was nervous about adding the egg mixture, so I added it slowly & stirred like crazy! I' m happy to say it turned out great & tastes delicious--despite my mistake! Thanks for sharing the recipe that I'll make again.

This is classic.  I use just a little bit less sugar (personal preference)and a cinnamon stick. I heat the milk sugar before adding the rice.  Once the rice is in I bring it to a simmer (it was about 30 minutes to get to this point) then cook it with the lid partly off until it was the desired consistency.  This takes about another 60 minutes. Keep stirring so it doesn't stick and don't rush it. I let the egg and additional milk come to room temperature and I also temper the eggs before putting it into the rice mixture.

This recipe is excellent.  We think it tastes just like Kozy Shack's.  I always make it in the crock pot.  I throw the 1/2 gallon milk, 1 cup white rice, and 1 cup of milk in the crock pot and cook on high for 3 hours, stirring midway.  I then mix in the 1/4 cup milk, three eggs, and vanilla slowly, whisking the entire time until mixed.  Then I put the lid on and wait 20-30 minutes.  I cool and store the pudding in the fridge while leaving it in the crock pot.  We don't put anything else in it at all.  I love it as-is.  Enjoy!

This is the best rice pudding recipe! I cut the recipe in half but used 2 eggs since I couldn't figure out how do add 1 and a 1/2 eggs. Texture is fabulous and very creamy. I love it. I am so glad I halved the recipe because 12 servings is a huge amount of pudding. I had made this once before and it was delicious but not very thick at all. I think the trick is you MUST use whole milk...not skim, not 2%, not 1%. Whole MILK Only. This time it is the perfect consistency.

I saw this reviewed and thought, wow, it's been so very long since I had good rice pudding.  So, with all the ingredients on hand, I made it.  I used skim milk for 7 cups and 1 cup of fat free 1/2 & 1/2.  I used an 8 qt stock pot and if not careful, the milk does foam up over the lid, so be careful.  I did bring this to a boil, turn down the heat and covered for 70 minutes, making the mixture very thick.  I stirred it with a wire whisk every 7-8 minutes, easy enough as I was in the kitchen doing other things.  This is truly as creamy and custardy as I thought it should be.  I like it served cold and will surely make this again.

My youngest son loves rice pudding so I found this recipe and made it for him and not only did he love it but the rest of the family did too. I did add a couple of pats of butter while it was simmering so it would not boil over and it worked great though you still need to stir it from time to time to prevent sticking. I started timing it from when it came to a boil and the timing was perfect. I do suggest not over stirring it once cooked or the rice might turn to mush. Thanks so much for a delicious rice pudding recipe which is great warm or cold.

I had never made rice pudding before. For some reason I thought it would be too hard. This recipe is easy and delicious. I am eating a cup of it warm as I type. I will make this recipe again. We served it Wed. at our farmers market diner and it sold out! The people loved it! Thanks again.

My sis made this recipe.  She added 2 cups of rice instead of just one, and it is thick, creamy and delicious.  I have never had rice pudding like I did when I was a child, but this recipe is the closest I have ever tasted.  It's so good!

This is the best rice pudding I've ever had! It wasn't really that time consuming. You just put it together and come back an hour later and finish it. Simple. I add cardamom and nutmeg to mine.

Excellent!! I have tried many, and, this is BEST!! The first time I made, it was just a little runny, I agree with Angela, I added an extra egg, and, I made egg mixture first, and let sit so the egg wouldn't cook. I also had on med low heat, and after boil, I started to cook. The taste is unbelievable!! Enjoy!!

This is the BEST homemade rice pudding recipe I've tired. It tastes amazing! I followed directions exactly (but cooked a little longer to thicken more). My kids (teenagers) were standing around the kitchen waiting for it to cool enough to eat lol. A keeper! I'll be making weekly. Thanks for sharing!

Mine also came out not thick even though I read the reviews and followed them. I have not given up yet. I will try again but next time I will thicken the rice mixture really well before I added eggs. It tastes really good.

I only gave 3 stars because I had to so vastly change the recipe around since I was using instant rice. I feared it would cook wrong (a whole hour!). It only took about 20 minutes of prep/cook and I was very happy with the pudding! I looked at other recipes which didnt suggest adding extra milk with the egg but definitely DO SO! Very helpful starting point... Next time, I'll use "real" rice! I trust this recipe will deliver already!

my bf requested rice pudding for valentines day this past year and i've never made or eaten it!  So i came upon this recipe and thought i'd give it a whirl.  for my first attempt, it was okay - he said the flavor was awesome, but it was a bit soupy.  guess i'll cook it longer next time and read a few more reviews for tips!

Flavor was great, just too soupy. It wasn't even close to being creamy. I made sure I followed the directions precisely, too.

I added the extra 1/3 cup sugar and it was awesome...I like raisins in mine so I added 1 1/2cups raisins that I soaked in hot water for 10 min to plump, drained and added when I added the egg mixture...great old fashioned recipe that I took to church brunch and got raves as well as asked several times for recipe...a winner!

SOOOO GOOD! I used half sugar & half sweet n low (12 packets) and for some of the milk i used vanilla almond milk and I used Jasmine rice. while it cooked I cleaned out my fridge,made lunch and did dishes-that way i could stir it frequently and still get other stuff done. Great recipe, thank you for sharing!!!

I was looking for a rice pudding recipe for my Mother who has stage 4 Ovarian Cancer.  She loves rice pudding and it's good for her.  I changed it to brown rice, added an extra egg and 3 tbsp of vanilla...The best recipe by far.  Don't hesitate to try, well worth it and super easy once you make it the first time....love, love, love this recipe..Won't be using anything else...

The best rice pudding ever!!!....I followed the advice of adding more sugar and I added a dash more vanilla just to enhance the flavor further. Takes time to make but well worth the time.  I'll be making this one over and over.  Thanks to the submitter~~!!!

OMG!! This recipe is to die for! My son who is the toughest food critic gave it a BIG thumbs up! I followed everything to the 'T'.. Only change was I used med grain rice with an extra 1/4 c. for thicker pudding, and added A small amount of the hot pudding to room temp egg mixture prior to adding to entire pot so I wouldn't end up with scrambled eggs!  Absolutley Devine! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe has a great taste. I made it with canned condenced milk, and it came out even creamer than with whole milk. The only thing I would change is the length of cooking time... The rice was alittle chewey it could have cooked longer.Still a good recipe...I would make this again.

OMG! This is amazing! It's so thick and creamy! I must admit I was getting worried about it thickening up. However, I followed the advise of others and let it continue to cook for about 1.5 hours before adding the egg mixture and it turned out perfect! This recipe is a keeper. I can't wait for everyone else to try it! Thanks Bonnie!

I'm scratching my previous review. Only because I read other people's reviews, took their advice and each time I make this its a hit! I feel so successful with this recipe, even though my 1st try was soupy, EVERYONE loved it! I'm gonna try the crock pot version next time. I really like the labor of love that this recipe makes you give. It's so yummy... I think  a monkey could do this and it would probably taste good. :-D

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  I have to be gluten free and have been searching for desserts that I can actually have.  I used 4 cups 1/2 and 1/2 and 4 cups milk and it turned out rich and creamy and well worth the effort.  This also works for a wonderful breakfast in place of cereal I only use 1/2 the sugar when I want to make a breakfast batch.....Thank you so much for posting this wonderful rice pudding....

Wow...I am EXTREMELY impressed.  I've tried a few rice pudding recipes (the ones where you boil the rice in water first) and they were okay.  But if you are looking for a rice pudding recipe that is more than just acceptable, THIS IS IT...the only thing that I did different from the recipe was that I added a few cinnamon sticks to boil with the milk/rice/sugar mix.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I was looking for the ultimate rice pudding recipe...this is it! I tried others that just didn't have the creamy texture I wanted. I was trying to find one similar to that of an older Southern lady that I knew years ago, and this recipe was it. Thank you for sharing it!

This rice pudding is PHENOMENAL! There needs to be a million star option!  No kidding!  I am sitting here eating it as I type, and warm at that....so delicious!  
I tweaked it a little based on the reviews I read. I added a 1/3 cup sugar, and only used 2 eggs.  I also tempered the eggs.  The result is fabulous, I will make this again and again...thanks for sharing it with us! :)

This is one of those delicious old fashioned treats that make you feel as though you slipped back a century or two. I made a few changes based on the reviews. 
1. I added one more egg and a tad more sugar.
2. Made the egg mixture at the same time as I put up the pudding so it would come to room temperature. 
3. Mixed some of the rice mixture in with the eggs before adding them to the pudding so they wouldn't curdle. 
A bit of effort, but well worth it!

Awesome! This is the best rice pudding I've ever made. Do follow the directions and as recommended, keep on the stove until it's creamy about 1 hour and 15 minutes from boiling. Otherwise it will be watery. I also added 4 eggs for extra richness. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe sounded wonderful, but it did not turn out well.  It wasn't creamy at all, but it did get great reviews from others, so maybe it is just me.  I would try adding more milk or something to make it less dry.

Wow.  I uber-dig this recipe!  I didn't use milk for the initial boil, as I can't quite digest milk, but after I took it off the heat and added in the egg (I used egg substitute), /that's/ when I added the milk.  It didn't detract from the creaminess or richness at all.  I also used Splenda for sweetness.  I love this recipe! ^_^

This is really really good!  I used 2% milk and cooked it about 15 minutes longer and it is VERY thick!  I used all 3 eggs and it is not at all custardy.  I didn't have the patience to wait for 10 min. for the pudding to cool before adding the egg mixture so I just tempered the eggs by adding a ladleful of the hot pudding to the eggs, stirring well and then adding all the egg mixture to the pudding.  I tasted it right away and worried that it wouldn't be sweet enough, but when we had it for dessert the next day, we thought it was perfect.  I also added 1/2 t. fresh nutmeg because we love it.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

For those of you who like a nice, thick pudding you won't be disappointed.  It's well worth the time it takes to prepare and set up.

This is so delicious. I've never had rice pudding before, but man, after having this last bowl here, with a fried banana? I am seriously dying.

I cooked mine with a stick of cinnamon, and 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 2%. 

Definitely will be making more of this.

I, too, made this recipe in the crock pot. Being the lazy cook that I am, the thought of continuously stirring over the stove, does not appeal.  This was probably the best rice pudding I ever made.  The only thing I would change when I make this recipe again is to add more rice.

This pudding is soooo good. Definetly worth the time. I gave half to my parents and they raved! I added an extra egg and extra vanilla and made it with whole milk. Custardy, vanilla goodness. Next time I'll try adding raisins. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is really spectacular,the absolute best !!  however it makes a ton.  I will half it next time. I did add a dash nutmeg to the rice mixture and only used the cinnamon when ready to serve, just a lite sprinkle on top.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe! I cannot eat it, having a dairy allergy, but hubby loves rice pudding. Recently he became very ill, and had no appetite, so I bought him some commercial rice pudding. He gobbled it up so fast I figured I'd better learn how to make it myself. 

With so many recipes to choose from, this one caught my eye for it's simplicity and creamy sounding texture. I made a batch and he raved! He likes it much better than the commercial stuff, and says it reminds him of what his Mom used to make when he was growing up - high praise indeed! 

Since then I've been making it for him regularly, and it remains the one thing I can be sure he'll eat, even when he is having a bad day. It smells so good when I'm making it I really regret my allergy :-)

This stuff is great. I do it in the crock pot because I'm lazy; I can only imagine how wonderful it is if you prepare it the way it states. I don't think the kind of milk you use matters at all. I've used whole, 2 percent, skim, and even vanilla soy. Without the eggs you can even cut back on the sugar. This recipe is really versatile and nearly impossible to mess up. It makes a surprisingly enormous batch and gets gobbled up lightning quick!

Loved this recipe. So fast, good and easy. My husband loves rice pudding, I used to bake it in the oven for 2-3 hours.  I did use long grain rice and cooked the rice in my microwave for 20 minutes, using a steamer dish, before mixing with the milk etc on the stovetop. I've made this twice and plan to keep this recipe, and make it often.

This really is the best rice pudding recipe I've found!  I made it with 1 cup cream instead of a full half gallon of whole milk.  It thickened beautifully.  Other recipes that I've tried have still been runny or the rice has been too firm, but this was thick and creamy.  Instead of cooling the rice mixture before adding the eggs, I slowly dribbled a bit of the hot milk/rice into the egg mixture while stirring, then poured it all back into the pot.  Stir, stir, stir to prevent little floaty egg bits.  I also like that this recipe makes a lot of rice pudding since my family loves it.  My son and I are both enjoying bowls of it warm right now!  I might add a little extra sugar next time.  Mmmmmmm :)

I was looking for a recipe like my grandmother's.  This is it!!!!  The best rice pudding I have ever had, including my grandmother's. It is soooooo creamy and luscious even my husband who doesn't like rice pudding liked it. I added a little more sugar, but it was very sweet, I will stick to the recipe next time.  I used a little canned milk, because I was low on reg. milk. It was fantastic.  Thanks again to Bonnie.  Karen

I got a craving yesterday for rice pudding (even though I've only ever had it once) but I didn't have any time to make it.  I noticed one of the other reviewers made this in her crock pot, so I decided to give it a try.  I put the rice, milk, and sugar in there for 3 hours on low while I was off doing something else, then came home and put the remaining ingredients in.  I was slightly skeptical because it was still VERY soupy.  So, I put it on high when I put the last ingredients in, then left it on while I took a shower.  By the time I was out of the shower it had thickened up a lot!  I ate it hot, and it was really tasty.  It thickened up even more as it cooled down, so I think I'll like it even better cold, the way it's supposed to be.

This was so very good.  Absolutely wonderful!  I did temper the egg mixture with some of the milk mixture before putting them together.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  If you like rice pudding, you will love this!

This did take me a bit longer, but as rated before "its well worth it" I made a few changes...I boiled the rice with half and half and 2-3 cinnanmon sticks. I didnt put the sugar in the begining b/c the rice will not become soft it will remain somewhat al dente. continue with the recipe as written, add sugar towards the end.

Took the suggestion of using heavy cream instead of milk and it was still very thin so added more rice and that helped.  The taste was very good so it made up for the lack of thickness.

Thank you for submitting this recipe!! I used to stand at my stove stirring and stirring for over an hour. This recipe was wonderful to be able to put the lid on it, walk away, and return to stir occasionally.  I took the hint of another reviewer when after an hour, it wasnt thick enough for me. It too about 90 minutes for it to get to the thickness that I like. I cut back the amount of sugar too because I would rather add sugar later then not be able to take it out if I add it at the beginning and it ends up too sweet. A creamy, wonderful, just like mommas rice pudding!!

Wow.  I made this in a crock pot.  I cooked it on high 3 and half hours.  added eggs at room temperature.  Per another review I cook eggs on high for 20 mins.  It was a tad grainy.  Next time I will drop it down to low before I put the eggs in.  I did use cinnamon sticks and one quart of cream.  This is a keeper love the crock pot.

I made this in my slow cooker on medium for 3 hours. I used 1 qt of whole milk, 1 qt of 2% milk, and 2/3 cups of sugar.
I also used 4 egss and had no problem with it getting thick. I used orange flavor instead of vanilla in half of the pudding. I gives it a completly diffrent taste. Next time I think I will half the recipe as it makes A LOT! HUMMMM!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I made it in the crockpot as suggested by another reviewer.  I heated the milk first and then added the rice, sugar and scraped a vanilla bean into it.  It probably cooked for at least 3 hours on low (I stirred occasionally).  When it reached the desired thickness I added the tempered egg mixture and cooked on high for approximately 1/2 hour.  I then kept it on warm and served it directly from the crockpot with cinnamon, half & half and whipped cream... yummy!!

I loved this recipe...I would have given it 5 stars, but I would change a few things next time. I would add less sugar..Maybe 3/4 cup, I would also cook it longer than 1 hour..maybe 10 more minutes..I wanted to to be a little thicker. Other than that it is a great recipe that I plan on using again.

Excellent receipe, I used 2% milk and it was very creamy. Next time I am going to put them in individual cups. The cinnamon is a must. I had the pudding warm and cold- to my surprise it is better cold!
***UPDATE*** I used a medium grain rice this time and it was much creamier and smoother this time. So delicious!

Yummmm! I make this recipe often.  It's a big hit in my house.  I, too, bring this recipe to a boil before I cover it and start the simmering time.  After it has chilled in the fridge, I add about 1/2 cup of milk and mix it up...just a personal preference...it's great either way!

Oooohh! So rich and creamy! I had a craving for rice pudding and I can't have sugar (the sugar free ones at the store just don't cut it) so I used this recipe and fat free Half and Half (Land 'o Lakes) instead of the milk and an artificial sweetener (Splenda type). I couldn't even tell a difference. Since it is just me eating it I cut it down to 4 servings and it only took a half hour on the stove. I will definately make this again, and again and again.... I think I will take it to our next family gathering to see if anyone realizes it is "no sugar added"!

Oh my goodness! I've been looking for a good recipe for rice pudding for years. The only person I've ever known that can make it is my aunt, and she won't give me her recipe. I bought the  that cozy shack tries to pass off as rice pudding once, and never again. I made this last night, using the tips from others, and this is absolutely the best rice pudding I've ever had in my life. DH had never had any at all and finished off everything left in the pan tonight! This is definitely one that I'll make again. I even went and bought cinnamon stick today to try it that way! Thanks!

I had some leftover cooked rice and I thought that I could use it to make the pudding. It turned out wonderful. I used whole milk and simmered it for about an hour with a 2/3cup of honey (we are sugar intolerant). This used up all the milk and made the pudding very creamy. Then I followed the rest of instructions. I added some raisins and crushed walnuts and cinnamon. The end result is awesome! Thank you for a great recipe.

All it was was rice with milk and sugar.  I threw it out.  A friend of mine says she makes hers with condensed milk & evaporated milk and she adds cooked rice instead of cooking the rice with the milk.  What a waste of time, milk, and rice.

My husband LOVES rice pudding and I have spent many years trying to find one that suits him. "Texture A, Taste A, Excellent". So now this recipe will go into my recipe box for safe keeping. I will be taking it this evening to a dinner party where the hostess is gluten intolerant, so I'll know later what everyone else thinks, not that it matters. Read the reviews too, and added raisins. Also cut the recipe down to 8 servings since that is all I needed for now.

This pudding pretty good.  I read some of the reviews and followed many of the suggestions, some of which I probably should have ignored.  I added additional sugar, (1/4c), which made it way too sweet.  I also continued cooking until it was as thick as I wanted it - it's too thick now, even with skim milk.  I remedy that by stirring in additional milk before eating.  What I did like was that I added 4 cardamon pods while it was simmering - next time I'll probably add 6, right at the beginning.

Good but it didn't go over well at the dinner party I took it to. Rice as a dessert doesn't seem to appeal to some palates. I didn't have any problems with it thickening up. Great, easy recipe but I don't think I'll be making this again.

This rice pudding came out really good. I read all the reviews, and took heed to what they said. 1.) I added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar. 2.) I brought the milk sugar and rice mixture to a boil before starting my 1 hour timing. 3.)I added some of the rice mixture to the egg mixture before adding back to the pot.

I also, used 4 cups of whole milk, 1 cup of cream, and 3 cups of fat free milk to make my 1/2 gallon of milk.  I also had to cook for an extra 30 minutes after adding the egg mixture, nothing happened, so I put into a medium sized bowl, covered, and put into the fridge, and it thickened up nicely. This pudding tastes good hot or cold. My brother liked it hot, while me and my mom and my dad enjoyed it cold better. I also thought that it tasted better the next day. I will make again when I have the time.

I just made this, but did not have enough milk so used about 1/2 cup heavy cream for half the recipe.  Just don't know how this is going to be any better cold. It is great hot.

Absolutely delicious. You should have no problems with this recipe if you can really feel your way through cooking. My husband loves it hot, but I am looking forward to it in the morning. I also doubled the amount of vanilla and added brown suger, ginger, and nutmeg.
Good eating!

This was really good, and can be made with sticky (glutinous) black rice too. Tastes just like ice cream! I omitted the cinamon however, and when serving it sprinkled some toasted almonds on top. I think next time I'll try it was some coconut milk for  a little different flavour.

This rice pudding is PERFECT!  I made it exactly as the recipe said.  It so creamy and delicious and I even used low-fat milk to cut calories.  It's to die for if you eat it warm.  I've tried different recipes, but nothing can compare... especially not the baked ones.

This is a very good recipe. I would only change one little thing. Instead of the whole egg, i would chose to use just the egg whites, 4 of them. So i could cut out some calories. I am the biggest rice puding fan, and this is one of my favorites!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe 100%. I was however very disappointed when it did not thicken;  the second time I followed the advice of several others and cooked the pudding (after adding the eggs) until it was completely thickened (it took several more minutes than the recipe suggests) The results were much better!

This was the best rice pudding I have ever made! Followed other reviews.... Didn't start the one hour timing until the rice/sugar/milk mixture was boiling. Even so, I added about another 20 mins of cook time. Used whole milk, and tempered the eggs before adding. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T and absolutely loved the results! Still waiting for it to chill, but I've been digging in while its still warm. It's that good!

I made this with soymilk and it was good, although not mind-blowingly so.  Still it received compliments and reminded my guests of rice pudding they had in their childhood.  They also taught me about adding whipped cream on top which is really good!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!  I read all the reviews before making this recipe, which helped out alot.  It only took an hour for this recipe to thicken up for me. This will boil over if you do not stir it every 5-8 minutes.  Thank you Bonnie for submitting this recipe, I was so impressed with the rice pudding I made everyone at home try it.  I'm now going to remake it for my diabetic dad using splenda.  I used skim milk for this recipe.

I just had to use real vanilla beans with this recipe since it was cooking so long, plus I have 3 pounds of beans to go through. 2 split beans made this just right. I also tossed in some craisins into half of it.

Used basmati rice like some other reviewers suggested. Watch very closely as this cooks because it will boil over soon as you don't watch it. I use 1/2 to 1 tsp each cinnamon and nutmeg and mix in soon as the egg mixture is mixed with the rice and milk.  It is helpful to mix some of the milk mixture with the egg mixture before adding to the saucepan. This is ok to eat soon as it cools down some.  YUMMY!!

FINALLY!!!  A rice pudding recipe the whole family loves!  I've made several different ones, none of which we liked, but this one is excellent!  I cut the recipe by a fourth, as I didn't want to waste ingredients if we didn't like it...but we loved it!  I used Basmati rice and the flavor was really good!   Both husband and child wanted more and I'm making a big pot of it now.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great taste.  I've only had trouble twice, once because the milk was from the fridge to burner and didn't get warm enough long enough.  The other time was because the milk was not fresh enough to handle the head.  Excellent for my scottish friends!

This was a great recipe! I've been making it for family get gatherings and I've been asked for the recipe every time. They can't believe I made it. Thank you Bonnie.

My first try at rice pudding and it was easy and great tasting.  Mine could have been a little creamier but I know it is my fault - I was thinking that maybe it wasn't thick enough near the end so I cooked it longer - next time I will keep to the time recommended.

This is my favorite recipe for rice pudding. I made a few small modifications: I cut the recipe in fourth (serves 2 people this way), added 2 tablespoons of currants and 3 sliced, fresh figs about 5 minutes before the end of the cooking time (before adding in the egg mixture--I just used 1 egg white). I used 2 tablespoons of 100% maple syrup and 1/4 C splenda instead of the sugar. Finally, I served it warm instead of cooled...and it tasted delicious!

As the reviewer before me mentioned, the 1:8 ration of rice and milk works perfectly. My family makes a slow-cooked rice porridge about once a week (like rice pudding, but made with water, not milk)--and we use a 1:12 ratio. It will thicken up with enough cooking over a low flame. Be patient. This is also a forgiving recipe, as long as you keep the heat low. If you cook it for a little too long, or it's too thick, just add in a little additional milk or water. If it's too watery, try cooking it longer, or cooking for a little while with the lid off.

Very easy and simple, although it does take a little time.  I didn't have any vanilla and I have no idea what kind of rice I used and it still ended up delicious.  I put a little more cinnamon in.

This indeed was excellent rice pudding.  The only down side was I ended up eating it all (my boyfriend doesn't like rice pudding).  Next time I make it it will be for a party and I'm sure it will be a big hit!

This rice pudding is really yummy! I added 1/2c. raisins (while cooking) and some cinnamon to the mixture (at the end). I will sprinkle extra on top.  It's wonderful slightly cooled but I will serve tonight for dessert so will only refrigerate about 4 hours...not worried if it will be any good. I just can't wait to eat more! It's amazing how much the rice plumps up in all that milk. I even used skim milk and about half the sugar was splenda (would have used more but ran out).

This is a great, simple, traditional recipe.  Of course it tastes better with whole milk.  Also, I heated up some Malibu Rum and soaked golden raisins in the hot rum for about 2 hours, then I threw them into the pudding.  Also, I was out of heavy cream so I used French Vanilla Coffeemate, just a little, and the non-fat free kind.  With these changes it was really good!  Thanks!

We were invited to a bring an appetizer/dessert dinner, I had a similar recipe years ago, but lost it. This one is even better! The only dessert on the table that was gone, I could have bought twice the amount and it still would not have been enough. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Thank you for posting it.

very creamy, with a good taste. It did take awhile but it came out good. I didn't read the recipe right and put in the egg mixture after the 10 minutes and thought it was done. I put it in the fridge and I had watery rice pudding.  I realized my mistake, poured it back into a large saucepan and boiled it for 2 minutes and it thickened right up and is a perfect consistancy. This is not overly weet which I like but a person who likes it sweet would definitely want to kick the sugar up a notch.

Not being a huge fan of raisons, I had searched for a recipe witout them. This was really tasty and reminded me of the rice pudding I had as a kid-from deli's in NY. The first time I used skim milk (all I had at the time) but less than the recipe called for and it was a little drippy-but still tasty. Last night I used whole milk and it really was perfect!

Unfortunately I didn't have much success with this one! The pudding never thickened or set, even after more than an hour of cooking, and when it finally did set, the eggs cooked too much and became lumpy. Despite all this I tasted it and the flavor was fine, besides not being creamy. If you could let me in on the secret of this recipe, I would be willing to try it again!

Loved this recipe. I did make it 2 times. The first time the rice didn't seem to cook all the way. The second time, I par cooked rice for only 4 mins and then continued with the recipe. Delish!!!

Made it as written and I will make it again.  Rice pudding has been a traditional dessert for our Christmas Eve meal and I've never been a fan.  But I tried this recipe and I actually like it a lot!  It has a "custardy" feel to it, but it dishes up in a bowl like our previous attempts.

Made this in the crock pot as other suggested. Added a cinnamon stick and a dash of nutmeg in with rice and other ingredients. Used Mexican vanilla in place of the regular vanilla and added dried cranberries and ground cinnamon once it was done. The hubs loved it!

This rice pudding is so addictive. The Mother of ALL rice puddings.  I’ve made this recipe as written twice.  Other times since, I’ve added a little bit of real butter.  I always use whole milk.   Some helpful notes I picked up in other reviews:
-Bring milk/sugar to a soft boil, then add rice. 
-set a timer to stir every 10 minutes.  
-I don’t put the lid fully on, just leave it cracked open a bit so no boiling over
-as it thickens, I set timer and stir every 4 mins
-I probably cook it like this about an hour and a half
-when it’s the consistency I’m happy with, I take it off the burner for 10 minutes to cool slightly
-then I add the eggs, milk, cinnamon, vanilla and butter

For my next trick, I’m adding cardamom.  Or Nutmeg.  Or maybe allspice?  

I might even experiment with adding an extra egg.  I LOVE the rich custard-like consistency of this.  It’s amazing warm or cold.  

I never will eat any other rice pudding again.  They are all inferior to this one, I promise you this.

Made this for a dinner party with a couple of girlfriends and making it in the crockpot was the BOMB!! So easy!  I used a crockpot liner and did add the extra 1/3 cup sugar as another reviewer suggested and also put in cinnamon sticks while it cooked on low overnight. Added 1cup of raisins and topped each serving with whipped cream and a sprinkle of sugar/cinnamon blend. We all loved it!! Will make this again for sure. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I think the flavor is great. I made it the first time following the recipe, started the 1hour after it came to a boil. I even cooked it about 10 mins longer. Omitted cinnamon. Used Abborrio  Rice for creamy results. I used 2% milk. Even with additional cook time, it was runny. I made it a second time and continued to follow recipe instead this time I used 1 heaping cup of long grain white rice and 1 cup Abborrio Rice. I pulled the 1/4 cup milk from the half gallon, rather than in addition to. After I cooked it the 1 hour after reaching boiling, it was very thick. I pulled about a cup or so out into a bowl and mixed in the 1/4 cup milk, 3 beaten eggs, vanilla, splash of salt. Then incorporate that mixture into the rest of the pan. Came out great!! Perfect consistency. Again skipped cinnamon.  The flavor is great and I'm anxious to see after it chills overnight if it still has a great taste and has not gotten pasty.

Made the pudding tonight, incorporating Angela’s changes, wish I could give it a higher rating, it’s delicious warm, can’t wait till tomorrow to try it once refrigerated.  Only way to make true rice pudding is to cook the rice in milk.  Yum, yum!

This recipe is delicious and very forgiving of substitutes! I'm dairy intolerant so the first time I made this with rice milk and it turned out perfectly with no other adjustments. The second time I tried it with almond milk, which has a lower fat content, and found that it needed much longer cooking time, so I'd recommend cutting back the amount of almond milk by perhaps a whole cup. I also used coconut sugar on my second try for a healthier alternative with a richer taste. I imagine playing around with the sugars (i.e. half brown, half white, or some sugar replacements) would work out as well.

ProTip: If you underestimated how much cooking time the pudding needed and it didn't thicken up enough in the fridge, just throw the 9x13 pan in the oven at 250*F for a couple hours, stirring occasionally. This will help the excess liquid evaporate without overcooking the pudding.

I used Vanilla Almond milk to make this and Whipping cream for the last step. Gave it a very sweet richness.
Also 60 minutes is a LOL for the first step.
To get as thick as it should be takes at least 1 3/4 hrs. 
Remember you are stirring a lot so you are uncovering the pot so it takes longer.
Good recipe
Smooth and creamy and almond milk works great but make the sugar less.
Too much in the directions way too sweet.
Should not be.

I made this (first time ever making rice pudding). I followed a tagged suggestion and added 1 more egg. It also said to cook to the point of thickness desired. Being afraid to cook it too long and get eggs- I made a slurry of cornstarch and the hot milk and thickened it with that along with extra cook time. It turned out wonderful!

I’ve made this several times and it is great each time.  I found Neilly’s Coconut rice mix and used it in place of the rice.  Gave it a hint of coconut flavor.  I also use half and half in place of the last milk (I visit my mom once a month and make her two batches of rice pudding — this way I only need to buy one gallon of milk).  Yum to the max!

This is really creamy, as advertised.  Very tasty.  I made it with 1% milk and added a cinnamon stick to the rice mixture as it cooked.

Absolutely Delicious! I've been wanting rice pudding but with so many recipes on here, which one to try? I always read the reviews first and when I saw that others made this in the crockpot, I thought, how much easier does it get? I followed the ingredients "as is". I warmed the milk (I used skim as that's what we drink) on the stove, just until barely warm. I then put it in the crockpot with one cup of long grain rice and the sugar. Truth be told, I did add another 1/3 c. of sugar. I set the crockpot in high and stirred every 30-45 minutes. I checked it in 3 hours and there was still a lot of liquid in the pot so let it go another 1 1/2 hours on the Low setting. At this time I beat 3 eggs and tempered the eggs with pouring a 1/2 cup of the hot milk in with the eggs before adding to the rice mixture. I also added the vanilla and salt at this time. Let it cook another 20 minutes and it was thick and yummy. So easy, no pot to watch. The milk didn't burn on. I will definitely fall back on this recipe anytime I get the desire for rice pudding again. Oh, I added the cinnamon at the very end. Delicious!

Total disaster. As others stated - rice soup. Way too much milk. I hesitated when I first saw that, but continued based on the star rating and number of reviews. Salvaged it somewhat by adding a corn starch mixture after reheating it the next day. Still pretty good. Probably won't try again, though, unless someone can tell me why so many had a near perfect experience and others a total disaster.

I love it! I followed the instructions as listed but did include the tips in the reviews. I added the extra egg as well as began my 1 hour cook time once the mixture began simmering. I will definitely be making this again. It was just like my grandmother's.

I made the rice pudding and it came out great! I was worried because I used almond milk instead of whole milk, but it still tasted delicious.

Absolutely delicious. I was out of eggs, so I used flaxseeds to make an egg substitute. It worked perfectly and gave the rice a nutty component. I cut the sugar by about 1/3 and I also added cardamon pods, cloves and cinnamon sticks to the milk/sugar/rice mixture, removing them before adding the “egg” mixture. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very delicious! However, it does require additional cooking time. Plan on 1 1/2 hrs before adding eggs. I also used 4 eggs as another reviewer mentioned along with some nutmeg, just because I like this spice. It’s worth the time for this old fashioned treat.

Would be helpful if you stated the 1/2 gallon of milk is a U.S.A gallon or a Canadian gallon, as there's a big difference.  Or in cupss like everything else is.  Otherwise it's good, but I had to figure out the ratios.

I should have read the reviews first before making this recipe. I went exactly by the recipe, but mine didn't get thick enough. It's not real runny, but not the consistency I wanted it to be. I lost my Mother's recipe from years ago, but remember how thick it was. I don't know if I can put it back in the pan and cook it longer or what. It's been in the refrigerator all night, and I too, thought somehow that would thicken it up. Tastes good, and I added raisins.

This recipe needs tweaking, but the end results are great. Here’s what I did...
1 1/2 cup rice
8 cups milk
1/3 cup sugar

1/4 cup milk
3 eggs
5 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt

I increased the temperature a little and had it on the stovetop for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring it every 10 minutes or so. The trick is that you need to continue to have it on the stovetop until you can see the mixture getting denser/ heavier. If you do that, the recipe turns out great!!! A huge hit in my household!!!!!

I have gone through dozens of recipes trying to find one that was close to the diner and Italian deli style of rice pudding that I grew up with in New York. This is not only close, it is almost exact! Followed the recipe, apart from starting with all ingredients at room temperature. Did follow the crockpot recommendations of others, and it makes this recipe practically foolproof.  This is going to become a staple dessert at our house,  no doubt.

This was delicious, but I did change it a bit: I first  soaked a cup of raisins in about a cup of Salted Caramel Bailey's , per a suggestion to soak raisins in liquor.  Then for the pudding, I combined one can of sweetened condensed milk, about a half pint of half and half, and whole milk, to get to the half gallon needed.  Because of the addition of sweetened condensed milk, I reduced the sugar to about 1/3 cup. I also added a stick of cinnamon.  I then started out cooking in the crock pot, per many suggestions, but it was not getting to the right temp to thicken quickly enough for me ( I was bringing it to my sister's that day), so I put it all in the pressure cooker and set to the "rice" setting.  I tempered the egg mixture  with 1/2 cup rice mixture before adding,  then added the liquor soaked raisins, and kept pressure cooker on low for another 20 minutes or so. It was a little bit thinner than I wanted, but it did thicken up a bit after sitting  and then chilling. When it was ready, I served with a dash or two of Penzey's cinnamon blend and whipped cream. HEAVEN!   Everyone thought the addition of the Bailey's soaked raisins was awesome. The only thing I would do different next time is maybe reduce milk by  about a cup and do it in the pressure cooker to begin with.

My new potluck favorite! Really creamy and beautiful. Teensiest bit too sweet for me, will cut sugar by 1/3 next time. Used low fat milk and added 1T butter at end. Thanks for posting!

I honestly can’t foresee anyone making this as described and having it be successful. The amount of rice is way too low, if you only use 1 cup, you’ll end up with vanilla pudding with a few lumps of rice in it. I used closer to 2 and even that seemed low in the end. For sure use 2 and even 2.5 would be better. I added a cinnamon stick to the  mixture as it simmered away.

mmmmm...yummy! I brought the rice, milk and sugar to a boil, then turned to low and covered and stirred occasionally to avoid sticking. I left the egg/ milk mixture out for the hour and then added about a cup of the hot rice into the egg mixture to temper then added it back into the rice. This is SO creamy! And its sweet but not overly sweet. Love it! I just put it into a bowl, hot, sprinkled cinnamon over and put a plastic wrap on the top of the pudding and refrigerated overnight.

I think there is a typo in the instructions which indicates to cook 2 min after adding the egg mixture.  After setting overnight, I still had a pan full on liquid.  I actually put it back in a pan & Cooked over medium heat, stirring steadily for about 20 min., as with other puddings. The mixture thickened & came to a slight bubbling, and was done.  It did set almost immediately & was delicious! I see others had the same issue.

Yummy!  I took it to a luncheon and got many compliments.  I did have to cook it longer to get it to the consistency I wanted.  But, just keep cooking till you get it where you want.

Used skim milk. Started in the slow cooker but mixture had not budged after 3 hours on high. So I transferred to a pot and it went well from there! I cooked until thickened. I used the 3 eggs (room temp, added hot rice/milk mix into eggs first before combining into big pot). It is definitely creamy, almost custard, so 1 or 2 eggs may be sufficient. Added more vanilla. Thanks! Very similar to the restaurant style I was trying to recreate!

I've used this recipe dozens of times. It's just perfect! Three years ago we moved to a new house - - - and lost the recipe.  I was crestfallen.  I've torn my house apart looking for this recipe. I've  done a number of internet searches as well. Today I found you, on the 12th page of my search. Should have gone to allrecipes.com in the first place. Tomorrow I'll be making rice pudding.

I was looking for the recipe I used years ago and this seemed like the same one. I substituted lactose free milk otherwise I followed the directions given cooking it a few extra minutes at the end to thicken it. The rice mixture turned a light peach color before I added the egg, cinnamon etc. 
In the end I felt it was pasty rather than creamy and the color was not very appetizing.

After 40 years of searching for the creamiest rice pudding ,I have now found it ,thanks to Bonnie Q. Both my husband and I love this recipe!
I actually made it with 1% milk and it still was very creamy.
Since there are only two of us, I halved the recipe and added 2 eggs. Perfect results.

I can't stop making it!!!!! An absolutely DELICIOUS rice pudding recipe.  Yes, it takes a bit of stirring.  Just remember, the calories you burn making this allows you to eat EVEN MORE!! Haha!!!
I am in northern Wisconsin...every month there is a milk sale somewhere and you can get a gallon of whole milk for less than $2.  Today it was $1.48.......that means MORE rice pudding!

This recipe made a very thin rice soup ... even after refrigerating over night.  I'm going to try and recover by baking at 350 for 60 minutes.

I've tried several rice pudding recipes from Allrecipes and other sites and this one is BY FAR the best!! I actually like my rice pudding to be basically a custard with rice in it lol but this is real rice pudding. I followed other reviewers advice and made it in the crock pot but mine too 4 hours on low and never came to a boil so after 5 hours it was kinda runny but I added the room temp egg mixture anyway and waala! Perfection! It thickened up immediately,  almost too thick. To my egg mixture I used 2 T of vanilla paste and 1 extra egg. I did start with 6 C 2% milk and 2 C half & half and didn't add the sugar (I used 1 1/2 C sugar but it's a bit too sweet) til after I had cooked the rice fully. I will definitely make this again on the stove per the recipe next time. Deeeelish!

This was the creamiest rice pudding I have ever made and added to my list to make again.  However, I used medium-grain rice instead of long grain.

Very good recipe.. I am saddened to say this is better then the family recipe that was handed down to me from my Mother (God Rest her Soul)

I made a few minor adjustments:
1. When I combine milk, sugar, butter, and rice, I  blend briefly with no bubbles.

2: When i  combine eggs, milk, salt and vanilla, I also add 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.

3:  I bring the mixture to a light boil first, before starting  the 1 hour cooking time.

Followed directions and took advice on simmering longer & adding additional egg; still too runny. The flavor was good but, very disappointed in the consistency. I would probably add another 1/2 cup of rice.

Made it in the crockpot instead of on the top of the stove.  After the rice was cooked, I left the lid ajar for 20 minutes on high to boil off the excess moisture before adding eggs.  Then I just let it cook  for another 20 minutes stirring not constantly but frequently.

I decided to make this recipe, since it had so many stars and I had never made rice pudding before.  It was a charity and needed the following morning.

It turned out to be soupy and a disappointment.  The next time, I will use arborio or medium rice.  Long grain rice is not a favorite to make rice pudding according to most rice pudding recipes.

I found this recipe a couple years ago and it is my go to recipe for rice pudding now. We eat it warm since I never get a chance to chill it. Great for an evening snack as well as dessert. I usually add raisins, but sometimes  I add drained crushed pineapple (better chilled).  This recipe is so simple to make and it is delicious. It never lasts long in this house!!

Definitely one of the best rice puddings I've made. I followed the recipe, using short grain white rice.  I used whole milk to cook with the rice and heavy cream to mix with the eggs. The cream gave it a slightly "richer" texture. I prepared this in my largest Le Creuset pot, allowing plenty of room for even cooking. I simmered on medium low for at least an hour and stirred often to prevent sticking. The key to getting this perfect is cooking low and slow. Have patience. Added cinnamon at the end and sprinkled more on top for decoration. Second time around, I made a toasted coconut version. Delish!!!

I followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly. I did listen to the other reviewers and started my timer to cook for one hour after the milk started to boil. DELICIOUS!

gave it 4 because i knew it would need a few 'tweaks'.  since i used 1% milk, i added a T of butter at the start--though maybe not next time--not  sure it is really necessary.  it definitely needs more than 1 hour AFTER bringing to a boil--just cook to desired thickness, irrespective of how long it takes.  i also used 1 1/4C rice, and added a cinnamon stick st the beginning, and a cup of raisins after 1/2 hour (husband's preference).   and, yes, let the eggs come to room temp--also better to temper--and DO NOT cook for more than 2 minutes after adding them--i didn't even--just stirred.  NEVER use imitation vanilla (it's made from petroleum)  ALWAYS use REAL vanilla extract.  o, and 1/4t of nutmeg.   wonderful!!!

I followed this recipe loosely, in that I used all the ingredients called for, but didn't measure them and adjusted the amount of each to my taste (e.g. less sugar, less egg, forgot the salt, etc). It turned out tasty and creamy, as promised. I also made this in my rice cooker, which was convenient :D

Delicious as written. I was looking for a great rice pudding recipe that would be as good as the one my mom use to make.  I first tried a different recipe on this site that had 4K+ good reviews, it was just fine.  THIS recipe is superb!

The rice pudding my mother made was a favorite of mine as a child.   I lost her recipe but this is very close to what I remember.   My first attempt never thickened as others stated.   After thinking about it it came to me....don't use Quick Rice!!   The ratio of liquid to rice is 1:1 for quick rice but 2:1 regular long grain rice.  This is why it didn't thicken for me the first time.  My second attempt using regular rice was PERFECT!  I did add a few things I remember from my mothers recipe:  2 sticks of cinnamon to the milk and rice as you cook it.  It can be left in or removed after cooking is done.   Mix a little sugar into the cinnamon you sprinkle on the top.  Using a double boiler works great to keep  it from burning and cuts down the stirring time.  To make it extra creamy mix heavy cream into the egg mixture.

This turned out excellent! I used a real vanilla bean during the 60 minute cooking time, then just used 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract when I added the egg mixture later on- I also tempered the egg mixture as someone else suggested by adding a few scoops of the milk/rice mixture to the eggs and stirred them continuously before adding them back into the pot so they didn't scramble.  I used Basmati rice because that's what I had on hand, so I had to rinse and soak that ahead of time. Between the vanilla bean and the basmati rice, it had such a creamy nutty flavor, it was delicious. I read lots of the reviews before making it and one thing to definitely do is make sure your mixture is the consistency of pudding that you want (hence the 60-80 minute cooking time) before you add the egg for the last two minutes because it will be the same consistency in the morning that it was when you took it off the stovetop.  I also brought it just to a boil before turning it down to simmer for the hour. I'd give this 10 stars!!

This turned out perfectly as-is. Some adjustments I've made over the few times I have made it is adding a little banana, or some extra vanilla, or some chocolate powder if my partner wants some - but it really is delicious as the recipe originally has it! Five out of five.

This is my favorite easy and cheap dessert! As a college student, using some of my 20 lbs bag of rice for dessert is really nice! This is super creamy, and really yummy! I add a bit extra sugar, about half a cup, for my sweet tooth!

This was exactly what I was looking for in a rice pudding!  Made it tonight for Christmas.   I missed the part to simmer covered.  It still came out perfect uncovered.  I only had short grain Goya rice. Added an extra 1/4 cup rice.  Once it starts to thicken, keep a close eye because it thickens fast as it cooks down.  It came out thick, creamy and delicious.   My Pop is going to be in heaven when he sees I made him rice pudding for the holiday!  Thank you very much for the perfect stovetop recipe!  HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

This recipe is one like my mom made when I was growing up.  What a treat.  I used the tricks others have suggested with some of the extra engrediants like raisins.  I also used pumpkin spice which has all the components I like in one spice.  I will make this again and have already shared it with others.  To me, this  Is the ultimate comfort food. Thanks for sharing.

Who knew that making rice pudding could be so easy.  I read a few of the reviews before making it, which helped.  I brought the mixture to a boil before covering it.  It does require frequent stirring.  But I was very (VERY) happy with the end result.

I've  been making this for years. Friends and family are always requesting it. It's the best I've ever tasted. It takes time to cook but otherwise very easy. Recently I've begun using Jasmine rice which pleasantly  enhances the flavor. I also add an extra 1/2 cup of sugar per requests for a slightly sweeter taste. Thank you so much for such a fantastic recipe. It's  a keeper.

I made a  gigantic batch for a family member's repast.  So delicious! Adding a little extra cinnamon gives it a kick! If you follow the directions carefully, each batch of rice pudding will come out fine.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added an extra egg and cooked it after the egg mixture addition.  I chose this recipe because the rice was cooked in milk instead of water but it was too much milk for only 1 cup of rice. I also ended up with cooked egg white.  I did like the homemade taste.  If I make this again, I will use less milk and only egg yolks.

Very good and yes it's creamy!  I had no problem with it setting up but you definitely have to bring it to a boil before turning it to a simmer for an hour.  It took roughly 20 minutes to get it  to boil on that low-medium heat.  I used 1/2 1% regular milk and 1/2 rice milk since I needed to use them up;  the setting was no problem but the flavor was just a wee bit off - maybe more vanilla next time.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used about 1/2 cup cream and the rest 2% milk. It came out thick and delicious after the prescribed hour of simmering. It tasted like a cold, creamy cinnamon roll. YUM. The only thing I will change next time is a reduction of the sugar to 3/4 cup. It was a bit too sweet for me. Why so many reviewers on this site recommend even more sugar, I can't imagine.

when on the second step with the egg,milk,vanilla, and salt mitxture I find that if after letting sit for 10 min, you add the mixture and slowly bring it up to almost a boil while stirring the entire time over roughly 5-7 min. good work out. once it reaches boil lower heat and stir for another min or two and remove from heat stirring more and follow the rest of the steps.

Excellent! Like other reviewers have said, I needed to cook the rice mixture longer than an hour to get it to thicken enough. Next time I will probably cook it longer as it still came out not quite as thick as I'd like, but it's definitely worth all the work you need to put into it :)

I've made this pudding twice now. The first time is was great except I thought I should add the salt to the milk, sugar, and rice while cooking because the rice seemed bland. The second time, I added the salt in the beginning and it flavored the rice perfectly. Only problem was that I somehow made egg flower pudding instead of a thick and creamy pudding base. It was even more disappointing since it was a double batch for a potluck. Looks like we'll be eating rice pudding for weeks to come...not that that is such a terrible thing.

I was so excited to make this for my husband. I followed the instructions to a T. I even cooked it for 25 min more. Because I thought it was also too thin. But being Iv never made Rice Pudding before. I let it sit till room temp. Shook my cinnamon on. Wrapped and placed in the refrigerator. I woke this morning to a liquid. So disappointed. It did take a long time. Wish there was someway of fixing it. If there are any suggestions it would make my day.

Skeptical about how much better this would be than the others I've tried given the time this takes, but glad I did! Wow.  I did add the extra sugar, very nice addition.  As my daughter replied upon tasting it..."the others tasted like rice with pudding in it, this tastes like pudding with rice in it," said with a dreamy grin.  Well put.

My husband loves rice pudding but I'm not a fan so I usuallly don't buy it or make it. This recipe seemed easy and it was. My whole family loved it. Even me! I used 4 eggs as recommended by another review. We nice and creamy.

I have been looking for a rice pudding recipe for years and haven't found a good one.  I finally found it!  This is just like my grandmothers.  Creamy and delicious.  A bit time consuming but well worth it.

I followed the recipe to the letter, I also read the "Most Helpful Positive Review". I did cook longer than the 2minutes on the last step. We like thick pudding in this house. Delicious recipe! I will be making this again.

Very easy.  I added cinnamon sticks to the milk while it cooked.  Then added raisins during the egg/milk addition.

I found this recipe by searching for Horn & Hardart rice pudding which I loved growing up in NYC.  After reading reviews I decided to go slow cooker route.  Followed recipe exactly at the beginning as far as ingredients.  First got milk warm in cooker on high.  Stirred in rice & sugar.  Left on high for 3 hours, stirring every 1/2 hour.  Then I looked at it and seemed a little loose.  I left lid to cooker a little ajar and let cook another 1/2 hour.  Then mixture got thicker.  Tempered in 2 eggs to 1/4c half & half, 2 teaspoons of vanilla and stirred in to rice mixture very well.  Reduced heat to medium on slow cooker and cooked another 20 minutes.  Shut off cooker and I stirred in some raisins which I plumped in boiling water.  Horn & Hardarts rice pudding had raisins.  Put mixture in a disposable aluminum tray on a sheet pan.  A little cinnamon on top.  Then put plastic wrap directly on top of mixture.  I let it cool about 40 minutes and then put it in fridge.  First thing I did when I woke up today was sampled it.  OMG this was PERFECT, CREAMY and absolutely DELICIOUS.
I would suggest a slow cooker, because it is a no brainer controlling heat where you risk scorching on a cook top.

Made this for the first time.  Mine got thicker when it sat. I did use 1/4 cup of heavy cream instead of the milk. My father said it's better than ice cream.

I just tried this recipe for the first time but followed a woman's review that used a crockpot. It turned out great! A lot easier than standing over a pot and stirring. She also advised viewers to use 1/3 cup more sugar; I couldn't imagine it with less sugar. I used 1 pint half and half and the rest 2% milk. Also, when adding the eggs, I put approx. 4 teaspoons of hot mixture into the eggs, 1/4 cup heavy cream, vanilla bean paste and a bit of cinnamon, then added to the rest off the mixture. I had the crock on low, went shopping with my husband and when I came home, it was done. Nice and fluffy, I believe, from the heavy cream. So I took the basic recipe, added a good bit of one of the reviewer's suggestions then tweaked it to my tastes and to what I had on hand. If you like raisins, they would taste great mixed in also. I prefer to have it plain.  -Judy S.

I made this recipe tonight and it was OMG good!!! I tweeked it a bit though. I used 2 cans of coconut milk(27oz in total) and the rest, I used fat free half and half. I also used 2 vanilla beans, which I scraped and used the vanilla with the egg mixture. I used medium grain uncooked rice and 1 1/2 cups of sugar for extra sweetness. For the egg mixture, I used 1/4 cup of heavy cream instead of regular milk. This came out so creamy! My son, who does NOT like rice pudding at all, couldn't stop eating this. Its definitely a keeper.

My husband is a huge rice pudding fan - and this recipe has made the top of the list! I love that it's no-bake too so it's great to make year round without having to heat the house up with the oven.

It is very time consuming but worth it for sure!! I took advise from some of the other comments and tweeked it even more to my liking though. I like mine a little thinner ( not a fan of the thick pudding like cozy shack brand) so what I used was 1/2 gallon of milk, 1 cup of rice, and 1 1/2 cups of sugar. After boiling this for a good hour and a half on med low heat I took it off the heat for 10 min or so then added 1 egg dash of salt a splash of milk, 4 Tbs vanilla and 2Tbs cinnamon. I put the original rice mixture back on the heat and added the egg mixture to that and cooked it on med for 15 min. It will thicken a little after you take it off the stove to cool but I like it thin so I take it off while it is still a bit runny. The original recipe is great if you like the custard type of rice pudding but if you like it thinner like me it only takes those few tweeks. The biggest rule to making rice pudding. And I cannot stress it enough is Do Not walk away from it while boiling. You cannot let it scorch. It will be ruined even if only one grain of rice burns!!! So be patient and stir very often and you will not regret it. I never made rice pudding before I read this recipe so if it is your first time as well relax. lol and enjoy!!!

We plan on making this today. I'm assuming it's supposed to say 1/4 cup milk and a 1/2 cup milk in the ingredients. Then in the directions, I think it should say 1/2 cup milk instead of 1/2 gallon milk! If that doesn't work out, I'll let you know.

If you like rice pudding, you will love this recipe!  I made it last week for the family and they loved it.  We had some from a restaurant the other night and it didn't compare.  My family voted and this recipe won hands down...and so now I need to make more--KH

I am so bummed out!  I made this recipe for my adult son who isnt feeling well and loves rice pudding.  It was soupy and nothing at all like 
pudding. I read every review and cooked it for 90 min. Tempered the egg mixture and everything. I am so disappointed.

Adding a cooking tip.  Use a big saucepan AND put that into a bigger saucepan.  By cooking the pudding a "double boiler" you completely eliminate the boil over mess.  A receipt note: if you want to add raisins plump them in a microwave in oj, fresh is best.  This is a great pudding.

I added a bit more rice than what the recipe calls for, it started out too soupy. I added nutmeg and more cinnamon also. To say it was a hit would be an understatement!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I made half a batch, using whole milk and jasmine rice, and cooked it close to 90 minutes at barely simmering. I also cooked it a couple minutes after adding the egg (I like knowing the eggs are cooked). It knocked our socks off. I made it the next day substituting 25% cream for milk, and it was equally good, but not better. It was all gone before I had a chance to sprinkle it with cinnamon! This is the epitome of comfort food.

This was perfect. I doubled the recipe as I was bringing it to an event. I've only made rice pudding a few times over the years, and it always seems like there should be more rice when you're making it, but then it kind of explodes...Do have to watch, and stir...good thing to make when you are doing other things in the general vicinity. Stirred it every 8 to 10 minutes. The double recipe made 5 quarts of rice pudding. The sweetness would have been perfect for me, but I was bringing it to a kid event, so I added a little sugar at the end and stirred in. Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.
8/19/14 Just made it again for an event. Great recipe. I did want to note that the cooking time isn't totally accurate. It takes awhile for the milk to reach a simmer, you have to do it slowly so the milk doesn't scorch, then you should start timimg your hour of simmering after that. This time I needed to add 10 minutes to the simmering for a total of 70. Still delicious.

I've been making this recipe for years or one very similar.  Instead of 3 eggs I used 2.  I also used 2 cups of cream and the rest regular 2%.  Never used cream before but made it extra creamy and rich and of course more calories....

It came out perfect!  It has become a family favorite. I did add one extra egg as suggested on other reviews, it made it very creamy and rich.  Love it!

First time making rice pudding. Thought it sounded simple enough, but I also ended up with rice soup and followed directions exactly.   Was going to take it to a church dinner, but what a waste of time.  Will see if I can salvage it by putting it in the crock pot and cooking it for longer.  What a bummmer!

If you follow this recipe exactly, you will end up with a very delicious soup, not a pudding. I've made this 3 times and here are my modifications: use 50 ounces of milk instead of 64. Use whole milk. You will need slightly more than one cup of rice, approximately 1 and 1/8 cup. You'll have the most success if you use Alborio rice rather than long grain rice. Definitely bring the milk, rice, and sugar to a boil before you turn down the heat. Only turn down the heat to 3 or 4, if you go any lower, the pudding will not thicken. It may need to simmer for more than an hour, you won't want to remove it from the heat until it has reached a thick consistency. If it still looks liquidey, it needs more time. Once I remove my milk mixture from the heat, I add a few tablespoons of brown sugar.

Too thin. Going to try and put it in the crock pot and see if it helps thicken it up. Not happy.  Even set the timers in the kitchen to make sure it turned out.

I love this recipe. Like others recommended I added a little more rice, and brought it to a boil before simmering. It simmered for 90 minutes before it was thick. I did add raisins to the milk mixture and cinnamon to the egg mixture. It is a keeper recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe is amazing. Don't rush the simmering, it takes about 15-20 minutes to come to proper simmer, THEN start the 60 mins on the clock. Worth the constant attention. Believe me. The only thing I did off recipe was temper the eggs before adding them back into the rice mixture. With my luck the eggs would have cooked, so I decided not to risk it. Glad I didn't. This is the most creamy, velvety rice pudding. Delish.

Really loved this recipe! It turned out great, I used a generic long grain white rice and used 1 1/2 cups as someone had recommended. I also used low fat milk and it turned out good. Added 1/2 cup raisins near the end before putting the egg mix in. I would not cover with plastic wrap after it cools as this seems to keep too much moisture in, we like it a bit thicker with that crust that forms on top. All in all we will make this again, and pass along the recipe to friends!

OMG!  This is fabulous! Tastes as good as the Kozy Shack brand found at the grocery store.  The only changes I made was halving the recipe (i'm the only one in the family that loves rice pudding...more for me yeah). and added 1/2 cup of raisins after stirring in the egg mixture.  So easy and delicious.  Thanks so much!

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!! This is by far the best rice pudding recipe I've ever had. Talk about going back for seconds!! I now reject my own mother's recipe!! However, I do a few things differently. Like another reviewer suggested, I boil the milk, sugar, and rice before the one hour cooking time. I use whole milk because it makes the finished result creamier. I also let the egg mixture reach room temperature because it mixes in better that way. Also, the pudding will not get thicker in the fridge. You have to cook it until it reaches the consistency you want. This recipe tastes good hot or cold. I make this about twice a month now. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! I changed to make 35 servings and made it exactly except my eggs looked small so I added 1 and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead to mix with eggs  what a treat.

I replaced the cow's milk with almond milk which added a great extra dimension of flavor.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and ground clove...WOW!

This is one of the best rice pudding I ever ate. My GG(great grandma) use to make it just like this. Who can wait for it to cool. Bring to a boil first and then cook for the hour and bring eggs & milk out at that time to bring them up to room temp.

Absolutely love this recipe. So easy to make. The only thing I changed was I used half the white sugar it called for and then in the egg mixture I added the other half of the sugar but I used brown sugar. So so good.

I loved this! Thank you for sharing. Once you add the egg mixture and stir it thickens as you stir. I even ate it warm before it set in the the fridge overnight. It is yummy.

Tried making this with brown rice, with fresh raspberries and sliced almonds added. Needless to say, it came out fantastic! Incredibly rich and creamy!

Loved it! Cooked with half a gallon of milk, 1 1/3 cup rice, and 1 1/3 cup sugar. Simmered for an hour, then uncovered it and kept simmering it on medium/low for about another 10 minutes because too much milk was soupy and unabsorbed, even though the rice was pretty much cooked. The milk did create a film on the top layer, but I removed the film when it did. Then did the other ingredients, stirred for 2 minutes, and it came out very creamy and perfectly sweet! Amazing, will definitely make this again!

AMAZING!!!  I read reviews ahead of time and they helped.  Cooked over med-hi until almost bubbling being careful not to scorch.  Then reduced to med-lo and cooked about 45 mins.  It thickened up nicely on the stove but kept forming a skin if I'd leave it for more than a few minutes so I'd just peel it off and discard, and the end result wasn't affected.  Made sure eggs/milk were at room temp and tempered with some of the rice mix first... had no problems with any "scramblage" whatsoever.  With recent Salmonella outbreaks in eggs all over the news. I wanted to be sure eggs were cooked and increased the heat to medium, stirring CONSTANTLY for 7-9 minutes.  YES, this recipe is time consuming... YES, your arm will be tired from stirring... BUT, it is oh sooooo SMOOTH & CREAMY!!!  A million times better than Kozy Shack, and that stuff ain't half bad =)  ***FOR EXTRA CREAMINESS: Do the half gallon of milk less a cup and a half, and add a can of evaporated milk.

OK no two rice puddings are alike I know, but I was still in search of this colombian restaurant version from Ga and this got me close! Theirs was like a cold cereal, I think if I wait until this cools and then add milk to make it runny it will be perfect. But as is I like it warm. I had less milk and boiled it with two vanilla beans. YUM. Only used two eggs with heavy cream at the end because I ran out of milk. Next time I will make with the milk like I said. This was a great-no-need-to-reinvent-the-wheel recipe :)

It was really watery after completing the entire recipe, so I made a slurry of 1 Tablespoon cornstarch and 1 Tablespoon cold water, stirring it well before adding to the pudding. I cooked it on low a little longer and it thickened up great. I also had a problem with it boiling over during the 1 hour even with the stirring, but it's hard to get the perfect temp on an electric stove. I gave it five stars because it was so delicious, I could live on it for a month. It might kill me, but that's a risk I'm willing to take.  :)

I have tried many rice pudding recipes. This one is the best by far. A bit time comsuming, but worth it. I used 2 large eggs instead of 3 and added some raisins. Really great!

Still like pudding withhout the eggs.  I added a banana that I pureed in the magic bullet with about ¼ cup heavy whipping cream to the first three ingredients.  I used white basmati rice (that’s what I had).  I cut the vanilla down to 1 teaspoon  I omitted the eggs     I cooked for about 12 hours when it was nice and thick I turn off and added only 1 teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon to taste.  My daughter can’t eat eggs and loves bananas this recipe was perfect for her.

This is my favorite rice pudding recipe, ever! Tips: definitely temper the egg/milk mixture before adding it to the rice mixture. Also, if you're considering doubling this recipe, DON'T! It makes the rice basically non existent, leaving no texture. BLECK! I cooked an additional 2 cups of rice with just water and added it to the pot which helped. Definitely didn't taste the same though.

This recipe is great. I used skim milk and it was still very creamy. I also added cinnamon just for taste. Mine did get thicker as it chilled in the fridge. Best rice pudding ever.

My husband said make this one from now on. I added mixed dry fruit and used leftover rice. This tasted best when first made but reheat fine for a short time in the microwave and I serve rice pudding with whipping cream poured on top. Yummy.

Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  It reminds me of a rice pudding  my sister used to get at a restaurant in Wilmington, Delaware.  The best rice pudding recipe "hands down"!

Yeeees, I agree with your husband. It is the creamiest I have tasted in a long time. Can be eaten with or without milk or cream. I followed the directions as written,except I put the final pudding in a casserole dish.

I just made this and it tastes absolutely fabulous.  However, it was really thin at the top.  I added 1/3 extra cup of sugar and tempered the egg mixture with some of the rice mixture before adding the egg mixture to the pot.  The only other variable that could have made a difference was that I used jasmine rice (which IS considered a long grain white rice).  I love the taste of jasmine rice so that's why I used it.  I will try again with the jasmine rice but I'll use more than the 1 cup listed.  I'll perfect this recipe using the jasmine rice because it tastes superb -- I shall not give up!!

Very good.  I had no problems making this and I have never made rice pudding before.  I threw in a stick of cinnamon while the mixture was simmering, added about 1 tsp more vanilla and one more egg and had to cook it about 10 extra minutes. I used 1% milk and it tastes great.  It has only been done for about 4 hours and I am already eating it!  Yummy, I will make this again.

WOW! This was fantastic! It was only slightly tiring to make--there is so much stirring that you can't really do anything that needs your sustained attention while making this pudding. Reminded me of Kozy Shack pudding--amazing!

Super yum in the crock pot.  Stir often and add eggs later.

Needed raisins!  Next time I will add!

This was super quick as far as rice pudding goes..My husband loved it. Other recipes might be a bit creamier, but not when made in this amount of time.

After returning the pot to the stove to cook for 2 mins, I found it needed probably a further 3-5 mins to really thicken up....otherwise a fantastic traditional recipe that my 11 month old son devoured with sliced banana enthusiastically!

I'd never had rice pudding before, maybe its how it's supposed to taste. But first I tried it cold and it's nasty. I heated it up and it's better & creamier. But still it seems to be lacking any depth of flavor. I even added extra cinnamon & some nutmeg to the egg mixture because from the recipe i didnt think that just the cinnamon on top would be enough. Perhaps I should've added more vanilla then called for. I wont be making this again.

I tried this recipe fpr the first time today.  I cut the recipe in half sice I'm the only person who eats it in my house.  The recipe turned out good the only thing was that it needed more than an hour to cook on simmer.  The next time I make it I would turn the flame to a low-medium flame.  Also I added raisins.  All in all its a great recipe.

This is almost like my great-aunt's recipe. Her's uses a stick of butter cooked with the milk & uses 6 eggs and 1 cup of raisins. She cooks the rice in 2 c. boiling water for 7 minutes & adds the milk & other ingredients as written in this recipe. I'm sure I'll love it this way too, but I still think hers is the best!

I was in a rush so I didn't boil the rice in milk.  i already had cooked brown rice I wanted to use.  I followed the recipe except i baked it in the oven which dried it out a little but got the top nice and crisp.  We added a little milk to it when it was in our bowls and still enjoyed it.

I found that the rice/milk/sugar mix only took about an hour from the time that it just started to simmer.  But I cut the recipe in half, so maybe that's why I didn't need 80 mins as others suggested.  The pudding is creamy and delicious, very flavorful.  I only gave it four stars instead of five since you really do have to have at least an hour free to just keep walking back to stir it every few minutes.  I will make it again but probably only for special occasions.

I made it according to the directions, and added raisins just a few minutes before I added the egg mixture. The pudding is delicious made with skim milk, no need for whole or cream.
I've also made the recipe without any sugar and my 18 month old daughter LOVES it!

This was the best rice pudding I ever had. It was the creamiest and the yummiest. The cooking time was a little longer and frequent stirring is required. I added few pods of crushed cardomom, and sprinkled cinnamom. Got so many requests for the recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This is the first time I have attempted to make rice pudding and it is absolutely delicious!  I was wise to follow tips from previous reviews.  The only mistake I make was answering the phone and forgetting about the simmering pot!  It boiled over but still came out great! (Keep flame very low). My co-workers all wanted the recipe. I will make this again for sure.

SOOOO Good the next day right out of the fridge. Yummy!! I cooked it until it thickened which took about two hours. I also cooked it a bit longer after adding the egg, b/c raw eggs are not so yummy. Not bad warm either. I'm sure it will be a hit for my Mother's Day desert tonight.

This recipe is so delicious! This is my second time making it. I used 1% milk with amazingly creamy results. It takes a while to get it to a simmer in the very beginning, but don't rush it. Also, don't start timing the one hour simmer time until AFTER it actually starts simmering.  It feels like it takes so long to cook because it smells so good you can't wait for it to be done!

I mistakenly cooked it longer than an hour and it thickened up perfectly!  I didn't have to use the egg mixture making the dish a little lighter.

I made this for my mom because rice pudding is her favourite, and she LOVED it.  I'm not a big fan of rice pudding, but even I liked it.  I cut down the recipe since it was only two of us, and I almost regret doing that.  I left the vanilla amount the same which gave it a nice taste.  I don't think my mom will allow me to give up this recipe.  I will definitly make it again.

Absolutely perfect!!!  I used Jasmine rice instead of white rice and it just added to the flavor.  Can't go wrong with this one!  Tastes like diner rice pudding.  This one's a keeper.

Out of 9 people, only one person liked it.  I don't like rice pudding, but I guess it was good for those that do like rice pudding.

Fantastic!  I made this for my husband as rice pudding is his favorite...I don't care for it...but I must say I matched him spoon for spoon on this recipe.  Who would have thought rice could taste so good? Thanks Bonnie!

Great, simple recipe, but I couldn't get it to thicken at first. Cooked an extra 15 minutes and it still wouldn't thicken. Had to return it to the pan and use an additional egg.

This is a fantastic recipe! I LOVE RICE PUDDING and this recipe is as close to my grandma's as anything! I tried different variations on the ingriedients such as using 1/2 the sugar (my mom's a diabetic) and cooking it longer (almost 2 hours), without eggs and while stirring almost continuously, clock and counter clockwise. Also, try adding cinnamon sticks to the mix - they add some extra goodness plus it's easy to get it out of the pot once you're ready to put it in dishes rather than adding powdered cinnamon.

Thank you, Bonnie Quinn!!  I have been looking for a recipe for a really good rice pudding like this ever since I got married 23 years ago, and now I've finally found the recipe that makes me happy!!  My husband thought it was the greatest too!  Thanks for submitting this!
