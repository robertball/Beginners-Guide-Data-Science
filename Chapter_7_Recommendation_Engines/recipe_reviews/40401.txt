I also made it with a tea bag. Added more water. Didn't have the stick cinnamon or cloves so just used a bit of cinnamon sprinkled on top.

This is a nice recipe.  I would change one thing however, that is to use Whisky instead of Whiskey.  Being Scottish myself, it just has to be... :)

I really think there may be an error in this recioe.  I was using an ordinary 8 oz drinking cup so I made this with water amount 6 oz.  Otherwise, this is a decent recipe.  I have the flu and made it tonight, it was very easy to make.

I followed the advise of two other raters - larger quantities & used tea as my base liquid. I made the Christmas Spice Tea really strong and added a little more whiskey to it. After the first two, I didn't care about my cough anymore! LOL. I was just angry to discover that I'd been making this for years but withour as much whiskey in the recipe! LMAO!!

Great recipe, but I changed one very important thing- I added a tea bag in the first step. I used orange spice tea, but I hear earl grey is pretty good, too.  This gives the Toddy a bit more flavor, so it doesn't taste like hot, watered down whiskey. I also used burbon, and it warmed me right up!

I'm feeling the first signs of a sore throat, so I wanted a hot drink.  This was very tasty.  I didn't have whiskey so I used Rum instead.  This only fills up about 1/5th of a coffee mug though.  If you want to fill the mug, you'll need to multiply the ingredients by five (that should knock you out for the night!) or else add a lot more water.

Many years ago I had a nasty cold that wouldn't quit. Grandpa gave me this recipe and told me to drink it sitting in a hot tub of water. Then dry off quickly and get into a warm bed and cover up with a down comforter and not throw the covers off. Boy, did I sweat that night. By morning the sheets were soaked, but my cold was gone! Now my wife has a nasty cold so I'm off to start boiling water. Cheers.

These are great for sore throats and the flu (or whatever else is ailing you). I leave out the cloves - personal preference.  Bourbon works well in a pinch if you don't have whiskey.  I got sick right after Thanksgiving and this was the only thing that gave me any relief.  My husband thought these were gross, that is until he got sick shortly after and wanted me to make him one.......

Pretty classic, although the cinnamon and nutmeg not so much. Honey, stud the lemon slice with the whole cloves (keeps them contained in the lemon so they're not floating where you might drink one), whiskey (bourbon is tasty), and hot water.

I know it sounds strange but my father used to give me a hot toddy for woman problems and it did the trick every time.  It gets rid of a nasty cold quickly.  It is great as a relaxing night cap or for self medicating though that is an every now and then thing.

Jack Daniels is the cure all.  I've always made this with a full cup of hot tea instead of 2 ounces of boiling water, in the past.  However I like to follow a recipe as close as possible when rating it and I followed this one to the letter.  It is awesome!  I love the taste.  (To be honest I probably wouldn't drink it without a sore throat, but it tastes great against my sore throat.  I topped mine off with two moonshine cherries (cherries soaked in moonshine) and I feel great.

Oh My!  

Definitely cleared up my sinuses - works almost as well as NyQuil.  I don't think I'd drink this for pleasure, but I'll give it two thumbs up for medicinal purposes.

I used this recipe for a really sore throat, and I used a spicy tea bag along with it. I didn't have a cinnamon stick, so used 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon and left out the lemon. Next time I think I'll use either apple cider or apple juice. I'm happy to report that my sore throat is gone! :)

I didn't like this much my first try, but being a whiskey fan I thought I'd give it a couple tweaks - mainly making it with hot tea rather than water, and a liberal douse of honey, and it was divine!

Use this when I feel a cold/cough coming on. I brew a regular sized cup of decaf tea and leave a little room at the top. Then I add the juice of 1/2 a lemon, honey, and whiskey - I am not a big fan of the flavor of whiskey so go light on that, probably use a half of a shot glass. Very soothing and relaxing on a rainy night!

I was so skeptical, but after having numerous sinus infections in the past 5 years, and annoying cough spells from my horrible environmental allergies, I had to try an alternative. Nothing OTC works for me and none of the prescription meds help either. I just made this for the first time and I can breathe out of both nostrils, my ears aren't clogged anymore, and I'm not coughing for once. It made my chest and sinuses feel so much better!I'm thrilled and can kick myself in the butt for not trying this sooner!!

I used this to help knock out a cold this winter and enjoyed it so much I'm continuing to use it - just in case.  I think RAW honey is an important thing to try and get so you get all the enzymes.  But, don't boil it and kill the good stuff.  It's hard to find and sometimes costs more but see if it makes a difference for you.

I like to make the water recipe but I also had juice from a fresh orange and 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla. I also add brown sugar and a cinamon stick like another user suggested. It always helps me feel better and get some sleep!

I made this with tea instead of just hot water, I'm not a fan of watered down whisky. Didn't have lemons so I used lemon tea instead. It was delicious. My throat feels great and I'm nice and toasty warm. I would definitely make this again

This drink is the silver lining of getting sick. It's soothing, great-tasting, and knocks me out within 20 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the suggestion in an earlier comment and used tea instead of water.  I happened to have 'gingerbread' herbal tea, and so I omitted the spices, which simplified the recipe for me.  We enjoyed it and will make it again.  Thanks for the inspiration!

Made me feel better, but that was probably the alcohol.  Since I'm not a big fan of whiskey, I used Spiced Rum.  It was really good!  I did squeeze the juice from the lemon slice into the drink after letting it steep for five minutes.  I think I may add a green tea bag next time just for the health benefit!

Excellent (but potent) as written.  Personal preference- I added 1 batch as written to 6ish ounces strong tea with a little extra honey.

Liked this, although I've always preferred to make my hot toddy's with tea, and brandy with a tablespoon or two of honey and a teaspoon of lemon juice.  I usually do about 6 ounces of boiling water with the tea bag and 1 1/2 oz of brandy for my wife and 2 oz for me :) Very soothing and very tasty.

Didn't have whiskey so used vanilla rum and a hit of orange liqueur, on top of a constant comment green tea bag. Honestly I've been blowing my nose all day so after a few sips, not feeling tipsy, but the heat is helping to clear stuff out. I'm sure I'll sleep well tonight! thanks for the post

For those trying to combat a cold and sore throat I recommend 2 oz bourbon, 1 fresh, juiced lemon, 1.5 Tbs pure maple syrup, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and 4-6 oz boiling water. 
Cheers

As an Irishwoman.... A little tweak. We use the same amount of whiskey (preferably Powers or Jameson) but use 1 teaspoon of white sugar Instead of the honey.  One slice of lemon with the cloves pushed through the lemon, hot water, not boiling, and enjoy!

It did nothing for my stuffy nose but after drinking the hotty toddy (and no I'm not drunk and I do know how to spell the title of this drink), I sure didn't care about it. Goodnight ya'll! Oh wait. I did modify after tasting the final results, which tasted like watered down whiskey. I made hot tea and combined the 2 drinks. Served with "Fresh Pea Soup," "Italian Peas," "Fried Broccoli," "Pumpkin Seed Beer Brittle," and "Ham and Cheese Bowties."

Followed the recipe, except started with a Tazo lemon tea bag and used Evan Williams honey bourbon.  Delicious.  Save yourself some  extra work.  Just make a double to start with.  Still have a cold, but I am feeling better  ; )

I had a friend who used to make this for me. I never really knew how to make it but I had some whiskey around the house and somehow I seem to have caught a cold. Thanks to this recipe I was able to get a little bit of an old friend and a little bit of warmth back. I really hope this works is great as her recipe did, but I am sure that it is really good and it was definitely worth making.

I just made this toddy to help me get rid of this sickness I've had all weekend, and I gotta say it feels nice going down my sore throat. I popped a tea kcup in my keurig  and brewed the large size cup, which I believe is 8-9 oz.  I added honey, 2 oz of jack Daniels, a few whole cloves, dash of cinnamon and nutmeg and had to use my bottled lemon juice since I had none on hand. Adjusted the honey and lemon to taste and it was perfection!  Hoping I feel better in the morning.

I would make it again. 

I used Stash brand Chai tea as the base, instead of plain water. 3 cloves, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 tablespoon honey, 2 teaspoons lemon juice, 2.5 tablespoons bourbon (I don't have regular whiskey around).

It's definitely potent, but good. I think I'm developing a cold, and I hear people drink thes for that. I can see why!

Wow! Great Christmas drink for a cold night by the fireplace. Great proportions. One shot of water microwaved for 45 sec,  then mix a shot of whiskey. Used sprinkles of the spices (2 light sprinkles for cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves). No cinnamon sticks on hand. The honey and lemon were great for the sinuses too, smooth going down. Highly recommend! Used with Crown Royal and Maker's  Mark. Preferred with makers.

I changed this up a little bit from the original recipe. I did 8oz of hot water, 1 1/2 oz of jack daniels honey, 2 tbl spoons of honey, a dash of cinnamon, and a lemon slice. I can't taste the jack which was the whole point for me. The honey and lemon together make the drink taste awesome. I will be making this again.

Sublime recipe when you have that scratchy throat "think I'm coming down with something" feeling, or need a winter's night panacea. I add a little extra honey, and some extra hot water, but otherwise perfect as is.

This really worked to soothe a nagging cough. Also good with brandy. I used more the second time I tried, may try the tea bag as well.

I am currently sick as a dog. My Dad used to make these when we were sick, though I used to think they were nasty back then. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used Blackberry brandy instead of whiskey. It’s Delish! Hoping this “cures” what ailed me. Thank you!!!

It turned out great but you have to be bit careful with the measurements of water and whiskey and honey, as a miscalculation in any three can lead very different tastes. I will definitely make it again.

This is a powerful drink! I used Good Scottish whisky, 12 year old Glenmorangie! I didn’t have a cinnamon stick so I used a tea bag with cinnamon in it and closed it up with a twist tie and hung it in the drink over the rim of the glass. It did help my sore throat and I slept pretty good too!

We used Apple Crown instead of regular whiskey so it was more like a grown up apple cider. It was really good and cleared us both right up.

I used a decaf green tea with the water. I just realized I only used 1 oz of whiskey (Jameson) instead of 1 1/2, and it was still good. I was feeling a little under the weather, and this helped.

Made these by the recipe before and it's very good. Had a sore throat and was super tired on a very rainy day today so I kicked it up a notch and it was sooo good!! 1 peppermint tea bag 1 chamomile tea bag, 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie seasoning, 1 tsp honey, a long slice of tangerine rind, a dash of cayenne and two shot glasses of smoky scotch... Very strong an soothing and perfect

This was perfect. I doubled the honey, water and whiskey (I used brandy), and just added a dash of cinnamon since I didn't have sticks. I also removed the lemon and cloves after five mins so it wouldn't be too strong when I got to the bottom. It turned out great and my throat feels much better. I recommend having one just before bed to help you sleep.

A cold is in progress, knew I needed something special. Altered the recipe a bit. Used bottled lemon juice, a couple of Tbsp. Did away with the Clove. Used Honey whiskey. And threw in a Celestial Seasoning Bengal Spice tea bag. Someone should patent this stuff. it is so good!!!!

Best Hot Toddy I ever made!  I love cinnamon and nutmeg. I didn't have sticks, so I just used regular cinnamon. I also didn't use honey but maple syrup instead! Oh...plus spiced rum for me a whiskey for my hubby. So good!  My throat is warmed from all the spices and rum.  I may have to make another.

This is a very strong Hot Toddy recipe.  I recommend if you drink this (especially if sick) to be ready to crawl into bed to drink this and stay in bed, do NOT go outside or try to do anything after you drink it if it's cold weather especially.  Do not walk the dog after, just go to bed.
