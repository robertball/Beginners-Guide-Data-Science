I don’t know why we made this because I did not expect to like it.  I waned something with Quinoa, I guess.
It was a surprise for both of us, WE LOVED IT!
I used canned chicken from Costco and just dumped everything in the slow cooker for 8 hours.  I did put it on high for about the first 1/2 hour.
It is just the two of us but we always make a full receipe and freeze the rest in 2-meal sized containers.
We are having it for dinner avain tonight.
Thanks for a delicious dinner.

Didn't take a picture because it didn't last long enough! Excellent and healthy. Everyone from six to sixty loved it... Only thing I did was use canellini beans instead of kidney beans because that was what I had...yum!

This recipe was so yummy! I used chicken that I pulled off of a rotisserie chicken and used cannellini beans instead of red kidney beans because I just prefer them. My hubby and I loved this, my 4yo ate hers, and the 2yo took 3 bites which is a miracle. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this and it is quite delicious! I did add 1/2tbs cumin to mine along with Mrs dash onion and herb seasoning bc I didn't have what they asked for. I also cooked it on low for 12 hours bc I did not precook my chicken. I added an extra serving of minced garlic. And I used Mrs dash table blend and original blend, just sprinkled in. So with all those little bits of tweaking it came out very delicious!!

I like all of these ingredients, but this just didn't do it for me. I am really not sure why. Nothing was horrible about it but for some reason the flavors just didn't meld into what I was hoping for

Needed to use up some sweet potatoes and loved most of the other ingredients.  Didn't really want to use kidney beans but my family always laughs because I say I made the recipe exactly the way it was written, except for...  Thought I would give it a try with exact ingredients.  We loved it.  There are just the two of us so there is plenty for three meals.  I did put the crock pot on high for two hours and then turned to low so it would be ready when we wanted to eat.  I would probably add 1/2-1 tsp of red pepper flakes because we like it spicy.  My grandchildren would eat it like it was prepared and we were expecting them.  Definitely added to my list of tasty, easy to prepare, and crock pot meals.

I found this kind of running and bland the first time so I doubled the quinoa and spices, PERFECT!

Tasty and super easy to make. I sub out a can of the kidney beans for garbanzo beans and added more garlic! Sweet potatoes added such a great flavor and texture.

This dish was delicious! I used ome can of light and one can of dark kidney beans, and plain diced tomatoes because that's what I had in hand. Other than that, I followed the written recipe. I would make it again!

I really liked the depth of flavor this dish. I substituted pumpkin for the tomatoes and red potatoes instead of sweet potatoes.  Add 1/2 a tablespoon of ground organic turmeric to create a little more intense taste. Also, I decided to include 2 cups of fresh spinach that we had in the refrigerator. It is great finding a crockpot recipe with quinoa. Definitely preparing this hearty meal again!

Was a bit hesitant to make this due to some of the past reviews as it was described as fairly bland but have to say my husband and I found it DELICIOUS!  I used a rotisserie chicken from a local grocery store, added more garlic and let is simmer all day until most of the liquid had absorbed.  We we surprisingly pleased.  A "comfort food" in my book.

This was great.  I'm a grad student and this gave me dinner for about 5-6 nights.  It was even great after freezing/thawing/reheating.  I have a smaller crockpot so next time I'm going to use less kidney beans to add more sweet potato.

I enjoyed this dish but it could have used more seasoning. Sweet potato doesn't need long to cook. Next time I'll add it much later. it was very good the first day but the leftovers were a bit mushy. Still an excellent, guilt-free meal.

While this is a strange combination of ingredients, I was looking to try something new and had all the items on hand, so I gave it a shot. It turned out to be a hit with my family!  As usual, I modified a bit but kept it pretty close to original.  

I did start with frozen chicken breast, thaw just enough to cube with a butcher’s knife, then dump everything in my Instant-Pot, stir, and pressure cook for 20 minutes.  Quick release the pressure and it was perfect!

 I think I’m getting the hang of this pressure-cooking thing! Talk about saving time!
Thanks for the unusual recipe!

This recipe--as it is wonderfully written--has my 3 essentials: tasty, healthy and easy. Best of all, it freezes well. I first tried this recipe back in 2014. It cycles through our meal rotation at least monthly and gets raves reviews when I share with friends. I don't think I've ever reviewed a recipe on this site (which I use ALL the time), but this recipe deserves attention!

Chock-full of protein, and a new twist on the standard chili or taco soup I tend to make with some of the same ingredients.

This was really good. I couldn't find the garlic-and-oil diced tomatoes, so used plain. Some reviewers wrote that it was too soupy. I drained and squeezed out the liquid from the diced tomatoes. That may have helped, as my final product had just enough liquid left. The sweet potatoes were tender after only five hours.

This is quite good.  I didn't have that type of diced tomatoes, so I used a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of Rotel.  I also only used 1 can of kidney beans.  I doubled the quinoa and the seasonings, and I used raw chicken breast and just let it cook in there all day and then shredded it before serving.  Great meal, very filling and it makes a TON!

Meh. This was ok, but a little bland. Also, based on the description, I expected it to be a bit thicker and more stew-like, but instead it turned out to be much closer to a soup. I'm not sure what modifications I'd suggest, but it definitely needs more spices than what the recipe calls for.

This was one of the most wretched things I've made in a long time.  I actually apologized to my family, and promised not to make it again.  

I actually love all the components, not sure how they managed to taste so horrible together.  Blech.

I cut this recipe in half because it only needed to feed two of us.  It made plenty!  I cut the red pepper because I'm a wimp, but otherwise I followed it exactly.  It was wonderful as written, but when topped with feta and sour cream, it was absolutely delicious!

Loved this!  I doubled the recipe and couldn't fit it in my largest crock pot, so I used a stock pot and cooked it until the sweet potatoes were soft.  Great flavor and even better as left-overs!
