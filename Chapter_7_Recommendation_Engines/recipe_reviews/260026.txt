Since the recipe calls for almond extract I decided to use almond milk instead of skim milk. I also substituted Truvia for the sugar. It was tasty.

I liked this! The almond flavoring really comes through, making it taste like a flavored coffeehouse coffee. I used stevia rather than sugar and saved a few calories. This is a good recipe for left-over coffee from the pot.

Easy and yummy. Don't really like the almond extract, so i used half. Subbed with whole milk.
Also if u ever have extra coffee, (instead of dumping it out) pour it into an ice tray and freeze. 
That way your coffee won't dilute as ice cubes melt! :)
