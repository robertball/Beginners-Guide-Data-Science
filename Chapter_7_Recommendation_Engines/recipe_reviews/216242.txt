This was good.  I used fresh sweet potatos and fresh apples.

This is very good.  I don't care for yams but this recipe is not over sugared.  I use this for potlucks and everyone loves it.  The only thing I change is I drain the yams.  Its too much liquid and makes it hard to transport.  Reserve the yam liquid until you see how moist its going to be.  I use apple pie filling for the sliced apples.

This is a great quick and easy side dish!  I am not a huge fan of canned sweet potatoes but I did like them in this dish.   My husband loved it and finished off the leftovers.  The only change I will make next time is to only drain half of the cans of the yams and apples.  Even after cooking for 30 minutes there was still too much liquid.  And I did omit the pecans because I'm allergic.

This was good! I've never used canned yams, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but they worked well in this. Also, I couldn't find regular canned apples, but I did find 'fried' cinnamon apples in syrup, so I used those and that was great. I think next time I will use less (if any) of the canned syrups and maybe use some maple syrup instead b/c I was hoping that it woiuld be a bit sweeter. All in all, this was a nice, quick side and everyone at the dinner table enjoyed it (including my sweet potato hating hubby, lol). I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Love  the tart flavor the apples added to this dish but like a couple have said, I wish I'd drained my yams.
