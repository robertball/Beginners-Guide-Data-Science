I give this recipe two stars because it doesnt even taste like egg salad! I was looking for a traditional egg salad recipe and this one seemed pretty basic. The onions are overpowering and the paprika makes the salad pinkish red! I am not sure what people may think if I serve pink egg salad!

I gave this four stars with one huge alteration - instead of 1 tablespoon of mayonaise, I used 1/2 cup of mayonaise.  I don't know if 1 tablespoon is a misprint, but I never made such a dry egg salad.  After adding a half cup of mayo, it was very good.

Used just a little bit of dried dill and mayo to suit. I will sometimes use yellow or sweet onion instead of red. Egg salad sandwiches are always comfort food to me. Thank you.
