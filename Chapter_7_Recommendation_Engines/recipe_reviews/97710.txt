This is an amazing dish.  If you are looking for something different to do with chicken this is it.  My son loved it!  If you don't like a lot of "heat" I suggest you leave out the red pepper flakes or only use 1/4 tsp.  I only made half of this recipe as there is only 2 of us eating and with 1/2 tsp we had the heat.  We like heat so that did not bother us.  I used Barilla Marinara for the sauce.  We will make this again.  You want to serve with a slice of bread for the "heat".  My kitchen smelled wonderful while cooking.  I did this meal in my wok that goes on top my stove.  I did use olive oil for browning the chicken.  Also it says just heat through after adding sauce, I actually let it cook for about 15 min or so.  I wanted all my flavors to meld. LEFTOVER IDEA.. MMMMM... I am thinking taking the sauce mixture with chicken and putting on sub bun with moz or bleu cheese and under broiler.. wow.. or in a tortilla for a wrap..

Magnificent! I had one jar of Ragu Garden combination sauce only. So I substituted with one 15oz. can Diced stewed tomatoes.Blended both well in a large bowl. No other changes.The stewed tomatoes I believe,added body and texture.Not just a saucy look.My wife and kids loved it so much we took a picture of it.So much good flavor,so little time to prepare.Thanks!

This was really good.  I changed a few minor things (didn't use all the types of peppers and substituded julienned squash for the yellow bells) but it was amazing.  I used homemade blackened mix that I got from a recipe on here as well.

Great spin on pasta, it was refreshing trying something different than just the usual pasta covered in sauce. I actually used rotini instead of penne pasta to give it that extra "rasta" look. I probably won't stop saying rasta pasta anytime soon either.

This was wonderful! I actually followed the recipe to the letter.  It was as good as anything I go to a restaraunt and pay quite a bit of money for.  It was easy, but it tasted like it cooked all day.  I will make this again and again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I love spicy food and was sure to use extra spice to make it even hotter!  Before adding the pasta sauce, I tried a piece of chicken, and if it wasn't for self control, the pasta sauce would have never made it into the saucepan.  I cut the chicken breast pieces into cubes rather than long strips and added more red pepper flakes, but other than that, followed the recipe.  Highly, highly recommended for all those spice lovers!

This dish was really good. My husband and I both really love spicy food and this was right up our alley. I used linguinie noodles instead of penne. I would recommend using two bottles of sauce if you use a thicker pasta. I used a vodka tomato sauce instead of a basic spaghetti . Next time I would only use 1 tablespoon of cajun seasoning because i thought using two made the chicken kind of salty.... Overall it was a really good recipe that you can tweak to your liking.

very good! I used shrimp instead of chicken because my husband is allergic to poultry (can you imagine not being able to cook with chicken or chicken broth!) and it turned out really yummy - thanks for the recipe!

This was a pretty good meal.  Didn't have the yellow pepper and I used a variety of spices.  I liked the kick and the fact that it was a different pasta meal.  I feel like laughing everytime I say "rasta pasta," but the kids think it's fun.

I'm sure this pasta gets it's name from the red, gold and green peppers but, rastas do not eat chicken.

Jah mon! Tasty dish, but not earth-shattering. I liked the addition of Cajun seasoning to the chicken (I diced mine.) Replaced curry powder w/ allspice. I halved this recipe and still had leftovers after my husband and I ate. I think homemade sauce should be used b/c a recipe calling for "meatless spaghetti sauce" is pretty vague - meaning, so many styles of jarred sauces could offer an entirely different flavor spin. All-in-all, a unique take on standard noodle-sauce fare, and I'll look forward to making it again w/ some tweaks.

My family thought it was alittle bit too spicy, but it is a keeper. I think I will cut the red pepper flakes in half for us next time.

This is a nice change to regular pasta and adds some nice fllavors. I have made this a few times with some variations according to what I had on hand. I don't like the blackened seasoning, so usually add some chicken seasoning while browning chicken.

Very tasty - but true Rasta's do not eat any meat. If you order rasta pasta in Jamaica it is completely meatless.

This was fantastic!  Really beautiful presentation and just delicious.  I skipped the pre-made blackened seasoning and made my own in order to cut down on the sodium (cayenne, paprika, curry, coriander, garlic & onion powder, black pepper and chili pepper).  This may become a standard dish.  Thanks for posting!

Very good but not as interesting as it sounds. Still really enjoyed it though.    I found the flavour to be less intense than I would have liked so I added a little extra curry powder, crushed chillies and cajun spice. I also tripled the garlic (I looooove garlic) and added some chicken stock concentrate.   I did use store-bought pasta sauce but I also added some diced tomatoes which were REALLY a nice addition.

Made this with shrimp instead of chicken, what a hit it was!  Were gonna try it with rice next time to make it more of a creole dish. Definitely a great base recipe to build upon! I'll have pictures up soon of the shrimp version

This is a family favorite in our house!  I use rotini instead of penne pasta because hubs prefers it and add some extra Ragu because he likes his pasta saucy.  When I want a less spicy meal, I omit the cajun seasoning and it still has plenty of flavor.

RASTA PASTA is so fun to say, but so much more delicious!!  Tons of flavor too.  I didn't have any cajun seasoning but just used some poultry seasoning with extra red pepper flakes.  The spiciness was just right.  This is definitely going into my rotation!!

My entire family loved this.  It did have a bit of spice and I will decrease the crushed pepper by half next time.

Lovely pasta.  Very easy and turns out exceedingly well.  I didn't put as much pepper in as called for--I'm not a huge fan of hot spicy.  I didn't have green peppers so I used other peppers.  All in all, very delicious and an easy dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh man, this was soooo good!!  What an awesome, orginal pasta idea!  I followed the recipe verbatim except homemade sauce as opposed to jarred.  Perfect spiciness!  I beg you to resist throwing in mozz. or parm. cheese as some reviewers have suggested- not all pasta dishes need cheese!  Try once as is!  Thanks for a keeper =)

Not only is this tasty, but it is so fun to say!   I made my own marinara sauce to go with this, and it was to amazing! I barely had enough to take for lunch the next day!  I'm very sensitive to spicy foods so I didn't put as much red pepper flakes.  I will definitely make this one again.

I loved this dish.  I did not add the extra 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes and it was plenty spicy enough for my taste without them.  Thank you!

Spicy, flavorful pasta!  I used the blackening spices as a dry-rub for grilling the chicken breasts on a George Foreman grill.  I let the meat rest for ~10 mins while sautee'ing the vegetables, then i cut the chicken breast into bite-size pieces and added them to the vegetables.  I had sun dried tomato pasta sauce on hand, and it seemed to go very well.  This is a dish that is even better as leftovers.

This is a fantastic dish. Extremely simple, for those after work nights. It's definitely a good idea to use the exact recipe here before deciding to tweak it.

Thank you for this recipe, it is awesome! I love bell peppers and red onion, so I was happy to find another recipe to use them in. The mix of flavors is great. I cut the recipe in half and used half a jar of vodka sauce and half a jar of tomato sauce. I did everything else exactly as it says and it was great!

While this was good..it wasen't that much different than typical a spagetti/chicken dish in my opinion. Due to the fact I like spicey food I added the full amount of red pepper, and an addictional teaspoon of caribbian jerk seasoning to mine, even though I only made a half recipe. I often add onions/garlic/green peppers to "normal" spagetti or pasta dishes anyhow ...so this was pretty much the same..I even added a little extra curry powder but didnt taste it much. Once again, good..but not outstanding in my opinion.

I made this last night and it was a big success with husband. I thought the spaghetti sauce might be a bit too much, so I used a bottle of alla vodka sauce instead, but only 2/3 of it. Instead I added some sour cream and heavy cream just before serving. YUMMY!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this! I was at the store and saw some lovely colored peppers, I had no idea what I'd do with em but I bought em anyway. I got home plugged chicken and peppers into "ingredients" and up popped this gem. I liked how simple it was and that it was something else to do with chicken. Next time I'll just add the cooked pasta to the chicken concoction, we used rigatoni.

I have made this recipe about five times so far. The only thing I usually change up is that sometimes I serve it over different types of pasta besides penne or even over rice. Even better the next day. It is pretty straightforward, if you like the ingredients that go into this dish you will like it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this!  I really liked that it only took 45 minutes to prepare - I never plan ahead enough!  Quick to make and a lot of flavor!  Loved the spices.  Made my own Cajun mix.   3 tbsp. salt 3 tbsp. paprika 1 1/2 tbsp. cayenne pepper 1 tbsp. black pepper 1 tbsp. garlic powder 1 tbsp. onion powder 1 1/2 tbsp. ground thyme

Delicous!  I was skeptical about adding the sauce at the end, didn't want it to taste like chicken with jarred sauce, but all the steps in the recipe make it really stand out.  I didn't use but about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and it was way too hot still, will omit that next time, so my kids can eat it better.  They did love it though!!

A flavorful, memorable dish.  I substituted olive oil for butter, omitted crushed red peppers, added 2 table spoons of curry (versus 1/4 teaspoon) and squeezed fresh lemon juice onto chicken before cooking.  My 3-year-old son licked his plate clean. The foundation of this recipe is solid.  Mighty grateful Linda.  Cannot wait to make this dish again!

Picked the recipe because of the name, my 19 year old has to cook this week cause I have a broken hand, and we saw the name and tried it. Very EZ recipe for beginner cooks, little hot so we put pineapple thru it, tasted great! Nice change from the same 'ol pasta!

It was really good. I didn't use any garlic because I thought it'd be too much and I don't like garlic anyway. Thank you! :)

This is a family favorite! I leave out the Crushed red pepper so the kids can eat it & hubby adds it as he likes. Also we dice the peppers. Makes it a little more kid friendly. Overall- It Rocks!!

I used chicken strips and I didnt have the cajun blacken seasoning so sprinkled Grill Creations N'Orleans Cajun seasoning & Cayenne Pepper on the chicken.  The end product was wonderful.  I got several compliments for this recipe.

We had a restaurant here named Rasta Pasta and they used wet Jamaican Jerk seasoning. You can find it online. You can still add the curry powder and garlic. We use garlic, a can of tomatoes some basil and jerk seasoning with the chicken over pasta.

Very tasty just as written.  I had used a similar recipe before but this one is much "prettier" for a perfect presentation.  I didn't use curry after the first batch but that's just a personal preference.

Wonderful recipe, as is.  A family favorite.  However, it has nothing to do with traditional vegetarian Jamaican Rasta Pasta, which includes ackee and no curry powder or cajun seasoning.

Was this perhaps from Rasta Pasta in Breckenridge?  I used to eat there all the time.  They also have another past that has pineapple and is UNbelievable!

This was fabulous!  Wasn't sure how I'd like the pasta sauce with curry and blackened seasoning, but it turned out great!  Very flavorful, but it does seem to heat up the more you eat!

good recipe... has a nice kick. I think I'll keep it in my recipe box, but next time I will substitute the chicken for sausage.

This has been one of my favorite recipes for years made as is. Doesn't need a thing changed. I will say though that I spent some time off pastas etc and just added extra peppers and chicken and ate without the pasta. Still yummy that way too!

I thought this would be weird. However, it was quite delicious! A little spicy for me, so next time I will cut back a bit. Dont let the random ingredients frighten you (I never thought curry, cajun and spaghetti sauce would go together!)

Great hit with the entire family, and a fun diversion on pasta and red sauce. Tonight, I had all the ingredients except green pepper, so I substituted yellow squash, and otherwise followed recipe other than using olive oil instead of butter and serving red pepper flakes to top after after serving. (Okay, I also probably used twice as much curry, since we halved the recipe for the four of us.) We're a household of spicy food fans, so didn't need bread to dilute the heat. Delightful twist to regular pasta and sauce! I used a can of Hunt's herb & garlic pasta sauce. I loved the freshness of the peppers and the yellow squash I added, which is great in this, after a quick stir-fry, so I wouldn't simmer for 15 min., as suggested by another review. 
HINT: Get water boiling for pasta, and throw pasta into boil AFTER browning and setting chicken aside. Everything should be finished at about the same time. 
Definite make-again for us! Loved the easy one-pot cleanup, too. Thanks, Linda.

Tried this recipe as is.  Found it good but the flavour between the pasta and the sauce to be flat. Liked the blackened chicken but rest just tasted like I cooked the pasta, threw in the sauce & served.

I liked it but I wasn't raving. I used olive oil instead of butter. I always cut the amount of pasta in half because otherwise it's carb overload. This way I was able to only use one jar of sauce.
