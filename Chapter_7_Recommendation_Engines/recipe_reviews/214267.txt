Very Yummy! If the cream cheese frosting is your favorite part of carrot cake, like it is mine, you will love these! People I made it for went back for seconds and I came home with none! Just to caution... The crust is very fragile. Be careful when spreading the cream cheese mixture. I would drop by spoon fulls and evenly cover that way, gently smoothing afterwards. Will definately make this one again!

I love these carrot cheesecake bars!  Very easy to make! I even modified the recipe to make it a little healthier by using reduced fat cream cheese and fat free sour cream.  They turned out amazing. Thanks for the recipe! :)
