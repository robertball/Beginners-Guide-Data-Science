I made this recipe and it was not good at all.  The combination of ground turkey and baked beans doesn't work well together.

This was excellent. I had to double the recipe for a family of 5 I made it 12 servings. I have a pre-teen and two teenagers. We all loved it!

Very good!  My husband loved it and it was easy to make.  My picky toddler even ate it!  Who can say anything bad about something that a 15 mo old will actually eat!!

I changed it a little.  1 can of refried beans instead of baked beans, 1 can diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice, 1 cup of green peppers and pasta.  Then I added the cheese and biscuits on top of mixture prior to baking in the oven. My kids loved it.

Easy to make and tastes okay. My husband didn't like the baked bean taste even though he loves baked beans, go figure!

This seemed more like a dish for kids.  It had a very sweet flavor, and my toddler loved it.

I like this recipe. I did end up using spicy hot tomato juice instead and added some Worcestershire sauce because it seemed bland. It was very good this way

Was very simple to make and my husband really liked it even though he's not real fond of ground turkey.
