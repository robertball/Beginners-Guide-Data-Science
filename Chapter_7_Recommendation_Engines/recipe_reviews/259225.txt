I cut the recipe in half,  and used air popped popcorn, and dark chocolate chips for the chocolate drizzle.  It was delicious!  I am sad that I cut it in half!!!

This was very easy to make and oh! So good!  I added white almond bark and M&Ms to make it a little more festive for the holidays.  Will definitely make again.  I didnâ€™t use microwave popcorn, but popped 2 pans full on the stovetop. Much healthier, if it makes any difference after you add all that sugary sweetness!
