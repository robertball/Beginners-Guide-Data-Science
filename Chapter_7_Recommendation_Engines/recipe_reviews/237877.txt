Yummy! My banana and blueberries were frozen, and I had no blackberries so used more blueberries. This is very good! I used double honey and no sugar.

I make a version of this twice a week and I love it. I use Greek yogurt and half a 5 oz container and I use blackberries or raspberries with frozen mango chunks and apple juice ice cubes!
