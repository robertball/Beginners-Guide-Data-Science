When rolling enchiladas ( which I have been doing for about 50 years) always heat the tortillas before adding filling and rolling.  If they are still diffacult dip in some hot liquid or oil .  After rolling place SEAM SIDE DOWN.   Love to all and good eating    Jerri

I've made this same recipe for years and we love it...exactly as is...or with a few modifications (depending on ingredients I have on hand).  Have used Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup mixed with one can of Ro-Tel Tomatoes with Green Chilies - nice bit of heat but not too much.  I heat my tortillas in the microwave for 10 seconds, spread them immediately with sour cream to keep them pliable, then top with chicken mixture and cheese(s). I've even added rice and black olives on occasion.  I like corn torts but my hubby likes flour torts better - so I usually use some of each.  I often make these in the morning, refrigerate them, and bake them when I get home from work.  Instant dinner!  Great way to use leftover chicken or turkey too.

The only thing I changed was to cook the chicken with a diced onion and once the chicken was almost done I added a package of taco seasoning and that really made this recipe GREAT!!!!! I got 10 stars from my husband and his friends.

I can't believe more people haven't rated this recipe! It is sooo good and looks really nice w/ the tomatoes and onion on top!!! I've been making this for quite some time now and my husband raves every time we have it. I like to put some of the sauce mixture in the bottom of the pan before I put the enchiladas in.

I have made this numerous times and I like to pour a can of red enchilada sauce on top before baking.  They are um um good!

This was good but pretty bland.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using a MEDIUM salsa.  Next time I'm going to use the Southwest Pepperjack soup from Campbell's. Perhaps that will take it up a notch. Topping it with grated cheese didn't do too terribly much, flavorwise. I know the chicken enchiladas shouldn't be as zippy as beef but this was awfully tame. Simple, and as another reviewer mentioned, I too made mine in the morning for putting in the oven later in the day.

This was the first time for me making enchiladas. Easy recipe and they tasted very good. I followed the recipe ingredients to be fare. I doubled the recipe and baked them seam side down. After assembling the enchiladas I found I didn't need ALL the extra sauce to cover them before baking. The last 10 min. of baking I topped them with shredded cheese as I LOVE CHEESE. Now, I prefer my food spicey and this is not all that spicey, but palatable for the average person. Half the people in the family prefer spicey, the other half not as much. I just put out various hot sauces on the table for those that needed an extra kick. I will make this recipe again.

Very good.  I used corn tortillas which are more difficult to roll so next time I think I will just layer it.

Very easy to make and it turned out delicious!  Not very spicy though so if you're looking for a little heat, add some hot sauce, use a hot picante sauce or add hot sauce at the table.  Great dish.  I'll definitely make it again!

Yummy & easy! I followed the recipe but, used all the healthier options. Healthy Request soup, non-fat sour cream, low fat cheese and whole wheat tortillas. Definitely a go to recipe. Goes really well with Spanish Rice II. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Spanish-Rice-II/Detail.aspx

This is a quick & easy version of enchiladas!  I have made these on several occasions and have added cumin and some drained & rinsed black beans to it, as well as the juice from 1/2 of a lime. I adjust the Pace from medium to hot, depending on who will be eating it!  I also like to add a corn tortilla to the inside of the flour tortilla before I put in the filling for a flavor boost, as traditional enchiladas are made with corn tortillas!  I also recommend a blend of jack & cheddar cheese and by all means, use red or tomatillo (green) enchilada sauce over the top before baking, NOT the salsa. You can also remove the cover from your baking dish about 1/2 way through the bake time, if you want some color and crispy edges.  Feel free to bake a bit longer, if needed. Serve with sour cream on the side, and a nice mexican style rice.  There's some great rice recipies on this site!  ENJOY!

I loved this recipe. I'm 17 and me and my family kinda all worked on the dinner when we had this a while back. My mom cooked and shredded the chicken, I put all of the ingredients into the chicken, rolled the enchiladas and put them in the oven, and my dad made a rice to go with the enchiladas. They are very simple and very delicious to make! They are yummy, and they have just enough spice in them. I think the enchiladas were very filling, and i would suggest this to anyone who wants to do something new, besides the mundane foods you always eat. It was a great dish. Super simple and easy to make.

Very easy and very tasty! My husband and I both love this dish. Like other reviews have said we added a drained can of rotel tomatoes & green chilis to add some spice (instead of the picante sauce and chili powder). I have made with both cream of chicken soup and cheddar soup and both were delicious. Both times I have also used canned chicken instead of fresh chicken. Tastes great the next day as leftovers for lunch! Will make again!

Very good, for how quick and easy they are.  The only thing I suggest is putting some of the sauce on the bottom of the pan before putting down the enchiladas.  I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Campbell's!! :)

I originally got this off the Campbell's website. It is one of the best recipes I have found! I do as someothers have mentioned and add taco seasoning to my chicken. I also double the sauce mixture and do an extra one or two wraps.

What a great weeknight recipe. Used store bought Rotisserie Chicken and this was on the table in no time. Fast, easy and tasty. I did add a little more Chili Powder and cheese. Hubby and kids enjoyed this.

this is a staple at our house!  you can spice it up any way you want. Use a hotter salsa/picante, or try experimenting with different cheeses.  We tend to put our cheese on TOP, and we loved Medium picante with Pepper Jack cheese on top. Gave it a great kick!

I pretty much make easy enchiladas the same way. However I replace the Cream of Chicken Soup and the cheese with undiluted Campbell's Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup.   I also use this soup (without adding water) as a sauce for asparagus, broccoli, brussel sprouts, etc.. Luv it!

This was so easy and delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only thing I did different was add more monterey jack cheese into the picante sauce mixture and put even more monterey jack cheese on top of the enchiladas before I baked them. I love cheese! :) Some reviews complained of a bland flavor, I pan cooked my chicken in a little bit of butter and seasoned them with a little salt & pepper and it tasted great.  I served with a 3 layer chip dip & goya mexican rice (and Coronas w/ limes of course!) Got great reviews from my friends!

Made this the other day and it was so so yummy!  I bought two rotisserie chickens and cut of the meat and followed the instructions completely.  I had some shredded MJC left over and sprinkled the rest on top and baked it.  Huge hit at my house. Thanks for a great recipe.  Will be a regular on my shopping list!!

This was quick, easy and delicious! I didn't have any chili powder so I added half a packet of taco seasoning to the mixture. As my boyfriend likes things hotter, I threw in some diced chilies for extra heat and poured some enchilada sauce in the baking dish before putting them in, and then covered with more enchilada sauce. With about 5 minutes left to bake, I topped with a Mexican blend of cheeses. We both loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

Family Friendly and very tasty and very easy.  I usually add a 1/2 can of black beans to the mixture and then use the other 1/2 of a can to top our side salads.

Pretty good, but did add cumin as other suggested. I will reduce chili powder to 1 tsp though next time as it was so overpowering. Also, watch how long you bake & if using a glass pan so it doesn't dry out.

Loved it.  Even the kids ate it.  We did use regular taco sauce in  place of the picante because the kids dont like 'stuff' but it was still great.  Its a keeper.

I love this recipe. The recipe is made so much in my house that I know the recipe by heart. Everyone in my family loves it!! :) I would suggest this recipe to anyone. I would cook it a bit longer in the oven to make edges of the tortilla crispy. Yumm...

First off, I have to say that I do not cook, but promised my boyfriend that I would start trying. My new year's resolution is to try a new recipe every week, starting last week. :-) I followed a suggestion that someone else made and added chopped onion while cooking the chicken and taco seasoning when the chicken was almost done because I've always found that Enchiladas were bland. This meal turned out excellent and my boyfriend totally agreed. Yum!

This was good. I added the taco seasoning, a can of Rotel tomatoes for heat(tomatos and green chiles), and salsa to the meat mixture. Yumyum! I am making this today and will add 3 kinds of cheeses. A keeper for sure, My kids love them.

Oh me oh my!! This recipe is going to become a regular at my house!! I'm writing this review as I'm sitting here, savoring these enchiladas! On a serious note, I followed the recipe to a "T" and added white rice and cantina thin chips. We are in LOVE with this recipe! Give it a try!

My family loves this recipe. I use a grocery store rotisserie chicken. Remove the skin and pull off all of the meat and shred it before adding to the sauce mixture. Makes it so easy and quick to put together. I serve it with salsa and a dollop of sour cream, shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes on top. So good! Next time I make this, I will definitely try using a packet of taco seasoning, instead of the chili powder!

We absolutely loved this!  The only adjustments I made were to use the Healthy Requests version of the soup (less calories and sodium), light sour cream, reduced fat cheese, and a thin layer of red enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan.  I also used a rotisserie chicken to make it a little quicker.  My husband tells me they were the best enchiladas he's ever had.  Thanks, Campbell's!

I thought the basic concept was good, I tweaked mine a bit and my family thought it was a hit.  I used the campbells fiesta cheese soup in place of the cream of chicken, used the sour cream and monterey jack cheese, and omitted the chili powder.  I then added some mild salsa as we don't like really spicy at our house.  
The mixture was a bit thick so next time I may thin with milk.  I mixed some of that in with the chicken and put it in the tortillas and spread the remaining mix on top and sprinkled with cheese.
Baked until bubbly and delish!  I'm eating the leftovers at work as I'm typing this review!

This is a recipe I make over and over again.  Sometimes I add black beans.  Still protein but cuts back on the meat.  Great for leftover chicken.  My changes are using reduced fat sour cream and soup and I probably go a little shy on the cheese.  Both my young kids eat it up - not too spicy for them.  I also use high fiber tortillas to up the nutritional value.

Delicious!  I added some fresh cilantro and habanero cheese to spice it up a little more.  Next time, I will back off a bit on the cream of chicken soup, so it will have more of a sour cream taste.

After reading the reviews, I made the following changes: Campbells Cheddar instead of chicken; a bit of salsa in the bottom of the pan; and enchilada sauce over top. I made some chicken enchiladas, but running out of chicken I made some cheese enchiladas too using hot pepper cheese. I used mild salsa for the kids and still found it rather piquant but we all loved them. Served with Mexican Fire Rice from this site. Easy and YUM! Part of our rotation this fall/winter for sure.

This was a lot better then I was expecting it to be. My husband loved it & said "I cant wait to eat it again for lunch tomorrow." I served it with sliced avocados on top & rice & beans on the side.

Yum. Used a rotisserie chicken and shredded it for the filling and I double the recipe but otherwise didn't change anything. The sauce was great. I love trying different enchilada recipes and this one goes on the keep list!

This makes a lot of enchiladas, but most were gone by the end of the evening!  It was very easy to make ahead and then just pop in the oven before our friends came over.  Good flavor!

These are great!  They are now a regular meal on our weekly lineup.  My kids ask for them all the time.  I will usually fix Spanish rice to go with them and it makes a nice side.

This recipe is a really great base for the enchiladas. I doctor mine up a little bit though. I make my chicken in the crockpot. I put my chicken breaks in the crockpot with some black bean and corn salsa and chili powder and let that cook all day. By dinner time the chicken just falls apart. I then mix that chicken in with the soup mix that the recipe calls for. I mix everything and bake as directed but the last 15 minutes I pull the foil off and top with cheese. It comes out all ooey and gooey and bubbly and delicious!

We really love this recipe. I have made it both as written and with my own modifications and have never had it turn out bad. It is like comfort food with a Mexican twist. I like to assemble in the morning and bake when I get home from work.

I've made this many many times. I always advertise to my friends that they aren't very authentic, but they are still SO good! I've had to start doubling and sometimes tripling to recipe so everyone can have more. I highly recommend this because it is really easy and delicious.

My husband and boys loved this. I used mild salsa so that the baby could eat it. I let the 4 year old have a little pepper on it and I handed my husband the Franks hot sauce so that he could individually spice it up to his level. Easily modified to hot level of taste at the individual level.  Perfect!

Made this dish for dinner tonight. Very tasty. I did add enchilada sauce to mixture and to bottom of dish prior to adding. Hubby thought there was a tad too much sauce, but it was good. I also got 8 enchiladas out of mixture.

this was very good and very easy, my family loved it. i added a bit of spice by using medium salsa instead of picante sauce and added about 1/3 of a package of taco seasoning. i also used chipotle chili powder rather than regular chili powder and put about half the amount of tomatoes on it. Very good, will make again. But, i think it wouldn't serve six, i have a family of four and it was almost not enough.

Amazing! Saving this to make again! Only thing I did differently was add Cheese to the top 10 minutes before done in the oven, for a more cheesy meal!

I have two teenage boys and a husband and they LOVE these enchiladas!  I like them a lot too!  I make a double recipe and it goes fast.  The only changes I've made:  I put the rolled tortillas seam-side down and I had another 1/2 cup or so of the Monterrey Jack over the top.

Such a fabulous, creamy enchilada, still including a light tomato taste. It's even better with tortillas that you cook at home (sold raw). I doubled the recipe, and instead of adding 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, used about 3/4 cup more sour cream.  Then I seasoned the chicken with a bbq rub by Durkee (st. Louis style).  I included chives, red peppers and omitted the chili powder.  It flew off my family's plates!

Loved this recipe as a good base to go on. I like to cook my chicken with taco seasoning, put a layer of cheese on the bottom of the pan to make it "crust like" and sprinkle sliced black olives on top after baking...DEEEEELISH!!!

I always add black or pinto beans to the filling, and use the fat free cream of chicken soup and low fat sour cream. I have made these with other cheese too, but like Monterey best. I also use whole grain, or flavored tortillas in place of plain ones. Serve with sour cream, chopped tomato or salsa, and a side of sweet corn bread, very yummy!

Have only made it once, but will definitely be making it over and over again. The soup really does make it perfect! I used cream of mushroom since I was making it for vegetarians, but it was all good! Wonderful, quick and easy recipe

My husband gave this 5 stars, but I changed it so much. Mainly because of what I had on hand. I will make this again.
I added roasted corn and fresh red bell pepper. I didn't have pace, so I used enchilada sauce instead. And I used cream of mushroom soup, and cheddar cheese. I also layered this like a lasagna. Then topped it with more sour cream, black olives, and spicy peppers when served. Thanks for a great recipe!

If you're looking for a traditional enchilada recipe this is NOT it. This is basically just chicken and rotel cheese dip wrapped in a tortilla. I was not impressed.

These enchiladas were kind of bland, I changed the picante to a hotter one and it still needed something else. Also I would use corn tortillas not flour they became soggy.

Instead of the picante sauce I used enchilada salsa from the story and instead of the monterey jack I used the mixture mexican style cheese so there is 3 different kinds of cheese and instead of rolling if you just lay the tortillas in a bake dish and layer it with the chicken mixture then tortillas on top and the remaining of the sauce or chicken pour it on top and baked it.  it came out so good we ate it all in 3 days!

This was Awesome! I did substitute enchilada sauce for the picante and poured the remaining enchilada sauce over the soup mixture poured on the top before cooking! Topped with pico de gallo and served with a side of sour cream and guacamole, some mexican style rice and refried beans, this is definitely a repeatable meal at my house! mmm, mmm good!

As written, this recipe is only average.  But, if you use Fiesta Cheese soup (instead of Cream of Chicken), throw in some diced bell pepper, and add some cumin, this makes one great, and EASY, burrito (really, it's not an enchilada without the enchilada sauce).  Perfect for weeknight when you want to get dinner on the table in 30 min, or if you need to use up some extra chicken.

These are dang good. I did add 4 oz of light cream cheese and 1/4 cup light  cottage cheese just to the mixture I put inside the tortillas. It was so yummy and great as left overs too. Oh and my little one loved it too. I also tried the filling with white tortilla chips and it was awesome. I wiill make this again and I will be using the mixture as a dip as well.

Wow, this is good.  Made a few changes, but very minor ones.  I did saute a half onion in a little olive oil then added 3 butterflied chicken breasts.  Coated the chicken breast with some taco seasoning.  Sliced chicken extremely thin when done, did not shred.  Used Herdez medium salsa and enchilada sauce in place of picante.   Added a little more sour cream than called for, did not want the cream of chicken taste.  Used colby/monterey jack cheese.  Made extra sauce (sauce needs to be thick).  Taste the sauce before you mix it with the chicken to make sure it's to your liking.  Once the tortillas were rolled and in the pan, put the remaining sour cream/crm of chicken sauce on top, along with the rest of the enchilada sauce I had used in the cream mixture (have to have enchilada sauce with enchiladas).  Cooked for 30-35 minutes then topped with colby/monterey jack cheese and baked for 10 mins. longer.   The kids and husband could not get over how good this was.  Raves around the table.  It was delicious!!!!!  Served with some Steamfresh Southwestern Rice and homemade quacamole.

First of all, let me say that this came out amazing! The main thing I changed was I used Cream of Jalepeno soup, and wow! I subbed the sour cream (hard to find and pricey here in Japan) for a equivalent blend of cream cheese and plain yogurt. Also, I used no-fat butter spray and some white wine to "fry" the chicken, along adding diced onions and 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning. I omitted the chopped tomato, too, simply because I didn`t have one on hand. Other than that, I followed the original instructions. I did add the black beans like a reviewer suggested, excellent! Also, definately seam side down, but watch out, I over-stuffed, and some mix tended to plop out. The ends came out dark, but because I brushed a little yogurt on them, they stayed soft. My husband is a fast eater, but I`ve never seen him eat so dang fast! And make "mmm!" noises the whole time! Homerun!

This has become a new favorite in our home. I don't usually like enchiladas made with flour tortillas, but these work. We LOVE the filling. I've made these twice now, the last time including a cup of Nacho Cheese soup. I end up putting a whole chicken in the crockpot and using that. It tends to make some extra filling, which is good on its own and makes a great lunch the next day.

I made it for my family and they all loved it. I also used mexican style cheese and salsa instead of wwhat the recipe called for. 40min was to long! Only put it in there for 25 to 30 min for best results.

My husband and I both liked this a lot. I used a Mexican cheese blend instead of just Monterey Jack and it was very good. I'm not sure why this needs to go in the oven for 40 minutes though since everything is already cooked. I realized that halfway through the cook time and took it out, the sauce on top was a little dry and the edges of the enchiladas were a little crisp.

Made some changes with this recipe, some successful, some not...  I used nacho cheese soup, which added more flavor, as well as medium chunky salsa to boost the heat as well.   Non-fat sour cream and part-skim mozzarella cut down on the calories, as well as a switch from flour to corn tortillas.  The corn tortillas didn't stay together as well, but even as a mush, the flavor wasn't too bad.

This was a quick and easy dinner to make, so I loved that. I used salsa instead of picante sauce for more texture and it tasted pretty good. It's something I will probably make again for my husband and myself. Not a great dish for young kids though.

This recipe is so versatile.  I learned of it from my boss.  Since following the original recipes, I have modified in the following ways: 1. Layered the corn tortilla's like lasagne. (because I had forgotten to save some of the sauce on the side to top with - it was all mixed with the chicken).  2. Cut the corn tortillas into small pieces - folded everything together and used a crockpot for heating (served this at a pot luck).  Both of these methods are really forgiving and are easy to serve up.   I add a few cans of chopped green chili's - they are really mild to me.

This was pretty easy (though I do hate cutting up chicken) and I thought very good.  They weren't super spicy, but there are things that can make up for spicy and still be good, in this case creamy.  The soup and sour cream make it creamy.  (And no, I didn't think it tasted like soup.) I made this mostly as is but not quite.  I always just used salsa and have never figured out the difference between that and picante (all brands taste different anyway).  I used some sour cream on top instead of the tomato & green onion, cause, well, I like sour cream. :-)  I also never have 6" flour tortillas around so I used the 9" ones I had.  It filled 3 of those.  Since a 6" would have a higher tortilla to filling ratio, I could see how that might get doughy.  Though flour tortillas are easy to work with & I've never had trouble rolling them -- corn is what likes to break and fall apart.   So the 9" flour worked well for me. I don't see how this is 6 servings - more like 3, or 4 max.

This was good but I didn't make it according to directions by mistake.  Mixed everything together and didn't save anything for the top.  I used doctored up canned enchilada sauce I had on hand.  I went the lower fat route with fat-free tortillas, cream soup and sour cream.  Made me feel less guilty about eating such a rich dish.

My family loves this recipe. It is so easy. You don't even have to sautee onions or garlic. We use medium pace picante sauce and 2 oz. of green chilis. We also blend our salsa and chilis for a smoother sauce. We love it! So simple and tastes great!

I only gave this 4 stars because I did change some things to suit my families taste.  I used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the chicken, a little more picante sauce than called for, a can of Rotel, and a half can of black beans.  I will make this again with the modifications.

I tried this recipe with my meatless chicken from Morning satrt Farm and it came out excellent. It was super delicious. To lower the fat content you can use the Healthy Request version of the soup and a fat free sour cream along with fat free cheese.

These were really good... quick, easy... I keep all of the ingredients that were needed  on hand anyway...   I seasoned the chicken (with garlic powder, cayenne pepper, cumin and extra chili powder) as I pan cooked them... then diced it up pretty small... I added a bit of onion to the mix... and instead of only making 6 I made twice as many, and didn't use the filling on top of them... Instead, on top I added more picante sauce, and cheese.   It was really good!   I will be making them again... Everyone loved them!

This recipe is almost exactly like my mom's that I've been eating for 20 years!  She doesn't use salsa though... She boils a whole chicken till all the meat falls off the bone, shreds it, tosses it with a package of taco seasoning, and a little jalapeno juice.  Not being too wet on the inside keeps the tortillas from getting soggy while cooking.

This is good, and similar to my own way..I use enchilada sauce in place of the picante, and add about a teaspoonful of ground cumin.And I sometimes use cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken soup. I never use flour tortillas..and when I prepare the corn ones, I heat them on a lightly oiled griddle..makes them more pliable. A suggestion about soggy enchiladas. Do not make early in the day and allow to sit for hours before you bake them. It is a sure fire way for a soggy,mushy enchilada!

Good but pretty rich, thick- ok, I know it's soup based. Kids liked it. Doubled recipe to freeze 1/2. Nuked wraps 10 sec's & had no trouble rolling. Sauce top and bottom, extra cheese on top for last 10 minutes. will try no-soup recipe

EASY, FOOL PROOF and a winner with the hubby.  No need to cook your own chicken, just used the canned or packaged variety!  Thank goodness for easy to prepare foods!  I will be making this one again.  Oh, and used reduced fat everything with good luck.

YUM!  I added the onion to the chicken mixture and used a southwest seasoning instead of the other.  It was delicious!

These were great- even my picky eater liked them. Next time, tho, I'll put a little sauce in the bottom before I lay in the tortillas. I didn't this time, and the bottoms were super hard, while the top was perfect.

I made these for a casual company dinner, and I used multigrain high fiber tortillas. I also used the meat from a rotisserie chicken, which I always have on hand. My son thought these were the best enchiladas I've ever made, and they were definitely the simplest.

My cousin made this for a family function and it was TERRIBLE.  It didn't taste anything close to an enchilada.  My son literally spit it out.  Not a winner in our book.  We ended up going out and buying different food.  Two thumbs down!

Not what I would call a classic enchilada, but the taste is good.  Also a little on the salty side.  A good weeknight dinner.

I put the chicken and cheese in the sauce. Then I wrap it like a chimichanga. Then I bake till golden. Then I add cheese for the last 10 to 15 mins. Served with sour cream and baby spinach.

Definitely an easy, delicious meal!  We always use medium salsa and aged white cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack.  For a smokey twist, add some finely chopped chipotle peppers.  Remember to use quality ingredients... I can see this dish going south if you're trying to be cheap (maybe that's the problem with all of the bad reviews).  These enchiladas are also great reheated if you wrap them in aluminum foil and heat in the oven at 350 until warm throughout.

This was the first time I made enchiladas and this recipe was awesome! I removed the 2 spoons of chili powder so it wouldn't be too spicy. Just remember to refrigerate immediately for leftovers.

Ive made this twice now, and Ill admit, its pretty good. I do find it tastes "soupy". As in I can taste the cream of chicken soup . So its like Cream of Chicken Soup Enchiladas with some other flavors in there as well.  I think maybe next time ill use only 1/2 the can.

This recipe is so quick and easy.  And most importantly very delicious! To save time I bought a roasted chicken from my deli counter and replaced the picante sauce with Goya Pico de Gallo.  Will keep this one on rotation.  My fiance and I were fighting over the leftovers :)

Very good.  I replaced picante sauce with green chile sauce and used corn tortillas.  I layered like a lasagna instead of rolling them.

I love this recipe! My family ask me constantly to make this for them. I took the advise of the other reviews and warmed my shells before filling them and place them seam side down. I also got a container of the queso cheese dip from the store and as soon as I remove them from the oven I pour the cheese over top and it is delicious.

I've been craving homemade enchiladas for some time now but I didn't want any that were too saucy.  I remember seeing a commercial that used this recipe, and I made a mental note of it. Today was the day. My husband was very skeptical as he doesn't prefer the sauciness of enchiladas either. Once he took the first bite, that was all she wrote...he LOVED them! My picky 9 year old daughter even asked for seconds. I doubled this recipe for my family of 6 so that we would have left overs for another meal...since both hubby and I will take some for lunch tomorrow, only 3 remain. Next time I plan to quadruple it.  Happy eating! BTW...I didn't alter the recipe at all; perfect as is.

Oh my goodness, this was phenomenal!  It has quickly become my husband's favourite meal, and it's really easy to make.  I added 1/2 can of Rotel tomatoes to the top before baking to add a bit more spice, and also placed the tortillas seam-side down which helped seal them better.  Overall, an excellent recipe!

I love this recipe and found it first on Campbell's website. No, it is not authentic of course, but it is a family/kid friendly recipe that is easy to make and always scores well when presented on the dinner table. You can definitely change up the protein and change up the variation a bit, but we love this!

YUMMY!!! Myself, my 2 year old and my very picky husband loved these! I followed the recipe to a T. I have made a couple enchilada recipes and never made any of them again as they were not a hit at my table. But this one is a keeper! Going to be another dinner go to :)

This was a really quick and delicious meal that I made for my daughter's family while visiting them. Their small children even liked it. I made some packaged Spanish rice to accompany the enchiladas. My son-in-law called me later to thank me for making them and how much he enjoyed them. I did not roll the tortillas, but cut them into smaller pieces to make it more of a casserole. I bought rotisserie chicken from my grocery's deli that had been taken off the bone. I used a Mexican blend of cheese. It's definitely something that I will prepare again.

I made this tonight, and realized I'd made it once before.  It's just okay, and I probably won't make it again.  First off, I prefer corn tortillas, and I think the cream of chicken soup just gives a bland result.  My preference for enchiladas are those made with corn tortillas, chicken, cheese, enchilada sauce, and cilantro.

I made this last night with left-over chicken.  I made it almost to the T.  Per suggestions, I added a little cumin and used a different brand of salsa (don't care for Pace).  It was really vague.  I mean I ate it, but would never make it again.  Chicken soup and salsa and tortillas...ummm not for me again.

Great recipe that is easy to make and delicious! I used 1 cup of salsa instead of picante sauce and I use taco seasoning instead of chili powder. This recipe is a thumbs up from my family!

I have made this quite a few times and get rave reviews when I do. So easy especially if you purchase a rotisserie chicken.  I put cheese on top when I bake it.  Definitely a family favorite!

This is now a family favorite.  I add sauteed onions to the mixture because I love onions.  It is great either way and even better the next day.

These were the best enchiladas ever.  It's odd to see a few negative reviews.  They are hot, juicy and tender. Instead of tomatoes and onions on top, I added a few slices of avocado. I will make them over and over for certain!

Amazing! I don't care for enchilada sauce and this was a perfect way to make enchiladas w/out it. I didn't have any green onions so I cooked the chicken in onions and garlic to give it more flavor. I chose medium salsa for a little kick and added a ton of extra cheese (per my husband's request) on top of the tortillas. The sprinkle of tomatoes on top gave it a nice presentation, though next time I will also use the green onions. YUMMY!

Hubby loved this.  I felt it was a bit too rich (and creamy).  Next time, I will use lower fat sour cream and/or chicken soup, and maybe add the suggested black beans.

I liked this! So did everyone else. I made a few medications though. I substituted a can of cheddar cheese soup for the cream of chicken and two teaspoons of taco seasoning for the chili powder. Sprinkled a little cheese in top, backed it covered like it said but the last few minutes I took the cover off. Put a little Tabasco on top when it was done and it turned out great! Will definitely remember this one.

I've made this numerous times, and everyone I've made it for loves it so much that they now make it themselves at home!  No better compliment than that!  The fresh tomatos at the end add a little something that finishes off the dish, mmmm, so very good!

This was wonderful! I didn't have picante sauce, so I substituted mild salsa. I kept everything else as is, and the hubby and runts really enjoyed it. I warmed up the shells for a couple minutes first, then cooked them seam side down. This is definitely a keeper.

This is a really good recipe that I've been making for a few years now. It's probably our favorite chicken enchilada recipe so far. I didn't need to make any changes, and the fresh tomatoes and green onions on top really give it that extra kick of flavor.

Love this easy recipe, with a few changes. I use small corn tortillas - use two per enchilada so they stay wrapped, with the seam on the bottom. I add about a1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro and instead of one cup picante sauce, I use 1/2 cup picante and 1/2 cup fresh salsa (from the deli if I haven't made it) and I serve avocado and black beans with lime on the side.

Warming the tortillas slightly does help with the rolling.

Followed the recipe to a T, but felt it needed more a "kick" like some of the other reviews had said. I don't even like spicy food very much but it was even too bland for me. I tried this again using 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of cheddar cheese soup, and 1 can of Medium Enchilada Sauce(old el paso) and it was DELICIOUS! Also I didn't use any sour cream in the mixture, I just used it on top when it was done and baked it for 30 minutes without foil, your welcome:)

Overall delicious recipe.  The only thing I changed was the tortilla type: I used corn tortillas (be sure to warm them up before you stuff them).  They were not as authentic as I've had, but overall very tasty.

I added a couple of cloves of garlic, some diced onion and green peppers to the cooked chicken.  I also added taco seasoning to the chicken.  My family (ages 18 months, 4  and 33) all loved it.

Simplest and fastest enchiladas I've made! 5 stars for ease of preparation... but just didn't taken like "real" enchiladas. I prefer real red sauce with corn tortillas or real sour cream sauce and this was neither. Maybe something inbetween? But for a weekday meal, not bad. Husband like 'em!

3 stars. lost 1 star for calling it an enchilada...using a flour tortilla it tastes more like a burrito..please people use corn tortilla.

lost 1 star for suggesting to make it with the 98% fat free cream of chicken soup.....please people just drop dessert for the meal that healthy request stuff tastes awful!

added some chopped fire roasted red pepperthat gave it a nice flavour

LOVE this recipe!!!!  I make it all the time.  I add celery to the mix for some crunch and some onion too.  These are very good and easy to make.  I usually boil the chicken the night before and then put it all together the next day.

I have made these several times for my teenage daughter and her friends.  They would ask for them for an after school treat.  The only thing I add to this recipe is to after heating up my tortillas I spread a nice layer of heated re-fried beans then the chicken mixture.  Wonderful and easy!!

This definitely deserves 5 stars. I made this for my fiance on his birthday and he was very impressed. The only thing wrong was how tough and crunchy the bottoms of the enchiladas were when finished. Next time I will use reviewer's advice and put some of the sauce in the pan before putting in the enchiladas. Other than that they were amazing. Thank you!

SOOOOOO YUMMY!!! I do however do it slightly different (I use all ingredients though). What I do is instead of separating into two bowls I just add it all together, that way you can also have some chicken on the top as well as in the middle. Also, I add a night layer of cheese on the top. MMMMM! :)

I made these for dinner last night and they were fantastic. The only change that I made was using a can of Rotel instead of the cup of picante sauce. It added a nice kick.

I will definitely be making this one again.

My husband likes spicy Mexican foods, I do NOT--and we both love this recipe. The only thing I changed was to sprinkle some extra cheese on top of the enchiladas before cooking.

This is the BEST chicken and cheese enchilada recipe that I have ever made or tasted. My sister-in-law originally made these and my family just loved them (Thanks Carol!).  Now I make them all the time.  They are so easy and so yummy!  I can't believe that they would get a bad review!  I agree with the taco seasoning...it gives it a bit more zip...

Good basic recipe. I made this with cream of jalapeno soup instead of the cream of chicken, I added 1/2 packet of taco mix instead of the chili powder, warmed corn tortillas placed the chicken then added 1 teaspoon of the sauce mixture instead of mixing them. Much easier to roll up that way. Topped with the remaining sauce and cheese. Baked for 30 minutes. Added refried beans, rice, and guacamole and it made for a lovely dinner.

I would give this 6 stars.... by far one of the best recipes I own. Absolutely wonderful!! Wouldn't change anything. However, I do add sour cream, lettuce, tomato, and shredded cheese as garnish! My family's favorite!! Ive also substuted with ground beef just to try and that was wonderful also.

Was great, especially if you make your own flour tortillas.  Pretty quick recipe.

I've made this several times. My family loves it.  I do substitute the fresh salsa I from this website for the Picante sauce and I double the sauce.  I use whole wheat 8 inch tortilla's, low fat Mexican cheese blend  (1 cup) and low fat sour cream. Since I double the sauce I use 2 tsp chili powder and 2 tsp Chipotle chili powder which gives it an smokey zing.  Top with a dollop of sour cream and some guacamole.  Serve with Spanish rice.  The left overs are great the next day!

I didn't have any picante sauce or salsa so I used a can of hot rotel (drained), it turned out great and gave it a little bite.  I meant to saute some onions to add in the chicken mix but forgot, will definitely add next time.  Will certainly make again.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!!  I first made this at home and my family loved it!  Then I made it at work (I work in a company kitchen) and now everyone asks for it all the time.  I was asked by several people for the recipe.  Very tasty and very easy!

First time I tried this recipe was very simple. My 11 & 16 yr old cooked this for dinner. The steps were simple and easy flowing. I used the mild Picante Sauce instead of the hot kind. The flavors were very mild and the sauce alone was very creamy. Will fix again

Fantastic! Made some changes: Used pepperjack & cheddar for cheese, added garlic, soaked tomato/green onions in lime juice, cooked chicken w/ lime juice, little bit of zesty italian dressing, onions and green pepper, added diced olives to sauce. If you like it spicy as I do... add tabasco!

Such a great easy dinner... add hotter salsa to spice it up if you like things on the spicy side, great as left overs ... Can use high fiber shells to up the healthy factor

I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I added was some shredded cheese on top of the enchiladas as well. Topped enchiladas with shredded lettuce before serving. Really yummy and will definitely make again!

These were excellent! The only thing I did different was used shredded Co-jack cheese, used 4 oz (vs 2 oz) in chicken mixture, sprinkled 4 more oz on top, covered tightly with aluminum foil and baked for 50 minutes vs 40. I loved them this way but want to try taco seasoning mix in the chicken next time. Hubby loved them too and said he wanted to have the leftovers for breakfast. I don't think I'll let him do this and make him wait until lunch! Will definitely be putting this recipe into my meal rotation. We're going to a Mexican Food potluck soon and I will be making these as my contribution.

I found this recipe a few years back and I make it all the time.  My husband is not a fan of anything chicken but that's all I eat.  This is one of those meals that I can make and he eats it with no complaints.  It is also easy to make and easy to freeze for another date. I usually make 2 batches too, because we love it so much.

Delicious! I love the flavor although I used cumin instead of chili powder. Next time I will cut the sauce a bit and use a milder picante sauce. It was a bit hot for my 4 year old son. I'll also make a side dish of rice to go along with it! It's a keeper!

This was pretty good! I used corn tortillas instead of flour, and warmed them in the microwave first. I used medium Pace sauce for a little more heat. Also added spanish rice to the filling. Yummy!

So good! I modified the recipe: added taco seasoning to the shredded chicken before adding it to sauce mix; used enchilada sauce instead of picante; added black beans to the chicken; and along with  green onions and tomatoes, I topped with cheese and jalapenos. Delicious! I can't fully rate this a 5 since I didn't make it according to the recipe.

I made some modifications to make it vegetarian and a bit healthier: -substituted lowfat cream of mushroom soup -substituted nonfat plain yogurt for the sour cream -used Morningstar "chicken" -used whole grain tortillas -added a bunch of veggies - diced peppers, etc. Turned out really yummy! -also added some cumin for more flavor.

These were awesome - even my picky husband liked them! I couldn't find the 'Pace Picante Sauce' so I used a jar of store brand 'enchilada sauce'. I put a little extra cheese on top too. Very yummy & I will be making them again for sure!

I added a little more picante sauce, but other than that kept it exactly the same.  Delicious!

I was a little skeptical at first.  But this recipe sounded like something my boyfriend's mom used to make that he loved... so I decided to give it a whirl.  It was suprisingly yummy.  Different than my traditional enchiladas... but deliciious nonetheless.  For those looking for a little more kick... use a medium or hot salsa.

This was okay. Simple to prepare, however, the flavors didn't come together all that well - I tasted the sour cream & salsa, while my S/O tasted only the cream of chicken soup (and why use chicken soup?). My S/O would eat it again, he said, but I wouldn't without some major changes.

This was a big hit with the husband.  As another reviewer suggested, I added a package of taco seasoning to the sour cream mixture.  My package of tortillas came with eight and I found I had enough filing to use all eight with what the recipe yeilded. I added some cheddar cheese right before it finished baking and also added black olives to the top  along with the tomatoes and green onions.  We will definitely have this again.

We gobbled these up! Pretty easy to make and a delicious result. I would have used white instead of whole grain tortillas so they were softer and easier to cut with your fork when eating. Also no need to warm the tortillas first just fold them under and you’re good!

My family all really likes this one, especially my 14 and 15 year old boys! I have actually been making it for many years so I am not sure why I have not rated it until now. The only thing I have done differently is to make more like a batch and a half of the  sauce/chicken mix.

This was delicious! I added a 4oz can of diced green chiles to the soup mix and used 2 tsp of taco seasoning (instead of chili powder) and followed the rest of the recipe as is, though it did fill more than 6 tortillas, so you may want to have a few extra on hand. So tasty!  Will definitely make again!

Few changes :). I doubled it and used one can of healthy request cream of cheddar and one of chicken. I also used low-fat sour cream and put in a packet of taco seasoning for the spices. I sprayed the pan and put some Mexican rice under the enchiladas. Covered the top with low-fat Mexican cheese. So good!

I make this all the time.  Love it!!! I put a layer of salsa on the bottom of the baking dish so they don't dry up.  I use flour tortillas and always add a bit more sour cream and salsa to make the the batch a bit bigger.

This time I made rice and added black beans and salsa to the rice. Place the rice and beans around the dish and it made a really nice meal! So easy to make.

Awesome! The thing my husband has liked the best so far. The only thing I would change is only 1 tbsp of chili powder. I think it's a bit much for my personal taste.

I followed the recipe as written the only thing I did different was sprinkle a very small amount of Monterey Jack cheese on top for presentation. It turned out great, I loved it and so did my husband. I will make this again.

Ok so mine came out DELICIOUS! But I did make a few changes. Instead of picante sauce I used salsa mild dip. I also excluded the tomato, but i cooked my chicken with sautéed onions and mixed peppers. I also added cayenne pepper for a little kick. And it came out amazing! This is definitely on my list of favorite foods to make in under an hour.

I have made this numerous times and each time experimenting with a different addition. (Ortega roasted chilies, sliced black olives,  beans, etc.) This is a wonderful recipe for QUICK  cravings of enchiladas. Made as-is, it's a little blah but good. Heat the tortillas to help with wrapping and use corn, not flour.  **Update, May 2018 - I strongly recommend seam side down or you will have a floppy mess on your hands. I've also done this by layering like a lasagna, too...less work.

Honestly, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it was a total let down. The flavor of the enchiladas is ok, very flavorful as is. My problem was the texture- the tortillas were soggy by the time I took them out and they didn't taste anything like enchiladas I'm used to. I'm sure for some it is really good, just not my cup of tea.

This is a family favorite for sure! The only changes other than using 2 store bought rotisserie chicken breasts per each 6 person serving, was that in the directions, as I just made a quadruple batch, it doesn't multiply the amount of sour cream, soup, picante and chili powder mixture added to the chicken and cheese. You should add one extra cup of of the soup mixture per each 6 person serving. I could literally make this with my eyes shut. I also omit the green onions and tomatoes as the enchiladas themselves have enough flavor and density. Also, after spraying each pan with non stick cooking spray, I also spread a little of the soup mixture into the bottom of the pan. The final results are amazing and it's even better as leftovers the next day!

Line pan with 1/2 jar taco sauce and top enchiladas with remaining taco sauce and shredded cheddar cheese. Adding black beans makes it a nice, heavier meal.

The recipe is great.  I followed it with the exceptions of 1 teaspoon of chile powder.  I used medium picante sauce.  I also covered the bottom to the pan with canned enchilada sauce and topped them with the remaining sauce from the can..  Thank you for another easy, great tasting recipe.

Loved this. Switched chilli powder for taco seasoning because my wife and son can't stand spice. Also used cheddar cheese because it was on hand. If you make it this way, a small side of jalapeños might go nice with this if anyone sharing the dish likes a bit of a kick.

This is a family favorite at my house. I usually make a double batch. I also use medium sauce or real Enchilada sauce in place of the picante. Sometimes I add black beans as well. My kids friends always want the recipe for their house. Such an easy meal.

Fantastic recipe.  I would highly recommend using a medium heat picante sauce if you enjoy a little kick in your meal.  Easy, quick, and oh so delicious.

My family loves this, with a few modifications. We like them extra saucy, so I double the wet ingredients, and add one extra tbspn of chili powder. I've used canned chicken, leftover chicken, frozen diced grilled chicken, and fresh chicken. All work equally well, but with frozen, I defrost first.

Delicious and easy. I tend to add more cheese on the top before putting it in the oven. I use taco seasoning instead of "plain" chili powder. My last trick is to parboil chicken breasts, then use my KitchenAide with the mixing paddle to shred them beautifully. Also, have extra tortillas ready, because the fewest that my mix has made was eight (8) when using 6" tortillas.

My family and I loved it (even my picky 4 year old)! I used 8 inch tortillas instead of 6, so I did add about 3/4 of a can of black beans to the filling to accommodate the larger shells.

5 stars for simplicity as a 'base' recipe..I used seasoned, grilled chicken strips & added coriander, cumin & cayenne with the chili powder. Cilantro is one of my favorite herbs so that always a great flavorful garnish for my Mexican meals..this is my go-to Mexican meal with a side of blk beans, rice- I've added corn since my kids love it but it's this is a simple, versatile recipe. 5 stars all day

This recipe was okay... It was fine for dinner but not one I'd make for guests. I made it just like the recipe states and my husband and I both thought the sour cream was too overpowering (funny thing to say about sour cream). I can say it was better as left overs. Maybe it needed a day for the spices to sink in real good.

A family favorite. I double the recipe and use 1 can of cream of chicken and one can of cheddar cheese soup. I also use taco sauce instead of picante and a couple dashes of Sriracha. I use healthy request soups and light sour cream and reserve some of the cheese for the top. I make a vegetarian version for my daughter by only using the cheddar cheese soup and omitting the chicken and leaving the rest the same. She loves it. Thanks for a great recipe that the whole family can enjoy:)

I've made this recipe a million times and really enjoyed it.  No, it's not authentic enchiladas, or spicy cheesiness.  But it's a great family recipe that kids and adults love.  After baking, I always have a little taco bar with black olives, sour cream and green onions and everyone loves it!!  Great basic recipe that you can customize!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I have always made it exactly as described. However recently I have been looking for ways to lower my carb intake and instead of tortillas I used zucchini boats.  I actually liked them better this way believe it or not. I halved a few zucchinis and hollowed out the middle. Heavily salted both sides and let sit for 15 minutes (key to ensure the enchiladas don’t come out too watery) then rinsed and patted dry before filling with enchilada mix. Bake as usual.

Made this for dinner for my meat and cheese boyfriend and he asked for seconds. We both thuoght it was bland and will add more chili powder and a habanero for nest time. Made it this time with a few dashes of red cayenne powder and diced jalepenos that brought it up to the mild moderate level most people like. Also adding cheese during last 10 minutes was a definite plus.

This recipe came out excellent with a few modifications of course.  I did not have cream of chicken but I did have cream of mushroom soup and it turned out great.  Also I left out the picante and sour cream sauce within the mixture.  Instead I used them as toppings.  Lastly I added rice which helped to absorb alot of the soup and cheese.  Other than that this was very easy to prepare and tasted wonderful!

This was aboslutely easy and delicious! I pre cooked my chicken in cubes in a frying pan with some butter. I ended up shredding it before I mixed the mixture together. I added some seasonings instead of chili powder: paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and red chili flakes. I broiled them for about 3 minutes before I took them out and they went like hot cakes! DEFINETLY a must have! Everyone was so impressed. Note, I used mixed cheese and I used herdez salsa.

I have made this tons of times. Very easy and delicious.  I like to add rice into the tortilla as well.

This was great! I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I also added 4oz. cream cheese to the soup mixture and added a can of black beans to the chicken filling. Yummy!!!

This was a tasty recipe, but there was too much sauce in my opinion.  Next time I will halve the amount of sauce both in and on top of the enchiladas.

Mine turned out more like a casserole, but for the best! I only had my large bread pan available (the other at my mom's house), so I packed the enchiladas in with a little of the sauce between each layer, turned out GREAT! Just cut into slices and serve. Even my husband who doesn't like sour cream said he'd eat it again!

I thought it was delicious!! It was a bit spicy though! We doubled the recipe because there were several of us eating it so we only had one can of the chicken soup so instead of using two cans of chicken we used one can of the chicken soup and one can of cheddar cheese soup. Only one tsp chili powder. No onions and after it had baked we topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and popped it back in the oven for a few more minutes.

Didn't use tomato or green onion because we don't like them, but other than that, it was great!  I also used my food processor to shred the chicken, which made it faster to prepare! I would definitely make again.

My family LOVES these! We alter the the recipe slightly using Pace medium salsa (which I puree first in the blender as my kids and hubby won't eat "chunks"), only half the chili powder (1 tsp), and doubling the cheese (I use sharp cheddar). I also never measure the chicken, generally using just one very large chicken breast. These still have a good kick, but are not too spicy for my 15 month old.

This recipe has been a HIT!  I first made it for my husband, who's a little picky about his Mexican food, but he loved it and I had no leftovers (even though it's not "authentic")!  I doubled the recipe and had friends over and they and my husband battled out a game over who would get the last enchilada.  So it's a keeper!  The only thing I changed is that I used homemade salsa instead of the Pace; we're not big Pace fans.  But other than that it was great!

I used a can of Campbell's Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup (instead of the cream of chicken) and omitted the sour cream.  This was delicious!  My hubby said they are the best enchiladas he's ever had!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was DELICIOUS! I followed the previous poster's recommendation to put the seam side down - as I don't see how they would stay closed without doing this. I also added a little extra chili powder and some cumin. I will definitely make this again, we were very pleased. 5 stars!

This recipe is always a hit at my place.  Even with picky kids and grandmas!  I use grilled shredded chicken that I crust with EVOO and various spices-garlic, cumin, cayenne, etc.  I think this adds some extra flavor.  I also add about 1/4 cup more sour cream and picante then the recipe asks for.  Maybe this drowns out the "soupy" flavor folks have mentioned?   One other suggestion: make this up the day before- not sure why but it always seems to taste better that way?
