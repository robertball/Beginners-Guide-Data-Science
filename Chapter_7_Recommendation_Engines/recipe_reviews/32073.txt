I think 3 cups of water or broth may not be enough for 2 cups of bulgur. Usually I put 2 1/2 cups of water for 1 cup of bulgur.

Anlarm and JennPB. Actually, Anlarm, the broth is should be about in the middle. I like the raito of broth to bulgur at 2:1. It shouldn't be tender or mushy but firm and chewy. More so than say converted rice. BUT if you like it... GREAT! and Jenn, really, it needs the butter if not to brown the meat to give it that wonder full carmelization full of flavor and appearence then the butter flavor for the bulger (bughlur in Armenian). Again, however, if you like it that way... GREAT! It might be said now that bulgur is high in protien and bran and soooo yummo. My non-Armenian wife and Asian decent buddy live for this when I make it (my family recipe coming soon so look for it. Authentic and easily made in a rice cooker).

Geddamame, I feel bad for you. This stuff is great no matter how you throw the dice. Tabbulli is GREAT! Good stuffing for roasted chicken with herbs, shallots, garlic etc.

I use canned tomatoes instead and this recipe is one of my kids favorites. Doubles well but stir throughout.

I have made this recipe several times with beef or lamb, adding some herbs to complement the meat (usually Italian seasoning with beef and rosemary etc. with lamb).  I put everything in a casserole dish in a moderate oven for an hour or so, adding the bulgar 30 minutes before we want to eat.  Most of the time I don't even bother to brown the meat (saves on all that butter) and I always use tinned tomatoes.  Easy and delicious!

This is such a simple dish, I was surprised at how yummy it is. I did throw in a little extra seasoning: some thyme, turmeric, and ground coriander seeds, a snitch of cumin, and some fresh garlic sauteed with the onion.

The family liked it... we didn't have Bulgur so I used 1 c. Barley with 2.5 cups water and 2.5t chicken bouillon.  I also followed the advice of one of the previous posts & put some turmeric, coriander, and cumin seeds in it, and cooked about 1 T. minced garlic with the onions.  
Not a bad way to use leftovers!
