This is a great tasting recipe. You can eat the Sauerkraut on a bratwurst or just eat it on the side as a salad. Very pretty to look at too.

Very good relish recipe, esp. for topping on brats...however, you do NOT NEED the amount of sugar that the recipe states...I used 1/3 c. of sugar instead, and it turned out excellent!

I made this for a family cookout this weekend and everyone liked it.  The only change I made was to cut down on the sugar since most of us don't like sweet relish.

My version uses a hot bacon dressing (using only 2 tablespoons of brown sugar) poured over the top of the sauerkraut and peppers. My daughter eats it straight from the bowl.

Love this recipe.  When I serve it some top their hot dogs, brats, or burgers while others eat it as a side dish.  I use about a 1/2 cup of sugar and if I feel it is too tart/sour before serving I just add more sugar.  I've also substitured sweetner for the sugar.  It lasts for weeks in the refrigerator just like pickles!

I really enjoyed this on brats and burgers!  But, I think it scared ;my guests who mostly passed over it b/c I think they weren't sure what it was even though I tried to tell most of them.  Those who did have it liked it.  Not very appealing to look at, but then again most sauerkraut isn't!  Worth a try if you're looking for something extra for the bbq spread!

If there's one thing I can't stand on hotdogs, it's store-bought relish.  Yuck!  But THIS relish is to die for!!!!  Soooo yummy!  Outstanding on hotdogs and brats, but also makes a great summer salad for any kind of grilled meat.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  It's a keeper!!!!

I should have doubled the recipe. I made it as the recipe said but once we had tried it, it was so good, I knew I should have made more.
