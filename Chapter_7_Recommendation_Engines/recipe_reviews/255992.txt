Easy Grilled Chicken Marinade Haiku: "Decent marinade. Not outstanding, but not bad. It's easy to make." No question about the ease of putting this marinade together, and I left two chicken breasts halves in about one cup's worth of it overnight, then grilled the chicken to serve with salad and broccoli. I'm always glad to try out a new marinade recipe but typically fall back on AR's "Pretty Chicken" as a tried and true fave.
