Believe all these raving reviews.  It really is that good!  I made this for a dinner party of 15 people last night with a 5 1/2 lb. tenderloin.  I was worried about timing the preparation of the meat along with the other sidedishes, so I prepared some of this ahead of time.  I roasted the shallots & boiled the wine/broth combination the day before and stored these in the refrigerator.  Then I cooked the bacon a couple of hours ahead of time, set it aside to cool and allowed the pan it cooked in to sit on the stovetop.  I took the suggestion of a couple of other posters and put the wine/broth mix, the bacon & shallots into the blender to make a smooth sauce.  This was really wonderful!  After roasting the tenderloin, I poured the smooth sauce into the same pan, whisked in the butter and flour and Voila! - an incredible tasting gravy to spoon over a moist & tender cut of meat.  I did roast the tenderloin longer because many of my guests like beef more well done.  Even with that, it still could be cut with a fork.  My husband and I can't wait to try this again with a more medium rare piece of meat.  I've tried many wonderful dishes from Allrecipes, but this one is the very best.

I served this for xmas dinner. I was very nervous because I've never served beef tenderloin. Everything turned out perfect. One guest called the next day and told me it was the best, most tender meat he and his wife ever had. I had a 4.5 pound tenderloin instead of the 2 pounds that the recipe called for but I did NOT double the amount of the sauce. I still had leftoever sauce. (the sauce was wonderful on the garlic mashed potatoes which I prepared the night before...I also made a broccoli casserole I found on this site and prepared the night before, too...just heated the side dishes 45 min. before serving time and they tasted great). I had six adults total and I had some leftovers of the tenderloin which is always better to have more than enough. One male guest must have had four slices of it...he raved about the meal. I made beef stew with the leftovers. I did take other suggestions and blended the shallots/bacon/sauce ahead of time. I fried the bacon earlier in the day and kept the grease in the pan and left the pan in my cooled garage for the day, and heated it up when I was ready to brown the tenderloin. Make sure you do some steps ahead so you're not spending all the time in the kitchen while your guests are there. All I can say is...if you really want to impress someone...make this meal! Just remember as many steps ahead as possible to save time! Expensive, but worth it for a special occasion!

I made this for Christmas dinner this year & it was great.  I bought a 5 lb. beef tenderloin from Costco, cut it in half & froze the 2nd half.  I was serving 6 people & 2-1/2 lbs. was plenty.  While I was roasting the shallots I also roasted 3 heads of garlic with the tops trimmed off, drizzled with olive oil & some salt.  The garlic needs about 15 minutes more than the shallots to get really tender. I roasted the meat as directed but it took my piece closer to 45 min. to reach the desired med. rare temp.  The sauce worked beautifully.  I used ruby port.  I added the chopped bacon back to the sauce but opted to serve the shallots and roasted garlic next to the sliced beef on a platter so the kids(who don't like shallots) could enjoy the sauce on the garlic mashed potatoes.  This was my first beef tenderloin and it was as so tender you could cut it with a butter knife & extremely flavorful.  I saw some other reviewers recommend that you puree the sauce but I think that the texture of this sauce is intended to be somewhat thin and blending the shallots in would make it thick and lumpy.  I will definitely use this recipe when I cook the 2nd half!  UPDATE:  This sauce is my new favorite sauce recipe for any type of roasted beef.  It's very simple and you don't even need the bacon or shallots.  The last time I made it I used Zinfandel instead of Port.  I used it for sliced tri-tip and it was incredible.  It even reheats really well if you thin it just a bit with some water.

The 1st time I made this was on 12/24/03 for 7 adults and 2 children. Everyone loved it! My 2 yr couldn't get enough.  Using 7 1/2 lbs of meat I had abt 1/3 leftover.  I read all the reviews & made some changes based on them.  I made the sauce the day before & I was glad I did b/c it had time to flavor through. I used cabernat instead of port and added a 2 TBLS of brown sugar to it. Definitely double the sauce.  I tripled it & had just enough.  DEFINITELY use as many shallots as the recipe calls for if not more, they are wonderful.  They MAKE this recipe.  I pureed half of the shallots after I had roasted them as others suggested and was happy with the outcome.  I added some minced garlic to the sauce as well. It was wonderful.  I did NOT add any salt.  Be sure to let your meat sit 15 min after coming out of the oven (tented) so the juices can reabsorb.  I served it w/ garlic roasted mashed potatoes & glazed carrots. I will defintely make it again EXACTLY as I made it this time.  Mushrooms would make a great addition for those who like them.  If you don't want to spend the cash on the tenderloin, the sauce would be fantastic on just abt anything.  I have made it many more times since then & it always turns out fantastic.

This a wonderful recipe. I changed 2 things. I pulsed the roasted shallots in a blender for a few seconds so that the texture of the gravy was smoother and I made the gravy in advance and added the drippings from the roasting pan when the meat came out of the oven

Made this for a dinner party for ten. Used a "prime" tenderloin that was stratosphereicly priced, but worth it for those special parties. I took the advice of other reviewers and served this with Jasmine rice to fully capture the sauce and a medley of steamed vegtables that were finished with "burnt" butter over the top just before placing on the plate. I also used beef broth with 50% less sodium. Much better with less salt than my trial run with this receipe.

This was fantastic! The recipe sounds difficult but don't let it scare you. The first time around it takes some time to prepare, but once you've familiarized yourself with the directions it's not hard at all! Also, while tenderloin is great, those of you on a budget can use any type of beef. Just let the salt and spice mixture sit longer so that it tenderizes.

This recipe was great!  Everyone loved it.  I also used red wine and brown sugar instead of port wine.  I also put roasted mushrooms in it.  I had a couple of people literally licking their plates!  I will definitely make this again.

I just served this tonight for a dinner party and it was THE HIT!  My guests went crazy and said this was better than any fine restaurant.  I splurged and went with a beautiful tenderloin and it was worth it.  I served the filets with rice pilaf and roasted veggies.  This is a major winner and a definite keeper!  Oh, and I didn't have port wine, so I used a non-alcoholic red wine and a touch of brown sugar and it was great.

I prepared this dish for my friends on the millenium New Year's Eve and everyone just raved about it. They all thought I spent hours preparing it -- boy were they fooled. It was actually very, very easy to make.

I prepared this recipe for Christmas dinner for twenty-one people; it was wonderful!  As an inexperienced cook for such a large number of people, I was nervous. This recipe got RAVE reviews.  I had (2) 6 lb. beef tenderloins, both of which I  cut in half for easier handling.  I kept had the oven at 375 degrees, but cooked for about 45 minutes (rather than 25 minutes).  All four pieces were in a roasting pan. They came out perfect.  I had more than enough sauce by starting with seven cans of low sodium beef broth.  Using the allrecipes.com recipe scaling tool and by entering the # of servings, I found the ratios required for that much beef broth.  There was one little problem in scaling.   Initially, I used the scaling tool to find the ratios for a 6 lb. roast.  The recipe scaled for 18 people, but 6 lbs of tenderloin would not be enough meat for 18.  Our group of 21 ate about 10 lbs of tenderloin.  Also, the tip on allrecipes.com regarding peeling the shallots was extremely helpful. Cut of the tips of the shallots, drop in boiling water for a minute, drain, then peel.  This was very easy, since I had to peel more than 3 lbs of shallots. I made all of this and the side dishes (see allrecipes' Baked Mashed Potatoes) the same day.  I started cooking the 3 side dishes at 11:00 am and we ate at 5 pm.  Wonderful recipe; thank you Christine L.!

Bouef Tenderloin is always a hit and east to cook. Although it is an expensive cut it is the least flavourful and requires thoughtful preparatin and accompanying creation. If possible ask yur butcher in advance of your dinner supply a well aged cut (21 days) and I reccomend that the roast should be rested to room temperature in advance of cooking. By all means rub in herbs (never spices) and avoid salt to start, unless you can assure a good non iodized sea salt, (such as Maldon) and even then, sparingly. For a perfect sauce Instead of adding butter/flour, make a brown-roux in advance and add to strained sauce. A brown-roux is still flour and butter (or beef renderings) slowly cooked  and then this nuty treat is added to the simmering sauc to provide a velvety smooth much flavoured rendition to a formal dinner table. This meal needs a starch and  a good red Burgandy to finish.

This turned out amazing. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I made some minor adjustments. I used more wine than called for and cooked the roast in a dutch oven with additional thyme and beef stock. Halfway through I drained the liquid into the wine/stock mixture and further reduced it. I also cut down on the butter and used 5 slices of extra thick smoked bacon instead of 3. My husband raved.. pare this with brussel sprouts sauteed in bacon and red onion.. really good!

Most tender, flavorful meal Ive ever made and had! Guests were impressed.   This is how i made things more simple:  1. roasted shallots night before. 2. also made port/broth sauce night before. 3. put the shallots on the reduced port/broth sauce and kept on fridge overnight.  (next day, day to serve this meal):  4. fried bacon. add bacon on the sauce. let sit while i prepped the tenderloin. 5. brown tenderloin, where bacon cooked. stick in oven. 6. strained the shallot/bacon sauce. 7. deglazed the pan where i browned tenderloin with little port then poured sauce on it. simmer. 8. made roux on separate sauce pan. then added the sauce when the flour has browned.whisk remaining butter in it. 9. get the tenderloin after 30 min (perfect medium well.not too pink nor bloody). let it rest. slice then pour sauce over it.rest of sauce go on gravy boat. Serve and enjoy!

I often cook for large groups and am always on the lookout for recipes that are easy to make in larger quantities as well as easy to serve. This one is EXCELLENT for large groups. Much has been said in other reviews about the difficulty of the sauce. Rubbish. Make the sauce a day or two ahead of time. It will keep nicely in the refrigerator and then just add a little water to reheat it. I chose not to puree my sauce as I liked the chunkiness. I also sauteed a mixture of different mushrooms and spooned them over the meat before topping with sauce. Remember that your roast will continue cooking even while resting after removing it from the oven, usually 10 degrees or so, so plan ahead. Also, I forgot to use the tomato paste and I don't think it was missed. The sauce is completely awesome and I will definitely make this again.

Most delicious recipe.  The gravy is devine.  I'll probably never make a tenderloin roast any other way.

The first time I made it it turned out delicious, however, I ruined a roasting pan trying to follow the directions :).  I never tried to brown anything in a roasting pan on top of the stove before and will never again  -- maybe it's different for gas stoves?  My husband had to open all the windows and doors to get the smoke out.  

The second time I made it I used a large skillet for the bacon and browning and then trasferred it to a roasting pan.

Thanks for such a great recipe.

I've never made a premium roast or elaborate special-occasion meal, but after reading the reviews I decided to try this. Everyone raved about it, commenting after every bite about how good it was. It took time but wasn't hard at all, even as a beginner. I followed the recipe but doubled the sauce as others recommended and was glad I did. I also agree that cooking the center to 125 degrees isn't enough for a med-rare 2-3 lb. tenderloin (I used a 2.5 lb. cut that fed 5 large portions), and I believe in true med-rare meat with a warm red center. It actually worked to pull it out at 125, cut 2 slices off each end, and put the rest back in the oven for 10 min. Then it all ended up med-rare, instead of a range of med-well to med-rare from the outsides in. I would've used more thyme, and wouldn't add any salt, the sauce has enough from the broth/bacon, and this comes from someone who likes salt. I chopped the shallots after roasting and diced the bacon into small pieces so the sauce was thicker w/ little lumps instead of thin w/ big lumps. I agree you should use all the shallots, they are wonderful! I served over garlic mashed potatoes (based on Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes from here - amazing!) w/garlic/olive oil-sauteed asparagus.  I worried when the port-beef reduction reeked of wine, but it was balanced in the final sauce.  I also worried when I tried a piece of the baking meat and it tasted like bacon, but it was subtle at the end.  Thanks for sharing, try it and enjoy!

Feel that the serving size is understated because this is truly a taste sensation. My 5# roast fed 5 people with no leftovers. Yes everyone had 2nd helpings. Did not use any bacon and the sauce was perfect. A perfect tasty roast that is costly but worth every penny for a special dinner!

This was amazing.  An easy thing to prepare with it is rosemary potatoes -- it requires the same temperature on the oven.  Basically, cut the amount of potatoes you want into wedges, toss with oil, salt, pepper, and rosemary.  Cook for 30-40 minutes depending on how brown you like it.

This particular dish, I found even better the next day.  We had lots of left overs, so I layered the slices with the sauce in a caserole dish.  I heated it up in the dish at 350 degrees the next day, and the sauce seeped even more into the meat and it was amazingly tender.

This is TOO FUNNY...I went to the store after work(Valentine's Day) and the few remaining shallots could have passed as raisins.  I salvaged what I could.  Beef tenderloin was "SOLD OUT" (I am beginning to sweat. I figured EVERYONE must be making this for their Valentine.)  I substituted with pork tenderloin.  I get home...the oven, only a year old, BREAKS DOWN.  AHHHHH!  I was determined to maked this as the special dinner. I prepared ALL OF IT on the range top (pan roasting and other creative methods) and it was WONDERFUL.  My Valentine was more than impressed!  MAKE THIS DISH.  IT IS VERY FORGIVING!

The meat was tender but that's because it's $6 per pound tenderloin.  The sauce was overrated.  The shallots were yummy but I didn't like the port wine flavor at all.  It was too overpowering.  I cooked it down as stated and added it to the meat's drippings, but my drippings did not amount to much since it seemed to evaporate as it cooked.  Perhaps covering the meat or adding some (more) broth to the drippings would have diluted the strong grape flavor of the wine.  Next time I'll opt for regular au jus.

The reviews are spot-on.  I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it.  The sauce takes some effort but was well worth it.  To reduce the time spent cooking while the guests were here I did several things the night before.  I cooked up the bacon and refrigerated the grease overnight to sear the tenderloin in.  I also reduced the the broth, port and tomato paste, and roasted the shallots and put them all in the refrigerator overnight.  I took everything out about 45 minutes before cooking to let it come to room temperature (including the beef).  To finish off the sauce I followed the recommendations and put it all in the blender before serving.  I didn't quite make it smooth -- just got rid of the big shallot and bacon pieces.  It was a very special meal, but one that didn't require a lot of work the day of -- perfect in my book.

We had quite a bit leftover, so later in the week I cubed the beef, and put the gravy in a pan with some sliced carrots on medium for about 45 minutes.  Boiled up some egg noodles, and dropped the beef cubes in the sauce for a couple minutes.  It made a great stroganoff and felt like the "leftovers" were a completely new meal.  Fast too!

This will be the fourth time that I have made this recipe....and I keep perfecting the recipe each time.  This recipe is out of this world.  I made it for my family on Sunday night and then was asked to make it again on Tuesday night for my boyfriend's family.  I suggest doubling the sauce for some mashed potatoes or garlic bread for dipping.  Instead of port I used Three Blind Moose (love that stuff) Cabernet wine.  Will do this recipe for all the holidays as well.  What a hit.  I also suggest doing all the prep work (making the sauce, trimming the fat off the meat) beforehand if you are having a dinner party.  It is time consuming.

I made this for my boss who we invited over for dinner.  Although there are many different steps it was so easy and very impressive to the guests.  The taste was fantastic!  I followed the recommendation of cooking the broth and roasting the shallots the night before and another thing that the recipe doesn't mention is that you should tie up your tenderloin so that it cooks evenly.  This will definitely be put in my recipe classics and I will be serving this again soon.

WOW!  This is an incredible way to celebrate a special occasion.  I made this entree for last night's Christmas Eve dinner.  I doubled the recipe, used low-sodium beef broth, and added 8 oz. of sliced baby portabellos right at the end of the gravy's cooking time.  It was a bit time consuming but I did many steps in advance so I wouldn't have to spend the whole evening in the kitchen.  The flavor is incredible and my guests absolutely raved.  There wasn't a SCRAP leftover!  I served the tenderloin with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, fresh rolls, a green salad, and corn casserole.  It was truly the best meal I think I've ever prepared, and I cook a lot!  THANK YOU!!

This sauce is a stand alone masterpiece.  Doesn't matter what you serve it with, you will always get compliments.  College Inn Sirloin Beef Stock totally rocks this recipe. It's already a flavorful stock but once you reduce it, it's phenomenal! I could go on & on but I'm running out of "characters remaining". Oh yeah, the tenderloin was good too. LOL. :o) :o)

Wow, this was simply wonderful.  I substituted pork tenderloin for the beef and my family loved it.  This recipe is a bit expensive and very labor intensive but absolutely worth it.  Make sure to double the sauce because it is incredible.  If possible it is worth it to double the entire recipe and freeze half for another meal (same amount of work for two meals). I suggest watching the shallots very closely while roasting, otherwise they may burn.  I set the timer for thirty minutes and they ended up black so I had to send my husband out to get more.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe.

I have to give this 5 stars, simply because the end result is so delightful!  It is so wrong to make any sauce by adding uncooked flour to liquid, and that is the only change I made.  I did not drain off any drippings and added approximately 2-3 TBS of butter and 2-3 TBS of flour to the pan and cooked that for about 3-4 minutes, removed the pan from the heat, added the broth/wine mixture and simmered until done.  Yummy!!

This was excellent.  I reduced the wine sauce the day before and let it sit refrigerated overnight.  I added mushrooms to the roasted shallots and blended the whole sauce when complete for a smoother texture.  I couldn't find the size tenderloin roast I wanted (small) so I bought 3 thick tenderloin steaks and cooked them as instructed (to 140 degrees instead of 125, gave just the perfect amount of pink inside).  I served this for Valentine's Day dinner with my boyfriend, he was wowed.  A great special occasion dinner and not difficult.

Fantastic recipe and very impressive with little work.  I doubled the recipe to serve 15 and followed the instructions as written.  I used a 6 lb tenderloin but I cut it in half (wouldn't fit in my roasting pan) and assumed that the cooking time would be the same/similar for two 3 lb roasts as for one 2 lb roast.  Boy was I off!  Fortunately most of my guests were late, it took over an hour to cook to 155 degrees (perfect for my guests who prefer their meat medium).  If you cook to 125 as written, your meat will be pretty rare.  The sauce was delicious, although it requred a little more flour/water paste to thicken to my taste.  As suggested, I roasted the shallots, cooked the bacon (save the grease to brown your roast), and reduced the wine and broth a day ahead, all of which made my life a lot easier the day of my party.  My only suggestion is to know how long your size of roast will take to cook, I was very embarrased by the delay.  Also, go to a real butcher instead of the grocery.  I got my tenderloin at $6.99 a pound, much more affordable than the grocery and they will trim off the nasty silver skin and tie up the skinny end to make a nice, symmetrical roast.  I ended up with no leftover meat but plenty of leftover sauce, which I sent home with a couple of my guests to use on their own roasts the next day.

This recipe is incredible.  I made it for Easter dinner and my kids loved it and husband said it was one of the best dishes he'd ever had.  He travels all over the world and eats out at fancy restaurants a lot, so that is a huge compliment.  I did not use a tenderloin roast, though.  The smallest cut at the store was 6 pounds and the price was too high, so the butcher encouraged me to use the filet mignon steaks that are individually wrapped and injected with a solution for tenderness. I was leary of going that route, but it was delicious and less expensive, for basically the same cut of meat, not to mention the cooking time was shorter.  I served the filets on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes, with a mandarin orange lettuce salad on the side.  This recipe is incredible. Thank you!

OMG!!! This was great. I used some of the suggestions from other cooks and reduced my sauce down the day before. I did add the roasted garlic along with the shallots because I like garlic. The only other thing I added was a dash of cinnamon. I know it sounds crazy but I have a recipe that has been handed down from my grandmother for a sauce similar to this and it calls for a dash of it. I also seasoned my meat the night before and wrapped it up and put it in the fridge until about an hour before cooking. This will now be our dinner for special occasions! I am even planning on teaching my son to cook it to impress a special someone. Thank you soooo very much for sharing. Your recipe may play a part in my future grandkids!!!

I had honestly never cooked a beef tenderloin but thought I'd try this.  WOW!  First of all, if you're short on time or money, don't do it!  But if you ever have a special occasion, this is the recipe to try.  I doubled the shallots and sauce (as some reviewers had mentioned) and added some carrots.  Used a 2 lb. tenderloin as stated in the recipe.  I will say that cooking to 125 didn't quite do it for me.  I cooked to 140 and it was still pretty red.  Also, the prep time of 15 minutes is way off!  So don't come home from work hoping to make this.  Just boiling the wine mixture for 30 minutes takes care of that 15 minutes prep time.  BUT - The time spent is worth it.  This is just as good as anything you get in any restaurant.  Make sure you follow the recipe.  Don't use red cooking wine - go for the Port (you're already spending a ton of money so why not?).  I served it with garlic smashed potatoes and a glass of red wine.  Creme Brulee would have been a perfect dessert.  What a wonderful meal. A+ from me.

The sauce was absolutely incredible and definitely worth the time it took to make it.  The recipe was very easy to follow and the results are incredible.  Excellent!  I wish I could give it more stars.  I didn't use a whole tenderloin since it was only my husband and my 3-year-old daughter.  I made 2 tenderloin steaks and it was fabulous.  A word to the wise, I also made a mistake when buying the shallots.  I forgot that they're part of the onion/garlic family and never checked at the store to see if they were fresh, so make sure you don't run into the same problem I had.  Three of the shallots that I bought were starting to spoil - they were mushy and were starting to smell funky.  Fortunately, I had purchased 2 bags of shallots and had enough to make the sauce.  I just carefully picked through the shallots and discarded the pieces that were starting to go bad.  Next time I won't make that mistake.  This recipe will definitely be used again and again, and I can't wait to share it with company and "wow" them.

WOW! This was great. I used a cheaper cut of meat to make a roast beef but followd same directions. The sauce is incredible. I left the shallots in the sauce (without blending them as some suggested) because they were so sweet & yummy & attractive. Think some musrooms would be a great addition. If you are on a budget (and who isn't) this recipe can be modified & still very delicious!

This was an AMAZING recipe!!!  I have never attempted making beef tenderloin before, I thought it to be too challenging for me.  Well, this recipe was easy to follow and it tasted like we were eating a 5 star restauraunt meal in our own home!!  The port wine sauce with the shallots (which I have never cooked before-and they are amazing) was so unbelievably tasteful!!  I sauteed mushrooms seperate, and added them after the sauce was done cooking-which gave it a little extra body to the sauce (and we LOVE mushrooms with our steak) :o) To sum it up, this recipe was SPECTACULAR!!!

I didn't use the shallots as I could find them ,but the sauce was the best I have ever had. I used a 2000 red Italian dessert wine we have had for years since it was Sunday and I couldn't buy port. This was fabulous as leftovers too! It took me over 2 hours to reduce it but I would do it again in a heartbeat! Served with roasted potatoes. I cant wait for an opportunity to make this again.

Excellent! This is truly delicious as written. With the price of tenderloin it pays to choose a recipe carefully. This one should not disappoint. We happen to like meat a little more done so we cook it a bit longer but that is purely personal preference.

Wonderful!  made this last year for xmas dinner, plan to do the same this year.  Bought a 5lb Beef Tenderloin at Sam's club and had hubby trimed it to 3 & 2 lb sections.  The only thing I change is not to add any additional salt.  It is perfect.  Don't blend the sauce!  It is a sauce not a gravy, perfect as is.  I serve this with crock pot garlic smashed potatoes from another site, asparagras or grean beans and Beautiful Salad also from this site.  My whole family raves about this meal.

Served for a non-traditional Thanksgiving and was fabulous.  Added 2 sliced portobello mushroom caps to the shallots while roasting, and then pureed the shallot/mushroom/bacon mixture. Also made a rub from kosher salt/pepper/minced garlic/thyme and rosemary, for the roast, before searing it.

Fabulous and far easier to put on the table than you would think.  I prepared the win/port sauce the night before and roasted the shallots in the morning.  I added quartered mushrooms to the shallots just because mushrooms go so well with beef.  Upon the recommendation of others, I pureed half of the sauce in the blender and mixed it back in with the other half to give it some body and depth.  Do splurge on a good piece of tenderloin if you are going to make this.  A "cheap" supermarket one will just toughen and ruin all your hardwork.  Find a good butcher and get their help selecting a good quality one that will be worth your time and effort to make.

I've made this dish several times over and have become known for making this dish.  Instead of port, I use cabernet.  it was what I had on hand the first time and have been using it ever since.  I also roast the shallots a little longer, to get the sweet caramelization, which I find add a nice flavor.  I've also found that the reduction process takes a little longer than the recipe states.  Make sure to add any salt LAST, because the reduction will intensify and concentrate the salt in the dish.  
This is a wonderful recipe!

Delicious. I do agree with others that you should go ahead and double or triple the recipe. Very, very time consuming so only make this when you have a lot of free time. Mine turned out a tad salty because I used beef granules to make my broth. Next time, I would reduce it.

It is quite good and definitely a special occasion dish because of the expense.  The sauce is delicious and I always make a double batch because it tastes so good on everything...not just the meat!  I have even made it on it's own as a steak sauce without the shallots.....always a hit!

Silky smooth meat, wonderful flavor, beautiful presentation.  The sauce is a wonderful complement to the meat, enhancing it without overpowering it.  Be careful about adding salt to the sauce, however.  I didn't add salt and I did not use cooking wine (used the real thing).  If I had used cooking wine (which has salt in it), and had added salt before tasting the sauce, the sauce would have been far too salty.  I think there was sufficient salt in the canned broth I used, especially after having reduced it.  Anyway, everyone loved it, even my 15 month old daughter who otherwise won't eat meat!

I thought this was a fabulous dinner, although it was rather expensive. I found it a bit salty as well, I will omit the bacon next time. I also cooked the beef to 170 degrees. (we don't like rare) Which I thought it would possibly toughen the beef, to our surprise it was very tender and juicy. Side dishes were baked califlower in olive oil, excellent and rice. Overall this is definately a once a year type recipe, rather costly.

Can't say enough about this recipe.  My guinea pigs (Father in law,husband, 3 teens)thought they died and went to heaven. When you start with a great cut of beef your way ahead of the game. I made the sauce with 50%Port and 50% good Cabernet Sauvignon, thinking the port may be too sweet. I aso served this with some puff pastry (the ones w/ the tops in the frozen food section of your grocery).  I omitted the 3 tbs of butter into the sauce but added 1 tblspoon.  Reduced the sauce, and roasted the shallots in the morning.  Husband loved it with the watercress, and looks lovely on the plate. "Tenderloin" IS expensive.. but the same cost as "Chinese take out" (that couldn't be half as good). Worth the expense, the time and effort...Thank you for a very easy and special recipe, and makes the cook look like a Julia Child.

Outstanding recipe!  I love my filet just plain, but this sauce and recipe take nothing from the meat, only add to it.  It was part of the BEST meal I have ever made, and I highly recommend it.
I actually did the long parts of the sauce in the afternoon, then did the last minute 'making it gravy' at the end, and it worked fine. I served it with some roasted garlic/rosemary/wine potatoes, and
some pencil-thin asparagus, and the guests just raved. And I'm not a great cook, and this was awesome!

Restaurant Quality for sure. I didn't have port wine but used marsala wine and it still was really good. Also substituted mock tender steak for the beef tenderloin roast and after cooking down the wine/gravy mixture and searing the meat, I put it all in the crockpot for faster easier cooking. This was awesome.  This is a must have recipe that will really impress your family.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and again for Valentine's Day.  It is so delicious!   It takes a long time (took me about 2 hours busy in the kitchen to cook the full meal), but is sooooo good.  Definitely a perfect special-occassion meal.

Great Recipe! It was not as bad as I thought. I had a hard time finding Beef Tenderloin so I use Petite Beef Shoulder Tender instead. My date loved it! I just have a few suggestion. If you are cooking for two. Use 1 can of beef broth and a half of cup of wine. I made red potatoes and asparagus. My Date love the sauce so much he use the leftover suace for his potatoes and his asparagus. I will make this recipes again! Thanks you for sharing.

This was AWESOME! Nonstop rave reviews all night about this. I 4x the recipe because I made a 7.75lb roast so my cooking times were longer. I cooked it in the oven for 1 hr @ 375 then took it out and "tented " it with foil while I made the sauce then added it back to the oven in the sauce on my "keep warm" temp until everything else was done. It turned out perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe and Thanks to Abapplez from the Recipe Buzz for recommending it.

This is my first review. I registered just so that i could say how incredible this dish was. My mother inlaw and I set the smoke alarm off twice cooking this but it was well worth it.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was by far the the most tender flavorful cut of beef we had ever had. Everyone went on and on about how amazing it was.  My only word of caution would be to know what you are about to spend at the grocery store. I had to go to 3 stores before i found a kroger that had beef tenderloin in stock. I asked them to cut 3lbs and it came to about $70! After the I got over the initial shock, though i have to admit it was well worth it. Truly an amazing dinner, everyone loved it.

I made this with a less expensive cut of meat, and increased the recipe to accomodate a 3.5lb roast (still ended up with 6 servings).  I followed the recipe and ingredients almost exactly.  I blended the sauce to make it smooth as other reviewers suggested, and was pleased with it.  The flavor of the sauce was very good, and 5 slices of bacon created just the right amount of fat to brown the roast.  We used the sauce over noodles, and would have liked it thicker.  Had a lot of sauce left over.  Next time I'll either thicken or reduce the sauce, and maybe cook the meat in a slow cooker instead of the oven.  Also, the shallots took way longer than 30 minutes to roast - at least an hour.

Used 2  2 lb Tri-Tip roasts trimmed. Absolutely wonderful!  Used 450 degree heat to spead up shallot roasting time since they were not browning at lower heat. Used red dinner wine. Will make again for Christmas Dinner.  Double the sauce it's great the next day if there is any left.

Oh man...that shallot sauce!  Amazing!  Regarding the cost: we used an eye of round cut.  The 2lb roast (organic, grass fed) was just under $15, and though tenderloin would have of course been better, it made for a nice roast.  Shallots were about $4 for 3/4 lb, and we used a nice Pinot Noir because we had it already.  So, assuming you have basic pantry staples and a bottle of red laying around, you can make the roast for under $20 with a slightly lower cut of meat.  Cooked the roast for 25 minutes on the nose, which resulted in a medium rare roast clocking in at just under 130 degrees.   Didn't bother with the bacon step, which saved time...I don't think the end result was lacking at all for it.  Why on earth anyone would puree the sauce is beyond me.  The little shallot nuggets are the best part. (note: the shallots I found were enormous, so we cut them into approx. 1.5in pieces before roasting)  All in all, I think the cost and time concerns are somewhat overstated.  Make the reduction while you roast the shallots (which did take about 40 minutes to really caramelize), and the whole thing comes together in just over an hour.  Not necessarily a weeknight meal, but not unreasonable for the weekend, and the result is really a showstopper...ideal for company.  Served with green beans and Pioneer Woman's "crash hot potatoes".  A memorable, restaurant-quality meal!

This recipe was fantastic. As a more economical alternative, I substituted the Beef Tenderloin for 2.15 lb cut of chuck roast. I followed the recipe as written, except for the cooking time. I altered the cooking time to 325 as suggested by a separate roast recipe. I cooked the beef roughly one hour, until the thermometer read 160. The result was a nice warm, pink center...maybe just under medium. I served this with honey ginger carrots and mashed potatoes.  Fantastic recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is a great dish! I doubled this for a family get together, and every bit was gone! But it does take more time then the recipie calls for; I gave myself about 2 and half hours and it was done right on time. I do recomend marinating for about an hour in red wine before cooking. It gives it that extra touch, it will absolutly melt in your mouth! Well worth every penny!!

This was absolutely amazing.  The sauce was incredible, both my kids went to town on it and ate every bite and my boyfriend loved it.  I haven't cooked for him before since this is a semi new relationship but he said it was great and is now wondering if every meal I make will be this good.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  It will be one I will make again and again.

The beef tenderloin was such a delicious cut for this recipe!  My husband LOVED the sauce.  He's asked that I make this every year for Christmas.  I took others suggestions and paired this with jasmine rice and it was perfect together!

I made this for the first time this week and followed the recipe to the letter. All I can say is, "Wow." So much flavor, definitely worth the extra steps in making the sauce. I served it with roasted potatoes flavored with butter and fresh Rosemary and grilled red peppers. I can't wait to make it again.

Delicious.  I made this for my parent's 30th wedding anniversary and it was a hit!  I tripled the amount of meat and only doubled the sauce portion.  There was plenty of sauce to go around.  The only thing I did differently was subbed cabernet for the port because I forgot to buy it... (I added 2T brown sugar per cup of wine to make up for the sweetness of the port).  I will definitely make this one again.

For more tender meat I would cook it at a lower temperature.  After the meat has browned, then let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes.  After the meat has rested put it into a 250 degree oven and let the internal temp reach 135 - 140.  Then tent with foil and let it rest again for 20 minutes before serving.  This method takes longer but is worth the wait.

Potentially restaurant quality. I was initially disappointed the first time I made this.  The sauce really needs to be thin like au jus to enhance the meat properly.  Thickening or blending it overpowers a beautiful and tender cut of meat full of it's own flavor.  Leave the thickening for a cheaper cut of meat which needs the help.  After tenting your roast and allowing it to rest, slice and place on a large serving platter, spoon the sauce over and allow to sit for an additional 5 minutes before serving.  The meat will be infused with a wonderful flavor instead of being overpowered by such a rich thick sauce. You can substitue any red wine to mellow the sauce a little.  I serve with garlic and dill roasted red potatoes and steamed asparagus. Recipe is easy and well suited for beginner to advanced cooks.

Made this for Christmas dinner, it was supurb!  My dad is such a picky eater, and he was the first one to speak up on how much he liked the shallot sauce.  Everyone loved it.  The meat is expensive, but it is well worth it for a special occasion.  I printed the recipe for 6 people; I used a 5 lb. tenderloin, so I doubled all other ingredients and had plenty of sauce left over.  It is time consuming to make the sauce, so I am glad I had prepared the shallots and reduced the port/beef broth prior to my guests arriving.  I cooked it to about 145, and let it sit.  It was perfect for us, as it gave us some medium rare, and some medium.  My mom asked for the recipe, she plans to make the sauce and serve it with other cuts of meat.  Absolutely wonderful!  Will make this again.

I have to say wow.  It is not too often I stumble on a recipe this good.  I love it when I do.  As a cook and a critic.  I made this with cooking wine which I can see how it will be better with regular wine.  Almost too salty with the cooking wine.  I made this with roasted potatoes and carrots which was great with the sauce.  Cooked these separately since the cooking time is longer.  Also I wish I would have made rolls with this.  Would have been great to sop up the rest of the juice.  And the beef is more spendy but well worth it.  Definatly restruant quality.  THANKS!!!!!

I made this for my dad's birthday and it got really rave reviews.  Yes, the cut of meat is expensive, but really well worth it.  I wouldn't change the recipe itself at all, just maybe tweak a technique here or there.  I didn't think the sauce needed to be made ahead of time as others suggested; being well prepared takes care of this.  And definitely do *not* blend the sauce altogether...the nuggets of shallots and bacon are really what makes it.  Thanks very much for the recipe!--It was terrific!

Very tasty, and the cooking instructions seem just right.  One word of caution: I bought 2 pounds of organic grass fed tenderloin and paid 50 dollars!  The meat was amazing, but my wallet is wimpering.

The best beef recipe I have ever eaten!! I doubled the sauce which I highly recommend. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a red wine instead of port because that's what was available. The flavors were rich and exquisite. This will definitely impress dinner guests. It did take a bit of time to prepare but it wasn't too bad. I usually measure out everything in the beginning and clean up as I go. This recipe is truly amazing and worth all the effort.

This sauce is the best thing I have ever tasted!  Expensive and time consuiming-  but rather easy and worth every penny and minute!

I followed the suggestion and made the sauce the day before.  This really helps in cutting prep time the day you plan to serve the meal.   I almost followed the recipe exaclty.  I chopped up my shallots before roasting them.   

I also followed the suggestion to puree the sauce.  This did NOT turn out like I expected.  I pureed about 1/2 of it and then mixed it with the original.  It still taseted delicious... but it lost its beautiful apprearnce.   It ended up looking like baby mush to me.  I ended up making another 1/2 batch of the liquid to add into the "mush".  It made it look a little bit better.  

the only "bad" thing about his recipe is that now I am going to want all of my meat to taste this way!

Absolutely amazing!  My husband was raving for days about how wonderful this beef is, particularly the sauce.  Next I'll be making it for my in-laws -- yes, it's that good!  I didn't have any port on hand, so I used red wine with some brown sugar.  I also cut the shallots a bit smaller than the recipe called for, since I prefer smaller lumps in the sauce.  As others have mentioned, you could use a blender or food processor to remove the lumps entirely if you have picky eaters.

This was truly amazing.  The Prep time for me was longer than 15 minutes, perhaps because I was making the complete all at the same time and was multi- tasking.  However, hubby swooned, moaned and just raved.  I served with buttered red potatoes and asparagus wrapped in phyllo.  It was a truly wonderful dinner.

When dealing with an expense cut of meat & all the ingred. to go along with it, I was a bit nervous about how well it would turn out.  But, WOW....this was amazing.  I didn't change a thing.  Used a Tawny Port Wine.  I made it for my husband's birthday and all his said thru the whole thing was "this is the best meal I've ever had!".  I did put a meat thermometer in, but, my meat was ready at 25 min. as per the recipe --it was perfect.  It was a  tedious recipe, but, not difficult.  I did double the sauce as some of the other reviewers suggested, however, I think we would of been fine with a single portion--there was quite a bit of the delicious gravy left over.

Prepared this for my wife and she said it is one of the best tasting meals she has ever had.  Cooked the tenderloin roast about 45 minutes to 155 degrees internally because she likes her beef cuts medium.  I prepared this along with the Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes and the Balsamic Glazed Carrots found on this website.  What a wonderful meal.

I've never been compelled to review anything before but this recipe is REALLY good.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time (and dishes!) making it but the result is worth it!  Also as many have said you will spend some $$ buying the meat.

Oh my this is FANTASTIC!!! This is my first posting to this site.   The sauce is amazing.  I did as others suggested and put shallots and bacon and sauce into blender and wow it makes my mouth water thinking about it! I don't usually like medium rare anything but  this was great! This was so tender too!

I had to make a few subs., with what I had on hand. [We were getting alot of snow, I didn't want to go out in it.] Anyway, I didn't have shallots so I used a small onion. I didn't have Port wine, I used Marsala wine. The sauce was sooo good. Mine was a little thick side, but the more I ate it the better it tasted. I used a hand blender to try to get a smooth sauce. I just might leave it just the way it is next time [with the proper ingredients] and might throw some fresh mushrooms in it. I could see making the sauce even if your broiling some steaks, with he drippings left in the pan. Make most of the sauce ahead of time, then add the juices from your steak to it. Thank you for a lovely dish.

Made this for a small dinner party and it was really good.  I used 1 Tablespoon of fresh thyme instead of the dried.  Like others I blended the broth, shallots & bacon before adding to the pan.  However, this made the sauce thicker than I wanted.  I will continue to blend, but will decrease the amount of flour to keep the sauce a bit thinner.  Served with maple bacon brussels sprouts & mashed potatoes.  Compliments all around.
UPDATE:  I made this again only I didn't blend the sauce - much, much better.  Don't blend the sauce!  It tastes so much better with the pieces of shallot & bacon.  I just cut the shallots up a little and it was delicious.
Second Update:  I make this every year around the holidays. This year I decided to just use my cast iron skillet for the whole thing, works like a charm and saves dirtying up an extra pan. I cooked the bacon, seared the meat, cooked in the oven then made the sauce all in the cast iron.  Delish!

For the first try I made a poor mans version with a small roast and cheap port, just in case. The cut of beef for this does not matter, it's the beef stock / port sauce with shallots that makes this incredible. Of course a tenderloin would be the best but you could put the sauce over a McDonalds burger and it would taste great. Great recipe. I think any time I make any beef I might have the sauce on the side from now on!

Delicious! With money being tight, I made it with a relatively cheap choice round...and even managed to overcook it a bit. I also made it with just a cheap red wine. The recipe was very forgiving! For those who were saying this meal is pricey, you can make a cheaper version that is still VERY tasty. For the next special occasion I plan to make this using they pricey ingredients, but would have no problems making this on a more frequent basis.

How fantastic! I made the recipe as given but did leave out the bacon.  I seared the beef in olive oil.  I thought roasted veggies would be a wonderful addition.  I roasted them in the same pan I roasted the shallots in so there was a mild shallot flavor to them. The next time I think I would divide the tenderloin in half and roast half of it a little longer since it was very rare.  I did a 9 lb. cut and doubled the roasting time but it was still rare but most delicious.  The shallot sauce was incredible!  I can't wait until I make it again.  Everyone agreed it was fantastic.  We rotate Christmas Eve with my brother and sister-in-law.  My sister-in-law is already wondering what she can do to top this next year.  There's nothing left.  This is the best!!!

This was so good.  I couldn't decide to keep the sauce as is or to blend it as many suggested.  So, we did a taste off with half the sauce blended and half the sauce left in it's original form.  And the winner was definitely to leave it as is.  The chunks of shallots were amazing.  The blended version was a bit too thick.
Will definitely make again and again!

OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I don't eat or cook red meat, so the fact that my guests raved (for weeks) about this recipe-despite my lack of experience-really says a lot. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, which was a good idea becuase there was maybe a tablespoon left when dinner was over. Also, I omitted the bacon and drippings but added some sliced portobello mushrooms. Will DEFINITELY make again.

This is very good. It was my first time cooking a tenderloin and I was a bit afraid because I did not want to ruin such an expensive cut of meat. I  preheated the oven to 500 degrees, put the pan in the oven then lowered the temperature to 350 degrees. I took it out when the thermometer reached 150 degrees (about 1 hr.) since we like our meat medium and not medium rare and it turned out perfect. I roasted the shallots along with some fresh mushrooms ahead  of time and put it in the fridge. I also cooked the bacon ahead and kept the grease in the pan until it was time to brown the meat. I was surprised that it took about 20-30 minutes for the sauce to thicken. Also, I did not add any salt at all because with the bacon and the broth it was just enough. The 3 lb. roast was enough for 5 people with 2 cuts each. Do not be intimidated by all the reviews, this was not difficult at all to make.

This recipe was fabulous!!!  I also used a good red wine instead of the port and also doubled the bacon for more bacon/smokey flavor.  You can also substitute carmalized onions if you don't have shallots on hand.  This was a surefire hit with my family!!

WOW!  Kudos to Christine L. who so perfectly wrote out this recipe--it was so easy to follow with the steps so clearly laid out.  I followed this to a tee except rather than add the bacon crisps to the sauce (don't enjoy smokey flavors), I served the crisps on the side as an optional "topping" for my guests.  I also roasted quartered mushrooms with the shallots because I love mushrooms.  I also had trouble finding a small beef tenderloin so had to buy a $65 roast (5#) at Costco and cut it in half, froze the other half.  Thank you thank you so much for sharing - - just incredible.

I made this for company a couple of weeks ago, and it was a real hit!  As many people have noted, the sauce was a bit time-consuming, but the result was rich and flavorful.  I quartered the shallots instead of halving them, and I think this made the appearance much more appealing.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus, and guests said the meal was "killer"!

I had dinner for eight and everyone loved it. Your family & friends will find this roast so tender it could be cut with a spoon. The shallot sauce was the perfect topper.  This recipe does take sometime to prepare but well worth all your efforts. Enjoy we did!

I wish I could rate this higher.  It was amazing!  I was worried about the timing, so I did most of it ahead of time.  I used a blender to make a smooth sauce of the shallots and beef broth mixture, and refrigerated that overnight.  The next day, it was pretty easy to finish it up.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Delicious. To make this even MORE decadent, I substituted madeira (personal preference) for the port, used stock instead of broth, added 1/2 lb sautéed sliced mushrooms and about 1/2 c. cream to the sauce. Thickened with cornstarch mixed with a little cream. Not eggzackly lo-cal, but . . .

DELICIOUS! Have made this recipe every Christmas for past 6 years and Ive cooked for 16 25 people. You can cut down on the amount of shallots and to save time..definitely roast shallots day before. Cook bacon before your guests arrive.

Fabulous! Even better with crimini/baby bella mushrooms. Something about bacon, mushroom and shallot that is like nothing else. The fat from the bacon gives the sauce a nice sheen. Very elegant dish and works well with lamb too. Just add rosemary. Baby fingerling potatoes are a nice starch to have with this recipe.

This dish was excellent.  I actually made it with a venison tenderloin in lieu of beef and it was wonderful!  I used sherry wine in place of port wine too.  The sauce was very elegant.  I served it alongside baked potatoes and roasted asparagus.

I've made this twice and it was great both times.  I found that buying the tenderloin at Costco resulted in a much better dish.  We bought a tenderloin at Smart & Final and it wasn't quite as good.  I really feel that the quality of the meat made a big difference.

I loved this recipe. Made if for my husband's fathers day meal and he loved it as well. I didn't have shallots (i know) So I used sweet yellow onions that I sautéed then proceeded as directed. It really made the meal much faster since I didn't have to wait for the shallots. I also did not have port so I used a Lambrusco wine instead. I recommend using a digital thermometer probe inside the meat for best results. Cooking time was much more than the 25 min was closer to 50-60 min. total.

Third time making this...WOW is this recipe GOOD. Don't like wine in our food so I just obmitted it. Made the broth a day ahead of time also roasted the shallots at the same time. Took about 1/2 of the shallots and put them in the blender along with some of the broth, turned out excellent. If your looking for a fantastic beef recipe to impress someone try this one you will not be disappointed.

Delish... i didn't have the money to go for the tenderloin so i just got a beef roast instead, browned it on all sides and stuck it in the croc pot.. other than that i followed the recipe and what others suggested with blending the broth / wine mixture with the shallots and OMG soo yummy.. will for sure be making this again..

We had this for company and they loved it!! It was delicious, flavorful and the meat is very tender. The sauce is really good! It's best to use shallots, because they tend to have a much milder taste than onions and a meat thermometer..so you can gauge just how well done you want your meat.

I loved this.  But my boyfriend loved it more.  He is still talking about it.  I didn't have port wine so I subsituted it with red wine I had in the house.  It came out perfect.

Expensive and somewhat time-consuming, but very impressive.  Did not blend the sauce as others did, the chunky texture of roasted shallots adds character.  My roast was about 3.5 pounds and it took more like 45 minutes to  get it to medium rare.  The sauce can do double duty as a topping for mashed potatoes.

I decided to make this for Christmas Eve dinner; my first big holidy dinner with my parents over in our new house.  I followed the recipe with some minor changes in measurements, as I made two 2.5 lb tenderloin roasts.  I doubled the sauce and shallots, but kept the bacon the same.  I didn't  have a roaster that could fit on my stovetop, so I cooked the bacon in a pan, seared the tenderloin in the bacon fat on the stovetop, while heating my roasting pan in the oven.  Once the tenderloin roasts were browned, they went into the hot pan in the oven, along with some par-boiled baby potatoes and any remaining bacon fat.  The roasts remained in the oven until they reached 125 degrees, entire pan removed, and tented, while I finished the rest of  my sides.  I thinly sliced the meat after letting it rest, and one 2.5lb roast was plenty for a group of 5 adults.  My father, brother and husband are hard to please when it comes to beef, and they loved this.  They raved about the taste, texture and moistness.  I have been asked to make this again next Christmas.

This was the first recipe I made from Allrecipes.  I was pleasantly suprised.  There were a lot of steps involved but the end result is soooo worth it! I ended up boiling off to much of the wine and it reduced more than I wanted it too but it was still awesome. Definitely a meal you could serve for an upscale party or even for a family night in.  I have made this dish many more times and everyone is always sooo impressed!! Thanks Christine for posting such a wonderful recipe!

This is a great recipe. After reading reviews where some said to follow the sauce recipe exactly and other said to puree it all until smooth, I decided on pulsing the shallot and bacon bits until smaller but not totally liquified. Really delicious! I used white wine and brown sugar instead of port, (it's what I had on hand) and rolled the raw tenderloin in a mix of hacked thyme, rosemary, salt & pepper about five hours before cooking. Wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and refridgerated up until an hour before cooking, when I allowed it to rest until it reached room temperature. My oven took longer than the suggested cooking time, I ended up cooking the roast for a total of 35 minutes. Very, very tasty!

Overall, this is an excellent recipe.  Lots of skill building techniques which I appreciate.  The only issue for me was the saltiness of the gravy.  My family didn't notice but I'm not a "salty" kind of person.  I think next time I will get low sodium beef broth.

Oh my if I could give this a 10 i would have.  The meat was insanely lovely and the sauce was heavenly.  I didn't have port so I used sherry, and I made the sauce ahead of time.  You would have thought that just by taste alone that you had slaved in the kitchen for hours.  Making the sauce ahead of time made this a breeze.  The smell of the shallots roasting makes your mouth water. thx for this reipe, I will be making it again and again.

Served numerous times to glowing reviews.  Shallots were quartered or halved to keep sizes the same, drizzled with EV olive oil, salt and pepper and placed in the oven 10 minutes before the roast.  The roast and the shallots came out together.  Was served with red-skinned roasted garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise.  Paired with a Cabernet Sauvignon.

I made this and it turned out delicious.  I have not read through the almost 500 reviews, but suffice it to say that, in my experience, 375 degrees to "deeply brown" the shallots is a stretch.  More like "deeply steam."  If you want them brown, use 425-450 degrees and watch them carefully.

This recipe started a family tradition of beef tenderloin for Christmas.  It is wonderful.  The wine sauce is exquisite.  I have adapted the sauce based on my guests and the recipe is very adaptable.  My large extended family enjoys that we can make half the tenderloin rare and then leave the other half in the oven for those who enjoy well done beef.  Thanks for this amazing no-fail recipe!

Way late review - I made this for Christmas Eve dinner 2007! Well, better late than never. This was excellent. It was gobbled up, the meat was perfect! I doubled the sauce as others suggested and I'm glad I did (although I forgot to add the tomato paste). Next time I will try to remember to add the tomato paste, although it was great without it. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

This recipe was really wonderful.  Even my son who usually won't eat beef enjoyed it.  Instead of a whole tenderloin I cut one up into pieces or 'medallions' to take out the extra fat.  Turned out very tasty.

I prepared this for Christmas Eve, never having cooked a beef tenderloin previously. It was fabulous. I followed the directions pretty much as written except, like others, I made the sauce a bit earlier since Christmas Eve is a bit busy. The sauce was outstanding. I served herb roasted small potatoes with it and that was a nice accompaniment. I used the leftovers for a stew with the sauce as a base. Everyone loved the original and the leftovers. Thanks for posting the recipe.

This was amazing! I had never made a tenderloin before and I took a chance on Christmas eve.  I used a dry, aged standing rib roast that was like butter.  I took some of the other suggestions and I roasted the shallots and made the beef/port broth the day before to save on time and I made the bacon earlier in the day. This was incredible.  The gravy should be it's own food group!  I will make this again and again

I've been making this now for the past 4 or 5 years for Christmas dinner. My family won't accept anything else.  I definitely cook the meat longer, until the meat thermometer reaches about 160. Just double the time indicated, a little less. It'll come out perfect - just a little pink in the middle still but not dripping blood red. Pan sear the meat a little longer than what the recipe calls for. I serve this dish with roasted potatoes with fresh rosemary and pan fried green beens with roasted pinenuts. Fresh rolls top off the meal.  It's a keeper!

MY OH MY!  This was so good!  I followed the recipe exactly...except..I did not add the bacon bits to the sauce.  I did however, brown my tenderloin in bacon grease. It's a pretty easy meal that looks impressive and tastes fabulous!  Serve this one to company!

One of the best recipes on here! I LOVED the sauce. It was a little bit of work but the taste was to die for. All of my guests raved! 
I did what others suggested and put the broth/port mix, shallots and bacon in the blender until it was smooth. EXCELLENT! That sauce on top of the super tender meat was the perfect meal.  i served it with pan fried aspargus, mashed potatoes and mouth watering suffed mushrooms :) Just for the sauce, i would give this recipe a 6 out of 5 if i could.

This is the best recipe I have found on this site...period.  Takes some time to prepare, but well worth the effort.  The only change I made was substituting onions for shallots and adding Shiitake mushrooms for more body in the broth.  It's a crowd pleaser and a restuarant quality recipe.  Highest recommendation!

Regular at our house! I have made this for about two years using both beef tenderloin and beef filets (cooked to medium rare or about 145 degrees Farenheit).  Paired with Roasted Potatoes with Greens, it makes for an elegant dinner.  Enjoy it with your favorite red wine.  For dessert, I usually make Butterscotch Bread Pudding, with milk or a Riesling.  Guests loved it!

The best recipe I've made in years.  I increased the gravy by 50% and only used 9oz of shallots.  Otherwise I didn't deviate from the recipe.  Thank you for posting it.

This was amazing!  I bought a five pound beef tenderloin from Costco and made the dinner for 10 people.  The shallots took a little longer to brown b/c I had so many.  I ended up adding just a big of sugar to the onions to get them to brown a little faster.  I think the hint of sugar was great.  Maybe a teaspoon.  I've never cooked with shallots before and it's easy to get a bad one.  Just make sure they're really firm.  A mushy shallot is a bad one.  I didn't have port so I just used red wine and it was super. This is a wonderful recipe!  I'll make it again and again!

I used a pork tenderloin because I was scared to buy such an expensive cut of meat as a beef tenderloin for a recipe I'd never tried before....but the pork worked just fine.  This recipe is definitely one to pull out when you want to impress others!! It was delicious!!  I had bought 2 small pork tenderloins and cooked both of them together, it was probably 3 pounds of meat total.  I had to cook the pork for a total of about 45 minutes since you have to make sure the pork is done.  It was sooo tender & juicy.  The sauce is awesome too with a little modification.  Make sure to not salt the meat or the sauce, the broth takes care of the salt for everything.  Even if you got a broth that has 1/2 the sodium, it would still probably be enough salt.  Definitely recommend this one to everyone!!

The sauce for this dish is wonderful - I have had many accolades for it.  Since it's time consuming, I make a large batch and freeze leftovers.  I have substituted cabernet sauvignon for the port, and although it still makes a nice sauce, the port is definitely better.  Goes well with beef or pork tenderloin.

I made this last year for our family Christmas dinner.  It was very elegant and it was a big hit with the crowd.  However, I ended up adding some extra peeled pototes to the sauce to try to thicken it up a little.  (Discard the potatoes before serving.)  Also, another negative was that it was very labor intensive and it didn't taste all that different from other wine-sauce recipes I've tried.  All in all, I think you can get the similar results with other recipes in less time and hassle.

I have made many recipes from this web site and this is the first one that I have taken the time to review because it was such a smashing success. My husband and I made this for my sisters and their husbands (6 of us in all). All of our guests loved it and one of my sisters claimed that it was the best meal she had ever eaten!! You need to set aside some time and $$ to pull this off, but believe me it will be worth the effort to hear compliments like that!

I have made this on several occasions and recently was paid $50 a plate for a charity event. (Dinner was auctioned off) For a less expensive alternate use a pork tenderloin but be careful not to overcook. Use a meat thermometer for either pork or beef. If you don't like to see the shallots in the sauce place the sauce in a blender to smooth. This is an excellent holiday dish. Serve with twice baked potatoes and steamed carrots carmalized with maple syrup. UUMMMMMM!

Made this recipe the other night and the sauce was excellent. You could definitely use a less expensive cut of beef instead of the tenderloin. I read the reviews of the other cooks and used low sodium beef broth which worked great. The only 2 things I would recommend based upon my experience is to make the sauce ahead of time as it is time consuming and to "blend" it in a blender/food processor as the shallot pieces were quite big. Overall, delicious!

I cheaped out on this recipe with a less expensive cut of meat to test it out before spending the money on the more expensive tenderloin but even still this sauce made it absolutely delicious. My boyfriend doesn't like shallots so I gave him the sauce without them and he loved it too.

The sauce was wonderful. We had it over grilled New York Strips for Christmas dinner. I did as someone else suggested and chopped the shallots. I roasted them and refrigerated the day before.I also made and reduced the broth mixuture the day before. The broth/wine mixture actually tasted better the next day. I put it all toegther while the steaks were on, on Christmas day. Everyone really loved the sauce. Will definitly be making again.

I thought this took alot of work because of the several steps required. I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone enjoyed it but I had to spend too much time in the kitchen. Shallots were hard to find on Christmas Eve! I should have bought them sooner.

I made this for Christmas Dinner, I had 18 adults & 12 children - they all LOVED it!  It was so easy to make, I was a little nervous about making something new for a big crowd but everything was wonderful. They all raved about it & are still calling me today to tell me how much they enjoyed it.  I will definitely make this one again!

This is a great recipe that is fairly easy to prepare.  I prepared it for dinner for my German friends, and they raved over it!  You can substitute white boiler (mini) onions for the shallots if you like, and not alter the flavor that much.  I would highly recommend this recipe for an impressive dinner, and it reheats really well, too!

I don't know why I haven't reviewed this before. It is outstanding. I too, made the gravy a day ahead and blended it. I had to buy a five lb filet because that was all I could find. I cut it into portions to save for another day. The gravy is five stars and would be great on any cut of beef.

Amazing!  Made it for Christmas and have been waiting for another holiday to make it.  We ate the leftovers a few days later (I doubled the gravy) chopped up tenderloin with the gravy over egg noodles.  Sooo good!!!

Absolutely fantastic, followed the recipe to a tee.  First dinner cooked for BF and I know he was impressed.  Excellent flavor! Cannot wait to make again, could easily see this becoming Christmas dinner. 

Con: Beef tenderloin is super expensive, but worth it!

This is by far, not only the best meal I have ever made, but the best meal I've ever eaten. Haven't even had it this good in a restaurant. A little pricey but worth it.

I made this for Christmas Eve Dinner and it was wonderfull!  I did put the shallots and bacon in a blender to make a smooth sauce, but I think it would have been just as good if I had left it as is. This will be a new Christmas tradition in our family!

At first glance, I thought this was way out of my ability.  After reading the reviews, I thought I will take my time and give it a go.  Thrilled that I did!  I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and my guests can't stop talking about it!  Per the other reviews, I blended my shallots, bacon and broth/wine to make a thicker sauce.  It was incredible...would highly recommend...will definitely make again!  This is a dish to impress!  Thank you for making me look good to my guests Christine L...amazing recipe and pretty easy too!

This dish is great. Actually had a 4-5 lb tenderloin ... prime cut.  Actually took 1/4 of the shallots and blended them in the gravy/sauce with an immersion blender. Magnificent!!!  Ate leftovers this evening and reheated in a pan with the sauce ... meat was tender and tasted great!

I'd give this recipe 10 stars. I made this for Christmas dinner with a 6 lb filet so I tripled the sauce/shallots/bacon. Everyone absolutely loved it. The sauce is amazing. The only change I made was to use corn starch instead of flour. I will definately be making this again next year!!

I've made this (well, my mom and I have both made this) for 2 Christmases in a row now and we look forward to it every winter.  The shallot sauce is amazing, and we tend to sneak it onto everything else on the plate.  I have made the sauce with OUT the bacon before (Christmas day last year, forgot the bacon, plowed forward anyway), and I almost prefer that.  The sauce has a cleaner flavor carried by the shallots and port.

This recipe was a HIT! Everyone loved it.  I read the earlier reviews but elected not to blend the shallot sauce...I thought it was perfect and enjoyed the pieces of roasted shallot. The recipe wasn't difficult...just a bit time consuming but definitely worth it!

AMAAAAAAZING! I made this with 2 little kids running around and it was so easy! Doubled the recipe as I had a 4 lb cut, went easy on the butter in the sauce though. I did pour the sauce into the sliced meat and let it stand as I was getting my sides ready in the oven.

This recipe is fantastic.  I agree that the sauce is what makes it.  I had leftover sauce and used it at the end for a pot roast that I made in the slow cooker.  Just wonderful.

I tripled the amount of meat and only doubled the sauce. We love sauce and i was concerned, but we had plenty. I used cheap Ruby Port and it worked out just fine. I did add 2 tablespoons of flour to the second application of butter to make the sauce a little thicker. I don't think this is a big deal. I used sirloin roast and let it cook for 2 1/2 hours. The meat was well done and great. I also used green onions instead of shallots (I must admit that i don't even know what a shallot is!). Our market didn't have any anyway. This was terrific!

Excellent! I just added 1 T butter the pan drippings in roaster then added broth mixture to save a step and it thickened just right. My family couldn't stop raving over this one.

This was YUMMY!!!! I made it for my mom and I when the boys were out with their dad.  We LOVED it and my mom kept coming back for 'nibbling' later in the evening.  My store's shallots were awful looking so I used 'pearl red onions' and they were wonderful.

I served this Christmas dinner and it was amazing!  Followed the recipe to the letter.  Really wouldn't change a thing.  I do like the idea of roasting the shallots and reducing the port/stock beforehand.  Nice time saver.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This made our Christmas dinner!  It was the best beef I have ever cooked.  The gravy was spectacular!  Everyone loved it and they are still talking about it!  I pulsed the shallots and the bacon like others have recommended and I am glad that I did.  We prefer our beef medium so we cooked it to about 145 degrees.  It was perfect!  I will absolutely make this again!

This was unbelievably good!  I used the "choice" tenderloin instead of prime.  The butcher told me both are so tender that paying the extra money for the prime wasn't really worth it.  Anyway, the sauce was great.  Perhaps a little heavy on the shallots since the sauce thickened up so much.  I ended up adding a little water to the sauce to make it more liquidy.  It was so tasty though!  I probably would not use bacon next time.  It didn't blend as well with the sauce flavors as I thought it would.  Like others said, this sauce can be used for any beef.  I will try it with roast beef next (since tenderloin is so $$$).  I made this with Gourmet Mushroom Risotto and Buttery Carrots for sides.  YUMMY Christmas dinner!

I loved this!  I left the watercress out and ended up using vegetable broth instead of beef broth but the gravy is fabulous.  Be very careful cooking the tenderloin - since the recipe said 25 mins for medium rare I thought 30 minutes for medium would be fine...but it came out medium well, almost well done.  For such an expensive cut of meat overcooking makes me cry!  But, it was still delicious.  I plan on using the leftover gravy on some bok choy today.  I may use this recipe with a "regular" steak next time to save money, or on a pork tenderloin.

This was a wonderful Christmas dinner! My husband raved and said it was restauraunt quality. Like others recommended, I pulsed the shallots, bacon and some roasted garlic in the blender before adding to the sauce. I will make again and use the sauce for othe meats as well. This one's a winner!

I made this like the recipe called but instead of putting in the oven I but in the slow cooker for 4 hours on low. I think 3 would of been enough. It was tender and everyone raved about it!

This was the most fab recipe ... my meat was unbelievably tender ... followed recipe exactly ... if and when I make this again, I will make a change ... firstly ... none if my guests ate the shallots ... so I might change that a bit ... perhaps saute and add to sauce rather than roasting individual large shallots  ... secondly, the port make the sauce a bit on the sweet side ... I would use a different wine the next time ... otherwise, I must say, this was d e v i n e l y delicious!!  I served with fingerling potatoes and crispy green beans ... preceded by a pear, feta, honey roasted almond green salad ... chocolate cake for dessert ... what a fab meal ... of course, lots of wine and martinis and hor'derves pre dinner ...

Excellent dinner party dish. The only two things I changed was to use a cabernet instead of port and I had beef tenderloin tails -- it was very nice! One guest couldn't stop himself! I served with a cold green bean Turkish-inspired dish, roasted red potatoes and a simple cucumber and tomato salad with oil and red wine vinegar. It is a fairly easy recipe to follow and turned out beautifully. Would highly recommend, even for beginners.

I've made this several times and ALWAYS get rave reviews.  The gravy is scrumptious!  I'm not a port fan as I find it sweet so I use a deep cabernet sauvignon and it's simply delicious!!  You may want to double up on the gravy ingredients...I've never run out of meat before it!

Fantastic way to prepare tenderloin.  Have made this twice now and never changed anything except I used different kinds of red wine each time, and served the remaining wine with the meal.

This is one recipe that I will keep forever! I did everything just as the recipe called for and my family and I was not disappointed in the least. The gravy that this recipe makes is *THE* best gravy I have ever made. I was extremely surprised and very happy when everything came out. The beef was in the oven for the exact 25 minutes and it came out a perfect medium-well. Lovelovelove this recipe.

The roasted shallot sause is delicious.  I make the sauce whenever I make steaks now.  The only change I made was to add mushrooms.  Excellent recipe!

Yay for shallots!  I made this in the crockpot instead of the oven. Did almost everything the same, no bacon though, and didn't use a tenderloin roast, although I can't remember what cut I did use. Nothing expensive.  I made the sauce, browned the meat, then put everything in the crockpot. When it was done I spooned out the sauce and made a gravy. Loved it.

EXCLLENT! My guests were still raving as they left!  The sauce is outstanding!  I cooked a 4 pound tenderloin and that fed 6 people (3 men, 3 women) exactly (people went back for a slice or 2 extra for seconds) with zero leftovers.  I used a cab sav instead of port and added a teaspoon of white sugar to compensate.  I doubled the sauce (b/c my meat was 4 lbs.) but it was totally unnecessary!  I probably have at least 2.5-3 cups left (will freeze)! Thank you for such an amazing recipe! I will be making this again and again as long as my boyfriend says we can afford it!  In case anyone is curious, i served roasted whole baby potatoes and green beans with sliced grape tomatoes tossed in olive oil and salt and pepper as side dishes.  WOW!  SO SO SO GOOD!

This deserves the ratings it gets!  I used a Costco beef tenderloin, and it was absolutely incredible!  It is worth all the praise it gets.  I followed the recipe  exactly except for the cooking time because mine was bigger than what the recipe called for and I added a touch more flour to the reduction sauce.  How delicious!!  This warrants repeats galore!

I made this for Christmas dinner and while the sauce was somewhat time consuming, it was well worth it! It got rave reviews from the family and I put it on everything on my plate! I wish I could make that sauce and bottle it for everyday use! One note is to undercook the meat slightly as you need the juices from the pan to make the sauce and it continues to cook a bit while it sits.

This was excellent! The sauce was so good my daughter said "Just pass the gravy boat and a straw my way!"  I served it with mashed potatoes and sides for Chritmas.  Did not use all the shallots,only half...didn't want to over "onionate it". Will use sauce with others meats, as well.

This recipe was fabulous; everyone loved it on Christmas day. I used red wine and brown sugar instead of port wine, and I also added sauteed mushrooms to it. Served with Bella's Rosemary Red Potatoes, Asparagus Parmesan and a salad. Thank you so much, Christine L. as I'll absolutely be making this recipe again!

Made this for 15 for Christmas. As promised it was AWESOME. I used a 6lb tenderloin from Costco and was extremely happy.  It is involved, so plan ahead and do as many of the steps beforehand - it makes it so much easier time wise.  We also used the sauce on the mashed potatoes - YUM, people could not get enough.

This was very delicious. I used Jonesy Rare Aged Port Wine, which was recommeded by the gentleman at the liquor store. He said it's great for cooking/marinading with steak. He told me not to buy a cheap wine for that & am I glad I listened to him. My brother told me this was the best meal I've made for him EVER. Wow - a compliment from my brother, that's amazing right there. It did remind me a little like tenderloin tips over rice (minus the rice). For those that don't like the wine flavor, it does have the wine taste to it. I don't care for wine flavor & loved this. It melted in my mouth & I made baby reds to accompany it & use the gravy on the potatoes. It's a keeper for me.

Fantastic! I also followed this recipe exact. I just used a different cut of meat. I used eye round roast and it was lovely. It is a thicker cut of meat so it was in for about an hour for med temp. Slice it very thin because it will not be as tender, but very good. As some other people said, I literally had people licking their plates (with slices of rustic bread of course.) Please make this for guest because they will think you are a rock star! Thank you for this lovely recipe.

I USE THE ORIGINAL RECIPE THEN MAKE CHANGES if it is that good - this makes FAR too little sauce, although very tasty, and half my roast stuck to the glass pan I used. With several CHANGES, I may make something similar to this again - expensive to make. Not even close to "Bourgignon", sorry.

I have made this two time both with rave reviews from family and friends! It is labor intensive but very much worth it! The first time I made it for a get together and used the filet cut. It was wonderful. The second time I had purchased a tri-tip roast and decided to try it with that cut of meat. It was just as good! I did puree the shallots and bacon with a bit of the broth prior to mixing it with the flour paste. My children even ate the sauce and loved it! I will make this again!

I made this recipe exactly as posted and it was absolutely delicious.  It used too many pots and pans.  I've revised it to use less pans - I use one sauce pan for the reduction, one roasting pan for both the shallots and the beef and one saute pan to saute the bacon, brown the beef and make the gravy. It seems to "flow" better and tasted the same as the posted version.  Whenever my supermarket has beef tenderloin on sale, I have them cut steaks from the wide end and save the other end for this recipe. If I plan on company, I just get fewer steaks and a larger roast.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good, but did take a while to prepare and cook. I would not make this once a week, but maybe every so often. The sauce was very good, but I wasn't amazed by it. I would make it again.

This is a great recipe!  My family and friends loved it!  The only change I made was I added some garlic cloves to the shallots while roasting and I did as other reviewers suggested pureed the shallot mixture.  Yummy!

This made for a very wonderful family reunion dinner. I was on the fence about the sauce, but others said it was great. The sauce is a lot or work, but I did follow others suggestions and made a few things in advance. The meat preparation was outstanding. It was perfect.

Very good. Left out the last bit of butter in the sauce to save a couple of calories and it was plenty rich without it. The sauce has a sweet edge to it, which I wasn't quite expecting. If I made again, may try pureeing the gravy as the big hunks of shallots were not so appealing to look at...

Delicious!  Follow the recipe as directed.  No more sauce is needed.  I also prepared the Almond Wild Rice, and Tasy Green Beans from this website.  A perfect combo.  Thank you!

Beef tenderloin is really expensive.  If you choose to use a cheaper piece of meat, make sure you cook it as long as possible at a lower temp.  With the left overs (meat only) we mixed in bbq sauce, cayenne pepper, a little mayo, and some chopped cabbage.  Completely different dish, but so yummy.

One of the best! My husband and I made this for Christmas dinner. We paired it with green beans and potatoes. One of the best Christmas meals I can remember! And the leftovers were even better. This is one we'll be making over and over.

I made the recipe as states pretty much from beginning to end. I roasted the shallots and the same time I mixed the broth, port and paste and heated that until it reduced by about half, I then dumped the roasted shallots and the sauce into a tupperware until the next day, and when the tenderloin was done and resting, I added the sauce to the pan and deglazed it and heated it up again at that time. It worked out deliciously when served with the "Slow Cooker The sauce is unique and flavorful. I'm happy I went out on a limb and spend the extra $$ for this divine cut of meat. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This Roasted Shallot Sauce is one of the best I have ever tasted!  We had 21 for dinner on Christmas Eve, and every single one raved over this meal.  I did not change a thing except to double the sauce recipe so we would not run out.  I served the beef tnederloin with potatoes mashed with cream cheese, sour cream and white cheddar and vegetables.  The sauce was wonderful both over the meat and the potatoes.  I have finally found my yearly Christmas Eve dinner menu.

Just made this for a large Christmas dinner of 20 people and every person loved it!  I don't think I've ever received so many compliments for a meal!  Combined it with large salad first, then twice-baked potatoes and Asparagus with Sliced Almonds and Parmesan Cheese (from this website) and crunchy bread. While the sauce was somewhat time-consuming to prepare, it was truly the finishing touch!  Also served a side of horseradish for a nice flair.  Will definitely make it again...and again.

I made this recipe this past weekend and what a hit it was! I think I should have reduced the port wine/beef stock a little more. A woman in the wine area of the store couldnt believe I was purchasing Port wine as she said it was "yuck". I bought it anyways and was okay. I had so many compliments on the sauce it was unbelievable. I added lots of mushrooms I had cooked the night before. I personally did not even get to taste the sauce as it was all gone before I got to it! 9lbs of beef tenderloin and a Costco ham, and mashed potatoes I made with cream cheese/chives, sour cream and roasted garlic all gone. My boyfriend was ticked there was no tenderloin or sauce left! lol  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent flavor and easy to make.  I did make some changes to suit my personal tastes and dinner situation.  I chose to use dry Marsala instead of port to cut down on some of the sweetness.  I also cut my tenderloin into individual filets ahead of time.  After cooking the bacon I drained the oil and made the sauce.  I grilled the filets on the BBQ.  I also did not add salt to anything because the bacon was salty enough and the other ingredients added their own flavor.

I did not use this recipe for the tenderloin, but for the roasted shallot sauce. I didn't have bacon.  I used other reviewers' advice to make the port/broth first, and blend, then I added the pan drippings to the saucepan and brought to a boil.

One thing to be mindful of; I thought my sauce seemed too thin, so kept boiling it off.  When it sat for a bit on the meat and cooled, it thickened up; almost too thick.  So a thinner sauce will be fine.  Think of it as au jus!  It will thicken as it cools.  

I also cut down on the butter by about half, so also flour accordingly.

I made a 3 lb tenderloin for a small dinner party and everyone raved about the flavor.  The sauce was very good and the recipe could easily be used for a different cut of meat such as a pot roast for a more casual, inexpensive version.  I served this recipe with roasted red potatoes and baby squash, carrots, and zuchinni seasoned with garlic, herb butter, sea salt & cracked pepper.  Simple recipe & is on our Christmas menu for something different!  

I did not have bacon on hand, but as my grandmother taught me, I always keep bacon grease in the fridge to add flavor.  So I used it in the pan to sear the tenderloin.  The bacon was not missed from the sauce.

I've been using recipes on this site for a few years now. Not once have I ever written a review, until now. OMG .. this was FANTASTIC!  Meat melted in your mouth.  Better yet was the gravy!  That should have it's own ratings! Made this for the family but for sure next time I'll invite company to reep all the praises!

Excellent selection for dinner guests! This recipe was delicious and a success. Made with some garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Followed advice of many and prepared sauce by pureeing shallots, bacon and broth in blender.

I was thinking about making this for 5 people for a dinner party.  I decided to do a test run for my husband and I first though to make sure it was good and it was!  We really enjoyed it.  It is a lot of work though.  I will make again and hopefully it will turn out just as well when I increase the ingredients.

I made this over the weekend for my boyfriend and I and it was absolutely amazing!  The only thing I did not do was add the watercress as a garnish at the end.  The flavors of the sauce were just perfect.  My boyfriend keeps asking when I'm planning to make it again.  This is now a new favorite for us.  Can't wait to make it again!  Thanks!

I wish I could give it 10 stars.  This was one of the best meals I've ever made and I'm 51 years old and a great cook!  I followed the recipe exactly exept as others I roasted mushrooms with the shallots and roasted them about 45 minutes instead of 30.  Otherwise, followed exactly.  My company could not get over the tenderness of the meat and the sauce was something I never thought I could make at home.  It was actually very easy for what it was.  I kept thinking as I was eating it that the sauce would be good over so many other things.  I actually dolloped some on the baked potato I served with the meal and it was to die for!  I've thawed some ground beef for dinner tonight and will use some of the left over sauce on the patties I make.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe, worth every penny and more!!** I'm now 60 years old and making this for New Years Eve dinner.  It's still worth every penny!

I have to say that this is excellent! I made it for my boyfriend's Birthday dinner and everyone loved it! So tastey, you really can't go wrong with this recipe! We had left overs and as I'm not a big red meat eater; I made two chicken breasts the same way as the meat...salt, pepper and thyme (fresh) then sauteed them in melted butter and garlic. Once browned, I placed them in the oven to cook...once done, I drizzled them in the yummy gravy!! It was very good!! My boyfriend absolutely loved it! Thank you so much for the recipe! It's one we will definately keep! Cheers!

I tripled this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous. I left the watercress out and strained the shallots and bacon out of the gravy. I also only used half of what was called for the port wine and substituted more beef stock for the rest. My family doesn't like the strong alcohol flavor in some sauces. The entire dinner party of 12 loved this recipe. A+

Followed the exact recipe. The instructions are too laborious. Too many pans for too few results. Tenderloin was a bit bland. Sauce/gravy w/ shallots can be made in far fewer steps. An ok recipe but a bit of a disappointment for over $125.00 of tenderloin!!!

This recipe saved me! I just got married in September and invited my parents, aunt who was visiting from Korea, and sister over for dinner for the first time. Because the tenderloin turned out so fabulous, my whole family is calling me a chef now! My reputation with all of my family members has changed, thanks to this recipe! Many thanks! : )

This was incredible. The only change I made was adding chopped up portobellos to the shallots while cooking. I can't wait to cook this for company.

This was very good and easy.  I followed the suggestion of several reviewers and blended the sauce except I only blended about half of it.  This gave it a nice texture and flavor and you could still enjoy the big chunks of bacon and shallot.  Also, I made it with a whole tenderloin (9 pounds) so I cut and tied it into two equal sized roasts so it would cook evenly.  It took much longer than the suggested cooking time.

My husband said it was the best dish I have ever made.  Thank you so much for the recipe.  I doubled the sauce amount because the sauce is the best part.  I like my meat medium rare, so I only leave it in the oven for about 15-18 minutes, and then let it sit in the aluminum foil tent for 20 minutes.

This is a wonderful recipe and the outcome will earn you great reviews.  As mentioned by other postings, making the sauce in advance will help you keep things moving smoothly especially if you are serving this for guests.  The sauce is great on any cut of beef but if you can afford the better quality cuts I recommend them.  This is one I will use over and over and highly recommend.

We made this for Christmas and it became an instant favorite!  Our family was shocked that we made this.  They told us they expect it every Christmas from now on.  We served with Garlic Roasted Mashed, Asparagus and Spinach Salad and it was elegant.

This was absolutely terrific, although I needed to roast the three pound tenderloin for almost twice as long as stated.  Well worth the effort of this meal.....my guests LOVED it for Christmas Eve.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was incredible. I was very nervous about cooking such an expensive piece of meat. It turned out great the sauce was excellent. I had a 9lb tenderloin so I doubled the sauce, was more than enough. Will definetly make again.

I made this last night for my husband, children, and inlaws.  Each previous review was on target, and I only made a few small changes.  I roasted the shallots and made the sauce in the morning.  I mixed the flour with beef broth, then thickened the sauce with it and added the butter directly to the sauce at the end.  I used more flour than called for in the recipe because I wanted the sauce to be a bit more substantial.  Fantastic!

Great Recipe, I have made this 4 or 5 times and I give it a 5 star each time.  I have reduced the salt to about half, and perfer it with less.

Amazing. Absolutely great! The sauce is what makes the dish and it was fabulous. I made it for dinner for a guy I've just started seeing and he couldn't stop raving about it.

This meal was remarkably simple, and very delicious. My husband, who is not a beef fan raved. He wants to serve it again to his parents. I always use precooked bacon, so I just added a little oil to the pan first. Then I browned the meat, and roasted the shallots with the meat. I also roasted baby carrots and red potatoes with the meat to save on oven use. Just these items and a salad and bread is all you need for a great meal. Don't be suprised.....this cut of meat is very expensive....but worth it!

This was yummy! The sauce was delicious!!! However it was very time consuming. Not sure how often I will make this due to the time factor.

Wonderful! My company of great cooks and beef lovers were wowed by this recipe. I used  two 2-pound,centre-cut tenderloins, and cooked them at 425 for 40 minutes in a convection oven to an internal temp of 125, then covered them with heavy tin-foil and a cloth for 15 minutes to get a perfect roast- medium rare for the most part with the ends closer to medium for my husband who likes his beef with very little pink

Ive made this 2 times, its wonderful.  I have to say the shallot peeling is a little tedious.  I tried once pureeing the sauce like someone recommended (this produced a good but scary very lumpy looking gracy) and the other time I made it as recipe recommends.  I'd skip the pureeing- I think people preferred recognizing the shallots and mushrooms in the gravy over trying to decipher by lumpy taste.  Maybe my blender isnt powerful enough.  In any event, this is not that hard of a recipe, it tastes faboulous and people think you are a gourmet cook.    Whats not to like?

This was the most amazing sauce I have ever prepared. I did the port/beef stock reduction, the roasted shallots and the chopped bacon at home and took everything to a friends house, along with a great tenderloin (very expensive at Whole Foods but worth every penny).

I did the recipe for 6 but there were only 3 of us. Enough left over for a repeat tomnorrow night.

Excellent but as others said  alot of  work!  I'm sure with all we did for our company they were impressed but I don't think I would do it again.  I like dishes I can ignore so I can talk to my guests.  I was constantly worried about over cooking the meat.  By the way, he tells you to take it out at 125.  Do that if you want it medium.  It cooks a lot after taking it out.  And the peeling of the shallots took me 35 minutes alone.
Next time for guest, it'll be the garlic prime rib on this website.

I prepared this feature for my fiance for Valentine's day and Oh my....it was awesome.  We were both taken aback at the taste of this entree.  The shallots in the port, beef, and tomato sauce atop of the beef tenderloin was absolutely superb.  My recommendation is to try this feature, you will not be disappointed.  Also, be sure to get a nice cut of tenderloin, it makes all the difference.

this was an awesome dinner.  I used the cabernet as suggested by another reviewer and also tied the meat together. I prepared the sauce ahead of time as again, suggested by another reviewer..and still tasted great and worth the early prepping.  it was wonderful.  my whole dinner party raved about it!  I will definitely be preparing this dish again.  excellent for holiday parties and entertaining.

The beef tenderloin is, of course, a terrific cut of meat and is delicious regardless of the  type of sauce used.  So, the main reason for making this particular recipe is for the sauce.  I thought the sauce was okay, but my husband really liked it.  I thought the results were very average, especially given the time and labor involved.  I followed the recipe exactly, and found that when reducing the wine and beef broth in step 2, it reduced much more quickly than the recipe states.  I accidentally reduced it to about one-quarter of the liquid after only 20 minutes.  So, watch that carefully.  Overall a good recipe, but there must be a way to get similar results with less time and effort!

This was worth the time it takes to make this, especially for company as it is a very pretty presentation. I made a few minor adjustments: I used a good cabernet instead of Port, I used canadian bacon in Pam instead of bacon and I poured the sauce over several filet mignon's instead of a roast. The sauce is really what makes this so special. Thanks!

What a GREAT Christmas dinner! Rave reviews all around! I cooked 10 pounds of beef tenderloin using this wonderful recipe! I used 1 and a half times the recipes (TONS of gravy!) and cooked the 2 5-lb. tenderloins for 1 hour at 350 degrees. One was a tad thicker so it ended up med-rare (125-130 degrees) and one was thinner and ended up medium to medium-well (140-145 degrees). Everyone was thrilled at the different degree of "doneness". 
As I said, I only added another half amount to the recipe for 10 pounds. This gave me more bacon grease to brown the beef. I cooked the bacon in a fry pan and after removing the bacon, hubby transfered the grease to a cookie sheet. He then put the cookie sheet over 2 burners to brown "the beasts" which had been seasoned with the thyme leaves, salt and pepper (rubbed on well). I cooked at 350 degrees.
My sister-in-law and I found that the gravy didn't thicken well so she added water and flour before I added the remaining butter, shallots and bacon. 
Great recipe; recommend it highly; although it's for a 2 pound tenderloin it can easily be altered for heavier amounts. TRY IT!

WOW!! What can I say.  I made this for my family for the first time last week and they were blown away.  The sauce is so easy to make, it has become a family favorite.

I used lean, thick cuts of Ribeye instead, and they came out great. If you can't get any scallots do what I did, substitue a small, medium chopped Maui onion instead.  Results were outstanding.  

The only bad thing about this recipe, is now I have to keep making it every time that my family asks for it.

This recipe is fantastic.  I have made it three times and had rave reviews each time.  The third time I prepared the sauce ahead of time and froze it.  With minimum fuss, I wanted to treat my parents who live 600 miles away.  I thawed the sauce on site and served with the tenderloin purchased there.  It was still wonderful!  Thanks so much for this very special treat.  I recently had beef tenderloin in a restaurant that wasn't nearly as good.

This was a good recipe.  Next time, I will just use onions rather than shallots to save money.  Also, I had to cook my roast much longer because I have family members who do not eat beef that is not well done.

I also made this recipe to impress my man for valentine's day and it was delicious!!! I used the low sodium beef broth and cut up the shallots more than what the recipe called for.  next time i will add roasted mushrooms instead of the bacon.  yes, the meat was expensive but it was well worth it!  also, i took all the shallots that were left at the grocery...had no idea it called for that much.  the sauce was more than enough for the meat....good for the leftovers we had.  i served this with "ultimate twiced baked potatoes (on this site)and a great spinach salad.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and my family is STILL raving about it almost a month later. I also pureed the sauce as suggested in earlier reviews. It was, in a word, amazing. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my dinner guests. The bacon made the sauce seem a little salty so next time I will not add any salt to the shallots for roasting.

The shallots took over an hour, and they were still not brown.  I needed 3 kg of loin roast to feed 12 people, and they're not big eaters.  Definitely agree with reviewer that it's about 25 min/lb rather than 25 minutes total cooking time for the roast.  Had to find out what all the hype was about.  Not bad, but not as fantastic as raved about.

My husband said this was the best meal I've ever made him.  I thought it was good too - but somewhat bland.  Definitely a good meal for company because you can do a lot of the prep work in advance.  I didn't have port, so I used brandy.

This was excellent even for someone who doesn't cook.  Cooked it last night for relatives from out of town and what a success!  I added two tablespoon of brown sugar to the red wine since I did not have any of the wine the recipe called for..also used a blender on the shallots.  Note...the 25 mins of cooking should be per pound I believe and not overall cooking time.  We just enjoyed left overs this evening and it was yummy...the sauce really makes the meal.

This was fabulous.  My husband and company just loved it.  This was the most tender roast I have ever made...most expensive also.  The 5lb. tenderloin roast cost me a whopping $50, well worth the expense for company.  I didn't have Port either, so I took the advice of others and added a pinch of brown sugar.

This is outstanding!!!!!!!!!  I made this for my BIRTHDAY DINNER, and everyone LOVED it.  I followed another reviewers' substitution, as I did not have any port, and  used red wine w/ a little brown sugar.  I also used finely chopped sundried tomatoes in place of the tomato paste --- GREAT SAUCE, I froze what was left....too good NOT to!!!  Thanks, Christine, for a really fine recipe.

I prepared this for a special Valentine's Day dinner for my fiance, my daughters, and one of my daughter's boyfriends. It was a huge hit. There were no leftovers. I had read previous reviews that said it was too salty so I used low-sodium beef broth and just 2 slices of bacon. Fantastic!
My daughters wanted to know if we could eat like that every night!

I prepared this dish for company just last night. It was a huge hit -- fabulous dish. My husband of 13 years said it was the best meal I had ever prepared. I served it on a large platter with rice pilaf all around it so the rice could pick up the flavor the sauce. Because the main dish is such a hit, just add a nice salad and bread to accompany. My guests raved and asked for the recipe. This dish is comparable to any dinner you would spend $200 for at a nice restaurant.

I made this for Sunday dinner and it was excellent.  The roasted shallot sauce really makes it.  I made the shallots and the broth earlier in the day so it would not take so much time later.  I served with Herbed Roasted Vegetables and Green Salad. Accompanied by a nice Cabernet!  Very Nice!!!

This was the BEST recipe ever.  We made it for Christmas eve dinner.  Everyone loved it.  My dad had two servings and died the next day.  It was his last supper : o no, seriously, it was.  He said it was the best beef he'd ever had.  I guess it was good enough to die for! (Sorry for the dark humor.  I loved him very much.)

I tried it for the first time last night. it took me about 3hrs with prep included. I like to take my time apparently, but was also cooking side dishes at the same time. My husband is a bit of a snob when it comes to streaks, especially if they aren't bbqed it is hard to please him in that sense. He said it rivaled any expensive steakhouse we've been to! and that he was shocked it wasn't bbqed for the flavor it had! I highly recommend, and will be making this again.

I followed the advise of another reviewer who made the gravy the day before and put the roasted shallots, bacon and the the wine sauce in the blender. (I used red wine instead of port)
 I also rubbed the beef with the  salt, pepper and thyme and browned the beef in the bacon drippings the night before and placed it back in the fridge.  The beef tenderloin was so moist you could cut in with a butter knife.  The gravy was amazing! I can't wait to make it again!

Incredible !! The shallots make this dish ! I agrees that , that is a lot of sauce for 2lbs of meat so I would probably cut it in half Next time . I got soOo many compliments ! I will be making this recipe for many family gatherings to come.

Made this twice for different family members.  They loved it.  There is a few steps but well worth it.  I bought a trimmed top choice tenderloin and it melted in our mouths.  My son-in-law could not compliment enough.  I made roasted vegetable in the oven and also served a salad.  Will continue to make it again and again...If there were more options for ratings I would have gave it a 10.

I made this for Hubs and my 15th wedding anniversary dinner.  I had the butcher cut me a 2-pound piece of beef tenderloin and I tied it so it would maintain a nice uniform shape.  I brought it to room temperature before roasting, which I believe really helps the meat cook more evenly.  Using a remote thermometer I roasted this for just about an hour, to an internal temperature of 130 degrees.  I tented it with foil for 10 minutes before carving.  This produced a perfect medium rare with a bright pink center.  A word of caution about the sauce.  Watch the salt!  I used regular beef broth, not low sodium, and I may have reduced it a bit too much.  I also salted and peppered the shallots before roasting and wouldn’t do that next time.  By the time I combined everything into the sauce it was too salty.  So next time I won’t salt anything until everything is combined.  The salt in the bacon alone may be plenty to season the sauce.  I would also roughly chop the shallots before roasting next time, rather than just halving them.

Very tasty! I blended the shallots, bacon, and wine/broth together to make a gravy as others have done and it was delish! Will use that as gravy for other dishes too. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit.

I have always made a prime rib roast for Christmas dinner but last year money was tight so I went to our local BJ's and got a beef tenderloin and cut it in half (froze the rest) and made this recipe.  A huge hit.  Am making it again this year!

Excellent. I joined allrecipes specifically so I could give this recipe my 5 stars. This is a truly stand-out recipe. It's delicious, and it's perfect for a holiday meal. The photos don't do it justice.

I made this on Christmas Eve and it was fabulous.  I did a 3lb. tenderloin.  The only blunder I made was not watching the broth/wine reduction more closely... It boiled down to about 3/4 of a cup and I'm sure this only added to the intensity of the flavoring! So..with the wine already on hand, I went out to store and picked up more broth and made another batch of the sauce.  Due to personal preference, I roasted til thermometer reached 135 and even this was almost too rare. Next time I'll try for closer to 140 deg.  I don't like blood oozing from meat but don't like it over-cooked either.  The sauce is fantastic and I'm thinking of adding in a cup of sauteed mushrooms and serving it over steak sometime.  I served it with parmesan/garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, rolls ... There was plenty of sauce for the meat and potatoes...yum!

This was the best tenderloin. I used 15 pounds of meat for 13-15 people but it was too much. Next time I will cut back to about 10 pounds.

Cooked this for our family Christmas dinner.  The only thing I decided to do differently was use less shallots than the recipe called for which was a personal preference.  The whole family thought it was YummmmO!

This was the recipe I used to make my family's Christmas dinner.  It was a huge hit!  I put the shallot gravy on the table for guests to take as little/much as they liked.  The beef was tender and lip-smacking good. I would do this again for sure, and I wouldn't change a thing.

This was fabulous.  Served to 30 guests and is easy to make for a crowd.  I roasted cremini mushroom and added to the sauce.  I doubled the sauce recipe to serve with 15 pounds of tenderloin and had half left over. Yummy, impressive to guests and easy!

Fully agree with all the other reviews!  Excellent flavor.  It received rave reviews at our Christmas dinner, even from our chef friend!  A bit time-consuming compared to most menus for us, but totally worth it. We prefer our meat medium, as opposed to the medium-rare, so we set the meat thermometer to register for 150 instead of 125, and got a perfect medium.  Served with prosciutto-wrapped asparagus (recipe from All Recipes), an excellent combination!

10 Star recipe! Restuarant quality for sure! I made this for Christmas dinner. Here's how I made it easier on myself.. I have homemade beef stock in my freezer that has been very much reduced, so I only reduced the port wine of which I started with half the amount. (I don't like a boozy taste.) I doubled the bacon. I did this the night before as well as roasting the shallots. And I skipped the tomato paste. The next day I browned the roast in bacon fat, added a Tbsp butter and the flour to make the roux and then added the beef, port wine mixture with the shallots and bacon while roasting the meat in the oven. I also skipped the thyme, salt & pepper. The gravy was AMAZING!!!!!

Made this for Christmas dinner of 20.  Flavor was good.  Sauce never thickened, had to add more flour to thicken.  Makes way too much sauce.  I would only make half the amount called for.  Kind of a busy dish.  I would prefer to marinate my steak, then saute mushrooms and shallots on the side.

Heaps of compliments on this wonderful recipe. I had to cook the meat at least 10-15 minutes more than indicated to get medium rare in the thickest part of the meat, but it was just fantastic - completely delivered for Christmas Eve dinner.

Extremely tender and the sauce is FABULOUS!  I added some sauteed mushrooms to it.  I went by the time of the recipe and the meat was quite rare, but I will bring it to room temp next time before baking.   This will definitely be a make again for a special occasion.

This was a hit even though I used ribeye instead of tenderloin. Roasted on 180 C for 30 mins, thereafter on 160 C for another 30 mins (covered in foil) for medium well. Also I did not have port wine on hand, so used red wine instead, but added about 1-1/2 teaspoons of sugar to sweeten the sauce a little. Not bad for a first try. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night for a Christmas Dinner with family and it was wonderful! It wasn't as much work as I thought after reading the reviews.  I did make the broth and wine and shallots ahead of time (I chopped roasted shallots in my veggie chop).  I used a meat thermometer and it came out perfect.  I added baby bella mushrooms when I did the bacon because we love mushrooms!! Thank you for sharing this recipe- we loved it!!

Amazing!! Made according to recipe except forgot tomato paste!  My son made this and we all thoroughly enjoyed.  Will definitely save for future special occasion since it is quite expensive if you use prime which we did.

I usually make the first try exactly to the recipe, but I just couldn't resist sprinkling a bit of garilc powder to the meat before browing. Anyway, it came out great! A tad labor intensive but worth it.  I made it for my wife and she raved. It went well with roasted rosemary potatoes and a full bodied Cabrenet. If you want to make someone feel special, this is the ticket!

After a life time of roasted turkey on Christmas day, I tried this recipe for Christmas dinner 5 years ago and it instantly became 'our (new) tradition'. Every year since, I have followed the original recipe exacty , except  increasing the shallots (we love onions). This recipe is well worth the extra effort and expense (beef tenderloin is not cheap).

I've never (successfully) cooked any recipe that called for wine, but this was easy, and absolutely delicious! didn't have time for homemade mashed potatoes, so i used the instant boxed mashed potatoes, and the gravy made even THOSE taste good. i followed other reviewers' suggestions and blended roasted shallots and wine/broth to make it smoother. Only other change i made was to add a bunch of minced garlic to the shallots while they roasted.   the estimated cook times the submitter gave were on the nose, which was great for me since i'd  never cooked anything like this before.    highly recommended!

Just AMAZING!  like some of the other reviewers, i made the bacon and sauce ahead of time and just added the juices from the beef after cooking.  I also blended the bacon, onion, port/broth mixture for a smoother consistency!  I really impressed my guests with this meal!  it's a keeper

I made this for Christmas Eve since I didn't want to overdose over the holidays with too much ham and turkey.  Wow; was this great.  I made 1 change due to one of my guests being gluten intolerant.  I used corn starch instead of flour.  (Trader Joes sells gluten free beef broth). My dinner was an absolute hit.  I did everything during the day up to the baking of the beef tenderloin - this made everything extra special easy so that I could relax while entertaining my guests.  7 people rated this a 5!!!!!!!!! (PS - my roast was 4 pounds and we had plenty of leftovers)......

I gave it a four stars simply because as I was making this, all I could think was "there's got to be simpler, less time consuming way to make this".  But I've gone over the recipe several times, and I can think of no way to lessen the prep time.  15min? I don't think so.  I did add fresh mushies with the shallots.  Indeed the flavour was fantastic - but I was disappointed with how "unorganized" I felt while preparing the dish.

Excellent!  I  couldn't find tenderloin at my local grocery store so I used thick cut ribeye steak, I also substituted grape juice for the port wine.  Will be making this again soon.

This took a little time to prepare, but was very good! I cooked some sliced mushrooms in the shallot pan at the end and added it to the gravy mix. I cooked chopped garlic with the shallots which was tasty. I cooked the bacon and then seared the meat in the pan before cooking. I actually forgot to put the bacon back in the mix at the end but it tasted fine without it! Thank you for the recipe.

I didnt use tenderloin because I wasnt sure Id like the sauce and didnt want to spend tenderloin $$$. With that said the piece of meat I used was tough and therefore not very good but the sauce WAS....although I would opt out of the wine (I used cab sauv and brown sugar per many of the reviews) - I have cooked with wine 3 or 4 times now and I just cant get used to the flavor (i add this for those who have similar taste buds as I noticed another reviewer had thought it was to winey tasting and the reason I didnt buy the tenderloin) - Other than that I thought this was a very good recipe - I LOVED the shallots (although I had to take from the bottom of the barrel at the store so they were a bit tough too so they didnt blend as well as I wanted a smoother sauce but it was still excellent as a chunky sauce) - I didnt think the recipe took all that much time, but it was my "cook at home night" so it prolly took longer than it felt as I was basically just messing around in the kitchen.  Some people said it was too salty and I will say that it did err on the side of salty but not overly so. AS far as the sauce reduction time and cooking time - I say this - every stove is different, so is every cut of meat - use a meat thermometer!!!!!!, not the recipe, and as for the reduction time on the sauce - pay attention and when you think its close - measure it - its that simple. I'd give this 4 stars with the tenderloin being used.  5 stars if u like cooking w/ wine and that flavor.

Loved this dish, the gravy was exceptional.  Even 4 kids under the age of 5 ate it up.  Just a tip- I used beef consumme instead of beef broth, felt it gave richer flavor.  Did take a while to prepare, will prepare gravy the night before next time.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  The beef tenderloin was a little out of my price range...so i substituted it with Prime Rib.  I doubled the recipe and roasted the 6 lbs peice of meat for 2 1/4 hours.  It turned out PERFECT.  everyone raved about it.  I found this recipe easy even though I have never made anything like it before.  Thanks so much!

Omitted the tomato paste and bacon but this still turned out great, i think this gave it a simpler cleaner flavor which gave the other ingredients more individuality. Served on top of lightly sauteed spinach with a side of mushrooms (for picky eaters). Will definitely be making this again!

We loved this recipe!  It took longer than I expected, but that always seems to be the case when I try a new recipe.  Plus the shallots I bought were huge-my fault.  Didn't have any port so subbed with some sherry and red.  I couldn't find a tenderloin roast, so I used a london broil and did it on the stove in the pan I used for the bacon.  Served with my roasted potatos and veggies.  Husband LOVED it, as did I.  Can't wait to do it again!!!!

This was awesome!  Instead of the oven I pan roasted the shallots with mushrooms.  When they were done I poured 1 quart of beef stock, omitting the port, and reduced.  While that was cooking the tenderloin was in the oven.  When the sauce was reduced I added the tomato paste and cooked for a couple of minutes.  I piut it all in the food processor and it was so thick and chunky that I didn't have to used extra flour and butter to make a gravy.  My family raved.

This dinner is AWESOME!!  I've made it several times, either with roasted red potatoes or red mashed potatoes.  I actually double the flour, b/c I like the port wine sauce a little thicker...not that hard to make and a HUGE hit with everyone!

Wonderful.  I made this for my dad and in-laws for Father's Day.  I made the shallot sauce the day before and heated it up before serving.  Like other reviewers, I pureed the shallots.  I also did not have port wine -- used a meritage instead.  It was fabulous and definitely worth the little extra time it took.

This is now my go to item for special dinner! Yes, the sauce takes a bit of time but oh my! I usually do much of it ahead of time. It is definitely worth the effort.

Wow, yes, awesome.  I was the Queen of the Night after serving this.  The sauce does make a ton.  I had a 3lb tenderloin and had a lot of leftover gravy.  I followed others' advice and pre-made the bacon and the first step of the sauce.  I also got antsy and spooned the drippings out of the roasting pan to add to the sauce.  I was worried about timing with the side dishes.  It turned out wonderfully - really, a great special dinner recipe.

This recipe is wonderful!  The sauce is amazing.  The first time I made it, I didn't double the sauce and was sorry!  I used shoulder tenderloin instead of beef tenderloin.  . It was a lot more economical and the taste was almost identical. It isn't even really necessary to make anything ahead.  Peeling shallots was the most that I did before beginning the recipe.  This is my new standard recipe to impress guests..

This was a good recipe.  I made it for a 40th anniversary dinner, but wish that I had had an opportunity to do a test run on it.  However, I wasn't about to do a practice meal with a $75 piece of beef!  I doubled the sauce as per many people's suggestion, and it was NOT necessary.  Also, I did not put any herbs on the outside, and I don't think it took away anything from the dish.  My one complaint is that I had to run all over the place to find shallots, and when I did, they were so expensive.  I spent $25 on shallots to make double the sauce.  However, they have such a unique flavour that I think it was worth it.  Overall, a pretty good recipe.

I used onions instead of shallots, which gave it a grayish brown color. Other than that, my family LOVED it! I'll get shallots next time.

SO good, complex taste with easy preparation. My family was really impressed! I didn't have port and can't have butter, so I used regular red wine and Smart Choice Butter and it was just AMAZING! Thanks:)

The "goodness" everyone mentions, in my opinion, probably depended mostly on the quality of their meat.  The sauce wasn't anything spectacular, and I didn't find that the shallots/bacon added much to the overpowering taste of the wine.  If you like a more salty sauce, this recipe isn't for you.  I would recommend reducing the amount of wine you put in your sauce to bring out more of the flavors (and hard work you put into!) of the other ingredients

I have to jump on the bandwagon and give this a great review. It was tender and moist. I had fresh beef broth made from neckbones for the gravy. I served it to company and they all went for seconds and went on about how good the gravy was and started asking me how to make it. This was my first successful roast beef and will be a standard recipe for me.

Excellent recipe however we prefer cabernet to port in the sauce. It give a bolder deeper depth to the sauce.

What can I say, this was phenomenal! I think it is  honestly one of the best things I have ever made. Expensive? Yes. Time consuming? Yes. But SO worth it. I followed the recipe and scaled it to serve 10. I roasted the shallots and cooked down the broth /wine the day before. The rest I prepared on Christmas morn for our 1pm lunch. So tender, so flavorful! I did not blend/puree the sauce, I liked it the way it was. This will be my go to for super special occasions from now on.

My sister and I made this fabulous dish for our families for Christmas Day yesterday and even her 14-year-old son commented that he "didn't want this meal to end".  The men especially loved the shallot sauce, and we all thought the meat itself was wonderfully tender.  We served the tenderloin with glazed baby carrots and mashed potatoes.  Definitely a 5-star meal, thank you!

Wow, this was phenomenal!  I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving because we already had our turkey meal on Saturday.  Everyone loved it!  Also, some reviewers mentioned the sauce being a lot of work, I didn't think it was really very difficult at all.  I did add cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it because it wasn't thickening as much as I wanted it to.  Also, for some reason my meat seems to get over-done, took it out at 125 degrees and the rarest part was medium.  We prefer medium-rare, but it was still delicious.  Planning to make this again for Christmas dinner with other guests.

Outstanding! My whole family loved this dish.  I did puree the sauce which I wouldn't do the next time.  I think it would be better (if that's possible) to enjoy the texture of the chunkier sauce smothered on top of the beef.

We halved the recipe for two people and we used fresh rosemary from our garden since we didn't have any thyme.  This recipe was excellent and will now be a staple at our house for special occasions and general spoilings.  My husband cooked it in a dutch oven and between prep and actual cook time, it really only took an hour and twenty minutes.  He did say the key to timing was being able to manage the three steps of onions, sauce, and meat.

Definitely a Keeper!  I have made this recipe several times, and it's foolproof.   Easy to serve a crowd with this recipe,and everyone loves it.  It's just as good with onions substituted for the shallots, without tomato paste, and without the watercress. Once I added fresh sliced mushrooms to the onions and that was delicious too.

wowed my husband and parents on Father's Day with this one.  I usually cut my tenderloin into filets and grill them.  This was a more formal and delicious presentation.  I agree with everyone else, the gravy is fabulous!

Amazing, my fiancee loved it. Definitely make the sauce the day before, and use the blender. Had leftovers this morning and it was even better than last night.I also used cabernet and brown sugar instead of port. The meat was very tender.Fantastic.

Really delicious sauce! I didn't have beef tenderloin so I made with a Sirloin Steak and it was still really good. Will definitely use the sauce for other things as well!

this is definitely one of the most incredible meals i've ever made! the meat just melts in your mouth! it was so tender and flavorful the sauce almost takes away from it. 25 min for the internal temp to hit 125 was way off for us, it took closer to 40 min! keep in mind too that some roasting pans cannot go on the stove top. i served it with bacon wrapped asparagus (since we had the rest of the pkg left). amazing!

I basically replaced the tenderloin with a cut of beef brisket, but kept everything else the same. I was told by many that it was the best brisket EVER! I made sure i poked holes via fork into the meat, added salt, pepper, steakhouse seasoning, and evoo, then let to marinate for 1-1.5 days. amazing. paper towel the meat, then sprinkle with thyme, brown it in a pan of bacon grease, then bake it covered in foil in some wine port and beef broth. Making the sauce in advance is what I did as well. The shallots/garlic/port/beef broth was excellent! Next time, I will try with fresh thyme!

Tasted like a high end restaurant meal.  Did take some time for prep which took away from visiting.  I would do my own timing differently if making again.

This was fantastic! I used a 10-yr old port and loved the results. Combine with a side of asparagus for a great meal.

THANK YOU!  This was the best roast I have ever made hands down.  I had to substitute the port because I didn't have any on hand and didn't have time to go get some, I had a bottle of Concorde which is a very sweet syrupy red wine and used that instead.  Other than that I did not change a thing.  I can't wait to try this with the port as written!  I will be making this one again & again for all kinds of occasions. AWESOME!

Excellent!  Just like everyone said.  I did not blend the sauce and was so happy I didn't.  It was fantastic the way it is directed in this recipe.  I did, however, chose a cheaper peice of meat.  The meat was tough and when paired with the sauce, every bite I thought to myself that I NEED to try this with the tenderloin.  I know that it will be amazing!  If you do chose a cheaper roast, you might want to give it more cooking time.  I took mine out at 135 and it was a bloody mess on the inside.  That was okay for me since I knew I was putting it in a crock pot and it would continue to cook.  But if you wanted to serve immediately, definitely go with traditional beef temp guidelines.  I loved this dish and will definitely make it again...soon...with filet!  One more thing.  I made the Goat Cheese Mashed Potato Gratin and that was outstanding with this dish!

Made this for 8 people for Christmas dinner, and it was wonderful.  The au jus was a big hit!
I would recommend pulling the roast at 115 or 120 before tenting it - I pulled mine at 120 and the temp rose to about 132 in the center by the time we carved it, so it was a perfect rosy pink in the center.  If some of your guests like their meat rarer, pull it at 115.  125 would have made it a bit too done for my taste.
Served it with marinated roasted veggies, Red Garlic Mashed Potates and Yorkshire Pudding.

I've made this three times and it is excellent. The first two times I used tenderloin and most recently, prime rib. It's the sauce that makes this dish so a more affordable cut of beef would would too. I love the modify recipes, but this recipe is just about perfect.

This was really good.  I had to make some changes since the store was completely out of shallots.  To make up for this, I used an 18.8 oz can of carmelized french onion soup (Campbell's Select Harvest) for some of the beef stock.  I also used regular red wine with a little brown sugar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  I'm sure that the recipe as it is, is wonderful but this substitution made it even easier and it still was excellent.

This is by far the most delicious beef meal I have ever served.  The sauce is wonderful.  I used a 6 lb tenderloin (took out a bank loan to purchase it!) and cooked it to 135 degrees at the thickest portion and it was perfect.  Since it wasn't completely porportional there were more some parts done more than others and this worked perfectly for the variety of tastes in my family.  I followed this recipe to the letter and did take others advice and put everything for the sauce in a blender.  Outstanding!

INCREDIBLE! This was the most spectacular meal I have served! It is worth every penny and all the effort.
I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it was perfect! The shallot/wine sauce is just superb. If you are looking for something that will WOW them, look no more. It just can't get better! Thank you for this decadent recipe. It will be a special occasion meal here from now on!

*****I love this recipe and have made it every year for Christmas for the last 4 years. But it is a LOT of work. I decided not to make it this year and I am disappointed because I really looked forward to it. But last year we had mostly children for Christmas and they did not appreciate this meal. Too much work for it not to be appreciated and only wasted. I will make it for a dinner party in the future when the guest list is Adults only.

I made this today for my Grandpa's birthday. We used a 3.5 pound roast so it took about 40 mins in the oven. I blended the sauce as others suggested and added mushrooms to the pan while it was cooking.  The mushrooms soaked up all the goodness in the pan so they were REALLY good!! Worth the time and money forsure. My Grandma actaully said "I didn't know beef could taste this good! I also served this with the Almond Bundt Cake that's on this website.  Perfect match for this meal.  No beef or cake was leftover!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  It really isn't very difficult and most of it can be done ahead of time.  It does take some time to roast the shallots and reduce the sauce, but it's a hands off process and you can be prepping the rest of your meal while it's being done. I did everything the morning of my dinner party (including searing the meat).I put it in the refrigerater, then took it out to come to room temperature a couple of hours before I put it in the oven.  I served this with roasted fall vegetables and steamed asparagus. It received rave reviews from my guests!

I used a 2 lb tri-tip roast which was plenty for our family of 3. After patting the meat dry, I rubbed the meat with olive oil & salt & pepper, then rolled it in a panko crusted blend. Seared in a cast iron pan and went straight into the oven at 375 degrees for 25 minutes for 'Medium'. I accidentally used an entire 6 oz can of tomato paste for the sauce, but it turned out just fine. It was delicious and looked beautiful - served with French bread, potatoes and green salad. Will definitely try the correct tomato paste measurement next time, with quartered mushrooms as suggested by others. Don't forget to let the meat rest so the juices can redistribute! Awesome recipe!!!

This was incredible- fine dining quality. I did not have a meat thermometer and like my meat more well done so I cooked it for about 45 minutes. It was still a bit rare when I cut into it, so I sliced it and cooked it in the sauce for a couple of minutes.The meat was very tender. I think this sauce would be amazing on a pork loin.

Wow, this was fantastic.  I also pureed the shallots.  No wonder reviewers were making this for a special occasion, this meet is pretty expensive... but well worth it.  I made sandwiches the following days with the leftovers.

This was incredible!! So yummy and definitely worth the trouble.  I used a venison loin and it was still amazing.  Also, I did not have shallots, so I just used regular onion, but cut back on the quantity somewhat.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T (OK, I might have added just a wee bit more port wine) and it was incredible.  I would give it ten stars if I could.  And can't wait to try it with beef and shallots!  Thanks for a great recipe!! One of the best on this site!

This recipe took quite a long time to make, but it was well worth it.  My wife was not really into the recipe, but as they say, there is no accounting for taste.  It just was not her thing.  But I loved it.  The sauce was unbelievably tasty.  And the meat turned out very tender.

I made this for dinner tonight...not a special occasion..and for 2 adults and 3 kids.  We all really enoyed it.  I also blended the sauce, based on the advice of the previous reviews.  Will definely make again.  Even my 11 year old, who rarely eats meat liked this.  The sauce is really, really good.  The reviews are rright on.  This one is a keeper.

Delicious!  Loved it!  I consider myself to be a good cook at a fairly young age, but getting my beef dishes so tender has been my cooking challengs.  This recipe is the one that convinced I CAN make tender beef, haha!  I had no shallots on hand so roasted regular white onions instead.  I also omitted the bacon step as my husband and I do not eat pork.  Instead I sauteed more onions and some minced garlic and then seared the beef in the same pan.  Just before placing in the oven I threw in several large quartered mushrooms.  I cooked my beef to more of a medium (don't care for the bloody juice) and it still turned out fabulously moist!  But I think next time I will 'undercook' just a bit because the beef does continue to cook for a few more minutes after coming out of the oven.  I didn't even think the ommition of the bacon hurt the flovor of this dish at all.  I think I might try it with turkey bacon next time just to see what the flavor is like.  As for the sauce, I only had about 1/4 cup of red wine left in my pantry, so that's what I used.  I also used about 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste to make more of a tomato sauce and used only half the butter and flour to make it less heavy.  It turned out very good this way.  I agree with another cook on probably wanting to thin the sauce out a bit to more of an 'au jus' type consistency.  The beef is so flavorful on it's on that it doesn't really need a heavy sauce.  But the sauce went very well with some stovetop grilled potatoe

I made this for 40 people for a 12th Night Celebration. Boy, folks loved it. It was the talk of the meal. I had a huge bag of shallots to use up so I only picked this recipe because of that. The name is a misnomer- It should be Beef Tenderloin with Sherry/Shallot Sauce. I plan on serving it again for Easter dinner. An improvement over our traditional ham. I have already emailed this recipe to several folks who have asked for it. I agree with smoothing the sauce before serving. I used an imersion blender for a better texture.

This was really tasty but for the price of the meal I would rather have eaten out. I think the beef alone was around $30. So while it was quite good I won't be making it again. Thanks for the interesting meal though.

If I could give this recipe a 10, I would! My husband and I have been to many many steakhouses and had many many orders of filet mignon, but this tops them all. The sauce is to die for, so delicious. I would not change a thing in this recipe. It really is as good as everybody says it is!

Made this for Christmas dinner- was alot of work for OK results.  We did not enjoy the bacon flavor in the sauce. If I make again it will be without the bacon.

Excellent - but a LOT OF WORK!!!  I had not made a beef tenderloin before - so stressed about it a bit.... I think that I could have cooked it a little longer. This was very RED at 127 degrees.  That was Med. Rare in the recipe - but really felt it looked very rare to our family that likes steak at Medium. This was so tender- and the gravy/sauce was fantastic!!!

I can't comment on the beef tenderloin, because I only made the sauce for another dish but I had to comment on it because it was amazing!  I used more liquid (about 4 c. beef STOCK and 1.5 c port wine) and reduced in to about 2 c total for a very rich flavor.  I did follow the advice of others before me and puree the roasted shallots (I don't like a very chunky texture), I added the shallot paste at the end but left the bacon pieces whole.  I think this is one of the absolute best sauces I have ever had and certainly the best one I have ever made.  It will definitely be added to my repertoire.

I thought this would be much better.  The sauce was extremely salty and we use low sodium for everything.  I think we will try it once more to see if it was something we did wrong, but I just wasn't very happy with it.

Ok...this was awesome!  I couldn't find a tenderloin roast at the store I went to, so I bought steak sirloins instead.  They were thick like a filet mignon but looked like they were cut from the roast.  This may have been a cheaper way to go.  They only cost $8 for two steaks.  I browned them in the pan as directed and slid them into the oven to finish cooking the centers.  The sauce was AMAZING.  My husband puts A1 on everything and didn't even reach for the bottle.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good.  Took a while longer to cook the meat than the recipe states, but well worth it.  And with the sauce, I ran it through a sieve just before serving to make it smooth.

Pricey cut of meat but it sure was worth every penny... and then some!  Such a divine recipe. The only thing I left out was the sprigs of watercress for garnishment. I just didn't have it on hand. 
I as well took the suggestion of a couple of other posters and had put the wine/broth mix, the bacon & shallots into the blender to make a smoother sauce. 
I also roasted the tenderloin longer because I prefer my meat on the medium-medium well side.  My family raved this recipe! I will surely be making this over & over again. Thanks for sharing!

I love the sauce from this recipe! The first time I followed the recipe and thought it was great, but the second time I made it, I made the sauce ahead of time, and served it over a pot roast I cooked in my slow cooker. I cooked the pot roast for 8 hours on low using a packet of lipton onion soup mix and 2 cups of pepsie.Just poured the sauce over it at the end. Everyone loved it, said it was the best thing I ever made. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for Christmas dinner.  I was looking for great results because of the cost of the cut.  We all loved it and I have teenagers.  I got to try out my oven meat thermometer that is built into my new oven. How great was that!  We served it with garlic mashed potatoes.

Yummy. The recipe looks daunting, but I made the sauce & roasted shallots ahead and just popped in the beef when the boyfriend and I were getting hungry. Cooked it well done because I'm pregnant, but it was still wonderful! The sauce is so simple & to die for. Thanks!!

This dish was so good!  I substituted a cheaper cut of meat, and it was delicious.  If you can multi task in the kitchen, this dish doesn't take all that long to prepare.  I was a little heavy handed with the salt, so be careful where it says "season with salt" I can't wait to serve this again!

This was really, really easy and delicious. A little time consuming. I changed the recipe by just pouring the sauce over the tenderloin about 5-10 min. before it was ready. It made it delicious because it had some time to marinate and cooking the sauce helped to thicken it as well.

Wonderful!!  My family loves filet mignon.  This was my first try with a whole tenderloin.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Made if for Father's Day.  Dad and Grampa were both very satisfied.

Absolutely wonderful. I'm a college student and wanted to give myself a challenge. This was easy to make and impressed my entire family, as well as my boyfriend. I added quartered mushrooms and served with sliced potatoes and steamed veggies and it was absolutely amazing.

I make it every single year for Christmas. I actually had some tenderloin left over (uncooked) in the freezer because I over bought last year, so I am made it again - for a mid-week feast!

Make the wine/sauce ahead - you really dont need the beef drippings to make it better. And absolutely make extra of this gravy - we double it, then I freeze small bags, and when we have a plain steak, I take out the sauce to jazz it up. Everyone has loved this recipe, and you really can't go wrong!!

Beautiful sauce, lovely recipe!!  Just prepared with individual filets on stovetop.  Served w/ simple s/p roasted red potatoes and roasted asparagus.  Yum!  Thank you for posting!  Oh yeah, I used pancetta instead of bacon.

I made this for a dinner party to celebrate my husband’s birthday.  I trusted the past reviews and it turned out well.  Everyone loved it, especially the gravy – it is well worth the work it takes to prepare it.  Only change, I roasted mushroom along with the shallots.  I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe and will make it again for a special occasion.

Although this takes a while to prepare the sauce, it is AMAZING!  My husband and 3 boys love it!  I didn't change a thing from recipe, other than I grilled the steaks.  Taste like something from an expensive restaurant.  Thanks!

Iused this recipe primarily for the gravy. The gravy was very tasty, but I think 3/4 lb. of shallots is a little too much. I will use this recipe again, but will use about 1/2 the amount of shallots.

A-frickin-mazing! I made this for Christmas and everyone said it was the best meal I have ever made, hands down (and I'm a pretty good cook!) The sauce is to die for! I reccommend using a digital thermometer for the perfect "doneness." Yum, yum, and triple yum!

I served this on Christmas Eve, and my family loved it!  The sauce was amazing, and the meat was fork-tender.  I cooked it to a higher temperature and the meat was still a little too pink for me, so we put a few slices back in the oven for a few minutes to cook through.  Delicious!

Excellent recipes.  My in-laws could not stop raving about the sauce.  I followed the recipe for the most part but took out the shallots and put them on the platter with the tenderloin.  (My kids would have revolted if they saw the shallots in the sauce.)  I will most definitley use this recipe again.  I cooked our tenderloin to a temperature of 140 degrees as my father-in-law likes his meat more toward well done.  I would say the meat was cooked to medium at 140.  It was hot throughout with a pink center.

I made this on Christmas Day for 15 people using an 8 1/2 lb. tenderloin.  I reduced the sauce and roasted the shallots the day before so it was very easy to actually prepare the day of.  I re-heated the small baking dish with the shallots in the oven while the beef cooked and then chopped them (using kitchen scissors) before adding them to the sauce.  It was wonderful and if prepped ahead, it is actually not that much work.  TRY IT!!

I bought 1.25lbs of filet mignon because I didn't need a full 2lbs of the roast and it only came in 5 lb cuts at my store. Not nearly as intimidating as it seemed. Very very good! I will absolutely do this recipe again. The sauce was awesome. I was so pleased with myself once we finished eating.

Husband loves it! Sauce is awesome. I had something similar at a restaurant however, it was $37/plate! I used a cabernet sauvignon wine instead and rosemary instead of thyme. I didn't have shallots so I used little onions and red bell pepper. I will make again but I will try to have port on hand. Great sauce!!!!

FABULOUS! "The best meal I've had in a VERY long time" said my guests! It was a lot of work but we did a lot a head of  time. Step 1 and Step 2 was done hours before guests arrived. We also cooked bacon hours in advance. Once guests arrived, the final prep came together quickly. We are making it again tonite...Just for the 2 of us! Yummy!

This was excellent. I need to watch the salt next time, because with the bacon, broth,and salted shallots, it was a bit too salty. I also have made this with venison tenderloin, and it was superb.

This was okay...you can't really go wrong with a tenderloin.  I thought it would be a little better though, hence the 4 stars.

FANTASTIC!  I joined allrecipes.com just so I could review this recipe.  I made it for Christmas dinner and my husband, son and daughter all thought they were eating in a gourmet restaurant. I roasted the shallots and did the reduction the day before so the actual meal prep on Christmas Day was not too long.  The sauce is so incredibly tasty you'll want to drink it! I served the dish with the marinated barbeque vegetables and the garlic mashed red potatoes (both recipes from this site).  Everything was absolutely delicious and the presentations made for a very colorful table.

I am a huge fan of this recipe it is so delicious. I am a culinary arts student and we were assigned a cut of meat for our final and i was given the tenderloin and we had to find a recipe to make and i came across this one and it was the best tasting in the whole class. My family loves for me to cook this on special occasions due to the fact the sauce is so rich. I am actually making it for a get together for my mom and her friends tomorrow and i can not wait to amaze them with how wonderful this recipe is. It takes some time to prepare but it is well worth it!

Very, very good.  Next time, I will not only cut my shallots lengthwise, but I will also cut up after being roasted, as the shallots were a bit stringy in the sauce.  Smaller bits would look nicer coming out of the sauce, instead of a large pieces all at once.  One of my guests at Easter had three helpings of sauce.  But all in all, a VERY good sauce, and I did not find it labor intensive at all.  Will make again!

This is a 5-star restaurant quality recipe!  The sauce was fabulous.  I used a red zinfandel and cooked it a little longer.  130 on my thermometer was still rare in the middle.  I've thrown all the leftovers in the crockpot for dinner tonight and its wonderful.  This is a great "look what I can do" recipe for in-laws ;)  Thanks!

Loved this sauce!  I used a large (7.5 lb.) beef tenderloin and this was a huge hit!!! i strongly recommend taking the meat out well before it is cooked to your liking.  Tent it with aluminum foil and finish the sauce and it came out perfectly!  Raves all around.  Leftovers were wonderful when i cubed the meat-heated it in the leftover sauce and served it over mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the super recipe.

DELICIOUS! Don't skimp on the cut of meat because the texture and flavor of the meat cannot be saved by any amount of sauce.  The sauce was by the way, delicious.  Instead of port I used cabernet.  A tip for all who are looking for a good red cooking wine: I use Georges Duboef cabernet which is under $6 a bottle.  It is far better than cheap port or grocery store cooking wines.

My husband and I used this recipe for our first ever pot roast and really impressed the inlaws!  We used top sirloin and it tasted wonderful.  We also left out the bacon but it was still great.  Next time I might try adding the bacon and a few less shallots.  It was more of a shallot sauce than a gravy with shallots for flavour.

This should be a 10 star recipe!  Definitely reserve for special occasions do to the cost and time involved, but I have never eaten a better tenderloin/fillet recipe, and we are fine dining junkies.  I have made this several times and after cooking, I slice the meat and lay it on a bed of orzo pasta and drizzle sauce over it to serve.  Excellent!

This was good, but my 10 yr. old son wouldn't eat it. Me and my 14 yr. old daughter LOVED it. The sauce was excellent. HOWEVER, I used a top round roast instead of the tenderloin, and the meat came out kind of tough. So the next time I make this, I am definately going to invest in the tenderloin. I may also try this with a pork tenderloin too. I added mushrooms to the shallots and because I didn't have enough shallots, I used onions too. But the sauce came out excellent anyway. It was the cut of meat that I was disapointed in. If you are thinking of taking the inexpensive way out, you may have the same problem I did. I also did the onions and sauce in the morning and made the meat at dinner time. It was less time consuming. This recipe is actually much easier then it looks. Thanks Christine!

Delicious sauce!! I tried this on my husband before trying it on company and he loved it. He stated that he would love it with any type of meat. The sauce is time consuming but not difficult to make so make it ahead of time. I used pork tenderloin as suggested by others. Since I did not have tomato sauce I substituted ketchup. I also used Hormel Bacon bits in the sauce, which saved some time. I blended the sauce but did NOT  like the appearance or the consistency of the thick puree and in the future will cut up the shallots into small pieces. I plan to triple the recipe and freeze the remainder of the sauce

Excellent!!! Absolutely delicious and not all that difficult to make. I felt like a gourmet chef. Followed the recipe almost to a tee. Did adjust the beef cooking time to 20-25 minutes per pound, not total cooking time, yeilding a perfect medium rare roast. Omitted a bit of the butter in the sauce, and used reduced sodium broth with great results. A five star dish!!!

Followed suggestions in other ratings to roast shallots and make sauce ahead of time.  Glad I did that.  The sauce did not thicken as much as expected.  Cooked meat 25 minutes a lb - boyfriend really liked meat.  This recipe is alot of work - especially for inexperienced cooks

I reworked this recipe a bit and it was still excellent. It is very time consuming, but not difficult to make, but (like other reviewers suggested) I prepared this in steps throughout the day and it wasn't so bad. I didn't feel like spending $60 on a piece of tenderloin so instead I got some nice thick top sirloin and cooked them on the stove and did the sauce separate. I omitted cooking the steak in the bacon fat (not necessary) and did not deglaze the pan and the sauce was still out of this world! Yum. The wine added just the right amount of sweetness. I may try this with chicken next.***Added later***This is one of my absolute FAVORITE recipes from this site. Every time I make it (and there have been many occasions) people BEG me for the recipe.

Want to impress your family, friends, or co-workers for dinner?  This is the ultimate meal to do it with!  It's a bit on the pricey side to make, but well worth it.  I made this using the beef tenderloin.  My friend made it using a pork tenderloin.  Each was equally delicious!!!

This recipe probably deserves 5 stars more then any other I have reviewed in the past. It was just perfect, so delicious. My daughter was visiting and made it, doubled the recipe for a large amount of people. Everyone loved it, kids and adults alike. No leftovers and everyone asking for the recipe. This is a great one for company or for a special occasion.

Let me start with the fact that I am a novice cook.  This was relatively easy!  Next time I will probably roast a hint of garlic along with the shallots - the gravy was tangy but seemed to be missing something.   The cut of meat was fabulous (yes, sticker price was a shock - nearly $40 for two pounds of tenderloin), but pork tenderloin may be a great alternative.  Served this with smashed potatoes, green beans and a nice pinot for Valentine's Day.  Was a real hit and made me look like a master chef!

I made this recipe for a special dinner for my husband.  We both LOVED it! I cooked a 1 1/2 lb roast for closer to an hour though.  It makes plenty of extra sauce for leftovers.  Served it with asparagus and wild mushroom pilaf - delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!  (I did try freezing the leftover sauce but we did not like it reheated, not sure why but it seemed to have lost it's wonderful taste & consistency after being frozen).

The darned grocery store was out of shallots and we were shopping at 8:00pm on New Years eve for New year's dinner.  The meat counter was closed so we were only able to get a piece of meat 1/2 the size needed.  Even so, this was AMAZING.  I'll definately make it again - this time with the right ingredients!

This was the best beef dish I ever had. I did not feel the sauce was hard to make either.I actually thought the dish was rather easy to prepare. I can't wait to have company so I can serve this dish.I made this dish with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  THE BEST!!!

This was the best red meat recipe I have ever tried.  The only change I made was that I roasted mushrooms instead of the shallots.  I felt like I was sitting down to an expensive dinner at a fine restaurant.  (Except that I could see all of the dirty dishes in the kitchen out of the corner of my eye.)  It does take some time to prepare, but worth every minute.  I served it with garlic green beans and mashed potatoes.  The excess gravy was wonderful over the potatoes.  Thank you Christine!!

This recipe is too labor-intensive for weeknight dinner, but perfect for a special dinner party. The sauce was a little too strong for me, but others at the table gobbled it up. Definitely a tasty, juicy, and impressive main course.

WOW!!  I made this recipe for New Years Eve and everyone enjoyed it so much.  The port wine made the sauce a little bit sweet and it was wonderful. The sauce is time consuming to make but well worth the wait!!  I made a mandarin almond green salad and roasted red potatoes to accompany the dish and I will be making it again.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner and it was a success!  I also made it a few weeks before Christmas just to make sure I liked the recipe since I was cooking for a large crowd I wanted to please.  The first time, I didn't use the port wine but used cooking wine instead. (It was Sunday and the liquor store was closed.) For Christmas Eve I used a good quality port wine.  It was good the first time but unbelievable the second time.  I was almost embarrassed by all the compliments I received during dinner!

The sauce is just wonderful!  You can leave out the tomato paste and use white wine for a more savory flavor.  An amazingly easy recipe for the results.

Very good!  The sause does take a little time and the shalotts took longer than expected to brown but well worth it!  A good bottle of wine and it was like a fancy resterant.  The sauce is great with mashed potatoes also!  I did substitute red wine for the port along with a little brown sugar and it was great.

The tenderloin was great but both my guests and I didn't think the sauce added much.  If I made this again, I would either puree or chop the shallots as suggested by one of the other reviewers.

I made this for my husbands birthday party.  What a hit!  I almost didn't have enough.  I did put more beef broth in the sauce because it was a little sweet for my taste.  Otherwise, it was perfect.

Absolutely delicious.  We used a cheap port and a 3-lb trimmed tenderloin.  I was afraid the sauce might be a little too rich for the meat, but  it was a perfect complement.  We left the roast in the oven until 130 degrees, but other than that follwed the recipe written.

This was absolutely the very best beef I have ever cooked, Based on everyone's comments I took a big chance and made it for the first time for Christmas dinner.  People are still raving about it days later. Like the others, I prepped ahead as much as possible. and blended the shallots, broth/wine/tomato paste and bacon. otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I used a 7 pound beef tenderloin but did not increase the broth mix and I still have some left over.  I iwll definitely make this again. Perfection!

This was amazing! Top notch. The most tender piece of meat, and with the shallot sauce... flavor dynamite.  I made a 7lb beef tenderloin for Christmas dinner. Followed the cooking instructions. I personally like my meat rare so next time I'll take it out at 120°. Temp climbed to 135° while resting and came out to a perfect medium rare. The day before I made the sauce minus the drippings and the butter-flour mixture (added while meat rested). I also roasted garlic along with the shallots and pureed in a blender. I served with roasted Brussel sprouts and twice baked potatoes. Guests were dropping forks and moaning this was so good. Delicious!

This was superb! I followed the suggestion of others by roasting the shallots and making the broth/wine reduction a day ahead and putting both in the fridge. I also put the shallots in a blender after roasting to make them smoother for the gravy - this is definitely the way to go. My 2.5 lb roast took about 45 minutes to be done to medium (our preference) with several other items in the oven at the same time.

I made right by the recipe.  I have served this for several small dinner parties and family Christmas Eve dinner.  It is absolutely delicious and a very impressive dish.   My boyfriend (now husband probably due to this recipe) said he had never had anything in a restaurant this good.

This is a Thanksgiving tradition since 2009 for us.   The sauce is delicious and the tenderloin, which we always get in a larger size, feeds a good sized crowd.  Well worth the effort to make.

The flavor was great but the meat was tough still and did not shred like I though it would. Also had to add more tablespoons of flour. Not sure if i would have to cook it longer.

Absolutely fabulous! Followed the recipe exactly, and while it was rather time-consuming (just like the recipe states) it was so worth it. Made it for my husband on Father’s Day and I will certainly make it again (when I have a lot of extra time on my hands!). It was beautiful and worthy of serving to guests for any special occasion. Thank you!

Beef cooked faster than i imagined. So so so so wonderful. Ised merlot salt to marinate. This recipe is amazing. I used almond flour and glucocomon powder instead of regular flour, trying to be low carb. Used the loaded cauliflower recipe. Delicious delicious dinner.

Delicious! I had a tenderloin tail, so I had to adjust for that. It weighed less than a pound. I kind of overcooked the loin. I checked at 10 minutes and wasn't to temp, then cooked an additional 10 minutes. A bit too much, but not too bad. I think 15 minutes would have been good. I never chop bacon first. I just cook it whole and break it into bits. The  sauce is phenomenal! I made the  whole sauce. I have a bit too much leftover. I also added in sauteed mushrooms in the sauce. I bought some nice shiitakis at the farmer's market. Wonderful!

The sauce was to die for.  This dinner was absolutely delicious.  We got our center cut beef tenderloin form a local butcher and it was well worth it.  The meet was so tender and the sauce complimented it well.

I would suggest that the prep time is more like an hour.  Cooking time about an hour too.   To me cooking time is sitting on the couch time, not stirring time.  Turned out amazing wife and teenager were both very impressed.

Made this for Christmas dinner with about a 6lb tenderloin. The sauce is excellent! I doubled it because I like a lot of sauce and made the broth/wine reduction a day early along with the roasted shallots. I followed others and fried the bacon in a cast iron pan, then seared the beef in it. When I was ready to make the gravy, I skimmed some of the fat out, melted butter and added the flour to make a roux. Then I added the broth/wine reduction. I blended some of the shallots and bacon with a bit of the broth in a food processor to make it thicker and because I didn’t want chunks of shallots in the gravy. I pulled the beef out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for a couple hours before patting it dry and seasoning it. It only took a hour (if that) to cook. I had a temperature probe in and cooked it to medium (about 140 degrees).

This was as good as the reviews stated. So glad we tried this for our Christmas dinner. After slicing, we stuck it back in the  oven for 10 minutes to cook it a little more. It was still tender enough to cut with the side of a fork. Very tasty, worth the effort.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner. I couldn’t splurge for the tenderloin, so I followed all the instructions but with a round top steak (I browned the meat), and then I put everything in the crockpot for a few hours. I pulled the meat out before serving it, and blended everything else for a smooth gravy. Served over mashed potatoes with a side of Brussels Sprouts- it was delicious, and the whole family loved it. Fantastic recipe- this one is definitely a keeper!

Delicious exactly as the recipe calls for. We made this for Thanksgiving Abd are making it again today on Christmas. But today we are shipping the yummy sauce because dear husbands forgot the shallots at the store. I'm manning a simpler pan sauce instead.

Made exactly according to recipe, but modified timing. Roasted shallots and made port/broth sauce at the same time as I roasted the beef. Everything was ready at the same time. Tried to use immersion blender to smooth sauce, but there wasn't enough liquid and it splattered everywhere without actually blending the shallots. Overall, it was good, not great.

I had such high hopes for this recipe. I used a Choice cut because Costco was out of Prime cuts of tenderloin. The beef wasn’t as tender as I’ve had in the past. Next it’s Prime beef or nothing for the cost alone. I also used a tawny port wine from Costco. The sauce was sweet and weird. I love red wine, shallots and bacon so I thought the flavors would be great, but my guests weren’t impressed. I took the advice of others and blended the shallots, wine, broth and bacon.

This recipe is fantastic. I don’t eat grains, so I boiled the port wine and beef broth for 30 minutes and added 1/4 cup of cold beef broth with a heaping teaspoon of arrowroot powder whisked in. Then added the shallots and bacon. Came out absolutely delicious.

Excellent. The only change I made was to double the gravy. I froze the leftover gravy and the next time I made the roast the gravy was ready. I did add one can of beef broth while roast was cooking then once done, added the thawed gravy. Just as good as the first time

I made this roast in the crockpot, but tried to keep the privy recipe as intact as possible.  I browned the roast in the bacon grease, but waited to add the bacon (& toasted shallots) just before serving.  I didn’t cook down the sauce, to make sure there was enough to cover the meat in the crockpot.  I made a couple of substitutions based on what I had available, such as red cooking wine for port, and chicken broth for beef broth.  I think I will use beef broth the next time, to ensure better flavor. (I think I would not have had to add extra salt/pepper if I had used the correct broth.) I also added some chopped onions to the bottom of the crockpot to give the meat good flavor while it cooked.  I added cut up potatoes and carrots to cook with the meat in the crockpot.  Even with all these changes, it came out really well!

This was excellent! I made bacon the day before for breakfast, so I just put aside a few slices and chopped them, and saved some bacon drippings. I heated the drippings in a heavy pan, seared the roast, removed the excess drippings and put the pan in the oven to finish cooking. I started the gravy earlier by roasting the shallots and cooking down the port/broth. I didn't make a paste with the flour and butter, I made one roux with flour and butter and one with rice flour and butter, and split the broth/port/pan juices between the two. They both came out great, so the rice flour is a very good option for g/f folks! (Just watch the broth ingredients!!) We paired it with Chef John's Fondant Potato recipe and some roasted asparagus with parmesan. It was an impressive meal!

Excellent recipe. Roasted a 5 lb tenderloin until internal temp was 130 degrees, rested it, then sliced a nice medium rare result. Gravy delicious, made most of it ahead of time, as recommended, blended with hand immersion blender, saved bacon grease dor

This is a 5 star recipe. I did not end up having any juice from cooking the beef to add to the broth mixture and it still was amazingly delicious. I put the roasted shallots in a food processor but left the bacon as crumbles (and I used an entire pound of bacon). I used a larger cut of beef tenderloin so, just use a thermometer to check until desired temp is reached. You will not be disappointed with this!

The sauce is so Delicious!! I used a cheaper piece of meat to try it before I buy a $25/lb tenderloin! It was so great! I blended all the sauce ingredients for the smooth gravy. It was thoroughly enjoyed! I will be making just the sauce for Christmas to use over my garlic and chive mashed potatoes!

I put all the ingredients into a Dutch pot and out in the oven. Everything was juicy and tender. I also added a pot roast seasoning to the broth and wine mixture. Everything came out perfect.

It was delicious! So tender and juicy, with so much flavor. My friends commented on how good it was, and the portions were surprisingly correct! I paired it with a nice Barefoot Merlot, and it turned out very well.

I absolutely loved this! The recipe was awesome. I did make some changes based off of many other reviews by using a regular red wine instead of the port. I used a cab. I also blended the broth wine mixture when it was finished with the roasted shallots and bacon. Omg it was heaven. I wanted this instead of a special occasion dinner, just a nice dinner with the hubby, so I got two nice filets. the bake time is shorter but used the same amount of sauce for our mashed potatoes. I'm not going to cook filet any other way now. I served it with Parmesan baked asparagus and the mashed potato recipe from epicurious.  Who knew that a potato ricer made such fluffy potatoes? One of the best dinners I've made. Next time, I'll probably make the sauce the night before just to make it easier though

Delicious! The local grocery store did not have a beef tenderloin roast, so I made it with flat iron steaks, and it was awesome! The sauce was so tasty! Will be making this again soon!

The wine/Shallot sauce was amazing.  I didn't have port, so I used cabernet sauvignon.  Outstanding!  My girlfriend wanted to have the leftovers for dinner the next day.  Needless to say, I will make this again, soon!

The very first time I have left a note to give feedback on a recipe.  My husband loved it! I served it with the roasted vegetables recipe also from this site and the only thing I did differently is to use potatoes tomatoes carrots and onions for the vegetables along with a tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce.  Otherwise I was faithful to both recipes although I did put the sauce for the steaks through the blender like other readers suggested and it turned out beautifully!  I made 4 large tenderloins so we are going to be able to eat this for three nights!  Thank you very much!  This will be what we serve when we have company!

I used red wine instead of port and less shallots. It was really good! I think next time I will add quite a bit of pepper to spice it up a bit. The gravy is super, though!

Oh my...the shallot sauce is SO DELICIOUS.  It is on the sweet side, very aromatic, and was very popular at my Christmas dinner table.  I followed the preparation instructions for the tenderloin including browning in bacon fat - but used fresh thyme and lowered the oven temp to  350F because I am a fan of low and slow.  I used an electric leave-in thermometer and removed the roast once it reached 125F, then let it rest.  It was rare to medium rare.  It was an expensive meal because I used Prime grade tenderloin, but I liked it better than prime rib and will definitely make it again for a special occasion.

Fixed this fabulous recipe for our family (15 people counting the kids) Christmas Dinner. It was fabulous. My wife wondered if I was messing up a good filet but in the end she liked the sauce. Added twice-baked loaded potatoes, green bean casserole and hot rolls to the meal and it was superb! We barely had room for the peanut butter pie.

This was a fantastic recipe!  Seems like the sauce is hard but once you do it once it is really not that bad.  I made a 5lb tenderloin (for Christmas) and I tripled the sauce...I had PLENTY of sauce so I would only double the sauce next time...I also made the broth/wine sauce the day before and roasted my shallots the day before too.  I followed some of the recs of former reviewers and blended about 1/3 of the shallots into my sauce to help thicken it...but I wanted to keep some shallots as well to put on top of the meat...this was a perfect compromise.  The one thing that I felt this recipe failed to address was to make sure you tie up the tenderloin so that it roasts evenly.  I watched a couple of short youtube videos on how to do this and it was easy.  Also, in case you buy a tenderloin that is not peeled and you have never done a tenderloin before make sure you watch a youtube video on how to peel and trim the tenderloin...if you were like me I didn't know that there was a silver skin on it..  other than that I think this recipe is fantastic...everyone loved it.  I fed 8 adults and 3 kids with 5lbs of meat and there was probably about 1.5 servings leftovers...so it was just about perfect.  I also did some research on how to properly cook a tenderloin--this site helped me...http://www.thekitchn.com/5-common-mistakes-to-avoid-when-cooking-beef-tenderloin-tips-from-the-kitchn-214074

I had to roast it for about an hour to get it right...I have to admit that towards the end I

I used a table red instead of port and thought it was still great. It was what I had and I'm not a big port fan. I needed a little more flour than called for to get the right thickness of the broth, but I also added mushrooms to the broth so that probably added some moisture. Not sure 125 is med rare according to other meat sites, I cooked to 140 and it was a lovely med rare. Delish, I will make again!

This was great! I used onions instead of shallots because I could not find shallots at my local store. I also used chuck tender roasts, 2 of them, because they were cheaper & all my store had on hand also. (It was the week of Christmas!) I took the advise of others & doubled the sauce/gravy. I roasted the onions the night before and let the wine and broth reduce while the roast was cooking. From there, I followed the directions & it was fantastic! I am so glad I doubled the sauce/gravy, we used it on the garlic mashed potatoes I made to go with it. I had enough gravy left over to freeze & use for something like hamburger steak later. This gravy would be good on just about any beef dish and it is easy to make, even if it is a little time consuming. I will most certainly make this again!

Will definitely make this again.  I made use of the reviews about making the sauce ahead of time. Used Cabernet vs port wine and did not add brown sugar. To thicken the sauce I used cornstarch mixed with water and stirred the paste lime mixture into the boiling sauce. It thickened up quickly.  Delicious and we have plenty of sauce:  found no need to double the recipe.  I had a 3.5 pound of meat and cooked it for about 45 minutes for medium doneness.   I think the amount of time  for the roast depends on how thick the meat is and if the meat is the same thickness across the length of beef.   Part of our roast was thicker was medium rare when I took it out of the oven, which I didn't want, but it continued cooking out of the oven  while I mashed garlic potatoes so in the end was just the way we wanted it.  Medium doneness throughout. Very tender.

I will definitely make this dish again! I made it for our Christmas dinner and everyone (including the kids) really enjoyed this. I did end up having to re-do the sauce for the shallots because I boiled it way too long and burned it. The next time I made it, I didn't boil it and instead just had it on a higher setting of heat for a bit longer, and then let it sit to thicken. Overall, great dish. I followed exactly as the recipe requires and used 2lbs of filet mignon.

This review is only for the Shallot Sauce.  I made it as written. No substitutions.  It was okay but I had high expectations and was disappointed. I threw away the leftovers.  I won't be making this again.

Outstanding Sauce. Well worth the effort.

I used a Malbec wine instead of port. It was excellent and we severed the Malbec with the dinner and it went together very well.

This is a knockout recipe with a couple of minor changes. Like others I used a good Cabernet with some brown sugar in place of the port.  I quartered some baby bella mushrooms and roasted them with the shallots.  I cooked the roux instead of using a raw one - personal preference about the taste of flour in a sauce. I also doubled the sauce as it is so tasty and is a great complement to any starch you choose to serve with this.  As others have said,  you can do the sauce and the shallots the day before to make your preparation time shorter and easier - particularly if you are doing this for a holiday meal.  Everyone I've ever served this to has raved about it and it's an often requested meal for special occasions.  Buy a piece of meat that's bigger than what you think you need - you'll want a little leftover to savor the next day.

My picky fiance had very little negatives to say, he disliked the texture of the bacon and shallots but said if I pureed it he would use it as a sauce on everything. I also used a blade roast instead, which was a little less tender but still delicious.

Delicious! Entirely dependent on the quality of your meat, of course (we were fortunate enough to have an excellent cut); but the sauce was great. I perhaps let it thicken too much, as it was more of a paste than a sauce, but the flavor was excellent nonetheless!  I also would have slices the shallots smaller. The shallots we have in France are very large, and I would have preferred to have smaller pieces.

FABULOUS. Just a note of caution on this review, though: I prepared the beef slightly different, doing a partial brine.  I also finished the shallot sauce with butter (like any great sauce should be!) This is going to be one of my best "company" recipes. Everyone raved about it.

I've made this about a dozen times now, because it is a family favorite. The only changes I've made is that I use an entire small can of tomato paste in the sauce and I use a burgundy wine instead of port. Gives it a rich, homemade steak sauce flavor that we really love here.

I made this recipe and added mushrooms bc my boyfriend loves those things, and packed it up for lunch with sweet potatoes and asparagus. We thought this was ok....but we prefer the meat cooked in the sauce instead of having the sauce poured over it.

The flavor of this sauce was amazing. Filled the house with an incredible aroma. I changed a few things. I used a good Pinot Noir instead of Port (to sweet for me). I also roasted 3 cloves of garlic then diced them and added them to the sauce. Finally, I crumbled the bacon on top of the steaks after topping with sauce, added a nice crunch.

Excellent recipe!  I made it for Easter dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I had a 2 1/2 pound tenderloin and baked it for 35 minutes.  It was so tender.  The sauce does take some time to prepare.  I probably didn't allow enough time for the beef broth and port to reduce by half, as a result I should have added more flour or corn starch to thicken it up.  It was still delicious!

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it was D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S and literally plate licking good. Worthy of a special occasion. Some reviews were negative about the sauce. If you like red wine you will love the sauce, as I did. Easy to make, takes some time, but well worth the effort and time. I can't make this recipe again soon enough.

though my tenderloin came out perfectly moist and amazing the sauce left me with a feeling that something was missing. It just didn't have the zip and spice i was hoping for. Its a good base to start from but next time i will add to it.

Wow!  I used Angus pride tenderloin grilling steak. I followed the recipe exactly and I used MANISCHEWRITZ Concorde red wine.  I blended the roasted onions and bacon bits as suggested. Makes a perfect amount of sauce. It tastes like restaurant quality gourmet steak with succulent gravy.  I added my own roasted potato side dish.  I made this for my husband's birthday! The whole family loved it! It is saved now as permanent status in my recipe box!

I made this as a random dinner for my boyfriend and I; it doesn't have to be a special occasion meal. Followed the directions but used fresh instead of dried herbs and doubled the amount of bacon. I also served the shallots  and bacon on the side.

Used the  reduced sodium beef broth,blended the  shallots and bacon and broth mixture in the cusinart ahead of time.  Was a lot of preparation, but was so good. Cooked mushrooms separate for josh, justin and myself and added on top of tenderloin. Made Christmas 2015,  The boys gobbled it up and said the best Christmas dinner so far!!

This meal was a big hit. Timing was not an issue as my guests like to watch me cook. I prepared ahead the shallots, crisped the bacon, reduced the port wine /beef stock mixture and placed aside. My 4lb tenderloin was seasoned and browned and ready for the oven.My guests arrived and just 35 minutes later we were seated and served.  Everyone raved, "it was the best tenderloin I ever had". My guests requested it again for next years holiday meal. There were no leftovers so next year I may double the recipe.

Awesome. Substituted onions and 2 cloves of garlic for the shallots (grocery store was out)  and I was still getting rave reviews.  So great. Thank you!

We made this for Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit. We followed the exact recipe. We got a 5 1/2 lb tenderloin and had 7 adults and 9 kids. We had a ton left over, so we'll get to enjoy leftovers. I prepared the shallots and the sauce in the morning of Christmas Eve, so I wouldn't have to cook to much when my guest arrived.  I finished the sauce while the meat was resting and cooked roasted some asparagus as a side dish. I also served this with crockpot potatoes . I highly recommend this recipe for a special dinner for a crowd.

Delicious, quick, and fairly easy.  I was too afraid to pull the roast out of the oven when the temp reached 125, so I let it stay in too long.  Next time I will stick to the plan and pull it out at 125 for medium rare.  The sauce is the real star.  I used an emulsion blender to make the sauce smooth before serving.  Everyone was very impressed.

My husband loves red meat and bacon and I wanted to impress him so gave this recipe a try.  He loved it and said its right up there with Chicken Fried Chicken (another recipe from this site that is much simpler!).  I puréed the sauce which thickens it nicely  so didn't bother with flour.  I also used red wine instead of sherry.  I cooked for 25 min.  Thanks!!

I added a bit of concentrating beef flavoring (natural) and it really made the sauce "POP".  Was an absolutely great flavor addition to the tenderloin.  I will definitely make it again!

I have made this several times now.  I follow the recipe exactly except I used a Shiraz instead of Port. I couldn't find a Port wine and I read that a good substitute was a Shiraz, Chianti or Merlot.  My family loves it and it turns out perfect every time.

This recipe is probably one of the best things I have ever made and I cook a lot.  Delicious.  I made it for Christmas dinner and it got rave reviews from everyone.  I had a 4 1/2 lb. roast and it took about 45 minutes to get to medium rare.  I took the advice of other reviewers and put the bacon and shallots into the beef broth/port wine sauce and used my immersion  blender to make a smooth gravy.  Even the kids loved it.  This one will be a permanent fixture  in my holiday meals!!

I tried this recipe because of all the good reviews.  I have never made beef tenderloin before.  I made this for Christmas dinner and it was awesome!!  The sauce in itself was AMAZING!!  I would make that sauce for any beef dish!!  It was really good.  I didn't double it and I had plenty.  This is definitely a go to recipe if you need a fancy beef dish!  Highly recommended!!

Really good flavor. I had no idea what shallots were before this recipe. I'll definitely use them in the future! I accidentally used too much tomato paste, but the sauce was still pretty good. I used filet mignon because that was the closest thing I could find. The recipe could use more bacon.

This was FANTASTIC!!!! I made this for hubby for Valentine's day and since it was only 2 of us and the roast cost $45 I picked out some nice steaks instead. But everything else I followed exactly as written. I made garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus as my sides. Hubby said it was better then a 5 star restaurant. I didn't blend up the shallots and bacon because I knew my husband and I wouldn't mind the chunks in the gravy.. OMG this gravy was incredible, specially over the potatoes! I didn't even know what a shallot was till this recipe but it MADE the dish! DON'T LEAVE THEM OUT!!! I took the suggestions to make a few things ahead of time like cook the bacon and make the shallots wine sauce the day before and it just made dinner super easy to prepare for our special dinner. I will someday spend the money on the roast but even on nice steaks this was amazing! Thank you for making my Valentine's Day extra special!

I made this for multiple years for Christmas dinner.  It's so true what other people are saying...You really can cut the meat with a fork or butter knife.  It is so tender!  The flavor of the gravy is the best part!  I served this with a tossed salad, roasted carrots, fresh bread and loaded baked potatoes.  My family loves this recipe!  We had it last night and they are still talking about how tender the meat was and it makes the best sandwiches the next day if you are lucky enough to have leftovers!!

This will be the 3rd or 4th Christmas that I'm making this.  It is amazing.  I make the sauce the day before, use the blender as others have said.  Any leftover gravy is frozen and mixed into ground meat for burgers later in the year.  Truly our "meal of the year" each year.

This is a wonderful dish. Rich, delicious, and tender. We absolutely love it. Take time, as others said, to prepare the shallots and sauce before hand to save on stress so you can have time with guests/family,and not stuck in the kitchen.

Oh my! Absolutely a winner! I went by the recipe exactly except for cooking it longer as my chunk of tenderloin was closer to four pounds. I believe I can change my expertise to Gourmet Chef with this recipe! I've never cooked with shallots before... sweet and was perfect in this gravy topping! DO try it as the recipe says first... then alter the recipe to suit yourself!

The tenderlion turned out perfect. We have an oven probe that we set to mediam rare and it took the meat to 140 degrees and cooked it for about 30 minutes. It was a perfect mediam rare with the center more pink and the outside a little more mediam.  My guests were raving about the dish all night and comparing it to a 5 star restaurant. I will make it again for special events. The meat I bought was from a very expensive butcher at $20 a lbs... But so worth it, it melted in your mouth. I doubled the recipe to have enough for 7 hungry guests. I ended up buying two 2 lbs center cut tenderlion roasts and had extra for breakfast the next day.

Huge fan of this recipe. I don't normally cook beef or meat, and this one was neither intimidating nor overly difficult. Perfect flavors! This has been a huge hit at dinner parties.

I had to make this more budget friendly since the beef tenderloin roast was going for over $16 a pound, so I tried this same recipe just with pork tenderloin which was only $6/lb.  I made this for my husband and I, the gravy is amazing (and I saved half of it for the next time I make it).  This is a great recipe, and if the pork tenderloin was that tender and soft and delicious I can't imagine how much beef tenderloin would blow your mind.  Thanks for the recipe!

As our chef Dad could not be with us this Christmas (and he always does the cooking!), I thought I'd try my best to imitate his port wine sauce. We just finished finished Christmas dinner with rave reviews...one of our best... right up there with Dad's.  Great recipe will definitely do again!

This was amazing.  Would add some mushrooms to the shallots; doubled the sauce for our 7# piece of meat.  Very tender meat and delicious sauce.  Made with mash potatoes.

I served this at an engagement dinner and it was just delicious! I made the port sauce, roasted the shallots and cooked the bacon (saving some of the grease) 2 days before. I also mixed the flour and butter to have ready and another cup with the additional butter. That made it sooo easy to prepare. I believe I will make this again for Christmas as there were no leftovers!!! Thank you! Great recipe!

This recipe is well worth the raves!  Although I'm a pretty good cook, gravy always terrified me.  This is by far the best I've ever made!  Instead of all purpose flour, I used Wondra...and voila...no lumps in my gravy!!  Not only did my family enjoy the dinner, they came back for the leftovers the next night!

Absolutely delicious.  Everyone from the Hubby to my three sons loved it.  I used a three pounder and we like ours almost rare in the center so adjusted my cooking time a bit.  I added some gorgonzola butter (recipe on this site) to the top of the individual servings and then topped with the shallots sauce and it was a HUGE hit!

I made this for my dad for Father's Day... AMAZING! Everyone loved it. The sauce does take time but is definately worth the work (fun to prepare too, if you enjoy cooking). I made it with scalloped potatoes and fresh green beans. Make this meal if you want to impress!

Delicious! I used a meat thermometer and cooked to about 135 internal temperature which took about 45 minutes for a 2.4 pound tenderloin and it was perfectly medium-rare. The shallots that were available looked a little too big, so I used pearl onions instead and they were delicious! Overall, great dish and very easy to cook.

This was delish!!  My husband isn't a fan of sauces but he really enjoyed this!  I went a tad bit overboard with the wine and the sweetness really comes through - so if you're a beginner like me, watch the wine!  haha  But this was really good, I cut out the bacon since we didn't have any handy and it was still juicy and tasty.  It smelled soooooo good as I was making it!  Def make again!!

Excellent recipe for entertaining.  The sauce is much better if it is blended and I doubled to tomato paste to cut some for the flavor from the shallot/bacon.

SOOO DELICIOUS. I made this twice! I didn't have port wine so I used the red that we were drinking with dinner and added a little brown sugar to it. Besides that, I didn't change anything the first time except pulling it out a little early (we like our meat medium rare). The second time I actually made the sauce and blended it with the shallots as many reviewers suggested. I didn't bled all the shallots, though because I wanted to eat some whole as well. This was very good and I froze the leftover sauce and have used it since.

How can you go wrong with beef tenderloin?  It was a lot of work making the shallot sauce, but it paid off and was totally delicious!  I'll probably make this again (especially since I still have about 5 lbs of tenderloin in the freezer), but it's definitely a special occasion dish to me, since the prep time is so long.    Fortunately, special occasions can be manufactured at will!  Try this, you will like it!

I have made roast tendeerloin for special occasion dinners many times, but when I came across this recipe, I just had to try it.  All I can say is : incredible!  I did not have shallots, so I substituted with small yellow onions, cut into big chunks.  I also used a good red wine (merlot) instead of the port wine.  The sauce was so incredibly tasty - my whole family loved it.  I served the tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes, peas and sauteed fresh spinach.  I will make this dish again many, many times for sure.   Note:  I did find the cooking time a bit short  (having made tenderloin so many times, I had an idea of how long to cook it).  I used a 3lb piece and it took 45 minutes for medium/med rare being the end pieces will be medium and the center med/rare.

This is a terrific recipe!  I've made it for Christmas dinner three years running now and everyone can't wait for dinner to be served.  The men love it as well and the ladies.  It's not an inexpensive meal to make, but the cost is well worth it and it makes for great leftovers. Serve with double baked potatoes, veggies and rolls.  Yum!

This recipe was delicious. The gravy sauce is what made the dish. I used what was on hand which was a pork tenderloin instead of beef. I was also craving brussels sprouts so I roasted them alongside the shallots and added them into the gravy sauce at the end as well. I did not have port in the house so I used a Malbec red wine and added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar to sweeten it up. For someone who is not comfortable with cooking meats, this is a really fantastic recipe with an end result of a fancy dish with not a lot of work. Can't wait to make this again!

Worthy of Christmas dinner. The smell of the beef and the sauce had everyone hanging in the kitchen. Plenty of sauce leftover, but unfortunately the beef was gone. Prefer my beef sliced slightly thinner than .5 inch slices but this works thick or thin. Incredibly tender.

This recipe is an absolute winner.  The gravy is so flavorful and rich tasting.  Everytime I have served it (for Christmas Dinner) - everyone wants the recipe.  I browned the beef on both sides in the bacon grease (reserved from cooking the bacon a day earlier).  My boyfriend thought I was nuts until he tasted the tenderlion.  Thanks Christine for sharing this fabulous recipe.

Awesome recipe. I have made this about a dozen times and it is always good. I usually make it just using beef tenderloin steaks and super good. Just brown the steaks with the seasoning and finish in the oven to desired doneness. Recipe does sound difficult when you first read it and it does dirty a lot of pots and pans, but not difficult and dishes are 100% worth it. I have a picky British husband and he requests this meal at least once a week!

I made this Dinner for my Girlfriend for New Years Eve 2009 to 2010. It went over very well, she loved it and so did I. I will definitely make it again. I served wish mashed potatoes, and instead of watercress for garnish, I ended up using parsley (Couldn't find watercress at any of the grocery stores I went to.) It looked great and tasted even better. Great Recipe!!

Thanks to the previous posts!  This was a huge success for a dinner party last night.  It does take more than a 15 minute prep - or maybe I am just slow!  :-)   I did not have port so used red wine plus brown sugar suggested in a previous post.   This will definitely be made againg - will double or triple the sauce volume though!

This made an elegant Christmas dinner for friends.  I was concerned about the bacon because I usually don't like bacon flavored dishes but in this case it was great.  No one knew I had used the bacon but it added depth of flavor to the sauce. My shallots were large so I left them whole and served them on the side. Everyone cleaned their plates.

Fantastic!!  I just made this for New Year's and it was a real hit.  I accidentally bought maple bacon, but used it anyway and it was great.  I also did the same as another reviewer and used a cabernet with a little brown sugar instead of port.  I would definitely make this again, and all my guests would agree.

I made this for Christmas dinner.  For the price of the meal, I thought this was not worth it.  It was just ok and not something I would have remembered if someone else had made it.  The leftovers tasted better than the day I made it...maybe because the beef soaked in the sauce.  Don't think I will make this one again.

Made this for Christmas. Great recipe. The sauce was delic! Also wonderful because of the short baking time. was able to bake apps and side dishes before while baking beef. I'm going to use less shallots. Just too many for family taste

Prepared this for Christmas dinner and was very happy with the outcome.  Yummm!  However, the 25 minutes cooking time yielded a rare meat, which was perfect for some.  As for me, I put in back in the oven for a little longer for medium.  The recipe was easy to follow and impressive to serve.

This was wonderful.  I give it 4 stars instead of five only because the Port was too sweet.  A good chianti would be much better.

This recipe was a hit for X mas.  I cooked a 8 lb Ribeye choice cut with no bone.  Prepared the sauce the night before and pureed it.  The next day I sliced the meat inserting fresh garlic and drizzled the sauce right over it.  The sauce after was a easy.. I didnt follow the sauce to a T. I did it as follows 1. bring the drippings to a boil , slowly sift in flour.. stir with a fork to avoid lumps ... 2. Make sure all the oils are soaked up in the flour mixture(it will look like cookie dough)  Then slowly add in the beef broth(i like my gravy to be on the thinner side so i used abt 2 cups of beef broth) 3. I used 1 cup of apple sauce and that was it. ..  Everyone loved it....

I made this for our Christmas dinner and it was terrific.  Tasted like restaurant-quality!  I didn't think the sauce was too much effort.  My husband bought filets instead tenderloin and I sliced them on the diagonal for the platter.  Spooned sauce over the slices, served smashed potatoes and oven-roasted asparagus.  It was really phenomenal.  Will do this again for special occasion meals!

outstanding, I made this on Christmas day with oven roasted potatoes and sauteed string beans and it was amazing. I also added some mushrooms into the gravy with the shallots and bacon. I can wait to polish off the leftovers. Thank you for sharing.

This was the best Tenderloin I've ever made. It was more preparation than I typically look for in a recipe but it was worth it!  Searing the meat in bacon drippings = Yumm.

Possibly the best recipe I've gotten from this site! Really impressively delicious.   Doubled the recipe, except used a larger tenderloin a little over 6 lbs. Still plenty of sauce , I can't rave enough at how great this was!!!!

I made this about twice now and every time the meat came out so juicy and succulent - and I don't even like meat that much!  I used a blender on the shallots, bacon and sauce.  It was good, but it was a little too wine-y for my taste, so I might reduce the port next time or just go with a simple gravy.  However, the meat part of this recipe will DEFINITELY be my go-to recipe for beef tenderloin.  This 2-lb tenderloin was supposed to feed 6, but my fiance and I gobbled all up with just the tiniest bit leftover for his lunch the next day. :):):)  I can't wait to start making this for guests!

I am not good at cooking meat, but I followed the directions and it turned out wonderful!!  I too blended the sauce at the end to get a smooth consistency and have about 2 cups leftover.  It was a little thick, I may shorten the sauce's reducing time in the future. I cooked it about 35 min. because the kids wont eat rare.  It was perfectly medium.  My husband LOVED it, the meat was so tender we hardly needed a knife.  The only thing I didnt expect was for this cut of meat to be so expensive but its great for a special occasion.  I cant wait to make it again!

Following the directions to a T, everything came out wonderfully.  My only grip about the recipe as written is that the sauce was a bit too thick.  Making the reduction on the stove for 30 minutes will produce a thick sauce, I would highly recommend only reducing it by 25 minutes or so.  What also bothered me is that my steak came out medium well after being in the oven for only 20 minutes.  I would definitely only bake it in the oven for 15 minutes or so.  Other than that, the flavor was fantastic.  I would possibly add some mushrooms the next time I make this. YUM!

Made this for my mother-in-law last night.  Would not change a thing.  Couldn't find beef tenderloin, but I used beef eye roast (maybe that's the same thing?)from Costco. Loved every bite!  Thanks for a fantastic keeper!

DO believe the hype and DO try this recipe! Like the description says, this is something you can serve to guests and they will be impressed. It tastes like somthing that would be served in an upscale (read: expensive) restaurant. The thyme adds just the right amount of savory flavor to the meat to balance out the sweet, tangy shallot sauce- really just a PERFECT combination of flavors. I did have a few issues with it though, but it was probably me... My sauce came out quite salty, maybe because I used beef Better Than Bouillon + h20 for the broth part. Next time, I'll make it with less or use a low-sodium base. Also, I only ended up with about 2 drops of pan drippings (?), so I just added about 3/4C h2o in place of it, which was just fine since there was so much flavor in the reduction already.  My only real complaint is how many dishes it uses to prepare! I tried to streamline and re-use them where I could, but by the end of it all, I still had a full sink (to match my full belly!). Make sure to take note of the time required for this as well- NOT something to make on a work/school night, but made an incredible Sunday dinner.

Unfortutely, I think I am in the minority...I though this was a good recipe, but not great. I loved the sauce, but thought it was too think. I thought that with the exception of the bacon flavor in the sauce, the bacon could be omitted. I also thought the shallots could have been omitted as well. I made the recipe as written, but will make this recipe again and puree the sauce with the bacon and shallots to see if this would marke it better. I did add red potatoes to the roasting pan and they can out great.

This made Valentine's day dinner a complete success, great sauce (which I doubled just in case and ended up with way too much). Go exactly by the recipe, it's perfect.

Served for x-mas dinner and I use my meat thermometer to determine the baking time.  The roasted shallot sauce was wonderful.  I will look for a less expensive cut of meat next time.

This was amazing. The sauce is delicious, and would go well over any cut of beef. I would double the sauce recipe next time- there wasn't enough of it! I only had two strips of bacon, and it turned out fine. I also used only 1.5 tbs butter, not the whole 3 tbs, and this didn't seem to affect the overall flavor either. The thyme/salt/pepper rub gave a really nice taste to the beef- really tender! This is a favorite.

This was great!  I used Moose tenderloin and because of our remote location had no shallots, used onions instead.  I also added mushrooms.  It was delicious.

I made this dish for New Year's Eve dinner. It was a hit. My 11 year olds went for second. I served with roasted potatoes with olive oil, salt and pepper with the side of saute' asparagus. It probably will be our tradition New Year's Eve dinner from now. We all love it!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was absolutely delicious.  I was very torn about whether or not to put the sauce in the blender, as there were so many people who recommended each way.  I decided to make it exactly as the recipe says and I was not sorry.  I am sure, though, that the sauce would be wonderful blended, as well.  I don't think you can really mess up something so fundamentally good.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good - made it for New Year's Eve dinner for a crew of 12. Made with a rice pilaf as one of the other reviewers suggested.
Also made the Alaskan Baked Salmon w/ Pecan Crunch topping and that got RAVE reviews. Anyway, I did keep the extra sauce and ended up using as part of the base for a vegetable beef soup (with the leftover meat) and that was delicious.

Tried this recipe on New Years Eve and it was Awesome! I followed the recipe exactly as written except for the bacon and the sauce was very good. We had purchased a beef tenderloin from Costco that was larger than we needed and we cut the remaining amount into filets. Next time I will cut into two to three roasts since we loved how easy the meat was to cook and how tender and beautiful it turned out.

This was my first time making a beef tenderloin.  It was so good, my husband would like to add it to our normal routine.  The instructions were a little difficult to follow, I had to reread them several times.  I loved this recipe though and will make it again.

This was so good. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding the bacon bits at the end but it was excellent anyway.  I used Ruby port also.  Definitly worth making and will make again soon.

Wow.  It was sooooo good.  I made one change to the recipe.  I used sherry cooking wine instead of port for price and availability reasons.  The meat was sooo tender and the sauce was awesome.  I will make this one again and again.

I made this for Christmas dinner yesterday.  My guests liked and so did my husband.  The beef was amazingly tender, but the roasted shallots and the sauce lacked something.  I followed the recipe exactly and based on previous reviewers advice, doubled the sauce recipe. I thought it was rather labor intensive for the result.  I served it with the Garlic Mashed Red Potatoes from this web site (which rates 5 stars in my opinion) as well as my favorite Green Beans with French Herbs side dish.

I have made filet on the stovetop/oven before, and I think this recipe was good on that end.  But the sauce was time consuming, and it didn't end up being worth it.  It was good, but not wow.  I've had better feedback using a boiled balsamic/sugar syrup with blue cheese melted on top - which took a lot less effort.  All in all, a good recipe, but there are others that are easier and uses less ingredients, and give even better results. :-)

I have never cooked a beef tenderloin before and was scared to death that I was going to ruin an expensive piece of meat!  It turned out great!  The sauce is superb! 

I was confused about the cooking temp.  The recipe says 375 for the shallots, then doesn't exactly specify that same temp for the meat.  I thought that was too hot for the meat and turned it down to 325 for about 50 minutes for an internal temp of 135.

FYI:  Never having used port wine before, I learned, at least in my neighborhood, it has to be purchased at a liquor store.  Publix will not have it!

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!   I MADE IT FOR OUR CHRISTMAS DINNER-AND EVERYONE LOVED IT!  (MY 4 KIDS RANGE IN AGE FROM 10-20).  I WAS WORRIED ABOUT USING THE PORT WINE (WHICH I USED A TAWNY PORT)-BUT AFTER IT WAS REDUCED AND ADDED TO THE DRIPPINGS IT WAS GREAT!   I AGREE WITH THE OTHERS-WHO HAD STATED THIS GRAVY COULD ALSO BE USED ON A LESS EXPENSIVE PIECE OF MEAT.  THIS ONE IS A KEEPER!!!

Definitely a keeper for those occasions when money is no object. Not difficult at all to do, and very tasty and tender, according to my husband and daughter. The option of making the suce ahead makes it a good choice for company dinners. I didn't puree the sauce, as the idea of pureed bacon seems not so appealing. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Tenderloin on it's own is a great roast. I cooked mine to higher internal temp. This sauce is a perfect complement.  I have made this several times and for me (inexperienced cook), the most important thing is meat thermometer.  I've tried cooking the roast with the sauce and separate and I like it separate, my dh likes both ways. The salt and thyme are a nice seasoning.

This recipe is fantastic, though I agree that you could use the sauce on less expensive cuts of beef or even pork and it would be just as good.  I pureed the sauce as many recommended, and doubled the recipe because my husband likes to cover his plate in sauce.  Our company raved about the dinner and asked for the recipe.  I served it with a green salad and roasted potatoes.  Definitely a special occasion-worthy recipe. Thanks!

Sauce was really good. I think next time I will cook the beef in the sauce so it absorbs more of the flavor.

Amazing!  My family loves this recipe; even the kids.  I added sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and served with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.  The sauce is terrific on the mashed potatoes as well.  Next time, I will try a slightly cheaper cut of meat.  I've tried similar recipes using Ribeye and that worked well but the Tenderloin was superb.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe; definitely a keeper and great for company or every day meals.

I made this tonight and my husband says hands down the best steak he's ever had. Instead of a roast I bought two small fillet minyan's. Some reviews say to blend the sauce but I decided not to. I didn't have enough shallots so I used an onion which I cut up into small pieces. I'm so glad I didn't blend the sauce because you were really able to taste everything.

The meat was tender and had a excellent flavor. I think I added to much flour, my sauce was too thick and I couldn't get it thinner. But this is a great recipe.

This recipe was really delicious. I prepared most the night before as per other reviews which helped a lot due to other foods that were being prepared.  I didn't put the reduction and shallots in a blender cause i wanted the whole shallots.  Came out delicious.  Really fantastic meal.  Guests really liked it alot.  So tender and juicy.  Made mashed potatoes on the side and it was scooped up quickly with the gravy.

REALLY GREAT!  I didn't cook as long because we like our steaks really tender (plus when you reheat leftovers you end up cooking it even more).  I added fresh mushrooms and doubled the sauce. Also I added cornstarch and cold water to make a paste then added to the sauce to thicken.  We don't care for runny sauce.

The steak was good, however. I did'nt follow the original recipe and listened to one of the people that suggested putting the sauce and bacon in a blender! Boy was I bummed! It was good, but an expensive mistake!

Wow, very tasty! Definitely good for when you have guests over for dinner, or if you're really in the mood to cook. The meat just melted in my mouth.

I am so ashamed to say that I wasn't impressed with this dish.  I prepared it for a large dinner party - for the amount of money and time that went into this dish - it didn't blow me away, and my guests agreed.  The meat was fabulously tender and scrumptious, but the shallot sauce was just ok... kind of blah.  Either the meat needed a more intense sauce or the sauce needs to be jazzed up a little.  Kind of tasted like a boring brown gravy.  I doubt I'll be making this again, but I may use pieces of it and try to fashion my own version.  Sorry.

Way late on this review.  Made this for Christmas dinner and the end result was nothing short of amazing. The only side not was instead of serving right away, I doubled the sauce and put the meat into a Nesco and let simmer @ 200'F for 2hrs and talk about melting in your mouth. What can I say, other than NO LEFT OVERS.  Will definitely make this again and lastly, I followed the recipe exactly.

i made this for a little intimate christmas dinner with my friends. i increased the recipe and used 2.5k of beef.

ive never roasted anything meaty before, and as a first timer in this, it was so easy! the sauce was great. i didn't need to thicken it by blending, only with a little roux. the bacon chunks was definitely a plus in the sauce.  i added mushrooms too, which was great.  do not blender the sauce! the shallots browned is great by itself.

the time alloted in the recipe made it too rare, so i cooked it until it was 150 C in the center then immediately let it cool to reabsorb the juices.  the only problem i encountered when serving it was  cutting the roast into slices, which i have never done before.  the first few attempts made it fall into strips. but that's not really relative to the recipe.

This is a wonderful tenderloin recipe!  I prepared this for Christmas along with a turkey and a pork tenderloin and it was the star of the meal.  This was my first time cooking a beef tenderloin and I was slightly intimidated at first but it turned out to be quick and easy.  As others have mentioned, double the sauce, toss in mushrooms with the shallots and cook longer if you don't like it rare. And yes, you can cut it with a fork! A+

I made this for my family for Christmas dinner and absolutely loved it.  I did the shallots and bacon the day before, stored my well wrapped pan in the garage.  The meat was fantastic and extremely simple.  Will make this again!!

Great recipe.  Tired of turkey and ham, I tried this on my family for Christmas dinner.  Wonderful.  Be sure to use a meat thermometer to monitor the temp of the meat.  The shallot sauce was great.  I served with the Oven Roasted Pototoes submitted by Janet and the Green Bean Bundles.  I will definately make again.

the recipe itself is great. The dish was flawed due to my own mistakes: too much salt and growing impatient with the meat in the oven. The cut (beef sirloin) I used took much longer than this recipe called.

I rubbed the meat with a sea salt, crushed black pepper, and thyme rub some time before, which helped the flavor (but again, too much salt here and in the sauce).

Working with larger pieces of meat isn't particularly bachelor-friendly.

Wow.  Unbelievably fantastic.  I am not much of a cook but felt like giving it a go.  We just returned from a 10 day cruise where the food was GREAT---everyone agreed that this was better than anything we ate on the ship.  Also the best meal I ever made.  I realized I didn't have thyme when I needed it so I used rosemary and it was fabulous, too.  I already passed this recipe on to family to have them try it.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!

My husband can't get enough of this recipie. He isn't a huge cook outside of what he does on a daily basis. Once he tried this recipie, it was his signature main dish at dinner parties. It also is easy to plate.

Excellent recipe - the shallot sauce was great.  I didn't use the top quality filet - I used filet from Costa Rica which was less than half price.  I tenderized it by poking it with a sewing machine needle about 100 times!  The meat was so juicy - I'll make this again and again, and I'm so thrilled it doesn't cost a fortune!

This for sure is the best roast we have ever eaten. We bought the clubpack beef tenderloin at Costco and it's to die for, the meat just melts in your mouth. Expensive but worth it.

This recipe deserves all the rave reviews it's recieved. I've never baked a beef tenderloin before and it was melt in your mouth to die for....awesome recipe! I added a couple portabello mushrooms to the roasting pan with the shallots, and used reduced sodium beef broth - very good! I'm making this again tonight for a party of 9, and will be sure to double the sauce - it's the best part! Thanks for the recipe...it's a classic!

Because I only needed to make a dish for two, I used beef tenderloin strips.  The recipe was excellent, however it is difficult to compensate for the extensive labor and expense of this dish.  Because of this, I will not be serving this in heavy rotation, but it is nice for special occasions and would be wonderful for company.  This being said, I had a little problem with the consistency of the sauce...it was way too thick and I had to add extra broth.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but the taste was still very good.

Outstanding!! We used 1 pound of filet and it was plenty for four. Don't skimp on the shallots or the sauce. I do not particularly like onions or shallots, but I loved them roasted in the sauce. The meat was tender enough to cut with a spoon. Follow the instructions exactly!

This was enjoyed by my guests, but no one was ranting at how wonderful the sauce was. After all the reviews I expected a little more positive response. People said it was good, but no one said it was great. I am a vegetarian so I didn't taste it myself. The recipe said 2 lbs would feed 6 people. I had a 5 pound tenderloin and it fed 7 adults. Since our group did not like rare meat, we cooked it to 155 degrees. The narrow end was completely done, the thicker part was a light pink.

My family really likes the concept of this, but I struggled to not overcook the meat.  First time, cooked to rec temperature and meat was way overdone (could have been my thermometer, too).  Second time, pulled out early, and was better, but still more toward well-done.  The recipe really is all about the gravy, which is excellent.  I have served for Christmas and Thanksgiving, and will likely use again.

This recipe was quite good, I don't know if I'd make it again, considering the meat cost me $73!  I made the same mistake as another reviewer...I left the reduction on the stove and before the 30 minutes were up, I was left with less than a quarter of the sauce, so I had to add more broth.  Maybe because I reduced it too much, but the sauce was VERY salty.  Luckily, the meat was nice and sweet, so it cut the saltiness.  I agree with the poster that said the give time yielded a very rare roast, which did not go over well with my husband, so I had to add slices back to the oven to cook more.  Good recipe, but a little disappointed considering the hype.

I was not impressed with this recipe at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and I did not even serve it with the tenderloin.  This cut of meat is very expensive and the temperature recommended to serve was NOT medium...it was very close to rare - I had to slice it and put it back in the oven, to only serve with then cooler sides...will not make again with this sauce -

It's my first time serving beef tenderloin, and I think it must be the easiest meat to serve beautifully following this recipe.  It took only about 30-45 mins, it was perfect as we went out with friends, invited them to the home, and served dinner.  Everyone raved about the beef.  It was really good.  2 lbs of meat was gone in minutes.  Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.

Very good.  Not as complicated as it sounds at all... I didn't have port wine so used sherry wine.  It stil stasted yummy!  So I'm assuming it'd taste even better with port.  I cooked for Christmas dinner for my family and everyone was really impressed with it.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  It was excellent. Everyone raved about it.  The meat was tender and the sauce was great.  I cooked the meat to 170, since my family likes beef well-done and it was still very tender.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This was one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever made. My family loved it! At first it seemed like a lot of steps to prepare, but once I started it was easy. I will make this again!

WOW. An expensive but AMAZING meal... cook it for some very special people! Oh and I used the port wine shallot sauce just on top of some steaks one time and it was delicious, too.

Fantastic! I had never cooked with shallots before, and I am so amazed at how great this turned out. I roased a head of garlic while the shallots roased, and served the meal with some garlic mashed potatoes. YUM!

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I forgot to get bacon so I just omitted it and we really didn't miss it at all.  I also added mushrooms.  This was delicious...the beef was very expensive but very very delicious.  So tender and the sauce was fabulous!

This was delicious.  The recipe is more simple to make than the directions describe, you can easily do everything at once and have it on the table in half the time.  I also added mushrooms sauteed, quartered mushrooms and garlic.

Amazing!!!  The sauce is so wonderful - everyone kept pouring on more and more!  I used filet steaks instead of the roast and they worked perfectly!  I omitted the bacon becuase I forgot to buy it at the grocery and it was fine without it - I just used olive oil to sear the steaks.  Next time I will double the sauce!!  Thanks for a great recipe that will impress your guests every time!

Very tasty and really quite simple (but time consuming) - I've never really enjoyed beef before but this was GREAT!  It was the first time I've cooked beef as well and everyone loved!  Like another person suggested careful on the time for reduction, I was at 20 minutes and still reduced too much, but still A++!

I'm tardy in submitting my review.  I made this for Easter dinner 2005 and still remember it well.  Everyone at the table was blown away by this dish.  Very easy prep, fast cooking and amazing taste.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This dish was OUTSTANDING!  I made it for my boyfriend last night, and he said he would have paid $50 a plate for it in a gourmet restaurant.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.  It was probably the best meal I have ever made, and even one of the best I've ever eaten!

Ok. Can you say D I V I N E???? We made this for Christmas and all I can say is that the effort was well worth it. We doubled this recipe for 2 4# roasts and it came out perfectly. Everyone raved. It was delish!

Wow!  This is an EXCEPTIONAL dish!  I made this for Christmas dinner and my entire family raved.  As other reviewers noted it is labor intensive but the end result is well worth it!  The sauce is absolutely delicious and you will want to make sure you serve some sort of bread because everyone will want to sop up evey bit of it!  By far the BEST recipe I have made from this site.

Can I give this more than 5 stars??? I could eat the gravy all by itself with a spoon-it was so worth the effort. I used it on a lesser grade cut of meat and it was still absolutle fantastic. My boys couldn't stop themselves. This will definitely be a regular at our house. Thanks so much.

Definetly restaurant quality.  Thought I had all ingredients, but when I took the meat out, I did not notice and had bought pork tenderloin instead of beef tenderloin.  (duh!)  Was not sure how that was going to turn out but proceeded to make anyway.  Turned out so good and tender and the sauce was the best.  Followed directions to a "t" but added fresh mushrooms to the sauce for my husband.  Can't wait to try with beef tenderloin.  Thank you so much streetcar

This is a delicious recipe.  I agree that it turns out very gourmet sure to impress any company (or just your husband!).  I went with a different cut of meat but I think next time I will splurge and get the tenderloin.  Our meat just wasn't as tender as it could have been.  But the recipe was fantastic.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the cost of the cut of meat.

I made this for my girlfriends and it was absolutely delicious. It tasted like it came from a 5 star restaurant.  I wasn't sure if I could use a cut other than a tenderloin.  It was pretty expensive, but I went with the tenderloin and never regretted it.  You can't go wrong with this.  I did have to cook the shallots longer than stated.

i made this, and my husband and i loved it! i did use a different cut of meat, but it turned out great anyway. it took longer than suggested to cook it, but if you just jeep checking the internal temperature, it'll be perfect. the shallot sauce is well worth the little bit of work it takes to prepare it. this will make it's way into my favourites for sure!!

This was great, although a lot of work to make, and expensive with the tenderloin. We doubled the gravy & froze it for later use.

You can't beat tenderloin, but this sauce was not as good as I hoped. I found it to be a bit salty and the consistency of the sauce (lumpiness--shallots and bacon) did not make for an attractive presentation.

My mom really loved this, saying it was "excellent" and better than her own gravy.  However, I found it too salty, which she attributed to the wine, saying it was a "different flavor" rather than salty.  I don't think the taste is worth the prep time.  The bacon does wonders for the gravy though.  Thanks!

OUTRAGEOUSLY good; the sauce is amazing!  my fiance flipped for it!  One note: 125 degrees F in the center is still bloody rare!  Luckilly, I love my meat that way.  I had to cook it an additional 10 minutes to get it medium rare.  Definitely will be a repeated favorite.  I served it with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.

Delicious recipe...  The sauce is just perfect, and will probably go with any other cut of meat.  Tenderloin is definitely the best though.... very soft yet not mushy... GREAT!

FANTASTIC!!!  I added a bit more beef broth to the gravy and cooked the roast until the thermometer hit 140 degrees.  It made enough gravy for the mashed potatoes  I served along with the roast.

My husband absolutely loved the sauce that went with this but I would be careful because I felt it was a little salty.  Also, it took a little longer for the meat to finish then stated in the recipe.

WOW, my wife said this is the best recipe I have ever made.  I used an in expensive red wine for the sauce. My wife is not a huge fan of onions and she loved the shallots.   I told a group of friends that they can try this  at our house soon.

Sounds like alot of steps, but after you peel all the shallots, everything else goes quickly!  We had this for xmas eve dinner and it was fantastic!  I cooked to 120F for a perfectly rare cut.

this was so great! my husband doesnt like heavy onion taste and so i trimmed down to 1/2 lb shallots, maybe even down to 1/4 lb next time. and he likes well done instead of pinkish meat so i had to pan fry meat after sliced but it was still wonderful

this is indeed a fantastic beef/sauce recipe.  i found the sauce to not be too labor intensive, but i did it in bits and pieces all day.  i used a nice cabernet instead of port, and it was good.  a little salty due to the broth, but i'm not sure how to remedy that.  i used two three lb. tenderloins, and it was great, seared them in the bacon grease one at a time, and then transferred them to a roasting pan.  i also roasted the shallots for twice as long as the recipe indicated, i think they were much better that way - more caramelized.  it all worked out great.  the sauce was EXCELLENT. my extended family was over for dinner, and my sister is a chef, so you can imagine how we're used to eating...everyone loved it. i also think the sauce would be great with a roasted pork loin.

Ditto the extraordinary reviews and ditto the remarks about how forgiving this dish is.  Because I'm on a tight budget, I used an inexpensive cut of chuck roast and I substituted a cheap cooking wine for the port.  Further, because some of the people who ate this meal don't like highly seasoned meat, I barely seasoned the beef at all before roasting.  In spite of all of this, the finished product was amazing!

My only complaint:  The sauce was slow to thicken at the end, even after I added all the flour the recipe calls for.  Eventually I gave up, made a quick roux with the remaining 1.5 tablespoons butter and a tablespoon of flour, and added this to the sauce.  It thickened beautifully and tasted incredible.  (Leftovers the next day were equally great:  I just reheated the beef in the sauce and served over garlic mashed potatoes.)

After the modifications mentioned above, this dish was relatively cheap.  I suspect I'll make it often.  Thanks, Christine!

Everyone was right about this one...last Christmas we went all out and made the tenderloin exactly to the recipe...after that, we used a modified version that didn't take so long.  The flavor is unforgettable.  We are definitely making it again for Christmas this year (2004).

This was a very good recipe - nice flavor, and was easy to prepare.  The recipe, as stated, makes quite a lot of sauce - I kept back about 1/3 of it to use elsewhere.  I also cut the shallots from 3/4 lb to 1/2 lb.  The sauce was the crowning glory of this recipe - use a good a port.

Perfect!  I made this for a dinner party of 25 people, and I got the most rave reviews I have ever gotten.  People who were not even at the party have heard about it and asked for the recipe.  The sauce is unique and memorable, and couples perfectly with the beef, which is tender enough to eat with a spoon.

What a great recipe! I'm a fan of French food, but much prefer this to Boeuf Bourgignon. It's so easy and so delicious, I could hardly believe that I made it! The only mistake I made was not to simmer the sauce long enough at the end. I thought it had thickened sufficiently, but it was too runny when I served it. My boys still loved it. I served it with mashed potatoes and it was a dynamite combination.

This recipe was sooooo good!  I am not usually a great chef with meat but this proved that I can do it!  Recipe looks a little intimidating but once you get cooking it's a breeze!  I was very surprised at the price of the meat (since I didn't know it was filet mignon meat!) but worth every penny and everyone loved it!

Absolutely delicious! This cut of meat is expensive (about $20/pound) but WELL WORTH IT. The meat simply melts in your mouth! There's a lot of steps and it takes a long time, but all the steps are simple and easy to follow. This was a HUGE HIT with my boyfriend! His mom used to cook a roast all day and he says this is much better!

One of the best recipes that we've tried from this web-site.  The beef tenderloin was perfect and the sauce was out of this world!  We had this with mashed potatoes which seemed a perfect combination.  The only change that we would consider next time is to add more shallots.  Wonderful!

This was not hard at all!  My husband said this is the best thing I've ever made.  The sauce is delicious, just like everyone says.  I didn't have port so I used chianti and it was fabulous.  I also added some boiled red potatoes to the pan when I put the fillets in the oven, and then poured the sauce over the whole thing.

I think next time I'll add some garlic to the shallots.  I think that would have made it a 5 star recipe.

I'm glad I decided to try this recipe. It wasn't too hard, and the results were super.  Even the kids loved it.  I did add a bit more tomato paste than was called for, and I might chop the shallots more next time.  A great choice for a special dinner!  Goes well with a Pinot Noir.

This is amazing. My husband usually makes the sauces in our family, but he said I'm in charge from now on! When I was looking at the directions, they looked kind of long and complicated, but it turns out they are very easy to follow. They are presented in a very logical order so everything came together at exactly the right time. I served this with spiral noodles and drizzled some of the sauce over the noodles, they held the flavor well.

The sauce is absolutely amazing.  I used a high-quality filet mignon roast, but found that I needed close to 4 pounds to feed 6 people using 1/2 inch slices.

All you have to do is make it once and you will doubt no more.  Excellent! Everyone loved it.  This was a very easy dish to make and would be hard to mess up.  The beef is sooo tender and everyone will be fighting over the gravy.

This was really good and if you dont mind spending extra time in the kitchen once in while, - it was fun to prepare too.  I will make this again, but, I will reduce the salt content as much as possible - I dont normally add any extra salt to a recipe but I followed this one exactly - big mistake if your not a "huge" salt fan.  Over all it was very good although I had no idea that a 2 pound tenderloin was going to cost 28 dollars - I knew it would be expensive but that was more than I had thought.  Its a special occasion dinner

This is by far the best tenderloin recipe I have made.  Serve it with a bottle of 1995 Insignia and you have a meal fit for a king!

I made this for some very fussy friends and even made a larger roast, hoping for leftovers--wrong!
Everyone is still talking about the delicious sauce. Takes a bit of time to prepare, but not difficult. Most of Sauce can be made in advance to cut down on cooking time. You can trim fat level a bit by cutting out bacon & using cornstarch to thicken, but face it, this isn't a diet recipe.

I wanted to prepare a very special dinner for Christmas Eve with my husbands family.  I searched for just the right recipe and this was my ticket.  It made me look like a gourmet chef.  I was a little intimidated by all the instructions at first but just followed the steps and found it wasn't so difficult after all.  I served the sauce on the side and one of my guests asked if she could take any leftovers home!  Guess what, there wasn't any left.

I made this for our New Years Eve dinner party
Our guests loved it!  I served it with wild rice & steamed asparagus.  I used cabernet wine and made a smooth sauce by putting the shallots & bacon in the food processer.  This is a winner!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit!!  I made a 6 pound tenderloin because that was all I could find, and there was plenty of sauce left.  I used Cabernet instead of Port and added brown sugar.  I will make this again.

This recipe made the best piece of meat I've ever cooked in my life!  It was absolutely fabulous.  Roasting to 125 was a little on the rare side for me though.  Definitely company quality!

I didn't want to spend the money for Beef tenderloin so I used a pork roast and made the sauce according to the recipe.  The sauce is incredibly good, it would be great on chicken too!

Not an easy nor quick recipe to make. However, if you can get by those two aspects, this sauce is incredible and well worth the effort.  I'll try this sauce over filet mignon or pork chops the next time. Excellent recipe Christine!

This recipe is GREAT!  I was a little worried about all the steps, but once involved, it was pretty easy.   I loved the gravy/sauce.  I could eat it with just bread for dinner! I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe and will make it again for a special occasion.

Thanks for a great recipe!! I got rave reviews from die-hard beef lovers, and will keep this recipe for future dinner parties. I don't cook beef very often, so when I do it's usually bland and boring. This recipe made me look like a gourmet chef! Thanks!!

This is one of the best meals I've ever made. The meat was flavorful and extremely tender and the sauce was the crowning touch. The roasted shallots were a nice compliment to the dish and added a very nice flavor. The only change I made was to cook my beef a bit more; 125 degrees is a bit rare for us. This recipe is just the very best!

It's the sauce that makes this sooooo delicious!! I made this using 2 tenderloin steaks instead of the roast. The price for the meat is what stopped me. $35.00??!!

We really loved this recipe.  Even my 4 year old was eating with two hands.  We made it with mashed potatoes.  For kids or picky eaters, you might want to blend the sauce so there are no pieces.  The kids didn't want the chunks.  It would be excellent to serve for company but it is also great for just the family.

This recipe is wonderful.  Although the recipe takes a bit of time, it is well worth the effort.  The tenderloin and sauce just melt in your mouth.  I prepared this recipe for a birthday dinner party and everyone truly raved how spectacular it was. . . and I generally don't cook much.  So, if I can pull it off anyone can enjoy this.

This recipe was a real hit.  Comments were "delicious" "wonderful" "don't lose 
this recipe".   Rave reviews from my husband and our guests.
