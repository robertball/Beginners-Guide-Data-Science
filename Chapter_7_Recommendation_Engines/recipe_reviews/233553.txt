We serve fondue every year on Christmas Eve.  I'm experiment each year with a different recipe, because it's never been perfect, until now!  This will be our new staple.  It's delicious and easy.  We had 9 people for dinner and ate it all, so I will double or triple next year.  I served with little smokies, meatballs, French bread, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower and mushrooms.  YUMMY!!!

This is so incredibly easy to make and so delicious. I omitted the garlic salt and used cream cheese rather than Neufch√¢tel cheese. I also would recommend buying a large loaf of French bread--and make sure it's really good bread, makes the fondue even tastier.

I've been making traditional Swiss fondue for almost 30 years.  This is not as good, but then it never claimed to be. I was looking for an inexpensive fondue alternative and I found a keeper. Because Parmesan cheese is high in salt to begin with, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also used regular cream cheese as that's what I had on hand. This turned out creamy and delicious. I served it with homemade bread and granny smith apples to dip. Both were delicious in this fondue. I will be making this again.

Doubled the recipe.  Mixed it all up in the crock pot and called it good. Was a little skeptical that so few ingredients would taste good and I kept double checking that I didn't miss an ingredient, but it was my favorite at a fondue party that had 7 cheese dips to choose from. I used a focassia and a kalamata bread to dip. Super good. We also dipped meatballs, sausages, tortellini, veggies, bagels . . . You name it. Completely recommend.

Brought to a fondue party at work. Mine was the first to go.  Instead of french bread, I had meatballs to dip.

This was delicious! I read the reviews and added two cups of Parmesan and more milk to stretch it out. I'm glad I did! This was gone and there was only three of us!

Delicious! By the way isn't Neufchatel cheese just a low fat cream cheese?

It was good and my family loved it too. It reminded me of a good Alfredo sauce that would be good on pasta too.

Good, but pretty salty. Easy to make, but the amount of salt for MY taste (and I do use plenty) was a lot. It was a hit with my guests, though...

I doubled this on New Year's Eve using half Parmesan cheese  and half Asiago and it was delicious!  I kept it warm in a little slow cooker and served it with French bread and rosemary focaccia squares and little carrots.  My nephew loves Asiago cheese and he loved it.

Absolutely delicious! Followed recipe exactly and it was the easiest creamiest fondue ever ! I happened to find at my store an Italian cheese mix that had provolone parmesean fontina and asagio in it and this gave the fondue a wonderful smokey flavor!

I can see how this might be good with some additional flavor.  However, without any additions, it was bland, tasted like warm cream cheese, and lumpy.  I won't be making it again.

Really good! I used mozzarella instead of neufchatel because I couldn't find it. I also used sourdough bread and that was great too. Very yummy recipe that I would make again.

It really is very easy... But not so good, I have tried and made many fondue recipes before and this one isn't one I would recommend... Tastes just like cream cheese, needs a kick of something.. It was also kind of lumpy..

My teenage girls love this. It is requested quite often in our home. Not just from my girls but from their friends also. I use regular cream cheese and it comes out perfect every time.

Super simple, super yummy..... my picky kids loved it!  I liked the very creamy, parmesan flavor.  Next time, I might switch up the parmesan for another favorite cheese flavor, just for fun - as suggested.  But it's great as is!
