I am the author of this recipe.  The only thing I ever measure is the water and rice so I had to more or less guess on the quantities to get this recipe on paper.  I was using white vinegar and then switched to apple cider vinegar because it was on the counter.  They are both good.  I suggest you bring the peas and carrots to room temperature.

This rice was fluffy as promised. Here is what I discovered after I made this. Turmeric although good for you is very bitter. Too bitter for us in fact. I looked up how to counteract that and ended up adding an equal amount of chili powder to the rice. I'm giving it 4 stars because it is a nice rice and not the submitter's fault that we ended up not being turmeric lovers. I do think with my change I would give it 5 stars. I only had frozen peas so that's what we used. I will make this one again. Thanks for sharing Mariposa

This is our new favorite way to prepare rice!  It's so easy and flavorful!  I prepared this recipe with a few changes:  1.  I used brown rice instead of white, so I cooked it for 45 minutes; 2.  I used champagne vinegar (because that's all I had on hand) instead of apple cider vinegar; 3. I didn't add the peas/carrots.

Turmeric is a new spice to me that I was interested in using for our everyday cooking - this rice has been a hit with my family and the color is amazing. I took the advise of other reviews and only used 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and 1 teaspoon of turmeric and it was perfect for our tastes - enjoy !!

The combination of turmeric and apple cider vinegar made this very sour and bitter. I added shredded monterey jack which helped a little, but I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe was fairly simple. My family loved it! However, after reading the other reviews, I added half of the turmeric and half the amount of Apple cider vinegar. I also added some already prepared chicken breast pieces, along with onions and green peppers. It was awesome! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Used vegetable broth instead of water
Otherwise made it as is and enjoyed it
