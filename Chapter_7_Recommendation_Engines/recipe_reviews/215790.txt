Very good dish and very easy to make. I added a pinch of rosemary to the onions while cooking them though and I did not add the bacon since most of my fam is veggetarians but it still came out delish!

This is great! I added a little basil and used whole tomatoes instead of the sauce. I also used whole wheat pasta, not that it matters much, just a different texture to me.

I served this with garlic bread.

My grandmother made this without the mushrooms when I was a little girl visiting on their farm.  She called it "spaghetti red".  I encourage anyone to try it.  It is simple and very delicious.  Serve with crusty bread and a salad.

This is a nice little change from regular spaghetti. i used turkey bacon and decided to put in 1lb of turkey burger.  turned out good.
