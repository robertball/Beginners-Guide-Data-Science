These are great tasty muffins. I only put 1/2 cup of sugar in as I thought that would be plenty, and because I didn't have almond meal on hand I just did 1c white and 1c wheat flours. Look forward to trying the correct recipe when I get some almond meal next. My 5yo loves these in her lunches. Will make again.

These did not work out for me at all. They didn't rise and were soggy (impossible to get out of the pan) even though they were cooked. It was disappointing considering it is a more complicated muffin recipe. I used a stoneware muffin pan, maybe this contributed to the problem? It hasn't been a problem for other recipes (I make muffins regularly). I did add the milk and yogurt to the butter and egg mixture and mixed well before adding to the dry ingredients because the recipe as written seemed like it would be too much mixing for muffins. These muffins are also rather sweet in my opinion to be considered "healthier". I give two stars because the flavor was yummy.

This was my first time using almond meal, and probably because of the chocolate I couldn't really tell what a difference it makes!  These are good muffins, and my hubby enjoyed them.  The only thing I did different was to use semisweet chocolate chips for half of the recipe because I ran out of enough of the dark chocolate!  The chips tended to settle down at the bottom of most of the muffins, making them just a little soggy at the base.  Otherwise, these were good----and were gone quite quickly!  Thanks for the recipe!
