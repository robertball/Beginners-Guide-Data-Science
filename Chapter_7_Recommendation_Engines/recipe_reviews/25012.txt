these are absolutely great!!! I love these - I made them for a party and when I was trying it I decided to eat all of it alone.
The frosting is the best!!! Try it!!! Don`t leave anything of it out - my whole family and all our friends could`nt stop eating :D

There are excellent.  I did not make the frosting though, I thought it would be too sweet for my taste.  The bars themselves are very good and have a nice texture.  I will make these again.

Every Monday night I bring a cake or something sweet for Monday Night Football.  I was in the mood for a brownie, but decided blondies would be a more unexpected treat.  Found this recipe and gave it a shot - very easy to put together.  When I served it, the entire batch was gone within minutes and people clamored for more.   Three people asked for the recipe - and they NEVER bake....

I have tried other Blondie recipes and my family and I have always been disapppointed in them until now.I read  the other reviews before trying the recipe and was a little hesitant at first. There was no need to be, they came out wonderfully. These are moist and delicious and have a great peanut butter flavor.Perhaps the ones who said they were dry and tasteless overcooked them? These are a truly decadent cookie.I will be making them again.

A very good recipe if you're a peanut butter cup fan.  Add a little more white sugar and peanut butter if you don't plan on frosting them.  Have plenty of cold milk on hand!

These bars were really good.  I cut down on the peanut butter and added chopped roasted peanuts and chocolate chips to the batter, then sprinkled the same on top prior to baking.  I drizzled some ganache to dress them up a bit.

I don't know where I went wrong, but these turned out very dry. I am not downing the recipe because it has some really great reviews, mine just didn't make the 5 star review I was hoping for.

Not a huge fan of these. They weren't bad, but nothing special. I like peanut butter things a lot, but I didn't like the peanut butter in this. For the toothpick test to work, I had to cook them for much longer than the recipe called for, and then they were very dry.

My kid and husband liked these, but they were a little dense and too sweet for my
taste.  The frosting would have made these inedibly sweet, so I left it off.
I just kept it on the side for those with sweet tooths to put on themselves.

Oh. My. Gosh. These are incredible. I didn't have time to make the frosting, but I'm so happy I didn't because these are unbelievably decadent without it. They are exponentially better on Day 2+. Delish!!

These are ok, but I doubt I'll make them again.  The edges baked too much because the middle wasn't even close to being done.  The frosting is too much, some of the middle pieces were 1/2 blondie, 1/2 frosting...too much.  And, I'm not sure about all of the peaunt butter.  You have to really, really love peanut butter, otherwise it is too overwhelming.

My family and I really liked this.  The bar itself was delicious, though I used a different icing recipe, as I found this one too sweet and a little grainy.  I also substituted peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips.

I would rate 6 stars - if possible
this recipe is absolutely the best!!! My husband loves this one and it is not easy to impress him... besides I´m very critical! The cake itself is easy to prepare and tastes wonderful, but in combination with the frosting makes it absolutely delicious!!! 
It will melt in your mouth

VERY VERY GOOD! Just one note, the amount of icing is more than enough. You could make 1/2 as much and still have plenty. SO GOOD, my husband loved them! Thanks Erica!

It didn't really do much for me as blondies go. they were a little dry. and I felt like they were missing something. The frosting part made it taste a lot better though.

These bars were awesome!! Very moist and tons and flavor! I didn't make the frosting just because we were bringing them to a party and I wasn't sure if they would travel well with the frosting, but I guarantee I'll make them again WITH the frosting!! Delicious!!

This is my second time making these Blondies. I Love them. They will only come out dry if you over cook them. The frosting I cut in half and it was just right!:) Will keep this recipe for sure!:)

These turned out *so* good!  So moist, so delicious, and the frosting on top went perfectly with the bar.  A definite keeper recipe.

Two stars for the frosting! I was so disappointed in these! They sounded delicious, however, I cooked my 5 minutes longer than stated, and they still weren't done. I'd say they need to be cookies 35-40 minutes. I noticed other reviewers didn't have this problem though.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut the frosting in half (and trust me, save your ingredients...you only need half of what the frosting recipe calls for!!) The frosting is to die for, and I will use it for other recipes. Unfortunately I had to throw away the entire middle of my brownies and could only keep the outside edges (and even they were gooier than I like..and I like gooey brownies!)  They truly appeared done, and since they're "blond", it was hard to see on a toothpick, but they did look done. Sigh. Oh well. I won't try it again. Thanks anyway.

Terrific! I made these brownies today but I used a chocolate brownie frosting instead of the peanut butter one listed. This is a realy keeper of a recipe, and will be included in my Christmas cookie baking. An afterthought: if you decide to use chocolate frosting like I did, decoratively drizzle the peanut butter frosting over the bars.

I tried these with the frosting. The frosting is great, however the blondies are dry and dense, not chewy and rich as I was expecting. I will not make these again, but might save the frosting for another time.

Proportionally there were too many chocolate chips compared to dough.  When I went to cut them after cooking, the knife would hardly go through.  There were so many chocolate chips you could hardly taste the batter.  Could easily do with half in the recipe.  There is way too much icing on the top, it layered on a full centimetre thick and made the rooves of our mouths tingle because there was so much sugar in it.  It is a decent recipe, but overdoing on the chips and icing takes away from the great flavour.

Serve with a glass of milk!  My family loves these but they are extremely rich!  A little goes a long way, and have a glass of milk on standby.  But our neighbor who occasionally helps us out with our dog in exchange for baked goods ALWAYS requests these

Amazing. Very moist and last forever. I only added 5 tablespoons of peanut butter, but it was just as great. I think that 6 would be a little too much! ;)

I've made them several times and they always taste amazing! Although  I don't add the frosting though because It makes the  bars to sweet for my taste. My whole family loves it and they beg me to make it.

I've never made Bondies before this evening. let me tell you, this recipe is amazing! I was a little hesitant when I pull the pan out of the oven because they looked more like a cake and less like a square. After I cut the edges off, I began to like what I seen. If you found these too dry, you cooked these too long! I only added 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of the 2. The icing was absolutely delishes! I only added 2 cups of icing sugar, and I didn't add any milk. It turned out great! Will definitely make these again!

They turned a gorgeous golden brown and I was excited to try them. Unfortunately, when I did try them on there own (no icing), they were lacking flavor. I did make the icing to try them with that,  I  made a half batch as the comments suggested which was more than enough. I found the icing to be incredibly sweet and did not do much for the blondie.

Easy to make. I used milk chocolate chips. I don't recommend that. This recipe needs at least semi-sweet. Someone else posted that theirs came out dry. They must have over baked them because mine came out great!

Because others said it turned out dry, I added a little extra butter (1 cup instead of 3/4) and was careful not to overcook it.  

This was my first time making blondies, and I wish I had known that blondies focus on the combination of dark brown sugar and butter, instead of chocolate for brownies.  I used light brown sugar since the recipe didn't specify.  Next time, I'd use dark brown sugar, and cut down the white sugar.  

I also just made it easier on myself and blended the peanut butter into the batter instead of trying to fold it in; the electric mixer worked just fine with that.  The only thing I folded in were the chocolate chips and toffee bits.

That said, it turned out pretty well, just very sweet, almost too sweet, with the frosting as too much.  Others may like it being this sweet.  It was moist, rich and gooey.  So it turned out as intended, I just wasn't such a fan, though others were.

OMG.  These things are fantastic!  Like others on here, I did not make the frosting and, boy, am I glad I didn't!  I think we would have gone into a sugar coma if I had frosted them.  But, the truth is, they don't need it as they are so rich on their own.  To the people who said they were bland and dry, were we making the same recipe?!?  These things were ridiculously moist and flavorful.  Perhaps they used a pan instead of a dish like the recipe says to use....  I know I learned the hard way with another recipe that you cannot sub one for the other; your bars will be hard and dry if you use a pan instead of a glass dish.  Anyway, highly recommend!  Just make sure you have LOTS of milk on hand when you make these!

Turn out great just make sure to blend really well all the ingredients. Also I omitted the chocolate chips and used only one teaspoon of vanilla and one of rum extract. They were so delicious.

We liked it - but I wasn't as wow'ed by these as some of the other reviewers were. They were just so-so in my opinion. But easy to put together.  I used my individual browning pan to make them and this recipe made exactly 24.  I did skip the frosting tho.   In the end, I think I'll keep looking for a blondie recipe that I can't live without.

The only problem with this recipe is that you have to control your eating.  The bars are moist and peanut butter gooey.  They were a hit at our house!

Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, like eating a peanut butter cup from the inside out!!!  You could only make half of the frosting and still have plenty.
