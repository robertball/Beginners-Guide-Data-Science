I cheated and made these into bars... just didnt have the time to do individual cookies.  I added walnuts and baked the pan for about 30 minutes. These tasted the very best when still warm.. weak in the knees delicious

I used a combination of Spelt, Coconut, Almond and Flax flour.  I don't know how this changed the recipe from the original but I didn't get the balls to spread much and had little round fluffy cookies.  Taste was very good.  I sprinkled a little confectioners sugar on top to make a little festive.    I'd try this again.

First I am not a sweet potato fan, but I read this recipe and thought it sounded worth a try.  I will not make this again.  I followed the suggestion to make bars not cookies.  The flavor is VERY bland  tastes like flour with a hint of sweet potato.
