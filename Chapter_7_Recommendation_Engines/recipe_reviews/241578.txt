These meatballs are delicious - I made a big batch and they were gone way too quickly. I suggest subbing in Nordica 4% Cottage Cheese as I am a big milk fat fan!  It is good for you - trust me!

These meatballs are the bomb ... as in 4th of July fireworks ... great recipe that you can adjust the herbs and spices to.  And kids love them!

Now this is a great recipe!!  I'll admit I was lazy and just mixed everything together and made it "meatloaf" style...fantastic!!  Definitely will keep and make this recipe over and over.

The cottage cheese really did keep the lean ground turkey moist!  I used extra ground turkey and added seasonings to replicate the sausage taste and really enjoyed it.  Good stuff!

This was definitely a winner for us. I agree with some of the others, gone within one sitting so I will double the recipe next time. I did turkey meatballs - so good. I would recommend adding more sauce to the final baking dish as it needs more sauce to cover the meatballs.

Very easy and very tasty!  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain and also tucked a little mozzarella cube into the center of some of them.  Next time I will probably add a bit of Italian seasoning to bring up the flavor a bit, but overall these are definitely worth making!
