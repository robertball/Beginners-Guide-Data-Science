6.28.17  I used a small 1” cookie scoop and ended up with 52 cookies which baked perfectly at 8 minutes.  The texture of the cookie was soft and tender, very nice.  If I were to make this recipe again, I’d probably add more ginger and maybe even more molasses, since I thought the ginger cookie flavor was weak.  Unfortunately, I didn’t like the glaze AT ALL.  If you want iced ginger cookies or even a drizzle on them as I did, I’d recommend you use orange juice because the orange extract was too strong and just tasted artificial, simply not good.  I drizzled the glaze on a few cookies, tasted one, and threw away the rest of the glaze.  These cookies were OK, but I doubt I’ll make them again.  racahoon, sorry, wish I had a better review for you, but thanks for sharing your recipe.
