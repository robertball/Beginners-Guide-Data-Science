I made these because I didn't have granulated sugar, just brown sugar. They were great!  Made them for Halloween... then only got a few trick or treaters.  Fine with me, I'd eat another every hour or so, ha. These were the classic popcorn balls,  and as the evening progressed, they got a little better - more solid and with a little chewiness that I really liked. 

The only trouble that I had was forming the balls with oiled hands - they were still falling apart. I thought "oh, no... I am a popcorn ball failure!" Then, I remembered to put the oiled bags on, and that did the trick! Yummy.

I made them several times and will continue! The Karo syrup recipe is one I'm used to but I didn't have the recipe until now. We devoured them, so I don't have any pics - sorry.
