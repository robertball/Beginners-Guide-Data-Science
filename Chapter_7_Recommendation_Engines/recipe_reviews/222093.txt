I just got done putting everything in my new slow cooker but it didn't all fit so I had to only use half of the onion and half of the butternut squash. I'm not using the escarole at all. 

Next time I'm going to use a half recipe in order to make sure it'll all fit in the pot. 

I have a 5 quart slow cooker, which I thought was pretty big, so this recipe must be for a ginormous one.

I used about a pound (maybe a bit more but not 2 lbs) of leftover beef from a Prime Rib I cooked this week.  I diced the beef and browned stovetop in a bit of olive oil - then added the celery (3 stalks), carrots, onion and garlic - sprinkled with the salt and pepper.  Cooked all of that for a bit and the sprinkled it with about 1 heaping tablespoon of flour, the paprika.  Cooked that for a bit and added it to the slow cooker.  De-glazed the pan with the beef broth and added that to the slow cooker.  Add the bay leaf, diced potatoes and butternut squash.  I used a large butternut squash - more than the 3/4 lb called for.   There didn't seem to be enough liquid to cover the potatoes.  I initially started with one 14 oz can - which is more than the recipe called for but not nearly enough broth, so I added another 14 oz can of beef broth.  You need to cover the potatoes with liquid or then will turn black.  Set this to cook on low.  It didn't need more than 5 hours.  The escarole did not get added - I didn't have any and planned to add cabbage or bok choy at the end of the cooking time but I forgot and the troops were hungry.  The butternut squash and beef flavor combination is wonderful.

The butternut squash added a really nice flavor. I used baby kale instead of escarole because that was all I could find at the market.

I have made this recipe many many times. My roommate loved it, I love it. Everyone that I've had try it loved it. Make sure you give it a good stir or you can be left with a mostly meat bowl of stew (which I didn't mind, though having more veggies is awesome). 

I've never used the Escarole though I might try the baby kale suggestion from another reviewer this time around. Definitely in my regular rotation of slow-cooker recipes.

I loved the flavor of this chili. The only problem I had was I made it the day before. By the next day the squash had turned to mush.

Love it! I made it my own by using vegetable broth and V8, and no bay leaves and no sauce. Still super yummy. And really easy! I made it an hour before going to work and just left it to cook all day. My apartment smelled amazing when I came home later!

I just altered a few things. I browned the beef before throwing it in the crockpot. I did not use any butternut squash as this is such a large recipe and there was not any room left in my cooker. Next time, I will cut the recipe in half and add the squash. Just added a bit more seasoning as well as it was a bit bland.

I found it a little bland so I added celery seeds and a pinch of allspice and the flavour got brighter. Over all very easy and will do again

Made this tonight for dinner. It was delicious. I added 2 TBSP organic Worcestershire sauce. DELICIOUS! Was too much butternut squash for my crock pot so the excess I steamed and mashed to go along as a side dish for this.

It could use a bit more flavour (more spices and/or herbs)

Some changes, added some cooking red wine, used spinach towards end, also added more beef broth and those small purple potatoes. Only added 1 pound of stew meat cut in smaller pieces which was plenty. I think two pounds would of been way to much. Next time I would add more squash. It came out delicious

I will definitely make this again; however, I changed the proportion of ingredients and also the cooking method to stovetop in a dutch oven....I wanted to extract as much flavor from the beef and vegetables as possible. First I blotted the stew meat dry and seasoned the beef with the flour, salt and pepper, let it sit while I prepared the vegetables. I browned the beef in batches in 2 TBS olive oil, removed from dutch oven. I then sauted the vegetables for about 8 minutes, deglazed with beef broth and added beef back in. I did increased some of the ingredients as follows: 2 celery stalks, 2 bay leaves, 2 tsp. paprika, 2 tsp Worcestershire, one whole head of escarole and increased beef broth to cover contents of pot. I also added garlic pepper to taste and 1 TBS of balsamic vinegar. I brought stew to a boil, covered and simmered for 2 hours. Then added escarole and simmered uncovered for 20 minutes. The result was a very flavorful stew.
