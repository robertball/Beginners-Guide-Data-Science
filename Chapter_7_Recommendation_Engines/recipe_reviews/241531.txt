This recipe turned out better than I anticipated. I did have to substitute Thyme  for Rosemary, but the results were amazing!  I had a small gathering and made 2, 2 1/2 pound pork  roasts. No leftovers, it was that good!  I used Kingsford hickory briquettes on my Weber grill and cooked it low and slow. There was a beautiful smoke ring on the roast and I couldn't believe that I made such a wonderful meal. The food was gone so fast, I didn't get a picture, sorry.  I'll get one next time,  this is definitely my go to pork roast recipe!

Absolutely wonderful recipe. Just what I was looking. I took it off the grill right when it reached 155 degrees. It was moist and wonderfully tasty. I didn't have fresh rosemary so I had to use dried. I added a couple of tablespoons to the wood chips while I was soaking them and it worked out ok. The aroma of the smoke with applewood chips and rosemary made our mouths water! It was good the way it was but next time I'm going to remember to have some fresh rosemary around!

Just great!  Prepared exactly per directions but more salt. (Personal taste).  It was tender, savory and juicy.  Will definitely do this again.

Usually I like to marinate pork in Italian dressing or a Teryaki based marinade. I think I'll stick with that. This recipe lacked any zing.

This was simply amazing. The flavor was to die for. We will be making this again.

This was a simple, easy to make, recipe that made a really tasty pork roast. The thyme sprigs on the charcoal added a very nice herb flavor. I added a bit too much charcoal, so it dried out a bit. To compensate, I warmed a sauce of olive oil, orange juice, a little white vinegar, and mint leaves. The sauce helped make the meat moist and tender.

I definitely will use this recipe again.

Excellent! Made a whole bunch to freeze and use later! Wrapped them in foil and put them in a smoker with no wood, only the seasoned smoker flavor.
