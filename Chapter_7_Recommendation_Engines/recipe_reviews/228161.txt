I made my own pie crust instead of the puff pastry.  I roasted the veggies and heated the stock and milk as described.  Then I made a roux with the butter and flour and added curry and onions.  Then drizzled in the milk and stock.  Then added the sauce to the veggies.   I enjoyed this very much and will make again for sure.  Yumm!

We loved this recipe! It came out wonderful. I didn't skin red potatoes and the skin was actually quite delicious in the pot pie - i added some cayenne and used red onions, I added some seared chicken thighs and used 1% milk and only 1 tbsp butter (but extra oil from cooking the chicken). It was delicious!! (might add some green peas next time!)

I've made this twice now, both times using regular pie crust instead of puff pastry. The first time I used coconut milk and my family rated it 4 stars. The second time, I used regular milk as the recipe called for and we rated it only 3 stars. I will definitely make this again, but using coconut milk.

I love this recipe!  The flavor is amazing and I love using parsnips in a way that everyone in the family loves.  :)  My only substitutions were all to make the recipe dairy free (butter, milk) and it came out perfectly.  I make this every Fall now and just love it.

Just finished and thought it was so delicious! I had a similar pie at a restaurant and wanted to recreate it at home- I think it was a complete success. I made a few modifications, must notably the addition of golden raisins. This was one of my favorite parts in the restaurant version and it turned out beautifully at home. The raisins balance the curry spice and add another flavor and texture dimension to all the root veggies.  Trust me, it is so good. Since I really like them I added about 3/4 cup. Other modifications included that I doubled the curry powder, used skim milk, chicken broth, and only about two tablespoons of butter.

This was really easy and good!  The only thing I would do differently is cook red potatoes longer as they seem to be hard when the others were done.  I saw a reviewer that made samosas with this and I can see that!  Very good!  Thank you!

Very simple, adaptable recipe that tastes really good. I should have thickened the sauce a bit more, had some messy spillover in the oven. Used a simple Bisquick batter over top instead of filo, which worked just fine. Also added a handful of raisins to the mix.

I made it without the crust and ate it as a stew over rice, and it turned out great!  I added mushrooms, doubled the curry powder, and used yogurt instead of milk - adds a nice tanginess.

Super easy recipe, which I followed to a 't' for a group meeting.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

It was delicious!   Thanks for the recipe.   I changed it a little:   13 x 9 pan with a mix of rutabaga, parsnip, turnip, carrots, sweet and red potatoes.    I also substituted coconut milk for cow's milk.

Wonderful! The only change u made was using coconut milk instead of whole and it was very good. Even my very picky 12 year went back for seconds. 

Might try these as hand pies at some point.

I used pie crusts...and it was easy and tasty! It's important to buy good-quality curry from a spice store. It makes all the difference!

Exceptionally good! Was looking for a recipe to use up the parsnips I got in my CSA box last week. As it turns out I was able to use several vegetables that I had on hand. I used celery, celery root, carrots, parsnip red peppers and onion. My family was very skeptical when they saw the dish, but they raved about it and fought over the leftovers the next day. It was colourful, tasty and nutritious!

I was craving samosas from my favorite Indian restaurant so I was searching and searching and I found this recipe that I liked the best. Instead of a pot pie, I did turnovers with the puff pastry. I just used red potatoes, carrots, and peas. It hit the spot. I served with pesto which was absolutely yummy. Next time I'll use more curry and get more puff pastry because I had left over filling. Yum yum.

This was FANTASTIC!  I took it to a church supper, and people were coming back for seconds.
