These were good but I didn't love the plain breadcrumbs. I think Panko would have been a better choice. I personally prefer a flour/cornmeal combo but that is just me. These were still good though and I really liked the addition of seafood seasoning. I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Would not ever have thought of deep-frying pickles until my granddaughter came home one day and said she had been to the fair and tried them. I immediately looked for a recipe and found this - it is a truly incredible, delicious and tart snack or side-dish! I used wedges of dill pickles and all worked out fine. So, So, So GOOD!

Delicious.  The first time I made this I used bread pickle rounds, these where very good.  The second time I hade this I used full Dill Pickles from the Deli.  I cut these into rounds myself that where about 1/2 inch thick.  These where good also.  I think I prefer the second method.  
   Note, if you are scaling this and making rounds, you don't need to make more of the breadcrumb mix, that will be good for up to triple this recipe.
