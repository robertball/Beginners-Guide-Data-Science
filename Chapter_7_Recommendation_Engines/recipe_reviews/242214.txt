I already know how delicious this is because I live in Pittsburgh, and this is pretty much exactly how we always eat out steak/chicken salads (minus the croutons, which I omitted b/c hubby doesn't care for them). If you've never had a steak or chicken salad with fries on it, you are definitely missing out and you MUST try it...SOOOOO GOOD! We use either Italian or ranch (sometimes both) for dressing~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
