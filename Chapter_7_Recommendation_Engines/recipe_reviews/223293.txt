Made this several times.  Turned out great every time, and it is always devoured.

Made this (almost) exactly as stated and took it to a birthday dinner yesterday. Everyone loved it! I say almost because I couldn't find breaded okra, so I breaded thawed okra in about 1 c. cornmeal mixed with 1/2 c. flour and a little salt and pepper then fried till crisp, about 7 or 8 minutes. Perfect! I might add a little cayenne to the dressing next time just to kick it up a little, but it doesn't need any changes at all! Definitely a keeper!

To much sugar in the dressing for me. I would cut it down to a fourth of a cup.
