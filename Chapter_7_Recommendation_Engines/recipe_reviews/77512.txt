I needed something I could throw together with ingredients on hand. This recipe was great!  I didn't have peas, so I used green beans.  After I browned the ground beef and drained it, I mixed everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for the day. My whole family loved it, even the kids!

This was quite good!  I did cook the onion with the beef though (personal preference) and added a clove of garlic. Didn't have canned carrots, so added two chopped. Also added a bay leaf, rosemary, thyme, orgegano, pepper and basil to the simmering stew.  I think without spices it would be very bland.  Also let it cook longer than directed to let the potatos help thicken the stew and simmered for a while with the lid off to let some water cook off, otherwise it would be pretty soupy.  This is a nice dinner if you want a change from a stew using the regular stew meat and/or have some gr. beef you want to use up.  Made it a one-pot meal by cooking all in a dutch oven on the stove top (just drained grease before adding rest).  I thought it was pretty good and the husband loved it.  Next time I think I'll add some parsley as well and maybe try the cheese suggestion.  If you wanted a thicker stew, I suppose you could add flour to the harmburger after you drain off the fat.  I may try that next time as well.  ;o)

I like the facted that it was fast and only took 20 minute, but I feel that it was very bland.

Your getting there. This is for the young person that hasn't any seasonings. Or the faint of heart.

Very yummy stew. I did add a pinch of basil, parsley, garlic powder just for a little more flavor.
