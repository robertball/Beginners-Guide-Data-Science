This soup is a decent base as written. I left out the 2 cups of water, as the 32 oz of broth (I used homemade ham stock in place of chicken broth) was enough for me, and I didn't want to water it down. Also, 3 Tablespoons of dried rosemary would have overpowered the whole flavor. I only used 2 teaspoons, and I could still taste it quite well. I added about a teaspoon of garlic powder.
