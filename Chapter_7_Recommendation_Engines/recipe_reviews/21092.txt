I made some of this recipe and canned it, very tasty. A tip I learned is to chop up the tomatoes and let them sit in a colander or big pot overnight or at least a few hours. The juice will seperate from the toms. The juice will then seperte like fat from stock. The top will be a bright red tomato sauce, the bottom is tomato water. Use the top sauce to cook the toms and discard the water or use it to cook rice, add to soup, make bread. It will last in the firidge for several days. The toms will cook down and thicken in half the time and less chance of scorching the pot

Good recipe, especially since I have tomatoes coming out of ears!  I did not peel the tomatoes (that is where a lot of the nutrients are!)  I canned them, processed them and will now have fresh tasting stewed tomaotes throughout the winter.

I made a half recipe of these and used them in the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" (from this site). Very Yummy! UPDATE: I canned this recipe (the whole recipe, not half) in 500mL (16oz) jars and yielded 6 cans. I filled the jars with the tomatoes and veggies first, then topped it up with the liquid until the volume was level with the bottom thread of the jar. I processed them in a boiling water bath for 1 hour. When I opened my first can about 6 weeks later it was EVEN BETTER than when I made it fresh. The flavour was incredible! So I'm changing my review from 4 stars to 5 stars and I highly reccommend that you can this recipe!

Great stewed tomatoes.  If they are too watery, keep cooking them.  They will thicken.  Good to eat as a sidedish or to use in a recipe such as chili.

I also have tomatoes up the ying-yang so I thought I would sub canned tomatoes for fresh in my chili.  It turned out the best I've made, although it was a little runny, so I added a small can of sauce (to the chili).  What I did differently was I left out the celery and added garlic.  Then I sauteed the onion pepper & garlic in a tsp. of olive oil before adding the tomatoes.  Thanks for the recipe Leah!

in my family we cook it all the time, we skip the basil and add garlic, fry the garlic in a little oil before the add other ingredients, we use it as pasta topping along with some cheese, add to eggs, or for a quick pizza top it on a slice of bread and add cheese and all you want on top and microwave it, its great on everything, you can also make it in small amounts using left over tomatoes.

very good flavor, but every time I make this it turns out runny....I have tried adding some flour and cooking it longer, and this seemed to help.  A good basic recipe to start from :)

I actually wanted to make tomato sauce but didn't have the ingredients for other recipes so used this and pureed my tomatoes-skin, seeds and all in my new cuinsinart.  I also added garlic and used fresh basil and a 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning.  I just let it simmer w/o a lid for about 30 minutes and it came out really good.

Excellent flavor!  My husband and son raved about them.  I also added a crushed clove of garlic, and did not peel the tomatoes. They were a little watery, I just drained some of the liquid.  Great way to use up all those tomatoes.  Delicious!

Made this recipe from about 40 roma tomatoes that a friend gave me. Instead of cooking this with celery and onion, I roasted the tomatoes at 300 for about 1 hour, just drizzled some olive oil, garlic and one medium sized green pepper. I put the entire mixture into my crock pot on low for about 4 hours; I added about 2 tbls of tomato paste. The sauce thickened nicely and my husband asked me if I would make some meat sauce out of it. I browned an onion and about 1 cup of sliced portabello mushrooms in olive oil; I also browned 1 lb. of ground buffalo meat and seasoned with a small amount of salt and ground black pepper and 2 tbls of Agave. My husband has some health issues and I can't use salt and sugar, so I substitute all the time. I've used buffalo many times before and it has a sweeter flavor than beef and is also much healthier. It has a better texture than ground turkey. I moved the tomato mixture from the crock pot to the big stew pot on the top of the stove and warmed them up for about 20 minutes. Served it over penne and made steamed broccoli as a side dish. We loved our dinner and I have two more frozen. It was a good recipe and I appreciate it.

If it's too runny, try adding day old bread. That's the way my parent's made it. Great basic recipe.

What attracted me to this recipe was the fact that it had no salt.  I had read the reviews and noticed some said the end product was too watery.  So, when I followed the instructions, the only change I made was straining the tomatoes and only using 2 cups of the juice.  (I drank the rest.  Refreshing.)  It still turned out a bit watery, but that's fine.  Once the jars cooled, I had to open one and try it.  It was a bit bland (sweet maybe?).  That was a bit surprising to me since I don't cook with salt.  I added a tiny bit of sea salt and that made the difference.  The next time I make this, I will reduce the sugar to 2 tsp and add 1 tsp sea salt.  I think that will balance it better for my particular taste.  The tomatoes are not squashy; they've managed to maintain a bit of firmness and the other veggies still have some crunch to them.  All in all, this is very good. It is attractive to the eye, has an excellent texture, and very nice flavor.  It was my first time ever canning, so I was afraid I'd mess it up.  However, it was a positive experience. There was no specific processing time given, so I did a 15 min. water bath.  I'm eating my second bowl of Italian Stewed Tomatoes right now.  I was wondering if they taste better with age, after they've sat awhile and the flavors have blended.  However, I don't think they'll last long enough to "age."

I'm a fan of slow cooking; I had 4 pounds of past-prime, wrinkled grape tomatoes and thought this recipe might work with a slow cooker.  I wasn't disappointed!  I didn't have celery, so I didn't use it.  I added one chopped raw onion.  I also added Italian seasoning and garlic, as some other reviewers did.  I didn't peel the tomatoes, but I cooked them as-is, on low heat, overnight.  It was so good, in fact, that I'm going to make it again, this time with Roma and beefsteak tomatoes.  It tasted delicious when I combined it with our rice-cooker rice "mixture" that I made (1/2 cup rice, 1/2 cup spelt, 1/2 cup quinoa, 1/2 cup barley, 1/2 cup millet, 1/2 cup chopped onion).  Great recipe!

This was a most delicious dish.  I devided the recipe in half since I was only cooking for my husband and myself.  I used our home grown tomatoes and 
cilantro instead of basil.  Added a pinch of salt and a couple shakes of our home grown dried serrano peppers. Deleted the sugar altogether because our tomatoes which are Early Girls have enough of their own sugar.   Yummy, we had this dish with stuffed peppers, corn on the cob and sauted mushrooms.  Go for it please.  We both gave this dish an A++.  Will make again, and again.  Next time I'll try it with basil, but love my cilantro.

Great recipe! Thanks. I had a large box of tomatoes, all ripe, to use up. Wasn't in the mood for a pasta sauce but knew I had to do something to cook them down before they went bad. This fit the bill. I omitted the green bell pepper (didn't have one). I used fresh-frozen basil instead of dried. Served over rice and beans. Recommended.

For those of you who have canned this recipe, did you add lemon juice before canning?  I'm kind of a newbie to canning and I've never done tomatoes before.  But everything I've read says you have to add some acid, most call for lemon juice, to keep the acid level high enough.  Any advice would be appreciated!

Good & easy.   To deal with it being too "watery", I arranged the veggies in a donut shape in my pan, the liquid pooled in the center, and I simply sucked out the excess with a turkey baster.  No problemo.

This is an awesome recipe - I used it in my chili recipe and it was a homerun with my hubby.  He said he could taste the freshness of the sauce.  I made the following changes: I used roma tomatoes(it was what I had on hand), I sauteed fresh minced garlic and added to the other ingredients, I used honey versus sugar (for dietary reasons)and I added to the seasoning oregano, rosemary and an italian medley blend.   I will be using this recipe for all my future chili dishes and any others that call for stewed tomatoes.  Thanks again!

Just made this with lots of tomatoes from my garden. Only didn't add peppers, but did add garlic. Excellent!! I canned it after. And it was liquidy (of course, because the tomatoes were fresh!) so I just spooned it out. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a very easy recipe. It turned out wonderful I added some fresh crushed garlic a little italian seasoning, oregano and basil. I canned it in my pressure canner and will have stewed tomatoes for the winter to add to recipes.

I got this recipe from a church cookbook years ago and love it. I don't use the basil, but do add 1/2 tsp salt. We use the tomatoes as marinara, or as a side dish. Great for canning.

I winged this as I was in a pinch. I needed stewed tomatos but didn't have fresh maters. I followed the recipe to a t with the exception of the basil and mixed it with 2 cans of petite diced tomatos that I had in the pantry rather than fresh.  I thought they were better than canned stewed (better fresher flavor even though I didn't go the fresh route) not as good as" garden fresh"  but in a pinch works very well with what you have!

If too runny, just add some cornstarch to thicken it.

I tried it and made a few additions.I peeled the tomatoes then let them sit for a few hours until I got back to them. Poured off the liquid then chopped them. Not too runny at all.  I found it bland so I added salt/pepper/tobasco sauce to taste to give it some umpf. I cooked it for 20 min. instead of the 10.  Tastes great. Will make it again.

These stewed tomatoes were delicious. But I made some changes. I did not add sugar. Not necessary with fresh tomatoes! I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and 1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley. I used fresh basil instead of dried. I also cooked it longer - more like 30 minutes. Delicious for breakfast with a fried egg on top!

The only thing I changed was added a T. garlic.  I had to cook a long time for the celery and onions to not be crunchy. I will make again but will saute other ingredients in olive oil first and cut back the sugar.

This is just what I was looking for. I used fresh tomatoes and followed the recipe exactly. I cut the recipe down to 3 servings and maybe used a few less tomatoes but the flavor was excellent and it complimented the meat wonderfully.

Meh. It was easy enough to make but not particularly flavourful. I ended up pureeing the rest and putting it in pasta sauce. Next time I will either add some more spices or just keep looking.

Great recipe!  I used fresh tomatoes and  peppers from the garden. I also used fresh basil (2 tablespoons) instead of dried. In addition, I added a tablespoon of fresh oregano.

The first time i made this recipe it was a little watery, So as suggested by another review i let the tomatoes drain in a collander overnight. 100% better. PS. I added garlic and chopped jalapenos. Five stars for sure.
