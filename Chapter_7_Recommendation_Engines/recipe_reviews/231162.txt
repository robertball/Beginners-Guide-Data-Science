This recipe was a great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I didn't have smoked turkey so I used regular and added two teaspoons of liquid smoke. I used red beans instead of black because that is what I had on hand. My little guy can't do the jalapenos so the rest of us just added hot sauce to taste at dinner. It makes a large pot and is great with corn bread. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good soup ! I used Rotel for the canned tomato & spicy V8, added extra garlic, but everything else I followed the recipe & it tastes amazing. I struggle with the leftovers from my husbands smoked turkey every year , this soup is a winner !!

I made this because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand at the time.  It is not something I would normally make, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't put the jalapeno in, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I served it with a sprinkle of fiesta blend cheese and fritos and it was a bit reminiscent of chili frito pie.

We made this recipe as written, except - 1- We probably doubled the garlic - because we always do.  2- It wasn't a smoked turkey.     3- We have younger ones, so we passed on the Tabasco, and used a few drops of the green Tabasco.  (personally, I would be happy with the pepper.                                     *My daughter said she liked it even better than the Panera Chicken Tortilla soup that we by at Sam's.  "It tastes - warm."  Simple and tasty!  Definitely worth a repeat.
