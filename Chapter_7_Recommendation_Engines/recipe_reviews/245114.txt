i made a Jump Rope Crisp! This is one of the YUMMIEST i've ever made. the combination of fruits and the spices make a spectacular taste sensation.  The ginger just takes it right over the top!  This is definitely a keeper.Thanks for sharing your lovely recipe Jody!

I made this pie for a family gathering and everyone raved about it. Raved, I tell you. I created the recipe, it was great the first time I made it, and it was a huge hit the most recent time. It will remain one of my favourite go-to pie recipes.

I made this pie late in the evening so it's problems may have been down to my own tiredness and inexperience. 
I'm not a fan of tropical mixtures, and this pie was completely tropical. (Really tangy) I think I'll just risk a plum pie next time since the plum was what I wanted to taste. I didn't taste any. The baking time wasn't quite long enough and I didn't notice until it was cooled the next morning. Plus, the filling was completely runny once it cooled. The night before it was thicker, almost goo. But in the morning it was tangy soup. Oh well, I couldn't eat it, but my brother could, so 2 stars.
