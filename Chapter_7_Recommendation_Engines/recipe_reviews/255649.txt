Very good soup!!! My whole family loved it. I made it because my 6 yr had a chest cold. Adding ginger and lemon to chicken noodle soup adds a tasty  flare and are natural expectorants. Was very surprised at how yummy it was.

Really enjoyed making this recipe. I found it required more broth than expected and it would have been good if I had cooked the onion, celery, and carrots more at the beginning. The peas, though optional, improved the taste a lot.  I wiil definitely cook this recipe again.

Delicious and so easy! I loved all the flavors, especially the lemon! I actually added an extra 2T of lemon and it came out so good! The perfect soup for someone who is sick!

This broth is so fabulous!  Sick or not sick, it is so satisfying!  I leave out the celery and parsley (personal preference) and double everything else so we have plenty to freeze.  Love adding the lemon juice too.  All ages will love this soup!  The pictures make it look like plain chicken noodle soup but it is sooooo much better than that!

My household has been struck by Influenza (type A, if you're curious) and this soup is AMAZING: it is fragrant enough to get through stuffy noses, flavorful enough for the non-sufferers,  and is so easy to make. Delicious! Will make again.

Very good! Heavy handed on the garlic and ginger. I like the taste the extra ginger and garlic gave it. Will make again!
