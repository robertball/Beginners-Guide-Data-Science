Excellent in my book! I didn't feel like making pita bread and was already thinking of souvlaki salad when I found this recipe. So simple, full of flavor, and the perfect dish for a hot summer day. Very light and refreshing. The only change I might make next time would be to use a little less lemon juice in the marinade because the chicken seemed very lemony to me. However, once all components of the salad were put together, the flavors seemed to balance.  I used mixed green salad blend as that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks for another fantastic recipe, Bren!

A simple yet very tasty recipe. I used chicken tenders instead of the full breast:  less work and they’re typically still moist after grilling. We put the cooked tenders (cut into medium-sized pieces on top of warmed pita bread, add lettuce, tomato & cucumber (again, each in medium-sized pieces) and plenty of tzatziki sauce.  Very thin white onion slices may be added as well.
