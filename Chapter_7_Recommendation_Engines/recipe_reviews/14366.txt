This was just perfect for what I needed!  It was tasty, simple, fast, and I already had most of the ingredients. My husband loved it!

I loved the flavor of this, but next time would use some other type of pasta.

My husband says, "Tell em 'Awesome!' from me."  " I can see us eating this on a veranda with a great bottle of wine and french bread."  Basically it transformed him to another place.  Thank you!

I used a sweet onion, half the amount of olives, corkscrew pasta, and added some fat free feta and it was great!

Certainly this is better when it has time to sit and let flavors meld!  I wanted something to extend our dinner last night and so made this because I had all the ingredients on hand except the green pepper, so I used red bell pepper.  I was thinking that it needed salt and pepper.  I'm glad I didn't add any because today it has wonderful flavor!  I would definitely make this again!  Thank you, Stephanie Carroll!

Excellent! A simple dish with little preparation and a short ingredients list. I think the vermicelli noodles are perfect for this recipe. The smaller size is a great balance for the dressing. My family does prefer this with the onion and pepper minced.

This was very good.  A nice change from pasta salad. The grandkids ( 8 of them) loved it. I made it twice this summer.
