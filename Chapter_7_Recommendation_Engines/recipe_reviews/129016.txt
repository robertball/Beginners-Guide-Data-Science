Made as written except for the cream of mushroom soup. I did not see how you'd even notice 1 teaspoon in 2 pounds of Velveeta and I wasn't going to buy a can for that.  Milk or half and half works just fine in its place. This was tasty and a great way to use up leftover crawfish from a boil. If my crawfish wouldn't have already been seasoned I would have added a couple of dashes of Old Bay or cajun seasoning.
