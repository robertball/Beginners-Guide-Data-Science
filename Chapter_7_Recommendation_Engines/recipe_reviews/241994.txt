Easy and tasty. 
Made for my elderly parents. Store bought peaches were quite hard and weren't softening and hard for parents to chew.  Baking the peaches helped a lot!
Didn't have cinnamon. Substituted ground ginger.  Flavor very good.  Look forward to using better peaches next time and trying cinnamon.

Very good, easy dessert.  I topped with an espresso infused dark balsamic vinegar and they were wonderful.

YUM! Quick, easy and delicious - all the taste without a lot of effort! My husband LOVES peaches 'n cream so I thought I'd give this a try and I'm glad I did.  Typically we like to grill peaches, but since it was freezing outside the oven method worked just as nice. You could easily turn this into a "crisp " of sorts with the addition of a little oatmeal thrown into the mix. I crumbled a few shortbread cookies over top before serving. My husband had his with vanilla ice cream and a dollup of whipped cream on top!

This is so good.  But beware, these peaches are too hot to eat direct from oven, like burn your mouth hot. Next time I’ll be cooling them at least 15 to 30 minutes. Than the ice cream won’t melt immediately. Maybe I should have known this???

Had so many requests to make this again and again! Recipe is so so easy, and I just recommend an extra sprinkle of brown sugar on top of the open face before flipping them open face for the last 5 minutes to give it a nice glazed top

Followed the recipe to the letter. Excellent! Easy! Inexpensive! Best with super sweet peaches. Would be nice to add candied nuts or raspberry compote (or both!). Highly recommend!

I bought large peaches and cut them in fours.  I also bought vanilla bean ice cream instead of traditional vanilla.

We made it exactly as described, and it was delicious.  It was super quick and easy to cook while we ate, so it was just like having fresh from the oven peach cobbler without all the fuss and calories.

This was yummy and easy to make.  I had quite a big group to feed so cooked the peaches and held them in the oven on warm for probably 2 hours. Then plated and served them. Nothing like warm peaches with the ice cream melting on top. Made the house smell delicious, too.

I had fresh peaches from the Farmer's Market that weren't very tasty. This recipe came up in a Google search. I made this recipe as specified. So simple. I may try pumpkin seasoning or nutmeg next time, just because I like it. But, this is very good just the way it is. I topped one with Trader Joe's Mango Sorbet and one with Trader Joe'ts  Soy Creamy Cherry Chocolate Chip. Hard to stop at two halves per serving.
