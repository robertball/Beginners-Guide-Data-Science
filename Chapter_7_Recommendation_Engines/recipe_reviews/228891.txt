A mousse is smooth and fluffy.  I love good tuna fish and fresh avocado so jumped on this recipe.  However, making the tuna with sour cream and Miracle Whip was strange.  I do usually make tuna with mayo and relish along with some chopped egg but I did make this as listed. The initial flavor isn't horrible but it leaves an unpleasant after-taste.  From now on, I will make my tuna with mayo and maybe avocado for an extra creaminess but my usual recipe will stay the same.

This was good. I often put half sour cream and half mayo/salad dressing in my tuna and chicken salads, so I like that flavor. However, I thought this had too much sour cream; probably half the amount would have been fine. But, maybe that's what made it a "mousse" to the submitter. I used a couple tablespoons of fresh minced yellow onion instead of dried. I also ended up adding some garlic salt, black pepper and dried cilantro.

I say anything with avocado in it has to be good regardless of the name. This was perfect on crackers and no doubt it would be as good on lettuce cups.
