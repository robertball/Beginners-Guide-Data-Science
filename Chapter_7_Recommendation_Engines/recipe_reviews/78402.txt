Without question the best black bean soup recipe I have ever tasted.  What sets this black bean soup apart from the others is the refried black beans.  This gives the soup a rich smooth base that I have not found in others.  I had trouble finding refried black beans at my grocery so I googled it and made my own.  Very simple and very good.  I halved the recipe below to make the quantity about equal to that called for in the soup recipe.  Amazing soup... This is a must try.

Refried Bean Recipe
2 (32-ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained 
2 cups water 
3 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil 
1 large onion, diced 
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
1 tablespoon cumin

Puree 2 cans of black beans in 2 cups water in food processor. Heat the lard or other fat in a large saucepan over medium heat. Saute the onions with the salt and cumin until golden, about 10 minutes. Add the beans and continue cooking over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the liquid evaporates and the beans form a creamy mass that pulls away from the bottom and sides of the pan, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.

With all of the rave reviews I was really dissappointed.  The refried black beans although sounded like a good idea, just left "chunks" and a "gritty" texture, the more I stirred the more the other beans broke down.  I would like to try it again but I would definitly use a food processor for the refried beans and broth and maybe add a little more fat somehow for the gritty factor.  Other than that sounded like a great recipe, can't figure out where it went wrong.

This was pretty good. I added green pepper and did tomato sauce, not puree. I had a can of refried black beans, but none of the regular, so I ended up doing 1 1/3 cups prepared dried black beans. I'm sure it's better, texture-wise, with the canned ones, but these worked. There's another black bean soup recipe on this site that I like a bit better, but this one was good.

I love this kind of stuff, as long as it's spicy like it oughta be.  First time I couldn't find refried black beans, so I made it using the Low-Fat Refried Beans recipe on here.  Made it again after I found canned refried beans.  I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth because I never have that around, and I too used tomato sauce because I also never have tomato puree around.  Overall I didn't do anything to change the flavor really, which was very good, and was good on a cold day.  (Though admittedly, I started getting tired of it after making it twice too close together.)  I liked it best with sour cream stirred into it.  (In fact, without the sour cream, it's more of a 4.)  Oh yes, and it was pretty easy - not a lot of prep other than measuring and dumping into the pot.

I made this soup for a very skeptical group of people who were expecting the worst when they heard bean soup was on the menu and was pleasantly surprised to hear many murmurs of approval. A few people stated that this is one of the best homemade soups they have tasted. Personally, I think the ginger really makes it. All in all, a heartwarming soup.

Absolutely fantastic! I recently had jaw surgery so I had to puree my portion of the batch, and that resulted in a wonderfully creamy dish. I did make a couple of changes: added an 11oz can of corn, used my favorite spicy salsa in place of tomato purée, replaced the vege broth with chicken stock for more flavor, doubled the garlic amount of course, left out the cayenne (salsa spicy enough), and added a little bit of half and half in the end to make it creamier. And of course when I added a bowl sized amount of the soup to the blender, I topped it off with a nice dollop of sour cream before I pressed purée! Yum!

I made this as a side for chicken sandwiches for an easy dinner.  It was very good.  The only changes I made were that I didn't have thyme or celery salt, so used some Italian seasoning and I also used tomato sauce and used chicken stock instead of vegetable.  I used fresh lime instead of lemon and added some green onion.  It was just spicy enough and I served this over some leftover rice.  Very yummy!  Very versatile and the bowls were all empty.

Delicious last-minute soup, as long as you have refried and regular black beans handy. Easily halved for a dinner for 2 with sour cream to garnish and tortilla chips for dipping. Thanks for posting the recipe!

Delicious!  It reminded me of a black bean soup that I had in a local restaurant.  They added bits of tender brisket to their soup and it was wonderful!

This soup was extremely easy to make. I had refried (pinto) beans in my cupboard, so I used those plus a can of sweet corn, and it was delicious!

Amazing soup! May be the best recipe I have ever made.  Only change I made was to use coconut oil instead of olive oil.   Oh, and a can of tomato sauce not purée.   Sooo delish! The lemon and the cayenne balance perfectly with the spices and beans.  I seriously felt like I was eating the equivalent of chocolate mouser in the soup world.  Was amazing.  This recipe's title belies its greatness.

Delicious! I would substitute one can of refried beans for another can of black beans to bring more texture to this soup.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, thyme, celery salt, or tomato puree, so I used tomato sauce and added more garlic, minced onion, chili powder, and paprika to taste.  It's fun to combine this with the bread bowl recipe from Taste of Home Kitchens.

This is a good recipe with some changes. I pureed everything after step 1, before adding some whole black beans. It would be very good pureed with no whole black beans. I did not like the lemon juice addition, and am glad I forgot it and only tried a splash in one of the bowls.  I had a fluke with one (my last) can of black beans, and had to use a can of regular refried beans. It still tastes wonderful. Good recipe, thank you. Very hearty and heartwarming. Very good taste combination.

Made this to go with my Mexican themed Superbowl goodies.  It was a hit!  Hubby accidentally bought tomato sauce instead of puree when i sent him shopping, so I just went with it.  Also used onion powder as I am not a fan of onions for the most part.  Turned out execllent, but a little more runny that I had hoped.  That is the only reason I gave it 4 not 5 and maybe this is because I used the sauce.

This was quite good. I left out the bacon to cut calories and replaced the can of water with more chicken broth to up the flavor. Came out delicious. Do make the garnish and use either sour cream or yogurt to top it off. Black beans are so healthy so any way to incorporate them into your diet is a winner - if it's tasty too than all the better!

I made the recipe as directed.  Great soup!  Perfect seasoning!

Next time  I will add more corn, unblended black beans, peppers and corn starch to thicken it up!

OMG!!!  This was absolutely delicious.  I have never had black bean soup befoe and wanted to try it.  I normally double my soup recipes, but did not want to double this as I was unsure of how it would turn out.  Well....let me tell you...I should have doubled it.  It was soooo good that I tried to deter my husband and son from eating it by telling them that they wouldn't like it!!  Of course, my reverse psychology didn't work...and they ended up eating it all.  Definitely a keeper and I will be making this again.

This is truly EASY and FAST to make.  The only changes I made were adding 1 extra can each of the refried and whole black beans-we just like more beans in our soup.  Also adding that much lemon juice is not for the faint of heart.  I cut the amount in half.  As for the sour cream, I just mixed it into the soup itself  If you're looking for something to make for dinner that's really good but quick and easy this is it.

This was a very odd tasting black bean soup.  It has way too much tomato, and the refried beans gave it a strange texture.  I won't be making this one again.

This is so delicious and would hold up well using any tomato product or any type of refried beans (pinto, black, etc.) with any combo of spices that suits you. I liked the allspice in here but others may not. I have a real surplus of the Bush's varieties of refried beans due to the way the coupons have been flooding my Sunday paper and this is a delicious way to use them up!

fantastic flavors in this soup, was concerned about the different spices but they melded together very well. I did make alterations based on what I had on hand, 1/4 tsp ground ginger instead of the 1 tsp fresh chopped, threw a can of diced tomatoes into the blender for a minute because I did not have puree, 2 cans of regular refried beans (pinto I believe), 1 can of black beans and 1 can of cannelini. After it was done cooking I did not care for the consistency so I blended it in batches until there were no whole beans in the soup. Made it creamier and I much preferred this consistency. Had it the next day for lunch with a dollop of sour cream.....delish! I think you can mix up the beans however you want, it's the spice combo that makes this one a winner! Thank you for sharing!

This is a really nice recipe!  It tastes even better if you make it using freshly made beans and home made refried beans (I use the Refried Beans Without the Refry recipe from this site).  I also generally replace the lemon juice with lime.

This soup is so easy and delicious!! I trippled the amount of garlic and ginger. I added a can of diced tomatoes with onions, cilantro and peppers. I wanted to add a can of corn but i didn't have any. I replaced the sugar for 2 handfuls of brown sugar. sour cream, cilantro and green onions on top with grated cheese makes it perfect. my vegetarian friend loved it!

Very good soup! Easy and tasty! I made a few minor changes. I added cumin and red pepper (I could find cayenne pepper in the store). I also used lime juice instead of lemon. 
Just make sure you stir the refried beans until they are well blended so there are no lumps.

This soup tasted more like Tomato with Black Bean Soup. I'm use to having cilantro and lime juice in my black bean soups but I gave this recipe a try anyways. I didn't care for the it but my Husband liked it.

This recipe has too many ingredients to be considered easy. The tomato flavor was a little over-powering, and the refried beans gave it a strange texture. I prefer some of the other recipes that use pureed black beans instead.

An outstanding soup.  It was a hit with both vegetarians and omnivores at an office luncheon.
