I only used 1 tbsp of soy sauce as I thought it would be too salty, and added a bunch of chopped, lightly steamed green beans in with the tofu.  We really enjoyed it and it was very quick to prepare after work.

To make this go a little further, I used one pork tenderloin, cut into strips.  The amount of sauce and seasoning is still plenty.  Also, try serving this over some pan-fried noodles.  It's excellent:  Boil some Asian egg noodles to just tender.  Then toss with oil, salt and black pepper and saute in a separate wok or skillet, adding a tiny bit of soy sauce if desired.

I love making this recipe. I usually add red pepper flakes for extra spice and a little sweet and sour sauce to the mix as the oyster sauce can be over powering. I also usually add veggies such as sweet peppers or broccoli. Omit pork and use veg. stock for a vegitarian dish. Tastes great garnished with fresh corriander.

Very good sauce for stir fry.  I skipped the pork, added broccoli, doubled the sauce as others recommended.  Next time I would reduce soy sauce as it could use a little less salt.  Thanks!   update: I have used this sauce a number of times, doubling all ingredients but the soy sauce.  I also used shrimp instead of the pork, which came out wonderfully.

I'm trying to cut back on my meat consumption so I substituted broccoli, red pepper and mushrooms for the pork. Other than that I followed this as written. I really liked the sauce portion of this. Just enough flavor without being heavy.

I liked this a lot and will make again.  I backed off on chili paste because my kids won't eat anything with too much heat.  If you do too you'll still get great results because the flavor is simply excellent.  Don't omit the cashews and onions; the crunch they add is great.

This is a good recipe for tofu... the pork makes the tofu taste less bland and the sauce is very good.  I added some broccoli as vegetables and I doubled the sauce.

Wonderful! I didn't have any oyster sauce, so I substituted 2 tsp fish sauce.  I also added 1 chopped white onion, 1/2 lb fresh snow peas and used 3/4 lb ground pork in place of the chops.  Thanks for a great recipe that I'll make over and over!

Yummy!  I halved the chili garlic sauce.  I also found the sauce a bit salty so I will tweak the soy sauce next time.

This is such a great recipe! I made the vegetarian version of this (no pork, no oyster sauce, and veggie stock instead of chicken broth) and it was quick, simple, and delicious. I will be making it again, and probably for other people as well.  Thanks motherof5...

So delicious! The sauce is yummy and I make this at least a few times a month. The recipe is perfect as is, but you can definitely make your own modifications with great success. Next time I will double the sauce b/c it is soooo gooood! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was excellent.    I didn't have garlic chili paste (just chili paste).  I added extra fresh garlic, to compensate (you can never have too much garlic!).  We are not pork fans, so I used chicken breast (one large chicken breast) instead.  It tasted great!

This was the first time I attempted to make a tofu dish, and the entire family really enjoyed it.  The only changes I made to the recipe as written was to double the sauce, and increase both the chopped green onions and the cashews to 1/2 cup, which I stirred directly into the sauce before serving.  We will definitely be making this again!

I liked this recipe very much.  It is easy to make and pretty tasty.  I would not cut the chili sauce or soy sauce and would probably increase the ginger because I thought it could use a bit more flavor. I'd also let the tofu soak in the broth mixture before cooking it.
I will definately make again - perhaps adding mushrooms and shredded carrots to the pot next time.

I love tofu and thought this had a very pleasant flavor.  However there wasn't enough sauce for the rice and "something" was missing.  I won't be making this again.  Thanks, anyway!

Unfortunately, I couldn't find oyster paste and the Asian market was closed. I added more garlic, ginger and chili paste. I used stir fry noodles (cooked before in sesame oil) and added at the very end. I ended up mixing in more cashews & green onions too- YUM!!! Took a bit longer than anticipated, but makes a lot and is delicious. Perfect heat for a cold winter night.

This was absolutely superb!  Our family all enjoyed - I think the type of chili/garlic sauce will basically affect the overall flavor, so just season to taste.  Thanks for a truly enjoyable dish that we'll enjoy again for sure.  I'm thinking chicken, beef.....beef and shrimp.........any combination with other vegetables would be great.  We had this with brown rice and stir fried green beans with mushrooms.  A true winner!

Tasty flavor, But I needed to almost double the sauce. I also found the texture lacking. It was too soft. I added thinly cut bell pepper strips and a can of sliced water chestnuts. I think the additions much improved the dish. Next time I think I will try adding fresh green beans and use minced pork.

Definitely too salty, may not need to use the chicken broth and could just use water instead?

We tried this recipe last night without the tofu, mainly for the sauce, It is probably the best sauce we've ever had on pork. Thank-you.

I doubled the sauce on this and LOVED it. It was great the next day, too. I pressed the tofu much longer than 30 minutes so it really absorbed the flavor of the pork. I also used Hawaiian soy sauce, which has a better flavor in my opinion, not painfully salty. Delicious.

Pretty good. This was my first time trying tofu, and i thought it ok.  I really like the sauce on this recipe except I would use low sodium soy sauce next time.  Also I doubled the sauce for the recipe.  I only gave three stars b/c this recipe would be boring without adding the veggies we did.  I added broccoli and thought it added alot.  Mushrooms would be good in it too.

My 4 year old has decided she doesn't want to eat animals and I'm trying to support that choice although the rest of us still eat meat.  It's been hard trying to find recipes that she likes that will provide her protein.  While this isn't meatless (the pork flavor adds a LOT to the taste!), after I make it, I just gave her the tofu and her 2 year old brother the pork pieces and they were both happy.  Plus my husband and I both liked it.  I added snap peas and green peppers, used 4 oz ground pork, and increased chicken broth by 1/4 cup and it was great!  I did place the tofu between dinner plates for and hour or two to squeeze out the water, which makes all the difference- the half dozen tofu recipes I tried before learning that trick of drying the tofu were yucky.

This was really good and simple.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I had to use beef broth, because I was out of chicken broth.  Also, I would add the garlic and ginger a minute or two before finishing cooking everything, because they burned the bottom of the pan.  Personally I really like the taste of the tofu again, so I would make it again with double the tofu and omit the pork.  My boyfriend likes meat, so using pork tenderloin in stir fry is great because the meat is tender and low in fat.  I just like tofu stir fries better, but good recipe nonetheless.

Very good and flavorful. The pork and tofu goes well together. Instead of 2 tablespoons of soy sauce I used 1 1/2 tablespoon.

This was a good recipe. The combination of the pork and ginger made the tofu dish more flavorful. I did add chopped white onions (stir-fried with the garlic and ginger) and spinach at the end for more nutrition, and it was delicious.  My husband loved it also, so we'll definitely make it again.

I made this for my 1 year old cause she likes tofu and we don't, so I left out anything spicy and the nuts of course.  I added green beans and peas so she would get her veggies.  When it was done, I tasted it and YUM!  I might actually like tofu now!  I would love to try this with everything exactly as the recipe reads.

I have absolutely hated tofu in the past, but this recipe has changed my mind. I agree that there is something missing taste-wise (not sure what though) but this dish has a great combination of flavors and textures. I served it over Vietnamese flat rice noodles. Really good. Thanks!

Excellent!I would however, fry the tofu whole before slicing it. Much easier than turning over the tofu slices.

Very good, the cashews are a nice touch. After cooking the pork, I removed it from the pan, sweated down some kale, then the garlic & ginger. Also doubled the sauce and then served over brown rice. A big hit with the kids.

Although tofu is not my favorite protein, this sauce is amazing and compliments shrimp, chicken or beef.

I doubled the recipe except for the tofu, cut out the pork, and added a ton of veggies: 1/2 a head  of cauliflower, 2 green zucchinis, 1 carrot, 1/2 red bell pepper. I pan-fried the tofu ahead of time so they would keep their shape better. Then I made the sauce mixture and added the carrots first, then cauliflower, and then the other veggies (bc carrots need the most time to cook). Then I put the tofu in at the end. Also added some peanut butter to add another flavor dimension. I only gave 4 stars bc I changed it so much, but it was delicious!

Excellent.  Had left over tofu and a pork chop so I searched and found this recipe.  Adjusted it for two servings, then found I was out of oyster sauce.  So I substituted hoisin sauce then added about 1/2 tsp of fish sauce.    The sauce was excellent, but next time I will use oyster sauce to compare.  Definitely will make this again.  I cooked some edamame

I made this last week. I copied what someone else did and used a pork tenderloin and cut it into strips. I also cut the soy in half and added in some broccoli, shredded carrots, and potato slices. I like to beef things up lol. The sauce turned out perfect! Served over white rice. Delicious recipe, I definitely recommend it. Now that I have come across this again, I might have to make it tonight. It never gets old.

I omitted the pork and added carrots, broccoli, cauliflower and mushrooms. After everything was cooked I added a tiny bit of sesame oil. The sauce is delicious!
