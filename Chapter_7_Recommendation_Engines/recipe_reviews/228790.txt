These have a good flavor. I only used a good sized sweet potato and that was just right for the spice mix. I think it depends on the different sizes of potatoes. I didn't put salt in the mix...just sprinkled with kosher salt before baking according to what I thought was the right amount. My oven only took 25 min. depends on your oven. I'm wondering if deep frying and then baking a few minutes in the spice mix would make a more sturdy fry. Worth a shot because they are tasty but very soft.

Ok.  Quite disappointed.  :(
the seasonings were right for the sweet potatoes, however, too much ended up on my very thinly cut potatoes, by the time they were 'done', they were too mushy to be like 'fries', so maybe I over cooked them?

My family loved these and I will definitely make them again.  I did not add the salt and I cut them to the 1/4 inch as specified.  I left them in the oven a little longer and they were perfect, crispy on the outside.

If you try this recipe, DO NOT add any salt!  I reduced the amount given in the recipe, but the salt still was overpowering.  The fries were soggy; the coating impossible to apply evenly.

These were not a good consistency, just seemed mushy.  Somehow they need to be crispier.  Way too much salt, too, even after reducing from 1 tablespoon to about 2 tsp.

Waaaay disappointed! The sweet mixture sounded good but the addition of so much salt totally ruined them! They were mushy and way way too salty.

I used 2 large sweet potatoes just like the recipe called for but this was so over seasoned and mushy we couldn't even eat it. I tried to save it by throwing them in a colander and trying to rinse off the seasonings and then reheated in the oven but it had already soaked in.

Those salt & cinnamon amounts HAVE TO be typos. I wouldn’t put that much salt in a huge pot of soup, let alone this small snack. After reading reviews, I opted to leave the salt and ginger out altogether, and reduced the cinnamon to one tsp. I also used 2 Tblsp brown sugar in place of white to get that glazed taste. I believe the mushiness is caused by the potatoes soaking up too much butter, so next time I’ll cut them thicker and reduce the butter amount as well.

It was like eating a loaded baked sweet potato, loved it. I used a dash of salt in the recipe, with the required amounts and it only covered 1 of the 2 thinly cut sweet potatoes. I had to make another glaze (bath) for the next potato. Also if you increase the time to 45 minutes you will have your crunchy fries.
