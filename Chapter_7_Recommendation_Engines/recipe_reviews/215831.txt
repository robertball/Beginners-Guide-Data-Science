I love stuffed stuff, so when I saw this I had to make it.  I put onions in it not thinking about what I was doing. Still really good.  The chicken was juicy and the flavors were popping.  We served it over pasta, that made this meal perfect.

I absolutely love stuffed chicken breast and thought this was an excellent variation! I dont follow the ingredients to the exact measurement, mostly by taste and what i prefer and it turned out FANTASTIC. the only things i added were: sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh ones, added a little parsley and some jarred sliced eggplant in spiced oil

Meh. We ate it, but not something I would make again.
