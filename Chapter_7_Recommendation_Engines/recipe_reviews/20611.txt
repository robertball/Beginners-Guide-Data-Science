This recipe was great...with a little tweaking.  After reading the other reviews, I realized that it was going to need a little extra flavor.  So, I pounded out the chicken breasts until they were thin, and then dipped them in egg and coated one side of the brests with a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of italian seasoned bread crumbs and grated parmesan cheese.  I quickly fried the breaded sides in a skillet with olive oil and then spooned on the cheese/spinach mixture rolled them up and baked them.  They were a hit!  Oh, and only make 1/2 of the cheese mixture....otherwise it just goes to waste.

This is a great recipe for when you are having company over.  It is so easy to prepare ahead of time.  I made a few slight changes.  Being a garlic lover I used 3 large cloves instead of 1 and finely diced it.  I made sure to use chopped frozen spinach rather than whole leaf.  Once thawed I squeezed out the access juice and actually ran my knife through it some more to ensure smaller pieces.  I added 1/4 cup of shredded (not grated) Parmesan cheese to the filling for that extra punch of flavor and seasoned it with salt and pepper to taste.  Finally, the trick to not having extra filling is to use 6 large chicken breasts instead of 4 (make sure they are thick).  When it was time to fill them...I didn't cut it open along the side and close them with toothpicks.  Instead, I created a pocket by cutting a 1" slit on the top of the thickest part of the breast by using a long fillet knife.  Once inside I ran my knife side to side...careful not to puncture any holes.  I then stuffed it with the mixture by pushing it in with my thumb (be sure not to overstuff) or you can be fancy and pipe it in if you wish.  Doing it this way eliminates the need for toothpicks.  As for the sauce...I simmered it first with fresh chopped basil before pouring it over the chicken breasts to bake.  This gives a jarred sauce new life and a fresh homemade taste.  Serve it with a vegetable medley and warm sliced Italian bread.  Everyone will love it!

This was very yummy.  First as with all chicken-I marinated in buttermilk all day(1cup milk 1 TBS vinegar or lemon juice if no buttermilk) for that extra moistness.  For the cheese stuffing I added extra garlic, fresh basil, and fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I stuffed chicken and baked covered for 35-40 minutes and removed foil and sprinkled more mozzerella cheese on top and baked an additional ten minutes.  Will def make again but BEWARE you do really only need like half the cheese filling.  I used five large breasts and stuffed them pretty good and had lots of filling left over.

This recipe was amazing!  It is now one of my families favorites!  I did find that it was easier to pound out my chicken thin and wrap it around the filling as opposed to cutting a slit in the chicken and stuffing it that way.

This turned out incredible! I had some heavy cream I wanted to finish so I made "Alfredo Sauce" (Rebecca Swift) from this site instead of the spaghetti sauce. From reading the reviews, I knew that there would be extra stuffing, so I filled some pasta shells, topped them with the alfredo sauce, covered with tin foil and baked at the same time for 45 minutes. In the stuffing, I doubled the garlic and added some italian seasoning. I waited to sprinkle the extra mozzarella until the last 5 minutes. My husband said that this was the best thing I've ever made!  I did have a little trouble cutting the chicken for the stuffing; I didn't want to use the toothpicks so I used a method from another reviewer (CHEFBAUER) of cutting down into the thickest part, then running the knife from side to side. I'm sure it will be easier next time.

This is a great "starter" recipe! I used bone-in chicken breast, took the skin off and let it marinate in Italian dressing while I was at work. I used 3 cloves of roasted garlic, and a little less than half of a sweet onion and put it in my mini chopper. I let the spinach cook with the garlic and onion and then added thinly sliced baby portobello mushrooms and Italian seasonings,onion powder, etc. I then mixed the spinach mixture in a bowl with low fat ricotta cheese and mozzarella- I left out the egg. I stuffed my chicken with this mixture, put it in a baking pan covered it with foil and baked @ 350 for 30 min- then I uncovered the chicken poured the sauce over it and baked it for 25 min.- then finally I topped the chicken with a slice of mozzarella and baked 10 min until cheese melted.  This was FANTASTIC!!! Everyone loved it. I can not stress enough how good this was- I can't wait to make it again, Enjoy!!

Good recipe.. I made a few changes to suit my own taste.  I added more garlic to the cheese mixture. I used an Italian blend shredded cheese I also and 1/4 cup of freshly grated parmasean cheese in the cheese mixture. I sauted chopped mushrooms in olive oil and garlic and added it to the cheese mixture as well. I pounded the chicken breasts and placed the filling in the middle and rolled the breast. I secured the breast with toothpics. I also ended up with extra filling so I took the advice of others and stuffed manacotti shells with the remaining mixture.  I baked both dishes inthe oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes (until the cheese starts to get golden brown around the edges).

This was quite tasty.  I'm giving it 4 stars because it really did make too much stuffing (even though I halfed the recipe!), and I had to "add" to it so the stuffing wasn't so bland... but it was a very good base for a stuffing recipe, and I would make it again.

I used fat-free ricotta, and this worked well.

I used fresh spinach (about half a bag, still too much).  I first poored a little bit of olive oil in a pan, and sauted 2 garlic cloves and chopped up mushrooms.  I then added the spinach and tossed and cooked about 3 minutes. I let that cool, and added that mixture to the ricotta.

Hint... "true" Italians use nutmeg in their cooking... I always add a little to any ricotta mixture, and it is delicious... for this, I added about 3 dashes.  Try it, you won't be disappointed :)

Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great!  Make sure you get the chopped spinach - My grocery store only carried whole frozen spinach, so it was a little stemmy.  Instead of butterflying my chicken I pounded it flat and rolled up the cheese in it.  (This also makes the chicken cook in about 30 minutes).  I put the extra cheese into Jumbo pasta shells, poured some spaghetti sauce on them and put the two dishes in the oven together (in separate pans).  They were both done in 30 minutes and my husband loved it!

This was a fantastic dinner idea!! Used a cup and 1/2 of fresh, shredded spinach (no stems) and due to lack of ricotta cheese available, I used parmesean cheese.  Worked out great.  With the amount of "stuffing," I was able to fill 5 chicken breasts.  Will be making this great recipe again! Thanks Maria!!

Omg!  This was so good. After reading the reviews....The changes I made to it was seasoning my chicken with Italian season, seasoning salt, black pepper,  onion powder, garlic powder and garlic salt. I also used Hunt's Garlic and Onion spaghetti sauce. (You will have left over mixture/stuffing).....With the left over mixture I added some finely chopped (cooked) Italian sausage to it and stuffed some jumbo shell pasta. Pour some spaghetti sauce over the pasta and sprinkle some cheese and TADAAA you have a delicious meal?????Super easy and quick

TIP...If your chicken breast are thin it will be better to roll them instead of making the slit.

Very delicious if you season your chicken right. I personally love flavors and if you only season with salt and pepper, it seems to be a bit on the blander side. I pounded my chicken, seasoned with garlic, adobo, sazon, pepper, and Italian seasoning (It seems like a lot seasoning but I did just a pinch of each so that it wouldn't be too salty). And as far as my spinach stuffing, I added extra garlic and infused it with just a little bit of slt and pepper. I will make this again and again. Did I mention the presentation is lovely too?!?! Great for guests.

Just finished eating this fabulous dinner!  YUMMMMMMMMY! This recipe is versatile (adjusting garlic, cheeses to your liking) and still remains very true to the recipe.  As others suggested I added sauted garlic and some parm. cheese to ricotta mix.  Be sure to use the eggs, it keep the filling IN the chicken!  Flattened out chicken, stuffed them full, covered with sauce; fastened them closed with toothpicks.  Baked them for 45 mins....sprinkled with mozz and more parm, back in oven for 15 mins.  My fiance and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe!!! It will be a regular around here.

SO DELICIOUS!!! I am on a low calorie diet so I had to make some changes.  I only used half of the ingredients for the filling and used low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta and 2% mozzarella, and only one egg to cut down on the calories.  I also only used 2/3 of the spaghetti sauce and that was MORE than enough sauce.  I also thought it might be a bit bland as it is so I added salt/pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and parsley to the mixture. I brought the calorie count down to 406 per serving saving myself from ingesting 172 calories!!!!

This is super yummyful!  I always have to double the recipe to make enough for my family.  Don't worry about having extra filling, just stuff jumbo shells with it for dinner the next night :)
Next time I will add bacon and cook spinach before adding it to the recotta mixture, other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

Family loved it.  I did make a few changes because of personal choice.  I used the thin fancy cut chicken breasts (easier) which I marinated in italian dressing.  I dipped in egg and coated  with italian bread crumbs and quick fried them for two minutes on each side in olive oil.  In the stuffing I used fresh spinach, added a can of diced tomates with green peppers and onions and a small can of mushrooms.  I put all of this in the food processor and then sauteed in pan.  Seasoned ricotta mixture with oregono and italian seasonings and added parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Left out the eggs. Used Ragu Chunky Gardenstyle Tomato, Garlic & Onion (family favorite) for sauce.  Being the chicken had been pan fried, it was a little harder to roll.  Did about 9 breasts and still had stuffing left over. I just put the extra stuffing in the pan alongside the chicken, poured the sauce over everything, covered and cooked for about 35 minutes.  Uncovered and added mozzarella cheese on top. Cooked for additional 10 minutes. Served over spaghetti.  Family and guests raved!  Everyone enjoyed it.

Amazing, fabulous, will definitely make again.  Based on the feedback of others, I pounded the chicken, used a very spicy arrabiata sauce, and used 6 large chicken breasts.  It took longer to cook (due to the size of breasts and I really stuffed them to the limit), but in the end it was scrumptious!!!

Invited the girls over for a cooking date, this dish was a hit! We combined a few recipes, therefore prep time was 45 mins, ikes! Chicken was marinated night before w/lemon, s&p, onions, garlic, paprika, chilli flakes, thyme. Instead of cutting, we actually flattened the chicken breast, by: placing chicken on cutting board, covered with saran wrap, and took my IKEA $5 mallet and beat the heck out of the breast until it was about a 1/4" thin. 

As for filling: Combined 1/2 cup of ricotta and 1 egg (yolk), mixed in 1/2 cup of mozzeralla cheese and 1 tblspn of grated parmesan cheese. Added s & p pepper and pinch of nutmeg. Added cooled spinach that was cooked in a skillet with butter (med heat), 1 tbspn of chopped onion and 3 cloves garlic for 3 - 5 mins before adding spinach, parsley and basil. We took filling, added to the middle of breast and rolled, using toothpicks to secure. We melted 1-2 tbspns of butter in the meantime.

Breading: In a shallow baking dish we put about 1 cup of bread crumbs, seasoned with a little more black pepper and thyme (yes, lots of kick to our final product:)...Caribbean background;). We then took a basting brush, dipped it in the melted butter & covered over the stuffed breast. Then we took the chicken breast and dipped in bread crumbs. 

We warmed up sauce, with yes, a little more seasoning and allowed it to simmer for the 40 mins while chicken baked. We then added sauce after 40 mins, and then covered with shredded mozerella cheese.

This is a fantastic dish which is easy to make and a greeat dish for company! I used fresh (stem removed) spinach for a fresher taste and would recommend pounding the chicken flat and rolling it up in the cheese mixture instead of butter-flying it. This reduces the cooking time and keeps the chicken moist and tender. I’ll be cooking this one again and again…..!

LOVED this.  I took the advice of an earlier review and did a light breading of italian seasoned croutons/bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  This was INCREDIBLE.  By far one of my favorite recipes.

Both my wife (less adventurous) and I (more adventurous) really liked this recipe and will make this recipe on a regular basis. This recipe would be an excellent choice for entertaining as well. I read the reviews and follow a few suggestions, such as tenderizing the chicken, I did not make a pocket, but rolled it. Anyway you do it will be good in my opinion. Thanks Maria.

This is almost a weekly meal for my husband and i.  i use cottage cheese instead of ricotta and along with the mozzarella i add shredded asiago and romano, i also use a large handful of fresh flat leaf spinach instead of frozen, and finely chopped red onion.  i also add dried oregano, basil and thyme.  As far as the left over mixture, i spread that right on top of each chicken breast and instead of pouring the whole jar of spaghetti sauce i pour only enough to cover the breasts then top with mozzarella.  When i used the whole jar the sauce was way too thin after baking.  i warm the remainder of the jarred sauce on the stove top, doll it up with whatever i have on hand and serve that over pasta.  It's definitley one of our favorites.

Amazing!!! I made this the other night and it was a big hit! I added mushrooms to the cheese mixture just because I love mushrooms and they add a great flavor. Only make half of the cheese mixture. A whole batch is just way too much. I made my own tomato sauce and added sauteed mushrooms on the top before serving! Delicious!!

I'm a vegetarian, but I made this about two week ago for my boyfriends mother who had just had back surgery and couldn't get out to get food or make her own.  I meant to take a picture of the finished product but my boyfriend ate it while i went to find my camera and he's not a fan of chicken, but the combination of sauce and cheese was enough to win him over.  I did change a few things,      tripled the garlic     breaded the chicken after salting and peppering it first as someone else suggested      I baked it first for half the time without the sauce the added the sauce and cheese.       I also added Parmesan cheese to the stuffing for more taste.    Like others i had leftover stuffing , but i don't see a way around that as the smallest package of ricotta is 15oz so just have some manacotti or shells on had to finish off your stuffing.    I do plan to make this again for a special occasion or party or whatever pops up.  It is very easy and you can make it ahead of time.

10+ stars with a few minor changes. Tomato sauce?? No way, homemade alfredo sauce (1/4 roasted garlic, 1/4 c butter, 1 c heavy cream,whisk over med heat 5 minutes and then add fresh black pepper and 1& 1.2 c fresh shredded parm cheese, whisk a few minutes more)I tried stuffing and cutting a pocket and also flattening and then rolling. I will flatten and stuff and roll, easiest and filling remains. I used my blended and put ricc cheese, 2c mozz, spinach,3 T fresh basil,2 cloves garlic,eggs, 1t italian seaso, pepper and 2 dashes nutmeg, blended. Marianted chicken in buttermilk also for 5 hours 1st. baked 45 minutes covered and 15 uncovered. Served with penne pasta and alfredo sauce

This was amazingly good! I used homemade sauce and I coated the chicken breasts in grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder and black pepper. I also added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese to the spinach mixture. I made the full amount of this mixture which was enough for 5 large chicken breasts. I baked it for 1 hour. During the last 15 minutes of baking I topped it with the mozzarella. I highly recommend this recipe!

I thought this recipe was excellent! I didn't bake it though. It was to hot in this month of August to turn my oven on and heat the house up so I cooked it in my electric skillet. I layered my skillet with boneless chicken, poured the ricotta cheese mixture over it and then I added the pasta sauce. Just before it was done I sprinkled cheese over it. It was also easier to make it casserole style instead of having to roll / stuff the chicken. It was a hit with my family!

This was very easy and tasty, but I didn't understand why it only called for salt and pepper... thus, I used an Italian Seasoning mix. Also, I cut the recipe in 1/2 for 3 large chicken breasts and it still made WAY too much stuffing... I'm saving the rest for stuffed shells next week. At least the hubby was happy and asked me to make it again. Next time, I'll add mushrooms!

This was fantastic.  I used CarbOptions spaghetti sauce and added 1 lb browned ground sirloin and a can of mushrooms to the sauce before pouring it over the stuffed chicken.  I also used more garlic in the stuffing since I love garlic, and added some shredded parmesan/asiago/romano mix into it!  Added some garlic powder to the sauce too.  I surrounded the chicken breasts with the extra stuffing and poured the sauce over everything and the mix was to die for.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this, and he couldn't believe something so rich was low in carbs!  We each had a chicken breast and some of the surrounding stuffing/sauce mix.  Thanks for the great recipe!  (I'd add more cheese on top next time - I like the way it adds flavor to the dish when it's browned)

This recipe was very good. But, its too much stuffing left over.  I used 6 chicken breast, next time I will either use more chicken breast or cut the ingredients.  Don't put the cheese on the top at the beginning (it will burn) until 2-4 minutes before it's time for the chicken breast to come out of the oven.  Other than that A very good family meal.  Taste real good if served with Texas Toast.

This was a hit with my boyfriend. He even called his Mother to rave about my cooking later that evening. I used spaghetti sauce from a jar. And, I served the baked chicken with homemade tortellini. The stuffing made a wonderful compliment to the pasta. I will definitely add this recipe to my “favorites” list.

My husband liked this a lot more than me, although I couldn't get him to take the leftovers for lunch the next day, lol. I found the chicken to be a bit dry and chewy, and it wasn't done all the way through after the recipe's prescribed amount of time. I ended up just eating the sauce and cheese and not any of the chicken because it was so rubbery.

This is a good receipe and would be appropriate for a dinner party, served with penne pasta.

I made my own sauce though which included stewed tomatoes, tomatoe paste, olive oil, red wine, red pepper flakes, basil, oregano and garlic. I think that would solve the problem of 'lacking spice' that others mentioned. The jarred sauces never have enough flavor.

This recipe was really good.  We had it for our Sunday dinner.  It was easier than I ever imagined stuffed chicken being.  Next time I think I will change the amount of spinach to about half of the amount called for.  It made a little bit of a bitter taste but not too noticeable.  I couldn't find any ricotta at the local store so I used small curd cottage cheese and it turned out great.  I will probably add 1/2 more the amount of mozarella next time around.  I agree with the other reviews, the stuffing is enough for double the amount of chicken.  I have to freeze my excess.  But I will definatley make this again.  Thanks Maria!

The whole family really enjoyed this! 

I beat the chicken under some saran wrap to even it out and spread a nice layer of the filling on top and rolled it. I made the filling as suggested minus one egg and minced three cloves of garlic. I melted some butter with the remaining garlic and brushed that over one side. After rolling and toothpicking it to hold it together, I patted a little bit of panko crumbs around it and seasoned with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder. Didnt use the spaghetti sauce but otherwise baked as directed. 

I didnt fry the panko and I probably should have but just when the chicken was about done, I broiled it just enough to crisp up the crumbs, added a little mozzerella and baked another minute or so. Manicotti meets chicken...totally delicious! 

I am thinking next time I might try it with a spinich dip like filling with the ricotta and see if that might work?

Excellent recipe. Very easy to make. Cut into large chunks and serve with your favorite pasta. Have plenty of leftovers! Will make one suggestion though.  Add sauce halfway through cooking time and drain any excess liquid from chicken.  This will prevent the sauce from being runny.  This will also ensure the chicken is cooked entirely.  I may flatten the chicken breasts next time I make this and add some chopped mushrooms to the mix.

This was good, but not astounding, like I expected. I did make a few changes, though. First of all, I used 3 cloves garlic. I also made half the amount of stuffing the recipe called for, and only used about half of that...there is no way I'd be able to fit it all in.

YUM! I breaded the chicken before stuffing. The recipe had to be doubled because of my large family, so there were plenty of "stuffing" mix left.  I will be making a small lasagna with the leftovers.

Needed more seasoning....and like others said, wayyy less ricotta/spinach mixture. I ended up using only 1/2. It was a good base...you just need to jazz it up some. I'd add hot pepper flakes...maybe breadcrumbs to the chicken breasts itself...more garlic.

I would have given it five stars but my family complained it was missing salt and hebs/spices. Basically lacking flavour. The chicken was very juicy however. Although I did have to bake much longer than directed. Loved the ricotta and spinach idea.

Yummy! After reading the reviews, I only made half the filling and that was just enough. I also pounded the chicken thin, put the filling inside and rolled it up. That way I only needed to cook it for 30 minutes. Although it tasted good, I think the filling could do with some extra flavour. Another reviewer suggest italian seasoning and I think that would go really well.

It was very good. However, i left out the eggs and used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also let the chicken breast marinate for a few hours. It turned out great and it was easy to make.

This was an easy and delicious recipe.  I had left over filling, so I froze it and was able to make it again very easliy.  This is a keeper.

This was very tasty and easy.  I too made a couple of changes.  I used Feta instead of mozzarella.  Also I added nutmeg to the filling.  To me nutmeg and spinach go together like Q and u.  I topped the sauce with Parmesan.    I too had a load of extra filling.  My solution was to add a package of stuffing mix (or make about two cups worth of your own ) and to pour it into an oiled bread pan to cook with the chicken.  It makes a wonderful side dish or even main meal for another day.

OMG!  This was soooo good.  My husband and I totally enjoyed this dish.  The only change I made was to use fresh steamed spinach which I had on hand.  As a side dish, I cooked some thin spaghetti and added the additional sauce on top.  This is restaurant quality.  Marie you outdid yourself.  Thanks for this great recipe.  I will be passing it along to others.

I accidently took out chicken strips instead of chicken breasts, so I layered the chicken on the bottom, spread out the ricotta/spinach mixture then topped with sauce and cheese.  It baked for about 30 minutes and was done.  It definitely was bland, even with the extra garlic and italian seasonings I added.  If I do it again, I would increase the garlic even more, add some onion, pepper and more Italian seasonings.

This chicken is amazing...I have tweaked it alittle...I use thin chicken butterfly breasts from the grocery store instead of regular chicken breasts. Instead of just placing them in the oven in a casserole dish i have found that wrapping them in tinfoil individually and cooking them that way doesn't really dry the chicken out. I use a basic white sauce to pour over them and presto a fabulous dinner with either pasta, potatoes, rice....people think you have slaved all day prepping this scrumptous dinner....thank you :)

I thought the premise behind this was very good. However I thought the chicken needed some seasoning. I sprinkled the chicken with salt, pepper and a small amount of onion powder both inside and out. I also sauteed some onion and garlic and then added two large bags of fresh spinach to the onion mixture and sauteed until very little moisture was left. I baked the chicken in a homemade alfredo sauce as my boyfriend doesn't like marinara. Overall I enjoyed the dish and would make again.

This is SO DELICIOUS!!! I have only made it twice now, but I'm sure it will become a staple at our dinner table.  I made it for guests the very first time I made it and they were so impressed and thought I was a gourmet chef! Thank you for the recipe!

I like to try new things and this sounded like it would be good.  I was a little leary about spaghetti sauce on chicken but it was really good.  This actually tasted like a chicken lasagna without the pasta.  I think next time I will do as other reviewers said and add the spaghetti sauce and mozz. cheese about half way through cooking.  Made great leftovers.  I will definitely make it again!

My husband loved this dish! After reading reviews, I used fresh chopped spinach. I sauteed it in olive oil with some garlic, onion and yellow bell pepper. The chicken can be fixed any way...rolling with toothpicks, cutting in half, or just one chicken breast on top of the other.

I was a little nervous about trying this after reading all of the other reviews about the flavor and all. However, I  like to try recipes "as-is" before adding or taking anything away because everyone's taste buds are different. This recipe is delicious, and my husband agrees. I served it over egg noodles becuase that's the only pasta that I had at the time. There is a lot of filling left over, but as others advised you can use the extra to make something else. It was great. Wouldn't change a thing. I would definitely advise to try it as-is before making any alterations.

This is my new favorite chicken recipe!  We left out the egg (didn't want it) and spinach (didn't have it).  We added fresh basil, steamed broccoli (finely chopped) and sun-dried tomatoes.  We also used our homemade marinara recipe.  It was beyond fantastic!  Definitely halve the filling as the others reviews suggested and enjoy!

I didn't know if my husband would like this but he really did. He is my food critique. : )

I pounded the chicken breasts fairly thin and sprinkled with Adobo (salt/pepper blend). Then I added the filling and rolled them up. I did add a little minced garlic and basil to the cheese mixture. I made the Best Marinara Sauce yet to serve over them. And I also piped the leftover filling into manicotti shells. It was a great, complete meal that I baked all together in a 9x13 baker. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My husband LOVED this.  He said we need to have this many more times.  I made a few alterations.  I added about 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese to the stuffing, dipped mine in an additional beaten egg and coated with Italian Style bread crumbs, baked for 40 minutes, added sauce and remaining mozarella cheese and had stuffed chicken parmesan

Scrumptious!  Instead of slitting the breasts, I pounded them out, then rolled them around the filling.  I also used 6 oz. of cream cheese instead of ricotta.  A jar of mild 3-cheese&tomato spaghetti sauce works well with this.

whassup maria! this recipe was great.  i'm a college student with four male roommates, everyone was digging on the flavor.  did need some spice, though.  and stuffing the breasts turned out to be some serious comic relief!

Made it for dinner tonight. Halfed the recipe ( kids at Granna's), used fresh Trader Joes spinach and ricotta,  also added parmesan cheese. My husband rarely eats anything I cook, but he loved this. Will definitely make again.

This is a really good recipe. I had 6 chicken breasts, so I went ahead and made the full amount of "stuffing" and it was STILL WAY TOO MUCH. Definitely will half that part of the recipe next time like other people say to!
I also did what another reviewer did and rolled the chicken with egg, parmesean cheese, and crumbs while cooking it a little bit, then stuffed it with the recipe stuffing + more parmeasean and extra garlic. Other than that, cooked for 55 minutes and served over spaghetti. Was very tasty and will probably make it again!

I followed others advice and I used 3 cloves of garlic and added italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.  I also sliced the top of the chicken breast and made a deep pocket for the cheese so I didn't have to use toothpicks.  I added the extra cheese on top of the chicken breasts and added fresh basil to the spaghetti sauce.

When I want a chicken meal that I can "set and forget" this is an obvious choice. It's fast and delicious. I have made this half a dozen times but always used fresh spinach or kale instead of frozen and it's still awesome. Thanks Maria

My husband LOVED this dish!  It was soo easy to prepare.  I had to roll my chicken as it was too small and thin of a breast to fill.  Also, the amount of filling depends on the size of chicken you're using.  I used half the recipe and still had too much.  I just added it to the sauce, which my hubby loved too. 

I didn't want to cook it for an hour in the oven (as I didn't have that much time)... so I cook it on medium heat in a covered saute pan for about 20 minutes, flipping my chicken once after 10 minutes, and it was completely cook.  Keep in mind that my chicken breasts were small and thin.  You might need to cook yours longer on the stove if the meat is bigger.  I liked that it didn't overheat my house having the oven on too. :)

Supper Yummy... it's already been demanded for company next weekend.

Turned out so moist and flavorful. I only used 1 egg and pounded the chicken breasts flat and then rolled up with cheese mixture. This will be a special treat of a meal for our family!

I breaded one side of the chicken, then fried it for 1 minute....this dish was still lacking flavor.  I should have breaded both sides along with salt and peppering all the chicken.  The cheese lacked flavor the most and I'm not sure what would have fixed that.  I used 1.25lbs of chicken tenders that I pounded out and rolled up.  They fit perfectly into a 2 quart casserole dish.  I cooked covered for 30 mins and uncovered for 20 mins....till an internal temperature of 160 degrees.

I did not use chicken. I used minute steak. I flatten the steak, seasoned it on both sides, put filing in center and wrapped it up using tooth picks to hold in place. Browned them, then baked in oven with spaghetti sauce. I boiled spaghetti,  then served the steak on top with more sauce. Everyone loved it.

Excellent - I have a family of 5 and everyone cleaned their plate!! The only thing I did differently was that I used homemade Alfredo sauce that I had left over, instead of the spaghetti sauce. By the way this turned out, I'm guessing the you can't go wrong with either sauce. This is definitely a family favorite now! Thank you for sharing!!

I had a dinner party last week for 8 of my friends in my tiny one bedroom apartment.  My original menu included an apple stuffed chicken breast as the main course, but after a trial run 2 days before the party I scrapped that idea and started looking for something a little more flavorful.  Having had my mother's ricotta stuffed shells many times as a child, this recipe really caught my eye.  It's very basic, so I was confident that a novice like me could handle it without too much trouble.  The day of the party came and I made this recipe exactly as it is on the website, doubling the quantities for my hungry friends.  I served it after a first course of Cream of Asparagus and before a dessert of Maple Creme Brulee, on a plate with slightly sweetened butternut squash and wild rice.  It was fantastic!  I asked for honest criticisms afterwards and didn't get a single suggestion for improvement.  I'll definitely be making this dish again.  Thanks, Maria!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used organic BLSL chicken breasts and they were on the smallish side.  So after I slit them open, there wasn't much space for the filling.  I did what I could with filling each breast, then smeared some more of the ricotta/spinach filling on top of the chicken breasts before I topped with spaghetti sauce.  Next time, I'll use more garlic and maybe some red pepper flakes for needed "heat".  But this was very easy and very delicious.  Thanks for a nice recipe, Maria.

This was pretty good, however there was double the amount of filling  actually needed. I froze the rest and am going to use it for stuffed shells.

Turned out wonderfully!  This recipe made a lot more stuffing than I needed.  Boneless Chicken Breasts are smaller than the halves the recipe calls for.  Oh well it looks like it's good stuffing for Calzones.

4.5 stars... Tastes like a stuffed shell with chicken instead of noodle.  Used fresh spinach, garlic & onion powder, touch of basil, & parmesan cheese in fillling.  Put extra filling atop & added just about 2/3c sauce over chicken (just enough to cover). Baked with sprayed foil atop (so cheese wouldn't stick) till last 15 or so minutes. Very moist.  Served with spaghetti (topped with remaining sauce) & green beans.

With a house full of diabetics, we are always looking for delicious, low carb meals - This a a great recipe, but a little bland. I switched some things the second time - ditched the chicken breast and grabbed a 3&1/2 lb pork loin/roast. Cut that the same way I had the chicken breast and stuffed the dickens out of it, then any remaining stuffing I put in front or behind it in a roasting pan for flavor in the sauce. Added around 3 hearty dashes of nutmeg to the stuffing and more garlic (I used powder- easier to season to taste), and topped with No sugar added Tomato and Basil Ragu Spaghetti sauce(go for the 1lb jar, you'll use it). It was wonderful and so easy. Cooked in 1&1/2 hours @350(covered) Side with mixed veggies.

Absolutely delish! I pounded the breast & rolled them around stuffing. Only changes were I upped the garlic (We love it) and threw in a few chopped & sauteed mushrooms & some parmesan. Served over buttered angel hair with parsley and reserved the remaining spinach mixture to make this again, which I most certainly WILL be doing!!!

Prepared this following the directions to the letter.  Only difference is I made 12 chicken Breasts.  This was excellent and I will continue to make this dish.  I also prepared a pasta side that complimented the chicken making a great meal for my family and friends.

The recipe makes too much filler, but it is tasty.  I'd add a bit more garlic.  We served it with penne and used the red sauce that dripped into the pan to pour over the pasta and give it a light sauce.

This made way too much filling!! I would definately use half of the filling for another meal like stuffed pasta shells.  I used all the filling by putting the leftover on top of the chicken but it was just too much.  Other than that the flavor of everything was good.  Would make again but either for 8 chicken breasts or with pasta shells for another meal.

Perfecto!!! This was great. My Husband thought it was the best ever. He always says that but it was fantastic. I followed some of the other tips given. Like pounding the breast. I also added parmisan to the mixture and topped it along with the Riccota before baking. I also added a little bit of Italian seasoned bread crumbs to mixture. Loved it! Thanks! Jen

All I can say is WOW! This recipe is awesome, I found it by luck.. because I was going to make almost the same thing with sour cream and without the sauce.. And I thought it would taste a little weird.. so I came across this recipe.. The reviews are very helpful. I put the chicken in a bowl and put a tablespoon of lemon juice in a measuring cup and filled it to one cup with milk. Let it sit there for 3 hours (I didnt have buttermilk). Also, I pounded the chicken till it was 1/2 inch thin and put the stuffing in the middle and put toothpicks to seal it. When it was cooked I took the toothpicks out and they kept there shape. I also halved the stuffing and it was more than enough. Drained cottage cheese because I didnt have ricotta, but it must be better! But this was A W E S O M E !

Very tasty...even the picky child ate it! The filling is what really makes this chicken recipe.  Next time I will only make 1/2 of the amount of filling since I had a lot left over.  Instead of using jarred spaghetti sauce I used Richard and Suzanne's Famous Spaghetti Sauce recipe.

So good! And happily, I too had left over stuffing and sauce and extra large pasta shells. Two great meals in one :) 
I buy my chicken breasts frozen, so when I thaw them out, I always put some Italian or Greek salad dressing in a ziploc bag with them, marinade and thaw at the same time.

I liked this recipe BUT it did require adjustments to make it delicious. I sauteed the spinach with a small onion in olive oil and added 3 cloves garlic, 1 tsp. basil, 1 tsp. Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper. I halved each chicken breast, topped it with spinach filling, rolled it up, and secured with toothpick. I found that, prepared this way, I wasn't able to taste the filling because it fell out while rolling...so I would recommend sticking to the original recipe directions.  I used the extra filling in manicotti shells, and THAT came out tasting like a restaurant entree.

I thought this was really delicious. I did add some Italian Seasoning and basil to the cheese mixture. I also only used one egg. The recipe makes a HUGE amount of stuffing. I could have stuffed 8 pieces of chicken with what I made. I'll cut it in half next time.

A KEEPER!! Got rave reviews from kids and adults.  As others, I did used fresh spinach sauted in olive oil with a little garlic and onion-(which was definitely worth the little extra time) WAY BETTER THAN FROZEN and added amazing flavor!! Chicken SOOO moist! Just plain delicious! **Was able to stuff 6 breasts and still have leftover stuffing.

Great recipe!  My family loved it -- even my husband who hates spinach!  I used fresh whole spinach and cooked it in garlic, onion, and olive oil until tender, then added as directed in the recipe. I didn't change anything else.  Great!

Delicious! I made a few personal changes...I only used 1/2 of the ricotta cheese and I added about 5oz of feta cheese. Also, I used 3 cloves of garlic, 2 while cooking the spinach, and the other when mixing the stuffing. I also altered my sauce a bit too; I sauted a red pepper and then put that in the blender with the pasta sauce...gives the sauce a very nice taste. I really suggest making this recipe. It will become one of my regulars! Oh, and I cooked the left over stuffing in a bowl in the oven for 15 min(while the chicken was cooking) and used it for a dip for bread/chips.

This was delicious, but I subsituted the ricotta cheese for cottage cheese (drained as much as you can) and cooked it in a creamy buttery sauce I made as I didn't have the tomato sauce that I thought I did and served it atop some egg noodles. It took a little while to cook, but other than that was easy to make. This makes a lot. I only had three chicken breasts and spread the rest around on top... and after four adults ate there was still one left over.

Excellent recipe, but the egg is not needed. The second time I made it I omitted the egg and spinach and used pesto sauce with penne. Great dish!

This recipe was perfect for the dinner party I hosted, it's really funny and easy to make. I did make a few changes, I bought a bag of frozen chicken and let it thaw in olive oil, fresh minced garlic and diced onion and used fresh spinach instead of canned or frozen and the taste was perfect. I will definitely make this again!

I sereved this with crab stuffed mushrooms and angel hair pasta tossed in a white wine and basil sauce. It was fabulous. My husband raved about it to his entire family and all of his friends. This is now a favorite in our home!

This was ok. With so many high ratings I was expecting more flavor from this dish. Like others stated, way too much filling. Also, too much spinach for our tastes.

This recipe was great for the whole family.  Instead of shredded mozarella, I used the fresh in water.  I sliced it and layed it in the chicken breast and put the stuffing on top.  Then I put another slice of mozarella on top of the  sauced breast. I had enough left over stuffing for three manicotti shells.  Delicious.

This cooked well, but made too much stuffing.  It tasted okay, but did not have much flavor.  It needs bread crumbs or parmesan, or maybe oregano or basil.  I will make it again, but I'm going to add more seasoning to it.

Excellent! I usually alter most recipes, but the only change I made was to use half of the ricotta in the recipe(dieting)and omitted the eggs. After reading the reviews, I made the entire batch of cheese-spinach recipe,stuffed the chicken breasts and mixed the rest of the spinach-cheese mixture with more sauce Poured the sauce over the chicken and baked for 45 minutes.Removed the chicken breasts to plates for serving and added rotini pasta to the sauce and served.Hubby had a "I'm not sure about this" look on his face when served, but a "YUM" compliment upon tasting.

My family of picky eaters were a little hesitant to try this, but LOVED it once they took a bite.  I used fresh spinich instead of the frozen and added additional cheeses with the feta.  It turned out so good, this will be sure to be a new family favorite.  Will definately make again.

I cut this recipe in half.  Even so, there was almost twice as much filling as I needed, so I just put it in the baking dish on the side.  Covered with pasta sauce, it all mixed together and tasted the same anyway.  This was good, but somehow not as good as I had hoped.  My husband really enjoyed it though, so we will definitely be having it again.

This is a great recipe.  Although I changed some parts.  I pounded the chicken flat and then rolled.  Looked kinda like a taco. I also didn't add as much spinach.  I had my parents over for dinner when I made this.  My dad and husband don't like spinach so I stuffed their chicken before I added the spinach.  I also added a few slices of deli ham on the chicken for them and then added the mixter (pre-spinach).  This was great and very tasty.  My mom and I had the spinach mixture and it was excellent.  Thumbs up all around the table.  Thanks Maria. Oh, by the way I had a few slices of ham leftover and spinach mixture so I rolled a couple of those up (no chicken)and threw them in the pan. Again so good and so easy.

This was very yummy! The only thing I would do differently next time is half the spinach; it was so overpowering (for my taste anyway). I also used the suggestion of someone else and used the leftover stuffing in shells. It was a very good meal.

I will definatly make this again.  Next time I will add some parm to the stuffing, use a little more garlic and marinate or season the chicken ahead of time.  Makes a great low carb dinner if you use low carb spaghetti sauce.

This recipe has been a hit with my family and friends! I have passed it on to a lot of people and they all rave about it! Set aside half of the spinach/cheese mixture and freeze it for the next time -- it's way too much as written!

Good recipe that looks harder than it was. I'd recommend adding much more garlic or onion as it does need a bit more flavor. I received rave reviews though - so thank you for the recipe.

The recipe was easy to follow, although I felt like all thumbs trying to stuff the chicken breasts and then put toothpicks in to hold together. Watch out for those toothpicks!! The chicken was moist and very flavorful. I made with pasta, but my husband and son had with french fries!! To each his own . . . I would recommend this recipe.

My family gave this 5 stars.  I did modify it though.  I used 1/2 package cream cheese instead of riccota, 1/2 the amount of motza cheese, 1/2 cup of sorrel instead of spinach and no eggs.  There was enough filling for 4 pounded out breasts.

I liked this recipe alot.  Since I read the other reviews before I made this chicken dish, I decided to add 1/4 c. freshly grated parm. cheese and a teaspoon or so of italian seasoning to the filling to add some flavor.  I'm glad I did b/c it came out great.  I, like other cooks, had lots of filling leftover so I decided to freeze it.  I really liked how this recipe was super easy.  I will definitely make it again.

This is really good.  There was, as others have said, enough to stuff five.  I love garlic, but, if you don't, you might want to chill on that.  Easier than expected, too.  We'll make this again!

This was very good. I added some garlic and onion powder to the chicken along with the salt and pepper. I served this over spaghetti with a Caesar salad and garlic toast on the side.

This was a good and easy recipe.  I cut out some of the spinach (personal preference) and I think I may  add some more spices to the ricotta cheese (again a personal preference).  My husband loved it, I'll definitely make again.

Very tasty dish! There seemed to be something missing though? Needs some kind of spice in with the ricotta. Not for the 3 year old in my house though!

Served this at a 50th anniversary party and everyone from 13 to 83 absolutely loved it. Your guests won't believe you, but this is a cinch to make. Only one problem. The reipe makes way more stuffing than you need.

I changed the recipe a little after reading other reviews. Pounded out chicken and coated in Italian bread crumbs. Then simply stuffed and cooked at 350 for 35 minutes. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and substituted cottage cheese for ricotta. It was moist and delicious! Will make again

for my own version i just layered tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and the cheese filling on top pf the chicken to bake since cutting slits in the breasts wast exactly working out for me. i also took the advice of most reviewers and browned the sides of the chicken before putting it in the oven. the seasoning was composed of garlic powder, flour, pepper, Italian seasoning, Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt which gave off the best aroma----like walking into an Olive Garden restaurant! the end product was very good and had everyone stuffed so thumbs up! great recipe.

Wonderful recipe I used it as a guide and pretty much did my own thing. After letting my  chicken marinate in lemon juice I stuffed my chicken with bell peppers , mushrooms, garlic, and tomatoes. I also used shredded cheese combined with cream cheese. I then dipped them In egg and coated with italian bread crumbs. Once cooked I spread the marinara sauce evenly over breast and added cheese . I will definitely put this recipe in the dinner rotation

My chicken breasts were too small to cut and stuff like the recipe, so I pounded them flat, topped them, and rolled them up. Really tasty and pretty easy - this one's a keeper.

very good although I modified this substantially. I tenderized the chicken breasts and filled them with a mixture of cottage cheese, sour cream, smashed garlic, salt, and wilted fresh spinach. I rolled the mixture into the chicken breasts, and cooked the meat in the over at 350 for 30 minutes. Then I spooned some spaghetti sauce with fresh basil on the chicken, put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. It was delicious. Will definitely make again.

So good! Ive made this twice in the past month! Lol I dont own any measuring cups (broke college student) so I estimate all of my measurements. Its impossible to go wrong with this one! I added extra garlic, some cayenne pepper for a kick, and sprayed some lime juice over the whole thing. It turned out amazing. Highly recommend.
edit: I also added a huge handful of shredded cheese. (Parmesan, asiago, something else blend)

Protip: Since this recipe makes SO MUCH filling, I used half for the chicken, stuffed the other half of it into some half-cooked jumbo shell pasta, and threw them in some ziplocs and into the freezer! So easy and now I have a whole extra meal, ready to heat!

Good base recipe. I added italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper to my cheese mixture as well as Parmesan cheese I also sauteed sliced mushrooms in a little coconut oil then added them to the filling mixture. I took 4 chicken breasts and sliced them in half so i then had two thin breast halves. I pounded out the chicken breasts and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and italian seasoning. Lay a generous amount of stuffing on each breast, roll up, and secure with toothpicks. I didn't use a marinara sauce, i made my own alfredo sauce.

This was great! I don't usually give 5 stars but this deserves it! I read other reviews and cut the cheese mixture by about 1/3. It seemed like the perfect amount. I also used thin sliced chicken breast and rolled the mixture inside instead of slitting the chicken. It just seemed easier to me b/c Ive cooked that way before. I also added more garlic as I'm a huge garlic lover and next time I will add a bit more mozzarella cheese!

I made this for guests and it earned me the most coveted compliment in cooking. "You're such a good cook!" I used ChefBauer's suggestion and made a pocket in the chicken (see his/her review, which is currently the second most helpful here for how it was done). After making the pockets, I took the advice of others and dipped the breasts in egg, then seasoned breadcrumbs, then quickly seared each side. After cooling I filled with the mixture, which I also added  a little basil to, and carried on with the recipe. I used jarred Rao's tomato basil sauce which was delicious and served it all over spaghetti squash. The other reviewers are right, the recipe makes way, way, WAY too much filling. I used about 1/3 of what was called for, for 4 people and still had some left over. BTW, I don't eat meat so I used a tilapia fillet and just covered it with some breadcrumbs, then the filling, sauce and cheese and it was just delicious. Very easy to do this on the side if you have a non meat eater joining your dinner. I can't recommend this recipe enough. One of my all-time favorites. Thanks Maria!!

This came out perfect! We love basil so I cooked the tomato sauce with fresh basil just for a few minutes before smothering the chicken and putting it in the oven. It was delicious, this recipe is a keeper.

This came out splendidly! It was a little messy stuffing the chicken, but I think that may have partly been because I didn't drain the thawed spinach well enough. Still yummy! I will definitely be making this again!

What a hit at dinner tonight!! The only thing I changed, was using 8 breasts instead of 4.... And still had filling left over. This recipe is good for making ahead of time. Easy to follow, lots of flavor and everyone loves it.

This recipe is always a hit with my family. I even managed to dazzle my mother in law with it! Sometimes I switch up the type of sauce I use. I also double the garlic for more flavor. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I followed some others and instead of slicing the chicken and rolling, I slit a hole and stuffed.  I also used three garlic cloves.

I made the full batch of cheese mixture and stuffed some manicotti shells.  I also poured some of the sauce on the shells.  I threw the manicotti in with the chicken (same cook time) and they were both done at the same time.  

I served this with the Quick Garlic Toast also on this site.

Not bad. Was a little bland for our tastes (we tend to enjoy spicy foods) so next time, I'll add some chili paste to the ricotta mixture. Will certainly make again with minor tweaks.

This is by far, the best chicken I've ever had. Absolutely amazing taste and I will definitely be making it again. My entire family loved it. It was super moist and melt in your mouth tender.

My hubby really enjoyed this dish. I would definitely wait to add the cheese during the last few minutes. I had so much of the spinach mix left that  I used it for a small lasagna which my hubby can't stop talking about!

Delicious! My husband and I loved this recipe. The only problem we had was making this as 2 servings but ended up with extra stuffing even after we used 3 chicken breasts.  So Next time we make it we will only go with 1 serving.

I love this...I'm making it right now. I feel that the proportions are a bit off, tho. I made half the stuffing and it was almost too much for 3 large breasts. I do use more garlic (3 large cloves), and some italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. WONDERFUL and very good for company.

Quick & easy..  I baked for only 45 minutes, and the chicken was done.  I put the extra mixture in a separate dish & baked for half the time for my son (who was hungry when I started cooking, so he was ready to eat!)  I only added 1 egg, & added a spoonful of light mayo, since I bought part-skim ricotta & wanted to filling to be creamier.

I made this last night, with only a few few minor changes, one being i used a three cheese blend instead of just mozzerella, second, i chose to bread mine and used the remaining filling to stuff manicotti shells (7) which i baked with the sauce in a separate pan. This was fabulous, my boyfriend loved it. Next time i make it i will add a little more herbs/spices though. awesome recipe, thank you so much for sharing! I will definately be making this again!

It was ok, I really think that it needs a lot more seasoning added to the filling. For me it was pretty bland, but I also am used to a lot of flavor, spices, and herbs when I cook so maybe that is it. Good starting point though.

Made this tonight for dinner.......excellent!  I did increase garlic to 2 cloves and I also added a little grated parmesan/romano cheese blend, salt and pepper to the filling.  Since I was making this recipe for just the two of us, I had plenty of filling left over and froze it so I can use for lasagna roll-ups or stuffed shells at a later date.  Will definitely make this recipe for dinner guests sometime.  I served with small side of spaghetti, green salad and garlic toast.

MMMMM...really good!  I was only stuffing two chickent breasts, and despite reviews that there was a ton of stuffing, I kept the other ingredients as they were indicated.  I had cooked some jumbo pasta shells that I decided to use some of the excess filling for to make for my boys (just cooked them some chicken and added to their stuffing).  The only other thing I changed was to use fresh spinach as I didn't have any frozen.  Didn't measure, just chopped and added to my ricotta mixture with a few dashes of nutmeg (which I usually add to ricotta mixture).  Also added fresh grated parm in the last 10 minutes of cooking instead of more mozz!  Really yummy, perfect with a simple side of steamed veggies or even just a salad!

Delicious but as other reviewers said, there is way too much stuffing.  Either make less or get some pasta noodles to fill.

Delicioso!  I made this almost exactly as the recipe states.  The only changes were I used 6 chicken breasts and jarred minced garlic, because I didn't have any fresh garlic.  I don't understand how anybody would be able to stuff 4 chicken breasts with the amount of stuffing this recipe produces.  I made 6 chicken breasts and stuffed them generously, and have enough stuffing left over to make stuffed shells tomorrow night.  That's not a bad thing..trust me!  I really enjoyed the flavor of this.  I served it with a side of spaghetti and marinara.  Yummy!  The only thing I think I'll change next time is not sprinkling it with mozzarella until the last 10 minutes.  The Mozzarella got brown and hard on top of the chicken breasts...still great though!

EXCELLENT! You can also use PEPPER JACK CHEESE (pound chicken thin, layer spinach and pepper jack, roll chicken). The spicy cheese gives it a kick.

This was pretty good but just needed something more for our taste.  I am going to try again adding more garlic, add a little 3-cheese mix from my deli to the ricotta mixture and start off seasoning my chicken as if I were going to simply grill it.  I am thinking it will be key to begin with well-seasoned chicken.

This was so good even my husband who hates spinach ate it. We did cut the filling in half and still had enough for 10 boneless tenders pounded and then sprinkled with some seasoning before we rolled them up. I browned them in my cast iron skillet and then popped them in the oven for 45 minutes. Perfect. I did give it 4 stars since I did have to use some reviews to make it so good.

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband enjoyed it. I think chicken breast is dry in general, but he said this was juicy and tender. For me personally, I would give it 4 stars because chicken breast is not my favorite. I think I would like this dish better with chicken thighs. Anyway, the filling was yummy. I saved money and made it with cottage cheese. I put cottage cheese, spinach, egg, parmesan, salt, and pepper in a food processor and processed it. It was yummy. I also added a bit of mozzarella cheese. I simmered the sauce with some spices, and I cooked the chicken covered in foil without the mozzarella and then the last 10 or so minutes of baking I removed the foil, added the cheese, and baked.

Loved it! We used cream cheese, didn't have ricotta and it turned out great. I also did this on the stove top instead of in the oven. I just browned the stuffed breasts and then added the sauce to simmer.

This was so good! The only change I made was for the cheese stuffing I added extra garlic, fresh basil, and fresh grated parmesan cheese. My kids loved it!!

This dish turned out great but a little salty probably due to the sauce I used.  I added one more clove of garlic a couple dashes of Italian seasoning and a dash of nutmeg to the filling.  Per other reviews does make way too much filling for 4 breasts.  I filled 5 and still had left over.  For me, it was easier to cut a slit in the side of the chicken and stuff instead of pounding chicken and rolling which others suggested.  Will definitly make again.  Update: I froze one left over to have as a lunch portion and defrosted it in the micro and it turned out great.

This was very good.  Like others, I doubled the garlic - cooked half of it in olive oil and the other half I left raw.  I added a tiny sprinkle of nutmeg.  I also added Parmesan/Romano cheese to the mixture.  I covered/cooked with a can of Italian plum tomatos.  I also sprinkled the chicken with salt and pepper.

I made this again, but pounded the chicken thin and marinaded it overnight in italian dressing.  It made a big (positive) difference.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and flattened the breasts, dipped one side in egg and coated it with half and half mix of italian bread crumbs and parm cheeze. I can't remember the sauce brand I used, but it was ricotta and parm cheese flavor and it was really good. Very good flavors.

This is an excellent dish, deserving 5 stars because it was not only delicious, but so incredibly easy to prepare!  I only prepared half of the cheese mixture and it fully (I mean, fully) stuffed 3 very large chicken breast halves.  I find that using a small knife to cut the chicken to stuff is simplier than pounding and rolling, and it held together very well without the use of toothpicks.  I do not feel you need to bake it for the time stated as it will overcook and dry out the chicken; I baked them uncovered for about 30 minutes at 375.  You can also dip the chicken in egg and coat with bread crumbs to easily turn it into a Chicken Parm-style dish, but be sure not to bake it with the sauce and cheese as it will make the breading soggy.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

My 7 yo cried when he got to the table, "I hate spinach!"  Even though he attempted to remove the spinach from the cheese mixture, he still asked for seconds!  This is high praise, thus the 5 stars!

The chicken came out really moist, but I was not a fan of the filling. If you are not a fan of spinach, you will not like this. I did not put that much spinach in there, and my roommate loved it. It was not my cup of tea though.

Maria,

You put your FEET in this dish. Girl, this was good to me!!! I took some for lunch and my co-workers asked at which restaurant did I purchase the meal. I said, "I made this!"

My husband was floored. 

Thank you so much!!!

My husband is very picky when it comes to white meat.  He devoured it!  Somehow I ended up with half of the "stuffing" left over because it wouldn't fit.  I used it along with some left over tomato/spaghetti sauce, and some noodles to create another meal.

I made this last night for a friend and it was delicious! Presentation was very pretty and tasted great. I would probably add just a little more salt to give the spinach and chicken a little something (cause most people probably don't just LOVE the taste of spinach by itself) but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I will definitely make it again. Very yum.

I thought it turned out really good, but my husband wouldn't eat it because it "looks gross". I used thin-sliced chicken breasts and just folded them over the filling. I marinated the breats in Italian dressing like other reviewers suggested. I put the filling left over over the top of the breasts. I thought it was good!

This is a great recipe. I use the extra spincah sauce and added it to the pan I baked the chicken in. I made fettucine with this and the extra sauce was great with it. I also used 4 cheeses to add to the topping. Another thing I did was I used chicken breast and thight. I de-boned the thight myself which left a pocket for the stuffing. Overall my family and friend was very happy with this meal and didnt believe that it was my first time making it.

YUM! I made this for my wife and mom and it was a hit. I did change a couple thing. I sauted the garlic in a dash of EVOO to bring the flavor a bit. I also used some fresh Parisan in the filling as well. Instead of butterflying the beast I a knife and pushed it in the thick end of the breast and made a pocket, and then stuffed them. By reading other reviews I saw that there would be leftover stuffing so I took some Manictti and stuffed them with the rest of the filling. I will be making this recipe again.

I absolutely love this recipe. It is now on the list of regular meals in my house. They always stay tender and the flavor is so yummy. Very easy to make. The recipe does make too much stuffing and I tend to throw out half of it though. My 3 year old twins even like it and it is an easy way to get them some spinach. :)

I love this chicken breast recipe!  The creamy spinach filling was a nice addition to the tender chicken breasts.  Maria certainly knows how to turn boring baked breast into something different yet delicious.  I will make again definitely.

Very good; used fresh spinach instead of frozen, much better texture.  Also slipped a few slices of proscuitto in for more complexity.

Chicken was very bland, so would suggest marinating it first. I did really like the filling though, and would use it as a stuffing for a large shelled pasta next time.  I also used cheddar and monterrey jack instead of mozzarella to give it a bit more flavor

Really really good!  My first time experiencing stuffed chicken and it was great!  I made it just as the recipe indicated, the only thing was that there was more (water/broth?) in the bottom of the pan than I had anticipated.  It was okay because i just stirred the spaggetti sauce and cheese into the mixture so that we'd have more sauce, in our house-the more sauce, the better!  Very good, will use again!

Excellent base recipe.  I added minced onion, parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes to the ricotta mixture.  I also breaded the chicken breasts to give them a chicken parmigiana feel.

This recipe was great, the stuffing really was perfect and the chicken stayed nice and jucy in the sauce. Although it made more stuffing then I could use. Next time I will have jumbo shells on hand to stuff with the extra.

This turned out ot be a huge meal because the chicken breast I used were way too big , I should have cut them in half then stuffed. I marinated them for a few hours in leftover artichoke oil , I honestly don't know if it made a difference though ! I ended up making a "make shift" tomato sauce because I didn't have enough....all in all good but would alter some things next time, definitely using a bottled sauce! Mine didn't look much like the pictures, not quite as pretty.

I made this using cottage cheese instead of ricotta. It was very good. I like to add diced onion and garlic to the filling. Also, once when I was out of spaghetti sauce, I used canned diced tomatos and Italian seasoning on top. Taht was pretty good too.

Everyone loved it.  It was SUPER easy and I changed it a little.  I used a bag of fresh baby spinach (be very generous because it cooks down) and sauteed it w/ garlic.  I had some mushrooms leftover already sauteed and added that to the mix.  I pounded the chicken and just rolled the mixture into it   and held it w/ toothpicks.  Definitely will make w/ cottage cheese next time.  I am using the leftover filling for shells tomorrow night.  Thank you!

I made this last night for dinner and although it was good, it wasn't AS GOOD as I had expected. I followed the recipe as far as the filling was concerned, only I added one extra clove of garlic.  I butterflied my chicken and then pounded it thin..and then filled, rolled and secured with toothpicks. I also lightly breaded it with some Italian breadcrumbs mixed with parmesean cheese. I had a lot of filling left over so I topped it with mozerella and threw in the oven for 15 min...and it made an excellent spinach dip! My 3 yr old ate it up and my bf liked it too, his only complaint was that the spinach itself was a little bland. If I make this again I will season the spinach some and see if that helps.

I made this last night and got several compliments from my husband.  I didn't change much from the original recipe other than leaving out the eggs and adding Italian seasoning & fresh ground pepper to the filling.  It was delicious and something we'll definitely have again!

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes! Stuffing the chicken breast can be tricky for me, so I usually just kind of layer the pan with the chicken, cheese mixture, and tomato sauce. It comes out equally delicious. The chicken is super filling, so I usually serve this alone or with a light salad or bread.

The second time I made this I only had fresh spinach, so I removed the stems and used that instead. It turned out waaaaay better than the first time I made this dish using frozen spinach. I also chopped up some mushrooms and sundried tomatoes and added that to the stuffing. Perfect! I froze the surplus cheese mixture and am having in jumbo pasta shells tonight.

This recipe was sooooo delicioso and easy to make.  Next time I make it, I will season the chicken with italian seasoning along with the salt and pepper.  I used Prego Mushroom spaghetti sauce.  I served with thin wheat spaghetti, salad, and garlic cheese bread.  Will make again very soon.

I thought this was excellent.  I made this according to the recipe, but with only three chicken breasts.  I obviously had a lot of extra stuffing left over.  Next time we'll try stuffed shells in addition to use all of the cheese stuffing.  The chicken breasts used were pretty thick and it took about 90 min to cook thoroughly.  I will make this again.

this recipe was really good...i used 4 chicken tenders (DEFINITELY halve the amount of filling), 'battered' with egg and italian seasoned bread crumbs and lightly fried on each side. i added fresh spinach, italian seasoning, and some sauteed onion to my filling mixture, rolled it all up and stuck toothpicks in each one. i also covered it with foil the entire cooking time...turned out wonderfully!

This was very good.  I sauteed the spinach with 3 cloves of garlic before mixing with the cheeses and I only used one egg.  I also used fat free ricotta to reduce the calories and fat content.

These turned out amazing for me.  I'm not a ricotta cheese fan so I just added more mozzerella.  So good.
It took a lot longer to cook than expected though, I'm thinking about uping the temp to 375 next time.

I thought the overall dish came out pretty well, but the filling needs something extra.  I added an additional clove of garlic, some nutmeg and italian seasoning and still found it bland.  I also ended up with a TON of wasted filling which I threw out (just had stuffed shells or else this would've been good for that).  I'm cutting back on the ricotta next time and looking for other additions to make the stuffing more flavorful.  On the bright side, the chicken was very moist.

This chicken was incredible! I threw ina twist by sauteéing the spinach with musrooms before adding it to the feta cheese. I also baked it on a bed of rotini. It was like eating at a restaurant!

Good base recipe, but it didn't have much flavor at all.  Next time I will use more seasoning on the chicken or even marinade it first.

Delish!  I pounded out my chicken breasts and wrapped it around the stuffing - not needing any toothpicks because the chicken was so tender it held together.  I also added onions and mushrooms to the stuffing.  Of course, as many other reviewers added, it made too much stuffing so I also stuffed shells as a side dish.  Enjoyed this dish!

My husband thought this was wonderful.  I thought the chicken needed more seasoning.  He even brought the left overs to work and everyone loved it.

The stuffed chicken breasts were pretty easy to make.  They were delicious.  I would definitely recommend them to others.

I really liked the filling, it would great other recipes.  I only used a fraction of the amounts listed and I still had left overs of filling.

I read all the great reviews so I tried the receipe. It was a bit disappointing. I enjoyed it but it was far from the best meal I ever ate, as some stated. Why so much stuffing? I made half and still much left over.

It was a little bland to me.  I added italian sausage to the cheese mix and put it in the shells.  The shells were indeed better than the chicken.

This was wonderful!! I didn't feel like deboning my chicken breasts so I just cut a slit into each and stuffed. Used leftover mixture and put into large pasta shells. One pan of chicken, one pan of shells, all stuffed with the delicious mixture and topped with sauce. Very impressed with how this came out! Thanks for sharing!!

I give the recipe four stars because it was super simple to put together and it had a solid taste to it.  I didn't give it five stars because it could really use some "umph."  It could have definitely used some herbs and spice to bring the taste up an extra notch.  But I would not hesitate to recommend this dish to anyone...especially parents who need to throw something together quickly.  (note: the recipe for the stuffing makes a lot more than you need for 4 chicken breasts!)

Easy and tasty- as others have said, though, there is a ton of stuffing left over, even though I piled it into the butterflied chicken. Much easier and tastier then other stuffed chicken recipes I've tried. Will make again.

Try cutting the breast all the way across, you can fit more stuffing, and every bite has plenty of it.  Also use a clean kitchen towel, put the spinich in it after defrosting it and squeeze the water out by closing the towel around it an ringing it out.  Home made sauce works great! Wonderful recipe my company was very impressed and complemented all the way to the last bite!

Kinda bland and way too much stuffing. The recipe was good, just not to my liking. Maybe more garlic and some seasoned salt/other spices would help?

This recipe is fantastic.  True, there was a LOT of stuffing, so I just froze it for the NEXT time I make this dish, which I know will be soon. I used Prego's Italian sausage and garlic sauce and served over angel hair pasta...SO tasty!

I thought this was very good! I cut each chicken breast in half and stuffed each half...otherwise I thought they would have been pretty big! I guess-timated all of the amounts and used an Italian mix of shredded cheese instead of just mozzerella. I also added mushrooms to a homemade sauce (used garlic, onion, a little red pepper, San Marzano tomatoes, basil and parsley). Came out perfect. Not rubbery at all. I made sure each chicken breast was completely covered with sauce while it cooked so they wouldn't dry out. Grazie Maria!

This was a hit. I made this to impress my boyfriend. I didn't even pay super close attention to the recipie measurements, I kind of just threw everything in a bowl and mixed it all together, seasoned it to taste, then stuffed it into the chicken. There was still a lot of leftover stuffing. Boyfriend LOVED it. Cleaned his plate!

This was wonderful!  I followed the advice of the others and cut down on the cheese, adding just 1/4 cup mozzarella, 1/2 pkg of ricotta, and then topped with homemade sauce and parmesan.  I also seasoned the stuffing a bit (since ricotta has little flavor) with some basil and garlic salt. It turned out so yummy!! This would be a great dish to serve at a dinner party-it's pretty easy but tastes fancy.

This was so easy and so delicious, my family loved it. I also pounded the chicken and rolled the mixture in it. I also made my own sauce, I put the breasts on top of some linguini and then poured sauce on top of all of it and then cheese...mmmmmm

The kids really loves this one. I found that I needed 3 hands during the stuffing operation but overall it was not bad.  We didn't have any Ricotta when we made this and used Mozzarella instead but it still turned out great.  We will make this one again.

I'm italian and this recipie was delicious and easy. Even though I forgot to add the mozzarella to the mixture, I poured it on top and it still had a great taste. We had an unexpected guest for dinner when I first tried it, and he really raved about it. I know he was honest, because he is outspoken and would say exactly what he thinks(brother-like friend) so I know it is good. thanks Maria!

This dish is so delicious and so easy, even a new cook can score a perfect 10 with this one.  I see a lot of people complaining about a lack of flavor, but that makes no sense to me.  There was tons of flavor!  This dish relies heavily on the marinara, so if you choose a weak pasta sauce, I guess that could be the cause of some disappointment.   Except for adding garlic powder to the ricotta mixture (instead of fresh garlic - I was feeling lazy and didn't want to skin and chop it), I followed the recipe exactly.  I recommend serving this chicken dish with polenta on the side.  Such an impressive combination of flavors.  Try it, Mikey... you'll like it :)

This is similar to the recipe I was following for stuffed chicken like this.  The point of recipes like this is to bake without using grease and rolling in breadcrumbs.  I season the breasts with coarse pepper, ground pink sea salt and garlic powder and put less cheese, there is too much left  over otherwise so half it, add a couple tablespoons of parmesan cheese plus couple tablespoons reduced fat cheese cheese and use a six cheese Italian mix instead of just mozzarella and only 1 egg, added garlic powder instead of minced to cheese also addedground black pepper plus teaspoon dried basil to cheese mixture.  I used a can of hunts garlic diced tomatoes in addition to  1 1/2 cups marinara sauce.  Then add an even coating of cheese and bake for 50 minutes at 350 degrees loosely and remove foil bake addition 10 mintutes until cheese is bubbly lightly toasted.

Made this and it was delicious and really impressed my guests. I marinated beforehand with buttermilk after reading others suggestions. I would use smaller breasts next time and would add mushrooms to try. Used the left over filling in large shells which were so easy and also impressive. I love reading the feedback and suggestions of others

Great recipe!  I found the chicken breast didn't cut nicely to make a pocket so I just cut it in half and laid the stuffing on top, worked out fine.  Makes a little to much stuffing but it tasted great.  Hubby isn't a fond of chicken but he came back for more.  Would definately make again.

After reading  reviews, I added some garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, and a little crushed red pepper to the filling.  I also pounded out the chicken breasts and spread the filling on top and rolled them verses stuffing them. It turned out great! Will definitely make again!

Substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta (looking to save calories). Absolutely wonderful. The family loves it. We saved the "drippings" for pasta the following day as well.

I made it with homemade marinara, which I spread in the pan under the chicken and on top of the chicken, and fresh mozzarella. Also, I covered the pan with tin foil for the first 35 minutes to keep in some moisture from the steaming marinara; then I removed the foil for the last 15 minutes. Otherwise I followed the directions closely. It was great. I'm on a very strict diet (no bread crumbs, hardly any frying) so this was a perfect substitute for chicken parm.  Will definitely make this again.

It is a good start is the best I can say.  It did not have any pizzaz to it.  However, it is quick and easy so for working parents its a good start.  We will try again but here are some of my thoughts for addition.  To the stuffing would consider adding any combination of roasted red bell peppers, sundried tomatoes or basil.  Consider addition/mix parmesan or asiago to cheese for a bit more punch.  Consider injecting chicken beforehand for more flavor (I hate bland boneless skinless chicken breast and this recipe did nothing for that).  May drizzle with some good balsamic at the end.

The cheese mixture was dripping with water which made it hard to stuff into the breasts, the flavor was kind of bland, I baked some and fried some (I am not one to fry things) and the fried breasts were much better. Good base recipe but has room for improvement.

Very tasty. I did not have ricotta cheese so I used cottage cheese instead. I forgot the eggs so my stuffing ran out into the pan!  I blended the cheeses, garlic, and blanched spinach in the blender (next time I'll add the eggs to this). I covered the stuffed chicken with a can of fire roasted tomatoes on top. Yummy! I will serve atop angel hair pasta next time too.

Great recipe! I followed the other reviewers advice and breaded the chicken with egg and breadcrumbs  and parmesan to add to the flavor profile. I wish I would have made less of the ricotta mixture like other reviewers suggested as there was way too much left over that I ended up throwing out. Overall a great recipe that my husband and I loved!

I modified by using fresh spinach and fresh basil, sautéed with garlic. That helped give the meal more flavor. I also split the chicken breasts and did a quick pan sear before adding the filling to help lower the bake time, still took 1 hour and 15 minutes to cook.

We made this with a twist.  We flattened the chicken to an even thickness then layered the dish using salt, pepper, diced garlic, pepper flakes, cheese mix spread thick, small amount of breading for a crunch, a quick spray of olive oil to help the breading crunch and cooked surrounded by a small amount of arrabbiata sauce.  I also put into the cheese mixture 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese and an extra clove of garlic to give it more of a kick.  The taste was heavenly, the chicken was moist.  No lack of flavor AT ALL.

As a novice cook, I found this recipe quite easy to make and  with a few simple modifications know it has 5 star potential!  I did follow a couple of reviewers' suggestions.  1) I pounded the chicken breast to thin them out and rolled them around the filling instead of cutting the breast in half.  I still used the toothpick to hold the roll together while cooking.  2) I added an additional clove of garlic and 1/4 cup parmesan to the mixture for taste.  The dish turned out perfectly and it makes wonderful leftovers. I am definitely saving this recipe and, next time, will try marinating or seasoning the chicken for several hours prior to preparation.  Enjoy!!!

This was easier than I expected and a great change to the same meals I cook over and over. I cooked it as directed but I did add a few more seasonings to the chicken. However, I didn't use enough mozzarella cheese to the mixture,  also  I recommend using a thick spaghetti sauce. I will definitely make this dish again!!!

Loved everything about this!  We now double the recipe, make a bunch and freeze them, the use when we want a treat! 1 stuffed breast is perfect for 2 people tipped over some pasta.

This was so good!!!  I used half the ricotta and one egg, but left everything else the same. I cooked it for 20 minutes with no sauce, 20 minutes with sauce, and 10 minutes with mozzarella on top. I overstuffed the chicken and didn't bother with toothpicks, but made sure they were nestled close together in the pan. The chicken breasts I used were large and I spread extra stuffing on top.  It came out perfect. Restaurant quality.

I did not like the bland taste of the chicken, it just wasn't seasoned enough with using salt and pepper. I would highly recommend using seasoning salt. I also pounded the breasts flat which is the only way to get them to roll up. I think next time i will use bread crumbs on the outside and quickly brown in a pan.

As some other reviewers suggested, I added garlic to the cheese mixture and added garlic salt to the chicken breast. I butterflied one of the breasts and the second one I cut a hole and stuffed it with the mixture. With the butterflied filet I stuck it in egg, covered it in breadcrumbs and then fried. I stuck the cheese mix into the flap and tried to close it with toothpicks which was kind of hard. The breast I cut a hole in, I literally stuffed with my fingers until I couldn't put anymore. Then after it was breaded I stuck it in the pot to fry real quick and when I took it out the hole was gone and it was a nice big fat breast! It looked amazing in presentation. I stuck them both in the oven to bake and surprisingly the cheese mix didn't come out of the butterflied breast!

I didn’t make this exactly as directed.  I pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch thick, brined them for an hour, and then rolled them with the filling, over stuffing it.  Came out beautifully.  This was a little on the bland side for us, so if you like a little jazz, add extra seasonings.

Thanks!   Found this recipe looking for something with chicken and ricotta.   Got started only to find the ricotta had gone bad.   Started dumping from the fridge, and it turned out great!   Added chipotle adobo sauce puree, black olives, capers, pineapple, fresh spinach with the mozzarella and garlic and it was super.  Anxious to try it with the ricotta.

Great base recipe, the whole family loved it. I used fresh chopped baby spinach and light ricotta with the garlic, seasoning and eggs. I put the mozzarella only on top...served it with the sauce and juices from the pan on top ...fantastic. This one is a keeper !

This recipe is awesome. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, 1/4 cup shredded parmesan and 2 garlic cloves. I cut 3 breasts in half long ways, rolled and pin closed with toothpicks. I also had extra of the cheese mixture so I spread it out over the bottom of the dish then placed the chicken on top. I served the chicken over spaghetti noodles. This is definitely a keeper :)

This was really good, but next time I will either leave out the spinach or only use 1/3 of the package. My husband ate the leftover chicken and said it was still really good the next day, except for the spinach - which he said was too dry after being reheated in the microwave.

I use a super thin knife so I only create about an inch slice in the chicken, and can slice out the middle so we can actually stuff the chicken breasts.  It is cool to seem them double in size from the stuffing!  This is a favorite at our house - though a bit labor intensive.  I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.

For the most part I thought this was a good recipe. I only gave it three stars because it lacked in the seasoning department. It also calls for to much of the cheese mixture. I had to throw the remaining mixture in the trash. That is the other reason I gave it three stars. I will make this again as my family did enjoy it but we all agreed I should add more seasoning.

I would agree that you do not need all of the cheese mixture for the stuffing.  A lot went to waste.  You could almost cut it in half! I baked my chicken breasts for 50 minutes and they were a little dry.  I would say bake 40-45 mins max.  I put Parmesan cheese in the cheese mixture and on top as well.  Gave it a little sharper flavor.

It was really quite good! As the others I did make a minor alteration. I cooked the chicken without the sauce for about 50 min to make sure the meat was cooked then added the sauce and cheese afterwards ( already warm ). The filling does make way too much but lots of suggestions of what to do with the extra is in the reviews. Was really good and all the folks for dinner that day were impressed!  Awesome!

This was a fantastic recipe after a few adjustments! I used 2 cloves of garlic, fresh spinach, as well as jalepeno monteray jack cheese, and marble. I then used toothpicks and wrapped the chicken with prosciutto. 5 stars after these adjustments!!

This is my boyfriend's favorite dish that I make! I did not have cloves of garlic, but jarred minced garlic which I found to work just as well.I have made this three times now, each time it seems to get better. I also seasoned the chicken breasts with pepper, and a dash of seasoning salt. Excellent recipe! It tastes like you worked all day on it!

The dish tasted awesome.  There did seem to be a lot more stuffing than chicken breasts.

Really easy and yummy recipe. I added more garlic and Italian spices with sauteed mushrooms to the cheese stuffing. I also rolled the chicken instead of stuffing it. I will make this again!

I love this recipe and my family practically licks their plates when I fix it. I just wanted to add a tip to Chefbauer's method for cutting in from the top to make a pocket for the filling. It is a great way to go and I use cooking shears to make it easy to go in just far enough without cutting all the way through.

I used fresh spinach and sauteed it prior to stuffing the chicken.  I also substituted 1% Cottage Cheese instead of ricotta.  It came out great. I love this recipe and will be making it again for more people than just me.

I thought this was just OK, but two of my kids thought it was really good so I gave it four stars. Who knows, maybe it was the spaghetti sauce I used (in effort to save time, I used Whole Foods 365 Organic sauce; usually I make my own)? Whatever the case, this was fine for a one-time dinner, but I won't make it again.

I just started cooking as a hobby about 3 weeks ago. So far I had only worked on my chili recipe and watched a lot of food network and cooking tv. That's the only reason I knew how to mince the garlic... Anyway, this recipe filled 5 breasts with some left over. I used 3 cloves of garlic and a 24 oz jar of spaghetti sauce. It was the smallest jar I had on hand. It came out absolutely perfect!!! Unbelievable. My family was so happy when they tasted this. They are a little apprehensive as some of my previous recipes did not work out so well. As a beginner and someone who needed a bit of a confidence boost, this recipe fit the bill. Thank you so much for sharing this!

My wife and I found this an excellant recipe just the way it was. The only thing I done differant was instead of a slit, I cut the breast in half, spread the mixture and placed the other half on top with toothpicks, then topped with sauce and cheese. The only problem I had was our store sells chicken breasts in packs of three, so I ended up with two 9x13 dishes.

This was pretty good dish and very simple if you all the ingredients on hand. Like a lot of other people I ended up with too much stuffing, even after I halved the recipe. Regardless, I will make this again with either chicken or shells.

This was a good recipe.  Something you can add to if you want. 
I didn't use ricotta(trying to cut fat) so I used cottage cheese.  I also didn't add as much mozzarella as called for.
  I pounded the breasts thin for rolling.  Got a nice look from this.
 It was very good.  Husband liked it alot.  I made this along side stuffed shells.  Meat and potatoes here kind of thing.
  All in all a good recipe.

Any recipe that gets an 11 year old to eat spinach and ask for seconds is five stars in my book. The bake time was more like an hour and ten minutes though. Not a meal to sneak in on a busy night but well worth the time

This is very good! I've made a few adjustments, but don't think I've found my groove with it yet. I've tried pounding out the meat (gross and messy!) and I've tried to butterfly the chicken...either way, the end product turns out good, just messy. It works better for me to butterfly the chicken (which I haven't done before this). Once that skill improves, I'm sure I'll be more excited about making this. All in all, a very good dish.

This is an excellent recipe.  I served it over Linguine Pasta. Instead of a jar sauce, I made a Marinara Sauce from this site which made a great accompaniment. Next time I will cut back on the stuffing because it was way too much for just four chicken breasts.

We really liked this. I did have leftover filling, so six breasts would be better. Otherwise did everything exactly as stated and it was great!

Like so many others, I, too, tweaked this recipe a bit. I think it's a great basic recipe, but it looked like it needed more flavor.  I added Italian seasoning to the spinach mix before rolling it up in the chicken. After rolling it up, I sprinkled the chicken with Italian bread crumbs.  Since I don't especially care for red sauce, I used a jar of alfredo sauce instead, then topped that with the mozzarella cheese - along with some shredded parmesan cheese.  Yummy.  Served it over angel hair pasta and it was delicious!  Like everyone else, I had leftover stuffing.  Froze it for future use.

Not bad, but chicken didn't have enough flavor.  Will try again after marinating the chicken in an herb and garlic marinade overnight.   Overall, it was pretty easy, and the presentation is nice.

Good recipe but definitely needs a bit more flavor and texture. Wish I would've read the other reviews first - it would have been better with the breadcrumbs to be sure.

There are thousands of reviewers here that are giving way too much praises to this dish. To 1st time tryers, take heed to the other reviewers, including me, that the chicken does come out dry, boring to the taste buds and way too much mixture left over. Not a keeper.

I should have read the reviews first -- I only used about 1/3 of the filling.  I will have to think of something to to do with the remainder of it.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, and I also pounded out the chicken breasts, spread the ricotta mixture over the surface, and then rolled them up.  It was very tasty!  I served it with steamed broccoli and brown rice.

I agree that this does need some extra seasoning. I added lots and lots of garlic and it was still lacking something. Maybe the previous reviewer's nutmeg? Whatever it is, it needs to be in the cheese mixture. I had breasts with rib meat, and didn't want to waste that part, so I chose to pound flat. It still looked stuffed, and I was able to get all my filling in (I only made half, after reading reviews). Overall, though, this was awesome. I'll keep tweaking it and serve it again and again. BTW, I served it with roasted zucchini and onions and it looked fantastic. I took leftovers to work and my coworkers were jealous!

Manificent!! Always looking for a chicken breast recipe and this one fits the bill. Wouldn't change any thing except the amount of stuffing. It definetly would fill 6 or 7 breasts. Very simple and tasty recipe. Will make again often.

Perfect! My husband loved this dish and has already requested that I make this next week.  The review that advised to only make half of the stuffing mix is right but I found a way to use the remaining mix. I put the leftover mix into a shallow baking dish and baked it until it was firm, in order to cook the raw egg. Once cooled, I put onto Seran Wrap and put into fridge. I was then able to cut pieces of it to crumble onto pasta (shells, spirals, penne) that I mixed with a little homemade pesto and baked. There are so many things that can be done with the leftover mix, you just have to make sure that it is cooked due to the raw egg.

Delicious!! I made these with just a few alterations, namely seasoning (salt, pepper, crushed garlic, dried oregano, basil). I also pounded the chicken, and since I didn't have any ricotta I just used spinach, egg and shredded italian blend cheese. I also used a combo of jarred roasted garlic sauce and a small can of tomato sauce- fabulous. It made a rich tomato gravy. This recipe will become a staple in my cooking repetoire.

My often times picky eater son when it comes to "new things" and who HATES spinach (shh... I told him the green stuff was broccoli) really liked this recipe! He gave it a thumbs up. I made the recipe as directed with only a couple minor changes. I had an Italian blend of cheese so I used that instead of mozzarella and for cooking I left the cheese off, covered the chicken with foil for the first 40 minutes, then removed the foil and added the cheese on top and finished it off in the oven for an additional 20 minutes. Came out perfectly cooked with a beautiful golden brown cheese crust. The filling was plentiful, but I used good sized breasts and cut deep pockets in them and was able to use all of the filling. I did find the mixture a little bland, so when I make this again I will most likely add some Italian seasoning and maybe some garlic powder to the cheese mixture. I also served this with some angel hair pasta and next time will add a little more sauce to the chicken, and use that sauce on the pasta. Overall a very nice dish that was very pretty, not too much time and effort to make it, and had a good taste!

I made it just like it said. I didnt think I could get all the filling in so I had some left over. I will put it all in next time because it does melt down a bit. My husband raved about it and I will serve to guest the next time.

I absolutely love this recipe!  For advice on taste, use extra garlic for stuffing and use Ms's Dash for the chicken.  For the sauce: I used Newman's Own SOCKARONI (has peppers, spices, and onions) and to top off: I used Mozzarella cheese.  FANTASTIC!!

Loved the concept (I love spinach & ricotta cheese), but chicken tasted a little bland.  Will add more salt or seasoning next time.  When I ate it, I ended up cutting the chicken &  dipping it into the spaghetti sauce.  The sauce helped with the flavor.  Will add even more sauce next time because I ended up running out of sauce to dip.  I had served it with angel hair with a butter/herb sauce that I had mixed from a box from Aldi.  Tasted really good with the simple pasta.

This is a great idea for stuffed chicken breast.  After reading many reviews, I made some modifications so I would end up with the right amount of cheese mixture and lots of flavor.  I used about half of the ricotta cheese and kept the mozzarella the same (I really like mozzarella). I really love garlic so I used three cloves and added some fresh chopped basil to my cheese mixture.  I sautéed a small clove of garlic (minced) in some organic extra virgin olive oil and organic butter and chopped organic Bella mushrooms.  After a few minutes I added my fresh chopped organic spinach with a few dashes of organic nutmeg.  Let that sit on the heat for just a few minutes.  Let it cool than added it to my cheese mixture.  I added a bit of salt and fresh ground pepper and a mixture of dried onions, red bell peppers, sundried tomatoes, and leeks for extra flavor.  The aroma was delicious.  I borrowed CHEFBAUER’s idea of cutting a pocket into the thickest part of the breast and piped in the cheese mixture.  I think this method is more work but the presentation is much nicer than the toothpick option.  I covered and baked according to the recipe then added my remaining mozzarella the last fifteen minutes.  Delicious! I will definitely make this again and will try the other method of flattening the breast and rolling the mixture in the breast.

I subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta & added 1 can petite diced tomatoes, undrained. Very good! I think next time I make this, I'll use extra cheese over the top-cuz I'm a cheesy kinda gal-but won't add it until the last few minutes of baking.

This was pretty good overall.  I made my own pasta sauce.  I stuffed 5 chicken breasts and still had almost half of the stuffing leftover.  I think it would have been better breaded like a chicken parmesan but we will definitely make it again.

Good recipe. I recommend dipping the chicken in egg batter then dipping in bread crumbs before stuffing. Baked for 55 min.

The stuffing was good, but I thought chicken was a little bland. Maybe need to spice up the chicken a bit.

This recipe is amazing..but the ingredients you need to buy can be pricey. I marinated my chicken in italian dressing for about 2 hours, gives it a really nice tang to it..I'd deinately recommend this recipe to anyone :)

Really tasty! There was way to much "stuffing" for the 4 breasts, so I threw what was left on top of the 4, poured the spagetti sauce on top and it was perfect.  Very fast and easy recipe.

This was great. I'm a novice in the kitchen and was able to make the dish. I coupled it with Fettuccini Florintine. I may marinate the chicken next time for more flavor.

This recipe had a great taste. I also had some problem stuffing all of the cheese mixture into the chicken breasts, so I just topped the chicken with the remaining mixture. Either in or on top of the chicken, this dish tastes great.

Made this for the first time and both husband and son loved it -- Im no Emeril or Rachel Ray when it comes to cooking (baking is my forte)but found this extremely easy and tasty.  Had leftover filling - makes enough for 8 breasts, but will keep and stuff pasta shells for anther dinner.

Pretty good... chicken was a little dry, but I didn't use the whole jar of tomato sauce so that's probably why.

I made a few changes, not big, so I do not feel as though I need to give you many details, but I chopped up celery real fine and put that in the stuffing.  These were really just great! I also, set them in a baking dish with alfredo sauce, peppers, onion, and noodles. Different and delish!

My family enjoyed the taste and flavor I added hot peppers to the spinach, I also left the butterfly chicken breast open and just piled the spinach and cheese on top did not fold over, that way you had enough of the mixture for the chicken.  The recipe worked great this way.

I did enjoy this recipe, the chicken was a little gland I think I will marinate it with some Italian seasoning. I used a 26oz can of pasta sauce, and it still seem like there wasn't enough. Over all I did enjoy it!

I had my first dinner party not too long ago and kinda went off this recipie. Instead of spinich, i made a batch using green pepper in the filling and a batch using brocolli. It turned out very well and everyone seemed to really like it!

This recipe was fantastic. I used twice the garlic because we just do that automatically. And instead of cutting the chicken breast open, we rolled it to make it a little more presentable. It absolutely did it's job feeding our 5 person dinner party with plenty left over. You could probably even cut the rolls in half and make them go as far as 16 stuffed breasts (we made enough for 8). We also made mashed potatoes and added the filling that was left over to made them cheesier and accompanied the whole thing with onion-zucchini marinated in Italian dressing and pepper and served the whole thing with a light Shiraz. I will absolutely do this again.

This was a pretty good recipe.  Maybe the chicken breast I used for too large, but I felt like the chicken didn't have that much flavor. Maybe I needed to add more spices, or be sure to use a smaller breast.  Overall this was a good dish, but it's a work in progress.

I really think this is a 3.5 star, but I wanted to be generous. After reading so many raving reviews, I thought this would be much better. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not worth the time. I used fresh spinach sauteed with 2 cloves of garlic, I added some extra herbs, salt & pepper to the ricotta mixture, and I seasoned the chicken breasts. Still, it was not impressive. And a whole lotta work to stuff the chicken breasts. In the end, the result was just okay and I won't be making this again.

This was sooo good. I did what another user4 suggested and used left over stuffing to stuff shells and baked them in sperate dishes for 1/2 hour. It was the perfect side. My bf loved it and he hates spinach.

Wow!  This was delicious.  I didn't have frozen spinach on hand, so I just put some fresh spinach into the food processor...pulsed until chopped up.  Absolutely wonderful!

Great base recipe. Usually I can only get one of my two kids to like something, but this time both of them ate it up!  I can't believe someone actually rated this a 1 saying it was too garlicy. Maybe she used the whole bulb instead of a clove. I used three cloves in mine.

I followed the advise of others and seasoned the cheese mix with garlic, basil & oregeno. I forgot all about the eggs until after I stuffed them and decided just to leave them out and the dish was wonderful. My whole family loved it and asked me to make it again real soon!! Thanks so much for such a great receipe.

Everyone LOVES when I make this. It's excellent. I am a vegeterrian so I just put aside some of the filling and use it to make stuff shells for myself and make the chicken for my family.

I have never stuffed chicken breasts before so I was a bit concerned as my attempt to stuff salmon did not turn out terribly well. This recipe was very easy, the second time I made it it was basically from memory so that should show you how simple the ingredients are.  I simply slit the chicken breasts and over stuffed them- so simple and I received rave reviews at my office from both the men and women. I used part skim ricotta and low-skim mozzarella to cut a few calories but all in all, yummy and impressive to those you are feeding.

We really liked this recipe but I used broccoli instead of spinach, seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning and added provolone cheese on top (it really adds flavor!). I used thin sliced chicken breast so I could just roll it up around the cheese mixture.  I cut the cheese mixture part of the recipe in half and had more than enough for 4 chicken breasts.

This looked really good, however it lacked flavor. I even took the suggestions of others who sauted the spinach with galic, mushrooms, and olive oil. I think some Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning would help.

These are so simple yet so wonderful! What a nice change from ordinary plain old chicken dishes. This was so easy to prepare and even my kids gobbled it up!  (I didn't tell them there was spinach until after they told me it was delicious!) I didn't change a thing - next time I would add some spices to the ricotta cheese mixture - basil, oregano, etc., but that would just be to add a little touch. This one is a keeper!

This was good, but due to everyone's distaste for Spinach, I had to use chopped broccoli, which wasn't bad. I think that the cheese and veggie mixture needed more salt and pepper. Overall, it was pretty good though.

This recipe was okay.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and seasoned it a bit more than it said to.  The filling was too runny, it was hard to get it to stay inside the chicken breasts.  My husband said he liked it a lot, but wished it had more stuffing in it.  Next time I will try only using 1 egg.

My husband thought it was delicious and has even rated it one of my best dinners. I myself liked it but I felt it had too much spinach. There was also extra stuffing left and I even made 6 chicken breasts. Next time I will take the advice of others and also make the stuffed shells with it.

My family loved this! I changed the recipe by increasing the garlic to 2 fresh cloves, added additional spices, and used homeade sauce. I had a ton of filling left so I just baked it separately. I did read a suggestion to use it in stuffed shells and I will try that next time!

When making this delicious recipe, I decided it would be a good idea to pound out the chicken breasts. I also modified this recipe by reducing the spinach, using fresh garlic cloves, and adding italian seasoning. The sauce I used was very interesting. I used a jar of Alessi brand pasta sauce that was super spicy and mixed it with some homemade sauce. If you haven't made this recipe, I absolutely recommend it...(even though I didn't taste it, I'm veg). I made some spinach and ricotta stuffed shells to accompany this dish.

Wonderful. We had really thin chicken breasts, so we just slit them in the middle and ended up more topping the chicken than stuffing it, but it is really good.

This was great (as the only person in my house who likes spinach).  Everyone else loved the chicken, and left the filling.  I'll follow others' advice next time and halve the spinach.  It was surprisingly easy to prepare, and has great potential to be a family favorite.  I'll definitely make again.

Great tasting and suprisingly easy.  I used a little more spinach than required and it still turned out fantastic.  My husband loved it!

Excellant! My wife really like it. I did make some changes base on other comments. I add 2 cloves of garlic and didn't add all the spinach.   I left out about 1/2 to 1 oz. I forgot to measure it and my wife threw it away.

I really liked this recipe, my husband did not! He said he did not want me to ever make it again, but i really loved it.
My kids ate most of the portion but there was some left on their plates over half. I probably won't make this again unless its just for me and i will freeze them and take them to work

What a super recipe.  It is so easy to make and tastes like you spent hours in the kitchen.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and halved the stuffing.  I am so glad that I did even halved it is tons of filling.  They come out nice and stuffed.  I used a chunky Puttanesca sauce and it was perfect.  The only change that I might make in the future is to use cutlets instead of breasts (I might try rolling them).  My family prefers thinner cuts of meat.  Thanks so much Maria ~ This one is a real keeper!!

Fantastic stuff!!  I had never made this before, and served it to friends at dinner.  We ate 2/3 of the whole double-batch!!  I used one bag of mozz cheese and one bag of pepperjack, and skipped the garlic.  I also recommend spaghetti sauce with mushrooms in it.  VERY VERY GOOD!!!

This dish was GREAT!! My husband and I really enjoyed it.  I altered mine a little.  I am not big on spinach so I left it out.  I also added some shredded cheddar.  It did make quite a lot of the stuffing mixture which I poured over the chicken before adding the sauce. (We love cheese).  The chicken was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  I will definitely make this again and reccomend it to everyone!  Thanks!!

This recipe was good.  I only made 2 chicken breasts instead of the 4 it called for.  I didn't use the eggs either. I flattened the breasts,then put the filling in and rolled them up.  It was a new and different meal for my family.  I will make again and try to coat the chicken with bread crumbs like another person did.

This is great for low-carb diets. Very tasty. I cut both the stuffing and sauce mix in half and it made enough to fill six chicken breasts. Husband doesn't like spinach but he ate it which says alot.

This was great.  My husband and I aren't big spinach fans so I eliminated the spinach.  I also added pepperoni on top of the chicken.  It tasted like a more flavorful chicken lasagna.  I'll definetly be making this again.

I made these for my Sunday dinner yesterday.  They were fabulous.  I served with simple buttered noodles, and a fresh green salad with a basamic vinaigrette.  It was a huge hit at my house full of picky eaters.

Boyfriend liked this more than I did, but it was very good.  50 minutes at 350 degrees made the chicken a little too dry.  I seasoned the stuffing with Garlic salt, and a little fresh basil.  Will make again!!!  Thanks Maria!

Maria, Maria! This was such a tasty delight! I scaled the recipe down to serve 2. My boyfriend and I loved this delicious meal! The only thing I "amended" for this recipe, was that I used torn, fresh, baby spinach(about 3/4 C), about a T of minced onion, and added a good sprinkle or 2 of Italian seasonings to the stuffing mix. I also used my own homemade spaghetti sauce to smother the chicken with. I served it all over some angel hair pasta (cooked "al dente", of course!)My boyfriend raved how good this meal was! Also wanted to mention how easy and quick this was to prepare! Thank you Maria!

This is definitely a keeper. Out of personal preference next time I'll cut back on the amount of spinach, but other than that this is really good! We filled up about 5 breasts with the filling and they were all very plump. We flattened the breasts a bit (and again on each side after they were slit open), so we were able to fit a lot in. Very tasty!

Wow- this was a great recipe!  I serve it over spaghetti and used the lefover stuffing mix for other pasta dishes- it's great for stuffed pasta, or mix with tomato sauce for a lighter, tomato-spinach pasta sauce.  I'll make this recipe for anyone I want to impress!

Very delicious!  I really enjoyed eating this.  Some suggestions:  Make less stuffing.  It was really way too much - probalby 2/3 would be too good.  I didnt use toothpicks because if I did I wouldnt be able to put mmore than 2 tbsp filling per breast, so I just put in a huge amount and let it flow out.  I agree with other reviews that it could use more spices - I recommend adding italian seasonings and more garlic with teh filling, and then addingsome additional seasonings on teh surface of the meat.
