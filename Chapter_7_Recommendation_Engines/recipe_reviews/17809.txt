I used this recipe to coat dog biscuits in. I was reluctant about using it because of the sugar but I couldn't find any other recipe online so I gave in. It tastes fine, but I had to freeze the cookies to get the icing to form at all, and when I took them out to wrap them to give to people, the yogurt melted inside the plastic and ruined the look of them. I ended up throwing most of them away because I was embarrassed to give them out based on their appearence. I won't use this recipe again.

This was really tasty but I served it on the side at a staff meeting and encouraged people to dip their BLUEBERRY CREAM MUFFINS BY KK3 in it since it's runny. I will definatelty make this again but I might add a enough powdered surger to give it more body.

Used vanilla Greek yogurt and drizzled over Carrot and Raisin Bars from this site.  The vanilla yogurt brought a nice sweetness to the glaze.  Very nice non-sugar glaze, my husband said 5 stars.

Only used 1/2 cup fruit yogurt and brown sugar and it was the perfect glaze for a yogurt cake for my mom's birthday!

This was a quick and easy frosting to drizzle over some persimmon cookies I made. I gave it four stars because I used greek yogurt and added a 1/2 tsp vanilla.
