I grew up eating german potato salad and this was excellent, however, I like to add more vinegar and more water as the potatoes love to soak up the liquid. Try heating up the leftovers in a skillet and you'll be in for a real taste treat!

This is the best recipe for Hot German Potato Salad I have found. It's absolutely delicious. I use twice as much bacon as called for and more vinegar/less water. I love the tang of the vinegar. Also, I use chopped sweet onion instead of green onions and add a little dry parsley for color. Thanks for sharing your recipe, April. I love it.  Kaye

Good basic recipe.  I had to change it a little bit, because when I got my green onions out, they had gone bad, so I used part of a sweet Walla-Walla onion instead, and sauteed it in the bacon grease after taking the bacon out.  I also used white balsamic vinegar, which added a little more sweetness.  I used 2 extra bacon slices too, but took out some of the grease.  The dressing got really thick; not sure if it was supposed to or not, but it stuck to the potatoes this way which I thought was good.  Since I didn't have the green onions I used about a TBS. of dried chives for color.  I also used red unpeeled potatoes.  Had this with grilled sausages on wheat rolls and fresh corn on the cob.  Very good!

I fell in love with German Potato Salad when I was in high school and dated a guy who's mom was German.  My mom and I now use this recipe.  This is really more of a side dish than a salad.  The vinegar gives it a nice tangy flavor.  We add white, yellow or red onion rather than green.  Just don't have green on hand usually.  The onions and bacon give the salad a crispy texture.  I much prefer this to American potato salad with the mayo.

This was quick, easy AND yummy! My husband loved it. I'll definitely put this one in my recipe box. Thanks so much for the recipe! By the way, red or Yukon gold potatoes hold their shape better than russets. And pour on the dressing while the potatoes are still warm. They'll absorb more flavoring that way.

I made this dish with new potatoes instead of russet potatoes and it worked really well. I think next time I would add more vinegar as April suggested.

YUMMMMMY! I used red potatoes, and chopped them before boiling, and did not peel them. This saved a lot of time. I didn't have green onions, so I used dried minced onion, I added them with the water and vinegar to give them a chance to soften. My husband loved it as well. We are adding this one to the recipe box.

This is a good base recipe, the original recipe though adds cubed apples(2 med), pickles, onions and capers (optional). My german grandmother always made this for us and i still do!

Everyone just loved this when I served it with bratwursts--it tastes just like Mom's! To cut down on the prep time, use sliced, canned potatoes, drained and rinsed. It only took me 20 minutes start to finish!

I don't know what it is about warm potato salads, but they just don't do it for me.  I guess growing up with the cold versions have ruined my taste for them any other way. I did like the sweet/sour combination but not enough to make this again. I definitely hope I can fine a German Potato Salad I enjoy because they have gotten lots of good reviews.  Maybe one day I'll come across one that I do enjoy.  Thanks anyway April.

This is a good, but American-style German potato salad.  The kind my German grandmother used to make also had caraway seeds and some powdered mustard.  There were ALWAYS caraway or celery seeds in hers.  There are other optional delights which can be included that wouldn't offend my grandma's sense of propriety one bit.  After frying the bacon (not quite crisp), adding onions (maybe some chopped celery), cook till onion is yellow, then throw in celery seeds and/or caraway seeds, simmer till fragrant.

A roux is made by adding cornstarch or flour to the mixture, using the bacon drippings for fat (adding butter if needed).  When the flour bubbles, add the mixture of vinegar, sugar, S&P, maybe some garlic and/or dry horseradish.  These are pre-mixed, then added to the roux - cook till it thickens. (You can add water or chicken broth to increase the quantity.)  The best recipes are those which have a GENEROUS amount of sauce - and BACON!  I pre-mince my bacon before frying because it isn't always cooperative when I try to crumble it.

It should not have mushy spuds, but they MUST be very thoroughly cooked.  So I cook them in the skin - usually in a steamer, but boiling works.  Red potatoes are the VERY traditional standard, but I've found ordinary spuds will work, especially thoroughly cooked in their skins.  I can't always get the red ones.  They're preferred because of the slightly "waxy" texture, but plain skin-steamed potatoes will be somewhat that way.  When cooled, I strip

Great recipe. I added more bacon and green onion. Also I added parsley and a few crushed caraway seeds because I remember having German Potato Salad with them.

This is the best recipe I've found for german potato salad. I rarely make it just for 4 servings though. I usually make double it and freeze half for another day. Also, you can use this recipe to make a large warmer full for weddings, graduations, etc. I've made it twice with a 20lb bag of potatoes. It's a little time consuming but very easy to put together. Note: Don't understand why, but it tastes so much better if you immediately put this in the refrigerator for use the next day. When I do this and use my crock pot to warm it up before serving folks rave over it. Just not the same when I make it and serve the same day.

Excellent recipe! Very much like grandma and my mom Arndt made as I grew up in chi-town!  I noticed it doesnt say what kind of potato to use- and our family always added hard boiled egg- so heres my twist.  I used 2 ea. 3-lb bags of yukon golds, and steamed them with the delicious skin intact. Like everybody else i used more bacon so i could get more sauce.  Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe {doubled}.
I would add a hint when you make the sauce put your face down in there and sniff- it should smell vinegary but not overpowering- if so add some sugar. Oh, also- forget the water and make it michelob beer to thin it {or your brand?} enjoy! Tom

My husband loves this recipe. He and the rest of my family eat this up at every major holiday and outdoor picnic. It is easy to make and you can keep it warm in a crock pot to serve at outdoor activities, and is also good refridgerated. Love the recipe. Easy to follow!!!

Been making this for years but I do cube my potatoes before boiling them.  While they boil I cook the dressing because I find it more tasteful to add warm dressing to hot potatoes.  As another viewer said - add more liquid, potatoes will absorb the liquid and this salad has no mayonnaise so does not have to keep cold on picnics.

I make this recipe using equal proportions of the water, vinegar, and sugar - 1/2 cup each per 4 potatoes - and it tastes exactly like the German Potato Salad my mother makes (the same recipe that her German mother made).  I like this hot or cold, but be sure to add the dressing to warm potatoes so the flavor is distributed evenly throughout.

I didn't think my husband would go for German potato salad (I loved it as a kid) but he's crazy about this and has already requested it again.  I added chopped boiled eggs like my mother did and it tastes just like hers.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Made this for a group of friends on a boating weekend.  First night I liked it, but most others didn't... somehow the sweetness put them off.  Next day I added a bit more vinegar and more salt... it was received better.  Next morning I fried the leftovers in a little bacon grease until well browned and served it with eggs to RAVE reviews...  Maybe I should have done that first..

Very good version, not overpowering.  4 servings uses 1/3 of a 5 lb bag of smaller brown potatoes.  Apple cider vinegar is a good substitute.  I also added 1/2 cup of finely chopped onion, one clove chopped garlic, and some celery seed when cooking the coating for a more traditional flavor.

My German gram had a recipe for German Potato Salad which I lost.  Unfortunately, I don't make it often so I looked it up.  Yours was close but adding the water caused a big problem.  We had German Potato Soup.  I would suggest leaving the water out. I had to quadruple the recipe to satisfy the water content.

I wasn't sure if this was any good when we first started eating it, but as it cooled down the flavors blended and it just got better and better. I have no doubts that I'll be eating this stuff cold. Very yummy and my husband really liked them too.

April your salad is just delicious and easy to
prepare. We did not adjust the vinegar or the bacon but my children added just a touch of mayo
and prepared mustard to make it a little bit more
creamy. Thanks for sharing your family's favorite
with our family. Yum!!!

This was a big hit with my family on 4th of July.  My mother-in-law has to really watch her cholesterol, so I used pre-cooked bacon, and just heated it in a pan with a little olive oil, and used that instead of the bacon fat for the dressing.  It was healty for her, and delicious for the family!

So good!  I go a little over on the vinegar and bacon grease....I just think they work very well together, and more is better in this case.  I use rice wine vinegar, which is sweet, and as a result don't use much sugar.  If you're new to this dish, this recipe is very, very tasty as written and you will be safe.  My changes are from decades of various tastings.  This recipe is beautiful as written.  Thanks so much!

Easy recipe that tastes amazing.  I changed the bacon to pastrami, because we don't eat pork.  I also didn't use green onions.  Instead, I sauteed an onion until just before tender.  Mixed in the flour and then the rest of the ingredients.

This is my family's favourite potato salad! We prefer chopped Vidalia onions to the green, and I always use red skinned potatoes.  But the sugar, flour and vinegar is just perfect the way it is stated in the recipe.

This is a great recipe, and I made some variations to make it a quicker recipe:
First, I bought already cooked bacon from the salad bar at my local Giant food store; I put the cooked bacon, flour, water, vinegar, green onion, salt, and pepper in a skillet and cooked all together for a few minutes, then poured this heated mixture over the cooked potatoes (this is much easier when making a larger quantity for a party), instead of cooking all with potatoes in a skillet.
Also, I use 3/4 white vinegar and 1/4 cider vinegar ... the cider vinegar gives it a bit of a sweeter flavor.
Overall, an excellent recipe, and just thought I'd share a few things I stumbled upon in my experimenting : )

Thank heavens I couldn't find my recipe for German Potato Salad and found this one!!!  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 1 T. and this produced the best I've ever had.  Most folks would undoubtedly prefer the recipe as is, but hubby and I like less sweet than most.  Can't wait to make this for my mother who grew up eating German food...she'll adore this one.  Actually...this deserves 6 stars!!!

Very tasty. Just like my mother-in-law made. I sprinkle the bacon pieces at the table so they don't get too soggy. Adjust the sugar and vinegar to suit your own tastes.

Great recipe!  I added thinly sliced hard-boiled eggs to my Hot German Potato Salad. It really made a nice difference to the taste and appearance.  If your local grocery store carries "maple" flavored bacon - try this for an added bonus.

I spent two years in Germany during my first enlistment in the army.  I have tried many versions of "German" potato salad.  I like this one, but of course, made it my own.  I added some boiled eggs, dill pickles and a dash of the pickle juice.  All in all a good recipe.

We had smoked some Barbeque ribs and made this to go with it.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  It was a huge hit and there was nothing left in the bowl after dinner.  I will definitely make this again, I plan to slice some Kielbasa in with it.  This is an easy, delicious recipe.

Great. Next time, though, will want to decrease the amount of bacon grease used in the dressing... it was great the night I made it but the next morning it had gotten clumpy and congealed and did not reheat well. Other than that, great recipe. Will try next time with cider vinegar and grilled yellow onion.

Now, understand that I don't know what real German potato salad is supposed to taste like, but this was really, really good! One of my guests is not a fan of German potato salad, but she had a second helping...a large one, and raved about it. I served it with roasted chicken and broccoli. Next week I will serve it with grilled pork chops and make it with cider vinegar.

My husband 'volunteered' me to make German Potato Salad for a BBQ. I've never made it before and found this recipe.  It looked easy enough.  Instead of boiling potatoes, I microwave them.  It doesn't make that lovely mess when it's time to clean up.  Needless to say, the recipe was a HUGE hit.  I was asked several times for the recipe.  I got their e-mail address and simply came to back to the website and sent it to them.  I love this site and this collection of wonderful resource of recipes!

My husband wanted me to make German Potato Salad for a company lunch.  I found this recipe.  It was easy to change the servings and make a shopping list.  But I "forgot" to make the salad, so he did it.  His friends thought he bought it at a Deli!  Thanks!

This was good, but not the warm German potato salad I was craving. The first time I made it exactly as recipe states, and we threw most of it. Way too much vinegar. The second time, I only used half of what recipe called for in vinegar. This time we were able to eat it. It was good, but will probably look for a different recipe to try next time.

Very good and easy to make salad.  However, I did not like how sweet it was.  Next time I will put in less sugar and more vinegar.  Also, it took way longer to cook the potatoes.  I boiled mine for almost 30 minutes!

This potato salad is very good.  It is very similar to one that I used to get in a German restaurant.  The first time I made it I followed the instructions and boiled the potatoes for just over 15 minutes.  They were very undercooked; they were still crunchy, not just firm, crunchy.  The next time I made it, I boiled them for a little over 25 minutes.  This way they came out nice and firm but were at least cooked. Most recently I served this with Sausage 'n Kraut, also from this site for an all around German meal.

For 2 people, 2 large Russet potatoes was plenty which we cooked for about over 20 mins.  The white wine vinegar is much milder in taste than white vinegar and worked with this warm salad nicely.  The bacon adds a nice crisp texture to the salad. Will definitely be making this again.

Very delicious potato salad, but,instead of using the sugar , I used dill pickle juice & bread & butter pickle juice together & a little more vinegar to give it that zest. I also used fresh chopped basil & green onions from my garden.  Very yummy!!! Now, it is AWESOME GERMAN potato salad..

I made this recipe for the first time with last minute guest coming. It was an easy throw together and tasted great. I did however use regular onion, a medium one chopped and I sauteed it in the bacon grease before continuing on. It was fabulous. My husband liked it best the next day chilled.

I found this recipe today, had all the ingredients, and decided to try it.  It was DELICIOUS!  I absolutely recommend this recipe.  It has a twangy taste and the vinegar, coupled with the sugar, makes a great taste experience!

I will be making this again!  I did use 5 pieces of bacon, only because I love bacon.

Great recipe!!!

My boyfriend and I both did not like this recipe.  I think it has two much vinegar, however, that could just be my inexperience with cooking.

My husband is a Cincinnati firefighter and Cincy is a German city. I was looking for a recipe like this because he enjoyed it at work when some of the real old German guys made it.  He loves it, and so do I.  It is really authentic!  I also used new potatoes and extra bacon.  Yummy!

This recipe is the closest I have found to my grandmothers.  She never really wrote down a recipe, so I was delighted to find this.  I made a couple of changes - white onion instead of green for example.  Good flavor.

Absolutely delicious, but I felt there was some room for improvement, so I tinkered with it. Try this if you would prefer a much heavier bacon presence: use a full 12 oz. package of bacon (keep the extra grease, too!), 2 more potatoes, and 1/2 cup of vinegar.

This was a great potato salad, one of the best I've every had!  Having certain dietary restrictions, I used stevia instead of sugar, and gluten-free all-purpose flour, and there were no issues.  Definitely making this one again.

It was my first attempt at Hot German Potato salad. I did slice my potatoes instead of chopping them. I fixed it with brats and my boyfriend was so pumped about our German food night.

When following the recipe exactly, I felt this potato salad needed a bit more kick.  As others have suggested, I added a splash more vinegar, but I also added a large dollop of mustard.  I think mustard really helps bring out the flavor of the other ingredients.

We loved this recipe. 

I followed the instructions except that I sweated the onions in the bacon grease and then pushed them to the side of the skillet while I cooked the flour, sugar, vinegar. 

The next day I used a little butter(let it melt) and added the left over German potato salad.  I heated about 10 minutes and then flipped the potatoes and heated another 10 minutes.  I did not cover the potatoes  while heating.  It was delicious.

This is an excellent recipe.  As all recipes, you need to adapt it to your family.  I reserve the bacon fat and use what I need.  I do not use the the flour it really makes no difference.  I make a large batch, serve it warm the first time and cold the next.

Lived in Germany for 3 years, loved the potatoe salads.  This recipe was a little to sweet, will cut back on the sugar next time and try different vinegars.  My husband liked it.

Went to Bavaria last year and could not get over the hot potato salad served in all the best restaurants there. Got a craving for it about a month ago, used this recipe and it was just as great as I remember! And on the first try! Thank you for this recipe

I always add green pepper and celery to mine.  It gives it a better taste.  I boil my potatoes the night before and let cool.  Then peel and slice.  After I make it, I always let it set overnight so the flavors blend together.  Really good!!

I have been making German potato salad for years, and finally have found one the I truly LOVE. It is so easy to make. I used regular sweet onions because I didn't have green onions on hand. Thank you April for this wonderful recipe!! My Husband says it is like eating candy....not because it is sweet, but because he can't stop eating it.

Wow.  I never review recipes but I had to add my 2 cents here. This recipe is *fantastic*  I used red potatoes and before I made the dressing, I tossed a handful of diced Vidalia sweet onion in the hot fat for a few minutes (bc I didn't have green onions).  I pulled them out with a slotted spoon and did the rest as listed.  I only needed half of the dressing (for about 6 small red potatoes), so I saved the rest and am making more for lunch today bc my boyfriend and I loved it so much! This is a permanent addition to my recipe box!

i followed this recipe to a T and was a bit disappointed. there wasn't enough sauce to completely coat the potatoes, and the salad ended up too dry. Next time I'll increase the recipe so there is more sauce. the flavor was very good.

I liked the variation with the green onion.  It adds a fresher taste.  My kids (8 and 11) gobbled this up.

This was very good. After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to modify it a bit. I used half balsamic vinegar, and half white vinegar, though the sauce is more dark than usual. I used one sweet onion since we were out of green onions, with dried chives for color. And used a little more water, but cooked the sauce until it was thick. I then added the onions and bacon to the sauce right before i poured it over the potatoes. But before i poured it, i added enough sugar until it balanced out the vinegar. Like all sauces, taste and modify it as needed before pouring over potatoes.

Super sinful and delicious salad.  Substituted white vinegar for the white wine vinegar and used more bacon.  The whole family liked it - including  my preschooler and toddler.

My husband absolutely loved it, especially when served warm.  Fortunately I had made bacon that morning.  Now I save some of the bacon fat to have it ready for the summer of German potato salad.

Very tasty, but when I reduced the recipe to two servings, there was little bacon drippings and "sauce" to coat the potatoes. However, when I tripled the flour, sugar and vinegar, wisked it together and added it to the pan, it was just the right amount. Since I like it a little more tart, I would decrease the amount of sugar.

While there is no new "wow" factor to this recipe, it is dead on standard and extremely simplistic. Don't forget the schnitzel and spaetzl to go with it!

Good recipe. Very similar to one I have from German friend. We gently cook a chopped onion the the bacon drippings and at the end of mixing all sauce ingredients add 2 tsp. of Angostura bitters. The bitters give it a really great subtle flavor. And a bottle of bitters lasts forever.

WE LOVE THIS RECIPE AS IS but the next few times I made it I added our "personal" touches.  I quadrupled the recipe as I have a BIG eaten family. I used red potatoes (large and small), boiled whole with skins for approx. 15 minute (took each one out when tender) let them cool then sliced in quarters. Used 24 oz. of "Smokey" bacon (chopped in small pieces prior to frying), used 1 large chopped sweet onion (use less next time) and sautéed in bacon grease after bacon removed. Used a bit less sugar, raw apple cider vinegar (more), veggie stock/broth instead of water (more when needed), added celery seed, dry mustard, some chopped up dill pickle and juice, and added fresh parsley at the end (all for personal preference). I cook everything on stove top in a huge frying pan, fry bacon, remove, add chopped onion, and then add flour etc..... tweak as I'm making, as we LOVE LOTS OF FLAVOR!!!! The salad tastes MUCH BETTER the next day and so on!  We love German Potato Salad!!!This recipe is AWESOME AS IS, tweak to your desire~ THANK YOU & Bon Appétit

This recipe with the bit of flour sizzled in the bacon fat is exactly what I grew up with.  Love it!  Some shredded hard-boiled eggs and chives on top for garnish (extra protein: farm-fresh eggs!), yep, now that's heaven!  Thank you for posting this honestly German recipe.

To reduce saturated fat, I removed at least half the bacon fat before cooking.  After the cooked bacon was removed from the pan and crumbled, I added a quarter cup of extra light olive oil to make up for the missing bacon fat. You might want to add more,  but it was fine for my taste.

Very Good and modified it slightly per suggestions the 2nd time with slightly more regular vinegar and diced sweet onion for my own preference. The base recipe is great as well. 
For any potato salad I always cube the potatoes with skin on and cook them that way, a great time saver

It went pretty well though i prepared sauce for 2 potatoes but realised too late that there are 3 potatoes.... so not enough sauce. But I bet it will taste great if there is enough. I added tiny cubes of boiled carrots and celery to add some cunch and color and it was great. =)

Slight Modifications for my taste. I steamed sliced, 8 small Redskin and 4 med sized Gold Potatos for 15 minutes on Med-HI and I used 1/3 cup of White Wine Vinegar and added two tea spoons of salt and a teaspoon of black pepper. I used 1/4 lb of Smoked Bacon, I used dried chives because I did not have fresh on hand. But I tell you. It came out wonderful. Like MY German Mother made it before she turned into an Organic Green Smoothie Sucker.   Love you though.    Great Recipe, I love it.

I had been craving something like this for a long time and so I decided to make it. I loved it and so did my guests... However, I have a confession... I thought I had vinegar but it turned out that was not the case...So, when opening my fridge I noticed I some prosecco (sparkling wine). It was delicious.

This was delicious!  I am not a fan of regular potato salad so this was perfect for me.  I doubled the bacon though...a must.  I also substituted the white wine vinegar for just regular white vinegar...came out awesome.  Delicious the next day.  YUM!

Pretty good but it seemed to be a bit sweeter than other recipes I've made and I think I like it better with a little bite so next time I'll probably cut back the sugar a bit.

I've made this twice, & it's 'goof proof'..I even e-mailed it to my Daughter.. It's a great 'comfort' food in the Winter. Didn't change anything to the recipe, goes with any 'main course'..

Absolutely delicious!!!  I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar simply because I didn't have any white wine vinegar in the cabinet.  I won't be trying it with white wine vinegar because the dish was unbelievably delicious with the apple cider vinegar.  I highly recommend trying this recipe!

I have been wanting to make warm potato salad for along time. I used white vinegar because that was all I had. It was a bit strong so I added more water and sugar. I couldn't find green onions in the stores so I added parsley and chives. It was still really good.

Delicious for fall dinner with Brats. I've never made one before but will do again. I would probably cut down on the sugar and let more the vinegar tanginess shine  through.

I absolutely love this potato salad! I make it a lot with pork chops or bratwurst and sauerkraut. I use a little more vinegar, but we just like it more vinegary.

Twice I made this and both times I could close my eyes and taste the recipe my German immigrant gramma made so many years ago.  I agree with bumping up the vinegar and bacon, and I sautee sweet white onions in the rue before adding the potatos.

I made this for "German" Day at work.  It was just like what my mom used to make.  Only change I would make is cut the potato's in half before boiling.

This was really really good. I love good German Potato salad. I made this recipe exactly as written and it was awesome! I do think next time I will cut the sugar just a bit...I like the tang of the vinegar and it is complimented well by the sugar, but I would prefer a bit more tang and salty and a little less sweet. Just my personal preference. All in all...this potato salad ROCKS!

This turned out great! I used precooked bacon crumbles (real bacon), and left out the flour & water. I added a couple of tablespoons of sour cream. This was better than the potato salad at my favorite German deli!

Delicious! As close to Oma's as I'm ever going to get. My only variation on this one is that instead of using green onions, I used a sweet onion, chopped it finely, and sauteed it in the bacon fat before adding the ingredients to make the sauce. The only thing left was to lick the bowl once the salad had been ravaged!

Very good recipe.  My husband loved this. I used red potatoes and added 1 tsp of celery seed.  Next time, I'll use a little more bacon.  I'd recommend adding the sauce to the potatoes in a separate dish, that way you can adjust the sauce to potato ratio to your liking.  Thanks for a great quick and easy recipe!

I've made this a couple of times now and have been very pleased with this recipe! It was so easy to make and really tasted great!  I did make two small changes, I used Splenda instead of the sugar and I used half white wine vinegar and half cider vinegar just because I like the sauce just a little more tart than by using just the white wine vinegar alone.  Oh, and I did double the amount of sauce as previously recommended and it was just perfect!  Thank you for sharing this delicious  recipe! This is now truly a family favorite and I will definitely make it again and again! I serve it with baked chicken or pork chops and a green salad.

This was very good, fairly quick and very easy to make.  I agree to increase the sauce.  The only part I wouldn't increase is the sugar.  A little too sweet...  I made the four potatoes as called for in the recipe for four servings but then made the sauce for 6 servings.. increased the bacon to 6 servings as well.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will surely make this again!

This was a really good dish. I had it saved for so long and was hesitant but kept reminding myself that I love vinegar on fries. It was tangy and sweet - didn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

This was my first attempt at making German Potato Salad and it was definitely a winner!  It was so easy to make I wasn't sure how good it would taste.  I ran out of white vinegar so I used half white and half apple cider vinegar-it was REALLY good-I think a little more flavor was added from this.  Of course, everything is better with bacon!  I made this with my cast iron skillet and it made a nice little crust on the potatoes.

This was very good but I do have a couple suggestions.  First, don't use all the dressing as it is very strong and will completely overpower the potatoes.  Second, add about 3/4 tsp of ground mustard seed to the dressing.

I changed the recipe a bit to be vegetarian friendly... I used chopped sauteed peppers in place of the bacon pieces and the leftover oil for drippings. This may be why the finished product was so bitter for me. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and the sauce was so overpowered with the vinegar and sugar that it was almost inedible. I even used extra potatoes and still felt that this was not as mild and soothing as the authentic potato salad I remember from Germany. My advice: only follow the original recipe if you are a huge fan of vinegar. Otherwise, cut it down to just a few tablespoons and halve the sugar.

I've been looking for a good German Potato salad recipe for some time and this one is excellent.  Simple ingredients, easy preparation and the ability to revise the zing factor is so easy.  Great dish.

Very easy to make and a great compliment to any dish. I sauteed celery with the onions instead of using celery seed because my husband doesn't like that seasoning. Whole family loved it!

This potato salad has a great flavor.  I added two extra strips of bacon and it was really good.  I should have chopped the potatoes smaller so they would be more coated with the sauce though.  And they are better when they're reheated.

After reading the comments about how good it was the next day, I made it in the morning and let it sit, then just reheated when company came!
Everyone liked it! said it was better than our favorite german restaurant!
I used almost 1/2 & 1/2 vinegar to water, kept the sugar the same, was just right for us.

I made this recipe and another potato recipe for a dinner party for 14 people.
Everyone decided that this was the best. Now it is requested  for all of our
gatherings. It is easy and if you're lucky enough to have any leftovers, it is
great the next day.

My family LOVES this! I made it with an entire bag of potatoes, and most of a package of bacon. I froze some of it and it thawed nicely. I have made it about 6 times now in big batches. EXCELLENT! Some of us eat it hot, some eat it cold.

I really thought that this recipe was awesome! The only changes I made were to use cider vinegar and double the sauce as the potatoes soak up so much flavor.  My husband loved it! It is also great the next day cold! My go to GPS recipe from now on.

The first time I made this I made the mistake of following the advice of a lot of the reviews and added a bit more vinegar, shouldn't have done that. The amount in the recipe is just fine. Great recipe as is but the second time around I added 3 chopped eggs, 1 chopped pickle and some parsley. Yum!

Love German potato salad. My grandmother and mom always added celery seed to the recipe. And fried the onions in a little butter to help flavor up the recipe. Mmmm! My kids love it!

I never made German Potato Salad before; this recipe was easy to follow. If you can, get a Maple bacon then you won't need sugar in this recipe. Also, you might need to add more flour, bacon fat and white wine vinegar to get the right consistency to make the dressing.

I made this for a party and it was a hit.  It does take time to make.  I boiled the potatoes longer than suggested because I didn't want them to be crunchy.  I also used more bacon and sugar than the recipe called for.  I used sweet onion, chopped fine, and I only used about a quarter of a cup.  All in all, it was wonderful.  I kept it warm in a Crock Pot.

If you love German food, you'll enjoy this recipe.  I double the amount of ingredients for the dressing cuz I like lots!  I also use regular onions and lightly brown them in the skillet with the bacon grease.   Served with weiner schnitzel, or smoked link sausage like Eckrich, or bratwurst and you'll have a traditional German meal.

This is an excellent recipe.  It is great the day you make it but, according to my husband, even better the next day.  I made the recipe with no changes.

Wow - way too much sugar, was actually sweet!  Not what I was looking for, sorry. On a quest for a salad similar to one I had in Munchen and this was nowhere close. Wish I could say otherwise.

This was great. It did not take that long to actually make. I made this with some smoked susage and green beans and my family loved it. Especially since my husband nor son had ever had german potato salad. I will be making this again.

I loved this potato salad.  It is more of a side dish than a salad, but it was very good.  The only complaint was that there was a little too much liquid.  Definately making this again.  It makes excellent leftovers.  My kids were arguing over who got them.  They are all under 8yrs old.

Easy to follow recipe (although I let the potatoes boil a bit longer).  I doubled the recipe for a church event and it was very well liked by those in attendance.

This was wonderful!  I did use a yellow onion because it's what I had at home, and a tablespoon of dijon mustard.  I was literally licking my plate!  Thinking of making it again tonight with some BBQ steaks:)  Great recipe.

My great grandma used to make german potato salad. I had not had any in a very long time. Sadly I never spent enough time with her for her to teach me how to cook german. I had been craving the taste for almost 10 years. Thank you for sharing your secrets! The german potato salad was wonderful!

I have never had German Potato Salad before so I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like but this was pretty good.  If I were to make it again I think I would use much less sugar and more vinegar. the only thing I didn't like was the sweetness of it but maybe it's supposed to be like that...anyway, Thanks for the recipe

I omitted the onions (didn't have any) and substituted rice wine vinegar for white for the same reason.  Everything still worked out great. I will be making this again!

I thought I was making the first GPS that I had made a couple months ago...I was not...Thsi salad had a relatively "nice" taste but the smell was very over-powering. The texture was not what I like. I will not used this recipe again... I'll just stick with the "Authentic German Potato Salad" that I had started off with.

Loved it! I can't stand cold, mayonnaise-y potato salad, but I love potatoes and with summer cookouts going on, it's nice to have a quick easy side salad.  This is delicious!  I didn't have any onions on hand so I used a few shakes of onion powder. I also used cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. I needed to cook my potatoes (medium sized red-skin) a lot longer, probably 25-30 min.  I also added a dollop of country-style dijon mustard like a previous reviewer recommended.  I will definitely make this again!

I wish that the recipe stated what kind of potatoes and what size. I used four medium potatoes but there wasn't enough sauce to cover them. This didn't turn out very well. I did like the flavor. Next time I will make more sauce.

DELICIOUS, JUST LIKE MY MOM USE TO MAKE. 
ONLY THING IS I USED APPLE CIDAR VINEGAR, AND DIDN'T COOK THE POTATOES LONG ENOUGH. THEY WERE STILL HARD. BUT I ADDED A LITTLE WATER AND MORE VINEGAR AND COVERED IT. LET IT SIMMER TILL THE POTATOES WERE SOFTENED. PERFECTION!!!!
THANK YOU

These are good, but very different.  My husband lived in Germany and he said this is very similar to what he had over there.  We ate it a little luke warm, and it's much better to eat really warm or hot.

I loved this recipe.  I have been going to a lot of BBQ's this past year, and this potato salad has always been a hit.  I don't normally have green onions on hand, so I have been substituting red onions instead.  It tastes delicious!  Such a nice change from American style potato salad.

This is just not that great! My grandma is german, so I have been raised around "german potato salad" and there is just something off about this recipe. I have tried it 2 times and both times it just did not stand up to my expectations. (I just can not quite pinpoint the problem, the first time it was too salty, then the second time it was too sweet : P )There are definitely better recipes out there!!!

Authentic German flavor. I substituted red onion which I briefly cooked before adding. Agree that potato salad with mayo is not as good as this recipe. Deutsch Kartoffel Salat - sehr gut.

Very good.  My husband liked it alot.  I think I will definitely need to add more vinegar to it next time though.  I used red onions instead of green because I'm more fond of them in salads.

Great recipe! After I made the potato salad I put it in a pot on the stove on low for a hour to let the favors come together.

Also , I added a few chopped pickles.

My boyfriend is from Germany and it came close to his mother's recipe.

Seemed a bit to sweet.  I think there should be more of the mixture as well.  That being said, it WAS my first time making German Potato salad and all seem to be happy with it.  I will try it again.

Great salad. I make it as written. No mods other than salt and pepper to taste. Leftovers (if any) can be warmed up or its even great cold. I eat it with grape tomatoes and cucumber.

I kept the skins on the potatoes and made it gluten-free by substituting corn starch for the flour.

The proportions for the sauce were "slight."  Need to make more or the salad won't have that good German Potato Salad texture.

I am 4th generation German and this is true German potato salad.  I used canned sliced potatoes because they hold up so well.  My mom, grandma, and great grandma didn’t use onions but the rest is spot on.

I’ve made this potato salad twice and its perfect! The only change I made was white onion cooked in the bacon fat.  It’s the perfect balance  of sweet and tangy!

I didn't make any changes and yes, I'll definitely make it again.  I had tried another German Potato Salad recipe or two from this section but they didn't call for the flour and I was displeased with the consistency of the "dressing."  This recipe is really great!  Just don't burn the bacon (like I seem to do, LOL).  I have used regular white vinegar  when I didn't have white wine vinegar and it seems to taste just as good.

My mom was German, she made this her entire life.  She used white onions only, red potatoes only, and cut them in 1" bite size pieces.  She fried the bacon, removed, then fried the white onion, added vinegar & sugar.  After the sauce was done, she would pour it over the potatoes that were seasoned with salt & pepper in a bowl and lightly toss.

I hate how some people here label there recipes "authentic", especially when the recipes are ethnic. Every grandmother/mother cooked to their own taste, and with what  was available to them. There are a gazillion recipes that could be labeled as authentic, and not just one. This was a good one

I tripled this recipe for a family gathering, cooking the potatoes the night before and refrigerating them.  I cut the sugar in half, used chicken broth instead of water, added a little more vinegar, and used yellow onions instead of green.  My bacon was lean, so it wasn't too greasy. Once it was done, I transferred it to a slow cooker to keep it warm.  Delicious!  I'd make it again.

Yummy & easy! I omitted the sugar, and I broke up the potatoes in the pan with a wooden spoon so they were warm when I added them to the sauce. Family loved it, asked for more bacon next time though, lol. I will be making this again.

The first recipe I followed on the Website was German Potato Salad. I followed the directions and I cooked the onions in the bacon fat. The German Potato Salad came out too greasy and I threw it out. I did the Red Potato (egg salad) and that came out great.

Very good recipe, in the main, but depending on the type of potatoes you use, and how thick you like the "dressing" you may want to cut back on the flour a bit. I used eight potatoes for our group, but kept the tablespoon of flour, which I found to be a bit too much. I at least doubled the water, and used a combination of cider and white wine vinegar. There was a brightness to the white wine vinegar which surpassed the organic cider vinegar I had. Which surprised me a bit. I also added a bit of garlic (I love it in most stuff), and substituted sliced yellow onion and parsley for the green onions/scallions, which I didn't have. And that was great. I also added a bit more bacon fat (which I keep in reserve in my freezer), which was necessary for the quantity of potatoes I used. I salted the water to cook the potatoes liberally, but you still need to salt fairly heavily to get some flavor into the spuds. I had suggestions from various folks while I was making it (always fun!) to add some whole grain mustard, which I elected not to do. 

Also, this same recipe but without the flour yields a brighter, tarter version, which I tend to prefer personally, but my family LOVED the thicker dressing!

I didn't have big potatoes so used baby red and yukon potatoes. It was excellent. I found the sauce enough, but next time I may experiment and double the sauce - just to see what that is like. A keeper.

I doubled the recipe to have leftovers. It's great, but definitely let it stand for about 20 mins., the flavor comes together then. I used the recipe as written but did use red wine vinegar instead of the white. It was a hit but no way is the prep time 10 mins.
I will make it again!

09.15.16 ~ Yum! I loved this dish. I had a can of potatoes in the cabinet, so I used those rather then boiling my own. I scaled the recipe back and then made with the listed ingredients. The results were a nice tangy German potato salad with just the right flavoring. This recipe worked great on a night I needed to pull dinner together, quickly. Thanks April, for sharing your recipe.

First time making hot potato salad, but tasted just like many I've enjoyed before and was a lot simpler and quicker to make than imagined..  Basically followed the recipe though added celery seed to the dressing alongas it was in most of those I've had before.  When tasting the dressing it seemed a bit too vinegary, but once the potatoes were added It was fine, in fact might up to 1/3 cup next time.  Thanks for the great addition to my recipe box.

as others suggested, I doubled the recipe but I more than doubled the bacon, but kept only a 1/4 of the fat (there was too much), and increased the vinegar and instead of water i used chicken broth (about 3/4 cup). I cooked the potatoes whole and cut them hot and added all together hot. It was a hit. Next time a little less broth as it was a bit too soupy.

I really liked this recipe. I made only a few changes for my taste. I tried it with one tablespoon of sugar because I like more tang than sweetness. Next time, I will omit it entirely. I used white balsamic vinegar, but I am sure it is just as good with white wine vinegar. I added some chopped celery to the green onion and cooked them in the bacon grease along with the sugar, flour, vinegar and water. That it just because I wanted them soft like the potatoes. And I also added more vinegar and water because I agree with another reviewer that the potatoes soak up a lot of liquid. And don't be shy with salt and pepper. The salt helps to enhance the bacon flavor.

Pretty good. I had to make twice the amount of sauce called for to cover four potatoes; that was before it even soaked in. Didn't have green onions so I sauteed onion in the grease before adding sauce ingredients and added chopped fresh chives before serving.

This only turned out okay. I thought the dressing was a bit too thick so I thinned it out with a bit of water and adjusted the salt. I will try it again but use a saltier pork to kick up the flavour a bit.

This was Really good. I steamed russets whole then peeled the skin off while they were warm but cool enough to handle. Doubled the sauce, but found it too sweet for my taste. Hubby loved it. I used apple cider vinegar which maybe added to the sweetness, too. Would make again with white vinegar and no sugar.

This is a wonderful recipe!  My tips: 

I omit the flour(I've never used it)

I cut up the bacon with scissors and microwave it as a mess saver.

I combine vinegar & sugar then add bacon dripping to chill them down before I whisk in the egg.  

Bring to a boil and this FANASTIC!

Wonderful recipe and one of my husbands favorites!! I only wish the recipe would state the WEIGHT of the potatoes as I anguish over how big of potatoes I should use every single time but good flavors and just like our favorite German restaurant!

I saw the reviews for this recipe and thought it sound very good. I made it and it tasted awful.  I let it sit overnight and thought that would help.  It did not.  Maybe I did something wrong but I would not  recommend this recipe to anyone.

I started making this potato salad to try something different.  My family and friends LOVE it!!!  When we start talking about having a potluck or BBQ they nominate me for the potato salad.  Thanks for sharing with us April.

My husband (who isn't a fan of American potato salad) loved this recipe.  I substituted lower-fat turkey bacon for the regular, and it still tasted great.  I took other reviewer suggestions and put in 1/3 c. vinegar to 1/4 c. water, and I used 1/2 a small, regular onion because that's what I had on hand.  Will make over and over!

Great potato salad if you want something other than the mayo same old same old. I add 2T whole grain mustard to give it a little extra kick. Easy to make, easy to take to a bbq.

This is a delicious side dish. I get requests for it all the time. The vinegar and sugar create a great contrast to the salty bacon and crisp green onions. Definitely a favorite of mine.

The dressing didn't work out for me, but I guess it's just a problem of proportions (I didn't stick to the recipe). Otherwise, the salad tastes great and is really easy to make. Thanks!
