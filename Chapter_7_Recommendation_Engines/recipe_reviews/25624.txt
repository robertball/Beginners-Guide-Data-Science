I think it may be a better idea to add the eggs after the hot wet ingredients are added to the dry ingredients because heating the eggs caused them to cook a little.

Excellent recipe. Light and fluffy cake with a nice thick topping. Very rich tasting (have a lot of milk on hand for your guests to drink). I constantly stirred the contents of the saucepan until everything came to a boil (to avoid cooking the eggs as another Reviewer had that problem) and it worked out fine. One last note, warm up the chocolate icing when you are ready to ice the cake, it spreads a lot easier.

It smelt good and looked good before I put it into the oven. It didn't turn out at all, it was hard and thick and didn't puff up, I followed your instructions exactly and would like to know how everyone else succeded!
Very disappointed :(

This is superb, however, I have "cheated" and used box cake mix and even box brownies, then made the peanut butter & chocolate toppings as directed.  Everyone always loves it.

If I could give this recipe six stars i would. I made this cake for my finance's birthday, and he loved it!  The cake was sooo moist, and the frosting was absolutely delicious.  I did take the advice of adding the eggs after the hot ingredients are added to dry.  I used crunchy peanut butter and it was great!  I will defiantly make this again

Although I think this cake and frosting were great, it was a bit rich.  I was hesitant to add oil to the peanut butter and in hindsight I don't think it was needed at all (in fact, it really didn't even need the peanut butter to be delicious!) I would make again but definately would leave the oil out of the PB.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We did as other readers suggested and put the eggs in with the dry ingredients.  Everything else we followed to the T!  The batter was scrumptious and so was the bottom of the cake which was still stuck in the pan.  Since they worked so hard to make the cake, I just allowed the little ones to eat the stuck part right out of the pan.  Yummy cake, but would probably make better cupcakes!!

it's very moist and goey in the centre, and the icing is quite something! I got away with much less, thou, beacause they seem not to appreciate too strong an icing presence around here. Fabulous indeed!!

DELICIOUS. Wanting to make a dessert that contained my favorite thing, chocolate, and my boyfriends fav (peanut butter) I decided to try this recipe. He is not much a chocolate person but he even had seconds.  This was the most moist cake I have ever made. I did as others suggested and mixed the egg with the dry ingredients.  Will make this for our family Christmas dinner and it is sure to be a hit.

This is the buttermilk chocolate cake I've been making since 1969. (A super neighbor gave the recipe to me). Sometimes it's called Texas Sheet Cake, Texas Brownies, Buttermilk Sheet Cake, Brownies for a Crowd, etc. Some reviews were low and said the eggs turned into scrambled eggs.  That might be due to the process, not the ingredients.  The original calls for the water, cocoa, & butter to be brought to a boil.  Then to pour the hot mixture over sugar, flour, & baking soda in a large bowl. Add buttermilk, eggs, & vanilla last. Then pour it into either a 9 x 13" pan, or a large cookie sheet pan with narrow sides. Some recipes call for the soda to be added to the buttermilk.  Either way works, & I think that if you follow this technique, your cake will turn out perfectly.  Also, some recipes call for a very hot oven: 400 degrees, if baked in the cookie sheet pan. And to bake it for a shorter amount of time if doing this.

This cake turned out perfect! I added the eggs to the sauce pan once I removed chocolate mix from heat, then added to dry as suggested.  The cake turned out moist and the icing was delicious.  You just poor the icing over the peanut butter once it's cool. Taste like a Reeses PB cup! Next time I'll add Reeses Pieces to the top for some color!

Delicious cake and icing. I added the eggs after was well, good call. Also I added crushed graham crackers and reeses pieces to the peanut butter mixture and used 1/2 the oil suggested. It was great. I also used the reeses pieces to decorate the top of the cake, a nice touch!

Rating this cake on the mixture itself (we do not eat peanut butter) and it is very good.  One of the view chocolate cake recipes that isn't loaded with baking soda.

Very good flavor.  I made for my father-in-law's 91st birthday and he loved it.  I would reduce the cooking time by 5 minutes next time as it seemed a teeny bit dry.

It was my turn to make the office birthday cake so I was looking for something that would satisfy our love for the 2 basic food groups, chocolate and peanut butter. After reading all the reviews I made the cake, adding the eggs to the dry mixture and omitting the oil (I put the peanut butter in the microwave for 15 seconds to make it more spreadable).   I also used chunky peanut butter which we all love. I hate trying a recipe for the first time on company, but the reviews led me to believe I had nothing to worry about and they were right!!!!  It was a hit, everyone loved it. And I agree. It was moist, rich and yummy. Well worth the caloric intake. I will definitely make this cake again.

Oh my....Oh, my....oh...my.  We have to thank my 6 year old birthday girl for finding this one.  "I want a chocolate peanut butter cake, Mommy, with Alice in Wonderland on it and the Cheshire Cat and her kitten...".  So I found this recipe to fit the demands.  And boy! (or should I say --girl!)  Most of what I use is organic, which I think boosts the taste factor in and of itself.  But that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a great recipe!  I chose to use a generous 2/3 cup of wheat pastry flour and the rest white.  I used a scant 2 cups of sugar (crystals from cane juice if you are interested), but otherwise followed the recipe.  Oh, I did add some nuts on top of the frosting, crushed peanuts because of Alice (I didn't want the picture of her taking off frosting when I removed her so the nuts made a barrier).  And I think I'll do that every time because I thought they were really good with it.  I baked it the full 25 minutes, and it is still incredibly moist.  It was done, pulling away from the sides of the pan and coming clean with a tester, but still is very moist (even with the wheat flour!).  It's sweet, no doubt.  But it's not set-your-teeth-on-edge sweet.  Everyone enjoyed it, especially the birthday girl!

Was okay, but wasn't as good as expected. The cake reminded me (and others) of spice cake and the frosting was good but not great. The recipe was easy to follow, but I won't make again.

I have been making this exact same recipe since the late sixties and it has been a must for every family gathering for about fifty years.  My mother had made it from a recipe in the New York Daily News and I’m curious about how it got to All Recipes.  The cake seems to come out differently every time but it is always very dense, never light and fluffy, so that comment was a surprise to me.  I always use quite a bit less sugar.  My chocolate frosting is sometimes too thin and slides off the peanut butter.  Has anyone  changed the recipe to make it thicker?  Here’s the original recipe from the paper, taped together many times.

I made the cake as directed, though I added the eggs after the initial mixture cooked on the stove, as others advised. I was disappointed. The texture came out very dense. It was moist, but the cake just wasn't that chocolatey to me. I took it to work for a birthday. The comments were fairly positive, but half the cake was left over. I will probably just do the Black Magic Cake (which is always a hit for me) and try this peanut butter/frosting combo on that.

Delicious! Why I liked it and will make it again: ingredients on hand, easy to make -- don't need an electric mixer, the cake was very moist, amazingly not too sweet, and it came out perfectly and as I expected. I made two small changes: for the peanut butter layer, I used 2 cups of peanut butter and 1/2 stick of softened butter, deleting the vegetable oil. This made for a very flavorful, smooth and easy-to-spread peanut butter layer. Secondly, I combined the raw eggs and the buttermilk together and then added it to the saucepan after I had removed it from the heat. Without the peanut butter layer, this will be my new chocolate sheet cake recipe.

I added the eggs to the dry and wet mix after I had already mix them. I also thinned the frosting out by adding more buttermilk which I put into a Ziploc bag and drizzle across the top. Other than that I followed the instructions to the tee and it turned out excellent.

I have had and used this recipe since 1975.  I melt the butter on low heat in the pan, then beat the eggs and add them with the cold water and buttermilk and stir continuously and have no problem with the eggs cooking. This is NOT a recipe for dieters! It is very rich and very delicious - and addicting. If you like the combination of chocolate with peanut butter, I think you will LOVE this recipe!  I like it best when I have a cup of hot coffee with COLD piece of this cake, but a glass of milk with a piece of this cake is pretty darned good too.

I loved this recipe! I did make a few changes though. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 1 cup of whole milk. I also used 1/2  cup of water instead of 1 cup. I added the peanut butter (3/4 cup) into the saucepan with the coco powder, butter(only 1/2 cup), milk, and water. For the eggs, I cracked them in another bowl, beat them, then I tempered the eggs by spooning 4-5 scoops of the hot coco/peanut butter mixture into the eggs as I whisk it. I then slowly poured the whole egg mixture into the saucepan as I whisk it. After this I poured the hot mixture into the flour/baking soda/(1/2 tsp salt)/sugar (only 1 1/2 cups)mixture, and mixed. I poured that mixture into a greased pan and placed it into a 350*F preheated oven. Baked for 20 mins and I immediately put the cake in the freezer for 15-20 mins to stop the cooking.(Next time i will bake at a lower heat because I did get a little crust around the cake) For the frosting I just made a regular chocolate frosting using 2oz of german chocolate, 3 tbls butter, milk, and confectioners sugar. Twas soo yummy!

I should probably delete this from my recipe box it was THAT GOOD!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I followed others advice, (no oil with the PB and to add the eggs with the dry stuff so they would'nt cook)  I will definitley make this again and again.

This is the best cake ever!! My son loves Reese's Peanut Butter candy and this cake comes as close to that as it can. I made it for his birthday and they were scraping the pan clean. I will be making this cake again!

I made this cake for a co-workers birthday and it was gone in 10 minutes!! Everyone loved it.  The cake is not overly sweet so the icing provides just the right amount of sweetness. Great recipe!!

Tried this last night for my husband's birthday with wonderful results.  Ran out of cocoa after the cake portion so substituted 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and cut the margarine in half for the icing.  Sprinkled peanut butter baking chips on top. Mmmmmmm!

This is outstanding.  I served it to 7 kids and they all cleaned their plates.  Usually they just eat the icing, but this is so good they ate the whole thing.  Very moist.  Perfect blend of peanut butter and chocolate.
