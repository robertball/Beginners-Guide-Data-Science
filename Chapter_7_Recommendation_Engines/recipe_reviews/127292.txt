YUM! As suggested, I used 1 box vanilla & 1 box coconut cream pudding.  the best!  I think toasting the coconut adds a VERY nice change - it's my favorite part!  Great recipe!

The easiest pie to make and also the BEST Coconut Cream Pie that we have ever had. I did use 8oz canned evaporated milk and 8 oz of regular milk, plus added a little bit of vanilla to the recipe.  It was yummy and didn't last long.

DH said it was best coconut pie he's ever had! I did make a couple changes...I topped with traditional meringue instead of whipped cream and added a little extra toasted coconut. Easy and wonderful. Will make again.

If you are looking for a pie that tastes like pudding with coconut added in, this is the recipe for you.  It is super easy to make, but did not come near to my expectation for coconut cream pie.  They coconut flavored pudding might help, but it wasn't available in my area, so I made this as the recipe is written.

Made a graham crust and used banana cream pudding. I also sliced 2 bananas and placed them on top of crust then poured pudding mixture over. Turned out to be coconut banana cream pie but it was all I had in the house and I love bananas anyway. Added more nutrition (: It is soooooo good. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for thanksgiving and even the non-dessert eaters loved it.  It was light and so creamy.  You would never know it was made with a pudding mix.  I used "lite" and non fat ingredients and no one even knew.  Our family's new favorite dessert.

This was so easy and good!  I used one pkg. of vanilla pudding, and one package of coconut cream pudding instead.  Turned out soooo yummy.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe will always be at the top of my list. It was on the Cool Whip lid a couple of years ago, and is incredibly easy to make, keeps well, and displays beautifully! Need a pie? Make this one the day ahead, and refrigerate.

Great and very easy to make pie.  No need to change the recipe in my opinion.
