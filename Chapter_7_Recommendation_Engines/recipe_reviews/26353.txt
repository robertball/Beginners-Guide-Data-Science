FANTASTIC! We enjoyed this recipe very much! The sauce would be great on just about anything! I had dried rosemary leaves so I used my mortar and pestal to grind them to a fine powder, and it was good that way. Before serving, I removed the fish and added 1T cornstarch (mixed with water) to the sauce to thicken it (it was too soupy) and this turned out nicely! I used a crumbled tomato and basil feta and it just made the dish! Don't leave off the feta cheese! I also added 2t minced garlic to the sauce along with the spices, and was happy with the result! We will definitely be making this one again! Thanks for the post!

This was GREAT -- so easy and healthy!!  I did add a clove of minced garlic w/ the onion.  I would recommend draining the liquid from the tomatoes and reserving it, just in case you need it. I used fresh basil from my garden and this was a hit w/ my family !!!  Thanks Christopher!

This is one great recipe!  I prepared it for my family last night using a sauvignon blanc wine. After removing the fish from the simmering liquid I ladled out a little over a cup of it and added it to one cup of couscous, let it sit for about five minutes, then fluffed it with a fork.  I served the fish over the couscous for a delicious meal! I also prepared  "Broccoli, Corn, and Green Bean Saute" from this site. Thank you for this recipe that I will fix again soon!

Very good. Next time I will try the previous reviewers suggestion and add a little garlic and used fresh herbs. I did use the juice from the tomatoes and almost had to add water because all of the liquid was evaporating (I only made 1 filet.)

Yet another review of 5 stars.  Perfect combo for Orange Roughy.  As other reviewers have said, the cheese makes this dish!  And as other reviewers said, let the liquid reduce a bit before adding the fish.

This was really good and easy to make.  I added garlic along with the green onion to the olive oil.  Also, like another reviewer suggested, allow the wine and tomato mixture to reduce by about 2/3 before adding the fish otherwise it will be very soupy.  This was very tasty and light.  I will make it again!

My husband loved it, and he usually doesn't like fish.  Serve w/o the feta to lower the fat... it stills tastes great and is super quick & easy!!

This is so great, I had to review it immediately!! I used grouper because taht's what I had and added minced garlic when I was sauteeing the green onions and used chopped tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregeno instead of the whole tomatoes. I used 3/4 cup of the tomato/wine sauce in Uncle Ben's wild rice with butter sauce and served it all with squash. This was the greatest! I actually forgot to add the feta at the end which makes me anxious to try it again with feta soon!!

I am the rare person who didn't like this recipe... I was skeptical about it to begin with because I had a feeling the flavors would overpower the fish, which is a very delicate tasting one. All of the flavors did turn out, for me, to be too strong. If you don't enjoy the flavor of orange roughy on its own, I would suggest making this and serving it on alongside some nice hot buttered angel hair or other thin pasta. Otherwise, try one of the orange/lemon juice based orange roughy recipes on the site.

**OUTSTANDING**CROWD PLEASER**
I made this & everyone loved it: husband, myself, our toddlers & a 10 yr old! This is an elegant, delicious & simple meal. This is probably the best recipe I have gotten from this website. Eating healthy & loving it-you just can't beat it. I would not change a thing about it-it's perfectly delicious. Many Thanks!

Great recipe.  I added a couple of cloves of fresh garlic with the green onions, then added the wine and tomotoes and allowed the liquid to reduce by half before adding the fish.  I only had two fillets so I added some fresh shrimp, amd boy did they come out good.  I too substituted the olives for capers and ommitted the feta - only becuase I didn't have any.  This really made a great meal.  The kids loved it too.  Can't wait to make this dish for my next dinner party.

As much as I like Orange Roughy (probably the
best meal I have ever had in a restaurant was an
Orange Roughy Florentine), we replaced the
Orange Roughy, which is a big no-no 
nowadays from an enviromental perspective 
(see "www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch"),
with imported Haddock.  My wife and I still
liked the dish quite a bit, although the
olives did not work for me.

What a wonderful fish recipe! At first not too sure about the tomatoes, but after making this recipe doing everything with the slight exception of the wine. I only had Riesling and what a taste.  
Paired this with bow tie pasta because of the tomatoes and it was a perfect mate. Go ahead give it a try. I think you'll like it.

This recipe gets points for being quick and easy. It was pretty good. I also reserved the liquid from the tomatoes so it wasn't so soupy. I would make it again for a quick, healthy dinner.

Followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted low fat feta to save some calories. The feta and olives make the dish outstanding. We even reheated some leftovers the next day (with a fresh sprinkling of olives and feta) and it was still good. The kithen smelled wonderful when it was cooking, which is not the usual for fish. Thank you for a terrific recipe!

Fabulous recipe!  I didn't have them on hand, so I skipped the green onions and olives.  And I added 4 cloves garlic, because we are such garlic fans.  Other than that, I followed the recipe directly.  This recipe turns out amazing every time!

Fabulous flavor!!!  Excellent sauce to dip some french bread into!  I followed the recipe exactly except I put in 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil along with the fresh stuff.  Served it with Warm Belgian Endive And Pine Nuts Salad. My boyfriend absolutely loved this
dinner.   It's a keeper he said!!!!

Excellent recipe -- with a lot of flavor!!  The only thing I changed was using a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil instead of the whole tomatoes.  I also served it in a bowl over jasmine rice with sour dough bread on the side. Highly recommended – thanks Christopher!

My family loves this recipe!  I've made it twice already!  I use stewed tomatoes and add garlic when I add the other spices.  I also add 1 tsp. of corn starch to thicken the sauce before serving it.  Thank you!

Wow!  My husband and I really liked this recipe.  The fish did not taste fishy.  I made two filets, but all of the sauce (except I left out the juice from the whole tomatoes can).  The sauce was thin, so it was a little soupy - and we served it in a bowl, but it was wonderful.  Next time, I will serve it with bread to soak up the sauce and a salad.

This turned out GREAT!  I give it five stars, and I was surprised at how good it is. The Feta is actually really important to the recipe to me, but that's because I love it.  It was very.. saucy, so next time I would leave out the tomato sauces and add if needed, but it still tastes great.

This is a wonderful Mediterranean recipe.  My husband prepared this last night and the only change he made was to add the olives to the simmering sauce instead of just sprinkling on the top at the end.  Next time, we are going to try it with tilapia.  Thanks, Christopher!

We is a very tasty way to prepare orange roughy. As several other reviewers did, I added a clove of minced garlic and drained the canned tomatoes. Although my husband and I enjoyed the combination of flavors a lot, my kids weren't big fans. 4 oz. crumbled feta was more than a generous amount for this recipe. I'll certainly fix it again!

Recipe was good but next time I'll use less white wine.  I made with Swai and received thumbs up all around.

Easy, healthy, and delicious! This one's a keeper. I did omit the feta cheese and sprinkled a little parmesan on top instead.

This was good; however I agree with other reviewers that the sauce/veggie mix is strong for a delicate fish.  Next time I will use another recipe for this.

SO GOOD! And easy! I have been trying to bring more fish recipes into my house but without much luck with my roommates. My boyfriend said I had finally changed his mind about fish. And my roommate, who never cared for fish either, she inhaled it. I cooked up some brown rice with 1/2 a boullion and some rosemary and it went great with the extra onion tomato sauce. It's a keeper!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe, but...didn't use the olives, instead, added lemon zest and capers.  Served over white rice.  Will definitely add to my recipe box.  Thanks so much!!!

This was SO good!  I started with some sliced 'shrooms before adding the green onions and also added garlic.  I didn't have feta or black olives but substituted Kalamata olives as a garnish and it worked great!  Served with Ratatoullie and couscous (made the couscous with the Ratatoullie liquid so everything pulled together).  Delicious!  Definitely putting this recipe in my reportoire.  I'm going to try with shrimp next.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

As far as fish goes I thought this was pretty good. No wine, so used chicken broth with 2T wine vinegar, thickened the sauce with a little arrow root. Also added zucchini. My husband loved it as well. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I've made this several times for company, and it's always a hit. My mother-in-law asked me for the recipe after she had it. The only thing I change from the recipe is omitting the olives, as we aren't big fans.

I agree 100% with the lady that did not like this recipe.  
The sauce itself is great for pasta, but for a delicate fish it is too overpowering.  You do not taste the delicate flavor of the fish, just the sauce.

I had fresh dover sole on hand, so used that in place of the orange roughy. It was WONDERFUL! I added capers, fresh tomatoes, and artichoke hearts to the tomato/wine mixture, and it was wonderful. I served the dish on top of whole wheat linguini. YUM!

I made this with cod and shrimp because that's what I had on hand.  I served with a greek chopped salad and hearty bread.  My husband and friends loved it!  I especially liked the shrimp so I will definitely do the same next time.  (I added the shrimp when the fish was about halfway cooked since my filets were thick).  I will also follow some of the others' suggestions to thicken the sauce a little more next time, but the flavor of this dish was outstanding.  Definitely a keeper!

How about It's Perfect and It's Easy Orange Roughy?  I can't believe how good this was, especially given that it took only 30 minutes.  Very good flavor and a nice new way to fix a healthy meal.  Thanks Christopher

I thought this recipe was excellent!  The only thing I would change,and this wasn't a mistake on Christopher's part, is adding a pinch of sugar to the tomatoes as the tinned variety available to me was a bit too acidic.  We added a few green olives since we like them and used fresh rosemary.  A lovely dish.  Went perfectly with the vegetable couscous from this site!  Thanks!

Such a great recipe! So easy and so yummy! I only used two large orange roughy fillets, so if I were to make four servings, I would most likely double the other ingredients. I served the meal over wild rice with a side of baby broccoli. Sooooo good!

I was under the impression that I would end up with some nice fillets with a nice sauce over it.  I actually ended up with fish soup.  Thank god I started dinner ahead of time, and had time to cook up some rice and throw into my "soup" and made a nice "gumbo" out of it.  I also added red pepper flakes, and topped with some parmesan cheese at the end.  It ended up delicious but only not what I was expecting.  If you do end up with a "soup" cook some rice only half-way done and throw it in and simmer about 10 min.  Definitely add LOTS of garlic salt.  Wait a minute, I've just come up with my own recipe! Heheh... Delicious~!  Will keep the recipe and throw it over some linguine next time.

This is an awesome recipe! It was quick and easy and very tasteful! I used frozen chopped basil and fresh tomatoes and it was a hit!
