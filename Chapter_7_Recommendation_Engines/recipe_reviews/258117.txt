Good. However, I do a short cut by baking extra "baked" potatoes and chill them overnight in the fridge. Next morning, cut into desired sized pieces, season and fry. I don't bother with peeling them at all. Much easier, quicker and cheaper than buying pre-packaged, cubed potatoes. Want to peel them? Save the clean peels, spray with cooking spray or toss with vegetable oil. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Cook in a pre-heated oven at 400 for 15 minutes - easy potato chips.

I have been making these potatoes for years BUT the hint that makes them the best is to cook them in bacon grease with real chopped onions

I made these the other night, but instead of microwaving (I don't care for the texture after microwaving taters), I steamed them in the pressure cooker for 4 minutes at high pressure with a quick release (I used the steamer basket so the potatoes wouldn't be waterlogged). Perfection!

I'm not one to "cook" in the microwave.  I made 2 batches, one precooked in the microwave, and the other precooked by boiling the peeled and quartered potatoes in lightly salted water for 10-12 minutes.  Both methods turned out fine.

I fried the microwaved potatoes first.  They ended up over seasoned and over cooked.  I should have turned the heat down about halfway through the frying.  Chalk that one up to cook error.

The second batch turned out beautifully, and are delicious.  I will make this again, but will precook by boiling, since it seemed to work just as well.

It was not bad, and I say this because when I usually make home fries I'm stirring in fresh chopped onions, green peppers, mushrooms and bacon bits or diced ham with it.  Perhaps I'm making an unfair comparison considering.  This recipe is still good but lacking, by myself the family consensus.

I have made this recipe multiple times and am always pleased. Tonight I added fresh chopped rosemary to the oil and butter as it was heating, which went well the Grilled Lemon Rosemary Chicken Breasts recipe found on Allrecipes.

My boys LOVED these home fries! It took a little longer to cook until crispy and you have to eat them as soon as you plate them though as they will not hold their crispy state long. Very tasty and will be making these again. Thank you Chef John!

I followed the instructions except after cooking, I cut up the potatoes, put in a plastic bag and put in the frig overnight.  They turned black along the edges! I cut that off each piece--very time consuming--then cooked per instructions. They were very good, crispy on the outside but soft in the middle, just like we like them. Next time I'll add more garlic powder.

Made this a few times now and it only gets easier! I cooked onions and peppers prior to the taters and incorprated at the very end after crisping the potatoes. Everything turned out as you would want it, crisp, tender, and savory. Thanks again Chef John!

Pre made in the same pan with only olive oil some finely chopped bell pepper, onion, fresh garlic and long hots in advance then added them to the finished potato's.  Worked well for my BBQ chicken I made for them.  Would do this receipt again but with my twist.

This really is a simple and delicious dish. They taste exactly like the ones you get at a diner or restaurant and because of par-cooking them in the microwave, super fast to make. Perfection!

Awesome! Made these for Mother's Day and the next weekend as well - they were a huge hit. Perfectly crispy on the outside, and like a baked potato on the inside.

A very good recipe!  Ideally prep your potatoes the night before (assuming you want them for breakfast). I came across this recipe one weekend morning when we were going through and single digit cold snap.  I prepped the potatoes as directed and placed them outside on the patio while preparing pancake batter.  In the video he suggests cold potatoes work best.  I must say the were delicious!

I've made these twice now.  The first time I used a nonstick skillet and most of the brown of the potatoes was stuck to the bottom of the pan, so much for nonstick. The second time I used a black skillet and all was good.  I baked several potatoes in the oven, then put them in the refrigerator.  Each day I want potatoes I pull one out of the refrigerator, peal it, cut it up and cook it. When I ask my wife what kind of side she wants these are it.

This recipe is awesome!  My 5 yo granddaughter  loved them as well as 3 adults.  We had them with ketchup but we all agreed after they were gone that sour cream would go well with them also.

I followed the recipe.  They turned crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 
After softening them in the microwave I put them in freezer to cool. As soon as they were cool I cut them up( skin on). And finished dish on the stove. Don't let the potatoes  cool too long that is what makes them turn .

Excellent tip to pre-cook thee taters and let them cool. It seem to really make a difference in getting a nice crispy home fried dish.
I used bacon fat instead of the butter and oil and seemed to work fine.

Made as directed. As my potatoes cooled, post microwave, they turned brown and gross looking. This was over a two hour time period left on the counter to cool to room temp pre cooking. I had to throw out some of the uglier ones, about a quarter of the potatoes and then cooked the rest. They did not get crispy either. There were crispy edges but not all over as in Chef John's video. I will not make again using this method.

These were excellent... i always wondered how restaurants made them... I tried so many times and it never worked out- but now i know exactly how to make it! As far as the spices... i used garlic salt, smoked paprika, and black pepper. Next time as others reviewers indicated I will use onions and bell peppers. Thank you for the recipe!

Loved how easy this was!!! My daughter and I like more seasonings so we added more and these were great! We even put the extra in the oven the next morning to heat them up crispy again! Yummy!

These were good, and they turned out just as the recipe said--crispy on the outside, soft inside.  But how do you stop them from turning black?!  Definitely don't like cutting all the black off before cooking.  Also, a "pinch" of onion powder and one of garlic powder wasn't enough, to my taste.  Maybe I don't know how much a "pinch really is!  Maybe I could microwave without peeling, put in frig to cool, then peel right before cooking.  This recipe definitely needs some work before it becomes an "old standby."

These were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of leaving out the cayenne since my kids don't like heat.  I've been trying to make crispy breakfast potatoes for years, and I finally found the perfect recipe!!    (Reheated the next day in a pan with a little more butter and olive oil - practically as good the second time!)

The big difference from the way I usually make, is the addition of butter to the oil. As I use a good olive oil, only a dab of butter will suffice for me

These potatoes are  wonderful. Followed recipe almost as directed, including the ketcup. What I did differently was to add chopped onions when frying. Heavenly!!

This recipe popped into my inbox just in time.  I have a full day planned and needed a decent breakfast.  Got a couple of potatoes into the microwave then cooling on the cutting board while I took a shower.  Cut up and into the fry pan with the seasonings as listed.  1 egg in the same pan and breakfast is ready with a cup of coffee.  I too, do love hash browns made with left over baked potatoes but this is a very decent alternative when those are not on hand.  Much better than frozen!

This technique worked for me-- the first time I've successfully made home fries!  I could never get the browness and crispiness right.  Perfect!
