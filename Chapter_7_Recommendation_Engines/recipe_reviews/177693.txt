This is one of the most elegant, and easy appetizers there is.  I have been making this for years.  I took a tip from someone else and before baking, put it wrapped well in foil and freezer bag and froze it.  Then when I baked it (a little longer) the cheese did not run out of the crust as it can do sometimes.  There are many different variations on the fruit/nut mixture and the preserves/jam, I've done apricot preserves, raspberry jam, used walnuts instead of almonds, hazelnuts, the list is endless.

If nothing else, timing and presentation are worth 5 stars. However, if you believe you eat first with your eyes, then this is truly a remarkably delicious crowd pleaser. My daughter's neighborhood has a wine tasting get together 4 times a year and this past weekend she was the hostess for the event.  We found this recipe and decided that on looks alone it would get a good review.  It was wonderful! I can't tell you how many copies we've made of this recipe to give to the party goers who raved over it. Deliciously gorgeous, very easy prep. Can't ask for more!

Step #3 will clarify your confusion.  This is baked in the oven for 20 minutes - then you let it stand for 1 hour before serving.  That adds up to 1 Hr. & 20 min. before it would be ready to be served.

I have been making this for years and always spoon Apricot Preserves over the top when I first take it out of the oven and sprinkle chopped roasted pecans, diced dried cheries and apricot pieces for a spectacular presentation.

I've been making this for over 10 years, and yes, it's always a hit! Because I like to have a table of several appertisers, I usually make this with the smaller triangle shaped Brie and using a 1/2 sheet of pastry. At times I havn't used the parsley, but just the sheet of dough.

So easy & so delicious! Gorgeous presentation. I sued an 8oz brie, baked 25min and cooled 20 (per puff pastry site). Turned out perfect!

WOW- this was so elegant and delicious!  I didn't have any leftover puff pastry, so I etched a design on top with a sharp knife and it still looked lovely.  Thanks for a simple recipe that was a crowd pleaser- I will hang on to this one for sure!

As stated, I did not fall in love with the recipe. I was not crazy about the parsley and almonds together with the brie. This said however, it is a tasty and easy appetizer that can be easily altered to suit different tastes ny playing with the nuts/jams/spices etc.

Very good.  I actually didn't have parsley, so used a small amount of fresh rosemary.  My finished recipe didn't look like the one in the picture - and there was no mention on how they achieved that effect.  I had watched Paula Dean make one with raseberry jam and walnuts.  So I made one of each.  I followed her technique of pulling up the corners of the dough and basically tying it at the top.  Very pretty - like a present.  Backed both for 30 minutes.  Liked the raseberry recipe better, but think the savory one has potential with a little experimentation - maybe thyme would be good.  As I said, it looked different, more like a purse that had "relaxed".  But nice and everyone enjoyed both of them.  Very easy - will make again.

Thank you for this elegant, easy & mouth-watering recipe!  I used to treat myself to this at a jazz club in college and never dreamed how easy it would be to make for myself.  When I found this recipe and made it, we were so impressed - it is just as delicious and beautiful as the club's!  I love to serve this for any gathering with fresh granny smith apples, crusty french bread and Carr's Table Water Crackers - mmmmmmmm.  Cant go wrong with CHEESE & BREAD!

It is also really good if instead of parsley you use any type of preserves.

I rated this recipe so high because it was so incredibly easy to make, even for me! I was worried it wouldn't look good when it came out of the oven, but it did - looked nice and shiny (I'm assuming from the egg wash over it). I am not crafty so I ended up just using a cookie cutter and cut a shape out of the excess dough and putting that on the top, instead of making a bow or something - the cookie cutter way worked great and was super easy! My only thing: I think once it was out of the oven, I let it sit too long (I thought it was an hour, but might have been more) so when we cut into it, it was just light a normal round of brie...not "oozing" like it said it should...and the parsley & almonds were at the top, exactly where I had put them...not all mixed in...it was good, but maybe could have used a bit more flavour, which is why I did 4 stars and not 5...It was tasty & we ate it quickly but it felt it may have been missing something, I just don't know what...However, I am making it again in 1 week for friends & I'll just do the exact same thing & not let it sit too long.

This turned out great!  It was a hit at our family gathering.  I did not alter the recipe.  I had left over puff pastry that I used to wrap little smokies.  It worked fine!

I made this recipe for a party and everyone loved it! Next time I will bake it sooner to allow proper time to cool.  Leftovers were just as fab the next day.
