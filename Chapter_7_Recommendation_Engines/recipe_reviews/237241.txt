This omelette was awesome and so delicious.  Tender, creamy, eggy and divine.  I followed Chef John's directions exactly.  My family ate it all up and begged for more.  I'll make this again and again.  Love, love, lov ed it!  French goat cheese really made it extra special.

Best omelette I've ever had! Didn't have any chives, so I used basil and parsley. Really fluffy and easy to make. Tip: for a little kick, add some Himalayan salt to the finished thing!

Excellent dish and unique technique.  Feta works well.  Easy to make and barely any cleanup.  Nicely done Chef John!

So simple and delicious! I usually make thicker omelets in a smaller pan, and this was a nice change.  I sprayed my pan with olive oil spray and added a lump of Kerrygold butter. Will definitely make again, maybe even tomorrow morning! Thanks, Chef John!

It was sooooo easy, and it turned out perfectly on my first try! I didn't have goat cheese, so i just used a slice of cheddar cheese. It was alright.. I know it would be a million times better with the goat cheese! Next time...

Delicious! Only thing I will change next time is using a tiny bit less of olive oil. Maybe I'll add in a few pieces of ham!
Thanks for the recipe! :D

Used feta cheese... couldn't get my hands on goat cheese. And added a little bit of onion powder to taste ... perfection.

It is a nice simple omelet.  I cut back amounts, and made it for one.  Tastes good, and I'll have to try it again.  The only substitute I used was butter instead of olive oil.

I have found that in French and Italian cooking, it is often as much about technique as it is ingredients.  Once again, Chef John has a great recipe and teaches novices like myself how to do it right and look like a professional.  Thanks.

I quite liked this omelet-making technique. I realized I wasn't a huge fan of goat cheese or chives (was my first time trying both) but this is a good basic recipe for any other filling.

Chef John has a staggering amount of video recipes online and all the ones I have tried have ranged from good to awesome. It's an omelette what can you say? In my world there are 2 kinds, french and country style, this is country style. This is how you make a country style. This is a basic omelette, cooked very nicely though..
