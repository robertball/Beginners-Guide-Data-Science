I didn't have any buttermilk, so I sub'd with plain yogurt.  No pumpkin seeds, either, so I used sprinkles on some and chopped pecans on others.  Texture and taste is very similar to pumpkin bread which we love.  These doughnuts have a lot of ingredients, but they were extremely moist and turned out very well.

I didn't have buttermilk so I used half n half instead. I also used a mini donut maker appliance and it worked fantastic!

These were so warm and soft! Not what I was looking for but a really great treat. Very much like a heavy cake, but so moist. Best if rolled in cinnamon/sugar. I would make these again. Used mini bundt pans.

I'm surprised with over 5000 views that there are only 7 reviews. These doughnuts are delicious!  I didn't have any doughnut pans so went out and purchased them. I'm glad I did because I will absolutely be making more of these. I found them to be moist and tender. And very easy to make. Don't let the long list of mostly spices scare you.

I made these this morning with high hopes of them being delish. They were ok. These donuts were more like pumpkin bread and not very puffy at all. Next time I make pumpkin donuts I will most likely try another recipe but use the same icing.
