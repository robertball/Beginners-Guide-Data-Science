Delish! Been making this for years. I cook my pasta the day before and marinate them with about 3/4 of the salad dressing. The next day I add the other ingredients and then the remainder of the salad dressing. Sometimes I vary the veggies and add onions, bell pepper, tomatoes, etc.

I gave this 5 starts BUT I used all the suggestions from the other reviewers -but it was AWESOME. It got rave reviews when I took it to my BBQ and DH is asking for it again. He said it is better than my old pasta salad that was so much more work! 

I used a combination of creamy italian and a zesty italian vinegarette. More creamy italian than vinagerette. I used about 3/4 bottle combined. About 7 oz of creamy and 4 oz of the vinegarette. 

I added about a cup of artichoke hearts, 1/2 a bottle of vlassic zesty pepper rings,  and a 6oz bag of sliced sun-dried tomatoes. 
I left out the broccoli and the pepperoni.

I chilled it over-night and it was even better the next day. 

This one is a keeper!

AWESOME AS IS RECIPE! I am picky about pasta salad and THIS WAS VERY GOOD! Since the original recipe, I too have played with it, added other veggies, and it ALWAYS COMES OUT GREAT!

I made a number of changes based on preference, and was very pleased with the result.  I used hard salami instead of pepperoni, and about 1/2 a bottle of Olive Garden italian dressing.  I used bowtie pasta, and added diced cucumbers, red onion, green olives, and cherry tomatoes.  I substituted shredded parmesan for the shredded mozzarella.  Very good right away, and I'm sure it will improve with some time in the fridge.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The best pasta salad I ever had.
I followed a reviewers suggestion and used Good Seasons dressing. I made a mistake with the first packet and added 1/2 cup of water instead of oil. I left it at that and added the oil then another packet following the box directions exactly.  The added water made a milder flavoring so I'm going to keep it that way for the next time I make it.
I used half a box of shells, cut up red pepper, 1/4 of a vidalia onion, broccoli, cherry tomatoes and Hormel pepperoni. For half a box of pasta the 2 packets of seasonings made the salad just right, not dry and not swimming in dressing.
For something different, I now use a box of spiral pasta and half a bag of cooked and cooled cheese ravioli.

My husband and I loved this salad after I made a few changes.  I did try it as stated also but we liked it better after the changes.  I added parmesan instead of moz. cheese and I only added about half the dressing called for.
I also added some grape tomatoes sliced in half and the second time I made it, I added salami instead of pepperoni.  It hits the spot on a hot summer evening.

I use good seasons italian dressing packets, it's the best dressing for pasta salad i've come across thus far. Cherry/Grape tomatoes and grated parmasean are a must. Artichokes are a nice addition as well.

I make this for most of the parties and picnics I go to and people always love it! I get lots of comment on how good it looks.  The combination of ingredients makes a really nice presentation.   It is VERY easy to make.  I use block mozzarella and cut it into cubes instead of the shredded cheese.

This was good, and attractive, but just nothing special about it.  I wish it would specify a brand name of Italian dressing since those who tried it and really liked it may have used a bottled dressing that was tastier than the Wishbone brand that I used.  I use that brand on green salads so that is why I bought it for this recipe.

I could eat this for lunch everyday! I used sliced zucchini chunks instead of broccoli. I would use a little less dressing next time. This is so delicious. I served it with popovers.

This recipe is a great basic pasta salad to customize to your personal preferences.  A lot of the taste will have to do with what salad dressing you use.  I used Wishbone House Italian and it was good.  I didn't have pepperoni, so I used sweet Italian sausage (next time I will use pepperoni).  I used green olives instead of black, and I used Italian blend shredded cheese.  I also added some chopped up cherry tomatoes and some banana peppers.  I made it the night before, put half the bottle of dressing on it, then tossed it with the rest of the dressing the next day.

Great recipe, I used cucumber and green pepper instead of olives. I also had parmesan cheese which worked fine. Everyone who tried it loved it!

I thought the dressing was aweful for the salad.  Maybe the brand was bad, but homemade salad dressings are so much better.

Great recipe! Only changes I made were to use frozen broccoli florets blanched in the pasta cooking water for about the last 60 seconds of cooking (I didn't have any fresh and I HATE chopping!). Also, instead of all mozzarella I did 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 shredded parmesan just out of personal preference.  Hubby couldn't get enough.  A DEFINITE keeper!! Went very well with grilled brats and was a refreshing change from the same old potato salad!!

I did 1/2 mozzarella, 1/2 shredded parmesan. I also added cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and subbed the olives with small green olives. I used Newman's Own Italian. I cooked the pasta the night before and added 1/2 the dressing to keep it from sticking. Then added the remaining ingredients and dressing about 1.5 hours prior to serving. I had at least 8 comments stating how fresh and delicious it was.

Delicious, but we had to make a major adjustment, which is only use 1/2 the bottle.  If you use the entire thing, it will be drenched.  Wishbone Italian worked well.

Very good!  Got great reviews at the cookout I brought it to.  I added cherry tomatoes and marinated artichokes but otherwise followed the recipe.  Looked great and it was the first salad to go!

I tried and tried to add flavor to this pasta but it was SO BLAND. I let all the flavors mingle for a few hours in the fridge - still NOTHING. I followed this recipe exactly the way it's written.

I brought this recipe to a bbq, and everyone loved it.  I don't know why, because it's so simple, but maybe the salami gives it an extra kick.  I used Newman's Own Italian dressing, double d teh pasta, and added red/green peppers.

This is a great recipe.  I steamed the broccoli florets to make them soft and instead of shredded mozarella cheese, I used fresh mozzarella cheese and cubed them.  I added 1/4C of chopped sundried tomatoes packed in oil and drizzled some of the oil into the salad. I used the Italian dressing mix found on this site.  The great thing about this salad is that you can easily substitute the ingredients for items you prefer.  It tastes better after mixing in the dressing and a little time in the refreigerator.  This gives time for the dressing to really sink into the ingredients.

This is a really good recipe as you can adjust your favorite veggies to put into it. I've used the Wishbone Italian Dressing and I always add lots of Salad Supreme (found in the spice section of grocery store) and it completes the taste perfectly for us!

Wow fabulous salad definitely a keeper!!! I had to use what I had on hand so I used cauliflower instead of broccoli florets and penne instead of tri-color rotini pasta I also added  cherry tomatoes and half a fresh green pepper from the garden. I used Greek salad dressing, a little Greek market by my house makes their own. Next time I think I will also add some feta too, didn’t have any on hand. Thanks so much for the yummy recipe!

I have been making this pasta salad for years and everyone loves it. I leave out the olives because my husband doesn't like them and I add cauliflower, sliced carrots and grape tomatoes. We love it with steak or chicken cooked on the grill or with some crusty rolls for  a light lunch or dinner.

This salad was a hit at a get-together we attended! Every since then my husband and I have often prepared this salad as a light meal along with breadsticks and wine.

Excellent! I love to make this for summer gatherings because I know it's always a favorite. My boys call it "that pizza salad". I make it the day before and add most of the dressing while the pasta is still warm. Refrigerate it overnight and the next day add the other ingreds. and the rest of the dressing. So delicious!

This was great!  I don't like black olives, so I substituted grape tomatoes that I cut in half, but other than that - followed the recipe and was very happy with it.  One side note, though -- the pepperoni turned a much lighter color after a day in the fridge and it didn't look very appetizing, so I will probably separate it from the rest of the recipe next time and just add it as needed.

For more of an Italian Style Pasta Salad, I used only 12 oz of rainbow pasta, 8 oz salami, 8 oz provolone cheese, 3 oz sliced black olives, 4 oz Good Seasons Italian dressing (prepared), 3/4 of a green pepper diced and skipped the broccoli florets.

This recipe was great!  I made it for a party and everyone loved it.  I substituted the mozzarella for Kraft Colby and Monteray Jack cubed cheese.  I only added a little bit of mozzeralla and parmesan cheese.  I also added chopped red peppers.

Great recipe!  This was my first time making pasta salad, and I wanted something with minimal ingredients.  We skipped the olives, and used turkey pepperoni and fat free Wishbone Italian dressing, almost 1 bottle.  Very good and I will keep making!!!

This is a very good recipe. My BF LOVES it as do I ! The only additions I make are adding some marinated artichoke hearts, Vlasic zesty pepper rings and diced monerey jack or provolone cheese instead of shredded and more black olives We make it alot in the summer and use it for lunches all week.

This recipe is a favorite of mine.  Good to take to potlucks and family gatherings.  Other than occasionally adding fresh mushrooms to it, I usually make it as it is written.  (It's very colorful too, so it's an attractive addition to the table.) Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful and simple pasta salad recipe!  My family raves about it and I always get special requests for "my" pasta salad whenever we have big summer barbecues!  Get a good salad dressing or make your own - it makes all the difference.  Also, I sometimes add a little bit of parmesean cheese to it - really enhances the flavors!

We liked this recipe.  We left out the  olives but kept everything the same.  Hubby thought it could use more crunchy veggies like onions and peppers.  I liked the mozz cheese which I had never added to pasta salad before.  The dressing I chose was sundried tomato vinagrette which had a nice zing to it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Came out great, I added some chopped green pepper, chopped onion, chopped yellow pepper did wonders. You might want to try using parmasan(sp) cheese instead of whats called for either way works well

This is a good, light tasting pasta salad, (minus pepperoni).  I only used about 1/3 of a bottle of Zesty Italian, it was plenty for us.  I make this often.

Wonderful recipe! I also followed other's advice and used the Good Seasonings Italian Dressing packet and let it marinate in 3/4 of the dressing overnight. It turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

I don't know why but this recipe just needed sprucing up!  I had to add Parmesan, carrot julliennes, parsely, muenster cheese cubed, cheddar shreds, and lots of salt to make this palatable to our famaly.  it just had no zing, tasted like bland, oily noodles... maybe the dressing was to blame?  I don't think so, though.

Loved it.  Anything pasta with some cheese and Italian dressing I love.  The pepperoni was a nice touch.  I did use turkey pepperoni, low-fat cheese & Wishbone (only flavorful one, IMHO) fat-free Italian.  And unlike others, I thought it needed *more* dressing, not less, but I left it in the fridge overnight and it had pretty well soaked up the dressing.

Made this for my son's second birthday party.  It was a hit!  I did add 2 tomatoes, 1 green pepper, 1 cucumber, and 1 red onion.  The more vegetables the better it tasted.  My 2 year old even picked at it.  I was a little hesitant on the dressing after reading everyone else's review, but I still added the whole bottle, and good thing I did, because the extra vegetables soaked it up.  Tasted even better the second day!

I changed this recipe up just a little and added chopped cucumbers (remove the seeds), chopped roma tomatoes(remove the seeds), and one chopped green pepper.  I also use deli salami and cut into strips.  I never have put olives in mine because no one here likes them.  I also use fresh mozzarella and cube it into little chunks and it adds a nice flavor with the dressing.

This is an easy pasta salad that my family loves. I prefer to use a harder cheese for this salad, or mozzarella that is cubed instead of shredded. Either way...easy to make and always gone quickly!

Found this at the last minute for a potluck picnic. Solved the "refrigerate one hour" problem by dumping ice cubes in the pasta pan after draining and rinsing pasta with cold water. Pasta chilled immediately! Left out pepperoni and broccoli and added green pepper and diced tomato. I got the salad past my 14-year-old only after promising her to make some just for us later...Everyone at the picnic loved it!

If you want to be a hit at your next cook out (with only 20 minutes of easy assembly) this recipe is for you.  I brought it to a Memorial Day party and the guests raved.  I did not have time to refrigerate this but it was still yummy.  I added carrots which is a definite must.  Thank you for this recipe.

This pasta salad was a big hit at the new years party I prepared it for. I don't do broccoli, so I left that out and reduced the amount of olives due to personal preference. I also added a little bit of grated parm and used zesty italian dressing instead of regular.

Delicious!!!  I made this recently for a bbq and it was the first thing to go - yummy!  I did take the suggestion of a few other reviewers to make this suite my family's taste.  I only added 8oz of italian dressing, added halved cherry tomatoes and cucumbers and omitted the mozerella cheese for cubed cheddar.  This is a great basic recipe that can be altered to suite your own taste!

This is great to have on hand for lunches.  I think the regular rotini is prettier because there is so much red and green in the other stuff, but to each his own.  I also use thawed frozen peas 'cause I like them better, and I use cheddar or colby-jack cheese for color and flavor.  I didn't put the whole bottle of dressing on either because it was too strong.  Really love the salad, though.

This salad was very good.  I didn't use pepperoni, but did use a variety of vegetables - olives, broccoli, tomatoes.  I don't think the amount of Italian dressing was too much, although it did sit in my fridge for a day before I served it so that might have soaked up some of the dressing.

You can't beat a simple pasta salad like this.  I could eat this everyday too.  For mine I use Turkey Pepperoni and reduced fat Golden Cesar (It's not like the regular creamy Cesar everyone's used to) by Light Done Right.  Some of the other fat free or reduced fat dressings tend to be a bit too vinagery but this one tastes really great in the pasta.  I also skip the olives and broccoli since I'm not a fan of either and use celery and red onion instead.  Also, grape or cherry tomato are good in it but they don't keep well in the salad for more than a day or so.

This Pasta Salad Was So Good. I Had Never Made A Pasta Salad Before So I Went On A Search For A Good Recipe. I Came Across This One and Thought I Would Give It A Try! Loved It. Only Change I Made Was That I Also Added Salami To Mine.

My family and I absolutely love this recipe. Very basic. Very easy. We leave out the olives because my husband is not a big fan and it's still delicious! I have made this with all generic ingredients before and it still came out delicious! This is also a very pretty pasta salad. :)

Good stuff, I followed the recipe to a "T". I found that it tastes even better the next day. My coworkers seemed to enjoy it, thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is very good to have something different for lunch if you are sick of the norm. You will also have to use all the dressing, when you first pour it in, it looks like there is to much, the next morning, it looked dry so I put the rest of the dressing in. I really enjoyed it and the flavors really do blend in well.

Wonderful pasta salad.  I used creamy italian dressing, popped in some cherry tomatoes, added a little bit of italian seasonings & garlic powder.  I loved the broccoli in it.  Would have never used pepperoni in a pasta salad, but it was so delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was the first time I've made pasta salad, and I made it for a 4th of July potluck BBQ.  I was happy with the results - it looked good and almost all of it was gone by the end.  I think next time I would change my dressing - I used Wishbone Italian (3/4 of a bottle, not the whole thing) and I just wasn't impressed with the dressing.  Next time I'll try another - perhaps a Zesty Italian.  HOwever, in spite of that, I was still pleased with the results.  I also added halved cherry tomatoes and red bell peppers to perk it up a little. The pepperoni and cheese add an antipasto-like taste, which was delicious!

My picky husband really liked this, and it was super easy. I left out the olives, replacing them with banana peppers. To make the salad healthier, I used low fat Italian dressing and turkey pepperoni. It makes a large quantity. Great for pot lucks and picnics.

This was a big hit! Everyone was asking for the recipe. Very easy to make. If the salad dries out just add more dressing. Not too hard to figure out.

The number of stars totally depends on the dressing you use.  Obvioiusly I'd go with a dressing youre familiar with and like.  I didnt do much different except add chopped red and orange bell pepper for color and some artichoke hearts (only because i LOVE them).  Oh and instead of shredded mozz cheese i used string cheese cut into small rounds.  This salad was super easy and really good.  Very refreshing.

it's pretty good!  i didn't have brocolli, rotini or italian dressing. i used the Good Seasings mix to make my own dressing, cooked up some cheese and garlic tortellini, and just put in pepperoni & jarred red peppers.  i think the homemade dressing makes this salad better because you can adjust the flavor/oil factor.

I substituted canned kidney beans in place of the pepperoni. I used thinly sliced red bell pepper and broccoli florets. The shredded cheese adds a nice touch. I used about 3/4 of a bottle of Kraft Zesty Italian.

I took this to a salad potluck at work. It was a big hit. Now I make it for us. I've made various minor changes now and then, but I always come back to the original version. For a change I like to use a Red Wine Vinaigrette!!

My favorite pasta salad. I like it best with more fresh chopped veggies (typically not including broccoli),an italian blend shredded cheese, and zesty italian dressing. The pepperoni and olives are a must in my opinion. Husband and 11 year old love it too.

I sorta kept forgetting what recipe I was using so I added some veggies that weren't called for plus some cubed cheddar cheese. It was still a hit at the dinner party I went to :) Thanks!!! (Yes, next time, I'll print it out...lol)

I have been making this for YEARS and YEARS. The only thing I do different is use chunky cheddar cheese instead. It's so much better! Also sprinkle some parmesan cheese in it, it's great!

This went over very well at my work Christmas potluck.  I cooked the pasta the night before and mixed it with half the dressing.  In the morning, I tossed everything together.  Good leftover too - didn't get soggy.

Yum yum yum!! We loved this recipe, I made slight alterations, for my own personal tastes, added some grape tomatoes, sliced in half, 1 red onion, sliced, cooked the broccoli just slightly, and cubed up fresh mozzarella.  I used Ken's Steakhouse Zesty Italian Dressing, it was just perfect!!!  We couldn't get enough of this, will definitely make it again, thanks!

This is a great salad. I followed the recipe to a T the first time I made it and everyone loves it. When ever I have to make a salad this is the one I choose cause it is the cheapest and simplest to make out of other pasta salads. It is a really good base recipe and easy to add other veggies if you would like, but its wonderful as is. I use zesty italian dressing when I make mine, because it doesn't say exactly what kind to use.

I put my own spin this recipe and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe except I used grilled red pepper, zuchini, and squash.  I used one can of sliced black olives and about a cup of sliced grape tomatoes.  Also, the dressing I used was red pepper vinaigrette with parmesan and I also added extra seasonings and more parmesan.  I like that you can change this recipe around to your liking.

We loved this recipe! I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. It was so easy to make! We had a little leftover to bring home and it made a wonderful light lunch the next day! I will make this again and I highly recommend it!

I'd actually give this 3 1/2 stars. I added orange bell pepper, artichoke hearts and cut pieces of string cheese. All of these added a lot to the salad. It was pretty good and I enjoyed it well enough, but I think I might keep looking for the perfect pasta salad.

As it is, this is kind of blah and just tasted like oily noodles. I've only made pasta salad a couple times, so I'll have to figure out what changes are needed. I used the packets of Good Seasons Italian Dressing (because it's my favorite) and used about half the amount called for. I also added grape tomatoes, canned garbanzo beans (I love them) and cubed cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, and left out the broccoli. I think I will try as others have suggested, parmesian and maybe some salt next time.

I really enjoyed this simple yet tasty pasta salad.  My 3 and 2 year old girls loved it and my husband thought it was good as well.  quick and easy it is colorful and tasty!  The only complaints I had were from my 5 and 7 year old girls and they didnt care for it but they are incredibly picky and dont care for pasta!  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was good, and my guests took seconds, but one whole bottle of dressing seemed like a lot.  Next tine I'll use 3/4 or 4/5 of the bottle.

I made this for the first time for a get together today. I removed the olives because my husband won't eat them and added halved cherub tomatoes instead. I would have preferred olives but it was great. I used Newmans Own Family Tradition Italian Dressing which I liked. I received a lot of compliments and will make it again. Oh, I also added some chopped carrots that added some nice crunch. I'll definitely be having more in a bit for a yummy snack

This is a fantastic base recipe, and is quick and easy to make. Like others, I have also tweaked it so it stands up as a main dish meal. I use broccoli, red onion, bell pepper, kalamata olives, banana peppers, cucumber, zucchini squash... sometimes a bit of cilantro and red pepper flakes. I also sub parm for the moz. The great thing about this dish is you can use the base, and then add pretty much whatever else you want. 

I also use less dressing than the recipe calls for, and don't find that it affects the overall meal. 

Thank you so much for sharing the dish - I make it at least once a month and we have easy, fast lunches for the week.

I loosely used this recipe as a guide.  I omitted the olives, as the hubby doesn't like them.  I used Parmesan Cheese, and also added cucumber and cherry tomatoes.  I used a package of powdered Italian dressing and almost a full bottle of Parmesan Italian dressing.  Everyone loved it.

I would eat this everyday.  Maybe to cut out some of the fat, get fat free italian dressing, or some low fat pepperoni and low fat cheese.

I Loved this recipe.  It seemed a little oily the first day but the dressing soaked up and made it a perfect amount! Thanks for sharing your recipe. the only addition I did was add some very small diced carrots to give it a little crunch.

Very simple & tasty. Used chunks of cheese instead of shredded & added less salad dressing.

I made this for 25 people at our Christmas gathering. It got rave reviews. I took the suggestion and marinated the pasta in the dressing overnight. I also added artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes. The dressing I used was Marzetti's new Sweet Italian. It was perfect for this salad. I made it again today, but, only had some basalmic vinaigrette on hand. It is still great, but, I liked the Marzetti's dressing better.

Loved this salad. Added a few extra veggies just because I had them on hand. Everyone enjoyed it.

This has been a favorite with a couple of functions I've attended.  I did, however replace the pepperoni with Cabanossi.  The tri-color rotini, however, had to be replaced with tri-color spiral pasta as I could not find the rotini anywhere in at my location, which is Brisbane, QLD, Australia.  I added more broccili florets and also made my own Italian dressing.

It was delish!  I threw the broccoli into the pasta when I drained it to soften it a little and used Olive Garden dressing with feta cheese.

I've been making this salad for year's. I never use a bottled dressing, always make my own. Really simple! Olive oil, red wine vinegar with garlic & whatever blend of Italian seasoning you like! Enjoy... :)

I used Good Seasons Italian dressing (2 packets).  I used salami instead of pepperoni and added cherry tomatoes.  I also used 2 cups of broccoli florets which I blanched before adding.  I would make this again.

Thanks for this recipe!  I've never made a pasta salad before, and decided I'd try, and yours is the recipe I printed.  The 'journey' if-you-will, made me realize that if you have a basic idea, you can really customize this recipe to make it your own.  And that is exactly what I did.

First, I cooked the pasta, then added 3 or 4 ounces of Ken's Steakhouse Northern Italian with Basil and Romano dressing.  I tasted, and it didn't taste quite right to me, so I mixed in a few ounces of Olive Garden Italian dressing.  Again, there wasn't a lot of flavor, so I ended up taking a dry packet of Good Seasonings Italian dressing spices, and sprinkling it on the pasta.  That added the zesty flavor the dish needed.

As for additions, I used a large slice of red onion (diced), sliced black olives, a red bell pepper (diced), and some hard salami, (cut into about the same size and thickness as the bell pepper pieces I added).  I also used grated parmesan cheese, to add more flavor than the mozzarella.

I refrigerated the salad, and let it sit overnight.  Prior to serving, I added about 1/2  cup more Olive Garden dressing, and gave it a stir.  It turned out AMAZING!  Even my husband, who would never be caught dead eating a pasta salad, was impressed with the dish.

Thank you to everyone who contributed comments to this site; it helped me to produce a wonderful salad.

I made this recipe and it was fantastic.  The cheese and pepperoni did not get soggy.  It was as good the next day,or maybe, better.  I made one change in the recipe.  I do not care for black olives, so I substituted a can of well drained and chilled black beans.

This is amazing, but instead of using broccoli I use green pepper and tomato.

not bad. I thought it could use a little something more, maybe some red pepper flakes.

I love pasta salad, and this one is very good.  The chunks of pepperoni are an excellent addition.  I do prefer a homemade salad dressing, but this is good and faster than preparing it yourself.

A very delicious salad! I added fresh avocado diced into little pieces and used Kraft Italian Dressing. Thanks!
