Because my banana was frozen, I did not add the ice cubes. I didn't have greek yogurt on hand but I did have light vanilla bean yogurt, so I used that in it's place. I threw in a couple tablespoons of ground flax seed at the last minute. Quite good! I was able to clear some of last year's cherries out of my deep freeze and have a healthy smoothie to start out my day. I really liked the combination of the cherries, banana and lemon together, with the faint hint of almond.

Substituted vanilla for almond extract and omitted ice cubes as frozen cherries as it was already thick because of the cherries. yum!

I enjoyed this recipe.  My proportions weren't exactly the same as she shared.  I used a lot more frozen sweet cherries so I added milk to thin it enough to blend (I made 8 servings), omitted the ice, and used vanilla instead of almond extract.  The recipe, though, is a good one.  I really enjoyed the flavor of just cherries and bananas.  My kids loved it, too.

I rarely find smoothie recipes that use cherries so I had to try this one. I used frozen cherries so I didn't use any ice. And I didn't have any yogurt so I added a scoop of vanilla protein powder and soy milk. It still came out pretty tasty.

This was way too thick and bland. I could barely taste the fruit because of the ice.

Silly me, I didn't check to make sure that we had enough ice to make this, so of course, there were only three ice cubes left in the tray.  I decided to add a half cup of milk to make up for the missing liquid.  It may have been a weird substitution but hey, it worked and I may just make it that way on purpose from now on!  I also used vanilla instead of almond extract.

I really enjoyed this smoothie.  However, I did make modifications based mostly on reviewer comments.  Since my cherries and banana were frozen, I did not use any ice.  I used 6 oz. of Dannon Light & Fit Vanilla yogurt.  I used a splash of bottled lemon juice in lieu of fresh.  Result was a really creamy tasty smoothie and no flavor overpowered the other.  I could taste cherry, banana and almond in every drink.  No yogurt aftertaste AND no seeds from berries!  YAY!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jenjennjennifer!!

Was looking for a cool treat and came across this recipe.   Like others, I used frozen fruit, no ice cubes.  Also substituted unsweetened vanilla almond milk for the yogurt.   YUM!   My four-year-old son, throwing a tantrum because he couldn't have a popsicle or ice cream finally took a sip.   He said "It does taste like a popsicle.  Mommy made a popsicle smoothie!"   Thanks for a great new favorite treat!

I used homemade plain yogurt and vanilla extract, other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

This is one of the best smoothies I have ever had! My only change was that I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain because that was all I had. I will for sure make this smoothie again and I'd recommend it to anyone who has tastebuds.

While I didn't follow this recipe exactly, the basic idea was delicious! My cherries weren't frozen, I used milk instead of Greek yogurt, and I added protein powder to give me a boost. Despite the modifications, all in all this is quite tasty! I'll definitely make this again!

I thought this was okay. I used almond milk and added protein powder as well. Was very easy to make, just not sure I will make again.

I’m not wild about this recipe, I don’t know maybe it’s the lemon or how thick it is? I made it to exact directions. With a little tweaking this could be perfect. In my personal opinion I would replace the yogurt with soy milk so it was more of a drink and not so thick. I do like how incorporates cherries.

Delicious! All of the fruit I had was frozen, I also threw in about a cup of frozen kale, so it came out super thick. I also used a strawberry-rhubarb yogurt because it was all I had - but it complimented it perfectly. I would definitely make again, next time with fresh stuff instead of all frozen.

like many, I had frozen fruit so used that rather than ice, and substituted unsweetened almond milk for yogurt. Otherwise, per recipe. Very good, would make it again for sure.

I thought this was delicious.  I added fewer ice cubes and used vanilla yogurt.  The yogurt was a 6 oz container so after adding and blending the 1/2 c of yogurt decided to stir in the remainder of the yogurt from the container.

Delicious smoothie. I just love the hint of almond flavor in it.
I had to add little bit of milk, as the mix was quite thick. Also, about 1 tablespoon of sugar.
This smoothie will be made again and again..

I made this today, exactly as directed. I found it to be good, but not as "smooth" as others I've made. It was a bit like an icy slush. I always keep my fruits hard frozen, but still added the ice mentioned in the recipe because it didn't really make very much, so that could be the reason for the "slush" effect. Also, the flavor was overridden with banana tones as opposed to cherries. Next time I will increase the cherries, and reduce to 1/2 banana to see if that improves the flavor to the cherry side of things. But, altogether, who can ever say a smoothie isn't delicious?

I just made this with 3/4oz of lemon juice instead of a lemon, no ice, and strawberry yogurt instead of greek. It was still very tasty, if a little sweet. I froze the cherries and bananas for 30mins before blending. I would suggest a little less lemon juice, maybe 1/2oz, but it's still better than juicing a lemon!

Followed recipe except I used half yogurt suggested, half unsweetened almond milk, frozen fruit & substituted vanilla. Had to add a bit more almond milk because it was so thick. Big hit with kids and adults! Very refreshing on a hot summer day. Will definitely make again. Yum!!!

I used cherry juice that I drained from a bag of frozen cherries that I had used for a pie, and my smoothie came out a bit thinner but it had a wonderful cherry flavor. I've never come across a recipe for a cherry smoothie before so was anxious to try this one.

I cut this down to one serving, and used no fat greek yogurt instead of low fat. Other than that, I tried to make it as is. However, my blender wouldn't blend the mixture at all, so I added some coconut water. It was pretty good, not the best smoothie I have had, and still plenty thick even with the coconut water added. (I think it was about 1/4 cup. Thanks!
