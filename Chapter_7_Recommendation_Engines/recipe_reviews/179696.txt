My daughter requested a creamy chicken pasta dish for her birthday party and I picked this for something different. I doubled the ingredients (for more people) and I tripled the milk and cheese for volume and added spices for flavor (based on other reviewers comments). The cream cheese and red pepper created a creamy delicious flavor. It was a big hit and we'll be having this again.

I wish there was more sauce, maybe add more milk next time. It also could have used a bit more flavor to it. But I will make it again, my family loved it.

Righty. rather nice and really quick, very good when you dont have much time but you want flavour. But adaptions are needed, hence three stars. I doubled the milk, added garlic and some sliced mushrooms. When you add everything, dont cook for 5 minutes make it 10 so it thickens. Thank you, yummy!

Took this to a church board meeting and it was a hit! One member is allergic to peppers, so I used some shredded carrot for color. Also used canned evaporated milk to enhance creaminess. Spiced it up a little w/ granulated garlic and a bit more rosemary and a few more olives than called for. Used a mix of boneless breats and thigh meat to save cost and add moisture. Very tasty. Held up well on the buffett!

Well, I did over cook it but it didn't seem very creamy and actually kinda flavorless.  I try to stick to recipes but if I were to make this one again I would add some spices for flavor.

Definately a keeper! Made a few mods...salt and peppered the chix; sauteed sliced mushrooms in margarine before adding peppers; used capers instead of olives (no olives on hand); used only 1/4 red pepper (family doesn't like peppers); finally, used walnut and pesto raviolis instead of pasta. Could even add broccoli if you like.

Solid base recipe. I almost doubled the sauce, used 1 roasted red pepper (chopped) and added about 1 1/2 cups peas. Didn't use olives. Used spaghetti. Pretty tasty! The peppers gave it a nice rosy color.

Like the others, i added more milk and cream cheese (about a cup of milk and package and a half of cream cheese) I also added mushrooms and peas which gave it an awesome flavor and color. I also cooked the chicken in rosemary and garlic. house smelled awesome!

Big  points for fast and easy.  Needs a bit of flavor enchancing.  But overall very good with on hand ingredients.

This was a good dish and my husband liked it, however I'm not sure I'll put the green olives in again next time.  They were a bit overpowering I thought.  I left out the red pepper b/c I didn't have any and added fresh sliced baby portabellas.  I think almost any vegetable would be good added to this dish if you're like me and like veggies in your pastas.  I also left out the rosemary simply b/c I forgot to add it.  Maybe that's why it seemed a little bland and the olives didn't seem like a good fit.  I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing before cooking too; personal preference.

It was good and fairly easy and fast.  I would probably add some either onion or garlic because I thought it could use more seasoning.  It will definitely be a keeper for a good weeknight meal for us.

Great easy and quick recipe. I used the recipe as stated except I could only get regular Philadelphia instead of light (which probably made it a little more creamy!) and added ground black pepper. Will definitely make again!
