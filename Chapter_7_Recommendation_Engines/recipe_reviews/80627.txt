I liked this recipe. However, be sure to strain the raspberry sauce through a strainer to remove the seeds that give an annoying crunch and bitter taste. I add 1 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.

I doubled this recipe but otherwise made to the exact specifications. My sauce tasted good when I tasted it but refused to thicken very much and I ended up drizzling it over my roast. It ran off the meat and so there wasn't enough to taste properly over the hogget I used. I also had more than a litre of sauce left and as raspberries are expensive I was disappointed. I would not make this recipe again because it is too expensive for the end result but I have frozen the excess sauce and will use it on another roast and see if I can get it to a better consistency. The taste was worth 4 stars but the consistency only two, I'm sure the sauce should have gone thicker than it did but it just didn't.

This was a nice refreshing dish.  I really enjoyed it.  My husband, however, asked where the pound cake was.  He felt it was a bit too sweet for a main course.  On the subject of presentation, this would be great for Valentine's Day with it's colorful raspberry sauce.

I was lucky enough to be given a heap of raspberries from my parent's farm. This recipe was a perfect way to make use of them. The tang of the berries is a perfect match for lamb, which is a favourite of mine.

I agree, this is a restaurant quality dish. If only my cooking tasted this good all the time.

Lovely with a glass of red wine.

This was excellent. I used fresh raspberries and rosemary and also added a little corn starch to thicken. We used the left over sauce to marinate and serve with lamb steaks which was also very good.

This was very good. I had 2 "lamb lovers" over for dinner this evening and they both loved it. I did mine on the grill wrapped in foil (too hot to start the oven). Marinated all day at room temp (started with frozen leg). I had made some black raspberry wine last year and tossed some of that into the marinade. Very nice. I also thickened the raspberry stuff with cornstarch at the end. By the way my leg had a bone in and I roasted it for 2 1/2 hours. I think it weighed about 5 pounds.

The lamb was great. The sauce was weird and not good at all. I triple-checked the recipe to see if there was anything I could have missed but no... It was just bad.
