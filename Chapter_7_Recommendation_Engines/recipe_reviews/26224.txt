The butter to flour ratio listed in this recipe is NOT CORRECT.  When made as directed, you get batter only a little thicker than you would for a cake.  I went ahead and attempted to bake a sheet of these and ended up with one big sticky mess - no cookies at all!  Alternatively, if the flour is doubled to 1 and 1/2 cups and you add 1 tsp baking soda, they turn out wonderful!  I spooned this batter into a  bowl of sugar to coat them and then put them on an UNGREASED cookie sheet and baked them for 12 minutes at 350.  They were great!

I did not read reviews before attempting this recipe and it was a big mess!  I ended up making a cake out of it.
