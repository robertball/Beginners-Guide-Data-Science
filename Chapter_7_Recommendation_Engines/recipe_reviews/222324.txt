This was very tasty! I served it over grilled jerk chicken with white rice and corn on the cob. The only change I made was I used cilantro instead of the mint. This was refreshing with just the right amount of "kick" for me. Would be great over fish or shrimp too.

I didn't have any pineapple or jalapenos on hand so left them out and this was still great.  Will definitely try this again adding them next time.   I paired this with some spicy baked fish and it was perfect.  Had a wonderful cooling and refreshing effect. 3 out of 4 people eating loved it.

I've made this four times, it's easy and delicious. I also used cilantro instead of mint. Once in an emergency I used frozen fruit and it was very good. Served it over grilled salmon with rice pilaf. Was good on th rice too.

This is very nice!!! I put it in a wrap with tuna and it was very light tasting.  I did leave out the Jalapeno pepper as I don't care for it, but other than that it was perfect as is.
