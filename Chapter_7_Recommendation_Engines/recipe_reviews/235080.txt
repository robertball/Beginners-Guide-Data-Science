I used arborio rice and substituted parmesan cheese for the cheddar. After it came out of the oven I drizzled truffle oil over it. Delicious!

This was good, and I liked all of the colors. I think it's missing something, though; I will try it again, but I'll add some seasonings to see if I can get more of the taste that I'm looking for. Thanks!

I added butter to this and even so, it was bland.  Looked like a great idea, but just not tasty.

This was ok, nothing special.  No different than rice and veggies as separate sides.  Maybe it needs more cheese, or a cheese sauce?

Will def make this again! It will be excellent for a dinner party with Baked Parmesan Chicken, which is what I served it with tonight. I baked it at 375* for 25 min.  However, next time I shall stir in the thawed/cooked peas when I add the cheese; we don't care for canned or well-cooked green peas. Just a personal preference. Also, since I used unsalted chicken stock, I neglected to add some seasoned salt to compensate.
