Pretty good. I like to rely on natural sweetening and favor dates for their intense sweetness. For this reason, I only used half the sugar (turbinado). Didn't realize I only had 1/3c white flour left, so the rest was whole wheat flour. Also, I used the zest of 1 lemon and didn't measure. If I had used more sugar, I know my cookies would have been chewier. The combo of lemon and nutmeg was a nice change from  my usual diet.

I was wondering if I should've added another egg, or maybe the amount of milk was off.  I also used half the amount of sugar, and found it sweet enough.
