It was so easy to make - and even easier to eat!  The light fluffy filling of marshmellows, chocolate, and cool whip melt in your mouth!  If you are a chocolate lover, you can't let this recipe pass you by!  It's a woman's dream! (the guys love it too!)

This dessert sort of got overlooked and forgotten at the Thanksgiving table so at the eve's end it went home with relatives' to their freezers (leftovers). I received 2 separate phone calls today (neice and dad) and both RAVED over this dessert. Granted my 80 yr old dad is prejudiced where his daughter is concerned, but he sure sounded sincere when he said "that's the best chocolate pie I've ever tasted!" I'll be making this one again.

Easy and delicious.  I made mine with an Oreo crust.  Don't let the marshmallow mixture cool to long.  It made it very hard to stir in the Cool Whip

This pie is very quick and easy to make and is a big hit!  My husband likes it slightly thawed best, but I like it frozen.  It's great either way!!  The best thing is that it really costs very little to make!

This recipe is really, really good. I've made it many times now and everyone loves it and requests it again. It's also really easy to make, just be sure to make it at least 1 day before you want to serve it.  I've tried making it the same day and it wasn't firm enough to serve - it was still tasty, but very goopy.

My friend and I made this and took it to school. She gave it to one of her classes and had to fight them off so she could save a piece for me!  It is light, fluffy, and delicious!

Very good, I have made two of these in the past week and the whole family loves it. I like it since I have problems with milk and this has very little milk in it so it doesn't bother me. Great chocolate flavor! I have made it with both chocolate and shortbread crusts and it is great both ways, definitely a keeper!

This was good, especially for how easy it was.  We are serious chocolate lovers, so used an Oreo pie crust and good quality dark chocolate for the bottom layer.  Used fat-free cool whip to lighten it slightly and it turned out fine.  I was worried it would get too hard when frozen, but it doesn't -- just firmly creamy, not hard. Very good!

This recipe was very easy to do.  I made it for Christmas dessert and it was a huge hit.  I got a little creative with it and used chocolate whipped topping and then added french vanilla topping for the top layer.  Very rich, but delicious!
