Just a little heavy in the peanut flavor for our tastes, but that well could be just personal preference.  This also was delicious as a dressing for a cold Asian noodle salad.  Made exactly as written, and the consistency was perfect!

I hated this!  I was able to salvage it by adding more peanut butter, coconut milk, brown sugar and ginger.  This might have been ok with about half of the soy sauce and sesame oil.  It tasted very fishy and nothing like what you get at a restaurant.  I would try a different recipe or make the changes I suggested.

I agree that it was too much peanut for my taste, but it was still good. My husband LOVED it, and our guests also raved about it.
