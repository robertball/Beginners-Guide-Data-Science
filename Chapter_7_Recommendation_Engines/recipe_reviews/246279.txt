Very easy recipe!  Made it for a teen's birthday party, along with a semi-sweet chocolate fondue.  Used my Little Dippers CrockPot, stirring every 15 minutes for a little over an hour while I was doing party prep. Once the white chocolate was melted, I whisked everything together for a wonderfully creamy result. The crockpot kept the fondue at a perfect temperature for the party, so I just wound the cord up with a twist tie and put the crockpot right on the table to serve.  Will be keeping this one!

I made this exactly as directed and it came out runny. It was a translucent yellowish colour, and so diluted by the corn syrup that I had to put another half bag of chocolate in. Next time I'll leave out the corn syrup completely.
