This recipe is great! The recipe calls for the hash browns to me THAWED and the eggs and cottage cheese to be combined in a blender. From some reviews, I think folks don’t read the instructions well. If the potatoes aren’t cooked or the egg and cottage cheese aren’t smooth then you need to make this again. Just sayin’

I also found that the frozen hash browns weren’t cook. I even covered it with foil for the entire cooking time then removed the foil and cooked additional 15 minutes and the hash browns were not cooked.  
I make breakfast casseroles for my teenage daughter and freeze individual servings and I found that when I reheated it in my fry oven they were perfect and she liked them. I would make it again but thaw the hash browns first to see if that makes a difference.

I didn’t have any hashbrowns so I baked some potatoes and used them! 
Very good dinner!

I use fresh grated Yukon Gold potatoes instead of prepared hashbrowns.  Great recipe!

This was good but needs a bit of a kick in flavor. I used a jalapeno instead of bell pepper but I think it could benefit from some garlic. I will definitely add more bacon next time. Thank you for the recipe.

I used this as a base recipe. Left out the bacon in deference to son's vegetarian girlfriend, so I added garlic powder for flavor. One thing--you really need to blend the eggs and cottage cheese, or you won't get the right texture.  There are lots of ways to play with this--add spinach, other spices, etc.  I used frozen hash browns and it took an extra 15 minutes to cook, but everybody loved it!
