Deliciously old-fashioned! You've got to love raisins to appreciate this pie, but this is certainly a wonderful one.

Great recipe, very easy and delicious.  I really enjoyed it and this is a hit with the whole family.  I have been looking for a sour cream raisin pie recipe for my father for years and this is as close as the one granny used to make. Thank you.

This was very yummy and we all ate our portions quickly and happily. I did add extra cinnamon, which was probably unnecessary, but I have a major weakness for cinnamon and I always add extra to recipes that call for it.

I really enjoyed this custard pie.  I used whole eggs, and it made the pie change a little darker in color, but the flavor was really excellent.  I also tried it a second time, but used fresh pitted halved bing cherries (since they were in season).  Yummy.  I see using this dessert a few times a year... it really works for any season.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day.  It was exactly the Sour Cream Raisin Pie he remembered from his past.  We both loved it and will make it again.  It was very easy to make.

I have made 2 and the family is asking for a 3rd. The 2nd one I soaked the rasins in 1/2 c. brandy the night before and drained excess off before adding to the custard.  That was how my Dad did it. That was even better. This is really a good recipe.  Thanks. 5 stars here.

Thanks Mary48. Must be something about Dad's and this pie. My Dad is 88 and loves this. Thanks so much and I wouldn't change a thing about it.
