I followed the recipe as directed with the exception of the meat. I used a mild Italian sausage in place of the giblets. I found the delicious and will make them again.

I will be making these again! I had to make substitutions but this recipe is so versatile you could really just go through your pantry and throw something together. I used jasmine rice and morning star veggie meat. I also added onion and garlic because I always use those. This recipe is also very budget friendly.

I did a couple of small tweaks and used corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs and used creamy vodka sauce in place of marinara. Still awesome.

These were delicious! Making these croquettes is also the only way to get my picky boyfriend to eat rice.

These were tasty.  We are a mostly vegetarian family so, we skipped the giblets but added some flavored tvp crumbles and a small piece of fresh mozzarella to the center of the rice balls.  A good way to use up whatever you have at hand in the pantry. Oh, I used panko breadcrumbs, because that's what I had on hand.

Agreed that you could make it however you want. I used chopped chicken and risotto, seasoned it up a little more and my book club was impressed. Thanks, it was worth the time!
