I make this one all the time. With one change I do not add the cinnamon.  I have found that I do not particularly likes spies in pie crust(as in graham cracker crust).

A good easy crumb crust.  Make sure you make the crumbs fine enough.  :&)

This crust is SO good! I used it for key lime pie and I will NEVER use graham cracker crust again! However, I do think there's a bit too much butter in this recipe... it made the crust a little greasy and when it cooled it was kind of hard like candy. I will DEFINITELY make this again but I'm going to try it with less butter to see what happens.

This is a tasty and easy crust. I used it for banana cream pie and it was wonderful. I added some chopped macadamia nuts (I got this from a favorite restaurants banana pie) and omited the cinnamon. It was wonderfully crispy and the nuts added a crunch. Yummy!

This worked out well and was easy to make. The cinnamon was not good because I used it with chocolate pie filling. Also mine turned out a little wet after the filling sat in the pie shell for 2 days. Not sure if that was normal or if it was just the filling I used.

A nice change from graham cracker crust.  It held together nicely for my French Silk pie.  My daughter had a blast crushing the cookies (enclosed in a heavy duty zip lock bag) with a rolling pin.  Thanks for sharing, Nona.

Love this crust.I have never been a big fan of graham crackers so this crust is the perfect alternative.  Made this with key lime pie VII for a simple, delicious desert. Thanks for the recipe

I cut back on the butter because others said it was greasy, but other than that, I followed the recipe. I wanted an easy crust for my kids to use with an almond pear tart. Well, it WAS easy, but the taste really took over the whole tart. I thought the crust was too sweet and too hard, and the cinnamon was quite strong. I don't think I'll use this again.

This was a great recipe for using up leftover vanilla wafers.  I used it to make oatmeal pie IV (from this website) and everything turned out well!

Very good! Much better than the store bought! My husband has a favorite non-baked cheese cake that is his Mother's recipe, and he said this made mine even better than hers! Gotta love that! Thanks Nona

Taste was okay with following the recipe exact; however, it was greasy and yet somehow rock hard at the same time. Nearly couldn’t get extremely sharp knife through it. Will not be making this recipe again.

I bought a pkg of tea biscuits in error.  I do not like them in the least so I googled crusts using tea biscuits and found this one.  Other than using tea biscuits, I followed the recipe exactly.  Not greasy at all - delicious, crispy, crunchy - all that you want a pie crust to be. The cinnamon is NOT overwhelming, in fact it's very subtle. Filled the crust with a white chocolate, cream cheese filling - mmm mm good.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll be buying more of these biscuits just for this purpose.
BTW, I had 4 cups of crumbs so I multiplied the recipe by slightly more than 2 and got 2 x 9" shells and two 4" shells so the mixture is fairly generous. Picture posted. Update: My pie sat 24 hours in the fridge - the crust was still very good today - not as crispy crunchy as when it was first made but still perfectly good enough to serve company.

Very tasty, particularly for some cheesecakes which you just don't want to be overwhelmed by graham crackers.  Just note that cinnamon should only be added to certain crusts, depending on what you are putting in it.  Shortbread cookies work well too!
