THIS IS THE RECIPE I'VE USED FOR 30 YEARS. DON'T CHANGE A THING. IT IS DELICIOUS & GETS RAVES WHENEVER I TAKE IT SOMEWHERE. AND IT'S NOT DIFFICULT, ALTHOUGH EVERYONE THINKS IT IS!!

What a creamy delicious, not too sweet hit!  I always use LITE cream cheese and sour cream.  I also cut the recipe in half, since there's just two of us.  And I made a delicious cinnamon graham cracker crust that I found on this website (just added cinnamon to it)!  Oh, this was so yummy.  My husband is still drooling.  I baked it on 300 for 1 hour. I didn't even care that it cracked a little right in the middle, so that's where I sliced it!

My husband loves this cake! I've made it several times. I omit the flour and add another T. cornstarch to make it gluten free for my daughter who has celiacs.

I have been making this and the lemon taste does not shine through.  It is wonderful as written.  Although I use 1/2 cup melted butter and cooled, as posted on this site under Italian cream cheese and ricotta cheesecake submitted by April.

High altitude trials: I live at 5600+ ft. You MUST increase the flour & corn starch or it's too watery. I tried 4 Tbl each, and it was still too creamy in the center. Suggest a total of 9.5 Tbl total of equal parts flour and corn starch. Have used almost an identical recipe at near sea level, and it got rave reviews. All cakes must use more flour, or adjust eggs, flour, and decrease liquids, at high altitudes. Also, have used 2 tsp of grated lemon peel for additional zest with great success. Delicious cake, and can't wait to figure out what works for me, then 5 stars!

Used 1/2 cup of butter and 3 Tsp of vanilla.  GREAT RECIPE.  This is what real New York cheesecake should taste like.

Made this yesterday and what a treat! Didn't change a thing, which is unusual for me but the right decision, as this recipe is perfect. My husband and I kept commenting on the flavors rising to the top.... Ricotta! Sour cream! Cheese! Lemon! Love this recipe and have a feeling "traditional" cheesecake has lost it's place in my baking repertoire.

Here's why it may be gritty for some: the ricotta cheese should not be allowed to come to room temperature the way cream cheese does. When ricotta is mixed into a recipe warm (and over mixed) it does become grainy. Hope this helps.

This cheesecake is wonderful!  I've been making another recipe from this site, but decided to try a more "authentic" one.  I'm glad I found this one!  I'm not sure why others had a problem with the texture or it being too runny.  Mine came out smooth as silk and set up perfectly.  I turned the oven off after one hour and let it sit for the additional two and when I went to remove it from the oven it was still quite hot.  I baked mine in a 10" springform pan and it barely fit.  The only thing I did differently was use 16 oz of non-fat greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.  I put a triple berry reduction on top with fresh strawberries and dollops of fresh whipped cream.  It wasn't overly sweet and the berries were a nice addition.

This has been my recipe for years, too (like another reviewer).  I use the lemon juice plus 1/4 -1/2 tsp lemon extract.  You can make this with a graham cracker crust: 1 "sleeve" of graham crackers, crushed finely, and mixed with 1/2 stick of butter, melted.  Press the mixture into the bottom and partway up the sides of a greased pan before putting the batter in and baking.  Or you can make a nut crust: finely chop enough pecans (or walnuts) to cover the bottom of the greased pan.  You can mix in a little melted butter if you like but you don't have to.  Press the nuts into the bottom (you can't really go up the sides much with nuts) before adding the batter and baking.

The flavor was unbelievably good, but mine did not set up firmly and was more of a cheesecake "pudding".   However, I did use one block of regular cream cheese and one block of low-fat cream cheese, so maybe that was the problem...?  I will definitely try this again, perhaps letting it bake an extra 20 minutes or so.

This is just what I've been looking for! This is what I've always been told NY Style Cheescake should be. I've eaten it in restaurants many times and it's wonderful. I dislike any kind of cookie crust, and from what I'm told, it doesn't belong on a true NY Style Cheescake! Thanks for this recipe!

I love this cheese cake and have been making it for years!! But every year it cracks in the middle and the cracks spread like a peice of broken glass. I try to tweek the original recipe to see if it gets rid of cracking. Nothing has worked yet!

This is by far the most delicate, and delicious cheese cake. As an added touch I add orange zest. My friends give it high reviews.

Update from my first review: The next day we tried it and it was not as custard like. We do miss the crust and it is not at sweet as other cheesecakes. I am sure you have to like the type of cheesecake to appreciate it.

I’m usually a NY Jewish style cheesecake guy but this was more like the ones I remember from my Italians friends.  So light.  The citrus was perfect and there is no need for a crust.  I’m going to do the next one with orange liquor And orange rind.  My Texan wife loved it.   I’ll definitely make this again.   Thanks for gifting us with your family recipe.  She’ll be smiling  Heaven knowing so many are enjoying her cheesecake.

My husband LOVES when I bake/cook/grill and totally looks forward to the recipes I select from here. I made homemade Ricotta cheese and ended up with about 2 lbs. It was the yummiest Ricotta I have ever tasted. I followed this recipe exactly as written and my husband had an expression on his face after the first bite...that "Sorry babe...this doesn't taste good...it's too grainy!" I made a beautiful, fresh strawberry topping and even that wouldn't help. Sorry, this just didn't work for us...don't know how to make it again without the same results.

Breath taking good not your thick heavy cheesecake  that is so common and so good. This one is a change from the ordinary light and soft. Made per recipe omitted lemon and added two Tbsp Amaretto. Will be made many more times.

Great cheesecake! I halved the recipe; it filled three mini springform pans and two mini pie pans. Because the pans were smaller, I cut back the cooking time by 10 min and took them out of the oven just shy of two hours. If I halved the recipe again, I would try cutting back on the cooking time by 15 min and see how that works out. To me, this is PERFECT with NO crust or the additional calories and sugar that goes along with it.

I made this cheesecake for a potluck. I made a graham cracker crust. It was outstanding. Fresh fruits in Itslian flag in mind.  Loved it. Followed directions. Easy and yummy

This recipe we made for my niece's 15th birthday.  Although I'm not an excellent baker, it was a group effort of my Mom, sister, niece and myself.  The cake was awesome!!  Nice and dense.  It got a little well done, because my sister's oven's temp was off.  Even though it came out very well done (the crust was very hard to cut and the cheesecake itself came out very dark in color), it was still way more creamy and delicious than any of us expected.  We were all surprised by how delicious it was.  We served it with sliced strawberries.  This is definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly as written.   To me, this cheesecake didn't have a lot of flavor and had a grainy texture.   I think that possibly it would have been better if served warm, but the lack of flavor still was there.   If I was to make it again, I would definitely have to add in more lemon and vanilla.   Thank you for the experience.

Great recipe. Mine was a little loose in the middle. I cooked it for the time suggested and added 30 minutes but lowered the oven to 300.  Refrigerated over nite but still a little runny. Next time I will up the cornstarch and flour. All in all the best.  Husband and kids raved over it.

Perfect cheesecake.  I didn't have sour cream so I used Greek yogurt, which was very good.  The lemon makes it.

If you don't like a sweet cheese cake this is the one for you.I made the ricotta cheese and made it as low salt as I could and it is good.  Not to sweet with a tart from the sour cream.

This cake tasted great, but when I made it, I had patches of unincorporated sour cream. Maybe I was too gentle with the folding it in. I will try it again.

My husband told me that cheesecake is his favorite dessert, so I tried this recipe (my first cheesecake ever!).  He has to be on a gluten-free diet, so I eliminated the flour and used a total of 6 tablespoons of corn starch.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It had a shallow 4 inch crack in the middle when I took it out of the oven, but it wasn't a big deal to me.  The taste was perfect!  Not too sweet, very creamy... exactly what my tastebuds were hoping for!  I served it with sliced strawberries that had been sprinkled with sugar to make a light syrup. Very, very good recipe... Thanks for sharing it with us!

Not bad for no crust and something less heavy. I was shy maybe 1/4 C of Sour Cream and used 1 C sugar. I did drizzle about 1 T of honey into the batter. Used full fat ricotta as well. Everything went splendid until I pulled cake out too soon from oven. It developed a crack after about an hour afterwards - but really, I don't care...just reporting, lol. I covered the top with a strawberry glaze that included fresh sliced berries that covered  3" long crack on top.  No big deal for myself. I had filled a roasting pan 1/2 full with boiling water to sit under the cheesecake but it cracked due to rushing things. Sidenote: I am at sea level so not sure if anyone at high alt needs to make adjustments but I believe you probably should. Just an FYI. Oh...
I did add lemon zest along with the juice, very good! Also used fresh vanilla bean and added 1/4 t of almond extract. YUM!

The taste of this cheesecake is divine but the texture is all wrong no matter how I make it.  Its so mushy I can't cut it even after refrigerating over night.  I even tried an extra egg but that didn't help.

First time ever making a cheesecake and it was easy to do & delicious! I made one tiny adjustment cutting back on the lemon and increasing the vanilla just as a personal preference. Searched around a lot for one containing ricotta and this was perfect, exact taste & consistency we were looking for.

I followed the recipe to the T.  The cake was good but a little  wet and gritty. If I cooked it a little more than an hour it probably would have tightened up but why do you think it was gritty? Patsy

To die for!  And so easy.  I had no idea that it would be so easy to make.  Definitely a day-before project, since it takes so long to cool.  But only a short amount of my time to prepare.  Fabulous!  And I cut and froze remaining portions for a later date!
