I used pecans instead of the walnuts to make these chocolate pizzelles. By melting the butter in a large pan, the need for a bowl is eliminated! With or without the chocolate frosting glaze, these are good!

Tasty but they stuck quite a bit to the iron and it took a bit to get them to come off.

A group of us were giving a bridal shower at school and decided on a sundae bar.  I used my pizzelle maker to create 4 delicious flavors of ice cream bowls, made like waffle cones bowls, creating 105 bowls.    This review is for the ‘Italian Pizzelles’ – chocolate flavored.  The batter for this held up very well when making the bowls.  It was a thicker batter and held the ice cream best.  I got 29 cookies from this recipe and it took 40 seconds per batch. The other recipes were:  ‘Pizzelles II’ ‘Pizzelles III’ and a personal recipe from ‘What’s for dinner, mom?.’

The easiest and best tasting chocolate Pizzelles!  My 11 year old daughter made them for a Girl Scout Fundraiser and they sold out.

These came out great. I have a teflon pizzelle iron that produced perfect cookies.  I lightly dusted them with a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon. Family loved them.  :)

Just a note: but you want thinner pizzelles, use one more egg
