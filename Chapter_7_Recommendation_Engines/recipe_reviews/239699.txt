When I tasted these I couldn't quit figure out what was missing. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cumin but it still tasted a little flat. Perhaps some cayenne added to the mix would help. I can say that this is worth playing with.

I didn't have any heavy whipping cream, so I subbed milk. I also think I used too much olive oil in the pan. My eggs were super watery. I am going to try this again tomorrow morning closer to the recipe and see how things change. Overall though, these eggs were very tasty paired with chicken sausage. Even my almost 3 year old ate some and said, "Mmmm!"
