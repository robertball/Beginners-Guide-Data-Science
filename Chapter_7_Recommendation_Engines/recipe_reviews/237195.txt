Wow, this was so very delicious!  I made this using the oven method described in the notes since I didn't feel like starting up my grill.  Served it with Thai roti bread (very easy to make).  We used the leftovers to make the Satay Chicken Pizza recipe from this site. (I used roti bread instead of pita for the crust which probably tasted even better, IMO.  Can't wait to make this recipe again.  Thanks, CaptainCook!

Loved this! Followed directions exactly, cut chicken into strips and let marinade for a couple hours, it was so good! My only worry is that my husband will stop taking me to our favorite Thai place once he found out I could make this at home! Paired it with a curry eggplant dish, cucumber salad and rice noodles...Thai heaven! Make this easy and delish!

This is so very excellent! My kids liked it and my husband raved about it! Since I didn't have any lemons, I substituted the juice of 2 limes and added 1/4 c. seasoned rice wine vinegar to make up the rest. I marinaded the chicken breasts for only 1 hour and it still came out very flavorful. My husband prefers to have his chicken well-done, so he grilled for 6 min. per side, which made the chicken a bit dry....I'd stick with the 5 min. per side. Quick, easy and super flavorful recipe!

My entire family LOVES this recipe--picky kids included.  It is so simple to put together, and incredibly flavorful.  After we remove the chicken, we bring the marinade to a rolling boil for several minutes to kill any bacteria and reduce it, then use it for a dipping sauce.  Or, if reusing marinade grosses you out, simply double it, and set half aside for the dipping sauce and the other half for marinade.  I serve it with coconut rice (which also goes well with the sauce).  Delicious!

Did not make changes this time. Next time will use lite soy sauce and possibly less of it. May add more peanut butter . otherwise it was interesting.

This recipe is excellent.  I used Sriracha for the hot sauce, and minced garlic from a jar.  I served it with a peanut dipping sauce, which I think helped.
