Oh, my gosh, I think I died and went to heaven!absolutely scrumptious! I didn't have dates or raisins on hand so substituted 2c. rainbow mini chips and walnuts for the pecans but this is now my all time favorite recipe.love the fact it uses oil instead of butter or marg., makes it really easy to cream.

These are the best cookies, I have ever tasted. I love it because it yields so much. It makes it so nice to be able to freeze the dough and bake whenever you run out of cookies. The only problem is the cookies don't last long around my house. They are so easy to make.

I had my kids help and they had fun with this. Because my kids aren't too fond of pecans, coconut and dates, I used my food processor to blend these ingredients up fine so they just didn't see them as well.  (What they can't see, they can't complain about right?)  Anyway, they went over really well with them.  I dinged this recipe only 1 star because it had a slight oil-y taste, but it didn't detract from the cookies much.  (Perhaps I should have used vegetable oil instead of canola...)  It makes about a double batch of cookies, so you can easily halve it and freeeze part.  Thanks for a great recipe as printed.

I don't think I've made cookies with oil before and I'm impressed with the ease of preparation and lightness of the cookie. The flavor was a tiny bit bland; however I didn't use the dates or raisins, and maybe the taste would have been improved by those additions. I will try it again with part whole wheat flour or more brown, less white sugar or maybe a touch of spice. I do love the appearance and the crispy outside, chewy center. I baked at 350 for about 10 minutes. Thank you Meredith.

Great recipie.  A new favorite!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white to get a nuttier flavor and I reduced the oil to 1& 1/2 cups so the cookies are nolonger crumbly.  This is a fun recipie.

I made these for the office and found that they were some of the best cookies most of my co-workers had ever eaten.  I got raves for them and at least a dozen people asked for the recipe.  I have been told I must make them again.

A couple notes when you make them.  First, they are very crumbly and dry when you put them on the baking sheet.  Don't worry, they rise a little and get chewy and are not dry.  Don't worry about the lack of butter, but use a good quality of oil.  Also, I tried the time at 10-14 minutes but had to cook 17-18 to get them to brown.

I made these and the ingredients list does not call for butter. Also, the instructions do not say when to put the white sugear in.  Cookies were not good.

These cookies are one of the best I have ever made. My family does not care for dates so instead I used chopped dried cranberries and they are excellent.

wow, these were really good! I only made half a batch, and got about 45 cookies out of it! The kids really had fun making these cookies with me. I didn't change a thing, and I was surprised how many people liked them, because usually, my family always has something to complain about! Especially if it doesn't have chocolate in it!

These cookies are scrumptious!! One does need a dishpan to combine all the ingredients. Baking time was increased to 15-16 minutes. I'll certainly will make these again.

These are GOOD! Definitely toast the pecans- it gives them a much better texture and flavor.  I cut the sugar by a cup total since my coconut was sweetened.

Yum yum yum....these cookies are delicious and the texture is perfect (crisp on the outside, soft on the inside).  The cookie dough was irresistible and I had to fight off my kids and husband from the bowl.

Great cookie, the cookie monsters in my  house were very happy. Crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside. And I don't have to remember to take the butter out of the fridge.

This recipes is a staple in our house, especially at Christmas time.  I always have requests for the recipe!  We don't care for raisins or dates, so we substitute toffee bits and chocolate chips.  I love that it makes so many cookies, as we have a lot of holiday functions and it is nice to throw some on a tray and go!  My favorite thing about them is the crunch of the cornflakes in the chewy cookie.

Made mine with chocolate chips instead of dates and raisins. Turned out really good except a little too chewy I think because I used old fashioned oats and quick cook probably would have been better. Also adjusted oven 340 degrees for 14 minutes and they came out perfectly done. Great recipe! Thank you!!!!

Fantastic cookie!
I added these to my list of 12 Cookies of Christmas this year. 
My husband doesn't like coconut so shhh don't tell him it's in there.  He doesn't have a clue.  He isn't fond of raisins but it isn't stopping him, ha! 
I ran out of regular Pam so used the coconut oil Pam to spray my sheets.  Tastes great!  I also compensated for being 1/4 cup shy of dates with 1/4 cup more raisins.  No complaints.   Thank you for a great tasting cookie.  They're sure to be a big hit!

We don't eat much cereal, so when I need it for certain recipes, I go to the Bulk Barn and just buy what I need.  However, our local store was out of corn flakes, so I substituted with bran flakes....very delish.  Also added dried cranberries instead of raisins.  Awesome recipe!

These are great.  The recipe says bake 10 to 14 min or until golden brown.  The first pan full were tasty but hard as a rock after they cooled.  I baked the next pan full for 10 minutes and they were perfect.  Very soft and chewy.  We loved them and our 86 year old neighbor said they were exactly as she remembered.

I assume everyone's oven is different but suggest adjust the baking time and you will really like these cookies....

Also I won't be  adding both raisins and dates next time.  But will double the amount to dates or raisins...

I might also suggest that before you mix the corn flakes, dates, nuts, coconut, etc  ingredients into the sugar/flour  mixture that you spray your hands with Pam and actually mix the cookie dough by hand as there wasn't any way that I could mix all of that together with a spoon.

Great cookie recipe that's easy to make any time because you don't need to wait for butter to soften! I used crushed Corn Chex cereal and omitted the pecans. Everyone loved these. The cereal adds an interesting crunch to the cookie. It took longer for mine to bake, more like 18-20 mins and I was concerned they wouldn't set up because of the oil. But after they cooled, they were fine. I used parchment paper so it was easier to re-use the cookie sheets for each round of oven time (I can only bake one sheet at a time in my tiny oven). I plan to make more and will sandwich ice cream between two cookies for even more yummy fun.

Good cookies -- I halved the sugar and salt and used mostly olive oil and a little vegetable oil. I took the advice of others and added cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and a little nutmeg. I omitted the nuts and used fewer dates and raisins. It makes a lot of cookies and they are tasty -- great recipe if you have to make a lot of cookies and are out of butter!

made these cookies for a wedding, wanted something that made alot of cookies so i didn't have to mix often. i did have to add a bit more flour, but of course i didn't measure how much more i added, and i had to use almonds because i didn't have pecans. The cookies were wonderful, everyone LOVED them. the bridal party was "testing" them during rehearsal and were well recived. will make again, hopefully with pecans. and i plan on trying this wwith cranberries.
