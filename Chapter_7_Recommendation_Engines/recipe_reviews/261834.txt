Question: what is the second amount of Parmesan for? I've made this twice now, trying to get it right. I  pared the recipe down to get one serving , which is 1/4 of a cauliflower.  There is no way that  provides enough for a "sandwich", and especially not half inch thick pieces.  The resulting sandwich was half the size of my palm.  So I tried the recipe again with half a cauliflower.  The result was still a smallish sandwich but in half inch thick slices as per the recipe. I didn't enjoy it at all.   If anyone else intends to try this, my suggestion is make the slices 1/3" at most.  I might try this again but not today.  Mrs Sipple is the recipe submitter and took the beautiful picture.  In my opinion those are not half inch slices, they're much less.

I would add to this recipe that you MUST squeeze out as much water as possible after cooking the cauliflower (with a clean dish towel, cheesecloth, etc). And I would challenge Ms Sipple to take the grease/fat/cheese content down a bit with an almond or coconut flour addition. Just my two cents. Great idea, though.

very tasty. but with so much cheese, how could it be anything else? not sure I nuked the cauliflower long enough as it never really clumped as described and had more moisture in the bite than I think was itented, but delicious nonetheless!
