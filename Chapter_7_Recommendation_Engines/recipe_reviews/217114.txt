Perfect. I've been craving this and it's so simple and perfect. Nom.  Dashi granules are often sold as "hondashi" or Bonito Soup Stock Bouillon.  It doesn't say "granules" on the package.  I found it in the spice section of 99 Ranch in a box.

I ate this same dish (minus the sesame seeds) growing up...still LOVE IT- very simple but tasty. Holly T- you can order dashi granules online from Amazon if you can't find them in your ethnic store (never seen it in regular supermarkets).

I was an exchange student in Japan and my Host Mom would serve this for breakfast with rice and miso soup, YUM!!  I want to make it but I am not sure where to buy "dashi granules" and "bonito shavings"???  Would they be in the ethnic food aisle or would I have to find a Japanese market?

A delicious, refreshing, & light dish. I served it as a side dish at a sushi making party with some friends.  Bonito shavings can be hard to find, but I found a bottle of bonito flakes+black sesame seeds+seaweed flakes all in one at a local Japanese market.  The black sesame flakes really pop against the tofu.  Very yummy, will make again.

Delicious! I eat it like this, cold, or warm up my tofu in the microwave for a minute. I can even get my 3 year old to eat tofu this way. Remember to compress your tofu to release all the water that it has absorbed in order for it to absorb the flavor of this dressing instead before making this dish and it'll be much better!

Loved it! Surprisingly easy to make. I didn't have dashi at home, so I substituted that with miso paste. Kept everything else the same! Thank you

Healthy, easy and tasty recipe. I love it. I used to use soy sauce only for tofu hiyayakko but now I love using this recipe. What makes it even better is using naturally brewed soy sauce. Tofu, this recipe and naturally brewed soy sauce make a perfect dish!

Spoted bonito flakes @ Wholefoods for about $10. Didn't buy it because don't know what else to do with it so I used roasted seaweed I had on hand.  Yummy!
