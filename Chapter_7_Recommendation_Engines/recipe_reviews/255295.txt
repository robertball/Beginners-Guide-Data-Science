I made it just the way the recipe is written other than making only half a batch. It was delicious on grilled caprese chicken sausages.

I love basil and I used so much that it looked much greener. Basil is not subtle and I wanted this to pop! I also added some salt and substituted lime juice and zest instead of lemon. It went fast. They say it will keep for about a week. You will need to make a gallon in this house for it to last a week.

I made this exactly like the recipe. I tossed it with with grilled chicken strips, sliced zucchini and tomato from my garden. The basil was homegrown also. Delicious! Can’t wait to try it on salmon or a BLT.

Made as directed. Super easy. Doesn’t need salt at all.  Used it with sautéed chicken on brioche buns.  This was fantastic. Everyone loved it.  Thanks

I may have added more basil...didn't really measure it, just did it to taste. I used this aioli on a roasted red pepper panini with pepper jack cheese and it was THE BOMB! :)
