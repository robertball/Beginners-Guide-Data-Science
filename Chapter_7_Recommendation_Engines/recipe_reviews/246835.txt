This is the real deal. 
I used my Instant Pot Electric Pressure cooker / slow cooker. 
I trimmed the beef, cutting along the muscle and removed any grizzle and any large hunks of fat.   Seared the beef as directed in the Instant Pot using the saute feature.  Once the beef was seared, I deglazed the pot with the vinegar and broth.  Added the meat and seasoning and cooked under pressure for 30 minutes, then switched to slow cook until you are ready to eat.  
The meat is very flavorful, not overly spicy.   Perfect for tacos, taquitos or burritos.  I made this a day ahead of time, cooled and packed into mason jars.  The next day I skimmed the fat and re-heated the meat.  Fried taco shells and dinner was ready.   Perfection!

I am rating this recipe because it deserves more reviews so people won't be scared to try it.  Muy simple y muy delicioso.  My BF, el taco snob, absolutely loved this!  I recommend making some spicy pickled red onions to top these bad boys off.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be my go-to from now on.

I made this for homemade "street style" taco filling.  My family and I loved this!  The meat was super tender, juicy - melts in your mouth .. just awesome!  I will definitely be making this one many times in the future!   A week later, I made this again, but used 3 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breasts and chicken broth instead of the beef.  The chicken tacos were just as awesome as the beef tacos of last week!  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jack!

1/16/18 - Very good recipe for Barbacoa! Excellent flavor! Made as written and this will be our go to recipe for shredded beef for tacos, tostadas, taquitos, etc. I was a little concerned when I removed the beef and tasted the liquid alone. Once you put the shredded meat back in the slow cooker, everything comes together. I did not notice a strong vinegar taste and it was not too spicy for us with the amount of chipotles called for in the recipe. If you are hesitant to try this because of the peppers, reduce the amount by half should be ok, but we felt it was on the mild side as is. The only change I will make next time is to add more salt towards end of cooking. Thank you for the recipe! UPDATE 6/27/18 - Made this in the Instant Pot with 2 lb chuck roast, fat trimmed (Meat/Stew option for 45 min let natural release for about 15-20 min, then quick release). So delish and shredded nicely This time I used 5 + 1 really small pepper in adobo sauce (6 total) and the meat had a slight kick to it, but not overpowering. Slight vinegar taste did come through more, but not overwhelming at all. Might reduce the amount a little next time. Excellent recipe!

We have made this many times. It is a staple in our home! What really makes a difference and gets the meat so tender is to prepare it beforehand. Take out the chuck roast, put on a plate, pat dry with a paper towel and season both sides generously with salt. Leave it on the counter in room temperature for an hour (do this with steaks also, it makes meat so tender and juicy). I cut it in large chunks and sear it before putting it in the slowcooker. It is torture smelling it all day, but so worth it!!

Great recipie....  Very flavorful and beef just fell apart!!  My husband loved it, but be careful using 4 chipotle peppers even though very small ... They are very POTENT and makes for a very spicy meal!  We definitely will make again but may try to use just 2-3 peppers instead of 4!!

This was delicious!  The aroma overtook my husband, and he had a taste before it was done cooking.   My only edit...It cooked in about six (6) hours instead of the amount listed for the slow cooker on low.

We also added bell peppers and onions for the last hour and it was perfect for us.

Amazing and easy! I don't have a slow cooker so covered it with foil in a glass baking dish, oven at 250 for 6 hours. Took it out to shred, recover and cook for 1 more hour. Can't handle too much spice so I scraped out the seeds and it has a nice kick without making my mouth sad.

Let's start by saying I don't care for the chipotle flavor much but my husband and brother said hands down the best tacos they have ever had! And not to brag but I make some fire pork tacos. My mom doesn't even eat spicy stuff and she ate a ton! It's definitely got some spice to it! So it's a hit here and will make it for many more dinners with friends!

I doubled the recipe because I was making it for a crowd. It was extremely moist and just fell apart (in a good way!) when shredding. Very flavorful!

This was fantastic!  I made a double batch of this for street tacos this weekend and my friends and family ate it up in no time.  When it was done, I was worried that the beef was too spicy, but once you put it on a tortilla with a little cabbage, sour cream and pickled red onions, they were perfect.  The only changes that I made to this recipe were:  1. I added a chopped up bell pepper to the meat mixture in the crockpot to give it a little texture, and 2. I used a cast iron pan to braise the beef, so the amount of oil listed was really not necessary.  Other than that, I would say this is perfect.  My friends and family raved that they were the best street tacos that they had ever had.

I make this all the time. It is definitely my favorite meal. I use dried chipotle peppers instead of canned, but leave everything else the same. Perfect.

WOW! This is good! It smelled just like Chipotle but in my opinion its wwwayyyy spicier than Chipotle! I will make it again for sure but use less chipotles in adobo. I also made cilantro lime rice.

To shred the beef easily, use beaters. (Yes, as in regular old beaters that you use to make cake mix.) 
Awesome taste!

Holy tacos!  Used a regular crockpot to make this recipe... easy to toss together my only complaint is that it took too long to cook and I thought I was going to starve smelling it all day. Must get a faster crockpot! Meat was tender, juicy and had just enough kick to it. Will be making this one again!

Delicious!! A little spicy, but we love food with a little kick. Cut back on the amount of peppers if you don’t like too much spice. We added it to brown rice, pinto beans, fresh Monterey Jack cheese, and sliced avocado. Yum!

I made this recipe in my pressure cooker. It took about 35 minutes to cook the meat once I seared and browned it in a skillet. The meat was flavorful and tender. I over used the chipotle peppers on my first batch and thus my taste buds were dancing. I made a second batch according to the recipe and the heat was drastically reduced. I like Tex-Mex dishes and this recipe certainly fit the bill for me.

I made this in my instant pot. I sectioned my roast into equal pieces, but did not sauté in oil. I just seasoned it, added the remaining ingredients and cooked on high pressure for 50 minutes, with a natural release. Perfect for tacos, quesadillas, nachos, burritos, enchiladas, tortes, etc.,

Awesome dish - but if you don't care for spicy food or have kids that would prefer something more mild, I would cut the peppers in half.

I made this fantastic recipe 100% by the directions. It is awesome! The flavour was great. The texture was great. My kids loved it. This is another slow cooker meal that totally works. 15 minutes of prep time was perfect.

This is an AMAZING recipe!!! I did cut the chipotle peppers on half because it would've been too spicy, but we are looking forward to leftovers tonight! I made burrito bowls with this shredded beef and they were delicious--definitely making this again!!!

I just ate some chicken I made using this recipe like another person commented . Tasted exactly like Chipotles Barbacoa. I was afraid the 4 chipotles would be a little too spicy but it was just the right amount. You should really try this recipe. You wont regret it.

Just finished it.  Tastes great.  Maybe a bit heavy on the oregano, but just bought oregano today in the plastic packets in the Mexican seasoning section.   Maybe because its fresher  the oregano was a bit stronger then the bottles of seasoning.

I made this in my electric pressure cooker.  Browned the meet according to recipe, and cooked it on high pressure for 30 minutes as advised by Baking Nana. Meat was nice and tender with plenty of flavor but it was a little too spicy for me; edible, but had a kick!!!  Next time I'll add 1/2 the chipotle peppers.

I love spicy, so I added a whole can of Chipotle peppers (6) to about 2 lbs of beef.  It was amazing!   I’d like to find a recipe to have some of the Chipotle peppers as a sauce to put on the meat also.

I actually used leftover beef from several sources and it only took 2 hours at 250f convention.  I used green chilies and some jalapeño s instead of chipotle pepper. Fabulous flavor. Going into my top 5 Mexican recipes..  thanks so much for sharing

This is definitely a “make again”!  Followed the recipe, & our guests liked it so much they had seconds & wanted the recipe! We tried it in buns & also wrapped in a tortilla. Liked it in the tortilla a little better, though it made a hearty sandwich in the bun!

I've made this recipe as is and its pretty good but it's more of a base recipe. Now I amp it up quit a bit  with alot more peppers,  onion,  fire roasted tomato (in the broiler) and puree the rest of the ingredients a blender (not the meat or bay leaves).  It makes a great marinade too. After browning the beef chunks i add to the crickpot, add the puree and top of w/ bay leaves and set in the fridge overnight. Everything is all set for me in the morning and so all i have to do is place the crock in the pot and set and forget .

Add this with a Nilgai (similar to Venison) roast.  Wow!  
Moist and delicious.  Add some pico  de gallo, fresh avocado, and sour cream and make a wonderful burrito.

Made it for a football day party.  It was very popular.   I wasn't sure how spicy it would be so we used half as many peppers.  Will add more the next time we make this dish.

What a hit. The meat just melted and was a breeze to shred. The flavor was perfect but I only used 3 chipotle peppers rather than four. I also made a delicious side dressing with mayo, sour cream, lemon juice and two chipotle peppers which a great compliment to the beef.

I followed the recipie as is. I have to admit I was skeptical as I also feel all crockpot recipes taste the same but not this one! It is very flavorful. I used my dual crockpot buffet server. On one side I put half with two chipotle peppers. The other side was for the kids, no peppers. The spicy side was very spicy! In the future to adjust to our personal  preference i will use half the cumin and maybe less vinegar. Great recipe overall.

This was WONDERFUL! I used 5lbs meat and put the spices in a blender. The whole can of adobo was a bit much for our family and our guests, but so delicious we still ate every bite. Next time I will use maybe a half a can? Excited to make this again!

So SO good. Made this pretty much as directed but only used two peppers...we’re  wimpy when it comes to heat. But it still had a little kick. Everyone loved it! Spooned it onto soft tacos, with a little slaw made with mayo and Frank’s Hot Sauce, some crumbled chihuahua cheese, sliced avocado, and a dollop of sour cream. Perfection! Enjoy!

Loved this recipe! I used 2 1/2 chipotle peppers and it was perfectly spiced. Will make again! Great as leftover meat too.

Ingredients for this recipe are a great start!  I suggest adjusting ingredients to your liking. I didn’t use cloves and cut the Chipotle peppers by half. Also used 1 tbsp powdered Boullion to the 1/2 cup water and had a richer flavor. I’ll stick with this recipe.

This was okay.  The meat was tender, but the vinegar taste was overpowering.  If I make it again, I would cut the amount of vinegar in half.

This got an immediate "make this again" from my family. I used two 1.5 lb chuck roasts and cooked them on low for 7 hours. I did not cut up the adobe peppers and just pulled them out before I shredded the beef. I served it with sauteed peppers and onions.

This was delish! I only used 2 adobe peppers and I thought that it was perfectly spicy. However, Hubby would have preferred some additional heat.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Pretty good, but not over the top.   I'm not sure what I would do to get it up to the 5th star.   I'm going to use the leftovers for a beef tortilla soup.

Amazingly delicious!! I have made this many times. The only change I make is adding more chipotle peppers in adobo sauce because we like the spiciness!! Contrary to most Minnesotan preferences! Lol

I tried the recipe and it turned out bad. It was pretty mushy and flavourless. This is going to be the last time I try a slow cooker recipe with anything acidic because it just ends up dissolving and ruining the meat. I think I will salvage it by pouring out the broth and add barbecue sauce and make sandwiches out of it. Ugh, just terrible.

Smelled great while cooking, but was underwhelmed when I ate it.  Not bad but nothing I would crave.  If you use enough condiments, then the meat becomes less important.

This tastes absolutely fabulous!  The only thing I did different was I cooked meat in the oven (I'm cooking for 10 people), shredded meat, then poured the sauce over it.  I've made it twice and it's fabuloso!

FANTASTIC! I had friends over this evening for Mexican night. I wanted to try something new so I tried this recipe and I followed the directions exactly how they are written. Didn't change a thing. It was so flavorful and delicious! Everyone LOVED it as much as I did. I will be making this again!!!

This was excellent! I cooked it in a pot over the stove top and used flank steak. It was incredibly spicy so maybe next time I will take it easy on the chipotle with abodo sauce!!!! This will definitely be a favorite in our house!!!!!

Made this for a group neighborhood get together. Both the kids and adults loved this. The crock pot was scraped clean. I'm making it again. This time without 4 chipotles chopped in. I think it made it spicier. In hour 4 of being in the crock pot I had a taste and feared it was too hot. In that last hr of cooking I removed the marinade and added the rest of the broth instead.

Made as per directions except used a dutch oven. @ 285. 
Meat was falling apart in 3 hours. We made tacos out of it, and my Mexican wife absolutely loved them. That speaks volumes. 
The only problem I found was that it was a bit greasier than it should have. Solution to that is to trim fat before searing. 
That is the reason for the missing star. 
muy bueno

I blended ingredients #4-11 with one small onion to make a sauce and poured it over the meat in the slow cooker.  I will make this again.  May use it in enchiladas to change it up.

This was fabulous!  very authentic beef barbacoa.  Loved the flavor and once I took the meat out and shredded it, it wasn't as greasy as other barbacoa's I have had.  The aroma, while cooking, was amazing.  Couldn't wait to try it!  it totally lived up to my expectations.  I made exactly as recipe states.  Delicious!

Made this for cinco de mayo,and will def make again.After checking in about 6hrs or so,all I could taste was the cumin,but some salt fixed it to perfection. I always go easy on salt when cooking something for long periods,so I guess I went a little too easy!!
