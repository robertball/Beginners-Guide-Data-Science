Liked it very much , chicken was very tender .
if you use natural honey you need a little bit less because it turned out very sweet

Love this recipe! There is one small change that I will do the next time I make it though. I'll use a little less oyster sauce.

Good recipe, great flavours. I used pure honey and it made the sauce a bit runny. Will definately make again with different  honey.

I used this as a basis for my own creation. I have THE pickiest husband. Chicken turned out very flavorful and tender. I liked the sauce as a dipping sauce.
