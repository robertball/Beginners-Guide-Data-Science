Very good.  Another way to cook is to put these under the broiler. I wrapped the bacon in the other direction than the steak wrap so it kept the cream cheese inside.

Excellent recipe!! Thank you

Wow, this is definately one of the best steak dishes I have ever had and was an absolute HIT at my football party last weekend. I was a little suspicious of using filet mignon, but realized afterward that it works the best because it can be pounded smoother than regular steak (less fat). I was also amazed at how many strips you can get out of one filet! Remember to wet the skewers before you put them on the grill and make sure to wrap the bites up well so the cream cheese doesn't ooze out. Also, make sure to wrap SMALL bites, otherwise its way too hard to eat. The first time was a little experiment, but once you get this down, you will not be disappointed. Hope all this helps!

I was a little scared to use filet to try this recipe out, but went ahead anyway. I'm glad I did, it was fantastic!! I think you could get similar results using a less expensive cut if you’re not willing to pay the price for filet. Me and the hubby generally like things spicy and I found the jalapeño to be just enough. Next time I think I'll add a bit more.

I read the review with 1 star where the girl said she couldn't get it to cook right and almost scratched this recipe. I am SO GLAD I didn't! She must just be a bad cook, because I am a novice and I got these right the first time. The trick is to wrap the bacon so that the cream cheese doesnt leak out. Also, I made the bites real small so they were easily "bite size." I grilled on low heat, made sure to keep the them off of the flame and had no trouble cooking the bacon and the steak to my liking. This was a DELICIOUS recipe, one of my favorites on allrecipe.com!!!

I've made this a couple of times & they always come out great. The only thing I change is to marinate with my own mix, though you could probably skip the marinade altogether. The tips I have are same as others: keep the pieces small and wrap the bacon in the opposite direction of the steak to keep the filling in. It's less messy to assemble if the cream cheese mix is well chilled. I've made on grill & in broiler.

These were fantastic!  I did everything the same except forgot to pound down the meat.  We put them in the oven at 450 and just left them there until the bacon looked done.  Everyone raved!

Loved it, My wife loved it, be careful not to cut the filet into too large of pieces.  smaller sections were easier to cook.  Im prefer spicy, so might add a little more jalopeno next time or a little crushed red pepper too.  Deliscious!  Well worth the prep time.

these were so delicious!  I did not have any jalapeno, so I subbed saute'd shallots instead.  Very tasty, it is a must to eat these with your fingers. They are so much better that way.  I will try the jalapeno's next time.

DELICIOUS!!!  Added a little garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the cream cheese mixture and salted the meat before I prepared everything, so yummy!  Should have made more!

these were great added white pepper, old bay,1teaspoon horseradish,and a few drops of tabasco,to doubled cream cheese mixture used precooked bacon,too cold to grill so baked in oven at 450 for about8 min. turning half way through to crisp bacon,worked great in oven much easier then watching in broiler, I agree with  reviewers who said to keep them bite size but I had trouble keeping filling inside when they were small any suggestions? I froze about 40 of them,will thaw them,and make for pre thanksgiving party  tomorrow hope they are just as good, an expirement to add them to our xmas eve. appetizer buffet

I am giving this recipe 5 stars even though I have never personally tasted it.  I made a triple batch for our Christmas party, and fifteen minutes after I served them I finally had a chance to stop by the appetizer table to try one but they were all gone. True story.  At least five people asked me for the recipe before the party ended so I'm going to say these appetizers were a huge hit--but next time I'll eat a few before setting them out for guests!

Think you could stuff this cut with just about anything and get fantastic results. I've tried feta cheese, smoked gouda, spinach and even sausage. Great every time. I also broiled them when weather was bad.

This recipe was delicious! I added a little cayenne pepper and a few more jalepenos than the recipe calls for... I like it spicy! Anyway, it turned out great and was a HUGE hit at a BBQ party we had at our house. Make sure to keep them 'bite size,' it is easy for them to get too big making them not only harder to eat, but harder to keep the cream cheese wrapped inside. Excellent recipe - Thanks!

What an excellent recipe!  I served these at an appetizer party we had for our family and I got MANY compliments.  I did use diced jalapenos out of a can instead of fresh.  People commented they were hot but they still loved them.  I also used a montreal steak marinade instead of the italian dressing.  Such a unique idea and I will definitly be making this again!  Thanks!

Every time I make this I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.  It's delicious, simple, and spicy.  I don't care for jalapenos, but how this is prepared is mild enough for my tastes, and easy enough to spice it up for those who prefer a little more punch.  This one is a keeper.  I've used it with filet as well as a cheaper cut of steak.  I do have to say the filet is considerably better, but if you prepare it properly, you could get away with shoe leather, the rest of the ingredients cover for it.  /wink

These were so delicious!! I made 2 batches & cooked one on a charcoal grill & the other on a gas grill, both @ a low temp for about 30 min. The charcoal ones had a much better taste in my opinion. They took awhile to cook, but i wanted to make sure that bacon was crispy! But both batches turned out super yummy and every single one was eaten! :)

OMG delicious and completely decadent.  The cream cheese is very rich so I might use less next time but I summarized this recipe to my fiance who looked completely disgusted, and he ended up eating most of it. Absolutely fantastic.  Not the prettiest little things, but who cares, with a taste like this.

I could not get the bacon to cook, without overcooking the steak. I tried a couple of different methods- cooking them in a pan, under a broiler, but the same results. It was also nearly impossible to keep the cream cheese from melting out.

WOW!  These are amazing!  I did as other reviewers suggested and wrapped the bacon the opposite way, which does really help to hold the cream cheese mixture in.  I also added parmesan cheese into the cream cheese mixture.  I made the "Supreme Scalloped Potatoes" on this website, those go very well with this!

Loved it!  My filet mignon strips were more like squares, and I wrapped the bacon both ways to keep it all together  I broiled them , &&they took a bit longer  But every last one was eaten within five minutes of being out!

This is one of our family's favorites! I add a small slice of red pepper on top the cheese before closing and wrapping - adds a nice extra texture and flavor to the bite.  I plan to experiment with possibly onion, asparagus...  Since I have a cholesterol problem, I change mine up a bit - still use filet but without the bacon and use low C cheese - not the same but it works for my needs and is still quite good. My family eats to the recipe.

Turned out great. I was hesitant to use a filet Mignon, but glad I did, it was so tender and easy to work with. The bacon didn't get crispy enough for us, so we ended up taking it off before eating, but end result was still amazing. Glad I tried this one out!

My mistake, didn't get meat small enough - will do again and cut smaller, otherwise fabulous!  Great combination of flavors.

DELICIOUS!!!  We *LOVED* these!  For me, they were a little tough to cook appropriately on the BBQ, but I'm BBQ challenged.  I think I'll broil them next time - I had trouble cooking them evenly, but it was entirely user error. Absolutely phenomenal recipe. Fantastic taste, and pretty presentation!  YUM!!!

Made this appetizer on a BGE at 500 degrees using indirect heat and a drip pan (took longer to cook but stayed moist and didn't burn). Concerning size, the recipe instructions are vague and reviewers say to make them 'bite size' or 'small bites' (rather subjective). I got about 12, 1/2" strips from 1.5 lbs. of filet mignon. The recipe calls for 20 strips of bacon and supposedly serves 10 (I assumed 2 'bites' per serving). I also assumed each filet was wrapped with 1 strip bacon but the recipe submitter may have intended differently. Anyhow, had to improvise by basically cutting most of the filets in half to make them 'bite size' (and they were still more than one bite unless some person has an exceptionally large mouth). Then cut the bacon to match the number of filet pieces. In spite of this confusion, they turned out great. Next time, plan to cut the filet strips thinner (3/8"). Added extra jalapeno (2 large w/ membrane and seeds removed; 1/3 cup total) and 'Slap Ya Mama Cajun Seasoning' to the cream cheese mixture. The cream cheese mixture was still tame with the added jalapeno (leave more jalapeno membrane to increase the heat). A really good recipe for the BGE.

For flavor, I give these 10 stars, but the preparation was time consuming and quite challenging for me.  I could not get them to stay together properly no matter what I tried.  Everyone really loved them though.   Thanks for sharing your recipe!

very good - I used tender deer meet and I added cumin and garlic into the cream cheese mix. In regard to the negative comment about not being able to cook the bacon without overcooking the meet - Try using only one layer of bacon (do not overlap bacon and do not use thick bacon) . Make sure the the grill is hot (at least 350) If the meat is thin enough 4 minutes on each side should give you an excellent result.  Hope this helps.

OMGosh - really good! I had a small amount of Italian dressing, so I added extra - a bit of olive oil, leftover balsamic vinegar/oil marinade from tomatoes I used in another recipe, & a romano dressing - anything like this works well in this marinade. I used a one pound NY steak & pounded the slices thinner, used minced pickled jalapeno in the cream cheese, and wrapped them up. I used the smaller bits of steak also & folded them with the cheese mixture inside. Covered them all with slices or pieces of bacon, then broiled them on a buttered cookie sheet for about 4 1/2 minutes (oops - had to pour off bacon fat), turned & broiled another minute. They are small, so I did not want to over cook them. It made 9 bigger & 6 bite-sized pieces. Served 3 - with a tasty Mexican rice recipe from this site, and added raw veggies, because we all need them. ;) PS, in reference to the one star review: The bacon does not crisp up - it never does in these recipes, but it went very well with the steak, anyway. These must be quickly broiled 2-3" from the heat source. Don't use too much filling or it will ooze.

Made these on Fathers Day for our appetizer.  Everyone absolutely loved them.  I used my own marinade instead of italian dressing.  Will make these over and over.

I don't know if it was the fact that I made these on my Foreman grill, or if I did something wrong. My meat came out tough and much of the cream cheese filling oozed out. The taste of the cream cheese with the steak was great- I think I will try to figure out how to use it with steak in a different way. One thing that I did not know- which judging by all of the posts on the internet I am not the only one. Do NOT cut up jalapenos without wearing gloves!

These bites are excellent.  However, for budget sake I used boneless NY strip instead of mignon.  They were a bit messy to assemble.  Grilling was a challenge due to very hot flare ups from the bacon. Other than that... these bites are definitly worth your effort.

Excellent recipe, has become one of our favorites.   I use a tenderizer until the meat is only about 1/4 inch thick so it cooks all the way through.

Very good! Made for a tailgate and all were eaten. I think I made them a little too big but will cut them down a little next time. Be sure to use filet. I used precooked bacon so as not to overcook the meat. Next time I might stuff with Boursin cheese.

I thought they were just ok, my guests loved them! The only thing is I don't have a grill- I live in a tight complex that doesn't allow it. I threw them in the oven at 450 until the bacon was done. Otherwise I made it as is. Turned out good! I think next time I may try microwaving the bacon about half-way first since I like my steak a little rare. Thanks for this recipe, I'll be using it again!

I do this with deer(venison)steak or backstrap, but marinate it in Italian, like they said and then a dab of cream cheesem jalpeno on top, roll up and then wrap in bacon. Get grill ready( charcoal to side and we add wood, hickory, pecan, oak, when it gets hot, meat to the side and grill. When cream cheese starts easing out side then put over coals to brown bacon! Will make you slap yourself!
