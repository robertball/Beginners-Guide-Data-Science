Good basic recipe that can be adjusted to taste. Hungarian goulash should be a flexible recipe, and you should taste it and adjust it when it is almost cooked, to suit your own taste.  I am of Hungarian origin and these changes come close to my grandma’s goulash:  there is no need to separate the onions from the meat, stir fry the onion, then add the meat, stir fry again, the add all other ingredients to the same pot except the water, stir fry again, then add the water last. Feel free to vary this according to what you have at home. Tomato instead of tomato paste, Or even no tomato! 
 I add 2-3 tbsp more paprika (the sweet kind, not the hot kind) half as much tomato paste, and may add some chopped green pepper (no more than 1/2 cup), a bit more garlic, I always add 2-3 tbsp soy sauce, and even a bit of spicy chili sauce...to enhance the beefy flavour.... the key is to let the  'gravy' form by stewing it until the juices thicken without any flour added; the cheaper cuts of beef are better for this, as they are more flavourful and provide more 'gravy'.( I use boneless short rib roast that I cube, so that I know the consistency will be uniform) if at the end the stew seems watery, then boil it down until you like the consistency, if it seems dry, then add some water.

Very Tasty! I used only 2 teaspoons of salt instead of 3 and used beef broth for 1 cup of water. I ended up adding another 1/2 cup of water than the recipe called for to thin it. Beef was very tender. Will decrease oil by half next time. This dish was flavorful and hearty.Will make again.

I really liked this recipe.  After browning the meat, I put everything in a crock pot and cooked it for about 7 hours or so.  I served it over egg noodles with a side of cottage cheese.

I am Hungarian and I make this dish quite often. However we do not call this goulash, just beef stew. We call goulash only the soup version.
Indeed this dish can be done in many different ways. With all due respect I would like to add some comments on how you can make it better (just in my point of view).
First of all it is said that you have to add the same quantity (in weight) of onions as you add of meat. So if you make goulash from 3 pounds you need to add at least six big onions or more. It makes the gravy thicker and better.
From the garlic you need to add at least a whole one not just a clove. You don't need to mince it because of the long cooking time. Just chop one clove to three-four pieces.
Please do not add tomato paste, instead add two or three tomato.
I recommend to add two sliced carrots to this quantity of meat.
This dish is best when it is a bit hot, so add some chilli to it.
Also it is very advisable to add red wine, half pint to this quantity of meat.

Carrots and garlic can be put in the pot after 45 mins. Tomato and chilli after one hour. Half of the red wine after 1 and a half hours, second half after a hour and 45 mins from the start.

Simply delicious, a real treat!  I winged it a little on both the cooking method and ingredients but not so much that it significantly changed the recipe. For instance, I added more paprika and garlic, added a little flour to thicken, and used chicken broth for the water, nearly double the amount called for.  I added some mixed, chopped bell peppers and fresh sliced mushrooms which proved to be a flavorful plus. Rather than simmering this on the stove I transferred it to the oven and cooked it at 325 degrees for 2 hours. The wonderful aroma while this was cooking was such a tease, but the result was well worth the wait. The meat was fork tender and the sauce richly flavored.  I served this over buttered egg noodles with a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle of fresh minced parsley. Even after supper hubs was still raving about it!  A definite "make again" dish.

I found this recipe to be extremely salty.  My husband and I, both of Hungarian decent, couldn't even finish our leftovers.  We're all for dishes with lots of spice and flavor - but this just had too much salt that over-powered the dish.  Maybe we're just too used to the "real thing," we were just hoping to find a goulash recipe with less fat!

Yummy! I had never tasted Hungarian goulash before this, so I was pleasantly surprised. It makes a thick, beefy stew with a heavy dose of paprika. I think it would also be great with a few vegetables, like carrots and potatoes, but this way is probably the traditional way. The longer it stews, the better, so it doesn't qualify as quick. It's great for a cold drizzly fall day when you have nothing better to do than stay indoors, and cook up some comfort! We served it with Rhonda's Spaetzel, which was also very good. P.S. We just use enough oil to keep it from sticking, so it's probably not 1/3 cup, and we used half the amount of salt called for. We also passed on the sour cream garnish.

This was delicious!  I took other reviewers suggestions and cooked the onions with the meat and used beef broth instead of water.  I only used a pinch of salt and served with a garnish of sour cream.  An absolute keeper!  I served with the German Spaetzle Dumplings recipe on this site. Thanks Wendy!

This was easy and my picky husband even loved it.  I added extra garlic, and I added some cayenne pepper and substituted olive oil for vegetable oil.  This was delicious and I will definitely make this again.  Simply yummy.

This recipe was very tasty.  I doubled the pepper, because we like it very spicy, and I put in some potatoes the last hour of cooking.  I don't think you need 1/3 cup of the oil, though.

This is very tasty, AND easy! To make it even easier, I use a dutch oven that can be put into the oven. I do all the steps up to where it simmers for 2 hours, then pop it in the oven. That way I don't have to keep an eye on it while it cooks. No stirring, etc. I set the oven to 300, covered the pot, and 2 hours later we had dinner.

Pretty good basic recipe.  I used bacon drippings to saute the onions and beef (my husband's Hungarian family uses LOTS of bacon) and used beef stock instead of water.  I eliminated the salt and increased the paprika (used probably about 4 TBS, using half sweet Hungarian and half smoked Spanish, and also used 4 cloves garlic (we really like garlic!).  I served it over buttered egg noodles.  It was good but we felt it was missing something.  I may continue to tweak for our tastes or serve over something more flavorful than plain egg noodles next time.  The beef was fall-apart tender.

I visited Budapest Hungary about one month ago and was craving some goulash. I tried this recipe and found it to be even better than some I had in Hungary. This recipe was amazingly easy and I followed it exactly as written. I served it over the homemade spatzel recipe that was on this site and had to have a moment it was sooooo good. Excellent and authentic recipe! Great job.

The food is delicious but it’s not goulash! Goulash (gulyas) is a soup, this is a stew. Also, waste of time to remove the onion. No need for that at all. I was born and raised in Hungary, cooked and watched many ladies cook stew. Don’t remove the onion, and we never put tomato paste or puree in our stew. IF it’s the season, we might put a yellow or green pepper (called bell pepper here) and 1 ripe tomato in the stew.   You can use the same base, the same recipe, and change up the meat. Try it with chicken (any part of it) or pork.

I love this recipe. I have made it a few times now. The last time I made it, I accidentally pulled ground beef out of the freezer instead of the stew meat. I decided to go ahead with the recipe anyways, just browned the ground beef and then added the spices. Instead of serving over egg noodles like usual, I mixed cooked macaroni right into the mixture. Also, i like to top this with a dollop of sour cream. Very yummy!

This was good and really easy.  I put it in my crockpot and let it cook all day.  I only added 1/2 extra cup of water because I added a 1 lb. bag of baby carrots to the crockpot.  I was tempted to add another can of tomato paste, but I fought that urge, and I'm glad I did. (Ha ha). As everything got a chance to cook together, the sauce thickened and it was just the right amount of tomato.  Served with spaetzle noodles.

As simple as this recipe is, it can be simpler and less salty:
Meat should be smaller chunks, about 1" so that it tenderizes enough. Cheaper cuts actually make it more flavorful.
Make certain you use genuine Hungarian sweet paprika, maybe a little hot, but not the Spanish, which the same.
In the oil, sweat the onions to translucency at medium heat.
Add the garlic (optional, but good)and sweat briefly.
Add Paprika , and stir to sweat briefly - There should be enough oil so you DO NOT BURN IT.
Toss in the meat and stir to coat it with the mixture in the pot. Keep turning it until it is all coated and not sticking to the bottom.
Do not attempt to sear it. It's not necessary, and it would burn the paprika mix.
Add the half of the water, reheat to low boil, cover, turn it down to simmer about 15 minutes. **
Add the half of the tomato paste, ONE teaspoon of salt. DO NOT OVER SALT.
Bring to VERY low simmer for 1 1/2 to 2hrs. Check for fluids, flavor and salt near but not at the end. 

** Alternatively, at this point transfer to a crock pot, squeegeeing all the sauce with it. Put it on at noon and eat it at supper!

Best served with nokedli or pasta with lots of surface area like fetuccini, rotini or farfale. A dollop of sour cream is nice, and creamy garlicy cucumber salad seals the deal. 
Jó étvágyat.

The one thing that you do NOT do with paprika in goulash, is, you do not put the paprika in whilst you are frying the meat! The paprika burns and tastes bitter, spoiling the rest of the meal!
If you like it with a burnt and salty taste, then this is for you.

I put the paprika in with the onions, just before the rest of the ingredients, and stirred it in. I then put in a can of peeled tomatoes, with only a good squeeze of tomato paste, no salt, no water.

After one hour, I checked the broth and adjusted the taste by adding salt. You can adjust the tomato paste then as well as add a small amount of hot Hungarian paprika if you like. If the goulash is too thick, you can add some beef or chicken stock.

Just to set the record straight, this is not really goulash. Goulash is a soup. The Hungarian name for this stew is "Pörkölt".

Other than that, the recipe is good although salty.

With my little adjustments it tasted great, better than my mom's! In general, the recipe is very good: right proportions, right directions, tasted like my mom used to cook when we were kids: we are originally from Europe and not foreigners to European cuisine. However, I managed to improve my mom's perfection :). So, my changes: I added about 6 Tbsp. of dry red wine, 3 dashes of smoked paprika, and increase amount of tomato paste by 30%. The taste and texture turned very nice and reach. Also, one adding I am going to continue practicing: I cooked beef on the hot pan with olive oil for a short time until it is brown on both sides, transferred to crockpot, added the rest of the ingredients, left it be for 4 hours on high and went for a hike with my honey. When we were back refreshed and hungry, all I had to make is mashed potato (do not forget crushed garlic!). Voilà!

I have made this twice now and I love it. The second time I did increase the garlic to three cloves but that is personal preference. I could eat my weight in this, although I probably shouldn't ;^)

This was great.  The people claiming it was bland didn't use the right paprika.  The stuff you buy at Vons folks doesn't cut it.  Get Hungarian Paprika.  It is wonderful.

This recipe is a great starting point.  I've made this several times.  After making it multiple times I've gotten it to the right taste for me and my wife.

I use FAR less salt (under 1 tsp) and less oil (roughly half), and it's plenty.  I use roughly 2 1/2 tablespoons of hot Hungarian paprika instead of sweet (I love the added kick) and I add one beef bouillon cube.  A little cayenne pepper is great for a some added heat, but it's a little much for my wife, so I avoid it now.

I cook the onions and garlic together first and after a few minutes add the meat/seasonings to brown.

Great with a couple potatoes added to the pot, but even better served over spaetzle or egg noodles.

My husband and I both loved this dish. Very easy to make. The only thing I wished I had made extra sauce. It was  so good to use with crusty bread.  I followed the recipe except I did eliminate one teaspoon of salt because my husband has a habit of salting without tasting first.  Will make it again and again.

This dish was even better after it was frozen and reheated!!! WOW.. this is my new company dinner dish! I added a cup of good red wine and it really added a richness to the broth. Also served with buttered Reames egg noodles. DELISH!

To me, it is missing a lot of the aromatics that go in this traditional dish- Add two diced green peppers( bell works in a pinch), 1 diced parsnip, 1 diced carrot, and a handful of celery leaves( diced celery stalk or root works as well). Also add about a teaspoon of ground carraway seed. 
The aromatics( carrots,parsnip and celery ( if using leaves add later or the taste will get masked). go in with the onions), the peppers go in about 20-30 minutes before finish so they are tender but not mush.
Add the ground carraway when you add the paprika. This is the way it was cooked for me when I was in Budapest and the taste is unforgettable.

Never made Hungarian Goulash before.  I don't like American Goulash so I guess I thought I might not like it.  but then Richard Blais made it for Wolfgang Puck on Top Chef this week and I thought I'd try it.  I'm so glad I did!  Here's my small changes: I added a little more water.  Actually I filled the tomato paste can 3 times... so if my math doesn't fail me that's 18 oz. of water and the recipe calls for 12 oz.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and only used 2 t salt but did end up adding just a little (abt 1/2 t) Paula Dean's House Seasoning (recipe: 1 cup salt, 1/4 cup black pepper, 1/4 cup garlic powder -- handy stuff to keep on hand -- that Paula's pretty smart) and a pinch of sugar.  Served it over extra wide noodles.  I will definitely make this again.

Fabulous!  I tweeked it slightly.. after browning the meat while pan is hot I throw in a splash of red wine (I don't measure, but I'd say 1/4 cup maybe), stir to loosen the pan drippings, then pour over meat. I agree with other reviews to only use 2 tsp salt.  3 makes it too salty even for a salt-fiend like me.  Everyone I have served it to has raved about the taste.  Also, I have cooked it in the slow cooker  - about 4 hours on high.

My review is, unfortunately, not wholly representative of this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, but I couldn't access Hungarian Paprika, so I used smoke paprika (I know, it's not the same). Nevertheless, I LOVED the way it turned out. I hope to get hold of Hungarian Paprika to try the authentic recipe. In the meantime, I have dubbed my alteration "Spanish inspired Hungarian goulash".

I was excited about this recipe but I tasted it and thought it was ok, but I was lacking flavor so I added some red wine and upped the tomato paste to 1 1/2 times what they call for.  Lso cut down the extra salt.  Also chopped carrots and chopped cabbage the last 20 minutes, and added a packet of any beef stew mix and some ketchup.  I also was making this for a serving of 12, so one packet of beef stew mix was plenty.  Once the stew mix goes in it has a tendancy to burn, so very low heat and lots of stirring.   

This is now my signature dish for whenever I have to make a meal for a family in need and when I have guests over.  Everyone always wants the recipe.

Garage Sale Anyone??????????  At a loss for words and taste. Sorry it was awful I tried this again and added peppers and ground beef.  Now I rate this 4 stars,  My beef cubes must have had not enough fat in them and the second time was just delicious.   Sorry if I was harsh at first but it was the bad meat notyour recipe.  Perhaps it was just a bad cook myself.

My Maternal Grandmother came from the Banat region of Europe and this is the real deal! Unfortunately mom and grandma had this recipe stored in their heads and did not write it down for me, but one taste of this and memories returned!! I remember them adding a touch of green pepper to theirs occasionally.  You can make this with Chicken, too. Thanks for sharing this!

I modified this recipe so that I could make it in a crock pot.  I only used one onion, left out the salt, added one tbsp of Worcestershire, and used one cup of beef broth instead of water.  I also added some ground red pepper for extra heat.  I cooked the meat on low for eight hours, and then added 1/4 cup sour cream to thicken up the sauce in the last half hour.  Yum!

I found this recipe here last fall and made it several times. If you like your a bit more spicy use the hot paprika in place of the sweet. I have served it over noodles, rice and mashed potatoes. This is one you will enjoy again and again.  I think this time I will try chicken broth in addition to some water...

I followed the recipe although I did add a little more water and 1/2 tsp of hot paprika along with the sweet, it was delicious with a big dollop of sour cream, served with Sobeys  Sensations (in Canada) extra broad German egg noodles.

I gave this recipe 4 stars, only because I modified it a bit.  I left out 'those' 2 teaspoons of salt, and only used 1 tsp. in the entire recipe,(but if you're on a sodium restricted diet....leave out the salt (altogether).. since the tomato paste already contains a large amount of sodium. Also, I used Low-Sodium Beef Broth instead of plain water, and I added in some (fresh) chopped Italian Parsley into the dish, and a bit more on top when I served it. It was very tasty this way, and I'll definately make it often throughout the cold winter months to come... as it's a very tasty & comforting dish. I served it with a 'side' (dish) of Buttered & Herbed Egg Noodles, and it was a huge hit with my family, & also with my brother & sister-in-law (who are very pickey eaters.)  Please try it this way, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

It was great! I used my slow cooker for this :)  I put all the ingredients at once and cooked for 7 hrs on low. I probably should have done 6 hrs. The taste was amazing and the meat was cooked almost to perfection! I eliminated the vegetable oil.

I've made this twice the first time using regular paprika ( didn't realize there were more than one type of paprika) it wasn't very good at all.  The second time used hungarian sweet paprika and it was much better but still nothing I will make again.  I followed the recipe as written and it looked good just didn't taste very good.

This is an easy, cheap, and hearty recipe that has become a weekly staple in my home.  It's the perfect thing for dinner on a cold Chicago night.  The only tweak I make is that I chop the beef into smaller pieces -- probably about 3/4 inch cubes -- which helps it to cook a little quicker.  I usually have to add a bit of water, 1/2 a cup or so.  I do find that even with egg noodles, this is more like 4 servings for adults.

I love goulash, and I like that this recipe uses tomato paste, as it intensifies the paprika and gives it a good consistency.  I used a tablespoon of butter to saute the onions and added potatoes and carrots, to make it sweeter and heartier.

I thought this was kind of bland- it was missing a depth of flavor- we tasted flavor on the first bite, but then it was just GONE.  I even used real Hungarian paprika- from Hungary!  Thanks for the submission!

This is a great recipe. I subbed 2 cups of beef broth in place of the water, added 2 extra tblsp of paprika and a tblsp of sugar. I even added a little more than 1/2 tsp pepper and I thought it was perfect. Served over egg noodles, the gravy was just right, not thin at all. I will be making this again, its a keeper!

This is a simple, delicious goulash recipe. It will make a very large end result though, so be prepared for many leftovers. The first time i made this, I followed the recipe directly. The second time, I made a few changes, as you can see below.

The broth was very thin, so instead of water, I reduced 3 cups of low sodium beef broth to about 1 1/2 cups for the liquid addition. When the liquids all came to a boil, I added 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken it a bit.
I also added two 8 ox packaged of fresh button mushrooms to the recipe for some extra meatiness. And about 5 minutes before serving, i slowly stirred in a 16 oz container of sour cream to give the sauce a creaminess. 

Its very good. I think the next time I make it, i will add a large can of saurkraut, rinsed, to the blend. My mom always had saurkraut in here goulash. It would aid in soaking up the juices too.

First time ever making goulash and I must say that it does need the sour cream. I kept in on low for the afternoon and the beef was nice and tender. This is an easy recipe and quite tasty. Thanks ENVIRO2

One thing about this site that is a plus is the reviews. I made this a while back, but not before reading the comments, so I cut back on the salt, used some beef broth in place of water and less oil. I've always loved a good goulash. As a kid growing up, the older ladies of our extended family and a lot of the neighborhood ladies, all made some form of goulash. I think the ones I liked best were those that added a few veggies like you would in making a stew. Rutabaga's, turnips, carrots, cubed baby red potatoes...

Good basic recipe. I had to adjust it to my taste (cut tomato paste in half, replace water with beef broth, add flour to thicken the sauce).

This was a big hit for my European visitors. only changes were I added 2 tablespoons flour to coat the cubes w paprika. It will make a slightly crusted sear and not steam the meat, plus with thicken the stew gravey. Use a chuck roast if you can get it and cut into cubes! Add the tomatoe paste first and stir 15-20 secs to get rid of the tinny taste before adding the onlions and remaining ingredients. Served over egg noodles.

Wow - simply deelish. Used cubed chicken, 12 oz tomato paste mixed well with 2 cups water, smokey paprika, scant two tsp salt total, and 3 cloves garlic. Served over short, wide no-yolk noodles; garnished each serving with sour cream and chopped fresh parsley; offered Pete's hot sauce. Steamed fresh green beans finished this delicious meal. Next time will try adding fresh chopped carrots and maybe some green pepper during the last half hour. Doubling the tomato paste and mixing with 2 cups water b4 adding probably solved the "too dry" problem many reviewers mentioned. Thanks! reviewers for all of your input - always helps. This is now a family favorite - very authentic-tasting and maybe more so if sweet paprika is available.

We didn't particularly care for this. Hubby said it was bland. I liked the consistency of the gravy, and despite being time consuming it was easy to assemble. Thanks for sharing.

This is one of my daughter's favorite meals.  I gently stir in 1/2 cup of sour cream when the meat is tender.  Warm - do not boil and serve over buttered noodles or rice.

Excellent recipe! I add a bay leaf and sometimes a bit extra paprika, but otherwise would not make any changes. Look for the Hungarian smoked paprika in a spice shop, that is what makes this recipe so good. Even the leftover sauce is delicious!

My family loved this recipe and I can not wait to make it again sometime soon. It was very easy to make and although I did not splurge on an expensive cut of meat it came out very tender, I was surprised at the results. Although not being familiar with authentic Goulash I was unaware of how to serve it so I made some egg noodles and served it on top. It was delicious and I would recommend this recipe for anyone looking to make something new for their family. I also only used 1/3 cup of oil and a can of beef broth instead of the water. I could not find any sweet paprika so I used the hot instead and did not find it to be too hot either.

We don't care for much salt ourselves, however, knowing that, I just take care to only add a sprinkle here and there.  I cooked this in a crock pot for 8 hours, and served it over egg noodles.  It was awesome.  Completely.  Thanks!

This made a very rich and flavorful dish, delicious over egg noodles, but I can imagine it with polenta as well. If you cut the recipe in half, however, keep an eye on the liquid, as I found that it boils down quite quickly. I kept having to add beef bouillon mixed with tomato paste. If you do this, you can leave out some of the salt, since the bouillon is salty.

This was delicious, like my mom used to make. It was reallly easy. Prep time about 1/2 hour. Cook time about 2.5 hours, until meat tender. Sauce came out wonderfully thick. Very important to sear meat before 2.5 hours of simmering. We served it over rice to make it gluten free. Not spicy at all, just flavorful.

I’m Hungarian and my mother made the best goulash (to me!) and while I made it with her, I never remembered how much of what went into it because the recipe was in her head and she didn’t measure anything. My mother passed suddenly three years ago, and I never got a chance to write down down what she put in. I’ve been looking since then for a recipe like hers (no carrots or anything) and this recipe is the closest I got. I made some alterations, hence the 4 stars. Here’s what I did: I added flour to the spice mix and dredged the meat in it. I browned the meat first in batches and then the onions and garlic. I deglazed the pot with the water and added it all back in. I added the leftover flour and spice mix to the pan. Perfect!! Thank you for giving me back a little piece of my mom. ??

This is excellent.  I used beef broth instead of water and decreased the salt.  I could only find smoked paprika so I used that.  It was so very, very delish.  I have made this 3 times so far and have immensely enjoyed it each and every time.  Do put the 3 onions in, they disappear in the goulash after a while but leave so much flavour!

This is a fabulous recipe. I've made it probably 20 times since I found it on this site. It's probably my favorite dinner recipe and always a hit with my family.  I like to make extra because it's a really tasty leftover for lunch. I made it again tonight and this time sautéed some green peppers with the onions. Tonight we  served with sushi rice and fresh green beans.

"You're going to make this again, right?" my wife asked me five times. 

I made it as written and it came out delicious and well balanced. I served it over egg noodles, but one could use any noodle or even pasta. The sour cream was a great addition. 

My wife suggested that I might add more tomato paste, but I am not sure that I would agree.

Awesome!  I followed the recipe to the letter (including the addition of the salt) and it came out perfectly.  Too often people "tweak" recipes to make them their own.  This one does NOT need tweaking.  Make it as is and you will have an authentic Goulash.

Loved this recipe. Made some minor modifications: added 2 Tbl of flour to the paprika mixture; used 2 garlic cloves; cooked in a slow cooker on low for 7 hrs; added 2 carrots and 8 oz of mushrooms to slow cooker after 2 hrs.
It was fantastic. Served with egg noodles.

I have seen this recipe posted by Allrecipes before and the first time I bit my lip and didn't comment. The signature spice for goulash is caraway. That is what makes goulash, goulash. Without caraway, it's beef stew with paprika. I have traveled in the region and goulash is somewhere between a soup and a stew. Yours would be way too thick to be considered goulash. I love goulash, but your recipe is for beef stew.

I am rating this recipe 5 stars based on my modifications.  I changed this recipe pretty significantly, but you can trust that the results were delicious.  I only used two pounds of beef chunks to start with.  Then I doubled the paprika, cut the salt to 1.5 teaspoons, and added those along with the pepper to a new plastic grocery bag.  I then added the beef cubes to the bag and shook it.  This method produces the most evenly coated pieces.  I cut down the oil by just under half and used olive oil.  I also substituted the tomato paste with a can of petite diced tomatoes.  For some heat, I added a few pinches of crushed red pepper.  Then I substituted beef broth for the water and added an entire red bell pepper.  My final alteration was to add 2/3 cup of cabernet sauvignon to the pot.  These alterations, especially substituting diced tomatoes for the tomato paste, took the recipe in an decidedly different direction, but it really worked out well!

Yes, have found this recipe easy to prepare with especially for me that I am cooking for 30 more or less crews on board. So i have found this interesting to prepare and cook and it saves time for me while doing the other menus of which probably am preparing 10 to 15 recipe in a day. I make Gnocchi which is served as my side dish for this lovely and delicious menu and our European crew loves this combination much. Am probably looking forward to add a photo of this, thanks to allrecipes.com.

This recipe was a big hit in my house tonight. I did make a few minor adjustments. I couldn't find Hungarian or sweet paprika so I used regular paprika and then just added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil and used half of the amount called for (1/3 cup seemed like too much to me).  I also added a beef boullion cube to the water and eliminated the extra salt. Served over extra broad egg noodles lightly buttered. Yum!  I will most definitely make this again.

This was absolutely divine!  I followed the recipe completely and it was perfect.  Reminded me of the goulash I ate in Germany as a child.  True comfort food!  Making it again tonight, and my mouth is already watering!!

This was as close to authentic goulash as I have seen.  My family loved it.  My 2 year old had 3 helpings.

This was excellent, one of my new favorites!  While making it, I realized I didn't have tomato paste, so I substituted the same amount of ketchup and then added flour to thicken it up.

I remember my mom making goulash when I was a child.  The recipe strongly echoes the one she made.  I like the slightly twangy contrast between sweet and spice.  I added wine as recommended by another reviewer.

Made this in a slow cooker but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was so yummy I didn't even mind the noodles it was poured over and I don't like noodles.

Took the advice of a couple of the reviews and added some stuff and it was pretty tasty and we will be having this again.  I added some vinegar, brown sugar, worchestshire, and extra paprika. We also topped with cheese.

This tasted a lot like the goulash my mom made when I was growing up. Yum! I used regular paprika because it is all I had, but I thought it was great like that. I also replaced the beef with venison, which ended up being reasonably tender, though I didn't marinate it. I'm sure beef would have been falling-apart tender.

Enjoyed this with just slight tweaking... To thicken the sauce I added very thinly diced potatoes which evaporated quickly and gave the desired thickness I was seeking without having to add flour. Also tripled (or more) the garlic and added a few shakes of crushed red pepper and parsley. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Not as authentic as some other recipes.  This recipe really needs much more paprika for a savory flavor.

This goulash tastes just like my mothers. For a softer tomato flavor use tomato sauce. I cut the recipe in half & used one small can of tomato sauce. I increased the garlic a lot ... that's just us.

Great meal to make when time is short.  I added a cup of sour cream before serving to make it a little creamy and it turned out great.  Also, be sure to use the highest quality, freshest paprika.  It will make a big difference.

Meh. This was good, but certainly not "great" IMHO. I made this for dinner and halved the recipe for my fiance and I last week. While we both thought this was fine, we agreed it was really lacking in flavor. I guess we just prefer sweet goulash, so the search continues (and there are PLENTY of goulash recipes on here to try!). I must say that prep couldn't be easier (and this dish is relatively inexpensive to prepare too - you don't need top quality meat since it will tenderize plenty if slowly cooked as the recipe directs). As if prep wasn't easy enough... in order to save a bowl, I tossed my salt, pepper and paprika in a large Zip-lock bag, added the meat and SHOOK LIKE CRAZY! I ended up placing my seasoned meat in the fridge for an hour or so, until I was ready to prepare dinner (which I think was a good idea btw...). My only complaint (other than lack of flavor) is the oiliness factor - I suggest cutting back quite a bit on the oil. I also suggest using the BEST Hungarian  paprika you can find (I purchased a small amount at my local spice shop relatively cheap). Served over spatzle tossed with butter and fresh parsley, a side salad drizzled with DC Girly Girl's Smoked Paprika Vinaigrette (a MUST try!!!) and caraway rye bread on the side, this was a VERY filling and comforting meal. Thanks for sharing :)

Scrumptious! I followed another reviewers instructions for making this in the crockpot and it came out great (and it was my first time making goulash)! I used beef broth and less salt like others here.   I added a little soy and extra paprika at the end to taste and served with spaetzle. The husband raved about it too!

My first attempt and I loved it.  Definitely a keeper!  My kids didn't but what do they know, they're kids!  LOL  The only change I made was I used beef stock instead of the water and I floured the beef before I browned it.  I had to use a little more stock because I found the sauce too thick but oh my goodness.  Well worth the time for this one!

I did a few things different here because I didn't have all the ingredients, but hey, I'm still giving it a "5" because it still rocked.  First, I mixed regular paprika, salt, pepper, and self-rising flour in a bag.  I cooked the onions as instructed and then browned the meat just the same.  Then I added back the onions, water, and garlic.  Since I didn't have tomato paste, I added stewed tomatoes (undrained) as well as sliced mushrooms, a little ketchup and worcestershire sauce.  I simmered for about 30 minutes.  When done, I mixed the batch together with the noodles and then added about 8 oz of sour cream.  My kind of meal!  Even my picky kids ate it.

I made a few minor changes. I used beef stock in place of the water, upped to garlic to 4 cloves, added about a 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and used a little flour and water to thicken it up a bit at the end of the cooking time. It was superb, and then it got even better as leftovers. YUM!

This is really good. Accoring to my boyfriend, it's just as good as in Hungary!! He also said it's the best thing I've ever made for him, and I've made him a lot of different meals. We couldn't find the special sweet paprika at the store, so I just used the spice labeled "Paprika" and it wasn't too spicy. We ate it over Italian egg noodles. One word of advice--don't be lazy like I was and not cut up the beef stew meat--it ended up taking too long to cook and soften so we chopped it up after a few hours of simmering. I highly recommend this recipe. Enjoy!

This was a real treat and so easy.  I did cut back on the salt as suggested and used beef broth rather than water.  I also finished it off in the oven at 350 for about 2 1/2 hours.  Give this a try...great comfort food.

This was pretty good.  I did not use 1/3 c. oil...just enough to keep it from sticking.  Served over wide egg noodles along with poppyseed lemon muffins.  We also added beef broth for part of the water as suggested in other comments and it worked out great.

Use pork or bacon lard instead of cooking oil and more garlic then recommended next time...no recipe should have that much salt in it..I cut the salt back to half...but then seasoning is always to taste right?! Everyone liked it and everyone I was feeding can be picky...so that is a good testament to the recipe...If people from Europe get mad that someone messed with their recipe then call it something else American Goulash or something else...I don't think this recipe alone will cut relations with Europe ;) !

3 stars only because I didn't get the flavour right. 
Followed the instaructions with exceptions:
Used my stovetop pressure cooker. The beef was very tender.
Didn't have Hungarian paprika. Used some sweet smoked Pimenton de la Vera.
Result:
The paprika flavour was overpowering. I don't know if the type I used was the problem.
Action:
Purchased some sweet Hungarian paprika today. I'll try again and let you know how it turns out.

I add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sour cream at the end before serving it over wide egg noodles.  I also only use Kosher salt when cooking and you don't get the " too salty" comments.

Reminded me of my childhood eating out at Hungarian restaurants with my parents in New York City! Next time I might cook for 3 hours instead of two and put the Dutch oven in the oven. The flavor was very authentic!

This is a nice recipe but I agree with others that it has way too much salt. I cut the salt down by more than half.  I also added sliced carrots and some caraway seeds.  Searing the meat is important.

Not sure what this is, but it's not goulash.  Bland and overwhelmed by the tomato paste.   I could eat it, but no one else would.  Waste of good meat.

Basic recipe is probably usable, but I'd replace the tomato paste with either a fresh tomato or 1/2-2/3 can crushed tomatoes.  More paprika and maybe some chili sauce.  Less salt.

As a Hungarian I must say that this recipe is quite far from a goulash ('gulyás' in Hungarian). The original goulash is rich in vegetables as carrot,turnip,kohlrabi and potato. At the final stage some noodles are also added.
This is perhaps a recipe of a kind of a beef stew but not goulash.

Delicious. Flavorful. Tender. Perfect. Very very similar recipe to Karl Ratzsch's in Milwaukee.  Prepared with homemade spaetzle a few times, but save a ton of time and work with frozen spaetzle.

I made no changes as it was the first time making it and it was simply delicious. It was loved by my guests and even my 13 year old! It was fragrant  and the aroma filled the house. The meat was so very tender and scrumptious.

I found the recipe simple to make, which surprised me. The longest portion was letting it simmer, but it was well worth the taste.

I served it with egg noodles, but can see where mashed potatoes or even rice would be great with it. We've eaten leftovers from it for three days!

I give it 5 stars because it satisfied all of the areas that are important to me: ease of preparation, ease of clean-up, wonderful aroma to make mouths water, and a delicious taste that keeps them coming back for more!

My favourite dish as a kid was my Mum's goulash. I have her recipe but I wanted to try a different one and landed on this. It really worked out well esp. as I made note of some of the comments and put much less salt in (about half a teaspoon as opposed to three as I really don't like salt), also added garlic and onion powder to the paprika mixture. I also used beef broth instead of water and included mushrooms. And I cooked (simmered) for three hours. Perfect goulash. Thanks!  Next time I may add green pepper.

Family loved it! We tweaked a few things. Only used 2 onions, cut the salt, added some Worcestershire, used beef broth, and added a little ground cayenne. When we can find beef on sale (London Broil was $2.99/lb this week) we add this to the week's menu. We like to cook it and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight and eat it the following the day.

This dish was AMAZING!!! I added to it a little bit though. I added 3 tbsp  Worcestershire, 2 tbsp Red Vinegar, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tbsp ketchup, used 5 tbsp of paprika and used beef broth instead of water. Absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this recipe. Served over egg noodles.

This recipe was great for a college student like myself who needs something to last him the entire week.  I found that it tasted quite like the Slovak goulash I've had.  I can't comment on the "purity" of the recipe since I am not a Hungarian, but I can say that it tastes great and is easy to make.

This is a great base recipe! I changed it a bit to suit my tastes (my mom is Hungarian so I remembered a few things she did as most Hungarian homes have their own versions) PLUS I no longer eat beef so I used chicken. I know, sacrilege. Lol.
The changes I made were: I left the onions in while I browned the meat / I used broth instead of water / I used a small can of diced fire roasted tomatoes, 1 tsp caraway seeds, 2-3 tbsp Worchestre sauce, a diced red pepper and added bay leaves while it simmered. I also added more garlic and more (smoked) paprika than called for. I let it simmer covered for about 1.5 hours, then another 30+ minutes uncovered to thicken the sauce. I served it on buttered spätzle and it was delish! 
Thanks, I'll be saving this one!

This was pretty easy to make, although when I reduced the serving size I found the paprika, salt, and pepper mix to not be enough to coat the meat and had to make more. I did reduce the amount of salt used.

This was really simple and delicious!  I covered the meat in the spices and let it sit in the fridge ahead of time and used a pressure cooker to cook it faster.  It worked out great!  Next time I think I will try it using a crock pot.

I made this two times now and am a big fan.  The second time I cooked the onions as directed but then threw everything in the crock pot on low for 8 hours.  It turned out perfect.  Also, I have a hard time finding sweet paprika so I just use plaine but then add a pinch of brown sugar in the pot as well.  Simple and hearty.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Could not be easier!  Used a rump roast, still slightly frozen, which made cubing it a good bit easier. Per other reviews, used 1 c. beef broth, 1/4 c red wine and 1/4 c water.  Added 1 tsp worcestershire sauce.  Slow simmered for 3 hours.  Meat was quite tender, and sauce is yummy.

The excessive amount of salt called for in this recipe ruined the dish.  So, cut waaayyy back on the salt, add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and make sure to use Hungarian sweet paprika, and just like that you have a delicious five star goulash dish.

This recipe was so delicious! Hands down the best Hungarian goulash I've had. I added a lot of extra paprika and also added some onion powder. The beef didn't sear like I planned and it ended up sort of pasty. I was afraid it would be ruined, but the beef still turned out so tender and flavorful. I made a few changes, and as the reviews suggested I added half of a green pepper. I also popped it into the crock pot after adding all of the ingredients, added some beef broth and cooked it on high for a few hours. I served on top of spaetzle and sprinkled cayenne pepper on top. Perfect!

This was fabulous! I have been looking for more good slow cooker recipes, and this is a good one. Another goulash recipe called for smoked paprika, which I love, so I used that instead of sweet paprika to coat the meat. I also deglazed the pan with white wine I had around, added 3 carrots cut in a large dice, and used a can of tomato sauce because I was out of paste.  It cooked all afternoon in the slow cooker, and I did have to add  another cup of water near the end of cooking. I served over egg noodles with a dollop of sour cream on top and a sprinkling of parsley. The family loved it!

This was very good.  I used flank steak since that's what I had on hand and Spanish smoked paprika (also what I had on hand).  I added a little bit of brown sugar since I didn't use the sweet paprika, and used 1/4 cup of wine in place of some of the water to give it that wine reduction richness I love.  This would be wonderful served over homemade spaetzle but I wasn't that motivated, so served over buttered egg noodles.  You probably do not need quite a smuch oil as this calls for.  I am also partial to very salty foods but felt 3 tsp. was way too much so I cut it back, then decided it was perfect.  For those with less salty tastes, I'd use half the salt and add it to taste.

Basic recipe is good but I changed it up a bit first. I used 2 cups of spicey salsa to this dish instead of water and added 1 cup of cut up celery for extra flavor.

Reminded me of childhood.  Very flavorful and easy to make. I put it over egg noodles.  The only thing I changed was I added 2 large spoons of brown sugar since I only had regular, not sweet paprika.  Yum yum, especially a day later when the flavors were able to meld.

Love this. Everyone I've served it to has asked is this beef paprikash? i always say nope, Hungarian Goulash. I usually make homemade egg noodles from a recipe on here that I serve it over. YUM.

This is very delicious and forgiving at the same time.  I did do things a little differently, but the result was delicious!  I don't care for beef, so I used a pork roast, cut into pieces.  I also substituted a 10 oz can of diced Italian tomatoes and 1 tbsp tomato paste in place of the 6 oz can of tomato paste.  I used 4 cloves of garlic (personal preference) and 1 1/2 tbsp sweet paprika 1/2 tbsp hot paprika and beef broth in place of water.  After I cooked onions, garlic and pork, I threw it all in the crockpot and simmered it all day. Served with rigatoni noodles.  Delicious easy meal.

This was good but a little bland.  I browned the meat first then the onions and garlic.  I also browned the paprika and tomato paste in the oil and proceeded from there.  I had to add a dash of sugar to cut down on the bitterness.  There was something missing but I can't put my finger on it.  I will make my tweaks next time I make this.

Made this twice now. Second time made in the pressure cooker because of time constraints. Its a very easy recipe, and we enjoyed. Not sure how authentic it is, since I don't know that I've ever had an authentic hungarian goulash.  Its tasty, but we all thought it needed a little something, but not sure what. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for dinner tonight, and we loved it! That is saying a lot with my picky kids. I was so pleased with the flavors. I omitted the oil completely and just used a bit of cooking spray when cooking the onions. This one will be made again and again.

We enjoyed this dish. I used a chuck roast and this was really budget friendly served with buttered parsleyed egg noodles and a dollop of sour cream on top. My teen even went back for seconds. I only used 2 onions as they were large Texas Sweets. Thanks this was pretty good. Not my favorite, but it was good for such an easy recipe.

This is already a fantastic meal , but you should try it by taking the egg noodles when almost done then coating the with cornmeal and frying them in butter untill starting to turn brown,this just adds a bit more flavor to the noodles.

VERY good. Not a five star, but definitely a solid four.
My fiance grew up on his mother's goulash and- much to my dismay- I've never been able to replicate it. I learned the hard way that goulash is like paella, chili, or turkey stuffing- EVERY family has their own recipe, and THEIR's is right! 
Fortunately this one was tasty enough to compete with "Mom's".

I am very glad I tried this recipe.  My husband and picky children loved it (even the 2 yr old who does not eat alot of beef).  I used beef broth instead of water as others suggested (I used the whole can which is 2 cups).  I also omitted salt to the broth/paste mixture.  I used 2 tsp salt in the coating for the beef like the recipe called for and I felt like that was too much also.  I will cut it down to 1 tsp next time.  Overall a very good recipe. I will be making this again.

Will definitely make this one again. I made some modifications based on what others had suggested and my own personal taste. I used less oil, less salt, only 2 onions, more garlic, and added a couple tablespoons of soy sauce. Simmered in the crock pot all day and served it over rice. The whole family loved it.

Perfect! I added a bit of soy sauce, replaced water with a can of consomme and water, added some potatoes, carrots and 2 bay leaves, and cooked in a crockpot for 8 hours.

Served with boiled pasta. My boyfriend loved it and ate the whole pot in one night! Great recipe for cold Canadian wintery nights!

I used pork instead of beef, rubbed it with chipotle powder as well as paprika, a little curry powder and some sea salt.  Also added carrots, and used chicken broth instead of water.  Served it over oven baked potato "chips" and it turned out really well.  Will definitely make this again.

It's OK but it isn't a Hungarian Goulash, it's more like a stew. Tasted good but ordinary.

It was very easy to make. But I found it not to be spicy at all. My son loved it though. We served it over rice.

Awesome--a big hit with the family--especially my husband.  I had been looking for a goulash recipe for quite some time.  I'm SO glad I found this one!  It's almost too easy--I'll definitely make this again.  I served this over wide egg noodles--delicious meal!  (By the way, I only used 1/4 cup of oil.)  Thank you for the recipe!

One word -- WOW!!  This was wonderful..  My wife is very picky as to what she eats and she couldn't get enough of it.  I love to make new dishes and it thrills me to see her enjoy it so.  
This was really tasty!

This is my go-to goulash recipe. I like to use chicken stock and omit the teaspoon of salt at the end, otherwise it's too salty. It's simple to make and delicious to have with crusty bread and butter.

I used venison instead of beef and it came out perfect. I like there there are only a few ingredients and no spices to overwhelm the goulash. My sons love it.  Excellent recipe just as it's written.

Could not find Hungarian Paprika. Using regular Paprika was ok but it seemed a bit harsh or bitter first day. Much better as leftovers. Will make again and continue looking for Paprika.

Did not brown the meat in oil. Threw everything in the Crockpot for 6 hours. Used two 10 oz bags of frozen chopped onions (I'm lazy like that), added  a drained 4 oz can of sliced mushrooms, 6 ounces of red wine, and a little more garlic than the recipe called for. Served over egg noodles with a dollop of sour cream. Sauce was a little thin, due to the additional liquid from the wine, but had a good flavor. Next time, I will use less water.

I followed the recipe exactly ( other than using half the salt) and it was delicious.  It reminded me of dinners at the Hungarian church in my hometown.

YUMMO! My husband really loved this recipe a lot! I followed the recipe with a few exceptions. I saw some reviews that said to use fresh tomato instead of tomato paste, and I used beef broth instead of water and once I was done browning my meat and unions I added the rest of the ingredients and cooked it in the oven in my Dutch oven on 325-350 for 2 hours! The meat was perfectly tender! Served over egg noodles and garnished with sour cream

Followed several suggestions, adding wine, and stock instead of water. Smokey Paprika is a definite. My wife that did not like Goulash of any type in the past. Loved this and had it for dinner lunch and another dinner.

I followed the advice of those who made this dish before me.  I added red wine, vinegar, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce, and served it over egg noodles.  Being 100% Hungarian, it was a dish I had never made before and I enjoyed it immensely.

Absolutely loved this. Snuck in some veggies by adding diced zucchini. It was perfect!

Per some reviewer suggestions I added a couple of Tbsp of soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup. These were good additions but I should have lowered the added salt - delicious but too salty. Also the liquid increases as the beef cooks so wait until it’s almost done to decide whether or not to add more liquid. Very good recipe! Next time I may top it with a little reduced fat sour cream.

Really loved the way his recipe came out! Meat was so flavorful and tender. I added cumin to the spice mixture. 
I added about 1/2 cup of red wine, some Worcestershire sauce and carrots and celery. With the tomato paste the sauce came out thick and rich. Will definitely make again!

This was a lot of fun to make.  We homeschool and are currently studying Eastern Europe.  The kids giggled at the word goulash as we came across it reading about Hungary, so I decided they needed to try it out! The recipe was easy, and the sauce was excellent.  We are vegetarians so I used a vegetarian meat substitute that worked well with the flavors.  I also cut the salt way back for my husband's BP issues, but I found myself adding more back in on the plate! I think next time I will be more brave and throw in some peppers and maybe carrots as a few other people mentioned.  But it was a great first try, and since my 5 & 7-year-old enjoyed it, I will be making it again!

It was very good, I'm not sure how Goulash is supposed to taste, but boyfriend liked it and so did it.  I just need to have more veggies with my meat.

I used electric fry pan to brown.  Then add other ingredients,  put on low or simmer and it acts like a slow cooker.   Really tender and tasty without watching it. We always had noodles growing up so that's what I make.

This is such an amazing recipe. I followed the directions as is, and it came out delish. Then I tweaked it  halfway through cooking and followed some suggestions, and it came out even better when I added brown sugar, vinegar , beef broth and worcestershire. This one's a keeper!

For such a simple recipe, I was shocked at how savory, tasty, flavorful it was.  Beef was tender, juicy, delicious. We served it over egg noodles, added a vegetable and salad.  I would make it again and use rice, quinoa, any number of starches. I am not a beef lover,  made this mainly for my husband, but I absolutely loved it.

I know people hate it when you change the recipe without trying it first, that said we like chunks of tomatoes so I also added a large can of whole tomatoes crushed in my hands.  Also added 3 cloves of garlic sliced and my son likes it hot so he added some hot Hungarian paprika at the table.  Everyone has their own tastes , so for us this was delicious as prepared.

This is an awesome recipe. I left out the last tsp of salt, as other reviewers said it was too salty. I like to buy a roast and cut it up for stew meat and that is what I did. It was so tender. I added more water as it simmered as I wanted to have enough sauce at the end. My dinner guests loved it. There were five of us and basically nothing was left over. I will definitely make this again.

This was a really good recipe. I couldn't locate Hungarian sweet paprika so used half Spanish smoke paprika and half regular paprika. Followed another reviewers suggestion of cooking the meat WITH the onions and using beef broth instead of water and it came out magnificently. I put my sons over rice and mine over the egg noodles - I must say...I think I prefer the rice as it enhanced the flavor more. Thanks!

I have been searching for a goulash recipe like the one I once enjoyed at a Hungarian-owned Philadelphia restaurant. This is the closest I've found - it's delicious!

I strongly recommend Attila's suggestions, particularly about using the same weight of onions as with the beef., when to add the wine, and adding more garlic (I didn't use a whole head, though). Next time I make it I'll try tomatoes - I didn't have any so I did go with the paste.

My whole family loved it, and this will definitely be a keeper!

My four children - picky eaters - loved this meal.  I had only rotini noodles so that's what I served with the goulash, and the kids loved it. I  I didn't have beef broth so I followed suggestions of others and I added 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of vinegar and a dash or two of hot sauce . I used 1/4 cup tomato paste plus I chopped up a fresh tomato and a green pepper and added them along with all the liquids. I cooked it on medium in the crock pot for 3 hours.

This is a great recipe; however, to add more depth to the flavour, I sautéed my onions in butter until they are very soft and brown (1/2 hourish).

I made this recipe in the crock pot and the beef was very tender. I wasn't sure my picky eater husband would like it but he asked for seconds and told me this was great you should have made more.  I cut the oil down to a few tablespoons and based on another comment I used less salt but when I test tasted the sauce I added more salt and I NEVER add salt to anything.  I could see adding other spices but I liked it the way it is written. I served it over gnocchi.

I added some variety colored sweet peppers and I used venison, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  It received good reviews by my neighbors.
I will definitely make this again.  My only change would be to throw in a Jalepeno or some crushed red pepper for some "kick".

This is a very tasty recipe.  After browning and mixing everything in the pan, I transferred it to a a crockpot and cooked it on high for 4 hours because I didn't want to have to keep an eye on the stove.  I did substitute a can of beef broth for the water and, as Poch suggested, added 3 tblsp Worcestershire sauce, 2 tblsp brown sugar, 1 tblsp vinegar, 2 tblsp catsup.  I also added about a cup of canned, diced tomatoes (drained) and small jar of sliced mushrooms (drained) because I am trying to add more veggies to my diet.   I'm sure it is great without the additional ingredients, too.

I used regular paprika, but I get the impression that Hungarian paprika may be a little spicier? Anyway, I added a little cayenne pepper. It came out TOO spicy after doing that (and I like spicy). I should have just went with the paprika. I also used boneless pork cut into pieces (didn't have the beef), and it worked well. I replaced the water with beef broth, added some worcestershire sauce, brown sugar and vinegar suggested by one of the reviewers. Simmered on the stovetop for about 1 1/2 hours and served over noodles sour cream and sprinkled with parsley. This was pretty good!

Definitely a keeper and will use this recipe again! Super easy with ingredients I already have on hand.

My adjustments based on previous reviews (thank you BTY): Doubled the sweet paprika, added 4 cloves of garlic, used beef bouillon, chunks of carrots. I raided freezer and used Trader Joe's mushroom medley mix and sprinkled some gravy thickener last 15-20 min of cooking. Everything cooked in 2-hrs. Served with rice.

Solid recipe. I tweaked slightly by adding a couple of splashes of worcestershire sauce and few spices. I will definitely make again, my entire family enjoyed.

My most favorite recipe on this site.  I think I've made it at least 5 or 6 times and each time is more delicious than the last.  I always pair it with the German spaetzle recipe on here and together they are fantastic!!

Made the recipe exactly as listed and it came out very very oniony and the meat (I used stew meat listed as tender) was tough and not enjoyable. Might try one more time with only 1.5 onions.

Made as written to check it out and liked it.  However, will go back to my mom in law's authentic recipe as taught her by her mom in law in Hungary[she was Austrian].  I would never again make it without  a can of good beer as part of the liquid as she always did. We don't use tomato product at all and our only veg. is the onion and half a red bell pepper. I have to use sweet paprika with a good pinch of cayenne as it is what I can get..add sugar at least a heaping teaspoon...watch the salt and adjust salt, pepper and sugar to your taste near end of cooking

I agree that this particular version is heavy on salt... but so long as we remember to taste while we cook, it shouldn't be a problem. All in all, really excellent.

I made this variant of Hungarian goulash and used beef broth instead of water, and crushed tomato's instead of tomato paste and the result was very good and tasteful. I think I will decrease the amount of salt next time - because I think it was too much when you are using beef broth.

not too bad ... 

Do not remove the onion. Removes the pot from heat, sprinkle Hungarian sweet paprika, meat impose. Crust on the meat a few minutes. Add salt to food, garlic, ground cumin (one teaspoon) a chopped pepper. A chopped tomatoes.

The end result is a creamy, thick gravy.

Bon appetite :)

I tried this recipe but added a handful of caraway seeds.  It was awesome.  Served it with buttered noodles.  My family loved it.  Best of all, my puppy, Chloe, who hates  everything  and never begs for  food,  drove us nuts until we gave her some with her dog food.  Funny.

Turned out great.  I followed the recipe to the T.  To simmer, I put in a crockpot on high.  It took about 2 1/2 hours for the meat to be tender.  I made home made Spätzle to go on the side.  I should have added a bit more liquid at some point for more sauce.

I omitted 1 tsp salt and pepper and added 3 tablespoons soy sauce. I also cooked the stew meat with the onions then transferred all the ingredients to a crock pot for 8 hours. The gravy was the perfect consistency and the meat was so tender. I served it over egg noodles. This is the first goulash I have ever tasted and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. This will definitely be one of my regular recipes. It was much more filling than expected.

Eva, you may be more familiar with goulash soup than stew, but there are a lot of variations.   It may be a soup or a stew, and it is frequently served with a pasta like product that is cooked in it.  Also it may have potatoes in it.

Delicious recipe!  Even with a leaner cut of stewing beef, it turned out very tender and flavourful with around 3 hours of cook time.  Modifications I made:  cut down to 1 tsp of salt, added 3 cloves of garlic, added 3 fresh tomatoes (chopped) in addition to tomato paste (reduced water to 1/2 cup only because of the water the tomatoes give out), added a splash of Worcestershire sauce, and used regular paprika because I didn't have Hungarian sweet paprika (and added around 1 tbsp of white sugar for some sweetness).

I make this often. I add 1T hot paprika, 2T brown sugar, 1T worcestershire. After browning onion and meat separately, I dump it in the slow cooker and leave it alone.  Also, if you can get REAL paprika from Hungary, you are in for a treat!

I've made this a few times.  My family loves it.  If you don't have time or want to make spaetzle to go with it, Reames brand frozen egg noodles go really well with this.  I usually add some diced green pepper and a little more Hungarian paprika.

This is yummy!  The only thing is that is a bit salty.  Next time I will not add the last teaspoon of salt.  It came out a bit soupy, so I just added a cornstarch slurry to thicken things up a bit.  We enjoyed ours over pasta because my daughter doesn't like egg noodles.  I might try it over spaetzle next time for a different meal.

This is a great alternative to chili when craving something hearty and spicy during the cold winter months. Instead of using egg noodles I used macaroni which was a hit in my house. This will stay in my everyday recipe file.

I cooked in the slow cooker. Upon coming home the house smelled great. Opening the lid, it wasn't thick like the picture - so I was a little concerned.  But once I added some corn startch, cooked for 20 more minutes and served over egg noodles it was hit.  Definitely will make again.  Other adjustments...Cut the salt in half and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.

I never buy chuck.. It was on sale and 'recipe' recommended. The sauce for the noodles was sooo good, thick and rich-I thought it included beef stock instead of water.. My mistake but-- not a mistake.  The meat got so tender.Everyone loved it.  It was time consuming and it better be a special occasion before I make it again. And I will… I added 1/3 cp  of cabernet savignon and it just added a hit of --goodness.

No oil and garlic please, less tomato and salt.
More onion could help.
Beef would be good for a goulash soup, just add vegetable too.
Use pork or chicken.

I added colored bell peppers as that's how I know it from my childhood. Served over Spaetzle..hmmhmm good! Taste is great, but I wish I would have made more sauce as that's what was gone first leaving a lot of pieces of meat. Keeper but gotta tripple the sauce.

It's a miracle! All 3 of my picky children gobbled it up. I followed the suggestions re reducing the oil & salt.  I also added a bay leaf.  I used chuck & it took 2 1/2 hours to cook.

This was a great recipe. It had such a unique sweet, spicy, and tanginess to it. It probably would have been a totally different dish if I had used Hungarian Paprika and I finally got some and will try this recipe again.

No changes on my end!!  I take my son to a local diner for goulash on Thursdays. He loves theirs. But when I made this, he said it was better than the diner's recipe. Kudos to this recipe. As stated I cook half the onions with half the beef then cook the other half of same. Than I proceed as recipe states. Yum!!

It was good, but it could be more tasty and spicy in my case. I would add 1 fresh paprika sliced and 150g fresh mushrooms sliced, plus a bit of chilli as flakes or as powder. 
That gives the dish the kick.

I found this recipe to be a little bland. I guess I messed it up by covering it to simmer. It was vry watery and not much flavor but very tender.

Not sure how this will turn out, and I made a lot of modifications in an attempt to be similar to an old family recipe.

So I don't forget: 1 tsp kosher salt, 1 tbsp soya sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 cup sweet paprika, 1/2 tsp ground black pepper, 3 large yellow onions in small wedges, 2lbs stewing beef, 1 cup water.

This was fabulous and so easy to make.  I made it to top off potato pancakes and make them a little more hearty.  My husband ate the leftovers later with some rice and asked when I would make this again!  That's a very good sign, he's a SUPER picky eater.

It was okay.  I'm not a big fan of dishes that don't have a lot of vegetables in them. Even though authentic HG does not have veggies, I would be inclined to add them.  Of course, then I would not have HG, I would have stew.  I don't think we are big fans of paprika.  Like I said: It was okay. If I had ordered it at a restaurant, I would not have sent it back, but I would have made a mental note that it was not a dish favored enough to order it again.  If I had to make it again, I would choose mashed potatoes (rather than noodles) as the accompanying starch.

I make this recipe over and over. I cut way back on the salt. I use low sodium chicken broth instead of water. Four times the amount of garlic, which I sautee. And, I use Penzeys Half-Sharp Paprika combined with their Sweet Paprika. After everything is combined, I bake in the oven at a low temp. It comes out syrupy and delicious.

I made this for dinner tonight and followed the recipe to a T.  Ended up cooking it on low heat for 3 hours, and it was amazing.  My teenage son had three helpings.  Served it with mashed potatoes and green peas.  Very tasy, well balanced dish.  Thanks!

My husband and I both thought this was on the bland side, and my husband likes his food more bland than me.  I followed some reviewers tips and used beef broth instead of water, and I also added a touch of brown sugar, but the flavor just wasn't all there.  It needed something more, but I don't know what...

I cut the recipe in half and added 1/2 lb. sliced mushrooms, 1 T. capers, 1/3 cup green olives, and increased tomato paste to 1 6 oz. can.  I served it over rice and made a yummy Mediterrean dish.

This was good.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out very nice.  Pretty easy to do and economical to boot.  Next time I will add a little more garlic and a pinch more salt and pepper.  Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent. I made it exactly as the recipe said, only I did add 3 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 2 Tbsp ketchup to it, as someone else suggested.  I served it on rice instead of noodles, as that's what my (Latino) husband prefers.  It took my meat 2 1/2 hours to cook.  I used chuck - so do factor that into the cooking time.  Oh, yeah. I did add two carrots, 20 minutes before the end of the cooking time which I had previously peeled and cut into large chunks.  I guess I'd been remembering the goulash my mom made when I was a kid.  Too bad I don't have her recipe, but this will do instead.

The only modification I did was adding about 1 Tablespoon of normal paprika. After cooking, I tasted the final product and was not very pleased. Once I served it, I did add dinner salt and pepper (which I never add after cooking) and it tasted pretty good. I will continue to look for another Goulash recipe but this is still a keeper.

CUT BACK ON THE SALT  Only rating it five stars because I think most people will read the comments and notice that there is way too much salt in this recipe for most tastes.  I used one teaspoon and the salt was still noticeable but not enough to interfere with the dish.  And I even used a tomato paste (Contadina) that had much less salt than others (Hunts, store brand).  I had top sirloin, so I used that and it turned out very tender and tasty.  I only had a little over a pound of meat, but I left the liquids all the same and put some carrots (added with the liquids) and cauliflower (added near the end) in.

Even after cooking for the stated amount of time, some meat was still tough. Perhaps this is best in crockpot.

Excellent!  Used less oil and salt than called for, subbed beef broth for water, and used regular paprika.  Got the beef browning, then added onion and garlic to that, before the liquids.  Soo good.  Smells wonderful while it's cooking and tastes even better.  Served with sour cream over noodles.
