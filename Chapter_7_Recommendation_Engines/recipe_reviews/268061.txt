This is, indeed, a fabulous weeknight meal, but the cooking directions are just plain wrong.   I've been cooking for 50 years, so I know that if you brown a one inch, boneless pork chop for five to seven minutes a side, it's DONE - further cooking will just dry it out and make it tough.

Instead, skip flour on chops and SEAR them on both sides over high heat for a minute or two until they develop a brown coat, then remove to a plate.  Lower heat to medium (I remove pan to get it to cool faster), add butter and sautee mushrooms  until they give up their liquid (a half a finely chopped onion would deepen the flavor here) and brown.  Deglase pan with sherry, add soup and stir with whisk until smooth; place chops in baking pan, add juices on plate to sauce in skillet , stir, and pour over chops.  Bake in 375 degree oven until sauce is bubbly, about 15 minutes (don't cover with foil).  Alternately, you could just dump the chops back in the skillet and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.

As to the optional cheese, go for it; I used parmigiano reggiano to add some depth and bite.  Cream of mushroom soup is bland, and so is the cheese she recommends (the button I would need to spell motsarella and deglase properly is stuck).  If using Golden Mushroom, I'd use both! - or some sour cream to go for a Russian vibe.  Oh, and experiment with spices - sage and thyme go well.  Serve over garlic mashed potatoes or egg noodles.

Wow, look at the reviews!  "Sounds extra tasty", "Looks delicious" , one disparaging Campbell's Soup and Cooking Sherry.  Kind of disappointing that not many people will actually make the recipe.  I read reviews to help get  better understanding of how the recipe worked and how people may tweak it based on their experience with actually making it.  As for me, I made it exactly as called for.  I really enjoyed this recipe and the optional cheese will be optioned out next time around, no need for it in my opinion.  The chops were perfect exactly as the cook intended and the sherry gave a nice mellow flavor to the sauce.  This is an easy weeknight recipe that delivers great flavor for the effort put into it.

Made it exactly like the recipe except I was out of cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of celery.  It was fantastic! I cooked  the chops first in my frying pan, then used my Longaberger baking dish.  I buttered the sides of the dish first, then after putting in the chops, which I had to layer, I poured the gravy mixture over, and put on the lid to the casserole. 35 min at 350 and they were moist and perfect.

This is an excellent recipe and very simple to make.  I've made it for years.  The only thing I add is a couple of minced garlic cloves and sliced onion which I sautee with the mushrooms.  The onion and garlic perk up the blandness of the pork.  Also I leave out the cheese.  I serve it with mashed potatoes.

Great easy weeknight meal. I defrosted a small pork loin and this was in my Inbox.  So instead of boneless pork chops, I used the pork loin cut in medallions.  I also didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used canned. Not much difference once you brown them in butter and put all the trimmings over it.

This is a keeper! Nice company dish as well as a family dish. I omitted the cheese as I felt that it would be to rich and heavy. Load on the mushrooms and enjoy!

AMAZING! I accidentally made these with bone-in pork chops. It didn't change how awesome this recipe is. The sherry adds just the right amount of undertone to the mushroom gravy to make the flavor pop. This is one of those rare recipes hubby and I both love.

Very good. I think I’ll use more sherry next time. Did not use cheese. Didn’t need it. I added onion and garlic, garlic powder.

Another keeper. I followed all the suggestions of the last reviewer. Didn’t even have to use the oven & cut the overall preparation time in half. I used thin cut pork chops & used a 2:1 proportion to the thick cut. Worked out great.

I enjoyed making this dish EXACTLY AS THE RECIPE CALLED FOR.  My son and I enjoyed it but we felt it was lacking in the flavor department a little bit.  But since we've tried it and liked it we'll now begin to tweak it to our liking.  Next time I plan to add some herbs and maybe a little bit of spice via some red pepper flakes.  THANK YOU Yoly for a wonderful recipe!

Very similar to a recipe I first made in college. Try it with dry onion soup in the gravy and fresh garlic and onions sauteed with the chops. Slow simmer works as well as baking. I will try the cheese someday, never used in pork.

This was extremely easy and very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly except browning the chops briefly -- 1 1/2 mins on each side so as not to overcook them.  I had dry table sherry leftover from another meal so used that instead of cooking sherry. I also sprinkled poultry seasoning on the chops before browning, along with the salt & pepper.  I served it with a frozen corn, asparagus & carrot vegetable mixture and pork Stove Top Stuffing doctored up with sauteed chopped apples, celery & onion, moistened with some of the gravy from the pork chop recipe.  Dinner was ready quickly and clean up was easy.  There were no complaints & no leftovers.

Absolutely delish!  The pork chops I had were only 1/2 inch thick so I didn't bother with the oven part -- just cooked for awhile on top of the stove.  I didn't have sherry so used Pinot Grigio, and it was so good.  I think any white wine would work.  I would never have thought of adding cheese at the end, but I think it added a lot to the dish.  I used mozzarella as the recipe suggests, which was mild and didn't fight with the flavor of the wine and mushrooms. Also, I didn't bother with dredging the chops in flour. Thanks for sharing!

I used pork chops with the bone and it was absolutely delicious. I can't use mozzarella cheese because of the lactose allergy, but I thru on some frozen peas and it was fantastic!

Delish...I didn't have any Sherry, so I used white wine.  I think the Sherry makes a huge difference, but wine worked in a pinch.

Wow did this turn out great! It is definitely a keeper. I had some leftover crown roast and was looking for ways to heat it up and this was perfect.  I did a quick brown on the chops on high heat maybe 2 minutes a side to get the refrigerator chill off and make some drippings. I removed the chops and put them in the baking dish.  To the pan I added 8 oz. of crimini and 4 oz of shitake mushrooms and pretty much  followed the directions. As noted by others I did de-glaze the pan with the sherry before adding the mushroom soup. I cut back the cooking time to about 25 minutes since the chops were already cooked.  I baked them to an internal temp of 142 F and let them rest for about 5 minutes after removal from the oven.  Temp rose to a perfect 145 F. The chops were not dried out and the mushroom sauce was outstanding.

Great pork chop recipe.  I made it for a dinner with my sister and she liked it so much she ended up eating too much!  I used bone in pork chops with no problems.  I did sprinkle garlic powder over the pork chops along with the salt and pepper before browning, and also sauteed some chopped onion (as others suggested) in a little butter then added them to the sauce.  Like others, I'm not crazy about creamed canned soups or store bought cooking sherry, but surprisingly they both worked great in this recipe.  No complaints from me or my sister concerning those two things.  Give this recipe a try.  I think you'll be happy with it.

I did not fry the chops; rather, I have a grill pan that I cooked them on on the stovetop. Overall, I was really impressed with the taste and surprised that just three ingredients: cream of mushroom soup, sherry, and fresh mushrooms created such a tasty gravy (great served with rice or mashed potatoes). This was a great weeknight menu hack. Took just minutes to prepare and then a short bake time. The only downside is the sodium levels in canned soup.

It is a simple meal without anything outstanding. The pork chops were still a bit tough and the flavor is cream of mushroom soup.

Like many, pork chops were dry.  I will reduce the temp to 300 and time to 10 min next time.  I also added another 1/2 Sherry at the end to thin the gravy.  I served with egg noodles.  My family really liked it.  I will make this again.

It was just okay to me. The mushroom gravy was too thick and didn't have a lot of flavor when made as is.

Yes.  I would reduce the Sherry to 1/4 cup because with 1/2 it was a little too much.  Also buy the Cream of Mushroom reduced sodium because too salty using regular one.  My husband  liked it the pork chops turned out too hard to chew cooking them 35 minutes in oven.

This is such a delicious recipe.  I added about 1/8 cup of half and half because I wanted it to be creamy.  It tastes just as good the second day for leftovers.  Excellent recipe.

I loved the flavors and how easy it was to make. I would reduce the cooking time in the oven. The chops don’t need to be well done. Maybe 15-20 minutes instead of 35. Would definitely make this again! Served with mashed cauliflower and roasted broccoli!! Yum

The sauce was yummy!  The only change I made was to add about 2/3 of an onion, diced, and a large clove of garlic, diced, when sautéing the mushrooms. I think it would have been very bland without this.

I made the sauce  with golden mushroom soup instead of the cream soup . It had a more appealing look to it, the sherry was a fantastic finish as well. Chops were tender, smothered in the sauce. They were delicious.

browned thick chops for 5 minutes on each side, don't  forget to add water to the condensed soup.. I also added a little bacon grease and maybe 2 tablespoons of the flour leftover from where I coated the chops, to the mushroom sherry slurry for more gravy. baked for an hour with tinfoil on. did not add cheese, did throw on a little lemon pepper while baking.. THIS WAS GREAT!  WILL BE FIXING AGAIN.

The only thing I added is that I also seasoned the chops with garlic powder.  I also used real sherry not supermarket sherry.  After taking them out of the oven I let them rest covered for 10 minutes.  The chops were tender and it was very flavorful!

Ok I added some onion and used some leftover red 'cooking' wine.  The results were phenomenal regardless. Flavorful, moist, simply delicious. Wife's already recommending we make this for a large crowd of company.

Good weeknight recipe (yes, even with COM soup).  I didn't add the cheese to the recipe to trim back a couple calories and I thought it was just fine that way.

Made this tonight it was wonderful! Not usually a fan of pork chops but this was delish! I did cut back a little on the cooking time (by about eight minutes as I only had two pork chops and they were a little shy of an inch thick. I only fried them about three minutes and also cut back on the salt. Skipped the cheese and served it with broccoli and mashed potatoes. Going to try the mushroom/sherry gravy over chicken breast too.

This was a hit for Sunday dinner, not to complicated or time consuming for a Sunday. Flavorful sides was fried cabbage and brown rice

I seared the chop for one minute each side. Removed from pan and placed on a plate. Sautéed mushrooms and added soup and sherry. Returned chops to pan lowered heat and put parmigiana cheese on top of chops and covered the pan. Heated for ten minutes. Excellent!

Delicious! I used Italian bread crumbs instead of flour. Did not have cooking sherry, so I used white wine. A very tasty dish that I will be making again and again!

Really enjoyed this, but I thought the sherry was a bit strong. I used thin cut chops because that's what I had on hand but kept the rest of the ingredients the same because hubby and I like a lot of sauce. 

Overall this was very good, and I will make it again but cut back the sherry the bit.

I usually don't follow a recipe, I prefer to do it on my own once I've read the recipe. We loved how the chops turned out and I will make them again.

This recipe is an excellent start to an amazing dish!  I say this because it is open to minor tweaks and tips as some others reviewers suggestions.
*I used center-cut ¾ inch thick with bone-in, pan shearing them for only about 1 minute on both sides.  *Can of cream of celery (because this is what I already had) * I used ½ of fresh sliced mushrooms and added ½ of a medium sweet onion.  * I used the sherry as stated but also added ¼ cup of moscato wine (just because I had it in my hand and it tastes good!).  *I added mozzarella cheese to only half of the chops at the end only to realize that the mozzarella cheese is what brings all of the beautiful flavors together so nicely!!!  So unless you just don’t like cheese, DO NOT PASS on the mozzarella!!!  I serve this dish with homemade mashed potatoes and spinach, Yummy!!!

Served with rice.  The gravy was quite runny so the rice made an excellent accompaniment!  Next time I won't bake the chops as long (~25 min. would be good).

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly but next time I think I would also skip the flour and maybe even skip the cheese and double the sauce since I served it over noodles. I might also finish off in the slow cooker next time.

I ground a lot of rosemary and added that to the salt and pepper.  I usually use a lot of pepper with any pork I make (my grandfather used to say, "Pork calls for pepper.") 

A few notes:  the salt and pepper is probably just a sort of a point of departure because there are lots of seasonings that go with pork (besides pepper) also, I used 2 frying pans at once to cut my cooking time and that it is possible to prep the pork chops ahead in case there is a need to break up the cooking time.   (sorry if someone already said this)

I like this dish.  It will go in my regular repertoire.

I used pretty much the whole gravy/mushroom sauce on two pork chops instead of four.   But it would have been enough to cover four pork chops.
