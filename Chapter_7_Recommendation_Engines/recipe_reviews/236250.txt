I made this as a topping for French Toast for Sunday breakfast. This is quite sweet, even when using Granny Smith apples. I could probably get away with using half the amount of brown sugar next time. As is, there were no leftovers.

I wanted something to go with homemade cinnamon ice cream. This fit the bill! It is like apple pie without the crust  (perfect for company with gluten issues ) and didn't  have to turn on the oven. I used this recipe for inspiration -- 10 Granny Smith apples, 1/8 cup ghee (clarified butter), maple syrup, cinnamon, and apple pie spice to taste. 

This would also be great in oatmeal.

Amazingly good!  I was craving something sweet and we had a bunch of apples.  The only difference I did was add some coconut shavings.  It added an extra crunch and a hint of that flavor as well. Will make this again!

Simple, simple, simple!! Didn't change a thing and loved them. My fav part was I didn't have to peel the apples. Thanks for the easy recipe!

I butter fried a basic flour tortilla with cinnamon sugar and served the apples with natural vanilla ice cream.  I cooked the 8 apples for 14 min.

Easy and quick to make. Had all the ingredients on hand already. Kids and I loved it.  We eat it plain or mix in some oatmeal for a healthy breakfast. Yum!

Great way to fry apples. I use more cinnamon in place of the nutmeg. I use less sugar if my apples are sweet enough.

This recipe is delicious over ice cream with apple crumble or apple pie for those having problems with the sweetness and the consistency make a slurry with 1/4 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoons of flour and add after the apples have cooked for 15 minutes stir it in and cook them for 5 more minutes i also added a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon at the end

We needed something with apples to be a side with our pork chops. I came across this recipe and I was very pleased. I skipped the nutmeg simply because we didn't have any and added more cinnamon. I loved them and I can't wait to see how the family likes them when I serve them at dinner tonight

It was fast and easy.  The longest part was cutting the apples.  The family thought it was great and we will have it for Thanksgiving brunch.

I added this as a last minute side dish to our Sunday Family Dinner. It was so simple and delicious with Roasted Pork Loin, that even our most "picky" diner had seconds.  Skillet Apples with Cinnamon has quickly become a family favorite!

Gave it a 5 star but I would agree the butter to brown sugar ratio is off, I feel it should be equal portions but that is going to be a personal preference for anyone trying this recipe. 
I made this for overnight oats.  I only had 2 apples but wanted a good coating because I was using them for overnight oats so used 3 tbls butter and 3 tbls brown sugar, I also added a pinch of salt.

I love making this to add on pancakes, but I add walnuts to it. My husband likes to add vanilla ice cream, as well, for dessert.
