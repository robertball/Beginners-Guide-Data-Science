The idea of raw shallots didn't appeal to me, so I sauteed them briefly in the bacon fat. Aside from that I prepared these as the recipe directed with its interesting and different ingredients. Unfortunately, neither hubs nor I cared for the tang of the vinegar and would have much preferred this without.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit with all 16 people. Funny since the green veggie is usually overlooked on Thanksgiving!I made it in advance, re-heated and tossed w/ dressing & bacon crumbles right before serving. I added a few more pieces of bacon, to crumble on top. I'm sure I'll be making it again. Thanks!

Definitely has possibilities but was bitter - too much of a tang with the vinegar. I added a touch of sugar.

Simply DELICIOUS!  I doubled the bacon since we love bacon.  Did not have shallots on hand so I minced some onion and garlic and I cooked them in the bacon fat before adding them to the dressing.I would could back a bit on the mustard next time but that is only my preference.  Thanks submitter.

We are not fans of raw onions, but I thought the shallots would be ok.  It was still a little too much "onion" tasting for us - it overpowered the asparagus.  I'd rather just have plain steamed asparagus.

This was very good, kids ate it well.  I didn't quite think it rated a 5 though.  I might try it again in the future in case I did something wrong.

Made this as is, except I did add some salt and pepper to the dressing.  I thought it was fabulous and will make again.

We loved the tangy sauce with these green beans. I will definitely make this again. I may even make the sauce as a marinade for chicken!

This is SOOOO good and so easy! I brought this one year to Thanksgiving dinner and the family liked it so much that it has now become a permanent menu item for our Turkey dinner.

Worked out great for Thanksgiving, I blanched the green beans ahead and then just quickly saut√©ed them with the dressing to warm them up again at dinner time. Everyone loved them, even my hubby who normally avoids green beans.

I made this a 2nd time before reviewing it as my husband and I were both on the fence.  Same thoughts as the first time.  The vinegar was a little too intense for our taste which is odd as we like the bite that different vinegar types give.  IF we decide to have this again, I may try dropping the white wine vinegar amount by half and adding a little white sugar, maybe add some soy sauce OR possibly try it with the sweeter balsamic vinegar  instead of the white wine.  It is just missing something we cannot put our finger on.   We do taste a lot of potential with this dish though.

It was good. I made a few changes though.

I added fresh ground pepper, a little ground mustard about 2 tsp of sugar (too tangy for me), I used vidalia onions, a little of dried Italian herbs, fired tarragon, fired parsley, 1/2 tsp of salt and about 1 tsp of red pepper flakes.
