This is very close to the one I've been making for over 30 years from my mother's old Tupperware cookbook. The only difference is the Tupperware recipe adds 1/2 teaspoon of salt and uses 1/2 cup cocoa powder instead of 1/4 cup, giving it a rich chocolate taste. I use Kraft Light Mayo, and it works well in this recipe, yet saves me half the fat and calories of regular mayo. I saved ynathan85's recipe with my revisions so I can put all my favorite recipes in one book and finally get rid of all the cookbooks!

My mother used to make this cake all of the time. It's such an easy recipe, yet I cannot remember it! It made me extremely happy to find it here, as my mother passed away a few years ago and I can't just call her up and ask her how to make it! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

This is a form of the original Waldorf Astoria cake. Better when baked in a 9x9 brownie pan.For a richer chocolate use 1/2 cup cocoa powder. Top with vanilla ice cream or real whipped cream.

I grew up on this cake!!! It is the most moist cake I have found!  A lot of people still have not had this type a cake yet.  It is better if recipe is doubled.

This is a childhood memory cake...was looking for the recipe.  But the 1/2 cup of cocoa is a must for this recipe, to give it the childhood taste.  Thank you very much for this recipe!!!!  :)))))

This chocolate cake reminds me of a cake my SIL used make years ago. It was good and chocolately. I used Wedding Cake Frosting and tinted Neon Green and Navy Blue, Seattle Seahawks colors.

I made this to take to my brother and sisiter in law's house.  We all loved it including my husband and mother.  I put my homemade butter frosting on it.  It was so easy to make and didn't take long to prepare it.  I will make it again.

Right out of the oven this cake has a gummy texture and bland flavor.  As it sits the cake gets much better and it becomes a moist, yummy cake. I also feel it needed more cocoa.

I used a 9 by 9 pan for the entire recipe and it made an even 1 inch layer.

This is a variation on the cake recipe passed down to me from my grandmother :-)  It really does make the best chocolate cakes, although I mostly use it for cupcakes :-)  It comes out so moist and fluffy!

I have been looking for this recipe.....it is so good...my mother made this all the time growing up..
She would use round pans and put pudding in the 
middle to make it more elegant like for special occasions..she would use chocolate pudding.Thanks
for sharing this recipe...I put about teaspoon of cinnamon in the batter to give it some kick as well.

I made this for the family Sunday dinner. The decision was unanimous.... never making this again! It was so dense and the taste of miracle whip was over-bearing! When I poured this in a 9x13 dish it could barely cover the bottom. So I put it in an 8x8 pan. The cake came out maybe 1" deep and so gooey. It seems like it's missing some ingredients. And unfortunately no one will want to try another version of  miracle whip cake ever. It didn't look at all like the picture. It was a pretty basic recipe so I don't think I could have done anything wrong...

This cake brings back many happy memories for me. My mom made this when I was growing up in the 60's and 70's, and it was so delicious!  But I think she put 1/2 cup cocoa in hers, so I'm going to do that too.  I'm so excited, I'm making it tomorrow.  I cant't wait!

Like many other people, this cake was popular at our house in the 60s. Tastes like coming home. Mom (and now I) always used Miracle Whip. Tried it with Miracle Whip Light once - don't! It was bad.

I have been making this recipe for over 55 years! It is my most requested chocolate cake recipe. Needs a dash of salt, and cold water works just fine.

Very simple, easy to stir up.  I was making a Cookies and Cream poke cake, and found that I had everything except a chocolate cake mix!  Quick look it up on Allrecipes..Found this one and tried it.  It worked great, I will use it again when I make that poke cake.  I used miracle whip light, too.  It wasn't a light and fluffy cake, but perfect for how I used it.

so easy and really delicious!  super moist and a nice "density" -- can handle frosting unlike some fluffier cakes i have made.  as recommended, i used 1/2 cup cocoa.  also added 1/2 bag mini chocolate chips.  everyone loved this cake.

Perhaps it didn't turn out well because I made it with Miracle Whip, Light rather than just plain Miracle Whip. It tasted chewy and underdone. I will not make this cake, again.

I did not like this cake.  The texture of the cake is hard to describe.  It was, another reviewer said "gummy" and the flavor was just okay.
