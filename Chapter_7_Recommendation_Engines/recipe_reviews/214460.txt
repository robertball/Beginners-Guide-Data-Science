Awesome little sliders. I had to improvise since I didn't have goat cheese or sun dried tomatoes, so I substituted jalapeno jack and roasted some canned diced tomatoes in the oven. I also added about a 1/4tsp of season salt. All in all really tasty.

Okay--I'm going to start out with: I didn't follow this recipe exactly. I don't really care for sun-dried tomatoes. But, I was looking for a "base" recipe to make turkey sliders, and this was perfect! I combined the ground turkey, garlic, panko, pepper and chili flakes. I made the patties and let them sit in the refrigerator for a few hours. Instead of cooking them in a pan, I threw them on the grill and basted them with a pomegranate-chipotle sauce. They were moist, flavorful and delicious! Going forward, this recipe is perfect to try different sauces, cheeses, etc. Thank you!

While these are tasty, quick, and moist, I must say we prefer the Trump/Oprah turkey burger better.  I think I'll try adding the goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes to that recipe.  Might see if I can post it on allrecipes.com so others can easily compare.  Thanks for sharing, Sonia! Bon Appetit! Sonja!!

Since making changes to our family's diet and eating healthier meat, we were excited to make this since we hadnt had a cheeseburger in 2 months! These taste fantastic! I did make one substitution since my husband hates onions, and that was to replace it with a small can of green chiles. Even the kids loved them!

Soooooo good! Of course I had to improvise as well. I used a mixture of cheddar and Monterey jack cheeses. I also used red wine instead of white and added some dried onions and garlic powder in lieu of fresh garlic. The preparation was awesome and I think whatever amendments you have to make you will have a successful dish!  Thanks to sonia for posting this!!!

I followed this as written except made full size patties. The burgers were super tender and juicy so I like the pan frying with the white wine, though on the grill might be a bit healthier. Now, here is why this recipe received less than 5 stars. The goat cheese is quite prevalent and I felt overpowered the burgers. I AM a goat cheese lover, but it was just too strong. My husband isn't a huge fan of goat cheese so he didn't care for them. This is a great recipe otherwise, and next time I think I'll just omit the cheese or substitute.
By the way, a HUGE pet peeve of mine is when someone makes a big change to the recipe and then gives it a low rating. (i.e. "I substituted brie." Well, of course it would taste bad, yuck!) Try this recipe and unless you love the strong goat cheese flavor, either cut it back, switch it out or omit it. :)

Can't say I am a fan of these. Although to be fair, I did substitute brie for goat cheese because it was what I had on hand and that could be why. I may try them again with goat cheese next time, but definitely don't use Brie!

These were great; only thing I did differently was bump up the spices a bit - 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  My batch made only 12 because I guess I made them a little bigger, but that was ok because I only had 12 rolls.  I found it helpful to rub some olive oil on my hands before making the patties, otherwise they stuck to my fingers.  Will definitely be making these again!

So, so good! This is by far the best turkey burger I've ever made. So moist- this is a great cooking method. I did make regular-sized patties, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I went ahead and doubled so we could freeze some for later. Will definitely make this again!

We've gone healthy in our house, so I substituted wheat flour.  Also used 'lite' bread crumbs. It was excellent & I think the hot pepper flakes gave it zing that the hubby loved.

When I made it last night, it didn't turn out too bad. I only made 8 patties and had 2 last night. I didn't know if the recipe called for crumbled goat cheese or have the actual goat cheese. Instead of hot chili flakes, I've used hot pepper flakes that added a kick to it. I've used slider buns than slicing dinner rolls.  But my patties did turn out like when I made regular turkey burger patties--it broke apart. Maybe it came out too big or something. But it was scrumptious to eat too. I would make it again.

Super tasty and I didn’t  have goat cheese or white wine on hand.  For half I added chopped up jalapeños to the mix and they were even tastier. Will make them again for sure.

My kids love these.  5 stars without hesitation. Make sure your oil is good and hot and you pack the patties as tight as possible   Makes enough  barely for 3 persons (inc life’s 2 kids who are picky eaters).

Loved these sliders so much they are now in my regular dinner rotation.  Very flavorful, tastes great with cheese and guacamole.  Made them as the recipe stated and they are wonderful.

The best turkey burger we've tried (of three or four). I would suggest making some sort of sauce (like a bernaise sauce would be good!) will make again.

Busy mom with a house full of little ones with picky taste buds.  This was a hit!  I didn't have white wine, so I used a red wine.  I topped with Swiss cheese and garnished.  They were fast and easy!  Perfect for a school night.

Awesome recipe!  The nutrition facts are way off though.  I used 93/7 groud turkey and calculated 152 calories per slider including the bun!  I only got 8 sliders out of the recipe, (maybe too thick?) so my sliders had 304 calories per slider, but I could'nt finish the second one!   My hubby had 2, and took 2 for lunch the next day.  Yummy!

My husband is allergic to dairy and swears he hates goat cheese, but loves this recipe. I used plain bread crumbs, garlic & chive goat cheese, red wine and chili pepper sauce because that is what I had on hand. Also, the sun-dried tomatoes I had were dry, so I mixed these up about an hour in advance so they could take in some of the moisture. They turned out great.

These were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, but made regular-sized burgers (only had regular rolls on hand).  These were moist and very full of flavor. The sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese give this burger a gourmet taste. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy. I couldn't find goat cheese so I used grated parmesan cheese. They were great as left overs too! I topped mine with Munster Cheese and avocado, so good.
