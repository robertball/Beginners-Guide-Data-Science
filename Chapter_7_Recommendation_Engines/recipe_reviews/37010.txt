Where I am from we call this Texas Caviar and Yankees don't like it as much as Southerners do!  I sometimes slice a baguette and bake at 350 for 6-8 minutes to "scoop up" the caviar. I usually make it 3 days ahead.  This is a fabulous dish that can really be served at any kind of party.

Abolutely wonderful.  Tasty, attractive in its own way..My guests loved it over the Holidays.  And the flavors only get better with time.  Some chopping so parents may want to help younger kids make it.

I really didnt like this too much. It was rather dry, maybe with a different type of bean it could have been better? The black black eyed peas came canned in this pink slim, which after I rinsed didnt smell to good. I would not make this again.

I served this as a Christmas appetizer & everyone loved it. My grandmother even asked me for the recipe.. isn't it supposed to be the other way around? =)
I changed it a little bit though. I didn't put in any fresh peppers because I don't like them. I added 1 diced tomato & freshly squeezed lemon juice. Instead of pita chips I cut fresh pita bread into triangles.
It was a hit!

I really loved this recipe as did all my guests at our christmas party. I like everyone else had to make a few minor changes, I added corn and chopped fresh jalapenos (here in San Antonio we add chilies to everything),and served with corn chips.  I have seen similar recipes called cowboy caviar, but the spice combination in this recipe is wonderful. I will be serving this again next week for our bible study under the catagory of "heavy appitizer" and can hardly wait.

We LOVED this recipe!!! The flavor was great and I will be making it again and again.  The only thing I changed was to not add the green pepper and the vinegar.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I had to substitute Dijon mustard because i had no coarse grain mustard on hand and this worked well.  

I also added couscous to make it a bit of a more hefty sidedish which was a great addition!

Great - I got rave reviews.  I think adding an avocado and/or tomatoe would be a great addition.

This was wonderful!  I made it exactly like this except that I added 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar.  Made it even better.  I serve it on top of greens for a wonderful salad.  Also, I serve it with tortilla chips and pita chips.  It is really good just by itself.

This didn't go over too well at my party, but I think it's because several people mentioned they thought the black-eyed peas were beans.  If I made it again for a buffet, I think I'd label it with the ingredients.

Meh, this was rather bland. I think it would have been much better with some lime juice (which I didn't have). I won't make this again. Thanks anyway.
