Have no fear - there IS a lazy version of this recipe, which I just tested. I bought a can of chickpeas and a can of beets. I rinsed them both, then put the beets in the food processor. Next I sauteed the onion and garlic in a little olive oil until translucent. I went ahead and threw the chickpeas in with them, though this probably didn't make much of a difference. Then I poured the onion, chickpeas, and garlic into the food processor with the beets. I added the lemon juice and cumin and salt (I didn't add the tahini because i'm on a diet, but this would be the moment to add it), and then I blended them all together. I found this low-fat, 20-minute version of the recipe to be very tasty!

This was SO popular at work with some pita chips and vegetables to dip in it.  The only problem was finding the tahini (look in health food stores).  I used canned chickpeas/garbanzos instead of soaking fresh (bad me!) but it still tasted GREAT!  I did go ahead and boil them again with the onions, though.  Terrific recipe!

Although this loevely bright pink hummus is tasty, it is TIME consuming. If you have the time it is worth it, but dont fool yourself it will take a good hour and a half at least. I didnt need any of the reserve liquid, in-fact it was more moist than I am used to and I aded more tahini at the end. If you have a smaller sized food processor you might want to make it in batches or reduce the amount. We like our food spicy, so I tripled the cumin and garlic. Overall this was a great recipe and I will make it again. A good recipe to make on a Sunday afternoon, while I have other things to do around the house while the beets are boiling.

Once I had finished this recipe, I was very satisfied with the results, and so were my family members (none of whom are vegan or understand why I'm vegan).  Only one caveat: the hummus, although wonderful to eat and not too hard to make, takes a long time to make.  Be sure you have plenty of time before starting this recipe.

A good recipe for low-fat vegetarian cooking. I cut down on the oil to 2 tsp. I reduced the tahini a great deal and used fresh ground sesame instead.

My husband enjoys it a lot as part of his cholesterol-reducing lifestyle. Next time I make it, however, I will significantly cut the amount of cumin, as it overwhelms the flavour!

It does make a lot, and I froze half and thawed it later succesfully. It's quite spectacular as a dip for carrot sticks, cut bell peppers and blanched cauliflower!

Woa I just made this recipe and it had the coolest color ever!  A bright magenta and I've never cooked anything like it.  I have a favorite hummus recipe so I used some parsley and no cumin as i am not a fan.  I used canned beans and they worked fine. (I didn't need to boil them)  I halved basically the whole recipe but still used a whole can of beans and no juice from the beans or beets.

I still prefer regular hummus, but this one's an interesting change and a new way to use beets. I enjoyed the slight sweetness that the beets add. The colour is amazing (it would look great side by side with guacamole, or layered in a glass bowl with guacamole and regular hummus). With the garlic, tahini, lemon juice, cumin, and s&p, I just added to taste as I blended (start with a little and go up from there) to get the flavour I like. I might cut back the amounts by half next time, as this recipe makes A LOT if you're just making it for yourself! I wouldn't reccommend this to strict hummus traditionalists because of the sweetness and flavour difference the beets add, but for people who like to mix it up a little - give it a try!

My kids love this!  I put in sesame seeds instead of making the tahini first, and some of the seeds didn't get thoroughly ground up.  This makes delicious filling for stuffed celery!  It also tastes wonderful on Triscuits!

This came out awesome!  I put in a ton of garlic, 2 large beets, a 15 oz can of chick peas, cumin, lemon juice, and salt to taste.  It was the coolest color (hot pink / magenta) and had a really yummy beet taste.  Will definitly be making this again.

This hummus was on the sweet side due to the beet. I pressure cooked the beet and the soaked chickpeas together for 14 minutes, then blended with the other ingredients. This needs assertive spicing to offset the beet flavor and sweetness. This made alot of hummus even though I halved the chickpeas and beet quanities and nearly doubled the spices. This recipe is a very creative and fun way to serve hummus.

Too much tahini and I didn't love the combo of chickpeas and beets, they seemed to cancel each other out, the umami-ness of the chickpeas was overcome by the bitter earthiness of the beets.  
So, I made this as written (less tahini- I figured I could add more if it needed it)  and it was okay, definitely not as delicious as I hoped and I think using canned beets would really downgrade the flavor (I roasted the beets for this dish; wash beets, cover in foil and bake just like a potato for about 70 minutes, they keep well if you want to do this in advance).
So the next time I made this I left out the chickpeas, reduced the tahini by 1 1/2 Tbsp, same with the olive oil, I just used two Tbsp.  I also added a salt, almost a teaspoon of Kosher, and a generous sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little extra oomph.  The color was electric, I got so many comments on it and once people ate it they were glued to the bowl.  Definitely party worthy with some tweaking.

We were hoping it would be a nice way to use the beets we received in our co-op veggie basket.  We loaded it up with spices/flavors and it just smelled/tasted like cooked beets.

Excellent, beautiful recipe. Save yourself the time: Wrap the beets and onions (halved and drizzled in olive oil) in foil and bake at 350 for an hour or more until tender. When they're done, use drained and rinsed canned chickpeas (save the liquid to thin the recipe in case), throw it all together, and even though this will take a while, you won't be tied to the kitchen until blending time. Also, I prefer 1/3 cup tahini, but that's a matter of personal preference. For presentation, add some chopped parsley to the top - the greenery adds appeal.

Who'd-a-thunk-it?  Hot-pink hummus.  The flavor of the beets with lemon juice, tahini and cumin is just a real adventure in deliciousness.  It would have been easier if this recipe called for a certain number of cups of cooked beets.  Not sure if I had more than a pound and that's what made mine watery the first time I made it?  I found the texture better the second time when I left out the olive oil and decreased the beets slightly.

I used canned organic chickpeas & local chemical-free beets, just  pulled from the dirt. OMG, this is such a delicious lower calorie/healthy fat spread for cucumber slices & carrot sticks!!

This recipe was fabulous.  I don't normally like beets very much and I am addicted to hummous.  The color was striking.  It was easy to make and very nutritious.  I used what some said in other reviews and used a can of chick peas.  It worked well.  I did still boil them with the onions in order to soften the onions and seep them in the flavor.  Cans of chick peas are 15 ounces, which is almost double what the recipe says, so I doubled everything else.  When I make it again, I may try with 1-1.5 pounds of beets rather than the 2.  I made it for a party and had lots left over.  It seems to keep quite well, we've been eating for over a week.

A little earthy in flavour, but it might depend on the beets.  I think I'll roast them next time, to bring out some sweetness.  Otherwise, earthiness was overcome by adding a little sea salt & more lemon juice.  Nice recipe, thanks!

This recipe is a WOW -- impossibly purple, but the flavor of beet is not overpowering. My skeptical 13-year-old ate half the bowl, and then took the left-overs to school for lunch. I added a bit of salt, and think I would add more the next time I make this.

Great recipe!  Did as other reviews said... used a 2 beats boiled, peeled and chopped, 2 cans of chickpeas with some of the juice, sauteed onions and garlic and then added the chickpeas for a little then kept the rest basically the same with the other ingredients.  Turned out delicious!

Eh...basically this was hot pink bland hummus.  I couldn't really add too much to it because I didn't want spices to conflict with the sweetness of the beets.  This was an interesting experiment with beets, but not a keeper. FYI - to save time, I cooked the beets the day before and used one can of garbanzos. It needed extra cumin and lots of salt.

I love the pink color and the chance to use more beets in my cooking!  I used canned chickpeas and beets.  I only used half an onion, 1 clove of garlic, 1/3 cup tahini and 1/2 T of cumin, yet it was too potent for me.  The spices overpower the beets too much, imho.  I'm looking forward to trying it again with less spice.

What a great way to use beets! My 3 yr old thought it was pretty neat being red and ate it up with some crackers. Not enough time? I used one can of these beans, 1 lb. of pickled beets, 1 Tbsp. of onion powder (but I'd use 2 tsp. next time as it was too spicy), juice from one lemon was about 1/4 cup, and the rest was the same...but without the tahini. Tahini probably would have been good, but I didn't have any. It was fast using my VitaMix.

I made a double recipe of this as I had tons of beets to use up.  I wouldn't recommend doing this, not because it does not taste good but because I now have 5 containers of it!  Beautiful red/purple color and I do not find the beets taste strong at all.  Just add a sweetness to the hummus.  I roasted the garlic to add to the flavor and love the result although I would probably add more in the future as I love garlic and found the taste very mild with the amount recommended.  I also added another tbsp of cumin for personal preference.  Don't be scared off by all the steps, everything keeps well and I was able to make this recipe over three days.

This is now my go-to hummus recipe! I made this for a party and it got many raves from guests. The color is gorgeous, the taste if both bright and earthy. It has several steps but is easy overall, especially if the beets and chickpeas are made ahead of time. I made both in advance and froze them, and then when I was ready I thawed them and made the hummus. This was a huge help to cut down on prep time in the midst of other party cooking and preparations. I roasted the beets instead of boiling them (my preference for cooking beets)and added a bit extra garlic, but otherwise made the recipe as is.

Maybe it was scaling the recipe, but that shouldn't have an effect on the final taste.  I found the beets too sweet for a hummus-y use.  Or maybe it was the seasonings, traditional hummus flavors that didn't match well with the sweet beets, in my opinion.  I'll play with the leftovers - there are certainly enough of them!

Just delicious, and the color looks almost supernatural. I only used a tablespoon of olive oil, and instead of onion I threw in a few jalepeno peppers. I also used canned chick peas instead of dried, plus added some of the can juice. A tasty and unique hummus!

This tasted okay, but looked too odd for me to get over the pink coloring.  It also had a little too much liquid in it - it pooled on the top after sitting in the fridge for a day.  Not my favorite hummus recipe, but it was worth a shot!  Thanks for the recipe!

Not bad.  Some people were turned off by the bright color. I thought it had a bit too much garlic.  The second day the garlic was overpowering any other flavors.

I used a jar of pickled beets and I sauteed the onion, but otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe. It was a nice variation.

This recipe is easy and the beets make it so pretty!  I like my hummus thick so will skip the reserve liquid next time.  I added a serrano pepper for a little kick - my family loved it!
