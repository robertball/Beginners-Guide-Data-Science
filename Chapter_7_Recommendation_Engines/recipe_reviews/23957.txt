This was the best cheese ball I have eaten and everyone at our Thanksgiving table agreed, including ALL 12 children. No left overs here!!!

This had a good flavor but it was waaay too salty.  I guess that can't be helped, it's in the chipped beef and that's a main ingredient.  I thought it might be salty so I added more horseradish and some onion to try and cover it up.  People at the party loved it though - everyone wanted the recipe.  Go figure!

As written, I am only giving it 3 stars.  My recipe only calls for 1 ONE jar of chipped beef.  Sometimes, I also add a bit of chopped onion instead of horseradish.

A friend made this. It had a good flavor but the saltiness was a bit overwhelming. Came together very easy. I don't think I would make this myself but it again, is one of those dishes that would be perfect for certain types of gatherings.

This was great, I even left out the horseradish.  I didn't think it was too salty at all, however I thought the recipe calls for too much beef.  Overall, best cheeseball I have ever had. :)
