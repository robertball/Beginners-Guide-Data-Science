Perfect--I love this method of cooking asparagus, and thyme is a nice complement.

I made this last night and was very happy with the results.  I was disappointed that my grocery store was all of out fresh thyme, so I had to use dried and it was still good though I know would be better with the fresh.  I also added in the last five minutes of cooking a sprinkling of shredded parmesan cheese.  Very Tasty!

A great alternative to steaming.  I'm just learning to cook, and this was quick, simple and a fussy friend said that she doesn't like asparagus, but she likes mine!

I love this recipe.  Using fresh thyme just makes it.  I like to put a squeeze of fresh lemon juice over it too and I sometimes dust with coarse grated parmesean cheese just before serving.

I've always loved asparagus, but have never been able to get my husband to eat it.  He loved this and went back for seconds.  Will definitely be using this one again.

This was simply wonderful! I have a lemon thyme plant, and the flavor was subtle, yet pronounced! Squeezed a Meyer lemon over top before serving -- the icing on the cake, so to speak! Did NOT use Parmesan,  as others suggested, because it's too strong an influence, and I didn't want to take away from the thyme. VERY classy flavor, and the olive oil makes it glisten.  Beautiful! Thanks!

Great & simple way to cook asparagus.  We enjoyed the flavors, but I would suggest using less oil for drizzling.

This is a really solid side dish. The flavor of the asparagus is embellished without extinguishing it. Preparation is a piece of cake. I will probably try this with balsamic vinegar at some point, which would probably be delicious.

Simple & delicious! For something a little different, add some chopped leeks. As suggested by other users, adding a squeeze fresh lemon juice is a must!

We did not like this one.  The time was perfect, but the thyme was WAY overpowering.  I'll use far less if I make this again and maybe even dried.

Very good and very easy.  Made this for Easter dinner and everyone was very impressed - they had no idea how easy it was because it tasted soooo good.  Best asparagus I have ever had.

This was absolutely fantastic.  I used about one pound of asparagus and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly.  Roasted for 5 minutes, added some parm, and roasted for another 5 minutes.  I ate the entire thing in one sitting!

I just bought more asparagus and fresh thyme, so I'm about to go try this with some leftover goat cheese crumbled on top once it's done.

We loved this! The thyme really brought out good flavor.  I roasted about 10 minutes as we like ours a little crunchy.  I was going to squeeze a fresh lemon over the asparagus but then I forgot to.  I guess we'll just have to have this again so I can try that!  Very good - we will have this again!
