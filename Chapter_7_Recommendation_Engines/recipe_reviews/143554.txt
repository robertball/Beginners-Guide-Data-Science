I was struggling for some appetizer or dip idea for a party I was headed to, and stumbled upon this glorious little recipe. I followed the recipe instructions, but found myself having difficulty visualizing the little cheese balls just hanging out and being eaten at a bbq, so I basically dumped all of the cheese into the bowl and made one large cheese ball. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I drizzled the rosemary honey on top (and reapplied throughout the evening as needed), and everybody was blown away. People were literally standing in awe in front of the bowl - that's how good it was.

As far as pecans go, I somehow found these Emerald Nuts Pecan Pie glazed pecans, and I think the extra sweetness pushed this recipe over the edge from yummy to go away this bowl is mine get your own. EVERYBODY loved it. I've committed this to memory and will definitely be making it again, probably even better around the holidays.

Wonderful!! I will be making these often for guests. They were so easy to make. The flavors meld perfectly together. If you like goat cheese, you'll love this recipe. Definitely a keeper.

i liked this as an appetizer :) however, i also tried it as a meal. i boiled up some boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut them in half, put a few of these cheese balls (according to the recipe) inside the halves. then i stuck the chicken in a pan , whipped up some cream of mushroom soup, and when the cheese in the chicken was melted a bit, i served the chicken with some soup on top.  My husband and i loved it! something about these appetizers made a perfect stuffing...and a quick meal too! only took about 45 minutes total to do everything, muti-tasking of course :)

I've been making this for several years now. I just buy the goat cheese "logs", open the package, drizzle honey and nuts on top, add a dash of nutmeg and serve with fruit and/or crackers. It's delish and presents beautifully.

YUM!  (and oh so easy)!  Used almonds instead of pecans, and next time would make the patties a little smaller.

Yum yum! Very simple recipe with wonderful blend of flavors. I served with sliced green apples, pears, baguette and crackers. My favorite was apples and pears. Almost like a dessert but works well as appetizer as well. Beautiful presentation.

These were amazing and so easy.  I frequently don't try new recipes unless they already have hundreds of favorable reviews, but I was intrigued by this combination.  They were super easy - I put them together minutes before our dinner guests arrived.  So glad I did!  I didn't get around to putting the rosemary on top and I still thought it earned 5 stars.  I put 6 on a small serving plate and drizzled honey across the plate for a nice presentation.  Great as an appetizer or an exotic, light dessert.

I cut back on the honey because I thought it would be too sweet. Big mistake! I will make these again because they are different and delicious. I will definitely use all the honey as directed.

Mmmmm! My husband and I are huuuge goat cheese lovers, and this was absolutely delicious! We don't like pecans but I used the basic idea and used our favorite pine nuts instead, finely ground in the food processor. Wow! We greatly enjoyed these and will definitely be making them again! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this into a spread just by softening the cheese and mixing everything together with the back of a spoon. Delish! The combination of flavors was great. Oh, I didn't have pecans on hand so I used almonds, and toasted them first -- they add a nice texture and nuttiness to the whole thing. Easy & yummy, 5 stars.

I used all the same ingredients but instead of making individual patties, layered it on a plate and served it with olive oil and sea salt crackers. Wonderful!

Amazing and so easy! Followed the recipe closely, fresh rosemary, and made the balls bite-size to fit on a cracker. Tried with many different crackers and sliced, toasted baguette, but best in my opinion were the rosemary Triscuits that have a little salt and rosemary to them.

Excellent! I wanted to get a quick idea of the taste of the recipe so I simply spread some goat cheese on crackers and sprinkled the ingredients over the cheese. The taste was wonderful and the ingredients balanced each other out beautifully. I will definitely follow the recipe for a better presentation for guests! However, this quick "taste test" shows how simple, forgiving and versatile this recipe really is.

I didn't measure anything, used honey chevre from Trader Joe's, rolled in pecans I had crushed in the food processor with the cinnamon, drizzled with honey and crushed some dried rosemary in the palm of my hand before sprinkling on top. Really cute and yummy stuff. Thanks!

YUMMY! I made these for a baby shower and they were a huge hit!! Everyone wanted the recipe.  I made 1 inch balls and smaller and arranged them in a (pretty) pile on a plate.  Some guest ate the whole ball while others spread them on crackers or fruit.

I forwarded this recipe to my son for his housewarming party and they disappeared! The only change he made was that he used crushed pistachio instead of pecans. He made 3 balls which were ravaged. Excellent recipe and TY!! Pairs well with several wines.

I made this for my bridge group. It was not wel received. The only thing I did different was use cinnamon honey becauset that was all I had. Also, I did not make patties. I kept them in balls and stuck a toothpick in each for easier handling.

I loved this!  Of course I love goat cheese in general. I kept the goat cheese in its log form and just rolled it in the other ingredients. Drizzled the honey on top and served with crackers. It presented well. Served at a family get together and it was a hit. Very easy appetizer!

I love goat cheese and this is a delicious and easy way to enjoy it. I made one large cheese ball versus 12 individual ones and served with Trader Joe's Golden Round Crackers. Perfection!

Made this for a get together with friends.  Everyone seemed to like it!  I just made it according to the recipe but I did use candied pecans like one reviewer suggested and served it with those little toast crackers.  It took a while to roll and coat the balls, but I think you get more flavor in each serving that way!

So simple to make this complex flavored bite!  Didn't make any changes and loved it! It doesn't need a cracker, just pop 'me in your mouth and enjoy. I put three bites on top of a plain lettuce salad with raspberry vinegarette dressing and the salad became the best part of the meal! Will be making these more often!

Super simple yet elegant appetizer. Be sure to bring the goat cheese to room temperature though. I added some crushed almonds to the goat cheese before drizzling the honey. You can also just throw everything into the food processor and use it as a bagel spread!

yummy!  Rolled goat cheese log into cinnamon and pecans mixture. Pecans didn't stick well, seemed that cinnamon prevented that? Try pecans first then sprinkle with cinnamon? Drizzled honey over and sprinkled on rosemary. Served with green apple slices and crackers.

This is OUTSTANDING!  It was gobbled up at a neighborhood women wine gathering.  Plus, it's so easy.  Don't forget the fresh Rosemary, it makes the dish.  Highly recommend...thanks, Raelee!

I prepared appetizer for the first time and our friends loved it!  The drizzle of honey added just the right flavor to the dish.  It went perfectly with the flatbread wheat thin crackers... and wine!  Wow, this was great!  I will serve this again and again!  Thank you.

Has anybody tried to heat this up?  I love warm goat cheese and am wondering if it might be good that way on a chilly night.

very good, I had company and everybody was impressed. I had to change the nuts part, as I have an allergic person. But I used sesame seeds and it was a good solution. Everybody raved about the mixing of flavours and the delicate taste. Will repeat surely!

I deconstructed this recipe and made it into a salad by adding romaine, dried cherries and balsamic vinaigrette! I also subbed toasted almonds for pecans. It was awesome!

Cloyingly sweet, the combination of cinnamon and goat cheese was unpalatable.

I thought this was very good, but some people didn't like the goat cheese.  It is just a matter of taste!

Made these for a holiday party. They are pretty "sharp and tangy" so keep them small.
