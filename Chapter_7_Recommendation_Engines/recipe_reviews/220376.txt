Two things that are important to the end result:  use canned milk; and follow the directions for the milk/egg mixture: For some who may not know, it is mandatory to add a little of the heated milk to the beaten eggs as described to 'condition' the eggs to the hotter temperature.  If you just 'dump' the cold eggs into the hot mixture, the yolks will cook, and you will have a mess. Stir constantly as milk has a tendency to scald if the temperature is too hot.  Once the mixture begins to form tiny bubbles around the edges in the pot, it is simmering. Do not boil.  continue to stir constantly and, if necessary, remove from heat and lower temperature.  When the milk/egg mixture coats the spoon, you are  ready to proceed to the next step, in my opinion. And, if you don't understand the term 'coating the spoon' it means that when you take the spoon from the pot, a coating of the mixture should remain on the spoon. You don't want the sauce to be thick - it will reduce/thicken as it bakes in the oven.  This is my go-to mac n cheese recipe henceforth.  I had been looking for a recipe that incorporated eggs, and I found perfection in this recipe--at least for my taste. Absolutely the best mac n cheese I have ever made.  Thanks to dameionec for shartin!

Just like what Grandma used to make!  If the other reviewer had lumpy sauce they didn't culture the eggs as instructed 1 Tablespoon at a time.  I have been looking for a Mac n Cheese recipe like my Grandmother made and this is as close as I remember.  Thanks for sharing!

I am not an expert chef, but I enjoy cooking, watch a LOT of "Food Network" and consider myself a fairly knowledgeable cook, but I made a startling discovery when making this recipe that I felt I should share. To the purists- I always read the reviews first and adjust accordingly. I reduced the pepper to 1.5 tsp. - I only used 2 eggs, and I added 2 tsp of sugar. After carefully following the directions for the roux, I then added the cheese into the sauce so that it was all melted together in a yummy sauce, then added the pasta, stirred, and moved over into the 9x13 baking dish. The pasta was absolutely swimming in the sauce. I clearly did not have enough. I went back and cooked 2 more cups of the pasta, added it, then baked. It was delicious. But what the heck was the problem with the amount of pasta? I assumed the problem to be the fact that I substituted "mini farfalle (bowties) in place of the elbow mac. I then ran a search and LO AND BEHOLD – I found a pasta conversion chart! WHAT? I can't believe I've never seen or heard anything about the need to make adjustments based on a pasta substitution.

This was fantastic! I used the dish it called for, but in doing so, was unable to make all of the layers! I topped with just a little bit of bread crumbs and it was amazing, even microwaved the second time! I think next time I will use an 8 inch square pan instead! Oh, and just a little heads up, even on heat setting three, it took a little while for it to start to thicken up, but hang in there, it's totally worth it!!

All is well and good but try topping this dish with some toasted buttered bread crumbs. 

Before baking the dish, simply melt about a table spoon + of butter in a small frying pan, 

Add about a cup of regular bread crumbs and lightly brown (toast)the bread crumbs. 

Spread or sprinkle the toasted bread crumbs on top of the casserole and bake as directed.  

A simple step but it does add another layer of flavor and texture to the dish.

Taste great but more work than is needed in MHO. My family recipe is very much the same, but instead of all that work, you just cook the noodles al dente, then layer with: first a little cheese, then noodles, salt,pepper, pats butter, layer of  cheese. Continue layering until at the top of the dish. Wisk the eggs with the milk, then pour over the entire top. (Depending on depth of dish, may not have enough liquid,but then just mix up more eggs and milk. Liquid should be showing about 3/4 inch below surface of cheese/noodles. Bake and enjoy! This has been a family recipe for years, and so delicious and easy! (I actually have been substituting skim milk, and also evaporated skim milk, and works just as well. Regular skim milk just needs to cook a little longer until bubbling and can tell it is finished when center, when pulled aside by a fork, is not "milk" consistency but rather looks like half-cooked scrambled eggs).

I would give this a 5 starminus the eggs. I'm from the south and use velveta cheese in replacement of the eggs I boil the velveta with milk in a sauce pan until its thick creamy. Than I pour the sauce over the half cooked macaroni be careful not to fully cook the shells. its going in the oven and will be overcooked. I like monteray jack and mexican cheese with this recipe. or if your not a yellow cheese person try this recipe with the 5 white cheeses of your choice makes a whole of difference.

Finally back to review this one mainly because I am making it again and making some changes. My family loved the original recipe. This time I changed the cheese a little by using two cups of real cheddar and two cups of velvetta. At the end I added a bit of shredded colby jack and bread crumbs to the top. Mmmmm

The BEST mac-n-cheese recipe I have made so far, and easy!!!!
Here are the modifications I made and it turned out perfect:
- used one teaspoon of pepper instead of 1 tablespoon
- used more cheese (8 ounces of cheddar, 16 ounces of sharp cheddar-- I saved about 1 cup of the sharp cheddar until the end to sprinkle on top of the whole dish
- added cubes of smoked ham YUUMMY FLAVOR!
- I didn't do the layering in the pan, I just mixed all the ingredients into the big pot with the egg/milk mixture
- I didn't use regular salt, I just sprinkled Lawry's seasoning salt after all the ingredients were mixed in the big pot, to taste, right before I poured it all into the baking pan
-I had to cook about 25-30 minutes in my oven

My family really enjoyed it!!!

My family is from the deep south - many generations so good southern cooking is something we take pride in.  Thinking maybe I should change things up a bit, I made this recipe exctly as stated.  I think the black pepper was WAY too much and ovrewhelming.  The eggs made an odd consistency to the dish.  Will not make this or recommend it to others. Sorry

I thought this was very good. My gauge is if the sauce is nice and creamy and this certainly was creamy. I did replace the cheddar with Velveeta as that is my comfort cheese for mac and cheese. I also added my cheese to the milk/butter mixture and just put it all in one large corning wear casserole and it fit perfectly. One reviewer commented that the eggs made the cheese sauce weird and lumpy. If you follow the instructions and add the egg a Tablespoon at a time, the eggs won't get lumpy.  It is time consuming so don't rush that step. This is a great recipe and goes well with ham. I brought it to a New Years Eve party where ham was the main dish and it was received very well.

I have made this recipe multiple times, adding my personal changes each time and it never disappoints.

To the people giving this bad ratings because of the consistency... You aren't doing it right, plain and simple.

Wow - really good.  Based on prior reviews, i only put in 1 tsp of pepper.  I also left out the paprika - mostly because I forgot it.  
Second time I made it, I ran out of cheddar, so I used half velveeta and half cheddar. I melted the velveata in the evap milk mixture.  then I just mixed everything together and dumped in the baking pan.  Much easier and just as good.

It's real good however I need an alternative to using eggs, at least for me.  My ladies can't eat eggs so they didn't enjoy it as much as I did.  Still great recipe.

I'm sharing my review only because it may help others to learn from my mistakes...  This was a big fat fail for me unfortunately. I'm just thankful I didn't prepare it for company.  I have always been curious about egg based mac and cheese and decided to give this a try.  I used 1 can of evaporated milk, and 1 can milk/cream mixture.  Mistake #1?  I used a mild cheddar cheese - maybe my cheese wasn't a very good melting cheese...Mistake #2?  My egg/butter mixture looked fine when I mixed in the macaroni, maybe just slightly lumpy. But once I layered and baked it it came out awful... not creamy or cheesy at all. The macaroni looked plain boiled pasta alongside chunks of ricotta cheese lumps. It was a sad waste of 4 cups of cheese.  I did follow the directions to temper the the egg mixture, really took my time with that, but I may have messed up waiting for it to thicken as I let it bubble for a minute while re-reading the recipe.  Mistake #3? Well all these mistakes resulted in a tray of unsalvageable pasta.  I am going back to my usual roux based macaroni and cheese. It seems more forgiving and always provides the creamy cheesy dish I'm looking for.

I made it the first time as described, but I had the weird egg mixture texture that some others referred to, even after tempering the eggs.  Also, I thought that there wasn't enough macaroni.  When I remade it, I increased the amount of macaroni to three and a half cups.  I mixed the butter (not melted) in with the strained hot macaroni.  While alternating the layers of the buttered macaroni and the cheese (ending with the cheese), I sprinkled the salt and pepper between each layer.  Then, I just mixed the egg and milk at room temperature and poured them together into the pan with the macaroni and cheese.  This turned out much better.

The recipe I've been looking for.... I added about a tsp Dijon and tsp garlic and tsp smoked paprika..... So addictive. Love the crispy cheese edges.

I thought this was very good. I made the mistake of pouring a little of liquid out ( I thought there was too much)... when I make again I will leave all the liquid as mine was a little dry.

Very good as is, the only thing I added was a few pinches of cayenne powder.  I also used pipe rigate pasta too.

I'm so glad I found this recipe. I'm sure it didn't need changed at all, but I did a little.
I followed other's ideas of reducing the pepper and used a couple different cheeses. I used sharp cheddar, pepper jack and a cheddar onion type cheese.  It came out delicious! The one thing I'll remember for next time though,  is to use a different pan. I used a lasagna pan, it wasn't a great idea. My  mac-n-cheese is flat LOL!

This is a tasty recipe but a huge kick from the black pepper. I tempered the eggs but still got the cottage cheese texture after baking. I'm looking for a creamy macaroni and cheese recipe.

I made this today.  LOVE IT... I bought smoked gruyere and vermont cheddar cheese.  I shredded them and followed the directions as written EXCEPT, I DIDN'T USE ANY PEPPER OR PAPRIKA. I did however use 1 reviews suggestion of browning up some breadcrumbs and topped it off with that.   This isn't the cheesy type of mac n cheese but that's alright with me.  The smoked gruyere was perfect.   Thanks for sharing!!!

This is my second time making this, last time I did not use egg, evaporated milk or paprika, I had used 2% milk, pepper jack cheese, cheddar cheese, and the other ingredients minus egg and paprika. It came out pretty great but this time I made with the exact ingredients minus the egg(NOT A FAN OF IT) I know it will come out tasting even better again.

I finally found the macaroni and cheese of my childhood!  My mother was from SC and she and all my aunts made this "macaroni and cheese."  I was totally befuddled when I went to college and they served macaroni and cheese with a cheese sauce.  I didn't like it then and still don't.  I made this exactly by the recipe with only two small changes.  I used whole milk instead of evaporated milk.  I also cooked it in a cast iron skillet just like my mother used to.  The end result was fantastic.  The skillet gave it the wonderful chewy crust I love.  I will be making this again and again. Maybe I'll add a little siracha next time.

I thought I'd try something different and tried this recipe. The custardy thickness of this dish was not well received by the family. We prefer a creamier sauced version.

As written, I would give this four stars.  With my changes, definitely 5!  Just melt some American cheese (or Velveeta or some other smooth melting cheese) into the mixture and then layer with the cheddar.  I had never made a sauce for macaroni this way before, and it is definitely the best.  If you add a little more liquid, this can also successfully be cooked in the crock pot!

I substituted 1 cup half and half with 1 cup of water in place of evaporated milk. Also used raw cheddar cheese because my system does better with that kind of cheese. Add basil, just because!

Turned out really good. But next time I will need a bigger dish. I couldn’t do 3 layers. And next time I need more cheese. Kids wants it more cheesy. Lol. But other than that they want it more often which is great. Thank you. It was a big hit.

If we want it to be a "main dish" we cook up some bacon and toss it in, delicious!

I'm from South Louisiana and this is my favorite childhood food. It is 99.9% what my Mom-ma Al would make every sunday. Only difference is she would add just a touch of sugar. Thank you for giving this dish back to me and my family. Every time I make it for a gathering, someone always says this is Mom-ma Al's recipe.... And the stories about her start up.... And all the memories just come back.

This was the most popular dish at my Thanksgiving. Everyone including myself loved it and it was all gone within minutes. I used a generous amount of cheese, more than called for, but other than that stuck to this recipe mostly and it was outstanding.

I doubled this recipe for a school function. Instead of layering everything I just stirred it all together in the milk/egg mixture and poured into two pans and baked. Turned out GREAT!

I’m no chef, in fact, I kinda suck at cooking!.. BUT I halved the recipe because we are 3. I did 2 eggs (called for 1 1/2) used Italian shredded cheese (bc I’m no fan of cheddar) and bread crumbs on top- came out pretty  good!

I had been looking for an old fashioned, easy to make Mac and cheese casserole and found it with this one. This turned out great!  I followed the directions exactly as written, but seemed to come up short for that last layer of noodles. It was delicious and would make again for sure!

Halved the recipe, followed directions exactly and read top reviews about tempering the egg in. I should have maybe mixed the cheese in with everything instead of layering? Nothing was Creamy after baking it. It was cooked noodles, scrambled eggs with a bit of cheese mixed in. The taste was fine. The consistency did not work out for me. I'm sure it might work out for others, but I'm going to stick to a flour roux recipe from now on.

This wasn’t the best Mac & Cheese I’ve ever had. Egg/milk mixture worked well but finished product was  still not as creamy as it should have been. Probably won’t make this again.

I smoked it at 250 degrees for an hour or so.  If I do that again, I will need to undercook the noodles quite a bit more. They were a bit mushy. Otherwise, it was good.

I used the advice given by UNCgal and Jackay. It turned out great! I can't be positive that I would have liked it as well without Jackay's modifications as I didn't try it the way that it was originally posted, but I'll definitely use this recipe again in the future.

I have made this twice and everybody in the house loves it.  I don't care for it because I have never been fond of mac and cheese, but if I am going to eat it, it needs to be baked.  I make it for two cutting everything in half but using two eggs.  Like I said, almost everybody loves it :)

This is the best baked mac & cheese I've made. The only thing I changed the 2nd time I made it, was put only 1 1/4  cans of the evaporated milk. Unless you LOVE the taste of it, I recommend you do the same because the two cans was just too over powering.

This was my first ever homemade mac n cheese, and it turned out perfectly. Grand slam! The side view has a quiche effect, and when cooled this dish can be cut into squares and transformed into small appetizers.

Made this three times now. Make sure you follow the directions with the egg EXACTLY as they are stated otherwise it just doesn't turn out very well (like my first attempt). The second attempt was amazing and everyone had 2nd servings. My third attempt I ventured out and added bacon to the recipe and it was even better. If you follow the recipe as its written you really can't lose.

I used 2 eggs, buttered bread crumbs on top and another cup of pasta.  Baked in a casserole dish the way my Mother used to...delicious!  I added a few more spices; onion and garlic powders.  This will probably be my go-to recipe from now on.

This tastes exactly like my late grandmother's mac and cheese recipe! I would just add a blend of sharp and extra sharp cheddar to give it that extra tang. I loved it, and I really appreciate that the nutritional values are there because good grief this stuff is not healthy, but it is so worth it every now and then!

I cut the black pepper to 1 teaspoon.  The top was dried out.  So, next time I'll cover the dish with foil.  Will make again with tweaks.

A perfectly good Mac & cheese to fall back on or use as a base to get creative with. Not AMAZING on its own, but the kids will love it and the adults will eat it. Simple on-hand ingredients. I used 1 teaspoon of pepper because I figured I could always add more after if necessary (though I didn’t) and doubled the pasta because after using the 2 cups called for, they were absolutely swimming. I skipped the layering and just put all the cheese into the sauce, then added the pasta and once mixed, poured it all into the casserole dish. I added toasted breadcrumb topping.  I am familiar with the concept of tempering eggs, so didn’t have any issues with scrambled bits or lumps. Easy, simple recipe.

This tasted just like my sister-in-law's southern macaroni and cheese pie! I made it as written the first time around. The only thing that I added the second time around was a teaspoon of onion powder and a tablespoon of prepared yellow mustard. I also reduced the black pepper as per the other cook's suggestions. Be sure to temper the eggs. This is a dish of delish!! Thanks for posting it! Oops! I almost forgot to say that I added 3/4 of a cup of crushed cheezits to the top with 1/2 of a cup of cheddar cheese before I baked it. This adds yummy crunch and flavor!

If you're looking for ooey gooey, heart stopping, artery clogging macaroni, this isn't it; however, it is a good macaroni recipe! Unlike others, i love the pepper! In fact I may use more next time, in addition to a little more cheese or I may cook it in a smaller casserole dish. Will make again!

It was a hit! I will be making this again for Christmas. The only thing I would do though is add different types of cheese (Italian 6 cheese blend) on the layers, and cheddar on top. I am also going to add bread crumbs or potato chips to the top for some extra crunch... but it was perfect.

It’s not a bad mac dish. I did the ‘unthinkable’ and added beef hotdogs to it as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner this year (which was Apple Cider Pot Roast). Not my favorite, but well enjoyed by everyone.

Very good! My family loved it. Only change I made was I only used black pepper to taste and not a tablespoon (which does seem like a lot). When I make this for an adult only group, I may add some red pepper flakes for a little kick.

4 stars as written. I made this as written the first time and it was really good. The next time I added 1 teaspoon of onion powder,  1 teaspoon of dry mustard and reduced the pepper to 1 teaspoon. I used extra sharp cheddar. I crush cheez-its (or Goldfish) and sprinkle them on top and dot with a tablespoon of butter before baking. 5 stars after the changes. Thank you for posting it! Another dish of delish!!

This is not even creamy...if this was at any church picnic I'd be out the door.

I make mine with regular milk and it's smooth and creamy.  This was chunky...i tried it twice thinking I missed or rushed something the first time.  Nope...just nasty.

This was a good recipe but I would use less pepper because it was very overwhelming with what the amount ingredients called for! I was also expecting something more creamos it was a little dry for me! I'll try to switch a couple things next time I make it and see from there!

This was the macaroni and cheese that finally pleased the whole family.  We are not fans of a lot of black pepper, so I just put in a few grinds from the peppermill.  I figured the salt from the salted butter and the cheese would be enough to flavor the dish, so  I did not salt the water for the macaroni, nor did I add salt to the sauce.  Instead of tempering the eggs in the warm sauce, I melted the butter, then added the room temperature canned milk and  refrigerator temperature beaten eggs all at once, stirring constantly as the sauce warmed, and turning off the flame when the sauce coated the spoon.  This method worked just fine, and there was no danger of the eggs curdling.  As was suggested in another rating, I added buttered breadcrumbs to the top before baking.  This is definitely worth repeating.

Second try--  Tore up 3 slices of day old bread into very small bits and stirred them around in melted butter/a little oil.  Placed the bread crumbs on top of the casserole before placing in the oven.  Nice final touch.

Add 3 cups of shredded cheese into evaporated milk mixture to melt.  Then add 1 cup shredded cheese in middle layer and  1 more cup on top.  Flavor was a little bland, suggest upping salt to 2 tsp and adding a butter crumb mixture to top.

I'm a northerner transplanted in the south and I received raving compliments from my southern friends on this macaroni pie. Several asked for the recipe. Thank you to UNCgal for the clarification of conditioning the eggs - that was a big help. Thank you dameionec for the delicious recipe!

I made this for thanksgiving 2016, but I used 2 cups of mild cheddar cheese, and 1 cup of Velveeta, 1 cup of monterary jack cheese, and also sprinkled a little sharp cheddar on the top with the other cheeses. This was definitely  the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had. Also the best side for our meal this year.  Make sure to follow the directions with the evaporated milk, butter, and eggs, and it will turn out perfect

All in all a very tasty mac pie, BUT I had to make some tweaks to the recipe. 2 cups of uncooked pasta is not nearly enough (it'll barely go half way up the baking dish). I used 3 1/2 cups and you can even go with 4 cups. There is a lot of liquid from the evaporated milk mixture so not to worry, it will still be nice and creamy. I also used only 1 teaspoon of pepper. 1 tbsp seemed too drastic and even with 1 teaspoon it was quite a lot. A very nice tip for Mac pies...melt butter in a pan and brown some breadcrumbs and use it as a topping before you bake it. Yum!

My son married a beautiful southern bell 13 years ago and one of the foods they served at the rehearsal was a southern mac and cheese. The affair was catered but they would not give out their recipe. I have looked all these years and never found anything comparable. I have found it! All I can say is if you make it as the recipe states it is just fantastic.

I followed the recipe except I mixed in velveeta cheese in with the milk, butter, and pepper. After I poured the sauce onto the shells I added a layer of Sharp Cheddar Cheese and then a layer of shells, sauce and sharp cheddar cheese again. I used crushed Ritz crackers to add to my cheddar topping.

This mac and cheese is insane! Total deliciousness! I did cut the butter in half and used half sharp and half velveeta and my last change was to add 1/2 cup sour cream absolutely sinful! It does seem like alot of liquid i did add a bit more pasta it turned out creamy and sooooo tasty!

OMG! This is the real deal!  I'm a Southern Girl and I know good mac and cheese when I eat it.  The only thing I did differently was use only 1 Tsp. black pepper and I crushed four saltine crackers in between each layer; used no paprika.  I used Cracker Barrel Sharp Cheddar cheese. This recipe is a keeper!

Am I the only one who found a TABLESPOON  of pepper way too much? I double checked the recipe on that one! It has got to be an error that no one has caught. I followed the recipe exactly and not only was it not edible due to the pepper overdose but I felt it was too dry. I like the the basic formula however the pepper needs to be cut down and a 3rd can of milk or Velveeta bumped up.

Love this recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I prefer to shred a block of cheese than buy a bag of shredded cheese- the quality is much better and so is the portion size. 

I had a previous recipe that incorporated evaporated milk and eggs- but not as in this recipe. In this recipe, the milk and eggs are prepared stove top. This recipe is MUCH better! I will double the recipe next time when I have another gathering!

This is so funny!  I've been cooking my mac & cheese exactly like this for many, many years!  It is absolutely perfect made just as is.  My son (who is now grown and married) requests it every time they are coming home for dinner.  Delicious!

Truly delicious.  Even better reheated next day.  I'll be passing this recipe on, but only for my REALLY good friends.

I followed this recipe exactly and was not a fan of the final product. The amount of butter made the final product too rich and greasy . I, like other reviewers found the texture odd and like ricotta cheese  and though I layered the cheese as specified it did not seem that after baking, that the cheese ever integrated with the milk and egg mixture  .  The final product was just not very tasty and nothing like traditional macaroni and cheese.

I have been looking for a good hearty mac and cheese recipe that everyone would enjoy and this was it. I was a little hesitant on it because of the layering and I wasn't sure how the cheesy the noodles would be but it turned out great. I made this for a last minute Christmas dinner and was surprised that there was nothing left after dinner. Definitely a keeper.

This was interesting. I happen to love regular macaroni and cheese, and had never heard of this style, with eggs and evaporated milk. I made it exactly as written. I wasn't sure if the macaroni should have been 2 cups by volume, or by weight, but I figured by volume, and it seemed to have been the right choice. I was a little hesitant about the differentness of this (for example, the evaporated milk turning into somewhat of a ricotta-like texture), and actually enjoyed the reheated leftovers more. I'm not sure whether the "layering" technique was necessary, though, as it pretty much all seemed to blend together. This was decent, but I'm not sure I'd make it again instead of a more conventional mac-and-cheese dish.

I followed the recipe as written except I added more cheese than called for. It turned out wonderful. The whole family enjoyed it and the left covers were still moist after microwaving the next day. Will make again and again for sure.

This is a very good macaroni and cheese dish. I added bread crumbs to the top which added a nice crunch. You do have to be careful to add the milk mixture slowly to the eggs so as not to cause lumps.

Two stars because I think this could have been great with one change - there is way too much black pepper.  Maybe it was supposed to be 1 teaspoon instead of a tablespoon?  As is, the pepper is very overwhelming and ruined the dish for me.  I will definitely make again and just use way less pepper because I think it was good other than that.  I also was not able to make four layers using the dish it specified but I just kind of mixed the cheese in and it came out nicely.
