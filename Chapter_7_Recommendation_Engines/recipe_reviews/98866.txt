This is a GREAT RECIPE!! I used a smoked Turkey leg - it was hard to pull the meat off, but I'm glad I did! This was a terrific recipe and the first time I cooked with fennel - yummy!!

Instead of dried cranberries, I used half a bag of frozen cranberries that I had leftover from last Thanksgiving.  It was terrific!  I'll definitely be making this again!

ABSOLUTELY YUMMY AND TOTALLY VEGANIZABLE!!   so I used a half lb of super firm tofu instead of turkey.    Everything else is exact...  Served with some soy sauce.    WOW.  I might try this over some thin savory crepes... yep... delicious recipe!!

LOVE this! We served it with biscuits but I think it would be good with noodles, maybe with some kind of sour cream sauce.

Good Recipe.  Not an all time favorite but good in a pinch and very easy to make.  I used real cranberries instead of dried.  I do think it is missing something but I can't think of what it would be.  I look forward to seeing what other reviewers add to make it their own.

This was too sweet.  Way, way too sweet.  I liked the flavors, but we just never did eat much of it. I gotta say - in our house - food is never thrown out.  It was weird.  I think that if I try this again, I would use chicken broth instead of the juice and instead of dried cranberries I would use fresh (or the fresh frozen I keep in the fridge.)  Like I say - the fennel, cabbage, turkey, cran flavors win - lets just not douse them in so much sugar, all right?

So good! Didn't have a bulb of fennel, so I used 5 stalks of celery. Also used fresh cranberries and didn't have the cranberry juice, so I used extra broth (homemade turkey broth). The fennel seeds went great with this. I will make this again!

Never seen a fennel before I got one in my veggie co-op basket and frankly didn't have high hopes.  This was awesome though!  I didn't have fennel seeds or cranberries of any sort so I added most of a can of cranberry sauce and a tablespoon of horseradish mustard and whipped it up with the broth.  Added a couple sliced carrots.  Used leftover rotisserie chicken.  Cooked covered the full hour and stirred in the middle.  Served over brown rice.  Yum!  My 2 year old even ate 3 bowls.

This is so delicious.  I didn't have fennel bulb so used double fennel seeds. Substituted smoked turkey sausage for the smoked chicken. Used cranapple juice but worked find. Great for one dish meal if you plan on two servings per person. Probably be even better when I add the fennel bulb but it's superb as it is.  We will be having this dish from now on.

This is a good recipe, and easy to veggietize. I added firm tofu instead of the turkey, and a bit more broth (because I had more and did not want to waste it), and it was wonderful. The cranberries are really a key part if it.

It was the first time I've ever used a fennel bulb and will do it many more times.  We liked the dish but i would not bake it uncovered for the last half hour.  It dried out the chicken. I used only a half cup broth and a cup juice, no oil, and I added seasoned salt which really brought out the flavor.

Wow, I would have NEVER thought of this recipe myself. Made this as directed except omitted the cranberry juice. Had a chicken carcass that I cooked up and used that meat and broth in the recipe as I didn't have the smoked turkey. Only had about  1 1/2 tsp fennel seed, but had a fresh bulb fennel sitting out in the garden. I had only about a pound of cabbage. I was out of rice but put it over whole oatmeal (as close as I could get to rice) and it was delicious!! What a pleasant surprise!! Thanks!!

I didn't really like this.  I like all the ingredients, love fennel, but honestly it's just missing something to bring it all together.  It tasted like each ingredient just simmered in a pot. After the first taste, I thought it needed some acid, so I added a splash of vinegar, which helped a bit.  I do wonder if it might be better with fresh cranberries, as others have suggested.  I used dried.

I ate a similar dish in a restaurant and was thrilled to find this just as delicious. I have never cooked with fennel before, but plan to find more recipes and use it regularly. I did not use the cranberry juice the recipe called for and did not find the dish lacking in any way.

Very exotic flavors...I've prepared it with chopped ham and with no meat at all and it was excellent.  I could not easily find fennel bulb so I just added another teaspoon of fennel seed.
