Husband loved this, I thought it was good too.  Used frozen cherries to make infusion.  It was very easy.

I liked this. A bit different. I didn't have cherry rum, so I added a tbsp. of grenadine. I like the lime, as it offsets the sweetness of the grenadine. Very nice. I used Captain's Tattoo Rum.
This is like nothing I've had before. I think I like it. It's potent, for sure.

Served them at a dinner party for 8 Saturday night! Everybody loved them! Only change I made was I did not infuse the cherries into rum and used a little extra rum... tossed scoops of washed, seeded and halved cherries into the blender with ice and rest of the ingredients and got wonderful frozen cherry daiquiris! Will definitely make again with fruits in season! Thanks for a terrific recipe...they kept the party going until dinner was served which was, by the way, peppered chicken breasts with cherry wine sauce!

Very good, made just as stated in recipe, except a little extra sugar (my preference).  Just sweet enough, fruity, tangy, delicious.

This was really good. I took Lovin' Life Foodie's advice and threw pitted cherries, rum, and lime juice into a blender with ice. I also subbed grenadine instead of sugar to give it more color, and garnished it with a freshly picked cherry.
