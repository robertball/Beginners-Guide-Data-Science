This salad was a surprise hit with my guys, I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry and only 1/4 of a Vidalia onion since a whole one seemed way too much, my husband recommended I also add in a chopped cucumber in addition to the avacado since it is so mild in flavor. I am not a fan of ranch anything, but this was really good, I would recommend it to anyone looking for something different from the usual mayo covered salads you find at cookouts.

To call this salad "the best" is a little ambitious, but it is good, and definitely worth making. I substituted only one of the avocados for a can of artichoke hearts to be a little more health conscious, and used Kraft's Light Done Right Ranch. hint: almost any light dressing loses a lot of its inherent ickiness if tossed in salad and not plopped on top.

Boy was this good. I regret not having an avocado.  But even without it the pasta salad was fantastic. I added some parmesan cheese and that gave it a nice flavor as well. I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this for a family function and people loved it!  They kept asking what was in it -- they could taste the avacado, but couldn't identify it.  It was really different and better than regular chicken salad.  (I added black olives too.)

We loved this pasta salad, but with a few changes.  We don't love ranch dressing, so I added some Franks Hot Sauce, pepper and celery salt to the  dressing and that tasted great.  I also added some garlic powder to the steak sauce so it wouldn't be as sweet. I used a little less onion because a whole one seemed like a lot. I think next time I will toss in a third chicken breast.  This is a very tasty recipe that I will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful recipe.  My Dad just went wild over it.  I used red onions (they're a lot stronger so I used far less than the recipe called for) because Vidalia Onions aren't in season. Although they were adequate in a pinch, I think the sweet onions would compliment the dish a little bit better. I also broiled the chicken rather than grilling it (b/c of the snow), which worked just fine.

This recipe is pretty good although it is VERY ranch dressing tasting.  I think I am going to add some other things to it next time as well, maybe some chopped carrots or green onions or something...seems like it was missing a certain flavor.

Good pasta salad!  I used four chicken breasts instead of two to make it "husband friendly," Ken's Lite Ranch Dressing, and substituted green bell pepper for the avocado.  Next time I will use a different kind of pasta.  The flavor of the chicken marinated in the steak sauce was very tasty.  Will be making again!

Sorry, but I did not like this recipe at all.  The A1 marinade didn't go well. The avacados made the salad kind of green and I think it is very bland. This salad was a waste of time and money. Besides my brother no one in my family liked it.

I LOVE this chicken salad recipe! I usually add just a touch of steak sauce to the ranch dressing (equaling the amount of dressing called for) to give it a little more "zip". I also don't worry too much if I'm missing the avocado on the day I make it, or sometimes I'll add another veggie in if I have it. I've added chopped green pepper which is really good. And I always add at least 1/2 cup of cubed cheese... mmm!

Avocado hint:  keep the pit in with the salad (don't serve it, of course), which will keep it from turning brown too quickly.  I also added some cooked crumbled bacon and artichokes I had on hand.  I used red onion instead of vidalia.  I also used 1/2 cup ranch dressing and 1/2 cup light mayo and mixed in a bit of dry ranch seasoning to give it a more creamy consistency.    Easy to customize - will use it again!

I had to modify this recipe a little because I thought the ranch dressing would be too much and that would be all you could taste. I added italian dressing and parmesan cheese instead. This was a great way to use some leftover, grilled chicken. YUM!

I think part of the reason that some people loved this recipe and others didn't was dependent on whether or not someone prefers their food heavily spiced or mild.  Personally, I like my food heavily spiced, and so I needed to add things to this recipe.  Celery salt, garlic, parsley, cucumber, crushed walnuts, freshly ground black pepper, shredded carrot, italian dressing, and a package of dry ramen noodles, crushed up and the dry seasoning packet that goes with it.  This makes the salad have a sharp flavor with a zingy aftertaste.

Very Disappointing is all I can say without being too rude. I will NEVER make this again. I followed the recipe except I substituted red onion for the vadalia because that is what my grocer had and I don't suggest trying that!! Maybe that was the problem, but I highly doubt it. I should have followed the others advice for changes to the recipe.

With some modifications I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't use any onions, I'm not a fan of the raw onion "crunch" in a salad. I also did the chicken Cajun style(3 breasts not 2), didn't marinate, but the spice added great body to the dish. I did throw a few dashes of hot sauce in as well(we like spice in my family!) I only used one avocado and diced it very small, I love them but they are very rich and I wanted the stars to be the pasta and chicken. And the bouillon cubs in the water for the pasta is grrreat! I loved that. Ok, maybe more than SOME modifications but it's a great base recipe to play around with, Thank you!

Oh man, this was excellent!!  Hubby really loved it!  The only things I changed was the noodles for ramen.  I cut them up after they were cooked so they wouldn't be too long, and the avacado I put in green peppers instead.  I'm bad at knowing which avacado is ripe and which isn't!  =)

This was wonderful!!  My girlfriend and I ate every last bite we took and our kids even chowed down the noodles and chicken pieces.  Instead of using two avocados, I added one and then diced a small cucumber.  Looking forward to the leftovers!

I love this salad and have made it several times.  I use Kraft Ranch as I like how creamy it is.  I use bowtie pasta and added sugar snap peas to it for crunch.  Great recipe!!!

I really enjoyed this.  I would defintely play around with it more the next time I made it.  Maybe add a bit more salt and possibly some black beans.  It was very good and satisfying.

The taste was great - but next time I will use half the onion and double the chicken breast halves.  My husband and brother both thought those were the only changes needed.  Maybe we got a whopper of a vidalia onion - that much onion was a little overpowering.

I used some leftover chicken, so didn't have the steak sauce marinade flavor, but this was a perfect summer dinner. I added some cauliflower, cut up in pretty small pieces, and some iceberg lettuce as well. My usually picky toddler ate everything!

This was really good - very "California" tasting.  My husband topped it with a low fat Balsamic Vinegar dressing - I used a Cucumber Ranch instead of a regular ranch.  We also used whole wheat pasta noodles and it still came out great - wasn't too "wheaty"

Excellent!!  I took it to work and it was devoured. It probably could use a little salt or possibly red wine vinegar.

BRAVO!
This is the BEST chicken pasta salad.  I increased the chicken breast to 3 and increased the noodles to a 16 oz. package.  What a Hit!
Made it for my Sunday evening Bible class and again for a going away potluck.  
I will do it over and over again!  Thank You!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I did make some modifications though...I used 1/2 the amount of ranch dressing and onions, added "Williams Food Co." Fajita Seasoning (best seasoning ever!!!! I add it to almost everything), used grape tomatos instead of cherry tomatos, and made sure I cut up the onion very fine.  This was even good the second and third day.  We will definitely make again.

I made this when my brother and his "girl" friend came over for lunch and served it with a focaccia bread. It was wonderful and the leftovers the next day were great too. It is well worth the effort I can't wait to make it again.

Loved it! A big hit at my last family gathering. I made the following changes: I marinated the chicken breasts using Kikkoman's Quick and Easy Garlic & Herb Marinade; I grilled the chicken on an indoor electrical grill (George Foreman grill); I used artichoke hearts instead of avocado; and I used Wishbone Just 2 Good Light Ranch dressing. The artichoke hearts and light ranch dressing really lowered the fat content, and yet everyone loved it. Oh, and unfortunately sweet onions were out of season, so I had to use red onion...I bet it's better with sweet onions. All the same, I'm making it again for another gathering only a week later. It's a score!

I took the advise of one of the other reviews and used artichoke hearts, because my husband doesn't like avocados.  It was great.  He told me this recipe is a "keeper".  I did add a little extra chicken to it so it could be used as a Supper Main Dish Salad!

I think this recipe is very good, but has way too much dressing for my taste.  I made it as-is, and the ranchy-ness gave it too much mayo taste, which covered up the other ingredients.  I will make this again, and either cut the ranch totally out and just have the steak sauce, or replace the ranch and steak sauce with some balsamic vinegar.

This was a wonderful recipe!! I made it as the directions said, but I cooked the chicken in a pan and I chilled the pasta for only 1 hour and it was great. I chopped the onions in a food prosseser, because who want chuncks of onions? It made a lot of salad, maybe 8 cups! You could taste every flavor. I loved the avacodo and ranch. I recommend this for large families. Delish!

The name says it all! It is simply the best pasta salad I have ever made and cannot wait to make it again. My only suggestion is add a little more than the 1 cup of ranch dressing, I found it a little dry so I added a bit more and it was just perfect. Also don't ommit the avocado or just use 1 instead of 2. If I could give this dish 10 stars I would!

I was a little skeptical at first.  I'm not a big 'RANCH' fan.  I made this for a bday celebration at work, for a friend who LOVES Ranch ANYTHING!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, the only thing I did different was add a chopped green bell pepper, as recommended to up the veggies.  The onion I had was pretty big, so I didn't use the whole onion, but it didn't matter.  THE SALAD IS EXCELLENT!  It definitely is a CROWD PLEASER.  I'm at work now, and it's not even 1pm and the salad has dissappeared!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will definitely make this again!

This recipes was great. I made a few changes. I used chicken base (the paste) instead of bouillon. I added olives, cucumbers, artichoke hearts, skipped the tomatoes and used the A1 Garlic flavored steak sauce. Instead of Ranch I used Cheddar and Parmesan Ranch and added more A1 to it before I mixed it in. The only thing I don't like about this recipe is that it is hard to leave alone. Better as it chills!

I haven't tried this with grilled chicken, but I used leftover diced chicken and marinated it in 1/4 c. of the steak sauce. I didn't have avocado, so substituted 4 chopped hard boiled eggs for creaminess; also added chopped celery and cucumber for a little more crunch. I also did not use bouillon cubes to cook the pasta -- if you are going to rinse it and drain it, it's a waste of broth -- just salt the water. The longer you refrigerate it, the better it gets. The steak sauce makes this different from your ordinary pasta salad -- thanks, Gail.

This salad was delicious!  I've made this sald before and it was just a bit too bland for my husband and I, so this time I did modify it a bit.  I added shredded cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and celery salt.  Came out GREAT!

I made this first for a Bridal Shower for my sister-in-law.  I made a few changes, based on my tastes.  We don't generally have Vidalia Onions here, so I used red onions, they are pretty and flavorful!  I added some green peas, for color.  Instead of some Ranch salad dressing, I made a "thinned out" ranch dip, with sour cream and ranch dressing powerder with some milk added to it.  I thought it added more flavor punch!  I also splashed some A1 sauce in the salad as I mixed it up.  I couldn't find fusilli pasta so used farfalla (bow tie), this of course didn't change the taste, however it has stuck, and this is what I use now, it is so pretty!  Also I used more boullion when boiling the noodles, it gave them a richer chicken flavor.  A also add shredded cheddar cheese to it, which really adds some flavor punch.

My family loves this salad, and it is a favorite during the warm summer months, when we like to eat more salads!

I teach high school family and consumer sciences. My students made this recipe for arts and crafts judges at the local youth fair. They recieved rave reviews for the salad they prepared and the preparation was easy. We used a "Foreman" grill instead of charcoal.

This was OK, but not 5 star.  I think the ranch taste was a bit over-powering.  Next time I will try it with maybe a caesar dressing and will add cucumber for extra crunch?

I wouldn't call this the best, but it is good.  I didn't have avocado, so I used cucumber in its place, grape tomatoes, peppercorn ranch dressing for a bit more zip, and added chunks of mozzarella cheese as well.  Oh, I also threw some salt and pepper in the finished product!

We don't like tomatoes so I didn't add any.  I used flowers pasta and just enough ranch to make it creamy.  This is excellent. The flavor is addictive.

A delicous noodle salad. This recipe
was good to have in the fridge for a quick
lunch or snack. I keep the dressing off
so u could add as much dressing as u wanted 
at a serving, it worked good.

I tried this on our first warm day because I didn't feel like cooking too much and it was great!!!
It makes a lot for leftovers and has a lot of healthy veggies (that are really easy to chop)
My whole family loved it and I plan on making it often. Thanks to Gail..

This recipe is in my summer rotation.  I grill the chicken earlier in the week when I'm cooking for another meal, so it is quick and easy to throw together at the last minute.  The A1 gives the chicken a different taste, not the "same old, same old".  I do use less dressing. There are never any leftovers.  This is a nice change of pace when you are tired of all your other summer chicken recipes.

This recipe was OK, but it lacked much needed flavor.  I added cucumbers into the salad for a crunchy texture, and that helped, but I also ended up adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  It was pretty good after the alterations, and the different colors made the salad pretty.

Not the best. I did this for a group of my hsbands co-workers and they sort of ate it. I followed the recipie to the "t" just really didn't like the end product....I kept trying to think of anything that would make it better and came to a realization that anything extra would probably just make it worse. Wont make this again.

I used a peppercorn ranch dressing instead of regular, which gave it a bit more zing.  However, I wasn't sure about the A-1/steak sauce marinade.  It seemed a little overpowering.  Next time will try something a little more mellow for chicken.

This is a good recipe.  I would marinate the chicken in Bar-B-Que sauce next time (but I am not a huge fan of steak sauce) and either reduce the amount of onion or replace with jicima (? spelling).  Otherwise it was good and I will make it again.

I served this to a crowd on Mother's Day.  It went over really well.  The best part was that my family helped me prepare it AHEAD OF TIME.  My husband grilled the chicken, my daughter halved the tomatoes (I substituted grape tomatoes...they are firmer), and my young son poured in the dressing and did the mixing (and planted avocodo pits on toothpicks in water for a craft project later).  I had one guest who doesn't like chicken, so before I added the chix, I scooped out a portion and substituted pepperoni for him.  He loved it.  I'm definitely filing this recipe for future use!

I used A1 sauce which has a very bold flavor.  That mixed with the Ranch dressing made the salad very flavorful.  I liked it as well as my family.  I am making this again today and think I will add celery for an added crunch.

This was absolutely delicious, but I did make some changes.  I used Lowry's steak marinade on the chicken and let it sit or a few hours before broiling in my oven.  I cooked the pasta with beef bouillon instead of chicken because that is what I had on hand (I will be making pasta with bouillon again, it was surprisingly good).  I used a few shallots instead of the onion.  In addition to the listed ingredients I also added chopped cucumber, chopped flat parsley and basil from my garden.  Made a huge amount of food, but I'm glad to have the leftovers.

Delicious.  Only thing different I did was not to use the whole amount of ranch dressing and I didn't use all of the onion.  The chicken had a nice flavor after marinating for 2 hrs in the steak sauce.   The avacado was a great addition.  Loved it the next day too. Our family of 6 all loved it.

Even with my improvising-- using bow tie pasta and omitted the onions (didn't have), my husband liked it.  I'm happy to have tried this recipe because it was very easy to make.  Next time I will try adding some bacon and perhaps sweet peas.

Not much flavor, not a unique taste and avocado goes bad real quick.  Maybe I have weak taste buds because I don't understand why everyone else thought this had such great flavor.

I always make the recipe, first, as it is presented.  This time, I only omitted the 'shrooms because I just don't like any kind of mushroom.  Anyway, it was a little bland.  Perhaps go heavier on the dressing...I like the idea of adding artichoke hearts...didn't really notice the bouillon making much of a difference.  I'd try this a gain with some tweaks.

Here are a few tips to make this salad better if you think you will have leftovers (otherwise the leftover will be mushy and kinda icky):

As mentioned in the recipe, be sure to cook the pasta al dente.

Instead of using cherry tomatoes, use roma tomatoes--cut in half, pull out and discard the seeds and pulpy middle, and then chop the 'shell' part.  

Use the slices of avacado as a garnish or  sprinkled on top of only the amt. you plan on serving.  Otherwise, it gets not only mushy but brown 24 hours later.

I made this 3 days ago and the texture of the leftovers are perfect--as though I just made it but better because the flavors have had time to mix.

This is really good on a hot day.
I've made it without avocados & added cucumber & brocoli(needed to be used up)& use rotoni pasta sometimes. I've also added walnuts before.

Pretty darn good!  The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because I didn't follow the recipe.
I used breaded chicken, but added some BBQ sauce to the dressing, and it gave it an awesome taste.  So I can imagine this WOULD get 5 stars if I did it right!
Thanks, yummy, will definately make again.

Delicious!  Although I made a few changes...skipped the avocado and tomatoes.  Added broccoli, shredded cheese (any kind), and parmesan cheese.  My husband loved it!

We have a winner!  Very few recipes I try make it into my personal collection of favorites, but this one is a keeper.  Three of my 4 kids even liked it (one is an infant but I bet he WILL like it!)  The flavor of the A-1 marinated chicken with the combination of ingredients is incredibly delicious.  Thanks Gail!!!!!

I made this recipe for some friends last week, and they loved it! I was looking for Pasta salad with a twist, and this was perfect. I did make a few changes, and I do think the outcome of the flavors depend on the type of ranch dressing and marinate you choose. I chose to make the Hidden Valley Ranch dry seaoning packet and Chaka marinate. I also added red bell pepper for crunch. I chose red bell pepper, because they are sweeter. I only used half cup of the onion, because I am not a big fan of raw onion. Many of the guests were asking for the recipe.....Thank you so much!

This was ok for us.  It is a good start with some unique ingredients but for me the flavor just wasn't there.  After tasting the salad, I added alot of cracked pepper and a bit more salt.  I also like the option of putting in cut-up hard boiled eggs instead of avacados as suggested by another reviewer and next time will do that and add some cooked, chopped bacon.  It needs some more seasonings in the dressing, the ranch just disappears into the noodles leaving very little flavor.  All in all, I was happy to have found this recipe, I enjoyed many of the ingredients, I will just tweak it next time.  Thanks for a new recipe!

Yummy.  Just plain YUMMY.  This might be my new summer-cookout-dish that I bring to picnics and BBQs!!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, however I didn't have a fresh tomato so I used a can of pasta-ready tomatos (not the full can, about 3/4).

Next time, I might just buy the ready-prepared chicken fajita meat instead of marinading and grilling the chicken myself.

The avacado is a must-have on this recipe!

So very good! I used whole wheat pasta and it was just as good. Also added carrots and black olives. My boyfriend is a chef and it got his approval! Definitely make again!

Created this first for son's Kindergarten graduation celebration. People who love onion will love this. I used larger, thinner slices to pick out. Have made it twice and homemade ranch is better! People ate it up with raves.

This may not be the best but it is very good. Especially enjoyed the avocado. My kids surprisingly also liked it and asked me to make it again.

I'm sorry, but I did not enjoy this recipe.  I do not think the steak sauce works at all.  Too much avocado and not enough crunch as well.  My kids wouldn't eat it so it was a waste of money and time.  I won't be making it again.

It dawned on me as I was throwing this together that it isn't that much different than the pasta salad I just started throwing together years ago.  I used cherry tomatoes, cukes, onion, a little avocado (3 of the 4 i bought were bad...*sigh*)  chicken, whole wheat rotini, and a lowfat homemade ranch...good stuff.  i miss it with cauliflower though, i would have added it but I wasn't in the mood to pay $3 for a head of it.  

All in all...good stuff!

Not a fan. The only thing I changed to the recipe was that I used the low fat ranch. I felt the salad lacked flavor, and it was deffinitely not the best I've ever had.
