Cannot really rate yet as I have NOT made this recipe. What's puzzling me most and keeping me from trying this out is the lead-in comment about not being able to taste the breadcrumbs. Where are they even mentioned in this recipe? Am I missing something?

Very good! To be mindful of plastic which is banned from my kitchen, I just do the mixing  with oil and spices in a bowl.

If you read again, as I did, it refers in the comments to tasting the potato instead of bread crumbs.  I think it means that this recipe does NOT contain bread crumbs so one tastes more of the potato.

The recipe is AWESOME prepared as is. Tastes really good!  But I have one question.... where do you get that French fry holder?  It looks ceramic. It's just the right thing! Would love to have one.
