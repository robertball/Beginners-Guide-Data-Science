What do you make when you're having little kids over and you yourself don't have kids?  This would be it!  It's basically a hybrid of two childhood favorites pizza and sloppy joes - what could be easier or better, right?  I added some sauteed onion and a little garlic. And, while I have to admit that while I love pizza and I do like sloppy joes this was more for the kids. (Even though my husband did eat a few slices) Maybe it was because of the "Manwich" vs. homemade sloppy joes or using a Bobli bread shell.  But, this is a really good recipe for a quick meal or if you have a bunch of hungry kids.

This was a huge hit! I fixed two of these for my stepson and his friends and all proclaimed it one of the best pizzas they had ever had. Even my husband thought it was top notch. It was so simple and easy. I used a ready made thin crust, brushed it with olive oil and loaded the Sloppy Joe and cheese on. It was attractive and fantastic! Thanks for this great idea Brenda!

Boring! This was not as good as I was anticipating. We ate it, but will probably not make again. Tasted like canned sloppy joe mix on pizza crust. The flavors didn't really change or develop any more unfortunately. Would have been easier (and probably tastier) just to make traditional sloppy joes on a bun and serve with fries.

This is a great recipe! So easy, but delicious. We added chopped onions to the top of the pizza before baking, and I think they made the recipe even better.

I used canned biscuits and made mini pizzas with some leftover sloppy joes. I thought it needed a little sauce though so I used a dab of bbq sauce as a base. I think I liked the sloppy joe pizzas better than the original sloppy joes.

I've been making something like this for over 25 years now. For a bit more pizza authenticity, I add 1/2 a red pepper (sliced) along with some sliced black olives on top (and sliced mushroom under the 3 cheeses). Sometimes, I will make mini meatballs instead of just plain ground beef. I feel very lucky because all 4 of my children and all of my grandchildren love veggies, so this pizza is one of their favorites to eat in the summer. Thank you for sharing.

This is so easy and clever. We have a pizza night every week,and i dont like doing the same thing over and over. This was deffinately different, but very good. It does taste like a sloppy joe on a pizza crust, but isn't that the point? I followed the recipie exactly, but also put some diced bell pepper on top, as that is how we fix our joes too. Thanks for the great meal idea!

Nothing special but it wasn't bad.  I don't know if I'll make it again but it was worth a try.

This was fantastic! I only had cheddar cheese and it was great, even better the next day. My husband asked for it again tonight!
