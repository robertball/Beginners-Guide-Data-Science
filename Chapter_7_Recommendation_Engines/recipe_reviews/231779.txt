I made this for  a dinner party with 2 other homemade liqueurs.  This is the only one I don't have left overs of and the others were good too.  People put it on ice cream, angel food cake, in hot cocoa, coffee, and drank it straight.   I never have sweetened condensed milk or chocolate syrup on hand so I appreciated that I could make this entire recipe without buying special ingredients.  Only change, I didn't have Irish whiskey so I used Kentucky whiskey.  I will make this again. I did not put the coconut in, by the way.
