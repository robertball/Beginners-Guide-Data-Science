I love this method for cooking the pork.  Be careful with the salt on the meat though - between the salt on the meat and the salt in the broth & mustard it left the sauce too salty.

Hubs and I enjoyed this very much, served with baked acorn squash and pasta simply seasoned with garlic, olive oil and butter. The directions are spot on and any cook, experienced or not, should feel  completely confident preparing this recipe to the letter.  However, we are of the camp who don't need a whole bunch of cayenne pepper, hot sauce, chili pepper or  crushed red pepper flakes to ignite our taste buds.  I omitted the cayenne entirely and we coudn't have been more pleased with this dish.

I made this for Mother's Day.  My family absolutely loved it. The recipe was spot on....the pork was cooked perfectly and the sauce was so delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make this again.  Thank you, Chef John!

I’m giving this two stars only because the method of cooking the pork is so great.  Tender and juicy meat.  As for the sauce, no one in my family cared for it and I had to rinse it all off.  I must say I will continue to cook pork tenderloin this way, and leave out the mustard, horseradish, and cayenne.  Instead I will sauté some mushrooms and onions in the pan, add the broth and cream, and go with that.  IMO, browned pork has a wonderful flavor and aroma all its own, and hiding that with horseradish is a mistake.

Everyone raved about this recipe.  I'm just now realizing that I didn't add the butter or chives at the end.  Not sure how (or if) that would have changed the results but we loved it.

This pork recipe is fantastic.  We loved the sauce.  The horseradish and cayenne powder were not too overpowering at all. (I tripled the sauce recipe yet only kept the butter at 1 Tbs.)  My husband grilled the pork tenderloin while I prepared the sauce inside.  Company worthy!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Chef John.

Contrary to few of the reviews, I loved this recipe!  The sauce is what put it over the top.  I've been grilling tenderloins this way for quite some time and adding the sauce to my collection is a welcome addition.  As a sidebar: Reviews are just that; REVIEWS!--AFTER you've tried the recipe.  In addition to asking if the review was helpful Allrecipes should also ask about being "least helpful".

How can you go wrong with Pork and Mustard? This recipe just puts it over the top. One of our favorites, and part of the regular rotation.

I thought this tasted pretty good, better than I expected for some reason. I had approximately 1 lb of pork tenderloin cutlets, so I just cooked them fully in the pan. It took about 5-6 minutes. The sauce was very quick about 1-2 minutes to finish. Only change I made was using half and half, as it was so little anyhow, and I cut the horseradish in half as I find it to be a really dominant flavor. I also got the 3 servings suggested, with the 9 cutlets, being as they were cut on the thinner side. The calorie count was not too high either for a meat and sauce dish.

This recipe is very good, however I found the mustard and horseradish flavors a little strong for our taste.  To "soften" the flavor I gently stirred in 1/2 sour cream which made the sauce rich, creamy and still a little tangy.

I also used a 1.5 lb tenderloin and cooked it for 30 minutes.  Turned out beautiful and juicy.  I agree that you should use care when salting the tenderloin as the sauce is a bit salty on its own.  Highly recommend.

Chef John, do you ever make a recipe that isn't absolutely delicious!?!? I don't know why i'm always so surprised by how good your recipes are, but I am! Another stellar recipe! It's perfect! No changes needed at all. I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did. We couldn't stop eating it! Because it's summer, I try to grill everything, but I stopped myself and decided to stick with the recipe and make it as stated. What a great cooking method. Very easy, and the meat comes out perfectly cooked. The 2 tenderloins I was roasting were different sizes. The smaller one was perfectly done at 20 mins, and the bigger one was done at 25. While I was making the sauce, I transfered the pork to a large sheet of foil and wrapped it to keep warm. The meat was so tender and juicy. This one is company worthy and is sure to impress everyone (or at least those with good taste!).

This is a magnificent recipe, and I found it just when I thought there was not another new way to cook my favorite meat, pork tenderloin. Because it has no particular ethnic footprint, it leaves itself open to a wide variety of interesting side dishes, as well.

I really liked this recipe!  I agree with another viewer - be careful with salting the meat before cooking!  The sauce adds plenty.This is unlike anything I've ever put on pork tenderloin before. ( For my own personal taste, I might prefer more mustard and less horse radish.....)

WOW.  Thank you Chef John.  Dinner fit for company along with Sarah's Rice Pilaf and fresh green beans.  Made exactly as written but my roast came packaged 24 oz. so I had to bake an extra 20 minutes.  It came out PERFECT.  Will make this often.

Perfect...with a warning. I noticed reviews complaining of too much salt, so I searched three markets for non brined tenderloin to counter the salt problem. I never did find a tenderloin that had not been preserved in salt so I completely left the salt out of this recipe. If you can find fresh without any salt brine in the package, I would use the salt called for in the seasoning. If not....skip the salt addition.Delish!!!

Next time I either won't salt the meat before browning or I'll use low salt broth. 
I used fat free half and half (had it on hand) and sprinkled in a tiny bit of flour to thicken. Used half the butter. I will make this AGAIN and AGAIN!!! Thank you, chef John :)

This is my favorite pork tenderloin recipe. I did not use horseradish as my family does not care for it. The Dijon mustard, cayenne, organic chicken broth, cream, pan drippings and butter is enough to carry the sauce perfectly. We get larger 1.3 pound  tenderloins, (not 2 to a package), so I cut the tenderloin in half to fit into the pan together. Think that enhances the flavor as all 4 ends get flavored and there are a lot of brown bits for the sauce.

Nice flavors. I added some garlic powder on the tenderloin. I had problems with the sauce thickening, but that's probably all the subs I threw in it. I didn't have any cream and used coarse mustard, and some Brut I had here instead. Good flavor though!

Boy, I hate to be a nay sayer, but I did not like this sauce. Salt was not the issue. There are so many wonderful pork tenderloin recipes to choose from, this one will not be repeated. For one thing, the horseradish completely overpowered the pork. It was all I could taste. I followed the recipe exactly, using the proportions listed. I am wondering if there was a typo. I usually like mustard cream based sauces but this one lacked balance. It needed something, perhaps a honey mustard, to offset the tang of the horseradish. I may try adding a bit to the leftovers. If it works, I will post the result. Sorry Chef John.

The sauce was fantastic!  But cooking my tenderloin to 145 degrees resulted in a very pink center that left a pink puddle on my plate and I did not feel good about eating it at all.  I recommend cooking to an internal temp of 165.  Hubby gobbled it up without complaint though, and he also was a fan of the sauce.  I did thicken the sauce up a bit more though.

Accurate portions, very nice dish.  My tenderloins came out of the oven at exactly 145 degrees, let them sit for five minutes and they were perfectly done.  I doubled the recipe and have cooked it twice in the last  month.  Excellent both times.  Love the sauce, the horseradish comes through beautifully!  Am going to add to my regular rotation.  Thanks for a great one!

I am rating the sauce only as I had no pork tenderloin.  I used ground beef, formed into single serving rectangular logs, seasoned and cooked on the stove top.  I set them aside and from that point followed the recipe for the sauce.  I made about 5 cuts on each log and drizzled the sauce over each.  The Diablo sauce transformed the ground beef loaves into something really special.  Delicious and even looked great, too.

Yummy!!!!!!!!! I altered the recipe a bit....Sour cream instead of cream, regular horseradish instead of extra hot horseradish and almost 1/2tsp of cayenne.

I've made this recipe 4 or 5 times now and we LOVE it, although my roommate hates to admit she loves it since the Diablo means "devil"! When I tell her that's what I'm cooking she swears she's not going to eat any, but when it's time to eat, she practically DRINKS the sauce because it's that good! I usually tell her I'm making the "Spicy Pork" dish we like, just so we don't go through the same routine of her saying she's not eating it. Lol! By the way, I've started doubling the sauce recipe because we love it so much! Now I'm off to the store for horseradish so I can make this tonight. Thanks Chef John!

FABulous! Followed recipe to a T. The sauce put this over the top. Hubby said he'd marry me all over again if I promised to serve this diablo delish dish over and over again!! Served with Chef John's Special Roasted Potatoes, yum and Asparagus.

Great recipe!  My all time favourite pork dish!  Love the sauce!  One concern though....  The recipe stipulates the internal temperature should be 145 degrees. I think this is a typo.  My thermometer identifies 170 degrees for pork. I'm thinking 165 would be the correct temperature as Chef John states the temperature will rise five degrees after it is removed from the oven. Right or wrong, I cooked mine to 165 degrees which took 22 minutes and it was perfect!

Loved it.  Didn't have any heavy cream so I subbed some non fat sour cream in place.  Worked perfectly.  I also added some stir fried mushrooms to the sauce which I think was a delicious compliment.

This was absolutely the BEST tenderloin recipe ever!  The ONLY thing I changed was that I did not have any heavy cream....so, what did I do?  I substituted plain almond milk since that was all I had.  Actually I think that the nutty flavor of the milk might have helped...but will probably use half and half next time.  There WILL be a next time.   BTW, don't skimp on the mustard or horseradish...you'd never know that there was so much of it.  YUM...oh, I might think of doubling the sauce next time????  GREAT try it!

Delicious. I have been searching for a while for a good recipe for pork tenderloin. Found it !!!!
Meat is nice and tender, not dry at all, sauce is great. For my oven, 20 minutes was too long, next time I'll try to cook it for 15 minutes.

I made this recipe as written except that I only had regular creamy horseradish. It was Delicious!! We are looking forward to the leftovers tonight, as I cooked double the amount.   Those who want the pork at 165, your meat will be tough. My instant read thermometer states fresh pork is well done at 145 with a 3 minute rest. Honestly mine was good, but could have been taken out a bit sooner.   Thank you Chef John! I’m serving this to company next time.

Love this! Made it exactly according to the recipe and we loved every single bite. If you are sensitive to salt, consider leaving out the salt or using low-sodium broth. It does have a kick, so if you are sensitive to heat, use regular horseradish or cut the cayenne pepper. We loved it as is. Thank you, Chef John, for a delicious and easy recipe!

Liked the distinctive flavor.  Used half as much cayenne because my husband has GERDs and wanted to tone it down for him. Also used Half and half instead of heavy creme because it was what I had on hand.  Baked for 30 minutes because I had a 2.36 lb roast instead of 1 lb. Like that I didn't have to marinade 2-4 hrs or overnite for this recipe.  Can make this recipe on a whim. Did not come out fork cutting tender, but pretty close.  Nice and moist and tender enough. We will make it again.

We both really liked this.  Didn't change a thing.  It does have a bite to it, but we like that.  I took it out at 20 minutes and let rest for 10 minutes.  I probably could have taken it out earlier.  It was over 150 degrees.  Still moist and tasty though.

Ive probably made this 20 times exactly as written. It's on regular rotation at our house.  I'd love to know how to keep horseradish hot.  Seems like I always have to buy new to get the same kick.

After reading the reviews I reluctantly left the pork unsalted. I am a believer that pork should be highly seasoned with salt. After the sauce was reduced I tasted it and became quite concerned as it tasted a bit weird and a little bitter. I used it anyway and the combination on UNsalted pork and "bitter" sauce was heavenly!  Glad I forged ahead. I made extra sauce and my family found itself looking for items to pair with the sauce. Nice recipe.

Pork was extremely tender and delicious.   I would simply suggest doubling the sauce recipe as I didn't find the sauce to be plentiful enough.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This sauce was absolutely delicious but I felt like it didn't connect to the pork- like it would have been as good with any other meat.  maybe next time i'll crust the pork with a litt5le bit of horseradish so it will absorb some of the flavor

I am sitting here at 3:30 in the morning having just eaten the last lonely piece of pork tenderloin diablo which was calling my name when I woke a half hour ago!   This is a keeper for sure.  Loved that little bite from the horseradish in the sauce!  I followed the recipe exactly as I always do the first time I make a recipe and i cant think of a thing I would do differently.  Thanks Chef John.  Every recipe of yours that I have tried always turns out perfectly every time!  UPDATE:  I tried the recipe with a different dijon mustard that has elements of spicy brown mustard with whole mustard seeds in it.  OMG!  Even better.

Good idea but the ingredient quantities are off.  There is WAY TO MUCH cayenne pepper! Even cutting it in half was still too much -- and I like things spicy.  Next time I'll leave it out completely and may sprinkle in a tiny bit at the end to taste. (But I think the horseradish and mustard will be enough heat.)  Also, cooking  the pork to 145 degrees it was still fully red in the middle. So I cooked to 160+ and it was about right, slightly pink.  The sauce does not thicken up with this much broth unless you were to boil for a long time. I suggest using half the amount of broth and doubling the cream to make it thicker.

This is an easy and delicious way to prepare pork tenderloin.  The sauce was a little zippy but not too hot.  I served it with roasted root vegetables.  Great dinner with low carbs!

Delicious,  easy and company worthy, I have been making this regularly for the last year.  Before the first frost I harvested my chives and combined them chopped in room temp. butter and froze in a roll  scoring at one tablespoon increments along the top half of the roll.  They stay perfectly green...add to the sauce at the end!  Thank you Chef John for our family favourite meal.

Wow, this is really good. I only had regular cream so had to add some corn starch to thicken the sauce but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome! Great for a Sunday dinner and also company-worthy!

Perfect recipe for pork tenderloin. I accidentally overcooked ours, we prefer a medium bright pink, but I left it in too long, so it was slightly pink. It was still delicious and we ate every bit. We also like salt, so the seasonings were spot on.  Don’t change a thing in this recipe, it is absolutely amazing the way it is. Again a new recipe by Chef John that will be made often in our home.

Easy, fast, and delicious. I adapted a little bit because my tenderloin was seasoned with mesquite. So in the sauce I used honey mustard and no horseradish, making it spicy but not diablo. Family loved it! Thanks, Chef John. I love your recipes.

Outstanding.  We had this for New Year's Eve Dinner.  It's so simple to make and was delicious.  I had no cayenne pepper available and had regular horseradish, rather than hot. but it was still exceptional.  Can't wait to try it with all the ingredients.  It was very easy to make.  Served with new potatoes and grilled peppers.

It's devilish how good this is compared to how little work it takes! I started with only 1/2 the cayenne, and had to bump it up to probably the recommended amount... the other elements somehow need the cayenne to play off of, and the butter and cream mellow it out.

Loved it.  I did two tenderloins at once (which was a tight fit in the skillet) and doubled all the ingredients in the sauce, and it turned out great.  The sauce is pretty assertive with the mustard and horseradish but we really enjoyed it and will definitely make this again.

Delicious main course. I used unsalted butter and low salt chicken broth because I’m not a salt friend. The sauce was delicious, with just the right amount of kick.

Wow! Chef John has done it again with another 5 star recipe. I tripled the entire recipe (used two 1 1/2 lb. tenderloins) and made it in my brand new cast iron pot. I’m already dreaming about having the leftovers tomorrow. Served with mashed cauliflower and asparagus. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

This is one of our favorites and I’ve made it many times.  Tonight I discovered it really is pretty full proof.  I wanted to double the sauce recipe because there is never enough for as much as we love it so I just kinda sorta eye balled what double everything might be. I just dumped a bunch of chicken broth in the skillet and then added the other ingredients ( half and half because I didn’t have heavy cream) and let it cook down stirring constantly.  It was every bit as heavenly and I still found myself licking the s raping off the spoon as I cleaned the pan.  Served it with a super crunchy Italian style green salad and buttery mashed potatoes.

This recipe is off the chart. Everything Chef John makes is 5 stars and the home chef should have no problem recreating.  Pork doesn't have much flavor but when you drizzle it with the sauce it is out of this world. I didn't have extra hot horseradish just the regular prepared and it was perfect for my family.

My husband really enjoyed this! The tenderloin cooked perfectly following Chef John's directions. Our local grocer only had half & half so the sauce was not as thick as I would have liked but still tasted very good and  had a 'kick" but not overly spicy.  I will make this again!

Has been our favourite family recipe for the last 2 years now.  Only thing I do differently is instead of 2 tablespoons heavy cream, I use 1 tablespoon sour cream and 1 tablespoon cream cheese.  And then instead of dijon mustard I use honey dijon.  and a little less cayenne then called for so its not to hot for the kids.  Thank you so much for this 5 star restaurant quality simple to make recipe.

My sister turned me on to this recipe.  We both use AR.  This is so easy to assemble the ingredients and prepare the tenderloin.  Once you sear it, just toss it into the oven and you're free to assemble the rest of your meal quickly.  My husband LOVES the sauce.  We enjoy the extra kick.  It's versatile and you could use it on other cuts of meat.  Like other users, we doubled the sauce.  Other than that, I didn't change anything.  You don't need to.

That sauce is terrible! While the pork turned out great, nice and tender, the sauce was inedible without some major tweaking.  We added bacon as another reviewer suggested but the overwhelming dijon and horseradish taste had to be overcome by large amounts of extra stock, cream and parmesan cheese.  Will not be making that sauce in the future. Have found much better dijon cream sauces that would work.

I wish I could give this recipe 6 stars!  I absolutely LOVED it!  The only change I made was I added garlic before I browned it.  I also doubled the sauce. That sauce is AMAZING! I served it with boiled redskin potatoes and carrot slices with cinnamon and a bit of butter.

Made it exactly as directed and loved the sauce. I love spicy but if you don’t like spicy things I would skip this recipe.  Oh and I cooked the pork to 160 degree.  Pink porks scares me. It is a keeper!

My family loved this.  Pork was extremely tender. I doubled the sauce and could’ve made more and used 2 lb tenderloins. The only  institution I made was not doubling the cheyene. Will definitely make again.

USUALLY DON'T FOLLOW EXACTLY but this time I did.  I will definitely do again but maybe it was my brand but the horseradish tool over too much so a little less next time.

This was a delicious recipe, company worthy but perfect for a weeknight meal as it's very easy to prepare.  I did make some minor changes to suit our taste.  Because I wanted plenty of sauce I doubled the sauce ingredients except for the horseradish (used 1 T) cayenne (a pinch).  I followed the instructions to sear the pork on one side, then transfer to the oven, but found I had to cook it about 35 minutes, again to suit our taste and liking for more well-done pork.  It was still tender and delicious and the sauce was outstanding.

Awesome! I bought a peppercorn tenderloin because they didn’t have any plain ones so I skipped the salt and pepper step. Browned in the pan then baked at 325 (already something in the oven) for 30 minutes. Instant read thermometer said it was done and it was perfectly tender. Sauce was excellent but I could only find regular prepared horseradish. I think the hot would’ve been too hot anyway with the addition of the 1/4 tsp. Cayenne pepper. Keeper recipe and pretty easy.

Excellent. The best pork dish I have made. Definitely will do again.
Made a few changes based on my own taste.
Grilled the tenderloin for a few minutes each side before putting in the oven just for a little charred flavor. Put some butter on tenderloin before grilling to kick up the smoke and flame from the grill. Salt, pepper, garlic, and olive oil on the tenderloin about 2 hours before grilling.  Cooked tenderloin in the oven to 160 degrees. It was moist and tender.
Made the sauce as described except sprinkled sliced scallions over the cut tenderloin after covering with the sauce.

OMG... This is one of the best Pork Tenderloin recipes I have made (besides my own creation). Easy way to make the tenderloin but the best part was the sauce, how creative of Chef John.  The sauce was awesome, cant' believe someone actually scraped it off and rated it 2 stars.  Made this exactly to the recipe and would not change a thing except maybe make more sauce :)

Second time making this recipe, this time was for some special company and everyone loved it!  The sauce is fantastic and even our picky little ones went back for more.  
Thank you!

I made this exactly as described. I love spicy so I loved the sauce, hence my 5 stars. It is diablo as described in the video!   My other half suggested I cut the cayenne in half or leave it out b/c he found it a bit too spicy so keep that in mind. I will make this again!

I followed the recipe pretty close, it turned out amazing. I made baked sweet potatoes and roasted brussel sprouts on the side. The sauce was excellent and went well with the brussel sprouts.

I did not make any changes but doubled up the recipe. The leftover sauce was even smoother and better the next day !! A good horseradish really makes a difference.

This was amazing. Not having to marinate makes a huge difference on a busy weeknight and it doesn’t suffer for it. The pork was so tender and juicy inside, and crispy on the outside.

This is a amazing recipe!  This is the 2nd time I have made it and it wowed my company.  Harry has chef experience and loved it!  

I  followed the recipe exactly for ingredients - only followed advice of a review to double the  amount  of  sauce.    

This is going to become my new go to recipe for 1st time guests!

Wonderful and flavorful.  Not to hot for the wife.  It felt like the sauce was missing something so we added a dash of smoked paprika on the second serving.  Worked well adding a nice, subtle smoky flavor I felt the dish needed.  Will add to our armory for making again.

Amazing! I used dry mustard and no chives. It was delicious!
There was more than enough sauce for my .85 oz. Pork Tenderloin. Going to try Beef Stock and this recipe for a Roast
Beef. YUM!

It turns out very delicious.I used ground ginger,because I didn't have horseradish and used regular mustard because I didn't have dijon mustard  Didn't use fresh chives because I didn't have any. It very tender and juicy.I would make it again.

Amazing. I seared it on both sides and baked it a little longer. It was barely pink, which was exactly what i wanted. The sauce was amazing.

I made this in our cast iron frying pan exactly like the recipe and Chef John’s instructions. Very full flavours, surprisingly not overpowering. I have added this to my favourites and will certainly make this again. I wouldn’t salt the meat next time. Between grocery saline injections and the salts in the sauce ingredients it was too salty.

as usual, Chef John's recipes kick butt! the only addition I made to this recipe was to add a quarter cup of white wine. This dish was phenomenal! They were eating it before I ever got it served. This will end up being a family favorite I assure you. Thanks again Chef John!

Cooked the pork as written and was very happy with the results.  Found the sauce a little too mustardy for our liking, but it was lovely and smooth over the meat.  Have frozen the leftovers and hoping everything will mellow when reheated.

I pretty well followed the recipe. I did seer the pork well on all sides before putting into the oven. I added more cream to produce more sauce which was a real hit. I’ll use this sauce for a lot of different meats.

Made this tonight and followed recipe exactly which I hardly ever do.  It was perfection. Would def serve at dinner party. Sauce was SO good I wish I had made more for potatoes I served on side.  Easy, few ingredients and one pan clean up.  Love this!  Use the chives... good and nice presentation.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, but it wasn’t quite what we thought it might be. I made the recipe following the video/recipe to the letter. I did use a LARGE pan and doubled the recipe (2 pork tenderloins) and double the sauce. My husband thought the sauce could use just a little more zip. I used a hot horse radish, but may increase the amount next time. It took longer than 25 minutes for my pork to reach the correct temperature.  I ended up cooking them about 35 minutes.  The pork was tender and delicious. It was well seared on one side, but the other side that I flipped to prior to putting in the oven did not become seared very well. I think next time I will sear both sides and then hopefully the cooking time may be decreased a bit. We will also add more horseradish and leave the chives out of the sauce. We didn’t care for the flavor of the chives in the sauce, they  can be added as each person chooses.

Diablo it is.  Tasty but an acquired taste to be sure.  If your guests don't like it hot/spicy, turn to an old favourite recipe - they may drink all your beer if you do not.

I cooked this for 20 people at a family gathering and everyone loved it.  We had all ages and even some wannabe vegans who tried it and also loved it.

Thanks, Chef John!  I was looking for an interesting pork chop marinade and would never in 100 years put horseradish and mustard together.  I also added the cayenne and salt & pepper and drizzled with olive oil.  So yum!  Cooked the 1.25" boneless chops in an electric skillet. Another winner.  Can't wait to make this recipe with a real tenderloin and all the sauce; will follow it to the letter!

Thanks Chef John, 
That was the most moist, tenderest pork I've ever had. I've been over cooking it, way above 145 F degrees. My wife likes it well done, "It's pink in the middle." It was only slightly pink. I told her that a master chef assured me it was OK.
Also, the sauce was heavenly. A meal worthy of a world class restaurant.

Delicious and very quick to come together! I doubled the sauce because I like things saucy and used half and half instead of cream, and it turned out great. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.

This recipe is wonderful, the sauce is delicious and my pork came out perfect, that said, if you do not like horseradish and mustard, you will obviously not like the sauce, so I left the sauce in a small bowl for some to spoon over and others to opt out, anyway the pork was perfect, and everyone was happy.

My husband and I loved this recipe so much. I ended up making it 2 nights in a row since I had an extra pork tenderloin and enough ingredients. The only thing I changed on the second night was I doubled the amount for the sauce since we both loved it so much. Definitely going to be a new dish I will be making more often.

This is the best and easiest way to enjoy pork tenderloin 
I didn't use the sauce this time somehow it came out too salty, this pork is great plain or with jalapeno hot jelly

Followed to a T and this recipe was spot on! I didn't add any salt or pepper to the sauce as it didn't call forin the recipe and it turned out great - chicken broth cooked down with the other ingredients was flavorful enough without S&P. A nice mild kick from the horseradish and cayenne. Served with roasted potatoes and Brussels sprouts - sauce was a great accompaniment to the vegetables especially when trying to hide the sprouts from your spouse!

This was so fantastic! Easy, and I had everything I needed. I used 2% milk (all I had), and freeze dried chives. Loved it so much made it again a few days later. So simple, but so flavorful.

This was very good and easy to make. I did have to cook the pork longer in the oven to reach 145 but maybe my pork was thicker than normal? I didn't use extra hot horseradish sauce because I just had regular in my fridge and it was fine with that.  I'd make this again.

Absolutely delicious and a really easy main course to make. The only change I might make is to double the horseradish amount, but it is Diablo enough as it is.

This meal was extremely easy to make and truly delicious. The pork turned out perfectly and the sauce was a perfect compliment.  I couldn't believe how quickly it came together - the look and taste would surely make anyone think that it was a more complicated recipe...it's a winner.

This is a very good pork recipe. The pork was very tender and the sauce had a nice punch to it. I increased the amounts of Dijon and horseradish. The family loved it. They want it again.

I am always going to cook pork tenderloin from now on!  I was skeptical that the pork would be done after 20 minutes, but it was perfectly pink and juicy.   The sauce was also delicious. A keeper recipe!

Chef John 4 Stars as always. I used my instant pot...sautéed the tenderloin following the recipe. Seven minutes on high pressure with a quick release. Made the pan sauce after tenting the tenderloin under foil. The combination of horseradish and mustard was delicious. I thought it would be too hot but it was perfect. Thank you my friend!

I made it with a good hick cut pork chop and the sauce was spot on delicious. The mustard really comes through but has a nice amount of heat from the horseradish.

As usual Chef John put out another amazing recipe.  I prepared it as written with one exception,  I did use regular horseradish instead of the extra hot.  I prepared this with Basmatti rice and used a little of the sauce over my serving of rice at the table.  Pork tenderloin is one of my favorite meats to begin with but I get "bored" grilling it on the grill or just roasting it.  The sauce makes the tenderloin so interesting in this recipe.  Will most definitely make it again!!!  Oh and by the way, even my 15 year old was blown away!!!

Did not add salt due to dietary restrictions, but otherwise absolutely wonderful! Flavors blend so well. Family loved it and said to keep it on the rotation!

I made the recipe as is and really liked it.  The next time I make it I will use more cayenne pepper as we did not find it at all spicy.  I'd also like to find an alternative to heavy cream to keep down the calories but otherwise it was just delicious.  I also found that I needed to cook it a bit longer than stated.
The pork was very tender and flavorful.  A keeper.  !

Made this for the family this weekend.  Followed the recipe, maybe a little more hot horseradish for a little more kick.
Everyone loved it.  This will go in the monthly rotation.

This recipe changed my family's lives. Seriously my parents never made pork unless it was well done and when I served this dish they were astonished. The sauce is a bit spicy but I just drizzled a little on top and I thought it was delicious. This is now a staple in our kitchen and I make it at least once a month.

This is a really easy pork loin recipe unless your oven turns off midway through the cooking.  The paused cooking made the loin a bit tougher than anticipated.  That being said, the sauce comes together pretty quickly. The flavors work well with the pork.   We were happy with this recipe and how it turned out.

The sauce for this pork was AMAZING!  My husband normally is not interested in extras like sauce, but he really liked this one.  I followed the cooking instructions for the pork, and it was not as crispy as I tend to like.  (I am used to cooking pork tenderloin on the grill).  Definitely a good recipe!  If you like your pork crispy, do it on the grill ;)

I have used this recipe numerous times from when I first read it.  I have watched the video numerous times.  I must say that the recipe has never failed me and I do not vary it one iota.  Further, all the guests for whom I have prepared this dish, have raved about it without exception.  Thank you chef John!  Also, the sauce is good for many other dishes.  Just excellent

I can't say that I made this recipe, cause I made some minor variations.   I marinaded my two tenderloins in olive oil, cooking white a two hot peppers which I blended for 2.5 hrs.  When it came to the sauce, my cream had gone bad, so I left it out, so the saucy was runnier but still wonderful and I subbed cooking wine for chicken broth.   The predominant flavors of mustard and peppers and the wine went tremendously well with the pork.   I ended up cooking my 'loins for 18 minutes instead of 20 but I think my oven may be a bit on the hot side, came out perfect though.  One of my favorites I'll be coming back to.

My husband and I made this together and I don't care for food that is too spicy so we just bought  prepared horseradish, not extra spicy. My husband said it was the best dinner he has had in a long time! We both absolutely love this dish and we will definitely be making it again! It came out perfect!

Made this awesome dish for Mother’s Day.  Big hit with the Diablo sauce.  Be careful and don’t add too much mustard it will over power the pork.

Would have made it exactly as written except that I did not have any heavy cream, so subbed in sour cream.  Also cut the horseradish a bit (did 1 1/4 tbl) to appeal to teenagers.  Everyone loved the dish, especially the sauce which ended up on our rice as well.  Will make again.

I tried this recipe even though I didn't have a pork tenderloin handy, just a couple of tenderloin chops, so I improvised the process a bit and skipped the oven roast and cooked the chops on a cast iron skillet.  The sauce still turned out great, and I think the people who say it was too salty probably used salted butter in the sauce.  A good rule of thumb for salted butter in cooking is, if your recipe already has salt in it you should use unsalted butter.  My sauce tasted great, and I paired the pork with Oven Roasted Red Potatoes and Asparagus with Red Peppers for a good hearty meal.

Yup - this deserves all 5 stars. Pork tenderloin is so blah, and this recipe is great because a) you don’t need a marinade and b) you don’t need to BBQ to give it flavour.  Totally adding to the rotation.

This was so scrumptious!  I dialed back the horseradish and cayenne pepper thinking it would be too spicy and overwhelming - NOT!   I used the little gravy I had left to make another batch of it and didn't hold back.  Yum!

Delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and omitted salting the pork so it wouldn't be too salty in the end. Cooked perfectly in 25 minutes. Love the sauce with this, just the right amount of kick. I served alongside lemon herb couscous and green beans to balance out the spice from the sauce.

Big fan of this recipe! The pork tenderloin is so easy to prepare while still coming out juicy and tender. But obviously what elevates the game here is the sauce. I’m not crazy about Dijon so I actually used regular yellow mustard which toned down some of the overall harshness in a way that better suits my pallet since there is already horseradish and cayenne pepper at play. I used Lawry’s seasoning salt to season the pork along with black pepper but made sure to moderate it as other reviewers have mentioned to curb the saltiness. I also highly recommend doubling the sauce recipe...you’re going to want to drizzle it over every last inch of your pork. Yep...it’s that good, thanks again Chef John!

This came together so easy on a weeknight.  The pork cooked perfectly using this method.  I loved the sauce, but, I am a huge fan of anything using horseradish.  I went light on the salt  based on other reviewer's suggestions.  I used green onions instead of chives because that is what I had in my house.

Wife and I absolutely loved it! This sauce will be used with other meats. The pork was fantastic but for some reason it took me significantly longer to cook it. 375 on my stove must be different from yours. Spinach and baked sweet potato made for a great meal!

I didn't have a oven proof skillet, so we used a glass baking pan. It turned out fine although I would like to try it as directed. 

My sauce wasn't thick enough, so my wife used corn starch to thicken it. 

I like spicy foods, so we added more cayenne, horseradish, and mustard. It turned out with more zing.

We used low sodium broth to offset the salt used on the meat prior to cooking.

This is the first time I've made pork loin. Why have I waited so long? The pork and sauce paired so well together. If you love spice, mustard, vinegar and salt, this recipe is for you! I doubled the sauce recipe, and was able to have leftovers to use as a veggie dip, and atop eggs. Yummy! Will definitely make this dish again.

This was very tasty and worth the effort. I went a bit heavy on the mustard and horseradish, and I ground a dried cayenne pepper left over from the garden last summer. I used more than twice the broth suggested, the sauce makes the dish and my kids wanted as much as was left in the pan. I think the cooking times are just a touch on the long side, I seared for only about 3 min each side and baked for 20 min. Came out perfect.

It was OK. The horseradish was overpowering and it came out thinner I anticipated so I had to thicken it.

I did this on the BGE. Instead of pan-searing I prepared a yellow mustard/pepper rub. I did the sauce in a pot per the directions. Turned out great! If you don’t like heat omit the cayenne because it comes out well with the sauce. I’d suggest a Riesling to offset the spice.

This sauce is really good. I had some extra time so i braised the pork tenderloin in the sauce in a Dutch oven on 300 for an hour and a half or two hours. The pork came out fork tender and I thickened the sauce with about a tablespoon or so of sour cream and it was wonderful. I paired it with sautéed onions and Brussel sprouts (which were also very good with the sauce). Definitely a keeper!

i like the gist of this recipe but i made a few slight changes that i think made it closer to what i like.

first, i seasoned it with kosher salt and cracked peppercorn, then i seared the tenderloin on all sides. once done with the sear, i transferred the tenderloin to a rack on a foil-lined sheet pan and completed the sauce while the roast was in the oven.

for the sauce, i sauteed some minced shallot before deglazing, and i  substituted white wine for the broth, which mellowed out the dijon and horseradish. i didn't have chives on hand so i omitted them, and instead of the cayenne, i added a couple of dashes of hot sauce (i wanted less heat and more flavor, especially since there was already horseradish in the sauce).

overall, there wasn't anything spectacular about the dish or the sauce, so i'm not sure i'd make it again.

This sauce is FIRE! I found myself tempted to just drink what we didn't use for the meat. Would also work really well with beef.

This Pork Tenderlion was absolutely delicious.. Followed the directions to the tee... Extremely tender and the gravy was not overpowering or to spicy at least to me, I used to like a little heat but not anymore as I have gotten older.. this dish it worth trying you will be surprised...

This is SO good. Love it. Different from the usual pork recipes. I dont know how some people didn't like this sauce, it's so good, I could drink it. My only complaint is there needs to be more sauce so you could smother mashed potatoes in it.

I would give this a 10 if I could! SUPER EASY, AMAZINGLY TASTY and the family absolutely loved it.  This will definitely be a staple in our home.  Chef John is so right... easy enough to be a quick weekday meal, complex enough to be a holiday or party feature.

Very good method for making the pork tenderloin. Thought the sauce was good, not great; seemed better the next day. I'll make this again.

Love this way to cook tenderloin!  It was perfectly done (following the temp guidance) the sauce was tasty. Even if I do a different sauce recipe, I'm going to cook tenderloin this way again. Great recipe though, something different. Company tonight loved it.

I made it exactly as written except for the chives.  I think the chives were really just for presentation.  (just 1 teaspoon)  My husband  can't stop raving about it.   I liked it a lot also. It leaves such a good taste in your mouth when you are done eating.  I will  make it many times again.  It would be a good company  meal, if everyone likes mustard.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight and it was so easy!  The pork turned out beautifully - I cooked it exactly as directed.  I doubled the sauce as we like to put it over white rice.  That was the only change I made.  It was spicy though so next time I will probably cut down on the cayenne and maybe the pepper on the pork.  I thought it was delicious as did my hubby.  I will make again for sure!  Update:  I have been making this about twice a month since I wrote my review and we absolutely LOVE it!  It's one of our favorite dishes.  Thanks Chef John!  You are amazing!!

I’ve made it twice now and both times made it exactly like stated except 2x then 3x the amount of sauce and added mushrooms to the chicken stock for 3 mind, removed them into a bowl, then whisked in the other ingredients, put the mushrooms back in and finished reducing sauce then served. All 3 of my daughters asked   the same thing. “What is this sauce?”  Very nice.

Loved the cooking technique for the pork.  It turned out just right.  I used two 1 pound tenderloin pieces (cut from a 7 pound tenderloin) so I doubled the sauce recipe.  There was quite a bit of  juices left in the pan after cooking the pork in the oven.  Maybe that's why the sauce initially turned out rather soupy.  I quickly made a slurry of water and 1 teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  It did so quickly and nicely.  I agree with others that the sauce was a bit salty.  Next time I won't salt the pork and I'll be sure to use a low sodium chicken broth.  Other than that, the recipe was superb!  I really liked the combination of the horseradish and Dijon mustard.  Great flavor!  Thanks, Chef John!

The whole family enjoyed this pork dinner.  The sauce was amazing.  I'm always trying to find an excuse for eating horseradish, and was very satisfying.  Not too spicy for the kids.  I doubled the recipe because I cooked two tenderloins from the Costco package.  It's good cold the next day too!

This recipe is so easy and yet tastes divine!  I made just a few minor tweaks.  Added some minced garlic and onion powder to the pan when flash frying the pork tenderloin before popping it in the onion.  I also omitted the cayenne pepper because I cannot handle heat well, but honestly, I think I could have added a dash and it would have been just fine.  I also added an extra tablespoon or two of heavy cream because we like our sauces a little thicker.   Everyone loved it and went back for seconds.  We all wanted to drink the rest of the sauce out of the pan with a straw it was sooo good.

This was outstanding. It was relatively quick and simple to prepare, and the finished entree looked very elegant on the plate. I did make a couple of modifications. 

I doubled the sauce, and I'm glad that I did. I used light cream rather than heavy cream because that's what I had on hand. Instead of horseradish, I used a tsp of ground ginger and 2 tbsp of spicy deli mustard. Also, I didn't double the cayenne, but stuck with the 1/4 tsp. The result was a creamy, delicious mustard sauce sauce that warmed the mouth without clearing the nose. Perfect for my wife's more sensitive palate.

This came out perfect.  Since I was using the small pork tenderloin, I actually cooked the whole dish in the cast iron skillet.  Seemed too small to heat up the oven

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Knowing our tastes, I did make a few alterations: sautéed a little onion in the pan before adding the chicken broth, reduced the mustard to about a teaspoon, cut back a bit on the horseradish and the cayenne and added a little more broth & cream than the recipe called for. I also browned the pork on all sides before putting it in the oven. Only change I'll make going forward is cut the cayenne to just a pinch.

I just made this and pretty much followed the recipe to a T. It was amazing!! I will be making this again and do not feel a need to tweak it. It is amazing! I may have been a little liberal with the cayenne and hot sauce but we like a dish to have some zing. Will definitely be making this again. And again. Thanks Chef John!

I didn't even have all the ingredients for the pan sauce but I winged it with spicy brown mustard. Still turned out great. I've never cooked tenderloin that hasn't been on the dry side until this recipe. Served it with peas and spaghetti squash dressed with olive oil, salt and pepper.

As John stated as it is it is a classic. Its perfect. I also have a lactose intolerant Son and I found a couple of modifications helpful for him. I wisk in 1 T of cornstarch to the broth/stock before adding it in. I eliminate the cream and use 2T of Almond/coconut milk. I also half the butter. No GI upset and all the taste and thickness in the sauce that you need.  This is a regular for us!  Keep the sauce on the side if you have little ones in case it is too much for them. Perfect with roasted baby potatoes and brussel sprouts with a side of cooling apple sauce or slices.

This was sooooooo good I will be keeping this in regular rotation. The  meat was absolutely perfect - moist, flavorful, tender. For the sauce I left our the cayenne but it was absolutely delicious even without it. Perfect blend of horseradish heat and buttery creaminess. Loved it!

GOOD. We enjoyed. Good sauce. I like sauce so I doubled. 
Definitely do again. I did forget the cayenne . It was sitting there,
but I forgot it. Still good.

I cook pork tenderloin a lot, so I'm always looking for new ideas.  I always grill mine and then adapt to whatever recipe I'm following.  So I coated two with olive oil, kosher salt, and fresh ground pepper and prepared as usual.  Meanwhile I had the chicken broth ready in a skillet with a mixing cup with the cream (I used half and half because it was on hand), and other ingredients - adding the butter and chives at the end.  I had 2.3 pounds of meat so I doubled the sauce.  I slice my tenderloins like roast beef after I let them sit coming off the grill.  So I sliced, put on plates with a healthy helping of fresh steamed broccoli, and drizzled the sauce over both.  My sauce was thin (no doubt because of the lack of cream) but the taste was divine.  I'm saving the recipe just for the sauce.  My tenderloins always come out wonderful but this just nailed it.  Nicely done.  Not a drop left after the family was done.

My tenderloin was 1 1/2 lbs.  Other than that I made no changes.  This was fantastic.  The sauce wasn't as hot as I thought it was going to be.  I wouldn't exactly call it "diablo."

In reading one review about too much salt I realized I had not salted the meat I started browning it whether that mattered I don't know but it wasn't too salty.  I think it is an excellent recipe for pork tenderloin and will fix it again.

Perfect recipe for quick dinners... plus, the tenderloin is the juiciest I've ever done. Trust the 145 degrees... anything more than that and it'll get tough and chewy. My wife doesn't like spicy foods, so I minimize the cayenne to a dash. Perfect sauce.

Giving this a 5 but did have some cheats/adjustments. I used pork loin from Trader Joe's so it's really pre-seasoned nicely. I eyeballed the cayenne and used too much so I added 1/3 more cream. And Instead of plain horseradish I used Emeril's seriously kicked up horseradish mustard. Used 2 fresh green onions, don't skimp! 
This was so good I only ate half the loin and used up all the sauce. So double it!

This is wonderful!! Of course when Chef John said he made it in culinary school I didn't have any doubts!  My tenderloin was HUGE so I baked about 10 mins longer til 160 on the thermometer and it was perfect, just like the photos with pink in the center and you could cut it with a fork.  Kinda doubled the sauce, didn't have quite enough horseradish (but next time I will) and used half/half  I had on hand instead of cream. I salted my meat and it wasn't too salty at all - just right!  Also cut back the cayenne to about 3/4 amount called for.  Used my caphalon oven going non stick skillet and finally got some fond towards the end of cooking.  I think next time (although there will be an extra pan to wash) I will brown in one pan and finish in a metal backing pan that I can still make the sauce in on the stove top.  My husband & I both loved this recipe - my sauce was a little runny but we eagerly dipped our meat in the extra ---- new favorite!  Thank you Chef John

Really good. Changed nothing except I had to add a bit more chicken broth to the sauce as it thicken up a bit too much.  Really tasty sauce. Will be repeating this often as I'm also a big fan of this cooking method.  Very tender and tasty pork.

Had a tenderloin in the fridge for dinner, apprehensive to make it because they are always dry!  Searched for good tips here at Allrecipes.  I used this cooking style, but (ha ha) actually got mixed up and had started marinating under "Easy Marinated Pork Tenderloin" recipe found below.  My marinade included: soy sauce, dijon mustard, honey mustard, a wee bit o extra honey, oil.  After the 2 hours I let it sit in the fridge, I followed THIS recipe. Pan seared in hot oil (spit a lot, from soy sauce??) , turned over and put in oven with 1/2 of the rest of the marinade, cooked just until 145,  and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!  Most assuredly the best tenderloin I have ever made!!
  While it was resting, I used the drippings in the pan to make a sauce, (no draining the fat for me!), added some milk, boiled and whisked several minutes until reduced ,  then including the butter at the end........ SO GOOD!!!!
I hope you try this recipe, my whole family adored it!!

Here's the other recipe I started from!!  LOL!!

This was delicious! I used vegetable stock as that's what I had on hand. For the same reason, used a small amount of dried chives mixed into the sauce as it cooked. Turned out great! "As always", Thanks, Chef John!!!

I love pork tenderloin and always enjoy finding new ways to prepare it.  WE LOVED THIS RECIPE. I didn't use spicy horseradish and decreased the cayenne a bit for our child but no other changes.  Delicious sauce.  Word to the wise:  remember that skillet is HOT AS HELL after you bring it back to the stove top!  DOH!

Very tasty. Accompanied with sweet potato mash. Great salty/sweet combo. A little spicy for my 10 yr old but others enjoyed it. Made with 2% milk instead of heavy cream.

I followed the recipe exactly!  It was delicious.  I DID burn my hand on the skillet handle after I took it out of the oven. I was distracted after I set it on the stove and then went to move it to make the sauce.   Make sure to use pot holders at all times! :-)

This is probably the 5th or 6th time I've made this recipe. I recommend it to friends all the time when they ask "what should I make for dinner tonight?" I own a salon so that question actually comes up a lot haha. Watch the salt is my only tip. Between the actual salt and the sauce it can be quite salty. Less is more here. This is an amazing recipe ! Mashed potatoes, roasted veggies or even white cheddar macaroni are great sides.

Method for cooking the pork was spot on, but the sauce wasn't appreciated by my family.  Just tasted like dijon and horseradish (duh!) :)

I'm glad I read some of the reviews first and didn't salt the meat before browning. Only drawback was there wasn't enough sauce.

This pork tenderloin is absolutely wonderful. Fortunately I had cream on hand and horseradish, which I don't usually, and that allowed me to make this dish. The other ingredients are usually in my fridge and garden. (BTW I omitted the cayenne, just because I expected the horseradish to add enough heat.) I browned the tenderloin in my iron skillet which transfers easily to the oven.  The directions were easy to follow and the pork was cooked perfectly.

I made this recently and my husband and I loved it.  It was easy to prepare, and cooking the tenderloin this way was pretty quick.  The sauce was sufficient for the amount prepared and it had flavor and a little heat.  Getting ready to make it again for "Tasty Tuesday" at work; I'm going to cook it tonight and reheat it tomorrow on low in my crockpot along with the sauce.

Horseradish is too powerful for my family, so I omitted it and then doubled the whole recipe.  It was still an  A++ from my family of 6.

I'll confess that I followed the recipe to the letter, but I didn't get a nice crust like Chef John... I didn't have any chives, no biggie. After searing, I turned the tenderloin as directed and placed slices of orange on the bottom of my pan and roasted the meat on these. It added just a hint of sweetness but did not deter from the heat. I used regular horseradish as this is what I had on hand; it was 'diablo' enough for us :) We both loved it, and will be making it again very soon. Thanks Chef John, the video helped!

This was simply fantastic!  I made it as-written with the exception of regular horseradish instead of extra hot. It it came out just right. Plenty of tang in the sauce but not overpowering. This is now my favorite pork tenderloin recipe and I will be making it often in the future.

Great recipe!  I didn't change a thing except to double all the sauce ingredients except the horse radish since my hubby is a sauce fanatic.  I did read to watch out for the salt amount and used low sodium chicken broth. Thanks!

A-mazing! As written, the technique is fool-proof for tender, nearly fork-tender meat. The sauce is heavenly!  Thank you for another "keeper"!

UPDATE: Since making this recipe last, (due to poor planning on my part), I substituted sour cream for heavy cream and added dried sage with fantastic results!  You can always appreciate a recipe that allows for versatility.  Thank you again!

This is fabulous! Followed recipe exactly, we loved the flavor. Very way to make and the pork was cooked perfectly. I think next time I'll use regular horseradish, I don't think extra hot is necessary.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious. To my surprise, it wasn't hot, just full of flavor. My kids and non-pork loving husband really enjoyed it. I will make again.

I made the sauce for some pork leftovers that I had in the fridge. It was spectacular! The kids said it reminded them of KFC gravy. The only change I made was to use Pork stock instead of chicken.

Never cooked a loin of pork before this. I found it so successful I went out and bought a pan I could sear the pork in on the cooktop and then place directly in the oven. I've cooked this half a dozen times now and it's my standard dinner when we have guests. About to cook it for a midweek meal and serve with cauliflower and Parmesan cous cous. Genuinely surprised some people didn't like the sauce but not everyone likes spicy food so that could be it?

We loved this sauce and thought it was fantastic but I just had regular horseradish, not "extra hot". The only reason I only gave this four stars was because the sauce didn't thicken for me. It had reduced a lot over about 15-20 minutes and still wasn't getting even remotely thick. In desperation (since everything else was ready) I added a flat teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in a little water and that  did the trick. I will be making this again for sure - but with the cornstarch.

absolutely delicious!! First time i made it with tenderloins and I had to add a little Cajun seasoning that I had on hand.( I thought we had Cayenne Pepper)  I thought that was delicious until the second time I made it  with a roast pork Loin and I had bought the Cayenne Pepper!!!!!  OMG get the Cayenne Pepper.. This will be made often in our house.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce since the roast was bigger.... not a problem, you can't get enough of it.

I loved this one. I added crushed garlic and seasoned the pork by rubbing in a seasoning used for prime rib. I also added a couple of tablespoons of flour to thicken the sauce a bit.

Very good and my picky husband liked it.  He was drizzling the sauce on his green beans.  Next time I would use less cayenne pepper or not use it at all.  I will make this again.

Loved this recipe! Quick and easy. Hot but not overly spicy. Might add a touch less horseradish or a little more cream to temper the horseradish. Added 1/4tsp cornstarch to the chicken stock to thicken sauce a bit more

I made this for my sister and law and myself - using a 1.5 packaged tenderloin.  I followed the receipe with a couple of exceptions.  First - I never salt meat before cooking it - I was taught that salt before cooking leeches out juices and I have HBP.   I used half and half instead of heavy cream, but used one tablespoon more.  I cut the fillet as shown by the video - the next time I will slice it thinner.  Finally, my chives are a bit skimpy, so I used some chives and some green onion tops.  I also used a chicken boullion cube for the chicken stock.   Excellent.  Served with steamed asparagas and doctored store bought potato salad.

This is a nice, easy meal to make. I made it with new potatoes and Brussels sprouts having them all coming out of the oven at the same time. Good meat with loads of flavor. Thank you Chef John. I plan to put this one in my recipe card file as a keeper!

This is an excellent sauce but I have to confess, I made a few changes.  I don't have a stove to oven skillet so I used a Corning Ware dish to brown the meat in and finished cooking it in the oven.  I made the sauce in a saucepan while the meat was cooking.  I increased the broth to 1 cup.   I didn't have heavy cream on hand so substituted it with 1%  milk, made a flour roux & added it with a few shakes of cayenne & omitted the salt.  I reduced the sauce and let it simmer while the meat was cooking & resting.   Absolutely delicious!

Another Chef John home run.

Such a simple yet delicious sauce.  I was having comfort food cravings and made a side of macaroni and cheese.  They went together so well that I'd suggest that others pair this easy pork dish with a cheesy side dish.

I thought I had a pork tenderloin, but when unwrapped, I had a pork loin instead.  I cut it in half lengthwise and proceeded on anyway.  We liked this very much and the pan sauce was good...even though I forgot the  butter in the end!  Oh well, it was still good despite the missing butter.  I'm sure I'll make it again some day.

This tenderloin recipe was a hit with my entire family and I will make it again and again.  Not only was it tender, juicy and delicious, it was easy to make.  I used a 2 lb. tenderloin and therefore increased the baking time to 35 minutes, but I left the sauce recipe as written.  It was perfect; just enough to enhance the flavor of the meat without overpowering it.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use reduced sodium broth and unsalted butter to cut down on salt.  The salt and pepper on the tenderloin was all that was needed.

This is an awesome recipe that I now make over & over. I like to double the sauce... it is soooo yummy over side dishes, too!

Just made it and only changed things a little.
Didn't salt & pepper before hand and didn't miss it.  Thanks everyone for that tip.
Also used fat free condensed milk not heavy cream and sauce was just yummy!
We loved it.

DH loved this.  The pork was super tender and the sauce heavenly.  The only thing we would do different next time is....DOUBLE the sauce.  Fairly skimpy on the pork portion, but still delicious.  Thanks for another great recipe.

I forgot to salt the pork but sauce was great and simple to make!  My kids would never eat the sauce (3 and 5 yr olds) but hubbie and I loved it.  Every Chef John recipe I've made has been great, thank you!!!

Very good way to make a pork tenderloin.  Don't be afraid to try it with beef broth as well.  This turned out great!

We grilled the pork tenderloin with Salt, Pepper and oil.  Made the sauce separately in a saucepan.  Doubled the sauce recipe since our tenderloin was almost 5 lbs.  Really tasty!  Zesty!  Spicy!  The cayenne gives it an extra ka-pow!  Would be a good sauce on beef as well.

Dynamite recipe.  I made it exactly as directed, except doubling the sauce and adding sauted mushrooms at the end.  It's a flavor explosion that  has just the right amount of heat.  
Good job!

I loved this recipe. The reason for my 4 stars is that as others mentioned the spicy ingredients mask the flavor of the pork. I proceeded to make it again and used no horseradish and half of the cayenne pepper. It still came out a bit spicy but much better.  After this modification, you could really notice the flavors of both the sauce (especially the dijon mustard) and the pork. Yum!

Very good. As Baking Nana suggested, I omitted the salt before searing the pork. It was plenty salty without the added salt (I used regular broth). I also added dried - not fresh - chives to the sauce along with the butter. Yummy and easy to make.

Be sure not to put the pork tenderloin juice back into the pan as it makes the sauce too runny.  Very tasty otherwise

I did not make the pork tenderloin, however,  I did use the delicious sauce when I made pork chops. Highly recommended for pork chops as well! Just use your imagination.

Delightful recipe! Due to food allergies I substituted coconut cream for the dairy and eliminated the cayenne.  Still loaded with favor and the pork was very tender and perfectly done. Extra sauce would be nice so I may make more next time.

Simply amazing results.  I used my head and seasoned to taste, meaning I held back on the salt only using a small amount till the end.

The whole family, including the teenagers, loved this recipe - the sauce is delicious! I was in a hurry so I sliced the pork loin, lightly seasoned with salt and pepper and fried in butter in a cast iron pan, then removed the meat and kept it warm while I quickly made the sauce and served with boiled potatoes and a crispy salad. Will definitely make again.

I really liked this recipe and will make it again - but will omit the butter, because I found that it makes it too salty. I tasted the sauce before the butter and it was delicious - next time I'll stop there!

I used this recipe as a starting point for oven roasted pork tenderloin with mustard sauce. I used the same method to cook the pork, but being distracted while preparing the sauce caused me to burn my hand on the pan twice, so pay attention! 
The sauce I made was similar, but different: 
I doubled the recipe and substituted half and half for heavy cream. 

Did not add prepared horseradish, instead I used Coop's Horseradish mustard, which I already had for sandwiches.

I also used low sodium chicken broth, and I think it would have been too salty if I had not. 

The pork was the star of the dish, the sauce was a nice accent over the pork. 

I also made oven roasted red potatoes, with olive oil, garlic salt, black pepper, and rosemary. They cooked on a low rack at 375 while the pork was finishing up and I prepared the sauce. About 30 minutes total made them firm on the outside and creamy on the inside. We also had asparagus, steamed.

This meal was delicious and I'll be making it again for my in-laws!

This was excellent! Made this for New Year's Day. Made recipe how it was written (always do the first time) & it was delicious. I used low sodium chicken broth (was all I had and after reading some reviews, was glad I did) & next time I will leave the salt off the pork. The sauce was so good, perfect.  Just used bit less cayenne. I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent and quick. Did not have chives and substituted beef broth for chicken as that is what I had. I was surprised at how juicy this was. I browned the tenderloins (I cut mine into two pieces to fit in my cast iron skillet) and took it out after 23 minutes when they hit 145. I do agree this was a bit salty, and I love salt. I'd not salt the meat next time. Great with green beans and Parmesan noodles.

This is my absolute go to recipe for a special meal.  My guests love this and I'm always asked for the recipe.  I would adjust the horseradish and cayenne to suit your guests but I usually use the full amount.  Anything Chef John makes is awesome.  This guy can cook.  Absolutely love this recipe.

The sauce is a little salty as others have stated. I would recommend using low sodium chicken stock and using half or less of the salt. otherwise it was quite delicious.

Good way to cook the pork. The sauce was a little too intense with horseradish and mustard. Might lighten up on those ingredients next time.

This pork was yummy! I cook with pork tenderloin a lot and am always looking for something to add variety to the rotation. I subbed using what I already had on hand; I didn't have horseradish but love a spicy kick so added some hot pepper sauce. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and green onions instead of chives. I baked in the oven until the temperature read 137 (15-20 minutes) and let it rest on the counter loosely tented in foil, while I made the sauce. The temperature comes up about 145 degrees while resting. I will definitely make this again using the horseradish. Thanks, Chef John!  05/04/17 Edit: I have since made this many times, using chives and horseradish. I do like the horseradish better than the hot pepper sauce, mostly because of the prettier colour on the sauce but I prefer green onions to chives for the added crunchy texture.

My husband requests this every other week. We mealprep, so we make 3 lbs and divide it into 8 meals. We use paprika and chili powder instead of cayenne and add little white wine to the chicken broth.

This was THE best pork recipe I have ever cooked in my 66 years.  I upped very slightly, the amount of Dijon mustard and whole cream.  My wife could not believe how wonderful the sauce tasted. Nor could I.  Do not overlook the pork.  Take it out at 140 and let it rest covered while you make the sauce.

Delicious!! And it doesn't take long to prepare; much easier than a recipe that needs to marinate and just as tasty. I was hesitant about the extra hot horseradish, but it's probably fine for most people.

John, John, John. A gastronomic symphony. Just lovely!  The flavor pallet is exquisite.  I did this in the summer so I cut thick filets and grilled them on high heat for just a few minutes each side-browned on the outside, pink on the inside. No need to change a thing with the sauce. Thank you!!

This was a hit with the whole family. My husband even used extra horseradish on his portion. I've been making a lot of pork tenderloins lately because they are on sale often at our store. I've tried several recipes and they often include apples and/or apple juice and we just haven't cared for those. I do cook it until the internal temp is closer to 160, but it is still juicy and can be cut with a fork. It's a new favorite.

This was fabulous.  Made for my husbands B-day and he was in heaven.  Followed recipe exactly except for chives cuz I didn't have these.  Pork was perfectly cooked in 25 minutes.  Made in my cast iron skillet, so easy to clean-up.  But yeah, watch out for the hot handle when you are making the sauce.  Also will skip the salt on pork next time.  Even with low sodium chicken broth it was a little salty. Had a small package of fresh shitaki mushrooms which I just threw in the skillet whole after browning the pork and they were really delicious.  Served with baked red potatoes and a spinach salad with dried cranberries, candied pecans and goat cheese.  Really nice pairing.  Thank you Chef John for another great, amazingly fast and easy meal.

This was amazing! The pork was perfectly cooked and the sauce was, indeed, devilish! Several days later, hubby asked me to make just the sauce again to use as a spread on his sandwiches. Very good! I was out of horseradish, but I did have horseradish mustard. That might work better for those who aren't as keen on horseradish. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will definitely make the trip to the store for the horseradish.

Super simple and just delicious.  I did what others suggested and omitted salting the pork loin.  Delicious as a leftover eaten cold with the sauce warmed.

We thought this was wonderful. The pork was so tender and juicy. Only change I'd make in the future is to cut the cayenne amount in half -- we love hot foods but that was just a little too much lingering heat on the tongue. 6/4/15 Edit: added photo.

I gave this 5 stars for ease, flavor and technique.  Chef John is GREAT at explaining how to make something and really is very easy to follow along.  The only thing I would change about this is the amount of horseradish, even though I love horseradish it was too strong for me, (and I just used prepared horseradish not extra hot like Chef did) I would cut to half because for me (personal preference) I felt it took over the flavor and I couldn't taste everything else.  I do like to taste all ingredients.  still a great recipe.  I would also suggest using a meat thermometer that you can leave in while cooking.  I was shocked at how fast this cooked in the oven.  I took it out at 140 degrees covered and let rest for about 7 or 8 mins while finishing the sauce.  The temp came up to 151 before it stopped and started dropping.  It was perfectly cooked!

Just finished dinner and everyone loved it! Just a few tweaks per other reviews and used 1/2 & 1/2 b/cuz that's what I had on hand. Used a pkg'd tenderloin-contained 2 tenderloin and together almost 2 lbs. 
Cooked meat as directed. I  tripled sauce but only doubled cayenne pepper and that was plenty-we like spicy and dishes with a kick but glad I just doubled cayenne. Added 1tablespoon of cornstarch to the 1/2 & 1/2 and whisked that into sauce...came out perfect. Not too thin and not too thick. oh, and didn't add chives only because I didnt have them, but would have liked to use as it adds such a nice touch.
Served with wild rice and snap peas- great dinner and oh so easy. Will definitely keep on my "favorite dinner" list. Next time will serve with egg noodles or another small pasta. Delish.

My go-to recipe for pork tenderloin used sage rub and a maple syrup glaze so I wasn't sure how I'd like this.  It. Was. Delicious.  Better than I expected, I guess because I thought the sauce would need something sweet.  Only thing I added were some sauteed shallots to the sauce.  Thanks Chef John!

The pork tenderlion was fabulous - restaurant quality.  Great way to cook the tenderloin.  Just be careful not to overdo the spices in the Diablo sauce, it gets HOT quickly!

This was amazing! I used chipotle chile pepper instead of cayenne and it was excellent.  I do agree with other reviewers on the salt, don't over salt your meat of the sauce will get too salty.

This was amazing! My husband is not a fan of horseradish but he loved this sauce - it's a nice, smooth and creamy blend of flavors and neither the horseradish nor the mustard overpower - I doubled the recipe and had not a drop left over! As others have mentioned, it's not necessary to salt the tenderloin. Thanks, Chef John!

This was good.  I overcooked the pork a tad but that is not the recipe's fault.  The sauce is good AND I forgot to put the butter in it (DOH!)  Other than forgetting that the only things I changed was I used half and half instead of heavy cream because that is what I had and I don't know where to get extra hot horseradish so just used regular prepared horseradish.  The flavor was very good even without the butter, but I will be adding it next time :-)

I love this easy recipe.  I did skip the cayenne and extra butter.  Watch the salt content on the chicken broth in addition to salty mustard.  Creamy delicious sauce.

muy delicioso! I had to alter slightly due to a couple of ingredients not on hand (had packs of Arby's Horsey Sauce I had to use)but it was superb.  Even my picky teenager liked it!

5 Stars on the sauce alone. It was delicious, tangy, and very smooth all at once, and paired with the meat very well. I prepared this for my wife and family on Mothers Day and everyone enjoyed it. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. Thanks Chef John! I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh corn. I'm anxious to see what else I can use the sauce with.

The pork preparation is simple and fool proof. Seriously, if you can make fried eggs you can cook the pork. Just remember to remove the silver skin on your pork before cooking. 

Now the sauce. We only have regular, not extra hot, horseradish, so we used that. And since I don't care for too much hot in my food, it was just perfect. This part of the recipe is all technique. You REALLY need to cook that sauce down to get the flavors to meld. If you don't and you'll get a watery mess for sauce. Then you add the cold butter at the end and the chives. 

I LOVED the sauce. HOWEVER, I personally found the recipe makes too little sauce for our tastes, as we like to eat this with crusty bread and so we've doubled the sauce every time we've made it after the first time. 

The is a fabulous and easy weeknight meal, when you want something amazing but don't want to slave over a stove for more than 15 minutes!

ummm,yeah, loved it. We cut the cayenne in half the second time (a little spicy for the kids) and added some veggies (green onions, shaved carrots, and mushrooms glazed over high heat, in olive oil)to the mix.

had to substitute chicken soup for the broth and extra mustard for the horseradish (apparently I wasn't paying attention at the store) but thought it was delicious.

For the very first time I tried a new recipe on a dinner guest.  We both love the ingredients separately so when I saw this I had to try it.  It went over superbly.  Loved the aftertaste!  I always use a meat thermometer so the pork was done perfectly.

This was really good.  I am not a fan of mustard so I did omit it.  I added fresh thinly sliced mushrooms when I was making the sauce.  The sauce was delicious and I will certainly make this one again.  Very easy and quick!

First time using this method of cooking for a pork tenderloin. Loved it! No plans on using any other way of cooking it from now. The Dijon sauce was excellent. No complaints on spice level here in our house.

Not sure what went wrong with this recipe. I have tried a lot of Chef John's recipe and have loved them all. This one turned out a little bland, but could be because I was in a rush.

This was so good! I loved that I was able to use the same cast-iron skillet for the whole process so there was minimal cleanup. I think next time I will double the sauce recipe because we liked it so much.

added sliced mushrooms and onion and 1TB chopped garlic.
Didn't have cayenne, so used some creole seasoning, doubled the heavy cream, and added 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end.  It was delicious.

LOVE it! I do agree with the other comments on salting the meat as I too felt it would be to much with the sauce. But other then that it's perfect! Meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very easy to make. This one is a keeper!

OMG this is so good.  I have made it 4 or 5 times now.  I do make double the sauce because it is so delicious.

I rarely ever add as much salt as the recipe calls for.

So good!  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for except that I tripled everything and used lactose free heavy cream.
My family was crazy about it!!  The meat was moist and tender and the flavour of the sauce was amazing.  I was worried it would be too hot with all that horseradish, but it wasn't.  Such an interesting flavour. 
Perfect!

Followed recipe except I used dried chives instead of fresh.  It was delicious and easy. Great for a weekday meal and for weekend indulgence.  The pork was tender and juicy and the sauce flavorful with a small kick.  Next time I made it I added dried tarragon (1/2 tsp).  This made it even better.  Thank you Chef John!

This is the most perfect pork tenderloin I have ever made and the family loved it!  Don't be afraid of the extra hot horseradish....the cream and butter mellow the heat and the result is amazing.  A family favorite, for sure!  Thanks, Chef John!

Absolutely amazing!!  In our little home-town store I couldn't find a plain one, just marinated or peppercorn.  So I got the peppercorn one and eliminated the salt and pepper seasoning.  No need for a knife...it was fork tender and nothing short of 'splendiferous'!!!

I rate this a 5, even though on my plate, it was a 3.5. But that was fully my fault! I dig on horseradish and dijon. I was a little heavy handed when adding them into the sauce. But I could tell, had I done it right, it would've been a complete winner!! I will do it right next time and enjoy it much more, I'm sure. Oh, and the cooking time, nailed it!! It was perfect. Chef John hasn't led me astray yet. LOL

I absolutely loved the sauce.  The ratio of ingredients gave it just the right taste!  When the sauce cooled, it had the consistency of a sandwich spread.  AMAZING!  I made cold pork sandwiches for a week.  I used four pounds of prime pork loin so I just multiplied the recipe by 4 and had plenty of sauce.  Very simple to make.

This is a fab recipe.  I'm a novice in the kitchen and it still turned out great.  My tenderloin was a little bigger so I cooked mine about 30 minutes.  I didn't have any cayenne and didn't miss it.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was excellent and as promised, easy! The sauce was perfect. I made it for 6 of us so used 3 loins.  
The only change I made was I omitted the broth because I had enough liquid in the pan after roasting. Thickened up nicely with the cream and dab of butter made it velvety. Thanks Chef John!

The sauce is delicious.  Was wanting to change up some boneless pork chops and found this recipe.  I didn't have cream either so I used whole milk.  This was a nice change and there were no leftovers.

This  one is a 4.5 star for me.  Loved the cooking method!  Best thing is the pork and or the sauce could easily be interchanged with other meats or sauces.  It's a keeper!  I served with sides of quinoa and green beans.  Sauce was good on the quinoa too!  Quick, easy , yummy meal!  Can hardly wait for the leftovers!  Good job Chef John!

I'm not a pork fan but this dish is outstanding. I left out the horseradish but the sauce was still plenty "diablo" for our tastes. Next time I'll double it. This method of cooking pork is amazing. Juicy and so tender you can cut it with a fork. Chef John, you are tops!

Just Made it for my hubby for dinner.  I browned the pork tenderloin in a butter olive oil mix then removed it from the pan.  (While the meat was browning I mixed up the chicken broth, mustard, horseradish plus 1/2 cup of white wine)  I de-glazed the pan with this mixture and added the tenderloin back to the pan to continue to cook on low heat, 12 minutes (approx) per side.  I then took the pork out and tented it for 5 minutes and added the butter and cream.  I checked the sauce for flavour and ended up adding a tiny bit more mustard, horseradish and wine to freshen up those flavours.  I added the chives and served.  My hubby loved it!

Made this tonight and really enjoyed it. I mistakenly bought beef broth instead of chicken but the sauce still tasted wonderful. Will definitely make this again in the near future with the chicken broth to see what difference there is in the sauce.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner.  My husband said it was the best meal ever.  We had to restrain ourselves from eating it all.  I used a 2 pound tenderloin and doubled all ingredients and cooking time.  I will definitely share with friends.

I followed the recipe to the letter, except I could not find the cayenne pepper at the last moment!  I had some green peppercorns that I use for a beef tenderloin recipe and decided to add them.  The sauce and pork was awesome and the tenderloin is fork tender. I served it with perogies boiled then drizzled with olive oil, fesh cracked pepper and salt and grilled asparagus wrapped with prosciutto and drizzled with olive, oil and lemon juice.  The meal was under $30 but felt like fine dining. Can't give enough praise.

I make this all the time. My family loves it. The only change I make is to double the sauce because I use 2lbs of tenderloin (it comes packaged that way). Sometimes I don't have chives. I've used green onions which work too.
I serve it with egg noodles and roasted asparagus or broccoli. It's good with roasted red potatoes too.
It's definitely part of our regular menu!

This was very good! I had a 4lb tenderloin so I tripled the sauce. I did only use 1/3 of the cayenne because my family doesn't like "heat" too much (also used standard creamy horseradish). The sauce was very good, but my duaghter is not a mustard fan so I served it on the side. Half of us loved the sauce, other halt (the ones that don't like mustard) didn't care for the sauce. I did have to cook my tenderloin about 15-20 mins longer due to it's size, so plan according to the size of your tenderloin so your sides dont get cold waiting for the meat to reach 145-150 degrees. The tenderloin is wonderful prepared this way and you can use one of Chef John's other pan sauces if you want. Thanks again for another great recipe Chef John!

I made this last night as a birthday dinner for my father and I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful! Smokey, creamy, and just the right amount of spice. Everyone loved it and I will def be making again soon and trying the sauce on chicken, beef, etc.

Made this last night and everyone (kids included) devoured it!  The pork is tender and juicy and the sauce is amazing. After reading other reviews I also tripled the amount of sauce... will make this again and again.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I tried this with a regular pork loin and I also tried it with pork chops.  This sauce is so easy and good it's my new favorite for pork!  Be sure to double the sauce because you're going to want plenty.  It goes great next to garlic mashed potatoes!  LOVE IT and you will TOO!

This is one of my family's most favorite recipes. Even my two year old son loves it! The sauce is so delicious, and pork comes out of the oven picture perfect every single time. I use coconut oil instead of olive oil, but other than that, everything else is the same. So yum!
