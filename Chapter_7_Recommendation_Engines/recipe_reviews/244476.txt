YUMMO! A good way to kick it up a notch! My husband loves fried egg sandwiches. I mixed the Cajun seasoning, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise and hot sauce (siracha) together. It was easier to spread on the bread.

This was good. I used Dijon mustard, and doubled the sauce components, except for the ketchup. I used almost a 1/2 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning along with 4 dashes of hot sauce (Franks). I prepared the sauce ahead of time and sit in the fridge. Used a slice of rye(toasted)and had my sandwich open faced with some cheddar, Monterey jack cheese, and a sprinkle of green onion. Enjoyed this fork and knife style, like an eggs benedict.
