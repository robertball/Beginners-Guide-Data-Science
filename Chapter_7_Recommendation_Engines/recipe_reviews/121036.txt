After reading all the reviews, I decided to add 1/4 cup more cocoa (3/4 cup total), decreased flour to 2 1/4 cups, increased choc.chips to 1 cup. I mixed choc chips in the flour/cocoa mixture before mixing wet ingred. with dry ingred. The choc. chips did not sink to the bottom. The muffins were done @18-19 minutes (pull them out a minute or so early, then they don't become dry).  These are additive, moist, sweet enough and chocolatey enough. Thanks Nellie!!

I broke my own rule of baking per recipe the first time, before making it my own through changes in technique and substitutions. I replaced 1/2 c of the white sugar with dark brown sugar to add moisture and give the chocolate a little extra pop. I added the sugars to the wet mixture. I replaced a 1/4 of flour with cocoa. Instead of water and milk, I used almond milk. I also added almond extract along with the vanilla, and topped each muffin with slivered almonds before baking, which added a sweet crunch to the finished product. I preheated the oven to almost 400 degrees and then turned the temp down to 325 when I put the pans in the oven to get that initial steam build-up for more height. Love this recipe!

My kids LOVED them.  I used whole wheat flour and left out the chocolate chips to make them healthier for breakfast and served with fruit.  My daughter said, "Mom, you did a GOOD JOB on these!"  Maybe it was my changes, but don't fill the cups too full or it runs over the edge when it cooks instead of puffing up more.  Still a hit and will keep the recipe.  Next time I will try dried cranberries instead of chocolate chips. Thanks!

This muffin is AWESOME!!! Although  some alterations have been made due to human errors they are so minimal that it's almost insignificant 1)1 extra teaspoon heaped cocoa powder 2)2 extra teaspoons of sour cream 3)a lot more chocolate chips, so much that i can't remember =p anyway this is a recipe that worth a thumb up.

These are moist, rich, and best of all - EASY!  These will be my new cupcake recipe.  I used decaf espresso in place of water to give them a little oomph.  Thanks for a great recipe!

After reading all the reviews and my own alterations, I don't think you can ruin these muffins.  I added grated zucchini, whole wheat flour, walnuts, flax, oat bran, coffee (no water), and apple sauce (no oil).  I even added a little orange rind. They were still light and fluffy.

Amazing!!  I made these into mini loaves and they turned out great.  I used half brown sugar/half white sugar, double the chocolate chips, and substituted some white flour with wheat flour to make dense muffins.

I think people gave it a good ratings because they added too much chocolate chip so they didn't notice the taste or the texture of the muffins. I added more cocoa powder as recommended (3/4 )and reduced the flour to (2 1/4) , it wasn't chocolaty enough besides it wasn't very moist , just dense . any way if you are looking for a bakery style muffins this is not the right recipe for you .

A truly great muffin.  We are definitely chocolate lovers here, and this was a great treat for my guys for breakfast this morning.  My son (not a big breakfast eater) inhaled 3 of these, without apology.   I used all White Whole Wheat flour, 2 eggs (for half recipe), and plain nonfat yogurt for the sour cream.  As usual when baking w/whole wheat flour I prepped my batter the night before, and baked in the morning.  Along with speeding up morning prep time, allowing it to sit overnight helps this muffin to bake up and taste more like it's traditional white flour counterparts.  I got about 10 good sized muffins from half the original recipe (since you typically fill the muffin cups a bit more full when dealing w/wheat flour).  These were more like a cupcake than an actual muffin, lol, but making them whole grain helped them to be as nutritious as the were delicious.

I found this recipe while trying to recreate the cupcakes that are sold locally as a gourmet item for more than $3 each. The particular cupcake I wanted to duplicate was dense and dry like a muffin, and quite small, but covered with decorative mounds of delicious frosting dwarfing the cake.   I selected this recipe from among those I found online after reading the reviews.  I used the modifications suggested by JeaNeeNer, increasing the cocoa and chips, and decreasing the flour.  I also am in the habit of substituting melted butter for oil in cake mix cakes, and did so in this recipe instinctively.  I liked CookinginFL's idea of baking them in jumbo muffin pans and decided to do so.   After I filled my jumbo cups, I had a lot of batter left, so I poured it into 5 ungreased (oops!) standard muffin pans.  CookinginFL did not give an adjusted baking time for the jumbos, and they were clearly far from done when the small ones were due to come out.  I left the jumbos in 10 more minutes and they looked ok, but  they sank in the middle as they cooled and were gooey. Aside from being stuck to the pan, the small muffins were good!   Trying again, but: I am sticking with my use of butter in place of oil,  I will adjust the cocoa and flour per JeaNeeNer's recommendation,  I don't think I will increase the chips, which settled out, and will probably use mini morsels in the hope of getting a more even distribution of chocolate.   I'll use standard pan w/liners.

These are awesome.   I increased the cocoa to 3/4 cup and decreased the flour by 1/4 cup to get a richer chocolate taste.  I also only used 2 eggs because that is all I had.  I frosted some of these with a peanut butter frosting but I think I prefer them plain.  Thanks for a yummy recipe.

If you are expecting a bakery style muffin, you will be disappointed. This muffin basically tastes like devils food cake with chocolate chips in it. I think many of the reviewers failed to notice the bland texture since they doubled the amount of chocolate chips. I was disappointed with this muffin, it's really more of a cupcake than a muffin & didn't satisfy my craving for a chocolate muffin.

I love these. So wonderful! I had to leave out the egg (I didn't tell my husband I wanted to make muffins and he made us breakfast with the last couple) but had everything else. It still turned out perfectly. I can't wait to make these and mail them to my family back home!! Thank you so much for the recipe.

My daughter had made them for fun and they did not taste good, we followed some of the reviews and it tasted to much like vegetableoil. We did not like them at all. We only have one star because when they came out they looked very good but they did not taste how they looked.

I thought this recipe was so-so. The flavor was excellent, but I thought the texture was too much like a cupcake and less like a muffin.

My youngest daughter said yesterday that what she'd really like was a chocolate muffin loaded with chocolate chips. I decided to make these for her. I subbed plain yogurt for the sour cream and didn't measure the chocolate chips, just threw in 2 bags. These are a lovely soft chocolatey muffin with a slightly crunchy top. Both daughters love them. Thank you.

These were great!  I must admit, I didn't have any sour cream, but did have applesauce, so I used that.  They were super!  Usually recipes call for applesauce *in place of* oil, but this one called for both (at least as originally written).  I followed everything else as written.  I filled the muffins almost full, and they baked up perfectly - didn't overflow at all.  Mine didn't need baking more than 20 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!

These a great, moist muffins. The only change I made was to add a full cup of chocolate chips. Just ate two and trying my best not to go in the kitchen for more. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

To make this healthier for breakfast I use yogurt instead of sour cream, apple sauce instead of oil, almond milk instead of cows milk and I halve the sugar amount. I also use this batter to make waffles in the waffle iron. I let the kids dip waffles in whip cream. These muffins are so soft and gooey, they are delicious.

Not bad! It was a touch bland and the actual muffin part could have been more chocolatey but they were moist, quick to throw together and pretty tasty. I halved the recipe, using 2 eggs, and it worked great. I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate, which I guess is why I wanted the cakey part to be a little more chocolately - I suppose I could have used some choc chips and some peanut butter. The PB chips were good in them though, especially when warm and melty. I'd make this recipe again.

One of the best recipes I have tried from this site! I have to make a quick breakfast for 3 teenagers every morning before school/work. With this recipe, I can make about 27 regular size muffins. I used 1 cup applesauce instead of the sour cream. Also cut back a little on the flour and added about 1/4 more cocoa. They are outstanding. I also sprinkle the tops with a few chocolate chips before baking and use about 1 cup of chips in the batter. Makes them look and taste better. Before this recipe, I was using the prepackaged muffin mixes. Such a difference with these! They are a little denser and are very filling. I have made this recipe twice in the last 2 weeks and it makes enough for several breakfasts.

THESE are NOM NOM! :) So deliciously moist!  The only changes I made was i only had greek yogurt on hand, not sour cream so I used that and I used all light brown sugar.  Oh and I used dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.  I gave some to my husband to take to work to give to the cops and they loved them too.  :)  Because of the muffin tin I have, this recipe yeilded 14 really huge muffins.

These are fantastic!  My children loved them.  I live in high-altitude Tooele and my oven seems to bake hot, so I reduced the heat to 300 and baked for 22 minutes, they came out perfect!!  I am freezing half the batch for a quick after-school snack for my kids.  I will be making these again...

I was looking for a Chocolate Cherry muffin recipes.  Following the other reviews, and my own tastes, I made the following changes.  Decreased the flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of cocoa. Substituted 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour for some of the white flour. Used 1 cup chopped extra dark chocolate (85%) for the chocolate chips, added one cup dried tart cherries.  Mixed the cherries and chocolate with the dry ingredients.  YUM!  The chocolate and cherries didn't sink, the texture is nice and dense, perfect with a cup of coffee.  Even if you are not a dark chocolate lover I think you will like these.  The addition of the cherries and extra dark chocolate give them some antioxidents!

these are better than i expected them to be, i think this is one of the recipes i'll make over and over again. I used lite sour cream and left the cocoa powder out, cuz i wanted them to just be classic chocolate chip cookies. 
and they taste even better the next day. very recommendable recipe.

These were very good. I  followed the original recipe, with the exception of adding chocolate chips. They turned out light, fluffy, and delicious. I think adding chocolate chips would have made them even better, but they tasted great nonetheless.

It's a keeper!  Purchased some top quality Dutch Cocoa and wanted to experiment with it. 

As other suggested, I used 3/4 cup Cocoa instead of 1/2 cup.
Used 2 1/4 cup Flour instead of 2 2/3 cup.
Used 1/2 cup fresh squeezed orange juice instead of 1/2 cup Water.
Added zested rind from one orange.
Used 1 cup Dark Chocolate Chips.

Actually got 18 muffins.  Thanks for sharing :)

Great recipe, I followed a few of the other reviewers suggestions to get what I was looking for- replaced 1/4c. flour with extra cocoa powder. used 1c. buttermilk instead of milk and water, used 1c. white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar. 
Loved them. 
Thanks for sharing your recipe :)

Absolutely wonderful.  Grandkids and adults alike devoured.  I did (as so many others suggested) increase cocoa to 3/4 cup and decreased our to 2 1/4 cup.  I also added a tsp of coffee extact to enhance flavor a bit  Fantastic.  Made with both chocolate and vanilla chips.

I really didn't like how these turned out. I made them because I had some chocolate chips to use up and figure why not? I made the recipe exactly as written as these came out dense and not especially appealing. These might have been OK if you put some frosting on and called them cupcakes, but as muffins, not so much.

These are really good muffins that bake up beautifully domed on top. Not too sweet, but with a super creamy peanut butter frosting they are a wonderful dessert.

this is a great recipe.  After reading through the reviews, I too decreased the amount of flour slightly (2 1/2 cups) and increased the cocoa to 3/4 cups.  Also, I realized after I started getting all of my ingredients ready that I didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I substituted a 1/2 cup of buttermilk for it (only used a 1/2 cup since buttermilk is obviously more liquid than sour cream).  I don't know if it was the buttermilk, or just ensuring I didn't overmix the batter (just stirred gently by hand until it was barely mixed together), but these muffins were so moist and delicious, I couldn't believe it.  I think next time I'll go back to the buttermilk, I don't think I'll even attempt these with sour cream, they came out that good!

Very easy recipe, I followed other suggestions and decreased the flour and increased the cocoa.  I also used close to a full cup of chips.  In the middle of the recipe, I found that we had run out of milk.  I improvised by adding a bit more sour cream and a splash of coffee liquor (borrowed the idea from my favorite chocolate cake recipe) The results were very muffins that were very moist and cake like.   Made for a special breakfast treat that my kids loved!

Great muffins! I also use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. I added an extra 1/4C. cocoa powder, (didn't omit any flour) and mixed in a TBS of espresso powder in the water. I added about a cup of chips and also a tsp. of chocolate extract for more chocolate flavor.
So with these changes, these muffins were a big hit here!!

These were so delicious!  Based on other reviews, I used 2 1/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup cocoa, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup white sugar, 1 cup chocolate chips, and double strong coffee instead of water.  They didn't have any coffee flavor after they were baked so I'm not sure how much of a difference that made.  However, the muffins were super moist and just chocolately enough without being super sweet.  I don't usually review/rate recipes but I had to for this one!  This recipe will definitely get used a lot.

These were awesome! I did make some adjustments. I switched to yogurt(plain) instead of sour cream, the sugar was reduced to 1/2 cup, and I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar with 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I had 24 cupcakes. I mixed in coconut with the last dozen.

These are good! Moist, fluffy, light, and chocolatey. I don't' really consider them muffins, though. They're very cake-like. They remind me of Duncan Hines cake mix. I'm still looking for that perfect, rich chocolate muffin recipe.

I made these with a cup of fat free yogurt instead of the sour cream. Also, I didn't have chocolate chips so I used Nutella. After filling the muffin cups I dabbed about 1-2 tsp of Nutella on top each muffin, then cut and stirred it in with a butter knife before cooking. I also chopped up some almonds and sprinkled it on top. They turned out moist and delicious. You must be careful not to overcook the muffins because they seemed to dry easy if cooked a little too long. The Nutella can also make the muffins seem like they are not done yet, when they really are.

Made this with some alterations based on other's comments: 2 1/4 cup flour, 3/4 cup cocoa, used brewed and cooled coffee instead of water, used 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 white sugar,1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup butter melted and cooled, and 1 cup chocolate chips. It was very good--more like a cupcake.

We made dark choc cake muffins and used applesauce and a little less sugar.  My family LOVED them.  They could easily pass for cupcakes or dessert muffins (not something I'd serve for nutritional value).  Will make again.

Wow! I read other reviews first and found myself getting a bit confused with all of the substitutions so  I only made the most common change which was to add one additional 1/4 C of cocoa powder. I filled my cups 3/4 full and it made 11 jumbo muffins that are just perfect!

Delicious, very moist muffins, but since I'm vegan and gluten free, I had to replace some of the ingredients. I used 2 1/4 cup of"Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Biscuit and Baking Mix" instead of the all purpose flour. I replaced the three eggs with 3 tablespoons of flaxseed meal soaked in 9 tablespoons of filtered water for five minutes. I used a can of coconut milk instead of the regular milk and sourcream, and I melted 4oz of unsweetened chocolate in 1/2 cup of coconut oil. I also added more chocolate chips that the original recipe calls for. The end result were deliciously moist and chocolaty rich muffins, that my kids and neighbors loved, and now she wants the recipe. This are not guilt free, but surely worthwhile after a busy day.

These muffins were absolutely delicious! They had a cupcake texture to them. They were so moist and I made so many and they were all gone by the end of the night. Best chocolate muffin recipe I've made so far and I did not change a thing. Thank You.

When my 11 y/o daughter asked for chocolate muffins, I found this recipe - after reading everyone's reviews, I decided to give it a whirl.  I had no chocolate chips, so instead, I added an extra 1/4 C of (Hershey's) cocoa powder.  Also, I had no vegetable oil, so I melted Smart Balance to equal the 1/4 C measure.  They came out perfect!  I used plain, lowfat soymilk also.  My daughter drinks vanilla soymilk as her dairy beverage-of-choice, so next time I might try using that, and then skip the vanilla, just to save a step.

Great easy muffins.  I made them last minute and had to substitute low fat plain yogurt for the sour cream and they turned out great.  My only complaint is that they seem s little on the oily side.  1/2 cup of oil seems too much.  I love that they are not too sweet.

These are okay and we'll eat them but I won't make go to the effort to make them again.  Maybe my expectations were too high but we all thought ones I've made from a box were better and much easier.

I downed the baking soda to 1 tsp and used hot cocoa drink mix because I was out of cocoa and so I upped the chocolate (dark chocolate chunks) to 1 cup. Oh yeh we are making these again. Definitely moist!

Very good muffins. Make them much more healthy by using white whole wheat flour. They're very much like a dense, less-sweet cupcake, which was what I wanted. I didn't add chocolate chips since I wanted these to be a sort of healthy breakfast for my kids, not a dessert. I also cut back a little on the sugar and added some liquid Stevia. I thought 325 was too low of a temp. for muffins, so I baked them at 375 for 18 minutes, and they were perfect. Kids liked them! Will keep this recipe. Thanks!

These were ok, much better the next day. They lacked a real chocolately flavor and were a bit dry however the next day they were more moist. I toppped them with sugar crystals to give that nice muffin topping you find on the store muffins. Will probably try again but increase the chocolate and vanilla to give it more flavor.

Very, Very good muffins! I added about 2 tablespoons extra cocoa to make them really chocolatey. I used large muffin pans, which made 12, therefore I increased the baking time by 4 minutes (I have a fan-assisted oven, so a regular oven might even need a little more extra time than that if you are using large muffin cups) and tried white chips. They tasted fantastic. My only problem was that the chips sank to the bottom. But I will still be making these again!

Really delicious. I made them for a brunch with my friends and they were gone by the time everyone left. Would definately make again. I also added a little bit of ground cinnamon, which goes really nicely with chocolate.

I made these again and they are really hard to mess up. After reading the reviews I decided to play a bit. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of buttermilk instead of milk and water and used 3/4 c. of cocoa. Then I added 1/2 c. of white chocolate chips. The recipe made 24 muffins and they came out great. The kitchen smells wonderful. Thank you for a really nice recipe.

Wonderful muffins! They are moist and chocolaty, they taste a bit like cupcakes. They're also great with whipped cream. I used 1 cup of chocolate chips because they needed more, and replaced half of the flour with whole wheat flour and 1/3 sugar with splenda to make them healthier. Great recipe!

Definitly a keeper

These are yummy!  They make alot, so I took the majority to my work & everyone loved them. It wasn't as chocolatey as I had hoped, so next time I'm going to increase the cocoa & try it with the applesauce.  LOVED how moist & light they are.  I just need to tweak a smidge.

I was really disappointed.  They did not have much taste and were kinda rubbery in texture (I may have mixed them too much).  I wish I had seen the suggestions of decreasing the flour and adding cocoa.

SO GOOD.
I did what previous reviewers had done. 
Added 1/2 cup more chocolate chips (so 1 cup total).
Added more cocoa, so 3/4 cup cocoa and decreased flour to 2 1/4 cups. 
Added 1/2 cup brown sugar and just did 1 cup white sugar. 
These were so good! Just what I wanted!

Really good, I did make a few changes to make them a little healthier for breakfast.  I used 2% plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, add 1/2 cup flax seed and replace vegetable oil with coconut oil.  Next time I would like to substitute half the flour with whole wheat, I was out this time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow.  I used one reviewer's advice and replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with 1/4 cup of cocoa powder.  I had no sour cream so I used plain yogurt as a substitute and 1/2 a bag of Andes creme de menth baking chips instead of semi-sweet (it was already open).  Amazing.

Very good. The batter was a little better than the actual muffin. Mini muffins bake at approximately 15 minutes. These muffins took 20 minutes. Next time, I will add more chips and maybe more sugar, salt? I don't know, something is missing. But they are good!

This is an amazing recipe! I followed the other reviewers in regards to less flour more cocoa powder.  I also didn't have any chocolate chips but since its after Halloween I did have a surplus of Hershey bars.  After everything was mixed I discovered my house had been robbed and they only took my muffin papers and muffin tin so I just made them into brownies.  It took about double the time to cook but holy shiz so moist and delicious! Will def. make again!

Fabulous chocolate muffins -    I used  high quality cocoa, more Ghirardella chocolate chips than the recipe asked for, and brewed coffee instead of the water to bring out a more intense chocolate flavor.  This recipe is easy, moist and tastes wonderful.

I made mini cupcakes with some changes: plain yogurt instead of sour cream, melted butter instead of oil (I hate the oil taste on cupcakes...), one cranberry instead of chocolate chips. Yummy!!

I substituted the same amount of yogurt for the sour cream. These came out moist, soft, and chocolately. They taste more like cupcakes than muffins, though.

Yum!  And chocolatey!  Good taste and dark chocolate.  I used raw chocolate cocoa and 1 tsp of espresso powder dissolved in 1/2 cup of warm water (for the water), and 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips.  Also: 2 1/4 c. flour, 3/4 c. cocoa, 1 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 3/4 c. coconut oil, and 2 tsp vanilla.  These were very moist.  It made 22 total.  Thank you for the recipe.

I don't see what all the hoopla is about.  I was very unimpressed with these.  I feel as though they have very little flavor and are bland.  Also, the texture is nothing like a muffin.  If anything its the texture of cake, cake without flavor.  I wont be making these again.  A definite waste of ingredients.

Yum! These are super chocolatey, moist muffins! I took the advice of another reviewer and upped the cocoa powder to 3/4 cup and decreased the flour to 2 1/4 cups. I also sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top of each before baking. The sour cream kept these muffins nice and moist, almost cake-like. I will definitely be making these again!

they tasted totally awesome!  i made changes according to the other reviewers:  added 1/4 cup of cocoa and decreased flour by 1/4 cup,  added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, substituted apple sauce for sour cream.  i used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to fill the greased muffin tin (paper cups and i don't mix).  i also baked them using convection at 300 degrees for a little over 20 minutes.  the recipe made 24 muffins for me!  they were gone in less than 24 hours. they tasted amazing! thanks so much.

I cut this down by half to make twelve muffins. I only used about a half cup of sugar I substituted nonfat plain yogurt for the sour cream because that's what I had on hand. I also used melted butter in place of the oil. I did use a cup of chips in the batter and I pressed a few chocolate chips over the top of each muffin before baking. My husband thought these were pretty close to Costco's chocolate chocolate chip muffin. Very moist and chocolate-y. I got 12 large muffins out of half a recipe.

These are great muffins! Delicious and easy to make. I actually have a yeast allergy so I made them so that I could eat them. I only had to make a few adjustments. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, I used Xylitol (1cup) in place of the sugar, I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and I used grain sweetened chocolate chips. They were still delicious despite all of the adjustments I made!

Outstanding!  I did not have any baking cocoa so I substituted chocolate instant pudding and otherwise followed the recipe.  Moist and dense they were wonderfully satisfying.

GREAT flavour....so choclatey...yes a tad dry or i would more say it was rich, the kind that sticks in your throat. But with a glass of milk or a cup of tea/coffee these were good. I did add 2 eggs but the rest was the same...I'd make them again

After reading other reviews, I decided to follow this recipe *almost* exactly. I used 2 cups of flour, and 1 1/4 cup of sour cream, I also added a bit more chocolate chips. I have been looking for a good chocolate muffin recipe for a while now - and this is it! I got exactly 24 muffins, and they are delicious!

This is the BEST cupcake or chocolate muffin recipe!! I have bug-shaped muffin pans and this bakes so perfectly in them that all their definition is really clear. This is a huge hit whenever I make it for my Brownie unit. Thanks for sharing!

Oh, these are awesome!! These will probably become part of our muffin rotation. (I bake these up, bag them individually, and freeze them for a grab-n-go breakfast. Cheaper than buying breakfast bars, plus I can pronounce all the ingredients !) I used white whole wheat flour (from Trader Joe's) and also added an extra 1/4 cup cocoa and doubled the chocolate chips. You can never have too much chocolate!! Thought the water as weird so used all milk. Might try buttermilk for the water   another time for some extra tang.

These were not that great for us. If it weren't for the all the chocolate chips we added, there wouldn't have been much taste at all! I followed the recipe exactly and I don't know what went wrong!

My son loves it!!!Yeah, he is convinced that one of those Big Box stores makes better Chocolate muffins until today.  I used baby food pears instead of sour cream or apple sauce.  I'm trying to increase the amount of fiber for the family.  You can't even taste the difference.  Enjoy!

Like some other reviewers, I found that these were not super chocolatey (is that a word?!).  They had a nice moist taste and were not too sweet which can sometimes be a problem with chocolate goodies.  I didn't have any milk so I added a little more sour  cream and water to make up the volume. 20 mins was perfect baking time for me.

Made with white whole wheat flour, half the oil, and left out the choc chips - would have been better with the choc chips in retrospect, but would have melted on the trip I took them on. They were great. :)

I cut this recipe in half and I came out with 11 muffins. I made a few healthy changes. For the flour, I used 1 cup of white flour and 1/3 cup of wheat, 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of cocoa, used fat free sour cream, and 2 egg whites and omitted the chocolate chips. Everything else I kept the same. My three children thought they were awsome. Will definately make again.

Not bad, the texture was great but they were not as tasty I as would have hoped. Somehow the chocolate flavour was very mild... Maybe more chocolate chips would do the trick...

These are very good- I used peanutbutter & Chocolate swirl chips because I was out of chocolate chips.  They are very cake like- which I like but it kinda seems like I'm eating a cupcake for breakfast.

These cupcake-like muffins are my staple recipe. Moist, chocolatey and a great way to use leftover sour cream. Low fat sour cream works fine.
For extra flavor replace the water with some strong coffee. Wonderful!

I have made these on several occasions and each time have been very pleased with results. My four children have eaten them faster than I make them.  I will admit to adding a bit more cocoa and Lavazza expresso. Will remain a favorite!

Wow these are good!  I brought these to work and they disappeared FAST.  They said they were the best chocolate muffins they had ever had.  Based on other reviews I used 3/4 cup cocoa (Hershey's special dark) and reduced the flour to 2 1/4 cups.  I used over a cup of chocolate chips, mixing them with the dry ingredients so they wouldn't sink to the bottom.  Next time I plan on adding even more (to me you can't have too many chocolate chips!)  It made 24 muffins and I had to bake them for the full 25 minutes, which was unusual for my oven since it normally bakes faster.  The texture was fantastic (I was careful not to overmix) and the chocolate chips were meltly.  Yum!

Let's all be honest.  These are dense cupcakes without frosting.  In fact, I have frosted them and served them as cupcakes before.  So delicious.  I have also substituted applesauce for sour cream occasionally, and it still comes out great.

Changed some things, so take that into consideration with my rating.
1)Replaced 2/3c wheat flour. 
2)Reduced 1/2c sugar & added stevia extract. 
3)Had only 1/2c sour cream so used 1/2c yogurt. 
4)Had dark cocoa.
The texture is not dense, very fluffy & moist (not too muffin-y). Taste was pretty non-existant. I guess adding lots of extra chips DOES help some of the reviewers here mask the taste. And using dark cocoa didn't help. Topped each with ganache for more flavor. Again not too muffin-like.

Wonderful recipe.  I didn't have sour cream, but did have mascapone, which I used instead.  Because it was thick, it just needed a bit more beating on a higher speed.  I added choc chips, but also added full chunks of chocolate.  So I put 1/2 mixture in cups, then added a inch piece of chocolate and then topped up the cups.  I then added a chocolate button at the top of the muffin. When the muffins were still warm, the chocolate from the middle oozed out, delicous!  When the muffins cooled down, the chocolate went back to its solid state and you bit into solid chocolate through soft, spongey muffin.  I highly recommend this.  Only thing....... I made a double batch (but they don't last long........ they were devoured within 2 days).

First I want to say that I made these EXACTLY as the recipe states... NO alterations whatsoever.   They were great Chocolate Chip Cupcakes, but really wouldn't call them muffins.  Also, the batter is a little too thin to add chocolate chips... they just sink to the bottom and get stuck on the pan.  I'm not an expert, but I would say that generally muffins are denser and more substantial than cupcakes, and these are very light and fluffy (again, great for cupcakes, not very good for a breakfast item).  I made one pan (12) and tossed the rest of the batter.  Will keep looking for a REAL chocolate muffin recipe, or continue to buy mine at Costco.

These are great. I accidentally forgot to add the oil and they still turned out moist and delicious!

Wonderful, moist muffins.  My family loved them.  I had only 1/2 cup of sour cream so I used that and added applesauce also.  It seemed to work.

Followed the recipe exactly!  Everyone was shocked to learn that I used sour cream, but it was a huge hit!

Made these this morning to bring to coworkers and they were a hit.  Made 24 regular sized muffins as recipe stated. Used mini choc chips.  Made half regular and sprinkled with sparkle sugar. For the other half I stirred in some chopped toasted hazelnuts and sprinkled some on the top.  They are moist, very cupcakey and really pretty.  Will definitely make again.

These are delicious, very moist, almost cupcakish muffins.  Made 24 minis and 18 reg size muffins.  Next time, may add the chips to each individual cup... depends on my mood!  These were great and very easy to assemble.

This was very easy and quick to make¡ I didn't have sour cream on hand, but I saw the note the person who posted the recipe had written and so I substituted homemade applesauce instead. It turned out great, very moist. I also sprinkled a couple extra chocolate chips on the tops of the muffins for decoration before popping them in the oven. My sister loved these, and I'll definitely be making them again!

The muffins were delicious.  The grandchildren really enjoyed them..as did the adults.  I added extra chocolate chips. The chips sunk to the bottoms.  I might try the mini chocolate chips next time.  I floured them but they still settled on the bottom.  
Keeping this recipe for next time grandkids visit so much easier than cake and frosting.

These are so good.  I made them for breakfast since they are called "muffins" but quickly realized that they are more like cup cakes.  So addicting!

These muffins are delicious.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and granulated fructose, and I used 2 eggs, 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 coconut milk, and 1/4 cup almond milk.  Fantastic!
