I used twice the bouillon for stronger chicken flavor, then I decided to see how 'homemade' I could make it taste by adding basil, fresh ground pepper, celery salt, garlic powder, and 2 pats of butter. I think I could slide this past my own grandmother! ;-)

I sauteed about 6 sliced mushrooms in some butter & added a little white wine to reduce.  Then I used beef bouillon instead of chicken and put mushroom/wine/butter mix into the gravy.  Finished it off with a dash of worchestershire and some black pepper.  I won't eat a good steak without it again!  Thanks!

I always add an extra cube. This is how my mother and grandmother taught me to make it, only they would add a shot of ketsup, for color reasons.

Nice gravy. I read many of the reviews and did make some changes because of those reviews. I used chicken stock instead of water with 6 tsp of the granulated chicken bouillon. I thought it was a little salty (should have used the unsalted chicken broth) but the people at the party liked it a lot. I also add a generous dose of black pepper and a dash of sage. flavor was nice but I think next time I'll use the unsalted chicken broth and try flour instead of corn starch. Maybe it would look more like chicken gravy then. Would I make this gravy again?? You betcha! It only took as long to make as boiling water!! I don't think it took more than maybe 10-12 minutes to make 4 cup of great tasting gravy. Oh, I did this on the stove top as it was easier than fiddling with the microwave and worrying about a boil over to clean up.

Maybe I did something wrong, I don't know. The gravy was the color of bile, it would not thicken and there was absolutely no taste to the gravy. IF I were to ever use it again I'd use more buillon, or use Campbells chicken broth. Sometimes the fastest way isn't always the best!

I just made this because I was looking for a fat free low calorie gravy to make really fast.  I used 3 teaspoons of bouillon for extra flavor.  What I got was properly thickened and flavorful, but unappetizingly pale looking.  Then it hit me - this was the sauce from the high school cafeteria chicken chow mein that I loved as a kid (so much for early development of taste buds).  Anyway, this is a good fat free, quick emergency gravy.  Next time I may try flour instead of cornstarch.

Good for a fast gravy, however it wasn't thick enough for me with two tbs of cornstarch.  I recommend three or even 3 1/2 tbs of cornstarch, if you like a thick gravy.  Other than that, great recipe.  :)

Do spice this up with your favorite spices, You can use chicken or beef boullion cubes, depending on what you are cooking in the oven!

My guests were raving about the sauce, but I ended up using the stovetop b/c it was taking too long in the microwave.

Add a pat of butter to "finish" it, and a shot of Kitchen Bouquet to deepen the color, especially if you are making beef gravy. The richness of the color is aesthically more pleasing.  I've been making gravy like this for over 40 yrs. a little bit of oregano, sage or poultry seasoning greatly improves the flavor.

I used chicken stock/broth instead of water & "Better than Boullion" (scoops out from a jar).  I used 3-4 cubes worth of boullion.  This was SO delicious!  I've made it twice this week.  My little picky eaters nearly licked the plate!

This worked great for me! I needed something very quick and it was great. I added the cornstarch and water, and then did it again to make it even thicker.

This is awesome, because it's low fat, low cal, (for gravy!) and quick. I added a black pepper and a small pinch of ground sage. Thanks for the recipe!

Great with some adjustment!!! We used 2 cups of meat and meat juice drippings instead of water and also added bouillon. Wanted it a little thicker will use a little flour also next time. Great for a very fast gravy.

I've made this several times--my youngest son likes gravy on his mashed potatoes and this is a super easy way to make him happy even when I'm not cooking something that lends itself to making 'real' gravy.  I normally use beef boullion and the gravy color is fine!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was just what I was looking for...quick and good. I did add more chicken bouillon (3 Tbsp), cornstarch (3 Tbsp) and water (about 2 Tbps) and I added pepper and onion powder. I also kept in the microwave for about 3 minutes while stirring about every minute. Turned out very tasty!

I gave this a three only because I made modifications.  I used low salt chicken broth because it had to cook way longer than 2 minutes on the stove top to get it reduced and thickened to a good gravy consistency - mine reduced by almost half before it got nice and thick.  Also added garlic, onion, pepper and a little oregano.

This worked in a pinch when the Christmas gravy went awry. It will depend on the stock you use, and I know this will never compare to well made gravy from drippings, but this didn't have a whole of flavour. It is easy enough though and will do in a bind, but I suggest adding a few of your own spices and flavoring.

I have made this gravy on several occasions and it is always well received.  I do add 1/2 an onion and a teaspoon of diced garlic.  Really gives it that extra kick.  Recipe definitely allows to adjust to your tastes.

I served this tonight with Aimee's Mashed Cauliflower and a turkey and it was very good.  I did only use about half of the bouillon and added it to the broth made from the neck and giblets. I seasoned with thyme, sage, celery flakes, parsley, a little poultry seasoning and salt and pepper and prepared on the stovetop.  I can't wait to try this with beef and am so happy to have a low carb option for gravy in the future.

This is exactly the recipe I used to use when camping in my younger years and I gave it a 5 star because of happy memories, and of course....everything tastes so good when camping out.  I used to use powdered chicken or beef bouillon, also a bit of granulated garlic and a pinch of dried parsley.  I used to take about a dozen or so of small baggies with herbs and spices needed to perk up camp fare.

This is a great base but definitely needs some doctoring! I stuck with the 2 bouillon cubes and used Wondra for thickening. I added fresh ground pepper, garlic salt, parsley, Cajun seasoning and then whisked in some lite sour cream. It still wasn't quite right, so I added a couple drops of liquid smoke. Perfect taste just like it came from roasted chicken drippings!

This was good but needed just a little tweaking.  I had some leftover turkey in my freezer and wanted to make a gravy to go with it.  I took some of it and added it to water and cooked it down so it would have the taste of turkey.  Then I added the bouillon and cornstarch, but it was still quite runny so had to add more cornstarch.  I also added a little Kitchen Bouquet to give it a little color.  In a bind this works, but be prepared to add more flavor(think salt and pepper) and more thickening agent.  I did make only half the recipe, and what is left over will be added to a little mayo and mustard tomorrow for a turkey sandwich for lunch.  There certainly is a place for a recipe like this!  So thanks for that!
