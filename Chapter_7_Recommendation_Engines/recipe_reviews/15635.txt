This was an awsome coffee cake and so easy. I did change a couple of things. First, I added some cinnamon and madagascar vanilla to the cake batter for a little extra flavor. I only used 6Tbs of butter for the struesel topping and the consistency was perfect. I pour about 1/2-3/4 of the batter into a greased 9x13 pan. I then sprinkled 1/2 of the topping evenly over the batter. I dropped spoonfulls of the remaining batter over the topping. I made large circles with a knife to distribute the top batter and mix in the struesel topping (don't stir, just swirl a few times) I then topped with more topping. Baked for 30 minutes at 350 and did not use the drizzle of powdered sugar as it did not need it!! Great recipe!

I love this cake!  I made it in a bundt pan and drizzled icing over it while still warm.  Very nice presentation for our Father's Day dessert get together.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks!

DELICIOUS!!  Only change I made was omitting the nuts and using cinnamon graham crackers instead of plain.  As my family puts it "this is a keeper!!"
Thanks for the terrific recipe. :o)

This is absolutely one of the best coffeecakes I've tasted--homemade or otherwise. I cut the amount of butter to one stick, and I use a butter-flavored cake mix and cinnamon graham crackers, and the results are wonderful. This will be a favorite!

Certainly a pretty cake (almost a guarantee if you use a specialty Bundt pan as I did) but nothing special in taste. (Hubs had a couple of bites and left the rest on his plate.  I didn't even get THAT far)  Even substituting freshly squeezed orange juice for the water and adding a tablespoon of fresh orange zest and a teaspoon of vanilla didn't elevate this beyond a mediocre, doctored up cake mix - and there are some doctored up cake mix recipes that are excellent!  Also, a mere 1/4 cup of oil left this a little dry.  For those who are still interested, I used a specialty Bundt pan which required only half of the the topping mixture. Because mine is a dark pan, I lowered the oven temperature to 325 degrees, and it was baked perfectly at about 42 minutes. I drizzled it with a glaze of fresh orange juice and powdered sugar.  The remaining streusel (and there was quite a bit leftover) I froze for later use to top muffins.

This recipe was great.  I don't like nuts so I changed it a bit... instead of the walnuts I used 1/2 cup rolled oats and increased the butter to a full cup.  It was delicious!

Great and Simple!  I have made it twice, and both times it was a big hit.  It also freezes really well.  The streusel call for way too much butter - probably 6 tbsp. would be enough.  My streusel did not sink, but then I used finely ground crumbs and chopped nuts.  I also mixed cinnamon into the cake mix to give it a little more flavor.

This was a very good coffee cake.  I had the same problem as some of the other reviewers, where the topping sunk to the bottom.  It still tasted very good though.  I think next time I may try adding the topping later on.

This is a very good coffee cake, but I think it stops short of being great. That being said, I would make it again, because it's sure to be a crowd pleaser. I did take the advice of other reviewers and cut down the butter to one stick (1/2 c.) rather than 2/3 c., which seemed excessive and like it would make the filling sink to the bottom. I had no issues with that happening. This is very sweet, between the cake mix, the sugar in the streusel, and the drizzled glaze. I tried a slice w/out the glaze and it seemed to need a certain something, so I used the glaze...that made it quite a bit sweeter. I am bringing this to work for a Christmas surprise, and I am sure my coworkers will love it. The graham makes for an unusual, though good, change in your regular coffee cake. Oh, by the way, 1/ 1/3 cups of graham crumbs is 1 sleeve of crackers (9 whole crackers).

I realized, as I was in the middle of making this that I forgot to read the reviews that other's had left-someting I ALWAYS do. I was in a hurry though and your recipe had all the ingredients I currently had on had so I printed it and got to mixing.  Deciding it was too late to back out I just continued on.  I was not disappointed.  This is a fabulously easy and delicious recipe - my entire family loved it.  The only thing I didn't have was the confectioners sugar to make the glaze - but it turns out there was really no need for it.  These were wonderful right out of the oven and warm, but lasted well and were just as delicious 3 days later.  Instead of using the 9x13 pan I used a muffin tin and 3 mini loaves.  Perfect size servings for little ones who very much enjoyed the special treat, and my husband ate an entire mini loaf with his coffee.  They're already asking for more! Will definately make again.  Great recipe.

Made this last weekend and took the advise of other reviewers. Tweaker alert: Added 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon to the coffee cake batter. Another reviewer said 1 1/3 c. graham cracker crumbs=1 sleeve graham crackers.(Thanks for that!) Added a splash of vanilla. Up'd oil to 1/3 cup. Added 1/2 tsp. salt to Streusel. Did not make the icing. It didn't need it and the teenagers 14-19 years old LOVED IT! Made the house smell amazing!

I used devil's food cake instead of yellow cake and seasoned the batter with vanilla and allspice. Omitted the nuts as I didn't have any on hand. Awesome results!!!

I have always loved this yummy coffee cake. The recipe is simple. I use pecans instead of walnuts. For me, I have had trouble with the strudel sinking to the bottom when I use a yellow cake mix that calls for butter. I believe these cake mixes are called "Golden" by some manufacturers. Using a white cake mix for this is also delicious and prettier than the yellow.

Just made this tonight and I wish that I had made it in a 9X13 pan instead of choosing the Bundt pan.  Needless to day, 1/2 got stuck in the pan, but I put all the pieces on the plate, drizzled with the icing, and we ate it.  It still tastes great even though it doesn't appease the eyes.  I did use applesauce instead of the oil (I almost always do).  To make the streusel: crushed up 1 sleeve of low-fat cinnamon graham crackers in a gallon sized bag, added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3 tablespoons melted butter.  Mushed in the bag until combined.  This made it very easy to put onto the cake and the streusel part is the best part of the cake.

This is the second time this week I've made this cake - it is soooo good. I made it for my husband and took the main part of the cake to work two days later. Everyone loved it - even several days old - that they requested it again. This is exceptional. I follow the recipe as written and it is wonderful - the smell from the oven is overwhelming. You must try this - it is better than you might think!

I normally don't make cakes from a box, but I needed something quick and thought I'd give this a try.  This recipe was easy to make and the cake turned out very moist.  The graham crackers were a unique addition and worked well in the streusel.  A tiny bit was missing in flavor, however, and I think that a bit of salt (maybe 1/2 tsp.) could have been added to the streusel to enhance the flavors.  I think that would have done the trick.  I will definitely make this again and try adding the salt next time.

I didn't have yellow cake mix at home so I used the batter from a different recipe on this website called "Aunt Anne's Coffee Cake" But I used the strussel topping and let me just say this is the BEST strussel topping I have ever made! It had the texture I am always trying to get with other recipes and it just tasted so good! Thank you!

This worked as I needed to use up ingredients in the pantry.  Other than that it was just okay.  I used only 1/2 c butter as suggested. I figured if it was going to sink down I would just put it on top.  I did this then inserted the spatula and swirled a bit then chopped into it a bit to push some down.  Well it didn't sink at all so I now wish I had put some into the middle.  There was so much on the top a lot fell off when it was cut.  I think some finely chopped apple would be nice in this.

A+. Amazing. However did the layers of cake and streusel in a bundt cake pan and didn't turn out well as the brown sugar and walnuts miz sunk to bottom and cake rose to the top so it didn't have the layered effect i wanted. I also doubled the streusel amt and added a pinch of cinnamon to the cake mix for additional flavour. Another good tip- if you have any ground cardamon, add it to your streusel mix and cake mix- adds a nice kick of flavour and gives it a special something that i think a lot of bakeries and whatnot use as their 'special ingredient'. This recipe is def a keeper!

Oh my, we loved this one!  This is a terrific way to jazz up a cake mix!  I made this as written but opted to skip the icing drizzle.  Instead I turned this into dessert by adding whipped cream, a passion fruit flavored maraschino cherry and a sprig of lemon balm.  This was quick and easy and called for ingredients that I almost always have on hand!  Thank you luvs2bake!

This cake was a cinch to make and absolutely delicious!  It came out beautifully in my bundt pan.  I only used 1 stick of butter for the steusel, simply because I felt like that was plenty.  Oh, and I didn't have butter flavored extract, but I did have orange and that was perfect!  I will definitely be making this one again!

This is really good tasting cake though I must warn you that making it in a bundt pan isnt so simple. Depending on how you had the struesel and how you flour your pan the cake may not come out right. Usually the struesel sinks to the bottom and the top of the cake looks a mess. BUT I must admit that fighting over the pan makes up for an imperfect cake. Besides you can always cover the top with a lot of icing!

This is very good. I did not use the glaze, it is sweet enough as it is, and I only used 5 tbsp butter. We don't like nuts so I threw in a handful of oats and it was delicious. I'm making another one today. Thanks!

This is crazy-good cake. Light, fluffy, flavorful and no hint of graham flavor (not that there's anything wrong with graham flavor!!!) once it's baked. My 13 year old baked this (with some over the shoulder supervision) and we were all impressed by the delicious results. It's called a coffee cake but is equally good as a dessert cake.

There wasn't a single person that didn't love this.  It was a "huge" success.  I  brought it to the office and the compliments were huge.  My family was very upset that I took it to share with my colleagues, because it meant that they didn't have as much for themselves.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and it worked very well.  I was sure the 9" x 13" pan was the wrong size (too large) because the batter spread very thin and barely covered - but once baked, there was a lot more height and I was happy I didn't change the size pan used.  Next time, I will definately try this without the icing as the only negative was that the cake was "very very" sweet (it didn't stop anyone from gobbling it up). The recipe says "best if served warm," but none of us agreed.  We enjoyed it even more the 2nd day .............. the only reason there was a 2nd day is that I made this late at night on day 1.

WONDERFULL!! I made this for my boyfriend to take to work.  He had half the batch before it made it in to his office.  Here are the changes that I made, (used what I had on hand) I doubled the recipe: 1 box french vanilla cake mix 1 box butter pecan cake mix unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil half low fat cinnamon sugar graham crackers and half cinnamon brown sugar Ritz crackers For the Glaze: Substituted almond extract for vanilla, used milk to thin.   I also added icing color gel in 2 diffrent batches for my boyfriends school colors (hes a teacher) This is a fantastic recipe, and I will be making this again and again.

This was liked by all.  I decreased butter to 1/2c (1 stick), stirred the streusel mixture carefully with a fork and didn't have problems with it clumping or sinking to the bottom. No leftovers.

I had company overnight and needed to make a coffee cake with what I had on hand. I looked at a lot of recipes. This one struck me as similar to Starbucks. I modified it a bit. No nuts a little extra graham instead. 6 Tbs. of butter was all it needed. I also added a box of instant vanilla pudding and instead of the oil I added about 3/4 cup of applesauce. It was the bomb!!! There were 3 pieces left when company left and I sent it w/them. It is a keeper!

This recipe was quite delicious, however I think it could do with less butter for the crumb mixture.The mixture sunk to the bottom and is quite mushy. This also made it hard to sprinkle around evenly because it clumped so much. I followed the recipe to the letter and it tastes great. Also, I was expecting a denser consistency, but it is very cakey. I love the graham cracker idea though, and I'll certainly use that in the future.

I had this recipe for years but lost it in my house fire.  I do use chopped pecans and butter pecan cake mix for rave results.  This is a recipe I'm glad I found, everyone in my family, all my friends & co-workers love this, and it is fairly easy to make.  Great for brunch or as a dessert!

This is our favorite coffee cake. It's wonderful! I make the topping (with or without pecans or walnuts) the night before and refrigerate it to speed preparation the next morning, microwaving it for 20 seconds to make for easier sprinkling. I also bake several in 10x15 pans for Meals on Wheels and PTO meetings, using just one layer of batter and topping it with 3/4 of the struesel. Everyone really, really loves this recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!  My store was out of walnuts so I used pecans instead and I also mixed a half a teaspoon of cinnamon into the cake batter.  It was perfect for my Mother's Day brunch. My family devoured it!  This is a recipe that I will keep and share with family.

This is a fantastic recipe!!!! I baked mine in a 9x13 pan for 35 min. at 350. Also I did add about 1/4 or so teaspoons of vanilla, and a dash of cinnamon to the cake batter to add extra flavor. This is wonderful if you serve it with heavy whipping cream on top!!! weird combo I know, but trust me it is delicious :)

This was super yummy! It is very very rich, but very good. I made this cake in a bundt pan and baked it for 45 minutes at 350, which I thought was the perfect amount of time. The only thing I would change next time would be to add less vanilla to the glaze. It tasted very vanilla-y to me. Also, I might try this with cinnamon graham crackers instead of plain. I definitely plan on making this cake again!

I followed the recipe exactly (except for the nuts, which we can't eat) but all the streusel stuff sank to the bottom and the cake part was so crumbly it wouldn't stay on the fork.  I wonder what I did wrong.  It looked to me like 2/3 c. butter was too much. Maybe that made the streusel too heavy.

This was one of the first cakes I tried (i.e. when I discovered you could doctor a cake mix).   Still use it and  always well received.    Thanks for reminding me.....because I think I mislaid the recipe on our last move.

Dear Luvs2bake. I just made your graham streusel coffee cake and must say i was very disappointed. Might as well call this upside down coffee cake. The walnuts and mixture completely sank to the bottom of the pan. This was a great waste of time for i simply could have made an easy coffee cake with much better results. I really hope you consider taking down this recipe. Hugs, THE QUEEN BAKER

Easy, quick and a HUGE crowd pleaser.   I made extra streusel and added pecans to go with the walnuts, and divided the recipe into two 8x8 pans and it worked out beautifully.   I coated the whole top with a no-nut version of the streusel which gave the whole thing a really finished look.

This was a big hit with my family for fathers day brunch! I did follow some of the other suggestions, adding cinnamon to the batter, I also added a bit of nutmeg. And I decreased the butter. It was amazing!

There was only one bad thing about this cake.  It's so good you want to eat the whole thing.  I've made it twice so far and it's turned out great both times!  So good!!

Delicious and my family loved it!  My mom even said it was better than the famed family recipe and believe me that isn't something she just says!  Thanks for the keeper!

We really enjoyed this cake.  I was looking for a yummy coffee cake that did not require sour cream.  This was a big hit with everyone who tried it.  I followed the directions exactly.  Used the 9x13 pan.  I modified the glaze slightly using 1 T. melted butter instead of the extract, but that was about it.  Thank you for submitting such a lovely cake!  I will make it often.

Absolutely fabulous coffee cake! I made this for a family reunion breakfast and got rave reviews! It was so easy to make and tasted wonderful. My sister-in-law, a caterer, asked me for the recipe...it's that good!

I was a little disappointed but my husband raved.  It was good but tasted a lot like yellow cake mix; I guess I'm used to sour cream coffee cakes.  I didn't have trouble with the filling sinking.  Maybe try grinding the graham crackers fine enough and sprinkle the filling over the batter by rubbing it between your fingers, not just dropping by the spoonful.

AWESOME!!! I made up a trial batch and company just happened to come over. It was a hit! I made mine in a loaf shape... turn the heat down to 300 and give it a touch over an hour. The streusel didn't sink, but I crushed the grahams finely and got little pre-chopped walnuts. Maybe big bits makes it too heavy? Also, way too much butter. Probably only really need 6T, though I used the whole stick since I had it melted already.

Very Very Good. Can't stop eating it.  One of my guests actually took some home and emailed me the following day to say it was the best coffee cake he ever had and that the next time they are over for the weekend can I PLEASE make this coffe cake again.  The only problem I had ( which didn't effect the taste) was that the streusel all sunk to the bottom of the cake.

Excellent! This is so good. I made this Mother's Day weekend. When I started eating it, I couldn't believe how good it was. Moist, tasty and just delicious. I took some to my mom and she thought it was great. She didn't think I made it, but rather that it was store bought because it was so good. I will definitely be making this again. I think the only change I made was that I used pecans instead of walnuts. It was perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

Yum! Super easy to make and delicious.  I will be saving and making this recipe again.  I didn’t have butter flavor for the icing drizzle. So, I used the maple extract I had on hand. Thank you for posting this great recipe!

I've made this several times and again, everyone really enjoyed it at our meeting! One person stated: "all the good things about a cinnamon roll but more flavorful and moist". I did add vanilla to the cake mix and used melted butter rather than oil in the cake as well. Due to a friends dislike of nuts in cake, I substituted 1/2 cup rolled oats in the streusel, a pinch of salt but also use less butter so it won't sink.Thank you for posting!

I think this turned out GREAT!!  I did  not frost it, because I don't care for my desserts too sweet, but made some on the side for the kids!  They loved it too!!  It was perfect too since I had all of these ingredients at the house!

I don't use cake mixes ~ ever. That said, using the 4 Egg Yellow Cake recipe from this website (and following a few suggestions from other reviewers), this made a terrific coffee cake. Loved the topping ~ though I added more nuts because I love them and I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 1 1/2, which I thought added more flavor. Great recipe, luvs2bake, thanks!!

This is very easy to do.  I followed the recipe as is.  I did not use my own pan as I was taken it to a breakfast fucntions.  So it was not as pretty as some I have seen in the pictures.  It was a little swallow.  But it is good.  I made for different type today and this is second runner up.

True to the billing, this is an excellent cake. Moist, flavorful and fluffy. My family loved it. I skipped the nuts and used cinnamon graham crackers but otherwise followed the recipe. This would be really easy for weekend company.

Excellent coffee cake - everyone begs for this recipe! Perfect as written though just as tasty without nuts or icing. Gets even better the second and third days - though it often doesn't last that long. Thanks!

This was the something I needed to bring to a brunch this morning.  All the ingredients required were in the house, so no shopping was required.  It was a big hit -- very, very good.  I'll definitely make it again.  Everyone thought it was a sour cream coffee cake.  Fooled 'em!!!  The streusel filling was out of this world.  The use of Graham crackers was unusual.

I loved this recipe just the way it is except I used pecans in place of the walnuts. It turned out really great with no problems. It was very sweet not something I could eat very often but I think it would be great for holiday mornings. Thanks luvs2bake!

I did have a couple of problems with this cake - the topping mostly sank to the bottom and the sides kind of came off when I took it out of the pan. I baked it in a silicone pan, which might have been a mistake. After 1 hour it was still not even cool enough for me to flip it out without an oven mitt.   BUT  It was seriously the best tasting cake I've ever had! I used some creative decorating with fruit to hold up the sides until they cooled down and set. This was for a bridal shower as a last-minute addition to the red velvet I had already prepared. It outshined the red velvet in every way!  I did not use the topping. I used Trader Joe's vanilla cake mix and their cinnamon grahams as well.   I will be making this over and over and over again - but never again in a silicone pan. Thank you for this recipe!

Add me to the list of satisfied recipe try-ers!!  I LOVED it and so did alll of my family.  I made the recipe for Thanksgiving.  Everyone couldn't get enough!!  Even our toughest food critic (my Dad) DEMANDED that I make him some more!  ;-) It's been a couple of months since the first time I tried it but, I'm in the process of making it again as I type this message.  To the poster of this recipe:  THANK you so much for sharing it!!!!  :-)

Everyone at work devoured this, but I feel like using a box mix is cheating. Good flavor and use of graham crackers, but you could probably make it taste better or healthier by making your own cake batter.

This recipe is excellent! I am told I have to bring this to every function. I didn't make the drizzle sugar but just used confectioners sugar over the top.

I grease the pan very well, put half of the cake batter in the pan, top with about 1/3 of the streusel then the rest of the cake batter and the remaining streusel. I always make a little extra streusel because it's so delicious! To prevent the topping from sinking to the bottom I make sure to add the butter slowly whe mixing the streusel ingredients. If it gets too heavy it'll sink. If you think you've added too much butter, just add more graham crackers. It'll soak up the butter and make more streusel! Beating the cake for the extra 2 minutes is key in making the coffeecake fluffy.

This was an instant favorite at our home.  I followed the recipe as written except I had to subsistute pecans for walnuts, as I was out of them.  I didn't have any problems with the amount of butter and I ended up using the glaze too. Everyone I asked said definitely don't change a thing.  Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I actually didn't taste this cake, but if it tasted as good as it smelled, than I am sure it is delicious. One comment though.. the recipe calls for WAY TOO MUCH BUTTER! All of the streusel will sink to the bottom if you use the amount of butter it calls for. I will probably make this again, but this time I will cut way back on the butter.

Hmm, not bad, but nothing spectacular. I wasn't overly impressed, but it makes a decent coffee cake. I fixed it for a work breakfast, and there was quite a bit left. It tasted like a boxed mix with some weird tasting streussel in the middle which kind of clumped together. I may try it again some time, but it won't be anytime soon. It's definitely worth a try...just personal preference on my part.

I only had about 1 cup of graham crackers, but followed the rest exactly.  I really like how moist the cake was and it does have a nice presentation with the strudel swirled throughout.

I made this without nuts because my husband is not a fan - and it was perfect.  He told me to never make a different coffee cake for him.  Last night I caught him in a fit of the midmight munchies chowing down on leftover cake!  WONDERFUL!

Rather easy to make. Remember to follow the amount of egg and water as indicated in the recipe. I forgot and followed that on the box, and my cake was still tasty but perhaps too soft for a coffee cake.

Excellent recipe!  My hubby couldn't get enough.  He loved it so much it seemed he was trying to hoard it from the rest of our clan.  I left out the nuts as I am not a big nut fan.  Definitely will make again.

Excellent! Will not have to look for another Streusel Coffee Cake recipe. Easy to prepare.

Very good. My guests raved about this cake, but personally I really missed the tang of sour cream coffee cakes. I'll probably keep looking for other recipes, but I wouldn't mind serving this again. Thanks, Judy!
