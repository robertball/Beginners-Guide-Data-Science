This had such a great flavor.  And it was pretty easy to make.  I used a boneless turkey breast to start with.  And I added some sauted onions to my stuffing (for my husband).  The raisins and apples add so much flavor to the stuffing.  The turkey was very moist and delicious.

I made this for this past Christmas and it was PERFECT!  I followed the recipe to a tee and our guests commented that I should open a restaurant.  So tender, juicy, and flavorful!  I purchased my turkey breast from a local Whole Foods butcher dept and the young man grabbed a fresh turkey and deboned it perfectly for me!

For this year's Thanksgiving I decided to make turkey roulade, since I wasn't expecting a large crowd and none of us are huge fans of the traditional roasted turkey anyway. The stuffing I made was a bit different from the one described here - mine was all savory, without cranberries or raisins. It was made with stuffing, turkey sausage, sauteed onions with garlic, poultry herbs, and celery. I know that this is a bit of a deviation from the stuffing described in the recipe, but I can assure you that the fundamentals are the same, and the result was INCREDIBLE. The whole point of stuffing is to adjust it to your liking, isn't it? As long as you keep the technique the same, you can't go wrong. All my guests (as well as my husband and myself) were pleasantly surprised by how well it came out. Not to mention that it looked incredibly impressive. I will absolutely be making this recipe again, and it deserves to be made a lot more frequently than just once a year for Thanksgiving!

I wrote this recipe, and I still pretty much make it the same, but now I add pinenuts (3T) to the stuffing.  Enjoy!

Super easy and delicious!!! I love it. It has become our official turkey recipe when we don’t have many invitees. We used dried cranberries instead of raisins and it’s also great.
