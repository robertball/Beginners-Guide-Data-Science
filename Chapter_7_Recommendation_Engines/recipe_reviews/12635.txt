Very tasty!  But only 2 cups of apples didn't fill my pie plate very well.  Even a regular plate maybe needs more fruit.  I'll definitely do this one again!  Thanx Lindze!

This combination is so great! I took this to a "pie night" and everyone loved it.  That being said I did change alot of this recipe to make it work.  I doubled the fruit, I added 1 Tab of cornstarch (which was not enough- it was still pretty runny), and I cooked it at 375 for about 55 minutes.

I added an extra cup of apples. I also added crushed up "Good Friends" Kashi cereal, and oats to the crumb topping. Delicious! I will definately bake again!

This pie was perfect!  The only thing I did differently was use half oats in the topping because I like the texture, and it was fabulous!  When it first came out of the oven, it looked like the filling would be too juicy, but as it cooled it solidified some, and the taste was amazing! I made this last night and by this morning it was almost gone.  I will definitely make it again and again.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!

Although this Recipe was good, I did increase the aplles by about 4 cups and berries I cup each. the Baking time was really off. 350 for 30 min was way to short. I left my pie in for an hour and my apples still came out crunchy. Next time I will Follow Betty Crocker cooking time for a french apple pie which is 425 for 40 min cover top with foil in the last 15 min to prevent burning.

I added a little more sliced apples to the filling and added 1/3 cup oats to the crumb topping which meant I had to increase the butter in the topping just a touch. Baked at 350*, my pie was done in a little over 60 minutes. I did cover the pie halfway through with foil to keep the pie from burning. Very good pie recipe.

I really liked this pie.  I used mac apples because that is waht I have and also I didn't have any blueberries so I doubled the raspberries.  I also used oats instead of some of the flour.  Who would have known that apples went so well with raspberries?  It turned out to be a really great combination, and I will for sure make this crumble-top pie again.

This was really good -- I modified this recipe only because I had to -- only had certain ingredients on hand.  I chopped two granny smith apples, used to 1/2 pints of red raspberries.  Did not have any brown sugar on hand, so used 1/4 cup dark maple syrup, two tablespoons of strawberry jam and 1 tablespoon of grenadine (just to see what would happen).  I added all of this to the fruit and made sure everything was coated and poured into pie crust.  Made the crumble and baked.  This was really good but was very tart -- I was afraid of the pie being too sweet because of the maple syrup and the grenadine, but the granny smith's really kept things from being sweet.  Next time, will use 1/2 cup maple syrup.

This recipe was GREAT! My pie plate was a little bigger, so I did add a LOT more apples to the pie (I think it was 6 in total) and I used about a cup of each of the berries.  I added the oats, as per other reviewers, but I think it would have worked out either way! Cooked it a bit longer, 45-50 min.  I will definitely make again!

I doubled the fruit in this recipe to fill the pie plate and added about a 1/2 cup of oatmeat to the topping as suggested.  This was a fabulous pie.  My family couldn't get enough!

I added some extra apples based on the other review. Good flavor, but the topping gets mushy very fast, and my apples didn't bake enough for my taste.

This was delicious! Not too sweet, and the crumbly topping had such a nice flavor with the spices.

Thought this was very good! I really enjoyed eating this. I did add the oatmeal and thought it was a nice touch. I couldn't find any ground allspice so I just didn't put any in. I will make this again!!!

This pie was great flavor. Didn't measure fruit, just made a big mound in regular pie plate, it cooks down of course. Baked 375 (to make sure crust would cook) for 50 min. Apples became a bit soft for my preference though.
Instructions probably should read "with a pastry cutter, cut butter into dry ingredients" - rather than mix.

This pie was very good! I used way more fruit though.  I didn't have rasberries so I used almost a whole pint of Blueberries and about 5 or six small-medium apples.  Then I added sugar to the apple berry mix.  the only problem I had was with the crumble but it was my fault.  I mixed it for too long and the butter melted. so it turned out more like a dough then crumble...  but my whole family LOVED it! I will definitely make this again.

Used the topping here, with some oats mixed in, on http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-fresh-cherry-pie/detail.aspx for an awesome Dutch Cherry Pie.

I kept it in the oven for 45 minutes so that the crust would be done, also I just used 1 teaspoon of apple pie spice because I didn't have all the separate spices.

Add more apples, I suggest 4 cups as opposed to the 2 that’s recommended. And I didn’t check my blueberries for sweetness, they were a little too tart and it took away from the whole pie. This pie was not one of my favorites and I would not make it again.

Love this. I coated the apples in a little lemon juice. Next time I would add more apples and berries and be sure to use a deep dish pie. I coated the berries in flour. I recommend using the kind of apples stated in recipe. I don’t recommend adding oats because then it becomes too much like a fruit crisp. Love the idea of combining the apples and the berries.

I have used this recipe at least 6 times. The only changes i make however, is that I use huckleberries for my berry. And I add in a handful of oats into the topping. Love it!

I made this the wrong way!  I for some reason mixed the topping into the fruit instead of crumbling it on top. I also added oats to the top like other reviewers suggested. Despite my mistake it turned out great. I also recommend cooking this at 425  degrees for 15 minutes then 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Watch carefully so that the crust does not burn. Next time I will pay attention to the directions! LOL
