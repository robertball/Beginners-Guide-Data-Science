Flavor was great but what didn't work for me was the 9x12 baking dish. There was not near enough mixture to cover the bottom, let alone top with another layer. A small loaf pan would work better for this. What I really liked about this recipe is  the small amount of breadcrumb it called for. It had a really nice consistency.
