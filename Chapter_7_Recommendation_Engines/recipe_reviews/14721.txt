GOOD. I USUALLY BOIL THE SPARE RIBS FIRST, POUR TWO BOTTLES OF OUR FAVORITE BARBEQUE SAUCE OVER TOP OF THEM AND SLOW COOK UNTIL THEY FALL APART. WHAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS RECIPE WAS THE GREEN PEPPERS AND ONIONS. I CAN'T SAY WE CARED MUCH FOR THE TOMATO GRAVY. EVERYONE ASKED ME TO GO BACK TO MY ORIGINAL RECIPE ONLY ADD THE VEGGIES. SERVED THE RIBS WITH BAKED POTATOES (WASH, POKE HOLES, SPRAY TIN FOIL WITH BUTTER SPRAY AND SPRINKLE PRETZEL SALT IN THE BUTTER. WRAP TIN FOIL TIGHTLY AROUND POTATO AND PLACE IN OVEN ON 350 FOR 2 HOURS---YUMMY) AND SALAD. FILLING HALFTIME DINNER!

Oh my goodness.  I just wasted 6 lbs of Ribs on this.  I suggest a minor adjustment to the amount of vinigar.  Like maybe 1 1/2 tbsp.?

Be sure to trim fat from ribs before browning and cooking. I didn't think to do that and they came out kinda of greasy. Sauce was kind of thin and runnier than I expected, but very tasty and easy to make. The meat does just fall apart.

i haven't tried this particular recipe,(that's the reason for the 2 star rating) but i wanted to share a tip on slow cookers. whenever i have meat(either chicken, ribs, roast, etc) that i want to keep out of grease, i wad up pieces of aluminum foil and place in the bottom of the cooker. the meat sits on top of the pieces and cooks great and all the grease goes in the bottom. you might want to spray the foil with cooking spray if you think it might stick to the meat.

I make it the day before and put it in the refrigerator over night.  All the fat comes up to the top and I take it off and it is delicious.
Also, tastes great over egg noodles.

This is a great recipe.... I added a touch of Kraft Barbecue sauce to give a little more taste than just the tomato sauce.    My husband loved it and so did I....EASY

Definitely trim the fat from the ribs!  Otherwise your sauce will be too greasy. After 10 hours in the slow-cooker, the meat was very tender.  I wasn't that impressed with the sauce.  It was pretty runny.  Next time I think I will strain out the meat and veggies when they are done and put the juice into a saucepan and thicken with some cornstarch.  I did like serving it with the rice.

My friends and I enjoyed this.  However, I prefer to cook a batch of cornbread to serve with the ribs.  The sauce soaks into the bread and the slight sweetness of the cornbread is a great compliment!

If one reads the author’s recipe description, then I would not change a thing.  It was delicious, the meat just fell off the bones and the sauce complemented perfectly the rice I had on the side.  I could understand that if you were expecting a thick BBQ sauce as the end result, some may have been disappointed.  I actually used St Louis Style pork ribs.  Having the other half with my wife tonight and can’t stop thinking of how good it will be!

This was ok, not what I expected tho. I don't think I will be making this one again, the sauce was waaaay to thin and runny for me. Almost like rib soup.

My husband loves ribs and this recipe has potential. I seasoned my ribs with a rib rub vs. just salt and pepper and used half tomato sauce and half tomato based chili sauce.  I left out the lemon juice and instead added a splash of apple cider vinegar along with some minced garlic.  After cooking, like others I experienced a thin sauce so I skimmed the fat off the top. This really needed a little "something" so I added a little liquid smoke.  I then thickened it with a bit of cornstarch.  The meat was pretty much falling apart and overall, not bad.  I think with a little more "doctoring" of the sauce and basically shredding the meat this will make some decent pork BBQ.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I added carrots to the other veggies and cooked it on high for the last 2 hours.  Then I thickened the sauce with a little flour/water mixture.  It will definitely be a regular meal in our house!!!!!

I made this today.  They aren't the best ribs I've ever had, but they are good for no more effort than they take.  Next time I think I'll add a tablespoon of Liquid Smoke.  I might thicken the tomato sauce to serve on the side after the ribs are done cooking.

Meat fell right off the bone. After removing the ribs from the crock pot, I brushed additional barbeque sauce over them and put them under the broiler to crisp them up a bit. Will definately make this recipe again.

Loved it, did add a little extra brown sugar, and some homemade BBQ sauce.  Turned out great and the meat fell right off the bone.

My family loves ribs- and this recipe did not dissapoint my husband or the kids!  It had a really great flavor- and the meat came out very tender.  I barely had leftovers to give my husband lunch for the next day!

My family didnt care too much for this recipe. I was asked to go back to my original recipe which is to just place ribs in slow cooker on high for about 1 hr then pour our favorite barbecue sauce over it and let it cook for an additional 6-8 hours on low setting or until meat is tender and starts to fall off the bone.

What a great recipe. This tates so much like the ribs my grandmother used to make in the south. Yummie! The ribs fall right off the bone. I agree with some of the others about boiling the ribs first not frying them. (Its healthier that way as well) I really enjoyed the sauce and all the veggies. Great way to sneak them in for kids who are picky about veggies. I also chopped up some carrots and served over egg noodles. As somebody suggested. It was wonderful. I highly recommend this recipe to all. Enjoy!

Very good.  I cut each rib in half to make them easier to handle and fit in my smallish cooker.  In the last hour of cooking I skimmed a good amount of fat from the sides of the container.  I did notice the sauce was thin, as other comments indicated; so right before serving I removed the meat to a covered casserole and added some cornstarch/water (crank up to high) before pouring the thickened sauce over the waiting pork, and served with egg noodles.  I also added 1-2 dashes of tobasco to the sauce before cooking, maybe next time a bit more, as we like some heat.  I will definitely make again now that the weather is getting cooler and I am in the mood for heavier fare. 
The leftovers are to die for!

This was GREAT.  My whole family loved it.  I have 5 children and they ate it up.  We served it with rice so we could spoon the tomato broth over the rice. Yummy.

Just for grins and giggles I added 6 cloves of garlic (minced) to the vegetables and dusted the ribs with smoked Hungarian paprika (plus added a little to the sauce) to give them a little smokier flavor.  End result...WOW!

Very yummy! All my children even enjoyed this dish!  I added garlic cloves to the recipe and let it cook on low overnight. The meat just fell off the bone!!  Only con is that it didn't have AS MUCH flavor as I thought it would have, but still excellent!  I will be making this again for my family another time!

This is a great easy recipe.  I boil the ribs (I use boneless) first, finish up the recipe as written, and come home after work to a great meal.  This is a great winter recipe.

Can't beat this recipe for ease. I found the sauce to be very thin and watery too, but I didn't mind it. I don't feel ribs always have to be slathered in thick BBQ sauce. If you do, this isn't the recipe for you. Overall, very tender and the taste was good. I'll probably try a different recipe for flavor though.

This recipe was great! I used 3 ribs (country style). I didn't have celery so I added carrots instead. I also added some BBQ sauce b/c other reviewers said the sauce was too thin by itself. I cooked the 3 ribs on HIGH for 1 hour then low for about 4 and the meat was just falling off the bone. Very tasty. I had a little bit of frozen corn left so I threw that in too. Thanks for the recipe Julie

We really liked these. I used some leftover spaghetti sauce instead of opening a can of tomato sauce and it worked great. I cooked these on high 2 hrs and then low for 5 hours. Served these with creole rice and sweet and sour slaw as sides. I will definitely make these again but add a little cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce just a tad, otherwise perfect! Very nice change of pace from bbq sauce ribs

Julie, Wonderful recipe...we loved the tang.  It's great for any kind of cut up pork...not just spareribs. I added8oz of portabella mushrooms. and substituted 2 cups of ketchup (Frank's brand) for 1 of the 2 cans  of tomato sauce .

I really liked this recipe. The tomato sauce, peppers and onions gave it great flavor, although it wasn't BBQ-y. I did only about 1.5 pounds of ribs, one can of tomato sauce and about half of a large onion. My 23 month old wasn't much of a fan, but my husband enjoyed them!

I ran out of time so I simply kept the crockpot on High for 5-6 hrs.  The meat was okay for tenderness - I'm sure it would have been better following the directions.  The flavor just wasn't my family's taste

Too much lemon for us and needs spices added.  I ended up putting the ribs on a pan, sprinkling with my favorite spices and grilled a few minutes.

I wouldn't call this a barbeque recipe but it was tasty. I added about 3 tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with enough water to dissolve cornstarch and added it to the tomato sauce to thicken the sauce. I also added a few generous shakes of granulated garlic and used boneless country style ribs. I will shred the left over meat and use it with the sauce on sandwich rolls.

Nice little slow cooker recipe for country style ribs.  This makes a thin graveyard so this will not be liked grilled or baked ribs.

I was a little hesitant about trying this due to so many reviews that claimed it was tasteless or bland, but I've been cooking for a while and based on the ingredients, it didn't sound to me like it would be bland. I'm glad I listened to my inner voice. The boneless country ribs I used came out nice and tender but not dried out. The sauce gave the pork a nice little tang, and it was anything but tasteless. If you want a heavy, thick barbecue sauce this is not going to work for you. But if you're looking for an easy meal with a lot of flavor, but where you can still taste the pork, this is the one. I'll be making it again.

I was skeptical to try this but it came out tasty! This recipe was super easy to make! The only thing I added was a tablespoon of barbecue sauce and instead of using white wine vinegar I used white wine.  My family loved it! I will definitely make this for my family again. Thank you

I was disappointed with this recipe because th ribs were floating in a thin sauce!  The picture looks like they were coated in sauce,  Yes, ..they were good, but don't  make it seem like the ribs r going 2 B coated with sauce! Very dissappointed.
