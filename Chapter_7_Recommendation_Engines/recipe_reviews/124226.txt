Excellent!  I used brown rice, omitted the celery, and used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom for the sauce.  All worked well.  Will definitely make these again!

Great for the whole family!  The only things I did different (because I didn't get a chance to go to the store) was use regular chopped onions instead of green ones, and I added about a half cup of sour cream to the sauce.  It was excellent, and even my three year old loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  It is hard to find meals my son will eat and he asked for seconds.  My daughter says "it's great".  I used cream of chicken soup because the kids don't like mushrooms (Next time I'll make two different sauces as I think the mushroom soup would be great).  And I added sour cream to the sauce to jazz it up and keep it from tasting like canned soup.

This recipe works well as a filling for stuffed peppers.  I boiled the green peppers for 5 minutes and then placed them in ice cold water.  I then prepared the recipe as directed but omitted the cornflake crumbs.  I cooked the peppers in the microwave on High for 5 minutes then added some of the mushroom sauce to each pepper.  I then cooked for an additional 5 minutes.

This recipe was pretty good... not a favorite, but I'd make it again.  I used a pound of ground chicken breast and that was way easier than using chicken breasts and cutting them up.

These rice balls were delicious and a great way to use leftovers.  They were easy to put together and a nice change from our usual fare.  I did add minced garlic and would add just a little more jazz the next time I make them because I felt it was just missing a little something.  I also did not have green onions so I used red onions, and bread crumbs in lieu of corn flakes.  I didnâ€™t bother making the gravy because I had chicken gravy left over from the roast.  This is a simple and tasty dish.

These were very good.  I use finely diced leftover chicken breast meat.  I didn't have cornflakes so used panko crumbs, and also didn't have the soup but had leftover turkey gravy so used that instead.  They were nice and moist even without the gravy and had great flavor.  Will definitely make again!

For as easy as this is, it was so good! I did use breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes and they were a little sticky to shape, but worth it! Great for leftover chicken...will keep it to use next time I have leftover chicken. Thanks for sharing!

My mom used to make these and this recipe is just as good as hers! I was so happy.  My husband hates mushroom soup however, but if you substitute cream of celery soup, it works like a dream.

This was excellent. Like another reviewer, I used regular onions as I didn't have green onions, and added garlic. I also used Kashi cereal instead of Corn Flakes, again, as I didn't have any. I was a little worried it would be too sweet, but it was still excellent. Even my 4 year old liked it, which is rare these days. Thanks!

Good basic recipe.  I used bread crumbs because I didn't have corn flakes.  Still good.

These were pretty good.  I myself couldn't eat very many of them, but my bf loved them, and has asked to put them in the usual rotation.  He also loved heating up the leftovers the next day.  My only real problem was they were quite mushy when rolling them up, so next time will use less liquids, and I may also play around with the spices a bit, possibly adding garlic and some herbs.

Thanks for the recipe...we made our exchange students "Korean Sticky Rice" in the rice cooker and the recipe turned out great..think we will use regular rice next time just to see the difference in rices. She asked next time if we could try it with Italian bread crumbs...think that might be good also..thanks for the great recipe..a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly all except the cornflakes... used bread crumbs.  DeLISH !  The touch of chili powder was GOOD.  Hubby agreed a little more might give it a little punch.  Also, the can of soup was not enough for all of the balls. I may use a little more milk next time to stretch it some.

These were good and my husband liked them too! He told me to keep the recipe - yay! Great way to use up leftover chicken. My only changes for next time would be to leave out the cheese (you can't really taste it anyway so can do without the calories) and probably reduce the amount of rice by 1/4-1/2 cup. Seemed like too much rice for me. Thanks for sharing!

We thought these tasted ok, but they fell apart. I added leftover gravy to the sauce to give it more flavor.  Glad I was able to put leftovers to good use, but not sure if I'll make them again.

This recipe was not only easy and quick to prepare, the balls were delish! I followed the recipe exact, except not as much chili powder since I had a 3 y.o. and a 1 y.o. for taste-testers. I didn't check if others had this issue but 1/2 c. of cornflakes was definitely not enough for the amount of balls the recipe yielded. But both littles and my husband loved this recipe! It was a hit! And a recipe that I will turn to when needing to use up that little bit of leftover chicken we seem to always have from our deli-rotis. chicken the night before.

My family loved these rice balls. It makes me wonder "why didn't I think of this before?" I have a 6yr old picky eater and let me tell you he couldn't stop asking for more. Thanks for this great idea!!

I made this recipe for my husband and he LOVED it! In fact we both loved it! I will admit i am not a whizz in the kitchen but this is an easy recipe anyone can make. I will definitely make this again... and again and again. Thanks!
