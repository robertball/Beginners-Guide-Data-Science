Papa Funk's Campfire Chili: "I am glad I halved, because this makes a boatload! Funky fresh and great!" So many ingredients that I thought would compete w/ one another, and I mean SO many ingredients making up SO much chili, that whew, I'm glad that I halved it from the get-go, b/c I still had leftovers for freezing! Was concerned about it being too thick going into the crockpot for that long, especially w/ relatively little liquid (incidentally, my only substitution was chicken broth for Yuengling, as the only beer we had around was /shudder/ Natural Ice) but it was the captial P Perfect consistency. It was a bit on the spicy side for my daughter so I had to scamper to make her a sandwich, but it was absolutely awesome for my husband and I.

Good recipe but too much for one crock pot unless there is a giant size out there I am not aware of. You need to 1/2 this one for sure or cook in two different pots.  Taste great though.

Best chili ever! The only thing we did differently was to brown the meat fist. Otherwise, it was incredibly flavorful! Used leftovers for chili cheese dogs, Delish! Definitely going to be a staple this football season while watching our Broncos kick butt! Thank you for sharing!

Delicious chili.  It does improve the next day. as most soup and chilis do. Adjust the chipotle to your desired heat level. I used black beans and white kidneys as that was in the cupboard

I made this in my instant pot. Browned the meat first, onion, tomatoes, peppers on the sauté mode. Added everything else, mixed it, and turned on the Instant pot for 18 minutes. Wow! So good.

Typical cheater's chili, lots of canned goods and extremely high in sodium. The best chili is made with venison, lots of roasted fresh chiles, fresh tomatoes, garlic, maybe a little masa and some dried beans if you must, but nothing out of a can. This recipe is OK if you want to skip some of the effort of making authentic chili. It doesn't taste bad, just not as good as the real deal.

It's fine, nothing fantastic or unique. Needs garlic, more cumin. Chipotle in Adobo is as overrated as sriracha in my opinion. It's good, but not a 5 star.

It was good!  Had to halve the recipe but, just so you know all chili tastes better after it has been cooked one day and reheated.  I saved 2 bowls of it for a cold day and I am looking forward to it.

My family and I loved it!  I especially liked not having to brown the meat first and all the fresh vegetables that went into the pot.

Phenomenal chili. The recipe made about two gallons worth so I froze a portion of it. Also substituted space dust IPA over the Yuengling and it came out great.

We were so impressed with this recipe that we tried it the end of July in 85 degree heat.  We cooked on the stove top as our crock pot was not large enough, and browned the meat first.  Made two changes:  1) instead of 3 lbs ground beef we used 2 of beef and 1 of lean port, and 2) we cut WAY BACK on both the chili powder only adding 2 Tbs, and 2 teaspoons of cumin.  Have to say, this is now our FAVORITE chili recipe.  WONDERFUL.   We ended up with 24 cups.

I made this chili with smoked preseasoned tri tip. Also left out sausage and adobo chili. A bit spicier than we like! Next time I will keep to recipe!

Loved this recipe! 
I’m vegan so I went with no meat and it was so good and really easy to make. I will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

A new favorite for our family!! Loved it!! I did half the amount of chipotle peppers, chili pepper,  and adobo sauce, But it still had plenty of flavor and just enough heat.

Delicious. I didn’t have all the ingredients but I had 95% of them. My store didn’t carry everything so I substituted similar ingredients . I browned the ground beef and the sausage together on the stove. I cooked it very well. Then I drained the fat and dabbed it with paper towels. Then added the onions and celery and cooked just a bit. Added the rest of the ingredients and cooked for about 2 1/2 hours after it comes to a boil and then simmer it. I also added about 1/2 cup chili powder total . It was perfect. I also used blue moon and it worked fine.

Did everything except browned the meat and sausage to drain the fat! That surely is too much fat 20% plus in my body unneeded!  It  was great without the extra greasy blah!!!

I made it as is, over a campfire. It was delicious! Everything tastes better over a campfire.
