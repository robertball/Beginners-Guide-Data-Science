I submitted this recipe, but somehow the directions were changed. The bacon pieces are supposed to be added to the bowl with the almonds etc.. before adding in the green beans. Also, the baking time before adding onion on top should be doubled. That was probably my fault.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and am just now remembering to post.  This was the best I've had in 25 years. was a perfect match for what my grandmother used to make. Only thing I changed was used a whole pound of bacon ( Who doesn't like Bacon)and used fresh canned green beans from the garden. Making it again for Christmas!!!! Thank you for posting this.

Green bean casserole is a favorite on it's own but add bacon and almonds and it's even better! I used Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup instead of the plain old cream of mushroom to add some color and a little more flavor. I also added a couple chopped baby bella mushrooms that were hanging out in the fridge. I'm not sure what other's have experiences, but 20 minutes in the oven and mine wasn't even warm in the middle. Mine took about 45 minutes total to get nice and bubbly; but I'm still giving it 5 stars because it tasted so good. :)

This is the best green bean casserole I've ever made. I used a whole pack of bacon instead of 6 slices. It took closer to 45 minutes than 20 to get bubbly, but it was delicious and worth the wait.

I used 1 pkg fresh green beans (blanched them for 3-4 minutes). 1 can of mush sup, 1 soup can of almond milk, 5 strips of bacon. sliced almonds and small container of fried onions on top. Cooked for 45 minutes. Everyone loved it. My husband said it was the best green bean casserole he ever had. Bacon DOES make everything better!

This was a nice twist on an old tradition.  The only thing I changed was to brown my almonds before adding to the casserole.  It made them stay crisper.  Otherwise home run.  Thanks for submitting.

I was very upset with this recipe mainly because of the picture.   I was looking for something different from the traditional green bean casserole and I chose this recipe because of the picture.   Once I added the cream of mushroom soup,  I realized it was not going to look like the picture.   Whoever posted this picture with the recipe should not be allowed to post anymore.
