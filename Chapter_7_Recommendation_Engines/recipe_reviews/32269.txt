Very yummy! I substituted the Irish Cream liquor for Irish Cream liquid coffee creamer and Splenda instead of granulated sugar and it was to die for! Top it off with a dallop of whipped cream.

A nightcap for the kids (without the Irish Cream ) and one for the adults! We made it for the first time today but we will be making this again and again and again...

GREAT chocolate drink--I've been looking for a good chocolate drink with Irish Cream and this one was perfect.  I made a big batch (for a party) using a ratio of one hot chocolate packet (dark Swiss Miss) to every 3/4 cup milk and 1 TB Irish Cream.  Blended it then topped each glass with whipped cream.  YUM!  It was a huge hit.  Thanks :D

I didn't use the Irish cream liqueur because I made this for my daughter and she thought it was the best  hot chocolate she has ever had.  Thanks for sharing

This tasted amazing. There is so little Irish cream in it, that it more just flavors the hot chocolate like a creamer. I used low fat milk and 1/2 packet of Truvia for the sugar. I just used the microwave to heat up the milk and water. I topped it with some sprayed whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. I might just whisk the milk up, next time with the Aerolatte, to thicken it up a little. I can see an Irish cream dairy creamer being a fine subtitute for this. This makes a nice evening hot chocolate, though. TY

Sipping this now...  I love it!  Husband just informed me that "this is yummy!" so it's getting 5 stars from us.  My only change was to heat everything in the microwave.  Water first to make my paste, then mixed that while I heated milk.  This is fantastic.  I might add some cinnamon or whipped cream next time on top, but perfect as is.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Delicious. I put 2 Tablespoons Irish Cream ( long day) and used splenda instead of sugar and fat free milk.
Totally justified.

I added a few dashes of aromatic bitters just to give it a little extra something, and it was glorious. This is *the* way I'm going to make hot chocolate from now on.

Really good! I had a nut milk on hand (cashew-almond) and wasn't sure how it would work, but it came out excellent! I topped it with some whipped cream and dusted with cocoa. More Irish cream wouldn't be a bad idea! A delicious treat! UPDATE:  Much better with extra Irish cream! Really yummy on a cold night.
