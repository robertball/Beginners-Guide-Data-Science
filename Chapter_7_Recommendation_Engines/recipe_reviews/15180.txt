These cookies are wonderful!  What an interesting mix of ingredients.  They do not flatten out; they are somewhat cake-like in the center, but slightly crispy on the edges.  My family and I loved them.

What a great cookie!  They came out perfect, moist and delicious.  I didn't have any nutmeg, so I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also used craisins instead of regular cranberries. The whole family loved them!

Good recipe. I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon rather than 1/2 teaspoon. I also used fresh cranberries I had in the freezer which I thawed, drained well and chopped. The cookies did not flatten so I know to flatten them in the future. Oh and I did not make the icing.

These were just kind of bland.  I followed the recipe exactly and expected more based on all the good reviews.

These turned out great. Everyone who tried them was pleasantly surprised at how good the cranberry and orange combo was.

This one was just ok. It was much more "cakie" then what I want a cookie to be, but the over all flavor is pretty good. I did like the orange flavor to it but my boyfriend didn't.  At first I didn't make the icing, but thought why not. I iced a few of them and the kids (of course) ate those up. Next time I will just stick to my usual cranberry oatmeal cookie.

This was the first time i have made oatmeal cookies from scratch.  They were good, they were less oatmealish and more cinnamon-ish. I also used the glaze on top and i think it was a nice touch.  One of my roommates said, "Heaven has entered my mouth in the form of your cookie!" Sounds like a winner!

Very good cookie.  Light and moist on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.  They reminded me of Christmas with the cinnamon flavor. Instead of walnuts, I used pecans. The only thing I did not like was the orange icing.  I thought it didnt taste good at all, so I chose not to add it to the cookie.  These cookies are great just the way they are!

Delicious, easy, and wholesome! I made these without the frosting, so I replaced the milk with 1/4 C orange juice and they came out fantastic! Even my roommates, 3 meat-n-potato guys, liked them!

I made these cookies for a Christmas party and everyone RAVED over them!! The glaze is pretty sweet, so i only used about 1/3 of the glaze. The cookies were a hit!

These cookies were just ok for me. I originally was just going to cook them without icing, but when I took them out they looked the same as they did going in! They didn't spread or brown at all. I followed the recipe, only using 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup margarine for the butter, and egg replacer. But I have never had a problem doing that before this cookie. They were also not sweet at all, so I had to make the icing to save them! And it did, the icing was quite good, but probably won't make these again, or will tinker with it. :)

Maybe because I used splenda instead of sugar, this recipe did not turn out for me at all.

My husband still is eating the cookies even though they turned out all crunchy and granola like.
