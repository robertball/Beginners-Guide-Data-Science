My husband and I really enjoyed this chowder! I used Jimmy Dean Hot breakfast sausage, so I didn't add the cayenne pepper (yes, I'm a wuss). My husband added the cayenne to his bowl at the table (he's not a wuss). I used evaporated skim milk because it's what I had and this still turned out great. I'm sure the regular evaporated milk or even half-and-half or whipping cream would have made it thicker and more chowder-like.

This was a fabulous corn chowder.  Instead of cans of corn, we used a 1lb package of frozen corn kernels and cut the kernels off of 4 ears of fresh corn to replace the creamed corn.    We were all scraping our bowls for the last drop.

This is quite delicious and VERY filling. I used ground mild Italian sausage and, since I didn't have any evaporated milk, omitted that. Don't think we missed out on anything. Maybe next time I'll pair this with some warm onion rolls. Perfect soup for a windy, chilly evening. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was delicious!  I had a pound of frozen corn that I added with the potatoes.  Then I skipped the canned corn but  still added the creamed at the end.  Served with cornbread.  ( Lots of corn this meal.)  Hubby went back for seconds.

The spiciness was just right. I think next time I make it, I'll use shredded chicken breast to reduce the fat and overall calories.

I used sweet Italian sausage that was browned and cut into slices. It may work better with ground sausage. I add heavy cream to make it a more creamy soup. I also did not use cream corn but used two cans of whole kernel corn and skipped the cayenne since my wife does not like spicy. I cooked it for 7 hours in a slow cooker.

Quick and delicious! I did use the kernels from 2 leftover ears if cooked corn instead of opening a can. I also had half a can of black beans on hand, so those rinsed beans also went in. Sausage I had on hand was  a roll of Jones sausage. Some warmed Italian bread will accompany this for dinner. Thanks!

My husband loved this.(That is a good thing, as he is super picky). Pretty much made as recipe states. Did not have onion (made hubby happy). Probably added a little more potatoes and celery than stated (did not measure). And did not add cayenne as I used hot breakfast sausage. If hubby liked spicy food, I would have loved to put the pepper. Will make again. Hubby wants me to try it with ground beef. Maybe.

I made this exactly as written (except I maybe put too many potatoes in it) and it was FANTASTIC.  I loved that it was super easy and the ingredients weren't hard to find.  My wife loved it as well and it made so much, we froze some for leftovers when we don't want to cook.

I used mild italian sausage; if using hot italian sausage I would probably eliminate the cayenne pepper.

Delicious! My husband loved it, and claimed it was a keeper! I used half n half instead of evaporated  milk, because I had it on hand. Also added some parsley for color. I think next time I will add some diced red pepper. Served it with some shredded cheese and a dollop of light sour cream. Very yummy!

Delicious. A bit too much sausage for me, but that is my own personal preference. Husband and grandchildren liked it.

Turned out great! I subbed some half and half instead of evaporated milk, which gave it the creaminess without making it overly sweet!

Absolutely supreme! This recipe earned it's spot as a "regular" at my dinner table. I make it at least two if not three times a month and more often during the fall and winter seasons. I follow this recipe for the most part exactly as ingredients are listed with only one slight change. I substituted chicken broth with unsalted chicken stock. In general, I prefer using stocks over broths so that is what my pantry had on hand. This last time I made it! I only had mild Italian sausage on hand and it tasted just as well, but with a tad different flavor.

My wife makes this for the family on cold days or just that "curl up on the couch with a movie" kinda day. I do add additional cayenne pepper since she makes it for the kids as well. This is one of our favorites.

This is very tasty. The only thing I did different was the addition of garlic. Next time I will also drain the whole corn before adding it to the pot. I will definitely make this again. It is excellent served with cornbread!

Very nice soup, easy and tasty. I didn't add quite as many onions because my hubby isn't fond of them.  But I will make this recipe again.

Made this chowder quite a few times adding more zip by using hot breakfast or Italian sausage.  It is very tasty and satisfying as well as easy to make.

I was skeptical with the cream corn and evaporated milk, but this was absolutely delicious. I used smoked paprika and did not use cayenne pepper.   Will definitely make again.   You will not regret it  if you make this.
