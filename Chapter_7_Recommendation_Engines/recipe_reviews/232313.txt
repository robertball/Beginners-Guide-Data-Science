This was a nice change!  I made a double batch for a large gathering and divided into two parts.  In one I added some dried cranberries and diced apple.  In the other I added about 3 Tablespoons of pineapple juice and 1/2 cup of diced pineapple.  Both were a hit!

Very nice and refreshing!  Added an extra tbsp. of vinegar and a dash of celery seed.  Hooray for non mayo based coleslaw!

Simple and by using honey (1 T), I was able to make it more paleo, less GMO.  OH, after marinating and refrigeration, was tasty and crisp.

This recipe is good, a little on the sweet side but nice and fresh.  I always make recipes without changes first and next time I might scale back a bit on the sugar and oil.  Its quite good as is but I think it would be good with a minor adustment as well.

I didn't have any poppy seeds, but I added celery seed, added a few chopped green onions and switched the sugar to agave syrup (only 2 tbsp.), and this turned out delicious. My husband and I both loved it! it was fresh and light which is exactly what we were looking for. it paired very well with bbq'd smoked pork chops and corn on the cob.

Enjoyed this as a light vinaigrette slaw.  Slight changes by using honey & dijon mustard were better choices for our family. A great healthy mayo free slaw.

I like this recipe.  I added dill because i love it and radicchio because it was in my fridge. Also, i hate carrots - so i used my food processor to shred some broccoli stems.  Aside from the dill - i didn't mess with the dressing.  Very good.

A nice alternative to mayo-based dressing for coleslaw.  Didn't have poppy seeds, so used 1 tsp dill (making 1/2 recipe), didn't want to use hot sauce, so did 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. Also used 1 tsp honey, since I don't really like sweet dressings. I think it could have used a little more salt, and I will reduce the oil next time, personal preference.  But I will be doing this dressing again.

A tad sweet with only 1 tablespoon sugar and 2 tablespoons light olive oil. Used lots (for me) salt and pepper but no hot sauce. With cilantro, would be great on fish tacos.

I never rate a recipe unless I follow the recipe exactly as it is.   This is a really good basic coleslaw that is nice and sweet yet tangy.  I love this recipe because after reading the dressing recipe once, it's so easy to remember that I won't need to look it up to make it next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Tried this recipe a week ago and have made it twice since.  Really good.  I added some finely chopped celery and onions and grated some radish and it turned out even tastier.

Great recipe since I don't like mayonnaisey coleslaws. I just used a 1 lb package of pre-made coleslaw mix, and it turned out great! (and easy!)

Just made it & loved it! I also added red cabbage because I had some. I didn't measure the cabbage..used half a head of green & a quarter head of red...it needed more dressing for that amount so I just doubled the dressing ingredients.  Easy & delicious & I will be making it instead of the mayo type.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This was a good recipe. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it needed double the dressing to really get the flavor. My husband is not a big coleslaw fan, but he really like this. I am happy to have a non-mayo version for my family. Thanks for sharing! (BTW, I served it alongside BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwiches, recipe also on this site.)

Very good dressing.  The only change I made was to increase the dry mustard to 1 t.  Received several compliments on it at our party.

I've always made creamy dressing, but I wanted something lighter to put on pulled pork sandwiches.  This fit the bill.  I served it at an anniversary party of 80 guests and they loved it.  My new favorite.

I used Splenda in place of sugar which cut the calories even more. This is a very good coleslaw. Would be fantastic on barbecue sandwiches.

I make this recipe often. I like mine a little more tart, so I adjust the vinegar and sugar accordingly. As much as I love hot sauce, I haven’t tried that. For my kick,  I add thinly sliced red onion.

I was not a fan of the addition of sugar and hot sauce to coleslaw but I’ve never considered adding poppyseeds or mustard powder so thank you for that!

Awesome dressing, just what I was looking for.  Fresh, tangy and full of zest.  I added green onions to the coleslaw because that is what my family likes. Save the recipe!!!

Added a little celery seed, used dijon mustard as I didnt have any powdered, added one heaped teaspoon of mayo. I probably used kosher salt and added slightly more black pepper.

If you’re watching your cholesterol or just tired of mayo-based coleslaw dressing, try this one. I used celery seed in place of poppy seeds and less sugar.

I've been using this recipe for coleslaw (and other salads) for a couple of years now. I make it exactly as written, only using red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce. It's my go-to!

This was pretty good. I made it as directed save for swapping Stevia for the sugar.  I agree that there should be more recipes that don't use mayo.

I used purple cabbage, carrots and onions.  It was a huge hit and goes well with pulled pork, sloppy Joes or bbq. 4th batch this month!  Easy potluck dish and since it doesn't have mayo I do not have to worry about spoilage.

Really good slaw.  Make sure to thinly slice the cabbage.  I subbed fresh lemon juice for the ACV, honey for the sugar and added chopped cilantro.  Was perfect on top of brisket sandwiches.  Thank you for posting.

Pretty good as is, but if you double the salt, it becomes spectacular.  Don't be afraid of salt, y'all!

Definitely will make again, since I hate mayonnaise.  I made this the first time subbing out cabbage and carrots for a pre-made broccoli slaw mix (shredded broccoli, red cabbage, carrots)

This makes the perfect portion for a 12 ounce package of slaw mix, in my opinion.

This is really good and to expedite the slaw, I cheated and used a bag slaw mixture:) ~ The only change I made was less sugar. I opted to use 2 tablespoons, instead of the 3 listed in the recipe. I'm glad I did, because, we think, even with 2 tablespoons, it's still a tad on the sweet side. Next time, I'll cut it down to 1, but everyone in my family really enjoyed (I served it with sloppy joes). It was good the next day for lunch too.

I was searching for a good Vinaigrette for Coleslaw to adjust to my low-fat. low sodium special diet, and was thrilled to find this recipe!  
I adjusted the recipe by omitting the poppy seeds, dry mustard, salt, and hot pepper sauce.  I substituted about 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. oregano, and 1/4 tsp. lemon juice,  I've made it numerous times in the past 3 months for my husband and I. Also, I made it for a family gathering and even those not on a low sodium diet asked for the recipe.
Thank you SusieQ for giving me the idea of how to make a good vinaigrette that I can enjoy that is low sodium and low fat. 
I made it to season a pasta salad for Easter dinner, tomorrow.

I made the dressing and tossed it with left-over shredded pork roast with mixed greens and red onion.  I then chopped the salad.

This is a great alternative to creamy coleslaw. I added a little more than the optimal amount of hot sauce and it was great.  Tangy with w nice kick of spice!

This isn't bad, but I still prefer a mayonnaise based coleslaw.  A vinaigrette coleslaw doesn't last as long in the fridge for leftovers. It wilts quicker.

Made this exactly as written. It is sweet and light. A perfect addition to a picnic table already full of mayo based salads.
