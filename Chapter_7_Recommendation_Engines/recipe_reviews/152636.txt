This is the first time I have been somewhat disappointed with a Baker's recipe, which normally I find reliably excellent. That said,  others may find this a 5-star cookie for the same reasons I find it worth only three.  I concede, however,  that it just might be a matter of personal preference.  For me this cookie is too rich, TOO peanut buttery, granted, not your usual criticism!  It almost reminds me of those flourless peanut butter cookies, which I detest.  These are chunky, soft and so rich as to  be just short of greasy.  So rich they feel heavy in my stomach.  I did love the chopped peanuts, which went really well with the milk chocolate chips I substituted for the chocolate chunks.  But these cookies are for SERIOUS peanut butter lovers only!

These are totally scrumptious :) I bought a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chunks to save a couple minutes of prep time. No modifications to the recipe were necessary, but keep an eye on the bottoms of these! A couple of them got slightly burned.

I give this 4 stars since it's the first one I ever tried for peanut butter. Awesome when you use whole peanuts and extra choc. chips with toffee bits. Make sure you allow the cookies to cool completely before moving them, otherwise they will crumble.

Very tasty recipe!  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because it came out a bit dry (I broke a wooden spoon trying to stir it!).  My guess is the all natural chunky peanut butter I used didn't have as much oil in it as the PB the author used.  I remedied this by adding about 2/3-3/4 of a single-serving container of applesauce, although I'm sure increasing the amount of butter would work as well.
