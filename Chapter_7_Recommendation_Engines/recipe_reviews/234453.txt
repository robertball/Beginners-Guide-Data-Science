I love this recipe!  I've been cooking it for years minus the anchovy.  I'll probably try it next time.  I use more wine and olive oil but no butter.  I also add a cup of the pasta cooking water to make it thicker.  Thumbs up!!

The first 2 times I  made this recipe I followed it to the letter.  This time I will be adding some fresh squeezed lemon juice.  It is just a preference of mine.  I love lemon.  Eugene,  many thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Very tasty.  I misread the amount of pepper flakes which I accidentally tripled so it had a great big kick!  Next time I will follow the recipe more carefully.

Oh my goodness...this was wonderful!  I added in some sliced mushrooms and 2 more cans of chopped clams, I like it meaty!  Also this recipe is even better reheated the next day!

I’ve made this several times, and it gets rave reviews!!! Just keep the sauce simmering and as it reduces, add more wine and clam juice. It’s so rich and decadent. LOVE IT.

I didn't have whole clams but used 2 cans of minced clams instead and only had anchovies paste so I used a two inch +/- amount of it. My husband and I were almost embarrassed at how we ate the whole recipe using 8 ounces of pasta! It is awesome and definitely we will be using this as a quick Sunday supper with quite regularity in the future

Excellent!  I didn't have fresh parsley or oregano so I used dry.  Added a few squeezes of fresh lemon and some clam juice.  Very good!  (Of course, make sure your significant other eats it too or the garlic breath will be off-putting, haha!)  YUM!

The dried oregano overwhelmed most of the other ingredients, including the lovely fresh parsley and the wine, and most importantly, the clams.

This was very good! I did use only 1 can of clams, which was plenty for 5 of us, used a tad more butter and skipped the oregano (just a personal preference). My Italian husband loved it! Seeing as he bought about 6 cans of clams recently, I think I'll be making this one again!
