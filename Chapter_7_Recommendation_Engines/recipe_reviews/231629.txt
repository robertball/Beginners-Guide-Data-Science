Not a bad side dish and even with yogurt my husband liked it. I doubled the recipe and sauteed the celery with coconut oil. Nice flavor. Made ahead and reheated later and it was still good to go.

Tastes like green peas with a hit of celery. Tasty yet I was expecting more.  My celery was home grown and much more aromatic and flavorfully stronger than store bought. The green peas still overwhelmed it. Perhaps more celery if I was to make another batch.

There must be an instruction somewhere missing as to how to not get the yoghurt to curdle. It tastes good, but how it looked and the texture of the curdled yoghurt

It didn't work for me either.  Tasted great, but curdled.

This looks so good and healthy but I must have done something wrong. My greek yogurt and milk looked like it curdled, it did not turn into a creamy broth.
