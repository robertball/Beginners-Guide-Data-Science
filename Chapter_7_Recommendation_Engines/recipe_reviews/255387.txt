I followed this recipe almost to the letter, but I excluded the chocolate chips and baked the batter in mini Bundt cakes, each about the size of a small muffin. I had never made these before, but I was craving pumpkin and decided to try a few things out. I filled a whole pan of 12 cakes, 11 of which I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. One of them I left plain. They tasted a bit weird warm, but once cool and with some more of the cinnamon and sugar, 11 Bundt cakes were heavenly. The plain one was, well... plain. In another pan of 12, I tried a few with chocolate chips. They were good, but I HIGHLY recommend lots of cinnamon and sugar instead.  Our company loved them, and they were demolished in a few days. I will definitely make these again.

Very moist, and light. I used a 6" bundt pan so this made 4 cakes. It did not have enough flavor for me. Maybe add more spice but it is a great base!
