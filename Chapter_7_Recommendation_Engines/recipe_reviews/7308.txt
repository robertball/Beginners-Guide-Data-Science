This recipe looks great - and I had already started on it when I noticed that we are told to sift together the flour, sugar, etc and then, later, are told to add 1/2c. sugar to the egg whites. That 1/2c. isn't listed with the ingredients! Are we supposed to set aside 1/2c. of the sugar to add to the egg or is that an additional 1/2c. ???? I assume it was supposed to be set aside; but too late! So I added 1/4c. sugar to the beaten egg whites and it turned out just fine. I also substituted mango puree for the apricot. A lovely, light fluffy sponge.

This was a nice spongecake but the almond extract overpowers the apricot flavor. I would probably add another 1/4 cup of apricot nectar to get more flavor. Also, with 5 eggs, there's a rather strong egg taste to the cake but still, it wasn't too bad. For the first review, you do have to set aside 3/4 cup of sugar because the recipe said to sift only 1/2 cup of the sugar.

I really like this cake, it was easy to make.  I took the advice of Smooshcrickets and added the total of Â½ cup of the apricot nectar.  With 5 eggs it did have a strong egg taste.  I make it for a church potluck and got rave reviews.  Next time I would use 4 eggs and more apricot nectar and make an  apricot glaze to pour over the cake.

I thought this cake was pretty good.  It had a nice spongey texture and a very good apricot flavor.  I didn't think the cake tasted too eggy and I did do less on the almond extract.  This cake also reminds me of a souffle.

In the pictures I posted, I made the cake in a cake pan and not a tube pan.  I also torted the cake into 4 layers and wrapped acetate around it.  In between each layer I filled it with an apricot diplomat cream and fresh sliced strawberries.  Then I glazed it with an apricot mirror glaze on top and garnished it with a few strawberries dipped in ganache.

It was definitely a big hit and everyone loved it!

Good cake overall, but there's a lot of egg and almond flavour. I'm  not going to make it again
