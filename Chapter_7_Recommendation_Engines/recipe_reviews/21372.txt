I elimintated the raw egg whites whipped into the pumpkin mixture by substiting half of an 8 oz container of Cool Whip.  IT was perfect.  My husband said this dessert was "maybe my best ever".  I shared it with all my neighbors & my husband took some to work.  I can't tell you how many people reguested the recipe.  10++++

This was an absolute hit!   Everyone loved it.  It didn't take too long to make or set in fridge and it was a nice light and cool alternative to pumpkin pie after a big dinner.  There are a few changes I made.  First - instead of a graham wafer crust I made a crust using a good quality ginger snap and left out the sugar.  I added a few shakes of ground ginger and ground cloves along with the cinnamon.   I believe the recipe should say 1/2 pint whipping cream, whipped as 1/2 pint (1 c.) of whipping cream is not near enough to spread on the top.  When whipping up the 1/2 pt. of cream, add a tsp. of vanilla and a tbsp. or more, to individual taste, of icing sugar.  Enjoy!

This recipe was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving.  I agree with other reviews to use Cool Whip instead of the raw egg whites. WE LOVED IT!!  I make this again & again. Congrats to person who sent this recipe to AllRecipes.

Excellent pumpkin pie flavor and creamy texture, plus it was super easy!  I replaced half the sugar with Splenda and it came out great.  Also added a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves to the pumpkin mixture, as well as some cinnamon to the crust.  I'm also going to try making the crust with crushed gingersnaps next time, just as a spicier alternative.  It didn't seem like I could taste the cream cheese layer, but maybe it's just one of those things that you can't taste until it's gone.  Looked very pretty with the layers though, and held together well.

Truly awesome!  The only thing I would do different is let the dessert chill for a couple hours prior to adding the cool whip.

excellent, must let it cool completely, though.  overnight in the fridge worked best.  i think it has more flavor then your simply pumpkin pie.

I love this recipe but to make it a little easier/faster i use a no bake creamcheese layer and people seem to like it more acutally. It's just 1 8oz softend creamcheese, 1 container cool whip, mix well and add sugar to desired sweetness and follow the rest of the recipe. At our family gatherings its the first dessert gone.lol.

This is absolutely delicious, and fairly easy to make. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was definitely the tastiest dessert on the table. I can't wait to make it again for a Christmas party at work.
The flavor is wonderful, and the pupkin is not too overpowering. I highly reccommend this.

This is a really nice change from the boring old pumpkin pie! I took it to a family dinner and everyone wanted the recipe. I too omitted the raw egg whites for cool whip and it was fine. I used fresh whipping cream on top which I whipped with 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp stabilizer which you can find at any cake and candy supply store. The whipped cream will not separate if you use this! Great recipe...will definately make again.

I always hate to give 5 stars because I am sure there is room for improvement. I had to scale the recipe so I think the size of my pan affected the final product but it was very delicious. This is great combination of two of my favorites cheesecake and pumpkin pie but does not weigh you down like cheesecake often does.

I thought there was too much crust, not enough cream cheese layer and the pumpkin layer had an odd texture thanks to the geletin.  Trying to add the whipped cream as directed is a disaster, be sure to cool first. Most of it has not been eaten, I will not make it again.

I used the cool whip instead of the egg whites and it worked great.  I ALSO omitted the sugar in the pumpkin layer.  The cool whip is sweet enough and we didn't notice the absence of the sugar at all.

My mom has been making this same recipe for over 25 years, and it is always a favorite among friends and family during the Holidays.  I'm making it myself for the first time this year. Just a side note, the raw egg whites have Never caused any problems to anyone, to those who may be worried about them.

I made this for Thanksgiving instead of a traditional pumpkin pie and everyone LOVED it. Like some of the other reviewers, I used cool whip instead of the egg whites. I also used pumpkin spice instead of plain cinnamon. My husband has already asked me to make it again since it was finished off at Thanksgiving.

This recipe was a big hit at my lastest church picnic.  It was the only dessert that was totally gone and my best friend and her husband had to fight over the last piece,lol... I used the whip cream instead of the egg whites and it worked just fine.  It's definately a good idea to make sure it's totally cooled before adding the layers.  Also, I used 'pumpkin spice' instead of just cinnamon and sprinkled the top with chopped pecans.  I'm getting ready to make this at least another 3 times this season!  I highly recommend this recipe!

Made this for the first time this past Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.  Took it to a family gathering and it was the only desert that was completely gone.  I added a little clove and ginger to the pumpkin layer, and sprinkled the whip cream with cinnamon for decoration.  It was wonderful!  Got lots of great comments from others on it.

I served this, plus 2 other desserts from this site, to my club ladies yesterday.  This was by far their favorite.  Got lots of compliments.  I was just glad there were two pieces left so that my husband and I could try it.  We liked it as well.  Since I was making so many desserts all at once, I was thankful for the ease in which this went together.

I liked this but my family didn't.  They wanted real pumpkin pie, and this was too light and the crust was strange, not crispy enough I guess. After two days in the frig it started to separate and get watery too.

Yummy!  I just made this for our Thanksgiving lunch at church and it turned out wonderful.  I thought about following the suggestion about substituting cool whip, but was afraid to vary from the original recipe.  I doubled the recipe and and made two large desserts.  It turned out to be more than enough for a crowd. Everyone raved about how good it was and wanted the recipe.  It was pretty simple to make (just make sure to cool all of the layers COMPLETELY before adding the next...I put them in the freezer to help cool it faster).  The only con was that it really did take 3 hours to make, so it is not a quick throw together dessert.  I will definitely be making this again.

In step 6, you have 2 steps. One that includes the saucepan mix and another that is the egg white mix. VERY CONFUSING! Recipe was a disaster. Especially last step, topping the dessert with whip cream, it totally melted and got chunky, it was a mess!

This was an awesome dessert.  I served it to 3 men who loved, loved, loved it.  I work as a first mate on a 110 foot yacht and all 3 guys think that the chef should add this to her menu for guests.  I don't even like pumpkin pie but this is totally different!

Made this to take to Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone said it was great.  I had a small piece, and just seemed good.  Things taste better when others make it I guess..

I love pumpkin and this hit the spot. The directions were a little confusing so I did what I thought went together. The only change I made was I didn’t use the egg whites but subsituted real whipping cream instead because let’s face it....real whipping cream makes everything better. I will make this again!

I have been making this dessert for many years as it is very popular with family members. As so many, I too, was concerned about the raw egg. I purchase pasteurized eggs to use in this recipe. Costs a little more,  but who wants to take any chances?

I used the recommended butter but used  unsalted butter with 2 cups  graham cracker crumbs!  Also used original Cool Whip mixed with 1/2 tsp vanilla and 2 tbsp. of powdered sugar.   It was absolutely delicious!!! A good change  of pumpkin flavor for around Thanksgiving!

Fantastic - not overly spiced.  Picky crowd of serious bakers all asked for the recipient.  I substituted the egg whites for whipped cream (only change)

Since I didn't have gelatin I dissolved 2T cornstarch in the 1/4C milk and added it in with the rest of the ingredients. I doubled the cream cheese layer and lessened the crust then baked it for 35 minutes. My family loved it and has requested it for Thanksgiving. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I attempted to make this recipe and unknown if I did it right it said bake 4 20 min in a preheated oven but did not say what the cheese cake mixture was supposed to look like when it was done. Unknown if I would like the recipe
