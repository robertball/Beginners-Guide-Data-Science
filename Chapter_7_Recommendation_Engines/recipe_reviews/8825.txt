I tried this out recently and it was great.  I'm only a beginner when it comes to cooking and this recipe seems pretty straightforward and easy to make.  Moreover, the ingredients were quite easy to get hold of which is a plus. I thought at first that it might taste a bit too bland since you don't even marinate the chicken in any sauce, you just basically fry it and then add ingredients while cooking. But I guess the key to the taste is letting the chicken simmer in all that pepper and garlic.  The second time I tried it was not as successful -- think this is because I used too much oil.  So the key is to let it simmer in as little oil as possible so that by the time you put in the water, the water can evaporate so that the taste clings to the chicken. Happy cooking!

Very good and tasty.  I made it with some modifications.  Rubbed the chicken with lemon pepper (as recommended by 1 reviewer) and italian seasoning.  I also added a squirt of lemon to the water for simmering.  Wonderfully delicious chicken.  Will definitely cook this again.  Thanks Lottie =)

this was very, very good - i have made it a few times with other cuts of chicken... i think that definitely using a cut with the bone in is the best...  
i did try it with boneless breasts & used them in a sandwhich the next day.. yummy!!  overall, I think this is a tasty recipe with subtle flavor... do not serve with an overpowering side dish!!!

My family really liked this chicken.  It was tender and juicy.  The skin stayed nice and crispy.  I did omit the crushed red pepper for my son and husband who don't like spicy food. However, the crushed garlic and salt added enough flavor that it was still good.  This is a definite "keeper".  It was also very easy.

This was so easy and excellent! For a little added tang, I rubbed the chicken with lemon pepper and added lemon juice with the 1/2 cup of water. Absolutely great!!!

I made this recipe for my husband after I had my daughter, and I needed something easy and good to make.  It was really yummy.  I added a touch of honey to the garlic to give it a little zest.  And used lemon pepper.  Served with cabbage, and white rice, it made an excellent meal.

We loved this recipe. There are no kids here but we enjoyed it.  It might be a little to spicy for children but mouth watering for adults.

My oven died on me so I was in search of a stovetop chicken leg recipe! This one is it! Very good chicken. I've made it three times now and I've managed to make it perfectly one time. The other two times I think I cooked too fast with the oil in the beginning step. Try try again! I'll keep on trying until I get it down! Thanks!

I bought some chicken legs on sale and was looking for a way to use them when I stumbled across this recipe.  These were yummy!  I made some minor changes - put s&p on the chicken before browning, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, minced jarred garlic (with a bunch of the liquid) rather than fresh, and chicken broth instead of water.  The cooking times and instructions were right on - the chicken was thoroughly cooked but still moist.  They had a great, brown sticky coating on them that had just a little zing due to the red pepper flakes.  My 3-year old daughter usually doesn't eat much meat at dinner - but she ate three of the drumsticks and wanted more!  (Unfortunately they were gone!)  I'll definitely make this again - thanks for the recipe!

This is definitely a good recipe.  It was well worth the giant mess that popping oil made all over my kitchen!  Next time, I am going to cook with one of those mesh screens to keep the popping grease in.  I made only one substitution -- 1/4 C. water and 1/4 C. balsamic vinegar (I don't drink so I just don't have alcohol around -- this came the closest to the white wine suggested by other reviewers).  I also do not have a garlic press so, after peeling each clove, I smooshed them with my large, chopping blade. I coarsely chopped them up and then scraped all the garlic and as much juice as I could on the block & blade into the skillet.  I have an electric stove so "low" heat doesn't cook anything -- I set mine to "3" (out of 10).  One reviewer said that they couldn't wait for the water to cook out so I balanced the skillet's lid half on and off so that the chicken could steam more quickly and the moisture would have some place to escape.  Everything came out great!

Delicious! I only had 6 chicken legs on hand. I followed the recipe except for one minor change. Instead of water I took a 1/4 cup and filled it half with chicken broth and half with honey. I simmered the legs in the minced garlic, broth, honey and crushed reds and it made a sticky, sweet and spicy glaze that I will use again for sure!

Yummy!  Served this with potato pancakes.  The blandness of the pancakes is a good offset to the spicy chicken.  I used legs only since I don't like thighs and used jarred minced garlic.

fantastic i tryed this recipe it was great
do not over do the oil , i am a bit of a garlic freak 
added two cloves to the pan plus what go's on top of the chicken . as the water evaporates the mixture should become slighly brown and thicken 
turn your chicken as it cools to recoat your yummy chicken. enjoy  O YA its a keeper!!!!!!!!!!

Needed a quick chicken recipe for some legs I got on sale this week.  I originally had poured some Italian dressing over them in the fridge but didn'tg have time to BBQ.  thsi receipe was handy. next time I won't marinade the chicken because it produced a lot of liquid.  Didn't have red peper flakes and I'm sure it would have been better with them.

My family and I thought this chicken was great. I had to alter the seasoning according to what I had. I only had one clove of garlic, so I used that along with a generous amount of salt-free garlic & herb seasoning. I used Goya brand Adobo instead of salt, and cut the red pepper flakes down to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons. I also added some Italian seasoning. It came out juicy, with a wonderful flavor. I think the thing that makes this chicken so good is the method of cooking it, not necessarily the seasoning. It would be great seasoned with anything your family likes. I will definitely use this method again!

I must have done something wrong because my chicken was bland, a little spicy but still bland.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and used 5 drumsticks. I couldn't taste the garlic, and I just didn't like it. Sorry.

After minor changes, the recipe came out great.  I used drumsticks but will use wingettes next time.  I used 1/2 cup olive oil but will use 1/4 olive oil next time.   I used 3/4 chicken broth but will use 1/2 cup of chicken broth next time.

I cooked this tonight using only the drum stick of the chicken leg.  I used 8 of them and followed the recipe as written except for I used minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh.  This turned out great!!!!  Will be making this again.

The recipe consisted of two steps, and I still managed to get it wrong. I was busy entertaining guests and ended up mixing step 1 and 2, but you know what? It still ended up tasty. I smothered the chicken legs in garlic and red pepper flakes before I started browning the legs. Because I did, the chicken did not end up having a strong garlic taste, which I did not mind. Also, I used chicken broth instead of water, and later made a thickened gravy to coat the chicken. After I pulled out the well-done legs, I added more chicken broth, black pepper, brown sugar, salt and flour, and let the gravy simmer for a little bit stirring occasionally. After the gravy was nice and thicken, I lathered it over the chicken. It was bueno!

We were rather surprised and pleased at this dish.  I have always had problems cooking chicken in oil as the skin tends to stick.  Still, the outcome was tender and delicious, as plain as it was.  I'd try some lemon juice or balsamic vinegar along with the water (or chicken broth) at the end of cooking.  Will make again, thanks!

So I was browsing for something 'new' but simple/fast to try.... Rather than using garlic cloves and salt.. I used garlic-salt and black pepper and omitted the red pepper.. the family loved it.. I will more than likely make again

Really good!  I left out the salt and added honey after reading through other reviews.  It had a very nice, strong aroma but a subtle, juicy taste.

Not so sure this is "Italian" chicken. It was quite spicy, not necessarily what I would categorize as Italian. I think the garlic and salt should be added prior to cooking, under the skin perse. Then it should go into the oven. Much better....

This recipe was surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much from looking at the ingredient list, but I was desperate for a chicken recipe that I could make from the pantry. The chicken was juicy and had a good garlic flavor. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I thought I would substitute crushed chili. Probably a mistake since the chicken ended up super spicy! But still, I think this recipe has potential. I might try it again and experiment a little with the ingredients. Just be sure to watch the cooking time. When I started, I didn't realize how long it would take to cook.

We tried this one recently.  I did rub with lemon pepper initially, as was recommended by other reviewers, and I think that was a wonderful addition.  My kiddos did think a few less red pepper flakes would be better.  I really liked the "stickiness" to the legs.  Even my co-workers were wanting me to share my leftovers the next day.  We have lots of mouths to feed and with chicken drumsticks being one of the cheaper meats we can buy, this will definitely be a make again :)

This was excellent the first time, the 2nd time I added a dash of Italian seasoning a dash of Cajun seasoning and a touch of fresh pepper and wow, it was excellent!

Well, I loved it after providing more flavor. Instead of just garlic, I put in a few tablespoons of checca sauce (raw garlic, grape tomatoes, basil, all chopped) along with a quarter cup of moscato (muscat wine). I usually don't cook with sweet wine, but boy did that make this turn out juicy and tender and flavorful!

This was unbelievable!  Cooked these last night and could not get over the ease of this recipe.  The chicken just fell off the bone.  The flavor was amazing.  I will use this recipe often when cooking chicken.  Followed it exactly and it was mmmhhh mmmhhh good.

Excellent! I think I may have put a bit too much water cause it didn't end up thickening up too much but still it was great tasting and my very picky little ones approved. My 6 yo said it was the best chicken she'd ever had. Will def staple this one.

It was good. we enjoyed it, but I definitely had to cut down the red pepper flakes. 1tsp instead of 1tbsp.

But we both did enjoy the meal over some rice!

I don't usually do reviews but for this recipe I had to.  This chicken was fabulous!  I made this for my husband and I with chicken breast tenders that we put over pasta with alfredo sauce and it was amazing!  I did make a couple of small changes.  I coated the chicken in chicken and poultry spice that I got from the grocery store before I browned it.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and put a little bit of garlic in the oil to brown the chicken with.  I didn't have any red pepper flakes and my hubby isn't a big fan of the spicy stuff so I substituted dried basil.  It was soooo yummy!  I think next I'm going to try it with full chicken breasts or thighs...I may also try Italian seasoning instead of the red pepper flakes just to kick it up a bit.  Awesome recipe!

Good, but very very basic.   It did have a bit of a fatty taste as well, but some people like that...   I did leave out the red pepper.   I like the method though, next time I plan on adding different spices to help it out just a bit.  I paired this recipe with the orange glazed asparagus from this site, and they went well together. :)

Used this as a base.  I dipped the chicken in egg then covered them with flour and paprika.  When I cooked the chicken, I added some white wine, a little butter, and some paprika.

This is a keeper!!! My husband loved it!!! As soon as I saw garlic and red pepper flakes as the main ingredients, I thought I'd try it since my husband LOVES garlic and red pepper flakes. I didn't eat it because I was eating leftover "Spicy Spud Soup" (which I got from this site a while back and it has become a family favorite). I'm not a big fan of chicken drumsticks, so the next time I make this for my husband, I'll use chicken thighs or breast for me. My husband told me to KEEP this one!!! Thanks for the recipe. It was so easy to make and used things that are "staples" in my house (a big plus).

This chicken was good but not great. I thought it was a little bland and the frying was a bit messy. My husband seemed to enjoy it and he's a picky eater so I guess I'll try it again with a few spices. Thanks for the post!

It was good but nothing real special. I took off the chicken skin and didn't add the pepper flakes so it may have been my own fault.

I haven't made this in years.  We moved, I lost the recipe, and every time I wanted to make it I was in such a hurry I didn't have time to look for it.  I finally found it and can't wait to make it again.  The only change I made was I sprinkled the chicken with Adobo seasoning first.  But it's not necessary.  Mmm.  So good I still crave it years and years later.

This was really good. I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I tried adding some cayenne pepper and oregano to make it more tasty. I think I'll experiment with some other seasonings next time. It had a kick to it so I was glad to have plain white rice and brussel sprouts to calm it down a bit.

This is a delicious recipe!  I did use lemon pepper on the chicken before I browned it like other members had suggested, a great recommendation!  I also added white wine while simmering, delish!  I served it with chicken flavoured rice, and poured the "sauce" over it, Yummy!  It does turn out quite spicy as a warning, if you're not into spicy food.  My husband and I loved it and will definitely make it again.

This chicken was not as flavorful as I expected. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a disappointment. Maybe it was just too much garlic for me and not enough other flavors.

Really quite good. I used chicken drumsticks and substituted chili flakes for the red pepper powder for added punch. Though I could not wait for the water to evaporate completely, the chicken still had a good flavor. I would use this recipe again.

Very good recipe... although I took some suggestions and added some italian seasoning.  I also sprinkled the chicken with some poultry seasoning.  My husband adored it and is taking it to work tomorrow.

These were good, but to me they didn't have enough flavor. Next time I'm going to tweak this recipe.I don't know what I will do different yet.
