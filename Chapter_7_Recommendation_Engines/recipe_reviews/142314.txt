Love roasted peanuts. Make sure you read the directions, the oven is turned off while the peanuts are in it. Came out perfect!

Trick here is to know when your oven is adequately "pre-heated"....which is difficult with my oven.  However, following the directions, the peanuts were no longer raw at the end of the hour, but I probably could have left them in another five or so minutes--or preheated my oven longer.  Very simple recipe which works.

This works better if you put the peanuts in the oven, then turn it on. Just be sure to turn the oven off when it reaches 500 degrees, then leave them for an hour.

I'm almost 70 years young.  I've been cooking for over 60 years.  Yes, I began learning to cook at about the age of 8 years old.  I live in Georgia, USA.  I have grown peanuts for most of my life.  I think I know just a wee bit about both cooking and about peanuts.

1.  All ovens do NOT reach the same temperature according to the indicator, be it digital or manual.  USE a "calibrated"
oven thermometer to be sure of the correct temperature.
2.  There are numerous varieties of peanuts which vary in size.  They also vary in the amount of "dryness" with which you are beginning.
3.  Read the directions for the recipes THREE times before you begin to cook ANYTHING.
4.  Follow the directions before you even consider changing the recipe.

Just a few words from the ancient cook.

if i could have given this zero stars i would have. my peanuts were burnt beyond salvageable. i followed the directions exactly. after ruining one batch i looked for some more recipes that suggest cooking for a much shorter period of time on a lower temp. i will try another, hopefully successful, recipe. this one was a big let down.

Did everyone who burnt the peanuts read the directions thoroughly? The oven is PREHEATED to 500 and then TURN IT OFF FOR 1 hour. Just checking :)

The temperature is too high.  400 degrees is far better than 500.

This is the best, 'no fail' recipe I've ever tried. I've shared it with many, many others and have never
heard anything but raving, positive reviews. Thanks so much!!!! (Just remember - PREHEAT first - TURN OVEN OFF next - ADD PEANUTS (I check them in 45 mins, and sometimes take them out in about 50 mins. for me - if my husband is home I may cook the full hour for him.)  Thanks for sharing - this recipe is BEYOND EASY.

This is a great recipe. We preheat the oven to 500Â° place the peanuts in the oven and turn the oven off. We leave them in the oven for 1 hour and they are perfect. That's how we interpreted the recipe. Delicious. Best tasting peanuts we've had. Yummm

My mom used this recipe plenty of times and it was great, but not reliable. Some would be overcooked if not stirred. The quickest method I have found is to microwave them for about 3-4 minutes in the microwave, then let them cool. They get crunchier as they cool. I do about 3 cups at a time in a microwaveable safe bowl.

I think this must be totally defendant on the stove. Mine were burnt to a crisp. I thought I might have finally found a no-fail roast method. I was sadly mistaken.

Easy, Perfect Results! What more can I say.. Follow instructions and you can't fail. Not to mention delish! If you burn em ya did something wrong. You can't burn peanuts in a preheated oven turned OFF
Thanks Kehn

Tried the recipe exactly, but the peanuts weren't roasted to the degree we like in our family. Left them in the oven after one hour, then turned the oven to 350 and roasted another 10 minutes. Perfect for us. I must say, the nuts I was roasting are large nuts, and may have actually needed more time in the beginning roast. Next time I'll try the original recipe, but leave them in for about 5 minutes before turning the oven off. Easy peasy!

Despite resisting temptation to check after 30+ minutes when it started smelling good, I resisted. Opened door when alarm went off after an hour and had a tray of black burned nuts.
