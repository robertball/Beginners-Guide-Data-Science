I made a trial run of these and cut the recipe in half just in case noone was a fan. I did the math for the sugars and did half and half of each so my cookies would be a lighter shade, like chocolate chip cookies. I also ground down the oatmeal in my blender to give it a less chunky consistancy. (We like our oatmeal cookies that way.) Instead of white chocolate chunks, I used white chocolate chips. The submitter suggested to preheat your cookie sheets  but I found that just preheating the oven was sufficient. Ten minutes at 350* lent to a soft, chewy cookie. Heaven in your mouth. Next time I'll double the recipe and share with my friends and neighbors. This would be really good with Craisins, too, I think. Next time, I might use all vanilla.

Super cookies!  I did not have vanilla or baking soda so I used 1 extra teaspoon of almond extract and substituted baking powder for the soda.  Wonderful texture and flavor. With an "air-bake" cookie sheet I had to increase the baking time to 18 minutes and they are perfectly golden.  These are now top of our list for cookies.

Delicious!! I didn't have macadamia nuts, so I used cashews.   Note that this makes a very large batch. I was overflowing my KitchenAid! Next time I will make a half batch. This time I froze half the cookie dough.

Amazing cookie! I love white chocolate macadamia cookies, and this is my favorite recipe! I blend my oats because I prefer the texture, used white chocolate chips, and left out the coconut, but those are just personal preferences. Some reviews suggest halfing the recipe, I think you can't have enough of these! I did and ended up with 26 large cookies. Delicious!

Very good...but next time I will cut the almond extract in half. It was a little too much & left an aftertaste.

Just okay. Not enough "oomph" to make these a cookie we feel the need to make again.

Good cookie, a little sweet but very tasty. If I make these again, I will add more white chocolate (I used half a bag of white choc. chips...next time the whole bag!), more mac nuts, and decrease the sugar a little.

I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting chopped pecans for macadamia nuts since I had none. But everyone who tasted the cookies loved them. I will definitely make them again

The first time I made these Cowgirl Cookies I followed the directions to a tee and they turned out wonderfully.  Next time I think I will decrease the baking time from 15 minutes to 13 minutes to try for a little softer cookie.

Love these cookies! I had to make a change though as I can't eat any kind of chocolate. I used vanilla chips instead and they are easy to make, the recipe makes a ton, and they taste INCREDIBLE!

We made these for our family holiday cookie baking day and they were a HUGE hit. I used all vanilla rather than vanilla and almond extract and they were delicious. The recipe makes a lot of cookies too which was great. 
Thanks for sharing!!

My kids made this recipe for a large family Christmas gathering. We typically make Cowboy Cookies, thought we'd try something different.  The dough was a perfect consistency and they baked beautifully. We like chewy cookies, so we pulled our cookies out at 12 minutes and let them sit on the pan for two minutes. And this recipe truly makes 4 1/2 cookies, but they didn't last long. Fabulous Cookie!! Baking a batch again today!

From the very first time I made this cookie, it has been a HIT!  People who don't like white chocolate LOVE this cookie.  People who don't like coconut, LOVE this cookie.  Hands down - everyone LOVES this cookie!
