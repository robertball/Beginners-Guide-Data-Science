I love this dish!!!! I also added sweet potatoes and celery root! I kept the garlic whole and added some shallots! Keep all the veggis about the same size to help with even cooking time and so no vegetables should start to burn.

I really love the roasted veggies. I added diced sweet potato and diced turnip after the first 15 minutes and they were wonderful. Be sure that all veggies are cut to approximatly the same size pieces so they cook evenly. Yummy!

Lovely recipe. I used fresh thyme instead of dried. Very nice change from the usual veggies we eat. The rutabega was a bit bitter, so next time I might omit that, but didn't affect the overall outcome of the dish.

Excellent dish.  I used turnips instead of the rutabaga and I added sweet potato.  It cooked in the time allotted, and was great!  My husband and 2 year old daughter loved it.

As a person who has always hated sweet potatoes, I am proud to say that this recipe allowed me to enjoy them!  I had also never cooked or eaten a rutabega, and LOVED it!

I used a white onion, cut in wedges, instead of the pearl onions, and left out the brussel sprouts.  My boys said it was too spicy (??) but the rest of us really liked it, even my daughter who hates potatoes.

Made this for this past Thanksgiving. Reduced the servings to only 4 since we were only feeding 3 adults and 2 kids. Tasty and very healthy option for the holidays!

Very simple and great tasting.  I sprinkle them with roasted slivered almonds.  Looks very pretty and adds crunch.  Always enjoyed in my family.

It was very good. It needed a whole 2 hours to cook for everything to come out soft and my boyfriend thought it needed a bigger pop of flavor but I thought the flavor of the root vegetables was enough. I will be making this again.

Good stuff Mainard!  DH thinks brussel sprouts are icky so I put in some broccoli spears the last 20-25 minutes.  I used 1/2 cup (or therabouts) of dry white wine for the liquid and sprinkled some paprika & hot pepper flakes on top.  Had a winter squash that I added (not exactly a root veggie, I know)!  Cooking time will be based on the size of the cut veggies.  I only like thyme in moderation so didn't use nearly as much as the recipe recommends.

I really love this recipe.  Sometimes I do not put in onions, or put in larger onions sliced into 1/6th wedges.  These veggies are a perfect complement to any roast, great for holiday gatherings, and yummy for a cold winter's supper.

I grow my own vegetables and I am constantly looking for new ways to prepare them. This was delicious and very healthy and easy to prepare. I am looking forward to preparing this for our next church supper. By the way, we live out in the country and are always looking for new ways to prepare our bounty. Thank you
