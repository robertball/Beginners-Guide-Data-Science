I made Dulce de Leche on the stove with milk, vanilla, and soda. It's quicker. 
If your buying sweetened condensed milk in a can, why not buy Dulce de Leche in a can.

I have made this countless times. It is very good. However I have never removed from the can to cook it. Honestly don't see any reason to put in a glass jar to do the same thing as I have always done in the can.
