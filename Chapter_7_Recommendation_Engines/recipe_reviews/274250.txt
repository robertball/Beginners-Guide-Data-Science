Super moist and delicious,  a bit too much batter per serving, though.

Delicious recipe. These were a hit with the whole family. I added pecan pieces, and sprinkled sea salt on the tops before baking. Yummmmm.

These were just what I was looking for, and so moist and delicious! I needed to use up some chopped walnuts and dried cranberries, so I added about 3/4 c. each. That really made them more interesting and added texture. I also got 18 muffins and will definitely make again. Thanks!

Very moist. Great taste. It made more than the recipe said; I got a dozen and a half from it. Will make again
