This is a favorite in our house, although I do not follow it exactly.  I use 2 packages of the sugar free, fat free chocolate pudding mix and 2 cups milk to make the filling, then stir in some whipped topping.  I add it to the pie shell, and add whipped topping on top without pudding mix in it. Finally, I grate some dark chocolate over the top as a garnish :)

What a wonderfully easy pie!  I changed it up a little bit.  I am a chocoholic...so the graham cracker crust just didn't sit well with me.  I made an Oreo cookie crust by crushing 18 Oreos and adding melted butter and pressing into the pie plate.  I baked it at 350 for 10-15 mins and let it cool before making the filling for this pie.  Once the fillings were added, I topped it with 3 broken up Oreos as a garnish (See my picture)...YUM!

Very easy! My family loved the taste.  I made this into mini pies for Easter, topped with sprinkles & cherries and it looked extra festive.  I was able to get 12 mini pies from the recipe as is.
