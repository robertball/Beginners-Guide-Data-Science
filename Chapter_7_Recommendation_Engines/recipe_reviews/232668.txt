I melted a tiny amount of butter (couple tbsps) and added the seasonings to the butter. I also increased the garlic and onion powder. Delicious and most definetly addictive. Next time, I will double the recipe.

The amount of oil for the popcorn was wonderful!  I didn't have that oily feeling as I ate it!  The heat of this was noticeable, but not overwhelming!  I'll be making this again!
