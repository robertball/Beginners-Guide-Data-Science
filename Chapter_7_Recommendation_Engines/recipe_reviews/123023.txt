What an AWESOME recipe!!!  I normally make no-bake gift treats with white or milk chocolate and decided to change it up this year with this recipe.  I have never eaten a "bark" before and it's crunchy!  A delightful surprise!  I made a half batch as a trial run.  It was so easy that I forgot to add the peanut butter.  It was good without the peanut butter but I ran back to the grocery store (1/4 mile away) and bought 5 more packages of the bark.  Then I made this recipe exactly as written.  I spread it out on wax paper on my biggest cookie sheet since I don't have the patience to do the drop by spoonfull method.  It takes literally less than 10 minutes from start to finish not including the time it takes to set which isn't very long. If you plan on making several batches to give as gifts if you do them back to back you can reuse the bowls you mixed this up in which saves so much time. I also bought the chocolate bark and plan on making this recipe with that instead of the white bark just to see if that is any good which I am sure it will be!  Please try this recipe.  Honestly, I am giving this as Christmas gifts to everyone we know!  The ingredients, nuts, rice cripsies, and marshmallows will make many batches so the major cost is the bark.  I have maybe $4 or $5 invested per family which is cheaper than a bottle of wine and it's so much more yummy!  If you are a smart shopper you can probably shop around to find the cheapest prices on the bark and other ingredients too.

Oh my! These are better than, well you know. Easy to make and the perfect combination of salty and sweet. I used the little Make 'n Mold(R)chocolate discs. They are sold in 2 1/4 lb. bags in the supermarket and work perfectly. I used the whole bag and it didn't make any difference in the way these came out. I can't wait to bring them to Thanksgiving Dinner. Also, I made a batch with milk chocolate and they came out great.

This has been my go-to recipe for more than 10 years and people in my office remind me to make it in November.  Sometimes I'll add a dark chocolate drizzle for that extra punch.  Delicious!

I came in to review this recipe and realized I had omitted the rice cereal when I made it!  I used dipping chocolate instead of white coating, and I simply poured it into an 8 x 8 pan.  It was so easy and ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  Will have to try it again with the rice cereal but it's great without it too!
