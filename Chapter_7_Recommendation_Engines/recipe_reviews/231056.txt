perfection!
i added sweet onion
didn't have dill pickles...so I added a tablespoon of sweet relish
didn't have chives...but hope to grow them this summer and will try with chives.
used dijon instead of spicy mustard because i prefer dijon.
added celery for the perfect crunch.
you don't need any other recipe...this is truly perfection!

Hubby loves mustard and he loved this potato salad.  You can certainly add celery for crunch and olives for contrast.  Thanks.

I never had chives in potato salad before, but it was a nice change.  Other than that, this is very close to the potato salad I make, except I use sweet pickles, yellow mustard, and add celery.

Delicious!  I used red potatoes, which I cubed before boiling.  Since we only had regular yellow mustard, I used that but also added whole grain dijon mustard and a little dill pickle juice.  I'll definitely make this again!

I feel like that amount of mustard was too much. I used less than that and it was a little overpowering. I didn't have red onion so I didn't add that. I had to use more mayonnaise than the recipe called for. I used bread and butter pickles instead of dill. I also added dill weed at the end. My grandma added pickle juice when she made potato salad, I'd do that and go with less mustard.

I added extra pickles and a little more mayo. I also added about a Tbsp of safflower oil to the mixture to make to creamier. turned out amazing! The only thing I would do differently, is cubing the potatoes before boiling.

This has become the absolute best potato salad I have ever made.  We both loved it.  I used French's new sweet mustard and it has become my favorite mustard. Do not change a thing.  Fantastic.

As a general rule I hate potato salad, but I always have to have a taste when it's available because every few years or so there is that one that gets it right and I love it. Anyway, this is that one. If you're into bold, pickle-y flavors, this one will deliver! If you like classic, bland potato salads then you should look elsewhere. I like to add dried dill to taste, but besides that I make it exactly as written.

I thought the dressing was too thin.  It barely coated the potatoes.  The taste wasn't great, either.

Excellent! I used half yellow mustard and half Dijon. My hubby doesn't even like potatoe salad, but he had 3 helpings of this and called dibs on any leftovers (there weren't any).
