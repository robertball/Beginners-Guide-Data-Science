This is great for a quick lunch -especially if you're using fresh tomatoes from the garden! I was a bit skeptical about the ketchup/mayo mixture but gave it a try anyway. It wan't bad, but I think I'll stick to my old stand by of just a simple slathering of light mayo!

Yum!  I really enjoyed this, it is nice & light.  I used fresh raw spinich, & added thinly sliced red onion.  Next time I will add more hot sauce as well.  This sauce would be great on a BLT as well.  Thanks Elaine!

DELICIOUS sauce- very original and interesting.  It's a healthy sandwich that's easy to make and is very palatable.  It's so good I plan on having it everyday for lunch this week.  In fact, I had multiplied the recipe for the sauce by 4 and stored it in a container.  By the way, a little more hot sauce is needed to spice and take it "up another notch."

I've never been able to stomach fresh tomatoes until now! This recipe is great and tastes wonderfully fresh. I added a slice of cheddar cheese and it rocked my socks.

Very good... like a BLT, minus the B.  I used spinach leaves instead of lettuce, like another reviewer.  I'm pretty lax in getting my veggies, so I took advantage of this.

updated: I substituted the lettuce/spinach for cucumber slices and added extra hot sauce and pepper.  Also used celery salt instead of regular salt, to go for sort of a "Bloody Mary" sandwich.  I liked it better.

This was a great midnight snack just now.  Had it on white bread, and was feeling ultra-lazy so skipped the lettuce.  My extremely dumbed-down version was STILL good enough for 4 stars, and I'm sure it will be even better the way it's written, so 5 it gets. :)  Also, I see much experimentation with this tasty sauce in my future.. will go great on an endless array of sandwiches, such as in a grilled cheese or a roast beef wrap, or maybe even as a dipping sauce for shrimp.  I dunno, gonna play with it.  Thanks a mill!

I used french bread which I had leftover in place of the wheat bread.  Instead of using the ketchup, I used a small amount of thousand island dressing mixed with the hot sauce.  If you like a "kick" with the hot sauce, use the amount in the recipe. Next time I will use less.  I also added turkey bacon.

I was a little skeptical about the hot sauce in the mixture, but it turns out fantastic.  It's sweet and just a little bit spicy.  This is a great lunch when you don't really want to make a big deal out of it.

I have great idea, Ok take tomato and cut in not so thick slices and put in a small pan or cookie sheet, salt and pepper a little oragano and grated cheese spray with oil, also you can top with what ever cheese, and bake on 425 for about 10 12 min. just watch. it is so good Oh also top tomato with fresh basi which I always grow. I just love tomato sandwiches.

Made this for my daughter for breakfast, but added an egg (fits perfectly when cooked in a bowl in the microwave) to the sandwich.  She really liked.  Did not put salt in the sauce, but did put a little on the tomato slices.  I don't like tomato so I just used the sauce and put my egg on the sandwich with a little cheese and real bacon bits.  Very good.

I have been eating tomato sandwiches for many years. I tried this mayo/ketchup combo and it just didn't work for me. I will stick with plain mayo. I often will put sliced cucumber on the sandwich too.  Doubly good!!

It wasn't bad. Kind of sweet though. It's a good sandwich for vegetarians or dieters if you use light mayo.

Delicious!  Great for a hot summer day.  I left out the salt (there is enough in the ketchup) and added a little more hot sauce and some fresh  cilantro.  Served it on wheat pitas.  We loved it.  My husband also added a slice of cheddar cheese to his.  Very good!!

This is fine. It's a tomato sandwich with ketchup and mayo. I was baking some other sandwiches so wrapped it in foil and threw it in the oven with the others; it was tasty, but nothing about it jumped up and sang Miraculous New Sandwich at me. Thanks anyway, though!

It's also called a "sink sandwich" because you eat it standing over the sink so the juice form the tomatoes can run down your arm and into the sink.  :-)  we eat them all summer with beefsteak tomatoes from our garden.  Tastes great with just mayo too.

It's hard to be out of tomatoes for a tomato sandwich...but..since they are not in season now, I tried this with roasted red peppers and spinach.  Yum!  Adding cheese would have been great, too.  Very good and cut into small pieces they work as an appetizer because the roasted red peppers are not as messy as sliced tomatoes.  Will be trying this again in tomato season, though ;-)

This was good. A lot like a BLT, minus the bacon. I used shredded lettuce and canned diced tomatoes, both were leftovers I needed to use up. I left out the salt, but other than that, I didn't change a thing.

I first had a toasted tomato sandwich in a coffee house in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1959.  Brings back fond memories.  As good then as now.

Yummy. I left out the lettuce because I don't care for it. I added ham and pepperjack cheese. This is the only way I will eat ham for now on. I can't wait to try the sauce on a blt. Thanks for posting.
