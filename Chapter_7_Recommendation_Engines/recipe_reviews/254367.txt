The flavor is 5 stars but I had too much water as well. I added another egg and more ground meat.  They took about 8 minutes to cook each batch as I poured them like a pancake.

Making this recipe was a disaster - I simmered it 3 times longer than the recipe called for and it was starting to stick to the bottom of the pan but was still was too watery to form into patties. Instead I ended up with a thick soup and now I don't know what to do with it. Too bad I thought it had great potential. I used red lentils instead of yellow in case that made any difference.
