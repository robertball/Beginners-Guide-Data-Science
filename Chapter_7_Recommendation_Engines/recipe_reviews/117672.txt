Tasty salsa! However, I wouldn't recommend following the cooking time here, you don't want tuna steaks done to the "flake" stage, that will leave them very dry. Try cooking like a rare steak (ahi tastes a lot like steak in my opinion!) at least leave it pink in the middle, I like it red, 125 degrees internal temperature.

This was a very fresh and relatively easy dish to prepare.  It also doesn't take much time to marinate the salsa.  I served it with white rice and peas and my husband gobbled it up!  A very attractive dish.

I made this last night & followed the recipe exactly.  It is a great dish...the pineapple salsa went really well with the tuna & the jalapenos gave it just enought kick.  I think the salsa would be good with other dishes too.  I will make this one again.

This was excellent! It was so simple and tasted wonderful. I made the salsa and served it on the tuna, while my fiancee ate in over a pork chop. We both loved it!

Very tasty; I did not take the time to chill the salsa down entirely.  I also sprinkled Penzey's Northwood's Fire on the tuna.  I placed it on a bed of romaine and added some fresh sunflower sprouts and a few crushed baked tortilla chips.

This was delicious!  The salsa is great but the one piece of advice I can give is to make sure you are careful with the amount of jalapeno pepper you put in.  Mine came out a little to hot even though I like spicy foods.

I thought this was a good idea, but overall it was rather bland,  I prepared it as instructed, and even added some mld green chiles, but I felt the tuna steaks needed more seasoning. granted my jalepeno did seem unusually mld. I prepared some blaceans with lime juice and green chiles and I served them on a palte with a corn tostada and the tuna over that.  I was preparing dinner for friends with food allergies, so I needed something gluten free and cassein free.

Great marinade.  I used tropical fruit in the salsa instead of fresh pineapple, it was both a time saver and tasty with the tuna.  Will do this again.

A flavor explosion. What an easy and great combination of flavors. This is the 2nd tuna recipe (Grilled Tuna Steaks with Grape and Caper Salsa) I have found on this site that should be in anyone's recipe book.   Thank you so much for sharing

This recipe is super easy and tastes delicious!!!  I used tilapia instead of tuna steaks and it blended nicely with that kind of fish as well!

just tried this with my wife and it is wonderful.  Can't wait to make the salsa for the summer and serve it with chips.  I think I will add avocado next time.

This made one special Mother's Day meal! Mom's watching her figure, so I knew I had to keep it healthy & low fat but still Yummy!I made the salsa per the recipe & added some lime juice to the tuna steaks & marinated them for about 2 hours. I then took out the tuna steaks & allowed them to come almost to room temp & threw them on my Paula Deen grill. Beautiful grill marks, nice fresh salsa & a happy momma! What more could you ask for?

This recipe was excellent, my husband and I both enjoyed it. The pineapple salsa really complimented the tuna. Sweet tasting, along with the zing the pepper brought to it.

This was a very good recipe. I like the grilled pineapple idea vs. fresh. However, I used less cilantro because I prefer lighter doses of it and feel it can be overpowering. I also added some fresh diced mango in which really added an extra flavor blast. I forgot to add the olive oil and it was still great but will drizzle some on the left overs and use on tortilla chips...yum!

Excellent compliment to the tuna and also good for just regular chips and salsa. Use gloves when cutting up the jalapeno!!
