Great recipe...can't wait for the holidays to try it out on the family.  As for concern about the eggs, you CAN purchase pasteurized eggs these days people.  Don't let the eggs prevent you from making a terrific pie!

It's a good recipe but not written very well especially for someone who doesn't cook a great deal. For example they tell you to put sugar water aside then refer to it as "Hot" sugar water when you beat it into the chocolate.However it's some work to get in done correctly if you're looking for an easy similar recipe  I would suggest FlourlessCake II I've made it several times and folks love it
