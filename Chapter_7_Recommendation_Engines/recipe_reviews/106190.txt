My husband normally doesn't like sweet meats but this one he raved about. I loved it too. It was perfect! The only thing I would change is I would make a double batch of the basting sauce and use 1/2 of it at the end to drizzle on top of the pork. We will make this recipe again.

I had the stove at med high, but the sauce just got so thick and smokey that it smelled up the whole house and was too thick to put on the chops.  Not much flavor after they were cooked.
