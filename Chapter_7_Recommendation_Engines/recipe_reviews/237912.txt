The flavor is okay, but would definitely be better with fresh herbs. My problem
 Is that there was way way too much oil. I wish I had followed what I know instead of the recipe. The noodles were dripping  oil. Very unappetizing. The oil can be reduced by 1/2. A Tablespoon or less in the water and 1/4 to 1/3 cup over the noodles would be so much better.

Very delicious. I gave it a 4 because everything can always be improved. I'm going to add mushrooms  next time. Fresh parmesan cheese was a nice compliment. Thanx!!!

This wasn't bad, just way too much oil.  Some people like that sort of thing though.  Thanks for the recipe!

You never need to put oil in pasta water - that is a myth and added calories.  The oil sits on top of the water, doing absolutely nothing regarding the noodles sticking together or not.  As long as you have a big pan of water, salted to taste like the sea, all you have to do is stir your pasta occasionally.  Pasta sticks b/c there isn't enough water in your pan and/or you don't stir it.  Stir it as soon as you put it in the water and then a few more times till it is done.
