Easy and definitely a feel good food. I didn't have brocoli soup on hand so I used cream of mushroom and added in some shredded cheddar cheese until it had enough cheesy flavor. The cheese made it thicker so I also added more milk for a better consistency. Everyone, teenagers and all enjoyed it.

Not quite enough flavor, but not terrible, either.
