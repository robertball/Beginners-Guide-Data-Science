I forgot to nuke the cauliflower before I mixed all the ingredients but they still baked beautifully. I used thawed riced cauliflower from the frozen section. Everyone in my family loved them including my very picky daughter who hates hashbrowns! can't wait to make them again.

Excellent recipe. I made it as it without any changes.  I did have a problem forming them into patties because they were too wet. I believe I didn't wring the cauliflower dry enough...my bad. Next time I will do a better job. Even still they were fabulous. Hubby raved about them too.  I topped mine with sour cream since that is totally within my Keto diet. 
Thanks so much Nicole.

These are great and fit into my diet so I love them .  With all cauliflower recipes the ricing and squeezeing out the moisture can be a pain and messy but well worth it.  I made the a couple weeks again and followed the recipe exactly they were good but lat night I added an extra egg and cooked them in the waffle iron. WOW took them to a new level.  A few crumbled but once I got a technique going to get them out of the iron it worked perfectly.  Anybody wanting to be adventurous should try this.

If you eliminate the bacon bits, cheese (for those of us who dont sit well with cheese), table salt...and replace the table salt with pink Himalayan salt you have a very healthy breakfast full of minerals

These are super delicious and easy when you use frozen cauliflower. They are small but worth it. I followed the directions without any changes. Thanks for such a great recipe.

These are so easy and delicious. I think I might fry them a little after they bake for extra crispness.

I grated the cauliflower myself so prep time was more like 30 m. and used cheese cloth for straining. Easy to put together, my husband & I enjoyed it with tilapia for dinner. Will definitely make again & share this recipe.

Really good!  I didn’t add as much cheese and did jalapeños instead of green onions.  May try it in the air fryer next time to get it more crispy but very happy with how it came out!

I didn't use bacon and added more salt and peper. Recipe was 20g carbs and made 9 hash browns at 2.2g carbs each. It was so good and I will definitely make it again.

One of the best hash brown recipes I've ever found! My only problem with these is that they stick to the pan, even a well greased one.

The trick is to not overcook in the oven. I burnt mine too much for my liking but if you really watch it they are great alternative to potato hash browns. Good recipe.

The hardest part is grating the cauliflower, it got everywhere. But these are delicious.

I made this twice. The first time the way it said to. Very messy.  I ended up having to put it all in a casserole dish. It came out fine. But I think like another reviewer said maybe pan fry after baking to get crispy? The broiler didn't really work. It was hard to make the oval shapes too. The second time I stuck them in a muffin pan in order to get a shape(did not fill to top). Maybe a mini loaf pan would work too if you want rectangles. I was able to get 7 out of the muffin pan. I also used half cup of cheese the second time because I wanted fewer calories. The whole thing was just under 500 calories and the individual cups were about 68 calories each. They tasted good. They probably would of tasted better frying them afterwards but I was being lazy. lol

The hash browns were gobbled up by my husband and I. Ours didn't look like the picture, but the only changes I made we're adding the bacon and green onions. I also used half Colby Jack and half mozzarella cheese. They turned out really crunchy. 

I will definitely be making these again! Husband put Sriracha on them I had plain with more salt on top.
