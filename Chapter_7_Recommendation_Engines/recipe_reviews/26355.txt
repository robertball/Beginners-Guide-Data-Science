Here's how to make it a five star:

As it was, this recipe was likely about a four star, but with a few improvements, it's easily a five.  Canned chicken creeps me out too (as one other reviewer stated), so I used 3 real chicken breasts.  While boiling the breasts, I sauteed the onions and peppers for about 5 minutes prior to adding them to 2 cans Mex stewed tomatoes (which I had chopped), 2 can of chili beans, and a half jar of jalapenos (which I had chopped).  After the chicken was cooked through, I melted about 1 T of butter and sauteed 2 cloves of garlic, then added the shredded/cubed chicken and seasoned it with about 2 T of Frank's Red Hot.  I then added it to the pot along with 1T of cumin and 1T of chili powder.  Then added 1 can of chicken broth and 1 can of water.  About 20 minutes into simmering, I noted the soupiness, so I mixed about 3T of cornstarch and 3-4 T of water together, and then added it to the pot and mixed well.

It turned out amazing... thick, healthy, delicious, and just the right amount of spiciness not to interfere with the flavor.

I also served it over a slice of wheat bread w/ a piece of fat free cheese on top... outstanding :)

This was amazing! I added an extra onion, lots of garlic, used less jalapeno and cumin and real chicken cut up into tiny little bites and prepared it in the slow cooker, amazing, spicy, flavorful! Definitely more like a soup. I put it over brown rice for a healthier option, Incredible!

I took a chance on this recipe because it sounded spicy and I'm glad I did! It was WONDERFUL! I used real cubed chicken breast(something about meat from a can doesn't sound appealing) and halved the recipe. I used 2 1/2 cans of Rotel tomatoes instead of the stewed(too slimey). I used black beans instead of chili beans, a whole can of sliced jalapenos,1 tablespoon of chili powder, and 1 tablespoon of cumin and the can of chicken broth. I only needed to add about 1/2 cup of water after it had been cooking a while. Although this dish was too spicy for the rest of my family to eat I really enjoyed it! Thanks!

This was excellent very easy to make.  It was more of a soup than a chili but it is a great and very filling soup.  I didn't add any water just 5 cups of chicken broth.  I only added 1tbsp of cumin because it is so powerful.  I also added basil, bay leaves, and thyme.  A really great and easy recipe, everyone liked it a lot.

Very easy and flavorful- but I generally like spicy things, and this one was a little too spicy, even for me!   I will make it again, but will use less jalape√±os next time.  Also- it did store very well, I made the whole 15 servings, and froze half. A month later I put that half in the crock pot for about 8 hours and it tasted just as good as the first time around!

So great!  I agreed with the other reviews...too much water, I cut the recipe in half, and took out one cup of water.  I added a can of Kidney beans and eliminated the bell peppers.  I also added about 3 tablespoons of flour to thicken the soup.  wonderful recipe!  Very easy, very quick!

I cant believe how yuumyy this is.  I had a can chicken and found this.  To keep it super simple I used dried shallots and dried green and red pepper. Delicious! I'm so surprised.  Given the simplicity and flavor this is 5 stars!!

I have to be honest... I was looking forward to this chili all day.  The first batch I made was so blazing hot, no one could eat it.  So, I made it a second time without the jalapenos~  still pretty darn spicy.  Next time, I'll make a few more adjustments.  The consistency was great and sooooo easy to make.  I'm going to keep trying :)

This was awesome!  And I even used the canned chicken!  Didn't have jalapenos so added more red pepper flakes.

I think those that were freaked out by the canned chicken missed the part where you were in college. This sounds like a poor mans chili! It was actually really good. But, having graduated from college twice, I don't do canned anything anymore if I can help it. So, I did mesquite smoked chicken breasts (4 medium) and I had a few chicken legs left over that had been cooked over smoke the previous night. I combined that with some turkey sausage I smoked with the breast and went from there. I didnt use near the liquid required. And I used chicken stock the whole way. Six cups I think and I still had to thicken it with some cornstarch (but not much). Also tossed in a little cayenne, ground mustard. This was a good recipe and it tasted even better the next day. Thanks

this is fricken amazing! i love the taste! i found that my crockpot wouldnt boil this much even after an hour, so i put it back on the stove to finish it off. I also recommend adding a bit more chicken and even some ground beef to it (since I'm a meat fan). Other than that it's muy perfecto!

Did recipe mods based on another member's review. Used precooked chicken fajita meat (was in my freezer). Sauteed onion, green pepper. Added tomato, beans, mild chile. Sauteed some garlic with chicken - into the pot with the rest added a bit of hot sauce, cumin. Had it with nice fresh bread.

I have made this recipe dozens of times - it's so easy and delicious! I don't use canned chicken; I use the breast meat of a rotisserie chicken that I get from the store and I use lots of cumin. You can change up the recipe any way you want - I don't put in bell peppers but I add chopped celery. This is one of my favorite recipes of all time! And you can freeze the leftovers - if you have any!

I made this chili but it came out more like a soup.  I only used 5 cups of water and it was still too soupy.  I ended up mixing cornstarch and water, then I added it to the chili.  It really thickened it up nicely.  

I did not really like this recipe.

This was very easy and delicious.  I did however use only half the jar of jalapenos, and it was pretty spicy.  If I had used the whole jar I think it would have ruined it.

THIS RECIPE WONDERFUL.  BUT OF COURSE I CHANGED IT UP A LITTLE FOR OUR TASTE AS WE HAVE LITTLE MOUTHS TO FEED.  I DID NOT DRAIN ANY CANNED ITEM.  INSTEAD OF JALAPENOS I USED A LARGE CAN OF DICED CHILIES.  ALSO CHOPPED UP TWO STALKS OF CELERY, BUT I DID NOT USE ANY OF THE WATER AND IT WAS STILL MORE SOUPY THAN CHILI WE ARE USED TO BUT GREAT.  WE ALSO GARNISHED WITH SOUR CREAM AND CHEESE.  AND ATE IT OVER CORN BREAD.  WE PLAN ON ADDING THIS TO OUR FAVORITES LIST OF MEALS.

This chili is so good!  Really really hot.  I cooked it in the slow cooker with chicken breasts that I shreaded later.  I used less water and more garlic.

YUUMMMMMY! This is an flavorful, delicious yummy chili recipe, that is so easy to make. We used the new pre cooked Tyson chicken chunks in the cooler section of the grocery, and replaced one green pepper for a red one. Added some light cheese for added flavor. Yummy! Thanks Todd.

This was so great! I did make these changes however......
I halved the recipe and used 2 chicken breasts cut up (not a canned chicken fan), 2 cans of beans, can of corn, and crushed tomatoes as opposed to stewed (personal preference)
This does pack some heat, which we loved. This will be a regular for us!!

I made this the other night.  I cooked my chicken and onions and seasoning in slow cooker all day.  After work I added the remaining ingredients and simmered.  Excellent with a dollop of sour cream and cheese on top.

This chili was fantastic.  I cut the jalepenos in half because my fiance isn't into hot foods, but we both absolutely loved this.

Absolutely DELISH!  I did boil 3 chicken breasts then shredded it instead of the canned chicken and only added 1 cup of water.  I also added 2TBS flour mixed with 1/4 cup of cold water to thicken it just a bit.  I let it simmer only 30 minutes because I was short on time.  The flavor is soooo good and it does have 'heat' but we like it that way - even my 10 year old daughter!  Will make again and again...yummo!

Amateur's Light Breeze Chicken Chili Haiku: "Gasp! 10 cups water? That's gotta be a typo. This still tasted good." So I used about 2 c. of shredded chicken that I'd frozen a couple weeks back, drastically cut back on the water (maybe 1 c. at most) and I had to use 1 can chili beans, and 1 can kidney. Dumped it in the crockpot b4 work, and came home to a chili that was still on the watery-side, due to well, the 3 undrained cans of tomatoes, the chicken broth, and the water, that as I said, I'd reduced. I thought it was pretty dang tasty, and probably one that I'd consider making again w/ 1. add garlic 2. drop all water 3. fresh jalapenos, or no jar at all and 4. fresh chick, not canned.

This was good! I followed the recipe but added only half the recommended liquid, and that was a vegetarian broth. As advertised, it is very hot, which suits me fine, but if I were making this for guests, I might decrease the jalapenos by half.

Excellent for a cold and rainy Sunday afternoon!  I had tons of turkey left over from Thanksgiving and used that instead of chicken.  Also, I didn't use the water and it simmered down to a thicker chili.

Made this soup per husbands request. Taste sooooo good. Great for a stormy day. It's flavorful and a little spicy. It's more of a soup then traditional chilli. I would definitely make it again :)
