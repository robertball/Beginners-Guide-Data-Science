This was fantastic! I did make some minor adjustments to the recipe. I used one 14 oz. can diced tomatoes and one 14 oz. can of tomato puree instead of the 28 oz. jar of pasta sauce. I used cream instead of half and half, and I added 1 Tbsp. of sugar. We served it over cheese tortellini and it was delicious!

Yum.  I could eat this sauce with a spoon.  Very delicious.  I used heavy whipping cream since that is what I had, and then tossed it with 24 ozs cooked spaghetti.  Think next time I will use less spaghetti so that it is saucier.  I wanted to dip my bread in this.  Will definately make again!

Winner Dinner!  What a easy & wonderful tasting sauce.  I used Classico Traditional Sweet Basil sauce.  I loved the hint of nutmeg in the sauce (I used fresh grated nutmeg, so it may have been a bit stronger).  Teamed with Fast & Friendly Meatballs from this site for a family pleasing meal.

This was very good. I used milk instead of half and half and some stewed tomatoes blended up instead of the pasta sauce. It took a while to boil the extra liquid off, but it came out great.

Thank goodness I heeded others advice about the excess sauce - used 12oz pasta instead of only 8oz and it still alot of sauce leftover. BUT it was delicious! I too used a "garden chunky" pasta sauce (that has green peppers, onions & mushrooms) and I steamed some fresh broccoli - I placed the pasta on the plate, then the sauce, then the broccoli and finally, sprinkled the parmesan and a little mozzerella cheese overall. Very "pretty" and VERY tasty. No guest would guess that it was soooo easy to make. Thank you much Brenda!!

very easy quick dinner. The key to this recipe is it will only be as good as the ingredients you use.  So, if you try to get away with a cheap spag. sauce, you may get a bland result. The higher quality sauces tend to have little chunks of veggies and more flavour to start with, therefore, your end result will be more flavourfull.  I also added roasted red/yellow/orange peppers.

I have done this before but completely forgot about it!  thanks for the reminder.  Lorrie

While this was good, it was a lot of work for something that you can pretty much get from a jar anyway - for example a pasta vodka creamy tomato sauce.  I did make it exactly what the recipe called for and served it over tortellini, but it is definitely NOT a quick meal.  It takes some time to prepare.

This was perfect. I used a can of tomatoes that I simmered down for the sauce and then added the rest of the ingredients. Can't wait to try it with tomatoes from the garden. I really like the nutmeg and used 1% cream instead of the half and half.

Sorry, this was just kind of boring for us. I love vodka cream sauces and don't find them to be bland at all - maybe that is what I was missing from this. I will not be making again.

I modified this recipe a bit.  I didn't have nutmeg on hand so I omited that.  I threw in some frozen veggies (peas & zucchini), meatballs, & mushrooms to get a balanced meal.  The sauce was a little bland for me so I added a little bit of salt.  There is definately enough sauce for 12-16 oz of pasta.

Based on the recipe only- not very good. I added heavy cream, sweet italian sausage, extra garlic, onions, and sweet cream butter.

Bland.  Just OK, at best.  Honestly, I'd rather use the spaghetti sauce by itself.

OMG This was soooo good!.  Took other cooks advice and used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half.  Also added a small yellow onion and meatballs. Served it with "Cheesy Garlic Bread" and it was a fantastic meal!

So easy to make.  I used it with a shrimp and linguine dish.  My husband was skeptical, but went back for thirds! :)  Will definitely use it again.  It's a nice change from tomato sauce, and not as fattening as alfredo.

So awesome and super easy too.  Very creamy and tasty.  I made my own homemade spaghetti sauce as usual and added the cream.  Wow, I could really hurt myself with this.  Am thinking would be really good with some fresh scallops!

Loved this recipe.  Used a tomato-basil off the shelf jar to start with and used 3/4 cup heavy cream.  It NEEDS chopped plum tomatoes to get more of a tomatoey taste for certain, which I didn't do the first time I made it, and regretted it. Then it makes for a perfect tomato cream sauce.

This was a great recipe, but I would make a few modifications for the next time I make it.  Most importantly, I want to make more sauce and to give it a stronger tomatoey taste next time, I believe I will end up doing 2 cans of diced tomatoes, then adding 3/4 C heavy cream.  I also added chicken, which was good, very similar to an amazing rose cream pasta I enjoy at our local italian restaurant.

Delightful! i call this 'secret sauce', no need to tell of the hidden ingredient - the cream!!! i also add a teaspoon or more of sugar to 'wake up ' the sauce - and it is VERY good, i like it served with sausage, peppers and onions - spooned over a roll for a sub like sandwich, YUM!

I thought this was a nice & easy way to change up spaghetti night.I added a 14 oz. can of stewed tomatoes and used allspice instead of nutmeg.After reading a few reviews I also used spaghettoni instead of angel hair.We had no leftovers.

This sauce is really easy and quick to make, and it's delicious. My family loves garlic, so I added an extra clove to spice it up a little. I also sprinkled some cinnamon in it while it was simmering, and it was actually a pleasant flavor. Great dish for a last minute dinner.

I made this when mother was visiting.  I thought it was fine, although I needed to substitute the pasta sauce with tomatoes.  It was okay, but not flavorful or deep enough for regular rotation cooking.  I wouldn't make it again.  I added meatballs and back bacon to the sauce, and used 1% milk in place of the cream.

Very easy sauce.  Did not have nutmeg, so didn't use that.  I sauteed chicken and onions and the garlic prior to adding other ingredients.  This was a fabulous sauce and the kids all loved it.

I would probably give this 3 stars because I thought it needed a lot more salt and seasoning, but my 13 year old said "you should make this all the time"  Both kids went back for seconds and the 13 year old picked up on the creaminess of it.  I will probably make this again with some added seasoning.  Thanks for sharing.

My family loved this recipe. Even my steak and potatoes husband. My mother-in-law called it gourmet, like from a restaurant! WOW. I did make more pasta than called for to accomodate the amount of sauce.  Served with butter steamed broccoli and frozen pierogies, a GREAT light meal.

We enjoyed this very much.  I added sausage to the sauce because you gotta have protein to make it a meal!  Also used fettuccini noodles.  I think the angle hair would be too delicate for the sauce with meat in it.  The flavor was excellent!

This is really good...I used a LOT of garlic and a bit more onion...but it was tasty over-all.  Not sure why others don't like this. It's better then any jar-sauce out there! :)

This sauce has a very light taste that I prefer over the darker red pasta sauces. I think the only change we made was adding a bit more garlic. As someone suggested, make sure you get a good quality sauce. I think that makes a difference. This one is a keeper. Thanks!

This was EXCELLENT!!  I left out the nutmeg, and substituted rice milk and 3 T of rice flour for the half-and-half (my son is allergic to dairy).  My husband said it tasted like it came from a restaurant!!  :-)  The whole family gobbled it up.

This was great!  I love creamy tomato sauces, and this was so easy to make!  I used Ragu "Traditional" spaghetti sauce, left out the nutmeg, and added about 1/2t. cayenne, which gave it a nice spicy kick.  I have a feeling that some of the people that thought this was bland may have misread the recipe and used plain tomato sauce instead of a jar of pre-made spaghetti sauce.

Excellent creamy flavor. I made it with a spicy tomato sauce and it balanced well with the half and half.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only changes I made was to use whole wheat pasta instead of regular and I used fresh basil.  I will definitely make this again.

The sauce turned out beautifully.  I used a cup of skim milk instead of the half and half, so mine was a little thinner...but it still tasted great.  I also left out the nutmeg, and added a little oregano.  After serving the sauce on angel hair one night, I used it in a lasagna the next day and it worked so well...I'll definitely be using this one again.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This was absolutely delicious! I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half, and I also diced some red onion to put in the sauce. Incredible! Although you may want to use either more pasta or less sauce... There was a LOT of sauce. I ended up using a spoon and just eating the sauce plain, it was that good. Thank you!

I used heavy whipping cream instead of the half and half and omitted the nutmeg and basil.  I used a chunky pasta sauce and this was excellent.  I served it over linguine and added some shrimp to the sauce--with a salad and homemade bread, this was a wonderful meal.  This will be added to my permanent box!!

i think this recipe could be quite good, hence all of the high ratings....but the nutmeg just destroyed it for me!! i debated about adding it, standing over the pot with the spice in my hand...decided what the heck and put it in.  my mistake...  :(  i couldn't eat it.  i know that sounds ridiculous for a pinch of a spice, but it just didn't do well on my taste buds.  kids picked at it, hubby said it was so-so.  if i made this again, which i think i will, i will omit the nutmeg for sure!

This recipe is best served fresh and really wasn't very good as leftovers.  I used penne instead of angel hair pasta and that seemed to work well.  My husband did not care for this at all.

Really quick and easy, and very delicious.  I used fresh basil to brighten it up a bit, and I used less half-and-half -- probably closer to half a cup.  I'll make this again.  A nice change from Marinara.

I used 16 oz. of angel hair pasta, but next time would do 12 oz. or so.  The pasta sauce was plenty salty so I omitted the salt, reduced the basil to 2 tsp. and increased to 4 cloves of garlic.  I also opted for 2/3 cup of heavy cream instead of the cup of half and half.  The whole family loved it and it was super easy.  Good recipe!

A nice alternative to the boring old spaghetti sauce. I like the creaminess, and I like the spice. The half and half makes this sauce almost taste cheesy. It made quite a bit though, and it was a little runny for my taste. But it tasted good.

Simple, yet super good!!! I made this for some family and a friend when I was first learning how to cook. Now, quite frequently, that friend asks me to make it for her (since she herself doesn't cook much). I always serve this with some garlic bread. YUMMY!!!

pretty good. just not favorite among favorites. i was too lazy to press garlic (just finished baking brownies and hot cocoa) so I just used garlic powder. don't think i used quite enough but i eyed it, i'll just add a smidge more than i think necessary next time. also i added left over diced tomatoes for the night before and i think i'll add more fresh t'maters next time too.

A good twist on the ordinary canned sauce. I used the Newman's own with all the spices, so I went easy on the basil and garlic and served over tortellini. Yum!

I really enjoyed this. I made my own red sauce to which I added cooked Italian sausage, crumbled and drained. This is a very comforting recipe. I might add some finely chopped bell pepper the next time around, or maybe sprinkle it with capers. Thanks Brenda!

This was a good sauce recipe, but I did make a few changes. Not fond of jarred sauces, I used canned diced tomatoes and added chopped onion as my sauce starting point. I added more garlic and some parmesan cheese to the sauce as it cooked for more flavor. I also added just a touch more half and half for a creamier texture. My sauce did thicken as it simmered and as recommened I made more pasta than the recipe stated. It turned out quite good- I will make this again, but with my variations.

Very good and close to what I was looking for.  I was trying to find a recipe for a tomato cream sauce to put over grilled chicken and pasta that was very similar to the meal they serve at Red Knapp's restaurant. I added a little red pepper flakes to mine for some heat, but it's good without it, too!  One suggestion I would definately make is that you puree EVERYTHING chunky.  It seems to come out better that way!  Definately a keeper!

This was actually very good for doctored up jarred spaghetti sauce. I used all heavy cream since I was out of half and half and no milk either. I cut this down to 1 serving and it was plenty for my husband and I. He didn't even mention the nutmeg and he is super spice picky so I guess that means it passed his taste test. Thanks, this is a keeper!

My husband said this was good but the recipe was a disappointment to me.  I was expecting the half and half and spices to give the red sauce a more drastic transformation.  This just tasted like slightly altered red sauce to me and I added more of the spices then the recipe called for.  Sorry, I won't be making this again.

I changed this some..I sauteed a little extra minced garlic & onions in a little olive oil first then added some of my homemade tomato sauce.  I let it simmer to reduce and thicken, then added cream and parm.  Served w/ cooked shrimp over shredded spaghetti squash.  Yum.

I liked this recipe mostly because I didn't want to be bothered with making the sauce from scratch.  My boyfriend thought that it still tasted mostly like marinara, and while I partially agree, it was a pleasing departure from traditional spaghetti.

I really enjoyed this cream sauce recipe although I made some changes.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of jarred pasta sauce.  To flavor it I threw in a chopped onion, garlic, oregano, fresh basil, salt, pepper and nutmeg.  I poured it over cavatelli pasta mixed with broccoli, peas, mushrooms, and ground turkey and baked it until it bubbled.  yum!

This was perfect! I had been looking for an easy tomato-cream sauce to add to my staple recipes.

I used a 26oz can of my favorite sauce which was already highly seasoned (it was the garlic & onion version), added heavy cream, salt and pepper to taste. 

It was just what I have had in restaurants, but could never duplicate at home.

This time around used it with cheese tortellini.

This one is a KEEPER!!  So versatile, and tastes like you've been cooking all day.  I left out the nutmeg since my gang doesn't like it and substituted garden chunky sauce for the tomato pasta sauce. Can't wait to make it again and again.  Thanks Brenda!

OUTSTANDING! But angel hair pasta cooks in 2-3 minutes, almost before you have swirled it through the boiling water. I used Hunt's canned spaghetti sauce which relies heavily on tomatoes.

Made a big hit with my wife on this one. I started out halfing the recipe since it was just for her and I... but as I usually do, forgot I was halfing it midway through the recipe. I put the full salt, pepper, basil and garlic in it... but it turned out great! I never use nutmeg, so I left that out. I did add some sliced Rogerwood Smoked Sausage which some extra flavor and I used penne pasta. Home Run! This is a keeper.

soooooooo good. i made this a long time ago and didn't care for it. but this time i made it with francesco rinaldi original sauce and it was amazing. it's a bit sweeter than other pasta sauces but that's what did it for me. what a difference a dish can have depending on what brand of sauce you use. my family and i kept dipping our bread into it. i'll be making it again this week.

I thought this recipe was just ok.  I thought it was a bit bland, this even after I added mushrooms, capers and chicken.  Perhaps it needed more garlic.

My husband, who is generally less than thrilled when I make pasta with traditional meat sauce, seriously perked up when I presented him with this wonderfully creamy tomato based sauce.  I used a good store bought sauce with black olives and mushrooms and used whipping cream instead of half and half.  He was impressed!

Very simple to make. The only change I made was to add fresh basil rather than dried. It was delicious. Served with stuffed pork chops and broccoli, red pepper, mushrooms in butter sauce and fresh Alaskan sour dough bread. A speical occasion meal.

This was very easy. Family loved, except for my 5 year old! She said it was "hot." (spicy) Maybe I'll use less basil. Don't leave out the nutmeg! What a wonderful spice! I'm not sure if I like this better than my regular spaghetti, but it's nice for a change. Use 12 oz of pasta- I used thin spaghetti.

Nice, the comments about the ratio of sauce to pasta are spot on. Using a 'ridged' pasta shape would help with a thin sauce like this.  And I agree with the person who swapped out the pre-made pasta sauce for tomatos. Jarred pasta sauce varies so much in quality and ingredients that I would rather work from scratch.

This recipe is fast, easy, and so good.  I used whipping cream instead of half-and-half and omitted the nutmeg (didn't have any on hand), and it was still good.  The only thing I would change would be the amount of pasta - there's too much sauce for just 8 ounces of angel hair.

Superb.  Sauted shrimp / chicken can be added if desired.  Thanks.

This pasta dish was excellent.  It tasted like something you would get at an authentic Italian restaurant!  I will definitely make this again and again!

I had left over thickened cream and found this recipe yesterday when I was planning to make pasta for dinner. It was very easy, smelt wonderful and went down with a "this is a must again"! Thank you for sharing!

This was pretty good. I was hoping for something spectacular. I was really in the mood for a good pasta dish with a great cream sauce. Still looking but wasn't bad.
