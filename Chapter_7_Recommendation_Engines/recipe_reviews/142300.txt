WONDERFUL!!!!  This is a very old family tradition!  We do it a little differently by putting the pudding on the cake then covering the pudding with the whipped topping.  The crushed heath bars are a must!  Someone said they didnt know what they were for....well, they're for texture, crunch and flavor.  It's like asking what the chocolate chips are for in a cookie!  Because they make it better!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, my grandmother use to make this at every family festivity.

This is an INCREDIBLE recipe!  I made it for my family at Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from everyone.  Problem is it is hard to stop eating until it is all gone.  This has definitely become one of my favorite desserts.  AND it is SUPER easy to make.  YUMMMMM!

I have made this recipe with "Butternut Bars" and it is delicious.  I am sure that any of your favorite candy bar(with crunch)or pudding flavors would work. I got my recipe from my Mom's (Kate Linville) church cookbook.

I make this for every holiday and party. People always love it and look forward to it. If I canâ€™t find Heath bars I substitute butterfingers.

There was nothing special or great about this. It is what it is...pieces of angel food cake surrounded with pudding. I don't understand what all the great reviews were about.

I made this with a Snickers bar and two chopped granny smith apples, and it was incredible. Great recipe!

Super easy and quick! Great cake to whip up before dinner and enjoy over a few nights! It can easily be changed with different puddings and angel food cakes! I made with sugar free fat free pudding, skim milk, and fat free cool whip. Tasted great!

I was looking for a quick and easy dessert to whip up and this one was a winner. I brought this to a family gathering and everyone gobbled it up! SO good. The Heath Bars are a must!

Super easy and very good! Only thing I did different was layer in large glass bowl as it didn't fit in my 9x13. I've done this again with vanilla pudding and fresh strawberries. Plan on trying banana pudding with bananas next!

I liked this and so did everyone at my church small group.  I just didn't really understand what the candy bar on top was for.  Maybe I made my pieces too small, but I couldn't really tell they were there.  I don't know if I would pick to make this one over some other recipes I have though.

I just made this for a church dinner and people couldn't say enough about it.  It's very easy to put together, and very easy to double if you have a big enough pan. I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he devoured it. and was very excited that it was a green cake. I thought it was great, except there was a little too much pudding for me and it could definitely be prettier.

Very easy...I made this for my son's birthday.   There were many many skeptics in the crowd....mostly asking, "Is this finished?"   YES...  They LOVED the cake even though it looked a little bit unconventional.

Omitted candy and used lite whipped cream. As revised, 180 calories per piece. Perfect recipe for quick prep, and calorie conscious. Thank you!

This really could not be easier and it is very good. I couldn't find toffee chips so I substituted crushed Hershey chocolate bars. Worked OK

This is a little weird. We enjoyed it but there's something odd about the consistency. Get past that and I think anyone (especially kids) will enjoy this recipe. More candy bar would be a very nice improvement, or at least some chocolate chips. The pudding is pretty one-dimensional. And angel food cake is very bland. If you're looking for something different and easy this is a good choice.

Super easy and everyone loved it! Sure its not a complicated recipe, but it was a crowd pleaser that I would make again! Great for a short notice party.
