This was so easy and very delicious! I tweaked a few things: I used 2 1/2 c. of applesauce, 2 onions and 1 1/2 c. of white wine. I also seared the pork chops in an electric skillet, then turned down the temp and let everything simmer for almost 2 hours. Pork was tender, sauce was delish! Will absolutely make again!

Tasty dish for a fall comfy dinner.  I did cut the applesauce in half.  Only change would be to cut the onions thicker, not thin as they disappeared.

I was looking for something different yet easy to do with pork chops, and came upon this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and my husband couldn't say enough about it.  He loved it, and when he says it's a keeper, it's a keeper.

This recipe was very good, but instead of the wine, I used apple cider. My family loved it, served it with mashed potatoes, and veggies.

I used apple sauce I had made from scratch the dau before and added two onions and thin slices of apples with and added sprinkle of nutmeg, to the electric skillet I used as the previous review had recommended. My husband was shocked when he realized I had made these delicious chops with apples! Mixed vegetables and butter parsley potatoes and beer to wash it all down!  ENFOY

I made this with 8 chops to suit my family, and there was WAY too much applesauce.! Next time I will cut the applesauce in half and seasin the chops a little more. Also two onions would be good, since they cook down quite a bit.

Fantastic meal! We had smaller pork chops but next time it will be the big, fat ones - and we will have this again soon. Definitely use chunky applesauce and we had half white wine and half chicken broth. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I thought the recipe was good. It was nice it had few ingrediants and was easy to make, but I will probably only make it again if I have left over wine and applesauce I need to use up.

I was looking for something to make with a few left over pork chops, apples, and onions that I needed to use up.  I was also in the mood for pasta...  I found this recipe, read the other reviews, and decided that serving it over pasta might actually be good!  Crazy, right?  Well, it IS good!  Go figure!  I have never made anything like this before, but it worked  out just fine :-)  I may share this with my daughter so she can try it out on the grandkids!

One of my new favorites!  This recipe is a great combination of being easy and tasty.  I used natural (unsweetened) applesauce and pinot grigio for my white wine (...I used closer to 1 1/2 C of the wine since I had to cook this in 2 skillets because I couldn't fit all 4 of the chops in one skillet).  My whole family (including 2 picky little guys) loved it.
