My husband has been hounding me for chicken cordon bleu for a while.  However, it's a little tough to make with a toddler and a newborn, so I was happy to find this recipe.  I used 4 large boneless breasts that I butterflied and stuffed each with a slice of ham and Swiss cheese.  I used a box of Stove Top stuffing mix, but only added 2 tablespoons of butter.  It was a hit and my DH said he would be happy to have this every couple of weeks.  We will definitely be eating this again.

True-this is not a true cordon bleu. But its a good recipe with the same idea of cordon bleu. And its a good crockpot recipe-which I am always trying to find a good crock pot recipe. If you want, you can butterfly the chicken boneless chicken breast and stuff it with the ham & cheese. Or you can pound the breast flat and roll the ham & cheese in the chicken and lay it in the crockpot with the seal side down so that it doesnt come undone (use a toothpick if you are nervous about it-just besure to remove it before serving). And cook it that way. This isnt a bad recipe, but I needed to add garlic and leeks to the pot. I live for spices. I will make it again and most likely butterfly the breasts and stuff them. But next time, I may add some white wine to the mix.

I made this last night for company and it was a huge hit. Our friends wouldn't leave until we gave them a copy of this recipe. The one thing I did different was to butterfly the chicken and roll up the ham & cheese and stuff it inside. This worked perfectly to keep the cheese in. I will definately be making this again!!

This recipe was a hit, I snuck this in on a weeknight for the fiance that "hates chicken cordon bleu".  She definitely does not hate it after this, and even asked me to make it again.  I did try it withe one BIG change.  Instead of adding the box of stuffing, I added a box of those cheap scalloped potatoes to the top and about half of the seasoning packet from the boxed potatoes.  It turned out phenomenal!

Based on the previous reviews I waited until the last 1-2 hours before I put the cheese and stuffing in, and it turned out great!  If you use larger chicken breats, it's a little hard to serve out of the crock-pot, so next time I may just cube the chicken and ham.

This slow cooker recipe needs some flavor enhancement, but it was a hit with my company.  When I make it again I will had some thyme and perhaps some garlic, and I will use a crock pot liner, as the bread crumbs stuck to the crock pot securely around the edges!  Definitely will cook it again.

This was an amazing idea for what turned out to be a wonderful meal.  I used ham chunks, halved the chicken breasts, added a can of chicken broth and half a minced onion...simmered all day.  Thickened with a cornstach slurry.  Layered in the swis cheese.  Coated the stuffing with butter and topped the casserole...let it cook for another hour.  So so so so yummy!

This Recipe was fantastic.  I put the crockpot on high and it was done in just over 2 hours.  It was a great first time crock pot experience.  I was on weight watchers at the time; I replaced the milk with Skim milk, LOW FAT cheese, 1/2 fat soup, margarine instead of butter and it was DELICIOUS.  My fianc√© LOVED it and he is not a half fat/diet type of guy. [I only told him afterward]

the stuffing really added to this recipe.  I used turkey flavour, which was left over from Christmas.  I put some on earlier than added the last 1/2 package later, because other reviewers thought it got soggy.  
Mine was cripsy and very nice.

Good, not great. The chicken got so tender it fell apart, which I was not expecting, so that made it different than I had anticipated. It was pretty salty with the ham, cream of chicken, cheese, butter, and seasoning from the stuffing. I think next time I will omit the butter and instead pour the remaining soup over the stuffing. But, I plan to make this again, it's great cold-weather food.

We loved this.  I followed the advice of a few reviewers and I just drizzled chicken stock over the the stuffing on top of the chicken.  It cut back on the butter and it made the chicken SO moist. Also, I cut slits in the chicken and stuffed in two slices of ham and swiss cheese, then also topped with a slice of each, then the stuffing. My boyfriend LOVED it...and he loves Cordon Bleu.  I ended up cooking it for about 5 hours on low, and the chicken was very tender, almost falling apart. But we loved it!

This is an excellent recipe.  I opt to do it as a casserole rather than in the slow cooker as it looks nicer to serve to guests.  I simply mix the soup and milk in the bottom of the casserole dish, toss cooked cubed chicken and ham on top, cover with cheese, the the stuffing mix moistened with water and a bit of melted butter.

After reading thru ALL the reviews I was a little timid about this recipe. Everyone either loved it or hated it. I made a few changes based upon what others had issues with. Since this was going to be in the crockpot for 9 hours (while I was at work) I opted to cube up the chicken, cube up ham steak and cube up a few chunks of cheese. I then doubled the soup and milk and left for work. When I got home it was really runny so I tossed in the stuffing and let it cook for another hour and 1/2 and it was PERFECT!! I will definatley be making this one again. Next time I will do everything the same, except I won't double the soup, since I didn't have an issue with dryness. Great comfort food for a cold day. Thanks for a very easy pleasing meal for my family!

Served this a few days ago. My husband and I loved it. He has requested that this be in our regular rotation. This was so easy and took little time to prepare.  The chicken was so tender and the stuffing added a great touch. I did hold off on the cheese and added it just before serving so it didn't disappear. It melted nicely over the top of each chicken breast. Will be making this again and again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I have used a very similar recipe for years with my oven... never thought of usind the slowcooker! We have a busy household with lots of mouths to feed... so I always chop the chicken and cut up the ham & cheese into small pieces... cooks faster & easier to dip out for our busy family... and also allows a few more servings by not using breasts!  A great substitute for the real deal... which I haven't made since before the first child arrived over 10 yrs ago! :)

This dish was very good with the addition of a cup or so of white wine to the sauce.  Rather salty from the ham and cheese.  Hubby made it the first time while I worked, and he followed the recipe exactly except for the wine according to the suggestion of another reviewer.  I decided to make a spin on this the other day and modified the recipe a bit, which honestly to me was a bit better.  Ixnayed the cheese and ham.  Browned the chicken, also browned an onion and a good 5 cloves of garlic before adding to the crockpot.  Mixed the soup with 1 cup of white wine, 1/2 cup of milk, a good shot of dijon mustard, and a few sprigs of fresh thyme.  I cooked this on low for 8 hours while I was out, and it was a delicious, easy meal served with some steamed green beans.  A hit, and such a great base recipe.  I'd like to try this same technique with turkey breast fillets or pork chops.  Maybe even a little fish???

Fantastic. I even had to make my own cream of chicken from scratch because I was going to try this recipe. Added thyme, salt and garlic powder. Waited till the last hour to add the cheese, Italian crumbs and butter. Mouthwatering. Big hit with the kids and hubby.

Excellent ~ Didn't have time to use the SC so I put in a 400 oven for 1 1/2 hours. Took the foil off for 20 mins to crisp up the topping.  The chicken was very moist. I flatten the chicken and then  rolled up with the ham/cheese inside before putting in pan.  Absolutely could serve this to guests.  Think I'll serve with Cranberry sauce next time as well. Nice color arrangement with the green beans and sliced carrots.

This Recipe was fantastic. I put the crockpot on high and it was done in just over 2 hours. It was a great first time crock pot experience. I brined 4 chicken breast and left 2 plain, then pounded them out flat and seasoned them and then rolled them up with the ham and cheese. I followed the recipe from there on. The 4 breast that was brined was extremly great and the other 2 were just not worth bragging about. Definitly will be making this again.

I make this all the time but instead of the butter, I substitute with the same amount of chicken broth.  Not only does it cut down on the fat/calories, but it also makes it very moist!  My family loves this recipe - it's definitely a staple in our house during the winter months!

I made this last night for supper and was delicious. I butterflied the breasts and stuffed them with applewood smoked ham and swiss. I used a toothpick to keep them closed. Also I covered the chicken like the recipe says. Stove Top stuffing for chicken is what I had and tasted great!!

Not my favorite slow cooker recipe.  I love chicken cordon bleu, but the cheese melted too much to enjoy the ooey gooey goodness of a real CCB.  I think I would rather make a recipe that rolls the chicken breast, ham and cheese together and bakes.

My 8-year-old loved this. He asked that I save  the leftovers for his lunchbox the next day. Made without the butter and spritzed with spray olive oil. Worked out just fine.

Hard not to like this recipe, it tasted almost like thanksgiving. Even my 4 year old was enjoying it! I did use sliced provolone instead of swiss, and cooked it for about 5 hrs. Definatly saving this one :)

Ok, we really loved this.  It was delightful with mashed potatoes.  So I set out two pieces of ham, overlapping them slightly, and then put a strip of string cheese down the middle.  I laid the tenderloin in the middle of this, wrapped it up, and secured with a toothpick.  Placed the 'wraps' in the crockpot and poured the gravy stuff on top.  I also added about a teaspoon of garlic salt to the soup/milk for flavor.  Then let her rip.  About an hour before we ate, I sprinkled more swiss cheese on top of everything, layered that with the stove top, and then topped that with more cheese (what can I say, we really like cheese). (For the stuffing: i only have the herb kind, which I don't like as well, so I put in about a teaspoon of boiullon granules, and some more garlic salt, then added the butter)  Like I said, we really loved this.  Definitely a keeper.

First time I made this I was shocked that my two nieces and one nephew loved it.....they are all very picky and it is hard to find something they all enjoy. After eating it we all decided that it was way to salty because of the stuffing. So the next time I made it I used regular bread crumbs and it was fantastic!!!!

Not good.  The chicken and ham dried up together and the cheese melted to nonexistence.  I followed the recipe as is.

The chicken was juicy and falling apart. It was super easy to get in before I left for work and after 4 hours on high my crock pot went to stay warm. Served it with a bit of orzo and it was a delious meal. Only change I will make is maybe cutting the ham in quarters before putting it in the crock pot.

Wow, I actually made a recipe, "as-is"!  It turned out great!  Okay, so I wasn't sure if my chicken would be done in time so I had it on high for 2 hours then low for 2 hours and they chicken was a tad OVER done.  Of course, it depends on the individual crockpot!

Very good and very easy!!  I also substitued chicken broth  for the butter - the recipe needed to come down in calories & fat, not go up.  And I used more, closer to 1/2 c instead of the 1/4 c.  This is the first chicken dish I've made where my 3 year old daughter said 'yummy chicken!'.   A great recipe for a party or potluck dinner.

I made this recipe for my husband and kids, I didn't think it was too bad but my husband didn't like it at all and my kids wouldn't try it at all. It didn't taste that bad but after sitting in the crock pot all day the mixture looked  very unappetizing....not too appealing for small kids.

I wish I would have read the reviews earlier, but definitely don't add the stuffing in until the last hour. I put it in at the beginning and it burnt. Also, I wouldn't put the ham directly on the chicken. I couldnt' tell if the color of the chicken changed from the ham or if it wasn't done. I will try the traditional cordon bleu recipe next time.

This had some possibilities, but needs some major changes. the stuffing was wayyy tooo much! Next time I might try it with out the stuffing, maybe plain bread crumbs, but about 1/2 the amount called for. I couldn't even taste the cheese!

This was extremely easy to make.  Took no time at all to put together in crock pot.  Turned out delicious and made the entire house smell yummy.  Needless to say, my roommate was very jealous.  I added garlic salt/powder to the mix and also after it was done cooking, I used my salad chopper and cut the meal into smaller pieces (easier to dish out).  Very good!

What a wonderful recipe! Absolutely delicious. Based off other reviews, I used two cans of soup and 1.5 cups of milk. I also added some garlic. I butterflied the chicken breasts and put the ham and cheese in them. I added the stuffing mix when there was two hours left. I'll definitely be making this again!

Didn't like this. I doubled the soup but it was still pretty dry.  I saw that the other reviewers thought it might be too salty which didn't mean much to me... but wow.  Yep.  Pretty salty... and the next day?  Saltier.  Nice in theory and with some tweaking could be a good recipe, but didn't care for this at all.

This is not a great recipe. It tastes nothing like chicken cordon bleu. It needs to cook way longer then recipe states. cheese and sauce mix. Stuffing is very soggy on the top. skip this recipe.

It was ok...tasted a bit to much like a box meal. It was good for something different to throw in my crock pot, but I will probably not make again. Also, after 5 hours on low, the chicken was a bit dry.

Used low salt mushroom soup instead as I didn't have cream of chicken, and I think I liked it better that way.  Cheese kind of disappeared, but left a good flavor.  Would make again.

everybody loves this recipe.  The only thing I do differently is roll the cheese in the ham & put inside a pocket cut into the breast & hold together with toothpicks.

Delicious! Mt family loved this.  I only made a couple of small  changes, I used chicken stock instead of milk. (lactose) and I used low fat cream of chicken soup.  Like others I sliced the chicken and folded the ham and cheese inside.

I made this for our Book Club and it was a hit! I made 1 1/2 of the sauce and it was terrific over the rice I made as a side dish. Definitely a keeper!

I should have listened more to other reviewers.  Although this was very tasty it took more than the stated cook time.  I cooked it on high for four hours and that still wasn't long enough so I ended up cutting the breasts and microwaving them.  Next time I will pound the chicken or allow more time for cooking.

AFter 6 1/2 hours in the crock pot on low Chicken still appeared somewhat pink. So we popped it in the microwave for 5 minutes,still pink. Next we put it in the oven for 1/2 hour, finally it seemed ok to eat. It was tasty but did not taste a thing like Chicken Cordon Bleu. The sauce had mixed with the cheese and the stuffing and was not bad but it was not what we had expected. I'd try this recipe again, but next time I'd bake it and do the stuffing on the side.

This was easy to make. Cubed the chicken, stirred with the soup and milk in the slow cooker. After 3 hrs on low I covered the chicken mixture with a layer of diced baked ham. An hour later I stirred it, layered the cheese over the mixture and topped with the stuffing mix and melted butter. Let it go for another hour. The result was pretty tasty. I would not recommend adding any salt as with these ingredients it didn't seem to need it. The stuffing was not mushy so waiting to add it seemed to work out. A green veggie went nicely on the side. This was good but for me I probably won't make it again.

This is a great recipe. I followed the advice of other reviews by adding some extra flavor, so I added lots of garlic, onion, and a half cup of white cooking wine. I also added some chicken broth, because I thought it might dry out, but it was not necessary. I added low-sodium chicken stuffing on top with 2 hours to go, but next time I will wait the last 30 minutes since they got mushy. I also butterflied the chicken, and stuffed the cheese and ham inside which turned out nice. I think I may try prosciutto and provolone next time. The chicken was nice and tender.

My family loved this! I love how the cheese melted and became part of the thick, rich sauce. We just spooned it over each portion as it was served. It was delicious! Definitely will make this again next time we have guests for dinner--if I can wait that long...

This was a great meal. I followed others' suggestions and layered the ham and swiss on the breast and rolled it and secured it with toothpicks. The cheese did melt out, but it only added to the yummy taste. I also held off on adding the stuffing and extra cheese until the last hour. Overall, it was a great tasting meal and easy recipe!

This was just ok, it kind of ended up looking like slop but still had a good flavor. I used the Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup and Stove Top Stuffing. Like some people suggested I cooked the chicken in the soup and layered the ham. Then for the last hour I added the cheese and the stuffing. I liked how the chicken was cooked in the soup and when you add the stuffing it soaks up the soup and gives it a great flavor. I like to use the crockpot because I work 8-10hr days and do not want to cook when I get home, unfortunately this meal cooks quick and isn't really for "slowcooking". You can make a better Chicken Cordon Bleu on the stove or in the oven and just serve it with a side of stuffing so I don't think I will make this again. If I were to make it again I would omit the cheese and cut the ham into bite size pieces.

YUUUUMMMM!!!!!  Sooo good for a busy college student!  I didn't feel like having to wash the slow cooker, so I put it in the oven for an hour at 400 (only made 2 breasts).  Definitely will make again, but next time, I think I'll make two layers of cheese - one between chicken and the ham and one between the ham and the stuffing.

This was picky husband approved so you know it is good! Will put in my regular rotation as the flavor is good but I still feel like it is missing something..may add some dijon mustard next time to give it an extra kick. Overall a great dump and go recipe. Also love that it is inexpensive to make.

This recipe turned out great. Fast prep, easy ingredients and quick clean up if you use a slow cooker liner. I took the recommendation from the other reviewers and butterfly cut the chicken to stuff the ham and cheese inside. I doubled the recipe and cooked it on high 4 hours. I sprinkled the chicken with some garlic and onion powder for extra flavor. Delicious smell throughout the whole house and the chicken was so soft and tender it fell apart when I went to serve it. Added a garden salad and served it on top of egg noodles. Yum.

Loved this one. I think the reviewers who complained about the stuffing not being good probably stirred. No stirring! Just leave it. My stuffing came out slightly toasty on the top because I left it alone. I also stuffed the breasts vs layering the ingredients. Amazingly fast prep for such a stick-to-your ribs recipe. Give this one a try!

I loved this recipe.  It is not your elegant chicken cordon bleu a much easier, less extravagant version, but great to toss together in the crockpot and come back to a complete meal.  I followed the recipe to a T with a few minor exceptions.  I used a thicken cut ham lunchmeat and cut it into 1" squares.  I loved the sauce, but next time I am going to use 2 cans of cream of chicken and 2 cup milk for the sauce.  YUMMY!

really really good, i butterflied 3 large chicken breasts and stuffed them with one slice of ham each and mozzarella and cheddar cheese (hate swiss) and then covered in the soup/milk mix on top and bottom, added half of the stuffing and topped with a little melted butter, i added the other half of the stuffing a half hour before it was done, i only cooked on high for 3 hours and everything was wonderful don't know why people gave such bad reviews

I really liked this recipe.  The chicken was a little dry though, but adding extra milk or maybe waiting to add the stuffing for later could help.  It seemed like a lot of stuffing, but I like stuffing, so I didn't mind that too much.  So easy and delicious though.  I'll definitely make it again.

I added the quintessential crock pot seasoning -- a packet of onion soup mix -- and it added that extra little kick of flavor that the original recipe could be lacking.

Easy to prepare in the AM before work.  Used frozen chicken and let it cook most of the day.  Because I have a smaller slow cooker  I was only able to use 4 chicken breasts.  Also found that there was too much liquid maybe,  as the stuffing was kinda mushy as it had absorbed a lot of the liquid.  Really enjoy the taste and the simplicity!  We will be making this again.

This recipe wasn't as bad as some make it out to be.  The only thing is the recipe doesn't say what to do with the butter.  I poured it on top and it was fine.  Some are right though, it doesn't look appealing, and the chicken still looks pink (it's cooked though)...

I have made this recipe several times for different groups of people and everytime it is a hit!  The best part is how quick and easy it is to get the ingredients together. I was suprised at how much flavor it has considering there is no seasoning required.

Pretty good.... Although I prefer Behr's chicken cordon bleu (also on this site), this offered a nice change of pace. For a quick, no-fuss weeknight meal, this is perfectly acceptable in my book. :) I am a firm believer that tough cuts of meat are best suited for slow cooking, but with a little common sense, you can also cook leaner cuts with great results. The key is to cook on HIGH for a short amount of time. I've never had good luck with any chicken entree that I cooked on low for a prolonged period of time, but that's just me. To suit my needs, I halved this (just serving my hubs and I) and cooked on HIGH for 2.5 hours. My stuffing was not dry in the least (the steam that condenses on your slow cooker lid will help keep it moist!). My husband commented that this was good, and that's a HUGE compliment in our house (he is VERY picky lol!). Mashed potatoes, peas and fruit cocktail rounded out our mid-week meal. Thanks for sharing 001519! :-)

My family really liked this. I used organic chicken tenders, covered with soup and sprinkled half of stuffing mix on top (no butter). Cooked on medium (3) for about 3 hours then add a layer of ham, then swiss and topped with remaining stuffing and sprinkled with 2T butter - stuffing came out great.

My family loved this recipe. the only problem I had was the stuffing was dry on top., next time I will prepare the stove top following directions and add it either the last 1/2 hour of cooking or just serve on the side. will make again.

Yummy, although a tad too salty. I followed the recipe exactly and it was good enough that I will definitely make it again.

Good but not great!  Very watery & salty!  I would make some adjustments next time. Would not use milk in soup, would use low salt soup and ham. I used provolone cheese which I would do again or maybe pepperjack to give it a little kick!  I would not cook the stuffing on stove first-used margarine in stuffing and then repice told you to put margarine on top of the stuffing.  I think it would taste better with these changes and I would make it again!

I had this same recipe a few years ago as a casserole that is cooked in the oven. I love to use my slow cooker, so I'm happy that it can be done this way as well. It is a nice recipe...nothing exceptional, though.

This was perfect comfort food on a cold winter's night.  I made a few changes.  I used 12 thin sliced breasts.  I rolled half a slice of ham and half a slice of swiss into each one and secured with toothpicks.  Next time I will use full slices.  I doubled the sauce and added 2 cloves of garlic and a good bit of pepper (1/2 tsp, I'd say).  Finally, instead of stuffing I used scalloped potatoes.  Amazing!  I am sure it'd be very good with the stuffing, too.  This really hit the spot!  Thanks for the recipe... it is definitely a keeper!

I made according to directions, only adding an extra can of cream of chicken soup because I forgot to split the first can. I didn't think this tasted like chicken cordon bleu at all, but it was an ok chicken dish. It was the first time I had made chicken using my slower cooker. Husband gave it a nine (1 to 10 scale) and my teen daughter gave it an 8. I'd give it a five. I think I will try individually coating each piece of chicken next time.

I followed the recipe exactly. The Swiss cheese melted completely into the stuffing and boy, was it good!  The chicken was quite bland though, it definitely needs something. Next time I may just omit the ham and cube or shred the chicken so you always get a bite with your stuffing :)

I made 1 change, added mushrooms to the soup mixture. When I was little, I remember detesting stuffing, but since I also didn't like ranch then and I do now, I figured I'd give the stuffing a try again. I shouldn't have. I should have gone with one reviewers idea of adding the cheesy potatoes on top. The stuffing over powered every other taste. I couldn't taste the swiss cheese or the ham. The chicken itself was fine, and really moist, but the stuffing....

I have never written a review, but had to after making this. This was great!!!  After reading some of the previous reviews, I did make some changes.  First, I used 98% Fat Free Cream of Chicken Soup. Second, I threw in a little white wine.  Since I had forgotten to thaw the chicken, I just threw it in frozen.  Finally, I waited until the last 45 minutes to add the dressing.  The chicken breast turned out sooo moist and tender you didn't even need a knife to cut it! My family loved it!!

This was a nice simple recipe.  It's so nice coming home to a nice hot meal on a busy night.  I added a couple sliced potatoes to the very bottom layer which was a nice addition.

This was a really dry recipe. If I were to make this again, I'd probably increase it to 2 cans of soup, extra cheese, and would probably toss the stuffing with chicken broth before putting it in the crock pot as it was also very dry. Dry stuffing is never yummy. I would also suggest cutting up the ham slices. The full slices made it very hard for everyone to get some ham in their serving.

I REALLY liked this recipe & so did my picky toddler! I did slash the calories though by using deli thin ham, reduced fat swiss cheese & reduced fat cream soup. I'm personally on WW & got it down to 5 points for those of you that are on it too. Don't forget to add your seasoning - garlic powder worked very well! Thanks for such a great idea for the slowcooker - I appreciate it!!

This recipe was filling and great 
for the crockpot. I also waited until the
last two hours to add the cheese and 
stuffing. I added pepper to the soup/milk

I was excited about this recipe. We all agree. We'll keep looking. The chicken was dry and the cheese disappeared. Many of the problems the other complained about. But I used cornbread stuffing (that is all I could find) The cream of chicken soup and stuffing were the best parts.

Well, the sauce was a little too thin for my taste and I was definitely not a fan of the soggy stuffing...
I think in the future I'll use the recipe I have tried before - same concept, but only 1/4 cup milk, no stuffing, and served over rice.  Wasn't bad to try once, but nothing to write home about!

Last minute decision to make this and was in a hurry so cooked 3 hrs on high.  I didn't even have time to read the reviews and followed the original recipe except for the ham.  I was out so used deli pastrami.  It turned out okay - I think ham would have been better.  Mine needed a little salt for seasoning... ham might have made the difference.  I will make this again - quick good dinner!!!

Based on other reviews I made quite a few changes....and I'm glad I did.  This was a huge hit at our house.  First I halved the recipe.  Butterflied chicken and put one slice cheese and one ham in each.  Then two of each layered on top.  Used cr. of mushroom soup and added garlic powder, poultry seasoning, thyme, pepper, oregano, dried parsley and white wine, used 1/2&1/2 instead of milk.  Added stuffing last hour of cooking and skipped butter, used chicken broth instead.

Great recipe! I made it as written with one change, all i had on hand was boneless skinless thighs, and we were all going back for seconds. I will make this again. Thank you for sharing.

I would have loved this with the stuffing but DH doesn't like it so used idea from another reviewer and used box scalloped potatoes, including the sauce packet (and nixed the butter).  I was planning on serving broccoli with it so decided to just throw it in. I also browned the chicken first and then cooked it in the oven at 450 for about 30 minutes. I know lots of changes but the original recipe would've been great - the ingredient mix is what makes it and its easy to modify.  Thanks for sharing!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added the cheese and stuffing mix a bit later (about an hour before it was to be finished), otherwise I changed nothing. Both hubby and I thought it was definitely worth making again. I found it flavorful without being overwhelming, the biggest flavors being the ham and the stuffing, of course. Very yummy!

Very easy and good. I did however add extra cheese in it and I "stuff" it instead of placing it on top..But it is great either way!

The cheese didn't stay very well in the chicken. If I were to make this again I think I would cut the chicken into chunks, cube the ham and  use shredded swiss cheese. Then cook them all together in the Crockpot. I would also omit the stuffing.

This was easily one of the best things I've ever made in a slow cooker! I made one slight twist and used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and then put raw mushrooms in the cooker as well. It was absolutely amazing!!! my fiance is anxious for me to cook this again!

Made as the recipe called except I took others suggestions and waited till the last hour to add the stuffing. My stuffing got a little mushy in some spots, but I transferred the stuffing to a separate bowl and then mixed all of the stuffing together it was fine. I have some kids who don't like stuffing, which is why I transferred to a separate bowl. Overall it was good. The chicken was super tender without falling apart!! Everyone definitely liked the chicken. A lot of the cheese came off on the stuffing. I may just skip the stuffing all together next time, but WILL probably make again since everyone ate it and enjoyed it. Very simple and easy for a busy weekend or weeknight supper.

My husband and son LOVED this!  I've tried another recipe for Chicken Cordon Bleu and this recipe not only tasted better, but was super easy to make (no need to pound the chicken thin).  I followed some of the other reviews and stuffed the chicken with the ham and swiss and used 2 TB of butter rather than 1/4 cup.

Excellent!!! I put the ham & cheese in the middle of the chicken breast and added garlic & green onions to the soup for a little added flavor.  I would also recommend waiting til the last 30 minutes to put the stuffing on, it gets a bit mushy if you add it earliler.

To us, this recipe tastes nothing like chicken cordon bleu, but it is such a delicious concoction that I had to give it 5 stars!  We followed the recipe exactly and loved it.  My fiance said that this was the best thing to come out of a crockpot!  He can't wait to make it again!

Easy five-star recipe! I butterflied and then pounded flat four chicken breasts, which I seasoned with ground black pepper and sage. I layered thick slices of Swiss cheese (from a brick of it) and several slices of thin shaved brown sugar deli ham over the center of each breast and folded closed. In light of all the reviewers who complained about the meal being dry, I added an extra half soup can of milk and 1/4 cup of white wine to the sauce, which I briefly simmered on the stove with some random seasonings and chopped fresh garlic (2 cloves, may add more next time). Yes, the majority of the stuffing got mushy from the sauce, but I knew that going in and didn't care--I don't mind that. I initially set my crockpot on low for six hours, but after about four and a half, parts of the stuffing topping were starting to burn a bit. I ended up serving this after exactly five hours. Well, I have to say, the chicken was perfectly moist and delicious. Not a bit dry. Most of the Swiss cheese stayed where it belonged; the small amount that escaped into the sauce/stuffing only enhanced the dish in my opinion. The flavor was out of this world, and not at all too salty. The stuffing did stick to the sides of my crockpot and I will probably use a liner next time.

I wish I could do a 1/2 star with this. It was a decent recipe but the stuffing -- half of it was so soggy that it was inedible and the other half was still rock hard....so I made another package of stuffing on the stove. The taste of the rest was pretty good. Imay use this agin but just skip the stuffing part of it. Thanks anyway....

This turned out WONDERFUL.  I took a risk and made it for us and some company and took the advice of others and rolled the chicken, cheese, and ham together before placing it in the slow cooker.   I also added seasonings to the soup mixture (garlic, onion, a little thyme) so it wouldn't be bland.  I used black forest ham lunchmeat which I thought tasted really good in it and wasn't too salty.  I waited until the last hour of cooking time to put in the stuffing.  I can't find anything to complain about- there were NO leftovers.  Absolutely delicious.

We had this for dinner tonight and it was a hit with my husband and five children.  I put all ingredients in at once per the directions and cooked on low for exactly six hours.  I used boneless skinless breast tenders and just dumped them in frozen.  I also used shredded swiss cheese.  It was flavorful and was not at all dry.  The stuffing turned out perfectly.  I was skeptical as my husband dislikes stove top stuffing but he raved.  Definitely a keeper!

This is the first time I have written a review. I followed the recipe exactly and although it was good I could not get over how salty it was. I like seasoning but this was way to salty. I really suggest using unseasoned stuffing(I used stove top and I think that just took the salt factor over the top). My husband liked it but he too said it was very salty and this coming from a man who salts EVERYTHING.

The whole family enjoyed this dish.  I thought the recipe was great as is.  I did end up using unseasoned croutons (bought by mistake) and the salt content was fine.  Thanks for a tasty and easy recipe!

I have also made this in the oven - you have to moisten the stuffing mix before baking but it still turns out tasty.  All the kids and in-laws love this recipe.

I was pretty disappointed with this recipe. Cooking it on low for 6 hours was way too long and the chicken was extremely dry. There was also way too much stuffing for my taste...

Hi I tried something similar to this for a potluck at our church group get together.  I didn't use stuffing instead I added cooked noodles and topped it with plain bread crumbs.  I got lots of requests for the recipe, in fact I am making it tomorrow for a potluck.  To make it really easy I used already breaded chicken patties all breast meat and cut them into pieces and I used cubed ham.  It was wonderful!!!

This would be good with modifications. Stuffing came out dry even with extra butter and as others said the cheese just disappears even if you add it later. I think this would be better in the oven like Campbells chicken and stuffing bake. Good flavor though.

I'm not much of a complainer...but, I didn't like this recipe at all. It smelled bad after I added the stuffing. I hoped it would still taste ok, but no such luck. My family tried to be nice...but they didn't like it at all. If my hubby doesn't eat seconds...something is definitely wrong!!!

This was great. I was thrilled with houw it turned out. My added half of the stuffing in the beginning and the rest about an hour before serving. I also added some garlic. Fabulous. I have committed this recipe to memory.

I'm sorry but we did not like this recipe at all. The stuffing became dry and hard and the chicken was too dry as well. I will stick to my traditional chicken cordon bleu from now on. Sorry.

What a deceptively easy recipe! And my husband loved it! The chicken is so moist and tender. I might have added more cheese because it melts off and gets lost in the soup but otherwise it was delicious. I didn't have "stuffing" but I had a jar of bread crumbs so I covered the top with the crumbs. Very good alternative.

This was great for a rainy afternoon.  I did double the stuffing, though as we like extra.  I also put a final layer of swiss cheese on the top during the last 10 minutes of cooking.  Extra cheese is always good.

Always comes out perfect!  The recipe is perfect as is, but sometimes I use a mixture of Swiss and Muenster cheeses, or add a little gruyere.  Don't use lunch meat ham or Spam, it doesn't turn out well; better to use no ham than either of those.

This recipe is fantastic!  I just made a few adjustments.  I used 1/2 of heavy whipping cream to the 1/2 cup of milk.  I also used unseasoned bread crumbs instead of seasoned crumbs.  I added my own seasonings to the bread crumbs to suit my family's taste.  I will certainly be making this again.

I'm a little lazy. I through all the ingredients in a bag and froze it. Later in the month I just defrost and placed in my crockpot. I was not able to layer it, but it still came out tasting superb.

I think it needed more sauce & less (or no) stuffing. I  will also probably add some of the seasonings that I use when I make the non-slow-cooker version as it was a little boring flavor-wise.

This recipe tasted really good but I gave it only 4 stars because I needed to make a lot of adjustments to get it right.  I diced the cheese and ham so that it wasn't a thick layer.  I pre-cooked the chicken on the stove, layered everything in a 9x13 and baked it in the oven with 2 boxes of stuffing on top.  It tasted delish!

I took it a step further and butterflied the breasts to fold the ham and cheese inside. Otherwise, I followed it to a tee, and it was a smashing hit.

I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt when I put it in the slow cooker. I also waited until the last hour of cooking to add the cheese and the stuffing and butter. I'm glad I did, even with only cooking it for one more hour the stuffing was getting dried out on the edges. It turned out to be good with these changes.

I have made a lot of recipes from this site, but this one will be removed from my recipe box.  The chicken was dry, the cheese disappeared and the stuffing was mush. It really had no flavor.  It sounded good in theory, but I did not like it.

I didn't cut the soup in 1/2 when I made this even though I cut everything else in half so it came out kind of soupy.  Plan to do it right next time!  Just have a hard time remembering I have 1/2 can of soup left over and use it up. Any suggestions?

Made this for dinner last evening and it was a huge success for my hubby and me.  One issue for us was that the stuffing mix was very salty and we don't use much salt so the next time I am going to make my own stuffing topping and try it that way.  Didn't have the swiss cheese so I used 1/4 c of blue cheese crumbles (which may have added additional salt) so I will use swiss the next time as well.  This was a great recipe for the crock pot and, as you see, will make it again.

Yummy! My picky 3 year old LOVED it. I butterflied the chicken and stuffed the cheese and ham inside as others have suggested. It was also great because I had all the ingredients in the house - always a bonus!

Really good! But use lower sodium soup. The saltiness of the ham and the soup is too much. But otherwise great! I will make this again. I passed the recipe out to all of my friends! Thanks

Ok, so I totally forgot to get the crock pot ready the night before and didn't have time in the morning, so I improvised.  I used a brick of swiss cheese cubed instead of slices.  I threw all of the ingredients in a 9 x 13 pan and baked it for about 40 min at 350.  Next time I think I would use a slightly smaller pan but otherwise it turned out great!

I don't know what went wrong with this recipe, but I cannot say this recipe resembled anything close to Chicken Cordon Bleu. I questioned, how it could go wrong with such great ingredients...it did! I will never make this dish again. I will look for another CCB. I guess that is what I get for expecting the quality of this meal from a slowcooker- ick

This was delicious! I used a 5 oz box of whole wheat Stove Top stuffing and only 3 chicken breasts. I topped each chicken breast with only 1 slice of cheese, which I would maybe increase next time. Otherwise, no other changes necessary. It is pretty salty, maybe a low sodium soup would work better.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars.  I cut the chicken into cubes, and may have used a little more swiss than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Cooked on low for 7 hours...it was delicious!  Much better than I had hoped for based on the other reviews.

My family loved this, will definitly make it again, since both my husband and son are finicky eaters. After reading the other reviews, I butterflied the chicken and put rolled low-sodium ham and swiss in the middle. I also used low-fat and low-sodium cream of chicken soup to help keep the sodium down. I also flavored the soup/milk blend with minced garlic, thyme and white wine. In addition, I waited to put the stuffing mix on top until there was 2 hours left to cook it (on low heat). Moist chicken with flavor, will make again!

Can I give it 6 stars? Was a life savor. Had out of town family in. We shopped in the snow and came to my house for dinner party. Walked in with guest to spiced cider. Then sat down to dinner in less than 5 minutes with twiced baked sweet potatoes (fixed eariler then warmed) I did add sour cream and garlic. Everyone wanted the recipe!

Kids really liked. I opted to make this recipe with the stuffing on the side and poured the sauce over it since many complained of dryness.  I cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours and this was fine.  I added minced garlic to the soup mix. This sauce would be nice over rice or noodles which is how I will make next time. And yes, I would still skip adding in the stuffing.

Good, easy recipe.  I added about a cup of sour cream and a tablespoon of minced garlic to the soup and milk for a tangier sauce.  Turned out great.  I added the stuffing within the last hour of cooking.  Still came out mushier than I would have liked.  Next time I may just do the stuffing separately.  Will make again though, got great reviews from the family.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I made it thinking I was getting chicken cordon bleu, but this wasn't anything like that!  The people I shared this with did like it.  I expected one thing and got another.

love this recipe, made as is with minimal changes, used low fat cream of chicken, diced the ham instead of using slices, easier to eat that way, used chicken tenders instead of breast. also prepared the stuffing according to the package before putting it on top. DH and i both loved this dish, didn't think it was salty at all, next time i'll try just using the stuffing with out preparing it. also i think it depends on the type of stuffing your using and also maybe the low sodium soup would be better if you think it to salty.

wonderful yummmmmmmy crock pot meal.

I'm not sure if it was the ham I used or what but this turned out REALLY salty.  I could hardly eat it.  I think if I make it again, I'll use deli ham instead of leftover baked ham.  I have a feeling that may have been what gave it the added saltiness.  Overall though, it could've had a good flavor.

My husband really liked this recipe - the kids seemed to like it too. I thought it tasted good, but I really didn't care for the consistency or look of it. I did add the cheese and stuffing at the end as mentioned by others, but it still was pretty mushy. Not bad tasting, just...well...mushy.

Came out dry, and was hard to serve.  Using the whole package of stuffing mix may have made it too salty.  Has potential, but I'll change it up next time.

Taste was ok. Not very eye appealing. I followed previous suggestions of using half the box of stuffing mix at the beginning, then the rest 1 hour prior with melted butter and it still came out soggy.

I thought the recipe was good and easy.  I cooked it on med-high in my slow cooker for about 2 1/2 hours and then med-low for about 1 hour.  I unplugged my slow cooker just before the 4 hours.  My chicken was not too dry.
I would probably not make it too often.

What could be better than spending little time in the kitchen and getting a great dish!? This recipe is splendid. The chicken came out very nice and moist. The stuffing was beautiful as well. I didn't have any problems that others are complaining of.

This recipe was so easy to put together, and I got italian flavored bread stuffing and it just added that special flare to it.  My 5 year old son just loved it up too.

this is great. I made a couple of changes though -- I used 2 cans of soup instead of 1 and i brushed each chicken breast with dijon mustard. I also increased the milk to 1 1/2 cups since I increased the soup - it was great!

Tried this and must say it was an instant hit. My grandfather is a very picky eater and he made comments about how good it smelled. He went back for seconds. Great recipe!!!!

My family loved this! I gave it 4 stars, cause you really have to knock my socks off to get a 5. I am a busy mom, so this was the ultimate in lazy man's version of this recipe and I doctored it ALOT. I just dont have the energy to spend time cutting the ham or rolling the chicken, so here goes. I used 1 cup of chicken broth with the can of chicken soup, than added a lot of fresh ground garlic, a bunch af dried parsley, italian seasoning & fresh ground pepper, and stone ground mustard - the jar kind, not the herb. All of it was to taste till I liked the flavor. I cut the chicked breast in half to thin them, I used lunchmeat ham and sliced swiss. Then I just layered it into the crockpot like it was lasagna: sauce, chicken, ham, cheese, sauce, chicken, ham, cheese, sauce. i didnt have stove top so I used a bunch of croutons on top which was nice because it didnt get mushy like other people mentioned. Then I added more chicken broth on top of the croutons instead of butter and viola! Hubby loves it, kids loved it, their friends loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

It was very rich. I had to put the stuffing on top in the morning before I left for work. It still turned out o.k. I don't think I'd make it again.

I made this two nights ago. I've used cubed herbed stuffing mix then the regular version. It came out all right. I didn't add any side dishes and ate it as is. I have no alternative suggestions to it, since it was delicious and yummy. I would make it again.

The flavor and texture was perfect! I made a lil adjustments. I mixed low sodium cream of chicken,  garlic powder and milk, cut a hole in chicken, rolled the Swiss  with the ham ‚Äúwashed and pat ham dry‚Äù to fit inside. Poured half soup, placed chicken with ham n Swiss up to prevent coming out. Poured other half of soup on top, cooked low 4 hrs, poured stuffing on top and drizzled butter over it. Last hour of cook time pull away from the sides to prevent burning and fluff it. 5 hrs chicken not dry.  Excellent!

This is a good and easy prep casserole, but I wouldn't consider it chicken cordon bleu. I liked it, but will be making the traditional chicken cordon bleu next time I am craving it.

Next time I will put cheese on top of ham so ham sticks to chicken.  Also I will use chicken tenders instead, but it was good.

I wrapped the chicken in ham and cooked that in the sauce in the crock pot.  Then I put it in a baking dish, added the cheese on top and then a liberal sprinkling of stuffing and baked it long enough to melt the cheese and brown the stuffing.  It was good, but not as good as making it the old fashioned way.  However, if you're having a lazy day and don't want all the work of the old fashioned way, then this is your recipe.

This was fine but a little bit one-note.  If I make it again, I would definitely add some veggies. A bag of frozen broccoli or peas would have made a big difference.

When I think slow cooker meal, I think easy meal. Made as written, this is just a 1-star dish. You need the gooey stuffing to act as a sauce because the chicken is otherwise bland and the cheese disappears. So if I need to doctor it up by pounding the chicken to then roll the ham and cheese inside, it has ceased to be a quick easy slow cooker meal and you're basically making regular chicken cordon blue.

I made this twice now. This was so simple and delicious. when the cheese melts in the soup  it makes a mouth watering delight. I used Dietz and Watson ham and baby Swiss cheese. I did put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end of cooking to make the stuffing have a bit of a crunch.

This is so delicious !!! 
My oval crock pot only held 3 large breast so I did a second layer like a lasagna. I layered cream of chicken mixed with milk first on the bottom. 3 breasts, ham, mozzarella cheese, dry stuffing mix,  and a little more cream of chicken. Then I repeated the layers making a total of 6 breasts. Of course doing it this way I needed a second can of cream of chicken mix. This was so quick and easy for a busy day. Goes better with mashed potatoes than rice. WILL make again

I made according to directions, I did follow one reviewers advice and butterflied the chicken and put ham and swiss inside. It was ok, I won't make again, as my family wasn't thrilled with it.  For a slow cooker version of chicken cordon bleu, it was alright. Chicken fell apart with touch of a fork, but I'll stick to the baked version.

Very good!!! As a stay at home wife expecting our first child in a few weeks, I am always looking or quick and easy meals. Hubby is extremely picky and even he liked this one. I did make a couple changes though-instead of the stuffing mix, I used italian bread crumbs (toasted on the stove and added towards the end) and I also added some shredded parm/romano cheese along with the swiss.  Next time I will add even more cheese because it seemed to be non-existant by the end of the cooking process.

I loved this dish! I did make a few modifications to it though. I butterflied two chicken breasts and pounded it to make it thinner. I seasoned it with onion powder, black pepper, and garlic salt. I then placed the ham and two slices of swiss  on one side of the chicken before folding together and placing into the crock pot. I bought Chicken Stuffing and waited an hour before putting it in the crockpot. I did not put the full amount of stuffing in. The stuffing did not create a crust but blended really nicely with the meal as a whole.

I followed the recipe fairly closely for the most part.  Based on other reviews, I did opt to butterfly the chicken breasts then roll the ham & cheese in the breasts.  Added some tarragon to the soup/milk mixture.  Sprinkled the inside of the chicken breast with poultry seasoning before rolling.  Placed the breast rolls in slow cooker with about half the  soup mixture.   Cooked on high for an hour.  Added the stuffing, melted butter and rest of the soup mixture after the first hour.  Cooked for about another 90 minutes on high setting.
Family's overall reaction was "meh".  It was OK but just didn't impress.  I might try it one more time but bake it in the oven instead.  As a slow cooker meal this was a miss.

AWESOME!  I used low sodium deli ham cut into small 1" pieces, I cubed the chicken, low sodium cream of chicken soup and added minced garlic and black pepper.  I stirred occasionally throughout the cooking to mix it all together.  I also used 1 pkg of stuffing at the beginning and added 1/2 package during, I also added a little water.  At the end I put a glass of water in the crock pot, put on the cover and turned it on high which made for easy cleaning.

Very yummy!  I set it on low for six hours before I left for work and let it sit on warm until dinner time (total time about eleven hours).  Sitting so long on warm made the chicken kind of dry.  Next time I will wait until I get home then cook on high for two hours so that it's ready at dinner time.  Even dry, though, this had lots of good flavor!

I found this recipe 'as is' to not have enough flavour, so I replaced the cream of chicken soup with cream of mushroom soup and it made all the difference in my opinion. Delicious!

Made this tonight and it went over well. Used only 4 chix breasts since it was for two with planned overs. I didn't have any stuffing in the pantry so I subbed uncooked quinoa for stuffing. Used about a half a cup and sprayed water on top to make sure it would cook. Hubby, who doesn't like quinoa liked the dish. I will fix again for sure.

I thought this turned out very well. I was concerned that the chicken would get overcooked and fall apart, but I used two very large chicken breasts and cooked on low for 6 hours and it turned out perfectly. I thought it was strange to add the Swiss cheese at the very beginning, rather than at the end of the cooking time, but the cheese melts and combines with the soup giving the sauce a cheesy Swiss flavor that I thought was pretty distinctive. I would recommend this. It was so easy, and very good tasting. I will be making it again.

This "Bleu" my taste buds away!!! So good and I loved that it was easy to make. I made it on a night that had a bit of chill in the air, so it was the perfect comfort food - warmed the belly and make the mouth happy!!! This is going in the dinner rotation for sure.

I made this for my girls last weekend. It was a hit. Easy to make, too. i have a "hot" slow cooker. At the eight-hour setting, five breasts took 1.5 hours to cook. I'll make this again.

I made this for my husbands Birthday dinner and he loved it. All of the people that we had over to eat with us wanted the recipe and I would make this any time. I used provolone cheese instead of the swiss cheese and it still turned out really good.

This is a great recipe. I butterflied, stuffed and thentoothpicked in place the breast like others had suggested.  I used 2cans of the soup and added emeril's original essence and basil.  I also did not add the stuffing until the last hour  as suggested by others.  The sauce/gravy as awesome.  I found the toothpicks to be cumbersome and wish I could find something edible as absolution to hold breasts together.  Overall a keeper!  Thanks.

My family loved it!  Very yummy!!  I think I'll wrap the ham slices around the chicken next time.  I think my husband ended up with about 3 of them!  Or, I'll just stuff the chicken like others did.  The flavor was so good!  and very easy to make... always a plus!  Will be making again!

This is the first thing I've cooked that in 22 years my husband has ever gotten enthusiatic enough to want to bump up a few things.  The first time I had it too soupy so I halved the milk with heavy cream and it was perfect.  We hammered the chicken, layered it, cheese (which we used provolone and I finished out the bit of swiss I had, layer of shaved ham, another good layer of soup sauce as the chicken breasts actually thinned enough to make two.  So we had that second layer of meat and cheese topped by the breading.  I cooked on hi for  5 hrs.  It was moist, savory, and everyone loved it.   It goes WAY further, I would suggest this amount for at least six.  I sliced and served it onto a platter and all of the layers held together so it was quite attractive as well.  This was done in my large oval crock (not sure size).  I would not suggest doing it in anything smaller.  The width and shape of the oval crock made it easy to slice and remove.   It has to be cooled before slicing if you want a good hold of the layers for looks and then warn, This is the best recipe we've used and it as our guidance we just did tweaks for his taste.  While there may be lots of way to tweak to your taste, without this recipe would be absolutely nothing to start from.  We cannot thank you enough for providing it.

I cooked this just as the recipe instructed. First of all, spray your dish with cooking spray or use a liner on this one.  The stuffing really sticks to the sides. I cubed my chicken and my ham.  I cooked it on high for 2-1/2 hours due to time.  It was fully cooked and hot.  I should have read the reviews about adding the cheese and stuffing about an hour before serving (30 minutes on high).  The stuffing was mushy.  It would have been better if it was crunchy.  I also think that it was too much stuffing for me.  My box was only 6 oz. I suggest using less. I think I will try breadcrumbs next time, but you can use crackers, crutons, etc. I will also use more cheese (we love lots of melted cheese). Overall it was very good and I will definetely cook it again!

I have made these several times.. Instead of using mushroom soup, I use the Cream of Cheddar soup or make a cheese sauce... I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces.  Bring it to work in the morning, plug it in & ready for lunch!!

I probably shouldn't fairly rate this dish because I changed a couple of major things about it. Instead of stuffing mix I had boxed scalloped potatoes on hand so I used them on top. This was delicious but the entire dish did not stay together well. Splitting open the chicken and stuffing the ham and cheese inside would have been much better. I also used real off the bone ham, not deli meat which gave it a better taste. I will perhaps try this recipe again but I will follow the recipe exactly and see if it makes a difference.

This works very well if you do it for 8 hours or more. I have now tried it twice on high for 3 and 4 hours, and the stuffing is not done. I recommend this recipe on the low setting, and it is very yummy for the whole daily. I do not recommend this recipe on the high setting, as the stuffing does not finish cooking in time.

This was really pretty good. The stuffing did soak up all the chicken soup so it seemed a little dry. The chicken was so tender and the other flavors were great. I will definately make again.

OMG - this is the bomb.  I've had to double the recipe - then had to get a bigger slow cooker to double it again.  My family loves this and asks for it at least once each month.

I wasn't a big fan of this.  It tasted like a plain chicken and stuffing bake.  If I try this again, I'd make a few changes.  The slices of ham didn't work well, I'd do large cubes instead.  I thought it was too much stuffing, so I'd maybe try half a box.  I also would pound the chicken a bit or cut into chunks.  I made this on high and the chicken was still raw after 2.5 hours.  Try the recipe on the back of the stove top stuffing box (chicken, cream of chicken soup, veggies) and add ham if you want something similar to this recipe.

I made this with rice instead of the stuffing because of all of the reviews about how it was too salty with the stuffing and we thought it was great, definitely not to salty, will try with stuffing next time

Lacking in full flavor; I never cook with salt but this needed a bit.  Overall good and very easy, just may need a little TLC from the cook

Very nice. Made it this weekend and the family loved it.  I think the chicken was a little dry, breast meat cooks faster. Overall, very nice and easy to prepare.

What a great find!!  My family cleaned the crock pot and their plates.  Even my major picky 5 year old had seconds.  I made no adjustments and WILL make this again!  THANKS!

Awesome recipe! The only addition to this recipe was that I prepared an extra can of the cream of chicken mixed with the milk to add on top of each plate prior to serving. I think without the extra sauce it may have been too dry.

Yummy.  Don't over cook or the chicken will get dry.  This is a great easy, fix and forget meal.

I liked this recipe.  I made it before work in like 15 mins for dinner mjy family and my company loved it.  All I had to do was sccop it and top it with some shredded cheese.  It was so tender and flavorful.  I also added garlic.  Awesome quick fix but the chicken should be thawed before you make it.

The whole family liked this recipe.  I altered it a bit to have one layer of chicken, then ham & swiss, then a second layer of chicken.  I think that helped keep all of the cheese from disapearing into the sauce.  I did not have a problem with the stuffing being too mushy as some others stated.  Will make this again.

This was GREAT and very EASY!  I scaled it down for one and it still was just fabulous!  I pounded the chicken breast (it was pretty thick one) and cooked it on low for about 2-2.5 hrs.  (On high at the end for a wee bit).  I have another similar casserole recipe, but this one is much easier.  Thank you!

Very good flavor.  I didn't even put in the ham and it was great.  My mom used to make this for Sunday lunch and bake it in the oven.  My husband is a minister and Sundays are pretty busy so the slow cooker alternative was great!  Bread crumbs do get soggy but it was still yummy.

If cooking on high it defenitley needs to be closer to three hours (still pretty pink at 2 hours).  I would probably cut back on the stuffing a little next time too and serve something else on the side.  The stuffing really soaked up the cheese and sauce.  Next time I would also probably try thin sliced ham and pre-cut it into strips.  Good flavor though and very easy.  One of the quicker slow cooker recipes as well.

This is so easy to make!  My family loves this dish.  The only thing I did was cut the milk down to 1/2 a cup and put the stuffing mix on at the last half hour of cooking.
