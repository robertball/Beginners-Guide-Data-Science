I FORGOT TO MENTION: FRESH LEMON JUICE IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST!! This is an absolutely fantastic recipe. It has actually become my base icing for many different things... 1. Omit the lemon and replace it w/ strawberry juice - and you have strawberry icing. 2. Make sure the butter is still fairly hard and add some body temperature melted chocolate and you have chocolate icing (again, omit the lemon!) 3. Add some very ripe mashed banana (just a tablespoon!) and you have delicious banana lemon icing. 4. Instead of lemon use a couple tablespoons of Bailey's Irish cream and you have a fantastic whippy icing for adults (absolutely delicious on chocolate cake)... I do have a couple tips regarding the original recipe. If you find the consistency to be too hard (which will very likely happen) I would not add more lemon unless you really like a very powerful lemon flavour. Instead add a few drops of milk or cream (it will not curdle if you add it once the other ingredients have already been beaten). Another way to combat too hard icing is to make sure your butter is absolutely at room temperature. Finally, for those on a tight budget - margerine works just fine!

i tried the original recipe and liked it alot, then i tweaked it a bit and now  i love it alot. :)
i used 2 sticks of butter, a 2lb bag of powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, 5-6 tablespoons of lemon juice & proceeded as directed. I beat the daylights out of it and it came out very light & fluffy! absolutely fab-u-loso indeed! perfect lemon buttercream icing!

I halved this to use with a lemon box mix cake. It was really sweet! I mean REALLY sweet! It didn't spread too well, either, as it was really thick.

Very nice frosting. Used it to ice a lemon sheet cake. If you want a really lemony taste, use lemon extract in place of the vanilla, or do half vanilla and half lemon.

This is a keeper. Sure you may have to add a little extra lemon juice or, as I did, a little milk...icing is like that..this icing is lemony and not too sweet.

i used 2 1/2 cups of the sugar and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice to add more lemon flavour and make it thinner as people were complaining it was too hard to spread. Ended up tasting excellent, very lemony but a little too runny. A little more confectioners sugar would have done the trick so maybe use 3 cups like the recipe says but add 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.

Tasted ok...we followed recipe to the letter added a little more lemon juice.  Tasted buttery, but was not the glaze consistency that it appeared to be.  Needs more more vanilla and something to make it more like a glaze if that is what you are looking for...

Very nice taste.  I needed to think it out with a little extra lemon juice though it was to stiff with just the 2 tablespoons.  It is tastey and perfect for the lemon cake I made.  Thanks-

I liked the way this icing got a crust on it  (really don't like those thick, creamy whipped frostings) ... but this was too tart with the lemon juice. Hubby took one bite of it ... made a sour face and then only ate the cake. Next time I will use milk instead of lemon juice and add 1 teaspon of lemon rind so we get the lemon flavor without the pucker!

This was good, but needed more lemon flavor. Easy to fix, just add more lemon juice. When making icing, I also like to add powdered sugar one cup at a time to taste test. It was sweet enough for me at 2 cups powdered sugar. With just 2 cups, it is between a glaze and thick icing texture, which was perfect for my dessert. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and rind.

This so good. I added the vanilla, and a small cap full of Lemon extract in addition. Another addition I added was 2 drops of Yellow food coloring & the zest of 1/2 a lemon (into the mixture). It turned out a beautiful pale yellow, perfect for my Lemon cake. I am adding the remaining zest  on top as well as slicing some lemons, dipping them in sugar and placing them on the cake. YUMMY!

I melted the butter (used unsalted) then added all of the ingredients.  I increased vanilla to 1 full teaspoon and added lemon extract like others (one teaspoon).  That made for a great thick, but not too thick, glaze.  Tasted great, too!

Great frosting!  Really tasty.  I didn't have fresh lemon juice, so I used the bottled kind and added a little lemon extract to make up for it.  I may have used less butter though.

Great recipe when you add 1.5 tbsp milk and decrease sugar by 1/4 cup. I found that to ice a 2layer 9" cake, you need to 1.5 teh receipe as there was BARELY enough to ice the cake.

This is perfect- light and fluffy if you beat it long enough, and fresh tasting with fresh lemon juice.  Was perfect on top of lemon cupcakes that weren't very lemony.  I went with 2.5 tablespoons of lemon juice in the frosting, and that was bordering on too strong, so I would be careful about adding any more than that.  I would add some milk to thin it out if needed, and more sugar if you need to thicken it up.  If you go with cupcakes, after frosting, top them with a large-grain turbanado-style sugar for a delicious crunch that looks gorgeous!  Yum!!!

I swear by lemon zest. If you are looking for a tart butter cream, this is your recipe if you add the zest of one lemon. I also added yellow food coloring.

I wanted this to pour over a lemon bunt cake, so I didn't want it too stiff. I ended up using 3 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice and letting the warm cake do the rest. Excellent recipe!

As is, the recipe is way too sweet and the consistancy too thick. It was more like a real sugary frosting, not a lemon icing. I added the juice of 1 1/2 fresh lemons and a bit of whipping cream to thin it out. It came out perfect. But I think I could use even more lemon juice next time.

Used on Greek Lemon Cake for my husband's birthday, and the combo was great. The icing, when made by the recipe, was too thick and unspreadable, but this is easily remedied by adding more liquid. I added extra lemon juice and some buttermilk until I had the consistency I wanted. Thanks!

I too made a lemon sheet cake from a box and did not have any frosting.  So I made this.  I think next time I will use lemon extract instead of the Vanilla.  Also, I put in some lemon zest from the yellow of the lemon before I juiced the lemon.  This is great and creamy!

I used this on vanilla cupcakes and...wow! Delicious! The only small change I made was by adding a dash of zest - not much - the zest of two lemon slices. This will be my go to lemon frosting recipe from now on. Thanks!

When I began making this icing I thought I had 3 cups Confectioners Sugar, I didn't and at that point it was too late. I decided to give it a fluffier feel and a not so bold lemon flavor to add a cup of flour. I had to add quite a bit more vanilla flavoring and I added 1/4 milk to thin it a bit. I was amazing. My family thought it was the best ever. And the other advantage is that it was less calories than would have been.

Easy to make but too sugary and not lemony enough.  So, I added zest of 1 large lemon and the juice of that lemon instead of the 2 Tbsp. called for.  Leave the rest of the recipe as is and spread over slightly warm, not hot, cake that has been pierced all over. It will partially sink into the cake and still ice the top, and it tastes GREAT!

I will try using less lemon the next time it was almost a little to sour for me. Will try less and review again later.

I tried this recipe for a box lemon cake. This is an overall perfect icing that you can use for just about any cake. Since I didn't have lemon juice or flavoring on hand, I substituted orange juice, and it came out delicious! Just enough citrus tang. Because I modify the box cake instructions (I add 1 package of lemon instant pudding and substitute orange juice for the water) the icing didn't really need any more lemon flavoring. It turned out very good!

Thanks for a great icing recipe. I'm sure I will use it many times.

I found it to be too sweet and too thick, so I added a bit of softened light cream cheese.  I then used this to ice a lemon cake, but I feel it would be better suited as a lemon cookie or sugar cookie frosting since it is so sweet and thick.

I frosted sugar cookies with this and it was really good. I ended up adding another teaspoon of lemon juice because I didn't think the flavor was strong enough, but I still think it might have needed more.

Excellent.  Cut back about 1/4 C on sugar then thinned with additional lemon juice and milk.  Beating for an extended period of time made the icing easy to spread.

This really didn't work out for me. I couldn't get the sauce past the stage where the granulated sugar stopped being granular. Hehe, uh oh. I just noticed however that the sugar is supposed to be confectioners sugar. This makes a lot more sense.  I just learned that confectioners sugar is powdered sugar. Now I know. My boyfriend ate my granulated sugar dressing anyway and liked the treat with it rather than without it. I will make it next time properly. I am giving this 5 stars because the taste is great.

This is great! Melt the butter and sift the confectioner's sugar for a smooth icing. I thinned it out with about a tablespoon of milk so I could apply it with a pastry brush to lemon-poppyseed scones. Absolutely delicious!

Really good. I used juice from half a lemon (watch out for seeds). I also used a fine grater to grate some  peel into the icing. It turned out great.

From the reviews I figured it would be a little difficult to spread, so I went ahead and added a bit of milk which made it too thin. I should have stuck to the recipe, but either way... tasty!

This frosting is great. A little lemon juice was added to make a more creamy consistency. It was very sweet but I will be thinking of ways to decrease the sweetness so I can reuse. I really like the way you can change it to your liking.

As written, way too sweet and thick.  After making as directed and tasting it, I quadrupled the lemon juice.  Then I added 1 Tbsp milk per other reviews, and it curdled.  The end result was tangy and a good consistency, but nothing like the original recipe.  And the curdling, while it still tasted fine, made all my dinner guests ask "what are we eating?" Would not make again.

This recipe was too sweet for my taste.  Also you must use real lemons and not lemon extract or bottled lemon juice from concentrate.  I would also agree with the previous recommendation to use extra lemon juice.  I used 3 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice and the juice squeezed from one small lemon, adding only half teaspoon of vanilla about quarter cup extra of the powdered sugar (make to your desired consistency).  It turned out very lemony and lovely spread over a store bought lemon cake mix.

Frosting was too stiff so I added 2T of milk then 1/2 a tub of cool whip and then it was divine! Perfect consistency for my lemon cake.

This was good tasting but next time I'll add more lemon.  I like lemon frosting real lemony!  This tasted like buttercream with a touch of lemon.

Very good, very sweet, but had to use milk to make it spreadable.  Fresh lemon juice is a must.

So great!!  We made this with Lemon Cake and all four of us (no kids included) ate the icing with just a bit of cake.  The icing was so good.  Don't think we changed the recipe at all.  It has been over a month, and we are still talking about it.  Got some fresh lemons today, so I think I will be making again.

This lemon frosting turned out just beautifully with a few modifications. I added 1 teaspoon (effectively doubling)vanilla extract, then added 2 T. cream and 1 T. milk as it was a little dry as written. I also used high quality bottled lemon juice (3 T.). Went so well with the lemon cake I made. I topped the whole thing off with a little shredded coconut and it was awesome! Everyone gobbled it up. Would be wonderful for Easter. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! Has just the right amount of lemon flavor, it isn't too overpowering. I used fresh juice and some yellow food coloring to make it look extra lemony.

Yummmmm! I was looking for a basic icing recipe, so I used milk instead of lemon juice. I guess I put about 5 Tbsp of milk and the icing was a big hit!

Wow! This was a FANTASTIC icing recipe! I actually added extra lemon juice and a little fresh squeezed O.J. to make it not so sour...turned out wonderful. I didn't taste too much butter but just enough! Thank you for the fantastic recipe!

I didn't measure the lemon juice. I just added drops, mixed and added more to my taste. What a great taste!! I didn't get the buttery taste others mentioned, but then I like lemon so I probably added more than anyone else. Next time I'm going to add lemon zest as well! Consistency is regulated by how much sugar you add. I needed mine to be real thick as I'm using it in between cake layers, so I'd say what I used was closer to 4 cups. This is a  wonderful, fast, and easy icing!

Excellent icing.  All I did was what others have suggested.  In addition to the lemon juice, I added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract and 1-2 tablespoons of milk (to get consistency of what I was looking for).  My family LOVED this refreshing icing.

This is a great icing/frosting.  I did make changes - I see recipes as guidelines with room for personal preferences. Soooo, after reading the reviews I decided to add more lemon juice and a bit of milk.  It came out perfect and sets very nicely.  I always cream the butter in a stand mixer first and continue to cream for add'l time once the sugar & other ingredients are added.  I will use this again...it was also so very easy :)

Yum! Made it for lemon box cake and it was perfect. I did soften the butter for about 15 secs in microwave to make it easier to spread instead of being cold straight from the fridge. Made it more room temp. Thanks!

The flavor is good, but it came out super sweet and stiff.  I had a real hard time trying to spread it on my cakes.  So, I modified the recipe and added an extra Teaspoon of lemon juice to counter the sweetness and a tablespoon of milk really helped to soften things up and make it more fluffy.

Great, easy recipe.  My husband found it a little sweet, but everyone else LOVED it!  I did find it didn't produce as much as I would have liked so I'll one and a half it this time around.  Tastes very fresh and NOT packaged.  Thanks Carol.

I used this recipe to decorate lemon cupcakes using various decorator tips, as I am practicing various techniques before I start taking cake decorating classes. It worked pretty well for that after a bit of refrigeration. The icing was very sweet, so I sprinkled it with lemon zest. It looked fancy and counteracted the sweetness. Served them at a get-together and they were a huge hit! Highly recommended!

This was delicious!  It was loaded with flavor.  I did use fresh squeezed lemon juice and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon extract.

Really tasty and easy. I just tossed a stick of cold butter in the KitchenAid and beat the heck out of it until it was smooth, and then added the other ingredients. Just for good measure, I threw in a few drops of yellow food coloring at the end. Then, I piped it onto lemon cupcakes. Lemon heaven.

Great base recipe. I ended up adding the juice from a whole lemon (it's more like 4ish tablespoons than 2) as well as a tablespoon-ish of half n half in order to make it go from super stiff icing to creamy enough to smear over a lemon loaf cake I made in an attempt to duplicate Starbuck's lemon pound cake (my fav). I used the "Lemon Cake" recipe from this site using a box of yellow cake mix and a box of lemon pudding. I didn't make that recipe's icing, obviously, and I put them in my 1lb bread pans and baked for 35min at 350. I glazed them with *this* recipe's icing after the loaves cooled for 15min and the icing formed a perfect layer on the top and then slightly dripped down the sides just like Starbucks! They are in the fridge cooling right now -- can't wait to see how they taste, but they look picture perfect!

This icing perfectly complimented a coconut cake and has a good balance between sweet and lemony. It held its shape nicely when piped.

A great, easy recipe for lovely lemon cake frosting! When I'd just made it, I thought there might be too much lemon juice in it, but once I'd iced the cake with it, I realised it was perfect. It was maybe a tad bit dry, but this might be my mistake of not having enough icing sugar and using 70g of white sugar instead to substitute. Otherwise, a very nice way to add a little lemon taste to an ordinary yellow cake. :)

Added 1/4 t lemon extract for extra lemon zing!  Needed maybe 25% more to fully ice a 2 layer cake.

I halved the recipe, and found the flavor nice and tart.  However, maybe it's b/c I'm not very familiar with buttercream, but well, the flavor is very buttery.  So not to my taste, but I'm not going to negatively affect the review when I chose a recipe that contained butter.  This is essentially a buttercream, right?

Very, very nice icing. Tweeked it a bit. Added another Tbs of lemon juice and a Tbs of water to get a better consistency. Still a little stiff so I mounded it on top of my bundt cake and microwaved it for 30 seconds then put it in the fridge. Perfect. This is a keeper. Recipe makes enough for two bundt cakes. Will make a nice filling for a layer cake.

This was pretty good.  Not as lemony as I would like and I used all lemon juice, no milk (for thinning).  I think I'll keep looking.

I really love this icing. It has a subtle lemon taste to it and I like to use it for spreading on cookies,  drizzling on my german pancakes, etc. For a little more runnier icing just add milk.

Love this frosting. I don't recommend adding lemon juice to thin the texture. It loses some of the creaminess. The thickness of the recipe as written worked fine for frosting my cake .

Good recipe. Yes, the frosting is sweet but what frosting isn't? I added a teaspoon more fresh lemon juice since I like my frosting a little more tart. I also highly recommend adding at least 2 extra tsp of whipping cream because this frosting is super dense and unspreadable. It turned out perfect for my lemon cupcakes w/those tweaks. Enjoy!

This is a mild and tasty icing.  I decided to make it for my Christmas gingerbread cookies because when I was a kid, my mom made real gingerbread covered in lemon sauce.  It was a perfect addition to my cookies.  I imagine it would be really good on lemon flavored shortbread or sugar cookies too.  Yum!

This is a great lemon icing.  I used a little bit less icing sugar so that it stayed quite soft.  I can think of a number of types of desserts to use this on.

Great, easy recipe.  Not too overwhelmingly lemony.  Add more lemon juice if you want a strong lemon taste.  I left out about a quarter cup of the sugar since I wanted it a little less sweet and a little thinner.  Whipped with mixer to perfect consistency.

This ended up being way too sweet for our taste.  I do agree that fresh lemon juice is much better for this recipe.

This recipe was phenomenal!  My younger daughter (7) made it with ease.  We added an extra splash of lemon juice and then cut a lemon in half and squeezed that in the mixture and it turned out just perfect!!!!

YUMMY! I used the juice of one freshly squeezed lemon and added yellow food coloring. I put this icing on top of some sour cream cookies and they were absolutely amazing!

The perfect lemon frosting!!  I like things really lemony, so instead of vanilla extract I used lemon.  Frosted a lemon cake with it and it disappeared.

I'm not sure what everyone was talking about....I needed at least 6 Tbsb. of fresh lemon juice to get this to spreading consistency.  Also, it was still too sweet with this extra juice. I think I'll look for something with less butter and more lemon flavor.

I made this frosting to frost a lemon cake. It was a little too strong for the cake but would probably be yummy on top of a plain white cake. Pretty good and will probably make again.

This icing was excellent with a few changes.  I thought the original recipe was too buttery so I added 2 more cups of confectioners sugar, and 2 more tablespoons of lemon juice.  After a thorough mixing it was delicious and perfect for my lemon cupcakes.

Wonderful!!!  I wanted a thick icing so I only used 2 cups of the sugar and it was perfectly what I wanted.  :)  I put it on top of lemon pound cake, very lightly flavored and it was just the perfect topping!!  We didn't think it was too tart in the least. Thanks!

I added an extra 2 Tbsp lemon juice and used this to frost the Luscious Lemon Cake from this site, which I baked as a birthday cake in a 9x13" pan. It crusted nicely, so I was able to decorate the cake without the colors running. Did I mention it's absolutely DELISH???

Very easy to make.  It seemed almost to sweet for icing...if that is possible.  I will reduce the amount of sugar I use next time.  Mine turned out more like a glaze.

This is a really great recipe and it was quite easy too.  The lemon icing was suberb- light and buttery.  I followed the exact recipe except I added a little bit of extra lemon juice.  It was easy, delicious and perfect over my Blueberry Lemon Pound Cake (also found on this site) Thanks for the great recipe!

I was not impressed with this recipe - I think it needs another background flavor besides the butter (which is pretty much all I tasted after the lemon).  I'll search for another recipe, thanks.

This frosting is amaing better than bakery. I substituted orange for lemon and also added freshly fine grated orange peel. I made a butter cake from the box and put a orange glaze on top of cake and then used this frosting, best cake ever.

This is a good icing... but the first time I made it I put to much lemon in it and it had us all puckered up including to dog ( to funny no matter how much he licked it just got worse lol). The second time it was great, it's a nice change from the norm.

Very good.  I added some grated lemon rind but it was great without.  I filled an 8" white layer cake w/strawberries & whipped cream and used this to frost the top and sides - next time I would make another half a batch as I barely had enough.

This frosting is the best frosting ever. I think that the problem people are having with it being too thick is that they're not measuring the powdered sugar right you can't pack the powered sugar you first have to fluff it up and then measure it out. When you pack your powdered sugar you get too much sugar in your recipe.

This recipe is a really good basic recipe.  Room temperature butter is critical to it not being too stiff.  I needed to make frosting for two bundt cakes with the intent to frost the top only.  The cakes are for a summer fund raiser and will need to withstand an overly warm room.  The frosting will either stay put of attractively slip down the cake a little.  Hopefully :) Keeping proportions of ingredients roughly the same as the recipe, I used one bag of confectioners sugar and the juice of two lemons.  That was more than the 4 tablespoons that would have been called for.  I balanced to spreading consistency by adding more butter.  I also threw in 1/2 tsp of lemon zest for kick and appearance.  Whip the daylights out of it and it should be fine.  It was very smooth and absolutely no curdling appearance with good body for frosting.

I was looking for a lemon buttercream icing and it seemed this recipe would do the trick, however 1) it wasn’t enough to ice an 8 Inch cake 2) it was WAY sweet without any depth to it. I made the original recipe, as mentioned, way too sweet. I might use salted butter next time to cut the sweetness. I added more lemon choose and a pinch or two of salt and this helped the flavor a bit, however it wasn’t enough to cut the sweetness. Ended up having to soften 8 ounces of cream cheese and whipping it in, as well as add about 1/2 C to 1 C more sugar, jest to have enough to ice a 2 layer 8 inch cake.

I didn’t have lemon oil or lemon powder, but, I did have crystallized sugar packets equal to one wedge of lemon each.  I used 3 packets in a 2 tablespoons of water and icing cake out less sweet and a little tart.  I put it on my lemon bundt cake with fresh sliced strawberries in the hole of the cake.  Family loved it!

Super quick and easy, light, fluffy frosting.  Paired perfectly on my 5yo’s lemon poppy seed muffin creation that he baked, frosted, and topped with a fresh strawberry!  Thank you for an easy and good recipe! ??

Great Lemon flavor. Very easy to make. I added lemon zest right into the frosting instead of on top. Even my 2 yo granddaughter loved it. Will definitely make again

Kinda wish I had used lemon extract instead of actual lemon juice. Has a bit of an unpleasant sour taste when combined with the other ingredients. Maybe the cake will neutralize the icing.

Easy to make and very versatile. I added the sugar little by little until I got the consistency I wanted. I ended up using the exact quantities stated in the recipe. I put sime mashed banana to make it a lemon-banana icing like someone suggested it n the comments. Thank you for the suggestion. It was great in my banana cake.

This is an excellent recipe!  WOW!!!  I think some people who didn't like it may not have mixed it well enough.  It can be hard to mix if your butter isn't completely soft.  I thought it was going to be too dry, but I kept mixing.  I turned out so yummy.  Your guest will be impressed!!

I'll definitely use this icing recipe again.
I had one fresh lemon and used the juice, but still added a little bottled juice and it didn't alter the taste at all.
Just right tartness.

Made it for a layer cake with lemon pudding between the layers. Almost tasted like a cream cheese frosting but lemony.

Fabulous and easy. I followed the recipe precisely, and used a stand mixer to beat it to the proper consistence. It's so good you can almost eat it with a spoon, and it's easy to spread.

This icing is good, though a bit lumpy....
Other than that the icing was good.... though a little sweet.
But I honestly WOULD recommend this.

The icing tasted alright, it was the texture that put me off. I added an extra teaspoon of white sugar and an eighth of a teaspoon of water, along with one extra tablespoon of vanilla extract. Mine turned out very grainy, and when I attempted to spread it onto the cake I made, it ran down the sides and collected more as a watery glaze. I don't know what I did wrong, but I will not be using this recipe again.

I halved this recipe, I found it a little to think as well and just put a tab more lemon juice and a splash of milk made it perfect on my blue berry crumb bars!

Went great. Used bottled lemon juice. Did have to add about 1 Tbsp milk extra to frost and forgot to add the vanilla but still was a nice mild lemon to  frost a cake w a raspberry filling. Lots of compliments.

Very tasty and easy to make. My ten year old daughter and her friend made white cupcakes from a box mix but wanted to use homemade frosting.  This icing made their plain Jane cupcakes into something special!   The consistency was a bit thick, so they added a bit of milk.  Everyone loves them!

Good base recipe, but 2 tbsp of lemon juice just isn't enough.  I squeezed the juice of 2 lemons and it was glorious!  Also, needed to add about 1/4 cup of milk to the icing sugar and butter because it was really dry. It's now 5 stars :)

Halved the recipe to ice cupcakes. I didn't have fresh lemons. Instead, I added lemon extract to lemon concentrate - maybe 1 to 2. I thought it was lemony enough in taste but could've used a bit more tang. 
The icing was hard to work with. I ditched the spreader immediately for a homemade pastry bag. Unfortunately the bag didn't last 3 cupcakes. I ended up using the back of a teaspoon dipped in hot water to ice the rest of the cupcakes.

I added more zest and juice, the amount of sugar depends on weather you want an icing or a frosting which are not the same thing!!!!! I made mine a frosting for a lemon cake, superb. Let it sit out a bit for frosting the cake then refrigerate for piping. Very lemony and buttery....

This is a great basic lemon frosting.  Fresh lemon juice is a must and you may need a little more to get the right consistency.  I also added a decent amount of fresh lemon zest to give it an extra kick (I LOVE lemon).  I made 1 & 1/2 times this recipe in order to have enough to properly frost an 8 in. layer cake.   Using this frosting gave my box cake the impression of a fully homemade dessert.

This is a very delightful icing.  I was halving the recipe and,  heeding other reviewers that it was too thick to spread, I used slightly less confectioner's sugar but still ended up doubling the amount of lemon juice (fresh) and adding maybe 1 tbsp milk as well.  The halved recipe iced the tops of two loaf cakes quite well.  I'll be using this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Carol.

4.5 stars IMO. I would recommend making this w/o the vanilla first and add in if needed. I was very happy with the results w/o vanilla. Also, I used a high quality lemon concentrate and still got positive results. I was very pleased with the taste and texture of this frosting.  It tasted wonderful on  banana cupcakes (recipe from this site). Had to refrigerate it a bit and was easy to spread once it returned to room temperature.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious and easy to make. My only changes were: I had squeezed two small lemons which made about 3 1/2 tablespoons of juice, so I added it all. And as mentioned by other reviewers, I added about 2 tbls milk to make it creamier. Very easy, tasty, and creamy!!

Very thick icing that is very sweet.  Added more lemon juice because it was pure sugar tasting.  I didn't love the thick and buttery texture so I melted it down and used it as a ganache and drizzled over my cake.  Tasted better melted too.  We will see how it tastes on the cake when I cut into it tomorrow!

As a first-time baker, I found this easy to prepare and tasty... I adjusted the lemon juice up by 50% to increase its tanginess.   I will look for a less sweet icing next time...

Really disappointed after all the good reviews on it.  The butter was way too much and because it was so stiff,  I added more lime (all I had in store) to the icing which dominated the icing.  Definitely will not be using this again.

It was a smidge runny, but for the cake I made (Lemon Lover's Bundt Cake), it worked out. I did make a small change...I added the juice of one lemon and added 1/4 tsp lemon extract.  I did add about 1/4 cup more sugar to thicken the icing. It made barely enough for a 2 layer cake.  The lemon flavor was amazing.

This is a fantastic recipe, however you need to add 2-3 more tablespoons of lemon juice.

Fabulous, easy recipe! After reading other reviews, I tweaked it to use the 3 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons lemon juice,  1/2 tsp lemon extract and used a tablespoon of grated lemon rind. Perfect consistency and
flavor. However, I needed more to cover 24 cupcakes. Next time!-Meme

I too added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. Then I added 3 oz of Philadelphia Cream Cheese. The CC added a very nice extra texture and flavor to this recipe!

This would be perfect for decorating. As other reviewers have stated, it is very firm and hardens fast. It's also SUPER sweet but that's what I wanted. I used it to frost some bland lemon cookies and this made them perfect.

Real butter is a must. Margarine or olive oil sticks won't cut it. Like another poster said, I use this as a base buttercream frosting. It can be flavored any way you like. Adjust the sugar depending on how much liquid you are adding for flavor. Delicious just "plain" with vanilla extract.

WAAAAY too much sugar, too much butter and not nearly enough lemon. Decent if you prefer buttery supersweet icing with a hint of lemon, though. I would suggest you halve the sugar, triple the lemon, skip the vanilla, only 2 tbsp of butter and whisk it in the double boiler.

I just made it,  no vanilla, more than 2 Tablespoons of real lemon juice but not quite 3.  P-e-r-f-e-c-t  
I was icing a 13 x 9 and it was just enough.  
I would do 1+1/2 or double for a layer cake.

It was great but i tweaked it a bit.
 after blending i found it was much to thick so i added: more lemon juice, lemon zest and about 2 table spoons of milk. Tastes amazing!
This is definitely a keeper

My 9yo daughter made this, and she replaced 1 table spoon lemon extract instead of the lemon juice, then added 2 table spoons water and it was perfect.  Then she added juice from 1/2 lemon and she still loved it.

Great recipe. It is delicious on chocolate cake, though I did cut down a little bit on the sugar and add a dash of orange juice. Only one thing: If you mix by hand, butter must be room temperature or else it is very hard to blend completely.

Love it...with a few changes.  Agree with the reviews that say it's rather sweet as is.  I used 1/2 butter as called for, 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, and an entire lemon squeezed, about 4 tbsp, as well as the pulp.  It is PERFECT.  Sweet and tart!

I tried this recipe and loved it. I used the recommendations by blondiecakes and the frosting came out wonderful. I topped the frosting with lemon zest to add a little more color as well as added lemon zest in the actual recipe. The frosting melts in your mouth! I used Italian butter so the frosting came out so smooth and that's why the frosting melted in your mouth. Thanks for your suggestions blondiecakes! Also for those of us who are not mathmatically inclined, 2 lbs is more or less 6 cups (powder sugar ingredient in blondiecakes suggestions). Just looking out for you all and saving you all a google search ;)
Happy Baking!.

Best and Easiest icing I've ever made. I like that it doesn't need past. eggs white. I fail at those. Also I doubled the lemon juice as it was for a lemon cake. Tasted great! Will def. use it for other things.

It was a bit too sweet and the icing was way too thick. If i were to use this recipe again I would add more butter and halve the recipe. The lemon flavor was fairly strong when in added some lemon and lime zest. Overall it was OK.

Great Icing very lemony and light. I did add a couple of teaspoons of whipping cream because it seemed a little stiff.

This was great on my lemon pound cake. The only thing that I did different was added a  little less powdered sugar and a little more lemon juice to make it into a glaze consistency to pour on top of the cake. I will definitely use this again.

I added the zest from 1/2 lemon, and 2 Tbsp. orange juice (In addition to the 2 Tbsp. lemon juice) to make it less  tart. Very nice with Carol's White Cake with Lemon Filling on this website.

Lovely recipe, fast and easy. I substituted butter for low-fat margarine and replaced the lemon juice with orange concentrate. It's a flavorful icing and was a nice topping to my chocolate cake!

Taste was delicious, but not what I expected in consistancy, more like a frosting if made according to the recipe. For my purposes made a simple lemon confectioners glaze instead.

So simple, yet SO YUMMY!! I made a pound cake from scratch (cupcakes actually) and used this icing for them. What a great combo.

Excellent recipe! I used it to decorate my lemon cupcakes for Easter. I divided the icing in half and tinted one half yellow and the other half green. The description for this recipe is perfect: it is delicious and so very easy to make. Thanks, Carol. I will share this recipe with my whole family.
