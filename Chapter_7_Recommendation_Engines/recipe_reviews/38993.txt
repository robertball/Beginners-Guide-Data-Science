Delicious and easy. I will use the cream topping with other deserts. My man loved it and did not want to share with the other guests. Two thumbs up!

This is one of my all-time favorite desserts. It is exceptional with an Oreo cookie crumb crust. I save time by microwaving the chocolate morsels in 25 second intervals, stirring between each until it is melted and smooth. Regular whipping cream also works perfectly in place of heavy. Be sure to sift the powdered sugar and cocoa powder so that the cream whips up smooth and lump-free. I find it only needs to freeze about four hours before it's ready. Store it in the freezer. The recipe is easy, quick and absolutely delicious -- it won't last long!

Yummy!  I made the crust with oreos and butter.  What could be better than coffee and chocolate?!

This recipe is the BEST! Not exactly for the "health-conscious", but is a hit with everyone. My roommates gobbled it all before I had a chance to taste it- and they were convinced it was store bought.

I fixed this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I made a crust out of Oreos and margarine. This pie is best left in the freezer. It doesn't get too hard. The topping is AMAZING!

This was good, but a little too rich for my taste.  Made it with the mock chocolate cookie crust from this site.
