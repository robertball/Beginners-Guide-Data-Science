This was good. My husband liked it. I liked the bottom part alright but wasn't insane over the cheese puff business. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added more cheese, and... the result was kind of stiff. Not at all puffy. I am positive it was entirely my fault and not the recipe. :D I'm not great at this!

Pic #2 (prior to transferring to cassarole dish) & #3 are mine.  I made a few small changes; substituted Shortening with Butter, Gr. Beans with Gr & Rd Pepper.  I added some extra ingrediants; 250g cooked rice, 1 tsp Garlic Salt, Cinnamon, Thyme & Paprika ~ 1/2 tsp of each, 1 Cup Beef Broth.  Smelled very good while baking.  I took a small taste when it cooled.  The Cheese Puff is quite Stiff and lacks flavour, but the meat & Veg mixture is tasty.

This turned out pretty good, in place of shortening in the main dish I used butter and used canned rotel tomatoes with herbs and seasonings.  I did use fresh carrots and green beans that I sauted in butter before adding to dish.  I did use butter flavored Crisco shortening for the puffs.  This turned out really well and I will use again.  Thanks for the post.

This dish was a little disappointing.  The 'cheese puff' was more like a thick, orange biscuit and the mixture itself tasted a very odd.  The mixture seemed a little salty and seemed to have a weird 'canned' flavor.  The biggest disappointment was the cheese puff.  It did not have much of a cheese flavor to it, as I had expected.  I would definately add more cheese if you are going to try this recipe.  Unfortunately, I will not be making this recipe again.

Not very good at all. I thought the biscuit puff would come out better for some reason. 

I'd have been better off with hamburger helper.

While I was making this I kept thinking we won't like this but we ate the whole thing everyone including me went for seconds!  I used corn instead of carrots (just what we had on hand) but left everything else alone.

This was a great recipe for me and my family. I replaced the carrots with corn, but other than that, left the recipe alone. It was quick, inexpensive, and easy. It will definitely make it's way to my table again.

This was a great easy dinner. I used fresh cooked carrots and mushrooms instead of green beans, and ground turkey instead of gound beef. It tasted great. good reheated the next day.

This was a great recipe.  I liked it.  My husband liked it.  My 6-year-old daughter didn't like it, but she doesn't like anything if it isn't macaroni and cheese.

I have been eating this since I was a child.  My mother lost her cookbook, and I thought the recipe was gone forever.  We have always substituted corn for the carrots, and double the puff recipe.

This dish is a lot like the shepherd's pie i've made, but I like this better. I deleted the canned carrots, and replaced the  shredded cheddar cheese with shredded  Monterey  and Colby jack cheese as my husband's not a big cheddar fan, and the flavor was good. The only problem I had was that I needed to cook it a little longer than 20 minutes(even though the oven was very hot) as the dough was golden brown, and like an other reviewer-it wasn't very puffy, but I also think that was my fault, which is maybe the real reason the dough wasn't done in 20 minutes.   But we enjoyed it, and will make it again.  :-)

This was ok, not that great, although it was quick and easy to make.  Overall, didn't have much flavor.  I used spiced diced tomatoes (italian spices) - probably could use more flavor/spices.  If I ever make again, I'll be tweaking with more spices to the meat mix.

This dish is very tasty.  My cheese crust was tasty and delicious.  I would bake it for 35 minutes.  I used butter instead of shortening.  Will make it again.
