Wow!!! This was delicious!! I served them over ice cream more times than i can remember since finding this recipe a few weeks ago.  It has become my 8 year olds favorite desert and I have made this for many friends who all love it.  It is very much like a bananas foster ( OH, I did make one change, I used brown sugar instead of white)

Had a wonderful taste, but were costly to make and best when served hot.  They are great for special occasions, but only when I have extra time and money.

This recipe was good, a little to sweet for my taste.  Great over some vanilla ice cream though.

This is a very quick and delicious recipe.  I doubled the amount of caramels.  I also added chopped walnuts. Peanuts would be great as well!! Thanks for sharing.

Maybe my apples were too tart, but I think this would be better with brown sugar or a little more white sugar.  Otherwise, it was quite good.

I really liked this recipe.  I served it as a topping over a NY Cheesecake but I think it would have been perfect just as is or over ice cream.

I used half butter, half Smart Balance, and also brown sugar with a little Splenda. Like other reviewers, we had it with vanilla ice cream, and it was really delicious. I'd like to try it again with walnuts. Thanks, Sarah!

This was great, topped pancakes with this. Used brown sugar instead of white and used caramel syrup because it was what was on hand and omitted nuts. added more sugar and cinnamon to suit our taste.

We loved it, though, I think the butter was a bit much.   I also used brown sugar like others have.  Thanks.

Excellent! Since we need to follow a gluten free diet, I used this in place of apple pie.  Served with ice cream.  Everyone loved it.

Was looking for something with apples to serve over french toast.  This was very good, I think "toffee" sounded good, but the caramels weren't heavy enough to call it toffee.  We finished off the rest over a dish of ice cream and it was really good.
