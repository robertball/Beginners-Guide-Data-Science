This is a really easy recipe that presents well. I have made it twice, but this time noticed an error and I thought someone could learn from my "mistake"/choice.The directions say "follow the brownie package instructions"...(1/4 cup of water) but and the ingrediants in the recipe  call for 1 cup of water. USE A 1/4 CUP. 1 Cup is too much. Hope this makes sense!

If you're making these for Christmas or a special occasion and you've got kids, plan on a double batch from the get-go.  The recipe made close to 80 petit-four sized brownines, but they disappear fast ... especially when frosted.  I frosted mine with chocolate fudge frosting and sprinkled them with red and green sugar crystals.  Delicious.

This was SO easy!! I made it for a party and it got rave reviews from all. Only difference was to make my x-mas tree, I needed 40 little brownie cups. My recipe made about 48 brownies too, so there were some left over for the kids! I love the idea of using this for other holidays too-it would make a cute Valentine's dessert. I have to agree too about the amount of water-I decreased mine to about 3/4 cup water and next time I think I would use about 1/2 cup water.
