Absolutely delicous! Our new favorite dip!! I put some chives, garlic powder and cayanne pepper in it just to add some more flavors.

This was an interesting dip. The kids didn't seem to care for it and I liked it but not enough to make it again just for one person. This was a little on the salty side but that's to be expected when using a Campbell's soup.

Tried this out first for the family before serving it to company. We all thought it was not worthy of eating or making it again.

I was very skeptical about this dip at first but it's soooo delicious! I even added a little left over cheese on top after it cooked.

This is soooo good! Served it in a loaf of bunny bread for Easter with lots of veggies to dip! I a m making it again tonight because the family has been begging for me to make it again. I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it is great with bread, veggies, or chips!

Tasty dip--I served it with french bread but forgot the veggies.  A bit salty, and I think it could use some tweaking but I'm not sure how.  The same night we had baked potatoes and my husband topped his with some of the dip.

This was good, but really needs to be kept warm somehow.  It does not make enough for a crockpot, so maybe doubling the recipe and keeping it in a dip-size crockpot would work.

I wasn't crazy about it, my husband liked it. I think I will stay with the cold version of onion dip.

I made this recipe last night. I added like 2-3 Tbsp of worchershire sauce and garlic powder. Used 2 cans of soup, one block of cream cheese and 2 cups of mozzarella mixed with provolone. Put it all in a small crock pot and it turned out good. Served it with cubes of crusty garlic bread.
