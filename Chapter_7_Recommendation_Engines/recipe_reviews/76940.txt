Loved it!  I improvised a little ...  Williams' pre-pkgd chili spice mix, black beans, hominy and didn't add the add'l corn.  i used a can of diced tomatoes also.    Its a great alternative to standard beef chili.

With some changes, this recipe is FABULOUS!!!  I used 3 chickens instead of 2.  I didn't bother to make my own broth and used just 6 cups of water and chicken boullion.  I pureed 1 can of hominy and one can of beans for added thickenss, and when the whole beans were added, I used 1 can hominy and 1-2 cans of beans.  This makes the chili much meatier and the added beans (both whole and pureed) add a lot more thickness and texture.

I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of this soup. It was just a bit too much corn flavor after a whole bowl.

My husband found this recipe years ago in an airline magazine. It's awesome!  I wouldn't change the recipe a bit, it's perfect the way it is; a bit time consuming, but worth the time & effort. I fry up some corn tortilla strips in hot oil till crispy and use it as a condiment along with the limes and cilantro. My kids request this recipe over and over again.  It freezes well too!

I made this with chicken thighs rather than rotisserie chicken, and halved the recipe.  I used hot green chile, and adjusted the spices--using a little more than half.  I also used prepared stock, and simmered it in the crock pot all day.  This is not what I would necessarily call a "chili".  To me, it seemed more like a New Mexico posole with chicken.  The flavor was fantastic.  I think I will also try this in the future with pork rather than chicken.

This was very good.  The only changes I made were to omit the cayenne pepper (we don't like spicy) and to cut the recipe in half.  Oh, and I used 1 can hominy pureed and 1 can cannellini beans.  It seemed like it might be missing something.  But, it was a nice change from red chili.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this! I used 3 cans of white beans instead of hominy and added an extra can of jalapenos.  Will definitely make again.

I did not care for this. The food for this recipe taste better before you cook as opposed to after you cook it. It was spicy and did not taste good!

Thank you for this recipe! My husband and I had found something similar in a Back Packer magazine... but lost the mag and feared we wouldn't be able to come up with something nearly as good. Your recipe was just what we were looking for!! The only adjustment we made was to use slightly less broth so that we could serve the chili on tortillas - burrito style. Excellent! Thanks again!

Great I used 1 cup of corn and pretty much followed the rest. Did add a little better than bullion to make broth a bit more rich in flavor.

This was fantastic!  I halved the recipe which fed my family of 5 with leftovers for a few lunches the next day. Followed the recipe very closely but had a couple minor changes.  Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and did 2, 15 oz cans of great northern beans.  We didn't add any cheese, sour cream or other chili topping.  It was wonderful by itself!  Don't skip on simmering the leftover rotisserie skin and bones with the broth, it really adds to the flavor.  There was a decent amount of fat in the broth from the skin and bones, so I skimmed off a decent amount of it.
This has to be my favorite white chili recipe!  Thanks Pam!

Love this recipe!  Have made it several times to rave reviews!  The only thing I changed was adding a 12 ounce jar of Trader Joe’s Salsa Verde, when I added the corn.  It brightens up the flavor just enough!

This was an amazing and flavorful stew. I substituted chicken thighs for the rotisserie chicken because I think most rotisserie chickens are too dry. I also substituted arbol Chili's instead of the cayenne pepper, and for an 8-serving portion, I used 3 Chipotle Chiles with 2 teaspoons of adobo sauce (from a can of Chipotle Chiled in adobo sauce) for the mild green chiles, and substituted black beans for the corn.

This is delicious. I used a jalapeño pepper I had on hand instead of green chiles.  I'll definitely make this again!

Followed recipe exactly. Would not change a thing.Amazing! My husband who does not like too spicy loved it. The garnishes of cilantro, sour cream and green hot sauce let you customize your level of spicy and heat.  Thanks for posting.

I made a few minor adjustments to this recipe - I only made half a recipe, I cut the cumin to 2 tsp and used fresh corn cut off the cob. My husband and I enjoyed this a lot. He added lots of lime juice to his, while I topped mine with a dollop of sour cream and chopped cilantro. Yum!
