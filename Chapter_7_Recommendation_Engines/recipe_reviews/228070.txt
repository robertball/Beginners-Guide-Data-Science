This method is a bit off though the seasonings are very interestng and flavorful.I admit to throwing on some rosemary for added flavor and I plugged the neck cavity with a potato so the steam did not escape. I would never try to set this directly on the grill over the can. Just too tippy for that. Put the can on an aluminum wrapped broiler pan so there is some stability and you don't have a chance of boiling hot ingredients tipping over on you. This took almost 90 minutes to cook through for me but it would depend on the temp of your grill. Thanks for sharing!

I use a Webber poultry roaster for beer can chicken.  Combine the  drippings and about half of the remaining stout mixture to make a delicious gravy.  Save the bones and trimmings 3  of these make a gallon of an amazing bone broth.  I use the Thai sun peppers (small ones often used in pad Thai) and believe youngs double chocolate stout is the best.   2 other stouts and one porter were tried.  In my grill or oven at 450 ( When out of charcoal) this takes 50 -55 minutes to hit 165f.  It has been a big hit with picky grandkids who "don't like spices" I told them it was mostly sugar and chocolate there is just enough sweetness to satisfy them

Great recipe. I put a mixture of seasonings on and I put some cayenne pepper in the beer. I used more seasonings than the recipe called for. It was tender and the cook time for this recipe is on point because the chicken was perfectly cooked. I loved it!!!
