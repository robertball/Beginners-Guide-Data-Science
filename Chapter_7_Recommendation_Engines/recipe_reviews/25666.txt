This is the second or third time I've made this soup now.  Here's what I'm doing differently.  I only use half of the recommended potatoes with all of the liquid plus an extra cup of milk.  I skip the bacon (don't like bacon) and add lots and lots of extra cheese.  You may add even more milk or chicken stock.
Good flavour though!

This recipe turned out okay, but as in any slow cooker recipe I should have remembered to add the milk at the very end.  I got curdled soup.  Over all it tasted okay, just looked like cottage cheese.  And I added more spices, like tabasco squeez'ins (the left over pulp from making tabaco sauce), to give it some zip.

I loved this recipe.  My husband thought it was a little "grainy" and thick.  It was almost like cheesy mashed potatoes...but the flavor was delicious.  I would definitely make it again, but factor in more liquid.

Fantastic soup!  I didn't have any bacon, so I used the leftover Easter ham and added some green onions and dill spice to the other ingredients.  I do agree on the liquid ratio, so I added enough milk to cover the potatoes.  Perfect! Also, instead of dicing the potatoes, I thinly sliced them making this soup look like 'restaurant style'.  I did not blend the potatoes with a stick blender as it was thick enough. Will definitely add to my cookbook!

You can play around with this recipe a lot. Firstly, I didn't measure the liquid. If I felt it was getting too thick, I just added more. Didn't use water or base; only chicken broth and fat free half and half. Hubby smoked a pork tenderloin, so I added that in lieu of the bacon. Sprinkled in more seasonings (garlic and onion powders, dry mustard and dried parsley) and used three leftover baked potatoes from Sunday dinner. I ran the potatoes thru the food processor before I began so I didn't need to puree. Lastly, I felt this needed more cheese than stated. In addition to the horseradish cheddar I used, I also threw in some parm. Didn't feel the need to use my slow cooker for this; worked well on top of the stove. This was a great place to start Kathy; just made it my own. Thanks so much as this turned out absolutely delicious!

We loved this soup, which is easy & fulfilled all our expectations of cheesy potatoe-y goodness. And I am an Idaho girl, so I love potatoes ! Don't skip the puree step. Recommend thick-cut, butcher bacon and a can of corn, too. Thanks for the great recipe

Great recipe and easy to make! The only thing I would do differently is add the cooked bacon the same time as the rest of the ingredients for more flavor.

Tasted pretty good, but not good enough for all the time and effort that went into it. Didn't taste like I had anticipated it would. Not like the restaurants soup. Similiar, but no cigar! Had to add more milk, it was way too thick. And added a lot more cheese. It dirtied up every bowl and pan I had just to make it in the crockpot! Is not "quick and easy"! Not worth it.

I took this recipe and made it a little healthier/lighter. Just by looking at the recipe before I made it, four cups liquid would not be enough for five pounds of potatoes. I used organic red potatoes and instead of chicken soup base and plain water, I used organic chicken broth (about six cups). I didn't need the flour (I've had some experiance cooking potato soup--flour is not really needed as the potato starch thickens the soup well enough) so I cut back on the butter just a bit and sauteed the onion, carrots, celery and a mess of minced fresh garlic all together before adding it to the crockpot with the potatoes and broth. I did add a few more spices (dried chives, onion powder, garlic powder, Beau Monde seasoning). After the potatoes had cooked in the crockpot, I mushed them with my potato masher only slightly for a chunkier soup, then added the milk (I used fat free evaporated milk for a creamier texture--I didn't need the full cup). When this was all said and done, this is a fair soup that was bendable to make my own and worked well to stretch what I had for a cheap lunch this week. I think this would be a good soup to substitute in cauliflower for low-carbers, too.

I was trying to find a recipe to use up my "on-sale" potatoes.  I love potato soup.  I added all the dairy products an hour before serving and did not get curdled looking soup.  While the flavor was good, I did not like the texture.  My picky fiance wouldn't even go near it.  Although I would like to try it again, it's a lot of work and probably will not.  Thanks for sharing, though.

I was surprised by the thickness of the soup after I used the stick blender.  I never thought to add more water or chicken stock.  So it turned out to be flavored mashed potatos with a few potato chunks.  This kids helped chop up veggies in the chopper so everything was minced but the potatos.  Very good I will make again.

We didn't like this at all.  I followed the recipe but mine turned out more like thick mashed potatoes and extremely bland.  I added a bunch of spices to it and we still couldn't finish it.  I recommend making half first to test it.

This was just the "comfort-soup" I was hoping for!  I omitted the bacon and found it necessary to add extra chicken broth (I used chicken broth where the recipe called for water and chicken soup base).  Also, since it was comfort food I was after, I wasn't shy with using a lot of extra sharp cheddar cheese.  I garnished with homemade garlic croutons--the perfect addition.  Delicious recipe!

Fantastic soup! I didn't have any bacon, so I used cubed ham. I do agree on the liquid ratio, so I added enough milk to cover the potatoes. Perfect! We ate it as it came out of the crockpot. No mashing/blending etc... Everyone loved it!

Yummy! I have no idea what soup base is so i used a whole can of chicken broth! Also I added the milk (about 2 cups) an hour before the soup was done. I just added enough to make it look like soup to me! turned out very good!

Very good. Used 5 cups chicken stock, I don't use bullion cubes...Cooked on high for 4 hours then crockpot turned automatically to warm :) I used an immersion blender on the entire contents of slow cooker before adding the milk & cheese (3 cups of grated cheese please), this made a nice silky textured soup. I then added diced, cooked red potatoes w/skin on (about 5 small). It was only 20 min extra work to cut & boil them.  I added 3 chopped green onions after adding the red potato and bacon. Oh, and it definitely needs more bacon!! I used 10 pieces. The next day for leftovers,  I had to add a couple tablespoons chicken stock to each serving to thin it out.  Probably not the most heart-healthy recipe but I will definitely make again-my way. Serve with a green salad to feel less guilty ;)

Wonderful soup! Sauteed veggies in olive oil. Cooked the soup on the stovetop since I didn't have time to do it in the crockpot. Added 3 cans chicken broth and the chunked potatoes and cooked for 2 hours. Added 2 cans FF evaporated milk plus 1/2 cup skim milk to thin it out a bit. Added 1/4 cup chipotle cheddar and 1 cup sharp cheddar and cooked for another hour. It was absolutely wonderful. No bacon...didn't need it.

I also found that the milk curdled. The flavors overall were good, but as someone said earlier, add the milk at the end so you do not get a lumpy mess.

This is a great beginers recipe.  I used chicken stock where water was listed.  The additions of both more stock and cream was absolutely needed.  I would not do this recipe on high( hello glue).  This recipe screams skip the bacon add a butcher smoked ham hock.  Took me 20 minutes before I went to work and ten minutes to finish(less with a smoked ham hock).  Variation substute a leek for the onion.  Other halve thought the same thing. I also cut all the quantites by 1/4 to get the serving size done to 4.  Will absolutly do again

Great soup. Even though it was my first time making it, I made a few adjustments.  I pureed all of it in the blender in small batches and put it back in.  This made it really thick so I stirred in more milk (about a cup) and let it sit a while cooling from the crock pot.  I also added extra sharp cheddar, green onions, and bacon to the top at the end.  It was great!  I only give it 4 stars because my husband said it was a little bland.  Maybe some other spicce (besides salt) could improve it more.

This soup was okay, but didn't turn out at all like I expected! From the reviews and description I was expecting something creamier (don't know why I was with the small amount of milk called for but that is my own fault)  and cheesier. This soup was neither. When I tasted the soup after adding the cheese it seems like the cheese was added as an afterthought, not a main flavor. If I have the time I MAY (and that's a big may) try this again. For a creamier soup maybe I'll use whole milk for all the liquid (I only had skim on hand) and use more chicken flavoring and omit the cheese entirely, making it more of a creamy vegetable soup. If I do that I think I'll replace some of the potatoes with a turnip to add some more flavor. The idea was good, but I personally think this recipe needs some work.

I thought this soup was great. As written I would give it 4 stars just because I think it could use a little boost. I added about twice as much cheese as called for and additional milk because it was quite thick. Instead of taking some out and blending it and then adding back in, I just put my hand mixer in the pot and blended until I got it the way I wanted it. I added minced fresh garlic and instead of 2 TBS chicken soup base, I just used a can of chicken broth because that's what I had on hand. I will definitely make this one again, but I also might try some of the other recipes for this sort of soup. Thanks!

This was an excellent soup. I almost destroyed it with too much salt, but adding a little extra four, milk and water solved my problem. I found the last step of blending 4 cups to be an indispensable rule as it gave the soup a wonderful texture! My husband is not a real "soup person", but he liked this one. It was nice and hearty.

This was good! I skipped the part about the food processing and just served it as chunky potato soup. Also used fewer potatoes and improvised with chicken stock. Good winter soup recipe.

Came out more like mashed potatoes.  Definitely needs more liquid since it's made in the crockpot.  Don't be afraid to add more spices either.

This was a big hit with the family.  Here are my modifications 1)I didn't get it started in time to do it in the crockpot so I had to make it on the stove top.  So to hurry the veggies along, I sauted the carrots and celery along with the onion.  2)Used chicken broth in place of water and bouillon  3)I had some cauliflower in the fridge that really needed to be used so I threw that in with the taters.  Personally I thought that was a great addition. Everyone agreed we should make this one again.

great recipe! though i would up adding a little extra of the cheese and carrots and celery to make it a little more hearty it still came out awesome! you really need to let it cool for a little while though to thicken up and get that creamy consistancy your going for, tasted wonderful though!

I minced the onion in my food processor and added a green bell pepper and lots of garlic, minced also.  I did not use the celery.  This was soooo good.  I will make again and again.  Real comfort food.

It turned ok for us.  The bacon didn't brown since the onion cooked faster than it.  I would cook the bacon first.  Put it to the side and add it when the onion is translucent.  I want to try it again.  I might make some changes based on other people's feedback.

This was YUMMY!  I did it a little faster so boiled the potatoes, then added them to veggies and cooked over the stove-top, but definitely planning on using crockpot next time.  Also used cubed ham instead of bacon.  We like our soup a little lumpy.  The potatoes cooked down pretty well so just used a potatoe masher on the ones that were still big.  Will definitely use this again!  Thanks for sharing!

I wouldn't add any dairy or flour until the end and even then I found that melting 1T of corn starch in hot water did a much better job thickening the soup.  The dairy will curdle otherwise and the flour doesn't mix well in the slow cooker.

I didn't think there was such thing as too much garlic.....but there was TOO much garlic! One TBSP of minced garlic is absolutely too much.   I will make it again, but will probably leave out the garlic all together!!

Nice concept, but rather bland.  I would up the seasonings and be sure to add Garlic and more red pepper.  A whole jalapeno would also be nice. (Dont cut  it up, just pierce down the legnth 4 or 5 times and put in the pot whole so you can fish out later).  I also wish the instrucitons had said to add the milk at the end, because mine curdled and look AWFUL.  I dont htink my family would have eaten it, except I managed to salvage it by pureeing half and adding some instant potato flakes to tighten the whole thing up a bunch.  Even before my salvage steps, it had a grainy consistency and wasnt particularly creamy feeling on the  tongue.  Over all disappointing. I'll try snother recipe next time.

Family loved this soup. Perfect for a cold, wet fall day. I did have to add considerable liquid to prevent it from being the consistency of mashed potatos. Was not a problem though, just eyeballed it at the end and it turned out wonderfully.  Will make again.

I LOVE potato cheese soup and this was good. I added extra milk and water at the end...it was really thick. My kids LOVE it as well. I think I might take the suggestion of using less potatoes next time, but it was great! I added a little hot sauce and some lawry's seasoning too.

This was pretty darn good.  I am more of a fan of chunked potatoes, but this wasn't bad.  I didn't put in a food processor, just used a potato masher in the crock-pot and it worked out fine.

Delicious comfort food.  Ours turned out too thick, so we added extra milk to make it soup onsistency.  It's more prep work than I usually think of for a crockpot meal, but it's worth the effort.

I didn't like this. The flavor was bland and the bacon was good at first but then it became soggy and chewy as it sat in the soup.  Won't make it again.

This is the best recipe for potato cheese soup in the crock pot so far and we have tried a few.  I do not turn my temp to high, because potatoes sometimes stick when it gets this thick.  Great with sandwiches on cold days.

Good recipe need a few changes.   I added about 4 cups more water when I added the cheese & blendered part of the potatoes.  I was also quite generous with the garlic, onion & black pepper & bacon in the recipe.  Over all quite tasty.  VERY thick soup.

What a wonderful and easy recipe. I made this on Christmas Eve for my family when they arrived, I got lots of great comments on this recipe and they even wanted the recipe which they have already made since. I served with  homemade bread and salad. Thanks for a great dinner.

DELICIOUS!  JUST LIKE THE SOUP I GET AT THE FOOD COURT IN THE MALL, ONLY I GET A LARGER BOWL, FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY AND EFFORT.  INSTEAD OF USING THE CROCK POT, I WAS PRESSED FOR TIME, I COOKED IT ON TOP OF THE STOVE.  EXCEPT FOR NEEDING TO STIR IT QUITE OFTEN, THIS IS WONDERFUL SOUP, AND HAVE MADE IT TWICE IN OWE WEEK.  MY INLAWS LOVED IT.  THANK, MICH

I scaled this recipe to 6 servings and found it to be too dry. 1 cup and 2 tablespoons of dried minced garlic is a little much. This recipe gets shredded.

Although it had a good flavor,this was very dry and came out more like potatoes with a light sauce than a soup.  I scaled the recipe down to serve 6, and maybe the amounts weren't right, but I was disappointed.

I added more liquid, but it was still too thick.  As some others said, it was more like mashed potato soup.  Also it could have used more flavoring.  I will try another recipe next time.

This is one of my go-to recipes for group dinners. Always appreciated, especially during cold weather. I keep the bacon separate so as not to offend the vegetarians, but it is on the side for those who want to add it to their individual portions.

Made it just as written and we loved it. It was a bit thick, so next time I will add some more liquid. I used my immersion blender to puree some of the soup right in the crock pot. Save another dirty appliance.

I just made this recipe. I had an abundance of red potatoes, so I used them. I peeled them just as I would have peeled russet potatoes. I'm  sure the end result was not as smooth as if I had used the russets, but the flavor was great.

This was a great base recipe, but I skipped the celery & carrots & subbed the warm water with chicken stock & about 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper. I also made 8 potato's & used 1\2 cup of flour with the onions. Topped it with crumbled bacon & cheddar cheese, served with warm buttered Italian bread. Awesome during Snowmaddeon 2016 w/ 32" of record breaking snow!

This was so thick that my blender smelled like the motor was burning. I'd add an extra cup of milk next time. I used green peppers and corn instead of carrots, celery, and onion because of our preferences. It definitely needs salt and pepper. I never add salt to recipes, but I will when I eat these leftovers.

Awesome soup!  Added dry mustard, garlic pepper & twice the liquid the original said.  I also blended it 3hrs into it being in crock pot (or when potatoes were tender)  then used a hand blender 2hrs after.  It was in the crock pot for 6hrs.  Fed it to friends along with cheese bread, they enjoyed it!  Will make it again.

I made this the other night. It was so good even my youngest(she's 2)  ate it and asked for more. I did alter it a bit-2 cups of chicken stock and blended the whole crockpot and I will definately make it again. Thanks for posting it.

This soup was more preparation than I normally do. But I followed the recipe exactly (except instead of 2 whole carrots chopped I used 8-10 baby carrots and chopped them.) There wasn't a lot of flavor, besides the potatoes and carrots. My husband thought there should have been some ham in this. Or at least more bacon. At the end I added some garlic and herb seasoning and that improved the flavor. I'm giving it 4 stars because overall it is a good recipe that I would make again.

I agree with other reviewers that the soup as written ends up way to thick, but the flavors are spot on. I added more milk at the end to improve consistency and it was perfect.

This ended up being more like a fun mashed potato recipe then a "creamy soup." My husband and I ended up eating the rest as a "mashed potato" side dish with other meals.

overall, i liked this recipe but wasn't sure in the process. the potatoes weren't getting done so i had to transfer the soup to the stove to get it done.  i followed the suggestion of adding the milk later. the soup was thick but i liked it.

This was very good!  The flavor was wonderful and as others have said, it is thick enough without pureeing any of the soup. I pureed some of the soup and it was extremely thick the next day. Great snowy weather soup.  Thanks!

Not impressed. As other reviewers have stated, this soup is *extremely* thick - to the point where I would not call it soup at all. I salvaged the meal with an addition of 2 cups stock mid-way through the cooking and still needed to finish the soup with over a cup of milk at the end.  Flavors were good, but I'll pass on making it again.

It wasn't what I expected. It tasted like mashed potatoes. I liked the bacon in there, but overall it wasn't that great. My husband didn't really like it either. We threw out all the leftovers. It was just very bland.

Perfect! Everyone loved it. No leftovers at all! Great with some warm bread on a cold day. It will make your whole house smell yummy.

I cut the recipe in half and cooked it on high. It turned out to be a bland pot of mashed potatoes. I was so dissapointed. I added quite a bit of milk and my husband thought the flavor was ok, but agreed that the texture was really dry.

I thought it was good, my husband loved it!  I followed some advice and covered the potatoe in milk.  I had to puree some of the mixture because it wasn't think enough.  Really good with sourdough bread!

This one was very thick.  I halved the recipe also.  Add more liquids and cheese is all I can suggest.  Good Luck!!

I thought this recipe would be more flavorful. It wasn't cheesy enough either. I added extra chessy and I still could barely taste it.

This soup was great! I followed the advice of adding the milk at the end, and although quite a THICK soup, it was tasty. Just remember, although this soup cooks by itself for awhile, it is heavy on the  prep at the beginning (chopping onions, celery, carrots and 5 POUNDS of of potatoes!) and some prep at the end (cooking bacon, blending a portion of the vegetable mix).

This soup was DEEE-licious!!!  A little thick, but that's not a big problem.  My husband and I just thinned it a bit in our individual bowls with milk according to our personal pereference.  I left the bacon out of the recipe, because I really didn't think it needed it ... and it didn't!  It was perfect without any meat (except, of course, the chicken soup base).  The cheddar cheese on top was the crowning finale ... that added a special ZIP! to the soup!  Wonderful!  This recipe was definitely a keeper!  Highly recommended!

Easy to make and tasted wonderful!  My husband loved it.  I did however add a little parsley and more water to make it more like a soup.
