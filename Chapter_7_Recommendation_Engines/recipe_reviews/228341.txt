I love the flavor of this chili.  The red wine adds an interesting flavor and the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce make it awesome!  And hot...but they are hard to find at the store.  When you do find them, use only part of the can (the recipe calls for 3 chilis and there are usually double that in a can) and freeze the rest in a container for your next batch of chili because you will be making this again.  I made 1 change to the recipe:  I only used 1 pound each of the Italian sausage and the ground beef.  I serve it with grated cheddar on top.
