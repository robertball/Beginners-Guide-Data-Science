These were really good and so easy to make!  I will for sure them again.  I also coulnt find the powder buffalo seasoning so I used about 1/2 cup of my favorite bottled buffalo sauce and put them in a baggie with it and shook them to spead it all over.  Then followed the directions from there.I served them with rice.

AMAZING! I made this for my husband and served it over spaghetti with just a little bit of grated parmesan and garlic bread. I did not change it or omit anything. Perfect just as is. I have an ongoing grocery list on my fridge and my husband actually got up during the meal and wrote "shrimp spaghetti" on it. Will make again. Thanks!

Soooooo good!  I made this while my husband was busy all day with home improvements.  He buzzed through the kitchen just as I was finishing up, grabbed one little shrimp on his way and I said "Wait, is it any good?"  He replied, "Hell yeah!  I mean yes!"  After he finally got a whole huge bowl he asked if there was still some left because he was going to want more the next day.  A new favorite at our house.  I made it exactly as described in the recipe except I didnt measure the lime juice or cilantro.  I just juiced 2 limes (they were'nt super juicy so it was probably about right) and chopped what looked like enough cilantro.  Served over a frozen bag of southwestern rice popped in the microwave.  So happy to have a super easy meal that tastes like so much more.

We loved this recipe. We used a Caribbean Jerk seasoning, and it was delicious. Shrimp is always a quick healthy meal, and this had a ton of flavor. I made this with the "Southwestern Rice" on Allrecipes, and a tortilla on the side. It was a wonderful dish.

This is definitely a keeper. Easy to make and just delicious! I only had cooked shrimp so I let them cooked for about 3 minutes. The lime and the cilantro at the end make it outstanding.

Wasn't sure what else to have with the shrimp, so we added some peppers and onions and turned them into fajitas.

It was okay...there was a definite powdered sauce taste. I like the Szechwan Shrimp recipe on this site much better and it's just as quick to make.

As a chef I do not use commercial herb or spice mixes but I do make a buffalo wings mix and I used that. The recipe is possibly a good beer accompaniament but I prefer to taste the shrimp. Thia is the start of spot-prawn season here and  all they need is to be alive and steamed like a lobster or a crab, in fresh chives, butter, fresh milled black pepper and white wine.

While I was reading the way this was made, I was almost about to salivate :D Anyways...  I used lemon juice with the same quantity. Will be back for more recipes like this.

Perfect as is. Was very spicy, but the cilantro and lime juice complimented the flavor of the buffalo seasoning very nicely. I think I'd even get rid of the crushed red pepper flakes, because the McCormick packet has more than enough heat. I served it with rice (flavored with chicken stock) and corn with lime juice and cilantro. Mmmmm

I made this for Father's Day lunch. It was tasty, but I was a bit surprised how "hot" it was...and both my husband and I LOVE spicy food. I think it will probably suit better as an appetizer rather than having it as an entree just because it is hard to appreciate the flavors of side dishes when your mouth is flaming. As an appetizer, especially at parties, it would an exciting bite. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh wow, this has a kick to it! But it's so delicious. I didn't change anything to the recipe at all. I served it with plain white rice. I will definitely make this again, for myself and for parties!

We thought this was good! I just happened to have a packet of the buffalo seasoning mix from...gosh, I don't know when, because I can't find it in the stores anymore. I was a tad short on the shrimp, so I also added in some bay scallops. I omitted the cilantro (not a fan), but used some parsley instead. I also thought I had a lime, but didn't, so I used a lemon with great results. We served the extra sauce over rice. If I can find the seasoning packets, I will make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor.  It was a lot of spice but nothing else came through.    I guess I would try upping the lime and cilantro to get some more flavor in there?

I love spicy/hot foods!  This was just great!  Like I said I love spicy food so I added some chiles serrano, just a few slices.  I served with white basmati rice.  It was great, I wouldn't change anything about it.

Didn't have the buffalo seasoning, so used creole seasoning instead. Used liquid Butter Buds instead of butter to cut the calories. Otherwise, followed recipe. Thought it might be too much garlic, but was not overwhelmed by garlic flavor. Had a nice bite.

Wonderful & easy!!!   I detest peeling & deveining shrimp so use big cooked shrimp from the freezer.  Thaw and add to sauce in the last 3 minutes to heat through.  Everyone loves this as an appetizer or entree.

Unwisely I used a BBQ Chicken mix that wasn't of the Buffalo kind so my flavouring didn't live up to what I expected. I think I also added too much of it..Ah well just one of those lessons. I suggest using either a trusted homemade mix or one of good store bought quality and personally I like to take the time to mince fresh garlic. I know this will be a recipe deserving a 5 star rating in my kitchen and one that I will soon try again. DadLuvs2cook - Thanks very much.

It was amazing. Substituted 3 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 5 tablespoons butter for a more healthier approach. Still turned out amazing

Decided to try something new for my contribution to the 7 fishes on Christmas Eve last year & tried this recipe. What a HUGE hit! Tripled the recipe & the shrimp was gone in minutes! People where using bread to sop up the juice! Extremely easy recipe. I am abit squeamish with raw shrimp, so took the guy at the fish counter's recommendation & used frozen...worked great! Otherwise followed the recipe to the "T". It definitely is spicy, so if you're not sure about that I'd leave out the pepper flakes. We LOVED it just as is though. Thanks for an awesome recipe share!! It made me the hit of the Christmas Eve party & will be a tradition again this year.

I made this as  main dish with rice and salad.  I used salted butter because that is all I had.  I also used slightly less than 1/4 ts red pepper flakes.

Very tasty. Probably could use slightly less butter, but it's very quick and easy to make, and tastes very good.

This was a big hit with my hubby.  He liked that it was spicy.  Using raw shrimp was really tender.  You could definitely cook more than a pound of shrimp because there is plenty of sauce.  I served it with Thai Kitchen Lemongrass rice--great combo!

1 pound isn't enough for a meal, because that's all my family wants to eat (no veggies) if you don't have red pepper flakes add a few drops of tobasco sauce, and a little red pepper for colour. If you plan on party,make a ton,they are the first to go. THANKS

So simple and good! We’re not huge spicy people so I skipped the red pepper flakes and it was plenty spicy for us. I couldn’t find the buffalo chicken mix so I ordered it on Amazon. Glad it was good because I had to buy six packages there. The only other change I may try next time is fresh garlic instead of the bottled minced stuff. I just served it with rice and it was a simple tasty dinner. Will add this to our regular rotation.

Very good, even though I didn't have cilantro.  My husband stood at the stove and ate it out of the pan.

I had to use Buffalo Sauce instead of seasoning mix, and dried cilantro instead of fresh cilantro, and the shrimp still turned out great. Easy and delicious!

It was ok.  I didn't have the buffalo wing mix so I used buffalo Shake n Bake (thought it would be about the same).  The coating all came off while cooking.  Didn't think it was really all that flavorful or spicy.  Will try again with different coating.

I would only use 1/2 of the spice.  I also only used about 3 tablespoons of the butter and it was perfect. Loved this recipe and will serve it again probably more as a warm appetizer.  Very easy.

This was okay.  Proably won't make again.  Not worth buying buffalo seasoning.
