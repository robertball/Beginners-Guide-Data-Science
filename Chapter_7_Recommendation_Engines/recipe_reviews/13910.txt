I am a vegetarian and really enjoy this dish. I have been making it for several years now. I only make minor adjustments. I usually skip the leeks and shallots and substitute with onions. Leeks and shallots are great, but I don't keep those items on hand, and they make the recipe quite costly. I do use 2 tablespoons of tamari for a little extra flavor. I also suggest extra zucchini, mostly to give the dish more contrast in colors. I like to use halved grape tomatoes. Some reviewers have mentioned that this dish does not taste like chicken. That is correct. Tempeh does not taste like a meat. It has its own texture and takes on the flavor of what it is cooked with. You have to like tempeh to enjoy this dish. It is a staple in a vegetarian's diet. One last comment. I do not see how this dish would serve 6 people as the main course, and since it has tempeh, it is a main course dish. I would say it serves 3-4 as a main dish. Maybe I just have a heartier appetite, but that is how I see it. Update: August 2014: I continue to enjoy making and eating this dish. I have found that adding mushrooms is a nice addition. I recently learned that shitake mushrooms have great health benefits, so I decided to use them in this recipe and was pleased with the results. This dish can be adjusted to your preferences in so many ways. Don't be afraid to experiment. The recipe as listed is awesome, but feel free to make it your own based on what you have on hand.

Well, I've always thought that comparing foods like tempeh and tofu to meat is somewhat insulting for the veggie soy foods.  Tempeh shouldn't be enjoyed as a meat substitute, but rather on its own merits.  With that in mind, I think that this was a really yummy dish.  It's nothing like chicken or any other meat, but it's a very good tempeh dish.  I ramped up the spice a bit, but I tend to do that on everything I make.  My husband also loves this dish; he requested that I add it to my "frequently cooked" list!

This dish made me realize I just don't like tempeh. HOWEVER, I brought it with me to my carnivorous family's Thanksgiving, just for me, I am the ONLY veggie, and at our buffet-style dinner, by the time I reached my tempeh, it was nearly gone. After dinner, all my aunts and uncles remarked what an intriguing lamb dish I'd made and how they'd really enjoyed it. So for a tempeh lover, this must be great.

Interesting dish.  I never use tempeh without seasoning it first.  Maybe this could help others.  In a bowl I put approx. 2 T. olive oil and about 4-5 T. Bragg's with some seasoning.  Use what you like.  I used some Goya Adobo and cumin, but you could use garlic powder, etc.  I then crumbled the tempeh into the bowl, mixed it up, and set it aside until it was time to add to the veggies.  This lets the seasoning permeate the tempeh and give it some much needed taste.  Like a previous reviewer said, don't overcook the veggies.  I found I didn't need to saute anything for 5 minutes before adding the next set of ingredients.  I doubled the zucchini, used an entire red pepper, and instead of sherry I used vegetable broth.  This made quite a lot and I served it with mashed potatoes for everyone and noodles for me (vegan).  It tasted really good!  I will mix the leftovers tonight with brown rice and put them in some peppers and make stuffed peppers.

Everyone loved it but based on some other reviews I tripled the Tamari and it still could use a little more flavor... I think next time I'll try some more garlic or perhaps some soy sauce.

We were somewhat disappointed with this recipe. It looked and smelled great, but didn't taste great. Without the tempeh, it probably would be good. It definitely didn't taste like baked chicken and vegetables. It probably would be better with one of the meat substitutes on the market like the Chiken Breasts from Harvest Direct.

I thought this recipe would be more of a main dish, but it works better as a side dish. It was good, just not enough for a full meal on its own. I put some bread crubms and butter on top to give it a more casserole-type crust.

I've made this recipe twice now and enjoyed it both times.  The first time I tried it I made a LOT of substitutions but found it to be a great (and forgiving recipe).  I was true to the recipe the second time with the exception of using a can of diced tomatoes rather than fresh.  While I think meat eaters would enjoy this one, I don't think anyone woul be fooled into thinking there was actually chicken in the dish (then again I haven't eaten meat in over 10 years!)

I really enjoyed this recipe, but like everybody else, thought it needed extra kick. And thats why im recommending you to put at least a teaspoon of Tabasco and Worcestor sauce in. With these extras its really nice.

Since we are newbie Vegans, this is the first time I tried a tempeh recipe. I used extra tamari, and a can of diced tomatos with roasted red pepper. No leeks. only fried up some onions. It was really very tasty! Maybe the only thing I did wrong was cut the tempeh up in small squares and should have crumbled it? Anyway, the DH liked it a lot too, so I'll definitely make it again.

Great for ease of prepartion, though I would not and did not saute for as long as she recommends, it would have made the vegetables too mushy.

I love tempeh, but it is really difficult to find it in Tokyo.  I finally got my hands on some and decided to try this recipe.  Like another reviewer, I substituted one onion for the leek and shallots.  I also used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes and Japanese eggplant instead of zucchini.  I omitted the bell pepper.  I used soy sauce instead of tamari and vegetable broth instead of sherry.  Also, I followed another reviewer and soaked the crumbled tempeh in soy sauce, olive oil, cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder before cooking and only sauteed the veggies for about a minute.  Still, this recipe was pretty great!  Will definitely make again.

This was good, but a little plain.  I liked it, my roommate (non-vegetarian) wasn't impressed.  I'll definitely eat the left-overs though and maybe try again with additional ingredients.

This recipe is fabulous!  When done correctly as Ana instructs it is truely remarkable what can be done with tempeh.  I used summer squash instead of zuchinni.  What amazed my husband and me was how sweet and tasty this comes out.  There were very few leftovers but it made wonderful leftovers over toast.  Thanks Ana, anymore Tempeh recipes that you have I will be more than happy to try!!

This was delicious.  I didn't have flavored tempeh just unflavored and I used low sodium soy sauce instead of tamari I also took others recommendation and doubled the soy sauce to 2 Tbsp.  We have been vegetarians for over 3 years but I have never tried making tempeh before and it was a great first try.

Tasty but not very filling.  Definately need some side dishes with it.
