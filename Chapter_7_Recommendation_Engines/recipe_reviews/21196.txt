Need clearer directions on folding the dough?

I think I can help.

Start by opening and unrolling the crescent roll dough.  You will have two rectangles of dough that are scored into triangles.

Place the first rectangle of dough on your cookie sheet so that it is taller than wide.  This will be the base for your yummy fillings.

Divide the second piece of dough along the scored lines to form triangles as if you were rolling them for crescent rolls.

Position the triangles along the long sides of the rectangle that serves as your base.  You will line them up with the short side of triangle slightly over the dough of the base.  The opposite angle should stick out like a baseball pennant/flag.

(To help you imagine this:  When this is done, your rectangle of dough might look like a saw with teeth coming out of each side.)

This should yield about 4-6 flags flying off the center base on each side.  Press the dough together to hold.  Line your fillings on the center base rectangle.

Now, fold each triangle into the center, pulling the dough across the filling and slightly down to meet the rectangle base on the opposite side.  Triangles on opposite sides of your base should overlap or criss-cross each other as you fold.

(Visual:  Think of how a corset's straps overlap. Or shoelaces.)

Just like a lattice pie, this will yield a crust that looks braided but is merely overlapped.

Wish I could draw you a picture but maybe this will help!  :D

Delicious and easy!  People rated this lower because they couldn't figure out how to place the crescent rolls...not because it wasn't delicious.  But her directions are very clear and not at all hard.  You don't actually 'braid' the ends, you just fold them up over the egg mixture toward the center.  Easy!  Mine was golden brown within 15 minutes, so keep a close eye on it!

Love it!  Works fine with skim milk & fat free cream cheese.  I skip the cheddar inside but sprinkle some on top a couple minutes before it comes out of the oven and let it melt. When the kids aren't around we add green onion and sweet peppers.  I have also used one crescent sheet rather than rolls.  Roll it out on your cookie sheet, put the cooked egg mix down the middle long ways.  Then make a cut in the exposed dough from the outside edge until you almost hit the eggs.  Repeat every 2 inches.  This creats flaps of dough.  Fold bottom flap up towards the center then alternate from right and left just crossing center.  Ends up looking like a braid.

I have had better. This recipe is similar to one I got from a home ec teacher. Hers had thin sliced ham, green onions and red pepper. It was very good. It was called Ham and Egg Brunch Braid. I could not follow this recipe very well as far as the placement and braiding of crescent roll dough.

This was really easy and good. My husband and toddler really liked it. :) I would add some onion or peppers..maybe a little tomato next time..sausage would be really good too I bet. The only other thing I would change is the baking time. I did it for 25 minutes and it was very close to being burnt. I will bake for the time it says on the crescent roll package next time. Thanks for the recipe! Makes enough for a crowd! Will make it again. :)

The final result was great, but I needed a little more detail in the recipe.  I was unable to follow the instructions for placement of the dough for braiding.  A picture may have helped.  More detailed instructions probably would have helped me most.  The "guinea pigs" who tested the final product were very pleased.

Easy to make and delicious! Cream cheese with eggs has always been my favorite (not enough people know about this!) so I'm glad to see it used in a recipe. One thing to keep in mind - try using frozen (or semi-frozen) crescent roll dough because mine was only refrigerated and it got super sticky and hard to work with. I must say, the instructions to do the braid at the top got me kind of confused, but I covered it all up and then made a fake criss cross pattern with the leftover dough and it looked fine. Haha. Fake it if it goes wrong! :)

Kids loved, easy to make! The only change I made was to use 4 oz of chive/onion cream cheese.

I made this for Father's Day and all my guys loved it.  I added some sauteed onion and tomato as well.  My hubbie said that he would have diced the ham.  I used a glazed ham from leftovers.  You could also easily use sausage or bacon to this as well.  I did reduce the cooking time to 14 minutes and it was a perfect golden brown.

Delightful presentation! I wish I had had batteries in my camera...): My only complaint might be that it was a bit bland, would like to add some spices next time and play with the taste. Thanks for the post!

This was a huge sucess at our Breakfast Brunch.  But I did not have cream cheese, so just cooked green pepers, onions and eggs for filling.  I also didn't have ham, so used bacon which I cooked the day before! And of course the cheddar cheese. I also used a little garlic salt! It WAS WONDERFUL AND EVERYONE ASKED FOR THE RECIPE!

THIS recipe is similar to one I have made for years...except mine does not include cream cheese, but does include a chopped broccoli/onion mix seasoned with a little garlic, and sauteed till crisp tender.  Rather than thin slices of ham, buy a thicker ham slice in the meat department and chop it up into tiny pieces - use about 2 cups.  And finally - consider other shapes.  If the braiding is unclear or too difficult, make individual servings.  One of the reasons this recipe has been around as long as it has?  It is excellent!

So as an oops, my sleepy husband didn't read the rest of the recipe after I laid out the crescent rolls and ham and pre-blended the eggs, milk and creamcheese.  Instead, he didn't cook the eggs, and poured them all over the bottom layer.  I realized what had happened and freaked out ever so slightly.  But to no avail, I dumped my cheese on top and cooked it for a few more minutes and it turned out delicious!  I then wanted to try the recipe the right way a  couple of weeks later, and truthfully, the other accidental way, was so much tastier!  The crescent was more of a souffle, the eggs were rich and fluffy and cheese- well melted cheese need not be commented on for obvious reasons.  Next time I will chop up the ham, mix it with the eggs and cover a 9x13 baking dish with the crescent rolls and do the accident again!

The family LOVED this recipe! I took other cooks' suggestions and sauteed onion and peppers then added the eggs to the skillet.   I had to read then re-read the instructions about the whole braided dough thing and this is what I came up with: *Press the crescent rolls from 1 pkg onto parchment paper lined cookie sheet to form a rectangle. *Separate and divide the crescents from the remaining pkg. Spacing half of the triangles evenly along the long side of the rectangle, press the short (& widest) edge of the triangle onto the rectangle, pointed ends extending over the sides of the pan.  *Repeat on the other side of the rectangle. *Once the egg, ham, & cheeses are placed on the rectangle, simply fold the triangle points towards the middle, creating a "braid".  I forgot to add salt to the egg mixture but between the ham, cream cheese, cheese and bread, no one noticed. I set the timer for 15 minutes and the braid was perfectly browned and ready to come out so I would definitely start checking the braid at 15 minutes. The bottom was a little underdone so next time I will use my baking stone as suggested by another reviewer! A little Tabasco sprinkled on the egg mixture before baking would be tasty for those of you craving more flavor... A super recipe to add to your Brunch recipe repertoir!

My aunt made this for brunch a few weeks ago and I've been looking for the recipe ever since.  It was delicious!  She substituted crispy bacon for the ham (and then sprinkled some more on top right before it came out of the oven--yum!) and added sliced green onions and orange bell pepper to the egg mixture.  SO good!  I also have a simialr recipe from my favorite cooking magazine that calls for thawed puff pastry dough that's been rolled out a bit, instead of crescent rolls.  I find it's easier to work with (less sticky), and it bakes up crispy and flaky.  It's worth trying.

This braid is easy and impressive.  I prepped the veggies I wanted to add the night before, but did everything else Christmas morning and it was in the oven within 20 minutes.  Sauteed some red pepper and onions first, then added the egg mixture.  Used spiral sliced ham, but also sauteed it up quickly before assembly to rid of a little moisture.  I would not omit the cream cheese.  I think it is there to help bind the eggs and to keep them moist.  This sliced beautifully and reheated well in the micro.  The braid part is not difficult.  Read the other reviews and look at the pictures.  The dough is very forgiving, which I knew in advance from making the other Pampered Chef braid recipes.  Looks beautiful every time; don't skip the egg wash at the end.

Love cresent rolls for breakfast stuff, but thinking it would be easier to put one roll in a pie pan, attatch second batch of cresents broad side down, fill, then bring pointed ends over filling and bake.  Love the idea, but guess it wouldn't be called a braid then, huh?

Very good.  Just 2 of us so I cut in half.  Wasn't pretty to look at, but very yummy! update:

I found full sheet of crescent roll and added less milk and mushrooms.  My husband LOVES this.  For 2 of us I use one sheet of dough, 3 eggs, 3 oz cream cheese, a cup chedderjack and only pepper and 2-3 tabs of milk.  with the sheet you just fold it over.  very quick

Hmmmm, This was an awesome way to use leftover ham. After reading reviews, I only added 4 green onions and 1/2 red pepper chopped. I basted the top with an egg and sprinkled sesame seeds. I served it for supper with a salad.... see my picture, this would look great on a table for brunch! 
Oh and I made two at once, my first I cooked at 375 and it was very dark after only 15 min so I cooked the second at 350 for 25 min and it turned out perfect! I posted a picture of a drawing I made for my mom of how I put it together because many seemed to have trouble with it.

This is quick & easy for sure, but hardly original.  It's been on canned crescent roll labels for years.  Try this: Use your homemade biscuit recipe, handling the dough as little as possible so that it won't get tough, and try brushing the pastry with a melted butter/dijon mustard wash before loading it with the goodies.  Add grilled onions, sub sausage crumbles or bacon for the ham, or even black olives & feta.

I was planning on having  this for guests this morning and when I opened my mail and this was the featured recipe I know it was meant to be :)  I did use sausage instead of ham and I fried up sliced onion. I did find that it didn't need the full cooking time, mine was done in 20 minutes.  So my review is pretty much Like everyone elses.  I did however fry up the sausage and the onions the day before so there was less to do this morning. Added fresh fruit as a side and this served 6 perfectly.  Will be making again..

I have been making this for about year. I make it about once a week. Never used cream cheese though. Have used bacon, sausage, turkey, swiss cheese, mexican cheese mix all as substitutes. Pillsbury also came out with the crescent roll as a sheet instead of perforated. Kids love this!

I made this as soon as I wrote down the recipe and I had cut down on the servings because its just me and my kids (hubby's @ work) I love how easy it was to make and how quick it was too! Since I had scaled down the recipe I only had to bake it for 13 minutes. I also used velveeta cheese I shredded myself. Kids and I gobbled this up! I will so make this again and again! Actually I want to run to the store and get the ingredients for the original recipe yield so I can make it for my hubby, I'm sure he'll love it!

So this was really good, the only thing i'll do diff. next time is reduce the portion.  This was a monster and way to much food for two or three people.  Excellent if you have a bigger family.  Def. going to half the recipe next time, delicious otherwise!!

This was really easy and delicious.  I knew it needed seasoning so I did my usual salt, pepper, onion salt and garlic salt and added a layer of swiss cheese on top of the sharp cheddar I used.  It was awesome and everyone loved it.  Will do this one again!

I thought this was just okay, my boyfriend didn’t like it that much. I think it is defiantly better right out of the oven, not very good warmed up.  Probably will not make again this way.

If you use parchment paper instead of lightly greasing a cookie sheet, the paper will hold the dough in place more securely, allowing you to create a  " straighter/smoother " braid.  The parchment paper can also be used to transfer the braid to a fancier serving tray if need be. Also, the bottom of your braid will not be a weird " crunchy/chewy/oily" consistency.  Plus, something that I've always experienced when using parchment paper, everything turns out beautiful, golden brown( unless your oven is on it's last leg)!!  When I make this recipe I do an egg wash on the braid and sprinkle a little bit of kosher salt on it before baking.  Ummm, um.  ;)

Very good. The texture of the cheese is great.  I added some garlic powder to the eggs.  Will be making again.  Thanks for the formula.

I tried making this and the instructions on how to make it were very hard to understand for me.  I had to look at the photos and it was easier to see what I needed to do.  Once that was figured out it was really easy to make.  I used 2 cups of egg whites to substitute and it was very good.  My husband liked it a lot.  Will make again!

This is an excellent recipe with lots of room to be creative. The other reviews helped as far as understanding how to work with the dough.  I would also recommend rolling out the bottom layer of dough a bit.  It helps to seal the seams and makes it a little thiner.  I used 10 eggs and next time I might even do 12.  I used this cut ham diced up.  I took this to a brunch today and it was a huge hit.  Everyone raved about it.  I think next time I will try other toppings such as sausage, green onion, green chile, bell pepper, etc.

I didn't have any crescent rolls, so I used some pie dough that I had in the fridge and it came out great. I added broccoli and mushrooms, diced onions and a few diced green peppers.  I will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Husband and son really liked this.  It has a lot of potential for more additions and variations.  Another reviewer was right, though, 375 might be too high, so keep an eye on it if you bake at that temp.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes and it was perfect. The temp was the only variation to the recipe I did.  I made it for dinner and served it with a tossed salad.  Next time I'm going to add a little broccoli, onion and garlic.

Pretty good.  But the bottom was still pretty doughy when the top was golden brown,  the eggs I made were gross though.  But I just had eggs in them, no water or anything else

Loved it!  I made it just as written with one minor exception: I cubed the ham and added it to the egg/cheese mixture as it cooked on the stove top. I had to make this modification because I didn't have thinly sliced ham, only a hunk of ham left over from a ham dinner. This was really, really good and I think there's lots of ways to change and adapt it to different tastes. Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful.  Made it as listed, except I chopped my ham rather than sliced.  Served with salsa on the side.  Probably very good with other ingredients such as onion and peppers that many added, but I really enjoyed the simplicity of ingredients.

I made this for breakfast this Sunday and my husband loved it. I added some Sauteed onions, and some 1/2 cooked potatoes, and some garlic salt. I also cut the ham in small pieces because it was from last nights ham dinner. I think next time will will also add some bell pepper. I am planing on fixing this for breakfast at the holidays when I have a house full. Thank you for a fast and easy great breakfast.

We both enjoyed this. I wasn't able to get all my eggs on the dough, though. I probably could've gotten away with only 6 eggs. I used part of a ham steak so I chopped the ham instead of slicing. No problems! This is a sort of a bland recipe but we don't like hot or spicy foods. This was just perfect! Thanks!

We enjoyed it but I made changes to suit our taste as from reading it I thought it would be too bland. I made two braids one with chopped ham, spring onions, mushrooms and a teaspoon of seeded mustard. The other was smoked salmon, spring onions, baby spinach and dill. Also as I'm from Australia I couldn't find the right pastry so used butter puff pastry which worked really well. I'll definitely make again with various ingredients. Thanks for a great starting point.

This does require some work.  I used diced ham and a can of sliced mushrooms, it was hit with the kids!

This is easy to make and very yummy!  I love the texture of scrambled eggs with cream cheese.  The only thing I left out was salt, as I find the crescent rolls are salt enough.

Very good. I used FF cream cheese, and added finely diced red peppers and asparagus. I forgot the cheese so I sprinkled some on top to melt about 5 minutes before removing it from the oven.

4 stars for easy preparation. Spice it up a little though... Otherwise it's a bit bland. Try your favorite sausage and pepper jack cheese! So good.

Made this Christmas morning at my parents' house.  It was so easy and delicious.  Everyone liked it.  I undercooked the eggs a bit so they would still be moist after baking.  I did find it cooked way quicker in the oven than the suggested baking time.  Keep an eye on it.  It would have been way too done.  If I have to make something for a brunch or morning baby shower again it will be this!

Made this easy recipe for breakfast on Christmas morning, however, instead of ham we used sausage. My family doesnt like "anything weird" in their food.  This is a  GREAT tasting and easy recipe!!

It was okay, not too much flavor.  Used onion/chive cream cheese as suggested as well as dicing up the ham. I think mixing the cooked eggs with the cream cheese would make it one, easier to scoop onto the ring as well as make it moister.

Very easy and good! I usually don't make stuff that uses refrigerator roll dough because I don't like it, but I have to say that refrigerator crescent rolls have come a long way since I last tried them 10 years ago. I added some chopped green onions for a little extra pep. I would definitely make this again.

This is fantastic!!!  Will add green pepper and onion next time with the egg mixture.  Don't know if the cream cheese is really necessary but I always stay true to the recipe until I've tasted it.  Thank you for sharing.

Had company this past weekend, informal, & still this was impressive!  So beautiful when complete, & so stinkin easy!  I did add small onion, chopped and sauteed along with half grn bell pepper chopped and fresh mushrooms, made sure that they cooked long enough so juices absorbed, otherwise drain to avoid dough becoming mushy,  used cheese I had on had, monterey jack, & my husband woke up the next day talkin bout yest's breakfast!  Really, this could b played with, chorizo, or all veggie could work too.  This will b kept close at hand, thanks  :)

The crescent roll dough overpowers the dish.  It would do well to use only 1 can of dough using half of it as the bottom and the other half for the braids, splitting the side rolls lengthwise. I was the only one who came close to liking this dish, everyone else left in the plate. I only used 2 ounces of ham instead of 4. I gave it only 2 stars also for the recipe being so far off as even the length of time to cook was WAY longer than the 10-12 minutes it actually takes to cook.

First time serving this in my house, I had to dive out of the way as my three children filled their plates! This is a real crowd pleaser for any family breakfast. Even the pickiest of my children couldn't say a word, because his mouth was so full with this delicious and simple meal.

This was absolutely amazing! Made it for breakfast during my child's sleepover and all of the kids couldn't get enough of it. It took me a minute to understand how to make the braid but once you start doing it, it makes sense. I was probably over thinking it. Next time I make it, I will add more veggies such as spinach, mushrooms, peppers. Great weekend breakfast/ brunch recipe. Thanks for the recipe!

Similiar to one I have made for years using pizza or bread dough.  Like the crescent rolls...much easier.  Our favorite is a reuben..layer corned beef,swiss cheese,  saurkraut, and russian  dressing.  Delicious.

Loved this recipe. Didn't change a thing to it. Just added 8oz pkg of softened crem cheese. I love cheesy dishes. However, I might have to try it with bell peppers next time for me. I like em in my food. My kids loved it as is so I'll make one for them & on for me! Thanks for this great & easy dish... Tim

Really delicious and easy. Used kroger rolls instead of Pillsbury rolls (pillsbury brand was too sweet). Also added tomatoes, peppers and onions, as well as ham and/or sausage.

Awesome dish! I did not find the instructions hard at all, rather common sense actually. I added onion and bell pepper to the eggs. Now for the super yummy part; I brushed melted butter on the"inside" of the crescent rolls and then generously sprinkled garlic powder over the butter. Shortly before the dish was done I brushed more butter on top and then sprinkled on Italian seasoning. YUM!

I followed the recipe , mostly but added sautéed onions and peppers and used slices of Colby Jack cheese. It was delicious and versatile. I may try this as a dinner  using thinly sliced rare roast beef with horseradish and cheddar cheese.

Well, I know we will like it......maybe I've been cooking too long, but just looking at the picture lets you know how to fashion the rolls, and I usually do not change a recipe the first time out, but maybe some green eggs, oops....green onion with the ham would add a taste treat!

It was pretty good but I would use bacon instead of ham and maybe a little more cheese.

Wish I had jazzed up the eggs a bit more with some tomatoes or onions.  I used cooked bulk Italian sausage in place of the ham, since that's more of our preference.  Will try again.

REALLY GOOD!!! I used egg beaters and low fat Philly cream cheese for cooking (similar to regular cream cheese but softer). I also used jumbo size crescent rolls and added bacon. The description above By laying it out to look like a rectangle with saw teeth and both sides was VERY helpful.

I used 2 1/2 Cups crumbled microwave bacon instead of ham (about 14 slices of bacon). At 25 minutes, the crescent dough was almost too brown.  Tasted very good.  Next time I will try it with puff pastry instead of crescent dough.

I added a green onion for more flavor and I diced the ham and mixed it in with the egg mixture but otherwise followed the recipe. I did halve it for 2 people and it is still enough for 4 at least. This was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this dish for breakfast this morning and we really enjoyed it. Instead of the ham since my husband doesn't care for it, I fried up a half pound of bacon and added the crumbled bacon to the egg mixture. Next time I think I will adds some sauteed onion and green peppers for an extra kick. I think my only complaint was that it was somewhat dry because of the crescent rolls.

I had thought this would be way to "bready" but it was so not. I added sausage,bacon, fried potatoes and lots more cheese. I found it very easy to "braid" You just take the first can of dough and unravel it out into a rectangle. Then the second can you open into the triangle crescent shape and you take the flat edge and line it up with the rectangle and then fold the long ends over the top of all your ingredients. We splashed hot sauce over the top and dug in. It was delicious.

Would definitely be prettier with the braid, but I ran short of time.  Just did a layer of crescent rolls, the ham, eggs & cheese, then topped with another layer of crescents, and baked in a 9x13 dish.  Was yummy!

Very yummy and VERY filling! It makes a lot for a family of 4. My husband was taking slices to work for lunch for the next couple of days. :-) Since I made it last weekend, we've been thinking up other things we could put into this breakfast braid and may try the recipe with some different ingredients.

Wow! This is amazing...simple and delicious. I did not put milk and cream cheese in the eggs, but sauteed an onion in the pan before I cooked the eggs. It was awesome and perhaps a bit healthier. I highly recommend this. It made breakfast fun.

Adding a little masala powder to the egg mixture might help spice things up a little. Go to your nearest indian store and pick up some meat masala or garam masala and sprinkle a little bit into the egg and cream cheese.

I liked the idea of this and it was fine for a last minute dinner idea.  But as other reviewers said it needed a lot more flavoring.  I thought I added enough but I didn't.  Probably won't make again.

I have been making a recipe just liek this years, and my family absolutely loves it at every brunch we have.  Great for a cool morning up north on the weekend.  I add diced red peppers and sliced green onions, it adds excellent flavor.  Also I reserve one egg white out of the 8 eggs, to brush on the top of the braid to give a nice crisp golden look.  VERY GOOD!  I would say this recipe serves about 4 adults (at least when I've made it, everyone's dug in for seconds!)

Delicious and beautiful brunch presentation. I chopped the ham so the braid would be easier to cut through. I also added some minced green onion for a little extra flavor and color.

Easy! Directions are great. My only adjustment was dicing the ham and adding to eggs as the cooked. And I used lowfat crescents.  Turned out perfectly, and all positive praises! Could easily be made vegetarian I think too.

I made this when my son and his family came for Halloween.  They are big egg eaters so thought I would give them something new.  It was a huge hit with everyone, even my 2 and 3 year old grandchildren!  We ate the leftovers the next morning.  It was worth putting it back into the oven at 300 degrees for about 10 to 15 minutes to crisp the top.  Delicious again!  I did not change anything on the recipe.  Will make this again.

Absolutely delicious.  I cut the recipe in half as breakfast for two and it still worked beautifully.  I also added a few green onions and finished it off with an egg wash before baking.  It’s almost embarrassing how easy this is, for how wonderful it turns out!  Will definitely be making this again.

My younger daughter, who is learning to cook, helped to prepare this meal. It was easy to make and looked beautiful! Very tasty too. Everyone in the family enjoyed this dish. It can easily be adapted to your tastes too.

The only change is one that is in the allrecipes magazine and in that one they added a Tble mustard under the ham before braiding and baking.  Huge amount of food. This recipe (in the magazine) is for 2 loafs  so unless you’re planning on feeding an army,  you’ll need to half everything. It was a hit though and I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty, but certainly time consuming.  I'm not sure it was that much better than just scrambling some eggs and adding ham and cheese.  Make some crescent rolls on the side.  

Next time, I will layer the ham, egg and cheese.  Maybe use chive cream cheese with the eggs instead of plain.

Note: many people are using the crescent roll dough instead of the crescent sheets.  Two different products.  That is why the directions are confusing. to some people.

I made this today for Christmas Brunch with leftover ham from last night's feast. I don't like store bought crescent rolls, so I opted to make my own dough. I made the Rapid Mix Sweet Dough found here on Alrecipes yesterday and used half of the dough for this. So, so, so good!!! I also did an extra layer of ham, eggs, and cheese to compensate for any extra doughiness. I baked it for 25 minutes and it came out perfect! 

I would recommend doing an egg-wash on the top once it's all ready for the oven, to bring out that nice golden brown.

Great recipe but the crescent roll seems to overpower the rest of the ingredients. Next time I will either use less rolls and flatten them or use more internal ingredients.

I made this dish for Mother's Day for my wife and mom. being a meat lover I added a few strips of pre cooked bacon with the ham.
The only thing I will change next time I make it, I am going to add some onion and green peppers to the eggs.

This came out really good. The use of croissant dough was a good choice because the finished product comes out flaky and lighter than if it used normal bread.  I used sliced chorizo instead of ham, and stirred browned ground Italian sausage into the egg mixture about halfway through as the egg began to firm up. One warning: this comes out gi-freaking-normous.  For a family of five, I'll cut this recipe in half next time.

Quite easy, hearty breakfast option that's versatile enough to please any family's preferences. I used chipped ham leftover from Christmas and added a package of cooked spinach between the game and eggs. Makes a large braid - after cooking, it was almost as wide as the cookie sheet, so be prepared for leftovers unless you have a crowd!

This was great! It fed our family of 5 with plenty of leftovers. We did exactly as directed. Next time, I'll add green onions, sausage, and bacon pieces to top it with the cheese.

I've been eyeing this recipe for a while now. I finally tried it today and I love it!!  I didn't have ham, so I used cooked bacon instead and it was DELICIOUS!  The truth is you can use any preferred meat in place of the suggested ham; you could also make a vegetarian choice by making this w/your preferred vegetable (mushrooms, green peppers, onions, spinach, etc.).  I've already added this recipe to my breakfast repertoire, and the next time I have overnight guests, this will definitely be on the breakfast menu.

I followed the instructions to a tee, and it came out great! Just took it out of the oven at 27 minutes instead of 30. I tried a couple pieces with salsa after it was out of the oven. I would consider adding it to the eggs before baking for a Tex-Mex taste. The kids had light syrup on top of theirs, and thought I should brush the top with syrup just before taking it out of the oven. I plan on making this at the next family brunch. I think it will be a hit!...  I tried to post my photo of the dish, but haven't been able to navigate to it. We'll see. Until then enjoy!!!

WOW, what more can I say!!  This is a great recipe and easy to fix.  I surprised the wife with it Saturday morning and she loved it.  Leftovers are easy to warm up in microwave and just as good.  Next time will try sausage in place of ham.   Thanks!

The family loved this recipe! We had it for dinner with Obrien potatoes. I used ham cubes instead and layered fresh spinach across the bottom before adding the eggs. I put some ham in the egg mixture and the rest on top. This will Definitely make our regular rotation.

I make this recipe every year for a Christmas morning brunch. It's always been a favorite in our family. I found the recipe in one of the Pampered Chef Recipe books years ago. I normally flatten out the two cresent dough rectangles horizontally over a baking sheet. Blend all perforations then flatten out next two crescent dogh rectangles directly below the first. Press together the seams. Dough will overlap the the sides of the baking sheet. But it will resemble a large rectangle placed sideways on the baking sheet. Add ingredients to center of dough and top with cheese. I add chopped green onions to egg mixture and I chop up the sliced breakfast ham steaks. I've also used the chopped ham that comes pre packaged. Then about every 1 and a half inches slice dough from outside edge towards the center of dough about two inches. Do this all the way down one side of dough then repeat down the other side of the dough. Then lift a strip on one side along with a strip of dough on the other side twist a couple of times and lay down. Repeat with each strip till all strips form a sort of a braid look down center of egg mixture. Very good. Even better when its expected only once a year.

Next time I will add cayenne pepper, top it with spicy picante and sour cream.  I'm from Ca. and most people like food spicy.

This was very quick and easy. I diced and sautéed mushrooms in extra virgin olive oil before adding the egg mixture. I also added green chilies to the eggs. Everyone loved it.

Amazing, this recipe was a big hit!! I made it for a potluck brunch so many people were asking for the recipe. It's much easier than it sounds when it comes to how to make the braid design. Just lay the 2 crescent on the baking sheet forming a rectangle and just pull the already shaped out triangles over the egg filling. So delicious, very creamy eggs this is going to be my new family recipe I shall pass down to my kids!

I usually don't take the time to write on review, on anything ever, but I've made this recipe several times and it's always a big hit. Make it on Sunday nights and slice it and we've got breakfast all week. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!

This is a wonderfully easy recipe.  I used the light version of the crescent rolls and turkey instead of ham and the taco blend cheeses and it turned out so flavourful. Will use this recipe again and again.

Easy, filling, and tasty. You can't eat too much of it because of the fat content and the greasy feel of it, but it's nice with fresh fruit on the side... Something to balance the meal.

Easy to make and very delicious!  Will use ham, bacon and/or Italian sausage when I make this, maybe a combination of all 3 meats.  Other than that, loved the recipe just like it's written!

Made this for the 1st time & my family loved it.Much to my surprize even my finiky eaters loved it. My granddaughter & grandson, ( who are my biggest finiky eaters ), said I needed to make it again. The only change was I used Egg Beaters, reduced fat cresent rolls,  fat free cream cheese. They couldn't taste the difference!

I made this for my mom when she came to visit me. It was a huge success! How could you go wrong with crescent rolls, ham, eggs and cheddar! The cream cheese made the eggs so light and fluffy! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used the crescent sheet. It was much easier to figure out the braid that way. I cut the recipe in half and only had to use one crescent sheet, I just place the sheet long ways on a cookie sheet and gathered the ingredients in the middle. I then sliced from the ingredients out, to create about 6-7 inch wide strips which i wove like a basket over top to lock everything inside! Done perfectly in 25 minutes and oh so good! I plan to make it for my boyfriend this weekend and add in some peppers, onions and mushrooms for a western style ham braid!

This was a huge hit at my house!!  Even my youngest ate some and he doesn't like anything. Because a few people had mentioned that it was a little bland, I chopped up 4 strips of bacon and sauteed it with chopped onion, then poured the eggs into this mixture and cooked them. I made two for my family of seven and it was PLENTy for leftovers tomorrow morning.

I was cooking for my son and myself only so I cut the ingredients in half and bake for 20 min. It was very easy to make and tastes great. We loved it and will make it again very soon. Superb recipe. Thanks for sharing.

II poured the egg mixture into a square skiller and let it cook almost to set.  did not have shredded chedder, so I put 2 slices of American cheese across the eggs. Then layed the ham across. I did add Nature's Seasoning and Mrs. Dash, as others commented on it being bland. Word to the wise, do NOT use American cheese. It is too runny! Stick to the harder cheeses. I will try it again, because it was yummy, nonetheless. I'm gonna have to work on the presentation. It looks like it flopped.

Everybody liked this, it was easy & so yummy. I made this exactly as written except on half I added fresh chopped chili pepper from our garden  and I baked it on a stone.  This will become a standard weekend breakfast for us.  Leftovers also kept well and warmed up nicely.  My husband started taking leftovers to eat on his morning commute to work, and I've heated helpings up for lunch at home as well.  I'll continue to try adding some veggies for variation, but it was very tasty just as is.

this was sooo good. pretty easy too. i may make scrambled eggs more often with cream cheese, yum! i took other reviewers suggestions (adding seasoning) and added minced dried onion flakes, garlic powder, and plenty of salt and pepper.  i baked this on a pizza stone as another reviewer suggested, and the bottom dough came out only slightly raw, but i was ok with it because it was cooked on the outside and just a little doughy on the inside. also, it stuck just a little bit to the pizza stone, but dont think i can oil the stone.  really really good. even FIL loved it. may become a brunch staple.  will make again and again.

Very good! It surprised us, as it's a bit similar to a quiche in its lightness. I chose to use diced ham steak, a blend of sharp cheddar and pepper jack cheeses, added a bit of garlic powder and minced onion to the egg mixture, and topped it off with some poppy seeds. I will definitely be making this again, and will probably add some peppers and mushrooms next time.

Loved this recipe!  Since making it, my family has decided that it needs to be a Christmas morning tradition.
