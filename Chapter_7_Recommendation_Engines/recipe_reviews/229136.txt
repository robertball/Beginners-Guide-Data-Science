Delicious!  I had to use white flour and butter instead of whole wheat and margarine because that is all I had on hand, but otherwise I made this dessert as directed.  I resisted the urge to add cinnamon or other spices to the topping and I am glad I did.  This crumble really lets the fruit shine and the buttery topping is the perfect compliment.   I served with whipped cream on top, but ice cream would be great as well.

I boiled the apples down with cinnamon bark and dark sugar cane. Once the apples were reduced, I stirred in a little nutmeg. For the crumble, I replaced half the flour with oats and I used  La Motte butter. I stirred it in slowly over low heat so as to not use too much - I ended up using about a quarter of a stick because I also halved the amount of crumble and baked in a loaf tin.  The kids really loved it.

I learned this recipe in a cooking class, and a few weeks later I cooked it for my family and they enjoyed it very much. It is an excellent dessert.
