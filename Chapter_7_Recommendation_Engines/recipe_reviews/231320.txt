Only 2 ingredients make for a very tasty smoothie! I'd recommend only making this if your grapes are on the sweeter side, since grapes' tartness can vary quite a bit. Mine were slightly tart so my first sip was slightly sour and kinda caught me off guard, but overall, I'd def make this again because of it's ease. The grapes didn't completely mask the kale flavor for me, but I love kale so it's not an issue.

I hate to be the first reviewer of a recipe and rate it a 3 or lower. However, I am not sure what I did wrong but my drink was bitter. All I could taste was kale and grape skins. My grapes were partially frozen, so I had to add a tad of water to get my blender to budge. I was thinking the recipe needed another sweet fruit or bananas or something similar to make it creamy. It looked so simple, I was hoping it would have worked well to incorporate more kale into the diet. I always find it a difficult green to mask in a smoothie un like spinach. I was able to doctor it up with other fruits, though, so not a waste. ty

Surprisingly good. Not overly filling, so it is better as part of a meal or snack.

I enjoyed the smoothie it just wasn't exactly as sweet as i thought it would be. That being said I added 1 cup of sliced strawberries to the mix. It is awesome!! Even my 1 year old enjoys sipping it with me.
