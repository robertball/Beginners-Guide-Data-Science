This is a good salad, but to prevent it from getting runny I always let the thin sliced cucumbers marinate in the vinegar (2 tbsp.) along with the salt and red onion for about an hour then drain it.  I add the rest of the ingredients and let it chill for another hour.

This was a delicious recipe!  I used my food processer to slice everything, I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream and added fresh dill.  My husband and son had seconds, which says it all!

This was really good.  I usually don't like cucumber salads, but I loved this one.  I added about 1/4 tsp. of sugar to the dressing and I didn't put the tomatoes in until I served it.  This prevented the dressing from getting too runny.  I also made it without the tomato and it was just as delicious!

Yum, I have been looking for this recipe. I love the creamy veggies at Dickies & have been trying to figure out what they use. This tastes just like it. I will add garlic & dill next time. Didn't have any onions so I might also add onion powder. You can really play with this one to suit your tastes.

OMG!!  This is the exact same salad my Grandma used to make. Thank you!   I could never get the amounts right and this was perfect!  However, I did make some changes due to personal taste as well as what was on hand.  
I made a Quadruple batch so I used 4 large cukes, 2 md white onions, 5 Roma tomatoes, 1 cup mayo, 4 Tbl white vinegar, 1 tsp salt, 2 tsp pepper and 1 tsp minced garlic. I highly suggest that you whisk the dressing stuff first...then pour over the veggies and carefully stir.  Otherwise it's not going to mix very well, and it absolutely must sit for AT LEAST 1-2 hours before eating, plus this is even better the next day, as the flavors then have enough time to truly blend and set, especially after the water is pulled from the tomatoes (which is what some people think is "runny", but that is actually your "dressing" so don't drain it! It has all your flavors in it!).  I must say though, you absolutely have to check/taste the cukes for wax if you buy from a grocery store.  If you can't wash all the wax off, then you must peel them completely, or your salad will be extremely bitter.

This recipe was quick, easy and tasty. I used a yellow onion instead of a red one just because I did not have any red onions. Also, I uses the Hellmann's mayo made with olive oil. I will defiantly make this again.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  It was bland, and after refrigerating for a few hours the dressing became quite runny.

I was very nervous making this because I was making it for a physician I work with who described a cucumber salad he wanted for the semi-retirement lunch we were having for him.  I used red onion as he requested and added a little sugar to the dressing so it would not be too tart.  He was thrilled and everyone else loved it as well, including my daughter who had some of the leftovers!  I should add that I sprinkled the sliced cucumbers with salt and vinegar and let it sit for an hour to draw out the water, rinsed them off them dried them between paper towels before actually making the recipe (and by "dry" I mean pressed them firmly).  I was worried the salad would be runny since I was making it the night before, but this process worked great, and the salad was crispy and not runny at all.

This was delicious!  I didn't use tomatoes, because they're not in season yet, but I can't wait to try it in a couple months with them.  I'm used to a cucumber salad with oil and vinegar, and this is a great change.

Nice refreshing summer salad... Does get watery, definetly will let the cucumbers sit in the strainer next time with a little salt.  I will use grape tomates and maybe add some shrimp when I make this again.

Oh my, just made this great summer salad. It is GREAT. I also soaked the cucumbers and onions in the vinegar and salt for an hour then drained. Then mixed all together with the rest of the ingredients. A++ salad.

I used two large cukes instead of two small. I didn't measure my salt or pepper, I just added to taste. This was refreshing and a nice light lunch for me (with a good amount leftover for snacking) when I didn't feel like I could stomach another sandwich. I think this would be good with sour cream, too. Next time, I think I might add some fresh dill weed.

Hubs said this one is a keeper.  I followed some reviewers suggestion to salt the sliced cukes (put a weight on them) for 30 minutes and drained the resulting water.  Used a portion of sour cream for part of the mayonnaise and added some dill.  Nice summer treat.

This was so good. The only thing I changed was wilting the cucumbers and using rice vinegar Want to make this again right now but no more cucumbers. Will have to wait for another cucumber to grow in our garden. Thanks

This was delicious.  I did not add tomatoes as I didn't have any on hand.  I mixed all of the ingredients except the cucumbers and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  In the last five minutes, I tossed in the cukes and served.  This ensured the cukes were very fresh and crispy.  I also  added about 1 T of fresh dill.  Really good recipe!

I thought this tasted pretty good. The main picture makes it look like the salad has a lot of mayo, but it is just very lightly coated with a dressing. I used 3 leveled Tblsp. of light mayo. For the vegetables I sliced up one unpeeled English cucumber, 2 large roma tomatoes. I used white wine vinegar and I did just sprinkle on some pepper, to taste, as I don't care much for it. I don't like when vegetables get soft from vinegar, so I ate it after it was mixed. I will definitely make this again, but probably just cut the amount of red onion in half, as I don't care too much for a lot of raw onion in salads. TY

This is a delicious cuke salad.  I did add about 1/4 tsp oregano and basil, and 1/2 tsp fresh chopped dill.  I also added 1 Tbsp 2% milk, 1 Tbsp Splenda, and 1 Tbsp light sour cream.  Whisked all the dressing together and put it with the cuke & onions into a gallon baggie.  Mixes easier and I can turn it over periodically.  I left out the tomatoes as I preferred it that way.  Very nice salad.  Thanks ShawnaRae for a nice dish.

I would tweak this somewhat.I would leave out the mayo completely and use olive oil along with the vinegar,add some oregano or basil,or both,maybe some dill weed also. Instead of a regular large tomato,I would use romas thinly sliced,or cherry tomatoes either cut in half or left whole.I would use a regular white onion or yellow or vidalia if those were all I had on hand.(I do not buy red onions very often that is why I mentioned the onion change).I would also chill this for no more than one hour before serving.Note:the vinegar breaks down the mayo and this is why it gets runny when chilled.Avoid the mayo and go with the olive oil.

This was tasty but I tweeked it a bit for our tastes. First I used 1 TBSP light mayo and 1 TBSP sour cream - the sour cream definitely gave it a good flavor that would have been lacking with only mayo. I also added in dill and a bit of celery seed. Also, next time I will not use any salt. I didn't think it needed any and felt the salt overpowered the other flavors.

I followed the recipe exactly but after letting it sit for a few hours, added just a touch more vinegar and a combo of fresh mint and dill. It's an excellent cuke salad recipe for when you don't have any sour cream on hand. Very refreshing when served ice cold. Thanks Shawna Rae! :o)

Next time I will swap the measurements for salt and pepper, as it was a little too peppery for my taste.  Otherwise, very good!

Great flavor and very refreshing.  I wish I would have peeled the cucumbers first...the peel is a little tough.  I don't mind the "runny" dressing; however, to take some of the bitterness and water out of the cucumbers, put salt on cucumber and let sit for five minutes and then drain before mixing in the rest of the ingredients.

I also added the vinegar to the cukes and onions first for an hour then drained.  I also added some Mexican chile and salt combination(Pico De Gallo) seasoning.  I always mixed mayo and miracle whip when a recipe calls for one or the other....so half and half on that.  yellow onion tastes great too.

The recipe looked promising..but no. I took one reviewer's advice and allowed the cukes and vinegar to drain after marinating for one hour. It was not soupy but too bland.

I made this last summer to take to a BBQ.  Thankfully I doubled the recipe, there may have been 2 servings left.  Very refreshing on a hot summer day.  I did  however slice the cucumber length wise and de-seeded, and sliced in chunkier pieces.  Will make again this is a keeper and SOOOO easy.

The title of this recipe is correct - "Refreshing" is a great way to describe this side dish.  Loved the taste of the garden fresh cucumbers and tomatoes.  The dressing is a little thin but it has lots of flavor.  Thanks ShawnaRae for sharing your recipe.

Our neighbors shared some of their cukes and tomatoes with us today and this salad was a perfect way to use them. I think the combo of sour cream (I used "light") and mayo is wonderful. This is a keeper.

Delicious Salad!  I didn't have tomatoes but will definitely add (especially when I can use my home-grown.) next time.  I did add a bit of dried dill and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream as another viewer did.  Had some small cucumbers I found at the grocery and don't know if that made a difference or not but this recipe is fantastic.  Thanks, ShawnaRae!

This recipe was on the menu request for my daughter's 22nd birthday get together.  It was tasty.  One reviewer suggested salting the cukes for an hour before making up the salad so the salad would not be runny.  Even after that step, the salad was saucy. Everyone enjoyed the salad, and the request was for less onions next time.

I love the simplicity of this recipe.  However, I suggest you peel the cucumbers and cube them and the tomatoes instead of slicing them.  I make sure to chop the onion finely.  I have made this into a pasta salad by adding red bell pepper, and pasta

Yes, a very refreshing salad. I made this yesterday, put it in the fridge, hubby came home and ate 90 percent of it unbeknownst to me!! I did have some this afternoon. Wished there was more.  I, too, really enjoyed it.

I used 1 small cucumber, 1/2 a pint of grape tomatoes, no onion and still used the designated amount of salt, pepper, vinegar and little extra of the mayonnaise.  Love it!

I let the cucumbers,onions and salt marinate for about 45 minutes beforehand. Make sure you drain before adding tomato and mayo. A little garlic powder and dill made this an excellent summer salad.

I loved this recipe! I took the advice of soaking the cucumbers, red onion, and salt in the vinegar, and then drain it.  It worked perfect. I used the cherry tomatoes from my garden plants and I think it worked better than a whole tomato would.  Also, I used roughly one and a half tablespoons of salad dressing and one and a half tablespoons of sour cream and it was simply delicious. Definitely one I would make again.

Exactly that, just ok.  Tasted a little bland and I added dill and other seasonings to it, tones down the harsh taste of a red onion but this would probably taste better in Italian dressing not mayonnaise based, but that would be a different recipe altogether, but perhaps add some flavor to the salad.  I wanted to really like this but next time I will be using Italian dressing instead.

This was really unique and refreshing! It's best served cold. As another reviewer suggested, I marinated the cuc+onion in the vinegar and salt for about an hour, then drained and added the other ingredients. After letting them sit together for a couple more hours, I actually transferred the veggies to another bowl for serving, leaving behind a lot of the liquid. Still had great flavor but without the runny mess!

I do half sour cream, half lite mayo and I add some dried dill and use red instead of white vinegar.  Lovely!

Surprisingly spicy and refreshing with so few ingredients. I used Jillian's suggestions: let cucumbers & onion marinate for 1 hour in 2 tbsp. vinegar, drain, then add the rest of the ingredients. Day 1 = no soggies, day 2 = somewhat runny so I drained again. To be expected given the moisture in those veggies.

This salad was great! Only change I made was I used a sweet onion. Hubby liked it and asked me to make sure I save the recipe.

Perfect side dish.  I seeded the cucumber and tomato.  Plus I added a pinch of suger and dill and used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Yummy!

Delicious.  I have made a marinated cucumber and onion salad with mostly vinegar and a little olive oil and prepared mustard for years.  This was a nice change. I did, however, use red wine vinegar this time; but white vinegar would have been fine.  This recipe goes well with spicy Indian dishes.  It's just a great side dish for whatever.  Thanks for sharing.  UPDATE:  I made this recently and added a couple tablespoons low fat sour cream.  Increased the white vinegar to 1/3 cup.  Sprinkled a little garlic powder, added 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice and a sprinkle of dry dill.  Family raved about it.

OHMIGOSH!!!  I just made this and my family hasn't tried it yet, but I know it'll go over well. My boyfriend even likes it and he's very fussy about food. I was trying to copy my Grandma's recipe (which has a very thin texture), and this is very close, but creamier, which I like better!  I doubled the batch for 8 people and added sugar to taste (as per me Grandma), probably 3 tablespoons.  Wow...thank you ShawnaRae!

The combination of the vinegar, acid from the tomatoes and the secretion of water from the salted cucumbers (salt added as part of the instructions) made the salad extremely watery, requiring several drainings during the course of its refrigeration.

Not a good way to use cucumbers!

Simple elegance.  I have been making this salad often since first reading about it here.  I am making it right now, in fact.  I usually add a little (about a Tablespoon) of sour cream to the mayonnaise.  I's fun to make because it gives me a chance to use my mandolin!

This was good...simple, light, and refreshing. It did get a bit runny, but was still tasty. I think I prefer a little sweetness to my cucumber salad, but I would make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was light and refreshing.  Being runny was the only issue I had, but we used a slotted spoon to take care of that problem.  I am going to use the recommendation of Jillian, to marinate in vinegar for an hour, then toss vinegar so that the salad is not so runny. Great salad overall, runny or not, thank you.

This is a great creamy version of cucumber salad. My mother used to make a recipe similar to this when I was a kid and loved it. Her recipe was sweeter however, so I used miracle whip instead of mayo and sprinkled just a tad of sugar on top. Very close to what I was looking for but needs some fine tuning. Thanks for this recipe. I will use it as a base for my mother's salad.

Doubled the dressing as I had a lot of cucumbers and tomatoes to use. I added 1 tbsp of sugar to the 6 tbsp of mayo, 2 tbsp of vinegar, salt and pepper. My family loved it! My husband said it's just like his gram used to make!

It is currently tomato and cucumber season, so I've been looking for new recipes to change things up. I've never made a cucumber salad like this one! I usually do plain vinegar/sugar dressings... This was amazing.  I took the other reviewers suggestion and did 1.5 tbs of sour cream/1.5 tbs of mayo.  It was fabulous.  I also thought 1/2 tsp of ground black pepper was a lot for our tastes, so I used 1/4 instead.  Lastly, I didn't have red onion in the house, so I used plain yellow onion and it was fine!

Thank you for a great recipe! Love it!

I didn't have mayo so used Miracle Whip.  Probably would be better with mayo.  I added about one-third of a green pepper that I needed to use.

my husbands aunt makes this...  she uses ms. dash..  you must season to your liking...  and we serve it over warm white rice....  its wonderful/...  i have used dill, lemon pepper and you must taste it once it sits for a bit, few hours, in the fridge...  then  more seasoning if need be.

So easy and delicious! I used Miracle Whip because I don't like real mayo and it was awesome! I too, was nearly drinking the leftover dressing. I actually dipped my roasted potatoes I was having with my meal in the sauce. So good!

Delicious..especially with garden fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. I recommend blending the dressing ingredients separately then combine with veggies. I added a teaspoon of sugar, even used "splenda" and it was still great.

Pretty simple and tasty.  I don't love uncooked onions, so I only used a little bit, and I used olive oil mayo to cut out some calories.  I often make a simple saled of sliced cucumber and tomato mixed with ranch dressing, but this was a nice variation on that.  I like the mayo/vinegar combo.

Very good and very simple, this recipe allows you to savor the individual ingredients.  Because the ingredients are things always in our garden or fridge, we've been enjoying it a lot lately.  I rarely have red onions on hand so right now I'm using vidalia onions and it still tastes great.

Very delicious!  I salted the cucumbers in a separate dish for about an hour, rinsed, patted dry.  While the cucumbers were doing their thing, I mixed the dressing (I used 1 Tbls sour cream and 2 Tbls mayo) , added some dill, poured it over the red onions and tomatoes and waited for the cucumbers to be ready.  Then added them to everything and it was yummy!

8.14.18  Total disappointment.  As suspected, the cucumbers leached their water (as cukes do), and I ended up with a soupy salad  And I found nothing at all tangy or refreshing about this; it tasted just like a watered-down mayo dressing.  I can see this has had some good reviews, but this just didn’t work for me.

My mother made this when I was little and I love it now just as much!  It is SO refreshing and a great green side dish rather than the boring standard.  LOVE this stuff!  I used a lot less sugar as I am on a low-carb diet.  I could eat "just" a big bowl of this for a meal!

Yummy recipe. I let the cucumbers and red onion marinate in vinegar and salt before draining and then adding the rest of the ingredients. I also used 1 tablespoon of ranch dressing instead of the mayo. Much better!

I suddenly have an abundance of cucumbers and tomatoes in my garden.  This was a perfect way to use them!  I served it with grilled salmon and it was really delicious.  Even my husband who claims to hate cukes liked it. Will make this again for sure!

I made this 3 times this past summer because (1) it tastes great and (2) I was using up my abundance of cucumber.  It's a great way for cucumber lovers to expand its use.

Just a few personal preference alterations. Double the tomato, half the onion, use balsamic vinegar instead of white and add a tsp sugar. And if you want a touch of sweet, add 1/2 cup raisins. Really really good.

I loved this!  It is tasty as it is.  I've tried it with mayo, miracle whip, and a combo.  All of them work. It is a keeper.

This recipe was very bland and blah. It tasted like cucumbers & tomatoes with mayo. I used Hellman's mayo, maybe it would've been better to use Miracle Whip? I guess I'll never know because I won't bother to make it again.

I loved this recipe!  I followed the advice about marinating the cucumber, onion and salt in 2 tbsp vinegar for one hour, then draining and adding the remaining ingredients - 1 tbsp olive oil mayo and 1 tbsp light sour cream.  The cucumber stayed nice and crisp, unlike other recipes I've tried. Highly recommended!

This was a good salad, the sauce was a bit runny but all in all I enjoyed it. It was really easy to make and as a college student I found that it made for a good snack or side to a meal and was very simple to make.

This is a wonderful, quick go-to salad for summer.  I drain off the cucumber and tomato so it doesn't make the mayo and vinegar dressing watered down.  This salad won't keep for more than a day, so make your serving size accordingly.  Of course, this recipe is so good, you may not have much left over anyway.  Refreshing, nutritious and cold.  Yum.

This was really yummy. I added 1 & 1/2 cup broccili, and extra tomato, and extra 1/2 of an onion to it, and doubled the sauce recipe. Really easy and healthy.

Very refreshing, I also tried it with sour cream instead of mayo.  It also worked very nicely.

If you remove the seeds from the cucumbers its less watery and the cucumbers will not "talk" back to you once eaten. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. We eat it all the time!!

I normally don't write reviews, but as I was pigging out on this before it could even get into the fridge to chill, I thought I should give credit where credit is due! :) I did add minced onion (since I'm not a fan of raw onions) and small amount of garlic powder. YUMMY!

Very refreshing! To avoid the dressing making it too runny after sitting in the fridge, to start, I only add a third of the dressing made and stir to coat. This way I see what is just the right amount, then add more if needed. Was a bit too vinegary for our taste, so I might add sugar as another reviewer did to counter the sourness.

Made the salad yesterday and it was very very good, I used 1 heaping tabelespoon mayonaisse and 1 tablespoon sour cream, also added a bit of sugar and it was just great.  Will most definately make this again and again.  Thank you so much!!

I love this salad. Make it in the afternoon and serve it very cold -- perfect for a hot summer evening! I like to use roma tomatoes, thinly sliced, for this salad.

Very tasty.  I did not use tomatoes (I don't like them) but didn't change anything else.  Great flavor!

Cool, refreshing, creamy salad that is perfect for summer. I didn't have time to marinate it but it was still delicious.

I loved it, my family not so much.  I went a little light ont he red onions as they are strong to begin with.  I will make for cook outs/potlucks just not for family dinner night.

Simple, lite and quick to put together. It was good. Nothing to wow about though. Just good.

I've tried other recipes for cucumber salad, but this one is by far the best one yet! I only make it using this recipe now. I just don't add the tomatoes because my husband doesn't like them, but even without them the recipe is delish!!

This is really good. My husband loved it. I thought it might be missing something. Maybe a little dill? I'll use this again for sure!

Having grown cucumbers this year in our garden I went hunting for a good cucumber salad. I have never made one on the past so it was a guess and by golly hunt. This was so easy and so delicious we have had it at least a half dozen times this season. Thanks Shawna for a great recipe.

This was so delicious!  I wouldn't change one thing about it.  My 3-year old gobbled it up, including the onions.  Thank you so much for this excellent recipe!!!

I submitted this recipe.  I have an idea for "watery" salad.  Try salting your cucumbers on papertowels after slicing them.  Let them sit for a while to wick away the excess moisture.  Then combine with dressing and chill. :)  Kind of the way you get rid of the bitterness from eggplant.
