This was excellent. To make sure the bottom wasn't soggy, in the morning before putting it in the oven, I flipped the bread. Used fresh blueberries. Wonderful!

I got this recipe from a friend in MOPS.  Can't go wrong with this one.  Fast and easy and always a crowd pleaser.  NOTE:  The pan MUST BE GREASED.  You can use mixed berries or blueberries;  I always prefer blueberries - less seeds.  The tartness of the blueberries balances the sweetness of the bread and we add a touch of syrup.  I also add some cinnamon to the egg/milk mixture.  I never have had it with the pecans... even though I'm sure it's delicious... just more pricey and never seem to have them on hand.  I've never had to flip the bread, however I do have to bake it longer than the recipe calls for.  Maybe as much as 45 minutes BEFORE you add the blueberries.  But all the milk/egg mixture should be cooked through.  Be patient!  :-)  I did take it out too early this xmas brunch (we were hungry and my father LOVED it still) but I put it back in for 10 more minutes and it was perfect.  It will turn out delicious if baked enough.  I think the time varies because the various bread thickness that people cut.  I like thick bread and cut it thicker, then add more eggs and milk (used eggnog for my milk for xmas breakfast), thus making it take much longer to bake.  Just give it time.  But 25 mintues is certainly not enough if you cut it thick like I do.  Might have to put a piece of tin foil lightly over the top towards the end if additional baking is necessary to keep the top from browning too much.  This recipe is hard to ruin so don't depair.

I made this with fewer pecans (didn't have enough on hand) but it was still delicious.  I think the key might be to flip the bread over before baking it to help distribute the egg mixture.  

Yum!

____
Update:

I have now made this several times following the recipe, and once I used blueberries and peaches because I didn't have enough blueberries.  We have to make it without the nuts now because my son is allergic, but each time it's delicious.  

It's definitely a must to flip over the bread before baking!

Yummy!!!  This is very good.  Easy to prepare and is now planning on taking center place on Christmas morning.  Very sweet but in a nice way...Only four stars because of the recipe...it took me awhile to figure out that 12 day old bread...is actually supposed to read 12 PIECES of day old bread.  Big difference...I kept wondering how you could possibly use 12 day old bread.

I used french toast bread that you can buy in the supermarket. Tore it up into pieces and added cubes of cream cheese. Candied walnuts instead of pecans

Good recipe! I made this to go along with out Christmas Morning bruch. It was perfect seeing as that's such a busy morning, and who want's to be stuck in the kitchen. I used homo milk because I wanted it nice and rich. My only problem is that I should have let it cook much longer! The center was quite soggy. The flavour was great though, so no one really seemed to mind all that much. I would suggest adding another 15-25 mins to the cooking time. Other then that though, great recipe. Thanx! :)

The taste was terrific; I had trouble with the consistency. It was somewhat soggy. I think I needed more bread to soak up the egg/milk mixture. I wound up baking it for 40 minutes. All in all, this was yummy, I just need to figure out how to fix the consistency!

I made this dish this morning, following the recipe exactly.  The flavor was ok, and the texture was barely palatable.  I baked it for 20 minutes longer than the recipe suggested, used less of the egg mixture with the same amount of bread, and it was very, very soggy.  On the plus side, it did look beautiful when I pulled it out of the oven.  I love pecans and blueberries, but this recipe just didn't turn out for me.

I made this for Easter Brunch. I made it with egg beaters cuz someone has high cholesterol. Cooked it an extra 10 minutes like another review said and added cinnamon to the egg/milk mixture along with the other stuff. It was very delicious. Everyone loved it. Would definitely make again.

This recipe was terrific!  I made it for my office breakfast today and it went so fast, I only got a small taste.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Not too sweet, and the combination of nuts and blueberries is really delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

I really meant to put this together last night, but quite honestly, I forgot to do it.  So this morning I assembled it and it was fine.  I made a few modifications that I'm happy about.  First of all, make sure you butter the baking pan; I used an over-sized pie pan.  Then I mixed the eggs, brown sugar, milk and vanilla and added a generous teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of blended "pumpkin pie spice" because I didn't have any nutmeg on hand.  Then I tore up the bread into bite sized pieces and tossed it with the egg mixture.  I put half of that into the pan then I layered slices of cream cheese over it ( used about 4 oz. of cream cheese) and topped that with half a pint of fresh blueberries, saving the other half of the blueberries for the top.  I put the rest of the bread/egg mix on top of the berries and smoothed it out a bit.  I then put the pecans on top (which I didn't chop) and spooned the brown sugar butter/ mix over everything.  After a half hour in the oven, I scattered the other half of the pint of fresh blueberries over the top and finished it in the oven for the last ten minutes.  It was beautifully browned, puffed and photo worthy. And the taste  .... oh, it was wonderful.  Try it.  It's a great weekend or holiday breakfast.

Tasty and pretty – how can you beat it?  I love the crunch of the pecans with the softness of the French toast.  Because it is just my husband and I, I halved everything, using three eggs.  I also added a ½ teaspoon of cinnamon and used light cream instead of the milk – just a personal preference. I didn’t have the problem of it being soggy as mentioned by other reviewers, but I had cubed the bread (cut off the hard crust) and laid the cubes out to dry before adding the egg mixture.  I didn’t need to flip the bread, I gently pushed the cubes into the egg mixture to soak it up.  I zapped the butter and remaining brown sugar in the microwave for 30 seconds just to caramelize the mixture before drizzling.  Serve with a little warm maple syrup – a yummy breakfast.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! I used "Texas Toast" and toasted  the 12 bread pieces at 200 in the oven until they were crispy to get the bread extra dry and help absorb the egg mixture. I coated the bread, let it sit over night and flipped the bread in the morning before baking. No problems with sogginess!

I'm making this for a Christmas Holiday breakfast at work.  Changing the blueberries to cranberries and the spice from nutmeg to cinnamon and cloves.  If you butter the bread with cinnamon butter and toast it first, it doesn't get as soggy either.

Fantastic recipe, thank you!  I made this for family that was visiting & everyone loved it.  It wasn't soggy at all but I used a big loaf of italian bread, cut it thick & then flipped each piece before cooking to soak up remaining egg mixture.  Thanks again!

I've made this twice already and we love it. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added cinnamon to the mixture. Also, before baking, I flipped it over in the pan so that the bottom didn't turn out soggy. It's a fun weekend breakfast staple for us now.

I made this today for my family brunch and it was the first thing gone! I only added some cinnamon to the wet mixture, otherwise I followed the recipe. It took longer to cook than stated but I may have not used enough bread. I will be making this again and again. Thank you!

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast and it came out perfectly. Here are the changes I made to avoid the soggy issue that others mentioned. First I used a day old baguette. I ripped it into pieces about 2 inches big and layed them into the bottom of the greased casserold dish. I pressed them down a bit with a potato masher. I used one cup non fat milk and one cup half and half (Instead of 2.5 cups milk) and then proceeded with the rest of the ingredients as written. I added one bag of frozen organic blueberries to the top and refrigerated overnight. It baked for 35 minutes, sat for 5 and was PERFECT!

Pretty good flavor, but I added cinnamon and more eggs and reduced the milk.  I've made similar bakes before and that much milk with so few eggs is why people are having issues with it being soupy.  I used fresh blueberries and raspberries on top.

Delicious!  I did flip my bread b/f baking it and I increased the baking time by about 15 minutes.  It still could have been more done in the middle of the pan.  I added some cinnamon to the egg mixture.  Will try it again and try to drain any egg mixture that I can in the morning b/f baking it.  Also, used frozen berries, but that just increases the moisture problem, so I will use fresh berries next time.  I used 1/2 cup pecans which was a good amount.  The pecans had a lot to this recipe!  I did make one mistake, I forgot to add the melted butter and brown sugar for baking it.  I'm sure it would have made it even better.

These are the changes I make: 
1. I add cinnamon.

2. I dry the bread in the oven the day before for several hours at 150 degrees.

3. I've found that the top burns at 400 degrees, so I cook it at 350 degrees and use a temperature probe with an alarm set to 170 degrees, then kick the oven up to 400 to brown the top and reset the temp alarm for 190 (which is the temp at which most custards set).

I LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe.  It was so very easy.  I did two things differently because a) I misunderstood the recipe and b) didn't have nutmeg.  I bought 2 small loaves of french bread and then just tore it up into large bite-size pieces to make a "casserole" type dish.  Then I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  After I poured the the egg/milk mixture over the bread, I gently tossed it all then let it rest overnight.  I didn't find mine to be be soggy at all.  It was perfect!

Made this for today's Christmas morning breakfast and it was a hit! This is deff something that I will make again -also a recipe that leaves alot of room to add/experiment with. I didnt have nuts or fruit to work with so to hearty up the dish I added old fashioned oats in the bread mix and added the oats to the drizzle topping. This added a nice texture!  This is one to have fun with.

This was gorgeous and yummy.  I used the frozen berry medley of raspberries, blackberries, and blue berries.  It also reheats well.  I had some leftovers and my husband enjoyed it a second time!

I made this for Christmas 2009.  Wow it was so good.  It's really sweet but it is so pretty when it's done.  It was a hit.  It smelled so good when it came out of the oven.

This was very tasty.  I loved the fresh blueberries on top.  I didn't have pecans so just left them out.  Mine was way to soggy, but I think because I only had regular bread.  I did add a little cinnamon.  This was sweet and I didn't even need to add maple syrup!  I will try this again but using the right bread to see if it isn't as mushy!

I feel this is more of a bread pudding type of dish, rather than french toast.  I thought this was really tasty, though.  I took some of the other reviewers advice, and actually used half heavy whipping cream, half milk to make my "half & half" in place of straight milk.  I also added two more eggs for a total of 7, and a little more milk.  I didn't have 12 day old french bread on hand, so used up bits and pieces of other breads I had around, including some hawaiian sweet bread, hot dog buns, biscuits, etc.  And I did add cinnamon to the mix as well.  Also flipped it in the morning before baking.  This turned out perfect, and I didn't have to cook it longer than stated.  The blueberries were cooked just enough to sort of burst in your mouth as you took a bite.  I would probably double the topping next time, as I felt it gave it a nice sweetness.  Really a delicious dish, and I believe my Sunday School class liked it too!  Because of my additions and the non-french toast consistency, I give it 4 starts.  It's a keeper for us, and one that will be extra special on our table.  Thanks for a great addition to the recipe box!

Made this for a family brunch and it was well received.  Accidently bought walnuts instead of pecans, but still good.  Used fresh blueberries, but I think next time I will use frozen for a little more added sweetness.

3 stars without changes, 4 stars with changes.  I made this three times and finally "got it right" on the third try.  First, I disagree with the suggestion to use French bread.  Use either Brioche or Challah - both are richer.  Secondly, I cut the bread in half, lengthwise.  It fits in the casserole neatly and looks better when finished.  It is VERY important to "flip" the bread a couple of times before baking it.  What worked best for me is to pour it up, let it set for an hour and then flip it/rotate it.  The next morning, before I pop it into the oven, I give it one final flip.  Lastly, baking at 400 is WAAAY too hot.  Back it down to 375 and turn it up to 400 for the last 10 minutes for the blueberry portion only (if you want).

Not so good. I flipped the bread like suggested and used less liquid ingredient. It was still incredibly soggy. The flavor was good, but even my husband who eats whatever I make said it wasn't very good. I don't plan to make it again.

I used regular old sliced bread and just tore it into bite size pieces.  I cut the milk down by 1/2 cup and added the blueberries right in. I cooked it at 350 for the first 30 minutes and pushed it up to 400 for the next 10 and it was perfect.  Let is set about 15 before eating.  Very Yummy and easy.  Will be making again soon!

I really like this.  I didn't use nuts and halved the recipe.  Followed the directions and then in the morning flipped the bread slices over and drained off the extra mixture in the pan.  This made a moist french toeast bake and not soggy at all.  I wasn't a big fan of baked french toast due to it being too soggy and eggy.  But, I think the key is to drain off the excess in the morning.  I did also really like the blueberries being added.  Overall, I liked this recipe.

This recipe was made for my baby shower...everyone went gaga over it.  I've since made it for school pot lucks, etc. and everyone wants the recipe every time.  Nice to make for a holiday too, since it's prepped the night before and baked in the morning.  KEY TIP THOUGH:  Flip it into a new pan the morning of baking so the wet stuff is on top...that way it won't dry out..  and serve with maple syrup.  amazing!

This is a great breakfast dish that even my fussy family loves!  Just a few minor changes made it even more tasty - instead of 2 1/2 cups milk I used 2 cups milk & 1/2 cup French Vanilla coffee creamer.  Also add 1 package of softened cream cheese to the mixture before pouring overtop of the bread.  In the morning, be sure to flip the bread over prior to baking to ensure that all of the egg mixture is absorbed.  I love to top this with raspberries, blueberries, & blackberries.  Delicious!!

I followed the recipe totally.  Just as others noted, it puffed beautifully, then fell. Bland,, even the biggest eater at our July brunch left it on his plate. Not worth it.

So good! I used more bread than called for (on accident) and it puffed up pretty good while baking, but all of the liquid was absorbed and it wasn't soggy at all. It deflated when it cooled. (I did let it cook longer than specified as well.) Makes a beauiful presentation for company.

I have been meaning to try an overnight french toast for a while now, and this was perfect! In my opinion, the amount of bread used will determine if it is soggy.  I used a loaf of Challah bread, and I had to use two pans to accommodate the bread.  The bread was saturated with the egg mixture, but most of the liquid was absorbed into the bread.  If you have a lot of excess liquid in the pan, you probably need more bread. I did flip the bread before baking.   I covered it with foil while baking, so that I could bake it longer if I needed to without burning it.  The bread puffed up in the oven beautifully, and it was delicious. The blueberries and pecans make it extra special.  The only change I might make next time is to reduce the sugar a bit, though this could be because the bread I used was sweet.

I made this for New's Years Day brunch.  I followed the recipe to a tee and it was outstanding.  My company just kept getting more and more until it was finished.  Because of the many reviews with consistency problems, I was a bit concerned.  However, I have come to the conclusion that it is all in the type of bread you choose to make it with. Mine was a crusty french bread and it was almost perfect, a tad dry on the outer edges.  I think next time I will use a softer crust bread and cut it into pieces to promote even soaking of the liquid.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

YUMMY!  I cut my french bread into slices and let them get stale over night, poured the egg mixture over the bread (turning the bread once) the morning of, put in the refrigerator only 2 hours, took it out for a 1/2 hour before cooking...made the texture and consistency just right, not at all soggy.  Served with maple syrup...sooooooo good!  The whole house smelled delicious while it was baking too!

If you are going to make this read this review.  I tested this recipe before making it for an event.  Here is what I found: I bought artisans bread and left it out for 3 days uncovered.  When I make the recipe I added an 1/8 c of brown sugar to the main recipe, I also added the same amount of cinnamon as the nutmeg that is listed in the recipe.  I tested out cubing the bread vs. tearing the bread and both came out the same.  AND I ended up cooking it for 50 minutes instead.  Oh - to save a step I threw in frozen berries at the beginning instead of making this a two step process. The result?  Well a 5 year old said - YUMMY and i was told I should open a restaurant- all in all I think these changes worked out VERY well.  One more thing- when I took the pan out in the morning I turned the bread so the egg was also on top and it did not come out soggy at all.

This is Wonderful!! I followed it pretty close (which I try to do with recipes so I can give it a correct rating) I did cube 2 day old french bread and flipped it in the morning. This was so so good I served it Easter morning and would not change a thing. I will be making this many more times. THANK YOU!!

The taste was pretty good, but the temperature was WAY too high, at least for our oven.  I made two pans.  I flipped the soggy bread bits in one, and left them alone in the other.  They came out exactly the same, except the non-flipped one was prettier (it's hard to neatly flip soggy bread bits).

I lightened this up with skim milk, egg beaters, and fat free cream- and it still tasted so decadent! Made it for Easter and everyone raved. So good.

I read a lot of reviews before I made this.  I doubled the recipe.   I decided to use half-n-half instead of milk but when I doubled it, I only used 4 cups instead of 5.  Also, I bought non-sliced cinnamon bread, in place of the french bread, at the store bakery (I had to pre-order so they wouldn't slice it) so that I could cut the pieces thicker than normal.  I accidently used all of the brown sugar in the egg mix (2 cups doubled) and then realized the next morning that I still needed another 1/2 cup with the melted butter drizzle, which ended up being fine.  I cooked it at 400 since I had more than one dish in the oven.  My husband says it's more of a bread pudding texture, but it was so good and such a hit.  I thought it tasted like a pecan roll.  No syrup needed.  The blueberries were great texture.  (I only used 3 cups of those, but couldn've used more, doubled should've been 4 cups).  I flipped the bread before I baked it. It was not soggy and I didn't need to bake it longer than the 35 minutes.   We had 10 people and there were two pieces left.  Everybody loved it!

It was tasty, but, the bottom was soggy even though I used twice as much bread as the recipe called for and flipped the bread over in the pan before baking in the morning.  It took longer to bake thoroughly than the recipe stated.

Made it for Christmas breakfast and it was delicious. Like others I drained most of excess egg in the morning and added a little cinnamon to egg. I also added a couple extra slices of bread on top.  Instead of 1 cup of pecans, i halved it and added 1/2 cup low fat vanilla granola which added a great crunch! Can't wait to make again.

I made this recipe and brought it to the company potluck.  There was nothing left when I went to get my pan and many people told me how good it was.  I didn't have time to soak the bread overnight so I just threw it all together and baked it.  I did add an extra egg because the recipe doesn't say how much bread to use and I used a whole loaf of Pepperidge Farm white bread.  This really did taste delicious and it had the consistency of bread pudding.  Thank you for a great recipe Melissa!

This tasted very good but I agree with some others.  It turned out very soggy even after cooking it for about an hour.  I would increase the bread and decrease the egg mixture.  Otherwise very tasty.

Yummy!  A delicious casserole and so easy to assemble!  I made mine the night before I baked it and felt the bread got just a little too soggy for my liking, but otherwise it tasted great!

Fixed this dish for the morning before a big event.  The reviews were good.  The amount of egg mixture seemed to high for the amount of bread and I had eggs on the bottom in spots with soggy bread in some places.  Really not a good dish for me.

Delicious!  I actually layered the bed in a few spots (used 2 pieces of top of each other) and also used end pieces to avoid it getting too soggy and it absolutely worked and was delicious!

GLUTEN FREE DAIRY FREE OPTION ...Excellent.  used gluten free cinnamon bagels, dairy free butter and Almond milk.
I didn't have time to leave it overnight, but it was wonderful baked the same morning.  I actually cooked the blueberries in it for the full time accidentally and they came out plump and delicious.  I've made this twice now with requests for more..

Having been asked to make the breakfasts for a long-weekend 50th wedding anniversary celebration, I decided to test this recipe.  Very glad I decided to try it before serving it at the event!
The texture was that of a quiche with pieces of bread in it.  It could be called a sort of sweet egg dish.  Really rich.  Hot from the oven, it was not good at all.  I did think it was better when I tried a bite later in the morning when it had cooled completely, but I won't be serving this at the anniversary.

I have a similar recipe that calls for cutting the bread into small squares so that's what I did for this.  I used 1 cup of french vanilla flavored coffee creamer and 1 3/4 cup of skim milk, because the creamer is so thick. I didn't add the nutmeg or vanilla because of the strong flavor of the creamer.  I flipped/tossed the bread before baking and didn't have any trouble with sogginess.  My Sunday school class loved it and said I could feel free to make it again.

I made so many changes I'm not sure exactly how I should rate it.  To rate it according to how mine turned out with my substitutions would give it poor rating.
I didn't have french bread.  Used Oat bread instead.  Didn't have pecans or blueberries so I didn't add them.  I didn't add quite as much liquid  and I haven't a clue how long I left it in the oven.  
All in all, it turned out alright.  Not the best.  But still eatable.  I think it would be just as easy to make regular french toast as it is to make this - of course, if you don't have time to stand over the stove then this would be the better option.  Having the correct ingredients would help too.

I used regular grain bread (I dried it out in the oven).  I had no nutmeg, so I used cinnamon.  I also had no pecans, so I used walnuts.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup in the milk and egg mixture.  So, with all that said, it was excellent.  Definitely, it is a repeat recipe.

This looks gourmet, tasted delicious, and oh so easy to prepare.  Rave reviews from all.  I used Oroweat Texas Toast instead of French Bread, 2 pans: a 13x9x2 & 8x8 sq. & 6 eggs.  Also baked it for 35 minutes & served the blueberries on the side so people could choose syrup or fruit.  All chose the blueberries!  I will definitely make this again--everyone wowed over this one.

Excellent choice!  Instead of 10-12 day old bread... I used fresh bread and toasted it in the oven on low for 1-2 hours (to make it hard).  I also opted to use cranberry orange bread instead of plain and then topped with powdered sugar instead of blueberries.

It was good but maybe more for brunch than breakfast, it's pretty sweet.  I ripped the bread into chunks instead of slices as some had suggested and it didn't require any extra baking time.

Made this for work and didn't even get to try it.  The reason for the 5-star rating was the e-mail that went out later that day trying to track down the person with this recipe.

Great for those of us with a sweet tooth!  I made this with sourdough bread (one of the listed options) and it was great.  I followed the suggestion by other reviewers to flip the bread in the morning before baking.  I also followed the suggestion of some reviewers to cook a bit longer.  I cooked an extra 10 minutes before adding the blueberries and an 5 minutes after adding them.  It was very moist in the middle, but not as soggy as some reviewers who had not added extra cook time indicated theirs came out.    This is definitely one that we will make again!

I had a loaf of whole wheat bread that I needed to use up so I thought I would try this recipe. Unfortunately, I didn't have blueberries or pecans so I just followed the recipe up until the addition of the topping, which I left off. I thought it tasted good, I'm sure it is even better with the topping!

I was not very fond of it, thought it was a little too mushy and not sweet enough (though syrup helped this); however, many others at the party enjoyed it and stated it was their fav dish at the brunch. I made it with torn up slices of French bread (since it was not an older loaf, I toasted each slice), added cinnamon in the egg mix and topped with frozen mixed berries (which everyone seemed to like). It also looked quite pretty.

Made this recipe exactly and it was great! My bread was only a couple of days old and not left out to dry or anything. I assembled it first thing in the morning and put it in to bake at dinner time. I used frozen blueberries and chopped pecans. Serve with turkey bacon or sausage patties and a splash of warm maple syrup and it's a crowd pleaser. I found adding the melted butter browned it nicely and added a nice butter flavor.

WOW... best breakfast casserole EVER!  I used bread that was nice and stale and the texture was perfect when finished baking. The pecans are a great touch.

Used french bread (1 day old) and a few hamburger buns because I ran out of other.  Added fresh fruit (rasberries and blackberries) last 10 min.  Turned out great.  Also made the overnight french toast and others liked the "praline" sauce on top of this as well.

Used frozen blueberries and added at the start of cooking time and that seemed fine, and one less step!  Used "artisan" bread with a heavy crust.  Finished product was not mushy at all.  It was 2-day old and I let it sit on the counter with no wrap for that time.  I did stir/flip bread in the morning.  I did not find it overly sweet and we did use syrup.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  It wasn't too sweet, and the texture & flavor were perfect.  My bread wasn't stale so I toasted it first (this will help to keep it from getting soggy if it's not stale).  It was a very easy dish to prepare and it turned out so beautiful, great for serving to company!  Next time I think I'll add some peaches, and I think any kind of pie fruit would be great on this (apples, cherries, etc.).  Thanks!

I've served this twice now for large family gatherings.  The first time was for Christmas brunch - I omitted the blueberries and pecans, and instead made a cranberry reduction that we drizzled on top after baking with some pecans thrown on top.  The second time was for my grandmother's 80th birthday party - I actually had a specific request for it to be served again - that time I made a raspberry and strawberry reduction with some sliced almonds.  The reductions were very simple - about 16oz of fresh fruit, about 1 1/2c of fruit juice that would taste good with the fruit, and then sugar to taste, simmering on the stove for about 45 minutes (basically the time it takes to cook the french toast).

This recipe was great.  Easy to make and its flavors were nicely balanced.  It was not too sweet and texture was similar to bread pudding.  The tart blueberries, savory pecans, and slightly sweet brown sugar drizzle complimented each other nicely!

I altered the recipe in process, but not ingredients.  I used store-bought sliced french bread and was worried it was too soft.  I put it in the oven at low until it was definitely dry.  I used the entire package (1 lb) and it ended up being three layers deep.  Before placing in the oven I rearranged the layers (the botttom was very wet and the top seemed too dry) and flipped the bread as well, to even out the egg mixture.

I baked according to the orginal recipe directions and it was delish!  Will make again.

This is seriously the best french toast recipe I've ever had. I think, after reading all the reviews, that people who got a soggy result didn't use enough bread. While at the bakery, I noticed that there were two distinct sizes of french bread loaves. I used the extra large one and the recipe was perfect. This was amazing and everyone scarfed it up quickly. Try it, you won't be sorry.

I never could get the consistency to work out. It was really soggy in the middle even though I baked it an extra 25 or 30 minutes. I think I could have baked it all night and it would still be soggy. I don't think I will attempt this recipe again. It wasted so much time and was a flop.

This recipe was top-notch!  i wrote it down in my favorite recipe book. the page will definitely get dirty, haha.

I made a half recipe to test on my family.  This was pretty good, but very, very sweet.  I think I would like it next time with less (or even no) brown sugar, and a drizzle of maple syrup on top when serving.  I also added some cinnamon and that made it more french toast-like for me.  I had to increase baking time by about 15 minutes or so.  I'll make this again but tweak to suit our tastes.  Great idea for a somewhat different brunch buffet item!  I will be referring to this recipe often - thanks for sharing!

i agree with another reviewer, it was a little too soggy for me. i might use less milk in the egg mixture next time if that would do anything. or i might prepare it in the morning when i bake it so the bread doesn't get as soggy.

I made this for the first time for a family brunch After reading the reviews I used 8 jumbo eggs with the milk, added a Tbsp of cinnamon for added flavor It takes longer than 25 minutes to bake I baked for 40 minutes then put the blueberries on for the final 10 min. It was perfect, not soggy but tender and done.  I can see why the 5 egg and 2-1/2 c milk would make it soggy. My family loved it. It make brunch a little fancier!

I have made the other recipe for baked French Toast with Peaches and it has always been wonderful.  Decided to try this one for Christmas breakfast.  I did not have blueberries on hand so used raisins as others did.  No flavor, and soggy bread.  I also cooked it for much longer than it said and it was still wet (almost an hour). What probably would work is to cut the liquid in half.  Perhaps that would save this.

This was wonderful, as all I had to do was bake it in the morning. I added golden raisins after taking it out of the oven, and drizzled it with real maple syrup...really yummy!

This did not work for me at all!  The taste was ok, but after 45 minutes in the oven it was still super soggy, yet the top was starting to burn.  Don't think I will be trying this one again.

This was a very easy casserole to make and it was just delicious.  It did not bake in the time indicated because I did not let it come back to room temperature first.  However, since I have a convection combination I added it during the last ten minutes and it was fine.  It just needs a bit more time in the oven.

We made this for mother's day today.  It looked beautiful and had really good flavor, but it was soft & mushy in the middle and bottom.

Like others said, this was just too soggy, even with additional bake time. The flavor was good, so I'm giving it some stars for that...but it was just too soggy and if I had continued to bake it any longer it would have burnt on the bottom. I had also done as recommended by others and flipped the pieces in the morning, no luck. So, my thought is that there is simply too much milk in the recipe. The egg would set up, the milk would be the cause of sogginess. So, I will give this one more shot with less milk.

I think this recipe is great but as others had mentioned, it was a little moist. I might try adding a little less milk next time and recommend letting it sit for a few minutes after pulling it out of the oven. It helped to solidify everything together. I also added bananas and strawberries on top instead of blueberries and thought it was great!

I pulled my bread apart as another review suggested, it really worked well.  Also, I assembled and baked immediately..again, fine.
The center didn't quite finish baking before the top was getting a little crusty...but this was a delicious recipe.

This recipe was great.  I've tried several variations of it, but this is by far my favorite.  I think the difference was pouring the butter/sugar mixture over the top.  Delicious!  Next time I may put a few blobs of cream cheese in too for a little extra fun.

Great flavor, not too sweet, not too dull.  Took the suggestion of others and added a splash of cinnamon and flipped the bread just before baking.  Baked it longer than suggested and it turned out great, lots of compliments at our work breakfast.

Used a little less sugar (3/4 c) because we were having it along with cinnamon rolls and doubled the blueberries.  It was great.

As I put the bread that had been soaking overnight into the oven I was worried about how this would come out, but I couldn't have asked for better results. Mine took quite a bit longer than the time indicted in the recipe but I think that was a combination of the oven I was using and the fact that I tripled the recipe for a large group. The top was nice and crispy and the bottom was soft and gooey. I served with maple syrup and everyone loved it.

I made this for the first time for guests. I neglected to read thoroughly, and three hours before they arrived, I realized that it should have been made 8 hrs prior... Followed the directions exactly otherwise. Besides being very sweet, it turned out perfectly in the exact amount of time. I know many other reviews said they cooked for longer. I think it has something to do with the correct amount of bread to soak up the liquid. It is not exactly clear... and I think I happened on it with my own judgement. Will try again with less sugar.

Delicious!  Made as is, except I didn't use any nuts because of family allergies......it was PERFECT!  I like that it's easily prepared in the morning.  I used fresh blueberries and they were so plump after baking, it looked beautiful!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast and my family all LOVED it!  I used a store bought cinnamon swirl bread and it tasted fabulous!  We topped it with some fresh whipped cream which made it taste really rich.  I baked this as directed until the knife came out clean, which took about 45 minutes.  This has been voted as the new Christmas morning breakfast from now on!

After trying French bread (crust too hard) tried again with 15 oz. Challah bread.  Left bread out for day or two, then sliced it and left it out for a few hours to dry out.  Cut into large cubes and placed into sprayed 15 x 10 baking dish.  Turned over pieces next morning before baking.  Followed times as suggested.  Left out pecans and used Dole frozen mixed berries.  Came out excellent!

I made this for Christmas morning's post-present food fest, and my family absolutely loved it.  The only changes I made to the recipe out of necessity: I used twice as much butter & brown sugar at the end where you drizzle it on top before you bake it.  The amount I made initially just didn't seem like enough.  I also only had 1/2 cup of pecans left from previous recipes, and my husband said it was the perfect amount.  Other than that, it was very filling and delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

Exelent recipe!
I cubed the french bread - it is easier to serve and it soaks the egg mixture up better. I did add more eggs than the recipe called for - 9 in all. I also used 1 can of evaporated milk + skim milk to equal 1 1/4 cup. Added 1 tsp. cinnamon and cut nutmeg to 1/8 tsp. I baked it at 350 rather than 400 - gives the egg mixture more time to set up without burning the top. No problems with a soggy center. Not sure how long I baked it - I kept checking the center till it looked done.

I read A LOT of the suggestions from other reviews so I knew what I was getting into.  I prepared everything the night before and I did use less milk than what was suggested, I also used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon swirl bread.  I cut down on the sugar by about 1/2 and used a mixture of light brown sugar and regular white sugar.  I used frozen (thawed) blueberries which were just fine with chopped pecans, you wouldn't even know they were frozen.  The flavor of the blueberries was perfect paired with the sweetness.  I gave the recipe a 3 because because I still ended up with a soggy center and crispy edges even with an extra 10 minutes of cooking time.  Had I left it in any longer the edges would have burnt not to mention we would have all been starving :)  I would love to give the recipe more stars because the flavor was very good but I don't want have to work that hard to figure out the right measurements by trial and error over and over again.  Chances are I will try this recipe again with some different measurements.  Oh Yea,  DO NOT forget to grease the pan, Trust me, I speak from experience.  :)

This recipe was great and a great make ahead for a nice hot meal in the morning.  Mine took a little longer to cook through in the center, but it was worth it.  Loved the little crunch of the pecans.  I served it with blueberry syrup and Cool Whip and it was a big hit at my ladies Bible study!

After reading the other reviews, I cut up the bread into cubes less than an  3/4 inch in size.  I was running low on milk and read how soggy it seemed to turn out for some, so I did use less milk (1 cup less) and there was no problem with it cooking through or being soggy.  My oven has both convention and non-convection baking.  I used convection and the edges turned out a little crunchy.  So if you want it softer I recommend the non-convection baking option.  If you like it a little crispy or crunchy on top then select convection bake.  Flavor on recipe was excellent enough to serve without any kind of syrup or other topping.  I had the maple syrup out and ready to go but no one used it.

This was very easy to make and convenient because I made it a day ahead of time.  Next time I make this I think I'll omit the blueberries, just a personal preference.  I really loved this!

I have been making this for years and it  is a big hit every time. Everyone wants the recipe!  I don't use pecans and try to cut back on the sugar. Delicious!!

This has become a staple for holiday breakfasts. I tear the  bread into pieces and press it into the egg mixture with the back of a spoon.  I give it another little smush in the morning, before I add the topping. I also put the blueberries on before I put it in the oven so they cook and pop a little.

I have made this numerous times, always to rave reviews.  Flipping the bread and cooking longer than the recipe suggests is the key to a good consistence for the whole dish.

I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and left out the fruit until  I served it and then used macerated strawberries ( my granddaughter's favorite and easily available).  I agree that 30 minutes is short to bake a custard (which is what this is) so I cooked longer as well.  The result was wonderful.  We added a decadent touch of whipped cream and enjoyed a lovely family breakfast on Christmas eve morning.

This is a delicious dishl!!! My parents were coming and we made it that morning (without refrigerating overnight). We used vanilla soy milk and regular bread because that is what we had on hand. It turned out fabulous! My parents raved and requested the recipe!!

I added 1/3 cup of sweetened coconut to the mixture before refrigerating and used some blueberry jam for the topping instead of the butter/sugar topping, and in the end had the kids repeatedly asking when I'll be making it next!

I used oatmeal bread instead of french, and didn't soak it overnight. I used chopped walnuts. It was AMAZING! Crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. The blueberries taste really good with it!

Although I followed the directions and checked for doneness, it came out soggy on the bottom.  Family liked the taste, but not the texture.

Just finished eating this and it was outstanding!!  I actually cooked half the blueberries with the bread for 4o mins., then added the other half on top for the last 10 mins.  Purely scrumptious!  Followed the recipe to a "T" otherwise, and finished with a drizzle of syrup.  All thumbs up from the family!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is the best French toast I have ever had! I changed it somewhat by adding cinnamon and using 6 eggs instead of five, but it was still super easy and fantastic. Ultimate comfort food. Will definitely make again and share the recipe!

YUM-O! The taste is perfect. I get many compliments on this recipe, but like the other say, CONSISTENCY is an issue. My toast came out a bit soggy too. I have made this twice and the second time used less egg mixture and it was much better. I didn't have blueberries on hand so I used a bag of frozen mixed berries and it was delish! Also, I add the pecans with 10 min remaining since they burn easily.

this was awesome!  I tore up the bread so the egg mixture would be even throughout.  i even used up some bread ends I had in the fridge. Baked about 35 minutes before adding blueberries(could have been less)

Very good recipe - not sure exactly what the texture is supposed to be like but the flavor was fantastic.  I might use slightly older or thicker bread next time (used 1 day old french bread,sliced 3/4 inch thick)to try to get a crispier result.  Definitely worth a try with peaches - yum!

I have made this recipe according to the recipe several times and have always loved it.  When I went to get out blueberries lastnight from our freezer all I could find was frozen cherries.  I used the cherries and sliced almonds, and almond extract, in place of the cinnamon I used cardamon....Once again, rave reviews by all!

This recipe is incredible. I added cinnamon, had I left it out it would have been sorely missed. My husband made a grab for the syrup until I told him to throttle back and take a bite first. It remained on the table unused. I used frozen blueberries that we had picked this summer but this recipe is so versatile depending on the season and what fresh and available. In July I'll use strawberries and September apples. This is a new breakfast staple for us, easy and company quality I've never seen my kids eat so much for breakfast. Next time though I will double the syrup to drizzle and mix the pecans into it before spreading to sort of candy them and add a touch more cinnamon. All the loyal readers of my reviews need to try this one out! ;)

We had this Christmas morning and my whole family enjoyed it greatly! Wasn't soggy at all and came out perfectly.  I made a simple blueberry syrup to go with it that topped it off nicely. You didn't want too much though, or it would be too sweet.  I think next time I'll try this with blackberries!

Very good recipe..we were fighting over the crispy corner pieces!
My French bread slices were huge, so they were layered...2 rows of 6 overlapped slices in a 9x13 glass baking dish. 
I left off the blueberries and pecans, but still drizzled the top with 1/4c butter and 1/4c brown sugar. 
I'm a 'ketchup on my French Toast' kinda girl, but this version with syrup was awesome!

I made this for a brunch and was amazed at how quickly it disappeared! I used 8 eggs and increased the milk. I spread the cream cheese on the bread before cubing it and it worked great. Frozen blueberries were all I had and worked well. I did increase the amount of the sauce to 1 1/2 what it called for. To give it some extra flavor, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar in the sauce. The leftovers warmed up well in the microwave for a different lunch at work.

Oh so yummy.  I prefer raspberries for a bit of tart, though blueberries were ok too.   This makes an excellent brunch recipe because you can prep the night before.  I use 16 slices of 1" bread, which over night fills the baking dish perfectly.  Otherwise follow directions exactly.  11/12/16 update:  Next time, I'll try it with half the sugar in the eggs.  Also, mandarin oranges didn't work that great for the fruit.  Needs a tart fruit to counterbalance the sweetness of the brown sugar.

The taste was fantastic, but mine ended up really soggy. I'll read the reviews a little more carefully next time to try to solve the consistency problem, but I'll definitely be making this again!

Yum, Yum Yum. I made this several times and it always comes out wonderful. I cube the bread, have used frozen peaches and frozen blueberries or just peaches... Yum. Everyone who has had it raves. I have even made with the fat-free egg beaters and brown sugar splenda and it came out great for a ladies brunch where everyone was dieting. A real keeper!!

The flavor of this bake is great.  I did make some adjustments based on the other reviews.  I doubled the bread by slicing the french bread in 3/4 inch slices, cutting the slices, lengthwise, and then dominoing them.  On top of that layer, I placed 1/2 in. whole slices.  I did bake it for 45 minutes and put some extra brown sugar on top.  When the bake was finished...I sprinkled powdered sugar on it.  Everyone loved the texture and flavor.  I didn't put any nuts or fruit in it...next time I'm adding raisins.

Don't worry about adding maple syrup on top because this is very, very sweet.  The blueberries help balance that a little and are indispensible.  Definately double the baking time.  I baked it 45 minutes and then added the blueberries and baked 10 minutes more.  I also flipped the bread slices before it went in the oven.  I'm not sure if that helped or not.  The edges were nicely crunchy but the middle was still soggy.

This was my second time trying overnight french toast.  I liked the flavor, but like the other attempt, mine was just too soggy in the middle. I even used the right bread and made sure that it was two days old!  I tried to bake it longer, but I had to take it out because it was starting to burn and it was still soggy on the inside with a crunchy exterior(that tasted great). I'm no expert cook, but I don't understand how other reviewers could make this and have it come out good, unless they just don't mind the sogginess.  I think I'll stick to traditional french toast, but use this egg mixture!
