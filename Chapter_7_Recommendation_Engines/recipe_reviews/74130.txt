Great recipe: One way to make sure the chicken stays moist is to spray cooking spray on the bottom of the pan.  I always add extra spices to recipes and I did just that for this one.  I added parsley, oregano, and basil sprinkling it on the chicken with the paprika, salt and pepper. I also sprayed the top of the chicken with cooking spray to keep it moist.  It took about 45 minutes to cook the chicken.  The chicken was very moist and by itself was a little to much lemon juice but I mixed it with white rice and the flavors where perfect.  I will def. make this again and would recommened it.

I was really hoping to like this recipe; unfortunately, after two preparations using the original, unmodified recipe, I can't say that I do.  I will not be making this again, nor can I think of any changes to make to the recipe to improve it in my opinion.

This recipe was good, but I had to change a few things as always- I just can't help myself! Instead of white wine I used white zinfandel- this type of wine with chicken is awesome, gives a very unique but delicious flavor.  I would have used half the amount of lemon juice; I love lemon, but I don't want it to be the main flavor of the dish- a little overpowering. I did not use a whole head of garlic, and probably would have prefered it minced instead of sliced. No paprika. I used garlic powder instead. Other than that it was great!

This recipe was great! I added thinly sliced potatoes to the bottom. I also omited the wine because I didn't have any on hand. The potatoes soaked up all of the delicious flavor. I will definately try this again!

Good flavor but I suggest cooking it at 400. Onions were not cooked. Make it with sliced potato and WOW!

I really enjoyed this chicken. However, there was not enough taste too it, even after using plenty of paprika. To make it more appealing, I cooked it with tortellini pasta. I placed the chicken, with the onions and garlic slices and placed it on a bed of tortellin, stuffed with aspargus and cheese.Very good! My fiance liked it better the second time! I suggest it.

I was not very impressed with this recipe.  It took twice as long to cook as listed and it make a nice chicken breast but not much taste.  The chicken was great for salads or pastas later but as a main dish not too exciting.

My fiance is super-picky, so this was a good recipe for him. I thought it was just all right, but he seemed to enjoy it quite a bit.  I marinated the chicken overnight in the ingredients, and that seemed to make it more moist and flavor infused.  I will probably make this again, but I will modify some more.

Excellent and easy.  I put a lot of the seasoning on it and added garlic powder. Plus I covered with foil to trap the moisture and others had recommended. I will make this again.

Marinade the chicken in lemon juice, pepper, and salt for at least 2 hours ahead of time, and it will be much more flavorful.

Gallon size ziploc bags are great for marinading meat.

My husband and I were both very pleased with this recipe. We squeezed lemons for the juice, and omitted the paprika, simply because we didn't have any on hand. We also used thinner chicken breasts, which really soaked up the flavor. I plan to incorporate it with pasta next time.

Amazing!  The lemon adds a subtle zing. Very simple and quick to prepare.  I tried skipping the wine once and substituted for a little water and it still tasted great!

This was a good recipe, very easy to make although it did take longer to cook. Next time I will put a couple of drops of oil on the chicken before the paprika so it wont be so dry. Otherwise it was great. Thanks for sharing.

A couple of simple modifications make this excellent! Add lots of fresh ground pepper and a tad of your own favorite spices since most go with lemon & wine. Wonderful, moist, and easy to make.

Excellent dish!  I only made three changes, and I thought it turned out great!  I used all white wine, versus white wine and lemon juice  because I didn't have any lemons :o)  I also rubbed the chicken well with salt, pepper and paprika prior to adding to the dish, and I covered the pan with tin foil.  Also, I only used 4 very large garlic cloves, peeled and quartered.  VERY moist and tasty chicken!

I originally made the recipe exactly as is except rubbed oregano, sweet basil, and parsley on the chicken.  I sprayed the final contents with a light coat of PAM and topped with foil.  Baked it for about 35-40 minutes on 400.   After the 40 minutes I decided I wanted the runny watery liquid to be more of a gravy/sauce so I removed the chicken and added cornstarch mixed in cold water and added about half a cup of whipping cream.  Mixed together, buried the chicken in the onions and put under the broiler for a few minutes.  Removed and mixed together.  It was DELICIOUS.  It was interesting because it was a wine/lemon based Alfredo-like sauce and onions took place of noodles.  Nom nom nom.

Very bland - won't make our menu rotation.  Chicken was tender but other than that, there's not much positive to say about this one.  Took longer to cook than stated, onions didn't soften up, and there was very little flavor.  Perhaps this would be a good way to cook chicken for other recipes such as salads or pastas, but it didn't stand well on it's own.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much! I didnt use as much lemon juice as it originally called for, but used a little more white zinfandel and it turned out so moist! Smelled and tasted great.

easy to prepare (my first recipe ever cooked for my girlfriend! - i know, i'm a lamer)  a little too much garlic for me though.  i'd use at least half of what it calls for unless you're into that kind of thing.

Okay it took a lot of time to prep no big deal - the chicken was very moist which is a good thing but overall I was dissappointed...Oh did anyones garlic ever turn grenish/blue?  I bought it today it looked fine and smelled fine so Im thinking maybe it was the interaction with the lemon juice and chicken stock (substituted for wine)..well if we all get sick i will be owning a keyfood lol

Very simple dish to make. I didn't use 2 onions though, just 1. And instead of sliced garlic, I crushed about a half of a head and just put it on the bottom of the dish b/c I didn't want the garlic to overpower the chicken. But that's all a matter of personal preference. The chicken was so tender and moist. Make sure to cover the dish w/ aluminum foil to trap in the moisture. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

It was just okay. The onions and garlic were delicious, but I did have to cook it for much longer. After the 30 minutes, I ended up raising the temperature and cooking for 15 more minutes, which was perfect. I actually added some rosemary as well, but it just kind of lacked for me. It wasn't horrible, but with all the recipes out there, I wouldn't spend my time on this one again.

This recipe (with a few tweaks) was delicious! I'm a beginner at cooking, but my fiance has been in kitchens his whole life so he helped me with technique, but it came out great. I didn't use paprika, instead coated the chicken with a lemon pepper spice, but kept all the other ingredients the same. I took the juice left over in the bottom of the pan and added it some thin spaghetti and served the chicken over the pasta. Came out delicious!

This was THE worst recipe I have ever tried...very easy to make, but it had my husband throwing up all night.  I tried a bit and did not care for it either.

The chicken didn't have any flavor. Would need to make modifications before I would consider this recipe again.

This was good!  I had to use a little more wine and lemon juice....because I like both of those things.  Tasted like scampi though.  Good and easy.

The garlic turned blue (possibly from the lemon juice) which wasn't really great for the presentation.

Chicken was very moist but even with 2 onions and an entire head of garlic, it was pretty bland. I will not make this recipe again :(
