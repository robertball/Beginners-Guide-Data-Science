This "Persian Rice" recipe is how rice is prepared in Iran. I will add the following notes: (i) rinsing the starch out of the rice is of paramount importance and is usually done by swishing the rice around in a bowl of water and draining several times until the rinse water is clear (described as "rinsed rice" in this recipe, and shown as water running over rice in a sieve in the video); (ii) cumin in the potato crust ("tahdig") may be a regional variation but it is not common (at least not in Tehran) (sounds good though); (iii) sometimes the pot of steamed rice is just inverted over a plate with the potato crust left in place. If you want to do this, you need to have a few tricks up your sleeve to stop the potatoes and rice from sticking to the pot. For the potatoes, rinse the starch off the slices, dry them, and slide them around in the hot oil (so they are not sticking) before adding the rice on top of them. For the rice, use a wide spatula or egg lifter to mound the rice in the center of the pot (away from the sides) before steaming it. Before inverting the pot of steamed rice over a plate, put the bottom of the hot pot of rice (after steaming) in a sink of cold water to loosen the potato crust; (iv) always put a towel under the pot lid (as described in the recipe) or you will have soggy rice; (v) it is not necessary to add butter when steaming the rice (common but optional).   Kudos to Chef John for very clearly explaining this method of preparing rice (video)! Nice work!

using saffron and potato under rice shows that it's a really Persian style of our rice, but in Iran ladies love the lots of oil and use extra measure of oil however it makes the rice more delicious especially when the oil was not vegetable oil it must be the oil that extract from butter of milk. also in Iran ladies use potato under spaghetti and we sometimes use leaf lettuce and oil or thin naan and oil  instead of potato under rice.

Married to a Persian for many years, this recipe sounds about right. However, I suggest you boil the rice for only 6 minutes, tops.  I sometimes boil for only 5, depending on the rice I use. Cumin is not used in most Persian recipes, however, saffron is. For variety, you can make a pilaf after boiling the rice. Add baby Lima beans and dill weed for one. For another really yummy one, pre cook some lentils and steam them along with raisins and some dates and I like to add cinnamon, with the white rice.  Then you will have addas pollo, a Persian favorite.  There are many combinations which are wonderful. Rice with Shredded, sautéed sweetened carrots combined with shredded, candied orange peel with a dash of rose water is divine.  So many!  There is a great Persian cookbook called New Food For Life. If you like this most simple  of recipes, I'd invest in it. Full of pictures too and detailed recipes.

I grew up with Persian rice and it's my favorite! I must strongly suggest rinsing your rice several times before cooking it. To make it easy, I put the rice in a fine-mesh colander and drop it into a pot of water. I gently swish it around for a bit, and repeat four more times with clean water. The rice will not come out very well if you don't rinse the starch off first. This recipe is foolproof for those who are uncertain how long to boil the rice before steaming it. It comes out perfectly every time. A kitchen towel or paper towels are absolutely necessary during steaming to prevent mush and to keep the rice beautiful and fluffy. I use lavash or pita for the tadig (crispy bottom layer), but one of these days I'm going to try the potatoes.

THIS is how rice should be made!!  I have always been disappointed when I have made rice in the past, gummy or undercooked or just plain tasteless.   This rice came out perfectly and was very tasty.  The potato slices were a wonderful added bonus.  My husband commented on how attractively the rice was presented (with a splash of yellow on top and a circle of golden potatoes).  Then he proceeded to have two servings and one by one ate all of the potatoes.  I will never make rice any other way!  Thanks for a wonderful addition to my repetoire.  Even after 50 years in the kitchen I can still learn new and exciting things

This rice was wonderful! My whole family loved it, which doesn't happen real often. The spices and herbs give this dish a very flavorful and fresh taste. It's labeled as Persian Rice, but the flavor is mellow enough that it could be a side dish to pretty much any entree, and not just Mediterranean food. It sounds like I contradicted myself by saying that it's flavorful and mellow, but somehow, both of those words describe it perfectly. I will make this rice again very soon. Thank you for the recipe, Chef John!

12.12.19 - made exactly as directed. The rice was loose, just how Persian rice should be, flavorful and the potatoes were to die for! Like little potato chips!

Rice cooked this way is delicious. And the recipe is quite authentic, just potato is substituted for local sort of thin bread called lavash (potato is not very popular in those places) . But potato makes it even better. Try to supplement this rice with meat (lamb or beef)  sautéed with fried onion, cilantro, dill, parsley, garlic chives in clarified butter and some lemon juice added

Truly awesome. Chef John's many recipes are always good, easy to make. This one is no different. The saffron is super expensive, but you don't need a lot of it. The potatoes cooked up beautifully and added a very nice touch. Follow the directions and you can't mess this up.

I was apprehensive about making this for the first time for strangers but it was a hit.  The second time will go quicker for sure.  The cooking style was fantastic and flavor light and enjoyable.  Glad I increased batch size by 50% into two pots.

The flavor was quite good.  I did use turmeric instead of saffron because I didn't have any saffron.  I cooked the rice for exactly 7 minutes,  but even after steaming,  it wasn't fully cooked.  I live in HIGH ALTITUDE and am wondering if I should have added to the initial cooking time. Any suggestions,  Chef John?

My husbands father is Persian, and he holds Persian rice above all others. He very stringent with his compliments, a critic about everything. He ate this rice last night.... I'm not Persian, nor do I have experience cooking Persian food, but he LOVED this rice! Cheers!

This was fabulous. I had trouble believing it would actually work, but it did. That said, I did something wrong because I didn't get crispy potatoes, but hey I can work on that. Heads up, though, when you take the dishtowel off the pan be sure to set it somewhere besides the stovetop next to the vegetables cooking on the other burner. Yeah, I should have known better but I was excited to see how the rice had come out. Fortunately  only a dishtowel was lost, but learn from my mistake, and keep safety first. UPDATE I made this again and got the crispy bottom layer it was great!

I used tumeric in the place of saffron.  It's affordable  &  very nutritious.  Gives a  beautiful deep yellow coloring.

This is an amazing rice dish. I've made it a couple times for my family and once for a dinner party. It has been a hit every time. This recipe/technique is now part of my permanent repertoire. It goes nicely with jujeh chicken kabob.

Super easy to make, and tastes really good!  I didn't have saffron, so at the end, I flipped the whole thing into a bowl.  Served it with chicken tikka masala, and some naan.

This is the best thing ever.  Seriously. It’s simple and I make it exactly as written.  My kids fight for the potatoes and the crispy rice bits are so addictive.  Ever since I found this recipe it’s been in regular rotation.

An excellent recipe for this delicacy! I didn’t have basmati rice, but it still came out great with jasmine rice. I followed the advice of others who said to be sure to rinse rice really thoroughly as first step, and to dry the potato pieces before putting them into the hot pan, moving them around a bit so they won’t stick much like the video recommended.

Followed instructions, but much of rice was crunchy (as in cooked too much, not undercooked) and potatoes were too hard/overcooked. Guess I could make thicker potato slices and cook it for less time, but I think I'll try a different recipe next time.

This is my 5th time making this recipe, and it is a smash hit every time. Kids especially love it. I have substituted turmeric for the yellow coloration before, but prefer saffron. This is the only method I use anymore :-)

This was awesome.  Came out just like Chef John's video except my potatoes didn't crisp up as nicely!  Followed the directions to a Tee.

Chef John to the rescue.  I was making a Middle Eastern dinner for guests when I realized that Claudia Roden's recipe for Persian rice was too confusing to follow. This recipe clarified the method for the rice, and dinner was saved. The potato crust was especially enjoyed by the English person in the household.

It really wasn't that fantastic.   I gave it a third star because the rice did cook very fluffy.  Flavor was a disappointment.  I thought by adding the spice and the saffron it would bring a new twist to the rice.  It did not and I followed the recipe.  My suggestion is to increase the spice but not the saffron.

I made this to go along with lamb kabobs and everyone loved it. I don't think my potatoes got as crisp as Chef John's because I don't think I cooked them long enough. So next time I will cook them a little longer before adding the rice to the potatoes. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a good method to make basmati rice, but you MUST rinse the rice several times to remove some starch before boiling it!   Usually I leave out the potatoes and make tadig.  (Tadig the delicious, crispy golden layer of rice found at the bottom of the pot when you heat plenty of butter and oil before steaming the rice.)  I use this method for all my rice.  Yes it takes longer than a box, but it is so much better.   (I don't know if cumin is traditional for Persian Rice, so if you don't like it, leave it out.)

I served this with chicken kofta and tzaziki.  it was easy to make and the end results were fabulous.  I  was out of butter so I used margarine, and didn't have saffron.  Still, this was amazing!

I usually don't follow recipes but I know nothing about Persian rice, in fact, I don't make rice well. This recipe was fantastic and it came out great and i followed it exactly with portions and times. I am so proud of myself and if you make this correctly, your friends and family will have a lot of respect for you! The potatoes help make it awesome!

Great recipe, thank you. Mine came out pretty good, but the rice was gummier (more stuck together) than the individual pieces of rice served in the local kabob places. I'm going to experiment more with the recipe to see if I can get it a bit "dryer".

I made this with my rice maker. I added the saffron after it cooked.  I got rave reviews with this rice at a party.  For leftovers I made a Persian fried rice with some leftover chicken and frozen stir fry vegetables from Costco. It was very good.

This is one of the best rice dishes I tried. It has a soft texture and delicate taste. The only thing that went wrong was when I added the saffron to the rice, it broke.
