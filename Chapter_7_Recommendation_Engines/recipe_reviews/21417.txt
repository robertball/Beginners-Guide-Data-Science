Yummy! We were pleasantly surprised by how good this was! Didn't have ham hocks, so we used about 2 cups of chopped ham steaks instead. Also, doubled up on the chicken bouillon. We let it cook on low for nearly 10 hours & it was DELICIOUS!! This one's a keeper!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!  Will definitely make this again.  I did a little subsitution.  I used a red onion (in place of a white/yellow onion), smoked sausage (in place of ham) and chicken broth (in place of water).  I put everything in the cockpot at one time and cooked on low for 8-10 hrs.  It was a hit!!!!  I took it to a church potluck and recieved many, many compliments.  It is an entire meal!!!

Excellent flavor.  I may also try these on the stovetop when I'm in a hurry and want them more quickly.  For better time approximation, it took at least 2 hrs. for the mixture to reach the simmering point (Step 2), and I found that the potatoes needed longer than 45 minutes to become tender (Step 3) (I cooked them for 1 1/2 hrs.)However, my Crockpot didn't have a "medium" setting, it only has "high" and "low", so this might have made the diference. The green beans were still a bit firm/crispy - don't expect them to be soft like canned green beans!

Fabulous! I didn't have time to use the slow cooker so I put them on the stove and cooked them for 25 minutes and then added the potatoes for another 35 minutes. The only other change I made was I added red onion as I had some left over from a salad I made. These are the best green beans I have ever tasted. Even my finicky 11 year old ate them. Thanks Sharon!

Growing up in eastern PA my mom used to make this after Easter and Christmas when we had ham. I make mine with canned green beans and potatoes, pepper, and a few capfuls of Apple Cider Vinegar and let it come to a boil on the stove and then simmer for 2-3 hours.  The Apple Cider Vinegar gives it a nice little kick to it.

My mother made a variation of this when I was growing up, and I've made it for many years myself.  However, this is better than she and I made.  I could not bring myself to add garlic, and I used ham rather than ham hocks.  Put it all in the slow cooker for 12 hours and it was wonderful.  It's my new recipe.

This sounded like a delicious meal, but what's the point of a crockpot recipe if you have to keep attending to it?  The crockpot was designed, I thought, for those of us who want a home-cooked meal when we get home from work, a meal that cannot be tended to from time-to-time all day.

I've been serving this for years and it is always a winner. Here's something that I've found that takes it from "okay-good" to "perfect": add a very generous teaspoon of country Dijon mustard toward the end...when you are cooking the potatoes. Be sure to use new, or red or white potatoes; russets will fall apart with too much cooking or reheating. If using ham hocks (which are fatty) try cooking them alone (in the slow cooker), strain meat, keeping the broth, allow broth to cool and remove the fat on top. Now add cut ham pieces, potatoes and green beans to the broth in a large pot, and gently boil until beans & potatoes are tender. Ham slices are faster (cook at least two, cut in 1" squares) less fatty and just as delicious, with less work than skimming fat from hocks. Which ever you choose, don't forget the country Dijon! Yummy!

Wonderful flavor!  I added a few more potatoes than was called for.  As I do not have a medium setting, I had to switch to low and cook longer.  I actually left my cooker on for 8 hours and it was delicious, however the beans were not crispy.  My family loved this!!

This is missing the KEY INGREDIENT to a great "like your grandma used to make" taste.  2T of bacon grease.  Put the bacon grease over the green beans to add extra flavor.  I always use smoked sausage or keilbasa.  Another great tip is to sprinkle sugar on the green beans NOT salt.  If it needs salt to taste let the person eating do that so you dont over do it.  Typically mine never needs any salt and is perfect the way it is.

These beans are delicious..they taste like my mom used to make.  I have made them several times and they are a hit with my family.  I throw all of the ingredients in my crock pot and simmer on low for about 6-8 hours.  The only change I make to the recipe is to use chunked boneless ham instead of the ham hocks.  They still have a great flavor without the added fat of the ham hocks.  They are great with homemade southern cornbread.

This was good but my beans were too stringy which ruined it somewhat.  Also I used leftover ham which worked out well.

Yum! My grocery store only had smoked ham hocks and they looked dry and unappealing so I used pork chops instead. Dredged the chops in flour and browned them before adding to the slow cooker. Also used chicken stock instead of water and bouillon and just threw it all into the slow cooker at once. Instead of garlic powder I used minced fresh garlic and also added a Tbsp of brown sugar and a splash of cider vinegar to add a little tang. Cooked on high for just over 3 hours and it came out great! Awesome comfort food with a delicious flavor and soft texture. Before serving I took some of the cooking liquid and reduced it in a pan with white wine and sour cream to make a nice gravy. Yukon gold potatoes and fresh green beans were perfect for this. I'm sure it would also be delicious with ham or smoked sausage. Maybe next time!

I've been making this on my stove for years and just tried the slow cooker (7 hours on low was perfect for the green beans). I had never added chicken broth before, and it made a great dish even better! Thanks!

This had good  flavor, but because I put it in the slow cooker before I went to work, it was very overcooked.  Next time I will make it on the stove, and there will be a next time!

Just have rediscovered my crock pot and I thought this recipe was something different and something I could put together quickly.  Threw everything in at one time, as another reviewer suggested, and cooked on low for 4-5 hours.  Two things I did differently: I used one packet of Goya Ham Concentrate sprinkled over the green beans rather than the chicken bouillon.  And instead of the ham hocks I used a large Boar's Head ham steak, chopped.  Excellent!!

4 stars because I had to modify. I users yellow onion and 3 gloves of garlic instead of powders. I used a good quality bacon and cut into chunks. I used chicken broth instead of the boullion. We ate almost the whole pot. This is a keeper for sure!! Can't wait to make again with buttermilk cornbread.

Five Stars with the following changes:  used one thick cut ham steak, cubed (a little over 2 cups) doubled the chicken bouillon, threw all ingredients in the crock with just enough water to cover and cooked on low for 10 hours. Served with cornbread.  Definitely a keeper for us!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Family loved it!! Put green beans in crockpot, covered with 2 cans of chicken broth; topped with leftover ham chunks (uncooked)and onion; sprinkled with garlic powder and pepper; then fried a pound of bacon and (after eating some)crumbled up the rest and dumped grease in all right in with it.  Cubed some potatoes and threw those in the last couple of hours.  Could not believe how good this was.  Great for a low carb meal after sorting out the potatoes.

This was great!!! I used chicken broth instead of water and also added the chicken boullion cubes.  I added garlic, because I put fresh garlic in just about everything I make. (about 4 cloves minced). The only kind of ham hocks sold at the store are smoked, but it gave this such a great flavor. Also they didnt have much meat on them either, so as other reviewers suggested, I put a smoked sausage cut up in at the end, it came out good.  I think I will try other suggestions and use a ham bone too.  This was great. Will make againg and again. Thanks for the recipe.

I had a leftover ham bone from our holiday dinner and was wondering what to do with it. This recipe was the first one that popped up when I searched the all recipe website for "ham and beans". I wasn't expecting green beans, but I had all ingredients on hand so I gave it a whirl. Boy did the house smell great! I made this for my Bunco group and it was perfect on a cold rainy night. Very yummy! I got rave reviews at Bunco and gave the recipe to all my Bunco friends! Will make this recipe again for sure!

I used a ham shank, 4 cups of water with a heaping tablespoon of 'Better Than Bouillon' chicken flavored along with minced garlic.  Whom ever said that garlic and smoke flavor does not 'go together'--well, marries very well for our taste.  I cooked this in my slow cooker on high for about 8 hours and the bean texture was perfect---however, I live in high altitude and not sure if that would make a difference.  I do think the key to flavor with this recipe is the quality of chicken bouillon, the brand I used is the best I have found by far.  It comes in a dark brown glass screw top container approximately 2/3 cup size and is of paste consistency.  When done all I added was a little Greek seasoning and butter.  A little high level on calories and fat---but that works for me being Thanksgiving.

Great, Simple Food!  The seasonings were perfect for my family's taste.  I placed everything (used a ham steak) in the crockpot and was ready in less than 3 hours. I even used canned green beans since I had no fresh. Very tasty supper!

This recipe was not at all what I had expected. I would not recommend making it.  There was no flavor, no texture and least of all not worth the expense of the ingredients. I just don't get it. Too bad because I was so excited about sharing it with my family. Next time, I would use a fatty cut of pork, less potatoes, more onions, add garlic, salt, marjoram and a large amount of sage with parmesan cheese.

This recipe is awesome! It's just good down home cooking that seems to be forgotten. I threw all my veges in with the ham and let it cook all day. I was concerned about the potatos drying out while heating, so I added one cup chicken broth. The green beans were cooked to death but tasted great! My roomate's dad would only eat his green beans this way! He'd send them back if they weren't very very soft. Can't go wrong with this recipe

I added an extra can of 33% less sodium chicken broth (wasn't sure how salty it'd be) and a can of regular chicken broth in the beginning when i put the beans in. With the beans, I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic, an extra tablespoon of seasoning salt, sprinkled with parsley, and added a carton of fresh mushrooms. They came out delicious! I cooked it for 2 hours on high, then added potatoes and a ham steak cut in half, for another 3 hours on low. Green beans and potatoes came out perfect! Will make again!

Put everything in the crock pot--green beans, potatoes and added carrots too- and went to church. Cooked it on high and it was perfect when we got home--5 hours and dinner was ready. Highly recommend cooking the sausage or kielbasi first to make it crispier.  This was a big hit.

Not sure how anyone could give this a bad review.  It's a basic, easy recipe that yields delicious results.  Not fancy but everyone loves it.  I usually make these on the stovetop and have added ham, ham hocks, smoked turkey legs, bacon, and even kielbasa - all are equally tasty.  I think adding more salt than this recipe requires is key, but then again the poster DID say she kind of just throws stuff in there which is what I also do.

My brother makes a dish very similar to this and adds a can of stewed tomatoes and and then fresh sliced mushrooms and zuchini towards the end.  You can thicken the broth a bit with some rue and it is delicious as well.  We've always called it Green Bean Stew in our family.

I do not care for Ham hocks so I cut up cubes of ham instead and I used a big thing of chicken broth instead of bouillon grandules. My mom used to make this when I was younger and I have to say this recipe taste even better than I remember.

I was surprised and how the flavors from each food did not seem to cross into each other and create some sort of stew-like creation.  What you get at the end of the recipe is Ham, Potatoes, and Beans---but cooked all together to reduce having to wash excess pots/pans!  My family enjoyed this recipe, and i will be making it again.

I followed the ingredients, except everything I used was from a can, but not the onion.  I drained and rinsed the green beans, enough water to cover and added almost a tablespoon of ham base.  Simmered with the onion, ham steak (half), diced and 2 cans of potatoes.  I think the ham base really added to the flavor, DH & I both enjoyed it!  Thanks for sharing!

Instead of water use low sodium chicken broth.  Substitute 1-1/2 to 2 pound boneless uncooked port butt for the ham hocks.  Omit chicken bouillon granules.  Combine all ingredients including seasonings and cook on low for 6-8 hours.  Take out pork butt and cut into chucks after cooling for about 20 minutes.  Put butt back into crock pot with other ingredients.  A very hearty, enjoyable meal.

I love making this recipe in the summer with fresh green beans from a local farmers stand!  I add in a sliced Vidalia sweet onion, some fresh garlic cloves, a bay leaf, and some vegetable stock...it is summer comfort food!!!  Great served with a crusty dinner roll!  Edit - I made this classic recipe again, only I substituted 2 of the ham hocks for Johnsonville Sausage...it was absolutely amazing!!!

This was so good and tasty I will make this again. I did change one thing instead of using ham hocks I used ham shanks because it has more meat on the bone then the ham hocks do.

This is a family favorite I've modified a little. Instead of ham hocks, I use a large chunk of ham with the bone and  2 cans of green beans (fresh aren't always available in winter). I put the ham, beans, and potatoes in the crock and let it cook on low for 6-8 hours. Makes an easy, economical meal.

This was really good.  My husband hates all cooked veggies but after he ate this he told me it was a hit and then admitted he was only going to eat it (covered in hot sauce) to humor me.  But he liked it so much he has requested it be made again! I did add bay leaves and rosemary and used a ham steak rather than ham hocks.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this yesterday and it was not very good at all. Also, the potatoes take waaaaaay longer than 45 minutes to cook. So make sure to make more time for that - like another hour, or more.

Growing up in PA Dutch country, we often had this growing up minus the garlic & onion powder and using leftover ham bone. Upon serving we drizzled white vinegar over to add extra bite (about 1 capful per serving).

I have a variation of this recipe, instead of ham hocks, for those of us with blood pressure concerns, use smoked turkey wings or legs.  Also, I use italian green beans.  They really hold up well in the cooking process.

These were the best green beans I have ever eaten!  I was short on time and as another reviewer suggested, I simmered the green beans on the stove for 25-30 minutes.  Added the potatoes (I used 2-2 1/2 lbs) and simmered for another 30-40 minutes. Absolutely perfect. This recipe is a keeper!

I've used fresh green beans with this and also green beans from a can.  Each time they have turned out wonderful!  The only thing I do different is use bacon instead of ham.  I served them at my son's wedding reception with Del Monte green beans and had people asking me if they were fresh and telling me how wonderful they were.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I don't eat pork so I made this for my just my husband.  I am afraid that he did not like this very much.  My cooker only has low and high so it was difficult to figure out just the right length of time to cook the food.  My green beans came out crunchy but so did my potatoes.  My onions seemed kinda soggy.  I put it in the fridge, over night, and pulled it out to consider a meal of leftovers.  There was a thin layer of fat on the whole thing.  My DH took one look at that and said he would make himself a sandwich.  I think the recipe is probably perfect for someone that has the right slow cooker or knows how to measure the times, just right.

Loved it- used 2 capfuls of apple cider vinegar and doubled all seasonings.  I like a stronger flavor.  Made it on the stove and used ham steak instead of hocks.  Turned out delicious.  I think the cider vinegar gives it the perfect kick.

To bump up the flavor a little, I browned the onions along with some mushrooms and fresh garlic before adding them to the crockpot.  I had made another green bean recipe from this site where one just put the onions in the pot raw and I thought it would be better to brown them first.  Also, instead of water I just put in one can of chicken broth; I figured the slow cooking process would extract enough liquid from the ingredients to cook the beans, and it worked great.  As other reviewers suggested, I used chunks of leftover ham instead of ham hocks.  This came out quite good and we enjoyed it.  Thank you so much for the post, GRAMMYROSE.

This is a great basic recipe - a lot like my favorite dish my mom makes.  BUT, I'd definitely recommend adding a chopped ham steak in, as I could barely get any meat off of the ham hocks (maybe it was just the ones I got?) and more salt and seasonings to give it more flavor.  The green beans and potatoes were both cooked perfectly when cooked as directed.

This was good! My 2 year old loved it! I did throw everything in at once and the green beans and ham were frozen. I also threw in a bag of frozen okra and a sprig of fresh rosemary and cooked on low for 10 hours. Easy and delicious!

Excellent! I made this while we were camping and it was a hit.  I did have problems getting the meat off of the hamhocks.  Maybe if the meat is slow cooked it's easier to remove.  Still delicious and I'll be making again.

I made this for dinner last night.  I put all the ingredients into the crock pot at once, as other reviewers suggested.  It made the entire house smell delicious, but when my husband and I went to eat it....it had no flavor whatsoever.  We were really disappointed and will not be making this again.

this is some of the best green beans, ham and potatoes i have ever had! i added about 4tsp minced garlic at the beginning and 1 lb center cut ham slice with the potaoes because ham hocks don't have much meat on them anymore and tony chachere's creole seasoning instead of seasoned salt.

I remember eating this as a child and have been making it myself for many many years using chopped garlic instead of garlic powder.Have always cooked on stove top. Never tried it in a slow cooker.The  same basic dish can be made using smoked turkey and a dash of bottled smoke seasoning(if you don't eat pork)

Very easy recipe.  I made it with smoked sausage instead of ham.  I put the green beans, potatoes and onions in the crock pot and cooked it on low for 8 hours.  I added the smoked sausage for the last 2 hours.  When I make it again,  I will only add 1/2 an onion.  We will try ham the next time!

I also do not have a medium setting on my slow cooker, so I ended up cooking it on the stovetop (as suggested by another reviewer).  It came out great, but seemed like more of a side dish than an main course.

Someone asked me for my Grandma's recipe for Green Bean Casserole, although I cook it on the stove this is just about the closest to it I've seen, I cook it a long time, the beans aren't crispy, but everyone's favorite.  I just make it, so this is the recipe I'm handing out when I'm asked

I bring this to work for potlucks. I use chicken broth instead of water and the granules. I have also used canned green beans with great results. I throw everything in together, including potatoes (red potatoes) and let it go. It's a great taste of home.

I LOVED this recipe! 1) It was VERY tasty. The only thing different I added was a little olive oil and some fresh [crushed] garlic (I skipped the onion powder since I already added real onions).
2) I used fresh beans so you could tell the difference (in freshness).
3) I also added in MORE meat (Pork, shoulder) which made it very much more meaty (Good).
4) I also added more "Pork" flavoring (called "Goya" pork flavoring).

I have made this over and over again! I make it on the stove not the slow cooker. A huge hit! EVERYONE loves it. I also have a hard time finding ham hocks, so I use ham shanks. I am also born and raised in Pa. Where this is a Pennsylvania Dutch favorite....I have to admit it's the best I've ever had. Now I tell all of my extended family, I make the best ham and green beans thanks to this recepie!

***EDIT.Update:  Also good if you throw in a little white wine!!***

This is SO good!!  I will never use another recipe again!  I made only slight variations but I'm sure the original is fine too.  I used a leftover ham bone and meat from a picnic ham.  I also put some of the skin/fat from that ham on top of this while it was cooking.   Added a tablespoon of white sugar as some recipes call for.  Cooked it all at once on low for 8 hours I think.  Some might find the beans too mushy when cooking that long but I like mine that way.   THANK YOU FOR THIS!   Have tried so many and they just were not good!

Boiled a VERY LARGE ham hock for about three hours before going to bed.  Refrigerated it until the next evening when I skimmed off the fat and removed the bones. Put the potatoes in, added some onion and garlic powder.  Green beans were over $3 a pound so just used frozen.  Added these when the potatoes were almost cooked.  Added a couple tablespoons of vinegar, and a tablespoon of brown sugar at the suggestion of other reviewers.  I honestly did not expect my son or husband to like this.  They LOVED it!  Both dubbed this recipe as a definite keeper. And by refrigerating it overnight, there was very little fat in the dish, but all the flavor.  Good Eats!

This is my go to recipe for green beans and ham. I use 1 ham hock and a cup or two of diced ham. And use a little more of the seasonings than called for.

This dish was good, but not as good as I had hoped and expected.  It was easy to prepare, especially since I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and just threw it all into the crock pot.  But having done that, I can see now why it might turn out better if done in stages.  In the time it took to cook the beans to some degree of tenderness (about 6 hours at a medium temperature), my potatoes over-cooked to the point that they were falling apart.  I used some leftover ham, and it, too, over-cooked, becoming slightly rubbery and turning an unappetizing shade of grey.  Also, I thought the recipe needed 2 or 3 times the amount of seasoning recommended.  Will I make this again?  Maybe...but if I do I'll make it on the stove where I can have more control over what cooks for how long.

Mmm,mmm,mmm ~ You just can't go wrong with this recipe.  Followed as directed, only adding some cubed ham at the end.  My husband and son were so busy eating that there wasn't much conversation at dinner.  Will definitely make again :)

This has become my favorite way to cook beans. I cook it on the stove, though. Also I substituted stock for the granules, fingerling for new potatoes, and fresh garlic for the powder. Sorry to say, but it puts my mother's to shame.

Very good.  I made this on the stovetop with boneless low-fat ham, cubed.  I kinda over-cooked the green beans, so I removed them from the pan while cooking the potatoes and ham together, then added them back, and simmered awhile.  I followed the recipe except for using the boneless ham, and adding a tablespoon of ham base to the water when cooking the green beans (L. B. Jamison's Soup Base Ham Flavored). (04.22.12)

It was more or less a failure for me as I took "ham hocks" literally. The ones I got ended up having NO meat on them at all, and I think I'll end up with nothing but oily beans...  Still in the cooker with most of the fat cut off the hocks, and the bones put back.
Maybe it could be rescued by saving the beans & broth and getting some ham chunks (as others have said) and re-heating.

I am trying this recipe out as we speak. I haven't made it before in the crock pot, so hopefully it's as good as the stovetop version.

Oh this recipe brings back memories.  These beans were very close to the ones my mama and grandmother made.  The only difference was that they used the tiny new potatoes and left them whole.  The pot was left on the stove to cook on low all afternoon.  No crockpots back then.   I enjoyed these very much.

My family loves this.  I sometimes cook it on the stove top for a great Sunday meal.  I also use diced ham when I can't find ham hocks.  Delicious!!  Thanks for sharing!

Super easy and so tasty!  I used diced ham instead of the ham hocks.  Cooked everything all together all day long and it was great.

Great jumping off recipe!  I adjust salt and pepper to taste and add a smidge of liquid smoke.  I used a smoked, uncooked pork shoulder this time.  I have lots of leftovers to freeze for a later date.

Been making this for 52 years, in all manners, but I think the best way is in the pressure cooker- just use your pessure cooker directions long enough to cook the potatos. I use any ham, or other  smoked meat I have in the house. Takes 10 min from raw in my pressure cooker. Never met anyone that didn't like it.

The beans are the best I've had in a long time.  I added baking soda to take the strong green taste away and sugar to offset the spices.  I used pieces of country ham instead of the hocks.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I've made this several times and made several changes depending on how I wanted to serve it. I always use Ham Shanks instead of hocks because I want the smoky meat. I have made this as a side dish with that being the only change. I've also used this to make a "mock beef barley" soup. My grandmother alway used a cottage ham to make her beef barley so I thought I would try it. It turned out grate, I just added a can of broth after I barely covered with water, tossed in frozen mixed veggies and barley at the end, trying follow the instructions on the box of barley. This is definately a keeper and remember after you have the basic recipe down try making changes that you think would work, the sky is the limit.

I've made this twice now and it's always a hit. I used cubed ham chunks this time, but last time, I think just used some bacon drippings.  Everything else was the same as what was in the recipe.

We really didn't think this recipe had much flavor at all.  If I'd had any ham base on hand I would have added it---but I didn't.  All leftovers were thrown away.  We like all the ingredients but were not pleased with the final product.

This was excellent!  Even my little ones, who are extremely picky, loved this.  I put everything in at once and cooked it 10 hrs as recommended in other reviews.  Was a little worried the potatoes might get mushy, but they didn't at all!   Will be a perfect meal for cool fall evenings.

Thanks for the recipe! I put this in the slow cooker around 7:30am and left it in all day long. We ate around 6:30 and it was very good! I used chopped Ham Steak instead of hocks and put the potatoes in mid-morning - we ate it with a loaf of warm crusty baquette and it was perfect for a chilly evening!

This is one of my favorite green bean recipes ever and I consider myself a green bean expert. I use chicken broth in place of the water (omitting the chicken bouillon granules). The longer this cooks, the better it is.

This was DELICIOUS!  I left out the onion and used almost a pound of diced ham instead of the hamhocks.  I threw everything in my crockpot, stirred it all up and cooked it on low for 8 hours.  My husband ate 3 BIG plates!

My husband and I loved this dish. Our two kids didn't, that could be that it didn't contain any form of suger.  I added carrots.  I will make this again.  The kids will eat  mac and cheese.

I did some things differently. I used ham steak because that's what I had. I had no chicken granules so used chicken stock instead of water to cover the green beans. I laid down the beans with onion, sprinkled on the seasonings, added my ham steak, then the spuds. Cooked on low heat all day. It was fantastic. I'm making it again tonight with some corn bread. Heaven. UPDATE: It was so salty this time. I have no idea why.

Wonderful.  I actually used a very meaty ham bone left over from a good spiral ham and it worked out wonderfully!  Don't fuss with it - put little mini potatoes and the ham bone in the crockpot with broth to cover. Add the green beans about 2 hours later, cook all on low til the potatoes are done. I used frozen green beans, too.

The recipe is good as a base. I used chicken broth, real garlic and at the end when I added the potatoes along with some Dijon mustard w/horse radish like another reviewer mention. It definitely was a different taste but my family and I liked it. I added a big chunk of pork lion to get more meat while it was cooking with the ham hocks. I salted along the way and threw in some cooked bacon I had left over from breakfast. At the end I took 2 cups of the broth out and made a roux with it and poured it back into the pot when I was done. We like our juice to be a little thicker then watery consistency. Overall it was good. Had seconds.

I make this quite often. Sometimes with ham hocks, sometimes not. It’s a good recipe to make your own. I made it last week with cubed ham. Delish. Tomorrow I’m making it with ham hocks and then adding more ham.

Five Stars with the following changes: used one thick cut ham steak, cubed (a little over 2 cups) doubled the chicken bouillon, threw all ingredients in the crock with just enough water to cover and cooked on low for 10 hours. Served with cornbread. Definitely a keeper for us! Thank you for sharing this recipe

The beans were very bland and still had to much of a bite to them. The potatoes cooked and were done prior to the beans. I even pulled the potatoes out and tried to finish the beans on top of the stove.

Yummy! 6 hours in the crockpot worked for me, the beans and potatoes were done, and not mushy.  I thickened up some of the cooking liquid for gravy and served with corn bread.  So good!!

Not a fan at all. Far too many green beans compared to other ingredients, and the ham hocks don't add the flavor of regular ham, not to mention the added hassle of shredding it. I also found it very bland compared to the old family recipes I was used to.

I used a smoked ham shank instead of hocks, because they have less fat.  Added additional lean ham.  Used regular garlic cloves, and no salt of any type.  Had zucchini and carrot that needed to be used up, so I threw them in as well.  Added a couple tablespoons of chia seeds, as that is my new thing.  Did this over the stove, because I ran out of time.  Delicious.  Comfort food at its best!

I followed this fairly closely, though the fresh green beans I'd based this around spoiled, so I had to call an audible and use frozen.  I don't even know what a "ham hock" is, so I used cubed smoked ham and threw in a ham shank to up the flavor.  I used HEAPING tsps of all seasonings, and still found it to be  bait bland for my tastes.  I'm kind of a crock pot purist; if I'm using the crock pot, I don't want to do any other work, so I tossed everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for 8-10 hours.  Beans were a bit mushy, but that's because I'd had to use frozen.  Potatoes were perfect.  If I made this again, I'd use garlic SALT instead of garlic powder and further increase the other seasonings.  THANKS for the recipe!

I searched and searched and could not find ham hocks where we live now. Frustrated! So, I googled pork cuts and settled on a dif leg cut. I know this is why mine was not as good and I couldn't give it a 5 star without knowing. However, the beans and potatoes were fantastic with the broth. It looked like it was going to be really bland, and I was surprised by how much flavor it did have. Wish I could have used ham hocks...would have probably been a 5 for sure!! I would make this again for a crowd because this made WAY too much for the three of us I planned on eating it...and then my daughter wouldn't even try it. I did use the leftover broth in a bean soup I made a few days later as another review mentioned you could do.

This is a pennsylvania dutch recipe. Cooking it as we speak without a crockpot. I get a large pot, put a honey baked ham bone in with water. Let it come to a boil, then add 1 large sliced onion after reducing the heat to low. I let it simmer for two hours, remove the meat from the bone and add three lbs. of beans whole (ends snipped) with some pepper (one hour). At the end I cook enough potato's seperately for the amount we will eat. No after dinner milky juice left in the pot that way. Leftovers potato's cooked seperatly again. Yum.

I have made a similar recipe for many years- my husband loves it!  Since it always seems to be even better the next day, I realized it was because the broth becomes a little thicker as the potato starch comes out.  So I started  to puree a couple of the potatoes (after they're cooked) using an immersion blender (either in a separate pot with a few potatoes and broth, or just stick it in the regular pot for a few seconds).  This gives it a nice consistency for a slightly thicker stew.  I also substitute homemade chicken broth (or store bought broth) for the water.

This was so flavorful! I made the recipe as written except that I put 2 envelopes of dried veg. soup in - for some reason I thought this recipe called for that & it was already in the slow cooker when I realized my mistake.
I had trouble with the ham hocks (which I had never even SEEN before) & I had to send someone back to the store for ham. Next time, I will put the ham hocks in for flavoring but I will not try to get meat from it!
Also, I put the potatoes in as directed but they were still very firm when I served the meal, I will put them in earlier next time.
I put the garlic powder, onion powder, seasoning salt on the table for those who wanted it, along with red pepper flakes.
Oh!, I also cooked in low sodium chicken broth.
This was so good& I will definitely be making it again & again with the changes I mentioned.
Four stars because of the ham hocks but this is a five star recipe!

Granted this did need a little more attention than most slow cooker recipes but well worth it. I used a ham bone with quite a bit of meat on it. Followed other directions except omitted the onion. very good. Also love the splash of vinegar just before eating.

The ham was not tender, while the beans were mushy and flavorless.  (Or rather, everything just tasted like salty water.)  I'd recommend "Easy Slow Cooker Ham" or "Honey Glazed Ham" from this site instead.

I can't believe how good this was.  I was searching for a new way to help use up my leftover Easter ham.  This was definitely the way to do so!  I didn't have time to use a slow cooker so I just did it on my stove top in a dutch oven.  It worked well.  I also used left over ham instead of the ham hocks but other than that I kept everything else the same.  It was flavorful, filling and my kids and husband loved it!  I even enjoyed the left overs for a few days afterwards!  Thanks for the recipe Grammyrose!

This has potential.  I was not overly pleased with the first try, but I will try again.  This is the first time I've ever used Hamhocks and did not like the experience.  Everything else worked fine.

I was looking forward to making this due to all the positive comments. I thought it was okay, and so did my husband. Probably won't make again.

I make this often with smoked sausage and it's delicious.  I usually throw everything in a dutch oven and simmer on the stove top.  We like to eat it with some skillet cornbread and sweet tea.  Mmmm!

This is very similar to my grandmother's recipe, done in a large frying pan, but we always used bacon, browned first. My favorite family recipe!

In response to Aunt Meg cooking it for 8-10 hours was way too long. I too used smoked sausage. Need to cut the time in half. Had good flavor but it turned into mush.

Just like mom used to make!  What a delicious dish.  Used two ham hocks and added some bite size pieces of ham.  Other than the bouillon didn't add any seasoning and it was perfect.  I haven't tried to cook this for a long time because my attempts were bland.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!

this is fabulous and easy! i omitted onion because the recipe doesn't need them, and used chicken broth instead of water. this is a good weekend meal, because the second time i made this i left everything in the slow cooker all day while at work and it was a little overdone (especially the ham). great comfort food!

This came out amazing!  The only change I made was to use canned green beans and a can of corn.  I also made it a day ahead, put it in the fridge and skimmed off the fat.  The flavor was amazing.

I made these tonight, but I had to leave out the pork. I kept looking for the ham hocks, but was unable to find them in a store. I know it would be way better with the ham, so that's why I gave it a 4. As it was, it was rather bland.

This was so easy and delicious.  Added brussel sprouts with the beans, potatoes and ham hocks and put in enough beef stock to cover the veges, nothing else.  Let it slow cook all day (about 8-9 hours) and served with pickled red cabbage.  Will try the vinegar next time as I will definitely be making this again.  Loved it!!!

Great recipe.  My family makes something silmilar, but we just sort of wing it, so it's nice to have a recipe to follow.  Probably sounds weird, but we serve it with vinager.  Love it!

I love this recipe.  It's so versatile. I did stovetop. scored 3 hocks covered with 3 cans low sodium ck broth, 2 bay leaves and garlic powder,  Let that simmer [1 hr] while I cut up fresh green beans,carrots & celery.  I also quartered 1 large onion. Added that to the pot and let simmer till done. Removed hocks.  Not much meat so I added some cooked smoked sausage that I had.  Being a cabbage lover I also topped the pot with a few slices of cabbage covered pot and cooked for about 15 min before veggies were done.

This was delicious. After cooking my hamhock all day though, the broth was a bit salty, and so I shouldn't have added the season salt. Be sure to taste your broth before you add your salt! I just added another potato and that soaked up allot of the salty taste! I also added fresh garlic and an onion. The guys ate this up!!

I have not made this particular recipe, but something simular.  I like to use left over bacon grease for extra flavor and minced green onions and garlic.  This for the person who said it was tasteless.  You have to make it your own!

These were good, but it would save time and energy to just use cubed ham. The broth is really good and it's a yummy way to use up green beans. I came home with 2 lbs. of them by accident-at the busy farmer's market, I was given the wrong bag! My husband really liked it.

My family loves this meal too! I love it because it's so easy to make and it is so good. When we don't have fresh green beans, I buy and use frozen ones. Tastes just as good! Instead of the seasonings used here, I use Liptons Savory Herb & Garlic Soup mix and mix it in water to cook them in. Could also use chicken broth to cook it in.

I think I would have liked this much more, without so much onion. I only used a medium sized one, and we found the flavor to be a little over-powering.

This recipes was fantastic!  My kids and husband loved it!  There was some left over which was great because it tasted even better the next day!  I subbed fres grn beans for canned and my husband said that the green beans tasted so fresh!  He will never know!  I also used turkey ham cubes to make it lighter which was awesome!  You couldn't even tell!  Will definitely make again!

Very good, even with several substitutions. I used smoked sausage instead of ham and russet potatoes and frozen green beans and it smelled wonderful when I came home. Good comfort food; thanks for sharing.

People who are not from Lancaster County, PA may not quite understand this recipe, but it has that great comfy PA Dutch blandness that I have come to know and love on a cold winter's day.

This is just like Mom's....a common Pennsylvania Dutch dish made with your leftover New Year's or Easter ham.  You can add corn also and it's yummy. This is what I call comfort food!!!

I thought this was OK, but my husband loved it.  I didn't like tearing the ham off the bone, it was quite fatty and wasn't easy to get off the bone.  I might try this again with ham steaks or something.

made the recipe on the stove top. The only complaint I have was the beans were very mushy.Try cooking the ham first for a couple of hours then add the beans and potatoes.Still was good and would make it again . Thank you

This was a popular dish I had back in my native state of PA, but when I moved to the western US, it was hard to come by. I made it using some leftover ham slices (cut into large cubes) and increased the chicken bouillon just a little because I had extra beans. Came out great and the family loved it! I'm making it again today with the beans I just picked! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this for years with fresh garlic and onions,greek seasoning,and minus the bullion granules. It is really very good. Now I may try adding a little chicken broth to taste.

I used canned potatoes and canned and frozen green beans.  It tasted great that way too.  Next time I will use fresh potatoes and green beans and add one more ham hock .   
Bonus it was very fast to make.  I added dijon mustard which gave it a good flavor.

If cooking in a pot on the stove, I would prefer Browning the onions in the pan with seasonings until you get that flavor built up& the onions aren't toughish then add water, beans, and your choice of protein that is salty. Then, continue the time limitations. I personally broke the green beans in half because my ham was already cooked & sliced & didn't need all that time to slow cook it. Still a wonderful recipe my Grandma would cook for us during Fall time or occasions. I Love It

This was a good recipe. The reason for 4 stars is well even after simmering a long while it still tasted a bit bland for all of us. Even my honey who eats well anything I make though praises the great recipes I try was adding a lot of spices to it to eat while I was at work. So I added some bacon grease, more pepper, garlic, and some siracha for a little spice (maybe a tablespoon) when I got home and it was perfect. Will make again but add more seasoning to taste.

I cooked in my crockpot on high for 6 hrs, the beans were still too hard.  I added the ham hocks, and there was more fat than meat.  I have to cook the beans more tomorrow so they get tender, and will add a ham steak.

AMAZING!!!! 
I made this recipe but with only 1 pound of green beans because my crock pot is on the smaller side and wouldn't have fit everything. 

The green beans turned out perfect! They were just as soft as out of a can but I felt better about eating them. I loved this dish!

This was a very delicious recipe with only a few slight moderations. Instead of the garlic powder I opted for fresh minced garlic instead and used smoked neck bones instead of smoked ham hocks. Instead of cooking on low I cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours before removing the neck bones and chopping up the meat. I added the meat and potatoes and cooked an additional 2 hours on high. Phenomenal I tell you! Everybody loved this one and I will continue to make this in the future. Thanks for such a great recipe.

I don't really care for green beans but this was really good! I used neck bones instead of ham hocks and I used red potatoes. Cooked on low in the slow cooker for 8 hours and it was perfect. I put the meat and potatoes in at the same time. Threw the green beans in last (I used frozen green beans). Oh and  I used chicken broth no water. Thanks for the recipe!

I just threw everything together in the slow cooker and cooked it on low for 10 hours, and it was just alright. Next time, I'm definitely going to add some tomatoes or tomato sauce.

Perhaps I don’t have the magic touch. I made this over the weekend. I used 2 small smoked pork ham shoulders, the size of ham hocks, w/o bone & fat, they were more expensive and I thought would be great. I used the very small potatoes, which cooked fine in final 2 hrs.. Followed the recipe, used spices called..had tin slow cooker for about 8 hrs on high/low/high. It cooked well, kitchen smelled wonderful..but, it was flat. I mean no flavor. Crazy, huh?  tried doctoring it up..added a little salt, dash of apple cider vinegar that other reviewers suggested. Then, I gave up. Perhaps it was the ham.. just not sure. I’m happy it worked out for so many of you. I gave it one star for the aroma and how it looked. Keep cooking!

87 yr old Mom-in-law used to love enjoying this dish with her husband of 62 years. She lives with us now, and I wanted her to feel at home. I'd never made this dish before, but this recipe turned out to be wonderful. I was using an Instant Pot for the slow cooker, but had to keep opening it to see if it was simmering, so when it came to the potato step, they weren't getting cooked enough and thought more cooking might make the beans might get mushy, so I finished the potatoes in the microwave, put them back into the slow cooker to serve. If I order a glass lid for the slow cooker, that would fix the potato issue. But, it just makes me so happy that Mom-in-Law says that it's a really good recipe, she likes it and can eat it. Thank you SOO much for the recipe.

Came home from a long night shift and decided to make this and let it sit while I slept. Took about 15 minutes to prep. I used 2 lbs fresh green beans, trimmed and rinsed. 1.5 pounds halved small red potatoes. One medium sweet onion, chopped. A 1.5lb pork butt. One can of chicken stock and added enough water (about 3-4 cans) to barely cover the beans. 4 chicken bullion. 1 tsp onion powder, seasoning salt, and garlic powder, and a half tsp black pepper. I added all the ingredients around the pork butt in the crock pot and cooked on low for 9 hours. Took out the pork, shredded, and returned to the pot for an hour while I made corn muffins. I feel like it could have used some actual table salt before cooking, but I added it to taste after and it's SO delicious! I will be making it again, but might try adding bacon and/or bacon grease next time for a little extra oomph. I mean, who doesn't like bacon...

This was really good, especially the next day! I was a bit afraid of ham hocks so I used smoked ham. Also swapped in chicken broth for the water and bullion. Still tastes great. Next time, I’ll definitely go for ham hocks to add to the flavor.

I am absolutely delighted with the ease and raves from my husband of this dish! I simply put all ingredients in a crock pot and simmered as recommended. I substituted 1 tsp French herbs instead of onion and garlic. I used 12 ounce can of chicken stock. Thanks

NO idea WHY I did NOT come up with this myself.  WOW, what a TERRIFIC meal and ALL in one pan.  Exceptional for sure and great tasting.  Did NOT make in slow cooker, but right on stove top.  Barely took just over 1/2 hr covered at med/low heat and also added some chicken broth instead of chicken bullion.  I also used "Turkey ham" instead as my daughter and g-kids  do NOT eat meats anymore. Really NICE meal indeed and everyone should TRY it at least once.

Cooked on stove.  Added butter to pan with ham and onions.  Added broth, brought to boil.  Added green beans and cubed potatoes all at once.  Simmered for approx 44 mins til it was the doneness we prefer.  Delicious

Very good.  I see a few said the beans were mushy-have to make sure they are fresh-not canned or frozen.  I used more chicken broth to slow cook the green beans, ham and potatoes. Great way to use up leftover Easter ham, if you don't have ham hocks.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count and it's always amazing. I do use chicken broth instead of the cubes. But the broth makes a HUGE difference in flavor as compared to just cooking it in water.. it's very delicious. Thanks for a classic keeper recipe that the whole family loves!

We didn't like it, and won't make it again.  Might be better with actual ham rather than hocks, which contributed mostly fat and gristle

I made this on the stove top because I feel the crockpot method was a lil silly. I mean the whole reason for a crockpot is to set it and forget it till it's done right? So if I have to keep opening the lid of crockpot it's defeating it's pupose. Anyway, this came out great and was delish. Will definitely make again. On the stove top of course.

This was delicious. I didn't measure anything and the potatoes had so much flavor. My 17 month old daughter loved it also. My husband even had seconds. I made this in the crock pot on low for 7 hours.

HUGE hit!! Everyone had seconds! My mom suggested I make this as it was something she grew up with. I went with the recipe as it called for and used the hamhocks-which was new for us. Place the hamhocks in the crockpot for a while to warm them up-they'll cut much easier. Flavor had just enough salt, yet you can still appreciate the freshness from the green beans--I will ALWAYS make this recipe with fresh green beans-for the flavor. This was easy to make-will definitely keep in my recipes.

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out great. I substitute chicken broth for the water and bullion and I substitute smoked turkey wings for the ham hocks.  I also like to add a few shakes of hot sauce.  Yummy!   thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't have ham, so I used the turkey sweet Italian sausage that I had and completely compensates by adding real Hormel bacon bits. Also, I cooked stovetop with my Le Creuset. I cooked it covered for around 20 minutes, til the potatoes were cooked, as I had already cooked the sausages in my George Forman grill.

I made this and let me tell you it was so delish, and was even better when I had for lunch the next day. Only thing is the ham hocks didn't have much meat on them. I had never used ham hocks before but they made it so good and flavorful. I've already wrote it in my cook book was the easiest meal to make.

Changed this by using a ham steak instead of ham hocks due to personal preference, but I really liked this. Easy to throw together add quite tasty. I'll make it again, for sure.

I made this followed instructions to the letter, used my slow cooker, preparing the green beans is the hardest part, diced onions in food processor, and added potatoes cut into quarters 3 hours into the cooking process, let cook another hour, I found that it needed another 2 hours or longer. It was very delicious, & the whole house had that beautiful ham n beans aroma. Thanks Grammy Rose!

This is an old family dish I've been making for years I never really measure anything and use canned green beans instead of fresh, I throw everything in the crockpot together and let simmer all day, it's always good and a great comfort food, I use chicken broth instead of water and I have used sausage on occasion in place of regular ham steaks that I usually use. Simple to make and easy clean up.

Loved this dish! Scaled it down for 1 ham hock and did not need all the called for seasoning. Just used a sprinkle of garlic salt, garlic powder and black pepper. The dish got quite a bit of flavor from my leftover Honeybaked Ham ham hock from Easter dinner. Absolutely fantastic side dish. YUMM!

Not very easy to follow instructions and not really crockpot because it is not a set and leave. Also the time on the potatoes should have been an hour longer.

We had this for dinner, with a few modifications.  I cook it on the stove top, use chicken or beef broth, and add a diced onion and carrots, and a little cayenne to sharpen the flavors.  Instead of ham hocks I use a chunk of deli ham off the bone which I dice, and add the last hour of cooking.  This one pot meal is a favorite at our house.

I didn't add salt bcuz ham already has a lot of sodium.  I used leftover ham cut up, about 4 cups, peeled & cut up russet potatoes, chicken broth, a generous sprinkling of Mrs. dash, fresh ground pepper & minced garlic, put it all in at the same time & cooked for about 4 hours on high & it was delish.  I'm glad I didn't wait to add the potatoes bcuz I don't think they would've gotten cooked @ the same time as the rest.  No problem w/the russets falling apart, either.

I make this using chicken broth.  Usually home made chicken broth if I have it on hand, if not, store bought chicken broth.  Used chipped ham (that I can buy at a barbeque restaurant), instead of ham hocks.  Delish!

I have made this several times now and I can say with all honesty this is the most southern meal you can get. My family loves this, and I have to admit I can hardly wait for this to get done, I could eat this for every meal! I use klondike butter new potatoes and leave them whole, they are very savory and do melt like butter in your mouth, also I use chicken broth instead of water and chicken bullion.

This tasted just like my Mom's recipe! I put everything together in the crock pot and let it cook for 8 hrs on low instead of waiting to add the potatoes. The beans were cooked to death but I think that's the way the dish is supposed to be.

I followed this recipe exactly and the beans were very tasty. My nine year old daughter can't stop telling me how good they were. Although I enjoyed the flavor imparted by the ham hocks, I think next time I will try a different cut of meat due to the high saltiness and fat content of the final dish. I am from the south though, and I wanted my kids to experience some true southern cooking! Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good and so easy! I used russet potatoes and a leftover very meaty hambone. I threw everything in together. Hambone first, then potatoes, then green beans, then liquid ingredients with a splash of cider vinegar and crushed red pepper. On top I added 2 ears of corn on the cob cut into thirds. Cooked on low for 6 hours. Next time I will add bacon grease as suggested by another reviewer. These would be excellent with buttermilk biscuits and honey or homemade bread with butter.

I use beer and chicken broth 1/2 & 1/2
I'll also add canned whole tomatoes, my dad called them hillbilly beans.
We also add double smoked bacon chunks because the ham hocks are sometimes overly fatty.
I prefer red onions, my wife likes the Spanish. My teenager don't care, it's FOOD.

Yummy, this was so simple and yet so delicious.  My store does not carry ham hocks, so I just used some ham that I had.  I just cubed it and threw it in the crockpot.  Four hours later, when we got home, we had a delicious dinner waiting for us. I will make this again and again.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I mostly like to use my crock pot for those hectic work days but because this didn't need to cook for the whole day and seemed to need some attention here and there I made this on the weekend. Very tasty and easy. I think next time I will try this on a work day and try adding the potatoes at the start and see how it turns out. Per other reviews this seems to be working okay. I did add some dijon mustard to the chicken broth mixture. This is a recipe that is easily adapted and can be played with.

I used Russet potatoes and they took a bit longer to cook, but this recipe was easy and tasty! I also didn't use ham hocks, but rather a boneless chunk of ham, diced up. I'd definitely make this again. :)

My aunt use to make this when I was a kid but never got her recipe so I used this one.  I found that using ham hocks made it very greasy so next time I will use a left over ham with bone.  Other than that it was delicious.  My husband had never had it and loved it.

This was great. This one for CHER you have to pull the stingy part of freash green beans before you add them. Sorry that's the country dude in me. Use to help Mom & Grandma string the beans from the graden every time we had them. Great memories...

these green beans were so good!! My 3 year old loves green beans and she had 2 servings. The only thing is that it took a lot longer than 4 hours to cook so we had them the next day for dinner. I also added a stick of butter to the cooker, just because my mom always did that.

This was very good, but because I had to leave for work it all went in at the same time and turned out great. I only had one had hamhock from last Easter but it worked out well. I had to watch the amount of sodium in the recipe. All in all it was fond memories of my childhood.

These are the best green beans I have ever tasted....the only thing I would change is using ham chunks instead of the ham hocks as some of the other reviews suggested.

This was okay, but not too tasty.  I think I overcooked it because the beans came out somewhat mushy.  Also, it felt really greasy to me.  It made A LOT of beans, and I ended up throwing most of it out.  It was rather bland and I needed to add a lot of salt.  Probably won't be making this again.

OMG!! These were delicious!
I started them at work and cooked them throughout the day. It took a little longer to cook than the recipe said because the ham hocks weren't tender enough at the end of two hours so I didn't take them out when I put the potatoes in. I didn't have an onion either. 
I took them to a Thanksgiving dinner for the airmen that live in the dorm, they were a HIT!!!! I brought the crockpot home empty;)

Sorry...this was awful. Seemed like a good idea, but the garlic and ham flavors were NOT GOOD. Smoky & garlic DO NOT blend. My son liked it, but no one else did.  I threw it away. Next time I'll stick to my ham and potato soup dish when I have leftover ham.
