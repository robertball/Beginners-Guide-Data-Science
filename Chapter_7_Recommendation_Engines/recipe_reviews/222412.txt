Instead of using white sugar, I used one packet Truvia. I also used fresh lime juice. I didn't have crushed ice on hand but a quick run through the blender using the "ice crushing" button fixed that. Very smooth, very refreshing.

I might make this again if I can't find a better recipe.  As for the newly designed allrecipes, it  sucks.
