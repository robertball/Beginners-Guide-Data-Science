Just as advertised, very easy and ritzy.  As usual I made a few small changes to the recipe.  Our son was home from college with a group so I had to multiply and as the number changed, I changed the principle method of cooking the chicken from pan to oven.  The only thing I would change is how to handle the cheese.  Camembert is very similar to Brie which could be used.  I wasn't sure how to handle the corn starch skin.  I reasoned the corn starch would become incorporated and add to the thickening.  It didn't.  The next time I thought I would heat the cheese separately and add it to the green onion butter mixture, don't. Next time I'll trim the cheese "skin" and have a snack while cooking.  This recipe is a keeper, quick easy and kinda fancy.

What a delicious meal, and so easy to make. The mustard in the sauce added that extra flavour.

I used brie (rind removed) instead of Camembert, and the sauce came out smooth, rich, and very tasty with a hint of spiciness from the mustard.  I also used only 2 chicken breasts and used the extra sauce over steamed asparagus spears -- DELICIOUS!

This is a WINNER. Rich and creamy with a great depth of flavor from the mustard, green onion and Camembert. This is a great low-carb dinner recipe too if you OMIT FLOUR and use HEAVY CREAM(it will thicken itself,if you cook down) instead of milk. The "star" of this recipe, is the avocado, so I wouldn't skip that. Nicole Jansen, this is excellent! If I wasn't doing low-carb, I wouldn't of changed a thing; esp. the Camembert.  Thank you for a different,delicious, quick and great- for-company recipe!

Very quick and easy!  And so delicious.  I followed someone else's suggestion and made less chicken and used the rest of the sauce over cooked asparagus...oh to die for!  We will definitely make this again.

Excellent and easy!  Rather than make the sauce in a separate pan, I removed the chicken breasts from the frying pan, deglazed with a little wine, then continued with the sauce, adding more onion that called for.  Delicious!

This was so so good and the avacado just made the dish.  The only downside was that I had to learn to get everything prepared ahead of time.  But it was great.

This sauce was nice. In some of the reviews, some said it was too mild -- if that's the case, definitely use the camembert and NOT brie, as camembert has a stronger flavor. And, you could just add a bit more of the cheese. I had problems with the flour leaving lumps... probably my fault since I'm not good at flour mixtures. As with other reviewers, I found the avocado to be the highlight of the dish. Also, I just used frozen, breaded chicken from Costco and cooked it in the oven, served the sauce on top. Worked great!

I didn't have coarse grained mustard so I used spicy brown.  I used 1.5 tsp instead of 1 tbl mustard.  I breaded and oven baked the chicken.  Be sure to use Camembert and not Brie.  The Camembert is what makes it so good.  I was surprised with how well the avocado went with the rest of the dish.

I made this last night, and my family loved it!  They thought it was really "fancy".  My 12 year old even complimented me on the presentation!  I made a few changes--I browned the chicken breasts in about 1 TBSP of butter and a little canola oil.  While the chicken was cooking, I sprinkled the breasts with chicken fajita seasoning (we just love the variety of flavors in this seasoning!).  I could not find Camembert cheese, so I used brie.  My kids won't eat avacado, so I left that out on their portion.  We used the sauce on our asparagus as well.  My 16 year old wants me to make it with cauliflower next time, because he thought the sauce would be perfect on it.  I thought it was great!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent.  I won't make it a lot only bc of the amount of calories and bf's not a mustard fan, so something I'd be making only for me.  I'm glad I only made one piece of chicken or I'd probably be eating more of it right now!  It is very creamy and rich and I love the mustard flavor with the chicken, cheese and avocado.  I don't have green onions, so I used chives, and I subbed mozzarella for the Camembert (I know, I know, but I REALLY wanted to try it and I forgot to buy Camembert at the store yesterday).  I'm sure it would be even better with the correct cheese.  Thank you!

Had Camembert Chicken at a pub the other night and loved the sauce so much i looked it up on here. I just wanted the sauce recipe. Got the sauce recipe and made a few small changes like a small amount of red onion instead of green and more cheese.
We had it on pork and steamed veggies, and was bloody beautiful. The other half refused to eat avocado but actually enjoyed the sauce even tho he doesn't like the cheese by itself...
Worked well on my veggies the next night too....thanks

Not my favourite.  I agree tht the sauce was kind of bland.  My parents, on the other hand, LOVED it.  They saved the extra sauce and used on fish later in the week. To me it was kind of boring.  I probably won't make this again.

Wonderful. I, personally liked it with and without the avocado. The Camembert cheese sauce was the best part. My 16-month daughter licked the sauce off of her chicken (she's not big on meat). The sauce and chicken reheated well and tasted just as good as the first day. 

The rest of the family also loved this. Definitely will make again.

This was OK for a different take on chicken.  The cheese sauce became thick fast and did not hold up that great for leftovers, but it tasted pretty good the day I made it.

This was nice except it was not very cheesy tasting. The mustard and onion were the strong flavours. Still prefer CRUMBED AVOCADO STEAK from this site.

This was a really great dish!  It was very simple to prepare.  The green onions gave the sauce a very fresh taste, and the mustard gives it a tangy kick that worked well.  The only thing that I did differently was that I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper.  The soon-to-be hus devoured it and advised me that it was on the make again list. :)

Extra points for simplicity. I was able to whip this together for our dinner while coming down with the flu. But the flavor didn't seem like anything special to me.

Very yummy tasting sauce! I made double the chicken so I thought I should double the sauce. It is a very rich sauce and I now believe less is more. I'm one of the only nuts on the planet that doesn't like avocado apparently so I left that out completely.

We all thought this was good, but not worth the 5 stars that many gave. I would give points for originality though. I found a bit bland. It was easy however- i might make again

Great &easy. Pound chicken breasts first so they cook evenly. Sauce thick so I added extra milk. Impresive dish and filling. I would serve with spinach salad. Brie works well and is less costly & easier to find.

The flour/butter base of this sauce made it taste too much like a basic gravy.  Next time I will try using cream and reducing it down.  The Camembert and mustard was a good combo, but covered up by the 'gravy' taste.  Husband said it reminded him of biscuits and gravy.

this recipe wasnt amazing, but it was pretty good. i used camembert, but i think that brie would have been better.

Great recipe.  I subsituted Brie for the Camembert motsly because our grocery store did not have Camembert...

It was VERY heavy but tasty.
