I made a few changes for the preferences of my family; I used yogurt instead of the milk and vinegar, honey instead of molasses, and 1/2 of the flour was whole wheat.  I found that I still needed about an extra 1/2 cup flour.  Caraway seeds give the bread a great flavor!

This bread had a really nice flavour, but the dough was extremely wet and sticky. I finished the bread off in the oven but even though I greased my bread pan, after 30 minutes, the loaf ended up burning and sticking to the pan and I had to scrape it out with a spatula. I would not make this recipe again, but I might try adding raisins to one of my favorite caraway rye bread recipes. I think it would have the same flavor without the mess.

This was so tasty, even good toasted the next day.  I used golden raisins, and increased the flour by 1/2 cup.  I also add a little gluten to all of my bread so that it rises nicely.  GREAT recipe -- I'll make it again and again.

It is a 5 star bread! Since I changed a couple of things, I gave 4, not to be misleading. I substituted raisins with cranberries, and used cane sugar instead of brown. Instead of a bread machine, I warmed up the sour milk mixture carefully and put 2 teaspoonfuls of active dry yeast then waited around 20 minutes. (I should've put the sugar in there too. Well, next time...) Then I mixed everything together and let the dough rise overnight. In the morning, I punched it down and put it in a loaf pan to rise again. In the evening, it was ready to be baked for 35 minutes. The next time, I will try 30 minutes. Very delicious recipe! Thank you.

I also used honey instead of molasses. I would add more sugar and caraway next time as it was a little bland. Used a cup of golden raisins. Made wonderful toast. Will def make again!
