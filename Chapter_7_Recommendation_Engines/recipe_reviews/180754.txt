Wow-what I thought started out as very interesting turned out to be just odd. Too many complex flavors here and very overpowering in all. My family did not like this one at all

Overall, I think there are too many competing flavors, especially with the added "zest" from the limes and oranges. It was a bit too much. Perhaps less zest and more juice would create a better blend of flavors. Also, if you make it as written, I don't think I would add the extra reserved marinade over the finished product. If you do, taste test first.

Delicious!!  Thought husband would be skeptical of the ham and pickles, but he thought they were great.  Prepared on the grill - fantastic!
