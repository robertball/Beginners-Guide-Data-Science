Absolutely perfect, we LOVED these in my homemade chicken noodle soup with dumplings...not slimy like when using premade canned biscuits and not fluffy like when using Bisquick dumplings.  These taste exactly like the dumplings you get in any restaurant, thick and a little chewy and just heavenly.  I used cold butter as I didn't have any shortening and added garlic salt and onion powder to the flour, and I did have to use about 3/4 cup water instead of 1/4 cup.  Just a note to all the nay-sayers out there, these DO NOT rise like those Bisquick-type dumplings, that's not the kind of dumplings these are.  These are completely submerged in whatever sauce you cook them in and are more like giant doughy noodles, they are not ball-shaped and don't sit on top of your sauce and get fluffy and airy on the outside.  Please note this before trying the recipe so you won't have different expectations.
1/17/12 - UPDATE: I recently won 1st place in a cook-off a local restaurant using this recipe in my Chicken & Dumplings entry. I never use shortening, using instead only real, unsalted butter and add a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the mix before adding about a cup or so of water :-)

fANTASTIC! I only had butter and olive oil to use instead of the shortening. Used equal parts along with garlic salt.  They were the best dumplings ever!

Loved these!!  I've always made the fluffy, Bisquick type of dumplings but always wanted to try a more "spaetzle" type.  The recipe is great, although I found that I needed more like a half cup of water instead of 1/4 cup in order to get the dough to 'hold' together.  I also  added a little garlic powder and some pepper and my family totally loved them.

Excellent dumplings!   When I pinched off the dough I rolled the dough into balls then dropped them in! These were fabulous in my beef stew and so incredibly easy to make!  Thank you so much for the recipe I will definately use it over and over again!

This recipe is just the way my Grandfather made them, but in those days lard was the thing. As for those silly city girls, these dumplings are NOT supposed to rise, hence the All-Purpose flour. Only the Self-Rising flour will make them rise. Hope this helps.

Good basic dumpling recipe.  But I had a lot of problems getting the dumplings thin enough which made them a little tough.  But, still a good recipe.

These were just what I was looking for, a flat, doughy, noodle-like dumpling just like Grandma used to make!  Excellent in my chicken and dumplings.   Used 3/4 cup of water, butter instead of shortening, and I threw it in my food processor to make it easy to mix.  Thanks!

Pat, Thank you for such a simple and delicious recipe! I have always had trouble making dumplings but had to try again. The dumplings came out great! A cross between a noodle which I liked even better. My whole family ate them up. I do suggest you roll them as flat as possible unless you like a thick noodle.

These are perfect dumplings!   I cooked the dumplings exactly like the recipe except I added 2 tablespoons of milk to soften my dough a little more.   For those who have not cooked dumplings before:  I cooked two large chicken breasts in about 5-6 cups of water with a dash of thyme, 2 teaspoons dried parsley, and large chunks of 1/4 onion & 1 stalk celery, and a touch of black pepper.  When chicken was done, I removed the chicken (allowed to cool) and discarded the onion and celery chunks.  I added 4 cups of store bought chicken broth to the pot (you want at least 6 cups of liquid as some of it gets absorbed), lightly stirred in the dumplings a few at a time.  I shredded the chicken and added to pot.  Salted and peppered to taste and added a pinch more parsley and a little garlic powder.  Served up with cornbread; it was an awesome meal!  Thanks for posting a dumpling recipe like my grandmother and mother used to make!

I followed the recipe for Easy Chicken and Dumplings but then made Pat's Dumplings to drop in the simmering broth.  These definitely need more water, at least 1/2-3/4 cup. The dumplings come out like flat noodles, not at all like biscuit or Bisquick dumplings, but I liked them.  I stirred them a few times during the first 10 minutes.  Then I put the lid on and let them simmer 10 more minutes. Next time, I will pinch off 1" balls and flatten them in my hand before dropping them in the simmering broth. I think it will be easier.

So glad I found this recipe for non fluffy dumplings!  I used butter instead of shortening and about 3/4 c of water.  The whole family loved it!  I will increase the recipe the next time because there were hardly any leftovers.

Awesome recipe!  I do not like the 'fluffy' dumplings and wanted to try this one.  I followed the advice of anothe reviewer and added some onion and garlic powder to add some additional flavor as sometimes dumplings can be a tad bland.  My husband declared them the best he's ever had!  This is a keeper at my house!  No need to look for another recipe.

I love the taste and texture of these dumplings (dense and doughy rather than light and bready)!! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used about 3/4 cup of water when making the dough. That seemed to be a little too much though, and I ended up adding more flour to make the dough less sticky. When putting them into the soup, I simply used my hands to roll the dough into a long rope, flattened it so that it was about 1/3 of an inch thick and then used kitchen shears to snip off pieces into the soup. The dumplings were a little irregular in shape b/c of that, but I expected/wanted that going in. I and the guests I had over for dinner loved them! Wonderful!

Easy to make and very good. I use in chicken and dumplings.  And, like another reviewer I made into 1" size balls and flattened with hands and dropped into the broth.  Will need to add extra water a teaspoon at a time to reach a soft slightly sticky dough consistency.  And, make sure to flatten very thin and evenly each piece.  Yummy!

These were very good.  I think I'll add just a pinch of baking powder next time to get a bit more loft to the dumpling.  It's almost like Cracker Barrel.. just not quite.  All in all, very easy in the food processor.  I, too, added about 3/4 cup water to get the right consistancy of dough.

These dumplings are wonderful. I made them tonight to use up some turkey broth. I only gave it four stars because I added some seasoning to it so it wasn't bland.  I added some onion powder, garlic powder and poultry seasoning to the flour and salt.  I just sprikled it in so not sure how much really. Gives a delicious flavor to the dumplings, especially when cooked in a good broth :)

It doesn't call for enough water.  I think double what it calls for is a good starting point.  Other than that, everyone loves these dumplings!

These are great soup dumplings, they are like hearty noodles. I have made these probably 15 times and have had to add extra water to get a soft dough every time, so dont get discouraged if you need to add more water they are still awesome!

This was exactly the dumpling I was looking for.  So chewy and dense, yet tender - fantastic!  I used them in the Slow Cooker Chicken and Dumplings on this site and just put them in the crock pot the last 30 minutes or so of the cooking time.  I had no shortening, so I used butter and put the mixture in my blender/food processor to cut the butter into the flour and salt.  Awesome results - I will definitely be making this again!!  I do agree with other reviewers in that it was a lot easier to roll this into one inch balls, flatten them, and drop them in the liquid.  And you really want to flatten them - the thinner the better!  Great recipe!

I was looking for the fluffy kind of dumplings my mom used to make, but these caught my eye.  I was not disappointed at all.  These were so yummy in my chicken soup!  And everyone in my family loved them, even the picky 7 year old.  This recipe is a keeper.

Loved the texture of these dumplings! I am not a fan of the fluffy ones. I added a little garlic powder to the mixture ended up using more water than called for to hold the mixture together. My kids loved it!

I tweaked it a bit like others did.  Added 1/2 of the fat as shortening and 1/2 as butter, used milk instead of water and just kneaded dough together then broke off chunks and dropped dumplings into chicken soup.  They sink first then when they rise to the top they are ready.  Excellent!!  Thanks Teresa for a great recipe.

I have made this recipe several times and I always have to use much more considerable amout of water although I follow the recipe to the T. They turn out delicious, but I'm wondering if anybody has the same problem. All in all makes great dumplings!!

I have never made dumplings before and I have very little experience working with any kind of rolled dough. This seemed very dry to me, so I ended up adding an additional 1/4 cup of water. it still seemed dry, but I went ahead and rolled it out. It did roll ok and the end result was wonderful. I loved the dumplings as did the rest of my family. I will certainly use this recipe again. Thanks for posting it!

These were nice dense dumplings like they serve at Cracker Barrel. I loved them. My husband hated them. He asks me now every time I make Chicken and Dumplings whether or not I'm using this recipe, he hated them that bad.

I really had a craving for dumpling's for my stew so when I saw this recipe and the many good reviews I was so excited to make them.  WHAT A MESS! The dough was so heavy, then I cooked them for the 20 min. and they were still raw.  You definitly need to add more water to the dough and probably need to use a food processor to mix it. I will stick to the fluffy dumplings that come from using bisquick!

The dumplings were just right, easy to make, I did use my food processor. I do wish I would have added more water since I live in the desert my dough is often dry, nonetheless, even though the dough was a little dry, the dumplings turned out perfect, I'm going to use this recipe from now on.

The simple recipe is perfect.  My southern aunt introduced me to the "slick" type dumplings.  Once you have these you will never go back to the drop style dumpling again.

It was very good. I usually make the biscuit dropped dumplings but wanted more consistency. The texture is very nice. I cut them into diamond shapes and called them "diamond dumplings" so the kids didn't question it.  They like these note than the drop dumplings.

This is so good that my family and friends literally insist on this recipe!  I have rolled it thru a pasta roller as well as by hand with a rolling pin -- It works great both ways.  We prefer to roll it out by hand on a flour coated surface.  This way, that extra flour transfers with each batch of noodles and then thickens the soup to a traditional stew type broth.    It always requires more water than called for.  I just drizzle additional water until the dough comes together in my KitchenAid.

Once you've had chicken noodle or chicken'n dumplings this way -- anything else will be a disappointment.

These are exactly like my mom used to make and SO much better than the trendy "throw a can of biscuits in there" solution!  pretty thick and doughy, very traditional southern style dumplings in my opinion! great dish, I've made these a few times, they are my go to when we are having chicken and dumplings!

pretty decent recipe - followed except added some chicken bullion to it and I pinched out drops rather than roll out and cut to save time. they cooked but the outside stayed kinda gummy like. some people really like dumplings like that but I dont - thats why I gave it a 4 star rating. this is my go to --- till I find one that I like better (since the kids & hubby did like it).

Absolutely perfect; exactly what I was looking for.  I have been making chicken with canned biscuit dumplings for years, and it was time to up my game.  I made these as written, using Butter Flavor Crisco and a tiny amount of onion powder and garlic powder.  They turned out very similar to the chicken and dumplings at a certain restaurant & country store.  ;-)

Great recipe! I end up adding about a 1/2 cup of water but that is it. My Grandmother always made chicken and noodles but I wanted to try chicken and dumplings. After trying several recipes this was the winner in my book.  Everybody raves over my chicken and dumplings made using this recipe and it is a highly requested dish for those who are not feeing good.(couple of times I doubted that people were really sick but just wanted some of the chicken and dumplings) thanks for sharing the recipe.

Added a little parsley flakes with garlic/onion powder, since I like them to have a little flavor.  Otherwise, great recipe! Really great in my made-from-scratch chicken soup. This is my go-to recipe for dumplings.

So simple and so good.  My youngest daughter likes fluffy dumplings, but the rest of us like rolled dumplings, and these are just about perfect.  Like others, I added a bit more water, but other than that, followed the recipe as written.

These were so easy to make.  I boiled a chicken in chicken broth and water.  I shredded the chicken and added in some penzey's chicken soup base then added the dumplings.  My husband said they were just like his grandmas.

I halved the recipe, but still ended up using almost a 1/4 c. water.  Like others suggested, I made sure to roll extra thin.  I stirred 3-4 times during the first 10 minutes.  These do not rise to the top, they are the traditional dumpling that cook in the soup or stew.  Not puffy.  They look similar to a large noodle, but have a wonderful doughy texture.  Just PERFECT!

I follwed the ingredients & directions to a T, but I wasn't able to get a soft dough.  I even added another full 1/4 cup of water ... and still with nearly working the dough to death, I wasn't able to get it to a point where I could even possibly consider attempting to roll out the dough.  I thought that perhaps I had measured something wrong or done something wrong, so I tried a second time.  Still, I couldn't get the dough to a point where I could even think of rolling out the dough.

These just didn't pull together for me, followed the recipe exactly. My son was the only one who enjoyed them :( . I'll stick with my other dumpling recipe.

This was a great recipe. I used more water, about 3/4 of a cup in all and used butter and olive oil. I also added seasonings like others suggested: onion powder, garlic power, pepper and oregano. They were delicious, but ended up tasting a bit like olive oil. That was ok, just be mindful of that if you are going to substitute olive oil for part or all of the shortening.

After reading the reviews on this recipe I decided to give it a shot.  I increased the water like a lot of other reviewers had suggested (it ended up being almost 1 full cup) and made my dough in a food processor as done by another reviewer.  In the end these were excellent dumplings.  I will definitely make again and would suggest to anyone to give it a try.

My first attempt for any type of dumpling and these were fantastic. Light and fluffy with the right mount of chewiness. Easy too! A big hit with my family.

These are truly the perfect dumplings!  They are SO easy to make and so delicious!   It definitely requires more water than the recipe calls for ~ just put little by little until the flour mixture is moistened. I have made them with butter, and by replacing half of the butter with olive oil and they turned out just perfect either way. They are the perfect all around !!

Very easy, and yes, just like Mom used to make.  I had to increase the water also, to not quite 3/4 cup.

These were so good! I took a leftover Costco rotisserie chicken carcass with most of the darkmeat and skin still attached and boiled it to make my broth. Stuck it in fridge till next day and strained out all the chicken parts and separated the good meat. Reheated broth and tossed meat back in. When it was at a good simmer I added the dumplings. They thickened the broth beautifully. The best Chicken & Dumplings we've ever had. You must try it.

These are fantastic dumplings.  Traditional and old fashioned - not at all like the puffy bisquick dumplings. I made these substituting the salt for garlic salt.  I did need to increase the water to about 3/4 cup. Rolled out just fine and cut nicely.  Yummy!

This turned out great for me.  But I followed the advice of adding almost 3/4 cups water.  I also added some leftover mashed potatoes that were seasoned with garlic and herbs.  It was just what I was looking for.  Nice and chewy.  These went in my chicken soup.  I did not have noodles so it really complimented the meal.

Excellent dumpling.  My grandmother used to call these "Strap Dumplings".  Great in squirrel potpie, other game meat pies, and beef stews.

This great classic dumpling had great flavor and texture. My only problem was not enough moisture in the recipe. I had to increase the water to a smidge over 1/2 cup to get the dough to stick together well enough to work with and roll out. Otherwise its a great tasting recipe that's dead easy to make!
