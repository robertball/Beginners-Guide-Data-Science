The chowder was the consistancy of milk. I wanted a thicker chowder so I added potato buds to thicken it. Wow! What a difference. Also, it tastes better on day 2. I am going to use this for Christmas Eve dinner.

Used left over lobster tails from new years eve dinner. ND gets some pretty large potatoes. I used 3. You will need to find something to make the soup thicker. I am a pretty big chowder guy. Flour works well or potato buds. I also added my own spices for taste.

This is good soup.  I really wish we got better, fresher, cheaper lobster here but I did find whole/cooked tails on sale which work great for this.  I added a pinch of Old Bay too.

It was my first lobster chowder.  It was delicious.  I changed it up because some people donâ€™t tolerate milk very well.  I put q cup of coffee cream instead of heavy cream, 2 cups of chicken broth instead of some of the milk.  Everyone loved it.

Make this  chowder when company is coming and everyone loves it.  One change I made is to thicken it up with a bit of  instant potato flakes, and as so many of us do in Atlantic Canada is to crush saltines and add to our finished chowder.
