I think this is a good easy recipe. The only change I made was using an 8x8 pan instead of a jelly roll pan (I wanted a thicker bar.) With doing that I increase the baking time to 35 minutes.

I am an experienced cook and baker. Love to try new recipes. Always follow the recipe - no shortcuts - especially the first try. This was the WORST recipe I had ever tried! While it was (finally) in the oven I decided that I would forgive the fact that it was awful to make if the results were REALLY REALLY good. They weren't. A huge waste of some pretty expensive ingredients. I wouldn't have given it any stars but I couldn't figure out how not to!

I first tried this recipe 4 years ago and found it again whilst looking for new recipes. I found this recipe very quick and easy and has consistantly given excellent results. This is a firm favourite when I make them up for charity events and coffee mornings. I always have someone who tries one with their coffee and then comes back and either asks to buy the lot asks for the recipe or asks if I will make them for them. They are a love moist chewy bar. I always omit the nuts and they still turn out wonderful.

It was okay but not my favourite. There was too little cinnamon the crust got stale easily and the chocolate kept breaking off. However it was nice and chewy inside which is what I like!

I liked this recipe. I don't see how others found it hard. It seemed quite simple to me and I haven't even taken basic baking yet in the culinary arts program I'm in.
