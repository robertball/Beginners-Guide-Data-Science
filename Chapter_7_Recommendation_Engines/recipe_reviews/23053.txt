This is in no way an authentic Japanese recipe for Sukiyaki. It's more of a stir fry.

Excellent!  This recipe was great.  I can't speak to its authenticity, but we loved it.  I was quick and easy to prepare too!  We made it with cubed chicken breast instead of the beef.  The sauce really made this recipe.  We may try it with a bit less suger next time, but it was good sweet too.  I bought yakisoba noodles at the market, prepared them in a seperate pan and then added them at the end.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  It is definietly worth a try.

Not authentic and didn't taste anything like the real version of Sukiyaki.

While it tasted fine(skipped the MSG), this is in no way Sukiyaki. A simple search on google would have shown that.

This was very good.  Since I don't keep MSG on hand, I didn't put any in the recipe and certainly didn't miss it.  Next time, I plan to cut down on the amount of sugar.  Overall, excellent!

As another reader noticed, this is a beef stir-fry and not Sukiyaki.  MSG?  Chicken broth?  Use dashi stock with soy and mirin instead, or better yet, buy some warishita (sukiyaki cooking sauce).

Whether or not this is real sukiyaki didn't really matter to me, I enjoyed this recipe regardless.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is lessen the amount of bamboo shoots (personal preference) and use low sodium soy sauce.

My husband loved this.  I've made it a lot because it's easy and quick.  Hamburger works fine if you don't have the sirloin.

Lived in Japan for four years. While this is not "Sukiyaki" (food snob version). Japanese make a similar dish. It's quick, easy and it's very good. I'll still call it Sukiyaki.

This is very tasty and has become a favorite of our family (also good with chicken).  It is a great meal if watching calories and fat.

This version of Sukiyaki is a wonderful recipe. It reminds me of the dish my grandfather would bring over when us kids were really young and very picky but we all loved this and would eat it all up. I do add a few more veggies, a bag of frozen deluxe stirfry veggies and it adds a little extra something. Love Love this dish!

I made this for my traditional Sunday dinner for my daughter and her boyfriend. We all loved it! What a great taste! The only thing that I did different was to omitt the MSG and green onions. This will definately be on my table again.

This is a nice base recipe! I added to & made improvements to it! I omitted the MSG as it is bad for you! I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I added two different kinds of frozen stir fry veggies. I added fresh bean sprouts &  yakisoba  noodles with seasoning. I don’t have the knowledge of whether or not it’s authentic but it was delicious!

My family loved it, especially my picky brother! Didn't use the bamboo shoots, instead cooked brown rice noodles and thin rice noodles, tasted amazing!

This recipe is almost identical to one my mom used to make except  she also added a package of  frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained. This always comes out very good but it is best if served immediately after cooking.

what you have described here is more or a Beef Dombori.  Or as Japanese call it Gyudon. Sukiyaki has a soy based Sauce is very broth rich in flavor. eatten with rice (not on rice) and often has udon (thick noodles) as  well as many other veggies.

Real sukiyaki or not, it was delicious. The only changes I made were to use a small can of bamboo shoots and added a can of baby corn. I also used alittle more corn starch for a thicker sauce and served it over chow mein noodles. My wife loved it.
