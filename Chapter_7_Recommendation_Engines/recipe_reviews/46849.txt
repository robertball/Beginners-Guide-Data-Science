I was looking for a new way to do some chicken leg quarters I had defrosted for dinner, and this was INCREDIBLE!! Needs to cook longer than 45 minutes though!! Also, browning the chicken under the broiler for about 5 minutes in the end gives it a nice crispness to the skin!! The sauce is WONDERFUL!! Sweet and tangy. We are going to try the same sauce for ribeye and chicken wings!!

very, very good!  great flavor, but it did need to bake alittle longer than 45 mins.  it also needs about 5 mins. under the broiler like another reviewer wrote.  i may try it with a little less water so the sauce isn't so runny.

I had imagined this thick sauce clinging to the meat as it baked, but it was more liquidy, almost like a braise, only not as much liquid as a braise.  The sauce was fairly tasty, but it seemed like the chicken just sat in it and the flavor didn't permeate the chicken.

Pretty good. I hate it when people change the whole recipe, but I was a bit nervous about other reviews saying it was bland so I added my litle touch. I added a couple shakes of dry mustard and dill weed(maybe 1/2 tsp?)and 1/2 tsp curry paste. Could have added more curry paste as I could not taste it. I cooked in my toaster oven at 375 degrees for one hour and 5 minutes. I put over rice and spooned the cooking juices over the rice. Turned out pretty good but may try to add other ingredients next time. Give it a try.

Not much taste.  My wife is from Hong Kong and didn't care for it at all.

The recipe doesn't say if you need to remove the chicken skin or not. I decided to leave it on, and the horseradish coating just slid off during the cooking time. The skin had a little bit of flavor but not much; the chicken meat tasted no different to me at all. Blah. Thanks anyway.

Followed the recipe to the letter but found it to be on the bland side in spite of the horseradish & vinegar.  Took way longer than 45 minutes to cook.  Not sure what size leg quarters would be baked in that time frame.

I made it, but not exactly as recommended. I made it with boneless thighs in the slow cooker for 4 hours. The only thing I added to this recipe was Sriracha and garlic. Came out perfect!

Very quick and easy recipe! I made using 8 chicken thighs, followed as written, and turned the broiler on for an extra couple of minutes to crisp up the skin at the end.  They turned out moist and delicious. The flavor was a little mild for us; I may add more horseradish or seasoning next time.

I made the sauce and marinated chicken for an hour. Cooked it in a covered, non-stick pan on stove top. The sauce was too thin so i added 3 tsp corn starch to it in a small saucepan, served over white rice. Super easy and becoming a favorite.

Really good. We liked the flavor much. Basted every 20 minutes,    turning chicken after each 20 minutes (80 minutes in all). Gonna keep this one in my favorites.

This was not at all exciting to eat, very bland. Based on other reviews, I omitted the water in hopes of concentrating the flavor - didn't work. I will not bother with this one again.
