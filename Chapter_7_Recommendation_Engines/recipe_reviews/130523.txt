This was wonderful. I made an extra loaf of pumpkin bread so I could make this. The rum sauce is what makes it. I added a scoop of whipped cream on top and it was perfect. The baking time seemed too short. I baked mine for about 50 min.

I had some leftover pumpkin cake that I used in this recipe and I omitted the sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet.  I think this is a versatile recipe that you could use other types of bread like cinnamon/raisin.  It was quick, easy, and delicious.  I will probably make about half the caramel sauce next time since I had so much leftover.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was truly great! I used the Taste of Home pumpkin bread recipe because it makes two loaves of awesome pumpkin bread, and for this to be a good recipe you've got to start with a terrific recipe for pumpkin bread. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because the amount of rum in the sauce is way too much for most peoples taste. You could easily use 2 TBSP of dark rum instead of 3. I ended up boiling the sauce in the microwave for 5 minutes just to boil off all the alcohol and give it a nice rum "flavor" instead of "god there's a lot of rum in this!" I also ended up diluting the sauce with a bit more caramel and heavy cream. So, truly a good recipe made better with a few adjustments.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I found the rum in the sause to be way too much for my personal liking. Once I deluded it, it was pretty good.

Good stuff. Turned out awesome. I made a caramel sauce and fresh whipped cream. MMMMMM. The only way it would have been better for us is if we ate it warm out of the oven.

My mouth is still watering from this recipe and so is my families.  I used the taste of home pumpkin bread recipe for this dish and it was mouth wateringly good.  I am making this dish ever holiday and maybe more.  I may be 500 pounds by the next time I log on here just from this recipe.  THANKYOU!!!!!

I found some pumpkin bread in the freezer and thought I would give this a try. I had eight cups so I went ahead and doubled it. My bread was really moist so I toasted the cubes to dry them out a little. I added 1/2 cup pumpkin puree to the custard mix with some pumpkin pie spice. Also sprinkled in some dark chocolate chips. Let soak for 15 minutes before cooking. I didn't make the sauce, I just splashed on some butterscotch snapps.  Update: I tried to do the sauce with fat free half and half and a vanilla  bourbon. It was too runny

I wish I could rate this recipe 10 stars.  I made this recipe with the Pumpkin Bread recipe by Shirley S. and one whole loaf was enough for a double batch.    Good thing, too, because it was unbelievable.  The only thing I would suggest is serving the sauce on the side.  The rum flavor was just a little overpowering for a couple of my guests; I personally thought it was very complimentary considering the sweetness of the pudding.  Overall, a phenomenal recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I used banana bread instead of pumpkin bread because I had a partial loaf that was starting to get stale.  The bread had nuts in it, which gave the perfect little crunch in contrast to the softness of the pudding.  Since my bread was plain, I added just a smidge of cinnamon and nutmeg to the milk/egg mixture.  I also cut down the sugar by half because bananas are so sweet already.   My husband and I both loved this recipe.  It is a great way to use up some leftover bread.  I can't wait to try it with some pumpkin bread!

Excellent variation on traditional bread pudding.  I made a few minor changes:  used agave syrup instead of the sugar and baked for about 45 minutes.  It wasn't done after the suggested cooking time.  I think it would be great with dried cranberries added too.

I found this to be delightful! It's not difficult to make and the combination of the caramel and rum flavors is great. It's not too soupy or soggy. I'll make this one again for sure!!!

It is so good, yes, you need to like rum to enjoy but if not, reduce the amount or use a bottled flavor rather than alcohol?  It would work well with banana bread too, or sub whisky!

This was delicious!  The caramel rum sauce is the clincher.  I made it like the recipe, but went ahead and used my whole loaf of pumpkin bread, so I was generous with my other ingredients as well!  Yum!

This recipe is so easy! I never thought to use pumpkin bread, and it came out perfect. The consistency was exactly right, and the sauce added a great touch of sweetness. Thanks for the great recipe.
