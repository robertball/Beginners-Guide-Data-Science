This is a good recipe.  The secret when making homemade mayonnaise is to pour the oil slowly while the blender is running.  If the oil is poured to quickly or the blender is not on a high speed you get an oily mess.  It is simple if you follow that simple rule.  If you use olive oil it will have a strong taste, if you use canola oil it will be more like traditional mayonnaise.  The most important thing though is this is the type of mayonnaise that you get food poisoning with if its left at room temperature because of the raw egg.  DO NOT TAKE A POTATO SALAD TO A PICNIC AND LEAVE IT OUT.  If you are going to a picnic use commercially prepared mayonnaise.

I like this recipe so far but switch out the mustard and the lemon juice and replace it with white wine vinegar at least 2 tablespoons of it. and leave out the garlic

This might be totally out of the box for mayonnaise, but I used Eggbeaters and it turned out great!  I added more garlic also, as I'll be using the mayo in a salad dressing, and it is also great.  I may never buy mayonnaise again!

I called the Eggbeaters company to find out how much to use to equal one whole egg. Answer: 1/4 cup equals one whole egg. If you need it, the equivalent of one egg yolk is one tablespoon of Eggbeaters. I like the safety of using a pasturized product instead of raw egg for this recipe. By the way, the Eggbeaters representative told me that Eggbeaters can be used to make ice cream!

The trick to great mayonnaise is adding 1 tsp cold water because it spaces the fat molecules thus creating a stronger more stable emulsion.  Thank-you NY Times for that tip!

This is a great mayonnaise recipe.  You need to use the blender to get it thick, and slowly pour the oil in.  I used just a little garlic juice, from a jar of minced garlic.  And I used white vinegar instead of lemon juice.  Perfect when you are out of mayonnaise and don't want to go to the store - as any cook knows, "miracle whip" is no substitue for real mayonnaise in a recipe.

Excellent homemade mayo.  Simple to put together.  I followed as written, was very impressed with the creamy texture!  The flavor of the oil does come through, so be sure it's one you like!

Well, it smelled like mayonnaise. I mixed mine in the Kitechenaid with the wisk. Maybe it would turn out better in a blender. Mine turned out runny and didn't taste that great. It was green/yellow in color. I think I'll stick to prepared mayonnaise.

I did it! I had doubts that I could actually get it to work, but I did it. And on the first try, too. The flavor is 
good, not what I was expecting but better than the store bought.

A stick blender is key in this recipe...thank you to all those who suggested it!  I made several attempts to make this in my blender, and became increasingly frustrated with each greasy, gloppy end result (after slowww pouring of the olive oil).   "The stick blender makes it in less than one minute. Place all ingredients in the bottom of a tall narrow container that your stick blender can fit easily in. Place blender all the way to the bottom, turn on and slowly raise the blender. If any of the oil doesn't blend right in, just move the blender up and down to incorporate!"  Thank you to Cynthia for the recipe and Robinm for the stick blender idea!

This is a good recipe! I doubled the recipe, used 1/4 tsp of ground mustard instead of the prepared mustard and 2 cups of canola oil.  I used my immersion blender to make this right in the jar.  The secret to getting this to emulsify is to make sure your ingredients are room temperature.  I add the oil slowly pouring from my measuring cup. I no longer use store bought mayonnaise. I am going to try this with different herbs also.  Thanks for a good recipe.  Oh... for those of you who want the miracle whip taste add 1 - 2 TBS of sugar... this will sweeten it up.

Try using a hand-held stick blender.  Just put all the ingredients in a clear glass cup.  Put the head of  the blender on the bottom of the cup, then lift slightly off the bottom, and start blending.  It takes seconds for it all to come together.  As it blends, slowly raise the head of the blender to incorporate all ingredients together.  Keep blending until it is smooth and creamy.   This technique is so much easier and faster than using the blender!!!  Also try using dijon mustard.

Could I have about 25 stars??? This is the best stuff ever.  We had a bad craving for Creamy Italian Dressing I  from this site, but no mayo.  I whipped this up in less than 3 minutes with a stick blender.  I used canola oil and added a pinch or two of paprika.  Also white pepper.   At first I was kinda disappointed since it seemed thin but we flippin loved the taste.  Checked it out this morning and it's perfectly thick.  I have died and gone to mayo heaven!   Thank you sooo much and thanks also to those who suggested a stick blender.

This recipe was awsome, I totally messed up the part where you add the oil slowly, as I had heated it beforhand, this prevents the eggs from separating. well the mayo still came out perfectly! I also added chopped parsley to the mix to give it extra flavor. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was very bland and flavorless. I had to add salt. It was also quite pale and a bit limp. I think I prefer the Julia Child recipe, which is essentially the same as this one, but with the addition of two egg yolks, a bit more oil, as well as carefully measured salt and white pepper. I added Julia's two yolks, some fresh tarragon from the garden and it was much better. Remember to use pure olive oil, not extra virgin, as that will harden and separate in the refrigerator.

If you use pasteurized eggs in this recipe, you won't have to worry about getting sick from it. :)  Homemade mayonnaise makes all the difference in the world in potato salad!

Used this as a basic recipe. Did not add all of the garlic, used one clove pressed. I used 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2 white vinegar and added a touch of wasabi oil, turned out wonderful.

This was excellent!  We had chicken burgers for dinner and realized I had no mayo for the buns.  I looked up this recipe and made it.  It was so quick and while I was afraid it wouldn't taste like "real" mayonnaise, I was pleasantly surprised!  It looked and tasted just like real mayonnaise.  I think we'll be making our own from now on and save some money!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

What a fun recipe! I never would have thought to make my own mayo (always assumed it'd be too tedious or time-consuming), but my mom was talking about tuna sandwiches and home-made mayo being a childhood treat, which got me thinking . . . and with this recipe, discovered it is neither tedious nor time-consuming! On the contrary!!!!

I added a tad too much garlic (not a bad thing in and of itself—in fact, normally a GREAT thing in my book—but if using the mayo for a recipe that wouldn't use garlic, might be an issue), but otherwise, was an incredibly easy, deee-lish recipe!

I used 1/2 c. canola oil and 1/4 olive oil and ground mustard, and my Cuisinart food processor to make the mayo. The cool thing about that is that the food pusher/plunger thingy of my Cuisinart is hollow, with a hole on the bottom; turned upside down, I was able to pour the oil through it, thus being able to control the speed at which I added the oil. Have to admit, this was a tip mentioned in the Cuisinart manual, not my own "discovery!" ;)

As someone else said, I'll never be without mayo again! (well, unless I'm out of eggs, or oil . . . ) Thank you for sharing this recipe!

turned out great just as written with the blender.  I liked that it used a whole egg instead of the yolks.  The texture was smooth. I've al;ways been too chicken to try making mayo.

For a stand alone mayonnaise to use on bread, I find it a bit too garlicky (and I LOVE garlic and lots of it, but this was just too much), so I'll be cutting the garlic quite a lot, BUT as it is here in the recipe I find this mayonnaise makes the most incredible potato salad when used in that. My potato salad made with this mayonnaise gets rave reviews and now I get requested to bring it to meals. :)

This was very good. I can see many possibilities to add different herbs/spices specific to the recipe you are using this with. I used a mini food processor but the immersion blender works the best as you don't have to pour the oil in slowly. You just add all the ingredients and blend.
I used ½ cup grapeseed oil and ¼ cup roasted garlic grapeseed oil. I didn't add the garlic. I used lime juice instead of lemon. Next time I might try making this with the egg beaters.

This was very easy and turned out terrific.  I cannot have soy or milk and love tuna and egg salad.  Used this for the mayonnaise cookies also.  Very good.

Mine was kinda runny. I added the oil super slow as I read to do in other mayo recipes... I dunno. It was probably user error. I don't like mayo but I need it for recipes sometimes. It's a very useful recipe for someone who doesn't normally have it in the fridge.

Got my cabbage shredded for cold slaw for lunch and realized I had no mayo.  At home on a lunch break so I did not have much time.  Found this recipe and had all the ingredients so I got out my Vitamix and followed the directions and it came out great.  I used half EV olive oil and half Pecan oil I had.  Turned out pretty darn good and the slaw is excellent.  I'm working on it right now as a matter of fact.  I very much like the fact that I know exactly what the ingredients are in my Mayo!  I won't be buying any more store bought and will also try some of the other recipes.

I have tried to make mayo before in the blender and it was upredictable whether it would emulsify or not. 
This time, I put the egg in warm water first (i didn't want to wait for it to come to room temp), and I used the stick blender. It was amazing! I'll never use the blender again. 
The flavor of this mayo is really good too!
Thanks!

This was so easy!  I took the advice of another reviewer and just dumped everything in my immersion blender jar, blended for 30 seconds, and voila--mayonnaise with the same texture as store bought.  The only thing I don't like about mine is that I used half melted coconut oil and half olive oil; the taste of the olive oil is pretty strong.  It still tastes good and next time I'll try extra light olive oil.

This mayo ROCKS!  It is nice and thick and doesn't use xanathan gum or other thickeners for the right consistency.  The garlic... thank you!  The pepper... never thought of that one, but AWESOME.  My children LOVE it, I LOVE it.  This mayo is a HIT!

This is sooo good! For the garlic & salt part, I mixed equal parts of garlic powder & salt, then I used 1/4 teaspoon of it. I also only used a spot of mustard the size of a pencil eraser. No more store bought mayo for me! Thanks for sharing.

Made this last night. While the taste was great the color was off. But I think that was my fault. Will make this again with half as much mustard and a different method for streaming in the oil. Thanks!

I just finished making this.  I had to make a change to it due to lack of lemon juice.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 T. of apple cider vinegar.  It was not as thick as other recipes I have used which was good. It has a good taste and I plan on using it to make some deviled eggs for dinner.
Over all I think this is a really good recipe.

My husband & I recently started the True Food lovers program and one of the steps is to become a label detective.  It is truly amazing how many additives and preservatives are added to store bought mayo.  This recipe is AMAZING! (I actually used eggbeaters as one reviewee suggested and wow!)  My kids and husband can't get enough.  Remember the trick to making this recipe perfectly, is to add the oil, REALLY slowly to the eggbase in the food processor.  I WILL NEVER BUY STORE BOUGHT MAYO AGAIN (at least try :) Thank you for this amazing recipe.

5 stars for: Dependable and Delicious!  It has a great taste and thickened perfectly! I needed mayo for some open-faced sandwiches so did this quick fix! I added lots of pepper-different kinds and I'm sure it could be dressed up with other spices. Thanks for the recipe!

This sounds very good. BTW bitch'n kitchen I read recently that it is not the mayo in potato salad that spoils, but the potato. I want an oppinion on weather to use EVOo or regular olive oil.

Great idea.  Don't get hung up on the garlic or mustard.  This is versatile enough to try lots of different flavors for different dishes.  I made it with Wasabi for a burger.  A couple shots of tabasco for a chicken wrap?  I'm also a firm believer in my cuisenart blending wand.  Finest kitchen tool made.

I just made this recipe, followed it exactly (used olive oil) and I regret to say it had a very bitter after taste.  It looked good, was nice consistency but picked up a bad taste.  Not to sure where the bitter came from... the yellow mustard most likely..  if I try it again I will try it as one person suggested, swapping out the mustard and lemon juice with white wine vinegar.

I just finished making this, I used olive oil and it tastes disgusting. Now I've never made home made mayo before so I really don't have anything else to compare to but store bought (which is why I rated 3 and 0). But the flavor of this is really gross. It firmed up just fine, and was easy to make but the taste is bad.

Best recipe I've ever tried for mayonnaise! It was a little thinner than I hoped it would be, but still a fairly nice consistency. And I agree with some of the other reviewers that it is a little garlicky (but still good), so I plan to use a little less garlic next time. I've never actually found a recipe for mayonnaise that I liked though, so this is a first! I will be making it again I'm sure.

bahhh. it was sour... but i could play around with the recipe and find the right flavors... but it would be nice to know exactly how much salt to add... i found the lemon juice too powerful. i also used an immersion blender  - i do for most things.... such easier clean up!

I had never made mayonnaise before, growing up hearing all kinds of horror stories of course.  I wanted potato salad tonight, and did not want to drive 10 miles to the nearest grocery store when I discovered an empty mayo jar!   EXCELLENT the first time.  It went perfectly with my potato salad.  Thanks, Cynthia and Allrecipes for this one!

I want to say thank you so much for sharing your recipe. Long story short I realized I was all out of store bought mayonnaise when I was making my hubby's lunch. My daughter started looking online and came across your recipe. We love it! I will never buy store bought mayonnaise again. I mixed all the ingredients in the blender then I added  the oil slowly while it was blending. The whole recipe was perfect!

I really wanted to like this, but it tasted very mustardy to me.  If I try it again I will definitely use half (or perhaps none) of the mustard.

I should have prepared myself. This is not Miracle whip that is for sure. and I am sure it would have tasted better if I had not used olive oil. I think I will experiment with it again though maybe use vegetable or canola oil and some sugar. But thank-you for teaching me how to make mayonnaise. :)

This mayonnaise turned out really nice. The mustard brings out a beautiful yellow tone. I used white vinegar instead of lemon juice as some suggested. Really loved this one. Makes about a cup. You have to be very careful about adding the oil though.

This was very easy to make and is a good basic recipe that you can easily cahnge or make additions to. I ommitted the garlic, used 1/2 tsp mustard and 1/2 tsp w/w vinager and I added dill, cayenne and chillie pepper.

Took me 3 tries to get this right...of my own doing.  First try was w/ food processor.  The mixing required for this recipes warrants a blender on high.  Second try failed as I did not pour the oil slowly enough.  Third try, superb!  I did add a pinch of sugar and substituted lemon juice for vinegar.  Thanks for sharing this Cynthia.

I thought for sure I'd have an oily mess, but even though I used a food chopper and added the oil a little at a time, it still turn out great!! I got a little happy with the minced garlic but that's OK cause I love garlic! Thanks for posting this recipe!

I've never tried homemade mayo before, but this was a snap. I added a bit more lemon juice and only used 1/4 tsp minced garlic. It was perfect. It is key to stream the oil in slowly while blending/processing to allow it to emulsify. So easy, I may never buy mayo again!

Try this, use only the egg yoke and if you have time beat using a fork instead of the blender. I dunno why but the flavor is totaly different. Time consuming but worth it. Small amounts of oil each time while beating.

All I wanted was a tuna fish sandwich!  Ran out of mayo so tried to make my own (I have lots of cooking experience and all the tools...but never made mayo before, we live in Japan too so going to the store isn't like back home).  Ended up with an egg-nog looking dressing(!!!???).  Didn't have more oil so couldn't make it over.  Oh well...guess I'll have a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich instead.  :(

I saw in a previous review where the reviewer noted that the pusher in her food processor has holes in it! I used the pusher to pour the oil through, much better emulsion.

Last batch I used half corn oil and half olive oil and I did not add any salt or pepper. It was a double batch so that I could flavor one batch with my home made chili sriracha sauce. I also did not have lemon juice but had fresh limes.

This is so good, and so easy with a food processor. It’s a great basic mayonnaise recipe that you can tweak to suit your own taste. I made it twice, once with Dijon, once with powdered Keen’s mustard. I like the one with the Keen’s better. Next time I’m going to add wasabi powder! I used a pasteurized egg (which you can’t buy in Canada as far as I know—I pasteurized it sous vide).

This is a fantastic recipe! I made it exactly as written with organic olive oil. I used my stick blender, and it came together in 2 seconds. My kids and husband love it. Way better than store bought, which I will never buy again. I've even used this to make thousand island dressing. Omg, so good.

HAWT dog! This is Ahhhhmazing! I planned to make potatoe salad but ahh! I didn't have any mayo. This saved the dinner! Thank you for sharing this. I also followed the advice of slowly blending in the veggie oil (I used grape seed oil) as well as using the juices from my canned minced garlic!

Can anyone tell me the secret to making mayonnaise?  I have tried a blender, also a hand blender yet all I ever end up with is a yellow colored oily mess that smells like mayonnaise but is nothing more than eggs and oil.  I've tried making it several times and always get the same results even though I add the oil very slowly and have the speed on high as everyone recommends.  It doesn't get thick or white or look anything like mayonnaise.  That is the only reason that I am giving this recipe one star.

Made this with my stick blender as one reviewer suggested. I have two blender cups that came with it and they allow you to really use the head of the blender. I will use extra virgin olive oil and see how that works. Added a bit of cumin and some Siracha at the end and made tuna salad for my lunch with it.

My daughter and I each have a serious problem with one ingredient in commercial mayo, and of course, not the same one.  One style in one brand worked for both of us, but our local stores quit carrying it.  I tried this recipe twice with EggBeaters and both canola oil and olive oil dumping all ingredients together in the stick blender cup.  It was almost too easy!  Nearly instant emulsification.  Tuna salad and cole slaw can be shared again.  Thank you to the recipe sharer and the reviewer who suggested the stick blender

Won't use EVOO next time.  It's too strong.  I will try a milder oil.  Overall it came out ok.

We ran out of mayo' so I decided to make me own for the first time--I'd say it's definitely cheaper than buying it. Tastes just like store-bought mayo! Although next time I won't add as much mustard(I'll try half). Didn't add the garlic(wasn't really in the mood for "aioli"). Added 2/3 of a tbsp of white wine vinegar. Used corn oil instead of vegetable oil(I don't use vegetable oil-has quite a bit of pesticides in it). And I can't stress this enough--add oil slowly. Maybe tsp by tsp, no need to measure it out, but "eye it".

I can't believe how incredibly easy this was!  My deviled eggs are going to be incredible for Easter dinner!  I think the mustard is a little strong and will cut that back the next time I make this.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fun recipe and my first time making mayonnaise.  I used two cloves of garlic, put whole into the blender, which made it hot and very flavorful.  The kids didn't care too much for it :).
