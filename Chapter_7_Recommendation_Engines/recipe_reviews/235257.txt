This is a moist, well balanced quick bread with a nice punch of cinnamon.  The batter will be thick, so be careful not to overwork it in the bowl.  I was able to yield two 8"x3.75" loaves with this recipe, perfect for snacking and gifting.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a good base recipe but I thought I needed to be a little less sweet, a little more pumpkin-y and have a little more spice. I made this as muffins rather than bread. Decrease the sugar to 1/2 + 1/3 c (I actually used 1/2 c Truvia + 1/3 c sugar, and it turned out beautifully). I decreased the chocolate chips to 2/3 c. I used 1 c + 3 tbsp of pumpkin puree, which added moisture as well as pumpkin flavor. I added 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and the juice of a 1" piece of fresh ginger root.

I like this recipe a lot. Mine came out moist and just sweet enough. I like that the recipe calls for butter, and not oil. Works great with gluten free flour (whichI used).. . I also used the william sonoma mini loaf pan and tented with foil, half way through cooking. My cooking time was only 25-30 minutes (I have made it twice now). 1 hour is way too long for my oven. Kids love.

This is a keeper! Threw this together last night because we had company coming. I doubled the recipe and made one loaf and used the rest of the batter in a muffin pan. I used one cup of cranberries and one cup of chocolate chips. I added a few extra spices that we all enjoy and a little vanilla. This was a hit with everyone. I will be keeping this recipe on hand to use again.

Absolutely the best Pumpkin bread I've tasted.  I used mini semi chocolate chips and love small bursts of chocolate while eating it. I give this recipe 5 stars.

Moist, flavor-filled, autumn-perfect quick bread! I followed the directions but added a little more pumpkin and cinnamon. Rather than 1 large loaf, I scooped the batter into two loaf pans. Baking time dropped to about 30 minutes. The top of the bread loaf was just perfect. (You know how it can over-bake while you’re waiting for the inside to bake!) I’ll do this one again!!

I used two 8x4 loaf pans and cooked it about 30 minutes.  Very delicious and great for gift giving!!  I want to try using the whole can of pumpkin but need to figure it out since the recipe calls for only one cup.  Anyone try that yet?

Didn’t have pumpkin purée but substituted a jar of Trader Joe’s pumpkin butter, used cannabis butter and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  Deliciously out of this world!

Unfortunately, worst pumpkin bread I have ever tasted. The pumpkin flavor did not come through at all, and there was way too much cinnamon.  Couldn't even finish it.

This bread did not have a real pumpkin flavor, it tasted more like a rich chocolate cake. Still, was quite delicious and super moist.

I've made this twice. The 1st time I followed the recipe, the 2nd (pictured) I used raisins instead of chocolate chips.

This was delicious.  I used fresh pumpkin as my puree.  The only changes I made were to add a teaspoon of vanilla and a little less cinnamon.  My husband and I loved it!

Great recipe.  Super easy.  I added chopped walnuts and added a little different texture. Kids and adults both loved it.
