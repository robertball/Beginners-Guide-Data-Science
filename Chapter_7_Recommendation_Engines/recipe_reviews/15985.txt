I like to try and make things low-fat and healthy so I take recipes I like and alter them.  This was a perfect example.  I used 1 egg and 4 eggs worth of egg substitute.  Butter is still healthier than margarine so I stuck with that.  I also sprayed the dish with no-fat cooking spray.  This dish STILL comes out fantastic and much more lowfat and heart-healthy.

Update: 11 years later and this is STILL a favorite Thanksgiving dish! I've started using 4 eggs and SOMETIMES adding some crushed buttery crackers. It always turns out great, it all gets eaten, and I love it so much!

The only thing I changed was that I only used 3 eggs and I thought it was AMAZING! When I ate it, I did add salt, but I'm a huge salt lover so that's totally a "to taste" thing.  For those people who made comments about how this was "too much corn"... it's called CORN PUDDING... of course there's a lot of corn!  If you don't like corn, this recipe isn't for you!  If you like corn... enjoy, it's amazing!

This is a wonderful recipe if you are looking for a true sweet corn pudding that has a custardy consistency.  When I made it, I discovered at the last second that I had no cornstarch, so I substituted 1/2 cup flour and it still came out great.  I also substituted frozen corn for the canned corn kernels -- just filled up one of the empty creamed corn cans as a measure, and added 1 tsp. salt.  It does make a LOT, however, and is not easy to cut in half since it calls for 5 eggs, so it would be best for a crowd.  Absolutely delicious and addictive; even my son who doesn't eat vegetables had seconds.

I gave this three stars because the recipe should state that it needs to be made in a FLAT 2 quart casserole.  The first time I made it, I used a flat casserole and it turned out perfect.  My mom made it for christmas dinner this past week, but used a bowl type casserole and baked it for the full amount of time and it was very very runny.  It looked like it was cooked through until we served it.  Very disappointing the second time, but I will continue making it using my flat dish.

This is a great recipe. I made it once for Thanksgiving and now my family asks me to make it every year!  One way to make it even easier is to combine the cold milk and the cornstarch and stir out the lumps before adding to the egg mixture.  This saves about 5 minutes of whisking.  Other than that I make the recipe completely unaltered.

I made this as directed and it was excellent!  Thanks to reviewers who offered preparation tips, I mixed the cornstarch easily with the cold milk before adding the butter and sugar.   I melted the butter ahead of time, so I could add it at room temperature.  I also took the eggs out of the frig about an hour earlier so all ingredients would be about the same temp.   I added a pinch or two of ground nutmeg, as an earlier reviewer recommended.  I used the best ingredients I could find, including Green Giant White Shoepeg Corn, which is vacuum packed in the can and crunchy like fresh--with no fluid to drain off.   I substituted one tablespoon of the sugar with dark brown sugar, and baked the pudding in a flat Corning casserole, a rounded rectangle measuring 11 by 9 by 3.    It cooked beautifully---and in 50 minutes!   Looked like the photo, and tasted like my departed grandma's!   Not too sweet, packed with corn, held together with a tender sweet custard!   Awesome!

I have been making this exact recipe for over 10 years.  The only difference is that I use 1/2 cup of sugar and a dash of vanilla.  I also DRAIN the can of whole kernel corn.  This may be the reason why some people said they had "extra" liquid.  This is a much requested dish from family and friends throughout the year.

This is one of those trick recipes that makes people believe you are an old country cook who really knows your way around the kitchen. I will make this again and again.

I was surprised when the dish came out of the oven because I was expecting something more like corn pudding instead of a just corn side dish.  There's nothing in the recipie that adds a bread-y layer you'd normally find.  It's a good recipie, but not necessarily one for corn pudding.

yes! I live in Cambodia so I needed to find a recipe that would not have complicated ingredients, not cost a fortune, and not waste my ingredients by tasting bad. This was the first thanks giving meal ever for many of the people we invited over. Several people brought food but this dish was the TOP PICK for the night! Everyone wanted to know how to make it and now I have to make it for Christmas and probably every other event too! We couldn't buy can corn so I bought cooked street vender type corn and cut it off the cob measured in the cream style can.. it was just right. Not egg-y like some reviews said. sweet and tasty!

This wasn't what I was looking for.  It was a little to "eggy" for me.  Kind of like a corn quiche.  I had some corn pudding at a party the other evening and it was more firm and didn't have so much egg taste.  I'll keep looking.  This wasn't bad, just not what I wanted.  I'll see how the left overs taste tomorrow.

This was super good but the first time I made it I had to bake for a lot longer.. Maybe because of the dish I used, not sure. But I won't mark down just because it doesn't specify what type of casserole dish to use like I saw another poster do, which is just ridiculous. But I did say 4 out of 5 stars because the next time I made it, we tossed in a box of that Jiff Corn Muffin Mix just for the heck of it and found we loved it by for the best that way. Just a little bit firmer but tastes pretty much the same and with that in it, is 5 stars and my husband is obsessed with it. Started out a holiday dish and now it's a whenever he begs enough dish.

I changed this recipe just a bit to make it a true "soul food" pudding..I cut the eggs back to 3 and instead of milk I used 3/4 cup evaported milk. It smells delicious while cooking and I bearly get it to the table before it's gone...

My only change was to add 1/2 t salt and mine was done cooking in 50 minutes.  It turned out great, just how I hoped!  Not as rich and wonderful as my grandmother's which features heavy cream, but very yummy and much lighter so more acceptable to cook on a regular basis.  To those who have only had "corn pudding" made with cornbread mix, this is quite different.  It has a custard-like texture from the eggs and is somewhat sweet.  This is a real corn pudding and in my opinion much better than the corn bread mix based ones.  Thanks :)

as is, i would give this recipe about 4 stars. i made it using only 4 eggs but following everything else for thanksgiving, and it was pretty good. its a 5+ star recipe with the following changes that i made for last night's xmas dinner: -use only 4 eggs -before adding the cans of corn, mix in 5Tbs of cornmeal (gives this a slightly stiffer consistency, but not as dense as the recipes using muffin mix)-add about 1tsp of vanilla -strain the can of whole kernel corn well to reduce water content -bake in a flat, glass casserole dish -before popping it in the oven, sprinkle a dash of cinnamon and some nutmeg on top. 
ot decrease fat content, i substituted margarine for butter, splenda for sugar, and used skim milk. 
with these changes, the recipe is amazing! got rave reviews from friends and family... yum!!! (edit- made this again for t-giving this year and totally forgot to add the butter! it came out amazing anyways, and i think i'll permanently cut out the butter from this recipe in the future!)

***NOTE Video...if you watch the video for this recipe,"Recipes in Motion", the presenter only adds one, that's,  "1", can of creamed corn...This is basically my Grammy's recipe, but with a pinch of salt, and tsp of vanilla added,...3 eggs instead of 5, and heavy cream or even Half n Half in a pinch, instead of milk...IF you make it with ONE can of both corn and creamed corn, it will be much more "cake like" in consistency...NOT DRY, but "SET"...This is a fantastic recipe, So I gave it 5 stars because in my opinion, it would be wrong of me to bring down the overall rating of this recipe, when I didn't even try it, BUT, it is also JUST MY OPINION that if you use regular milk, and 2 cans of creamed corn, as written, it will be soupy....I could be wrong, but just wanted to give y'all a heads up...WATCH THE VIDEO...

Please note that the video says drain the can of kernel corn.  The written receipe does not say to drain.  It should be drained.  The video also says use 1 can of creamed corn, the written recipe says use 2 cans.  Use 2 cans.  Good recipe if you make these alternations.

I made no alterations to this when I prepared it, and it turned out wonderful. This is a sweet corn pudding, unlike most of the ones I've tried on here that call for cornbread mix or onions and peppers. It's almost desert like, but not too sweet. Great dish when you don't feel like putting a lot of effort into dinner, but want impressive results.

Love it!  Traditional corn pudding recipe, truly just like grandma's.  I cook it in a 13 x 9 glass baking dish so that it sets up well.

My guests and I loved it!  I used frozen whole kernel corn due to the salt content in the canned vegetables.  I advise not to do that.  Use the canned because the frozen stayed too firm.  It was still very delicious and easy to make.  Thanx!

I agree with ATLMICHELLE who wrote on 12/28/07. I followed the recipe carefully but used a deep casserole.  Even after cooking it an additional 20 minutes at 400, it was still too soft in the middle. I'll try the flat casserole next time.

Delicious!  I made this for Easter & everyone loved it.  It did need to cook a bit longer than the recipe stated.  I also drained the whole kernel corn (not stated in recipe either way).  Otherwise, perfect!  The folks who think it's too eggy are obviously not familiar with true Southern corn pudding.  This really was just like Grandma would make!

Love this recipe! So easy, and delicious. I have brought it to a few holidays and everyone raves over it. The only thing I change is using 4 eggs instead of 5. My husband complained that with 5 eggs it was kind of "egg-y", haha. I have tried it with 3, 4, and 5 eggs and we agree that 4 is the best. Definitely try this recipe!!

LOVE this recipe!!  It such an easy and inexpensive side dish and great for holidays, too.  I actually leave out the sugar entirely and it's still super sweet because of the sugar that is added to the canned corn and creamed corn.

This is really good, I used 4 eggs, canned milk and added a pinch of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and it was delish!!  My family gobbled it up!

This was SO good. I used one can of creamed corn and 15 ozs of frozen sweet corn.  My husband ate about half the pan - so that means it was good. It was very sweet, but not too sweet. I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious! Just made it today for Thanksgiving. I followed other reviews and used 3 eggs *instead of 5 ) and a 9x13 casserole dish. Will definitely make it again.

Made this yesterday for Easter dinner.  Followed the recipe exactly.  We all loved it!  It wasn't too sweet and didn't have that corn muffin mix taste, that so many recipes have now.  This is REAL corn pudding!!  Very custardy, warm, comfort food!  Definitely the real deal!  Will make this again and again!!  Thanks for sharing:)

I hosted my mothers 50th birthday party, and my whole family enjoyed this.  I think I added a little less then the 1/4 cup of sugar, and it was perfect.  Everything else I followed to a T.  UPDATE!!!!  Made it again, made it early and covered it, warmed it after still covered and it came out mushy and not nearly as good.  SO DON'T COVER IT UP!

After having corn pudding in a restaurant, my daughter wanted to have it at home.  This was even better than the restaurant.  Then, I made it again, but froze it in small foil pans before baking.  Thaw overnight and bake as directed for an hour. YUM!

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times I had to let it bake 10-20 minutes longer than the 1 hour indicated in the recipe. The second time, I used a 50/50 mix of white and brown sugar for a total of about 1/3 cup, which I thought tasted better. Overall, this is very easy to make.

This recipe makes a delicious, custardy pudding. I use brown sugar instead of white, and heavy cream instead of milk. I find that I have to cook it a little longer for it to set properly. This is not for the calorie and/or health conscience, but boy is it delicious!!

I made this to bring to Easter Dinner along with the 4 cheese scalloped potatoes from this site.  This was very good.  I made it exactly as written.  I was very wary of this as I really hate creamed corn and was worried it would be awful but I was pleasantly surprised.  Everybody liked this (even me) and I'll be sure to make it again.  I think I baked it a little longer than suggested so it would brown well on top.  I didn't get real brown but it was very good!  Thanks, Lisa, for a keeper.

This was fantastic! Took it to Thanksgiving for 18 and everybody raved.  I agree with several other reviewers, too eggy, my solution was to double the whole corn and it was perfect.  Came out perfectly golden brown too.

This is a great recipe, I did cut back to 4 eggs and add 1/2 corn muffin mix with a little more sugar (1/4) cup, but it was a real hit, not too sweet but very nice texture! Just drain the corn real well.

Everyone liked this dish and had 2+ helpings.  The only thing I would do different is cut back on the amount of butter.  I had to take a paper towel to "sop up" some of the grease from the top.  Also, I realized that I only had one can of creamed corn, so I put 2 cans of whole kernel and only one of creamed and it worked fine.  I also didn't have cornstarch, only self rising flour, and had no problems using that.  This was simple to make and enjoyed by everyone.  Thanks!

OMG!!! That's all I can say. Made this tonight for my first time making Christmas dinner for the family. Everyone LOVED it. Good thing I actually doubled it in 2 pans, because even with 9 cornish hens, potatoes, and green beans, it was ALL gone with 6 adults. I have now been ordered to bring it to every family dinner from here on out, including our new years dinner on the 30th. I've never had corn pudding before so cant compare it, but it was delicious.

I had jumbo eggs, and since I did read a few recipes complaining about it being too "eggy" I only used 4 eggs. However that was probably the equivalent of 5 regular sized eggs so I do not think it would make a huge difference. I'm personally not a huge egg fan so I was a little worried but all it did was give it a good custard-like texture IMHO. I also used sweet corn for the whole kernel canned, and I drained the can first. A while into it cooking, I happened to look up and noticed my timer was frozen at 59 minutes (THANKS TIMER!) however when I checked on it an hour had likely gone by and the top was nice and golden brown. It also sat on the stove for a good 2-3 hours covered in aluminum foul while the potatoes and hens cooked but it stayed nice and warm and potentially set and became the perfect texture and consistency. I'm normally a salt-with-my-eggs-and-corn type person, but to me this was just nice and sweet enough that it needed no additional seasoning.

This was easy to make and turned out great! I used three extra large eggs and took other advice and mixed the milk and cornstarch first. I also used a 9 x 13 glass baking dish. This was a big hit for us and will definitely be in our favorite collection! Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous! I love it just as it's written, but it's also easy to customize to make more healthy, with less sugar and fat. I can close my eyes eating this and be in my Grandmother's house again as a child. Thank you for this!

I tried this recipe twice. I only made four servings each time.  The first time I used two eggs instead of 2 1/2 eggs and it did come out eggy and a little runny even though it crusted nicely.  The second time I used one egg and cooked it longer.  I tested for doneness by inserting and taking out a toothpick in the middle of the pudding to ensure that it was set (like you do with cakes).  The 2nd time came out better (less eggy and runny) and it was well received.  Infact, the only complaint I received (the second time around) was that I didn't make enough of it.

Definitely the old fashioned country recipe for corn pudding.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar, and I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  All of my friends at the holiday cookout raved about the recipe, and I've had four or five recipe requests already.

This is a great corn pudding recipe. I do however put in fresh or frozen thawed corn in replace of the 1 can and I also like to add a cup of cheddar cheese to it.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was just a bit on the "too sweet" side. So this year I only used 1/4 cup milk and substituted the other 1/2 cup with sour cream (12 servings). It made all the difference in the world and was delicious.

A big hit at home and for potluck! Stirred cornstarch into the milk before adding to miture, it saved A LOT of time!!! Used 4 eggs instead of 5.  Used two 8x8 disposible aluminum pans to ensure pudding was cooked all the way through.   Everyone loves this recipe!!

Not impressed at all.  And 5 eggs is way too many- it tasted more like scrambled eggs with corn than corn pudding.  Will be looking for a new recipe.

Was definitely good but too sweet and eggy for me.  I may make this again with 1-2 less eggs and about half the sugar.

I scaled the recipe to 20 servings, and cooked in two disposable pans. The cook time took WAY longer than directed. I ended up with the ham and turkey completely carved, tapping my foot, waiting for the custard to set. It looked a little greasy, I think when I make this again I will cut back a bit on the butter. Tasted good, though. 4 stars, only because I felt inconvenienced by the cook time. Will most likely be using this recipe again.

I used four ears of fresh corn and 5 tablespoons of yellow corn meal with four eggs. I also added a generous dash of nutmeg. Awesome and really beautiful!

I've had corn pudding, and this is not corn pudding. It is corn quiche. Way too many eggs and I even cut it down to 3 eggs instead of using 5 as the recipe calls for. Also, it doesn't need as much corn as the recipe calls for. Corn pudding should be smooth (like pudding!).

This is a good side dish, but I agree with two others. There is no bread consistency that makes you think of real corn pudding and it is more like a quiche without cheese. I at first thought it was undercooked and cooked 15 mins longer & no change. Now I see the other reviews and it's just how it is. I don't think I will make ths again for corn pudding.

I've never made or eaten corn pudding before but this sounded so good, I decided to give it a try for Thanksgiving.  I made only minor changes based on other reviews: used one less egg, mixed the milk and the cornstarch before adding the milk to the mix, and added about half a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix.  It was really excellent, a little sweet, a little rich, just right.

I made this for a party and it flew off the table with RAVE reviews. I cooked it in big foil lasagna pans, doubling the recipe for each pan, so it did take quite a bit of additional cook time. The result was worth it!

Make it as is.  Tried other variations and they were not as good as the original recipe.  Just make sure whole kernel corn is drained or use frozen.

Very good, was exactly what I was looking for!! I did have alot of liquid in the bottom of the dish,though, and are wondering what I did wrong. I made the casserole the night before, refrigerated, and cooked the next morning before church. Maybe that was the reason. Other than that, taste was wonderful and not a bite was left.

AWWWW! corn pudding. This was good. I also had a little problem with the baking dish. I used the disposable aluminume pans and it was a little runny and eggy. However,next time i will use a glass caserole dish. It is a hit with my kids and my husband. We loved it. Thank you for posting. We will make again!!
Many Blessings to you and yours from me and mine.

This is not a pudding.  It is a loose, flabby custard.  Decent flavor, but terrible texture.  A MUCH better recipe is posted here as "Easy Corn Pudding".  It holds together like a dense, moist bread, not like this eggy concoction.

Made this as a side for family Christmas dinner this year, and it was very good.  I followed some of the reviews and added vanilla and nutmeg to the mix and added the corn starch to the milk before adding to the egg mix. Used the flat glass baking dish as suggested and it worked perfectly.  Found out it is even better served with Maple syrup.

this is exactly the way our family has made it for multiple generations. We use 3 cans of corn and 3 cans of cream style. sometimes use 2 tbl of flour instead of cornstarch. We also like to leave it in longer to get the top good and brown.

Being a relatively proficient cook and dietitian, I made changes. Corn is naturally sweet, so eliminated the sugar totally, used 1/2 the butter; added 3 Tbsp greek yogurt; and added 1/3c. diced onion, with 1/2 can green chiles.

I really enjoyed this recipe, however my dish may have been a little deeper than expected.  It took me an hour and a half to set.  I wasn't sure it was even set then.  It worked out great though.

Guys, this is the real deal. I have been looking for YEARS for a fantastic traditional corn pudding recipe without all the complications and this is it. I halved the recipe {using 3 eggs} and put some cheese on top and it was perfect! Word of warning: it is a custardy dish [as it should be], so if you're looking for something more like cornbread, keep lookin. Cheers!

I have looked and looked for a recipe that tastes like my grandmother's.  May she rest in peace now, but this brings back so many memories for me, thank you!  I am one of the few in my family that eat corn pudding and she always made it especially for me, now I can cook it for my kids and carry on the tradition!!  It is perfect the way it is!

Made this for the first time to take to a potluck and everyone RAVED about it. It was really good, but I do think I would cut down at least 1 egg next time. Was great as-is, I just prefer a slightly dryer corn pudding. One review suggested cutting down to 3 eggs, but I'm concerned that would be too few. Next time I make this I may throw in some corn meal to give it a breadier texture. Overall, a good recipe if you've never made corn pudding before.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it travelled well.  I let it cool about fifteen minutes or so from the oven, then fastened the casserole lid shut with rubber bands and put it into an insulated carrier.  It arrived at the table still hot a couple hours later, nicely intact, and was well-received by everyone.  It's good the next day for leftovers, too.  I'll probably make it again next year.

This is just like my mom used to make and I have searched and searched for the recipe. I love this dish and yes it is definitely a comfort food. Now I have to have it for every Thanksgiving dinner. For Christmas you can add green and red bell peppers, it fits the holiday and changes the flavor to make it more savory.

Was the hit of Thanksgiving. Like other posters mention,  it is more of a custard than what you would get from the recipes that have corn meal in it. I personally prefer the more cakey style but everyone raved over this recipe and wanted it.
   I made exactly as recipe stated with the addition of a bit of vanilla extract, bc it suited my taste. 
  I think it will be a holiday request from now on.

The recipe does NOT state you should drain the corn. a recipe with so few ingredients that leaves out such a crucial step. My was too runny.

Made for Thanksgiving using 2 cans whole kernel and one can cream corn.  I also left out the sugar and I'm glad I did. It doesn't need it. I also added green onion. Everyone loved it and asked me to make again for Christmas.

The flavor was really good, just not the consistency - it was too runny and I even drained the corn. I did use a regular bowl type casserole dish though, so that I'm sure was the problem. The next time I do make this I will take the advice of another reviewer and use a flat 2-quart casserole dish instead.

I used corn that I froze this summer, about 5 cups of which I creamed about 2/3 in a blender. I added a small amount of salt because the frozen corn had none added. It was delicious!

I've made this recipe twice. First time, exactly as posted and it was very good. No complaints whatsoever. I just made a few changes for my personal taste the 2nd time. I only used 3 eggs and was worried it might be to soupy, so I did as AngelM82 recommended, used a package of corn muffin mix. I think I will continue to make it the 2nd way and that's only to reduce the eggs. Both ways were raved about at our Thanksgiving dinner. Thank you for sharing. Note to self. Make 1 1/2, never double. Way to much even for potluck

Tremendous - rivals a 3 generation handed down recipe and is more consistent and got rave reviews from the family. I did increase the whole kernel corn by 50% and used skimmed milk.  Augmentations of Onion, red & green sweet peppers diced or bacon or sausage crumbles would be interesting additions to the flavor.

Made for Thanksgiving dinner. No one liked it. I don't consider this a pudding. It was like corn suspened in eggy gelatin.

A classic, custardy, rich corn pudding.  I find that for the holidays it is well recieved if a bare inch of nutmeg is sprinkled over the top when serving.

I made this for a side dish at Christmas dinner and it was a hit! The consistency wasn't bready like the other corn puddings, it had a creamy custard like taste. The flavor was wonderful and wasn't overly sweet.

So easy! Made this as is, no changes, and with 10 ppl over for dinner it was loved by all! I would mix the cornstarch with a bit of cold milk and then add, rather than try to whisk into bowl.

This recipe lives up to its name!!! After my grandmother passed away, no one could find her corn pudding recipe and I tried this out of desperation. The reaction at the dinner table the first time was, "I thought the recipe was lost!?" This is my go-to dish every Thanksgiving!

I have made this recipe several times for friends and family get togethers, and always end up having to give the recipe out. I should start keeping copies of it available, it is wonderful!  I, as others have, sometimes cut back by one egg, and use half the sugar, and it's still good.  And I have never had a problem with it being watery or runny, as some people have mentioned.  Makes me wonder if they're draining the whole kernel corn, or if their ovens cook at a lower temp.  It's always come out perfect for me!!!

I make this for holiday dinners and everyone loves it!  I cut down on the sugar a bit because it is very sweet.  You can make ahead, wrap tight with newspaper and towels, it will stay warm for a couple of hours!

WOW!  I made this to go with our Thanksgiving dinner and it was fantastic! Everyone loved it.  I baked it (almost) exactly as directed and used a flat glass casserole dish. The consistency was perfect and it turned out creamy, yet firm and lightly sweet. The one difference I made was to use frozen corn instead of the canned corn. I did use the canned creamed corn though. Anyway, this is now one of our all-time favorite recipes. Thanks!

A good basic recipe for an Old Classic.  However, I added 1/4 cup instant corn grits, 1 tsp salt and reduced the eggs to 3, and reduced the sugar to 3 Tablespoons [corn is already pretty sweet -- you want this to be a Side Dish, not a Dessert] -- now, THAT tastes like true Southern "corn puddin'"!

I followed this recipe exactly and made it for a Thanksgiving dinner. My husband always raves about his mom's corn pudding. He took one bite of this and said it was just like his mom's! This is a definite winner. Know that there is no breading in this (not a cornbread consistency). It is wonderfully sweet!

Overall this was a crowd pleaser, not too sweet and the cooking time was perfect. It also traveled well. But it was to buttery, way to greasy. Next time I'll cut out half the butter. It was also too eggy.

Wonderful and how I remember my grandmother's corn pudding. I only use 2 eggs in mine. Grandsons demand this every time they come over for dinner. Sometimes I add a half cup more or less of grated mild cheddar.

I omitted the sugar altogether, added 1/2 cup baking mix, 1 small onion minced, 1 1/2 TBS chive sour cream, 1 Tbs. parsley and sprinkled some more on top.  I had something else in the oven at 350 for an hour and it worked great.  This recipe will replace the Jiffy mix corn casserole that I have always loved but can no longer use, due to the gluten.  Thank you so much for bringing corn pudding back to our table!

SIMPLE AND YUMMY!  Our whole family plus guests loved this side dish.  I made no changes except for using canola oil instead of butter.  The five eggs boost the protein level of this dish, which is helpful when you have a big family and need to stretch your meat budget as far as it can go.  

Did I mention it was SIMPLE and YUMMY?

I am a corn pudding addict, and this is by far my favorite recipe. No muss or fuss. Super easy and custardy - NOT runny! I want to eat my corn pudding with a fork.. Not too sweet, and is wonderful at room temperature with hot sauce! Goes amazingly well with any Mexican dish. Drain your can of corn kernels (NOT the creamed corn) before adding, of course, and stir corn starch into milk before adding to egg mixture to make your life easier. Also, I substitute two tablespoons of Truvia for 1/4 cup of sugar, and use 1% milk. So much healthier than some other recipes. Only 109 calories per serving this way! And so satisfying. Thank you for sharing, Lisa.

This is how my grandmother made corn pudding.  The instructions don't state this, but you MUST drain the canned whole kernel corn (or use a 16 oz. bag of frozen - which is what I do).  Whisk the cornstarch into the milk before adding to the eggs and butter for lump-free pudding.  And bake in a 9 x 13 casserole dish.  Much to the chagrin of my family, I only bake this twice a year - Thanksgiving and Christmas - but it's so easy, it could be made any time.

This is a good recipe!  The only thing I added was some sauteed onion, bell pepper and garlic.  Otherwise I kept the recipe as is.  It baked a little quicker in my oven.  Served with saucy BBQ country ribs and cole slaw.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  For years, my grandmother had made "baked corn" that we all loved.  Unfortunately, we never found the recipe. This is what I remember.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I was nervous it wasn't done after the hour, and left in for another 10 minutes.  So, mine was slightly overdone!  Wonderful recipe, so happy to add it to my box!

I made this recipe for thanksgiving. It was a huge hit. I added shredded cheddar cheese to the top during the last 10 minutes of baking. It was so delicious.

taking some tweaking, started with basic recipe, added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, used frozen corn with jalapeno pepper, 4 eggs, not 5, substituted sour cream for milk, added 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar. was a hit today but I will continue to tweak, actually want to switch to 9x9" glass casserole vs. 9x13, looking for more moisture - a blend of 'pudding' and 'souffle'

Taste is there but...can I say...there is too much corn! Could do withour the whole kernel corn. No texture. Might try again without the whole kernel corn.

I am addicted to this recipe. The folks in my church love this recipe for corn pudding. Every time we have a dinner at church, they ask me to make this corn pudding.  They say it is the best and it reminds them of the corn pudding their grandmothers made back in the day.

This is  very good southern corn pudding.  Delicious. The only thing I changed was leaving out one egg.  Four eggs worked fine for me.  This came out perfectly done and light and fluffy.  Just like my Nannaw used to make.  A definite keeper.

Seems like a traditional corn pudding.  Family commented it was not as sweet as some.  I considered that positive as I did not intend for it to be a dessert.  Great side dish and super easy to make!

I used one of the reviewers suggestion and cut the eggs to 3. My family loved this. Next time I would probably cut down on the sugar, might try Stevia. Definitely a keeper!

Easy to prepare and delicious. Definitely comfort food.  I replaced ALL the eggs with egg substitute and the taste didn't suffer.  I also tossed in some frozen corn to stretch it a bit when I found another guest was coming to dinner.  But the basic recipe served the table of 8 with seconds.

This corn pudding is very good. I had never had any before. I was inspired to make it because of a Geico commercial that features the cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn saying his Aunt Jenny's corn pudding could sink you like a rock. This is defiantly not heavy. I drained the corn like other reviews did and it turned out perfect.

This is now a family favorite. I make it for every holiday. We love it. An added bonus: it's naturally gluten free as long as you use gluten-free creamed corn. Green Giant is GF.

This is very similar to what my Grandmother used to make but I didn't have her exact recipe. I do remember that she used coarse cracker crumbs made from regular saltines. Next time, I'll cut the corn starch in half and throw in 8-10 crushed saltines to see if I can replicate Grandma's recipe.

The only missing ingredient is corn meal mix. Add a cup or so and it would be perfect. I like corn pudding to be almost bread like. Without the corn meal mix, this was borderline watery. Very thin. But still had a good flavor.

Run to the pantry, pull the ingredients and then bake this fabulous side dish for your next church pot luck.  I did make one change however.  I used Pet Milk in place of whole milk...five stars!

We have never had corn pudding so I didn't know what to expect. It wasn't bad but just not something that I really liked. Two of my kids liked it though.Mine turned out very thick and rich though, not runny as some.

This corn pudding was pretty good, but it was a little bland to me.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg and that made it better.  Next time I think I'll add a little more butter and maybe some brown sugar.

This is delicious both hot ans cold.  It has a custard texture that other corn puddings I have had did not.

Really good recipe! Even my picky eater who won't eat corn at all ate this right up! Will be making it again and again. Thanks for sharing it!

this is my favorite recipe on this site. I literally keep it a secret and my family requests I make it for every holiday. This recipe is seriously perfect as is and SO EASY. The only tip I have is to whisk the cornstarch into a small bit of milk and to let the milk hit room temp so that it doesn't re-freeze the butter (it makes this kinda gross consistency, though it still turns out fine after baking).

Oh, a couple tips;
1 - let the milk and eggs come to room temperature so it doesn't chill the butter
2 - mix the corn starch with just a little of the melted butter. Then it won't just clump up in the full mixture

This was my first attempt at any kind of Corn Pudding. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8 x 8 glass dish.  I used 2 eggs, but halved all other ingredients, adding 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg as suggested in other reviews.  My spouse and I thought it was fantastic.  We at almost the whole thing.  I might try a few other recipes on this site for Corn Pudding, but I think this one is a keeper.

Good comfort food.  Served it with ham.  It is a little bland.  I might add something the second go round.  It cooked up nicely, good consistency.  We had it yesterday with family and my husband is already wanting to have it again at home.

I had been using my mother's corn pudding recipe for years, but it was misplaced when we moved.  I've been hunting for a simple corn pudding recipe with a custard base, without any cornbread mixed in, and this fit the bill perfectly.  The only thing missing from the recipe was 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  I will definitely make again with those small changes .  Other than that, the sweetness was just right.

This was my first time making corn pudding and it turned out fantastic! I took it to Christmas Eve dinner with the family and had absolutely no leftovers.  I followed the recipe except I used the shoepeg canned corn like some others had suggested. I just really wish I had remembered to mix my corn starch in with the milk first like recommended by another review but I'll make sure to do that next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving several years ago, and have made it every year since ... my husband always asks for it, and everybody really enjoys it.  When made as written, though, I did think it was not quite firm enough and needed a bit more flavor, so over the years I've tweaked it a little.  I leave out the milk, cut the butter to 4TB, increase the sugar to 1/2 cup, and add minced onion, dry mustard, and seasoned salt.  With or without these small changes, it's worth 5 stars.

I was looking for something to take to a group dinner and found this.  I didn't add anything that the recipe didn't call for but I did only use 3 eggs since mine were very large and I only used half the sugar since I'm not a huge fan of sweets.  I kept it very hot until time to eat and then I took some to try when we ate and I must say that I thought it was just good.  Then when I tasted it again after it had cooled down I truly enjoyed it. Yum.  I will always let it cool down before serving again.  So glad I tried it later, that's why it gets 5 stars now. The sweetness was perfect with only half the sugar.

I made this but I added 2-3cups of white cheddar, some white & black pepper, garlic & onion powder, few pinches of salt, and some sautéed onions & garlic and it was too DIE for! My family couldn't get enough. It was literally the first thing to vanish! Great recipe but even more delicious being sweet/savory!

This recipe is delicious and my family likes it better than the standard corn casserole. I did change the can of corn to frozen premium white and yellow corn and think that made it even better.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was unique and good.  It's as if you are eating a custard pudding with pieces of corn throughout.  Other reviewers mentioned that it had too much corn, but I disagree.    I think it's a good and super easy side dish to make for Thanksgiving or Christmas.

PERFECTION!  Don't do a thing to this recipe!  Remember you have to like corn and eggs.  I love comments that say it's too eggy!  Well duh, it has 5 eggs in it!!  If you are looking for a more bready corn pudding, search corn casserole!  Thank you for the recipe my family loved it!!!

Surprisingly good. I tried it on a whim and it's amazing. I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk and I whisked the corn starch in the cream before adding to the egg mixture which saved on five minutes of whisking. My family loves this recipe and it's a great comfort food.

This recipe is so good! I made it the first time at Thanksgiving and then was asked to make it again at Christmas. This now takes the place of the usual scalloped corn we made for years and years. I do want to experiment with making it a bit healthier but haven't made any variations to it yet.

I made it exactly as described on Thanksgiving and it was good but indeed a bit too "eggy". Made a 2nd one with 4 eggs, added a lil vanilla extract and a tad more sugar ( more than 1/4 but less than 1/2 and it was DELICIOUS!! I've made a pan each week and it's perfect! Had a friend who used to make this for me and now I'm so excited I can make my own whenever I want. Super easy and I'm no fan of the kitchen so that says A LOT!

I added two tsp. of NUTMEG, which gave the pudding more flavor, somewhat like baked custard.

3.5 stars: We liked this recipe, but several people at the table had a problem with the custardy texture.  I stirred it real well and it was better.

This recipe did not turn out well.  It had little to no flavor.  It was just a big mush.  I only gave it 2 stars as a couple of my dinner guests thought it was okay.  I would recommend trying a corn pudding recipe that includes corn muffin mix.  That is the recipe I meant to use instead of this one.

Four stars only because the pudding is unnecessarily (?) bland.  A good jolt of black pepper might be very helpful.

This was really good!  A lot of people reduced the number of eggs but we found 5 to be the perfect number.  We also added about a cup of shredded Mexican cheese blend cheese to the mix.  Next time I'd like to add more cheese, chopped jalapenos, and cut the sugar in half.  One of the cans of creamed corn we opened was really old and gross but I didn't notice until I'd dumped half of the can into the mix.  We used a slotted spoon to scoop out as much as possible (as we were low on a few of the other ingredients and couldn't start over) so we ended up adding only about a can of creamed corn.  No biggie -- the pudding was still excellent.

This was wonderful.  Exactly like I remember my Grandmother's corn pudding.  I used egg substitute instead of regular eggs and evaporated milk instead of regular milk and added just a touch of nutmeg before baking.  The consistency was more custard like than corn puddings with corn meal which was what I wanted.  If you use egg substitute, use the the equivalent of 6 eggs.

This will be a standard recipe in my personal cookbook from this point on and it a VERY cheap dish for large groups that is always well received. The only thing I do differently is just use flour instead of cornstarch and use all whole kernel corn. Make sure not to overbake it!

This recipe is good and worth the make if you are o.k. eating all that fat.  

I spooned butter off the top when it cae out so I suspect you could cut back on the butter and it would be o.k.  

I don't like unclear recipes.  It doesn't say to drain the corn and it doesn't say you should put it in a flat 2 quart pan.

I thought this was good but won't be making it for a long time since it is so rich and fattening.

I have been searching for a good corn pudding recipe and finally found it.  I made this yesterday for a 4th of July gathering and everyone raved about it.  The only thing different that I did was add two cans of whole kernel corn and only one can of creamed corn since that is all I had on hand.  Make this, you won't be disappointed.

Really Good! I added some more sugar b/c we like it sweet. It was a bit "wet" for my liking so next time I think I'll use 2 cans of regular corn and leave out the creamed.

This was very good!  I didn't make any changes.  Corn is one of our favorite sides and I have to say that the consistency of this is like a custard but if that is the kind of stuff you like it would be great.  I think we just found another awesome keeper.  Great to alternate with a few others that we really enjoy.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was wonderful.  I made 40 servings and got nothing but complaments from the entire room.  I added a little butter to the top of the mixture before baking.  I will definately make it again.  Taste just like my grandmother's.

I made this recipe for my friends who are from England. It turned out wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly without any problems.  I had such rave reviews even from my picky children who do not like to eat their veggies. I doubled the reciped and it still turned out WONDERFUL. I definitely have to give this recipe 5 complete stars. thanks Lisa for sharing this with us!

This recipe is great!  I make it often, even though I am pretty much the only one in the house who eats much of it.  I put butter on top of it once served on a plate to make it extra-decadent.

I don’t know if my first review went through or not, so here it is, maybe again. This was wonderful! I used some of the tweaks from the comments (added Jiffy Corn Muffin mix and some nutmeg). I think even without those it would have been excellent!  I think I’ll use a 9x13 next time. I can’t wait to try it with some sharp cheddar and jalapeños. As everyone around the table said tonight, “Ten out of ten!”

This is an excellent side, a great twist to your traditional corn sides (especially for Thanksgiving!) I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing was that it took a lot longer to cook than suggested... almost had to double the time, may have something to do with my oven, but just be prepared for the length of time it may take. Will definitely make again!

Yummy! Family loved this at Thanksgiving dinner. As I was preparing this I realized it didnt call for ANY seasonings! I added salt & pepper and onion powder and garlic powder to taste. Maybe a tsp of each. It turned out great! Used a foil 8x8 baking dish & had a little extra that didnt fit.

Disappointed.

I came here to learn technique for an authentic old school, slow cooking yummy dish.  Since cans, and prepackaged mixes are never what I look for in a recipe especially one that says it' Grandma's Corn Pudding, well you lost me halfway through. My grandma didn't use canned creamed corn. 

I wanted authenticity; you offered me a can. Just thinkin' : this  is so not it.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Have made other Corn Puddings before, but this is my favorite. I did substitute 1/2 Flour for the Corn Starch (didn't have any) and it turned out perfect. One other change, this recipe produces too much volume for a 2 quart dish. I used a 13x9 glass casserole dish....Perfection!

I've tried a number of corn pudding and corn casserole recipes over the years. This was the best yet! It tasted like Grandma used to make. Thinking I may swap one of the cans of creamed corn for one of whole kernel corn next time.

UPDATE (1/2/17):  I made this recipe again with only 3 eggs and I added one more can of regular corn.  I got lots of compliments on it and it's been the closest to my great aunt's so far!  Excited to have a "repeat recipe"!
------------------
I have been looking for a corn pudding that wasn't very bready and actually 'pudding-y' like my great aunt used to make.  Unfortunately, this still didn't fit the bill.  I only used 4 eggs as others suggested, but I still think that was too many, so I'd suggest using 3.  I am also surprised that others thought there was too much corn, because I'd probably add another can next time.  It was better than many others, but still not what I'd hoped for.

So good! I had never had something like this before so I honestly wasn't sure what to expect. I love corn though and decided to give it a go based on all the rave reviews. I'm so happy I did! It is quite sweet, and I believe it's meant to be. I may try it with a bit less sugar next time, though, just for personal preference. It is basically a corn custard, and it is divine. Also, exceptionally easy to prepare and just as easy to impress.

My corn pudding turned out well last year for Christmas 2012. As soon as my 20 yr old son ate it, he said, 'Mmmm...' Cool. It's a hit! My mother-in-law asked me to make it for Thanksgiving 2013 today. I don't know what all the fuss is about it being too "eggy". It's made with 5 eggs! So it will be 'custard-y' like quiche not like pudding consistency like Jello pudding!Someone said on here it should be like pudding. Get a clue. LOL. I think 5 eggs is too many. I will use 4 eggs, drain the whole corn and bake it in my flat 2-qt Corning casserole dish.

it needed something for me.  It was too runny even after sitting out of the oven for 15 minutes before serving.  I think I will add 1/2 cup corn meal to it next time.  I was hoping it would turn our like City BBQ recipe.

Easy recipe. ALTERED THE RECIPE A BIT...To punch up the flavor I added sharp shredded cheddar cheese, and shallots, Poblano pepper, garlic and red bell peppers sauteed in butter + chopped green onions. Subbed half and half for the milk. Subbed wildflower honey for the sugar. Awesome!

This was fantastic! I made 1/2 of a recipe & used 2 eggs & 2T butter. Next time I will make it a touch less sweet (I used 1/2 sugar substitute & couldn't taste any difference). This will be a staple recipe for me because it is so easy.

I just pulled this out of the oven, and it is not only beautiful but delicious.  I read some of the comments and I'm not sure what went wrong for you, but I made it exactly as listed, used a round casserole dish, and after exactly one hour it is perfectly done.  I am a bit of a corn pudding snob and love to occasionally try new recipes, and this one is my new favorite, and will be replacing one I've used for over ten years.  Awesome!!!

OK I watched the video. The recipe calls for two cans of cream corn, but in the video she states "add one can cream corn."  So which is it?

I followed this recipe to the letter and was so pleased with the results! The top browned nicely, and the pudding was a nice, sweet custard, just like what I used to have at family gatherings. I baked it an extra 5 minutes and it was not watery at all. This one is definitely a keeper! fyi, I did use a flat 2 quart casserole, as some reviewers recommended.

This was a GREAT recipe!!!  Used only 4 eggs and a little bit more sugar.  My daughter, who has never ate corn pudding, loved it and my mom, who is not fond of this dish, tasted mine and even took some home for my dad's dinner.... she called and asked me to make some more for her house.... unbelievable.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes I made were to sautee a small onion in the butter and substitute half and half for the milk. It had a great flavor, but had a more custard-like texture than the corn pudding I was looking for.  My family all agreed that this was a good side dish for  our BBQ ribs.

It was an easy recipe to follow and the taste was great.  After an hour it was still runny (too much liquid from somewhere) so I let it cook for an extra 15 minutes.  Still great recipe and it reminds me of childhood Thanksgivings.

i replaced the can of creamed corn with the "Cream Corn Like No Other" recipe.  Between the two recipes, where ever it called for milk, i used coconut milk instead for an asian flare.... oh my gosh, soooooooooo good!!!  :)  thanks Grandma!  :)

I changed this a bit because I knew I would not like the egg taste. I only used 3 eggs and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. I also added 1/4 cup of cornflour and substituted the white sugar for brown sugar. It was wonderful!! I told my kids it was cream corn so they'd try it and they liked it.

Delicious!  Served at Thanksgiving dinner & everyone raved.  The only change I made was that I doubled the recipe but I was short one can of cream style corn and I used only 6 eggs. Making again for Christmas dinner!

Loved the eggy-custard taste and texture of this.  I covered it with foil until the last 10 minutes, I didn't want the top too brown.

This didn't do it for my family and I. There were too many eggs in this recipe and it effected the consistancy. We were expecting something more breadlike and this was not it. Far too runny.

This recipe is fantastic! I only added four eggs after reading the reviews, and at first i thought that the consistency was like undercooked scrambled eggs, but then i tasted it and it was amazing!! I enjoyed the crispy edges immensely. It reminded me of a cheesy cornbread recipe that I made once. Top it with reduced fat Breakstone's sour cream and you're in business! I would definitely make this again! Thanks, Lisa!

Oh my gosh, this is amazing!  I used to have corn pudding when we would go to my grandmother's house for the holidays, and I have been looking for a similar recipe to hers since.  This is the closest I have found, and it is an amazing, slightly sweet corn pudding.  This is not a low fat corn pudding, but I would suggest following the original recipe.  My mother and sister-in-law loved it and have asked for the recipe too!  Thank you for sharing!

Very good corn pudding recipe.  If you do not have the corn starch, use all purpose flour instead.

I liked it, family thought it was ok. I think we were expecting more of a spoon-type corn bread/pudding. Made a lot and I was the only one that ate some leftovers. Will try again and maybe cut recipe in half.

I made this for Thanksgiving because the crew I had didn't like sweet potatoes and I wanted something a tad on the sweet side to balance out all the sides. My daughter made a "eww" face when I was making it but she liked it as did everyone else. I followed the recipe exactly.

I really didn't care for this.  I thought the finished product might have a creamy smooth texture.  Instead it was very eggy, like a quiche.  The taste was good, but the texture in my opinion wasn't.  Will continue looking for a better recipe.

The best corn pudding recipe I've made.  It's a wonderful custard-like corn pudding.  It has become a Thanksgiving standard at our house.

YUMMMM.  I made dinner for the parents tonight, and they kept coming back to the corn pudding.  I made 5/8 the recipe (I would've halved it, but 2.5 eggs is a bit awkward), since it was just the three of us.  Now, none of us are big eaters, and my parents are two tiny little Asian people (both under 120 pounds).  Plus, they are usually skeptical of anything not Chinese.  But they polished off this dish!  It was mildly sweet, perfect. I was hoping for leftovers, but oh well.

This was an awful mess.  It was so watery that I had to drain it over the sink before serving and even then it ran all over everyone's plate.  I will go back to my recipe that contains corn bread mix. Maybe adding a box of cornbread mix to this would help, I don't know.  It tasted OK, just wasn't a good consistency.

Oh, Lisa, I can't thank you enough for sharing this recipe.  I had the same one 15 years ago and made it at Christmas and Thanksgiving only.  I'd lost it in the shuffle some 7 years ago and have missed it terribly.  The ingredients are exact, and the flavor is identical.  I am so happy to have it again, and to be able to put it back in my holiday menu line up.

Very good! Also I found it a forgiving recipe - I only had 1 can of creamed corn so I used frozen corn also, and I had a night meeting so I baked for an hour then turned off the oven and left it in there for a couple of hours - was still yummy!!

Pretty much the way I remember my mom and grandmother making it. I will probably bump the sugar up to 1 cup next time, as I remember it being sweeter. I like to eat it with a healthy sprinkling of pepper on the plate!

I just pulled this out of the oven and my daughter and I are testing it for Thanksgiving this year. It is excellent!! It's not too eggy and just the right amount of sweetness. I put a touch of freshly ground nutmeg on top before I popped it in the oven. The crust is beautifully golden and crispy and the set-up is nice and firm but not at all dry. We've both had two small bowls already. My husband and other daughter are deer hunting this weekend and I thought there would be some left for them when they get back but I seriously doubt it will last that long!!!

Easy side dish.  Almost dessert.  Husband liked it but kids didn't.  I would take to a fall pot luck.

Excellent!  Even better the next day.  I followed it exactly and it came out perfect.  I will not be having "plain" corn again for holiday meals.

A nice, hearty comforting dish and so easy to prepare!  I even forgot to add the butter and it was still good!  I'll definitely make this again.

Quite bland, though it looked like I expected. Needs something to give it some kick. Onions? Jalapenos? Something.

THANK YOU FOR SHARING SUCH A TASTY AND EASY RECIPE!  I HAD ONE SIMILAR TO THIS BUT IT GOT MISPLACED AND THIS SAVED TURKEY DAY; SINCE CORN PUDDING IS ONE OF MY SIGNATURE DISHES.  I BAKED THIS IN MY PAMPERED CHEF 9X13 BAKER AND IT TURNED OUT AWESOME.  ONE UNFORTUNATE THING TO REPORT THOUGH, THERE WERE NO LEFTOVERS!  SO FOR CHRISTMAS I WILL BE DOUBLING IT  :)  THANKS AGAIN!

This was a big hit at our family dinner. Due to time constraints I made it a head of time and reheated for the dinner. It was yummy! Every morsel was eaten. I have added it to my holiday recipes.

Followed recipe exactly except for using 6 eggs by accident instead of 5. Baked in 9x9ish shallow casserole dish. Filled the pan. Served 8 people, but didn’t have any leftovers. Might double the recipe and bake in 9x13 pan next time. Can’t wait to make again! Our company loved this dish!!

DEEEE-Licious!!  I took it to a family gathering and they cleaned to bowl.  I made some variations.  Added 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup soy milk, and used 4 tablespoons of flour instead of cornstarch.

My changes to the recipe:  Use 1 cup half-n-half in place of milk and butter.
Substitute a 1 cup of drained crushed pineapple for the refined white sugar. 
Add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of allspice and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract.
(in another making of this I added 2 tbsp of molasses - yum)
Otherwise all the rest is the same.

I've been making this as a Thanksgiving side dish for the past 5 years or so. Everyone always enjoys it, and it's so easy to make!

I have made this recipe repeatedly, my family LOVES it!! Yes it takes a hot minute to fix, so start it way before you actually decide to cook your main meal if it's a quick meal.  It's totally worth the effort!

Was great. Used several of the tips: baked the yams, doubled the topping, added more vanilla extract and added cinnamon.  Will most definitely prepare again.

Here’s the best balance I’ve found, between user suggestions and 2 long-tested Southern Living recipes: Only use 3-4 eggs. Consider replacing milk w half n half, whipping cream, or evaporated milk (“soulfood style”)-If using canned corn, drain can of kernel corn, use only 1 addl can creamed corn or too soupy-If using fresh corn, use 9 ears = 4.5 c = 36oz.-If using frozen corn, thaw first and def replace milk w something creamier. Mix cornstarch and milk together (a slurry) ahead of time to stir out lumps and save 5m whisking time. Add Dash vanilla + Pinch nutmeg + 1 tsp salt + 5 tbs cornmeal // all these stirred in just before the corn. Bake in flat casserole dish @400° about 50 min, or 350° for 60+ min. Remove from oven, drizzle 1tbs butter and a sprinkle of black pepper all over. Broil 5.5” from heat for 2 min or until golden.

I made this as directed initially. Delicious! The next time I made it I added a tsp of vanilla. My children loved it as much as they did the first time. This will be a staple in our house.

I only used 2 or 3 eggs and used 1/2 box of corn muffin mix instead of cornstarch. Also baked 45 minutes in my gas oven. Turned out really good and everyone at the parties that served bbq pork or beef brisket or smoked meat ate it up.

Made this for the first tine for family Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. Perfect amount of sweet and savory and  a nice texture. 
I made it for my family of 4 the next week so I halved it, and didn’t have creamed corn so blended up regular corn with a splash of milk and it still turned out.

I  Took one of the two cans of  creamed corn and strained it to reduce liquid.  I used all five eggs and butter. I added a pinch of nutmeg and a few drops of vanilla. I added about 1/2 tsp of salt.  I substituted evaporated milk for the whole milk. I used a 9 x 11 glass corning Ware dish and cooked for 50 minutes  and it came out perfect— beautifully set– – not runny at all. It  was a big hit and will definitely make it again!

Great dish, have made it many times now taste almost as good as my mamaws ( I said almost) the only thing I would recommend is cook it in a 3 quart dish instead of a 2 because in a 2 quart there is so much that it's almost overflowing. But other than that its great!

Just like Mom’s... only two things I did differently was I added probably twice to three times the cinnamon and substituted one can of corn for two ears that I cut off. The family fell in love with it.

Would never make again. Was a goopy mess, had zero body to it and, oddly, was oily. Followed directions exactly as written. Was in the oven for 50% longer than written to attempt to get it to cook through. And it didn’t taste good. Find another recipe!

I prepared the casserole the night before making it, and it did not turn out like the photos.  I did stir it before baking, but it didn’t crisp and brown like I would have liked it.  It was more of an egg-like consistency than I’m used to corn pudding being like.  I will try it again baking it as soon as I prepare the ingredients to see if that makes a difference.

I love this recipe, it is so simple and quick to put together. The first time I made it I added cream cheese with chives and onion but not all the cream cheese melted so this time I took someone else's suggestion and added some cinnamon (we were also having it with ham) and it tasted wonderful! Mine does seem to get a little brown around the edges but I think it is because I don't want to have a jiggly middle (already have one of those thanks!) I have a 94 year old uncle who is so excited when I make this as it reminds him of holidays past (and it's very easy for him to chew). I have made mine in a 2 quart corning casserole dish and did not have to use a flat dish as someone else mentioned.

I made this for a Christmas potluck at work and it was a hit!  Even cooled off it was great and people wanted the recipe.  this is a keeper!  I used pure butter not margarine and whole milk.

It was fine. I think next time I’ll add some spice  like nutmeg to give it a little extra flavor.

Straightforward and delicious. Made it with 1 can of each type of corn (since that's what I had in the pantry) and it was popular with the whole family.

Tasted great. Took it to a work luncheon and it disappeared. I did drain the whole corn kernels, added 1 tbsp more of sugar, and about 1 tsp vanilla. Turned out great.

Delicious and so easy to make.  Smells wonderful when baking.  I used one can on whole kernnel for and almost 2 cans of creamed corn.  Added some garlic and onion and cayenne pepper.  Took it to a Thanksgiving pot luck last week and it was totally gone.  Making it again for Thanksgiving.  Tastes great and this is a keeper for me!

Minor changes to this recipe ... (hard to judge 1/4 egg) ... and no leftovers either!  This was for a family get together and everyone loved it.  Going to make it again as a side for Thanksgiving.

Piddling around looking for some Thanksgiving side dishes and I came on this one. So easy and so good. My wife and I ate the whole thing at two dinners and opted for what was left instead of ice cream.  This recipe is a real keeper.

This was really good but I thought it was a bit too eggy.  I know there are a lot of eggs so I think next time I will cut back the eggs.  I think a little fresh nutmeg will enhance that flavor.  My aunt makes the best from scratch but is not ready to part with her recipe.

I thought it would be like my mother's version, but it wasn't.  It was way to soupy and I think if the recipe said to drain the can of whole corn then it might have been better. I was very disappointed at the outcome. Waste of products. Sorry.

I've just watched unbreakable- Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix, googled the recipe and noticed they've used the exact recipe as "Grandma Meemaw's great corn pudding recipe"!!! 
I've tried to get the ingredients, but that's not so easy over here in Germany... I'll have to find cream-style corn soon! Looking so much forward to it!

turned out great! Mix corn starch with milk. Really helps. I used  15 +oz can of southwestern corn to the mix. (Drained) And a splash of  lantana season salt. 
Everyone loved it. Thanks for the help.

This was very good! I always seem to have leftover corn so I made this recipe and was happy with how it turned out! The only change I made was I added 1/4 c corn meal, as suggested by another reviewer to give it some “texture.” I don’t think it made a huge difference in the overall outcome, so I may or may not add it next time, but I’ll definetly make this again!!

As another comment suggested, I did use only 3 eggs instead of 5 and used 3/4 cup of evaporated milk instead of milk.... which was an improvement. However, I'd add one more egg and more sugar for next time. Maybe a couple tablespoons of salt. It was a bit bland.

This wasn’t what I was expecting it was very eggy. I think it’s a good base and I will try making it again with 3 eggs rather than 5 and I will add 1/2 cup flour or cornmeal so it has a better consistency.

This is just like my grandmother's in taste and I have added to my precious recipe book.  Everyone LOVES it.  I used two cans of regular corn and one can of creamed and it was great.,  I mix that up sometimes.  So happy with it. Thank you.

I love this recipes. I use it all the time. I do cut back on the eggs unless I double it then I use the recommended eggs. I only do that when it's Thanksgiving and Christmas where I have a lot of family and friends over.

Tasted just like my mom's at our own Thanksgiving many, many years ago when there wasn't a recipe.  I used all cream corn though as I tested it as written and didn't always like the whole kernels in it.  Thank you.

I liked it. I halved it because I know I have the tendency to eat too much, but kept the sugar at 1/4 cup and used 3 eggs.  I added 2 pinches of nutmeg as I saw suggested for another corn pudding recipe.  I tried this recipe because I did not have cornbread mix.  I would have preferred it to be thicker so I will add cornmeal next time, maybe would have to bake longer.  Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe as described and used the suggestion of dissolving the corn starch in the milk.  This dish turned out exactly like I was hoping, custard type baked corn.  Yummy !!!

Very good!  It does make a LOT, about 8 to 12 servings.  I even had mixture left over.  I'm going to try to freeze it and see it I could bake the rest later.  I altered the recipe a bit by adding 1 tblspn of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg,  1 tspn vanilla, and I substituted Xilytol instead of sugar and heavy cream instead of the milk.  It was delicious.  Xilytol is a sugar substitute I use.  It doesn't change the flavor at all, is  very low in the glycemic index, and is less calories than regular sugar.  It came out perfect!

I did not make any modifications to the recipe and it came out beautifully. Make sure you drain the whole kernel corn. I was looking for something to add to Thanksgiving dinner that would be quick to prep and add a side, and this was perfect. I couldn’t bake it at 400 because my turkey was running at the same time so I baked it at 350 and just kept an eye on the color and consistency. When it had a nice caramel color and not too much jiggle it was perfect. Will definitely make this again just because of the ease and simplicity.

Finally found a recipe that tastes like Mom's who, since she made by feel, never could give proper ratios.  Mine used to come out too soupy regardless of how long I baked.  Made this and it turned out perfectly (made mine a litte sweeter to be like Mom's).

I made this (doubled) for a  cook out at my husbands work and everyone raved about it. Honestly I wasn't really impressed, but with all the feedback I got, all loving it, then it must just be me. They are all wanting me to make it for all their work diners.

Who knew a simple recipe could taste so good. Not too sweet or creamy. Perfect texture and form. No cornstarch? No problem. In this predicament I substituted with flour.

Great! I didn't have any creamed corn so I just used regular corn but used full cream instead of milk.

This was good beyond my wildest dreams!  I chose this specific recipe because I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I cut the recipe in half because I was only cooking for 2.  I used 3 eggs instead of 2.5 but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband was not thrilled when I told him I was making 'corn pudding' - but he absolutely loved it too :)  This is going to be a family favourite!

Excellent recipe. I didn't have cornstarch on hand so substituted 3 times the amount of flour per Internet wisdom. The corn pudding still tasted good but seemed slightly less solid than it would have been with cornstarch.

I made this dish exactly as the recipe reads. I took it to a church brunch and not one kernel was left. It was a great flavor, moist, and so easy to make. I highly recommend this recipe for family meals or guests.

My favorite recipe for corn pudding. I use 6 eggs so it's more puffy, and I stir the cornstarch into the milk before adding it to the other moist ingredients. I divide it into two 1 1/2 quart Corningware casseroles.

I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 tsp vanilla. Kids loved it. Next time I plan to add some lightly caramelized ham chunks and some Swiss cheese. Very yummy!

I know that some folks get mad when you change a recipe but I always have to add something to make it my own. :-) I did follow this recipe to a t except for I didn't add a bunch of sugar and added extra butter salt and white pepper instead. What a great recipe :-) it didn't taste bready and even my toddler's loved it! I will definitely make this again thank you for sharing!

I was very disappointed in this.  I followed the directions exactly, but it was very runny.  I cooked it longer and then drained off some of the liquid, but it was barely edible. 
I will not make this again.

I made this recipe as others had suggested by adding the jiffy corn muffin mix.  Unfortunately, this came out pretty dry.  I suggest adding the milk required by the jiffy corn muffin mix box.  Otherwise, very tasty.

Exactly what I was looking for- a good comfort food that was simple.  My dinner guests loved it- my aunt used to make this , but it changed over the years.  This is the pudding texture I remember.  When I made it, I cooked it in the Crock Pot too, high for 2 hours - freed up my oven.

Loved it, I wanted to make it a little healthier so I used 2 eggs, 3 egg beaters egg whites, 1/4 butter and reduced the sugar by a small amount.  It was so yummy!

I made this recipe for a departmental potluck luncheon. I had never made it before and now they say it is my signature dish. The only change I made was to measure out two cans of frozen corn instead of the one can of whole kernel corn . It was really good and there was nothing but a few kernels left in the dish at the end of the luncheon. I was also asked for the recipe.

This recipe is pretty good but I can't give it 5 stars because I feel like it is missing a little something. It needs a little more flavoring or possibly some texture added. My family loved it however, so maybe I'm just not a lover of corn pudding? Next time I might try adding some onion salt or a cracker crumb topping but I wouldn't want to ruin the delicate custard texture. Also, this recipe can easily be halved even though it calls for 5 eggs - just use 2 whole eggs and 1 extra egg yolk.

This came out perfectly.  It is very good on it's own but is also wonderful with chili. I think this would also be quite good with green chiles added in.

I would definitely make this again as it has a custardy texture with the whole kernel corn making it homey and filling.  I think next time I will try some bacon bits and a little diced onion.

I did use sweetened condensed milk instead of sugar, but I love the taste and consistency of this recipe.

I make this recipe every year and everyone loves it.  
I use heavy cream or half and half instead of milk.  I add a touch of salt and pepper.
Cover with tin foil to keep top from getting too brown.

Very good!  Made exactly as written except added cornstarch to milk (substituted half and half) before adding to mix.  I also drained the can of corn and stirred in 3 chopped green onions.  The flavor was great.  I feel like the green onions are a must.  I think next time I might stir in a few tablespoons of cornmeal to see what that does or maybe an additional teaspoon of cornstarch.  I think some cream cheese stirred in with the eggs would be good too.  Will definitely make again.

Simple and tasty. I cut a bit of sugar and butter out and it still tasted great. Use the brand name canned corn because it does make a difference.

I was looking good for something like they serve at Don Pablo's, but this wasn't it.  It thought it was OK, my family thought otherwise.  I ended up splitting it into two foil pans and cooking for about 50 minutes.

Will definitely make this again.  Was supper easy, in a bowl and in the oven. Went well with grilled fish and with fajitas the next nite as leftovers.  I did add 1/2 cup chopped onion, and could not resist some graded cheese also a 1/2 cup.

Just the right recipe I was looking for,  I used 4 eggs instead of 5; drained the kernel corn;used a flat (corningware) casserole dish and baked it in a convection oven for 50 minutes, although it could have come out a little sooner. Great comfort food!!

the only thing i did different was mix the milk and cornstarch before adding it to the mixture, drained the whole corn, and sprinkled a small amount of cinnamon and nutmeg on top . also added a pinch of salt. i let it set for about 20 minutes after i took it out of the oven and it set perfect. the taste was excellent. will not replace other recipes i have but will add to my keepers. can't wait to try it re-heated and cold!

I made this dish without changing a thing!  Love the custard it made and the dish (11x7, 2.5 quart) that I used was an excellent size. This is a keeper for me and my family. Thanks so very much for this recipe.

Reminds me of my grandmother's in the deep south. Such comfort food and SO easy. After reading the other reviews, I decided to only use 4 eggs and drained the can of whole kernel corn. Tasted the mix by microwaving a little spoon to make sure it was good to go on salt, and thought it didn't need anything added. Baked in flat 9 x 13 casserole dish. I also prepped it and refrigerated for a couple of hours while doing some other things until I was ready to bake.  Turned out great! Truly a no fuss, easy receipe.

I have made a corn pudding cassarole for years at Chrsitmas, but now need a gluten free recipe for a family member.  When I found this it was ideal. Only change was that I took it out of the oven at about 45 min because it was getting too brown, and finished it in the microwave at power 7 for 4 min. It was perfect!

Followed directions. Everyone said it was ok and only took sample spoonfuls. As I only want outstanding at my Thanksgiving table, I will have to pass on this one in the years to come.

My son absolutely loves this.  I substitute brown for white sugar and whisk the cornstarch into the milk before adding the other ingredients as suggested by other reviewers.  In regards to the pan issue some people have had, when I used a deeper casserole, I stir it at 20 minute intervals like another corn pudding recipe that I lost (but I remembered that it called for stirring).

Made this for the first time for thanksgiving today and it was a big hit!!! I wanted something easy and tasty to take as a side dish and this definitely fit the bill! Only alterations I made were I used 4 eggs instead of 5, and added a pinch of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. Will def be making this again! There were no leftovers! 
Ps: Definitely remember to drain the can of whole corn!

I was really nervous after reading the review about it needing to be in a flat dish, because mine was already in the oven in my deep casserole dish. 
But!!! It came out perfect! YUM! It was so easy!

I double the sugar for a sweeter style custard.  And one tip... Warm the milk and dissolve the corn starch in it.  Prevents lumps!  Everyone loves this dish for thanksgiving.

Yum yum yum. Love it. I was a little confused at first because although the recipe calls for two cans of creamed corn, the video only used one. I used two, and it came out fine.

I have made this several times. Twice in the slow cooker, which saved me time, heat, and freed up my oven. I did add cream cheese to mine, and it made such a difference!

I followed the recipe but it came out rather bland. The next time I made it I used brown sugar and added a tsp of vanilla extract, a tsp of nutmeg, a tsp of ground cinnamon and half a cup of raisins. We loved it. It made a nice counterpoint to the ham and turkey.

Loved it!!! I didn't have creamed corn, so I just used 32 oz of regular corn and a cup of heavy cream instead. I also didn't have corn starch so I substituted flour. Absolutely excellent, everyone loved it!

I did this recipe as called for. It wasn't like how a "pudding" should be, instead of being a bread-ish it was more of an egg and corn quiche at best or scrambled egg and corn. the flavor was good just bad consistency. *for the cornstarch I added a bit of the mixture into it prior to adding it to the larger bowl to prevent clumps.

This is a great recipe I did make some changes. I used two boxes of jiffy mix and prepared with egg and milk as directed. I cut up some green onion and used two cans of cream style and one can of regular. I also use almost a entire  tub of sour cream. This is not for you if you are watching your waist but it's sure is delicious. I also used a square pan!

Made it to bring to Christmas brunch tomorrow but it smelled too good to wait until then. I was out of regular milk so instead I used evaporated milk. I also doubled the sugar and added a little salt. Very good recipe, will definitely make it again! :)

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and after following the tips of others, it was awesome and a keeper.  I used a flat dish like suggested and it was perfect!  I also made the following changes based upon the suggestion of others:  Because I too like to make foods that are healthy and low fat, I used a combination of 2 eggs and 3/4 cup egg substitute and used 1% milk.  I also added 5 T of cornbread mix to add texture and added a little nutmeg and cinnamon.  Mixing the corn starch with the milk before adding was a great suggestion.  My guests loved this including 6 children under 12.

my mother in law use to make these for every occasion.. So I tweaked it to taste more like hers. I used 3 eggs instead of 5.. 3/4 cup of sugar and instead of cornstarch we use jiffy corn muffin mix. This is an amazing side and definitely a crowd pleaser!

Easy to make. 
Needed a bit extra cornstarch and sugar, and I added a tiny bit of cinnamon and nutmeg for flavor.  I also added salt and pepper.

It came out runny and a little bland at first, so I mixed it all up again and added the extra ingredients above and re-baked it for another 20 min or so.  It came out much better flavor and consistency.

This is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly except that I did add a little salt to the eggs. It was delicious. I took it to a family reunion where it was a big hit. I will definitely be making this again.

I lost the recipe that I got from my mother so I thought I'd try this one. It was very good. I seasoned to my taste with a dash of salt, white pepper and I used half the sugar. It tasted just like the recipe I got from my mother. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for Christmas dinner, with the following modifications: I halved the recipe, used whipping cream instead of milk, and used all creamed corn because I had no whole-kernel corn. I baked it for 45 minutes, and it was delicious. Good, traditional, Southern-style corn pudding. My older daughter ate 3 servings. :-)

Absolutely loved this. I was looking for a recipe similar to the one my mom used to make and found this one. I thought mom's was excellent and this is so much better. I halved everything because I was only serving 4 people who I thought would eat it and wished I had made a full recipe. I did only use 2 eggs though since it is hard to half an egg. I really whipped it up with the whisk before adding the corn and it was extremely fluffy. Great recipe and although it is technically comfort food it is more like comfort food you find at a fine dining establishment not in mom's kitchen.

I like the custard texture, but it is a little bland. I put nutmegin, and it woke the flavor up. Curry powder wasn't bad either. I am also bsbasking it without a lid. It turned out a little soupy. Overall though, I like the recipe!

Very close to a perfect corn custard/pudding.  Too close to a custard for the recipe base I'm looking to build from.  Definitely needs a little salt, and my personal preference is always some little black flecks of pepper in a corn dish.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 2013, and it was OK. It was not sweet enough to be a dessert pudding, so we used it as a side dish. I believe it was too much egg; I thought it would be more creamy.

This is a great recipe!  I had been using my Grandma's recipe, but a lot of people thought it was too thin - this recipe had the same taste but a nice "pudding" consistency!  Now it's a holiday dinner favorite!

TOO EGGY. My aunt makes a corn casserole for Thanksgiving that is absolutely scrumptious! Positively one of the best things I have ever eaten and definitely on my top five list for favorite foods. BUT I DON'T HAVE THE RECIPE!!! Aahh! My mother originally had it, but gave it to my aunt to make, now I have to wait for it to come back around to our house. But I couldn't wait, I needed to find the recipe STAT, so I came to almighty Allrecipes.com and found a few options. I knew this particular recipe was NOT what I was looking for, but decided it couldn't hurt to try and thought I might actually like it better than what my aunt made.... NOPE. It is definitely too eggy. I'm not sure if it's my oven or what, but the hour was a little much. The sides crisped up in no time and by fourty-five minutes I was pulling it out of the oven wondering if it was supposed to be so brown on the edges. The flavor was bland anyway and there was a little too much corn in my opinion. Next time - there wont be a next time, but I mean hypothetically - less eggs and the 11 oz can of whole kernel corn should do just fine. To substitute a subraction of eggs, I've found many alternative recipes that use either more milk, heavy cream, cream cheese, or sour cream. Honestly, though, I highly recommend a corn casserole instead of corn pudding. The flavor is out of this world and it's all around a better dish. You just have to find the right recipe. I'll be back when I find it.

I made this dish yesterday, EXACTLY how written, as a side dish for my Thanksgiving Feast, and oh my Lord, is it delicious!!!  Absolutely perfect!  A TRUE pudding of corn.  My only regret is to get on the scales, I can't stop eating it...

I made this in the toaster oven because I'm trying to free up space in the regular oven for Thanksgiving. In the toaster oven, 400 degrees browned it up really quickly, so I kept an eye on it and turned it down to 250 for the last 10 minutes. It still cooked up beautifully and was not a bit watery-- this makes a nice, smooth custard if that's what you want in a corn pudding. If I make it again I will add nutmeg and vanilla. [Yes, much tastier with these latter additions.]

Excellent!  My only changes were that  I used only 4 eggs, only 1 Tbsp of corn starch and Half and Half instead of milk.  This recipe is truly a keeper.

I reduced the eggs from 5 to 3 based on other's user's reviews.  The pudding was delicious.  Very soft and smooth.  My FIL told me it was better than my MIL's creamed corn casserole!

I don't care for corn much but made this for the rest of the family for Christmas dinner. It was the only thing barely touched and left on plates after-wards. When I asked my husband what he thought he said "It's not THAT bad." but didn't take another bite.

I liked the sweetness to it,  But, I thought there was too much egg in it.  Not sure what to do about it because it would probably be too runny if it wasn't in there.  I probably won't be trying this recipe again.

This was excellent. I used only 4 eggs and seem to have a slow oven so I stuck a knife in at 1 hour and it was still liquid, it took about 20 minutes more. I also added chopped roasted red pepper, jalapeno, and scallion. Was delish!

Awesome!  I had no leftovers, everyone loved it.  I put it in a 2.5 qt. Pyrex bowl and baked.  I had to dump some extra liquid out when it was set though and baked it some more, no big deal.

This was so good.  I made this for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews.  I doubled the recipe but only used half the sugar.  I also added one box of Jiffy cornbread mix as someone else suggested.

A bit different to my usual one. Added 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 black  pepper for some extra flavor. Corn pudding never gets left back in this family of six.

This was my first time eating, much less cooking, corn pudding. I halved the recipe and wished that I hadn't! It was so good and different from anything I've ever had (city girl here). I ate most of it myself--this is a definite keeper! Don't change a thing.

This was delicious.  Not too sweet like many other recipes.  Nice texture, not runny but not too custardy.

I really liked this. My daughter (4) who generally LOVES anything corn, wasn't a fan (i think because of the texture) but I really enjoyed it, and was easy to make. I think my kids will learn to like this one ;)

This was a last-minute addition to my Thanksgiving this year and will now be part of the tradition.  I couldn't believe how good this was and it was SUPER easy to make.  Almost no effort at all and I just threw it in with the Turkey during the last hour of baking and didn't have to worry about it.  It was a hit this year - my Dad even made a point to comment on it and he's not that "free" with his compliments :).  Great recipe - thanks!

Just as I remember it...I did have to put more milk and more regular corn because I discovered I only had one can of creamed corn.  Hard to believe a Southern gal doesn't have more than one can of creamed corn!

This was the best corn dish I have ever made.  The kids loved it!  My husband was the only one that still prefers my dish that has jiffy corn mix in it but I thought this was hands down better. Will definitely make it again.  Very easy.

I'd never had anything like this and was looking for a different kind of recipe for our holiday corn dish.  This worked excellent.  Every one raved about it and I suspect I'll be making it many times to come.  In my versions I used 4 eggs and made sure that I drained the can of corn before I added it.  Again, it was excellent.

This recipe REALLY brung back memories of being a kid in the backyard while Mama cooked dinner! Tried and true, this recipe is DELICIOUS and a crowd pleaser.

(As others have noted - for a sweeter taste at about a cup of sugar.)

I thought this was an ok dish, not bad but not over the top, either.  It was a little bland for me - I personally would have preferred it be more on the sweet side, so I may try again with a little more sugar.

this was an instant hit at a ladies christmas party. I was asked by several ladies for the recipe. And asked to make it again for Christmas dinner by my mother in law whom is quite picky when it comes to food

Oh My Gosh!! I fixed this for our family Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone said it tasted just like our Grandma's corn pudding.  There was none left and one of my neices actually licked the dish.

I personally did not care for this recipe, but there were a few people at dinner who raved about it.  I would have given it three stars, but two of our guests said a definite five, so I settled on four.
