These were wonderful! I used an orange bell pepper instead of green (I find the green ones a little bitter), chestnut and button mushrooms, and also an onion cut into wedges. I marinated the kabobs overnight, and they were SO flavorsome! I really recommend using fresh herbs with this - the flavors compliment the veggies so well. Thanks so much, Bob!

Wow!  I made this last night and it was awesome.  I used shrooms, a red and yellow bell pepper, and sweet onion.  For the marinade I used dried thyme and rosemary using 1/2 the amounts and I crushed it between my palms. I increased the garlic to 4 cloves.  I mixed the marinade and poured it over my veggies and let them marinade for several hours, stirring occasionally.  Then I skewered the veggies & grilled them on med. heat.  I was tired of the typical Italian type dressing marinade for veggies & I will definitely do this again.  Don't let the smell of the marinade fool you, the marinade is great!

The marinade was very good in a subtle way.  Although I used fresh lemon juice,  portebello mushrooms and added steak to the kabobs.  They were delicious, the entire family ate them up!  I would suggest if you are going to add steak or chicken to make more of the marinade.

Love the flavour.  Instead of just brushing the flavored oil on the kabobs I marinated them in the oil for approx. 4 hours. Also didn't have fresh herbs so used half the amount called for in dried variety. Excellant Veggies!

Excellent marinade for veggies.  I've made this 6 or 7 times now, and it's excellent every time.  I sometimes add zucchini pieces, or onion wedges and I usually use a red and yellow pepper for colour, and because we enjoy them more than the green.

Excellent! I left my mushrooms whole and combined everything in a bowl and let it sit for a 45 minutes or so. Very flavorful. I will make this often this summer. Thanks!

This was okay. It was easy to make and average tasting.  I made it as written, except I added onion wedges to the mix.  The big plus was the beautiful color it added to my meal of steak fajita strips.  I served both over brown rice, with orange slices on the plates for additional color and to cool the palate from the beef fajita "heat".  I will make it again, marinating the vegetables in the sauce for an hour or two before cooking and perhaps adding some fresh basil to kick up the flavor some.  Thanks, Bob, for an easy addition of vegetables to my family's meals!

I tried this yesterday and it was wonderful.  I didn't have any lemon juice, so I left that out.  But I'm sure it would have been even better with it.  I also didn't have fresh thyme, so I used dried and added a little fresh basil.  I used mushrooms cut in half, onions, red and yellow peppers.  I didn't use green because I like the red and yellow much better.  I will be using this recipe a lot!

I made my kabobs with mushrooms only.  I brushed the marinade on as instructed, and I think that it would have been better to have let them soak in the flavor more before grilling.  They could have used more salt, maybe a little bit of tamari. My kabobs needed a longer cooking time.. probably would have been better if my husband wasn't grilling in the dark. I really liked these and I will be adding this to our my Grilling for Vegetarians menu.

Really good......made a few minor adjustments though....I subbed the green pepper for vidalia onion chunks, omitted the rosemary since I had none and used dried instead of fresh thyme. Excellent veggie kabobs....and such a tasty marinade. Love the lemon juice and fresh garlic. Will make again. Thanks!

These are delicious!  I use baby bellas and skip the peppers (bf can't eat them).  I usually pair these with steak, a baked potato, and broiled brussel sprouts.  Very, very tasty!

Delicious, easy and healthy, although you'll have to adjust the salt for individual taste. This recipe makes flavorful grilled veggies. I added diced onion and garlic for additional variety. This is a must-repeat!

Great recipe! This came together very quickly and was a perfect match with a grilled beef tenderloin that I made. The rosemary and thyme complemented the mushrooms and peppers wonderfully.

I followed exactly and was a little disappointed. The marinade is nice on the mushrooms but did nothing to enhance the peppers.  I will try again and as others have done, I will marinate them for awhile first instead of just brushing on while grilling.  I will probably also add some chunks of sweet onion.
I did try this again, marinating longer but am still disappointed.  These are some of my favourite ingredients and don't know why it is not working. I think the peppers need a stronger flavour for marinating.  I rather think this oil mixture is more suited to 'soft' vegies such as zucchini. Which I will try next.  I love thyme, rosemary, all these ingredients and really want it to work!

I used an orange bell pepper that I had in the freezer and added onion and small red potatoes. After mixed everything, I realized that I did not have any skewers, so I had to put it all in a grill pan for veggies on the grill. They came out fantastic. I did put the potatoes on first and then added the other veggies a few minutes later. So good. I have to admit that the mushrooms were the best part. They got eaten up first.

This is my go to recipe for grilling vegetables, either as kabobs or in my veggie griller.  I don't use peppers, instead I use zucchini and summer squash with the onions and mushrooms.  I make it easier by mixing the marinade ingredients and pouring over the veggies and letting them marinate before I grill them.  The flavor really gets into the the veggies this way.

Very yummy!  I used dried herbs (1/2 the amount of fresh called for) and subbed basil for rosemary because I didn't have time to crush the rosemary.  I also used one large clove of garlic, and even though we love garlic I thought it was overpowering so may leave it out or only use half of the amount called for next time.  We also added onion wedges, which I highly recommend.

Very yummy but since I am an inexperienced cook and can only cook one thing at a time, I was still hungry after eating my kabobs.  Next time I'll definitely put on some chicken kabobs to fill me up.

The vegetarian in our family and he rest of us enjoyed these portobello Mushroom skewers. The marinade was easy to make and tasty.

Thank you they were great! Didn’t change a thing, well, I did cook them longer.  Just my preference.

Great recipe.  I used a variety of fresh herbs in my garden for this. Absolutely Yummy! Let the veg rest in the marinade for a couple of hours before grilling. Wonderful way to eat your veg!

I found the olive oil over powered the other flavours, so next time I will use avocado oil as it is also healthy and has a high heat ability. We did enjoy it enough to do again and make this change.

I used my Foreman Grill and it took a good 10 minutes. I couldnt make them very long because of the size of the grill so I had many kabobs. I had to use dry herbs-will make again-Yum
