I have been making this tuna salad since it was uploaded over 4 years ago. Definitely only make this with 12 oz of tuna. Do NOT be afraid to add more celery and onion. In mine I put closer to 1/2 cup of each. Also, in addition to everything in this recipe try adding 3/4 TBSP of red wine vinegar. It is AMAZING. I just made a batch and I think I would ruin it by putting in on a sandwich with cheese. For now I'm just eating it with crackers so I can taste all of the fresh flavors.

Mmmmm, I could eat a tuna sandwich every single day I love it that much.  This recipe is good, I like the addition of the fresh parsley & lemon juice.  I also added some hot giardinera relish, (which may sound strange but is really good with tuna).  I cut the mayo down to 1/4 cup & it was still too much for my preference, but I really did like the recipe.  Thanks Emily! ;)

Never occured to me add lemon juice. Lovely touch. Delicious. If you don't follow the recipe exactly, please don't rate. You just look foolish and apparently don't get that you're rating your own recipe.

This recipe is amazing.  Very flavorful, and definately not fishy tasting.  I like it on toasted bread with a thick tomato slice and topped with melted cheese, yum!

I didn't have fresh parsley, I used dried instead. I also didn't add any extra salt as tuna fish is pretty salty on it's own. This made two sandwiches. I didn't have any myself but the kids seemed to like it. My son said it needs pickles next time.

I used 2 cans of tuna, 2 stalks of chopped celery (coz liked the extra crunchiness), a small red chopped onion (coz liked the spiciness). Also added 1 tsp. of sweet relish, squeezed 1/2 small-sized lemon juice onto the tuna and finally added some dried cranberries as well as raisins onto 1/2 cup of mixture consisting of miracle whipp & regular mayo. I served this salad with wholemeal bread as breakfast and lunch the next day & found that it taste soooo yummy as I am eating now... minus the usual fishy smell; while hubby just texted to review that though this salad tastes good, but it doesn't taste like tuna anymore! So, a 4-star for this recipe to justify our mixed reviews but I personally would make this again and again and again... as I love the refreshing and unique taste. LATEST: Finished off the salad leftover this afternoon over 4 pieces of low-salt crackers and topped with some ceyanne pepper and the tuna salad really tasted so much better with crackers on the 2nd day, believe me... Yummy, yummy and yummy:)

I made this for lunch today and used light mayo, a bit less than called for actually.  It was great - just perfect on whole grain toast.

This has all the makeings for a great tuna fish sandwich. I made just like the recipe with the exception of adding a chopped dill pickle. Do note that the recipe will make a lot more than four servings.

Thank you so much Emily.  I do not eat tuna, I can't even stand the smell of it, but my husband likes it and has recently decided to start taking his lunch to work.  This is my first attempt and he never even knew.  I had to leave out the celery and onions because he doesn't eat those.  I also only used 2 T of mayo since he is on a diet.  I don't think he even noticed the reduced amount because of the other flavors.

Yum!  This is a delicious way to add a little pizazz to your ordinary tuna sandwich.  Though, you only need about half the mayo (1/4 C).  Also great served with tomatoes and lettuce.

This is a great mix.  I opted not to use celery but really enjoyed the fresh lemon and parsley.  Great to keep around with crackers for a quick snack.

Fantastic! A couple of notes, I think there is so much flavor with the ingredients that there is room to play with the amount of mayo..the less the better ;-). Like many reviewers, I increased the celery, parsley, onion and lemon--I think all of them just added so much to the tuna. I also increased the amount of seasoning to my taste and it only made it better. I am not saying to do what I did, but the point is each component gives a lot of flavor and it gives you room to play with them to create the perfect tuna salad!

I used two cans of albacore tuna, added two chopped hard-boiled eggs, half a chopped apple,  I used Old Bay instead of salt & paprika & just for fun, I threw in some poppy seeds. I wanted to serve it in toast cups but I had some hoagie rolls that needed to be used so I went with that. Thansk for the recipe...we enjoyed it!

I made this for my partner's work meeting at home on Tuesday and it was a great hit.I did not use Celery because she can't eat it, and I used onion powder instead of onions( she doesn't like the crunch of them raw). I doubled the recipe and used 2 tsps of dry parsley instead of the fresh and 1/2 tsp of vinegar because I didn't have lemon juice. I omitted the paprika I didn't see the need for it. It made a ton of sandwiches which I cut into finger sandwiches. Also just a hint there is a substitution page (for if you don't have a ingredient listed)on allrecipes that is very useful.

As a couple of others have said, seemed like just your basic tuna salad and nothing special.  For me, it also made enough for about 2 sandwiches with a little leftover.  As to the mayo, it's one of the few that I think had *enough* mayo, not too much!!  Unfortunately still looking for something as good as the one they have in the salad bar at a local grocery store.

Is there any chance that it's supposed to be 2 cans of tuna instead of 1?  6oz of tuna for 4 servings is pretty light.  I made mine with 2 cans and it worked really well.

Nice recipe, I was looking for something for lunch and all I found was tuna and had never made tuna salad before. I also added chopped pickles and cayenne pepper since I like spicy food. I used about 2 T of mayo and a small amount of extra virgin olive oil. I'm so glad the internet exists while I'm learning to cook.

Very good; use about half as much mayonnaise. Scallion can be substituted for some of the onion.

I had never thought of adding garlic powder or lemon juice to my tuna salad; I really enjoyed it! Was a nice change but not drastic. I like to add chopped hard boiled eggs to my tuna so next time I will try that. Thanks for the post.

This was delicious! I love tuna salad, and my standard recipe is exactly the same, except the fresh parsley and lemon. I added the lemon last. Before adding it, I tried the tuna and it was as good as usual, but I liked the fresh taste the parsley added. When I squeezed in the lemon though, that's what made it! Don't skip the lemon! It absolutely adds the kick that makes this tuna salad restaurant or deli worthy!  

On a side note, after reading some of the other reviews, I don't think some people realize a large can of tuna is 6 oz. and a small can is 4 oz. This recipe calls for 1 large 6 oz. can. I did not have a large can, so I used 2 small 4 oz. cans. The half cup of mayonnaise was perfect for that amount, but I could see how it would be too much for a one large 6 oz. can, and way too much for one small 4 oz. can.

Really good!!! I added dill pickle relish.  The nutrition facts say this has 22 g of fat, but if you use light mayo and tuna canned in water it's more like 6g fat per serving.  Just as good too.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is. It's almost my usual recipe with the exception of lemon juice. I wanted to try something different without being too drastic. I was very surprised at how much of a difference the lemon juice makes. We all enjoyed it and it made 4 sandwiches. It was a bit soupy but I think that the brand of tuna I used was more wet compared to my usual brand. Should be perfect with that next time. thanks!

This is one of the best tuna salads I have ever had!  It was great on a bun.  However, I did make one change...I did not add the onions.

The lemon makes this light and refreshing. I did have to add another can of tuna, to much mayo for our preference. Thanks for the recipe.

The first time I made this I didn't have celery or parsley  & it was fantastic. We couldn't wait to make it again & today was that day. Well this time we added ALL the ingredients (we still only used 1/4c mayo). Needless to say we like it better the way we made it the first time. Maybe we won't use as much celery (that's what we think did it). It is still a great recipe that we will be making again, just with not as much celery.

Was in the mood for tuna salad for lunch tomorrow and hunted down this recipe. It is by far the best tuna salad I have ever tried! Didn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing, Emily!

Pretty good, I did half the mayo like a lot of other people said, but still came out thin.  Not sure why, only part I didn't like about it though.  So guess even less mayo.  I drained the tuna really well too.

I made this recipe with the changes suggested by other reviewers (less mayonaise etc.) for a party last week, and my family loved it. It tasted so good that I made it yesterday too. It is not really a salad, more a spread. Goes well with ciabatta. 
I made some changes to the original recipe: i used low fat mayonaise and added a little bit more parsly and pepper.

This is a nice little recipe.  I left out the onions and there was still plenty of flavor from the other various ingredients.  I think next time I'll use a little less mayonnaise. I am a huge mayonnaisse fan, but there was a bit too much for my liking in this recipe. I will probably use this recipe often.

I think that I will start making my tuna this way.  Only...next time I will definitely cut the mayo down to 1/4 cup and add more lemon juice (freshly squeezed juice and fresh parsley are important).  I may also try it with some chopped hard boiled egg.  Thanks Emily. :)

Great recipe that can be tailored for many tastes (more/less mayo, etc; dust some cayenne for extra depth, or try a bit of curry).

Noticed quite a few folks adding or suggesting the addition of pickles and just wanted to pass on a tip someone gave me a few years ago when I was trying to make perfect "deli/sub shop" tuna, but didn't want to add actual chopped pickles... Add a splash of pickle juice. Really perks things up... Though, because of the added liquid, I've found it's best to start with pretty dry tuna if you want to do this (flaked and pressed in a colander).

OMG!!!!! Although I cut back slightly on the mayo due to personal preferences, what a great change to my usual tuna. Who would have thought adding fresh lemon and parsley could make such a difference. Loved it!!! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

I made this as written, although I omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have any.  This is a basic, straight forward tuna salad and I liked it because it was just that.  When I'm hungry for tuna salad, I'll make this one again!
UPDATE 4/23/16:  I made this again as before but this time I added a chopped hard boiled egg and a generous 1/4 t. of mustard powder.  Great additions!

I have 2 of the pickiest kids. What one likes the other one never does! This is the only recipe both kids LOVE! Thank you! I also add one teaspoon of dill(I use 4-6 oz. cans of tuna; so that would be 1/4 teaspoon per can),I don't think dill is a necessity, recipe is awesome as is. I love this myself, so thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing.Easy to make and a pleaser for all!!! Has to be my favorite recipe of all time as simple as it is. In my opinion; anyone that likes tuna & mayo will Love this recipe.

I love tuna salad and my old recipe was just mayo and relish. This one is good. I used garlic salt instead of salt and garlic powder. I also added sweet relish, some dry mustard, and a pinch of sage. Now I have a keeper.

I made this for lunch to day for my daughter who loves tuna fish salad and for once I did not gag over the smell. My daughter loves it and I braved a bite and was happily surprised with the taste. I think the lemon juice kills the stinky fish smell and adds a wonderful taste.

This was simply Delicious, it really really made a nice filling for sushi hand rolls. I dislike nori and used soy wrappers instead wich added a whole new spin on things. Little different then a regular sandwich. Was delicious when dipped in day old sweet and sour sauce, and general taos sauce. I highly recommend this for any type of sandwich or sushi.

This is very tasty! I think the addition of lemon juice and paprika make it unique. I didn't add the fresh onions (used onion pwdr) or fresh parsley (used dried). I also added black olives because I wanted to use them up. Thanks for the post! Ate with tortilla chips.

It is worth doubling the recipe. I made a few changes using 1/2 T of red wine vinegar, and I used Greek yogurt for half of the mayo and I used a combo of light mayo and ranch for the rest. I took out the salt (since ranch is salty) and I used more celery. I also added a hint of yellow mustard because I love it. It was great and my husband approved (and he is a picky eater).

Very tasty!  Will make it again and again.  I used 2 small cans of tuna and only measured the lemon juice.  I eyeballed the celery and onion and just added until it was crunchy enough for us.

I chopped up a pickle instead of the celery, just personal preference.  I also eyeball the mayo and only add enough to get to a spreadable consistency.  This was a hit at our house.

This is the best tuna fish sandwich that I've ever had! My 3 year old daughter loved it and even asked for another sandwich! I did add an extra celery stalk and cut the mayo down to 2 spoonfuls. Thank you for this recipe!

I used 10 oz tuna and substituted celery salt for regular salt. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I gave it 5 stars because it tasted every bit as good as the pre-made store brand that my daughter loves and costs twice as much.

I love this recipe. I did not add the salt and made it with a large can of tuna which fit the amount of mayonnaise better. Will make again!

This tuna salad was great,  The addition of lemon juice made this special.  I appreciate that there was no pickle relish in this tuna fish salad.  Whoever decided to add pickle relish to tuna and chicken salad, potato salad and deviled eggs need to go back to the kitchen.  Just my personal preference.

What a soupie mess.  I increased this to 3 cans of tuna so we would have a stock to eat on all week.  I assembled the spices and wet items first followed by the tuna last.  I wish I would have scaled back on the wet items significantly.  I had to add another can to make this palatable.  Truly I could have used a total of 5 cans to get this corrected to the consistancy we like.  However, the flavor was good and I even used 1/2 miracle whip and 1/2 plain yogurt.

Almost perfectly standard, but I don't understand the absence of a couple of hard boiled eggs. Without those I'd just dump a can of t/f on rye bread with onion and have a sandwich and dill pickle.

Tasty little recipe, with nice crunch from the celery and onions. It calls for a ridiculous amount of mayonnaise, though -- 1/4 cup is plenty.

I followed the recipe precisely except cut the mayo in half (based on other reviews). 1/2 cup would have been way too much mayo. My husband liked the tuna salad but didn't care for the lemon in it.  For myself I made the same recipe but substituted hard boiled eggs for the tuna.  The recipe makes a good egg salad too.

This is very good tuna salad!  I really like the extra added seasonings, plus the addition of the Dijon mustard and lemon juice.  I did use dried minced onion instead of fresh onion, I also added two teaspoons of dill relish.

Easy & delicious!  I followed the advice to use less mayo (only about a tblsp) and I did not use celery, substituted lime juice for lemon and added fresh cilantro in addition to parsley.  Served it on grilled ciabatta bread but I could have eaten it all by itself!

Yummy! I had all ingredients on hand(:
I dont like the crunchiness of onions, so i used garlic powder instead. I will be making this again, it tastes sooo much better than deli tuna salad. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.  I also used 1/4 cup mayo instead of the 1/2 cup it called for!!

Very good. It was just a little on the salty side, but I think that may have been because I added too much parsley. I also added a hard boiled egg white and omitted the onion. 1/4 cup of mayo was perfect, and made just enough for 2 sandwiches.

This was a nice tuna salad - instead of parsley & salt I used veggie dip mix. I found 1/2 cup mayo to be a bit much if you like your salad a little dryer, so use a little less. I would also use a tad less lemon juice and pepper, but that's just my own taste. 
I used solid white albacore (salted). 
I also used an eggless light mayo from the health food store but wasn't crazy about it - will go with Hellman's next time, lol.

I served it this way - 1/4 cup tuna salad placed in center of a wrap (green spinach/veg), and a few pieces of romaine lettuce and small tomato on top, then wrap it all up and hold in place with foil at the bottom. 

This will save me $7 for a similar wrap at the local gourmet shop downtown! Tastes just as good.

Was good -- but I didn't have lemon juice (I'm sure it would have made a big difference). I added a teaspoon of French's Gourmayo in Chipolte Chili flavor to vary it a little.

I was simply looking to change up a can of tuna ( I know we all get to that point).  I try to give my fiancee a surprise in a lunch on Fridays...had a little left over so gave it to the neighbors.  Fiancee texted me he almost ate the tinfoil I wrapped it in and neighbors came back saying it was "dynomite"!!!!
  Now mom and dad wants it and all the other neighbors the first one told it too!  Love it!

It's a little light on the pepper and heavy on the mayonnaise for my tastes. Great with chipotle, or any other type of pepper spice, because the heat is subdued by the mayonnaise.

Very good. I didn't have any lemons so I added a quarter slice of fresh squeezed lime juice instead, and also hard boiled eggs (because I have never had tuna salad without that) and it was great. The lime (or lemon) juice really gave it a unique taste.

I tweeked the recipe by adding tomatoes and used half the amount of mayo since I thought there was way to much to begin with.  This was a great recipe after I tweeked it.

I think there is too much mayo. It looked a little watery. I don't eat tuna, but my boyfriend said it's good and he does not lie to keep from hurting feelings when it comes to his food. I'll make it again with less tuna. After he gave his approval of this version, I added a chopped boiled egg because he likes egg in his tuna salad.

I have never cared for tuna but this recipe has changed that forever! And it was so simple. I didn't have any parsley, plus not a fan so don't think I missed out on anything. Ate mine with Trader Joe's pita crackers and it was GREAT! Will def be making again!

VERY GOOD!  I didn't do any measuring, just used the ingredients and added to taste.  I served it over sliced tomatoes and lettuce.  Thanks for sharing Emily it was a VERY GOOD Tuna Fish Salad!

I loved this recipe. I only used 2 Tablespoons of Mayo. I added a small diced dill pickle, I added 1/3 diced tomato, I only used a tiny lemon juice and didn't use parsley or paprika. This recipe was good enough I ate it 2 times (for lunch and dinner) and the Husband loved it too. I recommend using Bumble bee tuna that is the best non fishy brand I have found.

Best tuna fish salad recipe ever! I modified by halving the amount of mayo and onion, and adding a tbsp of pickle relish.  I get lots of compliments!  Thanks, Emily!

I thought that tuna salad was a no brainer but I was so wrong. I have never been a fan of tuna fish sandwiches but this made me change my mind. Thanks so much for this recipe. I will be making this again.

I did not care for this recipe.  I did not like the parsley or garlic powder in it and the recipe called for twice as much mayonnaise than required.  It came out way too runny with even using half the mayo.  I added chopped eggs to give it more flavor.

I didn't personally taste this because I am allergic, but this gets five stars based on my daughter's reaction.  I changed putting regular onion in there to green onion, since that is her preference. I also added one egg.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really bland, and way too soupy. I had to add more tuna and a bunch more seasonings, plus some dill relish to get it to something I liked. Sorry, but I won't use this again.

I don't eat tuna, but my husband takes a tuna sandwich a couple of times a week in his lunch. I normally just mix it with mayo and slop it on a sandwich, but then I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. I only used about 1/4 cup of mayo and that looked like enough to me. I asked my husband to rate it for me and he said "5 stars for sure!"

Not bad. I do like that the tuna smell was gone. It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked though. If I make it again I'll add something else to it.

I am not a fan of tuna salad, but hubby requested some. This recipe is easy, and I had everything on hand. I used dried parsley and onion powder 'cause I didn't feel like chopping up an onion. I added the mayo slowly, and had hubby taste it until he was satisfied there was enough. It ended up somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 cup. Thanks for sharing!

Made as directed however I found this to have to much mayo (even though I cut back as previous posts stated) which made the tuna mushy. Probably wont make again but thank you for sharing.

Great traditional tuna salad recipe. I used 12 oz tuna, same amt mayo and onion powder instead of the real stuff and added sweet pickle relish as for us it just isn't tuna salad without it. Neither my son nor I cared for the celery in this, although it wasn't bad, we just prefer ours without next time. Nice blend of all flavors, thanks for a great recipe.

This was really good!  I didn't have any celery on hand so I used celery salt (and so eliminated the plain salt) and it tasted great.  I added a touch of cayenne for some spice and it was fabulous in a sandwich or on buttery crackers!

We actually QUADRUPLED the recipe to make tuna melts for 4 adults and have some leftovers. With the larger amount, we only used half the garlic and mayo. With american cheese and rye bread, they turned out excellent!

Great recipe.  I doubled it for a total of eight servings and added an extra can of tuna because "as is", the mixture seemed to be predominantly celery and onion and I like there to be a bit more tuna than "extras."  I used green onion, Italian parsley, and only 3 tablespoons or so mayonnaise.  Also, I put in 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder instead of 1/2 teaspoon.  Tastes great--fresh parsley is a must.

Great recipe.  I omitted the celery because I am not a fan of celery but added some chopped dill pickles to substitute.  Omitted the onions completely because we are not fans of raw onions and used dried parlsey instead of fresh as I did not have fresh.  Turned out to be a great lunch.  Thanks

Good recipe.  I added a little curry and cut the mayo in half.  Also left out the onions.

I've always felt that there was something missing from my tuna salad...it was the Lemon Juice! I'm not a fan of raw onions so I substituted onion powder. Great classic simple recipe.

Very good; my only mistake was that I added a little too much salt. The paprika is very good. May also be good with added boiled egg chunks!

Not a super fan of tuna fish, but this recipe was not bad.  I added diced pepperoncini's and a lot more pepper.  I like things spicy and savory.  I also added more mayo - which I'm also not a big fan of mayo - and it turned out good.  I would add mustard and dill next time.

This is a perfect recipe,  if you are tight on money,  or just want a  good tuna salad. I was a bit short, on the listed ingredients, so I added: 2 boiled eggs,  2 cans of tuna,  half of the listed amount of mayo ( ran out of mayo), and made up the other half w Maries Cesar dressing,  spoonfuls of relish. I was wanting that paprika but did not have.

Yum! It’s a little juicy, I may leave out the juice and try lemon pepper seasoning next time. Really good though and I’m glad I didn’t have to boil eggs for this one.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written, because once you make even the slightest change, it is no longer that recipe and it is unfair to the submitter to give it a rating.  It's a very good tuna salad that doesn't last very long in my house, very well balanced and tasty!

Overall it was good. I used a 12 oz can of tuna and it was still too wet for 1/2 cup mayo along with lemon juice. I would advise 1/4 cup to start and go with your instincts from there.  I also did 1/2 cup of onion and Celery, leaving the seasonings the same.

So I made this recipe twice to figure out things. First, note the size of the tuna can used 5oz. In another recipe I made the mistake of assuming that they are all same size and ended up with too much mayo for the amount of tuna. Even still, for me half a cup of mayonnaise is too much and I went for 4.5 tablespoons. I like my salad to be a tuna salad with mayo not a mayo salad with tuna. I used Hellmann's Real Mayo which I feel has a strong flavor compared to other brands. I liked the freshness of this recipe with the fresh chopped ingredients added like celery, onion and parsley. I compared this to Barbie's Tuna Salad which is the highest rated on allrecipes and this surely tastes fresher, but in terms of flavor punch Barbie has got it. Make sure you drain your tuna well even if you have to use a strainer. Extra water will affect the texture of the salad and make it mushy. The texture is quite chunky with almost every bite got the crunch of celery and onion. You may want to reduce the amounts a bit. Also try to go for red onion which is milder than white. I went with white onion at the first trial and it was too oniony. My next trial I used only 2 tablespoons of white onion and it balanced out. Make sure you dice celery onion into small pieces so that it spreads out evenly in the mixture.

Love this recipe! The tuna salad of my childhood always had sweet pickles in it, and I never cared for it. Happy to find this recipe with a savory flavor and the crunch of celery. I made it by the recipe except that I added more tuna (I had a 7-oz pouch of albacore), reduced the mayo, and omitted the salt. My husband and I had it on wheat crackers with a green salad for lunch and we both loved it.

Very tasty! as recommended by another review, I added some hot Giardiniera to give it a little kick. There's a lot of flavors going on in this tuna salad, which balances the tuna instead of featuring it. I served it on toast and lettuce, though crackers would really highlight the flavors.

This is a very good recipe. I liked all of the ingredients in it. For my family’s taste, I increased the amount of celery and onion. My only concern was how soupy it was so in the future I will use less mayonnaise.

I have made this tuna about 5 times now and it is now my perfect go to recipe. My 5 yr old daughter loves it!  I made a few substitutions and it still tastes great. I use Just Mayo (dairy free) mayonnaise, dried parsley instead of fresh and added about a tsp of pickle juice otherwise I follow the recipe as is.

It turned out very well. I added some strained sweet pickle relish just to keep it a little dryer. I also adjusted down the mayo portion. I like my consistency to where it packs well for a sandwich and not too juicy. Served on whole wheat bread or crossaiant with a leaf of iceberg lettuce it’s a Home Run!

I doubled the recipe.  The only significant change was the amount of mayo.  I only used about 4 tablespoons of mayo. And I used a whole lemon.  I was tempted to add sweet pickles.. from my past!  But I did not. I loved the recipe!!! I will make it again but I may add red peppers!!  enjoyable.

Perfect base salad.  I added a few dashes of Tobasco for a little kick .  Tobasco especially enhances this dish when you can get fresh tuna.  Nothing compares to fresh tuna.

Great recipe. Instead of using lemon juice, I use chopped pickles. It adds a nice crunch and gives it a nice flavor. I also add some juice from a jar of jalapeños to give it a kick without being spicy.

No changes initially. I always try recipes in their true form and then modify as desired. This one is excellent as is but experimentation will soon come, just for fun.

This recipe is DELICIOUS. I keep making it. I add red vinegar wine to it like someone suggested and it just puts it over the top. Also fresh parsley makes it so much better.

I've made this recipe dozens of times...great recipe! I triple it so my hubby has plenty for lunch...the ONLY thing I do not triple is the mayo. I leave it at 1/2 cup and it is perfect!! Love this recipe...definitely a favorite!

I don't like celery so I finely chopped carrots.  Gave it a nice crunch and  little sweetness.  Still trying to find the best/driest canned tuna as no matter how well I drained my tuna, it still was mushy.

So good! Made exactly as is except used dried parsley instead of fresh. I made early in morning which I think helped make the onions not so strong as they had a chance to absorb some liquid and soften slightly.

In 2 weeks I have made this twice already and each time I doubled the recipe and it does not last long!  I was never a big fan of tuna salad, but I LOVE this!  I have to chop the celery and onions very fine and since I had some extra carrots, I also chopped one carrot very fine to add more crunch and color.  I've had it on crackers, I've added sliced cheese and lettuce to toasted bread for tuna melts and I've eaten it with just a spoon.  I don't add as much mayo as it calls for - in fact, that part I don't even measure, just kind of wing it until it looks moist enough for my taste.

I loved it! I did make a few changes based on other reviews: used 2 5oz cans of tuna, more onion, celery and parsley. Basically almost doubled the recipe - but I didn't use even 1/2C mayo for it. The seasoning was lacking, probably because I did not double those like everything else. Will double them next time. I think as is this recipe would be perfect, but probably with 1/4C mayo the only change. Served on toast with tomato and pickle. YUM!

Excellent recipe with the Less-Mayo modification others noted.

I disagree with the reviewer who claimed people shouldn't make needed changes and then rate the original recipe highly.   This recipe is a great starting point for customization.

I always eyeball the amount of mayo anyway.   Since that is the high calorie ingredient, I'd never take anyone else's word on how much is needed.   I start with a minimum amount.  Then, add it a little at a time to optimize for taste and consistency... not a gram extra.  So that "flaw" is not a problem for me.

Too much mayo, half the amount called for would be fine. I used all celery rather than half onion, half celery. I liked the fresh parsley, it added a lovely fresh flavor.

I initially tried this with one small 5 oz can of tuna, and it was way too much mayo. I simply added another can, and it was perfect. You could probably use 3 cans if you want to cut down on the mayo further. I used white albacore in water and Hellman's low fat mayo. I found it tasted even better after letting it refrigerate overnight!

Made this just as the recipe suggested and it was delicious!  Reminded me of the way my mom used to make it.  Only thing I will do next time is add some sweet pickle relish, just to make it even more like mom's:)  Small amount, so double if making it for a family.

No matter which salad I'm making (macaroni, tuna, ham, etc,), I always chop more red onion, (or Vidalia in season), more celery (the leaves have a stronger taste), Canola mayo for health reasons, and a whopping spoonful of sweet pickle relish. I also add one hard-boiled egg per 12 oz. can of tuna.  I use garlic salt instead of plain salt.  Melting a tasty cheese (like horseradish  white cheddar cheese) is great for tuna melts, as well!

I (almost) doubled the tuna to 10 ounces, doubled everything except the mayo. I actually ran out which is good because this has way too much; I couldn't imagine if I didn't run out. 
I just started liking tuna so I'm not one to like it too fishy either.

For tuna this is pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of tuna fish sandwiches but a couple in the family are, so I made it for them. I upped the recipe to 16 servings as I wanted to use 2 12oz cans. We usually use just celery, onions & mayo and have very boring tuna salad. I read the reviews & added some chopped bread & butter pickles but otherwise followed the recipe, with the exception of the mayo. I cut it pretty much in half & it was good. The lemon, garlic powder & paprika add a nice flavor to it. Thumbs up! Love the site feature to change the serving size! Very helpful!

I would give five stars but the tuna to mayo ratio is off in my opinion - 3 cans of tuna rather than the 1 can the recipe calls for fits with the 1/2 c. of mayo called for. I only used a shake of the salt and pepper too. All else I did according to the recipe, and might I say DElicious!  I liked the addition of lemon juice - really sets off the tuna flavor so it doesn't get lost with the other ingredients. A wonderful switch off from the old tuna/mayo/pickles recipe. EDIT: I also use red onion instead of yellow for additional flavor. I discovered this works really well atop a plain Pretzel Crisp too!

Oh. yum. This is my new fave tuna salad. The capers and red wine vinegar someone suggested just enhanced it really well. I started out with half the mayo, based on several comments, and didn't add any. Loved it that way! My husband will be home soon, and I almost want to hide it. But I want him to experience it, since he's the love of my life.

Tasty but WAY too much mayo... and I love mayo!  I had to add another can of tuna and it still was a little too much for me.  Will add some dill next time.

Gorgeous! Had everything except celery, but wanted to make it immediately so I left it out. I added a lot less mayo, just a heaped tablespoon and it was just the right amount of creaminess for me. Also doubled the amount of lemon juice. Thanks for the recipe, will try with celery when I have some.

This was so awesome! Since it was Lent, I made this and even though I am not a big tuna lover,it was out of this world. And I never would have thought to put celery in it, but that really gave it such a great touch. Since I am on a diet, I use fat free ranch dressing instead of the mayo and I loved it. My mother wanted the recipe too so I gave it to her. Thanks Emily!

Most definitely the best tuna salad I have ever had! I did add a splash of red wine vinegar as one person had suggested. I topped the tuna on the bread with a slice of provolone and melted under the broiler for a few minutes...so good!

I found this to be a satisfying, classic tuna salad, perfect on toasted wheat bread.  The lemon juice and parsley lend a freshness not found in a lot of tuna salads.  I added 2 teaspoons of capers for an added dimension of flavor, and it made it even better.  I'll be making this again soon.

Ummm, wow.  What a simple yet flavorful recipe.  I left out the celery, added dry parsley b/c I was out of the fresh.  I also added about a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.  I cut back on the mayo, as well, and used miracle whip.  Can't wait until my family gets home to try!

Omitted the celery since we don't like it here and it was amazing. I normally make tuna salad with boiled eggs as well. I'll try that next time to make it more filling but the recipe as is tastes great.

This is SOO GOOD!  However, to make it a little healthier I added only 1/2 of the mayo it calls for and then added plain fat free yogurt to cover the rest.  It was great!  I also added some chopped up pickle and it was great as well.

The first time I doubled all the ingidients and felt there was too much mayo so I used less the next time and light mayo.  I also added a bit of red wine vinegar.  Tasteted great! Good recipie.

I do not like tuna, even the smell makes me sick but my husband loves it so I used this recipe to make him tuna salad.  The first time I made it I used all the mayo and it was way too much.  The second time I used less than half the mayo and it was much better. I also added chopped pickle.

Great recipe. No deviation of any kind needed. Don't muck with this one.  The genius in the right seasoning blend, espeically the lemon, onion and garlic powder.

Excellent flavor to this salad.I don't like tuna that much but I have to say i'll try this again.I had to use apples instead of celery only because I didn't have any. I also added a dozen pecan smashed in a sandwich bag and added to the mix.Thanks for shareing

Great taste!  Gave it 4 stars because I had to modify a few things.  #1 I needed more cans of tuns than the recipe called for.  Either that or decrease the amount of mayo because it's a little soupy.  #2 Add season-all and/or Old Bay.  The lemon juice gives it a tangy taste that I wanted to tone down a bit.

This is really good!  Not a fishy taste, just delicious flavor!  I don't use celery, I use about 1/4 tsp of celery salt instead.  I've also made it with 1/4 tsp lime juice instead of 1/2 tsp lemon juice, which worked well.

This is delish.  I don't know if it's four servings... I used about six cans of tuna and about double of the rest of the stuff, and it made about five to six servings...

Ah I just love this recipe. I made it for my 15 month old, who had previously refused another recipe, & she gobbled it up! I dropped the lemon juice & added a tbsp of sweet relish. Needless to say this will be added to the recipe book for future lunches =)Thanks!

I really like this tuna salad.  I decreased the mayonnaise and added one hard boiled egg (husband wants eggs).  I also added crushed walnuts and a little terragone.  Thanks for sharing!

This is simple, yet very delicious. I have made this many times now, and like how the ingredients in this recipe take way the "fishy" taste of tuna.   I like to add additional sprinkles of lemon juice to my liking.

I have made this several times for my fiance for lunch. He really likes the recipe, although tells me to reduce the onions by 1/2. I on the other hand, do not like tuna. Yhis review is for him.

Loved this receipe!  Best Tuna fish I've ever made.  I didn't add onions or celery and used dried parsley (1 1/2 tbsp) ( I doubled the receipe). I also used soy based vegitarian dressing (like mayo) but came out too wet so next time reduce amount. My hubby loved this also!!

5 stars making the recipe as is!  For fun, I do experiment by adding a few of my fav's such as boiled eggs or sweet pickles.  can make it even more healthy by adding half of the mayo and adding red wine vinegar (3/4 T.) as another reviewer suggests! YUM!

I used this recipe for finger sandwhiches for a get together we had at our home - I made several different kinds of sandwhiches and this one went the fastest and I got lots of comments on it. I was able to sneak the last one -
loved it

This was wonderful!! I used 2 cans of tuna to the 1/2 cup mayo, and it was still very wet so maybe cut down on the mayo next time (even for two cans) I used dry parsley instead of fresh (just decrease by half when subsituting dry for fresh) and it was great!!

My husband just called to tell me that this is the best tuna salad he's ever had.  This recipe has a very good combination of flavors. I did cut down on the mayo quite a bit as well as used a little less onions, but otherwise made it as written.  I chopped the veggies relatively small but this is still a chunky tuna salad.  I really like it but if you are looking for a very smooth tuna salad this is not it.  I will definitely make it again, maybe with a pinch of curry next time instead of paprika.

This is basically like my regular tuna salad recipe.  I don't use parsley or paprika.  I also add a little dill relish and some grated parmesan cheese.  This two things alone will change the flavor drastically.  I highly recommend trying.

The previous reviewer pretty much sums up my thoughts about this recipe - quick, easy, convenient and tasty. I too used less mayo - probably no more than a tbsp. Oh, and I omitted the parsely as I don't especially like it. Had this on toasted English muffins - love the contrast in textures. Thanks, Emily!

This is just the kind of tuna salad recipe I was looking for.  It is a basic, no-frills, very tasty recipe with ingredients I usually have on hand.

I did cut down the mayo to 1/4 cup and it was plenty moist for my liking.  I also used light mayo and it was still excellent.

Will be making this often.  Thanks!
