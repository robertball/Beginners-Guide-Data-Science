What can I say?  Simple and delicious!  Here is a tip to make the sauce less runny...  I did NOT leave any water in the pan when melting the butter with the brown sugar.  This makes for a thicker sauce and when you add your carrots back in the pan, it's perfect!

I steamed the carrots instead of boiling them to keep more of the flavor and nutrients. I don't like my vegetables really sweet, so I used about 1 1/2 tbsp butter and 3 tbsp brown sugar. It was just enough to make them slightly sweet without hiding the natural good flavor.

These are tasty carrots.  For as much as I am hip on conveinence, I cut up regular carrots vs. using baby carrots, they just have much more flavor.  Anyway, I melted the brown sugar with the butter (skipping the water) & added it to the steamed carrots & it was fine.  Thanks Rebecca, for the sweet treat!

I don't like cooked carrots as a sidedish by themselves (reminds me of baby food)...rather I like them IN dishes.  However, this is the only dish I make an exception for.  My mom has been making this since I was little and I make it when I am pressed for time in making dinner a complete and well-rounded meal. However, like another reviewer also said, get rid of all the water, its not neccessary. Also, I just use a TBLS or two of butter.  It's fantastic with the many main dish chicken meals also found on this site!

Delicious!!  I steamed them instead of boiling, then melted the margarine in the microvave.  I also added about a half teaspoon of cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg.  I microwaved them for about 2 minutes just before serving them, so they'd be nice and hot.  My husband and I absolutely loved them!

A bit bland, but good.  It needed some spices. I added some garlic, rosemary and lemon juice to taste.

I took the advice of some other reviewers and steamed the carrots. I also used a squeeze of lemon, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and a 1/4 teaspoon of nut meg. I also had a carrots marinate in the sauce for about 20 minutes before serving, I just covered the dish with an lid. This recipe was a favorite in my house!

I've been making carrots with brown sugar and butter for years. Hubby just loves them like this. They are not too sweet. I use canned carrots and do them in the microwave. Very easy. Using a little of the can juice to microwave them the butter and brown sugar end up being sort of a sweet marinade instead of really a sauce. I don't thicken it and actually discard most of the marinade. Just a little bit of the sweet flavor on the carrots is all you need.

I would've never tried this combo on my own, although apparently it is pretty common, but I do love it.  I am a super busy (*ahem* lazy) college student, so I found a really quick way to make this for one person using a microwave.  Chop up three carrots, throw in a bowl. Fill bowl 1/3 of the way with water. Cover with a plate. Microwave on high for 3:33 (yes, too lazy to move my finger). Remove from microwave. Drain. Add 1/2 tbsp margarine and a tsp of brown sugar. Mix, and voila!  I've also tried actually following the directions and I gotta say that I much prefer my method. Cheers!

I serveed these last night at a church social.  Everyone loved them and commented on how yummy they were.  I liked that I could put in the total servings and you scaled the recipe for me so I got the right amount of ingredients.  I drained the carrots completely and made the glaze seperately then poured then together about 5 minutes before sreving and let the marinate.

Very good but I think next time I may put a little salt in the water.  There was just a little something missing.

Very, very yummy! My husband really liked these a lot! Very easy to make too. I used real butter instead of margarine. One reviewer said that they were watery. I used a ladle and scooped out some water and set it aside before I drained the carrots. I melted the butter and added the brown sugar and stirred until the sugar dissolved. I added a little water at a time until it was just the right consistentcy. I added the carrots and coated them with the syrupy sauce. Excellent results!

These were very good, but no need to leave the water in as it just makes the sauce runny!  Quick way to caramelize the carrots is to broil them in the oven on the middle rack for 5 minutes or so after completing the steps above.  Always wonderful!  Thank you for the sweet treat Beckie!

These were great! I drained all the water from the carrots and halved the recipe and used butter - turned out great! Makes a nice glaze which I love because I like to still be able to taste the carrots :)

This is a four-star dish, but because I don't really like carrots and I do like this quite a bit, it gets an extra star for overcoming the relative heinousness of carrot.

This ones a definate keeper!  As per other reviews I didn't reserve any water...thank goodness because the water on the carrots alone prohibited the butter and brown sugar from thickening much.  I ended up putting a bit of thickener in and it carmelized perfectly!  I also added a bit of cinnamon (as suggested by others) and it was so delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!!  I cooked the carrots until they were slightly undercooked and then added the butter and brown sugar.  I then cooked them until they were tender.

Honestly, they were a littly watery (most likely because I didn't know how much water to leave in the pan).  Next time I would drain ALL of the water.  I think the butter is enough to create a nice glaze.

I have been making my carrots this way for years! I use sliced carrots also. I completely drain my carrots and add the butter and brown sugar right onto carrots. (I don't measure) just add to our liking. It makes a nice sauce. I season with salt and pepper and have also added ground cinnamon. I bet a splash of vanilla extract would be good also!

very tasty way to dress up carrots. I used locally grown carrots ( red, yellow and orange), cut into 2 inch sticks. I cooked the carrots in a pot of water and once the carrots were fork tender, I drained the water and set it aside. To the same pot, I used butter instead of margarine and only 2 T. I added about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and let both the butter and  sugar come to a boil before adding the carrots back. I tossed the carrots around to evenly coat them with the sauce. I let them sit for 5 minutes to allow for the flavors to come together before serving. I did not want the carrots to drown in the sugar sauce just enough to taste. The sauce was very tasty, not overpowering. I enjoyed the carrots which still had a nice tender yet slight firm bite to it. Overall, I am glad I did not use the full 1/4 cup of butter and cut back a little on the brown sugar (might have been too sweet for me). There were no leftovers , my family ate them all up. I served these with grilled rib eye steaks and creamy sweet corn, from this site.

I made these with whole baby carrots, and I drained them well, I think they would be tastier with the carrots sliced so they could all get soaked in the sauce because it all went to the bottom of the pan and ran off the whole carrots. It didn't glaze them as I had hoped, but that isn't what they are called either.

I made this according to recipe except I steamed the carrots instead of boiling which helps to keep more of the nutrients and I omitted the water. I cooked them for 5 more minutes in the pan with the glaze. They came out good but next time I will add some lemon juice to balance the sweetness. A good recipe for carrots though, if you enjoy cooked carrots...which I do...very much :o)

I think this recipe was simple and great.  I did use butter instead of margarine because of preference.  Per others suggestions I added a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  I cheated and used a bag of frozen baby carrots instead of fresh but they were still very good.  These carrots would work well in a more festive holiday meal, like a baked ham - but for that I will use the fresh carrots.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because my kids were not as in to them as the grown ups were.

I love these! This is the only way I ever eat carrots... but I do use butter and I sometimes add a touch of lemon and a few drops of vanilla for a twist on the usual. Thanks for the post, Rebecca!

I have tried this recipe, but prefer my own in leaving out the sugar and using approx. the same amount of marsala. Even though this is alcohol when I'm a tea-totaller it does give it a lovely smooth flavour similar to the brown sugar, but the marsala is better in my opinion.

Simple and tasty!   I took the advice of not leaving any water in the pot, and think it turns out better this way.

These were very tasty.  I think I would thicken up the sauce a bit next time. other than that, it was a nice take on cooked carrots.

We all love this recipe.  They're so simple, but really add that "down home" touch to the meal.  I used the little premium petite carrots and cooked them until they were soft enough for our 14 month old. Yum!

My husband thinks I'm crazy for covering all my vegetables with sugar, but it's so gooood that way. Only need to keep a VERY small amount of water in the pan after draining or you'll end up with too much liquid.

Pretty good, but I think a little too much sugar is called for.  If I made this again, I'd add some herbs too.  And maybe a touch of seasoning salt.  Better than plain carrots though.  Oh, I steamed the carrots instead of boiling them, and cut the recipe in half.  Used regular (cut-up) carrots instead of baby ones.

These were very good. I added a pinch of salt and  about a teaspoon of Italian Seasoning and melted them with the butter and sugar in the microwave instead of on the stove.  It turned out great!

This has become one of my favorite ways to prepare carrots.  I use real butter instead of margarine and I drained off all of the water.  I added about an 1/8 cup of orange juice and proceeded with the butter and brown sugar.  Absolutely Delicious!!

I made on Easter for small group and no one ate them.  They just tasted like carrots in water sugar. The recipe is simple but it seems off with the water. Steamed carrots, with a little butter, would have been just fine and would have been better without all the dripping watery liquid, that does not seem to get absorbed by the carrots.

This was really good!! The best carrots can be. There was alot of liquid at the bottom but it worked out cause I make Amys garlic chicken with it and dip it in the juices. Also baby carrots seem to hold in more of the flavor than just regular carrots. Very Yummy!! Thanks

I just got done makeing these - son had friend sleep over and wanted something healthy to go with the mac n cheese (LOL) besides corn.  Good but a bit sweet - great way to use up rock hard brown sugar. But sweet is good when it comes to tenagers I guess.  Quick and easy too.

I loved these carrots--the simple ingredients and cooking method made them nutty and slightly sweet with just a tiny crunch. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tablespoons butter. Great recipe!

I scaled this recipe in half. It really does not need any water in the bottom of the pan before adding the butter & brown sugar; makes it much too watery.  Served this tonight with Beef, Burgundy Style, Yummy Pesto Mashed Potatoes, & Zesty Marinated Asparagus, all from this website; great meal. Thanks, Rebecca!

I made this a bit differently because I only had sliced canned carrots but it came out really tasty! What I did was I used 2 regular sized cans of sliced carrots and made sort of a part in the middle of them in the bowl where I put 1/4 cup butter and covered the butter with the 1/3 cup brown sugar and about 1 tablespoon cinnamon. I also put a bit of water at the bottom of the bowl. I then covered it and cooked it in the microwave for around 3 1/2 minutes. I then stirred it all up so the butter/sugar/cinnamon was mixed all over. I then cooked it for around 3 minutes more before serving it. I would recommend that if you do it this way you leave out the water at the bottom and also cut the butter down just a tad to 3 tablespoons instead of 4 because it came out a bit too watery. But it was so good though! I can't wait to try this the original way with regular carrots but as a last minute sidedish this really "hits the spot", my husband and 16 month old both loved this!

Very simple and yet tasty. I make this as an "easy" side sometimes and it's always a hit. I even threw it in for an extra Thanksgiving side and several were requesting it again for Christmas dinner. 

I don't leave reserve water in after I drain the carrots, though. I just add them back into the pot with the margarine (or butter, I've used both) and brown sugar and they come together in a nice glaze that isn't runny at all.

These were tasty and something new to do with carrots. I used butter and didn't measure brown sugar just threw some in. I didn't realize I did it differently until I just came back on to review. I cooked the carrots, drained off most of the water put it back on the stove and threw the butter and sugar in. After the butter melted I thought the sauce was runny so I added a little cornstarch and that thickened it up nicely. Very easy and tasty.

Perfect, just the right amount of sweetness. Using real butter instead of margarine makes it even better.

The carrots were good, however, I expected them to have more flavor.  I don't think I let them sit long enough in the butter/brown sugar mixture.  Next time I'll allow more time.

I cooked these carrots and other foods for 15 Marines for Thanksgiving.  Of all the other dished I cooked, the carrots were the first to go.  This was a great recipe and it was easy to make.

This was a huge hit here with my husband. I love carrots fixed any which way you can think of so they were a hit with me as well. Sweet and delicious. I only added a little salt to the mix since i was using unsalted butter. Thanks Beckie!

Quick and easy recipe.  The first time I made this I followed the directions exactly.  The second time I steamed the carrots in the microwave  until slightly tender.  I then poured off steamer water leaving enough to cover the bottom of the container.  I then added the brown sugar and butter and microwaved until butter melted.  Finally, I mixed in the carrots and microwaved to desired tenderness.  After cooking, I left the top on container ready to serve.

These are good, but were a little watery.  That could have been my fault. I used Splenda brown sugar for my diabetic son-in-law.  You can hardly tell the difference, so it's a great alternative to my usual butter and maple syrup recipe.

Yummy! I didn't really use any specifics amounts, just added enough of the margarine and brown sugar to make it taste good. I also drained all the water from the carrots before adding the other ingredients. My 20 month old LOVED this!

Make sure your carrots get real tender first.  If you double or quadruple the recipe- DON'T double or quadruple the butter.  Too much wasted butter on our 4 lbs of carrots.

These carrots were GREAT, with a few changes.  I took others advice and added cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg.  I also drained all the water off and added everything to the pot, then I added a Tbsp or 2 of cornstarch diluted in water to thicken the glaze.  I could have made twice as much!!  Everyone wanted seconds!

Boiling and draining the water defeats the purpose of eating carrots for nutritional value.  If cooking with baby carrots, I highly suggest adding a small amount of water to your pan, close the lid, and let it simmer/ steam for a few minutes.  Once it evaporates, add butter and brown sugar.  I also added garlic powder and black pepper.  Overall, I enjoyed this recipe very much.  Thank you.

This was good, but next time I don't think I would put water at the bottom of the pan when melting the butter and brown sugar.  It would make the mixture thicker and would stick to the carrots.  Will definately make this again.

Very easy and good.  I, like many previous posters, had too much water the first time I tried, but they were still good.  I cooked the carrots for approx. 15 mins, just check tenderness with fork.  Thanks for the recipe.

AWESOME recipe!  Super taste and not too sweet!  My dinner guests loved it and asked for the recipe!!  Definitely will be making this one again!
Added 11-23-06: I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, some nutmeg, did not leave water in the pan (based on other reviews) and then I topped them with miniature marshmallows and everyone loved it again!

Absolutely delicious!  The brown sugar gave it just the right amount of sweetness.  I followed  the advise of some other reviewers and did the sauce in the microwave without the extra water.  There was still plenty for the carrots.

The kids loved this!  I'm not a big carrot fan but I must admit I too loved the taste of this dish.  I left out the water and simply melted the margarine and sugar in the microwave and poured it over the carrots.  Very easy.

An easy and tasty side dish. Butter can be substituted for margarine. Adult carrots sliced on the bias make a nice presentation if you don't have baby carrots.

This recipe is excellent. I also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. I steamed the carrots. I found that the recommended amount of margarine (I used butter) and brown sugar was too much. Next time I plan on using about half the amount. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I found it a little too sweet so I added a little lemon juice and some parsley - about a teaspoon each, and wow, the taste went to a whole new level.

I bake mine at 350, 45 minutes or maybe longer, covered with foil. 'Probably 3T butter & 2T brown sugar.  I melt the butter, add the sugar & stir to dissolve; then add the cold carrots.  The coldness helps the butter coat since it firms up.  Kids still won't eat 'em so more for me!  :)

I followed this recipe exactly.  I constantly had to keep checking the carrots for doneness I would have liked to have an approximate time.  The exact amount of water needed was not given, so I do think I might have added too much water because I did not like the taste.  I wish I had read the reviews first I would have not used any water and I think it would have tasted better

These were good - not great, just good.  Made for Easter lunch and no one really had much of them.  It was a good use of some carrots I had leftover in the fridge, but didn't think it was anything exceptional.

Yummy!  Haven't had carrots this way before.  I used butter instead of margarine, drained all the water and used regular carrots.  Next time, I'll half the butter as many suggested since it created a butter soup.  These were so irresistable i ate the whole thing by myself in 2 sittings (would have been 1 sitting, but I controlled myself).  Never knew I could love carrots (or any veggie) so much!  I never even buy carrots, but after trying this, I bought 2 more pounds of carrots so I can make some more.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because my picky son said he liked it ok.  The rest of the family thought it was very good.  I used frozen carrots.  Cooked them as directed on bag.  Then made the sauce.  I did not use the water as other directed.  I agree it would be to much liquid with the water.  Without it was perfect!!   Thanks for the recipe.  Its a keeper.

I should've listened to the other reviewers and drained all the water. I only drained half, and it was still way too runny. I will try this again, with all the water drained next time. Maybe that will help the glaze sticka little better.

Really nice, reminded me of glazed carrots my mom used to do. I steamed the carrots and microwaved the brown sugar and margarine in a seperarte dish then mixed it all together. It was very tasty and not overly sweet, though next time I think I'll reduce the margarine, there seemed to be a bit too much.

Awesome. I too didn't save any water. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice to the brown sugar. Very simple to make and quickly devoured. I think next time I will reduce the butter though.

YUM!  I made these last night with steak tips and they were delicious!  Even my picky 22 month old ate a few.  Just as easy as the SteamFresh veggies I usually make, but so much better!

These were a hit for Thanksgiving! I followed other reviews and reduced the water, which was good because there was still a bit too much water! I also steamed the carrots for flavor and nutrition, and added a few generous dashes cinnamon. Yummy and simple.

Steamed the carrots instead of boiling them and drained off all the water.

These would get 5 stars but the recipe is not stated correctly in my opinion.  I've made them three times.  The first time I made just as stated and they were really watery.  So the next two times I drained off ALL of the water from the carrots after cooked and then added butter and sugar and they are the best carrots ever!!

To make this a 5-star review, I drain all the water from the pan and then add the margarine and brown sugar.  I sometimes half the brown sugar with Splenda to save calories.

I've made this recipe as written and it is great.  However, I am on Weight Watchers and needed to lighten this up a bit so I followed the advice of another reviewer to use 1 1/2 tbsp butter and 3 tbsp brown sugar (no water).  It is just as good as the original.  My rating is for both versions of the recipe - you won't be disappointed with either!

These were quite good. They remind me of what my gramma makes for Thanksgiving. But, next time I might cut down on the butter/brown sugar. It made a little too much caramel sauce, and I had to strain the carrots before eating them to avoid a major sugar rush. I will be making these again, though.

I used fresh baby carrots and the rest can be done with your eyes closed.  I tripled the batch for next day left overs and they tasted sweeter from marinating in the butter/sugar.  What a simple, yet delicious recipe.

I thought this was a very good recipe. I have never made carrots as a side dish until now. I added a little parsely flakes before serving. It made a very pretty side dish.

This was so watery that I had to add some cornstarch, it was like carrot soup. Also added cinammon, salt and pepper, and ended up very good. I may make again without the water and with WAY less margerine.

We really liked these!  I used 5 carrots for 2 good sized servings, 2 T light margarine and 3 T brown sugar.  Like others, I made sure the carrots were well drained and I also cooked them over high heat stirring constantly for a couple minutes until most of the liquid in the sauce boiled off and the carrots were kind of caramelized.  My boyfriend thought they tasted like sweet potatoes.  I thought they had the perfect amount of sweetness.  Thanks!

Kids gave this 4 stars, husband gave it 5 stars, so I will make this again. I would have given it 3 stars, but if a kid will eat a vegetable dish, it has to be a keeper:-) I did as reviewers suggested 1) did not leave water in the bottom of the pot. 2) Added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. The sauce was still a bit watery but tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not a carrot fan but I loved these! It's true that you lose all the benefits of vegetables when you boil them but once in a while, why not? Since the title said "buttery", I used butter instead of margarine...

These were good.  I decreased the brown sugar a bit, to around 1/4 cup and they were still plenty sweet.  I also didn't use baby carrots, but just cut regular carrots.  Thanks - we'll have these again!

These are delicious.  They were even a hit with the non-vegetable eaters in my household.  The only addition I made was adding a little vanilla to the butter and sugar.  Kicks the flavor up!  They were delicious and easy.  Thanks!

Okay, now I don't care for carrots much, but my kids do and they said they didn't notice much of a difference from regular carrots.  I can see what they mean...  there wasn't much of a flavor change.  So, I made these again and added some cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg to the second batch and cut way back on the butter to maybe 2T and reduced the sugar as well.  Both times I completely drained the water based on previous reviews and I still did not get much of a sauce to cling to the carrots.  Not bad with modifications.

I didn't like this very much at all.  I left a very little bit of water at the bottom, and even after letting it simmer and sit a little bit, the "glaze" was very runny, and it didn't seem to have that much of a taste to me.  It wasn't worth the effort.  I would rather have made sweet potatoes to get that taste that I was expecting, or just have plain carrots.  The family ate them, but no rave reviews.

Pretty good, maybe a little on the sweet side. I like my carrots sweet though. I don't think you need to leave any water in the pot though, the butter adds plenty of liquid.

I had regular carrots so I used those vs baby carrots. I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (as others suggested) and used butter vs margarine.  My brother-in-law liked it and he doesn't eat vegetables much.  My sister didn't care for it ... too sweet for her.  It was easy to make and good but a bit on the sweet side.  Reminded me of candied yams or sweet potatoes.

My sweet potatoe lovers loved these, But the rest of us didn't.  I cut the sauce in half, added a little whipping cream and a dash of cinnamon.  I usually double all my recipies (not this one though), so if you double your recipies check my reviews for doubling tips.

These were good, just a little too sweet for my taste buds.  I took the advise of some other reviewers and steamed the baby carrots and then melted the butter in the microwave.

I made these as an alternating vegetable to add to my 3 yr olds liking.  As he tends to eat carrots I'm not sure these were a big hit.  As a parent who likes to be sure we get fresh vegetables I like to be sure they maintain their nutritional value. I chose to steam them first and then add them to the sauce.  As for myself i liked them alot

I came across this recipe which is just like one I use; mine's called 'candied carrots' { like the yams...}. My family adores this recipe-I use packaged baby carrots if I have them, and I use my steamer basket to steam them.It's just as quick and makes me think I'm keeping SOME nutritional value to the carrots when I serve them this way!!! I'll be making this yummy dish for Thanksgiving.

I've been looking for a carrot recipe that resembled the glazed carrots that they serve at restaurants. This was it! It was even better because I'm able to control the amount of sweetness it had to it. It won praises at the dinner table; even my vegetable hating little 3 year old loved the carrots. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Tried this out tonight.  It's not bad, although the carrots took a lot longer to cook than the given time of 15-20 minutes.  The sauce wasn't as sweet as I liked, so I added a bit of honey to it as it was simmering.  Tasted much better that way.

I made as is, couple of time and the carrots were delicious and the kids loved them (of course,  they were very sweet) . But the sauce is quite runny and most of it is poured down the sink when done eating. So I started reducing the amount of sugar and butter each time til I got to the  right amount, at least for me. I use half the butter, half the sugar and no water, I still get buttery and sweet carrots that is kid approved and with less calories. I also prefer to steam the carrots verse boiling them cause they keep more nutrients that way.

I was just going to boil some carrots and add butter but decided at the last minute to try this recipe. I'm glad I did b/c the carrots were delicious! The only modification I made was to add some cinnamon. I plan to use this dish for my Christmas dinner!

I'm going to give this a try but it sounds so good I'll give it 5 stars.  I usually cook the carrots with some sugar and when tender, drain and either add Orange Marmalade/Preserves or Apricot Marmalade/Preserves or some of the new product seen on Shark Tank, Mango Mango Preserves with some butter.  Have had many compliments on this.  Anxious to try your version.

I too thought it a little watery and now prefer the carrots steamed and used real butter instead of margarine.  I also thought they needed a touch of something more and added just a pinch of cinnamon, very good that way. Made them again and used some real maple syrup instead of brown sugar. Delicious, but too expensive to do on a regular basis.  May try the regular recipe again sometime and add some maple flavoring at the end to see if I can replicate that taste on a more affordable level.

Very good traditional carrot recipe. Anyone that does not like this has problems with their taste buds! I have never heard of messing up sweet carrots like Rebslo's review said here by adding garlic, rosemary and lemon juice. Why on earth would you do that??? I am stumped. Yuck!

I have to admit I WAS a carrot hater. Until now!! I never thought of this and its such a good idea (super simple) and sooo yummy. Thank you for sharing. Love the sweet taste but not too over powering. Perfect!

I know this is really simple but sometimes I forget I can kick my veggies up a notch. I've used regular sized carrots before, which tend to be a little bitter on their own, and they turned out really delicious. I add a pinch of salt but other than that these are perfect.

Yum! Do Not Overcook Your Carrots. This is a delicious, easy recipe. You can throw in a handful of crispy crumbled bacon before serving.

This recipe was great! Of course the hubby and my boys loved it, with butter and sugar how could you go wrong? I will probably not make this too often being that it is not very healthy even though it is a carrot side dish, but it reminds me of the simple glazed carrots my grandmother used to make for holidays! Amazingly delicious, especially for being so simple! Followed recipe exactly except for using just a tad less sugar.

I am not a huge fan of cooked carrots normally but these ones rocked! I scarfed down my whole serving before digging into anything else on my plate! Like others said, we didn't leave any water in the pot before putting in the butter/brown sugar and our sauce was even still a little runny. We halved the recipe and ate the whole thing between two of us!

Very good, quick & easy. I think I left too much water in pan, instead of a syrup it was a little runny. I added a little salt for taste to. I like that salty sweet combo. I will definitley make this again. Thanks

We thought these were pretty good.  I used white sugar instead of brown because my stepmother made fabulous carrots with white sugar, and butter instead of margarine.  Next time, I will omit the extra water, as others have, because I found the sauce a little too watery; not enough cling to the carrots.

A very tasty way to eat cooked carrots I would use butter over margarine though.... but very simple and tasty... also another alternative is to use honey instead of brown sugar....

Very tasty, but the glaze was way more than I needed for a pound of carrots.

Fantastic! Made for Easter dinner - family raved. I doubled the recipe, used the baby carrots but used only a couple tablespoons of butter and didn't leave water in the pan as others suggested.  My brother-in-law hates veggies and had seconds on these.  But, my kids (3,7) wouldn't eat them -- they are apparently carrot purists.  Thanks for the recipe - a new standard!

Great recipe! I can't believe I haven't tried these before. My kids all ate these up. I steamed my carrots, drained them, and added everything back together in the pot. this couldn't be easier. Will be a weekly staple in my house.

very very good recipe. I doubled the carrots & the butter - left the sugar at 1/3 cup. No one knew there was sugar added - thought the carrots were just extra sweet! Thanks!

A very simple but tasty and healthy way to serve carrots. I used whole carrots broken up into pieces, drained the water off after boiling, and added butter and brown sugar to taste since my quantity of carrots was not exact as specified by the recipe. I didn't really want a true glaze over mine; just enough to lightly coat them after tossing in the sauce. Thanks for the recipe - so simple and adds a little variety to my side dish arsenal.

Tasty and easy.  I didn't weigh my carrots so I am not sure if I started with a pound.  I added 2 T butter and 1/4 cup brown sugar but wound up adding a bit more at the end.  I also drained the water first - I think this is better.  Otherwise it would have been too soupy.  I recommend this recipe, but start slow with the butter and sugar and just add to taste instead of following these measurements.  Some people have more of a sweet tooth.

I used real butter in place of the margarine and skipped the water. I also used whole carrots cut up in place of baby carrots. I let them simmer a while to get the carrots 'candied'. There were no leftovers. Thanks for sharing!

My picky husband devoured these last night!  I didn't leave any water in the pan when cooking the butter and it was plenty juicy enough.  I also sliced up regular carrots because i like the way they cook better.  Next time i think i'll add a T or 2 more of brown sugar, because i just wanted a slight more sugary taste.  These are great!

This is a great way to cook carrots! I just put the carrots in the microwave until tender and tossed it in with the sauce.  I used a tbsp of butter rather than margarine and left out the water, which made the sauce thicker.  Thanks beckie :)

I was very dissapointed in this recipe. I drained all of the water after cooking the carrots as other reviewers suggested. I doubled the recipe for 2 pounds of carrots. The sugar/butter mixture was very runny, and even after simmering in the mixture for 30 minutes or so, it never actually coated the carrots. They just tasted like plain carrots with no butter/brown sugar flavor at all really. I give it two stars only because I happen to like the flavor of cooked carrots with nothing else, but I definately will have to continue looking for a flavorful carrot recipe.

Yummy buttery carrots!  I used 1/2 a family sized bag of frozen baby carrots and boiled them as directed. I then drained the water. I mixed in 3Tbs margerine, 3Tbs brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg to taste.  They were wonderful. I HIGHLY recommend adding the cinnamon and nutmeg because it made ALL the difference!

This was fabulous.  The changes I made were to not leave any water in the pan and I added a good amount of fresh ginger.  The ginger really made these carrots, which is why I couldn't rate 5 stars as I don't think it would have been as great without the ginger.

We didn't care for these. Cooked carrots aren't really our thing, but I thought with butter and brown sugar we would! Not so much! Oh well!

After cooking the carrots, I added butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, fresh ground ginger and fresh ground nutmeg.  It gave the carrots a sweet carmeled flavor.

This was a good addition to my Thanksgiving meal. I added ginger and cinnamon, and it all went over really well. Then I used the leftovers to make carrot bread - no additional spices needed!

This recipe is superb. All of us are health and weight concious so I use 25ml brown sugar and about half the butter in the recipe and it turns out beautifully each time I've made it.

Delicious following the adaptations made by other reviewers - four stars as written.  Used real butter and removed all the water.  Added salt and pepper to serve.  It's a wonderful, simple recipe.

I also steamed the carrots (without retaining any water), and they were delicious.  I feel that the side dish would have felt heartier with regular (not processed baby) carrots instead, however.

These are okay, nothing to write home about. They didn't really glaze up the way I was wanting. I don't know if I did something wrong, the recipe seems so easy but tasted just like slightly sweetened carrots.

I used less sugar and butter. We liked these carrots. I didn't use baby carrots but thin cut full size. I think the baby carrots lose their flavor and color when cooked.

This was simple and added just the right taste to the carrots. I will definitely use this recipe again. Reading the previous reviews, I left hardly any water in the pan, and let the carrots sit on low heat while the rest of the meal finished cooking, so that they could absorb more of the flavor.

These carrots were quite good and very easy to make.  The other reviewers are correct, do not leave water in the pan because the carrots will release so much on their own.  Even after leaving none in it got kind of watery but they retained a little sweetness.  It was enough to interest my toddlers and I love that!

I made these for my children in mind. One loved the sweetness, and the other did not. I added salt to the carrots before adding the glaze to cut the sweetness some. Easy enough that you could make a small portion for those in your family who appreciates them.

This was good with a couple of revisions.  I cooked the carrots in a little water until they were fork tender and all of the water was gone, and then added the butter and sugar right to the pot with the carrots.  I also added a small pinch of allspice and a very small pinch of sea salt.  I cooked all of that on low until the sauce had reduced by half.  It was super tasty and not runny, just good!

Pretty good.  I left too much water in the bottom so my sauce never thickened.  I wish there was an actual measurement for it.

I have made similar several times.  Adjustment, 3 TBSP of Amaretto to the butter/sugar sauce. yummy.  Normally I use white sugar but am trying the brown sugar this time.

I enjoyed the carrots - they came out great! I will definitely make them again. The only thing I will do differently is to cut the carrots in half so they don't take as long to cook (I cooked them 15 min and they were still weren't tender throughout). Thanks for the recipe!

This is a classic, but skip the water and use regular carrots cut up rather than baby carrots. Also, a tablespoon of butter and brown sugar each is plenty.

This is a pretty good cooked carrot recipe.  I agree with the others who said not to leave a little water on the bottom of the pan after draining.  I followed that advice and I think it would have been way too soupy if I hadn't.  These are perfectly sweet.  A tasty twist on plain cooked carrots.

Yummy. I used 1/4 sugar and added the cinnamon just as everyone advised.  It was not too sweet and smelled very good.  I will definitely keep this one for the future.  Thank you for the recipe.

I got one grandson's preferences confused w/ another (Oooops!) & made these carrots when it was just he having dinner w/ us, thinking that he was a carrot lover. He wasn't then but he is now. ;o) He really liked these! I used dark brown sugar & heart healthy margarine... thansk Rebecca!

Mmmmm!  I was looking for a way to jazz up boring carrots and I certainly found it.  I used regular carrots cut up into coins and it was fine.  (Of course, baby carrots look much nicer and require no prep) :)  I'll certainly be using this again!

This is so simple, but it tastes so good!  I love to use this recipe with parsnips, or parsnips and carrots.  I always use butter, and I can't say I ever measure what I put in....just eyeball it.  But what a great idea--brown sugar on veggies!

I've made these type of carrots before and this not one of the better recipes. Sprinkling a bit of cinnamon into the butter sauce would make a world of difference in this particular dish.

I was not as impressed as others with this recipe.  I love sweet dishes, but this one was too much.  The sauce was very runny and the sweetness was overpowering.  Cut the brown sugar by half and add the cornstarch to thicken the sauce and MAYBE you'll have a palatable dish.

My changes....I steam the carrots for about 5-8 minutes or so...they should still have a little crunch.  Put in pan with 2-3 tablespoons butter, couple tablespoons brown sugar, and a couple tablespoons honey (give or take)....lots of fresh black pepper too!  Cook until mixture gets thick and nearly evaporates....Perfect!!!

I'm giving this a four only because I use an easier method - butter (or margerine) tossed in the hot (and fully drained) carrots plus a couple of squirts of  pancake syrup and some salt.  Not as runny and much quicker.  It tastes the same to me, I'm sure it depends on the brand you use.  One reviewer suggested nutmeg - I've even thrown in cinnamon and it is good.

Way too much margarine and sugar!  It tasted fine, but it was so sweet that if I closed my eyes I would never even know that I was eating a carrot. I didn't leave any water in the pan, and after mixing I let the carrots sit for about 10 minutes - the carrots were nicely coated, and the sauce wasn't too thin.  Just too greasy and sweet.  Next time I'll use half the amount of margarine and sugar, and maybe I'll know what vegetable I'm eating.

Since this recipe calls for margarine, should it be called Margariny cooked carrots?  I used regular carrots that I cut up because I find them more flavorful than the baby ones, butter and only 3 Tbsp. brown sugar. Very nice!

I found this recipe very easy to make and the end result was tasty. I added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice for a little tang. My whole family loved it!

Perfect.  Had with ThxGiving dinner with great success.  Best freshly made.  Don't make it ahead of time, though, the sauce pulls moisture out of the carrots and gives you limp carrots and a thin sauce.  (sauce can be saved by boiling until thick again, if needed).

These carrots were delicious. I was nervous about how I would like the candied tast with carrots, but it was great. The glaze is a nice compliment to the flavor of the carrots without overpowering it. I followed others advice and was careful not to leave in too much water and it came out perfect.

This was really very good. I only gave it 4 stars because it was a little watery. I think I may skip the carrot water next time and just sautee the butter & brown sugar. I'll definitely try this again. Thanks!

These were really good. Somehow I was expecting the sauce to be a little bit thicker, but nevertheless, it was very good. Even a friend who doesn't like carrots all that much really liked it because it was sweet. Great and easy!

wondeful!! thanks for the recipe!  i made it for our Easter dinner and everyone loved them and they happened to be the first veggie dish to go!!  thats always a sure sign the recipe was good.  i used butter instead of margarine, didn't use any of the water from cooking the carrots, and melted the butter and brown sugar in the microwave together then wisked the butter and sugar until it was blended perfectly. I did double everything in the recipe because i needed more then one pound.  loved them!!!!

Of all my dishes at my party, this was the big hit! I chose to substitute the water for OJ as suggested.  I also cut up some dill weed for presentation and a tad flavor.  Try this recipe.  It's easy and a great way to eat carrots.

This is a simple and delicious recipe. However, I recommend that you reduce the sauce to a thick syrup consistency before adding the carrots.

Loved it!!!  Very good.  May be to sweet for some.  Makes enough glaze for 2 lbs of carrots.  I drained all of the cooking liquid and used orange juice instead of the water.

Easy, Good, a little sweet. Used frozen crinkle carrots and they cooked up great.

These are absolutely delicious!  I have made them twice so far and have not had any leftovers.  I have even made them ahead of time and then microwaved them for a minute or so before serving and they still taste good.

Unless you are a carrot hater, this is so simple and good.  So easy with the bagged peeled carrots.  Use butter, unless you can't have dairy.

This is a good side dish.As a variation,which we prefer,I chop a few garlic cloves and after cooking the carrots for 10 minutes or so in butter on medium heat, I add the garlic and brown sugar(2 tbsps or so) keep cooking till tender crisp

Very tasty, very easy carrots.  I think I will leave out the water next time - might have been to watery because I used "light" margarine.  Regardless, I had the leftovers for lunch.  Yummy.

Very simple to make.  To keep the carrots flavorful, I steamed them and then put the sauce together with a  bit of water and the other ingredients.  A very light, subtle taste.  I will certainly use it often.

Excellent dish for the holidays.  Really complimented the rest of the meal.  At the last minute I had to double the recipe for more people, but forgot to double the amount of butter used.  They turned out incredible, so next time I will half the amount of butter again.  Great recipe!

These carrots were so good! I kind of just eyeballed it on the time - I added spices to make them have flavor. I just added thyme, salt, and black pepper. It gave it a nice kick without ruining the coziness. I have braces so I was so happy to finally eat carrots again! Great recipe! Loved it!

The only thing I did differently was to use full sized carrots, not baby carrots, sliced uniformly.  Everyone loved them.  They are not overly sweet, but can be easily modified to taste.

Skinned and chopped whole carrots. Steamed and then drained all the water. Put a table spoon of butter and brown sugar in the hot pan afterwords. It was plenty of glaze to cover them all. The wife and kids ate them all up. Will make again.

I used double the carrots and all other ingredients unchanged. I was a little afraid of all that sugar. It was fine for me and my hubby this way, and he doesn't really like carrots.

So easy so simple and so good. I didn't leave any water and the sauce was nice and thick; I also let the carrots sit for 10 minutes in the sauce. Everyone loved them!

very good, boiled about 10 minutes until fork tender.  Didn't save any water in the pot.  Could probably cut the amount of glaze in half (or double the carrots).  Added a little salt

Looking for something fast and simple...This is positively magic.  I did drain off all the water but about 2 tablespoons and then combined with butter and brown sugar.  Let them sit for about an hour before serving.  There were no leftovers.

My picky 5 year old had 2 servings!!  Nuff said!

Very tasty as written. I have made it several times..with a little less sugar and didn't add the water. This time I cut up half an onion and cooked it with the carrots ( my husband likes onions with everything!)  Then after thickening the sauce with a little cold water and cornstarch mixed (we like a nice thick sauce) I added a couple squirts prepared mustard.  Omg it was soo good the contrast  between the sweet and tart everyone loved! Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but just a slight change on already a great recipe .

I have never cooked carrots in my life so I can't say if these turned out they way they did due to that fact or because of the recipe. That said, the carrots tasted like carrots that sat in butter and some brown sugar for awhile. Nothing really very special about that. I will probably try steaming the carrots next time as other users have suggested (however that's done)...

I saved only about two tablespoons of the carrot water and I used real butter in place of margarine.  This recipe will remind me to purchase more baby carrots when I'm in the produce department The carrots came out great. Next time a little cinnamon and a little nutmeg.

My kids.... they will refuse to eat things you KNOW they love, claiming there is something terribly awful about it,  just to be persnickety.  The list of foods that are the exception to this ploy of theirs is quite brief, but THIS recipe is right at the top in bold.  Not only are there never any leftovers, both ask  for seconds, AND later on want more as a pre-bed snack (only they're all gone by then).  Even better, my boyfriend and I both can't get enough of them either.  This is a staple dish in my recipe arsenal and will always be kept handy!

I was looking for a quick recipe to use up some carrots in the 'fridge, and this was perfect. I did modify the recipe some. As others suggested, I used about half the butter, and added a good squirt of honey to help the sauce stick. Will definitely use this again.

This is yummy but needs salt, pepper and some cayenne in the water during boiling. It balances the sweetness perfectly.

I loved these little things!  Made it exactly as written and they were yummy!  I did add a dash of salt, while helped bring out the flavor of the carrots.  I am only giving it 4 stars because the sauce was a bit thin and of the 4 people in my family, only I ate them (but I'm the only one that truly enjoys food).  Thank you for a sweet dinner treat!

Tasty. I steamed my carrots to retain nutritional value and  I didn't reserve any water, just melted the butter (I'm a believer in butter and can't imagine purchasing margarine), and brown sugar and tossed the carrots in. I jazzed them up with a little rosemary and they were tasty little guys. Maybe a little less brown sugar next time tho. Slightly sweet for a weeknight dinner side.

I cooked the carrots (boiled) until nearly done. I doubled the amount of carrots for our family Thanksgiving dinner but did not double the sauce. I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the sauce and poured if over the well drained carrots in the pot. When I transferred it all to a casserole for transport and serving, there was some extra sauce in the pot that I did not keep. The family enjoyed the carrots and the cinnamon and nutmeg gave just a nice hint and dressed them up without being overpowering. I would absolutely make this again.

Very tasty recipe. I poured out all the water after cooking the carrots then cooked them in the butter/sugar blend. I added a dash of cinnamon & a dash of ground nutmeg. I also used half the amount of brown sugar plus 2 Tbsp of Splenda brown sugar blend. We ate every bite.

These were delicious.  If you want a more flavorful sauce add some nutmeg and cinnamon and leave less water in the pot. Baby carrots are already sweet and cooking them brings out more sweetness.  Make sure you only cook your carrots until they are just soft, otherwise they will get mushy.

I cut up regular carrots instead of. using baby carrots, they just have more flavor. When carrots are done to your liking, DRAIN ALL the water... do not leave any water in the pan when melting the butter w/ brown sugar. This makes for a thicker sauce.

Yummy carrots, but very sweet, and the sauce was much too thin.  There was also way too much of it.  I would use about half of the sauce for one pound of carrots (maybe less), leave out the water, and use a little salt to balance the flavors.  I ended up putting a little salt on my carrots when they were on my plate in the end, and it made a massive improvement.

What a great simple recipe for carrots especially for people who like them sweet and so easy.  Thanks...highly recommend.    Maybe add a pinch of salt when cooking the carrots.

I just made this and read some of the other tips so I left out the water and just used the margarine and brown sugar so it wouldn't be runny and they came out great..I would make this again!  Thanks for the tips everyone!1 : )

I made this as the recipe stated and we loved it.  My husband suggested that I put some leftover sweet corn in too, It made a tasty and very pretty side dish. I may try streaming the carrotts next time but not use spices. The carrott flavor was excellent without them.

So simple.  I used large peeled carrots.  Will take the suggestions of others and reduce water left in the pan.  Even though it was runny...very good.

These are very yummy with just the perfect amount of sweetness. I followed other reviewers suggestions and steamed the carrots instead of boiling them. These would make a great side for a turkey dinner.

Pretty good! I've had these many times before, but this is the first time I made them myself. For ease of preparation, these are deserving of 5 stars. Tastewise, I cannot award more than 4 though.... Baby carrots, although very convenient, just don't coat well with the sauce (maybe that's b/c the ones I purchased were quite large). I think carrot coins would have worked better (IMHO). I also should have removed all water (which made for a diluted and runny sauce), so BE SURE to drain WELL (even though beckie directs otherwise) - the butter/brown sugar mixture will be more like a glaze if you do so. Oh, and I don't think 1 lb. carrots is nearly enough to feed 4 people. Everyone at my dinner table had two helpings, so I'm glad I doubled everything! Thanks for sharing, beckie :)

A very good recipe and super easy, too! I followed the advice of several other reviewers and omitted the water from the sauce... and I still had a lot of sauce left over when the carrots were gone. I would make less next time.

Very good flavor!  I used a 12 oz bag of baby carrots and the same amount of butter and brown sugar and they tasted great!  Not too sweet at all.

Excellent!  I haven't had cooked carrots in about 17-18 years after trying them at a friend's house when I was very young and HATING them.  Since I've been trying to eat healthier, I thought I should give them another try and I really enjoyed them!  I didn't get very many since I made them for my parents, boyfriend, and two very ravenous friends, but what I had was wonderful and, obviously, everyone else enjoyed them too!

Quick, easy and tasty. I cut up regular carrots. Steamed them as recommended by others. Added butter, brown sugar and salt to taste. I like the salt/ sweet combination. Family all like them. Will make again.

I used whole organic carrots and sliced on a diagonal (like in the picture).  Steamed them for 7 minutes until soft, then added butter and the brown sugar.  They were outstanding and I received many compliments.

Skipped the water in the pan and just put brown sugar and butter. Then added carrots in. Perfect and not runny. Great!

Make sure you drain all but a little bit of water.  The result is absolutely fantastic.  Not as sweet as you might think.  Keeping the carrots in longer makes them taste like yams.  Pull them out and they are the sweetest, crunchiest things you can imagine.  Yummy!

Very nice carrot recipe.  Made for Thanksgiving and had no complaints but no raves either.  Most likely because the main courses are usually all raved out by the time we get to the vegie, it's just not "up there" with the rest of the meal.  Very good though and I'll make at home for side dishes in the future.

Even my carrot hating husband said these carrots were great! My only complaint is that the sauce was pretty soupy. Next time I will make without the residual water like other reviewers.

My family doesn't like cooked carrots, only I do. I made these & I liked them a lot. My mom, who REALLY hates carrots, said they weren't that bad, and so did my dad. My picky little sister didn't like them. So, it just depends on taste, I guess. They were sweet, which was really good.

I grew up on these carrots! I love them. For those of you wanting to "spice them up", my mom sometimes put about 2 tbsp dijon mustard and a little black pepper in hers. It may sound like a strange combination with the brown sugar, but it is delicious!

This recipe was VERY good!  After reading the reviews, I followed the other's advise and drained all the water.  I also added nutmeg and cinnamon-2 dashes of each, and let the carrots marinate in the sauce after I poured sauce over carrots.  VERY good!!

Added a little rosemary to the carrots. Tasted good, but the most of the glaze did slip off the carrots and pool at the bottom of the dish.

This was a great recipe. I've never made these before b/c I'm the only one who likes carrots, but will definitely again. I listened to the other reviewers and threw in a splash of nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla which made for a really interesting taste! It was not too sweet for us, I did not put the full amount of brown sugar in either. The only problem I had was getting it to stick at all to the carrots. I steamed my carrots, then put them in the butter mixture without any water and it was still really watery. Next time I will let the carrots marinate in this for awhile as the only taste of the mixture was from the small residue left on them when I picked them up on my fork. My kids (3 & 5) ate them without any complaints either, my 3 yr old even said how much she liked them!! My husband liked them too, not loved them but liked them.

This recipe was so good! I HATE carrots and can't eat them raw. However I am trying to get more veggies in me. I did what the other person did, dumped all the water out because I like sauces creamy. I used 15 carrots though.

Nice easy recipe for carrots. Next time I'll add a pinch of salt and maybe some corn starch to thicken the sauce. Once I added the sauce to the carrots it got really watery (and I didn't use any water when I made it!).

My kids love these.  There is a lot of sauce left in the bottom of the bowl.  Would probably work with twice as many carrots, or half the sauce.  Just my opinion though.

These are the best carrots. I used one 16 oz bag of regular carrots and sliced them. Everyone loved them. The flavor reminds me of yams. The title should be Sweet Carrots. I will make these often.

These were great.  Mainly because my kids liked them and they were quick and easy.  I tried them after dinner when I was putting the left overs away and they were awesome.  Next time I will cook them before I prepare the rest of my meal and let them set or put them in the oven.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner. I thought it was a little bland, so I added some basil and toasted pecan pieces. I also let it boil longer because there was too much liquid. That really helped the sauce carmelize. I will definately make this again.

Slightly bland - the sugar and butter seem to make a sauce that doesn't cling to the carrots.  But it's still a nice flavor.  Next time I will try steaming the carrots instead of boiling them to try to retain more vitamins; then I will use less butter so they aren't so saucy.  But I will make this again.

Lately I have not been bothering to cook the carrots in water first.  I melt butter and EVOO and the brown sugar then throw the carrots in and just let them cook while I make the rest of dinner.  It works out great and is less work.  In a time crunch though, I would cook them in the water first.

I really liked this recipe and so did every one else! They didnt last long! I added a little more  brown sugar to thicken the sauce and the longer I let them sit the more flavor they absorbed. I will definatley make them again.

Funny that the recipe should be called "buttery" yet it doesn't contain any butter! I tried this with cut-up whole carrots instead of baby carrots and used butter instead of margarine, but found them rather bland. Added some salt, ginger, lemon juice and a touch of cayenne pepper & they turned out to be pretty tasty ... but at that point, they weren't too close to the original recipe.

This was definitely a big hit.  There was way too much liquid, so next time, I will use less butter/margarine.  I also added some lemon juice and fresh dill for added spice.

A great way to serve carrots with a slightly sweet dish.  Go great with porkchops with a sweeter topping (brown sugar or cranberries).

This is not exactly what I was looking for. I am not fond of cooked carrets but I was thinking that they may tast like candy yams, but they did not. I thought they were nasty. My kids and my husband on the other hand loved them. So I probably won't make them for me in the future. But if that is the way I have to give my 1 and 2yr old their veggies then I will make it for them.

This was really quite good.It has a really nice buttery aroma (i use butter instead of margarine) & taste equally great. Almost fail-proof & super easy recipe to try-out.

If you don't like cooked carrots like me you won't like this. I know I need to eat more carrots and thought this would be a good way to get them down, but not so. In order not to waste what I had made, I threw it all in the blender, pureed it, put it in a bowl, and served it with crumb topping. This tasted better, comparable to a sweet potato dessert.

Running short of time, I used canned carrots instead of fresh, adding them at the end to warm them up since they are already cooked. I don't use margarine so I used butter instead. Carrots came out very good tasting.

These are simple to make, but they taste pretty simple.  They just taste like soft carrots - no kick.  But because of the simplicity, I gave them 4 stars.

I wanted to try something new w/ carrots but the sauce turned out VERY watery and did not thicken very much, ending up just floating on the bottom of the bowl when served.  Tasted good, though, and I did use "I can't believe it's not butter" spread instead of regular butter so that might have been it.

I made these trying to spice up normally boiled carrots.  They smelled great, but I didn't get any reaction out of anyone.  I had to ask if they were good.  My husband said they were kind of sweet - what did you do to them?  Not sure if that was good or bad.

Used real butter instead of margarine. Added a little bit of fresh ground pepper. My husband and I liked it but the kids didn't.

I haven't even made them yet but I'm giving the recipe 5 stars. Most of the time I read the reviews on a recipe before I make it, and by the way it sounds, instead of putting cornstarch in it, I'm just going to use less water and more butter than it says...common sense

I thought the sauce was just wonderful!  I didn't cook my carrots long enough, though, because they were still a little too firm. I did add the cinnamon and corn starch, as per previous reviews.

I took these carrots(made to the letter with the addition of a little salt and fresh ground pepper)and barbecued chicken to my Moms' house today for a quick lunch and it was fantastic.The sweet carrots along side a slightly spicy chicken was superb-perfect combo.

My picky 5 year old did not like these at all.  My other children ate them, but said they liked regular carrots better.  It just doesn't seem like you are getting the healthy benefit out of vegetables if they are slathered in butter and sugar.

My family LOVED the carrots; even my 4 year old that will only eat raw carrots ate them.  This is a great recipe!  I followed the directions exactly except I did boil the carrots a little longer because I don't like crunchy carrots and they came out PERFECT!!!  This recipe is a keeper!!

Excellent recipe. Very quick and easy to make, and tasty. Even my picky, rarely eats veggies boyfriend liked them. I used baby carrots, so it even ended up looking fairly sophisticated. Will definitely use again!

The sauce was thin and didn't add much flavor to the carrots at all, I would have rather have just eaten them plain. Not even my sugar-loving 8-year-old liked them. Not worth the extra sugar and calories. My crescent rolls tasted really good dipped in the sauce, though!

These carrots were definitely buttery and sweet.  I made them with a generous amount of brown sugar and no reserved water and my "glaze" was still very runny.  The carrots were yummy but you would not want to serve this to company as the juice runs *everywhere!*

Let me state outright...I don't like veggies. But my wife chooses the sides, and she wanted this one. She made it exactly as the recipe directed, and it was  quite good. The carrots were relatively crunchy so if you like softer carrots, boil them longer. The brown sugar glaze was excellent as it complemented the carrots nicely...not too much sweet to overpower the flavor of the carrots. I wonder how these would taste with a teaspoon of allspice or nutmeg. Hmmmm.

Very yummy.  Ingredients compliment each other very well.  I forgot to cover the pot, but I don't think it made a difference.  This was very good - a good way to get the kiddos to eat carrots.  Thanks Rebecca.

These were pretty good! At first, when I tasted right after finishing them, I was disappointed. But after letting them set for 10 minutes they were great!!! I served them with a smoked ham. The slightly salty ham was great ran through the sweet juice from the carrots! Will make again! Thanx for the recipe!

Nice flavor, but every time I make this there is too much water left in the pan.  I always add more sugar too...I like mine a little sweeter.  Overall, great recipe.  I've used it many times.

We found these carrots to be VERY sweet and the carrot flavour wasn't really noticed.  I didn't leave water in with the carrots as per other reviewers suggestion, and it wasn't needed...the butter/brown sugar sauce was very runny.  I left the carrots on the stove in the sauce and tried to reduce the sauce a little, but was unsuccessful.  I think these would be better with something to cut the sweetness, perhaps some orange rind or fresh ginger.

These were really, really good.  My husband has asked me to make them regularly, and he's picky about vegetables.  I did take others' advice and did not retain any of the water.  Even with doing that, the sauce is very thin, but VERY tasty.  I will be making these often.  Thank you!

I was looking for a way to jazz up some canned carrots and gave this a try.  Used two 14 oz cans, light butter and the brown sugar.  Using two cans of the carrots might have been a stretch.  Otherwise, it was a decent change of pace.

I'm not a big fanned of cooked carrots... UNLESS they're cooked like this!  YUM!  It's hard to believe two simple ingredients can make carrots taste so good!

This was my first time making cooked carrots and I didn't realize how long it would take to get them soft... they turned good- better the second day.

Beautiful flavour! I added sliced parsnips (because I love them) and served with Christmas dinner. They were a huge hit! And so easy! Thank-you for the recipe.

Made this for New years dinner, my friend said "That looks like a lot of carrots" and I said "Everyone says they never have any left. No surprise- there were no leftovers- these were great! Followed the suggestion - did not save any water - not too sweet- quite great!! Thanks!

Delicously sweet!  I did not leave water in the bottom of the pan, as many other reviewers suggested, and it turned out fabulously.  My family ate every bite.

Simply delicious!  I increased this to 16 servings and took to a holiday party.  I was told to always offer to bring the carrots!  I did follow other recommendations to drain off all the water.

These were pretty good.  Not as sweet as I thought they would be.  The sauce was runny so it basically fell off the carrots.  Will try making these again but will try to make the sauce much thicker!

This recipe was wonderful.  My very picky children, including my husband, loved these carrots and even ate them cold.  Very easy to make. A nice change to just regular carrots.

They were nice for a change but definetly not something to make every time carrots are on the menu.  My family didnt rave about them.  Very easy prep though!

Good flavor.  Maybe I left too much water in the bottom of the pan to mix the butter & brown sugar with because it ended up being very watery.  The flavor was great though!  I left them in the fridge overnight for the flavors to mingle.

These were a little too sweet for me - maybe I used too much sugar?  But the hubby has said this is the only way he'll ever eat carrots, 5 stars from him.  Thanks for getting him to eat veggies!

Have never eaten carrots like this before.  It's just like carrot lollies.  Very nice, but not really like eating vegetables.

I love these carrots.  They are sooo easy, (nobody could mess up this recipe) and they are very flavorful.  This one is in my permanent recipe collection.

This was ok.. i think if you really want it to have an impact you should make it kind of like a glaze, otherwise its just like water and it drips of, not leaving behind a real kind of flavor.

These were the first "grown-up" carrots I gave to my 14-month-old. I did cut down on the sugar (I think carrots are plenty sweet), but she loved them! We also make the "Carrot Cafeteria Souffle" which she loves too! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Quite tasty! The hint of sweetness really added to the carrots' appeal.  It wasn't as amazingly wonderful as I had expected (based upon reading the other reviews)...but it was a good solid side dish, perfect for weeknight meals!

Yummy!  My husband didn't really enjoy them, but he is opposed to any sweet carrots.  I loved them.  They were fast & easy.  Tasted great left over too.  I'll keep this one.

Very good carrots. We all enjoyed them very much. Even my 17 month old who is very picky. I would make them again in a heartbeat. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

All I have to say is...YUM!  I could eat these all by itself for a tasty snack!  It would probably be popular at church potlucks!  I made this with Caramel Apple Porck Chops, and Harvest Thyme Rice, both from this site.

This recipe is easy, fast and very flavorful. I served them with the Apricot Porkchops (also found on allrecipes) which madea a great combo. Highly recommended for the cooking impaired like myself.

Very good.  The brown sugar-butter mixture was very tasty.  I cut down on the butter (I used real butter) somewhat, but it still came out good.

My family enjoyed these, especially my baby, since he was able to pick them up.  We renamed these "Candy Carrots" for our picky 3-year-old.  Very easy to make!

My husband (the anti-veggie man) went to the store just to buy carrots so I would make these again!  The kids could help and they loved it too!!  Just the right amount of sweetness... compliments a lot of main dishes.  A new staple in our menu plans!

These carrots are mildly sweet. I would say that there is a perfect balance of sugar and butter. I recommend it to everyone. My one year old ate them up!

My husband didn't realize there was anything different about the carrots; he thought they just had butter on them. Tasted fine, but no need to add brown sugar when you can't taste it.
