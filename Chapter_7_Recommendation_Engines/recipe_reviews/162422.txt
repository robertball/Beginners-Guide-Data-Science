Lots of “mmmm-ing” going on at the supper table tonight.  This may be simple to prepare, with simple ingredients, but it is a spectacular pasta dish.  I followed the recipe for the most part, but adjusted the amounts of a few ingredients, cutting back fairly significantly on the crushed red pepper flakes (to about 1/8 tsp.), the artichoke hearts (about half the amount called for),  and the lemon juice (again, about half the directed amount).   Delicately flavored with a beautiful and elegant presentation.  I served this with grilled chicken, but this could easily stand on its own.  (Note: If your pasta is dry it is easily remedied by adding some of the reserved pasta cooking water)

This was very good, the only thing i found was that the final sauce was just a little to thin, so i put everything back in the pot and boiled, stirring constantly to reduce the sauce and make it thicker. My kids loved it so much that i have no left overs, and it makes a lot. thanks for the great recipe

Wow!  This was simple to prepare, yet so delicious you would think it took me awhile to make.  I made just a few mods - left out the Parmesan and added some lemon pepper seasoning to the final product  - oh and I added a bit of butter to my sauteed shrimp for a bit more flavor.  I think really small mods - but this dish was a hit and a certain keeper!!! Thanks Rentsch!

I have made a version of this for years and it is always a favorite.  This is the first time I added the artichokes and it was a hit.  The only change I would make is to saute the garlic and crushed red pepper for a few minutes prior to adding the shrimp.  I would also use uncooked shrimp because the cooked shrimp get overcooked before everything is warm enough.  This is always a fast and delicious meal.

I thought this tasted great and was very different!  It was also very quick to make.  I used regular cooked shrimp instead of salad shrimp.  I also used 7 oz. artichoke hearts because that was all I had.  It tasted fine with the artichokes cut in half, so I think 14 oz. might have had an overwhelming flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

This was just okay. It didn't have a ton of flavor. I would be willing to make some adjustments and try again. The notes I made for next time: add some parsley and/or thyme, white wine, and some capers or green olives.

This was wonderful and quick! what an easy clean up! My husband hates tomatoes and onions, so this dish was perfect for him! I changed the recipe slightly as we really like spice, so I doubled/tripled the red pepper flakes. I also added in green sliced olives and fresh asparagus. Instead of shrimp I used bay scallops. I cooked the fresh asparagus first, to soften it in the same oil that I was heating up the red pepper flakes and garlic. I waited a bit to add the bay scallops as they cook up fast. The green and black olives, artichokes, and scallops mixed with the asparagus made the pasta beautifully colored as well as delicious!

i used shallots and hot pepper flake, defrosted frozen artichoke hearts (trader joes) and through in a couple of slices of chopped prosciutto ... then a couple of small spoonfuls of pesto.  added shrimp (raw) and cooked through - finished with 1/2 fresh lemon (squeezed) and fresh grated parm.  i think white wine would be good in this, but i didn't have any. served over fresh pasta.  my husband (picky) loved it.  thanks!  although i didn't follow exactly, a great guide to a great meal.  i will definately refer to this again

The flavor was good but I thought the pasta was dry. I think the 5 minutes to cook the pre-cooked shrimp was too long.  My shrimp was over cooked.  I think 2-3 minutes would have been enough. Once you add the hot linguine the shrimp continue to cook.  I also added 1 teaspoon of seasoning salt and a tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley for more flavor.

I made this without the shrimp (we are vegetarians) and it was very good. You wouldn't have known it was supposed to have it. A little too spicy for my 3 year old but everyone else raved!

Loved it! The artichokes I had were marinated, but if anything I think that made it even better. I did leave out the olives because I don't like them. Everything else I did as written. This pasta is easy to make, looks like you fussed, and tastes amazing...my three favorite things in a recipe!

This was pretty good. I used marinated artichoke hearts so I just used the oil from those. I do think this needs more color, next time I'm going to add green onions or fresh parsley.

As is, this was okay, but it lacked flavor. I ended up adding broccoli, tomatoes, and a splash of soy sauce to make it better. I may try it again with a few more spices or a thicker sauce.

This was really good!  I was looking for a recipe to use up the artichokes I had in the pantry and stumbled across this.  So glad I did!  I didn't have any black olives and cut back on the red pepper flakes because we dont' like a whole lot of spice but other than that followed the recipe.  Will definitely keep this is the rotation.

This is one of our favorite recipes. Sauteeing the red pepper flakes in the oil gives the dish a beautiful flavor. This is what got me and my bf started on whole wheat pasta, and the dish is elegant, healthy and luscious!

We enjoyed this a lot, the sauce was very rich. I used artichokes packed in water (not marinated) the recipe doesn't specify water or oil packed but my partner assumed it was oil marinated because it was so flavorful with the flavor from the garlic and olives and shrimp. I didn't measure the lemon, just used a whole average size lemon and squeezed the juice in with a citrus squeezer. I also got fresh olives from the Whole Foods olive bar instead of getting canned, I had to slice them myself but that probably made the whole thing a lot tastier than if I went for a can. Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe as it was with the slight variation that the package of shrimp I had was 12 ounces instead of 16, there was still plenty of shrimp (in fact I'd say the perfect amount, more might have been overload). Along with a salad this was one of the first meals I made after the birth of our son and it was nice and easy but luxurious enough to make us feel a little special and it was nice to get away from the frozen food we were eating for a few days. It's nice to be back in the kitchen.

This was good, just not great. I made it the first time according to directions but no one really loved it. On my second try, I added sun dried tomotoes and swapped out greek Kalamata olives for the black. I used the required lemon juice but added about 2 tsp of grated lemon zest as well and the family declared it a winner.

Very good. I did use only one garlic clove which was plenty for me as I am not a garlic lover. I thought this recipe had a nice balance of flavors. Next time I will add a few more shrimp. Thanks for the recipe.

This was excellent. I used frozen shrimp that I already had but cooked them in advance and it worked perfectly. Also added more olives and added mushrooms shortly after the initial ingredients started cooking . Otherwise made as instructed and it was quite flavorful. May consider other reviewers suggestions for additional spices but not really needed. Will definitely make again and consider it dinner party worthy.

I cut the recipe in half (for two), used garlic-stuffed olives I had in the fridge, used a lot more garlic, sloshed in some white wine instead of lemon juice and some passata (strained tomatoes). Fresh ground pepper added and pecorino.

Next time, I would add pesto. It was too bland with just olive oil and garlic, although it was healthy!

It was okay. Didn't have much flavor, and probably won't make again. Too many new recipes to try, so why spend time trying to fix this one.

I made this recipe using "artichoke linguine". Followed it exactly including the red pepper flakes. Worried that it might be too spicy but it was not and was perfect and delicious. Also topped off with freshly chopped parsley which added a nice fresh note. Will be making again.

Added sun-dried tomatoes, olives and oregano. Left out the hot pepper flakes. But it still seemed a bit bland. Certainly easy.

Next time we will thicken the sauce left from the artichoke/shrimp with flour and Parmesan cheese and add it to the mix.  That will bind things together better.  Otherwise, the flavor is very good.

This was really good  with some minor modifications.  I cut the recipe in 2/3 for two of us and I used a little more olive oil.  I used kalamta olives rather than ripe olives and omitted the salt.  Yum.    I found the red pepper spice perfect, a simple recipe like this requires really high quality ingredients.

Enjoyed this quite a bit - the bright flavours make it a nice change to other pasta dishes.  I started by sautéing some diced onion, and added cherry tomatoes later.  I used white wine in place of lemon juice, and garnished with a squeeze of lemon.

This tasted really good, definitely don't omit the parmesan cheese at the end because it really enhanced it.   The only thing I will probably change for next time is to use fresh shrimp.

This recipe is excellent! I used penne because I didn't have linguine and full size shrimp; neither change made a difference. This recipe is going into rotation at my house. Very easy to make and very delicious. Refrigerates well, too.

This was so easy to make and really good! I should have added a little more red pepper flakes for more kick, but otherwise I'll definitely be making this again!!!

This was very good & easy to make.  Next time I might cut back on the pepper flakes though because it was a bit spicy.  Also, I only used 1 clove of garlic and it was plenty.
