I've made this soup twice now and I will say I prefer NOT blending any of the soup- we like chunks of veggies - not pureed veggies! Also, when I blended, I only blended half of the mixture so that there still were some chunks. Instead of just carrot OR celery stalk I used both - and 2 of each since we love veggies in our house. I also use orzo instead of rice and added 1T of hot red pepper sauce (rooster) when I added the soy sauce. Not TOO many changes but enough to make it a family favorite.

I made this soup for my roommates and it came out wonderfully.  I used both carrots and celery, I substituted vegetable stock for chicken broth and I let it simmer for close to three hour.  I chose not to blend it at the end to leave it a little chunky.  Everyone gobbled it up.

Easy to make and quite good. I used wild rice and portobello and button muchrooms. Low salt/no fat chicken broth lowers fat content, also. All in all, fabulous meal.

This ended up as a tasty, hearty, vegetarian soup following the advice of  other reviewers: added garlic, more carrots and celery, dry sherry and Sirucha hot pepper sauce.  I used 4 portobello mushroom caps, home made vegetable broth, 3 Tbs. brown basmati rice and 3 Tbs red lentils and simmered for about an hour an a half until the brown rice was soft and the lentils disintegrated.  

This made it acceptable for South Beach Diet phase 2.  I may try to make it creamy by imersion blending it with the fat free half and half I impulsively purchased in a SBD shopping frenzy.

I followed the recipe with two exceptions.  I added two cloves of crushed garlic and 1/4 cup of sherry.  The soup was wonderful!

This tasted wonderful!  I used 1/2 cup rice to make it thicker, and I did not process the contents in a blender, I left it as is, and it came out absolutely wonderful!  This is definitely a recipe that you can have fun with... my father suggested adding fresh, crisp bean sprouts right at the end (mixed in right before serving) to add another texture to it.  Thanks!

I omitted the soy sauce and opted to use lower sodium veggie broth to cut down on the salt content.  I also added a few cloves of garlic.  Turned out VERY yummy.  I will be making this again for sure.

Yummy! I will be making this soup again soon since hubby and I ate almost all of it in one sitting. I recommend not adding additional salt. I used low sodium soy sauce with no extra salt and it was perfect. I also used barley instead of rice and did not puree the vegetables. I'm sure it would be equally good pureed - we just happen to like the chunkiness. You won't be disappointed with this soup!

Very tasty soup.  I added garlic and carrots and extra celery.  Did not blend the soup.  I'll use less soy sauce next time but that is a personal preference.

Excellent. I used brown rice, low sodium soy, vegetable broth, and olive oil because that's what I had available. I tasted the broth before re-introducing the blended ingredients and I think the blending is very necessary to the flavor of the soup.

I made this, sticking to the recipe, carrots, no celery, and not blending the veggies at the end. Fabulous, no leftovers. Even my picky 2 yr old ate this. My coworker made this same recipe, with celery, adding a little cream, wild rice, and blending at the end. Again it was great. I prefer the non blended version as it is more filling, however the blended with cream would made a yummy base for stroganoff. Add a little sour cream, garlic and serve over meatballs and egg noodles and you're good to go with left overs (if there are any!) Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper.

I had to keep adding broth to make this come out like a soup but in spite of this it turned out more like a rice soup, rather than a mushroom soup--which was not what I was aiming for.  I ended up just spooning this over some plain rice for flavor but this certainly was not the original plan. Wouldn't bother with this recipe again.

Delicious and hearty. I didnt have any onions on hand so i just added celery and carrots and chopped up a small clove of garlic. I also didnt think i'd like rice floating in my soup so i boiled it separately and then mashed it and threw it in the blender with the base. To add make it seem a little richer and more decadent and topped it with a touch of evaporated milk to make it a  little creamy. Delish!!

I love this soup both plain and my variation of it.  I used a lower sodium chicken broth. I actually cooked some lightly seasoned chicken thighs until the meat was falling off of the bone and added into the soup and it was AWESOME!

I just made this soup for the first time and it was perfect! I added Teriyaki sauce, as I did not have Soy, and instead of celery I used carrots. I also added green onion, which was an excellent option. I also added a dash of Cayenne pepper for some heat. I think what made it great was how chunky the mushrooms were, as I did not put the ingredients into the food processor, I didn't want a mushy soup. This was key. Overall I would make it again, especially since it is only 70 cal/serving!

In the cold weather we try to make a different soup each week.  This was the soup of the week.  This is not your ordinary mushroom soup.  It is the healthy version without the heavy cream.  I followed the recipe except I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (sorry vegetarians).  My husband loved it.  He told me it was a definite keeper

Great base to work with.  Second time I omitted the carrot, used organic vegetable broth, added about a 1/2 inch chunk of grated ginger.  I added cubed med-soft tofo at the end and served it sprinked with sliced green onions.  I had used an organic brown rice mixture, but will probably omit for just tofu next time.  Too pretty to blend.  Perfect the way it is.  It may reduce while simmering, so  be prepared to add more stock.

Have made this many times, just kept forgetting to review.  I converted it to a crockpot, use 8 cups of broth, 6 tablespoons of soy sauce and add some garlic.  I also add 2 frozen chicken breasts, then shred right before serving, to make a complete meal.  I cook brown rice separately, then add 1/2 cup to each bowl when serving.  Complete meal,low calorie, healthy, tastes great.  A winner!

Delicious! I used fat free low sodium broth, and cut out the soy sauce due to allergies. I also used brown rice because it was what I had on hand. I only blended 1/2 the veggie/rice because I like chunks of mushrooms. Satisfying, healthy and cheap too!

Loved this recipe.  Used a few different types of mushrooms chopped very finely and added a few dashes of sherry at the end. I also used a few spring onions as I did not have enough brown onions

Made as written except left chunky -- yum!  Next time going to try skipping the saute and substituting barley for rice.

Really very good. I have the following pointers: use baby bella mushrooms instead of button, use jasmine rice, and really do saute the veggies before adding the broth.

This was very good. I didn't put in the carrots or celery but that was because I didn't have them. Other wise I followed it to a T and it turned out very good. If your sensative to salt make sure you use low sodium chicken broth and soy sauce.

Delicious and easy! I used vegetable broth instead of the chicken and substituted barley for the rice. Yummy!

This is a great soup. I did substitute the celery for carrot as mentioned in the recipe.  I'm not a fan of celery and I was at the farmer's market this morning and picked up some great carrots.  As another reviewer mentioned I only  pureed half the mushrooms, carrots, onions and rice. Which is why I only gave it four-stars. It thickened up the soup nicely and the flavor was great.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Made this soup exactly per recipe. Will never make it again. First there is a reason nobody has posted a picture of this soup. It is really not attractive -- looks a bit like mud in a bowl. Second, it's way way too salty, my husband and I both couldn't even get thru one bowl.

A tad bit disappointed in the recipe because it turned out bland without enough personality to stand on its own. Added some more soy sauce and then added some rice vinegar, which did perk things up some.

Don't like mushrooms, used meatballs instead.  Since I'm a vegetarian I substituted marinara sauce for the chickens broth.  Didn't have rice so I used  linguini.  Only thing I did different was add some parmesan cheese after plating. Served with garlic bread. This was delicious!

Excellent recipe.  I left it chunky and had to add a little bit of water at the end.  I also threw in a couple of handfuls of kale.  Very filling and comforting for a cold fall day.  Thanks so much.

I thought this was great.  The only things I changed are that I did not blend anything and added a little flour/water mixture at the end to thicken it up just a little.  I also added some garlic.

This was a good soup but it could have been better. Next time I think I will use beef broth instead of chicken and maybe I'll add some black-eyed peas to the mix.

I should have followed the advice of some of the others and not blended it all together. The flavor was good but the presentation was poor.

BEST Mushroom soup ever.  I used 3/4 cup of wild rice and beef broth instead of the chicken.  This will become a staple on my new diet.

I used portabellos and button mushrooms and simmered in a crock pot for two hours. Very tasty... a little salty, so I'll probably use a low-sodium broth next time. Bachelor-friendly.

We loved it.  I took others advice and did not blend the vegetables.  Instead of 1/4C white rice, I used an entire 6 oz. box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice. I also used about 1/2 of the seasoning packet that comes with the rice.  That eliminated the need to add salt,just added some pepper. I will definitely make this again.

This soup not only tasted great, but was easy to prepare.  I suggest blending only half the soup and leaving the other half chunky, then mix together.  Also great over egg noodles, or as a sauce for chicken!
