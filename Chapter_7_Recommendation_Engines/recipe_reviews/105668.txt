This didn't work at all.  I followed the directions exactly, and when the cooking time was up, I had something that resembled four bowls of chocolate soup.  I tried cooking them for another hour, but to no avail- they remained soupy.  I was very disappointed as I was trying to make these as a low-carb dessert for some friends we were having over.  Beware if you want to try this recipe.

These are heaven in a cup!! If you use the 7oz. ramekins, cook at 300F for 30 minutes and then turn the temperature up to 375 for another 20 minutes. And milk chocolate works just as well as the dark/bittersweet. TRY IT!!

These never set for me.  The sides at the top kinda did after baking them for an extra 30minutes, so I thought that would be enough and started to cool them.  After 2 days in the refrigerator only the top layer had set, and underneath was still all liquid.  And they had a weird taste to them as well, probably cos they hadn't set right.  Won't make these again.

I took this recipe and put all the fat back into it and it was deliciou!  I used normal milk, light cream, real sugar, and coolwhip.  I substituted the espresso mix for raspberry hot cocoa mix.  It was definitely rich and yummy!

For a SB diet recipe this is great. I have a huge 'sweet tooth' so I am always looking for lower carb sweets. I love this one, the flavor is great. I have made this many times and every time I am in chocolate heaven.

If you are a chocolate lover, you may want to add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the mix to give the flavor of this dish a kick!!!

A friend of mine made these for a get- together and they were SOOOO good! I would have never known they were low carb. They taste rich and chocolaty and delicious! I will add this to my recipe box and make many times in the future!
