This recipe is so close to mine that I wanted to review it and give a few tips that I use when making my cabbage rolls.  First, not only should you drain the sauerkraut, but you should also rinse it thoroughly and squeeze the excess water out.  This removes the brine that seems to give sauerkraut it's bad rep.  A good old world recipe boils the cabbage head and the shortcut of freezing the head overnight leaves the cabbage leaves rubbery.  It's an old world recipe and shortcuts like this are not good unless you just hate cabbage and throw the leaves out anyway.  There is a large hard vein that runs down the center of the cabbage leaves near where it comes off the core.  This can be cut out so your cabbage leaf is tender.  That hard vein cannot be tenderized so get it our of there.  Use smoked bacon-as it cooks, it helps to further tenderize those cabbage leaves as the fat renders down on top of rolls, plus it adds a smoky flavor to the sauerkraut.  Last of all, (no offense to anyone) the flavor of pork mixed with beef cannot be replaced by ground turkey.  It does change the flavor and taste of this old world recipe and the fat content of the pork helps to tenderize the cabbage covering the rolls.  I suggest you try the recipe as directed to try it old world then review it.  (Most people don't go through the trouble of making cabbage rolls very often so live a little here. If you plan to fix this frequently, then add your ground turkey and make it more healthy.

FANTASTIC!!!  I am a huge fan of stuffed cabbage to begin with, but this recipe improved upon my already good stuffed cabbage recipe.  I loved the ground pork with the ground beef.  The sauerkraut was a great addition to the cabbage.  I may try adding an additional can of soup next time to thicken up the sauce so it is more like gravy.  Be prepared!  This makes a lot of food.  (Good for leftovers.)  I didn't have a big roasting pan so I had to split this up amongst two 9 x 13 size pans.  I am going out to buy the right size pan for the next time I make this.  Thanks for the recipe.  My whole family enjoyed it!

I've been making stuffed cabbage for quite a few years but wanted to find something just a little different; and this was!  We absolutely loved it!  My husband loves sauerkraut, my kids hate it and truthfully, coming from a german family and eating is constantly while growing up I didn't care if I ever had it again.  Needless to say, my husband thought this was terrific, my kids didn't even realize they were eating sauerkraut and I thought the kraut, coupled with the bacon added a very wonderful flavor. I'll make stuffed cabbage this way from now on. Thanks!!
UPDATE! Since my recent move to Kentucky, I found out that the love of my life hadn't had a cabbage roll since he was just a kid. With that I just knew I had to make this particular for him. Kelly, I wish I could tell you how much he loved this! He actually said this was the most delectable dish he's had in a very long time! Nice compliment for both of us! Thanks again!

This is very similar to a recipe I copied from the Chicago Tribune many years ago. It was the authentic stuffed cabbage a downtown Polish church made once a year to rave reviews. It adds 1-2tsp. of marjoram (wonderful), 2 garlic cloves instead of the garlic salt and a teaspoon of caraway seeds on top of the rolls before the sauerkraut. I think I just use 28oz of pureed canned tomatoes. I also put extra cabbage leaves on the top to protect the sauce and then discard them. Best thing, it improves with age. Just gets better and better!!! Fry up a little bit of the meat mixture and see if it is to your liking. You can then adjust seasonings to suit yourself.God Bless Grandmothers!

This recipe is a ton of work, but gets rave reviews. Allow yourself at least three hours total time. A couple of suggestions:  * Salt the cooking water for cooking the cabbage * Rinse the cabbage after boiling with cool water to make it easier to handle  * Double the rice and the parsley * Saute the onions before adding * Substitute 6 cloves of fresh garlic for garlic salt, and saute the garlic with the onions * Add 2 tbs. of Hungarian paprika to the meat mixture   * Substitute marinara sauce for the tomato soup * Substitute brown sugar for white sugar * Cook the bacon and crumble before adding * Rinse the sauerkraut and squeeze out any excess liquid before adding  That's my two cents. Enjoy!

My grandmother was Slovak and made stuffed cabbage often when I was a child.  When she passed away, I thought the recipe lost forever, until I discovered my mother could duplicate it with ease-must come from years of practice at Grandmother's side.  However, since my mother didn't write most of her best recipes down, when she died I again thought the recipe lost forever.  This recipe is the closest thing to my grandmother's, and it brings back wonderful memories just making it. And Jason can't get enough of it.  Thanks for a really great recipe!

Wow...this was very good, especially considering the comedy of errors that occurred the first time I made it.  I make a few modifications based on advice from other reviews:  I half the recipe, and it fits perfectly in a 9x13 baking dish.  I use ground turkey instead of pork.  I steam the cabbage in my steamer instead of boiling it (didn't have a pot big enough.)  I use a whole cabbage on a half recipe - perhaps I roll them smaller than others do.  I use pasta sauce in place of the soup (because somehow between the store and my house, the can of tomato soup escaped the first time I made this, and it was great with tomato sauce.)  I use white rice instead of brown, and always increase the amount of rice because the first version I made was a little meatier/heavier than I wanted.  I don't add any water at all, and couldn't imagine needing more.  There is plenty of liquid and the rolls are always very tender.  Labor-intensive but very, very worth it!!  It's great leftover too - heats up well in the microwave.  

Boyfriend just commented - "I will eat that stuffed cabbage until I bust."

I gave this recipe a try because of all the positive reviews.  It was excellent!  Like my grandmother's stuffed cabbage, but even better!  I substituted extra ground beef for the pork and used white rice instead of brown because that's what I had on hand, but it was still delicious.

I love stuffed cabbage when I've had it at weddings etc.;that is why I tried this recipe.  I have to say it was a lot of work for a so-so result.  I wished I had followed suggestions and comments. I will try again, but, I will add more tomato sauce (not soup), more seasoning (ie: fresh cracked pepper,some ground cayenne,(maybe some fennel seed)to the meat mixture. Will not use the diced tomatoes or tomato soup but instead use tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes and no water.  To save this dinner from no one eating, I drained all the liquid (there was about 2 1/2 CUPS) into a large pot; sliced up some red potatoes, baby carrots and polish sausages. I boiled in the broth until potatoes and meat was done. After draining the liquid off cabbage rolls, I poured a can of tomato sauce over them and baked another 30 minutes until bubbly; was much better. We all don't like the same things, for sure, but I do appreciate the recipe so I have the basics to make my own. Thank you .

This was right up my alley! It did take a bit of work, but that's the fun part, right? I didn't use any water at all, because the biggest complaint was that the sauce was watery. I also added dried basil and oregano to the meat mixture before rolling, as well as extra garlic powder. I thought I had chosen a "medium" head of cabbage, however I only had about 20 leaves. I simply used the excess meat mixture to make meatballs to serve with the sauce. I highly reccommend this recipe with my alterations... between two of us, about half the dish was eaten in one night.

Wow!!!I have to tell you these are the best cabbage rolls I have ever had.  I've had 6 people ask me for the recipe!!  I did make a couple of slight changes--didn't have ground pork so I used a very milk pork sausage; I also used the water that I cooked the cabbage in to cover the rolls, rather than adding water to fill.

This is simply the best stuffed cabbage I have ever had. I made this taking a big risk because I have 4 young kids and I know they're not huge fans of cabbage but I myself love it and wanted to try making this recipe myself. Anyways it was a huge hit they gobbled it down. I found this recipe to be fairly simple. Instead of boiling a full head of cabbage all together I seperated each leaf carefully and put in boiling water and they were done fast. I also fried the bacon up first and then sauted onions and garlic in the bacon fat and then drained before adding to the meat mix, I did also add a little worcestershire sauce for my own personal taste, and I didn't need to add the water. There was plenty of liquid before and after cooking. Also used white rice as I didn't have any brown. I was a little worried if I should cover this while baking in the oven but since it didn't mention in the directions I didn't and it cooked well. Love this dish!

THE BEST AND ONLY RECIPE YOU WILL NEED FOR A COLD DAY FIX!!!I have been making this now for over 5 years. And every time I make it their father wants to eat half the batch himself,with roots in the pa dutch. I am vietnamese and it reminds me of a stew/soup we make. only changes to the recipe, to retain bacon crispiness is to add the sugar/ soup and water first before putting the bacon on top.  Another is using the entire pack of bacon, cover lightly if it begins to burn. I use two 13x9  diposable foil pans from the dollar store, triple wrap in foil for freshness and in a month reheat for a full day's worth of working in about an hour in the oven from frozen state on low. warning put leftovers away quickly or else it will be picked at until there's only a half serving that you'll feel guilty for wrapping so you'll stuff yourself some more instead of the cabbage.

Excellent authentic taste.  I used 4 TBS of bacon grease in place of actual bacon.  I'll probably cut down on the amount of liquid next time.  I also used basmati rice since it was in the house and the flavor was amazing.  Very good recipe.

(Golabki) My family have been making stuffed cabbage for many years.  We wash the sauerkraut before adding to layers and also we cook the bacon with diced onions slightly before adding to the layers/a little bacon grease doesn't harm anyone. Instead of tomato soup we use crush tomatoes for the recipe.  Great/ Dee from NJ

I prepared this recipe and have some observations. First, I like to saute the onions in bacon fat before mixing them into the meat.   Second, to make forming the rolls easier, I slice off the thickest part of the cabbage leaf stem.  Third, the cooking time should be 2 to 2.5 hours at 350 degrees with the last half hour uncovered inorder to reduce the liquid.

This recipe is really very good. My husband loved them, so did my neighbors, and so did I. I changed very little. The only thing I changed was the amount of water I used to fill, I kept & used the liquid from the diced tomatoes so I only used 1 cup of water to fill, (and i used the water I cooked the cabbage in) and quite frankly next time, I'll leave it out completely, you dont really need it - especially if you like a thicker sauce. I also used a little extra brown rice. I cooked them for 2 hours. 

However there were 2 things I was confused about... 1. should you cook the bacon first? I didnt. 2. should you cover before cooking? i did. 

In any case, thanks Kelly for a great recipe. It's a no brainer, & it isnt THAT time consuming. My husbands Mom is Slovak & makes the best cabbage rolls I've ever had, these are a very close second. I'll be making them again, this ones a keeper. Thanks again. =)

I'll be honest, I've never had stuffed cabbage before.  So this was the first time making it AND eating it.  My husband LOVED it.  He used to eat boiled cabbage as a kid in Australia and the cooked cabbage brought back memories.  He had never heard of cabbage stuffed with meat, though.  I guess I was expecting more tomato sauce - - it was kind of watery with all the extra water to bring the liquids up to the cabbage rolls.  Next time I might reduce that a bit or use a can of tomato sauce instead.  Also, the bacon on top got a bit burnt so I'll probably add that under the sauerkraut (which I really thought added some needed flavor to the rolls).  Thanks, Kelly!

Wow! We totally enjoyed this recipe, Kelly! The addition of the sauerkraut and bacon really tickled the tastebuds. I cut back on the amount of water because we like a thicker "sauce" over our cabbage rolls. Thanks!

This came out great.  The saurkraut is a good idea.  I left out the bacon and used ground turkey instead of pork and didn't miss them.  The only down side was that it takes a long time, but then again... what stuffed cabbage recipe doesn't?

This is an outstandingly flavorful dish.  I did not find that it took a long time to make although I am an experienced cook and I suppose I just took the time factor in stride!  I made it with all organic ingredients from Whole Foods Market including bacon with no nitrates or sulfites as well as organic sauerkraut!  I used an organic tomato soup ('Imagine' brand in the box) instead of a condensed soup and just added a splash of water!  I used florida crystals and sea salt!  It was OUTSTANDING!  Make sure to top it with a little dollop of sour cream and sprinkle it with some sweet paprika!  I have visited that part of the world where this dish comes from and it is absolutely the right taste!  
BRAVO TO YOU KELLY!

Like others have said the prep time is a bit off, but that doesn't mean that these aren't simply worth the extra time. Absolutely delicious and comfort food at it's finest. To the meat mixture, I did add about 1 tsp of dill weed and 1 tsp of allspice (of all things), but it really enhanced an already wonderful recipe to a new level. Everything else was exactly as written and such a treat for my friend and her family. This makes quite a bit and found that it all fit beautifully in my covered turkey roaster. I did use the cover for the first 1/2 hour of cook time then removed it so that the watery sauce might evaporate some. Took nearly 2 hours to cook but well worth the wait. Great Fall meal.

I made some changes because I didn't have some items in my pantry/refrigerater.  I skipped the canned tomatoes and just used the soup mixed with a little lemon juice, brown sugar, water and a dash of worcestershire sauce.   Skipped the sour kraut and bacon... I liked the pork/beef mix in these.  Oh and I didn't pre-cook the rice since it bakes long enough to cook it in the oven (will soak up a bit more moisture that way).  Very good!  :)

Fantastic recipe! Be aware - this makes a lot of stuffed cabbage! My only comment - no need to use so much water. I only used 2 cups and it was pretty watery when done. I'll probably use 1 cup next time. I also used a large can of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup and Italian style diced tomatoes (this is what we had, otherwise I would have followed the recipe) and it was fantastic! Big hit in the house. I should have taken a picture - it was beautiful! The bacon was PERFECT. We used a nice smoked bacon with thick slices, gave everything a wonderful flavor. High recommend this recipe!

This was my first time making cabbage rolls and I sure picked a winning recipe!  I pretty much went by the recipe except I added a little more rice and seasonings to the meat mixture, and a little less sauerkraut.  I halved the recipe and it makes a bunch even halving it!  I had a medium head of cabbage and I still needed a few more leaves because I didn't get to use all the filling.  I would think the full recipe would for sure need 2 heads of cabbage.  I quickly learned that you only need to boil the cabbage until the leaves are just pliable.  If you cook them for more than a couple minutes, they will break while trying to roll up.  I also learned while rolling them, that its best to have the stem end facing you and to roll from that end first, rolling up to the leafier ends to make them hold up better.  Never making cabbage rolls before I did not know all this, but quickly found out!  I did add the water in the recipe and also cooked an extra hour than stated because it was very soupy with the water.  It still came out soupy, so I just served it in soup bowls with a large spoon and extra sauce with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.  It was actually very good "soup style" because the sauce really moistened the meat up inside.  It was straight up comfort food!  I will next time omit the water to get a more thicker sauce and see which we like better.  Thanks for this great recipe!  It takes some time but its well worth it! UPDATE: I have made this recipe several times now and

I must say that this is the best stuffed cabbage recipe I have ever tasted.  I have tried this recipe twice with superb results. The first time I used ground turkey and ground pork, instead of beef, to save calories. It came out perfect. I cooked the cabbage rolls in a slow cooker.

The second time I made the recipe I used beef and pork and cooked it in a conventional oven. 
I admit I got lazy and did NOT individually wrap the cabbage rolls. Instead I layered it like I would lasagna - a layer of cabbage, then meat mixture, more cabbage, then sauerkraut and bacon, then tomato soup/sauce. I also experimented and added mild chunky salsa in place of the can of diced tomatoes to jazz it up a bit. But honestly, without any tweaks, this recipe works perfectly as it is written. 

Both times the stuffed cabbage came out perfect! It is my favorite recipe and kudos and giant kisses go out to the person who submitted this recipe.

This is THE BEST stuffed cabbage recipe ever.  Being from Pittsburgh I was elected to make 50 rolls for a gathering, since I said I knew how to make them.  They were gone in no time.  Many were disappointed when we ran out!  You can't beat this one.  (I did use white rice)

This is a GREAT recipe. My ex-mother-inlaw used to make them this way. I never really had the recipe though. As an FYI to anyone who thinks this is too much work, you can make whats called Lazy Piggies by adding 2 eggs to meat mixture and roll into large porcupine balls, then lay some raw cabbage leafs on bottom of roaster, then porcupine balls then the rest of the cut up cabbage and place on top of meatballs.  Next add the sauerkraut, sugar and bacon. Pour the sauce on top, cover and bake 2-3 hrs or until cabbage is tender.  To fix a watery sauce, I just add more soup.  This is great when you don't have a lot of time to roll the piggies. Thanks for the recipe Kelly.

My husband was looking for an authentic recipe for the stuffed cabbage he remembered eating as a child, and this is it! He made it in a Dutch oven and it was cooked perfectly - the cabbage was soft, the meat wasn't overdone, and the rolls didn't fall apart. My 80-year-old mother-in-law said it tastes just like her mother's used to.

This is a 10!  Leave out the water, be generous with the bacon, make sure each roll has at least a half a slice over the top, and serve it with sour cream for sure!  It makes a lot so freezing half for another time would be a great idea.

I made these delicious halupkis last night for dinner, and my husband, (he's Slovak/Lithuanian)
loved them! The only change I made was- I used tomato sauce instead of soup for a more intense tomato flavor! Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing!

This was my first try at stuffed cabbage . It turned out fantastic and a delicious meal. My hubby even enjoyed it and he is not a big fan of cabbage. Will definitely make again. A great winter dish even for company. Followed the recipe exactly and was well satisfied with results.

This is a fantastic recipe! A little time consuming - but worth it.  Prepare and cook ahead of time and then just reheat it.  Make sure you have a big pot and a deep dish pan (boiled over while baking). I made this at the request of a friend whose favorite meal is stuffed cabbage, and he said this is better than the family recipe he has eaten for years. I had never eaten nor made stuffed cabbage before - but I will definitely be making it again!  Very flavorful!

Followed this recipe exactly and it was a hit!  Even with all that tomato, it doesn't taste excessively tomato-y and you can taste the yummy,lightly flavored cabbage.  The sauerkraut's vinegar flavor cooks out and the bacon mingles to give it that nice flavor.  
I used the 32oz jar of Claussen's sauerkraut - after you squeeze out 10 oz of the pickled-juice, you end up with just the right about of kraut to layer with.

Made these as written with the exception of using kielbasa instead of bacon. Really great - love the broth, delicious with some fresh bread and butter! I will be making these again and again, just without the bacon or kielbasa - doesn't need it.

I omitted the bacon for a healthier version, and I also used half beef and half turkey instead of pork.  I didn't have to add that much water to it, I think I maybe added one cup.

This was just okay for us. It is worth a try though. If I were to do it again, I would boil the cabbage leaves after separating them from the head of cabbage. Lifting the whole head of cabbage from the boiling water was difficult.

An excellent recipe with authentic taste.  It leaves the house smelling wonderful as it cooks.  I do reduce the amount of water that is called for, however.   When I make these I usually freeze half since there are only two of us.  They still taste great, even after being frozen.

This my 'go to' recipe for stuffed cabbage. I recently made a double batch the day before I planned to serve it. I refrigerated it uncooked overnight and the flavors really melded into a super tasty dish. The only thing I tinkered with was substituting cut up kielbasa for the bacon. This recipe is just outstanding.

I decided to make stuffed cabbage and out of curiosity looked up how other people make it.  I discovered this recipe and it is similar to the recipe that I make handed down from my slovak/"ruthenian" grandmother (Helen).  The only difference is, the diced tomatos are substitued by tomato sauce, and bacon with kielbasa. I've' tried bacon and diced tomatos,(out of necessity) but prefer my grandmother's way. I like to cook this in oven at 350 and cover for the first hour then uncover the last 1/2 hour.  So, I guess I'm stickin with my original recipe.

Excellent, adaptable recipe. Made 1/2 batch in 4 qt. slow-cooker - 8 hours on low. Layered 6 rolls and 1/2 the ingredients twice. Important - to maximize the flavor throughout, make sure all of the rolls are covered with liquid. Will try some thin-sliced kielbasa on each layer next time - not sure about the bacon's contribution.

I love this recipe! My grandmother was German and she always used sauerkraut in hers. I use white rice like she did and tomato juice and it's great I don't use the parsley or the bacon but the little bit of sugar cuts the acid from the tomato. I use a small knife to shave down the cabbage rib and thin it so it's easy to roll without losing any of the leaf as it seems harder to find big cabbage heads lately. I'm going to try freezing the head one of these days to see if it works as good as boiling. Cabbage rolls can be done in the crock pot or simmered in a big pot on the stove (with enough liquid) as I do as everyone likes the juice. I just layer the sauerkraut leftover cut up cabbage and rolls in a big stock pot and depending on if you double or triple the recipe 1 or 2 big cans of tomato juice. I just simmer it for hours till tender as I usually have to increase the recipe by three or four once I make the mistake of mentioning I'm making it. I hate to see people beg...lol

This was the best stuffed cabbage I've ever had.  Even better than my grandmother's!  I've never had it with sauerkraut and bacon before but from now on this is how I'm going to make it.  There are only two of us but I made the whole recipe anyhow and froze the extras for another day.  I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing; I didn't use all three cups of water.  I used about half that amout instead.  I haven't had these for a couple of years and the smell they made when cooking brought back so many memories.  Thank you so much for this great recipe.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL; the only change I would make is to cook the bacon first; when cooked with the cabbage it got a bit mushy and didn't taste very good; when precooked the bacon added a nice smoky flavor; another option would be to slice some kielbasa and place that in the roaster while cooking instead of the bacon.

I made this stuffed cabbage and it was very good. I'd like to respond to the people that said it was time consuming. Have you ever made stuffed cabbage before? IT IS TIME CONSUMING! I thought this recipe was fine. I've been making stuffed cabbabe since I was 15 years old, I'm 40 now. Obviously some of these people that rate recipes have not been cooking for so long.

I ate 6 of these they were so good!  I baked for 2 hours to soften the cabbage further and cook the  canned tomatoes more.  The saurkraut topping was excellent.  

I made a few minor changes to the recipe: I didn't add any waters and didn't strain the chopped tomatoes.  It's not needed.  Substituted seasoning salt and fresh garlic along with  garlic powder, and black pepper instead of the garlic salt.  Also I used  equal portions of ground round, pork, and veal.  Absolutely the best!  I could eat the whole casserole myself. Husband liked it to. Kids liked the filling but won't eat cabbage.

Made this yesterday and it was absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I will do differently next time is use less water and additional tomato soup.  I like a thicker sauce.  I will also cook the cabbage a little longer befor stuffing them.  Some of the cabbage rolls were a little too tough.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This was just as wonderful as the reviews I read before I made it!! I too used all beef instead of pork and white rice because that is what I had on hand. It is worth the work and I WILL DEFINITELY make again.  There were no leftovers.

This is the best stuffed cabbage I have ever made. I put the whole pound of bacon on top, just for some added vitamins; and I precooked the sauerkraut in a can of cola and a stick of butter, just to keep it low cal. I skipped the sugar. It was great

I had never made anything like this before but the picture caught my eye and I've been looking for some new recipes.  The usual rotation can get old.
     I love cabbage so this was right up my alley.  It turns out that my 18 month old loves it too because she couldn't get enough of it. (I was pleasantly surprised that she likes sauerkraut!) It turns out that this is a good thing because it looks like we're going to be eating leftovers for a few days.  This recipe makes a lot of food!
     I made it exactly like the recipe said.  Unfortunately this won't be making it into the rotation because: 
A. It is not difficult but it is time consuming and with 2 little ones at home I try to make simple things.
B. Hubby is not as adventurous as me and our daughter and so he wasn't a fan of this dish. (I didn't take any stars away on account of my husband's bad taste in food.) ;P
     All that being said, I'm glad I tried it and sometimes it is worth it to spend the extra time to make something special!

The sauerkraut made this really good. I am perplexed by the 3 cups of water. I understand the top of the cabbage rolls shouldn't burn but the sauce was very watery. I'll decrease to 1 1/2 cups next time then loosely cover with foil.

Amazing!  Really skeptical about the tomato soup, but with all the amazing ingredients,  it doesn't taste like it.  Definitely cook the cabbage beforehand.  Cut the stems out and you should have an upside V shape.  Put the stuffing at the very top, fold left and right side over each other toward the middle to cover the stuffing, then roll the stuffing toward you.  Makes for a prettier roll.  I got a nack for this near the end, oh well!  Next time I will perfect it.  And there will be a next...

A huge hit, made a bit much for our family of four, but the left-overs disappeared quickly.  Most certainly a do-over.   I did however add spices to the meat (as we like our meat well seasoned)  I used a touch of all-spice and some cayanne pepper.  We still would prefer a bit more kick with the meat, so I may add a couple hot peppers to the meat mixture next time.  :)

Delicious stuff! I've made cabbage rolls before, so I was hesitant to try this recipe (remembering how much time the ones previous took). I plowed through it! To make things easier, I make the stuffing the night before. DAY 1: cook rice, sautee onions in a bit of veg oil, throw both into a large bowl. Then I just pile the stuffing ingredients into the large bowl. Mix everything by hand. Cover in plastic and leave in the fridge til the next day. DAY 2: core the head of cabbage (like hulling the tops off strawberries), put the head of cabbage (intact) into boiling water. Gently pull off leaves, trim as much stem off the leaves with a paring knife. Stuff leaves - roll stem part in first. Then I follow the rest of the recipe. Easy as pie :) Hubby loved it so much!

WOW!!!!!!  This is definitely the BEST stuffed cabbage I have every made.  I served this over rice.  Made this exactly as written with 2 slight changes, used Venison in place of the beef and crushed tomatoes in place of diced.  You will need more than 1 medium cabbage.  I had to run to the store to get another head of cabbage, didn't mind because it was worth it.  This is now the ONLY stuffed cabbage recipe I will ever use.

This recipe is excellent for a week night dinner.  I never really cared for the Stuffed cabbage I have had in the past.  I took a chance on this because of all the positive feedback.   I made two batches with the intention of freezing one, but everyone asked to have it again for dinner the next evening.

Good stuff very similar to what my mom always made growing up. I used beef and lamb mixture instead of pork since I'm not a fan of pork. I also made it with sliced pieces of beef polska kielbasa on top instead of bacon  since that is how my family has always made it. I prefer fresh garlic so I used that and added a splash of Worcestershire  sauce and an egg.  You got to add the sauerkraut it really adds to the dish and makes this a better stuffed cabbage that others I've tried.

I followed this recipe exactly (except that to make it Gluten Free I couldn't use the condensed tomato soup so I exchanged it for GF tomato soup and decreased the amount of water we added) and it is fantastic as written!  I had never added sauerkraut or bacon to my stuffed cabbage before and I'm so glad that I did because it made the sauce absolutely delicious.  Thank you for the recipe!

Yummyyyyy if you love cabbage. Use all the kraut it calls for - it tastes amazing even if you aren't much of a kraut fan and I used pre cooked bacon so it was nice and crisp. Really good combo of flavors for a great meal.

I had never cooked stuffed cabbage myself before, but had eaten my mom's while growing up.  Some instruction on how and how long to cook the cabbage would have been helpful.  Lacking any, I followed my mom's suggestion to pull off the leaves as they became tender while boiling.  I don't that was enough.    I baked as instructed at 350 for 1.5 hours.  There was a LOT of liquid in the pan, and the cabbage really wasn't cooked through at all.  I read another's suggestion to cook for 2 - 2.5 hours instead, and am hoping that overnight and after reheating tomorrow, that the cabbage becomes more tender, and that more of the liquid is absored.

No one in my family liked this. I usually like stuffed cabbage but I did not like the flavor of the sauerkraut and the bacon. I will not make this again.

This is a great recipe with a few adjustments.  I used 2 cans of tom.soup and one 16 oz can of tom. sauce and no water.  I omitted the sauerkraut but added 1 tablespoon of cidar vinegar to balance out the 1 tablespoon of sugar. I used both beef and pork because I think it gives it more flavor and I added onion powder and hungarian paprika.  These were very tasty although the cabbage could have been a bit more cooked, so next time I will increase the time to 1 hr 40 min.  I also covered the dish for the first hour then uncovered it for the last 1/2 hour. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a good recipe that froze well.  The taste is very European so it may be an acquired taste.  I made this for a family from Romania and they loved it...could not stop eating it.  I will keep the recipe in my recipe box, but probably won't be making it for my family again in the near future.

I never made stuffed cabbage before, this recipe was my first try and it was easy and delicious. I omitted the sugar and the bacon-and didn't miss them. My husband said they tasted like his grandmother's stuffed cabbage! Excellent!

I have given this recipe a 5 already, they are cooking in my crockpots and I haven't tasted them yet but already know they are going to be delicious.  I have been making a similar recipe for years, but this one sounded so good I just had to give it a try.  I will be back later to tell everyone if it meets my expectations.  I used the water I boiled the cabbage in for the sauce mixture and am cooking them in my crockpots.  Other than that I made no changes to the recipe.  OMG it smells delicious.  Be back later.   I threw away my old recipe which was good, but this one surpassed all expectations.  I will always make them this way from now on.

We love these! I made them on top of the stove in a large dutch oven, skipping the bacon, but placing some thinly sliced onion on top of the sauerkraut. I also add a tsp of ground cloves, some brown sugar, worcheshire sauce, garlic powder and a little pepper to the sauce mixture. I mix raw rice into the meat mixture, with a little finely minced onion and bell pepper, some garlic powder and grill seasoning.  They do freeze wonderfully, and the leftovers are great!

Wow!  Awesome recipe!  I made half of the recipe and it still was enough for my husband and me to have it for dinner one night and then to have left overs twice!  It makes a lot, so be warned!  But, the good news is, that this recipe is just delicious.  I will definitely make it again and again!

These stuffed cabbages are wonderful!  Such a practical meal, too- they freeze well individually!  I like to add a little more pepper and hot sauce to the tomatoes, but overall this is a terrific recipe!

For those who don't want to bother with taking time to make this dish, I suggest buying Stouffer's. But, it won't be nearly as good!

Except for the addition of the bacon, these are exactly like the ones my mother made. I also add a teaspoon of caraway seed to the sauerkraut and a bit of brown sugar, just to soften it. Otherwise, identical.

Serve with homemade (yes, they DO take time) mashed potatoes and crusty rye bread on the side, and what a wonderful dinner this is!

Delicious.  I followed others advice and cut back on the water to one cup.  Next time I make it I will either add a can of tomato sauce or another can of tomato soup because the sauce looked watery (it had a lot of flavor though). I used ground pork and turkey, and I didn't miss the beef at all.

What a huge disappointment. Too many ingredients and too much prep time to be worth the outcome. I'll go back to making stuffed cabbage the old-fashioned way my grandmother used to -- without a recipe.

This is the first time I've ever made stuffed cabbage.  I used Mahatma Basmati rice instead of brown rice.  I didn't rinse the sauerkraut but used the juice in addition to the other liquids.  This was excellent.  The fact that this recipe isn't pure tomato soup, and the bacon make this recipe stand out among the others.  Excellent!!

For a better flavor profile and note to diabetics... you won't  need to add any white sugar. Used ground turkey mixed with precooked white rice. Seasoned with salt, pepper and Chinese five spice powder (Try this and you'll use it every time for  Galumpkis.)

The amount of water was more than you could imagine. All the flavor is washed away in the CRAZY amt. of WATER. Im actually buying more tomato paste and sauce and soup to try and fix the sauce issue. The other issue is the BLAND MEAT! Now, i cant fix that since its inside the roll, so idk what else to do.

The recipe wasn't bad , but not as good as everyone else seemed to think. I thought the sauce was WAY too watery, and I didn't even use the full 3 cups. Also, next time I won't rinse the sauerkraut. The sauce could use some acidity. I used white rice, but next time will add more. I will also fry the bacon next time, and pour the fat from the pan on top of the cabbages, again I will use more bacon. I will make these again, but with a few adjustments.

FREEZE your cabbage head before hand, then thaw on the counter the night before.  No burnt fingers!!  But the cellulose (?) will break down from freezing and you'll have nice soft leaves to work with.  Couldn't find our gramma's recipe so looking here to make sure I'm on the right track.

For the most part the recipe was very good, but adding the tomato soup, diced tomatoes and their juice, and water made the juices very thin. The taste was very good. The next day I drained the liquids from the pan and replaced them with a jar of prepared pasta sauce and reheated it in the oven. Turned out much better the sauce was thick and gave the whole dish a better flavor, in my opinion. I will make again but will take the extra time to prepare my own pasta sauce instead of the tomato soup and water mixture.

Excellent recipe!  I have made stuffed cabbage for years from a recipe from my Polish mother-in-law.  The bacon is a wonderful addition.  She taught me to make them with homemade mashed potatoes which is a wonderful way to enjoy all of the rich sauce that this makes!

Title of your recipe caught my eye since my father's family is Slovak (not Czech. he would say).  My recipe came with white rice which I changed to brown which we prefer. Mostly identical to yours otherwise except my prep time is about double.
Will look for other recipes of yours.

Hey Kelly, you got the recipe down to the tee! This is what our cabbage tastes like, it really is. I have shown the recipe to my granny (we are from Slovakia, living in Slovakia) and she asked me if I was pinching her cookbook lately :)) This really is the taste of home to me, thank you. Jana

This is the best stuffed cabbage I have tasted.  The tomato soup adds nice flavor and the water makes it nicely juicy.  I chopped the bacon and fried it with onion and added to the meat mixture rather than following the recipe.  I also used sweet italian sausage because I did not have pork.  This is really good.  The sour krout adds good flavor too.

I made this recipe for my Irish/Polish Honey's birthday.  He LOVED it!  He suggested swapping the can of tomatoes for another can of tomato soup.  I wound up using about 2 cups of water, and it was plenty moist.  The sauerkraut gives off a fair amount of juice, so the extra water was not necessary.  I served this with a side of white rice.

Taste just like the sarma from Northern Minnesota! I think the sarmas could be cooked longer, because the cabbage didn't seem to be as soft as it should be! But all in all! Excellent!

OMG!!! it took everything out of me to convince my neighbors (good friends) to help prepare this meal. Let me just say, two hours later, there was nothing left!! We followed the recipe, however I decided to use one (1) jar of Prego Traditional spagetti sauce versus what the recipe calls for. I mixed half the jar with one (1) freshly squeezed lemon, a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce in with the meat mixture, and brown sugar. I saved the remaning jar of sauce with more lemon and Worcestershire sauce to pore over the top of the bacon before entering the oven. to date, this is the best recipe I have made from Allrecipes. Enjoy!

A keeper!  Used ground turkey instead of ground pork only because the grocery store was out of ground pork. Eliminated sugar and bacon and followed the rest of the recipe as directed. Excellent and will make it again!

I'm making this today. My family has made these for years, we call them HALUPKI.  My mom doesn't add bacon, but I"m looking forward to seeing how that changes it.  Also, we just use crushed tomatoes instead of soup and white rice.  Everyone I've ever made them for loves them!  Yes, this makes a LOT, but I alway freeze 1/2 for later.  YUMMMMY on a cold day!

Good recipe! I had a similar recipe and couldn't find it. This one is almost exact,except you line your pan with 1/2 sauerkraut and place the "rolls" on top, and place remaining "kraut" on top of rolls, then cover with tomato sauce/soup and add bacon on top. I make this dish for family reunions,work parties etc, and am always asked for the recipe! And my family makes sure I am bringing this for gatherings!

These are simply the best! I'm pregnant and got a craving for cabbage rolls, which I hadn't had since I was a young child. Because I like to use organic products where I can, I made a few changes to the recipe. My store doesn't carry an organic condensed tomato soup, or even a plain organic tomato soup, so I used an organic cream of tomato and reduced the water. I didn't have garlic salt, so I used fresh garlic and salt to taste. For more flavor, I also increased the amount of parsley. I ran out of cabbage leaves had extra meat mixture, so I crumbled it over top, before adding the other toppings. These were a huge hit with our family and also our last minute dinner guests. This is a new favorite recipe that I plan to make again and again.

my mom and boyfriend are both huge fans of stuffed cabbage and sauerkraut, and they both loved this recipe, i did cook the bacon first and sauteed the onions in the bacon fat, as suggested by another reviewer. i halfed the recipe and cooked it in the slow cooker, i used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup, and drained the tomatos and did not add the extra water. when cooking they looked a little dry so i splashed a little water on them. i also added some cayenne to the meat mixture. i halfed the recipe and used the whole cabbage and still had meat leftover, i would get 2 cabbages next time, for half. but it was yummy!. teh sauerkrat added more of a zing!!

It is so good to see a good stuffed cabbage recipe. I add a few changes from what I recall from my youth. The rolls should be softer; so I will add more rice and as some suggested 1 teaspoon of fennel seed. My preference is to have well cooked cabbage; it could have been I did not add enough liquid. My mistake; I would use more tomato soup and tomato puree. Thanks for a fabulous start to wonderful recipe.  You can't beat the smell from the kitchen when cooking or reheating them

When I made this, but did not add the pork (because I did not have the pork on hand) and it was absolutly delicious. My husband had never had Stuffed Cabbage (Pigs in the Blanket) with sauerkraut before, but he loved this recipe. You have converted him to my way of cooking, thanks.

My husband and I really like this recipe. I hadn't made cabbage rolls in a long time and decided to try a new recipe. I'll be making this one again. My Dad dropped by when I was making them and had to have a taste.  He was sorry he couldn't stay for dinner.

My husband and I loved this recipe - though he wasn't crazy about the sauerkraut. I substituted ground turkey for the pork to cut some of the fat out, too.  Very yummy, and the recipe made enough for leftovers.

This is how I make stuffed cabbage.   Recipe was my Slovak mother-in-laws.  Everybody likes it.  I core my cabbage, fill it with water through the core and cook it core side up in the microwave.  Then separate and fill.

Firstly - I knew I needed to make a smaller batch as there is just my husband and I.  I started with very lean 1 lb gr. beef, added about 2/3's + cup brown rice, 1/4 cup tomato soup, didn't measure the salt or garlic, and added worchestershire and smoked paprika, every else the same. . Salted my  cabbage water,  pulled off each leaf (cored) and trimmed spine and ended up with 12 nice leaves.  Lined the bottom of a 9x12 pan but it wasn't necessary and made it really too full in the end.  Used a large crushed tomatoes and the remaining 1 can of tomato soup, added my brown sugar  (1 tbsp) to the sauce directly.  Used a 17.5 oz can drained sauerkraut, sprinkled evenly over stop of rolls, poured tomato sauce  mix over and ended up removing some as it was too much (made sure it was down between rolls) - then laid about  7 center cut bacon strips across .  I ended up with 10 rolls  with 2 extra on the one side.  I made sure to cover slightly the bacon with sauce.  I did not add any water - (there wasn't room and it didn't want it runny as cabbage makes liquid as it cooks)  I baked a little over 1- 1/2 hours, recovering the bacon with sauce once towards the end.  WOW it was fantastic!   I think each roll should have a least a piece of bacon cause that makes it sooo special.  I had no floating grease and the sauce was beautifully thick .  I have finally found my keeper recipe for cabbage rolls!

Great recipe.  Made it for a potluck and stuck to the recipe with the exception of the bacon.  Will definitely make again.

We skipped the bacon and sugar and added slices of cooked kielbasa layered with sauerkraut. Rinsed sauerkraut well. We made on top of stove in large stock pot.

I made it with the marjoram as suggested.  It was very good, however I rinsed my kraut as suggested and found that it was too mild,  next time I will drain it and not rinse it.

Of course, I had to make some changes...   I added turmeric and cayenne.  Couldn't find the brown rice so went white.  I had to thaw 12 large slices of bacon so I used it ALL.  Gave the dish a wonderful smoky sauce.  I put sriracha sauce on my plate but my wife passed.  I did the recommended sour cream and it was decadent.  I will add more rice next time.  the layer of cabbage on the bottom was awesome to add to the servings.  Depending on whether a person eats 2 or 3 for a meal I could have served 10 people easily.  Froze half of it and still have food all week and gave some away.  Good bang for the $$$.  Thanks.  I'm gonna explore the Asian and Indian recipes too!

I made stuffed cabbages several times in the past, but was never happy with how they came out.  Seemed like there were either rather bland, or they kind of tasted like some Italian dish because I added too much garlic or something trying to add more taste.

I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used dry parsley because it's all I had around.  This recipe is a big time winner!  I absolutely loved them.  Not sure exactly what it was, but the combination of the cabbage, sugar, sauerkraut, and tomato sauce was excellent.  I'm thrilled that I finally can make stuffed cabbages and really be proud of them.  Thanks so much!!

I'm a little A.D.D. about cooking and am a multi-tasker, soooooo while preheating the oven, I cooked the hamburg, rice, and cabbage.  I was pressed for time and didn't have enough time to roll, so I poured some pureed tomatoes in the bottom, lined the bottom with the cabbage leaves, then added the "filling".  Topped it all off with the rinsed sauerkraut and covered with foil.  Was done in 1.25 hours.  My family could not get enough of this dish.

I shred a potato and mix it in with the ground beef to stretch the mixture a bit and give it a sturdier base. also i put about twice as much pepper and salt than this recipe no other seasoning needed really its great just as is.

I've never made stuffed cabbage before and actually only ever ate it once.  This was so easy to make and it turned out amazing!! It sure did make a lot but that's ok I baked it in two dishes and will freeze one.  I wish I could post pics to show how good it looked because the pic on here doesn't even look the way the recipe calls for.

This recipe was delicious. I used apple juice instead of the water to add more flavor to the broth. I also added some grated pecorino and a few splashes of Frank's hot sauce to the meat because I like the tang and a little heat. Next time I will add potatoes in the broth to thicken the sauce and add as a side. All in all, a great recipe that I will use again and again. Thank you for sharing!  :)

This recipe makes my honey very happy. His "mmmm!" engine starts purring as soon as he sees the cabbage on the counter, and keeps going till he eats the last bite.  This dish is quite a bit of work, but it makes such a quantity that it takes care of four meals.

fantastic! I did use base pasta sauce instead of tomato soup. But holy cow we ate this almost completely gone and there were only 5 of us. One of them being a 2 year old who gobdled up a complete roll saying num num num the whole time. And my mother who does not like cooked cabbage and she ate 3 rolls. I served them over white rice. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  I used ground turkey as a substitute for the beef/pork for a healthier alternative and it turned out great.  The soup mixed in with the ground turkey keeps it very moist and adds great flavor.

Just like Granny used to make!  I loved this recipe.  I used sliced kielbasi instead of bacon because that's the way my Grandma always did it.  I'm not very good at rolling the cabbage though.  I had a ton of leftover meat and ended up making meatballs out of it and made extra sauce to cover and bake them in the oven.  My boys love the meat more than the cabbage anyway, so it worked out perfect for us!

Awesome recipe-- I hadn't ever had halupki made with sauerkraut, and it was good.  Thanks for the recipe 
Also- I just used tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes,   didnt have ground pork,  nor parsley.   It came out good, and was even better the next day.
I also wished I had more cabbage leaves, as I ran out.

How does one make the best better?  Try using ground veal instead of beef -- or in addition to beef.  My kids won't eat the cabbage or the sauerkraut, so I make them "porcupine patties" with the meat mixture on the bottom layer.  I can imagine what they tell their classmates at school about what I serve...

I followed recipe exactly.  Flavor was good but seems it needs something more... maybe as some suggested more seasonings..to make this "over the top".  Ran short on cabbage.

I was striving to mimic my Grandma's and while this recipe was good; it didn't match hers.  I omitted the sauerkraut and bacon and added an extra can of soup as suggested by other reviewers.  I will make it again after polling other family members for advice.

Very good recipe!  We made it veggie-style substituting all meats with veggie crumbles from Bocca and veggie meatballs from VeggieBurger. It turned out wonderfully!  I am not a huge fan of the Kraut in this recipe . . . I would have cut in in half.  As it is, we didn't use all it called for.  I also may have increased the sugar by double, just to take the edge off the Kraut.  But these are all personal tweaks.

This recipe was ok.  Husband loved them but kids and I didn't care much for them.  Too much work for the end result.  Recipe made a huge amount.  Had way too many left over.  Threw some leftovers away.  Sorry.

I have been looking for a good stuffed cabbage recipe and finally have found it!  It is a bit of work - but stuffed cabbage always is!  I did reduce the water as others suggested.  My family is crazy about this recipe.  Thanks!

Was ok.  i didn't care for the flavoring much, but my german grandmother would have loved it.  i cooked it in a slow cooker for 3 1/2 hrs as recommended, and added no water, used fresh tomatos.  just not my type of dish.

Good but too much water.  Used sliced kielbasa instead of bacon.  Don't like the taste of toatoe soup in dishes like this, so I use more diced tomatoes and their juice. Did NOT mix cabbage, meat or sauerkraut together but instead layered them in a baking dish, covered it with foil, and baked in the oven.

This was an easy recipe to make because the meat filling does not need to be cooked before stuffing the cabbage leaves--it bakes in the oven.  Also, I didn't have chopped tomatoes on hand, I subbed spaghetti sauce as many of the spices on the recipe are in spaghetti sauce.  It was good, my family enjoyed it even though we are not big sauerkraut fans.

We have used this recipe for years passed down from my grandmother. I only bake them when making a large amount in a roaster or in the oven. For a one or two meal batch I'll use a preasure cooker to cut the time down to 35 to 45 minutes depending on the size of the cabbage rolls and only adding no more than a cup of water. I've also been known to use minute rice and or sausage if it's available.

Very good recipe.  My husband's late grandmother used to make him a meal similar to this and I was really happy I could make him a meal he often spoke about.  My husband liked it very much and I'll definitely make this meal again; though, next time I'll start preparing it a little sooner than 7 pm.  This one is a keeper.

I have very high expectations for this recipe.  I was very disappointed.  It was good but not as good as I expected.  I prefer a thicker sauce but I followed the recipe as noted and the sauce was very watery.  My mom's recipe is much more flavorful.  I'll stick to my own family recipe.

My husband said this was the best recipe I have ever made in our 35 years of marriage. 
I took 2 suggestions from another review. 1) drained and rinsed the sauerkraut so it wasn't so bitter. 2) I added  1 teaspoon of regular paprika along with a very small pinch of smoked paprika  to the meat mixture - because that's what I had on hand. I didn't have hungarian paprika but I'm sure it would have tasted great to use instead. It is labor intensive but worth it if you have the time.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  My mom and I always made cabbage rolls in the summer to freeze for winter.  There wasn't a recipe for me to follow when I had my own home.  This is as close as it gets.  These are wonderful.

The recipe is very much like my Grandmother’s with only a few changes. I did take notice that the stuffed cabbage leaves cooked more throughly on the bottom layers as opposed to the top. We cooked it for 2 hours not 2.45 hours because the meat was cooked at 2 hours and I didn’t want it to get dried out. Not sure what to do the next time about cooking the leaves on the top. I would make this again and my family loved it.

This was a big hit with everyone! And that's saying a lot since we all grew up as cabbage roll fans, preferring the hand-me-down family recipes above all others. This one had just the right balance of 'kraut and tomato. Did as others recommended and added only 1 cup of water instead of 3, which resulted in plenty of sauce. I also used 2lbs ground beef and 1lb sausage, and still had enough leaves from 1 cabbage to roll it all up.

This makes a very large portion. We fed 5 adults on one night. And we had it as leftovers on 2 nights for 3 adults. So, plan accordingly if making this recipe. I researched how to get my cabbage leaves. I found a process that was effective and easy. Maureen Abood’s blog on how to blanch cabbage for rolls is a must read. Also, I didn’t like how the bacon turned out between the layers. Next time I’ll chop it and cook it, remove the bits, and cook the onion and garlic, I didn’t use garlic salt, in the bacon grease. I’ll add this mixture to the meat stuffing. If you don’t have brown rice, I think white will work just as well. I think that is personal preference. We make our own tomato soup. So we did a paste/soup mixture for the meat and poured the rest over the top. We don’t purchase much processed foods. It worked well. Didn’t have to add water, there were plenty of juices. We had to use our large turkey roaster to get all the rolls in a single layer. Otherwise, this dish was a huge hit with everyone. leftovers were very yummy and reheated well. The extra juices kept everything moist and tasting great.

I make my own version of the same recipe however rather than baking, try using the pressure cooker instead, been doing it for years and makes a world of a difference. Cooking time in the cooker is 45 min.

Good recipe.  Prefer to add more sauce and more rice. Also  substituted chopped garlic over garlic salt to limit the amount of salt given the salt in tomato soup.

This is the best stuffed cabbage recipe! I was looking for a recipe to use up some beautiful flat-head cabbage I got from my local farm and gave this a try. Yes, It is a bit time consuming but makes a big batch so is good to freeze.  I followed most of the recommendations in SusannaB's review (https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/14597/slovak-stuffed-cabbage/reviews/2926504/) and received rave reviews.

I used white rice. That's what Mom used. I used tomato juice but might try tomato soup the next time.  It took longer than a half hour to make. I cooked half in a slow cooker for 8 hours on low the other half at 350 in a convection oven for 2 1/2 hours. The slow cooker batch was better. I took this to a Slovak family reunion and there were no refusals to eat them .

I loved it so much that I'm making it again. We are poor so we omit the bacon. I had to buy 2 cabbages to get enough leaves to use all of the meat, so fyi buy super big or multiple cabbages. I add a little cumin with the salt and pepper (read it in another recipe) but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

Absolutely fabulous! The sauce was very watery, but nothing that pouring off into a pan and thickening with a cornstarch slurry can't resolve in 30 seconds. I'm making this again and will layer it like a lasagna instead of trying to make the rolls. They're a royal pain, time consuming, and almost never work for me anyway. So from now on, I'm calling this Slovak Cabbage Unrolls.

Good recipe. Simple for a first timer like me. I did use all ground pork, and Majoram in place of parsley. It took a little time to prep, but worth it, and the kraut was a nice addition. I tend to use recipes as starting points and this one has a lot of potential to be adjusted in different ways.

This recipe was so delicious!! I'm going in the hospital soon for surgery and am getting foods put up in my freezer for when I come home, the recovery period of the surgery. I'm making even more of these, they were that good!

Great recipe.  Made it just like recipe called for, & yes rinsed the sauerkraut like suggested. 2 tbs of sugar little too much.  Will definitely make this again.  Just like the Hungarian neighbors made it.

I really liked the addition of the sauerkraut and bacon over the top.  I also added bacon to the meat mixture.  I only added a 14.5 oz can of tomatoes to the soup and omitted the water and sugar which still gave it enough liquid to cook in without being too watery.

Its so easy to roll the cabbage leaves if you freeze them overnight after blanching (like tissue paper). I prefer pork only vs pork and beef, and also add some chopped precooked bacon to my pork, into the rice.  A tspn or Tbsp of paprika gives a wonderful taste to the rice too.

my family loved this recipe....my husband doesn't like sauerkraut but he still enjoyed it. We used a whole package of bacon, 5 slices didnt seem like it would be enough. I also added brown sugar on top of the bacon and then added the white sugar after. 

Flavorful and delicious. Will make again!

This was my first time trying this recipe and it came out delicious! I will likely do it without the sauerkraut next time. I'm not a huge fan. But overall, this was excellent.

This was fantastic! I cut the recipe in 1/2 & used only ground turkey; instead of water, I added a basic spaghetti sauce to the tomato soup. Everyone raved! Definitely, a deep pan is needed for no boil-overs, tho. Also, I sprinkled sugar on the cabbage at the bottom of the pan instead of over the top.

This is a great recipe. I have made it twice now and made a couple changes as other reviewers suggested. DO NOT add the water, it's too much liquid and not needed. I only had beef, no pork, added more rice, and added sliced mushrooms on top along with the bacon being chopped first and browned, then added at the end of cooking. I want to make this recipe for my mom, since I grew up on cabbage rolls (one of my favorites).

Fabulous recipe and a real treat for something different than what I normally make.  I did, however, substitute ground turkey for the ground pork to make it more healthy.

These are so good! I had some leftover pork loin roast that I wanted to use up so I ground it in my food processor and then mixed it with a pound of ground turkey instead of the ground beef.  I love to use my slow cooker so I layered them in their and cooked them on high for about 3 1/2 hours.  I only added a little bit of water (enough to rinse the soup can) and really didn't need to add any at all.  Definately worth the 35 minute prep time!!

This was an excellent recipe! I should have added a little less water, but other than that *excellent*!!!
