Truly amazing!!  Substitute dry vermouth for sake, jarred chopped chives just fine.  Don't add the last 1/2 cup of butter...way to oily and not necessary.  Instead, double the ingredients in step 3 (I would add 1 and 1/2 cups of shitakes) and then brown.  Remove once brown to avoid seperating.  I also only cooked the meat in the oven for six minutes then transferred to warm plate, wrapped the filets in tin foil and covered with a towel to let cook the rest of the way while I finished sauce.  Ended up an absolute perfect buttery medium rare!  I can't wait for the next dinner party to serve this!!!

I have nothing to say about this recipe except: DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut down on the butter a bit in the first step and used some garlic olive oil instead (the butter later in the recipe made up for this, no problem). I personally would recommend using Mirin and sake and not subbing it for something else-- that sweet, subtle flavor can't be found anywhere else. But if you're looking for sake and mirin, don't go to the liquor store. Mirin is a COOKING wine, and thus would be found in your local grocery store (or Asian food store) in the cooking wine and/or asian food section. Sake should be with all other wines and beers. Worth the extra hunt in the grocery store because this recipe is so yummy we ate every last bite!

I didn't have mirin or sake.  I opted for red wine as a substitue for mirin and omitted the sake and it was still great and full of flavor.  Will make again.

Absolutely DELICICOUS. Followed the recipe exactly (except I put the filets in an ovenproof dish rather than putting the skillet in the oven). I served it with Carrot Rice (recipe on this site) and I sauteed some peapods with toasted sesame seeds and seasoned them with salt and pepper. Gorgeous presentation and I truly can't tell you how yummy it was. The butter sauce is out of this world. Easy meal that would be perfect for a dinner party.

Delicious!!!  I had to use Sherry instead of Sake and I marinated the steaks in a little soya sauce before cooking. Other than that I followed the recipe correctly. The sauce is really, really good. Can't wait to make this again.

The sauce is excellent, but the steaks are only seasoned with salt and pepper. It would have been nice to have the flavour infused into the meat instead of just in the sauce.

I made this for Valentine's day.  My husband was never more impressed.  The flavor was outstanding, and it was very simple to prepare.  I could not find mirin, but used a sweet red  wine recommended by my local wine  store in place of it. Will make this again and again!

I made this yesterday for my annual home Christmas party for several friends.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit. Today I sliced the leftover filets and heated them in the leftover sauce and it was even better the second day. This is my new favorite.

This recipe didn`t work for my family. I followed the recipe exactly, except of using white wine instead of mirin, but I didn`t get the sauce at all. The butter evaporated and there was only shiitake mushrooms in the oil. The meat with this sauce didn`t have a flavor at all. I have tried some Ryan`s recipes and all of them were fabulous, but this... Sorry.

This was absolutely delicious.  Made it for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he begged me to make it again for him today.  Couldn't find mirin anywhere so used Fuki Plum wine and can't imagine it being any better with the mirin.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good! I recommend using organic butter if possible because it browns better.

Good stuff! I cut my steaks from a whole tenderloin so they were not exactly filet, but close. I followed the recipe exactly - and had some trouble with the cooking time/temperature when browning the butter sauce. I think next time I would do my steaks last after the sauce was done because I was afraid they would get too done waiting in the oven - or too cold waiting outside of it. The butter took much longer to brown than stated, and my mushrooms, garlic, and ginger were a little overdone by the time it came together. Great flavor, I'll just need to play with the logistics a bit next time. Thanks!

I was very pleased with how this recipe turned out.  The flavor was wonderful.  The only change I made is that I used Cremini mushrooms instead of Shiitake.  I couldn't find mirin in the wine section of my neighborhood grocery store.  I eventually found it in the Asian products section. The bottle doesn't use the word wine, the product, from Kikkoman, is called "Aji-Mirin" and is defined as Sweet Cooking Rice Seasoning on the label.  I hope this helps.

When following the recipe exactly there was waaaay too much butter which resulted in a greasy, tasteless sauce.  Wish I had read the reviews before giving this one a try...

I think this would be very good, but I used Costco tenderloins, which are basically mini roasts, and I didn't cook them long enough...had dinner for 10 and everyone loved it; I was the only one disappointed.  Definately double or triple step 3.  Will definately try again.

The best steak I have ever cooked. LOVED it! I used plum wine and reduced the butter by just a little. Served over filet mignon that we cooked rare on the grill. Highly reccomended!!

I got to admit that I was skeptical of this recipe...I've never cooked Tenderloin in the oven being a die hard grill guy. It turned out fantastic!! We enjoyed the sauce, but it almost was too buttery for my taste. All in all very good and would recommend. PS Don't tell my grill buddies about using the oven. ^_^

I had 2 small portions of beef tenderloin and used this recipe.  It was rich and outstanding.  My garlic chives are a little tough now so I used my regular chives.  Wonderful!!  This rates among my all time favorites!

I'm giving this three stars because I'm sure I must have messed it up somehow.  For me, it was LOTS of melted butter with some greasy, fried shitake mushrooms with a sort of gingery flavor.  I don't get the sauce part.  I followed the instructions to a tee.  I'm a pretty experienced cook, but I must have missed something.  Sorry.

Very Good! Followed exactly!! Mirim is rice cooking wine and you get it in the grocery store. Also used a good saki and drank the rest with dinner.I did add the juices of the meat in the sauce. Next time I will put the meat on the grill and maybe add fresh chopped scallians instead of chives. I also served with carrot rice and sweet and spicy green beans from this site. Made a great meal!!

Everything was really good. The mirin gave the sauce a sweet taste which my husband and I liked very much.  I never have broiled or pan-fried a steak to the same taste as a grill so I opted to do that and drizzle with sauce after. I also wrapped each tenderloin in apple wood smoked bacon for an extra flavor and I highly recommend a good quality bacon for this. I do prefer the taste of portabella mushrooms over shiitake but it was worth a shot. Overall very nice.

Absolutely amazing. I couldn't find mirin at the liquor store so I used plum wine instead. I also used twice the amount of shiitake mushrooms. Next time I may use less butter at the end, but overall amazing.

So delicious! I'm always nervous when trying a new recipe but I've made this twice now for dinner guests and it came out amazing both times. I don't think there's a way to mess this one up! I followed the recipe exactly...couldn't think of a think I'd change. Try it!

This was absolutely delicious. Everything came out perfect. Except I bought a combination of Cremini, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms by mistake but they turned out tasting really good. And my sauce didn't turn out such a brownish color like described, so I added just a drop or two of A1. I will definitely make this recipe over and over.

My husband is usually in charge of the steaks and I cook the sides. But this was my deal. So when he kept being a back seat chef and telling me that 3 mins on both sides was too long and not to put it in the oven, I yelled at him and he stormed off. Lol! With that said, I cooked the recipe as written, except subbed mirin for red wine and did 4 mins in the oven. It came out PERFECTLY med rare and my husband loved it so much that he promised never to be a back seat chef again and this should be my signature steak dish. Absolutely delish!

Moseyt's review and steak suggestions were very helpful. Biggest mistake I made was not believing 400 degrees was correct.   Only reason for 4 stars is that I used frozen steak and should have adjusted cook time and followed temp for oven.  Will definitely try again.

Excellent flavor on the mushrooms which really added to the steak! If shiitake texture is not something you like but the flavor is, take out he stems and finely chop them  separately from the thinly sliced caps. This recipe goes very well with pan roasted carrots in miso butter (see Epicurious).

OMG!  The steak was amazing!!! You could cut it like butter.  A good cut of meat is so important.  The first time I made this I forgot the marin and I did seem to like it better.  We have continued to cook steaks the same way even without the butter sauce.  In fact my husband has decided we don't need to replace the grill because the iron skillet works so well.

Delicious! My new favorite way to have a steak.  Substituted sherry for the sake and didn't use garlic chive because I didn't have any.  Otherwise, this recipe was spot on and absolutely wonderful!

Incredible.  What an awesome  way to enjoy the steak.  Did this with roasted new potato and spicey green beans.  Red wine.  Life is good.

I made this to thank my husband for taking such good care of me after surgery.  To this day he raves about how good it was.  In fact he has asked me to make it again after ten days in Key West where we had the best food.  He says it's better than anything we had in any restaurant.
