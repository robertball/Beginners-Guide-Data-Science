I made a few adjustments to this recipe. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of mushrooms, left out the milk, cream of chicken soup,and ketchup. I seasoned it with salt, pepper and a dash of seasoned salt. I cooked up some instant seasoned mashed potatoes, placed the potatoes in the bottom of a baking dish, topped the potatoes with the hamburger mixture and placed the biscuits on top and sprinkled the biscuits with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I baked it at 350 until the biscuits were golden brown. It was very tasty after these adjustments. Somehow the cream of chicken soup and ketchup didn't sound like a good combo.

We love this recipe! However, I use 1/4 cup of salsa instead of ketchup, brown the hamburger with some red pepper and use cream of mushroom soup.

Ok, so I got the basic concept from this recipe.  I added dry onion soup mix as the hamburger was browning, and replaced the ketchup with Western Dressing.  Instead of topping with biscuits, as we don't like "canned" ones, I prepared some instant mashed potatoes and topped the filling with that.  I sprinkled the top with shredded MJ and cheddar cheese and french fried onions.  I think this was a winner!  Totally easy, and super adjustable!

I thought the taste of the dish was very good but I would make some changes.  First of all, I would used cream of mushroom soup instead cream of chicken.  And maybe I would add 1 1/2 cans or 2 cans of the cream of mushroom soup.  Secondly, I would add a can of green beans just to give it more substance. But overall the flavor was very good.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was edible but I didn't save the leftovers.  Too much ketchup taste and it was just an odd mix of ingredients.  It didn't look impressive either. Surprisingly the biscuits cooked well but everything else was so-so.

Super quick for a hot supper....my family loved this.  I added some onion, fresh mushrooms and a tiny bit of garlic.  Would recommend.

Very good.  A kid pleaser.  I did make a mashed potato bottom since I felt that it would be too much bread otherwise.  It was awesome.  I will make this many times.

Excellent and Easy!  I did add garlic and onion to the ground beef when browning and omitted the catsup as suggested by other reviewers.  The taste was outstanding. Definately a kid pleaser!

I THOUGHT THIS WAS REALLY GOOD! MY KIDS NEVER ASK FOR SECONDS OF ANYTHING, THEY'VE ASKED ME TO MAKE THIS AGAIN!! I PERSONALLY THOUGHT IT NEEDED A LITTLE COLOR SO I ADDED BROCCOLI, I PLAN TO TRY MIXED VEGETABLES TOO. I ALSO TRIED IT WITH BISQUICK ON TOP INSTEAD OF CANNED BISCUITS. IT IS SUCH A VERSATILE RECIPE, A NICE PLACE TO START, YOU CAN DO SO MANY THINGS WITH IT. THANKS!!!

Very good.  The biscuits taste great on top.  It kinda reminds me of a fancier hamburger helper.

I kind of understand why this recipe got so many negative reviews here (more than most recipes I've seen, I think). The recipe is quick and easy, and has that comfort-food feel, but it's just a little weird, I think. I made this exactly as written, using 85% lean ground beef, "98% fat free" soup, and the biscuits were 10 buttermilk ones. Also, it took about 17 minutes to get the biscuits to be a bit "golden brown". This made two fairly big dinners for me, and I did gobble it down, but I wouldn't say it's especially tasty. I should note that the advice to soften the cream-cheese and mix it well should really be emphasized. I thought I did a decent job of it, and even mixed the dish some more while baking (just before putting the biscuits on). Even after all that, the finished dish still had little bits of cream cheese visible. I'm not a huge cream-cheese fan, and I wish it'd been fully melted and dispersed throughout the dish. I've only bought refrigerated biscuits a couple of times in my life, and one of the best things about making this was that I discovered a very nice brand of them. This was a slightly interesting recipe, but I don't think I'll be making it again.

made this for family dinner last night.  basically doubled for 5 adults and 3 kids.  Still only 1 cream cheese though, C of Mush instead of chicken, 1 fresh red bell, green bell, onion, mushrooms, garlic, corn salsa instead of ketchup...  consistency was good...  basically there were 2 biscuits left out of the 16 left so I think it was a hit.

Overall this was a pretty good recipe but.... I knew this would never work in a 9x13 so I used an 11x7 which worked okay. My husband had thirds just to get some 'meal' out of it other than biscuits. We wound up throwing out 2 of his. This would be better if 2 lbs of hamburg were used instead of 1. Overall, he liked it but it was so thin. Will try again with more hamburg.

My husband loved this! I think it's okay--easy to make and quick to serve. I think it's more of a "starter" of sorts.  It's got a great start, but needs to be tweaked! My husband liked it as is, but I would add chopped water chestnuts, onion, celery, mushrooms or more. It reminds me of the hamburger milk gravy we used to have as kids . . .I pressed the bisquits into a muffin pan and make cups filled the the casserole. Fun to eat and a smaller mess to clean . . .

This was a very fast and simple recipe. I did add and change it just a bit. I used one can of cream of chicken soup & one can of cream of mushroom. I added 1/2 a chopped up onion to the beef. I also used two tbs of minced garlic in the beef. After I drained the fat I added salt & pepper for more taste. I left out the ketchup completly. (that part did not appeal to me) I also sliced up black olives and added it to the mix. My husband ate two full plates and my kids loved it after getting past the I don't like it(without trying it phaze)

This was probably the worst recipe I have ever tried.  I should've been clued in to the ketchup, but thought maybe it would turn out ok since I use ketchup in meatloaf.  No one in my family liked it and I definitely won't use it again.

I thought the flavor itself was incredible.  A tad runny, but the actual taste made up for it.  One thing I would do, use a smaller casserole dish!  That way the portions will be larger per biscuit and the biscuits will cover the casserole.  We had empty spaces at the end of 9 x 13 pan...  Awkward.

I changed this quite a bit, but the concept is great! I sliced 3 potatoes thinly, precooked them for a bit in the microwave and spread them on the bottom of a greased pan. I seasoned my hamburger with red basil, garlic, and lemon pepper and added the onions to it. I layered that on top of the potatoes. Then I put a layer of frozen mixed veggies. I subbed worchestershire sauce and sherry for the ketchup and I added sour cream instead of milk. Then I added the soup and cream cheese, along with more garlic, red basil and lemon pepper. I spread that over the other layers, added a thin layer of cheese, and then the biscuits. It was very good!! Thank you LuckySilver for giving me this recipe to play with!! My family loved it!

I changed it up a little.  I put onion, and green pepper in with the hamburger.  Drained, and then added the cream cheese, garlic powder, a can of olives cut up, 1/2-1 cup salsa and a big can of cream of mushroom soup.  Put it in the 9x13 pan.  Baked 15 minutes.  I then put the big buscuits on top with a little parmesan cheese sprinkled on top...baked an extra 20 minutes.  A family of 6 devoured it, and there is still a huge helping for lunch.  Wonderful..thanks for the idea.

Very good concept! I added a few things though. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the chicken. I also added 6oz of sour cream to the mixture and used about 6oz of salsa instead of ketchup. I added a can of corn to the final mixture to give it a little more texture too. I seasoned my meat with garlic salt , pepper & onion flakes. Great quick dish and very easy to modify to everyone's different tastes. I think this would also be great with mashed potatoes on top.

This will look really wonky when you make it but I promise it's delicious, especially if you use chili sauce in place of the ketchup. It gives it a really good tang. I would definitely recommend baking the biscuits on the side, however, I had several problems with the biscuits coming out raw on the bottom when I put them on the casserole. We've also tried this with ground turkey (and sometimes add green beans) and it's still great and I usually double the recipe so we have leftovers.

I thought the flavor was good, but the biscuits were soggy on the bottom.  Maybe I didn't cook it right, not sure.  I didn't find that very appealing.

I would really say it was a 3.5.  But, since they site does not offer that I will give it a four.  I did not follow the directions exactly, though.  I added garlic and onions to the hamburger and added a can of cream of mushroom along with the cream of chicken. I thought I would just omit the ketchup because all the reviews talked about how gross it was. After taking a taste, though I thought something was missing, it was the ketchup.  It gave it a little kick.  Defiantly cut the cream cheese in half though.  I placed this over noodles instead of baking it as a casserole.  My family thought it was way better than hamburger helper.  It was really quick and easy.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is really just a variation on a hamburger gravy that you serve over top of the baked biscuits.  It's not a gourmet recipe and probably not something to serve to company...  That being said, we love this for quick weeknight dinners. I can't believe I haven't rated this yet, we make this about once a month or so!  We like how quick/easy/cheap it is.

My boyfriend and I had made this dish last night, and we aboustly LOVE it! It reminds me of a stroganoff dish. It's quick and easy, very tasty. The ingredients are quite odd and I honestly didnt think it would taste so good. I would recommend this dish.

I subbed in the cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken and kept the ketchup. I also added diced onion and garlic to the meat mixture and a can of mushrooms to the mix. I think the cream cheese may have been a little strong and might use half the amount next time.

Make this your own!!! This is so versitle. I loved reading all your suggestions. I took some and added my own!  I browned the hamburger with onions, garlic and red peppers. then I added corn, kidney beans, cream of mushroom soup and salsa. I made instant mashed potatoes(it wasn't enough, I should have made more) and put them on the bottom. I poured the meat mixture over the mashed potatoes and made bisquick biscuits to put on top. It is an interesting mix of flavors. The BF wasn't sure what he thought of it, and since he has decided that he likes it. I have passed the test! I truely feel like I created my own recipe! I was so proud of myself. It truely IS delish!!! YUMMY!

I made this tonight for dinner, overall it was good. I did make changes to it as well. I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken, as that didn't sound good to me, and left out the ketchup, and most of the milk. I also put in a can of mushrooms and a can of corn and browned the beef with onions and seasoning salt. I put the mixture on top of mashed potatoes, and that was a great addition. The biscuts were not done in 15 mins, so next time I will cook them longer. I think next time I make it will will try bbq sauce and see what that does to it. I think it is a good basic recipe to add to as you like

DELICIOUS!! My husband and son loved this take on traditional biscuits and gravy. The casserole part (ie. the sauce) was rich and thick and creamy, real comfort food on a chilly night. My son asked me to make it again the next night and add frozen peas, so I added 1/2 cup of frozen peas and it turned out just as yummy. Highly recommend you try this recipe, it's a keeper and so easy when you are pressed for time!!

This went over great at my house tonight! I did use the mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken (that's all I had in the pantry!) and I did add some chopped onion to the hamburger when I browned it off. My husband and son said they liked the taste of it, and it was so easy to prepare.

This was very good although I added chopped onion and garlic to the hamburger. Should have more biscuits as there was way to much of the hamburger mixture for only 10 regular biscuitsAdded a tossed salad for a complete meal.

I made several changes to this because I couldn't wrap my head around ketchup and soup.  I used a can of cream of chicken & mushroom, then used the hot sauce I had on hand instead of ketchup.  I also added 2 Tbl. of sour cream.  My family loved it!  My son which is the pickiest of eaters had 2 helpings.  
I think I will double the soup mixture with more sour cream and less cream cheese and reserve part of the soup mixture, spoon the meat mixture into tortillas and pour the remainder of the soup mixture on top and make enchiladas.  I'll top it with some cheese and have a version of sour cream enchiladas.  That is something I can get my picky kid to eat!
Lots of things you can add to this, corn, mixed veggies.  Great starter recipe!

This was a great quick fix. The only thing i did different was added a pack of onion soup mix ( I do this with almost everything that calls for hamburger )reduce the ketchup to 2 tablespoons as other reviewers had recomended. but i am not a big fan of ketchup anyway. But as for the ketchup flavor it is different strokes for different folks. I would try adding a little at a time and taste to suit you. I used jumbo biscuits because that is all i had. Next time i will use regular size as i found that i was getting more biscuit than the filling and it was drowning the flavor( which was great )out. To make the cream cheese mix smooth microwave for 30 seconds, stir, add the milk and microwave for 30 more seconds and mix until smooth then add to other ingredients.

Unfortunately, combining cream cheese and ground beef isn't too good.  Adding ketchup is worse.  It's a shame as I like all of the elements, but together, it was pretty awful. I don't think there's a way to save this by tweaking it, either.  Take note of the poor reviews.  They are right on the money.

I've made a recipe very similar but (sorry) better than this for more than 20 years....Add a finely diced small onion to the browning hamburger and use cream of mushroom instead of chicken.  No ketchup.  After putting the hamburger mixture in a baking dish, I sprinkle with diced green olives--maybe a 1/4 cup.  They add an unexpected but nice flavor.  I layer with homemade biscuits--seriously, they only take a couple minutes to make, and are so much better than canned.  Sprinkle lightly with paprika, then bake till biscuits are golden and done.

As a farmer's wife/school teacher/mother of three boys, I am always looking for quick, easy recipes that use up the hamburger that seems to be ever present in my freezer! This spin on stroganoff was pretty good and quick to make since I keep browned hamburger in my fridge.  I omitted the ketchup, added garlic salt and some pepper.  Put it in a baking dish that was smaller than a 9 x 13 because I wanted a thicker casserole.  I quartered the biscuits, tossed them in melted butter (more calories--ugh!) and then "sprinkled" the pieces on top of the meat mixture.  Baked it as directed.  It's a keeper-- not "to - die - for" good, but worth repeating because it's quick, easy, and filling.

I made this recipe once before, and asked my family to give me their opinions that night.  No one said much about it, just that it needed more flavor, like garlic and maybe some pepper, and the biscuits were too soggy on the bottom.  This time, I sauteed onions and grated garlic with the ground beef, used c.o. mushroom soup, a bit of Lea & Perrins and milk.  I put the biscuits into the oven for about six minutes to get the bottoms crispier, then arranged them on top of the beef, added shredded sharp cheddar cheese over the top and baked them -- it also took 10 minutes longer to get the biscuits browned in the oven, than what the recipe states.  I drastically cut down on the cream cheese, because my husband HATES it (he also says he hates mushrooms, but never seems to notice the c.o. mushroom soup in the recipes I use it for!)  *sigh*  Instead of 8 ounces, I mixed in about 2 ounces instead.  My family really liked this version, and I will now put this into my regular meal rotation.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, LUCKYSILVER!

I followed some of the suggestions and added cream of mushroom instead of chicken soup and omitted ketcup...yuck! Follow the recipe as stated and you may have better results. I thought this had way too much cream cheese..this is the first recipe on this site that I really did not care for. Again, maybe if I made it as stated it would have been better, but I fear the cream cheese would have still been too over powering.

It's okay.  I added garlic and onion when I browned the hamburger and added green beans and corn to cream cheese mixture.  I made homemade biscuits to top this. Its great for kids.

The first time I made this dish, I was so glad it was just for me and hubby. THIS time, I did as recomended, added salsa and cr. of mushroom soup PLUS... after spraying bottom of the dish with Crisco or whatever you have, I lined it with frozen hash browns. Cook an extra (app.) 8 min.. Will DEFINITELY make it this way again!

My husband LOVED this - with modifications.
Used cooked sliced potatoes for bottom of casserole (for this reason I think the casserole tasted like a loaded baked potato).
Used about 1/2 c of salsa instead of ketchup.
Used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.
Mixed my own biscuits with Bisquick and dropped them onto the casserole then covered cooked biscuits with melted butter.
My husband's unsolicited response: "Definitely make this again, please!"

After reading reviews, I also changed this a bit.  I used instant mashed potatoes ("loaded baked potato" flavor) for the bottom layer of the baking dish.  Then I browned ground beef and added lipton onion soup mix.  I used  cream of mushroom soup and omited the ketchup, as others suggested, but we did not have any cream cheese.  The meat mixture was spread ontop of the mashed potato layer, and then buscuit dough was placed on top of the meat mixture.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, but the biscuits were still undercooked on the bottom.  All in all, my husband and son liked it, but it was just okay for me.

Terrible.  Easy to put together and ingredients looked ok, but finished dish was NOT a good combination of flavors.  Save you hamburger for something else.

I DID CHANGE IT JUST A BIT AND IT STILL TURNED OUT WONDERFUL!!!!
It was like a pie of sorts.......
I didn't have the bisquits BUT I DID HAVE 2 pie crusts in the freezer, so I used that. I first buttered the pan, then put the first pie crust down, and baked it for about 30 minutes, then took it out, put in the hamburger mixture and then put the other pie crust on top and then cooked it for 30 minutes more and still it wasn't quite done enough so I put the oven on Broil for 10 minutes, it came out WONDERFUL........I actually hate anything made with hamburger meat but I really liked this for some reason, maybe because meat was cooked in oven, it was so tender. The crust was so delicious, I dare anyone to make this dish in this way and say it's not good...........WE LOVED IT, !!!!!!!!!

I added 2 cups of cooked spiral noodles as the sauce seemed way to thick on its own. I also added 1 tsp crushed basil and 2 tsp worchestershire sauce to add flavour. Husband and son said they liked the noodle addition. Would use mushroom soup next time. Was definately suitable for a novice cook!

I didn't like this much.  It had a funny aftertaste, possibly due to the ketchup.  But since my husband loved this, I will split the difference and give it 3 stars.  I used to love hamburger gravy when I was a kid, but this definitely wasn't it.

This was a good recipe.  Very easy to prepare, and done in no time.  My husband and I both had seconds, but as my husband put it, this is a once a month meal, not a once a week keeper.  I followed the directions exactly, with no changes. 

My only complaints are that there was not enough meat mixture to biscuits, so when I make this recipe next time, I'll double the meat mixture and leave the biscuits to one can.  Also, the recipe says it yields 4 servings, and I think that's a bit of a stretch.  This was just enough for my husband and I (except for the six biscuits left over).

Very easy and quick. I needed to add more meat to give it more consistancy about 2lbs. Instead of biscuits I used refrigerated crescent rolls laid flat over meat mixture.  It was okay, next time I will use mushroom soup with pkg of Lipton onion soup.

I've made this recipe a couple times. My husband likes this a lot more than I do (he's not picky at all, whereas I am very), but it's not too bad. It's cheap and easy to make with ingredients that is usually already on hand which is a major plus for me (a busy stay-at-home mom), cooking for a family of 3. The biscuits are a bit much, so I halve them instead of leaving them whole. The hamburger mixture is creamy due to the cream cheese and has the whole sweet and sour thing going on which we like (cream cheese/ketchup). 
It's not the best recipe in my collection, but an ok, quick standby that will fill the tummy.

I added 1/2 package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix to the hamburger meat.  I then added one can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, a can of chili hot beans and some shredded cheddar cheese to the mix, this added a lot of flavour.  My husband and I really liked it.  Thanks!!!

The overall dish was okay but my husband, myself, and our son thought it had too much cream cheese. We recommend doing half of the amount that is called for and maybe add some regular shredded cheese of your choice on top when you go to bake it.

My family makes a casserole very similar to this, but we call it cream cheese casserole. The only difference is we omit the soup. I tried it with the soup to see if it could make my childhood favorite any better and was rather unimpressed. It does nothing to improve the flavor and makes it a bit runny. We also use double the cream cheese and 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef. Another tip that I've learned from years of making this, in the middle of baking, after the tops of the biscuits are golden brown, flip the biscuits. The bottoms of the biscuits are almost always completely raw and will burn on top if they are not flipped. The end result is not pretty, but it's better than burned or raw dough!

Delicious! I’m definitely making this again! The only change I might make is to use more beef, but that’s only because the hubs was hoping for more. Otherwise, SO GOOD!

Love this...granted, not the prettiest casserole but a true comfort food. My mom made this casserole back n the 70's, a favorite then and has remained one today. Like other reviewers I change it up a bit by adding onions, garlic and mushrooms to the browning hamburger but it's not necessary.
Thank you for sharing this tasty recipe ;)

I didn’t give this recipe a fair chance since I had no refrigerator biscuits ... but made the filling almost exactly as written, apart from adding a small can of drained mushrooms.  And it was quite tasty!  Thanks.

This was pretty tasty & inexpensive, which is a plus. I added a small chopped onion when I was browning the ground beef. I'd make this again.

I was a little fearful this recipe would not turn out too well. After reading some of the other reviews, it seemed a lot of cooks changed the recipe. I stuck to the original recipe and hoped for the best. This turned out to be a great family pleaser. Even my wife, who usually cooks our meals was impressed. The kids all wanted seconds! My wife suggested doubling the ingredients to help balance the biscuit to yummy goodness ratio.

I made some changes and it turned out well. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken, Rotel instead of ketchup, instant mashed potatoes on the bottom with the mixture poured over and baked for 15 minutes. I skipped the biscuits and just melted shredded cheddar cheese on top.

This recipe has a been a go to favorite for my family for the better part of 20 years. I have read a lot of negative reviews and was really surprised. Over the years of preparing this recipe this is what I do. First, I put the cream cheese  in a sauce pan and heat it up . After that I add the cream of mushroom soup, ketchup and the milk. I bring it to a slow boil. In a seperate skillet I add fresh mushrooms, onion, garlic and then saute until  barely tender. Once this is done I place the onion mixture into the bottom of the casserole dish and then brown the burger. Once the burger is done I add ALL the ingredients into the skillet and mix throughly. I bake the mixture for 30 min. Once the mixture starts to boil in the oven I then add the biscuits, this  is how to get your biscuits to cook on the bottom side. I hope this solves some of the negative posts and benefits first time makers of this dish. The first time I made the dish I served it up and before the plates were cleaned I got up in the middle of dinner and had to make another batch.

I read the reviews before fixing this. I subbed "hot" salsa for kethchup, added peas, cream of mushroom with herbs and evaporated milk. It was great in taste!! However, I won't use biscuits next time. It took forever for their bottoms to cook in the liquid.  I'll use this over rice or something else next time.

Very easy go to recipe! Made this for dinner last night. I served it over mashed potatoes and had harvest beans as a side dish. Made a few adjustments: No cream cheese (because I didn't have any), used cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken soup, added onion and mushroom while browning the hamburger. I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to mixture. Once I got everything in the pan I topped bisquits and all with extra shredded cheddar cheese. My husband really liked it. We are going to eat the leftovers for dinner tonight.

We think this is really tasty.  My 7 year old even likes it (and it was a miracle he even tried it), and his main diet is oatmeal and peanut butter sandwiches because he refuses to eat most other things.  Nice and easy, too!

Family loved it, and it's cheap too! Only problem we had were some of the biscuits weren't done all the way through, so we cooked them by themselves, split them in half and poured the mix over them, similar to biscuits and gravy.

This recipe is okay. I did modify it quite a bit because the original sounded boring and the ketchup did not sound appealing, but my husband wanted to give it a try. The reported fat content is out of control so I added lower fat ingredients and found the flavor to be just as good. First I used ground turkey with a 93/7 fat ratio, lower fat cream cheese, lower fat biscuits and 98% fat free cream of chicken soup. I browned the turkey with onion and garlic while warming frozen mixed vegetables in a saucepan. I put the drained vegetables in the bottom of the 9x13 pan and mixed the ground turkey in the cream cheese and cream of chicken mixture. I left out the ketchup but added appx. 1 tbsp of A-1 sauce which added just a little tang to the mixture. I then put the ground turkey mixture on top of the veggies and cooked as directed adding the biscuits at the end. It turned out well and my husband and daughter really liked it. I tend to be a little more adventerous in my cooking endeavors so I still found it to be a little boring but  good homestyle food. Will make again but probably not in regular rotation

This recipe was really good.  My only complaint was that there didn't seem to be enough meat in comparison to the creaminess.  But, besides that, I followed the recipe and my only addition was onions and some cheese that I wanted to use up sprinkled over the top right before the biscuits were put on-yum!

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I left out the ketchup.  I figured individuals could always add it at the end.  I used Light Cream Cheese and Healthy Request Cream of Chicken.  I put hashbrowns on the bottom of the dish and put honey butter biscuits on top.  I think the biscuits really went well with the dish. I can't imagine using just plain buttered biscuits, I think that would have made the dish too plain tasting.

This was just okay, nothing special.  It seemed like it needed more biscuits or maybe noodles or something.  I added cheese on top of the biscuits the last 5 min. they baked.  My kids liked this.

Good but it seems to be missing something.  I liked it, but most likely because I love cream cheese!  I also changed the soup to cream of mushroom instead like other reviewers because cream of chicken just didn't seem to go with hamburger.  My 5 year old didn't like it, but my husband also gave it 3-4 stars.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.

Not quite sure why people are so down on this recipe.  It's a nice, moist casserole, and the biscuits on top are a great contrast in terms of taste and texture.  I will grant you that if you don't add a bit of additional seasoning, it's a bit bland, so I typically add some onion salt and paprika, but for my family, that's all we need.  :-)

Like everyone else I changed it up a bit!  I've learned that cream of chicken and beef just don't jive well.  Anyway, I browned the meat with onion soup mix, and used tomato soup instead. Layered that mixture ontop of mashed potatoes as others did.  Topped that with shredded cheese, we used jack since that was what I had.  Topped with the biscuits and cooked them until they were done.  I suggest lifting one on the end and checking to make sure.  It takes about 20-25 mins. for the biscuits to cook.  Kids & hubby liked it.

After reading the other reviews, I figured this was either going to be really good or really bad.  I decided to make some modifications to the recipe and it turned out surprisingly really good!  I mixed the cream cheese and half a can of cream of chicken soup with a small can of Hunts tomato sauce (garlic, basil  and oregano kind). I added milk until the sauce was the consistency I wanted. While cooking the ground beef I added in Italian seasonings, garlic and onion powder and then mixed into sauce. I poured the sauce over cooked egg noodles and topped with cheddar, mozzarella cheese and baked 30 minutes.

Um...well...it's okay. Hubby thought is was okay, 5-year old liked it a lot, and I'm somewhere in between.  I did use Cream of Mushroom soup with Roasted Garlic. I'll make again in a pinch.

This was a hit with my family, old and young both.  The only thing I did different was I left out the ketchup as some others suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

This dish is so easy and so yummy!  I can't believe how much flavor it has.  Two very picky eaters gobbled it up (including my 3 year old.)  It was very rich, so I probably wouldn't make it too often, but it is nice for a special treat.  I wouldn't change one thing about it.

this is the very best casserole i think i've ever eaten! my whole family loved it, next time i will double it thats for sure. one thing i did diff. was I used the giant butter flavored biscuits and i peeled them apart and put a layer in the bottom of my cake pan, dumped the hamb. mixture on and put the other 1/2 of biscuits on top. i baked it for 1/2hr. but the only prob. i had was, the bottom biscuits didnt get done, but the tops did. so i'll have to figure out a way to fix that prob. anyways, thanks a bunch for the recipe!!

The cream cheese made a rich flavour and it was simple enough for my husband to prepare without messing it up.  The kids all loved it and there was none left even though we doubled the recipe.

Very nice overall.  Thanks!

This recipe was fast and the ingredients was an interesting combinaion. The flavor was unqinue, my husband enjoyed it but my son, took one look at it, and said he wasnt hungry!! Overall, it was ok.
