I liked this recipe because it was very simple. However, I gave it a 3 because I agree with the first reviewer about it being bland. I added garlic, but I think the recipe could be approved on more by adding some spices.

This was pretty good. I sauteed the bell peppers with minced garlic in the butter and then added equal parts of water and couscous along with the parmesan cheese. At the table we seasoned it with salt and pepper and it went great with our spinach stuffed salmon.

My husband & I found this to be incredibly bland.  Garlic or some sort of spice would make a big difference.

This was a very nice, festive looking side dish for my New Years Eve party. The taste was pretty good, but as others commented, could use just a bit of perking up.  No complaints from any guests, though.

This recipe works great as a side dish. I used feta cheese instead of Parmesan cheese and I added raisons to give it a little more flavor.My only real problem with this type of couscous is that I find it can be a little dry.  As a result I like to serve it with a main dish that has sauce. I have had comments from some that they would have liked a dressing, perhaps a vinigrette, or something of that nature.All in all it is a great recipe and the green and red peppers definitely make it a christmas side dish.Cheers,Glen

Instead of water, I used chicken broth and also added garlic powder as others recommended.  Then, this made a pretty good side dish.

This is a good way to dress up couscous!  But I had to figure out how much 6 oz. was.  So I went with 1 Cup.  Then I used only 1 1/2 C. water.  4 Cups would have drowned it.  Also took advice of others and added garlic powder and pepper.

A quick and easy side dish. I used the boxed couscous and with the bell peppers I just added diced onion and some chopped garlic and saut√©d all to add to pot to cook. Turned out very tasty!
