GREAT WAY TO USE UP LEFTOVER TURKEY!!! Rates 5 with toppings of sour cream, jalepenos, etc.
Had to make changes, but good results with 'em ... made 'em two days in a row!  Still wanted more after that!
Used 1/2c finely chopped onion; 2 cl garlic; 2c chopped, cooked turkey; 1/2c FIREROASTED TOMATOES, undrained (sub for salsa), 1/2c reduced fat sour cream (sub for cc), 1/2t dried cilantro, no cumin.  After cooking the o & g for a few minutes, I added the rest along with a cup of cheese.  Didn't heat it.  Just rolled as was.  Used 1/2c in each.  
Made my version of Mrs Espy's enchilada sauce.  It's listed in the review, if you want it.  Put a little in the dish & poured some over the enchiladas - about a cup total.  Had to thin the remaining (to have enough) with turkey broth the next day & it was still very good.  Be sure to not leave any exposed or they'll dry.   Then half cup cheese on top.  Baked loosely foil covered 20 to 30 at 350.
Best thing of all?  BOTH KIDS (11 & 13) LIKED THEM!  That rarely happens - unless it's dessert!  :D ... Jan 2012 Doubled with a 8oz bar cream cheese.  It's better than sour cream, but sour cream is still good.  Double recipe ensures leftovers.

This recipe was fabulous! The only thing I added was half a packet of Old El Paso Taco Seasoning Mix as I cooked the chicken. The kids ate seconds!

I made some changes, but it was such a good started and I absolutely loved it.  First, I used corn tortillas, personal bias.  Easy to use if you heat in microwave with a wet paper towel for 20 seconds...no tearing, no problems.  I prepared the filling as written, except no cilantro (don't like it) and added chile powder.  Did not add cheese to the filling, but did add a about a fourth of a can of enchilada sauce along with the 1/4 cup salsa. 

Wen filling the enchilada, I put the chicken mixture, then cheese, rolled and placed in pan.  when all were in pan, poured remaining enchilada sauce rather then salsa over the enchiladas, sprinkled with cheese and onion and baked for 20 minutes.  

These were so good!  I will make them again many time.  I think the one I had left over and reheatd the next day was even better.  thank you for a super recipe.

Great! I seasoned chicken breasts with cumin, lime-infused salt, chili powder, cayenne, garlic & onion powders and grilled, which added a nice flavor to the enchiladas. Used Neufatchel cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe. My husband loved them. Thanks! :)

Easy and quick to make.  Great flavor.  If you don't have chunky salsa you can use picante sauce and a can of drained diced tomatoes.  If you dont have chopped cilantro or ground cumin, you can use a packet of taco seasoning.  The great thing about this recipe is that it makes enough to feed a hungry family with ingredients you have on hand.

This is a very good base recipe.  I found it to be a little bland & dry for our taste, but that's easy to fix :-)  I added a little taco seasoning & Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime, but next time I'll probably up those a little bit, as well as using a little more cream cheese.  The only other change I made was using taco cheese.  Even DH loved them!!

This was super easy and very good! Used reduced fat cream cheese. Served with sour cream & guacamole. The only changes we made was to add green onion and leave out the clinantro (just because I'm not a fan). Will make this again and again!

This is pretty much the recipe my mom always used when she made enchiladas -- it's fantastic!  For something a little different, try making it with corn tortillas instead of flour (cooking them in hot oil for a few seconds to get them soft before you stuff them) and topping it with canned enchilada sauce instead of salsa.  Either way, this is a great recipe!

One of our favorite recipes!!  Only small change is that I add enchilada sauce to the bottom of the casserole dish and top the enchiladas with more sauce and cheese before baking.  My entire family of 6 requests me to make this very often!!

I also used the green enchilada sauce and added a little sriracha sauce.  Great way to use leftover chicken.

This was a great recipe.  I did cut the salsa down and added Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes in place of the salsa.  We will definitely be having this quite often.  The flavor was absolutely perfect!

Good recipe for something out of one's routine. It was not as flavorful as I had anticipated even though I added the chilis. As I said, it was good.

I did not have sour cream, so I like the idea of cream cheese, which I did have.  Also used enchilada sauce in the bottom of the casserole and as a toppong with the salsa.  Delicious.

Great, really easy recipe. Could use a bit more seasoning to our taste buds but will definitely make again!
