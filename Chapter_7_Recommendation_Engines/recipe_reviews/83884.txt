This was a good recipe, though after reading the other reviews, I made a few changes.  We did not find this too salty (maybe a previous reviewer used chicken bouillon cubes/granules (which can be very salty. After taking the chops out, I thickened the sauce a little with cornstarch. Also used less sesame oil as it goes a long way.  I didn't have dried chanterelle mushrooms and substituted dried shitakes. Great served over white rice.

I made this with firm slices of tofu (tofu steaks) instead of pork and it was great - such a great and tangy sauce.  Instead of the mushrooms suggested her, I soaked and sliced up 6 chinese mushrooms and tossed them in the broth and I also used a can of button mushrooms.

WOW! Way too much salt.  Used lite soy sauce and it was still to much.  Between the chicken broth and soy sauce it was too much. If you eat this with just the chops and mushrooms it might be okay.  I suggest skipping the sauce.

the pork was tough and the sauce was salty...the sauce tasted ok but it was just too salty and the combo with pork was just wrong...maybe it would have been better as a sauce on steamed broccoli, cut down on the soy and chicken stock though...

I made this tonight for my family, but substituted low-sodium beef broth for the chicken (out of necessity) and left out the black mushrooms (out of preference). Good reviews by all, even my little brother who is ordinarily a picky eater. The sauce was tangy-sweet, and we had no problem with saltiness. The only change I'd suggest is to allow the sauce to reduce by half rather than 1/3... it was a little thin for my taste.

It was okay, I'd rather have a thicker sauce with my pork chops than a brothy sauce.
