Excellent recipe! I cut the tortillas with a pizza cutter which made it easy and gave the chips a uniform shape. I seasoned them with a mix of salt, cumin and chili powder. These are fabulous warm with homemade salsa!

I tried this recipe to use up flour tortillas I had. After I cooked the tortillas I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on them and made cinnamon chips like a local mexican place we have here. Just make sure you really watch after the 1st batch is done because the other batches cook alot faster. YUMMY!

I've been making chips like this for years and people ALWAYS rave about them!  My husband calls them "stupid good" lol  My tried and true tricks are... 1. Canola oil (vs. veg oil) makes them much crispier.  2.  use a cast iron skillet if you can, about 1" of oil  3. Your oil must be very hot or they will be greasy, and you must cook them long enough or they will have chewy spots.  I would recommend only turning them once, otherwise the oil will repeatedly saturate.  Just put them in the oil and don't mess with them until they're nice and brown, then flip and wait patiently again.  4.  Use kosher salt!!!!  A sprinkle after every batch, while they're still hot.   Then, if you have leftovers, pop them in a 400* oven for 5-8 min and they will crisp right back up again!  (which also works great for bagged chips too)  GREAT technique, more time consuming that opening a bag but well worth the comments!  :)

Excellent, especially while still warm. I sprinkled them with Lawry's Seasoning Salt which contributed nice color as well as flavor.  Almost as good as our local Mexican restaurant!

Quick, easy and fresh!  I was out of store bought tortillas so I thought I try these.  Kids had friends over and I couldn't make them fast enough!  I didn't use 2 cups of oil, only enough to cover the bottom of the pan.  Cooked 1 minute on each side.  Make sure your oil is hot enough before starting or you will end up with soggy chips.  Served with Easy Spinach dip recipe from this site.

If you leave the tortilla whole, you can make tostadas out of them. Or fold it in half, AFTER putting in the hot oil, and take it out before it gets too crisp, and have homemade taco shells.

I followed the directions exactly, but my corn chips seemed to be too crispy or too chewy. Plus, they had almost no flavor. I used to work in a Mexican restaurant and we used to make them exactly this way. I don't know if the corn tortillas are formulated differently for the chips, or if they used vegetable shortening instead of canola oil, but these didn't turn out as tasty as I remember. They weren't bad, but for the amount of oil, and the overall taste or heaviness, I would be just as happy with tortilla chips out of the bag.

They sure smelled good but I couldn't get the oil to dry up, even after resting them on a cookie wire and paper towels....they were pretty oily, I used Canola. Seemed like many were just too chewy, and not crispy like the ones you get in a restaurant. I think I'll try the baking method next time. I salted with fine popcorn salt and that worked well. Dipped them into some homemade guacamole and Vegan Bean Taco Filling on AR.
Update note: I was just reading in one of my Mexican cookbooks to let the tortillas dry out after you cut them for at least three hours or overnight. Maybe this would keep them from being chewy.

I also baked them, as one reviewer suggested. They were great! The one thing is - it is very tricky to bake them to just the right done-ness. I found that 12 minutes was too long,  but with 10 minutes they were still soft. They taste BURNT if they look completely BROWN. The goal is lightly browned on the edges. You may have to take them out and keep taste testing them as you go. I had to throw out my whole first batch because I thought that it was supposed to be brown.  After a couple batches, I got the hang of it, and they were a hit served with salsa!

I love this recipe because it doesn't call for filling a deep fryer with oil. I used very thin corn tortillas and a whole batch (8 chips) would be done in under 30 seconds. Wonderful! Thanks for the simple recipe.

These were really great! Much better than any tortilla chips you buy at the store! Make sure you have a thermometer before you try this recipe, though.  This is completely random, but after I finished making the chips, I had a lot of extra oil, so i fried half of a bagel and then put cinnamon and sugar on it and it tasted just like fried dough! Really, really good! Try it if you have extra time :)

I tried proudmammaof2's suggestion, sprinkling sugar and cinnamon on the wedged tortillas--but instead of frying, I brushed with extra virgin olive oil and baked at 350 for 10 min.  Yummy!

I didn't really enjoy the product.  I hope that was a result of bland-tasting tortillas, rather than the technique, because I did enjoy the process of making my own chips.  I'd love to make them from scratch, though.

I've been making my own tortilla chips this way for almost 20 years. Everyone agrees, they're the best! I usually make these for a crowd, using 3-6 dozen tortillas. When they're done, I dump them into a paper grocery bag, add salt and shake, shake, shake!  They're labor-intensive, for sure, but so very worth the effort. If making ahead, undercook them just a bit, then reheat on a baking sheet in a 300º oven for 10 minutes. One tip; add a small amount of salt and taste them with the salsa you'll be serving. Salty salsa + salty chips can be too much!

I have fried tortilla chips and have found that if you fry them for too long, you will get really chewy chips. Two minutes seems a bit long. Try a minute and half.

Simple and delicious! I used white corn tortilla chips and they tasted great with a sprinkling of salt. We used these just with salsa, but I want to try to make loaded nachos with them next time~YUMMY! Thanks for sharing. :)
