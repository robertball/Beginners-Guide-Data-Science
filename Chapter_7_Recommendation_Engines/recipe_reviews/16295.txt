My family loved this recipe and my husband is a very picky eater. I did though double the apple juice, gravy packet and onion soup mix. We really like a lot of gravy and this went awesome over mashed potatoes. Very tender in the crock pot!!

If you typically make your own gravy from scratch, you will probably not care for this recipe.  I have always made my own gravy from pan drippings, and have never cared for the taste of canned gravies.  I figured maybe this one would turn out a bit different due to the other ingredients, but the packaged gravy taste came through quite strongly.  Also, the apple juice added an odd flavor component.  What would be better is to poke a few holes into your roast, pour over 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar to tenderize and throw it in the slow cooker. It's a similar meat flavor (but better) without using all the other high sodium ingredients, and then you can make your own gravy with the liquids from the meat with a little corn starch or flour.

I was amazed at how tasty this turned out.  I put in a whole chuck roast which was still slightly frozen.  The meat was very tender. I will make this again.

This is the only recipe I ever use for roast!!!  You will love it!  The gravy it produces is wonderful and freezes very well.  I buy several roasts when they are on sale, make them at one time in my roaster and cut them up in meal-sized portions for the freezer.  Try this recipe...you can't go wrong!

Pretty good especially when served over rice and a veggie side. Be careful not to over cook. Start checking at two hours. Love the sweet beef flavor.

Really terrific flavor for a cheap chuck roast.  Odd how good these three ingredients taste together!  I thickened the juices by melting 2T butter in a skillet and stirring in 2T of flour, cooking briefly, and adding it to the crockpot to make gravy.  This fills all my recipe requirements--cheap, easy, and good!

I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  If I make it again, I will probably add some garlic cloves.

Agree whole-heartedly with most of the praise this recipe has recieved.  Ridiculously easy for how flavorful this comes out.  I cut a chuck roast (pot roast) into cubes and trim off the larger chunks of fat.  Serve with rice or noodles - its more of a stroganoff-type dish than a  stew.

One of the best recipes I've gotten off of this site. Even my hubby, who is not a beef fan, loved this.  Made exactly as directed in the oven, didn't need to double the gravy amount, plenty of delicious gravy.  Thanks for sharing!

Very delicious, very suprised how moist and tender it came out. I used only 3/4 cup apple juice and 3/4 cup water and the taste came out great.  It wasn't too sweet...just right.  I added potatoes and green beans 15 min. before it was done.  The kids loved it all.  Especially the potatoes that had a hint of apple juice in them.  I used onion-mushroom soup mix. I put a whole 2 lbs. chuck in and with just two kids and my hubby, only a little bit was left over.  Veggies and gravy were devoured.  Great recipe!

One of the other reviews mentioned not leaving it in passed a few hours (on high).  I put it in partially frozen on low for 8 hours and it was dry, but there was still plenty of gravy.  Next time I will not cook it for that long.

It doesn't get any easier than this!  I used stew meat and added carrots, potatoes and celery.  I wanted a stew with a lot of gravy so I doubled everything except the meat.  My family loved this and I loved that it only took a few minutes to get it together. Thanks!!

This was delicious!  My hubby told me that it's the best roast he's ever had!  The house smelled divine and the meat melted in our mouths.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I highly recommend this recipe...we'll be cooking it again in the near future.

I have, in the past, included chicken and beef liver in this recipe.  The apple juice overpowers the liver flavor enough that it just tastes like a different texture of beef.

Excellent base recipe! Simple and good as is, but a few simple additions make it amazing! I often use this recipe for game as well, antelope, elk, or deer, and just lengthen the cooking time for tenderness and to decrease the gamey flavor.  I always add some veggies and it makes a wonderful roast/stew with gravy.  Our favorite is this recipe with elk instead of the chuck roast, adding carrots and potatoes halfway into the cooking time!  YUM!

This really was pretty good.  I decided to prepare this for today as the high temp was to be in the lo 30's and I was going to be gone with scouts (boys in the AM and girls in the PM.... then church... and gosh is my head throbbing) all day long and in no mood to cook or mess around with sides.  I made the meat/flavorings portion mostly as written...I had about a 2 1/2 pound roast that I cubed.  I used 1/2 of the apple juice called for just because I just couldn't wrap my mind around using apple juice in stew... the balance I made up with water.  Next time, I will use all the apple juice, I think as now, it doesn't seem as foreign of a concept to me.  In order to make this a one shot deal dish, I added one large peeled and cubed red potato and two sliced carrots... and about 20 minutes before we sat down to eat, I threw into the crock a couple of handfuls of frozen peas.  For a family that doesn't really "do stew," this went off pretty well. My veggie loving son loved the veggies in the sauce... and my carnivore daughter loved the meat in the sauce... and my  hubby and I appreciated a hot meal with no kooky ingredients at the end of a long day. I would not change the adding of the veggies... but I would indeed follow the recipe basics to a T... including maybe a 1/2 lb less meat.  All in all, this is a keeper... and a great base recipe to build upon.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars! Thank you for such a nice comforting meal idea!

It was ok.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't awesome, either.  I'm not sure I liked the strong tang of the apple juice.  If I try it again, it will be with 1 cup of apple juice and 1/2 cup of water.

I made this yesterday. I changed the meat to a pork roast. (I've never heard of apple juice and beef together?)I cooked it for about 6.5 hours. A little too sweet for my taste. It was O.K., not the best crock pot meal I've ever tasted. I probably won't make it again.

This dish is wonderful on several levels.  It is very easy to put together. It is delicious right out of the oven, and is even better the next day-so it makes a great do-ahead meal.  The gravy is really nice on mashed potatoes, noodles or rice. A new family favorite!

This meal was a good meal.I used the crockpot recipe. It really only needs about 61/2 hours, otherwise, it shrinks to much.

This was super simple!  I threw all of it in a crockpot at lunch and left it all afternoon to cook for dinner.  It was delicious too.  I made some mashed potatoes and poured the meat and gravy over that.  I probably make this over and over because it was so simple and good.

It was an easy although average tasting dish.  I wasn’t crazy about it but that may be because of the cut of meat I used.  I had added carrots and they tasted very good.

I like to experiment and thought I'd try this combination for my slow cooker beef stew. I knew it wasn't going to make enough liquid for the amount of stew I was making, so I added another gravy package, a mushroom onion soup mix package, a little more apple juice and about two cups of water. The flavor worked out well... a touch of "tang". It just wasn't thick enough!

I added potatoes and carrots to this recipe and cooked it in a slow cooker for 9 hours on low.  I then added fresh mushrooms and some constarch to thicken the sauce.  It was a good easy meal but a little bland.  I think next time I will add a good bit of fresh pepper and maybe some spices to liven it up a little. I served it over rice with salad on the side.

My husband and I both love this recipe - so does my 18 month old son!
I add a little bit of garlic and sometimes stir in some sour cream at the end for a 
different texture and serve over egg noodles - its fantastic!

This was a great base stew.  I just added 1T of gravy powder and it didn't overwhelm the flavor like other reviews said it would and I added more Apple juice to cover the veggies I added, carrots and zuchinni.  Turned out great and my seven year old had two bowls full :)

This is one good recipe I will definitely make again..My 2 sons (17 and 2 1/2yrs old) can't stop saying "It's so YUMMY". To make it a complete meal I added celery, potatoes and carrots. A pinch of salt and pepper to taste...I will share this recipe for sure!

So incredibly easy and delicious.  Cut the apple sauce to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of water (I'm more of a savory vs. sweet fan).  Served over multigrain rotini.  Will definitely make again.

Very yummy, very easy-I used almost 3 lbs meat, and added a bag of frozen carrots & potatoes. Cut up an onion and tossed that in too. I increased the apple juice, added a half cup water, and used 2 packets of brown gravy mix. Very tasty over mashed potatoes. Whole family loved this dish!!

I cooked this recipe as it was, no changes and it was great. I have a 16 year old and he is very picky, but this won him over. He even had leftovers the next day and said it was better. Yup i would make this again. Thank you

I made some modifications to make this a real stew. The last 2 hours of cooking, I added the following vegetables cut in bite size pieces:
3 medium potatoes, 4 carrots, 1 stalk celery, 2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, and 1 samll onion, chopped. Add 1 can beef broth and thicken with a little cornstarch. So good on a chilly evening served with johnny cake.

I doubled the gravy, onion soup, apple juice mixture (but used 2 cups apple juice, 1 cup water) and added four medium sized potatoes (diced) and about a cup and a half of carrots (chopped).  I also added some minced garlic.  I served it over buttered egg noodles and it turned out pretty well.

One of the better beef stew combinations I have made in the crockpot.  Not to thick just right in about 6.5 hours as another rater suggested.  I added a few frozen veggies about 1.5 hours before done time and a few canned about 0.50 hours before done time.  Served over rice.  The rice/veggie combo was a win-win for my preschooler and the meat served as a medium for the meat lover in the family.  I did not think things were too salty or sweet and I did add one package of beef boullion to the mixture.  Will try again!

I've made this several times, both for home and for church potluck dinners.  It's one of my favorites!  I usually use part apple juice and part water or beef stock for the liquid, as I don't favor a very sweet taste for my main dishes.

This was really moist and flavorful, and the house smelled wonderful all day while it cooked in the slow cooker. Served with mashed potatoes and the cafeteria carrot souffle from this site.

This was as equally good as it was simple. I went with the advice of many and used a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I served it over jasmine rice to my meat-loving boyfriend who gave it a 10 out of 10.

I've made this recipe many times when we've had a house full of guests and I'd rather spend my time with them than cooking.  It makes a lot and goes over well.  Recently I've decided that the recipe is just a little too salty, I don't know if it's the brand of gravy mix or onion soup mix, but I think I will cut one or the other in half and see if that helps reduce the saltiness next time.  Otherwise, very good.

This was very easy to make and came out good.  I took some of the suggestions and coated the meat in flour (sauce was plenty thick) added some mushrooms toward the end and served over buttered noodles.  Will definitely make this one again.

this was very moist and tender! It was really good over rice. I think that I will add some cut up onion and some mushrooms. My husband really enjoyed coming home to this after a day of hunting in the woods! Thank you for the recipe.:)

This was excellent!  I used leftover sparkling apple cider as that's all I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again.  Leftovers are being turned into either stew or soup--can't decide which!

I was surprised that this tasted so good because it is an odd combination of ingrediants. My only complaint is that the gravy didn't thicken as well as I hoped but I think it can be modified with some flour(?) or less apple juice. We served over the last of the thanksgiving mashed potatoes and we all enjoyed this.  The apple juice gives the meat a unique flavor. Thanks Jane!

This was my first recipe made in my first crockpot!  Super easy!  I ended up cooking it on Low for 11 hours, and the meat was so tender, it fell apart.  I thought the gravy was too bland for rice, so I'll try it with pasta next time.  I will definitely make this many times.

This was, by far, the easiest meal. Slow cooking the meat and after making gravy from the pot, then instant mashed potatoes and frozen veggies. The taste was amazing. Also, I used a 1lb piece of meat. No burning and not dry.

This is one of the first recipes I made from this site when I discovered it years ago and I make it at least twice a year. This is hands-down my boyfriend's favorite dish that I make. I prepare it exactly how the recipe states as it doesn't need "improving". Serve it over egg noodles with a garden salad or green veggies on the side. Yum! Been meaning to thank you for years for this one so here you go: Thank you!

This was great. I did increase it to two packs each of soup mix and gravy and used 3 cups of apple juice. I strained the onion pieces when it was done and made a gravy using some flour to thicken it. I also served the garlic red mashed potatoes recipe I found on here. They went together perfectly.

Delicious as is.  If you want a one-dish meal, then add veggies and potatos.  I made it as is and served it over egg noodles and a side veggie/bread.  This is an effortless recipe that needs nothing for it to be great.  Thanks for sharing!!

This dish was delicious!  I only made a couple slight changes: I substituted 1-1/2 pounds of venison stew meat, and I added 1/2 cup of water due to cooking time.  The meat cooked all day - about 11 hours by the time DH got home.
The gravy had a wonderful flavor and covered any gamey taste in the venison, which was out-of-this-world-tender.
We served this over jasmine rice (yum!), with steamed broccoli on the side.
This is going into my favorite recipes binder!

This was wonderful!  Will definitely make again.  It was so easy and I always have the ingredients on hand.  I used chuck steaks instead of roast which are thinner.  I also reduced the apple juice to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of water with beef boullion sprinkled in.  I cooked it in the oven and it came out perfectly.  I also added baby carrots the last 30 minutes.  Will try adding potatoes, too, next time.  Thanks so much!

Very easy to do although not a stew in my opinion.  The gravy was delicious served over the mashed potatoes. Next time I make this I am going to do as other reviewers suggested and add some vegetables to it and thicken the gravy just a bit.  Thanks for the add on this one.

Doubled the recipe.  The house smelled wonderful while it cooked.  Using egg noodles, the whole family loved this though they suggested I added more to it next time, like carrots, etc.

Mine cooked for a couple hours too long, so I really needed to double the liquid.  It got a litle 'crispy' on the outside, but for the most part, the roast had great flavor and was very moist - the kids loved it.

I followed this recipe exactly to the author's specs (oven method)... and initially, I was concered about the overload of onion soup-flavoring. As the meat baked, however, the flavors melded and produced a nice outcome. DBF, who rarely allows me in the kitchen due to my lack of culinary skills, and is a very picky eater, absolutely LOVED this dish. Thank YOU, Jane, for sharing a great recipe! Will make this again and again.

I added many vegetables for stew and then thicken the juice at the end with a little flour.  It's great!

Nice taste. I used spicy onion soup mix for a bit of tang.

tasty, quick clean up--and the kids loved it with rice.  (My kids are rice lovers--rice everyday and anything else is a special treat.)
