I think the pudding turned out a little bland.  I would use more nutmeg, maybe even 1/2 tsp.  I also used close to 4 1/2 C of rhubarb and that was barely enough.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so used what I had (2%) and I substituted a generous amount of cinnamon for the nutmeg. it was fantastic hot with vanilla ice cream. Will definately make this again and again!

Although I only made half the recipe, I used 2 cups of frozen rhubarb (thawed slightly and drained on a paper towel to absorb excess moisture) and thought the proportions were just right.  Instead of using a lot of fresh rhubarb in the spring, I like to freeze it in ziploc bags and use it throughout the year.  I gave this recipe a "5" based on adding the extra fruit and extra nutmeg.

What a pleasant surprise! I was looking to use up last year's frozen rhubarb so wanted to use a few cups and found this. It really tastes like a bread pudding. I used cinnamon ,as suggested and just a little less sugar. Delicious!

I would either add more rhubard or make less base the next time I make this (which I will.)  I think I might add cinnamon also.  We loved the concept, though and I think it would also work with other fruits.  Thanks for sharing!

We really liked this dessert. I mixed the batter right in my nonstick pan, reduced the baking soda to 1/4 tsp and omitted the salt, added a splash of vanilla as well. I doubled the rhubarb as it didn't seem like much, halved the sugar, sprinkled the top of the batter with cinnamon sugar and the top of the rhubarb as well. 45 minutes was perfect, great with vanilla ice cream.

Didn't care for this at all.  I try alot of recipes on All Recipes site and most are good.  I am a very good cook.  I definitely will not make this again. It isn't really pudding.  It has the consistency of paste.

Loved it!! Added some strawberries because I had them. Since I'm growing rhubarb in my garden, I'll make this again and again! Delicious.

This one is a keeper. I know that buttermilk is better but had to used milk soured with vinegar. It works well. Cut the sugar sprinkled on top of the rhubarb to 2/3  cup and then sprinkled with a package of raspberry jello powder. Adds great color. Always looking for more recipes for rhubarb. 3 cups of rhubarb is the minimum, you can always add more or try adding other fruit with it.

I should've baked it longer, it didn't cook all the way through in the 45 minutes.  Maybe using a little lemon juice would bring out the rhubarb a little more.

I made this almost just as written (but halved the sugar and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg). It looks exactly like the picture, and the texture and consistency is fine. It's very much like some cobblers I've made, as the dough rises to the top. However, it is fairly bland.   Maybe adding a bit of lemon juice to the water would be the key to livening it up a bit.

I used a 9"x9" pan, & a little more rhubarb, and a little  less sugar and the results are great. I don't  bake pies - this will definitely suffice.

very good! I added about 1/2 t cinnamon to the  batter along with 1/4 t nutmeg.  I mixed the 1 cup sugar with the rhubarb before layering then sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Flavour was very good although a little on the sweet side.  Next time I'll try a little less sugar (maybe 3/4 c).

This turned out very well! I made some changes: I used whole wheat flour, I cut the sugar by 1/2, then used 1/4 tsp powdered Stevia in the dough part and 1/2 tsp with the rhubarb. (I mixed the 1/2 tsp with the 1/2 cup sugar before sprinkling over rhubarb. I also used a little over 4 cups rhubarb (a good 1 lb). I sprinkled with nutmeg and cinnamon. Oh, I used a little less butter. It is great!
