I make this recipe constantly, either for dinner in our home or as a casserole when we visit.  People rave about it, and have continually ask for the recipe.  I do use fresh mango rather than chutney and find this a lot nicer and fresher.  We use the hot curry paste and it makes all the difference in the world.  You will love this recipe.  We serve with cooked long grain rice.

This is the kind of recipe that always makes me wonder why anyone would choose to make frozen or boxed dinners. In the same amount of time, you've got an excellent, impressive dish that tastes like a human made it. I increased the chutney and curry, just because I like it spicy, and served this over rice with chopped cilantro and fresh chilled mango. Yum! Thanks for the recipe! :)

This recipe was easy and came out really well. I cut up about 4 breasts after first seasoning them with salt and pepper. For the curry paste, I used a whole 6 oz jar of yellow curry paste and kind of eye-balled the chutney so it was nice and spicy. It was already very saucy then so I only added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. Very yummy and definitely going into rotation from now on.

Just so everybody knows, you can buy mango chutney in the grocery store.  Here in Nova Scotia it is in the foreign food section with other spices and sauces.  It's easier than making it from scratch.

Super yummy! I used vindaloo paste instead of plain red curry paste--and boy did that add an extra kick to this dish!  Also, I almost bought mango butter, but then I found the mango chutney in the international aisle, and I'm sooo glad I did because they are NOT interchangeable.  Serve this over 1/2 cup of brown rice for a delicious dish that's only about 350 calories!

I love meals that don't taste like you made them at home! Very Delicious, a little sweet and a little spicy! My husband really enjoyed it too, but he said that the tomatoes in the dish made it seem almost italian. Next time I am going to make it with red bell peppers, instead of tomatoes. I served it over coconut jasmine rice.

I am novice cook! I made this for my boyfriend who is from Southern India, where chicken curries are very popular. I did add a tiny bit of coconut milk to the recipe and used hot curry paste ( he likes it very spicy). He was extremely happy with the way it turned out and insisted I make more in the future.  Great Recipe!! Thank you! :)

Simple. Very easy to make. And it tasted good. I used a mild curry paste and regular mango chutney which made it mild with a little kick.

Store-bought chutney always makes me queasy. So I made mine from scratch (it was easy!) Cooked the rest just as stated, and my hunger abated. We ate it while we played Parcheesi.

I just made this recipe today and it came out quite well: Very easy to prepare.  I tried to use fresh mango as someone else suggested but unfortunately it didn't really affect the overall flavor as much as I would have liked.  Therefore I'll try making some chutney from scratch and give it another whirl again soon.

This was so yummy and so fast! I will definitely make it again, it's a winner.
I added a little grated ginger, crushed red pepper a little red wine, some Goya adobo, I didn't really measure anything, just threw it in!

Simple, quick, delicious!

Great recipe. I thought it could use more heat, and red pepper flakes in the second batch helped. A green pepper cut into strips added with the onions filled it out without compromising the taste.

I had a jar of curry paste in the refrigerator, but it had seen better days and I had to toss it.  So I used some Trader Joe's Thai red curry sauce instead.  I added one chopped fresh mango and some red bell pepper to the dish, and used only one 15oz can of fired roasted diced tomatoes.  I didn't want the tomatoes to over power the dish.  Luckily I had a big jar of mango chutney.  This was lovely and we enjoyed it very much.  Served this with a barley casserole from this site, which although it may sound weird, went well with the curry.  Thanks so much for the post, Cheri!

Very good but I changed a few things....  I eliminated the tomatoes all together.  I sauteed julienne yellow peppers along with the onion and garlic and added 1 T. fresh ginger.  Then, once the chicken cooked for a few minutes, I added about 4 oz. coconut milk.  Then followed the remaining recipe.  We put this over coconut jasmine rice and it was delicious.  The sauce makes the dish so dont skimp!

Delicious! I didn't have curry paste, so I used powder and added pepper flakes. Also, after the onions and garlic were sauteed, I let everything simmer slowly for about 45 minutes.

this would hv been a great 5 star recipe hd it nt bn for the 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  they overpower the dish and that's all the flavor one is left with.  the next time I prepare this dish, I plan to add fresh mango, grn bell pepper and a dash of ginger; omit the diced tomatoes all together.

Very easy and delicious! Even easier to toss cube chicken with the onion garlic and curry (no butter needed). sautee then add chutney and tomatoes. YUMMY! i also added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of coconut milk which smoothed it out and seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and cayenne. so easy and versatile.

I made this last night and we enjoyed it for two meals. I used 4 teaspoons of yellow curry powder and about 1/2 teaspoon each of coriander and cumin. I also sliced 4 small zucchini and added it when I added the chicken broth and coconut milk. I used the whole can pf broth. I garnished with golden raisens and pistachios. so it seemed more Infian than Thai

Doubled the recipe and served with fresh mangos as well as the mango chutney I made from this site. Placed it on a bed of brown rice. Excellent dinner and faster than ordering out!

I used a little extra mango chutney (about 3/4 c.) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Served this over rice pilaf and everyone loved it!  Easy recipe and excellent flavors!

I think the flavor really depends on the brand of chutney you buy and the type of curry paste you use.  Mine turned out sweeter than I'd have liked, so I added some salt to the recipe to help balance out the flavor.  Hubby and friend liked it a lot.  Thus the extra star.  For the curry paste, I would definitely not use a thai paste.  I made a simple curry paste by mixing in 1t minced ginger, 1 minced clove garlic, and 1.5t white vinegar with 3T of curry powder.

This is the BEST meal I've cooked in a long time, on or off this site!!  Had all the ingredients on hand, my only substitution/addition was 2-3 TB of curry powder for the curry paste and a can of lite coconut milk as suggested by others.  What a WONDERFUL, fragrant blend of flavors, and quick and easy way to make a better than restaurant dinner!!!  YUM...!!

I used a red pepper instead of tomatoes, served it over cauliflower "rice" (my husband is big into the paleo diet), and topped it with toasted coconut.  Delicious!

Super easy and impressive dish to make! I do not drain the tomatoes and simmer it longer for a nice creamy sauce to cover the rice and dip naan in!

Made this VEGETARIAN, substituting 14oz tofu for the chicken. I also used red, yellow and green peppers, sauteed with the onion and garlic, instead of the tomatoes.  The simple sauce of chutney and curry paste was perfect!

Made this using b/l s/l chicken thighs chunks.  I added strips of red bell pepper in with the onions and garlic saute and only used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  Then mixed the curry paste with about 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Put it all into the crock pot with the chutney and let it simmer for about an hour.   Served it over jasmine rice.  It was  delicious-thank you for sharing!
PS- I have also added light coconut milk and bamboo shoots to this recipe.

Easy to make.  Very tasty.  I used a mild curry (the kind that comes in the bar) and just put it over steamed brown rice.  I would make this for guests.

Real good.  We liked it - me and the kids.   I added some coconut milk.  Maybe 3/4 cup.  It made for a more complex flavor.

Quick, easy and delicious. The better quality of curry paste and chutney you use, naturally, the better the result.

thanks! Yummy. The whole family loved this very much. With the addition of fresh mango this is 5 stars. I did use boneless chicken thighs, defatted and cut smaller, nearly 2 1/2 lbs, because that is what I had. I used a combination of butter and cooking oil for the onions. I used the mild curry paste and stirred it in with the onions after a few minutes to heat it up, then put the chicken in. I added about 1/4-1/2 tsp cayenne pepper towards the end. I added about 1 whole fresh mango chopped, and used about 10 oz of homemade tomato sauce made from my garden tomatoes instead of canned, because that is what I had. Served with basmati rice, tandoori naan, some homemade raita, some Indian lime pickle relish and roasted asparagus (not very Indian but that's what was in the fridge).

I'm not a big fan of chutney so I followed another reviewer's lead and used finely chopped mango instead. I thought it was pretty good, but not great. Maybe 3.5 stars so I'll bump it up an extra star because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.

It came out really good. I used shrimp instead of chicken in mine because I stopped eating beef/poultry for a bit. Used the recipe in the same exact way and as I said- it came out really good!

I loved this dish, however, I needed a little color and wanted to add some nutrients.  I added fresh spinach and brocolli slaw at the very end, mixed in and served.

This was about the easiest recipe I've found on this site and was it ever great! The longest part is waiting for the rice to boil! The only thing I might change next time I make it is, a little less mango chutney (prob a 1/3 cup) and a bit more curry paste. Thanks for the recipe, I will definately make it again!

I really enjoyed this recipe and Made it with 3 boneless breasts, 1 jar of mango chutney and 1 sml jar of curry paste as suggested in one of the reviews.
I made a few changes to balance the sweetness of the mango chutney.
I added finely chopped fresh ginger and 1/3 of a green bell pepper cut thin and lengthwise.
Served and added fresh basil to garnish.
This gave it a better flavor for me and my husband and has made it into my recipe box.

Thanks Cheri for the recipe!

Really easy to make - and approved by the boyfriend! Not as good as Taste of India curry, but about as good as I think I will be able to accomplish.  Goes really well with spiced or plain rice.  Don't forget the naan!

Really good.  Add a can of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans for a little extra flavor and mouth feel.  One could substitute firm tofu for the chicken for a vegetarian option.

Great combo of flavors! I made a vegan version, using Beyond Meat veggie chicken and Earth Balance buttery spread. I took another reviewer's suggestion and used fresh mango (I was lazy and saw it already cut up in the store when I was in the produce section). My wife loved the dish also - hearty, filling, and delicious.

Easy and delicious. I made a few substitutions because I did not have the ingredients. I used coconut oil instead of butter and I had no curry paste so I used tomato paste and curry powder,I used both mango chutney and fresh mangoes, last I used fire roasted tomatoes with chilies. Served it with basmati rice and samosas. Very satisfying.

My whole family loved the dish, I served it over Basmati Rice.  When I make it again, I plan to use less mango chutney, it was a bit too sweet, and madras curry in addition to the curry paste for a bit more spice.

This was a really good recipe on its own. I would like to try remaking it after draining the tomatoes, it made the whole thing a little runny but we made it with white rice so it soaked up the flavor nicely.

Meh. I followed the instructions exactly and it was just OK. I wanted to be impressed, but it was really just blah. Not something I would make again.

Delicious and really easy. I used one 14 ounce can of tomatoes and didn't drain them, which produced a wonderful sauce. A keeper!

This wasn't too bad--but I forgot that hubs isn't a fan of warmed tomatoes, and I sometimes take a dim view of them as well if there are a lot over rice (which is of course what I did).  So, perhaps less tomatoes for this house.  I only really remembered when hubs commented, then had a "duh" moment.  I didn't have curry paste and although I know this isn't an exact sub, I used curry powder instead and it was fine.  I also had frozen chicken breast that I'd forgotten to defrost, so I just used 4 chicken breasts and cooked a bit longer.  I like the mango chutney in this, but I think I'd prefer a different veggie, so maybe we'll do that next time.  Very easy and tasty otherwise, though.  For those of you who would like to make your own mango chutney, there's several recipes on here for it.  Just do a search for mango chutney and you will find a few options to try.  For curry paste, there's a recipe at Thaitable, food, and thaifoodabout (all .com websites).  A google search will find you a few more as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

We love curried chicken dishes in our house and this dish was another one that everyone gobbled up.  We passed this recipe on the day we made it.  We will definitely make this again.

This was too easy.  I kept scrolling down looking for more instructions.  It turned out perfect and was a welcomed change in taste.  The hardest part was finding the mango chutney and curry paste.  (My husband is on his second helping as I write this)

This was excellent! Substituted green & red bell peppers for the tomatoes. Served over the Asian coconut rice from this website and garnished with shredded coconut and fresh diced mango. Amazing!! This is very mild the way it is written. I will try and extra T of red curry paste next time.

Very good though I added more of the chutney than recommended and used powdered rather than paste curry

Best surprise in a while. Easy, Fast and Delicious.
We did leave the tomatoes out per reviewers who felt it made the dish more Italian, still delicous. Will make this again and again

This was delicious and simple.  I'm amazed that people still buy frozen dinners.  In about 30 mins I had this completed and served with couscous and naan.  The only thing I would do different is buy hot curry paste...all I had on hand was mild, but it was still great.
