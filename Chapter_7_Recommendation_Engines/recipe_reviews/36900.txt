I make this often with the following changes.  Add 1 tsp cinnamon, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Use only 1 or 2 eggs and 3 tablespoons butter.  I bake it in a 9x13 baking dish at 400 degrees for ~23 minutes.  Grate nutmeg and dust top with powdered sugar after removing from the oven.  My family loves this dish for breakfast, even my picky 2 year old!  Often I substitute in up to 1/4 cup wheat germ for 1/4 cup of the flour (1/4 C wheat germ + 3/4 C flour). Sometimes I add a well-mashed banana to the batter.  It comes out great every time, with some variation on the texture.

I've made this for years in our B&B!  Only I did it using 4 eggs and dash of nutmeg and baked in a pre-heated iron skillet at 450.  I put the butter in the hot pan, after it melted and sizzled, then pour in the batter!  That gives it a head start on it's cooking and rising capabilities!  Bake for 20 minutes! Gorgeous presentation filled with fresh fruit of the season and dollop of mixture of sour cream and brown sugar!

The whole family enjoys this.  The kids love to see it puff up in the oven.  You can cook it on a temp up to 400 degrees and cut the cook time to 20-25 min.

This is a great recipe, but my mom makes it truly fabulous with buttermilk syrup. mix 1 1/2 cups white sugar, 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup butter, 2 TBSP corn syrup and 1 tsp baking soda. Bring to a boil, cook for seven minutes, then stir in 2 tsps vanilla. YUMMY! It's perfect on these pancakes.

This was EXCELLENT!  I added sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and I halved the recipe and baked it in a square pan at 400 for about 12 minutes.  It turned out perfectly, very much like a slightly thick crepe.  It wasn't too mushy or too dry.  While it was baking I cooked some apples in butter, cinnamon, and sugar in a covered skillet over medium heat and poored them on top when it came out of the oven....this was just delicious!  I served it with maple syrup, definately an optional choice, it didn't need it by any means.

These were great! I was able to get two large pancakes out of this recipe. Per other recommendations I added nutmeg, in this case allspice, and about 4 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. It improved the flavor greatly. I also had enough to make another one this morning. I refrigerated the batter and set it out while the oven preheated. The result was beautifully brown and fluffy pancake. For syrup I used lemon wedges, powdered sugar and some butter. Viola! Fantastic!!! Thanks for sharing!

I used to make this when I was younger but couldn't remember the amount of the ingredients, so I used this recipe.  It was bland and flavorless and used twice as much ingredients than should be used. Fortunately I found my old recipe and will follow it next time.  Basically, it turned out way to thick and chewy than it is supposed to.  It should only be 3 eggs and 1/2 cup sugar and milk.

Excellent! I suggest using an 9X13 pan (or 7X11). I used a smaller dish and while baking, the pancake "grew" up the sides and into the oven rack above! It was quite a sight! When I took it out of the oven it settled much like a souffle! I added 4T sugar and 1t cinnamon to mixture as previous reviewers suggested (I'm glad I did!). Sprinkled with powdered sugar and topped with defrosted frozen sliced strawberries! Everyone liked it very much!

I have made this recipe for years.  The only difference is that I bake mine at 450 degrees.  This quantity will make two pancakes baked in cast iron skillets.  I think the cast iron (and the high cooking temp.) is essential for getting the right texture.  Just make sure you use a well-seasoned pan and spray it liberally with cooking spray.  I eat my pancake with honey.  I have yet to find a child that doesn't love these!

Nostalgia overwhelmed me as I read the reviews ahead. In my early days, pursuing what was to be my lifetime profession, I worked the "Morning Table" in the kitchen of the world famous Kadinsky Restaurant in the "Steinenberger Kurhaus Hotel" in The Hague and one of my tasks was to gather the discarded vanilla pods from the Pastry Chef and then add them to a sugar bin, labelled "For the Babies". The babies of course was the name given to the pancake, made very much like the one we are reviewing here. So I have now made this recipe, with the only addition being two tablespoons of vanilla sugar from my own home bin. I made a couple of heat and position adjustments but did not alter the body of the recipe. Turned out great. At The Kandisky, if memory serves me, the Babies were served with a sweet Dutch Chocolate and fresh fruit (usually rasberry) topping, and being Holland and breakfast, it was often presented along with coddled eggs. The hotel's Silver Tray tradition. Good recipe.Tip: After scraping seeds from Vanilla Bean for custards etc, keep the pod(s) in an airtight jar with granulated sugar, for many uses and flavours.

This is the breakfast my mom would always make for me when I was sick, and I always loved it!  This recipe tastes just like I remembered it.  I put it in a 9x13 pan.  It's so easy to make too.  I forgot to add the salt, but the I used salted butter so it was all good.  I took a reviewer's advice to bake at 400 for about 25 minutes.  I didn't want to wait any longer than that this morning!  Served with real maple syrup, but I also enjoy lemon juice on powdered sugar with this.

German Pancakes have been a favorite  except we always use powdered sugar and fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of syrup.

My mother made this for us all the time, only we called it "Puffy Oven Pancake"!!   I've carried the recipe on for my kids and they love it.  The ingredients here are exactly what I use, only I put them in a 9x13 pan and bake it for 18 minutes at 425.  It turns out PERFECT!!  The one thing we do add to it is vanilla....I mix the ingredients in a blender.

It's rare for me to rate a recipe with five stars, but this one deserves it because it was such a surprise. The recipe is very simple, and I made it exactly as written, baking it in a 9-inch round metal pan. I didn't expect much, and didn't know how this would turn out, but my results were almost identical to the picture on the recipe's page (a little lighter in color, since I baked it for about 35 minutes). Even then it just looked okay, but I cut out a wedge or two, poured on some real maple syrup, and the taste and "mouthfeel" were fabulous. I polished it off for three consecutive breakfasts (and the microwaved leftovers were almost as good as the freshly-baked portion was). This recipe is a real sleeper. It's not a crepe or even a pancake, being very thick. And it's eggier than those items would be, maybe like a thick soufflé. It was just great to eat, and I think I'll be making it again soon. Thanks!

This is such an easy and versatile recipe; you can't go wrong with it.   I have made this a lot (my kids LOVE when I make this for breakfast) and I've made it with fewer eggs, six eggs, with sugar/cinnamon, without sugar/cinnamon, etc.  There just isn't a way for these to turn out badly.    Our favorite way to make this is in a 9x13 pan with five eggs instead of six (but six?  still works well.  as does three.  or four.) and adding a few tablespoons of sugar.  We also add cinnamon and vanilla; but, again, it's not necessary.   We use the entire 1/4 C butter because we like how it crisps up the edges; but if you cut it down to be healthy, the pancake will still turn out okay.     Several have mentioned cooking a shorter amount of time on a higher temperature, which does work; but I've found that we like the texture best when we cook at 350 for the 30-40 minutes.

My husband grew up eating these!  We call them Big Babies" or  "Dutch babies". I serve them with fried apples. Just cut up apples in bite size pieces and fry in butter, with cinnamon and brown sugar. 
Yummy!

We just had these for breakfast and loved them. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the pancake mix. Out of the over i sprinkled with cinnamon and powdered sugar. I also topped with and apple topping I often use for french toast. 2tbsp butter, 1/2c brown sugar,1 tsp cinnamon melted in fry pan, add 3 sliced apples with 1/3 c water, simmer for 8-10 minute. Delicious!!! This base pancake will lend itself for all kinds of wonderful toppings. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was AMAZING!! I'll never eat a regular pancake again! I halved the recipe and took some other reviewers advice adding 1/4 cup of sugar and a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. Also, I cut up and sautéed some fresh strawberries for syrup, which was perfect! Next I will make it without the sugar and sautee some sausage, onions, and peppers for the filling for a more savory breakfast. Simply wonderful!

For anyone who is "disappointed" in this recipe because it's not like the pancakes you know and love, it's because this is NOT like the pancakes you know and love.  German pancakes are mostly eggs so they're closer to souffles, crepes or a baked omelet in a way.  Use a 9x13 pan.  You can safely use 2 T butter (I like it with a little less butter).  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  It will rise on the edges and sometimes even makes waves in the middle.   I also blend everything for a short time (except the butter) in a blender to make sure it's mixed well.  Sprinkle confectioner sugar on top and serve with options of honey, maple syrup, homemade buttermilk syrup, cinnamon sugar, apricot syrup, etc.   Whatever you want!  It's good with many things.

So good! I never add sugar to my German pancakes-too sweet for my liking. Just a little honey, powdered sugar or jam on top is perfect.

I followed some others suggestions and added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla, a pinch of nutmeg and 3 T sugar. Baked in a well seasoned, preheated cast iron skillet at 450 for 20 min. It came out of the oven HUGE, but then fell. Squeezed the juice of 1 lemon on top and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Did not need anything else. It was wonderful and my wife loved it, too.

I had this just once before when a friend made it for breakfast - loved it.  So I was happy to see this recipe.  I made it exactly as written since I had no experience making it.  It puffed up nicely and looked great, however it was a good thing I read the reviews first.  Some wrote that the cooking time should be 20 minutes, I baked it for 30 minutes and that was too long.  The bottom was rather dry and stuck to my pan.  Other than that, both my husband and I enjoyed it. Will make again, with a few changes of course.  Also, the recipe asks for a "medium" baking pan - I was going to use an 8x8 pan but again, a reviewer  suggested 9x13 - thank you so much for that, it would not have turned out at all.

Interesting recipe....First, I will say that my husband, who is German, says he never had anything like this in his life and that the only German"pancakes" he knew of were the potato latkes that his mother and grandmother used to make.  Having said that, I'll move on to the recipe which is so easy that it almost makes itself!  I did add a bit of nutmeg after reading the other reviews and baked it in a large, ovenproof frying pan at 375 for 30 minutes.  It is also quite impressive to watch while it bakes.  My husband kept asking if I were sure that it wasn't a souffle.  (I even took a pic when it was done to send to my daughter.  ;-))  This recipe is pure comfort food but is light with a nearly creamy center shiny with melted butter.  How bad could that be?  (To paraphrase Ina Garten.....)  I ate it with cherry preserves and it was delich.  My husband added more butter (!!) and maple syrup.  He said that it was good....nothing more; however, I plan the menus and loved it, so I will definitely be serving it again, especially on a weekend morning when I need to get breakfast on the table while multitasking various other things.

I love this recipe! If you are like me and a crepe is not enough but a pancake or a waffle is too heavy this is the breakfast you have been waiting for. I will be using this one very often! I would suggest making your own buttermilk syrup to go with them, you can find the recipe for that in some of the other German Pancake recipes. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the pancake mix. I also paired these with scrambled eggs with cheese and fried SPAM. If you don't eat fried SPAM on a regular basis you are probably doing your health a favor but your mouth is missing out!

Ok I never give bad reviews but I was bummed after I made this!  I have made German pancakes before from this site but couldn't remember the name.  After making this I realized there is no way this was the same recipe.  This was very dense and almost dry because it was like solid egg.  I just searched everywhere trying to figure out what I made before and finally found it.  Big GErmans!!  That, to me, was much better.  It is about the same but only has 4 eggs and some lemon juice in it.  I remember it really fluffing up and just tasting amazing.  I had even made it with egg subsitute and still liked it, though not as much.  I could this 2 stars because my daughter liked it but the other recipe was much more to my tastes.

Turned this gluten and dairy free by substituting GF all-purpose flour (add 1 tsp. zanthum gum) and almond milk. Added spices as recommended in other reviews. Yummy! Next time will add baking soda and use all 6 eggs (only used 4) to get more fluffiness as was dense because of GF substitutions. Family loved!!

Really good recipe! I cut the recipe in half and make it in a 10-inch pie pan. For the half-recipe, I use 2 eggs instead of 3 and less butter than is called for. I butter the pie pan and add a bit of melted butter into the batter. I followed other commenters' advice and added a bit of sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I think part of what makes this recipe really good is that it's fairly flexible. You can introduce a few variations, and it always turns out good.

Great receipe, but my grandma did these on the stove. In a skillet heat up a couple tablespoons of oil & a little butter, and pour pancake size and fry. They are crispy on the edges and are great.

Take all the ingredients except the butter, put them in a blender or processor. blend well. Now you have a batter for egg pancakes that you will never forget.  Top these pancakes with sugar or jam, roll em up and enjoy. That' the way we used to have these.

Love these pancakes!! They have an eggy taste which I love. And I like that you add your own sugar at the end. God knows we have far too much sugar in things already these days. They are kind of in between a pancake and an omelette. Great with lemon juice and powdered sugar.

This is the recipe for the German pancakes I remember my mom making for me as a child.  My family tradition is to top each pancake with lemon juice and powdered sugar.  My mom always used a 9X13 pan if you're wondering what size to use.

I made it in a glass 9x13 baking dish, added 2 tbs of sugar to the mix and served it with lemon juice and powdered sugar. In our opinion, the flavor was good - but just a tad too eggy and dense for our liking.

I love this recipe for it's simplicity and visual presentation.  Recently I cut this recipe into a single serving and baked in a ramekin. Although not as thin as when baked in a larger pan, the taste was just the same and it was still visually appealing.  I am now thinking that even when making for more guests, that I will make individual servings baked in ramekins, dusted with powdered sugar and topped with either a warm apple compote or maple syrup.

This recipe is definitely a keeper. Very yummy and versatile. I made it for fathers day brekky this morning and everything loved it. For four people who don't eat much I halved the recipe and we just managed to polish it off. Before baking I dusted ours with cinnamon, nutmeg and a little jaggery (proper brown sugar). We topped it with some extra butter, sliced banana, a little cream, rasberries and a tiny bit of maple syrup. Just delicious.

Without such additions I think this'd work very well with savoury toppings such as wilted spinach, mushrooms, cracked black pepper and a nice hard cheese grated on top. That's what I'll be trying next time.

Baked this in a square baking dish and filled the cooked pancake with pineapple and bananas, sprinkled coconut and brown sugar on top. Serve with sour cream, yum. It might be better baked in a 9x12 cake pan, the custard bottom would be thinner.

This was a fabulous breakfast dish. Due to living in high altitudes added in an extra teaspoon flour. Dusted with powder sugar before eating it. Will definitely make this dish again and will add fresh fruit in the middle of the dish.

I made this with a bit of vanilla and topped it with fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and a bit of maple syrup. I'm in heaven! I will be making this a part of my family weekends and holidays.

Has anyone tried mixing apples, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg in a bowl then melt the butter in a (perferably) cast iron skillet on med- low heat and brush it around to coat the inside then add the apple mixture and pour the batter over the top then bake it? Then when it's done invert it onto a platter or large plate. That's how I've done it in the past.

Our family has been making this recipe for years. We love it with sausage links, and add either applesauce, slightly sweetened with brown sugar and nutmeg-cinnamon added, or apple pie filling (I bottle my own). Both make a delicious topping.

We love to eat these pancakes with berry jam, it tastes much more authentic this way. Although syrup tastes good too. These pancakes are easy to make, fun to watch bake, and everybody loves to eat them! I just discovered them about 10 years ago, but ever since my family has been enjoying them.

I cooked it in a 11 x 15 pan to make it thinner and more like pancakes. Added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. Great way to use up the eggs from our chickens. Love it.

This was not at all like I expected. I used a 9x13 and it was over an inch thick (and dense) in the middle. Seems like there are about 2x too many eggs.

This recipe really needs to specify a pan size other than "medium," which is completely subjective.  I used what was to me a "medium" round baking dish and ended up with an inch of rubber in the middle because it was too thick.  I gave it four stars because I think it would have been perfect if I had used a large (bigger than 9x13") rectangular baking dish instead.

Brings back wonderful memories of my German Grandma. We used to switch between syrup, yummy home made blueberry, raspberry or strawberry and powdered sugar. Keeps it interesting that way.

I have made this recipe for years but I use 8 eggs and I use 3/4 of a cube of unsalted butter. Another way to make it is to snip 1/2 lb. of bacon into the bottom of your baking dish, put it in the 350 degree oven and cook it to your desired state of doneness. Then pour over the egg mixture and bake. Very good as well.

This reminded me of a cross between a popover and a Bickfords big apple. I put 1 cup of frozen blackberrys and a tes. of vinella and a dash of cinnemon. I omited the salt. Cooked it a little longer because of the frozen berrys. Next time I will put some sugar in also. This time I put powdered sugar on top. The berrys were also a bit tart "LOVED IT" my hubby wants whiped cream next time on top

Excellent as a sweet treat (add fruit) or as the main dish.  My mother used serve these with fresh asparagus and butter sauce.

Tip: Save left-over pancakes and cut into strips.  Add to vegetable broth to make a hearty soup.

Yes! We love german pancakes, I used to make this often when our kids were young.  Still do, we like it for dinner. It's fun to vary the ingredients to different flavors, like the comments suggest. A great regular in our house. =)

Delicious. I only tweaked the recipe to add flavor. Teaspoon of vanilla, one of sugar and some dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Turned out wonderful. Family over for brunch enjoyed it more than the fancy new waffle restaurant in La Jolla. Sautéed apples and added maple syrup to pan to warm up for topping. All gone quick!

These were yummy! I didn't have enough salt to add to the mix so I didn't add any at all and I added just a little bit of sugar as well.. It turned out very good but I think next time I will try one or two less eggs sense it was a little dense for my taste. I like my German pancakes a little fluffier than this but it was a hit with the boyfriend and roommate!

This recipe is fast and easy to prepare and cooks quickly. This is our family favorite. We usually cook at 400 for 20 minutes. Occasionally, for a twist I'll add a tsp of vanilla and a tablespoon of cinnamon. At Christmastime, I like to add nutmeg and cinnamon about a tsp each and serve with an orange syrup. For presentation, I will occasionally lightly dust plate with powdered sugar just to add a touch of "snow". You can also make this traditional and serve or add more savory ingredients in which case do not add the vanilla. The vanilla makes the egg dish more like a puffed pastry and sweeter in taste. Have fun experimenting. Make it plain and they live it just as much!!!

I used the calculation for 2 servings and preheated my 8 inch cast iron skillet in the oven at 400. Melted the butter in the hot skillet and added the pancake mixture which included a little bit of sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon. It was done in about 17 minutes...and gorgeous!!! I used to make these all the time as a kid...thanks for bringing back the memories~

Made this dish in a 9x11 pan, perfect size. I added 4 tbs sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg like others had suggested and the flavoring was perfect. The texture came out like a cheese, mozzarella, to be precise. Wasn't crazy about the texture but not a problem with the recipe, just my 'texture buds'. Might make it again, maybe next time as crapes so we can fill and roll them.

This is a family favorite in my house.  I love how easy and delcious it turns out everytime.  My little tweaks include:  adding 1 tsp vanila, 1 tablespoon flaxseed and I also bake in a 9x13 pan.

Great recipe if you cut the butter in half. I have made this twice; first time used 1/4 cup butter, 2nd time used 1/8 cup butter. The first time was super greasy and had a layer of butter across the whole when it was done (yuk!)Second time was delis!!

I have tried this multiple times. I did as some reviewers stated and decreased the amount of eggs. Really though I don't think you can go wrong. EASY and wonderful!!

This is so simple and taste good!  My family loves it! I sometimes use whole wheat flour instead.  It doesn't get as puffy but it is still delicious.

This was SO quick and easy to whip up, and it tastes great! As you can see from the pics I submitted, I added sliced chicken franks and chopped chives to make this a more complete b'fast item. Will definitely make more often for sunday brunch!

I gave this recipe only 3 stars because it was good but not great.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and they turned out to be something between pancakes and french toast.  The result did not justify the time and effort.  Sorry :(

This was so good! I added a tsp of Baking Soda to help with the rise and poured into the butter while it was hot. PERFECT! 

I can see this being used as a dessert: Add some fresh fruit in the middle with whipped cream.  (I would add some sugar to the batter).

I made this for breakfast yesterday.  The kids loved it.  I was a bit skeptical having a picky eater but yet she really enjoyed it.  Very easy, very good.  I did also add the sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.  This will definately be a keeper!  thanks

So easy and tasty!!  I read some of the other reviews and decided to add 2 tbsp of sugar, some cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla, and only used 2 eggs...I cut them in squares  and had them with a side of syrup to dip in... My 11 year old son loved this!  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family has been making this recipe since before I was born, I grew up on it, and I make it on weekends for my children.  We use the same ingredients and the same measurements, the only difference is that we omit the butter and scramble the batter (like scrambled eggs) in a skillet with a couple tablespoons of oil.  My grandpa tops his with honey but the rest of us like syrup.  :D

This is sooo good. My husband and I enjoy it sprinkled with powdered sugar and drizzled with lemon-butter. I also make it with less flour, about 1/3C.  Oh how I wish he would wait to start that diet! It would be supper tonight with bacon!

Any bad ratings for this recipe are totally unsubstantiated! If you want traditional pancakes then look for a different recipe. This one is the perfect German pancake, the way I remember it from childhood.

Wow!I can't believe I've been making this for all this time and haven't rated it! This is a fantastic recipe! It's THE recipe for German pancakes as far as I'm concerned, because I don't have to change anything! My ten year old cousin wants to rate this too: hello that stuff is soooo good! how did you do that well? I definitely rate it 5 stars!

INCREDIBLE recipe!  Very impressive when you take out of the oven because it puffs up (but does flatten after cutting/resting for a bit). SO much easier than pancakes!  I used two 9inch round cake pans to cook the recipe in, baking in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Also followed previous reviewers recommendation and added 4 T. sugar, 1 t. vanilla, and a dash of nutmeg.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar after I removed from the oven.  For big syrup lovers, you may want to cut sugar down to 2 T. as it was sweet enough for me without syrup.  Would be lovely with fresh fruit!  Thank you Bren!  You've saved my family from enduring any more of my failed traditional pancake attempts!

My husband loves german pancakes, he thought these were just ok.  I liked them, but it was a bit eggy.  We squeezed lemon juice and sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  If I make this again, maybe I'll reduce the eggs.

very easy hot breakfast in a busy family life. The kids ate it all up. lots of syrup. I recommend adding powdered sugar sprinkled on top. Any kind of jam works well too.

this is just like my aunt's recipe, except she sprinkled nutmeg on top as well.  If you make it in a blender it's easier.

Made this with Zafo's Mom's additional recommendations.  
1 tsp Cinnamon, 3 TBL Sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and only 2 eggs.  Came out great with the additional Nutmeg and Powdered Sugar on top right before serving.

We all like this, although the girls require more sweetness. I dust it with powdered sugar, then serve it with jam or syrup. As long as they get sweetness in every bite, they love it!

I added sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla as others suggested, and cut the eggs down to 4. I also baked it at 400 for 25 minutes rather than 30-40 at 350. This was my and my boyfriend's first time having this, and I'll definitely be making it again sometime. He commented that it reminds him of french toast but better. Thanks for the recipe!

Gotta say....this was WAY more batter that should go into ONE pan.  I used a large iron skillet and the bottom of this was more like a bread pudding without the bread.  I would definitely cut this recipe in half or use 2 pans.

I used the serving calculator to make 8 servings. It called for 8 eggs, the pan could not contain all of the ingredients. I used a 9x13 2.5 in pan and the pancake is well above the sides.

This is a great basic recipe to make and to play with. I substituted almond milk for the 2% milk (Hubbie is lactose intolerant.) And added a teaspoon of buttermilk powder to the egg/milk mixture. 
I think it would be very easy to make "sweet" by adding vanilla or even another type of extract like raspberry. I will do that and add my findings to this review. I am even thinking about a chocolate version cuz everything is better with chocolate!  I topped it with powdered sugar as soon as it was out of the oven so it would kind of melt on the pancake. I also lined my pan with parchment paper which made it come out of the pan with no problems.

I serve this with a generous sprinkle of powdered sugar and lemon wedges for a special breakfast. Slice some 
strawberries on the side, and add a few blackberries or blueberries.  Very pretty!  We have some individual cast iron skillets, which work great and are fun to use when we have guests.

This is one of the easiest breakfasts I've ever fixed. 5 minutes of prep (a little measuring and a quick whisk) and you have plenty of time to get started on your day without having to constantly stir or flip or tend to this simple meal. I added a spoon full of sugar to the batter and cut this in half. I used a pyrex pie plate and made this in a toaster oven. Sprinkled with lemon juice and some powdered sugar and it was a wonderful treat! I've tried German pancakes several times in the past and they never turned out well and this is the first time I actually had it puff up just right and taste good too! Thanks Brenna.

I sometimes make this with a dash of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg, then add two tablespoons of canned pumpkin pie 'slop'. It's very good, a subtle flavor that's great around October. Just use one less egg.

This was so good! I used 4 eggs as other reviews have noted. I enjoyed this. I also baked it with apples and cinnamon on the top. It was very good with maple syrup or whipped cream. Next time I want to try cooking raspberries or strawberries on top.

Followed other viewers recommendations of adding vinalla abstract and sugar...turned out great. Threw a little confectionery sugar on it and it was gone in minutes. By the way, squeeze a little lemon on it...you will be pleasantly surprised.

Made this for the first time for Father's Day breakfast.  I made a half recipe and put it in an 8X8 pan and put some fresh blueberries in it.  Also added some cinnamon and sugar as recommended in other reviews.  We loved it -- delicious and easy to make.

This was good.  Different than our normal "routine" breakfasts. The kids thought it was neat and ate it like a pizza. I added sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg and then sprinkled lemon juice and powdered sugar on top. No need for syrup!

My mother made this for me when I was a child. I loved it, the outside was crispy while the inside was nice and moist. She used lemon juice, and confectioner sugar. I still make it once in awhile for my wife and I. It is so good!

This is one of my families favorite breakfast meals and something I had never tried until I got married and my mother-in-law made it for me!  How I lived for 23 years without it I'll never know. ;o)  The only change I make is I use 1/3 cup butter because we like the buttery taste when we smother it in syrup.  It's a very versatile dish and is great with sauteed apples and cinnamon or fresh fruit.  Definitely one to try and keep on hand!

when I was a child, my mother made pancakes the size of a large skillet.  when on the plate we'd butter them and then roll them up like a cigar, then cut and put our syrup on.  I think she called them french pancakes.  does anyone have a recipe for that?

It was yummy. Like other reviewers suggested I added the cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. Then I topped with the powdered sugar.

Fantastic. Used a quiche pan and baked it at 400 for 25 minutes so it was pretty and delicious! Even my picky grandson like it.  I always saute fruit (apple and/or pears are good) in butter, added maple syrup and pour it in the middle of the pancake when the pancake is done.

Wasn't bad, but probably won't make again. It was extremely eggy ... I think I was expecting something a little different. When baked, there was thick "marbling" of egg throughout ... kind of quiche like in some ways. I tried mine with maple syrup, which made it better, but this recipe just wasn't for me. I gave it 4 stars because it came out well, I believe, just wasn't my taste.

I've made this for years and it is simply delish! You can make it in a round pan or even a rimmed cookie sheet. You can butter the dish or spray w/Pam. I never do the melted butter. HOWEVER, we serve it w/melted butter and powdered sugar (sometimes a lemon wedge as well, depending on the mood), foregoing the syrup entirely. We find that too sweet.

I have to eat gluten-free, so I used 1/4 cup gluten-free all purpose baking flour, 1/2 cup milk, 1 Tb butter and 3 eggs.  The pancake bakes perfectly at 425 degrees in 18-20 minutes (feeds 2).  We've made this multiple times with variations using cinnamon, cocoa powder, honey, or pumpkin pie spices baked in, which are all fabulous options.  Maple syrup is our favorite topping.

I usually don't like German Pancakes, but this morning I added 1 t. vanilla, 1 t. cinnamon, a few shakes of nutmeg, and 1/4 t. allspice and they were DELISH! Also, I know it sounds gross, but they're even more amazing topped with fresh rasberries and maple syrup

I added 4tsp sugar, 1 good dash of cinnamon, and some vanilla, and it was delicious! I also took the suggestion of putting it in at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and it came out perfect. I will definitely make this again!

You really need to specify what type of baking dish is medium sized. I should have just made a nice omelette instead. But, for some odd reason, I decided to make this. What came out of the oven was a nasty, doughy, butter-saturated mess. When I put it back in numerous times to see if all it needed was more time, it never cooked thoroughly. After an hour and a quarter, I gave up and threw it away. Advice: use the eggs for something else. Or just make a normal pancake.

I would have actually given this recipe a 4 1/2 if I was able to.  It's like french toast without the annoying pan flipping, and without the bread.  This recipe makes enough for my fiance and I.  My only problem is that I can't seem to get the batter to mix properly.  I've made this a few times in various orders (starting with the directions listed in the recipe) and it's always incredibly lumpy.  Every single time I've had to use a seive to get out the chunks.  I've also made this is dfferent pans (9x13, 8x11, and 2 9x9 pans).  I prefer using 2 9 in. square pans.  I've used syrup on mine, as I would french toast, but I plan to try lemon and powdered suga next.  I don't know that I'll ever go back to regular french toast again.

We love this on weekend mornings!  It is just as tasty and impressively puffy as our family's Dutch Babies recipe, but easier to make.  Great with a dab of fruit preserves or lemon & powdered sugar.

To be quite honest, although I thought this was very good, it was nothing like a pancake; it tasted more like just eggs and somewhat had the consistency of a custard or pudding. It could be that I was short of an egg and had to substitute that with a mixture of cornstarch and water... although I doubt that would alter the consistency of it that much. Anyway, don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this. It was just that it came out different than I was expecting. I guess that's a German "pancake" for you!

This was very good.  I followed previous suggestions of adding 2T of sugar, dash of nutmeg, and teasp of vanilla.  Then sliced bananas over and made orange sauce w/2T. butter,3/4c. powdered sugar,1/4 c. orange juice, and 1T orange peel and heating through on low.  I strained sauce before spooning over top for a lighter taste.  Yummm!

I sweetened/spiced, per others' suggestions.  Good, but not great.  I'd still make it again, but I wouldn't call it an all-time favorite.  

Two things to add: 1) I didn't remove it from the pan right away, and it began to stick.  Next time I'll serve ASAP; 2) I would definitely not call this six servings--unless you're serving lots of other stuff for breakfast.  It served 2 adults and 2 kids--but we could have eaten more!

This is fantastic!  It's not at all like a pancake; it's more of a cross between a crepe and french toast.  I  modified it a bit: I added 1 t vanilla; a dash of freshly grated nutmeg; 2 T sugar and 2 T molasses.  (Next time I'll try a pinch of cardamom and cinnamon as well.)  I served it with a fresh berry syrup and a side of pomegranates -- a simple but elegant meal.

I'd give this ten stars if it was possible.  I am the worst pancake maker.  I usually burn them, or the other extreme, are under cooked.  These are so easy!  No flipping, no guessing if they are done, no smoking up your kitchen.  Just pour the batter in the pan and 40 minutes later, the most wonderful pancake that that tastes somewhat like a french toast without the bread.  Enough to feed my husband, myself and my 2 kids (4 and 3) A definate keeper!  Thanks Barb in BC canada

My mother used to make a similar recipe, and she baked it in two metal cake pans.  So I divided the butter and the batter in half and made two round pancakes, and they tasted great.  I baked at 375 degrees for 30 minutes.

I am one of those people who can't just leave a recipe alone. I added a little vanilla and poured into muffin tins. I also didn't measure the salt. Still, the recipe works great the way I used it. I did overfill some of the muffin cups, but I don't think I can lay the blame for that on the recipe. . .
Can I?

This was my first time baking, and even tasting, a German pancake. It reminds me of popovers. Mine came out buttery, but I used a glass baking dish instead of an iron skillet, so that could be why. I used this recipe as a guide and base start, with the following changes: I added about 2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp sugar, and whole grain flour. I baked at 425 for 23 minutes (glass 9x13ish dish). I then topped it off with sauteed apples (you can find great recipes here). Very delicious! Next time, I'm going to cut down a bit on the butter and try an egg or two less to see how it comes out. 

I've read to put leftovers in an airtight container and in the fridge, with it keeping up to 3 days. To re-warm put in the oven for a few minutes. I'll be doing this tomorrow morning!

I'd add a picture wth my review, but the app keeps freezing when I do that.

I've made this recipe several years in a row for Christmas morning in cast iron pans. I didn't change a thing except for the type of butter used - salted Kerrygold - delish!  For the top, I make a blueberry lemon sauce frozen blueberries, lemon zest, lemon juice and powdered sugar. The sweet and tang contrast nicely with the salty richness of the pancake. It's a favorite of all family members.

Perfect recipe and so easy.  I used an 8 x 14 baking pan and  very lightly greased sides of pan so pancake could rise and be fluffy.  Greased bottom of pan so wouldn’t stick.

I made this recipe for breakfast this morning. I was the only one who ate it, and it was only good for a little bit. It was eggy and the texture was rough, almost like clay. I did not enjoy this as much as I hoped and neither did my family.

I have made Dutch Baby for years. I add vanilla to mine for the extra flavor and for my husband and I make individual servings in the Handlers. 
What bothered me here is that though I am GERMAN the Dutch Baby has never been German. Dutch does not mean German but Dutch as in Holland.... My German relatives have taken the recipe home and make it in GERMANY for anyone that wants to try it and they rave about it. My recipe is far simpler though. For every egg, use 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup milk. Butter is important as it helps the batter puff.

I made this for my dad who generally doesn't like sweet things but he LOVED this. did make some adjustments though (some taken from the reviews here) because the first time I made it they weren't as fluffy and stuck to the bottom of the pan.

adjustments:
-made sure the eggs were at room temp
-added a pinch of cinnamon
-used half a stick of butter
-cooked in 12x14 pan @ 450F for 20-25min
-topped with fresh fruit!

These are pretty common ingredients so I didn't even have to go shopping. Huge. Really, really good dipped in maple syrup. I'd recommend adding a little sugar (2-3 tbsp.) to the mixture and using a smaller pan. This makes for more crispy stuff and that is truly where it's at.

I Used Cracker Barrel Pancake Mix as I did not have plain flour I used more milk and  that help with leavening in the mix ~ it set very nicely~ and did brown to a golden finish~ I put fresh berries on top during the last 5 minutes of baking (oh by the way I did increase the cooling time by 10 minutes and added a few drops of vanilla extract~ Baked in Cast Iron Skillets that belonged to my great grandmother~It was a hit with the family ~some used maple syrup some did not. Try It!!

It was bland and the texture was very unappetizing. It maybe had too many eggs? It was like everything separated. It had a crust on top and then a gelatin goo in the middle. We dumped buttermilk syrup on it which sort of helped but my kids didn’t want to eat it. Won’t be using this recipe again.

Great recipe as written, the only addition I made was to add a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon of ground cloves....tastes like I remember the restaurant in Potsdam making.

Served with sour cream and a pear compote as I didn’t have any apples.

Top Shelf!

I cut the recipe in half for 3 of us and made it in a large cast iron pan. I also sprinkled on a bit of cinnamon. Served it with blueberries and/or unsweetened applesauce and some squirt on whipped cream. (WW points w/o whipped cream=4)

We made this for lunch for our family get-together after Thanksgiving.  I made a big batch and made one very large one and a smaller one.  Everyone loved it.  We squeezed fresh lemon on it and dusted it with powdered sugar and it was a huge hit.  I'll definitely be making this again.

So simple and tasty! I added a bit of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I thin sliced 1 apple and placed on batter before oven. I didn’t have a cast iron pan big enough, so used 9x13 Pyrex. It came out great.

Instead of all purpose flour I use gluten-free pancake mix. (Tried various brands, all good). My kids love it.

Ah, just like my childhood! So happy to make for my child and hubby - they loved it! I took all recommendations: 4eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, tablespoon of sugar, melted butter in a large skillet until sizzling, poured batter and baked at 450 for 20 min - perfection! Topped with powdered sugar and some berries.

Has become a staple on nights I’m just by myself and don’t feel like cooking a meal. I usually add lemon butter and fresh raspberries when I’m about to eat a piece

wonderful, and so much fun to watch them bake.  You can bake them in either a cast iron skillet (pre heated and well buttered) or a glass pie plate, well buttered.

This is now a family fav!  I tried the recipe without modifications and I liked it but my children thought it was too, "eggy" (peasants!).  So I did modify it using only 2 eggs and I added 3T. white sugar and increased the butter by 1 T.  It was a hit with the kids.  I dressed it with a pink grapefruit compote....YUMMO!  Thank you, BRENNASPITZ for sharing this wonderful bit of your childhood.

I've always loved German pancakes and these are delicious!  I added 1t vanilla and about 1-2T sugar to the batter though. :)

Perfect! I reduced the recipe and used 2 of my individual blue cornflower casserole dishes. They turned out perfect. This has always been a family favorite and now as empty nesters we can still enjoy them. We each get a small one of our very own. Our Saturday morning tradition lives on.

Fantastic!! I used the suggestions of others and added some sugar and vanilla. Divided between two pie plates and baked 20 minutes at 400.  Myself and two young daughters loved it!! Served with fresh berries and sprinkled powdered sugar.  Will become a standard for us - thanks for a great recipe!

No substitutions or any changes. While making this, I realized that the pancake was one big popover due to ingredients. I make popovers all the time and this recipe, and others like it, is just one big popover instead of six.

This recipe is way too bland as is.  I add a tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, a tablespoon of ground flax, a tablespoon of Chia, and I cut the flour to 3/4 cup and add a tablespoon of Bob's Red Mill whole wheat flour.  Finally I add a 1/2 cup of blueberries and 1/2 cup of strawberries.  It looks beautiful, tastes great with plain yogurt and maple syrup and is a lot healthier to eat.

I've tasted this German pancake before and fell in love with it RIGHT AWAY!!! the taste is amazing and it spell so good. it's like a flat chewy version of a flan to me. It tastes better with confectioners sugar on top after finished baking! I'd definitely try this recipe this again!

This is how it's supposed to be made. I've been making the same recipe for my kids for 10 years. When it's done we dust it with powdered sugar, then lemon juice, but syrup is delicious too! Great recipe!

Delicious and easy and fast for a great weekend breakfast. Used casserole  dish which made it thicker than a 9x13 would have but still was fully cooked at the recommended time. Put a mix of milk, powdered sugar, butter and a few drops of lemon essential oil on it as a syrup. Heavenly.

I found this recipe about a year ago and it has become a regular dish for my family. It's great for breakfast but is a great "breakfast for dinner" meal as well. I make 3 easy additions to this recipe, 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1 tsp each of cinnamon and vanilla.  I think it tastes a lot like french toast but so much easier to make because you just throw it in the oven and don't have to stand over the stove flipping each slice one at a time. You can eat it as is or add pancake/maple syrup or fresh fruit along with a side of sausage or bacon.

I cook at 350 - but for only 20 minutes - so the middle is still soft.

I grew up eating German pancakes having been born there. Not having had these in years brought back fond memories. As a final topping, instead of using syrup, try using a little melted butter, lemon juice slightly sprinkled on top with a little powdered sugar to finish. Looks great and I think the taste is out of this world. Thanks for the recipe and the fond memories of having  these growing up!! :)

Awesome base. Added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tbsp sugar. Served with blueberries, strawberries, sprinkled tiny bit of icing sugar on top. Kids loved it. Served our family of 5.

I love these! I don't care for "flapjacks" but I love these. Only difference I do, which is why I only gave it a four star rating, is I add one teaspoon of vanilla. You can add any additional spices you want, as this base recipe can't be beat.

Added baking soda to fluff it up a bit, and vanilla extract goes into every bread I bake. Love this recipe. My wife and I ate the whole thing by ourselves, in one sitting.

I did take the suggestion to add 1st of cinnamon and 1st vanilla. I gave this a 4 not a five because it was a little to eggy .  I'll make it again with 3 eggs. I also took 1 tablespoon of red raspberry  jam and heated it with some maple syrup.  This went really well on it.

I really like eggy pastries, so this is delicious to me. The "pancakes" taste a lot like cream puff shells. I've made this recipe four times and never felt the urge to change anything. I would never want to add sugar. Instead, I serve it with maple syrup or, in today's case, fresh huckleberries.

I am totally impressed with this recipe. My sister used to make these and I really loved them, but after we grew up, I lost her recipe. This was exactly how I remember them. I did end up adding 3 TBS of sugar and 1 tsp of nutmeg. They added a great flavor. I'm planning on making these again soon.

I doubled this recipe. I added 6 tablespoons of sugar about 2 tsp of vanilla, 1 tbsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. It's tastes good, but it's very dense. I've never had a German pancake so I don't know if that is how it's supposed to be. Thanks for the recipe.

It tasted ok, but did not look right. Kids ate the whole pan so that was a plus. I followed the recipe with some of the suggestions from Zafo's Mom review (cinnamon, sugar, butter, and 9x13 pan). Maybe next time only 3/4 cup of flour. Very quick and easy to make.

This did not create a bowl look like the German Pancakes my mom used to make. I halved the recipe and baked it in a metal pan. I never remember my mom using this many eggs.

This is been a standard in my family for as long as I can remember. I had lost my grandmothers recipe, but here it is! I hate when people make changes to the recipes in the reviews, but I did because I remember some of how my grandmother did it.  I added vanilla and made it in a 9 x 13 glass baking dish. 425° oven for just under 20 minutes. Sprinkle lemon juice over it when it's done, then spread on strawberry preserves and a little powdered sugar. Yum! Huge hit!

Pretty good, basic German pancake recipe. I like to add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and sometimes some sugar.  When done they are great topped with melted butter, powdered sugar, and lemon or fresh berries!  I also cook mine in a cast iron pan at 400 degrees F for about 10 minutes.

So good.  I did add 4 TBS sugar and tbs Vanilla.  And cooked it in a 9x13 pan (it would overflow a smaller one).  Served it with a simple homemade strawberry syrup, and it was a hit!

This was great.  Cut the recipe in 1/2 and reduced the butter to 2 Tbsp and baked it in a cast iron skillet.  Served it with powdered sugar and grape jelly.

I added 1/8 tsp Vanilla and 1/4 tsp cinnamon also.  All the cinnamon rose to the top and made a beautiful crust.  We topped with Maple Syrup and it is very similar to an eggy french toast!

I LOVE this recipe! My husband loves it too! These German pancakes are delicious. I substitute 1/2 cup spelt flour for 1/2 of the all-purpose flour (1/2 spelt flour + 1/2 cup white all-purpose flour). The spelt flour gives it a nutty flavor. I dust with powdered sugar when it is finished baking and serve with pure maple syrup. It makes a FANTASTIC breakfast.

When I followed this exact recipe, I ended up with a very dense pancake. Wasn't at all like the german pancakes I use to eat. 
But with a bit of tweaking, it's turning out great. 
And I don't know if it's implied that you split this recipe, but even by reducing some of the ingredients, I end up making 4 1 cup mixture pancakes. 
Here's what I do : 3 eggs, 3/4 cup flour, 1 cup milk, dash of salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 2 tablespoons sugar. 
Melt the butter in a cast iron skillet in the over (about 3-4mins) then bake a 1 cup portion of the mixture for 11-13mins at 400 degrees. 

So good base recipe, but definitely suggesting adding vanilla extract at minimum. If husband like cinnamon/nutmeg, I'd probably be putting that in there as well.

My family makes this recipe all thr time! But we bake it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes. So it bakes a lot faster. We also eat it with powdered sugar. It is a great way to start out the day!

Made this just as the recipe directed before rating and reviewing (always rate and review before suggesting changes) As directed this is a fantastic recipe. LOVED it. I will tweak it to my family tastes by adding bacon or such. BUT as is the recipe is simply divine and easy to make. My teenage boys want to make this they saw how easy it was for me to make it. THank you for posting a great recipe.

It's pretty good.  We've used this recipe a few times, and we'll continue to use it.  However, we do add 2 tbps of sugar, some cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla.  That helps it a lot!

I make these quite often and they are fantastic!  We squeeze fresh lemon on them and then sprinkle powdered sugar before enjoying.  It's a light breakfast with lots of protein that fills you up and keeps you going.

i loved this recipe!!!! i changed the serving size down to 4 and followed the recipe. I did change it however by adding a 3 tablespoons of sugar,1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and  1 tablespoon of melted butter. i also put all the ingredients in a blender instead of mixing it by hand in a bowl.

 The key point is to make sure that all ingredients are at room temperature and to use a cast iron pan. ( make sure you heat the pan in the oven while your prepping the batter)

i sprinkled powdered sugar, served with stawberries and chocolate syrup.

everyone loved it! 

i would definitely make this again soon.

I love this simple and delicious recipe. I used Becel instead of butter and a 9x13 glass baking dish because that's what we have at home. It grows pretty high, but retracts a bit while cooling. I think syrup is plenty sweet so adding more sugar and spices is not my preference. The contrast between the buttery pancake with a texture similar to a Yorkshire pudding and the sweet maple syrup is delicious. I even ate it plain.

I've been making this for a few years, but this recipe is easier than what I have been using. I did melt the butter in a large oven-proof skillet before adding the batter & I allowed it to cook on the stove top 1 min before putting it in the oven. Also cut back to 4 eggs and added 1/4c sugar, some cinnamon, & nutmeg. Squeeze a fresh lemon over the top & sprinkle with powdered sugar. So easy & so DELICIOUS!

The first time I had these was at Village Inn Rest. here in Tampa, Fl., I had them with apples inside. The server would fold them at the table. I have made them at home but at 450 degrees and using a medium skillet heated in the oven until very hot.           
Really love them!

For those of you that it didn't work for, try these few tips.  Bake at well pre-heated 400 for 20 minutes instead.  Melt 5 tbs of butter in 9x13 pan (I place butter in pan in oven while I blend the rest), and make sure ingredients are well blended in blender.  Hope it helps, for some reason this site changed some of my original temps and measurements.  BRENNASPITZ

This was great, I did ad the cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla as suggested by others.  I cooked this in 2 well seasoned skillets @ 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Turned out great and recipe made 2 german pancakes.  I put the skillets in the oven and let them get hot while the oven is preheating

I serve these with butter, sprinkles with confectioners sugar and drizzled lemon juice over it. Yummm

This was pretty good! I cooked it a little longer than 40 min. The middle egg-y part was rather soft, so I left it in to firm up a little more. Don't underestimate how much it will rise when you put it in. Give it plenty of room...it will rise much above the dish (I used a average square pyrex dish). Tasted great with syrup...the corner and edge pieces taste the best, imho. :) I cut it into a bunch of squares to make it easier to serve. It tastes like a cross between scrambled eggs and pancakes...great breakfast food!

I thought this was a quick and easy alternative to normal breakfast. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added some cinnamon, sugar and vanilla extract as well as mashed banana. It was a winner! The only thing I would do next time is double the batch to make the batter thicker. It comes out very thin in a 9x13 dish. I think adding apple instead of banana would also make it very delicious.

Very good with syrup and Powdered sugar.  Feel like it could have more flavor though.  Not sure what can be changed though.

I am half German, and I love these pancakes, made them for the grandkids and they loved them, as a matter of fact, the granddaughter hates pancakes, will not even try them, but she ate these!!  And had seconds, you should have seen the parents face when her brother told them that she ate pancakes at Nahnies house, and that she ate seconds!! Thank you so very much, this rocks!!

Very good.  I cooked it as is with no expectations of what a German pancake is.  It was similar to french toast, but not "too eggy" or "thick" as some others described.  It did raise a good 2-3 inches above the edges of the baking dish.  Looked funny, but did not impact taste.  

Some children ate it with syrup, others with lemon juice and cinnamon sugar.

I've never tried German pancakes before so I had no idea what to expect. I only thought they were ok -- too eggy for my taste.

Yum!  I just discovered these recently & we love them.  I like this recipe because the pancake was more dense than another recipe I was using.  I've made them following the recipe exactly & also adding 1t cinnamon, 1t vanilla & 2 T sugar, too.  They're both good.  Although, I have gotten better results warming the eggs in hot tap water for a few minutes & warming the milk slightly.  I also bake it at 400 for 25 minutes in a cast iron skillet.
I skipped the syrup because we like these best with butter & confectioners sugar.  Great recipe!

A family favorite!  We use only 2 T. butter, whip batter with beaters or blender, then bake at 425 for 20 minutes.  Serve with lemon juice and powdered sugar!  Yum!

This is the perfect brunch food. Works equally well with syrup or sausage and hash browns. Super easy to make. I did notice mine starting to rise more on one side then the other so I turn the dish half way through cook time. Some women at my work were doing an little int'l food day so I made this.  It didn't last 10 mins and I had 10 requests for the recipe.  Half of them made it that weekend for their families and they all loved it. My teen son made it for me and then ate half of it. Truly great.

Wow!
I love German pancakes! I still have them, and had them when I was a child, well, im still young, but I don't really know the recipe very well off of the top of my head, but the VERY best, is if you have fresh butter (homemade or store bought), homemade maple syrup & optional powdered sugar or whipping cream with fruit.

This is a familiar and loved recipe in my house. My best friend's mother used to make this for sleepovers, and it brings back lovely memories. I use 1/2 whole wheat flour, and the texture is still great!

I wasn't exactly sure what this recipe was supposed to be but we tried it anyway.  It was a weird combo of egg and flour.... I thought it was ok with syrup, but my boyfriend said I better stop trying new "concoctions" for breakfast!

I learned this recipe years ago when studying German, but lost it. I started looking around and happened upon this one. I'm thrilled, it's just as I remember it! I added a tsp of vanilla to the batter. Drizzled my portion with a little honey and my husband ate his with powdered sugar. Thanks for the recipe, Bren!

I wished that I had put a litte less egges than the recipe suggested. It wasn't so bad, but for me it tasted nothing like pancakes that I used to know and expect. more like bready fritta? So, I guess it's German style?

tasty recipe but I was surprised that the edges rose 4 inches above the side of the dish! though I baked it on the center rack the edges got a little too brown because they were so close to the heat. love the versatility of the different topping options.

Served this one to company, and everyone agreed it was a keeper.  Served it with two different fruit toppings: caramelized bananas and a spiced apple compote, which can be made ahead of time.  I really want to try also with berries or with the powdered sugar and lemon juice.  Very easy to serve guests...and delicious!

Somewhere I read a review of German pancakes (aka Dutch babies) that explained that they are not meant to be eaten plain, but are to supposed act as a "bowl" for fresh berries.  I did follow some of the other reviewer's suggestions to add some additional flavoring (and one of my children loved this eggy-type pancake with nothing but syrup) but in my opinion, it was best with powdered sugar, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, and fresh raspberries.

Very good and true to the flavor I remember from childhood.  It didn't puff as much as my mother's recipe, but everyone enjoyed it!

I lost our family recipe and this one resembles it the most. I do recommend adding sugar (1/4 cup) and maybe some molasses. This is a great way to incorporate protein and still enjoy the feel of a pancake. Great Sunday morning treat.

I halved the recipe in a 9 inch pie pan and it came out great. I added the sugar and vanilla that everyone recommended.

Very interesting...with mixed reviews.  Not what I was expecting (not that that is a bad thing).  I sprinkled some nutmeg on the top (before cooking), which we all liked.  They have a custardy texture, but aren't sweet.  I think if I were to make these again, I might experiment with adding sugar to the recipe.
