Good way to mix it up.  It was also a good way to save room on the table (only having 1 dish for potatoes & stuffing).  It was lacking flavor, so I addd some spices to the bread ie; thyme, sage etc. and some butter & garlic to the potatoes.  Good space saver Bonnie!

This is an old polish recipe for stuffing on Thanksgiving.  Pototoes were abundant and my mother-in-law made this recipe for the holidays years ago.  Thank you for posting it... it brings back many good memories.

Will definitely make again! I was looking for my husbandâ€™s family recipe when I found this. Closest thing, always turns out great! I use what ever Italian seasoning I have, or Italian sausage.
