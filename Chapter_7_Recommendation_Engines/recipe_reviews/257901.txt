This recipe helped me win a cook off. Follow the recipe but for best results add a pinch of salt before you put it in the crock-pot

I had a leg of lamb with no bone.  It was frozen for 3 months.  After a good thaw and a 8 hour  slow cook with this recipe, I was in heaven.   I added lime juice with kosher salt instead of lemon.  I will make this again
