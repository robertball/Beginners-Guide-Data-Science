If you like artichoke, you will love this soup! It's pretty thick, but not too rich. The other vegetables & spices give it the perfect flavor! I left out the sage and I didn't measure the vegetables so I probably used more than 1/2 c of each. I used a stick blender and left it a bit chunky. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I made this yesterday. Great flavors! I used rehydrated shiitake mushrooms as that's all I had. Still good, although next time, I would use something milder. I would make this again, but probably add more broth as I like my creamed soups a little thinner. Overall, very good. Thanks.

So, I have some ammendments to this recipe after making it a few times for friends w/ diet restrictions - this weekend, i only had 2 cans of artichoke for this recipe - and I dbl'd the veggie's and spices.  I thought it was WAY BETTER.  Still super artichokey, but was more diverse in flavor.  Also used half heavy whipping cream and half soy milk - didn't turn out as thick like a dip, but was still creamy.

gluten/dairy free option!  use 3 tblsp diluted cornstarch instead of flour - use soy milk instead of whipping cream.  worked great!

It was good. We definitely used it as a dip instead of a soup though, it was great ON crackers instead of putting crackers IN it. :-)

I enjoyed this soup. Love artichokes. The artichokes I used had a lot of pith so that was a problem.. be careful what kind you select! Not the recipes fault. I used greek yogurt instead of whipping cream.. yum

Delicious!  I added a can of cannelloni beans for protein and added creaminess. I substitute coconut unsweetened milk for the heavy cream- and decreased the broth which worked perfectly for me. I made sure to watch the thickness and added the milk a little at a time. Love it!

This was ok, a little tart for my kids and my husband. I liked it with bread dipped in it. I won't make it again because my family didn't love it.

After reading the reviews, I tweaked the recipe a bit.  I did not use cream and I did not puree the veggies.  I used the food processor to chop everything first, except for the mushrooms.  It eneded up being just a hearty chunky soup that was delicious.  I would definately make it again.

I think 1/2 of the lemon juice specified.  And at least 50% more artichokes...

So yummy! I love artichoke and this is perfect for my bitter iowa winters. I don't have a nice blender so I ate it chunky, and I still liked it!

I add the liquid from the artichoke cans to thin out this soup.  It's my favorite soup!

I really liked this soup.  I tend to prefer thick soups, so the consistency was great.  I did double the carrots and mushrooms and added spice.  I will definitely make it again.  Think of topping with croutons.
