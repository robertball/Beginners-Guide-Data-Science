Delicious.  I halved the recipe but not the amt. of bacon.  I would even add a bit more.  Also, I would use medium sweet potatoes rather than lg. as well as med. white potatoes.  I would definitely make it again.

This recipe had me worried once I started actually making them,  it seemed a little over the top with taste but it was delicious!!  Over cooked the potatoes a little but it was still really good!

Very good! I decreased the recipe to 6 servings, but increased the bacon to 4 slices. I actually enjoyed this more cold than I did warm, but either way is good. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to leave out the red onion because I didn't have any, but followed the recipe other than that.  It was good warm, but it was great cold!  The flavors really had time to meld, and I don't think that it needed the red onions after all, it was "oniony" enough.  Next time I make this I'm going to try it with just the sweet potatoes ,yummy!

This was very good.  I served it the next day out of the frig. and it was good that way also, although I think it would have been better warm.  The only change that I made was I added at little bit of sugar.
