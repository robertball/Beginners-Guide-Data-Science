The chocolate flavor of the Ghiradelli chocolate chips I used produced a great deep, rich chocolate flavor, however I was disappointed that the Irish Cream flavor was negligible.  The truffles were smooth and yummy and everyone enjoyed them.

The only reason II gave this 4 stars is because I needed to add more Irish Cream. The flavor (using this recipe) is too faint. Other than that, it was delicious. All my giftees loved it.

I tried it today. And as Darlene has said, I had a real hard time getting it to set and shaping. Also the the irish creme got lost in the chocolate. Was not able to tell the ingredient was in there. I too will make it again maybe but will have to  experiment with some miner changes as to cut down on the cream and adding  some extra liqueur

They taste very good but they didn't set up very well and we had a hard time shaping them into little balls.  I think I would make them again but would put them in the freezer for a bit longer before I tried to shape them.

Truffles did not set up well, they are soft and gooey.  At least they taste good.
