This is delicious! I loved that this dip already used reduced fat counterparts. I added some fresh ground pepper and a couple dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce but other than that, I followed the recipe exact. Next time I make this, I'll try this heated and see if it's just as good.

Made this dip for my husband's work potluck. Didn't have a food processor, but used a hand mixer for the cream cheese, sour cream, and mayo. Used all ingredients exactly as listed on the recipe and it was a big hit! Didn't even need to add anything else. It is perfect as is. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

I bought some really good spinach artichoke dip about a week before making this one which caused me to seek out a recipe.  I found this one and I think it really great.  The consistency is well balanced and it's simple to make.  The only thing I might change next time I make this is to process a little less (do more chopping with a knife and mixing) and maybe one less clove of garlic.  It's strong right after making but maybe it will tame down in the refrigerator.

Doubled the recipe. Perfect!Fabulous...
Im sure the original was even better but circumstances caused me to alter a little. Used one can of artichoke cause it's 3.50 for 14oz. Kept the juice and added it to spinach mix (called artichoke mix) in instructions.
Oh and of course salted and peppered to taste. (White pepper) I only altered for amount and cost. So follow the original if you can.

Delicious! The only change I made was to add a can of water chestnuts (chopped fine).

I love spinach dip. This adds an upgrade. I made it exactly like the recipe, except I added a can of heart of palm( such a great treat) and I added a little pimento (less than a teaspoon, maybe just a little taste) to the cream cheese. It was better than I expected. I served it on mini bagels, with different flavors of crackers, and with fresh vegetables. It makes so much and can be served so many different ways. I am now asked to bring my special dip to everyone's gatherings. I love it! Oh I did cut way back on the garlic. Maybe 2 cloves and very little salt. The cans of artichokes and heart of palm have sufficient amount of salt.I never thought about water chestnuts. What an excellent idea. I am definitely going to add that next time.

I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to the mayo/cream cheese/sour cream mixture. This is a very easy recipe and is really good.  I've made it twice and everyone loved it.

8 cloves of garlic was to much for my taste. Cut down on the garlic and it would be great. But my garlic loving friends enjoyed it.

I did make changes to the base recipe. First, I only used 1 clove of garlic and just grated it. I also grated the onion. Then I just mixed everything together in a bowl. I also added water chestnuts for crunch, but it was tasty without it. I honestly don’t know how 8 cloves of garlic could be used, it is strong with just the one, but I know that will mellow out as it rests overnight. Thank you for the recipe!

The orginal recipe calls for drained water chestnuts and wow too much garlic.   You might want to try roasting the garlic  if you have time!

I replaced the reduced fat ingredients with regular fat ingredients and cut the garlic amount in half. It increased the flavor and made it more palatable for our garlic sensitive friends. The dip didn't last very long.

I made this dip after reading all the reviews.  The only changes I made were reducing the garlic to 3 cloves and adding a dash of hot sauce.  8 cloves of garlic would have been way too much.  With the small changes I made, this is a real "go-to" dip for parties.  My guests gobbled it down in record time!!

Easy no bake spinach artichoke dip.  The recipe made so much but then I realized I had not adjusted the number of servings on the recipe.  I’ll definitely make this again!

Loved It! We are big garlic eaters so if your company is not, I would suggest half of the garlic, 4 instead of 8 cloves.

8 cloves of garlic seemed way too much so I used only 4. Next time I think I will use only 2 as the garlic seemed to overpower the other flavors.  I also added chopped water chestnuts as I like the crunch they add. Was still a very yummy dip.
