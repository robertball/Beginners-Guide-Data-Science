This is an amazing recipe.  By far my favorite one for fruit pizza.  I've been searching for one similar to this for a long time.  My aunt used to make one with a yellow cake mix crust.  I like it way better than the sugar cookie crust.  Love the homemade fruit glaze...Perfect finish to the pizza.

I love how easy the yellow cake mix cookie crust is. I didn't do the glaze since I was in a hurry. We used strawberries, raspberries, bananas, and blueberries. Very tasty.
