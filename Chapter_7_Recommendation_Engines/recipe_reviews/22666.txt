Even though people said they had gritty filling I thought I could make it smooth since I have a professional kitchen aid mixer. I beat this filling for about 15 minutes on the highest setting and scraped down the bowl every few minutes or so, it still came out gritty. It is impossible to get this smooth and gritty free doing this method, think of raw cookie dough but only with more grit. When I realized that this was as good as it was gonna get, I did go ahead and add more powder sugar and some flavorings which made it taste better, but it still was not enjoyable. I suggest if you want to use this recipe to use powder sugar instead of regular sugar and add some vanilla extra.

This is it!  I, too, added 1 tsp vanilla and filled a three layer dark chocolate cake (box mix) with this luscious filling and covered the cake with dark chocolate frosting (store bought).  This cake looked beautiful when cut and tasted even better. It disappeared!  There were no leftovers.  This recipe is not at all time consuming, it is the easiest filling I've ever made.  Just be sure to sift the confectioners sugar so that there are no little lumps and whip until all the sugar is completely melted into the shortening so that it is not all grainy.  Great recipe, Karen!

You do need vanilla in this.If it tastes "grainy", it hasn't been blended enough. It will be creamy if beaten long enough.Try this between 2 soft chocolate cookies. Alot like "Suzy Q's!!

Mine turned out great. I did make some changes, though. I used butter instead of shortening. I only added half a cup of butter. I used 2 cups of confectioners' sugar instead of white sugar. I also added a half of a tablespoon of vanilla extract, a dash of cinnamon and 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. I whipped it all together and stuck it in the refrigerator to set up. It turned out fantastic! My fiance LOVES it and if I'm not careful he'll eat it all.

I tried this recipe and it tasted awful.  All I could taste was the shortening. I tried everything to improve it, including adding vanilla. It looked like the creme filling you see in doughnut shops, but it definately didn't taste like it.

Overall this is a wonderful recipe, however I found it to be lacking vanilla extract.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and it was even better.  I also made a batch of this filling using a teaspoon of almond extract.  This recipe works wonderful for a cream filling in cream puffs.

I'm in Germany where they don't have icing like Duncan Hines so I made this up one night and stuck a spoon in it.  Ugh.  Not what I was expecting.  It tasted like sweet, gritty Crisco.  Added vanilla, still no dice.  Oh well, live and learn!  Nice look to it.

This is super easy and a little time consuming but overall ok. All the bad reviews of gritty must be using the wrong type of sugar. Confectioners sugar is POWDERED SUGAR!!!, not super fine or granulated. use the right stuff get the right results very easy

I made this twice, once with regular sugar and once with super fine sugar. Both times I let it beat in the mixer for well over an hour and the sugars never dissolved. The flavor is very much like doughnut creme filling but the texture is terrible. I'm sure there have to be better recipes out there for this type of filling and I will be trying a different one in the future.

I let my stand mixer go at this filling for almost an hour and the sugar didn't dissolve. Although the taste isn't bad the grittiness is a downside for me.  I was hoping a better outcome.  I will keep looking for a better creme filling  recipe.

I whipped and whipped this for the longest time and it was still very grainy. It tasted terrible, too...like sweet gritty grease.  Adding vanilla helped the flavor, but nothing could help the grainy texture. I added half a cup of boiling water and a bunch more powdered sugar. It wasn't much help.  I would steer clear of this recipe altogether!

My suggestion is to use superfine sugar and use the wire beaters on the upright mixers.

I tried this recipe with a bit of vanilla, as others have suggested. It was, as expected, tasty, but gritty. Reasoning that sugar does not dissolve easily in fats, I added up to half a cup of water. This helped, but most of the sugar was already coated in fat and so did not dissolve easily. So I made a simple syrup with the sugar, then wipped in the shortening. I hoped this would emulsify easily and without the sugar grit. It made a slimy mess until I added a tablespoon or so more powered sugar while it was in the mixer. That allowed it to mix into a very nice creamy filling. I'm very happy with the result, it's a versitile mix that can range from a kind  of thick creamy texture to a light fluffy filling. I'm storing some to see how stable it is and whether the gritty version, which is easier to make, will eventually smooth out on it's own. I'm looking forward to trying some other flavorings and ingredients.

okay..tried several ways and this is the best. Follow recipe, use i cup shorting, 3/4 cup or 1/2 cup white sugar , vanilla,two sticks of soft butter and 2 cups or more of powdered sugar..electric beater for a long time around 20 minutes..taste as you go. The crisco is what gives it a unique body, the powder sugar is after all regular sugar ground to a powder. Add powder sugar as you need it..I got enough to do a double deck cake, the flavor can be your choice, it came out real fluffy and will try to use it as a filling next time.

There has to be something missing from this recipe. I have been looking for a good, less-perishable,  pastry filling for cream horns and came across this one. It looked a bit odd, only 3 ingredients, and felt it would be gritty. However, I do not like to judge a recipe until I try it...  OMG! Gritty grease. No flavor, just grit followed by a greasy film. I use only top shelf ingredients (Crisco, etc.), so it is not my shortening.  Was this used in still hot pastries, where perhaps the steam inside melted the sugar? Are we supposed to whip the shortening with vanilla or butter flavoring to help add flavor and allow the alcohol to break down the fat?  Something is certainly missing. I hate to be judgmental, but this was bad... really bad.

If you have a grainy texture from the normal sugar try using beverage sugar instead. Beverage sugar falls somewhere between regular and powdered sugar in texture.

This is very similar to the "buttercream" recipe you might learn in a cake decorating class. Tastes alright, but pales in comparison to fillings/frostings made with real dairy products. Still, it does in a pinch, especially if your cake/donut/pastry can't be refrigerated!

This was a good waste of time and sugar.  Even whipping at high for several minutes, texture was still too poor for use.  Taste is also very bland considering the amount of sugar.

I too added vanilla;  I used unsalted butter for the shortning and used powdered icing sugar instead AND made it chocolate by adding a few teaspoons of baking cocoa.  My Phillips Mixer mixed it thouroughly yet I found some of the butter didn't blend well.  It tasted nice, though

I don't care what your expertise level.  You will never get the grit out of this unless you heat and melt your white sugar down first if you choose to use that as an ingredient.  Don't listen to the reviewer that tried to explain the difference between powdered and granulated sugar.  If you don't know that, you have more problems than any recipe on these pages can provide.  The taste is okay but you definitely need the 1/2 to 1 tsp of vanilla.  I made this recipe with the powdered sugar, shortening, and the addition of vanilla only.  If necessary you can add a small amount of water to get the right consistency.

i beat this stuff like it stole something for 15 minutes on the highest setting, and it was still gritty.  i will experiment with adding two cups of confectioners sugar and leaving out the granulated sugar altogether.

I was able to decrease the grit by adding a splash of water and mixing slowly for several minutes before whipping it. I just can't get over the greasiness. Its like it should have 8 cups of confectioners sugar not 1. Another recipe for holland cream filling on this site looks much more promising.
