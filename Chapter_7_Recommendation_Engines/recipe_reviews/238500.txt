Making foods that roll up always intimidates me. This one was surprisingly easy to do, although I would like to improve my technique so that I have a round pizza roll instead of oval. I used Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage and a Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust. Both were perfect for this dish. When I cut the roll, it appeared to be too bready, but when I tasted it, there was plenty of meat flavor that came through. While I am a die-hard Reynold's Wrap user, this was my first time to use the no-stick wrap. It held true to its name with nothing sticking and made clean up quite easy.

The recipe was such a delight to make. I ended up making a pizza dough verses a store bought one and it worked rather well. Nothing negative to say about the recipe, it was a winner and went rather quickly. TY

Delicious and easy, but I found the foil was just an added step I didn't need. Will just bake on stoneware in the future. Definitely do NOT use more sausage than the recipe calls for!

I loved the use of reynolds wrap but just didn't like the sauce, I think I will try it again with extra cheese instead, the family didn't love it but thought they would try again without the sauce!!

Spinach was a no go here so I changed up the filling slightly, using hot sausage, orange and yellow peppers mushroom slices and chopped broccoli.  The possibilities are endless.  Due to time constraints I assembled the rolls, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated until I was ready to bake them.  It worked perfectly.  The no stick foil made both the preparation and clean up a breeze.

Yum, yum, yum! This was a winner in my house. I made my own pizza dough, I added some extra spices and I served it with homemade marinara sauce too. This turned out soooo good! I love this non-stick Reynolds wrap as well. Nothing sticks to this stuff at all!

Great flavor!! I didn't have pizza dough on hand so used lowfat Crescent rolls instead. Dough was too thin to make ino a roll so covered with a second can of Crescent rolls, brushed the seams with egg, added slits for ventalation and baked. It worked great! Can't wait to try it with pizza dough and non-stick Reynolds foil.

This was a great way to make a quick meal and satisfy the need for comfort food!  The only thing I did different was to use a marinara sauce rather than the pizza sauce called for!  This was my first time using the non-stick foil, and I found it to be amazing!  Thanks for a great and versatile meal!

Great quick weeknight meal!  Easy to prepare with the refrigerated pizza dough --when you have more time homemade pizza dough would kick it up another notch!  Using the Reynolds Wrap® Non-Stick Aluminum Foil made cleanup a breeze, and the pizza rolls did not stick at all!

These are pretty darn good!   Although I chose to make my own pizza sauce instead of just buying a can of it, I think it elevated the recipe.   I made this exactly as written and my husband thought it was really good!   Because I LOVE CHEESE, I did sprinkle some over the roll before putting it into the oven.    The Pillsbury pizza crust had a few tears in it when I went to put it on the prepared baking sheet so I tried to "patch "them.   It didn't cause any problems though.   Nice recipe and the Reynolds Wrap non-stick foil worked perfectly!

Pressed for time, I made this as a pizza instead of rolls. Best pizza ever. Whole wheat crust was homemade, but frozen. Making multiple crusts at once is a great time saver. Portobello mushroom sauce and threw on some olives.

This was very good!  I will use olive oil on the cookie sheet next time as it did stick.  Overall very tasty!

This is one of my recipes from All Recipes, hands down! I like to use Trader Joe’s fresh pizza dough. I sometimes add pepperoni but otherwise keep everything as is. So so good.
