The cake was heavy and apart from being a big blob, it didnâ€™t taste good AT ALL.

I made this last night for breakfast.  My teenage daughter actually loaded this into our bread machine!  Liquids first, ran on cake setting.  I did add a 1/4 cup of craisins just to make it more breakfast-y.  I also used agave instead of sugar (in pregnant on a special diet that's not fun) same measurement.  It came out great!  Slices well, not crumbly, but fluffy and moist.  Would be good with just a little butter, powdered sugar, frosted, honey, cinnamon...  Very light flavor.  Perfect. Thanks!
