This was a home run! Made it for gifts (small loaves= less cooking time) then another batch for us. I used mixed fruitcake fruits, also cut down egg yolks to 3 and used margarine rather than butter. Canadian whisky instead of bourbon. Gets better every day.

My husband made this last Christmas and it's the best fruitcake I've ever eaten! We're making it again this time for Thanksgiving. Tho, we baked them in bundt pans and just followed the directions above. You can freeze them as well and thaw when you need to. They are just as moist and tasty as when first made. 
My dad used to order some from Texas for he and I to enjoy, but never again, this is so much better!

This is definitely worth the effort and time needed to complete. My grandfather made an amazing fruitcake and sadly that recipe was lost when he died. The only substitution I made to this recipe was that I used spiced rum instead of bourbon. I am excited this worked out so well and reminds me of my grandpa.

A labor of love for Father's Day.  I left off the 1/2c white sugar since all of my dried fruit was extra sugary.  I might even cut some of the brown sugar and then add a sauce on top.  A delicious cake!

It was much better after setting 48 hours. Still too rich in alcohol after 24. Only think I changed  was using a bundt pan and golden raisins instead of currants.
