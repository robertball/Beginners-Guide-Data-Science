I have made this recipe many times.  I use margarine instead of shortening.  On the top when you drop the rest of the cake mix try spreading with a spoon.  Just push it down so it is quite spread around the top.  Also just stir ingrediants until moistened.  EXCELLENT

This recipe is similar to one that was called "Killer Brownies".  When I make this recipe, I substitute Carmel ice cream topping for the carmels and milk mixture and it works great, plus it's easier to pour the carmel topping out of a jar than it is to unwrap all those carmels.

I usually use butter instead of shortening and pecans instead of peanuts, plus an extra cup of chocolate chips.  I make this in a 9/13 pan so I can have more of them.  They are always SO good!  Devil's food cake can also be substituted for the German Chocolate if that's what you have on hand.

Very Yummy Recipe!! It was fun making it and even more fun to eat them. I just replace the peanuts with almonds because it fits better that way. This is a great recipe for people who love caramel.

It would be reckless to make these if you are dieting. Temperance flew out the window after these were baked. They are irresistible. I used butter instead of shortening and a regular chocolate cake mix. Substituted coarsely chopped pretzels for the peanuts. After I poured the caramel over the chocolate chips I lightly sprinkled it with Sea Salt. Genius with the salty and super sweet. Thank you for sharing your recipe Daniel C as these squares are awesome!

IT is great., as is   I also add 1 c PB chips and it is devoured at work. ( Reminds all of snickers)In fact everyone loves it but said not to bring it too often  as no one can resist it.   My college-age DD and roommates love its much or more than co-workers.

Instead of the German Chocolate cake mix, I substituted 1.5c flour, 1/2c sugar and 3 tbsp Cocoa, and it turned out GREAT!

I bake a lot, but this recipe just didn't work for me.  It turned greasy - overflowed all over my oven and never set.  I used the right size pan, followed the directions (I did substitute a jar of caramel topping based on other reviews) but it just didn't come out.  I was afraid I was going to have to throw out my baking dish.  Maybe 3/4 cup is too much shortening?  Sorry - just didn't work for me.
