Great spread.  I actually combined this recipe with another.  I used the spread to put on a toasted pita, then added cucumers and bacon.  It was awsome!

Having never tried these before, I thought they were pretty good, if not a little bland.  Next time I will definitely be adding dill!!!

Literally one of the best things ever! I make this for every occasion where it will be even a little bit acceptable.   However, I do tend to alter the recipe just a tad, adding more of the garlic and Worcestershire sauce to taste.

I altered a bit but this was a great starting recipe.  I mixed worcestershire, fresh lemon juice, garlic salt, black pepper, and cream cheese for the spread.  Added fresh mint on each cucumber slice for a light fresh taste.

Awesome! I was craving cucumbers, but I was out of bread, so I used the sweet rolls I made earlier today. I wasn't sure how that would turn out, but the flavors together were amazing. I made the recipe as written, except for one *tiny* addition, dill. I just like cucumbers with dill.
This was so refreshing, and it so hit the spot. Thank you for sharing!

I made these for a brunch and they were a huge hit. I added an extra dash of Worcestershire and made open face sandwiches on party pumpernickel. Delicious, easy to follow recipe. It's a winner!

this came out very tasty.  cant wait to try it tomorrow after its sat overnight.  i followed other reviews and used a little less mayo, and then added a sprinkle of dill on top of the cucumber.  Made these for a "moms day" in our preschool room and they were a hit :)
i used onion powder and garlic salt, since thats what i had on hand and it worked out great

I added fresh chopped dill to the cream cheese and placed a small sprig on the top of each sandwich.  I also slice the cucumbers a little thicker than recommended because my guests prefer the clean crisp bite of the cucumber with the cheese.  I use a biscuit cutter, the size of the cucumber to cut out the bread.  I use a hand mixer to whip the cheese to make it lighter and use about 1/8 of cup of mayo.  I use English cucumbers because they have less seeds.  I use onion powder rather than onion salt.

I thought these were ok. They worked well for our tea party. I used wheat bread and cut the slices with a circle cookie cutter.  They looked great.  I added a dash of dill.  I wonder if a different type of bread would make these tastier.   My husband gave them a four.

This is the recipe I use for stuffed celery, with the addition of a small jar of chopped pimento in the filling. Even better with the cuke sandwiches!! Winner!!

I make this spread all the time in the spring and summer and everyone who's tried them has loved them. I use fresh squeezed lemon and go heavy on the flavoring. I often make it for day hiking as it packs well and makes a refreshing lunch. Goes great with a spinach strawberry salad.

Made this a while back after trying to get into a traditional English Tea at a prestigious national hotel in Victoria BC. When I discovered the formalities of English Tea, I was impressed, but when I also discovered the ridiculous price for what amounted to some Earl Grey Tea and cold sandwiches, I said no thank you. So, a while later I come upon this recipe: it looks easy enough; I have the majority of ingredients; and I wanted see what the fuss was about. I made it, we ate it, and we loved it.

This was my first time making cucumber sandwiches, and it was good. When I make this again, I'll either lessen the mayonnaise or omit it entirely. I like mayo, but it didn't seem to fit with the other flavors (I was using honey oat bread with this).  It's a nice, refreshing sandwich that I'll keep making!

Honestly, I would rather just leave out the mayo because I couldn't even taste the cream cheese. I really like cucumber sandwiches, but mostly because of the cream cheese flavor. I will leave out the mayo next time.

I've been searching for something reminiscent to the English tea sandwiches we had during tea time, abroad, for quite some time. To make it "proper," I used a petite pumpernickel loaf with the crusts trimmed, sprinkled each sandwich with dill and served them open face. My daughter really enjoyed it during tea time (something I still do, daily) & we'll be serving them at my tea party baby shower this coming weekend. Thanks for sharing!

I thoroughly enjoyed these, as did my friends. Lovely flavour. I didn't have onion salt so used celery salt instead. Worked fine. Next time, will try the onion salt. Would certainly make them again. Marg L.

Used a round cookie cutter, as close to the size of a large cuce(peeled and sliced thinly) followed the recipe exactly. Made 2 seving plates full. These little, cute sandwiches were GONE in a flash! They're cool and refreshing. Everyone was asking if there were any more! Definitely gonna make these again! Just A LOT more!! 2 thumbs up????

I have always wanted to try these little sandwiches. I would say it was good but not great. Seemed like a lot of bread and not a ton of flavor. I sprinkled some dry dill weed on the sliced cucumbers and I used onion powder cause that’s what I had.  I would not recommend making ahead of time.

Most of my family loves this, which is saying something.  I'm taking off a star because the recipe doesn't include dill.  I put a generous amount of dried dill in it.  With that, it is a 5 star recipe.

I substituted Onion Powder for the Onion Salt. Added a little lemon zest and dry Dill.

These were perfect!  Exactly like I had when I was in London.  To the person that said they were "American cucumber sandwiches", I have one question:  Don't you think the brits eat cucumbers, bread, cream cheese and seasonings??

This turned out great.  I did have to replace the onion salt with celery salt because I couldn't find the onion.  I used Rye Dill bread and sprinkled bits of dill on top.  My 25 yr old son actually asked me for the receipe.

This was easy peasy.  I used a hand mixer to blend which made it creamy.  I also added dill.  I made extra and put in jars for later use.

These were awesome!  I brought them to a reunion for my all girl high school.  I made 1 tray of gluten free and one regular.    I dusted the top with dill.  They looked and tasted great (not too heavy, distinctive clean taste, good texture)!

I have made this recipe 3 times and have rave reviews each time. I do add Dill to mine and leave out the Worcester sauce.

These were fantastic!! The only thing I did was use more than the optional lemon pepper seasoning...it was more than just a pinch. Other than that, I followed it as written. Went over great at my tea party. Thank you:-)

Very refreshing and a treat to the tastebuds. I used on wheat bread and ate as a lunch time sandwich. I literally crave these sandwiches!
