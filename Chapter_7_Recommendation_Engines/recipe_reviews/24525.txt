DO NOT MAKE THIS IN A 9x13 PAN!!!!! Use an 8x8 or you'll be sorry! Cake came out barely an inch thick------abundance of topping-hard to rate.....

I'd give this three stars as written but five with changes.  I have the same recipe but everything on this one is halved.  When you double your ingredients there is no need to double the eggs.  I always make mine with 2.  Also milk can be used in place of the half/half. Use 1 Tablespoon and 1 teaspoon baking powder.

After reading the first 2 reviews, I doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 cake. That was the only adjustment I made and the cake turned out fine.  Tender. Nothing extraordinary but yummy. My daycare kiddos liked it and asked for seconds.

I wish I had read the other review before I made this.  There wasn't enough batter to fill the bottom of the 9*13 pan, let alone make two layers.  I had to scrape it into a 8" cake pan and even then one layer was all I could do.  I only used half the streusel.  It did taste good, but there must be more accurate recipes out there.  (My son says he would rate it a four, but he didn't have to make it.)

I made this after reading the reviews and decided to make it anyway. I thought is was great. So did my mom, my fiance and his brother.  I suggest using 2/3 of the batter in a the pan suggested and dot the rest on top of the topping.  It was not thick and cakelike as a tradional "coffee cake" is, but this was lite and delicate like a "streusel" should be.  I have found a coffee cake recipe that i will always use.  Thanks!

This was a quick and simple recipe that was quite delicious. 
Make sure to use a 8x8 pan and i used milk instead of half and half. For shortening I switched with butter and used about a tad more than 1/4 cup. I make a lot of dessert which I always use butter over other product since it give dishes better taste and moistness if your not to worried over calorie :).

The taste was excellent. The recipe easy to follow. My only complaint was that in order to make a thick streusal cake we had to double the recipe. But thats easy. Great recipe. Will definitely make again and again.

Overall I thought this was a really good coffee cake. I made a few changes though. I doubled the recipe because after reading many other reviews saying it wasn't thick enough, I decided to go ahead and do it. I added a half cup of sour cream to make it more moist and used milk instead of half-and-half. I got lots of compliments and I will definately be making it again!!!

I don't usually review a recipe if it is under a 4, but I feel that this recipe could be much better if you substitute butter for shortening.   It is not quite so light, but has more body and a much better flavour.  Of course this is a personal preference.   Anyway, I will make it again with these changes and keep it in my files because it is a simple coffe cake very good eaten fresh.

I doubled the recipe as well as other reviews suggested.  For me, it was not that great.  My husband however loved it and he would probably have given it a 5.  He likes his coffee cake more dry and without sour cream so this was a big hit for him.

My family and I love this coffee cake! The cake is delightfully tender and flavorful. I substituted a little over 1/2 stick of butter for the shortening.
Also, I'm glad I read other reviews because this recipe will not fill a 13x9" pan well. I used a Bundt pan and that was fine. 
Did not last one day in my house! I will be making this again.

I'm quite happy with this recipe. I doubled it, used milk instead of half and half because that's all I had and no nuts because I didn't have any. It's very tasty, goes great with tea or coffee. It's just a simple, basic coffee cake. Just what I wanted.

I made this yesterday for brunch and doubled the cake ingredients.  It was terrible.  Should have doubled the streusel mixture instead.  Will never make this again.

I'm reviewing only the Streusel Topping, not the entire recipe. I was searching for a topping recipe to accompany some mini pear walnut spice cakes as a topping and using some of the streusel topping for a middle layer and topping on a pear walnut spice dessert bread. The topping was great. Easy, quick and had a good delicate flavor and nice balance of ingredients. It went great with my cake and was greatly enjoyed by all.

I AGREE WITH OTHER REVIEWS- Make this in a 8x8 pan! It would not be enough to fill a 9x13 after making it. Other than that, I was very pleased with how this recipe came out and it was absolutely delicious. Ours took about 30 minutes to bake all the way in the oven. I made it the night before, so the next morning I put my piece in the microwave for just 10 seconds and it softened it up and made it warm just perfect to pair with my coffee. I will be using this recipe again for sure.

Made this as per the recipe except used milk instead of half/half as I didn't have any. I did double the topping but ended up not using it all. Used an 8x8 pan and it rose to the top. I baked it for 30 minutes in a toaster over and it was a little overbaked. The taste was good, however, and I would make it again and would add the sour cream as others have mentioned to make it moister.  One problem I had was spreading the second layer of batter over the sugar/cinnamon layer because the batter was so thick. I'm sure adding the sour  cream would help that. Alternatively I would add more milk/half and half to thin it somewhat.

Five stars even though I apparently can't follow directions.  I put the entire streusel mixture in the middle, saved nothing for the top and it still turned out great.  Will make again, next time as written.

Excellent recipe, but when I looked at the amount of flour, I knew this wasn't going to make a cake big enough for the six people in my house. For my maternal grandmother, who taught me to cook, all recipes started with 2 cups of flour... it was the only thing she ever gave a definite measure for. So, like her, I started out measuring out those two cups of flour, then doubling that, and the rest of the recipe. I used three eggs instead of four. I used 3/4 cup of granulated sugar and 3/4 cup of Splenda, since I am diabetic, and I regularly convert recipes with sugar so that I can have my cake and eat it, too. LOL! I added about a half a cup of raisins and two teaspoons of vanilla to the cake. My only glitch was in making the streusel. Two tablespoons of butter was a bit too much, possibly because I used Splenda's Brown Sugar Blend to help shave off a little more of the sugar, and instead of being crumbly as it should have been, it was more of a paste; so I dropped it on to the batter in spoonfuls and swirled it into it like a marble cake. The texture of the final product was wonderful... soft inside , with just a bit of cookie like crunch to the outside. Even my son, who doesn't like the taste of Splenda declared it worthy of even his picky palate. All in all, a very taste-pleasing dish.

Very good. I liked that the ingredients were simple and didn't require a yellow cake mix,as so many recipes I looked at did. Is that a thing now? We also did not have sour cream on hand. My middle school aged son made this for a snow day breakfast and everyone wanted seconds. We did bake it in an 8×8 pan, as other reviewers suggested. Thanks for the recipe!

I was making this in a hurry for my daughter's class in the morning.  One look after mixing the batter told me it was totally off. This may well taste OK in the morning.

I am making this now.  After reading the reviews, I also used butter.  The other change I made is instead of half & half, I used liquid hazlenut coffee creamer.  I didn't have walnuts, so used pecans.  I did put it in an 8x8 pan.  Smelling pretty good.  OK - done and cooled a bit.  Yummy!
