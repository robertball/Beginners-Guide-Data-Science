Yay!  These were the best vegan cookies that I've found so far.  I did make a couple of minor modifications: 1) subbed milled flax seed for the chia seeds 2) used one half of the sugar 3) added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract 4) subbed coconut unsweetened yogurt for the coconut oil.  These will be made at our house a whole lot.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made these, and they came out amazing! I didn't have rolled oats so I just used instant oats and all it did was add a little more flavor to the recipie. Vegan or not, I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

These taste really good although I made some substitutions....
Instead of applesauce I used 1 lg. browning banana and instead of brown sugar I used 0.5 cup honey. Also I used spelt flour instead of regular flour and raisins instead of cranberries. Just be careful though...even with less sugar, these are still over 200 calories per cookie...

I was craving oatmeal cookies just to find this great recipe. Although I didn't have all the listed ingredients I took a chance substituting. I had only 1 tablespoon Chia seeds so added another tablespoon of Flaxseeds. Another main ingredient I did not have was Wheat Flour instead I ground 2/3 c. Bran Flakes. Instead of applesauce I cook and mashed ripe pears to make 2/3 c.  I didn't add any of the optionals. 
I DID add an extra tablespoon of coconut oil thinking the bran flake flour would absorb more than the wheat flour.When I mixed all the ingredients I formed small balls and baked them as directed. 
They came out DELISH! My family loved them as well. Next time I will double this recipe.

These cookies were really easy to make and they came out really big. I didn't add cranberries because I didn't have any, but I did include the chocolate chips and coconut. The cookies were very flavorful and satisfying, especially considering all of the healthy ingredients in them.

I cut the sugar by 1/3 and added a tsp of pure vanilla. They were still too sweet (next time I'll 1/2 the sugar and add a little more applesauce) and I found the best way to keep them together when I put them on the cookie sheet was to press them into balls in my hand, and then press onto the parchment paper. But once they were baked, and cooled, they stayed together well and tasted pretty good. I did not add chocolate (not a fan), but will probably add cranberries next time.

GF version.  OK cookies.  I halved this recipe and it yielded 18 cookies so I don't know how big they are intended to be.  I weighed them before baking and each weighed 33 grams (approx. 1 ounce).  I also had to add a TBSP and a half more applesauce than directed.  Evidently my GF flour needs more liquid than regular wheat flour.  I used all purpose GF flour in place of the whole wheat.  I didn't care for the baking soda flavour and they didn't really rise so next time will be leaving that out for sure.  I added the chocolate chips but not the shredded coconut. It took me 25 minutes to prepare everything then the cookies took 15 minutes to bake, so figure in a bit more time than 25 minutes in all.   Kids liked them.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I held on to this for a couple weeks, waiting for time to make them. I am so glad I made the time! This has to be the best oatmeal cookie I've ever tried! They are VERY soft so you do have to let them cool before trying to pick them up but what a wonderful treat! Just the right amount of chips and a good chew from the coconut and cranberries. Thanks for sharing Island Girl!!

These are amazing!! I followed the recipe as written, except without adding the craisins or coconut. I added 3 tbsp of cocoa to make them double chocolate cookies!

Overall this is a good recipe for nice chewy oatmeal cookies...but 1 cup of dried fruit is just way to much. I opted for raisins for a more traditional flavor and found myself picking a lot of them out of the batter because my scoops were not holding any shape and just sort of falling apart with that much dried fruit. 1/2 cup next time will be perfect!

Delicious healthy cookie! I used Truvia brown sugar, used fewer cranberries, added walnuts & vanilla, included the coconut, and used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. Love them! Excellent base cookie recipe with lots of variations for stir-ins available. Thanks for posting!

Looking at the comments and nutritional info helped me decide to make these much smaller. Instead of 12 large cookies I made 36 smaller cookies. I also switched goji berries (less sweet and more nutrition) for the dried cranberries and I eliminated the shredded coconut. They were great.

Made this exactly as the recipe called for (but added in finely chopped pecans). Was easy to make and the cookies came out really well! I made this for my vegan brother to have a dessert option at a family gathering. The vegan options are usually the least popular at these things, but this was a fan favorite among everyone! Would definitely make again!

Delish! Mods - 1/3 C sugar, 1/2 dark chocolate chips, no raisins or coconut flakes. Second batch mods: 1/3 C sugar, 1/2 C raisins, and suggested amount of coconut flakes. This was also yummy with a milder flavor, slight sweetness so you can tase the coconut flakes. Would add the full C of raisins or cranberries next time. Thank you for the recipe!

I substitute almond flour and add extra chia seeds. I find if I bake them a little longer, they don’t fall apart. I also cut the sugar back a little.

I love this recipe  I love that you can change it out too. I have made it with dried mango and pineapple.  I’ve done dried apples with 1:4 cup chopped walnuts.  I’ve done dried blueberries with 1/4  c chopped almonds  and lessened the applesauce a bit for peanut butter.  Not only do they taste good this is the healthiest cookie recipe I can find!!

My new go-to vegan cookie recipe. 
I followed this as written and they were spectacular and a huge hit with vegans and those who swear they hate anything that might be remotely healthy --
I just didn't that there was something craaaazy like chia seeds in there ;). 
No sticking if using parchment and an easy recipe to play with (this rating is for it as-written because I think it's only fair to rate a recipe after trying it as provided). 
Rave reviews by all sorts of eaters, transports in batches well, fun to play with the recipe. Definitely a winner in my book.  Mahalo Island Girl!

These were easy to make and tasty but they came out more chewy than I would have liked. Not sure if I didn't bake these long enough or if that's how they were intended to be. Next time will add nuts, bake on the longer side, or will look through reviews for recommendations on getting them crispier.

I don't get how this recipie rated as high as it did. The cookies were OK, but they stuck so bad to the sheet I ended up throwing half of them out. The second batch I even took 2 minutes off. they weren't even browned yet but they still stuck.

Followed this recipe exactly, and they turned out amazingly!! I baked just 8 small cookies at a time and kept the rest of the batter in the fridge to bake off fresh the next day. Delicious.

I had old-fashioned oats in the cabinet and so used those. These cookies are a-mazing. Have made them twice already (without chocolate chips, with coconut flakes).

Made these with a 2 and 4 year old. We had a blast and loved them. They were easy to make and not a lot of mess. The texture was amazing and they have just enough chocolate chips. Very important to let them completely cool before trying to handle. Will certainly be making these again.

These cookies were delicious, consistency was just perfect, all the ingredients blended very well. I loved the soft somewhat gooey favorable taste. I used Oceanspray cranraisins instead of dried cranberries and it really made  them tart and sweet. I also increased the applesauce to 3/4 cup and used chunky applesauce. Great recipie!

So easy - and surprisingly delicious. Makes some of the tastiest oatmeal cookies I'v ever had. They taste "whole," if that makes any sense. Fresh, with clear flavors perfect;y balanced.

The only mod I used were using my own chia seed/flaxseed meal blend. The dough looked like it needed a bit more flour, so I added 1/4 to 1/2 c. Opted not to use dried cranberries or chips but did mix in 1/2 c. chopped walnuts.

Baked cookies were chewy but firm enough to hold their shape when held with one hand.

This will be a go-to recipe for me.
