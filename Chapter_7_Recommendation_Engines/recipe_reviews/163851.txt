I had snow peas on hand that I didn't know what to do with - Now I do!  This is an excellent recipe and so quick!  My husband loved it!  Water chestnuts just makes this dish and the sauce was fabulous.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This was very simple, and actually pretty elegant for something you can whip up in less than 20 min. I omitted the mint, because it just didn't suit my taste buds tonight, and I added almonds and oregano for a little something extra.

This recipe is a great way to jazz up a side dish. My husband and I really liked the combined flavors of all the ingreadients.

This is a easy, tasty way to prepare snow peas! I didn't have any sesame seeds, so I used sesame oil instead of olive oil. This boosted the sesame flavor. The mint seemed a little strange to me, but it really didn't taste that bad in the end! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Sorry but I didn't care much for this one. I think too much sesame flavor.  I did like the mint, though.

We couldn't really taste the mint. Prehaps fresh mint rather than dried would have made a difference.

Used toasted sesame seeds and, because I don't care for mint, substituted with fresh cilantro instead. Light and refreshing recipe, thanks!! Note: If you sub with cilantro add it at the end when/if you season with salt and pepper because cilantro doesn't stand up to cooking!

My husband loved this, and I ended up liking it, but it had to grow on me. It was fast and easy to make, a big plus. I used half olive and half sesame oil. I think my water chestnuts werenâ€™t the best quality, a little soft. Next time I'll also try toasting the sesame seeds.  The mint added a great flavor. All in all a very good recipe.  Will definitely be making again.

I had about 1/2 lb. of snow pea pods that a friend grew in her garden.  I sauteed them in sesame oil as directed.  When I looked for the water chestnuts - they were not there.  Oh well, this would have been 5 star had I added them.  I used 1 T. sesame seeds and that was plenty. The seasoning I used was the pepper/garlic and sea salt/garlic grinders.  I was pretty light on the fresh mint and will add more next time. It looked really pretty on my plate.  A little light soy sauce made it a great dish.

Flavor was a little bland. Added garlic salt and a little low sodium soy sauce that made it tastier. Love snow peas and the crunch of water chestnuts was great addition.

I made this and had great response from family.  I did not have fresh mint but used some dried.  I have fresh mint this week and will give it another try.  Very good recipe.

Blah. Water chestnuts were mushy and added little to the garden fresh peapods.

This was okay. The mint flavor was overpowering and I didn't use an entire tablespoon of mint. Next time, if there is one, I would only use a pinch of mint and I would add a splash of soy sauce.

Added chives and fresh basil but I don't think it added much. Loved the mint and lemon idea.
