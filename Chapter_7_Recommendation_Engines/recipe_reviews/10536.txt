This is the same recipe my family has made for generations.  I use regular sugar and add all the flour, then extra for rolling.  I also roll them an 1/8th inch thick or less, between sheets of waxed paper, running back and forth to the freezer to keep them chilled!  I then *paint* them with a powdered sugar/ milk mixture thinned up enough to use a silicone brush to just glaze them.  Absolutely the best butter cookie ever! I usually get 40+ cookies out of the same recipe.

This is an excellent basic shortbread recipe (and I have been making shortbread for many, many yrs.). A suggestion might be to chill slightly before trying to roll it. Another suggestion is to substitute 1/4 cup of rice flour or cornstarch for the all purpose flour. Enjoy
