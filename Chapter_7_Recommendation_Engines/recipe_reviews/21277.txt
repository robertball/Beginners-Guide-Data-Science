I actually use this recipe to cook most of my dry beans (black, red/kidney, pinto).  I then use the beans in things like burritos, enchiladas or smother rice with them.  No soaking! Just put them in the crock pot for 4-8 hours and let them cook.  They always come out just right!  Sometimes I omit the wine, vinegar and bellpeppers (just a personal preference, but it's okay w/them).  The beans have a "mexi-type" flavor.  I didn't have a problem with "tough" beans...but if you are skeptical, leave the salt out!  **UPDATE**:  I've made this recipe MANY times now and I truly appreciate this recipe! I've used it to cook beans for several other recipes on this site that require "canned beans" as well as fresh.  The beans freeze nicely for later use.  This is a great BASIC recipe that allows you to add as many or as few extras to it and it's still good.  You can even use balsamic vinegar instead of distilled vinegar. The best part is that this is SO healthy!  It has no additives or preservatives (you can barely find that these days)and it cost pennies to make!!  One crockpot of these beans can make a few different meals!  ENJOY

This recipe calls for dried beans soaked for all night... I always use dried beans but use a quick soak method. This would eliminate the salt making the beans "tough". The quick soak is simply: rinse dried beans in colander. Put dried beans into a stock pot covered with water, bring to boil (with lid off), boil for three minutes. After they've boiled the three minutes let soak for only one hour, with the lid on. A lot can be done in an hour! When the hour is over rinse again & proceed with your recipe. I've never had a problem with this method. And it actually helps to eliminate the problem (gas) most people associate with beans. I doubled this recipe today & we are already enjoying it! Very good flavor. I did add some more spices though, not too many.

Beans that are salted during the cooking process become tough. . .that's what happened here.  They never did soften even after hours of cooking. . .and cooking. . .and cooking.  Taste was marginal.

tasted almost like my aunt china's cuban black beans ( morros ). almost. would have benefitted from some tomato sauce and recao ( cilantro ) to really warm the cuban soul.  still, it wasn't that bad at all.

First of all, I took the easy way out and used canned beans.  I sautéed the onions, peppers and garlic in the olive oil, then added the bay leaf and seasonings.  I also gave it a good glug of chicken broth to help keep the beans moist while they simmered (the truth be told a little bacon grease too!), and also added the wine at this point. The idea of adding the wine at the end without cooking off the alcohol didn’t appeal to me.  Besides, simmering the beans WITH the wine helps give them good flavor!  I did add the vinegar at the end, which really served to brighten the flavor as well.  I simmered them about 20 minutes, basically the time it took to heat the chicken enchiladas I served them with.   I liked these dressed up black beans and they worked well with the enchiladas.

I thought this was a good recipe.  I made a few alterations.  I used 1 can of Black Beans, drained, and no salt.  I sautéed the onions and green peppers  in Olive oil.  Then I added everything else.  I used 2 Tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar, and 2 Tablespoons of Molasses.  Served this to some friends, and there wasn't any leftover.

I would give this a 4.5 if I could. It was very good but I didn't add the last 3 ingredients: wine, vinegar, and oil.

The taste of this is decent, but Sheepcrk is right--you can't salt it if you use dry beans.  This would be fine with canned beans, or adding the spices later, but it takes over five hours of boiling as-is.  It's worth making if you do use canned, though, and since the flavor isn't particularly strong, it makes a nice, mellow side dish for pretty much any meal.

I loved the flavor of these beans, but they came out so tough. I used dried beans, and knew enough to leave the salt until the end, but forgot about the vinegar. Acidity makes uncooked beans tough! From what I can tell, a lot of people who have rated this recipe highly have used canned beans or left out the vinegar, and followed another user's suggestion to salt at the end.  

Next time, I'm going to try leaving -both- the salt and the vinegar out until the beans are cooked.

I don't understand the poorer reviews - Halved recipe and used quick boil method (omitted the wine, vinegar & oil step at the end).  I did wait 45 minutes before adding salt and mine were perfectly cooked in 2 hrs.  I'm wondering if some of the people who complained about hard beans used older ones.  In any event, I was looking for a simple straight forward method for cooking dried black beans and this was it.  The seasonings are perfect if you're looking for simple side dish (which is what I wanted).  Served with Mexican rice, tortillas, and Rick Bayless' grilled Mexican chicken.  Absolutely delicious!

I have had black beans in the past but did not like them. I was given this recipe to try. I followed all the instructions but added about 4-5 jalapeño peppers. It was awesome! I have even shared some I cooked with family and neighbors who also thought it was awesome.

For someone (batchelor) that has NEVER made black beans before, this recipe sounded easy.  The one thing that confused me was the prep/cook time vs. the "ready in" time.  I think if I make this again, I'll stick to canned black beans instead.

This was a very tasty recipe for beans.  I didn't use dried beans - just opened a can of black beans instead.  However I followed the rest of the recipe excepting to season to taste.  Lots of controversy in the reviews concerning the directions to add the salt before cooking.  I've also heard that salting  before cooking results in hard beans.  So, I did a little internet search.  Here's a quote from an article on Chowhound.com by Roxanne Webber,   
 
 "In March 2008, the Cook’s Illustrated test kitchen found that soaking beans in salted water (three tablespoons per gallon) produces softer skins in your cooked beans. It also makes your beans taste better, as the salt penetrates the whole bean, rather than only flavoring the surface."   The article goes on to say that the reason some beans never soften is because they're too old.  Problem solved for me.

Made this to go with Pollo Rancho Luna: quite nice but nothing special. However, I turned the leftovers into soup, jazzed up with some chopped salami - fantastic!! So I will try again, adding more pepper, some celery and some sausage or salami.

I loved this recipe, however I started soaking the beans and then I looked for a recipe.  I had already added some chicken broth that had quite a lot of salt in it.  I then started adding the other ingredients and realized I needed to rinse the beans.  So I drained them through a fine strainer and added more water and seasoning.  I ommited the white vinegar, olive oil, and white wine, and added blended stewed tomatoes, a couple of tlbs of balsamic vinegar, finely ground up carrots for sweetness and healthliness, and a 15oz can of tomatoe sauce.  I also added a diced up kielbasa sausage that I microwaved first and drained off the fat. I cooked it for several hours to help soften the beans, and also intensify the flavors.  It was so delicious. Oh I also added basil in place of the oregano, didnt have any on hand.  The beans softened up great in time.

This was a simple recipe to follow but didn't give me the flavor I was hoping for. My husband and I are from the south and love our seasonings! The spicier the better. But the flavor in this was just okay. Not enough though...

Best black beans I have ever tasted. I omitted the green pepper (just a personal preference as green pepper just doesn't seem to agree with my stomach). Didn't soak ahead of time, just put them right in the crock pot as one reviewer suggested. Added salt from the start as suggested by the same reviewer. After 6-8 hours on low, beans were still "crunchy". Added 1 cup additional water and cooked for another 8 hours over night. Beans were perfectly cooked and tender. Stirred in white wine, vinegar and olive and cooked down a bit and the end result is really fantastic. Keep in mind that you are adding a full cup of liquid at the end. Therefore, you probably want the beans to have cooked down considerably before the last step.

I had a bag of black beans and used this recipe to prepare them. We enjoyed them as a side dish the first night. I also used them drained over a green salad and in a Bean Bean Chili recipe from this site. Great depth of flavor! Definitely a Keeper!

So easy ! Just use canned organic black beans, I don't have the time to do all the boiling etc. you can get this ready in 20min. Just sauté some yellow pepper a half of chopped onion and some garlic and oil . And a teaspoon of cumin , tsp of oregano , add your drained beans add a little oil and some organic apple cider vinegar and it's pretty yummy! Sprinkle with fresh cilantro when plated , Yum!

This was O.K. but nothing great. I cheated and used cans of black beans. I also had to add some sugar to offset the vinegar. Way too much vinegar, definitely reduce. That said, I think it rated closer to a 3.5* because it went well (flavorwise) with a Mexican chicken dish.

Great base recipe. My only alteration was to add a chopped, seeded jalapeno along with the onion, etc to give the beams a bit more flavor. I used the quick soak method described by MrsOz and didn't have any problems with adding salt. Delicious alternative to canned beans.

I don't typically rate a recipe without making it exactly as written. However, I did everything except the last steps of wine, oil, and vinegar. It was soo good as is I just couldn't wait. LOVED IT.

Really great! Fixed 3/28/12:  Used 4 cans of Bush's black beans....onion flakes....minced garlic.  Cut salt to 1tsp....cumin and oregano to 1/2t....used cider vinegar, about 4t.  Omitted pepper, wine and oil but might try them next time.

After cooking over 100 batches of 1# beans with lessons learned. I salt the soak water with 1 tbsp salt. soak 8hrs, drain, rinse, cover with 1" with water and bring to a boil (it takes about 15min). boil for 3 min. cover and turn to LOW. set timer for 1 hour. 30 min. in add 1 onion cut into 8ths don't add any salt. When timer goes off then check with a fork when pressed down  the black beans should have no resistance. Overcooked and they mash to easy you want soft but not mush. 1 hour works only for small black beans larger pinto adds 30 min. Adding green peppers or poblano's are very nice. Thanks

Without the vinegar and oil, these were fantastic. I also had issues with adding salt during the cooking process, so I would recommend saving that for the end. Great with other beans, too!

I have made this recipe many times.  As an old Cuban friend told me many years ago, just clean the beans really well by rinsing them several times then put in a pot and bring to a boil, cover and simmer for about 3 hours.  When soft then add all of your spices.  I chop up lots of fresh onion and with that add cooked  rice.  What a great side dish. Note DO NOT ADD ANY SPICES AND THAT INCLUDES SALT BEFORE COOKING.  ADD AT THE END.

This recipe tasted amazing! It was exactly what I was looking for, I did omit the cooking wine, green peppers and used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar only because that's what I had on hand.

this is such a good recipe. I added the salt after about an hour of cooking to ensure that the beans were not tough. That seemed to work and the flavour was great. The point about this recipe is that it is not supposed to have a smack you in the face kind of flavour - that comes from the other things you will put them with - I put mine with spicy enchiladas and they complimented it beautifully, adding a really nice savoury flavour and gorgeous texture.

I liked the flavor of the beans, but they are mild to me. Cooked my black beans after soaking 12 hours; they still needed a couple of hours of cooking time.  Held off on the salt (1 T seems like an error.)  Only added the vinegar at the end of cooking -- not wine, and used the rice vinegar I had, which is pretty mild.  I also added cilantro, which a reviewer suggested, even though I had only some old dried stuff. 

Note: you need a couple of cans of prepared beans to come near the amount the recipe creates.

I Served it on rice w/salsa and lime.  Tastes even better with smoked sausage, though.

This didn't work out for me.  Beans were tough, even after cooking a lot longer than specified in recipe.  Not a bad flavor and we did eat all of it with a week's worth of lunches.  Others seem to have had good luck with this recipe, so I may consider trying it again.

I cheated and used canned beans. Sautéed onions,peppers,and garlic in the olive oil. Added the cooked beans and simmered for 30 minutes. Then added wine and vinegar. Very tasty.

Initially made it exactly as written.  It was very salty, otherwise completely bland, and swimming in liquid.  I added chipotle hot sauce and dumped a bag of farro into it to soak up some of the liquid and it was better, but still not very good.

Had to throw this out because the beans were crunchy and not cooking. I followed the non-soak method but forgot to not add salt. I’ll be buying canned beans from now on, just not worth it trying to cook them.

I'll make these again.  I didn't find this recipe until after my black beans were completely cooked.  I sauteed some onion and bell pepper, put in some garlic and cumin, and put all it plus a couple bay leaves in to  cooked beans.  As the rest of dinner was finished I put in a bit of red wine vinegar but didn't have any cooking wine.  I also skipped the additional olive oil, since I sauteed the onion and pepper in it earlier.  I look forward to following the recipe from the beginning next time.

I was desperate for something for dinner and had most of the ingredients, so I thought I would try this.  I am very new to this kind of recipe so for me it was a real gamble.  Surprisingly  I really liked it, as did my son.  Next time I will be sure to have everything on hand and I am sure it will be even better.  I only gave it four stars because  I think with everything it will be 5.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so close to a recipe I have for Cuban black beans its practically the same. My recipe calls for the addition of a can of tomatoes with green chilies and instead of olive oil I replace it with 1/4 cup of bacon fat. Yeah I know, cringe all you want but they are over the top for flavor. Like SHEEPCRK said, salt added to beans at the start of cooking makes them tough, I add the salt a few mins before turning off the fire.
 I use them for just about anything that calls for black or pinto beans, they make a quick black bean and rice burrito and my husband likes to have a bowl of them with corn tortillas.

I thought this was a bit bland then I added Bragg's instead of salt and a Serrano for some kick. Good basic starter then you can make it your own!

I omitted the wine, vinegar and olive oil as I wanted to freeze the beans for future use. I used a 2 lb bag of beans and made them in my slow cooker. Very nice seasoning combo.

We thought these beans were pretty good. All three of my sons ate these and two asked for seconds, which was nice! To be honest, I thought with all of the spices these would have more flavor or be spicier than they were. I had these as a side dish tonight with burritos, but I think next time I will put these right in the tortilla as a filling. It could work well either way! I'm sure these will be made again since the boys liked it, but I might play around with the ingredients to see if I can get more flavor out of them. Thank you for the recipe, Ivis!

Great taste. Left out the vinegar at the end. Our family eats it for burritos, tacos, and as a side dish all week. Better than canned beans.

this recipe is fantastic I did wait till the end to add the salt and I thought adding the vinegar oil and wine is crucial to the flavor. I did cook the beans longer than it said maybe 3 hours. my hubby insist these are the best beans ever and I am no longer allowed to buy canned.

the beans were very hard even with trying to use MrsOz's trick and not adding salt and vinegar during the process.. i ended up dumping them into the crockpot and left them on all night.. they're "ok" now.. but i wouldn't try this again
