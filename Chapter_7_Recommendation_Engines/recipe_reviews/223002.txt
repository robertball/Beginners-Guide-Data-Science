This was sooooo good!  I followed a reviewers advice to reduce the honey sauce by half - perfect amount.  I was looking for more of a sweet and spicy sauce but between pure honey and orange zest it was way more sweet and not enough spicy so I doubled the cayenne.  Next time I will reduce the orange zest, keep the cayenne amount the same, and add additional spice with beautiful flecks of crushed red pepper.

This recipe is very tasty. Next time we will definitely cut down on the honey, a full cup is way too much. We just drizzled the sauce on the shrimp and it turned out great.

This shrimp was delicious! I also cut the honey by half and used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. The sauce came out really thick but that's probably because I accidentally let it simmer too long. I didn't really measure the lemon juice, but I should have because it was a little sweet and the right amount of lemon would have made it perfect. I also put the shrimp into the pan with the sauce and completely coated them instead of drizzling the sauce. I would definitely make this again.

Have made this over and over. Followed other suggestions and halved the honey and added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes along with the cayenne. I served it over basamati rice. I felt that it could use vegetables and thought of my Orange Shrimp that I get a the local Chinese place. I steamed some fresh broccoli in the microwave (florets in a glass container with lid and a few TB of water for about 3 minutes) and served that with the shrimp. It adds a lot to the meal.  I've also made it with cut up pieces of chicken thighs since my sister is allergic to shrimp. That was great too!! This is a keeper and I've been asked many times for the recipe.

Five stars all around.  I'd give it 10 Stars if I could.  The sweet honey orange pairs nicely with the shrimp and is guaranteed to be a crowd pleaser.  I wanted a bold orange flavor so I omitted the lemon juice and replaced it with fresh squeezed orange juice from the orange used for zesting.  That turned out to be a good decision.  It had an amazing fresh orange taste.   Mmmm!  Rather than shake the shrimp in a bag, I hand rolled the shrimp in the cornstarch mixture to ensure a good heavy coating.  I ended up with over 3/4 of the mixture leftover.  If you don't want to be wasteful, I recommend cutting the cornstarch mixture in half.

Wonderful recipe.  Used regular honey and that was the only thing we did different.  I made last week and my husband wanted me to make for Valentine's dinner.  I told friends how wonderful it was and they all want the recipe.  Make this.... the flavor AMAZING~ you won't be disappointed.

A fun recipe to try! When my boyfriend came up from downstairs to eat, he said it smelled like something gourmet was cookin’ in the kitchen! He was pleased with how it tasted—he enjoyed everything about it! As the person who prepared it, I made a couple changes: I used olive oil in place of canola oil (out of sheer laziness…it was within arms reach…though, it definitely has a higher smoke point!). I used regular honey, though I read “tupelo honey is the standard by which all other honeys are measured” so if you can get your hands on some, you might have an even tastier dinner. :) I agree with the others who halved the honey mixture (which I zapped in the microwave) and I would definitely increase the cayenne if you want any heat. I’d also say you could probably get away with half the cornstarch mixture, but since it’s pretty cheap, I suppose it’s better to have an excess than run out and have to make a little more. –Yum! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Serve the sauce as a dipper on the side to ensure crispy shrimp from beginning to end of meal! Also allows for the diner to be in control of sauce/ spice/ added calories. Add spices (paprika, garlic, crushed red pepper etc)  and citrus supremes to sauce for added depth of flavor.

Too sweet!  Not hot at all, I added a squirt of Sriracha but still never got hot.

I used organic Arrowroot as ALL cornstarch is GMO.  You will not get that crisp brown with Arrowroot, but it does get crunchy.  

Changes: more sriracha as cayenne will not dissolve in the honey, less honey and a splash of OJ to help thin or more citrus.  It is a good base recipe.

SOOOO GOOD! I used regular honey and 1/2'd it, and there was still some left over, so just a heads up on that. The seasoning in the cornstarch mixture was perfect, IMO. These were exactly how I'd hoped they'd be...we were very happy w/ dinner tonight! Def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

1/2 the honey or it is way too sweet for our taste. We're not into too much heat, so I just sprinkled a pinch of cayenne, but added a pinch of cumin for flavor. Substituted orange juice from frozen concentrate for lemon. Otherwise, pretty good.

I love this recipe! It reminds me of one of my favorite items at Granite City restaurant. We use this recipe to make shrimp tacos. Simply heat some tortillas, fillet with the shrimp, and plop some coleslaw on top. Yummy!

Taste was amazing. Perfect combo of sweet and heat. One modification: at the end, with shrimp set aside and honey orange glaze simmering,  I threw the shrimp back into the sauce mix to give it a thorough coating. Very happy with this & will make again.

Very good!  Be sure you don’t run out of oil while you are cooking them, they will stick and breading will come off. I too used only 1/2 cup of honey (orange blossom) and just a dash of cayenne. Loved it, will make again.

I loved this recipe! The shrimp was crispy and the glaze was perfect. I used prawns and made everything according to the instructions. The seasoning was sweet and very spicy. I made the lemon rice to go with it.

I made half a recipe since there are only two of us and we are light eaters.  It was really delicious!  AND it was quite simple to make.  It's spicy, but not too much.  

I served it with white rice.  Next time I'll increase the cayenne, but only a little.

Will definitely make again soon.

Great shrimp dish..
I accompanied them with rice and sautéed veggies and kale. 
The only thing I would change would be less honey on the shrimps.... Otherwise.. Great for a lite dinner.

This recipe was very easy to make and  a hit as an appetizer. Next time I will use more pepper and less honey.

I couldn’t find toupolo honey... used orange blossom honey instead and it came out too sweet. Not very orange tasting either. I used lots of orange zest.

Holy delectable crustaceans, Batman. This may be one of the best recipes that has ever tickled my taste buds. The recipe is perfecto with no adjustments.  I served with broccoli but would add rice next. Fantastic!!!

Very tasty. I made it for my wife. She said it was the best shrimp she ever had. I did add extra pepper because other reviews said it was to sweet and not enough heat.

This was great I did use only 1/2 Cup of honey because that all I had left, but it tasted great. I think I'm even going to try this recipe using chicken.

shrimp allergies at the casa, so I substituted chicken breast cut in 1in cubes. The cornstarch was a chalky finish, so I would sub in some rice flour and or tapioca starch instead of 100% cornstarch. 
 
I also used only 1/2 of the honey, and I could reduce that amount again by half and use water to make up the difference. I had the orange left from zesting, so I juiced that and and used a lime I had left from another project. It put me right at 1 cup of sauce mixture with 1/2t of crushed red pepper.It was the perfect amount for dipping. Also, I burned myself trying to wipe out the pan, so I would simply simmer sauce in another pan instead of trying to clean up the hot oil.

Varying reports on sauce. I thought it a tad too sweet, but nicely spicy. Others thought it maybe too spicy. I would definitely use the sauce again, it was a great combo.

This was very good. I doubled the cayenne pepper and didn't pour all the honey sauce over the scrimp.  We used the extra sauce as a dipping sauce for the scrimp.  I will be making this again but not as much honey and maybe a little more cayenne pepper.  Loved the scrimp coated with the corn starch, it stayed crunchy even after the honey was drizzled over it.

I used the full cup of honey, way too much. Should have heeded the reviews to cut it in half.  Everyone ate it and no complaints. I'll try it again with less honey.

Oh my, so good. I made for family and hubby loved it. I did change it just a bit. I mixed the sauce up first (not in pan) and removed shrimp for pan and added the already mixed up sauce then added the shrimp back in. I did added 1/4 soy and 2t cornstarch and replaced the cayenne with red pepper flakes to sauce before adding it to the pan.  
I will add this to my go to shrimp list.

Indeed a very nice recipe....I also followed the reviewers suggestions and was easy on the honey.  I also added lots of red pepper flakes in both the corn starch and sauce because we love the spice!!  I did wish the shrimp were a bit more crispy, will add some panko to the corn starch next time.

This was a great dish! I served it with quinoa and vegetables. After reading the reviews, I also used half the honey called for and substituted crushed red pepper for the cayenne, as well as the following:

-Halved the corn starch
-Dramatically reduced the oil and used a combination of sesame and hot chili oils (which helped boost the spiciness)
-Instead of lemon juice, used juice from the orange I had just zested.

Will make this one again!

Very good shrimp. I made the sauce but we used it as a dipping.
We also tried some Thai chili sauce in with the honey sauce.
Will definitely fix the shrimp again, but will keep looking for a winning sauce.

Loved it! I found this recipe in the AllRecipes Magazine.  It was a little different than this one, with only 1/2 cup of honey.  I cooked the shrimp a little longer to get them really crispy.  Perfect served with rice.

This was absolutely fantastic!!!!!  I made it as the recipe  stated, with the addition of 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I was so confident in the great reviews regarding the taste of the sauce, that I made the full amount of sauce so that I would have extra to have with chicken, etc. on another night. I mixed all the sauce ingredients in a "sauce" pan, and drizzled some of it on my crispy prawns. I did put some of the sauce in a little dish for dipping, and saved the rest for another meal.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before making this, as directed.  It was good but WAY TOO SWEET.  Thankfully we just drizzled part of the shrimp to see if we would like it.  If I make it again I will for sure cut down on the honey.  But it was tasty.  We'll see how the leftovers work for fried rice tonight.

First off, I did make slight changes.  My version probably 4 stars.  Will review again if I make exactly per recipe.  Only changes were for sauce: reduced honey to about 1/2 cup, increased juice to about 2/3 cup and used fresh squeezed OJ from the zested oranges.  Resulting sauce was thin, so I used some of the left over corn starch mixture to make a slurry to thicken the sauce a bit so I could spoon the shrimp and sauce over rice.  Very nice crunch, seasoning was very good.  I added just a bit of ginger.

Will definitely make again. I only had a 1/2 cup of honey left so I used it all, and it turned out perfect. Couldn't imagine using a full cup. Tossed the shrimp in the sauce then served.

I used 2 pounds of shrimp and there was just enough breading and sauce, as written, at least for our taste.  If you're a fan of spicy food, double or triple the cayenne pepper - I will be doing so next time.

This was absolutely delish-had it for super bowl and my husband said I can make this anytime : )
I added a little more red pepper and a little cornstarch to the honey mixture because we used the sauce to dip our shrimp. Outstanding thank you!

The sauce was excellent but the breading left a lot to be desired.

Followed the recipe except did half of the honey as suggested. Also had to use local honey. It was excellent! My whole family loved it.

Amazing! The shrimp combined with the orange honey sauce was very tasty. I wanted to eat the sauce alone since it smelled so good.

My husband and I loved this recipe. We'll be making it again many times. It's just the right blend of sweet and spicy. I used a nonstick skillet to fry the shrimp and didn't need as much oil as called for. Other than that, I didn't change a thing.
