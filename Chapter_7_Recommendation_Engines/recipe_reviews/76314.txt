I am a firm believer that every martini should have a little vodka in it so... I added 1 oz. of vanilla vodka and and finished it off with a sprinkle of Cadbury Flake. Cheers & thanks for sharing Kristen!

Lo and Behold, I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  I use banana liqueur for making Bananas Foster, but never thought it would make a very good cocktail drink.  Had I not had everything on hand, I don't think I ever would have tried this, otherwise, but it was very pleasant, rich, and enjoyable.  Nice alternative to white russians.  I will definitely make these again!

i can't even believe i'm saying this, but i thought they were too sweet. maybe it had to do w/the quality of my banana liqueur, i'm not sure. i'm definitely willing to give it another try and i think next time i'll add some vodka as another reviewer suggested. my husband liked it, tho, and i didn't hate it. just thought it was too sweet.

OH my gosh this was wonderful!  I followed the recipes exactly and it was perfect.  Even those who said they didn't like Martini tried it and loved it, watch out you may run out before you get your second drink!! (o:
