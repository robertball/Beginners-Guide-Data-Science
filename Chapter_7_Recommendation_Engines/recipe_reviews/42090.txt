I loved this recipe!  I made some changes, though.  I didn't have green peppers, so used crinkle cut sliced carrots, instead.  Also, I didn't chop vegetables, but sliced onions into rings. I omitted the ketchup, and used a can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, instead, and mixed those with the instant onion soup, before pouring on top of vegetables and meat.  Then, I poured about a cup of water over all.  I served with mashed potatoes, using the sauce as a gravy.  It was absolutely delicious!

Very good and very easy to make.  After I started, I realized I didn't have any tomato juice, so I used a can of tomato soup and 1/2 soup can of water.  I also had some grape tomatoes on hand.  I cut them in half and added them with the other vegetables.  It was delicious.

This recipe is excellent.  I used the original recipe as a base and cooked it in a large crock pot.  Hubby and children loved it.  The recipe was doubled.  I used 2 - 12 oz cans of V8 veggie juice instead of tomato juice since that is what I had on hand.  Cut the ketchup to about 3/4 cup and added 1 can of diced tomato.  Sauteed fresh mushrooms in Worchestshire sauce with hunks of celery stalks and garlic powder that I put on the bottom of the crock pot.  I did not add additional salt or oregano nor green peppers.  There is already enough salt in the juice and diced tomatos.  I did use dried basil in place of the oregano and added a couple of bay leaves. With doubling the recipe, I do believe that 1 envelope of beefy onion soup mix is plenty.  We served this wonderful dish over homemade mashed potatoes along with a couple of other side items.  Just great comfort food.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. My whole family thought this was delicious. I made a double recipe, using 1 can condensed french onion soup, 1/2 can water, and 2 8-oz cans of tomato sauce in place of the ketchup, tomato juice, and onion soup mix. I let it bake for 1-1/2 hours and the meat was very tender with a nice thick sauce. Thanks for sharing Angie.

What an awesome recipe! I sort of cheated a bit though. I put the green peppers, onions, mushrooms, celery, tomatoe juice, ketchup, dry onion soup mix all in a blender and made a puree out of it. (If the kids would have seen all of those veggies, they would have instantly hated it!) The kids loved it. I even made sure that they really liked it before I told them what was in it. My 7 year old got THIRDS!! And that's very odd for him!! Thank you so much!!~

Good flavor and super easy to make! I thought the sauce was a bit sweet for my taste so I might cut down the ketchup next time but this is a definate keeper! Also extra mushrooms would be great too the next time! Thanks so much Angie for posting this and THANK YOU Granny for such a great recipe!!!

Have made this several times and each time my husband raves about how good it is and how much he enjoys it. I have, however, changed the method ever so slightly, in that I dump all the veggies back in the pan with a tad bit more olive oil and saute till slightly browned. I then dump them all atop the meat and sprinkle with the soup mix and oergano. I then mix the juice and ketchup and pour over all. Cover and bake for 1 hour , checking about  1/2  way through to make sure there is enough liquid.   Is wonderful with baked patatoes that were put in the oven at the start.

Angie your Granny came up with a winner.  This dish is practically a meal in itself.  The lowly cube steak has never had it so good.  Added benefit is that it is easy to prepare and very forgiving to novice cooks.  Thanks, Granny!

I loved this recipe!!  All the way around!!  It was easy to make--the kids liked it well enough to eat it and not complain--My 15 year old even invited his best friend over for dinner---that's a compliment good enough for any mother!!  Easy to make & very good!!  I served it with corn muffins as suggested....a perfect meal!!!

This was delicous! Simmered it on stovetop and didn't have a green pepper or onion sop mix, o left those out. Added a little Flavor Boost packet at the end! YUMMM!!

This just happens to be my granny as well.  My cousin posted the recipe.  I made it myself the other day and since i dont like too much of a tomato taste i didnt put any ketchup in it and i also let it cook for about 2 hours and it turned out really good.  Props to my granny once again for a great recipe.  I plan on getting some more of her recipes and posting them here.

This was very tasty, and the meat was really tender, but ended up with a lot of watery liquid in bottom of pan at end of cooking time. Served with mashed potatoes and corn. My husband liked it quite a lot.

I sub'd a can of tomatoes instead of tomato juice and catsup, and served over brown rice.  Like another reviewer, this also reminded me of dinners from my childhood.  Very good and comforting.  Thanks for the memories!

I made this a few nights ago. My husband loved it very much and wants it again. I didn't have tomato juice so I used tomato paste and water instead. I put it all in a crock pot and let it cook on low all day. Served it with rice and veggies. I will definately make it again and again.

This was such an easy and delicious recipe. I did not have tomato juice so I put 1 1/2 cups water and one can of tomatoe sauce. I had already sauteed onions two tomatoes and I cut one potatoe and sauteed that together. To deglaze the pan I added the water/tomato sauce and then added the soup mix. I then added the sauteed veggies into the mix and then put all that on top of the meat. Delicious.

great recipe and the cube steak emerges very tender from this method.  I left out the chopped onion since the soup mix already had onion included.  very tasty, kids loved it, (even if they scraped off the "green stuff" first), no leftovers so I guess I'll put it on permanent rotation.  served with mashed potatos, though I might try buttered egg noodles next.  thank you for this recipe!

This was great! I made it in a pressure cooker and it took 20 minutes. I used top round steak and a 15-oz can of tomato sauce instead of the ketchup and tomato juice. Served with corn bread. Whole family loved it!

Very good and tender.  I did substitute salsa (with added water) for the tomato juice and ketchup however.  Baked uncovered for 1/2 the given time.

It was okay, however, way too much ketchup, it tasted like meat with ketchup smothered all over it, my kids liked it but the adults were VERY disappointed.

This turned out GREAT! I used a packet of mushroom gravy mix instead of the onion soup mix because that's what I had and it was wonderful. The tomato based sauce really makes this dish. I love mushrooms so I will add more the next time I make this. Super dish!

Good stuff!  I used ingredients I had on hand, so the recipe was modified a bit.  Instead of the tomato juice and ketchup, I used a can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes (with garlic & onion, undrained).  I also substitued an Onion  & Mushroom soup mix for the Onion Soup.  We really like mushrooms - so it added some extra flavor.  The only other change we made was to exlude the celery.  My husband loved the meal - and I loved that we now have 3 dinners worth of food!  One serving for leftovers and another to freeze for a lazy night.  I served the dish with lightly buttered egg noodles.  Yum!

This was a delicious meal. So tasty and tender. The sauce with the tomato juice and the ketchup...all the veggies. It was incredible. We all loved it. Gonna make it often. It would be great even with rice. I made mashed potatoes. Had a little for lunch next day and it tasted even better.....great recipe!

This is really good. I used fresh mushrooms because i prefer them to tinned. I also cooked this in my slow cooker because i'm a working single mum and don't have a lot of time to cook in the evenings. Even my daughter liked this. I served with rice and it was very filling. I would definitely make this again.

Very good flavor.  A lot of work to prepare so we usually double the batch to make lefotvers.

I have been looking for a good Swiss Steak recipe, and this is it!!  I've made this the other night, and it was delicious!  The steak was so tender no knife required to cut it.  And the sauce was excellent, very flavorful.  I do like the idea that it is browned first and then put in the oven to bake, and it wasn't dry, which is a big plus for me.  My husband enjoyed it also.  This is a keeper in my recipe files!

This Recipe is a keeper, it is simple to make and the flavor is good. I also like all the veggies in it. Next time, I might try mixing the onion soup mix with the tomato juice and ketchup.

Sorry Granny, We did not like this one.  Very acidic and sharp tasting.  I think it may have been from the cup of ketchup.  The vegetables need to be finely chopped to combine better with the sauce.  Way too much tomato flavor.  A little sugar may have cut the acidity or omit the ketchup.

It was good, I didn't have tomato juice either I did as another review suggested and use tomato soup with 1/2 cup of water. I also chopped my vegetables into small pieces as well to avoid the usual " I don't like that". I also use chilli sauce instead do plain ketchup for a little kick. Son enjoyed it, and I as well. will make again soon!

My hubby and I have made this twice now...both for company-everyone has liked it. We didn't put as many onions in b/c i have an allergy to onion. pretty good...it is still too sweet for me--i think its the ketchup... Served over rice. YUMMY.  I think more Mushrooms are definately needed.

Made this tonight..took me back to my childhood. This was just like I remembered Swiss steak to be. I drained the mushrooms by accident but I added a can of diced tomatoes. Yummy!!! This will be a family staple in this house. Easy quick and very tasty.

Thought it was ok, but not what I expected based on my recollection of my own grandmother's swiss steak. I followed the recipe exactly, minus the mushrooms which I don't care for. I felt it was kind of salty from the tomato juice and soup mix. Probably will try another recipe if I try to make Swiss steak again.

This was good, but I agree with the other poster who thought that the ketchup made it a little too sweet. Next time I will substitute tomato paste (and maybe a tablespoon of worcestershire) and see how that goes. I like the fact that the vegetables stayed crisp, but some may prefer that you saute them first. Not a bad recipe at all.

YUM! I made a few minor changes to this recipe.  First, I only used 2 cube steaks since there are just the two of us, but didn't reduce the rest of the ingredients because I like sauce and/or gravy. I decided to use fresh mushrooms and sauteed about half of the mushrooms and onions in the same pan as I fried the steaks in.  Like other readers, I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used a can of tomato soup and 1/2 cup of water and added that to the ketchup. We ate this over rice and it was delicious!

This was probably the worst swiss steak I've ever had. I did exactly as the recipe said and no one in my family liked it. I think the ketchup gives it an odd taste.

This is very tasty!  I did not use the peppers or onion soup.  I fried first, & then put in the crock pot on low for 4 hours.  It fell apart!  If your meat is tough - it's not from this recipe.  It's the meat you used.

I thought this recipe was very good, but I did make quite a few changes.  Mainly I did not use cube steaks as I don't like them. I got round steaks instead. I browned those as directed and then tossed it all in my crock pot for the day on high.  I was getting scared as the meat was not getting tender but after about 7-8 hrs it started to fall apart.  The flaver these ingredients infused in the meat was fantastic, you would never know it was a cheaper cut of meat.  I had so much extra sauce however that next time I will use much more meat.  I did give the recipe to my neighbor who hunts as I thought this would be great for him to try on venison to detract from the gamey taste.  

This is not the same kind of swiss steak I have had in this area before(WI) I have never had one with a tomatoe base, but it was very delicious in it's own way. Thanks for sharing.

Sorry...but this recipe is definately not one that I will attempt again.  I followed the recipe to an exact, but it was not what I was looking for.  The end result had a strong tomato flavor.  If you decide to try this one, cut back on the tomato juice.

I personally liked this recipe...not loved it, mind you, but liked it.  However, my husband, who boldly allows my creativity in the kitchen, couldn't even finish this.  I don't think that I have ever seen this happen before...lol.  He didn't like the taste of the sauce, the chunkiness of the veggies in this one, or the tough-chewiness of the meat.  Sorry, but thanks for posting anyway.

I took another's advice and pureed all the veggies with the tomato juice and ketchup so my kids would eat it and they loved it!  I also cut the ketchup down to 1/2 cup and used and extra 1/2 cup of tomato juice so it wouldn't be so sweet.  It was wonderful!  I paired it with the baked mashed potato recipe and they cooked along side one another and both came out wonderfully!  Thanks!!!

I did not care for this version of swiss steak, because it was different than what my brain and taste buds were expecting. However, if the name was changed,it wouldn't have conflicted with my expectations.

WOW amazing flavour!! My husband rated this a 10 out of five :-)!! I followed another reviewers advice and added an extra 1/2 cup water ( I cut the recipe in half to serve 2).  I also added a dash of garlic powder.  Serve extra sauce over mashed potatoes! Thanks so much for sharing!

This was a really great meal.  I catered a lunch with it and everyone loved it.  Not a big fan of green peppers so I'll probably not put in as much next time.

Amazingly good! I cooked this in the crock pot. I omitted the flour, and the catsup. Too many carbs and sugar. I subbed a 14 oz can tomato sauce for the tomato juice, and threw in a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes for some zing. I used some sirloin pieces left over from cutting steaks. I used fresh mushrooms, carrots, bell pepper, onions , celery, garlic, and subbed Italian Seasoning for the oregano. I loved all the veggies in this. The onion soup mix gave a perfect flavor. Really a delicious recipe and will definitely make again!

This was a different version of swiss steak for me and my family. We are used to it being prepared in a slow cooker, but this was well received and may now become a family tradition.

The meat was a little tough. I think if you cooked it longer it would allow the meat to tender up some. I used V8 jucie cause that is what I had on hand. I used 3/4 cup of ketchup.

This is really good!!!  It's easier to make than I thought it would be too.  I made it exactly as written except that I forgot to buy mushrooms for it, so I substituted carrots.  Since I like mushrooms better than carrots I'm sure it's worthy of the five stars!!!

This recipe was not very good.  Just edible I would say.  The meat was tough and chewy after I cooked it for over two hours.  Sauce was a bit too sweet, I thought.  Won't make again.

This was just okay. I won't be making it again. It was just the 2 of us, so I halved the recipe. I didn't use as much veggies as it called for, but it still was pretty chunky. It wasn't horrible, just not for us.

This was OK-I found the meat to be tough and chewy.  The sauce was also a little thick, but it tasted good served over mashed potatoes.

Sauce is too thick...  I would make this again, cutting the amount of ketchup to 1/2 cup, increasing the tomato juice to 2 cups.  Keep an eye on it in the oven...may still need to thin with a little water.

I made this once and it was delicious, then I lost the recipe - Oh, my!  All Recipes to the rescue.  Now I have placed it in my Recipe Box it is safe and sound, and it will be used often.
