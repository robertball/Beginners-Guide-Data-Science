Wanted something light for lunch, and since I had both zucchini and Granny Smith apples on hand, this was perfect.  Exceptionally crisp and fresh, the flavor that first hits you is the sweet apple, next comes the lemon, followed by the mint.  A high-quality olive oil and fresh lemon juice made a simple, tasty dressing.  The only thing that I will do differently in the future is toast the almonds.  And although substituting toasted pine nuts for the almonds may not be a true Sainte Marthe Salad, I think they would work equally well.  Thanks for sharing, enjoyed this today.

really good - probably even better in the summer when zucchini are in season
