Very tasty and filling...but there's a lot of chopping involved! Makes a good breakfast or side dish. I was getting a bad feeling when I was cooking the grits themselves, but it all came together when I returned the meat and cheese (but then again, doesn't bacon solve most of the world's problems!). Heeding another reviewer's comment, I seeded and dried the tomatoes before I cooked them. They still tinged the dish slightly red, but it didn't taste like tomato sauce. I also reduced the amount of ingredients to 1/3 (just 2 servings) and it still made a lot for two people. Overall it was a good dish, but it took me an hour and twenty minutes from start to finish. Good dish for a weekend meal, but too much for me to handle during the week.

This is a reciepe in many homes in the panhandle of Florida... This was the southern grit recipe that "this" Northerner took too. I have since moved North and use this recipe on a regular basis. This is good morning, noon, or night. I prefer to use Shrimp in the final cooking stage...

Howdy! This here is a very creative twist on a traditional staple of breakfast. I recommend it heartily, I think puttin' bacon bits in it mguht be over the top, but to each his own.

I followed this recipe exactly and it did not turn out like the picture at all.  Cooking the tomatoes, onion and bell pepper together pulled all the juice out of the tomatoes and my grits are much darker - like they were mixed with tomato sauce.  Also, this makes WAY more than 6 servings.  More like 12, really.  I have no idea what I'm going to do with all the extra.  Having said that, the family liked it, and I added extra hot sauce to my bowl which I think improved the flavor.

We really enjoyed this meal! It was really fun to make and it turned out just like the picture. I put 1/2 onion, fresh garlic and a bit less water. I like thicker grits. 1/2 C of SHARP cheddar really gives a richer flavor.Per other reviews on a similar dish, I gutted the tomatoes and added them next to last to prevent sogginess. by the time we ate they were softened just enough. This was a really fun meal to enjoy during black history month :)

This recipe is GREAT! This is my favorite recipe to use for any time of the day. Favorite for this site too. It is nice, because every ingredient mixes delicious and you can also have control over how hot it needs to be for whomever its being made for. Perfect for New Orleans, Georgia, Alabama, or Florida style meals.

I made a variation based on what I had available: no bacon or ham so I left those out, and canned tomatoes instead of fresh. I did have a little bacon grease though, so I cooked the smoked sausage, peppers, and onions altogether in some bacon grease, adding the tomatoes a little later. I also added a bit less water because the canned tomatoes had some (and my pan was too full!). This is a great southern dish that can easily be tweaked based on what you have. I think next time I'll put some corn in it!

This is a great recipe! I used turkey bacon instead of regular, so I added a little oil to compensate. And I cooked everything together - cooked the meats with the veggies, then added tomatoes, seasonings, and grits, and let it all simmer together. I think I will definitely try canned tomatoes for the colder months! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Very yummy! A little spicier than I expected but I can fix that next time so my 2 year old can enjoy it also.

Turned out good, first time cooking grits so this recipe looked good.  I had a small fresh red jalapeno from the garden that I added, so I cut back on the tabasco.  also added chicken broth in lieu of some of the water and didn't add any salt to it.  Would definitely make it again.

I only added 1 cup of water because the juice from the tomatoes was already enough to cook the grits. I enjoy baked grits so I baked them at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.

Delicious! I omitted the bacon and used chicken stock rather than water, and it was so good! Everyone loved it and wanted leftovers. It was a wonderful side for my Mother's Day brunch, but it's hearty enough to serve as a main dinner course. I'm definitely making this again!
