hi, it's me, the person who submitted the recipe and i need to add that i always also add olive oil to the dressing. i just seem to add much less than what "traditional" dressing recipes call for? but i definitely add the oil. :)

I really enjoyed this salad - it's full of flavor and texture so even though it's light, there's much to satisfy your eyes and your mouth!

Props for being a healthy, beautiful recipe you CAN make ahead.  I made this salad twice.  Once, I made and ate at prep-time and once chopped and mixed all the vegetables except the lettuce the day before.  I mixed the dressing and poured it over the veg and the acids even kept the avocado from changing much at all overnight!  I poured veggies and dressing over lettuce that morning and kept meat, beans and cheese mixed separately for warming.  Added together at work the next day, it was still delicious!

The one downside is I went light on the dressing because I think it's a large amount of honey that isn't fully balanced.  The tanginess is interesting and makes a traditional taco salad more exciting, but there's something missing I can't quite pinpoint.  Unlike most dressings, this one contains no oil and I wonder if that base would mellow it out to what I expect.

Followed the recipe as set out in web site with exception of white wine vinegar instead of Champagne vinegar.   Easy to make. I will make it again, but will add some hot pepper.

Just made this for my husband and myself tonight. I didn't have champagne vinegar so I substituted white vinegar and I didn't have lime juice so I substituted lemon juice. It was amazing! I also used ground chicken! I forward this recipe on to my family members! This is my new go to recipe! Thank you so much!

08.01.17 ~ A nice taco salad with a great dressing to go with it.  The taco salad was fine, but I wouldn't add celery or carrots the next time.  I would add jalapeño slices, instead.  But..........the dressing was outstanding.  I will be making it again for other salad uses.  I didn't have champagne vinegar so I used white wine vinegar and only about 1 1/2 TB of honey as I wanted the zing of the lime juice to shine.  I did opt to use the shredded cheese.  For the salad I would give a 4-star rating, but because we loved the dressing I'm giving the dish 5-stars.

Great salad, loved it!  My husband is not a salad lover but he had two big helpings so he was impressed!  We added a bit of olive oil to help emulsify the dressing, only about 1 tablespoon.

We made it as the recipe directed.  One granddaughter made the dressing, one chopped salad veggies, and I made the taco meat.  It made for a fun night in the kitchen and was a wonderful dish - everyone had two helpings, even grandpa!   Will definitely make again.

The dressing in this recipe is a keeper.  It would go well with any taco salad and is a nice change from the Catalina Dressing which is a staple for many taco salad recipes!

I have been on the hunt for a great, healthier taco salad dressing and finally found it!!! My husband and four kids loved this one. We add a lot more veggies to salad and 1 TBL less honey. Really delicious!

The dressing is very flavorful, even without the oil (I didnt see the authors note in reviews). Can use black beans instead of kidney. It can be served without meat and is very good. Thank you for sharing!

This salad is delicious!  I used one less tablespoon of honey, but the dressing with the cilantro made the whole dish.  I will be making this again and again!

Great and tasty.  I added a bit more lime as I like it a bit tangier.

This is super good!  I didn't even make the lime dressing that went with it.  It was moist enough with the beef mixture (and I did drain the beef) and juice from the tomatoes.

Followed it EXACTLY as written ................. REALLY tasty and the lime element is really nice. Wife was less excited about the dressing but I thought it was worth adding to our rotation - especially for the summer.
Next time I may keep the kidney bean / ground beef piece separate for better leftovers. It's a LOT for 2!!!

I made this tonight and we absolutely loved it...  Very fresh and wonderful for a summer meal.   I did make some changes, though.  I left out the celery and carrots and used red pepper instead of green.  I used Wildtree Taco seasoning and added onions to the ground beef.  We are trying to use less sugar and I only added about half the amount of honey called for in the ingredients.  The fresh cilantro really made the dressing; great balance of sweet and tart in the dressing.  We'll definitely make this again!

I thought this was very good but definitely added olive oil to the dressing...can't imagine it without it. I also used a third of the honey as I thought it would be way too sweet. I used taco seasoning from this site and black beans instead of kidney because I prefer them.  Would like to try again with chicken and maybe a little salsa on the side.

I couldn't believe that even my picky eaters loved this.  After I mixed up the veggies, I heaped them on each plate, sprinkled some of the dressing on each, then grated the cheese on top.  Then I added the beef mixture over all.  Great with sour cream on the side, too.  Thank You - will make again for sure.

I used black beans instead of kidney beans and added only a small amount of EVOO. I used white wine vinegar instead of champagne vinegar.  I loved it (& I am a super picky eater) my friends and husband loved it. Easy to make and will make again and again. Had to serve it cold as our power went out just before guests arrived and I had cooked ground beef day before, so served it cold and still a hit!

Loved the sweetness of the dressing with the spiciness of the meat. I added onions to the ground beef mixture and tossed the beans in as well at the end to warm them.  Also made my own taco seasoning from the recipe on this site. Big Yum! Will definitely make again! (Soon!)

This was so good! I wish I would have made triple the amount. I added a dash of cayenne to the marinade, which we loved. I'm planning on trying it on some wings. Thanks so much!

delicious!  So many great flavors, it may say the cilantro is optional but it was amazingly perfect in it. Thank you!

For real, it is amazing ! 
My kid doesnt like avocado at all. He never noticed or complained for that presence on the meal.

Will redo again and again :)

We prefer chicken tacos, so I'll make this again but with boneless chicken breasts instead of ground beef.  I'm sure such a great recipe won't suffer a bit from the substitution.  For a gathering, you could prepare both meats and let people choose one - or both!
