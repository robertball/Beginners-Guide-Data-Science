I purchased a boneless prime rib with the plan to use my new electric slicer.  I cooked the prime rib as directed, watched the internal temperature, let it rest, and then sliced.  It was better than a 5-star restaurant.

I give this recipe 5 stars with adding extra cajun seasoning.  It gives the roast a wonderful crust!  This has become our favorite!

Adding the Tony Chachere's seasoning really made the meat delicious! I have a huge shaker of the stuff that my mom gave me and I have never found another recipe that used it. Thanks!

Wish I could give you a hug right now. Best recipe I have made on this site to date....Thank you for posting. 120 degrees makes a perfect medium rare.....other than the internal temp I followed the recipe exactly as posted....the mushrooms are spicy but AWESOME on rice.

Very tasty prime rib. No smoke from the oven during the 20 min at 500.  For  very pink add 1 hour at 350. Medium pink add 1.5 hours at 350. No pink, just tender, add 2 hours at 350.
