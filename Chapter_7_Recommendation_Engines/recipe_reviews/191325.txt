Pretty good, for a lowfat dressing. My son and I ate it with raw broccoli. He thought it was ranch! This is great for me, as I'm dieting and cutting back not only on calories but also on carbs. It's missing something that I can't put my finger on. NOTE: I halved this and it still made quite a bit. You might want to do the same.
