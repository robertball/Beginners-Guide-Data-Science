Sorry for the low rating but this recipe has very little in common with anything resembling a Buffalo wing. They may be tasty but you should not refer to these as "Buffalo wings" and I'm rating them as a Buffalo wing recipe. The original has/had no breading or coating just a plain wing fried in oil until the skin is crispy dipped in sauce. And while I don't know the exact recipe for the sauce it was mostly just butter and hot sauce. I realize there are many subtle variations that are still called "Buffalo wings" but this one is about as far from the original as you can get. Wrong cooking technique shouldn't have any breading and the sauce isn't even close. These are about as close to the original Buffalo wing as they are to Kentucky Fried Chicken Original Recipe. Might as well call them KFC Original Recipe. Finally frying breaded pre-boiled chicken wings at 350 for 10 to 15 minutes is likely to result in some seriously over cooked wings. It should only take a few minutes to brown and crisp the coating so keep an eye on them. I'm not a fan of pre-boiling because it draws out too much of the wing flavor while 375 degree oil will quickly seal the plain skin and keep most of the flavor inside. Then skip the breading and add to the sauce of your choice. Or bread the raw wings and fry them that way.

These were good and I really liked the flavor the corn flour brought to the wings. I've made many wings in my lifetime and I honestly didn't think boiling them first made any difference. I will most definitely make these again but will skip steps 1-3 from now on. Other than that GREAT wings!
