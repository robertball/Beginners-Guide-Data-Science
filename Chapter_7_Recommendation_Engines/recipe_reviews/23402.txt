What a great, great marinade. But I cannot stress enough: over cooked London Briol is extremely tough. It is unlike other inexpensive cuts of meat that only get more tender and tasteful the longer they cook. London Broil will get tougher and tougher.Be very careful with your cooking time.

I marinaded the london broil in the sauce over night and then discarded the left over sauce when I grlled the steak.  It was fantastic!!!  I also made a fresh batch of sauce on the stve top to use as gravy.  I served the steak with herb roasted potatoes and put gravy on both steak & potatoes.  Everyone raved over the dinner!

5 Second recipe that is worth 2 hours.  Very tasty on a chuck roast.  Poured it over the top of the roast, covered and cooked on 350 for 2+ hrs.  Uncovered after 1 hr. added 1 cup of H2O.  This sauce would be unbelievable on spare ribs.  Thanks alot for a sauce that I will use forever.

Great recipe.  Was expecting for one (or a few) of the ingredients to stand out, but they each compliment one another.

OK, so this was the frist time that I ever cooked london broil, and I felt like I should have marinated it for like a week...MAYBE it would have been tender then...but that has nothing to do with the yummy sauce!! I made a few changes and additions, such as garlic, a few dashes of liquid smoke and only half of an 8 oz. bottle of kraft zesty italian dressing...I will definately make this sauce again, maybe I will try a london broil in the slow cooker...

This is our new family favorite! I substitute onion soup mix for a tablespoon of onion powder. Cook it in the slow cooker on high for 6 hrs and shred with a folk, then put it back in the slow cooker for about a half hr! We have this at least once a week!

For a heartier flavor I also added bbq sauce instead of ketchup. I also reduced salad dressing, added balsamic vinegar and alittle A1 bold & spicy. Thanks for the post!

There were split reviews with my family.  More of a bbq flavor, which is not my favorite.  I cooked the London Broil in the slow cooker, in the sauce, which made a very tender roast.  Good for sandwiches, too.

This was very tasty as a marinade. I substituted a can of Campbell's beefy mushroom soup for the brown gravy and added a bit of garlic powder. A great way to zest up a london broil.

I needed a good sauce recipe for ribs and saw one of the reviews that stated this would be great. Well, not exactly. It was a good start, though. I like my rib sauces a little sweeter, so I added 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup of molasses, and about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. What difference

I liked it but my husband didn't.  It was just ok.  London Broil should be marinated, not coated.

Too much Italian Dressing for my taste (smelled like a salad.) But, my husband liked it.

I made this for a BBQ and everybody gobbled it up so I didn't even get a piece of the London broil.  I know it was great because everyone asked me about the sauce!  I think I will use this for all kinds of beef dishes in the futue. It was easy and tasted great!

I followed the recipe as written and used flank steak. I was disappointed with the flank steak and will use a different cut of meat next time.  On the 2ns day, I pulled the flank steak apart and added a little more milk to the sauce.  I put the mixture of noodles, and it was very good.  I will use the sauce mixture on other meats and very the thickness depending on how I will use it. It's a keeper.

This was pretty salty for me.  I guess it's the brown gravy and dry onion soup mixture.  Wasn't too crazy about this one.  Probably will try a different one next time.

No meat, if cooked slow enough, will be tough.
