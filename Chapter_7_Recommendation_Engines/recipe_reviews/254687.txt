I left out the olive oil for a lighter version but added a couple shakes of toasted sesame oil for flavor. Also added caraway seeds for a little more nutty flavor. Used what I had on hand so no red pepper or onion but the scallions were enough and added the garlic scapes I had too.
Wonderful summer salad. Ate it for 4 days!

Was a big hit! I dressed the salad in advance, about 2 hrs ahead bc I wanted the cabbage to soften. I only used 1 head of cabbage. I thought the peanut flavor was a bit heavy but everyone loved it. Will make again.

I'm always looking for good and different cole slaw dressings. This was ok but nothing special. The search continues.

I love this. So easy. Made it for a picnic! It was THE only salad bowl that was nearly empty. I did make it the day before so it marinated. Thank you!!!

This was a nice variation on our usual coleslaw, great for  a change.  It got mixed reviews at our house.

I love coleslaw and tried this for something different. The only change I made was in using Nappa Cabbage, and that was just because I couldn't find Savoy Cabbage. My family really liked it and I will definitely make it again.

Cabbage was tough.  Will not make it again.  Dressing just play.
