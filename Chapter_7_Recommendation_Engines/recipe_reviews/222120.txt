Very easy. Went on the cake very smooth. A little too sweet for me. May try again with less sugar.

My first cream cheese frosting attempt.  Easy and delicious.  I do think it was a bit sweet (probably because in the adjustment from the original the sugar was not halved like the other ingredients).  Fully covered "Sam's Famous Carrot Cake" with a little left over.  Will make again-and-again.

Great frosting! I did use 6TBS of butter instead, but it came out awesome. Thick and rich tasting. I just wanted to eat it straight from the bowl! I used this to frost the Pumpkin Sheet Cake from this site and had more than plenty, with a little left over even.

Simple and delicious! I have made this a couple times now. I start tasting after about 3/4 of the sugar is in and adjust as needed. Sometimes a cake doesn't need a really sweet frosting. A half recipe gives a nice thin layer of frosting  between and on top of two 8 inch round layers, which I like as a ratio.  The second time I made it I didn't realize I was out of butter, and used coconut oil instead. It turned out fine!

Very easy to make not to much of a cheesy taste or to sweet just the rite blend.

Tasted a bit like Greek yogurt, but was very yummy. Added cocoa to make chocolate  frosting, and it was way too thick, so added 1 tablespoon half & half.
