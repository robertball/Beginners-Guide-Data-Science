Great dessert.  I used 2 baked sweet potatoes that were left over and added honey instead of sugar, and left out the butter.  I only put butter in with the topping which was delicious even though I didn't have any coconut to add.   Will definitely make again!

I have never really cared for sweet potatos until I fixed this recipe one Thanksgiving.  I have fixed it every year since and everyone comments on how yummy it is compared to more traditional recipes.

My sister-in-law's mother always makes this for Thanksgiving and I absolutely love it! I made it myself for the first time this year, and it was so simple and tasted delicious!

The best. I made it exactly the way the recipe was written it is delicious. My 30 yr old son took a bite and didn't say anything, I asked if he liked it he said he was trying to throw everyone off the track! More for him Thank you so much for the recipe I will make this one many times in the future!

I happened to have a sweet potato that I needed to use, but no almonds or coconuts. So it went without. The fluff was soft sweet tasting, without any unusual flavors or textures. Definitely good, nearing impressive, but not really worth the calories. All that butter and sugar! Hense the 4. Don't tell your guests what's in it and I'd give it a 5.

6 Stars....very yummy. Better than marshmellows. There is a lot of sugar....I might use less next time. I steamed my sweet potatos before I mashed them... I will make this again and again!

Not too bad. I did what others suggested-halved the butter. I also threw some coconut on top. I think I would like it better with more seasonings-like clove, nutmeg, ginger, etc...

Oh so good, but ohhh so sweet! I enjoyed this very much, but because I knew how much butter and sugar was in it, I couldn't eat but a few bites! Other than cooking the sweet potatoes, this was a very simple "dump" recipe- a relief after working with my turkey all day.

Very good!  It was just a tad too sweet for my tastes.  Next time I will probably only use 3/4 cup sugar.

This is very tasty. I like the vanilla added in to the mix. The recipe I usually use doesn't call for vanilla. I did put about a 1/2 cup of coconut in the topping too. But I'm a coconut fan. Thanks for the recipe!

A tad too sweet for my tate as a side but I made it the second time in a graham cracker pie crust and was an excellent dessert. If I make it again as a casserole I'll cut back the sugar and a cinnamin

Phenomenal!  I made this for Thanksgiving this past year and even those who are not fans of sweet potato dishes LOVED this dish! It is sweet and could even be considered a dessert but that was part of the indulgence of the day!

This will be my only Sweet Potato recipe for Thanksgiving from now on.  Everyone loved it.  Even the coconut haters didn't mind the coconut because they said the topping was so delicious!

Love it.  Have made it for the past couple of years, always to rave reviews.  This year I chose to reduce both the white and brown sugar by about half, and it was still a crowd favorite!  

Also, don't be scared by the coconut, coconut-haters, you HARDLY notice it!

Wow could not begin to describe this dish. A fan of sweet potato myself has found the best recipe for it. I love the way it tastes! It is great for dessert or with a side dish. It was so good I am looking for excuses to make it again. Thanks Helen!

So funny, I have this recipe in a community cook book. Just happen to see this here.
I have to leave out the coconut and I decreased the butter for the crumble since it seemed 
I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas per request from my dad. He loves it.
Such a great tasting and easy recipe.

I've been making this dish for my family for 10+ years. Everyone loves it and I get requests for it for multiple holiday meals. The recipe is perfect as is, but occasionally I'll use walnuts instead of pecans if I have walnuts handy.  Also, be sure to use a fresh bag of coconut or it'll be a bit crunchy like another reviewer said.

this fluff is AMAZING! the only thing I did differently, is I only added about 1/4 cup of the white sugar. I think from now on I will just omit the white sugar completely unless I want a dessert.

This is VERY sweet - can be used as a dessert. That being said, my boyfriend and his sister HATE sweet potatoes, but they love this dish! I am asked for the recipe whenever I make this for a gathering.

VERY greasy.  I would suggest cutting the butter in half.  Also, my husband was not a huge fan of the coconut.
