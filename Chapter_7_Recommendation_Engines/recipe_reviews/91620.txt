These were good mashed potatoes; I did have to up the amount of milk some, and then ended up putting in some sour cream too. Served them with Beef, Burgundy Style, Buttery Cooked Carrots, & Zesty Marinated Asparagus, all from this website and it was a very nice combination.  Thank you!

This was another great way to use up our large basil plants. I used olive oil instead of butter and doubled the pesto. I used the 'Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto'recipe from this website. I found they needed a little extra salt (though this may have been due to not using butter). Thanks!

Pretty yummy!  I like the flavor of pesto so I used more of it (3 tablespoons for 2 yukon gold potatoes), and a couple of handfuls of pecorino romano cheese, and a couple of pinches of salt and pepper.  Great way to use up extra pesto!

What a great idea and new twist on mashed potatoes! This was unusual but delicious, flavorful and pretty - I'm so glad to have found another use for pesto. I didn't measure, just added the pesto to taste along with extra butter. This was a nice accompaniment to "Roasted Lemon Herb Chicken," also from this site.

These potatoes were really good.  I used red potatoes and just left the skin on.  I followed LadyJayPee's advice about using a bit of sour cream.  I also used lots more pesto- probably about 1/2 cup.  We had this with our St. Patrick's Day meal.  My baby could not get enough of these!  Everyone liked them.

Wonderful! I used the Knor Creamy Pesto sauce packet. It is high sodium, so won't make often but it's a fun change from the standard. (Using homemade pesto would be much lower sodium, but too expensive for our budget!). Served with broiled tilapia & poured the remaining pesto over that. What a treat.

My daughter made this as part of our Mother's Day meal. The only thing she did differently was to add in some black pepper. Very tasty and all the better because I didn't cook them. Many Thanks.

Delicious twist on mashed potatoes!  I added a little parmesan cheese to the mix, and served it with grilled chicken and veggies for dinner.  My husband loved it.

I was really happy with this.  I ended up serving a quick Chicken a la King over them and the pesto added a nice bit of flair to the dish overall.    I like my potatoes a little mushier though so had to be a bit more liberal with the milk.  It was a quick and easy recipe that I'll be saving though!

These are okay for a change from the norm. But they need a lot more butter, milk and pesto. And salt! If you do that they would probably be pretty good. I did add extra butter but I was in a hurry and didn't taste them before I served them and they were very dry. Oops!

I didn't feel there was nearly enough flavor to these, but pesto is really too high calorie to add any more.  I will not make these again.

These had WONDERFUL flavor!  I doubled the pesto, only because I love it, not because I thought it was too bland with the original amount.  Great recipe!

I wanted to make Art Smith's Scalloped Potatoes with Sun Dried Tomato Pesto to compliment a roast but didn't have 2 ovens.  This was a wonderful alternative.  Using Yukon Gold potatoes will give it a more buttery taste and I used chicken broth instead of milk.  Sprinkle a little parmesan on top and yum!

These were a really nice change from ordinary mashed potatoes. Tastes just like you would expect it to... pesto and mashed potatoes.

Mashed potatoes are always a hit at my house.  I loved this pesto version of the classic dish.
