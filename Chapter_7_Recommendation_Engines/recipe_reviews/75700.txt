Changed a few things to make this better (for us) and the changes are what makes it 5 stars--as it is written and prepared, would only give it 3.5 or 4 stars.  First, diced the onions and sauteed the onions and garlic in extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil until browned and very tender, then added some beef boullion/base to give it a beef flavor and then added the mushrooms and tofu cubes, after they were cooked, used 12 ounces fat-free sour cream with the fresh dill as we didn't like how the cottage cheese didn't result in as creamy a sauce.  Because we used the beef/boullion/soup base, we left out the soy sauce.  We also used whole wheat wide noodles.

I changed this recipie to suit my family I added a lot more mushrooms and used a little cream and ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I also used more garlic. My family loved it! They asked me to make it again soon

We all rated this a 4, good but not great. I made the following changes: only 1 pkg tofu (which still fed 4), whole wheat noodles, lowfat ricotta for cottage cheese, nonfat yougurt for sour cream, and only 1 T soy sauce. It was simple to make but the tofu took longer to brown than I expected - start it a few minutes BEFORE you put the water on to boil for the noodles. My noodles were done way before the rest of the dish.

This was a really tasty way to make stroganoff minus ground beef. I made it for my boyfriend and even though he isn't the biggest fan of tofu he loved it!

I did make some minor adjustments to the recipe because I didn't have cottage cheese on hand. I used ricotta cheese and extra sour cream with about a 1/4 cup of milk. I did add a little more soy sauce than the recipe called for. 

Just an fyi- make sure to put butter on your egg noodles after you drain them so they don't stick. I forgot and had clumps of noodles. :) 
 
I would make this again and try it with the cottage cheese.

My young family loves this dish, even the 3 year old.  I used whole wheat noodles.  I used about 1/2 cup sour creme because we did not have cottage cheese.  I had basil on hand so I used that instead of dill.  It is the soy sauce that gives it the good flavor.

I used all sour cream, and lots of dried dill.  Also about 4 big cloves of garlic.  It was scrumptious and we fought over the leftovers!

Very tasty recipe. The dill adds a nice flavour. I added extra sour cream, and also added a small amount of tomato paste to the sour cream/cottage cheese mix for extra flavour.

Too bland for my taste. I suggest doubling or tripling amount of onions, garlic, dill & soy sauce.

The flavor was very good and tasty. I converted the ingredients to a 2 people meal instead of 4. I followed all steps in recipe. The only down side that I find is that it came out very dry. I am definitly making it again but this time I will add more sour cream or cottage cheese.

I have been looking for more ways to incorporate tofu into our diet since three of us don't eat meat or poultry.  We really enjoyed this recipe almost exactly the way it was written. I used whole wheat noodles.  I also only used one package of tofu diced up. We will definitely be using this recipe again.

As it stands it was average.  Nice.  It's 3 star and that is the rating I gave it here.  The changes I made which make it a 5 star for us was simple. First I used good quality portabellos.  Next I used House brand Steak Tofu which I froze and pressed well before browning.  I lost the oil and pammed the skillet very well.  I did add a couple tsp of water when I added the onion and garlic together to the tofu.  Softened then added the mushrooms.  I did not remove the tofu at any time.  I also didn't have to add any more water.  Oil would work just fine with this. I added 2 tbsp nutritional yeast [NOT Brewers yeast no matter what anyone tells you ok?] and I used Braggs which is a 'soy sauce' that is very low in sodium which allowed me to up the amount of soy.  Without Bragg it would have been way too salty with the increase.   I used 2 tbsp in the mushroom part.  I used another 2 tbsp mixed in with the cottage cheese mix to which I also added the nutritional yeast.  I also added several turns of fresh ground melenge pepper.  Oh and I used Tofu noodles instead of Egg Noodles because the other half can't have eggs unless it is whites.  I added the tofu noodles well drained and rinsed several times with the cottage cheese mix and folded gently.

I love stroganoff and thought making it with tofu would be awesome.  I read all the reviews before deciding on this recipe.  I did not stray from the original recipe.  I am not an inexperienced cook.  What I ended up with was a glob of goo.  I have never been upset when a recipe does not turn out the way I imagined, but I have also never had such a failed recipe.  I'm posting a picture, hopefully you'll be able to see what made us throw this away.  I can't believe I wasted money on this

This recipe was good, but a little too much tofu for me.  Next time, I will make two adjustments -- 1 package of tofu instead of two and more soy sauce (really wonderful flavor).

Guys, if you are ending up with a watery mess, you must remember to press your tofu!! This was a pretty decent meal. I only used one package of tofu. I am not a fan of cottage cheese so I also used ricotta instead. The soy sauce gave this the flavor that it needed, but if you are not a vegetarian, I would recommend adding a little beef bouillon for that extra depth. I was going to rate this 3 stars, pretty average, but since my husband loved this dish I bumped it up to 4. He has never given a big thumbs up to a vegetarian dish before! Thanks for sharing!

Recipe needs tweeking.  Key to a non-goo texture is browning the tofu well on all sides and not over-stirring the stroganoff while it cooks.  I used only sour cream, no beef stock but a dash of worchestershire sauce which lends a 'meaty' flavour to a recipe.  There's the bones of a good recipe but as reviewers indicate, everyone will probably have their own 'take'.

5 stars with adjustments. I read comments, added more soy sauce AND, 1/4 cup of red wine, 1 TBSP of Worcestershire Sauce and a squirt of yellow mustard. (my dads old recipe) i halved this recipe, but kept the full amount of mushrooms (big fan). Turned out a little runny and i kept adding cottage cheese and sour cream until i thickened it up a bit with whole wheat flour. very excellent meatless recipe!

Tasty!  I pressed my tofu first, between two cutting boards, propped on a towel, draining into the sink.  I also allowed the tofu to simmer longer with the other ingredients for a more blended flavor.  While it is not reminiscent of beef, this is a really nice family dinner.

This was a great meal.  I would recommend broiling the tofu instead of frying to remove excess water.  We spent almost an hour cooking down two packs of tofu - it would have taken maybe 20 min in the broiler!  Which is another thing...there are only two of us in my house, so next time we will half this recipe.  We were eating this for a week!

I didn't use the cottage cheese and doubled the liquids and spices.  I am wondering how others had so much, even too much liquid at the end.  I would have liked more actually.  All in all very good just need to tweek it for more sauce. Thanks for posting this!

I am so sorry.  I tried the recipe as is, and it was just not to my liking.  I tried "spicing" it up a bit, using the different variations suggested by others, and it just wouldn't work.  I certainly appreciate the effort the cook made to make a different dish with tofu.  It was just very bland and just not tasty.  I'm so sorry!

I have made this a couple times.  I have never followed the recipe exactly but it is an easy and yummy way to cook tofu and mushrooms and use up cottage cheese!  I am only cooking for one so I make modifications that way.  Instead of sour cream I use plain nonfat greek yogurt

This is so good and easy. I added more sour cream and cooked longer on simmer so all flavors came together. I served this over brown rice.

I think maybe some of the problems people had was not frying the tofu well enough... that would eliminate the water issue. I kept the frying heat pretty high until the tofu was lightly browned but not dried out. I also put tomato paste in with the cheese/sour cream mixture for a bit of extra kick. This recipe has potential - it's a good update on a classic dish. YAY

the flavors in this were excellent! I too doubled the dill and soy sauce. I also ran the cottage cheese, cream and onions/garlic through the food processor to have a smoother sauce. Be really careful to heat the mixture just through or it will do funky things. I also added some peas which improved the aesthetics.

There was a lot of preparation that went into this recipe and like the other reviews said, it was lacking a little bit in flavor. I wish I had listened and added more garlic or other herbs, but overall it was pretty good. I may try to make it again

This was yummy, but as I was without dill the real kick in this dish came from the soy sauce.  I think next time I might just slice the tofu to make it easier to brown and then cube it afterwards.

Very good!  I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream, and omjtted the dill.  I was a little worried about how the cottage cheese would turn out, but it turned out great!  I will definitely add this to my "regulars".

This was really good.  I tried it using plain yogert instead of sour cream cheese so I don't think it was as saucy as it could have been, but the flavor was really good, and my husband and I liked it and will make it again.

I honestly don't know what I did wrong but this dish came out horrible for me.  I did read over the reviews and even added some beef bullion but still nope, it was just horrible.  no one in my family liked it.

I followed some suggestions, I only used yogurt, used some beef bullion.  I love Beef stroganoff and think next time I will either leave out the tofu or fry it and add it in later for a firmer texture. I also added black pepper at the end.

This was great! My husband didn't know exactly what it was but said it tasted a lot like stroganoff! I added more garlic, less tofu, and some other spices to liven it up a bit. We'll definitely make this again!

For Stephersnees, who commented about the use of Tofu, I wonder if soft tofu was used instead of firm or extra firm, it really makes a difference.

Very very good. I mixed some extra soy sauce into the tofu at the beginning to help brown. I also used a container of sour cream instead of the cottage cheese. Yummy!

Looking at some of the pictures and reading the reviews, thought I'd point out to be sure and buy extra-firm tofu. After you drain it, give it a rinse, shake off as much water as you can, then lay on top of a couple of folded paper towels. Put a few folded towels on top, then slightly squish between two plates. You want to pull out the excess moisture which is making it too wet and as one reviewer mentioned "goo". After it's cut into cubes, I'd put it between paper towels and VERY gently squish some more. Don't press so hard you distort the shape. This helps to make tofu cooking more successful. Make sure you saute it on all sides until it's golden brown. Also, you can make a roux with equal amounts of flour and butter (1-2 tablespoons) and paprika, then add to the liquid in your pan to thicken it up. If you still don't like the flavor, consider adding a tablespoon or two of tomato paste. I think that might help a lot.

sorry but i really didn't find this recipe appealing at all. i had to add sugar because it's so sour, put in 2 bullion cubes and some salt because it's so bland, and put in a packet of Ikea's gravy to make it gravy-like, similar to traditional stroganoff. i probably would use beef next time & find a really good recipe. this one wouldn't be missed by me or my husband.

I really didn't like this recipe at all. At first added all ingredients as indicated and it was way too bland, so I added more soy sauce. Well that made it taste really off. However, my boyfriend and uncle both loved it, so maybe it just wasn't my taste.

I made it exactly as written here and it was delicious!  This one is going into our regular rotation.  The only thing I noticed was that we didn't need to cook the whole bag of egg noodles, we had a bunch leftover.  Next time I will probably only make 2/3 of the bag.

Mostly I'd say this recipe was edible. I just think it needed something and I'm not sure what that is. If I make this again, I'll use beef boullion as someone else did and omit the soy. As it was, I did make a few changes. Fat-free cottage cheese and reduced fat sour cream, more soy and more garlic. I also used less onion than called for because hubby doesn't like the texture. I felt that the taste of the mushrooms was completely lost so maybe more mushrooms? Hubby hasn't tried it yet, but I'd be willing to bet he'll agree with me.  Really wanted to like this in spite of my apprehension over trying this recipe, but I'm just not a fan. As it has so many good reviews, it may all just be in my own personal tastes.

I read a few reviews that said the cottage cheese makes it an unpleasant texture. I didnt want it to turn out yucky so I played it safe and made it more traditionally. I didnt have sour cream, so I used milk and vegetable boullion instead of broth and cream. After sauteing the veggies, I added about 2 cups of milk and a boullion cube. I then simmered it down for about 15-20 mins. When it was almost done I dissolved 2 tbsp of flour in 1/3 cup milk (so it didnt get chunky) and then stirred it in to thicken the sauce. It turned out great!

First recipe I've ever followed on this site. I'm not a food connoisseur, in fact I have little experience when it comes to cooking, but this looked easy enough and I had all of the ingredients.  I followed the main recipe but used olive oil and didn't use the cottage cheese, and it turned out a little too watery, so maybe I'll add the cottage cheese next time.   Was good though.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe!!  The only changes I made were that I only used 1 block of tofu and I eliminated the cottage cheese and used fat free sour cream instead.  It was wonderful!

i really enjoyed this recipe. i used herb firm tofu and added a small can of cream of mushroom soup to give it more flavour. you can keep adding more sour cream until it suits your tastes.

This was an easy and healthy way to get the taste of stroganoff.  Even my meat-loving husband enjoyed it.  While I did not enjoy the texture of the cottage cheese, I think I would use ricotta next time to alleviate this.  Thank you for sharing. :-)

This was pretty good.  I used ricotta cheese and sour cream instead of cottage cheese as a previous reviewer recommended, but I thought the texture of the ricotta cheese was grainy and unpleasant in this dish.  I can't imagine the texture of cottage cheese would be any better.  Next time I'll probably just use sour cream.  I also thought that the dill was a really odd flavor combination with this dish; it was somewhat overpowering.  I would go easy on it if you use it at all.

Good - it actually tastes like real stroganoff.

This was pretty good, but maybe missing something? Perhaps I'll use more onion, garlic, salt, pepper and soy sauce next time.  I really liked the dill, and I think I would like a more instense flavor over all.  Definately worth making if you like stroganoff but want it meatless; like I mentioned, I would amp up the flavor a bit more.  Will make again.

A good recipe but I think the soya sauce overpowers the flavor. Will use less next time,

This recipe is great as is!  We make this often as a standard and it's wonderful and more healthy than typical stroganoff.

I felt the original recipe is bland.  I added a little extra sour cream, and then after tasting, added some salt and cayenne pepper, and extra garlic.  That helped, but I still felt it lacked excitement.  My husband added even more cayenne pepper and some garlic powder and then said he really liked it.  So given that the recipe seems to need  serious tweeking to taste good, I give this a 3.  i will probably try this again, but play around with the recipe some more, maybe try tomato paste like a few others did.

i thought this recipe was pretty good .. something different to do with tofu.  the recipe would  have been great as is, i just made a few adjustments to my liking.  i used whole wheat pasta instead of egg noodles, about a 1/2c of sour cream (instead of the 2 TB), added 1/4c ricotta cheese, 1TB soy sauce (instead of the 2), 4 garlic cloves and dried dill.  i def would make this again!

Like some of the other reviewers, I found this a bit bland. It just seems to lack some "oomph". Next time I might just try adapting my usual beef stroganoff recipe. For a quick and easy to prepare healthy meal, however, it's not bad.

Found this to be bland. It was OK, but not worth the work.

I was excited for this dinner, but it ended up tasting so bland, and the sauce was not at all creamy.  I almost feel like I'm missing something.

A little bland for my taste.  My husband had never had tofu and he enjoyed it.  Might be pretty good with the right spices.
