This was soooooooooooooo much easier than I ever thought! I used the Panko bread crumbs, the crunch was amazing. I started it on the stove top and once the chicken was nice and brown, transferred it to a 350 degree oven for about 20-25 minutes----inside temperature was 160.

The Mornay sauce was not difficult at all and added that somethin-somethin to the finished product....tasty too!

This was recipe #4 that I made from Allrecipes.com and so far every single one out did the other...I don't know how to top this or what to make tomorrow!

Very easy to make.  Tastes terrific. I made it for friends for the first time ever, and they were very impressed.
