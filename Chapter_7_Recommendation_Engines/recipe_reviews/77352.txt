I cook for people I work with a lot. And every year, about this time, I get constant requests for pies. I tried out this recipe, wanting to branch away from what I normally make, and it was a huge hit. Now people are constantly asking when I'm next going to make this delightful pie.

Easy, very! I made this even easier with a homemade chocolate wafer crust. I also used super chunk peanut butter because that's all I had on hand. For my husband, there was not near enough peanut butter. The kids didn't care, they just liked to have something sweet. This was a nice recipe to try to make with on hand ingredients for a cheap dessert, but not something I'll make again without adjustments. Maybe more peanut butter in the actual pie? It's almost there. I'll play with the recipe and re-review with my changes or submit a new recipe with my changes.

Very good pie - I used an oreo crust instead of graham cracker crust.  You do get the true taste of peanut butter and chocolate together.  I garnished with some grated chocolate and dry roasted peanuts.

Super easy VERY yummy!  It's a very rich desert so no need to supplement with ice cream or garnished, nor do you need to eat a lot to be satisfied.

We loved this pie!!! I don't even like PB that much but it's a chocolate lover dessert for sure! But what I like the most was that it's sooo easy and quick to  make. 
I used chocolate chips instead. Here are the equivalents..3 tablespoons chocolate chips OR 1 square (1-ounce) unsweetened chocolate plus 1 tablespoon sugar can be substituted for 1 square (1-ounce) semi-sweet chocolate.

Delicious and super easy to make.  It is a little runny and hard to cut, but it's so good nobody minds!  I suggest leaving it in the freezer until just before you serve.

I doubled this recipe to make two pies and ended up with two heaping pies and quite a bit of filling left over. I would suggest that the whipped topping be cut in half, or even entirely left out. This would make for an even richer pie, but I would prefer to simply have a smaller piece than to dilute the filling with the whipped topping. Perhaps this is because I truly love chocolate and peanut butter, and I think they ought to be showcased by this pie. The whipped topping really adds very little in my opinion. I think the solution to this pie's richness is instead a tall glass of milk served with a slice.

This pie is amazing. My Aunt use to make a pie just like this for holidays. Now that I've moved across country and can not go home for the holidays I miss it every year. So glad to have made a pie that is as good as hers!
