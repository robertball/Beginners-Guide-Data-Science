Followed recipe exactly since it was the first time I made it.....chipotle adds a nice kick. Chef John never disappoints. Corn pudding made a nice change from rice or pasta. Great date night meal.
Thanks for sharing!

This is wonderfully delicious! I served mine over polenta and my husband’s over mashed cauliflower since he eats low carb. Used Splenda brown sugar, smoked paprika and low carb ketchup. We love it when our food bites back a little! The sweet and acid really balanced out the spiciness well.

I haven't even made it and I'm disappointed. His sauce was literally the low budget way people make sweet and sour. I dont have to make it to know it would taste off. Plus, he seared the shrimp without even as much as a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Thats a Chef "No No".... The picture looked delicious. The video showed a grave disappointment.

I really wanted to like this recipe because i was excited by the smoked paprika and dried chipotle. However, I’m sorry try to say it’s a disappointment. The sauce just tasted like ketchup! Would not recommend and would not make again.

The sauce taste too much like ketchup. I was worried about this going into it but figured the other ingredients would blend with the ketchup and make it indistinguishable, but it didn't. Just tasted like ketchup on top of shrimp.

Super yummy. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and served it with the corn custard which was a perfect compliment. It was spicy but not overly so.  Totally a keeper.

It was one of the best recipes ever! I use shrimp from Argentina. It was a little sweeter.

I used seafood stock instead of making shrimp shell stock. It turned out fine. I too used tomato paste instead of ketchup. I cut back on the cayenne and added more paprika. 
I prepared more sauce and served the shrimp ragu over orzo which turned out great. 
A keeper.

This was kind of a lot of work (deveining & peeling shrimp, and then making the shrimp stock) -- but my boyfriend and I loved it. I wish I had more for leftovers!

I made this with the corn custard, which I think makes for a perfect flavor combo (salty & creamy with sweet & a little tangy).

Use a shrimp deveining tool to speed up the process!

This recipe is good. I prepared it with pappardelle and it was great. Now, given that this is a recipe that is very spicy and that I can't eat too spicy, I had to adjust it.  I used only about a third of the spicy hot ingredients and did not use chipotle pepper. It was just spicy enough for me and very tasty. I would give a shot to this recipe with tomato paste instead of ketchup and see the outcome. Oh I also reduced the amount of sugar only used 1 tsp. Just great.

I left out the ketchup and just used tomato sauce, and made polenta for the side. Came out pretty good.
