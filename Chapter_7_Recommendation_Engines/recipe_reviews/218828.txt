Good recipe but needs a few modifications.  First, since it calls for 2lbs of sausage, you need to either double up on sauce or just use 1lb of sausage.  If you make the sauce as the recipe calls for it, you will end up with lots of sausage but not enough red sauce.  I used 1lb of mild sausage & 1lb of italian sausage with a 45oz jar of pasta sauce.   To the sauce, I also added oregano.  The sauce turned out great!  The ricotta cheese mixture is good as is, but I simply added a tad each of salt, pepper, & oregano.  This recipe made a huge dish of lasagna that was wonderful!!

Amazing dish! Best lasagna I've had in a long time. I did change a few things: added mushrooms, 3/4 sausage 1/4 ground beef, added pepper and oregano. I would strongly suggest trying this dish.

Great, easy lasagna recipe!  I made this last night and the picky eater teenagers loved it!  One thing I did differently is added Italian Seasoning to the top instead of Oregano.

I found this to be watery-most likely from having the spinach in it. Also thought there needed to be more cheese. I would probably double the cheese next time.

amazing recipe!  Even my picky five year old loved it.  Super simple and delicious on its own or you can add to it to change it up.  This is going in to regular rotation.

This recipe is good just as it is written. When you start with good sausage, there is no need to drown it in too much sauce.

What an easy and tasty dish!  I made this pretty much to the letter with just a little touch of my own of fresh grated nutmeg and Italian seasoning to the ricotta mixture.  I believe that you should always use fresh nutmeg any time you make lasagna :-)  The entire dish came together in no time and baked up beautifully.  
Even though I usually make my own lasagna that I have been making for several decades, I enjoyed this one very much!

First time making lasagna and this was a hit with my family! Great recipe! Instead of using a can of pasta sauce, I used another recipe on this website to make my own and it gave it that special homemade added taste :) Great recipe!
