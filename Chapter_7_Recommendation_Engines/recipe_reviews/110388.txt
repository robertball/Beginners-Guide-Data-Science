These were very good, we live about 45 miles from Springfield and go there often and love the different diners etc., and always buy horseshoes wherever we decide to eat.  Some are better than others and unique in there own way.  Some use turkey, ground beef etc., I have replicated them at home and they come out pretty good, I do make homemade fries though, just think they taste better.  These are very good though, and thank you for the post.

This is nothing like the horseshoe sandwich we have. I live about 3 hours from Springfield, right on the Wabash river (IL side). Ours has bread on bottom, with a hamburger patty, fries, and cheddar cheese sauce poured over the top. It is not the exact original Horseshoe sandwich, but there should not be bread on the top, b/c it is meant to be an open faced sandwich.

I really enjoyed this!  The ONLY thing is it's a little dry for my taste and needs some sort of condiment.  Also instead of melting the cheese I put it on top of the fries on the sandwich and threw the whole thing in the oven a couple of minutes.  Yum!

Not eaven close to the orignal take if from someone who is from Springfield IL where the horseshoe comes from.  Its from the Old Leland hotel in 1928.

Look at the recipe "Horseshoe" for a more authentic version. My recipe comes from the Leland Hotel--the original version.I add a Tabs. of Lea and Perrine's and about a cup of beer to my sauce--not half and half. Sauce can be a s thick as you like. Real Horseshoe sandwiches use Cheddar-not American cheese!

We thought this was a DELICIOUS lunch snack! It takes a little while to prepare, but the result is FABULOUS! This is an ingenious recipe! It's crunchy, it's soft, the different tastes just blend together!
