This recipe is very tasty.  A very good potato salad to try away from the normal version.

I like the idea of adding escarole (as in wilted green salads) but this recipe seems to have several ingredients missing- onion, sugar.  It was very vinegary.  I ended up making a more tradtional dressing and tossed with the bacon-potato-vinegar mixture to salvage the dish.

Awesome!.. I didn't have a lb of bacon, although I probably would have cut that in half... I used what I had which was about 3 slices,next time I'll use more.  I also didn't have escarole, so I sliced up celery and added it to the hot bacon to cook a little towards the end.  I also added salt, pepper and a little paprika for the top.. The flavors of egg, bacon, celery combined with the vinegar were delicious!.. The vinegar mellowed as it sat for a while... I will make this again!

Fantastic!  I added Kalamata olives, celery, and onion to the recipe - and it was a knock-out!

Without the eggs, this is a recipe my Grandmother made quite often when I would visit her.  Brings back a huge amount of nostalgia and I'll be trying it with eggs tomorrow!

I like the idea of no sweetener and with all that bacon I know why no salt was used.  But for health reasons, I had to replace the drippings (with all the saturated fats) with olive (or other healthy) oil I had on hand.  I might try to swap the low sodium bacon for low sodium ham or turkey in the future.
