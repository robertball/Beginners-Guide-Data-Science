Skeptical before making but this turned out surprisingly tasty, simple, quick, and healthy to boot. Subbed Taco Seasoning I from this site rather than using commercially made brands. If feeding people with appetites of sparrows or who are dieting, the portion size will probably be fine. Otherwise, consider whether a ‘serving size’ of 2 tortillas with minimal filling will be enough unless serving side dishes. The AR photo is misleading as there is no way that is 1/8 of the tortilla filling in each shell (i.e., 1/8 of a medium onion and 3/8 of a mushroom cap). If making again, use at least 4 large mushroom caps (1 per person) and 1 large or 2 medium onions. Fantastic recipe when wanting lighter fare, especially during the hot summer months.

Meh.  Using mushrooms as a taco "meat" is a really good idea.  It's a good idea, but the seasoning was way too salty. I might make this again, using my own salt-free taco seasoning.  I made my own whole wheat tortillas.

This recipe sounded a little odd to me at first but it turned out delicious!  My husband is not a huge mushroom fan but he loved these and asked for them again a day later.  I made the recipe exactly as written except we didn't have queso cheese so we just sprinkled some Kraft mexican blend cheese on top - it was delish!  We will definitely be making this again.

My new favorite tacos!! I used cumin , chili powder , garlic salt, pepper and oregano for the spices . Next time I will roast pepper in oven first so I can remove the skins. Corn tortillas and some queso fresco. Delish! It was even better the next day. Thanks for sharing .

Made these tonight and they were excellent! I used corn tortillas, lightly fried. For toppings I used homemade guacamole, some Greek yogurt, and a sweet salsa to balance the earthiness of the tacos (any fruity salsa like mango should do.) My wife and I both loved them and never felt like the mushrooms were just a substitute for meat. The mushroom and onion combination made this a complete dish and we did not miss the meat at all.

So delish!!  Its definitely a keeper.  I made it with only a few substitutions.  Large yellow onion (all I had on hand) and used Baby Bella Mushrooms that were on sale.  Other than that, no changes.

I made this tonight. It was very good. My meat eating husband had two. I think I used tortillas that were too large. My suggestion is to triple (or even more) the recipe. I used 8 ounces of baby bells mushrooms and they cooked down considerably. Next time I'll use 24 or 32 ounces.

This was fabulous!!  I will double it next time because my crew had two tacos each and wanted more. Although I forgot to prepare a side dish which may be the reason, but will certainly make these again. The only thing I added was cumin, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper to the onions while they cooked. I also added the water to the taco seasoning mix prior to adding it to the mixture.

Really easy to make and very tasty! My husband and I both enjoyed this quick, delicious meal. Used Baby Portabellas because it's all we could get. Served it with homemade guacamole. Yum! Will definitely make this again!

I made Salome small changes. I added green bell pepper and used jalapeño cheese. It was delicious!
