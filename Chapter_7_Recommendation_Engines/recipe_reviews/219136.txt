This was a great interpretation of Butterbeer. I always imagined it just a little richer and creamier, but pretty close. Essentially, this was a butterscotch soda. They're a little hard to finish. It was VERY sweet, and is definitely a thing of moderation, but as they sat and separated, I thought they lost some of the overwhelming sweetness and got better and better. This would also be great with a shot of rum per glass, maybe mixed with the syrup instead of the cream soda. It would make it authentic.

Wow these were very sweet. I would almost even half the amount of brown sugar/cream mixture. But very tasty too.

I've seen this recipe floating around the internet and tried making it a while back. You end up with a delicious but VERY sweet drink. My husband and I both have a major sweet tooth, but it was too much for us to finish one glass. I think if we tried it again, we'd skip the whipped cream part and/or dilute the syrup a bit by using twice the cream soda and turning it into 8 servings. It looks very pretty if you use the whipped cream topping, so it makes a great party drink!

Fantastic recipe. I prefer this drink to what you get at The Wizarding World at Universal.

This caramel sauce is fantastic, and combined with cream soda & whipped cream it gives you a reason to drown any remaining sorrows you have over not receiving your Hogwarts letter. I might rock the boat next time & use a vanilla milkshake instead of cream soda... oh my goodness, just wonderful. I will say, one of my 4 kids couldn't finish because it was too sweet. She's probably destined for Slytherin though.

Yummy, but I agree it was too sweet to drink much of it. I added a little extra cream to the soda mixture, which tempered the sweetness and gave it extra richness. I also added a splash of rum to mine for a grown up version. Yum!

Surprisingly I didn't find this to be too sweet. It was really creamy and delicious. It was fun to make, but definitely a rich heavy drink. If you serve this with a heavy meal you'll be in a food coma for sure. Give it a try!
