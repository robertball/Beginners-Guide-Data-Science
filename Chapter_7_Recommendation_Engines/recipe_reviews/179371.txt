This was delicious! Very easy to make and satisfying. I did add a Tbsp of cider vinegar and a tsp of garlic powder for a little extra flavor/kick, but this was a great recipe and I'll certainly be making it again.

I've made this dozens of times... it's my "go to" recipe on busy nights. I add in some worscestshire sauce and lots more pepper, since we like those spices. Incredibly easy and nice to be able to whip up with ingredients you have on hand (who has sloppy joe sauce in the cupboard all the time?? not me!). My husband and 2 1/2 year old just love it!
