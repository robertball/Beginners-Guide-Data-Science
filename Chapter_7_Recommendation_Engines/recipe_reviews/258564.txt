Who would have thought corned beef hash in a quesadilla would turn out so good? We loved them!

These were delicious!  I used some left over homemade beef hash that I used up.  I also used Monterey jack cheese instead of Mozzarella, since that was on hand. We will have these again.

Without going overboard I can't say enough about this recipe. Fantastic flavors. These are a must make. Warm your tortillas in a tortilla warmer in the microwave for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes to make them pliable when folding prior to frying. I will try the cooking spray and a comal next time.
