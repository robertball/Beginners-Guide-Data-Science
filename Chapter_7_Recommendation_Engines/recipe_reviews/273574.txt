I used butter-flavored oil spray and used Old Bay with minced (dried) onions.  I grilled for 7 mins per side and it turned out pretty well.  I might try a different spice mix next time.  It was good but didnâ€™t knock me off my feet, so 4/5.  I might actually try marinading next time.

Quick, easy, and delicious.  Grilled two minutes a side to form a crisp and finished  on indirect  heat. Served with  sour cream and diced  green onions.  This is a good choice with burgers  or bratwurst.

These were simple to make and would go great with any grilled meat. I will make these often this summer.
