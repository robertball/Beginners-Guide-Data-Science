this recipe says, "heat without stirring, to 250 to 265 degrees F", and it burnt! Thanks for helping me waste about $7, and all that time!

If I could give this recipe a negative star rating, I would! First it calls for a NOT stirring it, which makes absolutely no sense to me, although we did not stir it and it melted just fine.  It also calls for a bunch of white sugar and barely any brown sugar so it comes out looking like a bunch of cooked grease.  Ours did not set up, we followed directions exactly and ended up with a huge sticky mess to dump out. Guess I am going back to my old recipe for caramels....at least I know it works!

I loved this recipe, though, I tweaked it a bit. I lost my old recipe for caramel when my computer crashed. I only use it to coat granny smith apples, before coating them in chocolate. I left out the additional cup of sweetened condensed milk. I stirred until it was at soft ball stage, then coated the apples. This doesn't get break-a-tooth hard when you refridgerate it, and was perfect. A tip for cleaning: run HOT water over the pan, it'll gradually melt the caramel away. Cold water just makes it that much harder to get clean.

Taste is excellent, but never set up enough to cut into cubes.
