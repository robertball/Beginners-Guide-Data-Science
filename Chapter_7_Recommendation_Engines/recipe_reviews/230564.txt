Very good recipe. Simple to do, but watch the scorching of the marshmallow cr√®me mixture before removing it from the stove top...very very important. Keep that whisk going to insure proper whisking. I had to turn my heating element down some in the process. However I couldn't find whole cashews, so I just used what I could find at the store. I could have done with more cranberries though. Everyone that tried it liked it a lot. Will make again ;-) but decreasing the vanilla just a tad.

I LOVE this fudge!! I've been making it for about 3 years. I've made it with and without nuts, with and without cranberries, and all variations are delicious. Follow the recipe to a T (boil 5 minutes) and it comes out perfect every single time. I recently read another fudge-maker's review that said not to stir the fudge during the boiling at all. I tried it and it did seem to make it silkier. Yum!
