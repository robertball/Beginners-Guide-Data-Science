This was just too easy and so good!  I made it exactly as written except I added a little frozen mixed vegetables.  Also, the dough was really sticky and hard to work with.  I think next time I would add just a little less milk.  Otherwise, really good and really easy.  My husband and I ate nearly the whole dish ourselves!

Loved this recipe.  It was so incredibly easy... I even made it easier by making the dumplings from refrigerated biscuit dough.  My husband LOVED it!

Very satisfying for a very cold night!  I must admit I did make some simple modifications though.      1) Substituted refridgerated biscuit dough instead of using the dry mix.    2) To begin, I sauteed onion and cut up pieces of chicken breast (don't like canned chicken), removed from pan and then re-added after the dumplings were almost cooked.    3) Added a can of corn (a must!)  4) Replaced one can of chicken broth for one can of condensed cream of chicken soup.    YUM, heated up the leftovers for lunch!

Holy cow!  This was easy and GOOD!  Next time, to add flavor, I will saute some onion, garlic, and celery as other's suggested.  We will definitely make this again!

My fiance and I loved this!

I halved the dumpling mix and I think I'll half it once more; we found there were too many for our taste.

I sauteed about 1/3c each of carrots, onion, celery and then threw the raw, cubed chicken in with that until it was cooked through. Then, I added the broth and brought it to a boil. I then dropped in the dumplings as directed and it turned out wonderful!

Great recipe!

I've made this twice and both times I've had great results.  Both times I've added a bag of frozen veggies and used leftover chicken.  Also if you add more broth (I think I added about 40 ounces) you get more of a chicken and dumplings soup.  For those with leftover dough make biscuits with it!  This is definitely an easy recipe base that will stay in my rotation.  Thanks!

When I read the recipe I was a bit skeptical.  And it didn't seem like 2 cans of chicken stock was enough.  But I followed the recipe to the letter and it was OUTSTANDING!!!!  This recipe is so good.  My 5 year old loved it and even asked for seconds!!  GREAT RECIPE!

This recipe was SUPER fast and easy, and TASTY!!! I sauteed onion and celery first, then added that along with a bag of frozen mixed veggies. I also added about a teaspoon of garlic. DELICIOUS, and I'll use this again. I might sub water for one of the cans of chicken broth just to prevent over-salting, but that's the only thing I'll do differently next time. Yum!

Absolutely the best!  Add some veggies, salt & pepper, a little seasonal salt and enjoy.  I always add extra broth and it turns out every time.  Rotisserie chicken pulled off the bone is the best for this recipe.  I purchase extra, pull it off the bone and freeze it for the next time I need to prepare this.  Delicious! My husband loves it!

Like others, I used real chicken breast. I boiled 4 breast for 30 minutes, removed the breast and let them cool a bit. While the chicken was cooling I sauteed carrots, celery and onion in a little olive oil. I then added the veggies to the water that the chicken was boiled in, along with the cut up chicken. I used the canned biscuits, tearing them into fourths. I had to add a little chicken broth after adding the dumplings. Delicious!!!

I made this with a couple of alterations.  1) Bought a can of biscuits instead of making my own 2) added 1 cup of shredded carrotts and 1 T chopped garlic to the chicken broth.  I served with rice.  It was delicious!

I rated 4 stars, not because the end result I made wasn't good, but because had I not tweaked like others and included some chopped carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and tarragon, it would have been decidedly bland.  Adding the extra items didn't really add any time to the meal over all, as I just did the dicing first, and made the dough while the pot was working up to a boil.  All the kids liked it, and they are picky eaters.  Most importantly, the wife liked it, and she grew up eating this stuff in NC from a family recipe!

Very easy and good.  My 6 yr old didn't like it, but he's one who doesn't like things touching.  And I think it would be better with a couple cut up chicken breasts.

I have been making biscuit mix dumplings for years. I also try to keep my dough moist and just drop it from a spoon into the simmering water (push it off the spoon with my finger..lol). I think it makes a softer, melt-in-your mouth dumpling. My recipe is: In a stockpot: 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1 can of broth, a tbsp of butter, dash of milk.  Then I add a lot of water-about 4-6 cups (up to half of the tall pot)?  Whisk all together, bring to boil, reduce to low-to-med boil.  Dumplings are 2 cups biscuit mix, 1 cup milk - mix very well, drop into mixture about a rounded tsp at a time. I lightly press down the floating dumplings just to where the broth coats them as they cook. Helps them to cook faster. (I don't stir much during the dumpling phase, dropping them into the places where the bubbles come up the most and leave them alone for a couple mins to firm up.) Add one small can chicken (or your own cooked chicken) near the last of cooking time as it starts to stick to the bottom of the stock pot near the end when everything gets thick. Make sure the last dumplings in cook at least ten minutes.  Some of these dumplings disintegrate, but we love this so much.  I have a very picky eater, so no veggies added to this one (salad is an optional side when I serve this).  I do add lots of pepper and taste for needed salt.

Thank you, thank you, thank you busy mom.  This recipe is simply divine, and I do mean "simply". I literally had this on the table in 30 minutes.  And I even sautéed onions, carrots, and celery in a tablespoon of butter and two boneless skinless chicken breasts rather than canned.  My daughter said it was the best thing she ever ate.  Lol.

This was the first time I've ever made chicken and dumplings!  Our family LOVED this!  I added 26 oz. of canned chicken, 32 oz. of chicken broth, rice milk instead of cow's milk, onion & garlic powder, a touch of cumin & cayanne, and black pepper.  Next time I plan on adding sauteed onions, garlic, and celery.  Then adding carrots, corn, peas, and diced potatoes.  This was wonderful.

I was extremely surprised on how quick and easy this meal was.  In the end it was very delicious and can't wait to make it again!  The only changes I made was that I sauteed onions and carrots.  Then added the broth and chicken along with some diced up red potatoes.  I let it simmer and boil it bit longer then the recipe called for and then finally added the biscuit.  I also used the pilsbury dough ready made biscuits.  I didn't want too many so I only added half the can!  The whole thing took me 30 minutes and I highly recommended to everyone!!!

This was delicious, I sauted some carrots and garlic in a little butter before adding the chicken broth, then did everything just as it says turned out very good and full of flavor.

One reviewer said it best - it's similar to Cracker Barrels version of Chicken and Dumplings. I happen to love that recipe and this one was just as good. I made a few changes. I added carrots and onions. Instead of canned chicken, I used boneless thighs and boiled them first. This made the broth more flavorful, plus, I think boneless chicken tastes better than the canned version. 

We served ours over mashed potatoes. It filled up my 15 year old and that is nearly impossible some days!

This was pretty good!!! I had read that others added some veggies, which I failed to do... but I knew my husband wouldn't like it unless it was thick.... sooo... I added a can of cream of chicken, some milk, sour cream (you wouldn't think it would taste good, but it was delectable), and just a bit of butter. Oh and I didn't use all of the dough... maybe about 3/4 of the dough. Other than that, it tastes amazing.

Quick and easy?  Yes.  I followed the recipe for the dumplings.  I used boiled chicken.  It was a little bland and my dumplings were like little puffy biscuits.

I love how easy and tasty this is, and it makes for fantastic leftovers. The only thing I would recommend is cooking  the dumplings longer, the first time I made it they were a little doughy still on this inside.

This was a good base for knowing how to make the dumplings, as I had never done that before, but I improvised on the soup part.  Homemade chicken stock, cut up cooked chicken breasts, carrots, celery, onion, parsley, garlic powder made for a yummy soup.

Very yummy. As per other suggestions I added a can of cream of chicken soup and onions. Also, I did not add as much dumplings....just too many. This is a great base to start with.

Really simple and really good. I added 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter and a cup of water while the broth was coming to a boil. It really hits the spot! YUM :)

This was so easy and absolutely delicious. I did add a bit of butter to the pot to melt before adding the chicken stock and then I also added a can of peas and carrots. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for something quick and tasty!

My sister and I made this but it didn't come out as expected. I think we may have left it in the pot for too long because all of the juice was sucked into the dough. It still tastes pretty good though. Thanks!

I have not used this particular recipe, but I can tell you that Bisquick dumplings are amazing and so easy; I have been making them most of my adult life.  They are my comfort food, and can be made as a quick meal or snack with little effort or cleanup. Most of the time, I do not use more than just the broth when making them.  I like having enough broth that I get a creamy soupy like gravy in the end.  One thing I do when I make the dumplings is drop the dough off a spoon like when making drop biscuits rather than flattening them as in this recipe. Another thing is do not be tempted to add salt until they are done and you have tasted them, there is plenty in just the Bisquick mix and the broth.  If you have dumplings left over, remove them from the liquid when you put them in the refrigerator and they will not get hard and will have a better texture the next day.  If you have the broth mixture leftover, save it or freeze it to make soup or something like that later. It is too good to throw out.  I like to put frozen Grandma’s Egg Noodles in the broth mixture.  Enjoy, from a first time reviewer.

I made this using left over "hurricane" supplies (canned chicken).  It turned out wonderful.  I did add celery, onion, and carrot as other comments suggested.  I will add this to my hurricane season recipe box as most of the items needed are non perishable.  My husband thought it was some of the best chicken and dumplings he'd ever had.

I grew up on my grandmother's chicken and dumpling - the same recipe she learned from her grandmother. It would be really hard for me to duplicate the whole thing, and I've been searching for a good substitute for a while now. This one is awesome! I was a little skeptical about the amount of broth not being enough but it turned out just right. We will be making this one again!

Great starter recipe! I'm very new to cooking, but this was a fantastic recipe to build on. Personally, I used leftover chicken and 3 cups of homemade chicken stock with about a half cup of water. Then i added half a bag of mixed veggies. It was fantastic, and the dumplings cooked perfectly.

Yummy.  Added carrots, corn, and peas.  The dumplings seemed HUGE when I first put them in, but seemed to shrink as the soup cooked.  The soup also thickened, so I think some of the size of the dumplings dissolved and became "thickener".

Super good!  I served to my DH and he said "we need to make this more often!"  The only changes I made was to chop up some carrots and celery and saute them before adding the broth (1 32oz container).  I did use bisquick mix and baked 1lb of chicken that I shredded and added when I added the dough.  It was amazing!  Thanks for posting.

it was good. I added the celery, carrots and onion like the other reviews said, but to be honest, it wasn't thick enough for our taste. if it was thicker, it would've been better. Thanks!

Just tried this recipe. LOVE IT! It's easy and soooo much tastier than Banquet's chicken and dumpling kit (as well as canned chicken and dumplings, for that matter). My mom--whose cooking skills far exceed my own--loved it too and asked me to send her the recipe.

I chopped up some carrots, celery, added half a can of green beans, and about a cup of frozen peas. Yum! This recipe seems like it can be really versatile with lots of room for creativity. Definitely will be coming back to this one!

my family loved this.  i just had a baby and this was super easy to make for the now 5 of us.  i sauteed onion with carrot first, but would love to add celery next time.  I did have frozen mixed veggies and threw those in.  I also used the fridge biscuits for extra simplicity and was not disappointed at all. I have always loved chick n dumplins but never realized how simple they were to create!  one of these days when i have more energy i will use fresh chicken,  but for now even the canned tastes good in this recipe!

I would highly suggest using biscuit mix as the recipe calls for instead of using refrigerated biscuit dough, as some people have suggested. It doesn't cook through and the biscuits will be gooey inside. This was not my favorite recipe for Chicken & Dumplings, but it was okay.

Really Great and super easy, I thought it needed a little salt and pepper added though. I did use 1.5 Chicken breasts instead of the canned chicken and it was delish!

Hubby and another male friend LOVED this recipe!  I took a 48oz can of chicken broth, cut up some carrots and onions in the broth, added the 2 10oz cans of chicken and boiled this to cook the veggies.  I made the dumplings as the recipe states.  There wasn't much extra broth even with using the extra broth.  I will be making this again!

I give this five stars for being an excellent base. Just tried this out tonight and LOVED IT! The flour in the dumplings made for a very nice gravy my husband noted. I did at pepper, thyme and garlic. I sauteed onion, celery and carrots and added the liquid to that and let it soften the carrots for about 10 mins and then added the chicken and dumplings.  I think I'll try rotissierre (sp?)chicken next time around for a more succulent meat. For my first dumpling recipe I was impressed with myself.

Fantastic! For such an easy dish, it was excellent. I boiled my own chicken breasts, added some frozen mixed veggies and used Bisquick Heart Smart mix. I had hoped fpr leftovers, but my adult children showed up (conveniently at supper time!) and devoured this. Thank you for a simple,  great meal.

This was super easy & tasty! I didn't have any chicken broth, but used vegetable broth instead - which worked out fine.  I also added some carrots. It was a hit with my husband & 2 year old. Definitely will be repeating this recipe!

My husband was sick and wanted some chicken and dumplings.  My mother-in-law ALWAYS makes us chicken and dumplings when we are sick.  So I found this recipe and made it since I never made chicken and dumplings before.  We thought it was pretty good.  I added some carrots and celery and onions to it.

We are from the south and don't put veggies, etc. in our dumplin's, we would consider that a stew. Lotsa dumplins and that yummy chicken flavor is what we like. The only thing I did different was add a little poultry seasoning and a whole can of 10 hungry jacks flattened and torn into small pieces (I have trouble with the bisquick thing sometimes). Not as good as granny's, but real darn close and wonderful considering time and amount of ingredients - THANK YOU!!!!

This was an awesome recipe. So quick and so easy. I did add frozen carrots that I cooked slightly at the bottom of the pan with minced garlic and olive oil.. then followed the recipe exactly. This is definitely going to be made by me often this winter.. Thanks much :)

Delicious, easy, and yummy.  Perfect if you're in a hurry, also great for comfort food.  Next time I'll be making it w/my own cooked chicken, but the canned chicken isn't horrible.  Easy for a toddler to chew too.  Thanks!!

My husband and I didn't care for this recipe.  The dumplings are not that good and was rather salty.  I reduced the recipe to serve 2 people-maybe it lost something in the reduction.  I do not plan on making it again.

It is absolutely great! My family loved it. I have never pulled off chicken and dumplings until now. Took a bit longer than estimated, bit very worth it. Ended up adding a can or peas and carrots and a can of corn. Very yummy!

I cooked my chicken on the crock pot in the chicken stock. Then added carrots,onions,peas, and corn. I also added a chicken bullion  for extra flavor.  A little salt and pepper and it was perfect!  Will definitely make it again.

Unbelievably easy.  Used refrigerated biscuit dough for convenience and worked great.  Doubled it and subbed 1 can cream of chicken soup for 1 can of broth to make it a little thicker.  Added a dollop of sour cream just for kicks and bag of frozen veggies....served it over extra biscuits.   Really good, especially given how easy it was.

Recipe was great when there is the need for a really fast meal. For years I have used bisquick to make dumplings but I always add a small amount of poultry seasoning to the dough...really enhances the taste.

So easy it was almost embarrassing. It tasted great too, although definitely not a 'from scratch' taste, as others have commented. I think next time I've got a rotisserie chicken in the fridge I'll use that instead of canned.

My hubby requested chicken and dumplings, which is something I have never made nor ate before. I found this recipe and took the plunge. I boiled 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts in water/chicken broth. Once those were done I shredded them, seasoned generously with garlic powder, Lawry's, garlic salt and pepper and put them aside. In the pot, I left the water/chicken stock that was already there and added a bit more broth. When the broth came to a boil I added 1/2 bullion cube and the chicken. I also used the Bisquick mix for the dumplings. It came out SO good that my kids (6.5 and 3.5) gobbed it up and the hubs said it was better than his mom's :) Definitely a keeper!

This is really good for a quick meal, however I used leftover roast chicken, can of mixed veggies and Grands biscuits cut in quarters.  The Grands biscuits were much better than bisquick.  I never used canned chicken but suppose that would be good in a pinch.  I might keep some on hand.

This is a great recipe to start out with. And for seasoned cooks it makes a good starter. I used it as a guide. I cooked my own chicken ysing boneless skinless chx breast cooked in broth. I also used drop biscuit dough made from scratch instead of the pre made kind. I added 9 oz more broth and carrots and celery. I alao added herbs to my biscuit dough and broth. It was great! My kids and husband loved it

Great short cut for comfort food on a work night! I used boneless chicken breast instead of canned chicken (about 6 small cutlets I had on hand, I cooked them in a skillet first) and about 6 cups of broth will do it (I used 2 32-ounce boxes and it was MORE than enough!). I also mixed about 1/4 cup of Bisquik right in the broth to thicken it up. I set the table with the caveat "This will be the worst Chicken and Dumplings dinner EVER." but everyone loved it!

So the chicken I laid out ended up having freezer burn, so I had to come up with something quick. We had been out of town and I didn't have much in the pantry and no meat in the freezer. Looking through everything I found a 10oz can of chicken breast. I put that in Google and found this recipe. I knew I had Bisquick, milk and 1 can of chicken broth. I also had a can of cream of chicken soup, carrots, celery, onion, and spices. I improvised. I used all of the above. First I sauted the veggies and chicken in butter. I added onion salt, garlic powder and pepper. I added both cans of soup. I filled the cream soup can up with water 2 times to give more juice. Then did everything else the same. My whole family (husband and 4 kids) LOVED it! We only had enough for each person to have 1 serving and they were bummed. They told me to make it exactly the same again but double it.

This recipe was easy and my husband liked it. It is like chicken pot pie without the pie! I thought I had broth, but did not, so I used condensed cream of chicken with water. I sauteed onions and carrots before adding the broth and cubed chicken breast. After it was boiling, I added frozen peas. My only problem was my Bisquick dough was very sticky. (Maybe it needed more milk.) It was very hard to work with and most of it stuck to my hands.

Quick, easy and super tasty! I was very hesitant at first considering there were so few ingredients. I was afraid the sauce wouldn't thicken up since there were only 2 cans of chicken broth as the base - I was wrong! The only change was I added a can of veggies, as well. This recipe is a keeper!

I make this exactly as it's posted at least twice a month. It's my 8 year old daughters favorite dinner. She always goes back for 2nd and sometimes 3rds. She says its "way better" than Cracker Barrel!

This was so delicious! Instead of making dumplings from scratch I used biscuits in a can. I also put in some noodles, cut up celery, garlic powder and pepper. I sprinkled the top of it with basil and ground black pepper for look.

Very good & very easy, got raves from Hubby too. I used the Dumplings recipe from this site and added 1/3 c. onion puree, 3 small zucchinis, and about 10 baby carrots, diced. Topped it off with a little pepper, thyme, sage, poultry season and it was perfecto. Quick, healthy comfort food, yum!

VERY EASY!! I followed a few reviews I read and added onion, celery, carrots.  Also put in 1 can cream of chicken, a palmful of thyme, and used refrigerator biscuits instead of mix.  Will definitely make again!!!

This recipe was great. So easy to put your own twist on it. For those of you who said the biscuits are sticky, just add flower. (i added some to the broth too, i like mine thicker) with some mixed veggies sauteed onions & garlic and a touch of salt and pepper and its ALMOST as good as C&D i had growing up in NC. Enjoy :)

omg too good!! this was my first real attempt at chicken and dumplings and it was fantastic. i used some split chicken breasts that were in the freezer and added chopped celery and carrots about 1/3 cup each, i used an instant just add water bisquick mix (buttermilk blend) and mixed it with 1/2 a cup of milk then flattened the dough out in floured hands. oh and i added just a tiny bit of a slurry to thicken it up. cannot stop eating it!! gonna go get just a little bit more now!

Super easy! Super quick! 

I boiled my own whole chicken and pulled it off the bone. 
Cut up carrots, celery, onions, and potatoes. 
Boiled then with swansons broth
Then I used jiffy biscuit mix. 
Was perfect in 10minutes flat!

Yummy stuff! I like chicken and dumplings normally anyway but my husband does not. he did, however, love this dish! I boiled my own chicken and made my own broth out of it with sauteed onions, carrots, celery, and misc. seasoning. I also used biscuit dough soaked in coconut milk. It was so, so good!

I made in once using pillsbury biscuit dough and fresh cooked chicken and it turned are pretty good. The next time I "made my dough" and it turned out really bad. I don't make good pie crusts either :) I'm making it again with premade dough.

Excellent comfort meal and a good way to use leftover cooked (boned) chicken. I sauteed mushrooms in margarine, shook a little flour over it, and then went on with the chicken, broth, and Bisquik dough. I only used half the dough racipe, this seemd just right. I also shook a little poultry seasoning and cayenne into it. Even without my usual seasoning (jalopenos) it was YUMMY!

I made this one evening and I have to admit it was super easy and delicious. I made it again and it was a disaster (I think we can chalk that up to chef's error), and have therefore been afraid to make it again! Oops! :)

This is a great recipe. My husband was home sick with a stomach virus and this was perfect. I also sauted some onion, fresh garlic, and celery then added my broth. I also used 2 can's of plain chicken broth and 2 can's of roasted garlic chicken broth. Before adding my dough I added a little milk to the broth for a creamier gravy. Thanks for sharing this.

This was a great recipe!  The only thing I changed was sauteing onions celery and carrots in the pan before I started the recipe.  I also added a little extra broth since I had added those extra ingredients.  This was delicious and so easy!  My husband said it was the best chicken and dumplings he ever ate.  It is also very pretty in the pan as it cooks.  My husband kept sneaking peeks at it and telling me how much he couldn't wait to try it.  Great recipe!

Delicious, delicious deliciousness. I used a large 49OZ can of broth, a 25OZ can of chicken and a can of Pilsbury biscuit dough. I sauteed some onions, carrots, dill and garlic and put it in the boiling broth before I added everything else. All it needed in the end was a tiny pinch of salt. Thank you,Busymommy!

I'm not a huge fan of chicken and dumplings, but my husband is, so I made this for him.  I made it exactly like the directions and it turned out well.  It's not something I would get excited about eating, but it was good and he liked it.  Definitely a plus that you can make it so quickly!

I made this last nite and it was good.  I forgot to add the boullion but it was still good.  I used "Texas" style buttermilk biscuits and they were too sweet, I'll try a different brand of biscuits next time.  Also, all my dumplings turned out to be "sinkers", but I like them chewy.

My husband liked them too, even though he was upset I didn't use his mom's recipe.

Great flavor.  I did add chopped onion,garlic and sliced carrots as other readers have suggested.  Next time though I would use broad egg noodles instead of the dumplings.  Will be doing this again soon.

I have never made dumplings before even though I love them. The biscuit mix was too sticky so next time I would use a little less milk and an oiled cookie scoop. I used a 32 oz box of low sodium chicken broth and the extra liquid was perfect since I added one cup of frozen peas and carrots. I call what I made Chicken and Dumpling Stew and plan on making it often. So easy and delicious!

I used a famous restaurants herbed biscuit mix and threw in a bag of the steam in the bag corn, green bean and carrot mix. ( I cooked it first). As advertised it was super easy and delicious! It reminded me of mom’s and grandma’s cooking. That is a very good thing.

This recipe is amazing!!!!! Easy prep, easy cook, easy cleanup! 

It's such an easy recipe that you can modify it to please your own tastes.

I added chopped onions, carrots, and celery. I also cooked fresh chicken myself. I simply used boneless skinless chicken breast and cubed it. worked perfectly!

My parents loved it and were asking for more. 

I will definitely be making this recipe again!

The only thing I changed was using refrigerated dough instead of the mix and adding vegetables, but I've got to say, I thought it was not very good. One of my 3 kids liked it, so I guess it wasn't all bad. I think the canned chicken was what made it a little unappetizing. If I ever make this again I'll cook my own chicken.

I just made this tonight. I used 1 1/8 cup biscuit mix and 1/3 cup water for the two of us. I used this as a starter recipe and diced some raw carrot, onion, celery, a dash of poultry seasoning and some ground pepper and threw all in a pressure cooker with a 12.5 ounce can of chicken chunks and 1 cup chicken broth and cooked it for 5 minutes at number 10 pressure. Then I cooled it down immediately (did not drain), put it back on the burner, added another cup of chicken broth (I just used the cubes and water) and brought it to a boil and added the dumplings. I covered the pot (with a regular lid) and simmered it for 10 minutes and it turned out great. I did add a little cornstarch mixed with a small amount of cold water. Perfect and delicious! Thank you for this great basic recipe that can be suited to taste.  My husband loved it, too.

Didn't really enjoy the canned chicken, but everything else was great! Next time I'll use leftover chicken or rotisserie. Quick and easy!

I was originally planning on making chicken in dumplings in the slow cooker, but all of a sudden it was too late. The BF insisted he still have his chicken and dumplings, so I looked for a quick recipe. I boiled/poached my chicken breasts in broth, then removed the chicken. I brought the broth back to a boil and added refrigerated biscuit dough (someone recommended using Grands Buttermilk specifically), following the recipe more as a timing guide. I simmered the 'dumplings' and cubed my chicken breasts, then added back in about halfway through. I added a little dried onion, onion powder (I'm a fan of onion), parsley flakes, garlic powder, and a little black pepper. It tasted a bit store bought, but that doesn't mean it wasn't delicious! :)

SO simple for the busy and untrained cook.  I used Pillsbury Grands biscuit dough and ripped off maybe 8 pieces per biscuit to drop into the sauce.  Don't be alarmed if the sauce is super thin to begin with; it thickens up when it simmers.

I sauteed onion and celery in a bit of oil before adding the broth and chicken. I also threw in a bag of mixed veggies and some black pepper. It was a little too salty for my taste! Next time I will use fresh chicken and reduced sodium broth.

Great basic recipe but WAY too salty. Next time I will use fresh chicken (not canned) and lower sodium chicken broth. It's also great for kids to help with.

Never made chicken and dumplings before (still haven't cause my husband made them) but it was super fast and easy.  We've made it twice in the past week!  First time we used chicken breasts, 2nd time we tried the canned stuff. Definitely like it better with home cooked chicken.  We also added the celery onions and carrots like others did.  My 9 year old and 19 month old both loved it!  Thank you!

Another positive review, like some of the previous reviewers I sauted some chopped carrots mushrooms and celery and used rotissary chicken with broth made from its bones and skin, it was delicious just tailor made for a rainy day as it is today.

I made the recipe and it was such a great comfort food during our cold winter weather.  I had cooked a whole chicken in the crock pot, intending to make a different recipe, but glad I made this one.  Super easy, super good!
