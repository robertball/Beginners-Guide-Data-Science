First: I had no smoking ANY time I've made this, and I usually cook the chicken 20 min on 500, 20 min on 475, and 20 min on 425. Second: GREAT spice. Double it and rub it UNDER the skin (then get rid of the skin - no one needs it anyway). Third: You only need to cook chicken to an internal thigh temp of 165, then remove, cover, and let sit for 15 min.  If you cook to 180 you have a higher chance of drying it out (this is not bogus, it's from the USDA's wesite) Forth, and MOST important: COOK THE CHICKEN BREAST DOWN!  You will not BELIEVE how amazing the breast meat is.  I mean, better than dark meat usually is moistness wise. The skin on the breast won't brown or look pretty...but we're not eating that anyway, right?  If you have to have a crispy breast flip it over for the last 15 min of cooking.

I was surprised this was as good as it was because of the combination of spices, but it was truly yummy.  Like others suggested, I doubled the olive oil and the spices for a 4.5 lb. bird.  I also greased the baking dish a bit, but realized after the fact it wasn't really necessary.  Instead of sprinkling the spices on top of the chicken, I brushed the entire bird with olive oil and rubbed the spices all over it.  I cooked it an additional 30 minutes because of the larger bird, and it came out perfect.  I brushed the bird with a bit more olive oil toward the end as well.  I threw chunky potatoes (all I had were idaho bakers, but they still came out great) in the pan during the last 40 minutes with chunks of onion, and brushed them well with more olive oil and sprinkled them with granulated garlic and salt.  They were so good, it was amazing, I'd never roasted potatoes that way before.  I never covered the bird or the potatoes - it was delish.  I highly recommend this recipe - it was easy and very tasty.

Great spices.  I cooked this in an oven bag and added a bit of water to the bag to make a great gravy with the juices and the flour you have to add to the bag (so it won't burst) and it turned out really tender.  The meat just fell off the bone the longer I cooked it.  I've found that OVEN BAGS are the key to roasting meat.

For those who said it was not flavorful bc you don't eat the skin, I highly recommend marinating it for 24 hours in your refrigerator.  You can even do as you would a turkey, raise the skin and apply some of the rub underneath the skin.  I have never once had smoking, but it is because it absorbs so much of the oil when it marinates in the refrigerator overnight.  We are from LA and like spicy, so I also double the amount of spices!

Good flavor, but nothing to write home about. Due to previous comments about the high cooking temperature causing smoke in their kitchens, I reduced the temp. to 350 and baked it until the chicken's pop-up timer popped (I used a 6 lb. roaster chicken, and it took about 1 hr. 45 min.) Chicken was moist.

This recipe was outstanding!! The chicken was so flavorful. My whole family enjoyed the tasty meal. I used a six pound chicken, so I doubled the spices. I put an onion and celery leaves in the cavity before roasting. I cooked it at 350 degrees for about 2 hours. It was wonderful!! Quick to prepare and very delicious!!

My house smelled incredible tonight. I just knew this chicken was going to be good.  I love this high heat blast at the beginning to ensure a rich, golden skin, but I was a little more laid back on the remaining cooking time, lowering the heat to 375 rather than 400.  I also rubbed the chicken with butter rather than olive oil (under the skin too!), again to help with browning.  Rather than the seasoning called for I used "Chicken Seasoning Blend," recipe also from this site. (I can't recommend THAT recipe enough!) I filled the cavity of the chicken with sprigs of rosemary, lemon halves and a quartered onion. I roasted it until the thickest part of the thigh registered 170 degrees, which was about 18 minutes a pound (after the initial 20 minutes at 450). I made a rich pan sauce by deglazing the pan drippings with white wine, reduced that, added a good glug of chicken broth, reduced it again, then added another cup or so of chicken broth and reduced it once again.  The sauce, the chicken - simply outstanding.

Very good! I didn't measure the spices, just poured each, adding garlic powder, into a bowl and then rubbed them onto the chicken. The timing was perfect for a 3.5 pound chicken. I also added a little white wine and some lemon juice to the pan. It made a lot of drippings, so I made some gravy. Delicious! Will keep this recipe.
Thanks!

Just wanted to say that this cooks absolutely brilliantly! Any comment about smoke I'm going to make a comment now that those people will not like but hey they started the smoke comments. CLEAN YOUR OVEN! Simple as that and as for comment re the flavour being "OK" or "Good flavour but nothing to write home about", well I'd recommend those people buying some fresh herbs and spices and not use the ones that have been sat in a cupboard for years!

This is a very tasty well cooked bird with tons of flavour.

PS. How did those people not cook it properly? (The ones who needed to cook their chicken for more time or in the microwave!) D'oh! I think you have done something incredibly wrong.

It was OK. The spices were good, but since I don't eat the skin, I didn't taste them very much. The chicken wasn't finished by the end of cooking time (still pinkish inside), although the skin was beginning to darken too much for comfort. I had to pop it in the microwave for an additional 5 minutes to finish cooking the inside. Also, there is a goodly amount of smoke involved; I had to turn on the kitchen fan and open a couple of windows.

I had a 4.5# chicken that needed to be used today.  And due to us having wedding appointments this afternoon, we got home a little while ago.  Since I did not want us eating at 9pm, i figured I'd try this recipe!  I oiled the bird and  added a few extra dry ingredients to the rub - (amounts not approximate)  fresh cracked pepper, kosher salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, paprika, cayenne pepper, and ancho chile powder.  I made enough to rub both the top and bottom as well as under the skin of the bird.  Put it breast side down in a covered roasting pan.  Thanks to the suggestion of the top reviewer for this recipe, I cranked my oven up to 500°F and am letting it roast for 20 minutes.  I turned it down to 475°F and let it roast for another 20 minutes.  Then I took it out of the oven and flipped it breast side up and returned it to the oven uncovered. I turned it down to 425°F and let it roast for the last 20 minutes.  When it temped at about 165°F in the thickest part of the thigh, I pulled it from the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes. Bird was nice and juicy!!  Made a pan sauce from the drippings and served with mashed and green beans.  Fiance enjoyed every bite.  Cooking Tip - USDA recommends a safe min cooking temp is 165°F.  Cooking to 180°F will just result in a dry bird.  COOKING WITH SCIENCE ROCKS! :)

This chicken looked really good, but upon cutting it we found the skin really dry and the inside undercooked.  We had to roast it an extra 40 minutes for the chicken to be fully cooked.  I might try it again in the future and do a few things different, but overall I wasn't impressed with this recipe.

I'm not sure why there are reviews saying this chicken is dry...I have made it over 10 times with very consistant results...meaning a very tasty, moist chicken (with no cover on the chicken)! I truly appreciate a recipe as yummy and quick as this one! My husband asks for this at least once a week and I'm happy to oblige. I love how the skin gets crisp and how the chicken stays moist...I'm pretty sure I add more paprika (I use smoked) to the mix and use fresh oregano from my garden and stuff the inside of the bird with it as well as putting it on the skin with the other herbs. I also cut a lemon in half and also put it in the cavity...but the recipe is just as good on it's own. I always serve this with dilled carrots and roasted rosmary new potatoes. Thanks Nancy for a wonderful, quick recipe!

ok... so the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because i only used the seasoning from this recipe for my roasted chicken. mainly because i find that the longer you roast your chicken, the juicy & more tender it comes out. the seasoning was AWESOME! i also added 5 halved garlic cloves into the cavity of the chicken & baked @ 350 for 2 hours. YUMMY!

This is how I've roasted my chickens for years.  It's a wonderful method for preparing a juicy, succulent chicken.  The only changes I make are that I put a halved onion, a whole lemon which I've pierced all over with a sharp knife, and a handful of fresh rosemary in the cavity.  mmmmm!

One of my favorite recipes!  I  trim off all of the skin first and then add the olive oil & seasoning rub.  Then I put minced garlic, fresh rosemary sprigs, fresh thyme sprigs, and a whole lemon into the cavity.  The meat turns out moist and flavorful!  I save the carcass to make the best chicken stock (after roasting the bones).  So good!

I fixed this for lunch when my sister and brother in law came and it was fantastic.
I roasted it in an enamel covered cast iron oval dish coated with olive oil spray for easy clean up...........
The spices and high heat combine for a succulent chicken. 
BTW it makes lovely gravy that we used on our chicken and our Yukon Gold potatoes that I served with it.

Nancy, all I can say is THANK YOU for this wonderful recipe.  I made some changes, too -- I stuffed the cavity with smashed garlic cloves and slices of onion.  I put chopped up onion, carrots, and fingerling potatoes under the chicken in a big Creuset soup pot instead of a roasting pan.  I made 4x the spice mixture and mixed it (along with drizzled olive oil) into the veggies, inside the cavity of the chicken, and on the skin.  Lastly, I did tuck some butter and smashed garlic cloves inside the skin by the breast and down by the legs.  I did truss it, but next time won't because trussing kept the legs from cooking as quickly as the rest.  If you just tuck the wings behind the bird you should be fine.  Oh, my final indulgence?  I made spaetzle to go with it and before serving browned the spaetzle in the chicken drippings.  Ooooh la la it was a wonderful meal.  I loved that it was spicy and not boring.  The house smelled WONDERFUL!!  I was going to serve the leftovers for dinner tonight (made a 5 pound bird) but my fiance begged me to let him take leftovers to work for him and two of his coworkers - he loved it so much he wanted to show it off.  :)

This is the absolute best whole chicken recipe and I have tried a lot!  My husband and I love the flavor and the high temp cooking makes it juicy and tender.  Use an over thermometer to make it easy.

This is fantastic!  I had a 7 pound roasting chicken so I had to adjust the seasonings by 4x, and the cooking time by about 30 minutes.  I rubbed some of the seasoning under the skin and in the cavity.  I also added onion and garlic to the cavity.  This chicken turns out so moist and flavorful it makes you crave it!

I have been using this ecipe for years but never reviwed it.  This is FANTASTIC! It also works with any way you like seasoning yor chicken.  The best way for me is using 500 degrees for 20 minutes, 475 for 20 and 425 for 20 more.  The chicken is always very juicy, including and especially the breast.  Don't forget to always bake breast side down. That is key! I don't bake chicken any other way!

Four stars for the technique, even though I over-cooked mine by about 15 minutes...The spice mixture needed a bit more pizazz,which I did just by adding garlic/rosemary seasoning & onion powder, then rubbed the spices over & under the skin. My chicken was on the heavier side & still a bit frozen in the middle so I adjusted the cook times to 30 minutes & 1 hour (breast down)which resulted in dry legs & breast (though the breats weren't as dry as the legs). It was my fault & next time I'll keep my version of the seasonings but use my digital probe thermometer & do it right!

This is an excellent  recipe as is... and lets anyone tweak the spices to his/her own tastes.  I was amazed that cooking at such a high temperature didn't cause the chicken, even the breasts to dry out.  I've done whole chicken and just bone in breasts with no problems.  After playing with the spices, I've settled on using smoked paprika and added poultry seasoning to the rub.  I used the rub both under the skin and on top of the skin.  The high temp renders most of the fat and leaves a nice tasty and crispy skin.  Definitely 5 stars:  Easy, fast and very tasty!!

Excellent.  If you do not eat the skin (I don't), try chopping the herbs - use more fresh - and mix with a little more olive oil. Instead of sprinkling on top -- stuff under the skin. Use your finger to loosen skin from meat and push the herb mixture down. Very moist and tasty. You also can us fresh thyme, rosemary and sage.  Also stuff halved onion or lemon inside cavity with some more herbs.

Excellent I increased the spices due to having a bigger chicken than the recipe called for and used a fourth stick of butter instead of olive oil. I mixed the spices and butter and rubbed over and under the skin.  I placed a cut lemon and celery stalk in the chicken cavity and baked at 350 for 20 min per lb. The chicken was moist and delicious

Like others, I doubled the spices--and had just enough.  I also sliced two small lemons in half and put in the cavity.  I roasted the chicken breast-side down and turned it over for the last 30 minutes, and I cooked it to an internal temp of 165 and covered with foil.  It was a beautiful golden color, and the breast was very moist.   I have used that approach before with turkeys and been very happy with the result.  My rating of four stars (and not five) indicated that I consider this a very good go-to recipe I will use when I don't have time to brine and marinate.

Juicy, flavourful ... wonderful!!

After washing & drying the chicken, I sprinkled a little salt & pepper into the cavity and then stuffed the chicken with a quartered orange to add moisture & flavour (and to absorb fat).

I added powdered garlic to the spice mix as well as a little thyme.  I poured some white wine and lemon juice into the bottom of the pan and put the chicken in breast side down to ensure it was as moist as possible.  I cooked it as suggested by another reviewer .. 20 mins at 500, 20 mins at 450, 20 mins at 425.  I basted it several times during cooking and added water/chicken broth as needed, then turned it breast side up and removed the roasting pan lid for the last 10 minutes, then let it rest for 15 minutes while I made gravy.  It was perfectly cooked (I had a 3 3/4 lb  bird), moist, flavourful and the boys LOVED the gravy over the chicken as well as on their baked potatoes.  Great recipe - thank you!!!

I chose a simple recipe for my husband to make me for my birthday dinner. IT WAS DELICIOUS! This is my go to meal anytime we have company over on short notice. I 3x's the spice and rub under the skin too. Roasting the bird breast side down on a v-shaped roasting rack really helps to make the breast VERY juicy.

Very good, though there were some issues.  The chicken took almost an hour longer to cook than called for.  I doubled the seasoning and allowed it to marinate for several hours in the fridge before cooking.  I started the chicken out breasts up to crisp the skin, then flipped it to keep the breasts juicy for the rest of cook time.  Flavor was great!

I will roast all future chickens with this recipe as a guide for oven time & temperature. The mixed spices were excellent, though I'm sure to try others. The chicken was perfectly moist, & delicious. I did add a foil tent for the first half hour to trap the moisture, but will try it without next time for the crispier result. I added an additional half hour for a 5 Lb chicken.

I love this recipe. The only change I make: chicken quarters rather than a whole chicken. I sprinkle the spices under the chicken skin and then rub some on the outside as well. Family eats it right up.

I used an organic chicken and it was heavenly. Yes, they are more expensive, but the result is phenomenally better. This recipe produces a bird with crisp tasty skin and moist meat.  I always try recipes as published the first time. Next time I will increase the amount of the spices and will stuff the cavity with citrus. Very  nice recipe!

WOW!  This recipe is fantastic!  As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the spices (except for the cayenne-- we don't like spice, so I left that out), rubbed some of the spices under the skin over the breasts, but otherwise followed the recipe as-is.  It was done right on time and was tender, juicy, and delicious.

This was wonderful!!! The chicken had a rotisserie type flavor to it, and the skin browned very nicely!!! I added garlic powder to the mixture of seasonings, and I rubbed the skin with butter about 5 min prior to removing it from the oven. Thanks for the great recipe, Nancy!!!

I had a 4-1/2# chicken, so I cooked mine a bit longer till the temp was 180.  This was very good.  I would use this recipe again when cooking a whole chicken after work.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!
I followed the recipe exactly as posted except doubling the awesome spices. Used a 4 lb. Chicken.
For others who lowered their star ratings because the chicken was too done or not done enough - I would say that all ovens do not heat at the same temp and all chickens do not cook exactly the same.
I ALWAYS use a meat thermometer to make sure it is done to the desired temp. I pulled mine out at 165 degrees, let it sit for the 10-15 min. As the meat continues to cook while sitting, it came out tender, tasty and VERY juicy! Delicious!
Thank you Nancy!

This is the first extremely disappointing recipe that I've tried on the Allrecipes site.  It was basically a bland, flabby roast chicken.  Even though it was roasted at a high temperature, it was not crisp as expected. I only gave it one star because you have to give at least one.

This was excellent.  Although the worst part of the chicken is the skin, it is a must have for my husband and he loved it!  My daughter loved it as well.  I just wish more of the flavor actually got to the chicken, and not just the skin.  I think the next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I will do what another review mentioned they do and rub  it under the skin too, and then let it sit overnight before roasting the next day.  Oh, and I had no smoke coming out of my oven when I made this.  Thanks for sharing!

The spices make for a well seasoned bird, but pull the bird at 165 degrees and tent with foil for 10-15 minutes to let the juices redistribute for a moist and tender bird.

Made this recipe last night and it was a HUGE hit! Roast chicken is my hubby's all-time favorite meal. This was great as it sears the outside and locks in the juices, so delicious. Will be making this one again and again!

If you like spicy food, you need to increase the spices in this recipe. I doubled everything except the salt and it had a nice kick but was hardly fiery. My husband thought it was delicious. I will probably make this again. Thanks!

Fantastic!  Great flavor. Quick and easy to fix. I used the hint of starting with the breast down and then turning and it was very moist. I also doubled the spice mix.

This chicken was REALLY delicious! I normally don't rate a recipe if I've changed it at all, but I did add cajun spice to the dry spice mixture and used a little less cayenne pepper. I also added some onion powder. I made mine in my Flavor Wave oven and it cooked for 1 hour and 55 minutes.  It was extremely moist and full of flavor! This is so easy. it's a keeper!!!!

Very good - I also put the rub under the skin and cooked it breast side down.  I think next time I will completely remove the skin - would be better that way!

I made this tonight and it was very good.  For ease, I mixed together all the spices with the olive oil, let it set for 10 minutes and then rubbed it all over the chicken, even inside the cavity.  I cooked exactly as stated and it turned out beautifully. I will definitely make this again.

If you are not into spicy, and/or your meat is dry, I suggest a few things: First, lift the chicken skin and rub your spices into the actual meat as well as the skin.  I suggest cutting a lemon into half, and squeezing and rubbing the lemon juice on the skin.  I then use garlic, cracked pepper, and other spices on the chicken. I take lemons and limes and stuff the chicken with it.  No stuffing to suck the juice out of the bird!  It infuses the bird with excellent flavor, keeps it light for summer dishes, and helps preserve the juiciness. Last, but not least, I'm a white meat girl, and hate a lot of fat and calories.  Cook your bird upside down - breast (with skin) at the bottom.  The moistness from the dark meat and the rest of the bird sinks into the white meat.  The breast skin is not as tempting, because the breast has soaked the flavor.  All in all, great when having to whip together a quick, and healthy, meal!

here is a tip about roasting chicken. Sprinkle a light dusting (I mean light) of flour on top of the skin, you can add dry spices with it, but only dry, nothing wet...(I usually just use flour, fine pepper and salt)  the skin and flour "fry" together and make a crispy crust. The meat underneath will be tender from the crispy skin holding in the juice. This had revolutionized my chicken baking...

I doubled the spices in this recipe - and it had a VERY good flavor!  Also, this was extremely easy to make.  I followed the oven directions exactly - and the meat came out perfectly done and tender.

Delicious - so quick and easy. Next time I think I will double the spice mixture, mix some with olive oil and slide it under the skin to infuse the meat with more flavor. I roasted my chicken breast-side down and it was very moist.

This chicken has wonderful flavor and family looooved it!!  One thing though is that if you cook to 180 it will be dry.  Internal temp. should be 165 with chicken.  Other than that great recipe.

Had a huge 7.5 lb. roasting chicken and found this recipe to try. We loved it! I put some seasoning under the skin, as suggested, and also added an onion and some celery inside the bird. I tripled the seasoning quantity and added halved new potatoes, baby carrots and sliced onion to the pan, after tossing them with olive oil and some of the seasoning. Basted the vegetables several times during roasting. Chicken and veggies were both delicious, as was the pan gravy I made. (Hardly used that as the chicken and veggies were moist and flavorful alone.) Looking forward to leftovers tonight!

Chicken turned out very moist. I also shoved some onion and garlic in the birds cavity. Very tasty and the kids ate it, that's what matters most. Will for sure make again.

I've made this 3 times now and we LOVE IT!!! I add some broth, onions and garlic to the bottom of the pan, then about 1/2 hour before it's done (before the liquid is dried out) I add in more broth, makes a wonderful gravy. This usually takes about 10-15 minutes longer to cook, I just check the temp. a few times. I think the flavors are perfect, thanks for the recipe!!! YUMMO!

I made this recipe with a 5-lb bird and it totally charred under the high heat yet still was undercooked on the inside.  I would recommend going with a lower heat for longer time rather than ruin a good chicken.  Just my suggestion.

Very very good! I forgot to add the olive oil but it turned out wonderful anyways.  I rubbed the outside of the chicken as well as under the skin with the spices. It was too spicy for my 5 year old though so next time, I will leave out the cayenne.  But the skin was crispy and the inside was so tender and juicy!  The cooking time was right on.

#@&!%#!@@ !!!  Ok, so I put the chicken into the oven at 450 to bake, then I run to my computer room to double check this recipe, well as I am reading some of the reviews, I start to see a few, "smoke complaints" I smell something burning, then I see thick smoke all over my kitchen/ family room, I just put it down to 350, and this better be one good chicken. now to get rid of the smell....  ;\ EDIT TO ADD: this chicken is not good enough to have to scrub my oven 30 minutes for.

I made this on Christmas Day since it was just my husband and I-we had a HUGE oven stuffer chicken with pop up timer, so I doubled the spices. My husband loved the way it looked and smelled coming out of the oven. He ate it up! It did smoke a bit cooking, but I opened a window and kept the oven fan on, and it was really not a problem. It was soooo easy and yet so good. We will have this again.

Absolutely wonderful.  I also doubled the spices and put some under the skin  in addition to on the skin, and baked breast side down like suggested by another reviewer.  Incredibly moist, tender and succulent.  I then made up some more of the spice combo and put it on the potatoes that I threw in with the chicken.  They were spicy and wonderful!  Will make again, for sure.  Had very little left over tonight:)

This was such a great recipe!! I did a couple of minor changes to the seasoning though.  First, I mixed 4 tbsp salt, and 1 tbsp of the other listed ingredients.  Then I added 1 tbsp. of garlic powder and onion powder and thyme; as well as added an extra 1 tbsp. of paprika (I use smoked paprika and its amazing).  Oh, I cooked 2- 5 1/2 lb. young chickens too...but this much seasoning gave me plenty to completely cover both sides of the chicken as well as under the breast skin and inside the cavity.  I cut up leeks and shallots and put inside the cavity for extra flavor.  I put parchment paper in the bottom of the pan and sprayed it with Olive Oil Pam. I cooked the chicken covered,breast side down, and flipped it over and uncovered it for the last 20 minutes so the skin would be crispy.  The cook time was about 1 hr 50 minutes for 2- 5 1/2 lb chickens.  The flavor was amazing and everyone loved it, so this will be a regular recipe around here.

I added celery and Rosemary to the cavity also Rosemary around & top of the bird also used garlic oil. My husband was running late so I shut off the oven and let it coast in the oven for 45 minuets after the cooking time was up and it was the best roasted chicken we have ever had. I was a skeptic with no truss and no rack? Legs and wings were not burnt, chicken was brown all over, and no cleaning of the roasting rack!

Loved this recipe.......Doubled the seasonings.  Cooked a 5+ pound bird so I added 30 minutes to the cooking time.  Cooked the chicken breast side down for the first hour and then removed excess fat and turned breast side up.  Added potatoes for the last 40 minutes and came out with a great meal.  Not greasy, healthy if you remove the skin. Excellent

This is fantastic!  Loved it so much, I am making it again next week.  Since I was only making a dinner for two, I used chicken breasts instead of a full chicken.  Baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out perfect.  Would definitely recommend!

This is one of my favorite ways to cook chicken to date!

First of all, I made very minor changes. I used smoked paprika instead of regular, and doubled the spices and increased the oil by 50% because I used a large chicken (almost 6 pounds).

I mixed the herbs and oil together and used it as a wet rub to rub down the outside *and* the inside cavity. The result was juicy meat, flavorful skin, drippings that made a great gravy, and all very easily put together. This will be a repeat, for sure. I had no issues with smoking (possibly because I made the rub wet?) and the skin was nicely crisped but not excessively browned.

I was very skeptical about trying this roasting method, but I had a whole chicken that HAD to be cooked last night and I definitely didn't have 2+ hours to do it.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results!  The meat was juicy and extremely tender.  I did have the same smoke issue as other reviewers, even though I put water in the bottom of the roasting pan two or three times during the cooking process.  It wasn't enough to make me not want to use this method again, though.  The only truly negative part about this is that the spices don't have a chance to penetrate the meat, so while the skin is very tasty, the meat is fairly bland.  I think I'd like to try marinating the chicken with the dry rub all day, putting some of the spices under the skin and in the cavity, and then using the rapid-roast cooking method to see if that allows the flavors to penetrate better.

This is so easy and delicious! I am normally hesitant to cook for company other than family. We've had several guest when I used this recipe. Everyone loves it and says it's the best pork loin they've ever had! Everyone wants the recipe. I'm almost embarrassed to give it to them and let them see how easy it is! I wanted to keep it my secret!

Love to do chicken this way, but here's a little hint. I spray a baking sheet with Pam and add parchment paper to the whole sheet; spray Pam on the parchment as well. Take away the backbone of the chicken and spread it out on the parchment. No sticking; no smoke, just great flavors. Wash and DRY the chicken and then sprinkle some light olive oil all over it. Season as you like. Preheat oven to 425 and bake for 15 minutes; lower heat, without opening the oven, to 350 and bake for 45 minutes. Perfect chicken in one hour. I seasoned it with some Indian spices that we like and it's fantastic.  Enjoy!

Awesome!  I had a 5lb bird, so after the 20 minute stint at 450 I roasted it at 400 for about 55 minutes to get to temperature.  I also slipped some minced garlic under the skin of the breast and stuck half an onion in the cavity.  Will definitely be making this one again!

I only used salt, pepper and fresh thyme. I love rapid roast chicken, it's so tender and moist. About the oven smoking, I have learned that if you have a very clean oven and put tin foil on the bottom rack so the oil doesn't hit the element or botton it won't smoke :)

Finally tried this recipe and this is THE BEST method, which is why i'm rating this a 5...would rate higher if possible. I kept an eye on things, due to some saying their oven filled up with smoke--had no probs with it at all. I had 6 skin-on chix breasts instead of a whole bird and used only garlic salt and Mrs. Dash's lemon pepper, due to everyone being hungry for "garlic-lemon chix" this week. Man, on MAN! Hubster swooned over this roasting method (hi-heat) b/c he loves his chix skin! (eeww).....he's already requesting more chix with Nancy's ROASTING METHOD for next week. Might try her seasonings then, we'll see. THANKS NANCY, your recipe rocks!  ;O)

I love this spice set for roast chicken.  I brinned my chicken overnight so I omited the salt, added some garlic powder and increased the cayenne pepper for a tad bit more spicy.  Because I had a 5 1/2 pound bird I doubled the amounts which was just right for that size.  Use my rotissereie at 375 degrees for 2 hours and it was perfect with an internal temp of 180.  It was moist all the way through, even the breast and very tastey!! I wasn't sure how the taste of mixing two different spice sets, one in the brine and this one to roast would turn out but it was wonderful and very moist. The drippings made a wonderful gravy for pasta or potatoes. Thank you Nancy for posting this... It's definately a keeper.

Very good, and the kitchen smelled great while it was roasting !  As others have recommended, I doubled the spices and herbs (except for the salt), but otherwise followed the recipe. Served it with a side combo of mashed potato, sweet potato and carrot, and a side of green beans. Will definitely make again.

I love how juicy and flavorful this came out. I did make a few changes, though. I used a glass 13x9 pan so I lowered the temperatures by 25 degrees, surrounded the bird with chopped red potatoes and carrots tossed in a bit of olive oil and parsley, and made double the spice mixture and rubbed half the spices under the skin of the breast, then rubbed the whole bird including the cavity with the remainder, and brushed with oil just before putting it into the oven. It did also take a little bit longer because I used a five pound bird but it was definately worth the wait! Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved this recipe because I've never had meat so tender and juicy come along with a skin so crispy and delicious: I've always had to sacrifice one. I did use a 4 lb chicken and it was not quite done in the thighs with the time specified: either stick with a 3lb like the recipe states or at the end of the written cooking time cover with foil and lower to 350 for half an hour, which is what I did with great results. The seasoning is good with a moderate spicy kick, not too overwhelming. I did quadruple the seasonings and would probably go to 5x in the future, I like it crusted. Thanks so much for sharing :)

Excellent bird! I did as some had suggested and roasted it breast side down on a rack for the first half, then turned it over to get all of the skin crispy. Very tender and juicy. Leftovers made great sandwiches too.

Have made this dish three times  recently ... The last time was the best, I think, because I oiled and seasoned my 2 chickens in a ziploc bag in the fridge for about 4 hours before baking.  Just before putting them in the oven, I sprayed them both with a little cooking oil, and sprinkled them with another (single) 'batch' of the spices listed.  I did have a smoking issue this last time, BUT I forgot to turn the oven temp back when I reset the time-- still, though, the skin was crisp and flavorful, and the meat was juicy and well seasoned throughout.  Highly recommend making 2 at a time to have one for leftovers, or recipes calling for pre-cooked chicken.

Absolutely, totally delicious! I doubled the ingredients and marinated 3 large chicken breasts in it for about an hour or so. Then, baked at 450 for around 20 minutes. Amazing! My husband kept saying it was as good as a restaurant and I agree. Very moist and full of flavor! Certainally good enough to serve to guests!

I use rubs all the time for my chicken adding cut up raw veggies (carrots, onions, parseley, celerty) to the cavity and tie to secure.  I spit barbeque on my outdoor grill avoiding hot oven and smoking in the kitchen.  Takes about 90 minutes for a 4+ pounder whole chicken and is tasty and nice presentation on the table.

Really good, really easy.  We don't eat skin in our house so next time I will lift the skin up and put the rub under the skin to get more flavor on the meat.

I needed a fairly quick way to prepare a whole chicken this evening and so I tried this recipe.  I was using a 5 lb. chicken, so I doubled the spices.  Also, I was out of cayenne and so I substituted white pepper for that.  I rubbed the spices on top of and under the skin, then placed on a rack in a baking pan.  Since I was using a bigger chicken, I left it at 450 for 30 minutes instead of 20.  It was great!

Turned out juicy with a crisp, savory skin. Thanks for this timeless recipe! I served it with cream cheese mashed potatos and a green salad.  UPDATE: Just wanted to let you all know that I make this chicken about once a week and it's a favorite in our home. I even shared the recipe with a neighbour who has never had success roasting a chicken; she called me jumping for joy saying she couldn't believe it, she had finally made a delicious chicken! GREAT recipe!

I couldn't determine the weight of my chicken, so I just watched it after the initial hour.  It turned out great.  I  put red potatoes and baby carrots around the chicken after it had cooked for an hour.  I added a can of chicken broth, stirred up the broth with the chicken fat and roux cooked the vegetables for 20-30 minutes until tender.  It made a fantastic gravy.  I'll definitely make this again.

I was skeptical about the spices thought it would be to spicy for my family. It was excellent. Just the right spice and great flavor. Even my picky child liked it. Will make again.

This cooking method is fantastic. The reason I only rated this recipe four stars is I had to make some changes to season the meat of the chicken as opposed to just the skin. I mixed the olive oil and spices in a bowl (adding a few extra spices to taste). I then added two tablespoons of softened butter and mixed well. I rubbed this mixture inside and outside the chicken, but I also rubbed it under the skin. This made for an incredibly flavorful, juicy bird. Thank you for this recipe.

Changes: 4 lb. chicken - I doubled the seasoning. I had to extend the cooking time by almost 30 minutes. I stuffed the cavity with celery, garlic, onion & potatos. I also surrounded the chicken with carrots and veggies. I also shoved smashed garlic & seasoning under the skin. I did not have smoke from the 450 degree oven. How does that happen? Maybe the rack is too high???

VERY GOOD!  After reading other reviews, I made the following changes: doubled the spice measurements, stuffed the chicken cavity with onion, garlic cloves and fresh rosemary. I rubbed the spice mixture under the skin and over it. It did take an extra 10 mins to bake at the recommended tempurature. But excellent - everyone loved it. It's a keeper!

Now I'm not a professional cook, but I'm also not a novice... after reading the reviews for this recipe I thought I'd finally found the roast chicken recipe I'd been looking for -- quick, succulent and full of flavorful.  OK, I tried it for my family tonight, and, w-e-l-l... not what it's cracked up to be, in my opinion!  After 20 minutes of tented cooking in the hot oven as per the instructions, it was time to go to plan B or be prepared to serve the fire department a blackened chicken, specifically, the blackening chicken in my very own oven!  The liquids were gone and the pan was turning black and starting to smoke.  OK, Plan B -- I managed to salvage the bird by adding liquid and covering it for 30 minutes with the roasting pan lid before finally removing the cover and allowing it to crisp up and finish cooking.  I did not get the results of the other reviewers who raved about this recipe and I was very disappointed in the outcome.  It took much longer to cook and there's that plan B detour... At the recommendation of several reviewers, I doubled the spices and felt it was still somewhat bland.  My family liked it, but overall, it was a disappointment.  This quick-cook at hi-temp method did not work for me and I will continue to search for a roasted chicken recipe that gives me better results.

It turned out great!  I added some potato, onions and carrots to the pan, sprayed lightly with canola oil and sprinkled a bit of salt and garlic on these.  My 4.5 lb chicken took about half an hour longer to cook.

Edited about 6 months later to add - I make this all the time and it's never failed me.  The skin is crispy and the chicken is tender and never dry.  I make a non-spicy version for guests who don't like spice, leaving out the paprika and cayenne and putting some rosemary, and garlic, and a bit of dry chicken bouillon mix into the rub.  Either way it makes a great broth for soup the next day.

This chicken was absolutely delicious. At first, I thought it to be a bit too spicy, but after a few bites all I wanted to do was eat the skin! Additionally, the meat was very tender and juicy. We'll be doing our chicken roasting  using this method from now on. Thank you for submitting this one, Nancy!

This was excellent.  I stuffed the chicken with 3 garlic cloves sliced up and two slices of lemon.  To make my chicken practically melt off the bone, I preheat the oven to 500F and once I've put the chicken in, I immediately lower the temperature to 375F and cook for approx. 1 hour or until done.  Half way through I also added sliced up potatoes already coated with salt & pepper and olive oil and they turned out great.Thanks for the great recipe--my family loved it!!!!

This recipe was very good!  As it was cooking, I began to regret using an equal amount of oregano, since it smelled quite strongly of it.  But once it was done, (right on time), it tasted great and no one spice outpowered the next!  This was so easy, I will definitely make it again.  I made it with chicken pieces instead of a whole chicken, and it turned out great.  Thanks!

The end result on this was good. Or else i'd give it a 3. I didn't like the "rapid cook". The high temps towards the end made the juices in the pan start to burn and smoke. I was hoping to make pan gravy from the drippings but it wasn't usuable. The chicken itself was very good. it looked great too. I added garlic powder to the rub and added 4 or 5 cloves of garlic to the cavity.

I think that first blast of heat really seals in the juices. I had a nine pounder and I thought it would have taken a lot longer to cook, but in two hours it was done. The seasonings were great which helped to make a wonderful gravy too. Thanks Nancy!

This was great!  I also added 1/4 tsp garlic powder to the mix.  I basted my 5lb whole chicken with olive oil every 30min and cooked it in the oven for 1 hour and a half at 375 F.  I also stuffed the chicken with cranberry stuffing.  This was soooooooo good!

This recipe is pretty good. The seasoning mix gives the skin a very good, crispy flavor and the meat is very juicy. Next time I will rub the seasoning under the skin to give the meat itself a little more flavor, but over all this is a good recipe and I will be using it again.

WOW!!!!!!  This was absolutely awesome!!!
Just made this for dinner tonight and it was totally delicious. The only change I made was to add minced garlic in the cavity of the chicken and add extra salt. The skin was so crispy and the meat so juicy. This is how I will always prepare roast chicken.

This was very flavorful and tender.  It reminded me of rotisserie chicken.  The leftovers made great chicken sandwiches.  I had no problems with the juices splattering & causing the oven to smoke.  The juices, however, made a wonderful gravy.

This was fantastic!  My husband is a really picky eater and he loved this, and so did my kids.  Nice looking and great tasting!  The flavor really does permeate through the whole chicken.  I didn't have all the ingredients so made some substitutions:
Basil - I used Rosemary
Cayenne Pepper - I used curry powder
And my chicken was 4½ pounds so for the last part I put it in for 55 minutes and it was tender and moist.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added a bit of extra spice but will add more next time and play with it for more spice.  This was definitely a keeper.

Very good.  Made this for my family, I followed the recipe except I cheated and used a roasting bag.  It was delicious, a big hit.   Next time I may first infuse the center of the chicken with the spices and some chicken stock.  A definite do-over!

Although I didn't use the exact spice ingredients listed, (I used what I prefer, which was easy to sub) this cooking method made the absolute moistest roasted chicken I have ever made. I will definitely be making this again and using different variations of spices. I'm curious to try a five spice version!

Followed dovelette's suggestions for temperature, doubling seasoning, rubbing under skin and roasting breast side down instructions. I used a cast iron skillet for a roasting pan because I knew it could with stand the high temperature. The breast browned while upside down and was very moist. Served with the bodacious broccoli salad.

Super easy and came out perfectly cooked. Docked a star because it could have used more flavour - it was pretty bland. But I'll definitely use it again with a different seasoning mix.

This was awesome! Moist and juicy chicken that's quick and easy to cook and prepare, and with a family that includes two hungry teens, tonnes of leftovers are NOT an issue.  Made exactly as recipe because honey likes spicy and eats the skin, he almost thought it was too hot! Could make with any rub you'd like, like rosemary/thyme, or garlic, endless delicious opportunities.

I have made this a few times already and it's always a hit. I make sure to add potatoes (sprinkled with garlic salt) with onion and some carrots towards the end. They get so tasty from all the chicken juices.

Delicious and moist. I doubled the spices and olive oil...I also used a 7lb roaster chicken. Since we are not "skin" eaters....I rubbed some of the spices under the breast skin and it was amazing. Flavorful meat! Saved and carcass in the freezer for stock and soup! Thanks!

My family loves this recipe.  I use the package of 5 chicken breasts, skin on, bone in instead of a whole chicken.  Quadruple the recipe which is more than enough to coat them. For extra flavor I insert a thin slice of lemon underneath the skin & grate a little rind on top. Delicious!  Just make sure to remove lemon slice after cooking.

This is a Great way to fix chicken Fast! You can adjust the seasoning to what you have on hand or what you like. Little ones might not like it soo spicy. As long as you are roasting 1 bird off, it's just as easy to roast off 2 ( same temp and  add a bout 20 mins more) and then you will have chicken meat for another night when you are rushed for time. You could do this on a Sunday afternoon and freeze the leftovers! Thanks Nancy for helping us get dinner on the table just a bit quicker!:)

Amazingly juciy and the spice combination compliments the chicken well. I've made this probably a half dozen times within the past year. It's great for special occasions but is still super easy!
The one thing I change is I usually use one and a half of the spice mix. I'll rub the extra half of the rub under the skin. And squeeze half a lemon over the chicken.

I made this exactly as stated with an exception of time, because I had a 5 lb chicken.  I sprinkled the seasonings inside cavity and all over the outside of the chicken.  I roasted this breast side down.  Turned out so moist and juicy!  I almost had a full serving as I was carving the chicken in the kitchen!  So good!

Really easy recipe and it was delicious!  My chicken was already cut up so I reduced the cook time to 30min and broiled it on high for about the last 3min. The breast came out a little dry, but everything else was fantastic. So next time I will reduce the temp down to 350 and cook 25min. When you pull the chicken out of the oven I would spoon the drippings over the chicken and cover with foil and let it rest for at least 10min.

I actually did 2 large chickens in my roasting pan with this recipe... came out beautifully. once I pulled all the chicken off and froze in portions for quick meals during week. I used the carcass to make chicken stock which freezes well also to be used in rice, mashed potatoes etc. the only down side is it made a mess in my oven due to splattering... but the oven needed a cleaning anyways lol

This turned out very moist. I followed dovelette's advice for rubbing under the skin rather than sprinkling over. I also baked on convection at 500* for 15 min, 475* for 15 min, 425* for 20 min, turning the chicken to breast-up for the last 15 min. I also let it rest a good 10 min uder some foil after I took it out. Family loved it! :) I've only roasted one full bird before so this recipe is definitely beginner-friendly!

This rub is awsome!  I wish I had made extra and injected it into the meat because once the skin was gone so was the rub!  Slightly hot, just the way we like it.

This was amazing! I added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a little bit of onion powder. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe has become our go-to for roast chicken. I've never had a problem with smoke but my oven tends to run a bit cold. I always save the carcass to make a stock then add carrots, onion, celery and noodles to have a great second meal.

Very easy and so moist! I used a 5lb bird and it does take a bit longer, not sure how much longer because I just kept the oven on and checked every 5 mins.

This was really yummy! I used two bone in chicken breasts and cooked them breast side down as suggested by another reviewer. I added potatoes for the last 20 minutes of cooking and covered the pot so they would steam a little bit. They were wonderful!!

This is a very savory, moist chicken. I loved the mixture of flavors - the paprika, the oregano, and the basil. And the aroma as it booked, my mouth watered the entire time! I thought cooking it at 450 degrees for twenty minutes would burn it or dry it out, but not so But for me, since I work full time, the fact that this delicious main dish is ready to eat in an hour is the best part. Usually I cook my whole chickens for two hours, which means we don't eat roasted chicken during the week, but to be able to have it done in an hour, well, I love it. If you want a delicious meal in an hour, this is the one for you!

This chicken was wonderful! I cooked it at the same temp as the recipe said to and had NO problems with smoke or it being under-cooked like others. It was perfectly done after the hour the recipe called for. I also took the advice of another person and roasted the chicken breast side down in the pan. It was WONDERFUL! The breasts were soooo tender! I had a 3-4 pound chicken so I doubled all the seasonings. I also did a half teaspoon of cayane pepper. Next time I will use more of the cayane, I really like spicy foods and it was very mild even after using four times the recommended amount. EXCELLENT RECIPE!

Loved this recipe! It was so easy to season and then just throw into the oven. It was very juicy and flavorful and my brother who can be quite picky loved it. Wonderfully simple recipe, and you can always customize the seasonings to you taste.

SO DELICIOUS! You have to try this!  The only thing I changed was I used half of a fresh cayenne pepper instead of the dried stuff, and I put an onion inside the cavity. It was FANTASTIC!  I will definately make this again and again!

Nancy, awesome recipe!  I wanted a chance to try out my brand new stoneware baker from Pampered Chef, and this was the recipes I chose.  I did double your spices, plus I added a little onion and garlic powder, as I am a garlic nut, but otherwise, I followed your recipe to a T and WOW!  I was a bit worried since I hadn't even used a cooking spray on the new stoneware, but by the time it was finished cooking, the bird was swimming in juices, about an inch deep!  And since I took another reviewer's advice and cooked the bird breast down, it was so tender.  My guys loved it.  Thanks for sharing the  recipe!

this recipe is a keeper!  I did double the spices as others suggested.  It was tasty and very easy to make.  It is similar to those roasted chickens you can buy pre-made at the grocery store, but half the cost if you make it yourself.  Update...I made it again last night and tripled the spices...even better!

This is very good! It's juicy and really simple to make too.  I skipped the rinsing and pulling off the fat part though and when I put it in the oven, I had it too close to the top (my rack was in the middle) - move your rack a bit further down, this sizzles alot!  The outcome is delicious though!

Very tasty!! A few things I did differently: *I doubled the olive oil and the spices, to rub inside and outside the chicken. *I stuffed the chicken with sliced up onion & lemon. *I cooked the chicken breast side down.

Fabulous!  This was my very first time cooking a whole chicken, and it turned out really moist and flavorful.  I did brine it overnight first.  Then I mixed up the spices (used double what's specified, plus I upped the cayenne a bit) and added a bit of ginger powder too.  I rubbed the dry rub under and over the skin, stuffed the cavity with chopped garlic, ginger, and sage, and then let it sit for about six hours before cooking.  We did get some smoke while it was at 450, but it wasn't bad.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

I LOVED this chicken. This and the sticky roast chicken are by far the best I've made. I increased the spices and added garlic powder and cajun season. I put the spices under the skin and inside the cavity of the chicken. I added 1/4 cup of water to the bottom of the pan to prevent burning. I had to cook my chicken longer than the recipe calls for. This recipe will be in heavy rotation at our house.

The seasonings worked well with the chicken. I added a half of lemon, 3 cloves of garlic and a couple sprigs of fresh thyme to the cavity of the chicken. I cooked it on a rack and put water in the bottom of the pan. The last hour I basted it with the drippings...yummy.

I cooked two chickens that where just over 4lbs each so I made this recipe X4. I mixed the spices with the olive oil and then rubbed it over the chicken and in the cavity; I also stuffed 1/2 of an onion into each bird before cooking.  I followed the recipe  but cooked it for a little longer because my chickens were larger.  I too had problem with smoking so I added a little chicken broth to the bottom of the pan when the chicken stated smoking and this solved the problem. I loved the flavour of the chicken although my daughter thought it tasted a lot like the chicken I make already.  I will make this again the chicken is juicy and it cooks quickly.

I have made this recipe many times before and it is wonderful!! I have also added 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder. We usually make chicken quesadillas the next night with the leftover chicken(tortillas, refried beans, mex rice, cheese and chicken--pan fried...yummy!) 
Super moist and flavorful and most importantly...EASY!!

This recipe is fabulous! Even altitude of over a mile, the recipe worked. The next time, the only thing I would add is more heat. It's a southwestern kinda thing!

I didn't really care for the oregano and the basil mixed with the other spices, but the cayenne and the paprika mixed together was absolute heaven. Next time I will probably just double those spices and completely omit the other herbs. I also used canola oil instead of olive oil, as it is more stable at high heat (it also packs more omega-3s!)

Roasting rocks! Rave reviews! What a great midweek, "what am I going to do with this chicken?" recipe. I did a large package of drumsticks and they roasted wonderfully at the recommended temps. Our oven smoked a time or two in the past when some rather large "crumbs" escaped it's original pan (not a good thing!).  Try this recipe again, the  rub/sprinkle is very lovely.

Outstanding.  This is now my standard roasted chicken recipe that I make once or twice a month for family or company.  Guests always rave.

What a hit!  My 8 year old just walked in and said - yum!  while I was putting it together.  The family loves it and it is so nice to have it quickly - I never plan that far ahead!  I use a 6lb. bird and cook an extra half hour.  The spices are wonderful and really add some kick!  Afterward, it's great for lunch boxes and I save the wish bone for later in the week.  Good family fun!

Delicious, juicy, easy to make, quick! As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the marinade and stuffed the chicken with onion slices and garlic.  I also lifted the skin and put crushed garlic and some of the marinade in for EXTRA flavor. Boy it was delicious.  This recipe calls for 20 mins on 450 and 40 on 400. I have a high powered oven known to cook fast and it took nearly 60 minutes.  I first sliced it and it was pink so i had to put it back in to cook longer.  Make sure the thermometer reads 180, not 175 or lower!  Enjoy!! We plan to make this again.

Delicious! The meat was nice and moist, even the breast meat. I used a 4 lb bird and it came out perfectly after the 20 minutes at 450 and then the 40 minutes at 400.

I made a 4.5 lb chicken the other day using this recipe. It turned out great! I rubbed some seasonings under the skin with some butter too. This was very flavorful and very moist. I cooked it breast side down for teh first 20 minutes and then turned it over because I wanted to get the skin crispy all over. I cooked for an additional 30 minutes due to the size of my chicken. For the last 40 minutes I added potatoes that I had sprinkles with the seasoning mixture. They came out perfect. I will definately make this again.

I do not understand how other reviewers had so much trouble with this, specifically as far as the person who made the comment about calling the fire dept. You can change up the spice combination (and I do think that placing butter and garlic and other spices under the skin is fabulous) but this method is sure-fire. The chicken was moist and flavourful and we couldn't stop picking at it!! I saved the carcass for soup even though it was almost picked to the bone!

Okay, seriously I never leave reviews but I had to say that this recipe is awesome! I did double the spices as per other reviewers and also rubbed some under the skin.
My mom told me I cooked it wrong because you shouldn't cook a chicken at those temps.  My hubby said well then, I want you to "cook it wrong" again next time.  Everything was moist and so delicious (especially the carrots and red potatoes I threw in the pan)!
I have no idea how one reviewer ended up with a smoking blackened chicken, but I never had that problem and I have made this recipe three times now.

Absolutely the BEST roast chicken!  Make exactly as recipe states except you can add your own blend of spices and make sure to rub it under the skin and double the spices!  The time and temp for the chicken is perfect for a 3.5 lb bird.  I couldn't stop picking at the chicken.  So moist!  thank you for a great recipe.

I made this last night and it was delicious.  I will take other reviewers advice and put the seasoning under the skin too next time.  I did double the seasonings for my 4 lb bird and I thought it was perfect.

I thought this was just ok.  Nice and juicy, but no flavor.  But, the gravy I made for leftovers was great.  I should have put more spices and put them under the skin.

OMG, this was FANTASTIC!!! I cooked a larger chicken for about 1 hr 15 min. I also took a suggestion from another reviewer and heated the oven to 500 then reduced to 475. I also added chunky red potatoes that I had drizzled olive oil and garlic salt on. Honestly, the potatoes were TO DIE FOR!! Crispy on the outside and as my kids said, "on the inside they taste like mashed potatoes". YUMM-O

This was another tasty recipe.  Like another poster, I covered the chicken for the first 40 minutes, then left uncovered for the remainder of the time.  I doubled the spices and was liberal with the olive oil.  It definitely needed more salt.  I think next time I will quadruple the spices and put them under the skin as well.  Will make again.  Thanks.

Oh my!  This was sooo yummy!  I made a couple of changes; I used a 3 1/2 lb chicken and let it reach room temp.  I poked some holes with a fork and then rubbed with oil and sprinkled spice mixture (minus cayenne).  I also stuffed and onion and a clove of garlic in the cavity, loosely covered it with foil for the first 20 mins and then removed it for last 40.  This is the way I will cook a whole chicken from now on!   I think the high heat is the key and it really is super juicy and flavorful.  Thank you!

While my husband and were amazed at how great this chicken was, it took more than 2 hours to cook, so all of my side dishes were done an hour before the chicken. The taste made up for the wait, but I would allow extra time for cooking.
BIG TIP: If you can stomache it (my mom said she wouldn't do it), in addition to seasoning the skin, seperate the skin from the meat and rub the seasonings on the meat directly. Then replace the skin and carry on with cookiing.This way, those who don't like the skin are still treated with as wonderfully seasoned chicken!!! Also, I let mine sit in the fridge all day to let the flavors blend before cooking.

I was disappointed by the lack of flavor of this recipe.  The chicken was moist but it didn't get any of that yummy rub mixture.  I even doubled the amount of spice and it still didn't taste like much.

We liked this, but it didn't wow us. Mostly we liked the spice rub, which is only on the skin. I may try it again on the grill; the splatter in my oven wasn't worth the result.

This one's a keeper.  I had a 4 lb. bird, took only 10 minutes longer to roast.  Skin was nice & crispy, meat was very juicy.  It was not too spicy, husband and kids loved it.

Rated the wrong recipe but will be making this one and then will rate again.  Sorry

4/4/06 - Finally made and OMG was this good.  Everyone raved about the chicken.  I did cook longer and I doubled up on the spices but that was because I used a much bigger chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Would not change a thing.

This was excellent. Would put spices under the skin next time to add more flavor to the chicken.  It fell right off the bone and was so juicy. I did not have any smoke issues and kept mine covered except for the last 10 min.

What a great way to serve chicken! I placed the chicken on a wire rack and in a medium sized roasting pan. To avoid "smoke", I covered the chicken throughout the whole roasting time.  I basted the chicken about every 20 minutes. The skin still became crispy and brown, yet very moist inside. I also used 1/4 tsp. Summer Savory, along with the other spices. We almost ate the whole chicken at one sitting!  It was so delicious. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Great!!! My family loved it and the best part was it was so easy. I used a McCormick chicken grilling spice mix that I had and it worked out great. I also added some white wine to the juice then basted the chicken with the juices on the bottom of the pan. The juice is wonderful to dip or pour over your chicken.

My chicken came out perfectly.  It was a slightly larger chicken, so it took about 30 more minutes than the listed time, but it came out juicy and golden brown.  Took the internal temp at the thigh and it was perfect throughout.  Thanks!

I used 6 chicken breast cooked 20 minutes at 450 and 15 minutes at 400 the chicken was so moist and tender way better than boiling.  I used the chicken to make Creamy Chicken and Rice soup also posted on this site.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was GREAT! The chicken was the most tender I have ever eaten! Even with the spices my kids just kept eating it. I had only a little bit left over, and I used that the next day to make awesome chicken and cheese burritos. They were great, too. This was the juiciest chicken. The only problem I had with it was the fact that the juices kept spitting out into the hot oven and creating a smokey environment. I had to drain the juices out of it every so often, but it was well worth it!

I was thrilled with this recipe! My husband said this was one of the best things I have EVER made. The only thing I will warn people of is because of the high temperature, I had a little smoke in my kitchen. But an incredible recipe-the flavor was throughout the chicken!

Great recipe. I see this often on here, but please leave off rinsing your chicken. Pat it dry with paper towels, but when you rinse with water, you will end up with salmonella on your kitchen surfaces. No one likes gastroenteritis/food poisoning.

Delicious.  Made it in a pampered chef covered stoneware baker.  Was VERY juicy.  I also put all of the chicken extras (liver, gizzard, neck etc.) under the bird to keep it off the stone.  Worked great.  Was very flavorful.  Will make this again.

I used my nuwave oven.   It was moist and juicy. 
A lot less running back and forth adjusting temp.
Power level hi 40 min.  On beer can holder.
Getting up under that breast meat with butter and spice helps retain breast moistness.

With the help of Russo's review I made a yummy bird! Though I do enjoy the crispy skin and the seasoning was spot on! Yumtastic! Will make again next month although next time I may just end up making two. :3 Left overs are yummy! Also want to add since I like crispy skin I rubbed the outside of the chicken with coconut oil instead of olive oil.

I have a large family so I used 2 large chickens. Doubled the recipe according to size and amount of chicken. Took about an hour and it was absolutely delicious!!!!! Tender and flavorful. Had my pickiest eater asking for seconds and attempting to lick his plate! Will be adding this to regular rotation!

After doubling the seasoning and using a cooking bag, it turned out great. To add a little crispness, I broiled the chicken in the oven while still in the bag for 10-minutes. It was picture perfect and taste great.

Wonderful and very easy. I had a larger chicken, so I just left it in the oven a little longer. Juicy and delicious! I also put in a pan of small red potatoes, garlic and sliced carrots for the last half hour and had my whole dinner finished at once!

Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the whole house smoking cooking it at that temperature. I cooked a 3 1/2 pound chicken. Followed the spices as written but did double the amount so it spreads evenly. I followed the instruction to the latter...but after an hour of rapid fast cooking, my chicken was still red and the temperature barely reached 120. I had to cook it for another 20 minutes (had to deal with MORE smoke). Finally I had enough my smokey eyes, so, I took it out. Reached a temp of 160 but when I sliced it 15 mins later, still some red and I had to microwave it. Besids the cooking time and temperature, the flavors were great and moist. But I am not sure if I will use this recipe again

It's fast and super easy prep. It tasted great when it came out but I used the drippings and ate the skin. The next day I took some leftover breast with a salad, it was tasteless without the skin. I actually chucked it and grabbed a couple tacos at the drive thru. It needs the butter and seasoning under the skin, just no way around it.

Had 6 large bone in breasts, so I doubled the seasoning and removed skin first.  After cooking them, I removed the meat and rough chopped it for salads, quesidillas, etc. for the week.  Very tasty!

I have made this several times and it always turns out excellent... I double/triple the spices per chicken and cook two because the leftovers are great for salad, sandwiches or chicken soup the following day.

This is kind of blah.  Not bad, but not great.  If the seasonings were kicked up a notch, I'd give it more stars.  The cooking method is very good though, hence 3 stars.

This is by no means spicy (hence the 4 stars) but the recipe provides a great base for a roasted chicken. Next time around I will add more heat and possibly more italian seasoning. I followed the cooking directions however the only thing I did different was that I covered the chicken (I made a tin foil tent) for the last 20-30 minutes and it turned out perfect. I made this with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.

Best Chicken ever!!  This is now my familys go to chicken recipe!  Followed it exactly, I had no problem with smoking or it not being done. As long as you have a 3lb chicken and not a larger one, this cooking time is perfect for a moist bird!

awesome recipe!!!! made it for dinner tonight. Everybody loved it. Hubby kept saying 'this is really good". Just next time will use more cayenne pepper as we like to taste of heat. As others suggested roasted chicken up side down. Going forward always will you this method. Very very moist. Keeper !!!!!!

Very delicious!  The meat was very moist and the rapid roast created a crispy skin.  Delicious!  I would recommend rubbing the seasonings under the skin as well as on top of the skin.  Next time I think I will increase the oregano, basil, and cayenne - all we could really taste was the black pepper.

Made it tonight and it was great! Only thing i added was garlic and I did double the amount of spices. My bird was 5lbs  and used the cooking time in the recipe and it was great! So juicy! I also cooked it upside down on a rack.

This was a good spice rub, but still seemed to be just a basic roasted chicken.  I think I will try the spice mixture on baked chicken breasts.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe for a nearly 4 lb. bird except for the cayenne pepper because we love lots of flavor.     Since I used fresh Basil and Oregano I used twice as much of each as the doubled recipe called for.     I followed the direction of others and seasoned the bird under and over the skin. I also marinated it in the seasonings for 3 hours before roasting.    I roasted it for the time and temperature that the recipe called for and experienced no smoking. It cooked perfectly and I didn't need to add time for the extra 1 lb. of bird.

This is THE roast chicken recipe, particularly the roasting method. I needed to cook 10 lbs of chicken pieces for a chicken dinner and this was the best way of keeping the pieces moist and juicy with crisp skin. I brined the chicken briefly and added more salt, rosemary, cayenne and other spices suited to our palate. The chicken came out perfectly with little muss or fuss. Next time I will add potatoes, carrots, celery and garlic for a complete meal in a pan.

This is delicious just as written.  I didn't change one thing.  Next time I will put foil in the pan under it.  Maybe coat the foil w/cooking spray or use the non-stick foil, which I like.

This was really tender and juicy, just the right amount of spices. Roasted breast down in roasting pan in convection oven for approx. 1 hour. Doubled the spices and applied spices under the skin, on skin and added some in cavity with some minced garlic. YUM!! Will definitely make again!

I used 2lbs of wings and drumsticks this was a good base however more salt or cayanne may be needed.  Keep in mind I really don't care for the taste of salt, this was a little on the bland side.

This is the best roast chicken I've had. Sooo easy!! You can change the spices if you like but they are perfectly wonderful the way they are. We use it for many meals and I do two at a time in my convection oven. Thank you for such a good recipe.

YUM - Just made this recipe and it came out very moist.  It was nice because it was so quick! I cooked it exactly as the recipe stated and it was fine, no smoking.  I did follow the advice of another user and after the hour of roasting I covered with foil and let it sit for 15 min.  Will definately pass this along to friends.

Excellent! I have been craving "comfort" food all wk., but due to my work sch., I never have time to make a big meal until the wkend. I have always wanted to try Roast Sticky Chx.-Rotisserie Style (Sue), but baking a chx. was a last-min. decision, so I didn't have time 2 marinate (Sue's recipe req. 24 hr. to marinate).  Quite frankly, I'm glad I tried this recipe instead! Bth. my fiance & I really enjoyed this. I am esp. happy to have bones left to make chx. stock! I know it's not fair to rate a recipe that you've drastically ch., but I'm going to.... I followed top reviewer dovelette's advice to dbl. the spices (3.75 lb. bird) & rub on the outside AND under the skin, roast breast side down (then up the last 20 min.) & to start w/ a 500 deg. oven, then to 475 for 20 min. & then to 425 for the last 20.  My only other ch. were to s&p the cavity & then stuff w/ a sm. (quartered) onion, a few crushed garlic cloves & a sm. lemon (1/2'd & juiced). Oh, and instead of using a sm. baking dish, I found another excuse to use my Le Creuset dutch oven (preheated, lid off). I did not bake to an internal temp. of 165 deg., however. My WS digital therm. (placed in thigh) reg. 165 after 20 min. (ikes!)!!! I knew my bird wasn't near done, so I just cooked to 180 (which took 55 min. total, more like it should have). To my surprise, every bit of my meat was super tender!!! Served w/ mashed taters, buttered corn & garlic crescent rolls, this was a fantastic meal. Thx. for sharing! :)

I made this as directed but  brined it for about 1 1/2 hours in "turkey citrus brine"  (normally it should be done overnight but it was last minute decision), hoping to get flavor into the meat and not just on the outside.  Stuck some of the brine limes and onions and garlic inside the cavity; turned it breast down after the initial 20 minutes!   It could have roasted another 10-15 minutes overall since it was a little pink.   Very moist and delicious; I'd say taste as good as Costo's rotisserie chickens!  Everyone wanted seconds! :)

Great!~ Just be sure you roast breast side down so the white meat does not dry out.  I used 2x's the kosher salt and omitted the olive oil as I think the skin is fatty enough.    I also sprinkled the inside of the cavity generously as well.  The skin was krispy and the meat very flavorful and moist.  I have a convection oven so the bird actually cooked 10-15 minutes faster and left him in the oven to "rest" while I made green beans.  Perfect!!

Did not cook in the hour the recipe claims. It took more than twice as long, and it was an average-sized Foster Farms chicken. It ended up flavorless and my home reeks of smoky-burnt-chicken-smell even several hours later.

Really Moist! I gave it a 3 star b/c I didn't find it all that flavorful and it took an extra 20 minute to cook, and we had a smaller bird than what the recipe calls for.

Excellent! I made 1 1/2 times the seasoning, because it sounded so good. Normally I don't eat the skin, because I know it's healthier without, but it was so good... I ate the skin and some extra! I used a meat thermometer to check the temp, took it out at 165 degrees, and let it set in order to get up to 180 like recommended. Very moist inside and crispy outside. I cooked it breast side down, then turned it over the last 20 minutes to crisp it up. Fantastic! I will make this again!

SO YUMMY!!!  This was a super easy recipe to throw together...I think the hardest part was changing the oven temp, LOL!!  Great spicy kick to it and the chicken came out nice and moist...perfectly cooked in 60 mins!  I did remove all of the skin and after reading other reviews, I took it out at 165 and left covered for 5-10 minutes, yummy!  Will definitely make again!

This has nice seasoning and the chicken turns out with delicious crispy skin, but we had to roast it about a half hour longer than stated. That is the only flaw with this recipe.

This chicken is sooo moist and delicious.  The first time I made it, I tried putting all the spices under the skin, thinking it would infuse into the meat -- that didn't work.  :-)  So the next time, I made it the original way, and the skin turned out so much better.  I won't use any other recipes for roast chicken ever again!

Very good, had a problem with smoking, but after I added the vegtables to the pan after the first 20 mins it stopped.  Next time I will add the veggies at the start, as they were cooked through but not as soft as I like them. Cooked breast side down and it turned out moist and juicy. Love the high heat cooking, the skin was brown and crispy, just the way I like it. Needs an extra 10-15 min cooking time.

I cooked this chicken for dinner and it had wonderful flavor and was simple (which is GREAT for me!) I changed the cooking time since I wasnt sure what time my husband would walk through the door tonight. I lowered the temperature TWICE (400 then 350) then after an hour and half, I turned the oven off until my husband got home... I also basted the heck out of it and also stuffed the cavity with onions that I sprinkled with the SAME herbs... The bird was delicious, juicy and spicy... I recommend you try it and just tweak the times.. :-)

First time - made according to instructions, but cooked less time due to personal time restrictions.  rubbed with more olive oil after first 20 minutes.  tried to keep as moist as possible.  very moist, but very bland - no flavor. Second time - doubled spices, added jamaican jerk spice, pulled back skin and rubbed under, added olive oil after every 20 minutes...was moist with tons of flavor!  May become a Sunday night regular event!

I had a 4 1/2 lb bird, so intended to give it 30 min plus 60 min, and then changed my mind.  Used 25 and 50.  It turned out very good! Browned enough, moist--I left it breast down for the first 25 min, then upright.  No problem.  Spiced and rubbed as the recipe recommended.  Was in a hurry, and was well pleased.

We take the skin off and cook the chicken in a pan with the lid on. I omit the olive oil altogether, and sprinkle about twice as much of the spices all over it. The chicken still comes out super moist with the lid on during cooking, AND you can eat the parts that have the spice since the skin is gone. Serve with rice cooked in chicken broth. While the chicken is cooking, I put celery, carrots, canned corn, sauted onions, summer savory and oregano into a pot to simmer in chicken stock, and when we finish eating our fill of the chicken, we chop up the remainder and add to the soup. Delicious!

I tried this with an almost 5 pound bird and it took a LOT longer to get rid of the pink inside.  Also combined the spices with butter and rubbed inside the skin so the flavor was good, but was disappointed in the cook time and the heat it generated in the kitchen.  Will revert to my standard roasting procedure.

very easy recipe.  i had to throw something together with only a few hours notice and this really did the trick.   i used a 6 lb chicken, but did not modify the amounts of the seasoning - i had still had ample seasoning.  i seasoned under the skin.  the only real modification i made was i also rubbed butter over the skin and put about a tablespoon or two in the cavity of the chicken.  it smelled so good while it was roasting and it was so moist.  my family loved it.  so simple - thanks!

Yummy. Turned out kind of like what you'd get in the grocery store. Next time I may double some of the spices... the key to the delicious tasting grocery ones usually involve a lot of salt and seasonings :)

I have LOVED cooking my chicken this way for quite some time! For added juiciness and crispy skin, I add thin slabs of butter under the skin, and on top of the skin. I also add a little flavor by tucking sliced garlic cloves under the skin and in the cavity with sliced onion and celery. I use the spices from this recipe and slow cook my chicken sometimes, or I'll season the chicken differently but use this cooking method.

Good basic roasted chicken recipe that I've used in my family for a long time. I do add onion powder, season salt, and garlic powder to the dry mix. Equally, similar to other reviewers I cook it a little longer and/or if I am trying to do a rapid cook, I increase the temp. Doing it according to the recipe leaves chicken meat which looks a bit undercooked. I also use a rotissiere which helps it cook more evenly.

Perfect!  I used white cooking wine in the bottom of the pan and no smoking occured.  I added red potatoes with rosemary near the end.  I also used a 5+ lb. chicken, so I lowered the cooking temp to 400 and cooked longer.  What a hit!

I used this recipie the 3rd time I tried a roast chicken, and this will be the one I use from now on. It cooks beutifully. I love that it takes one hour. I accidentally did 450 for an extra 10 min and auctually liked that one better. yumm...

My husband went bonkers for this recipe. I got my comfort food and he got his spicy kick. I hate roasting any kind of meat to have it come out dry (especially after smelling it all evening) so I put about a half cup of water on the bottom. I haven't had any dry meats since!

Excellent flavor. I added some white wine to the pan, and stuffed an onion in the chicken cavity.  Cooked two chickens (for 7 people) hoping for some leftovers, but they were both picked clean!

My chicken turned out moist, flavorful, and delicious! I doubled the spice rub because my chicken was 4.5 pounds, and mixed it with the olive oil to rub on the bird. We have so much left over... I'm excited about chicken sandwiches!

Skinned it, cooked it, and it was delicious!  (I saved the skin and the cooked carcass in a freezer bag to make chicken stock at a later date).

This was very easy and it came out wonderful, very tender and juicy.  I did take the advise of other reviewers and doubled the spices also rubbed the spices under the skin. I like to cook my chicken breast down, which allows all the juices to flow to the breast (just my preference) Thanks for the recipe my whole family loves it.

Very good, I did double the spices and next time I will take one of the recommendations to rub the seasoning under the skin for the breast because you could not taste it without eating the skin.

Turned out pretty good both times I made it.  Might try putting the rub under the skin next time for more flavor.  I'll be keeping this recipe for sure.

this was my very first whole chicken and i was very worried that it would not come out good because i am not the greatest cook (even with a simple recipe)i have to rate this recipe a 4.it's a great recipe but i agree with the others, you have to up the spices.  i didn't have a problem with my oven smoking. my very picky daughter asked if she could have her very own chicken next time. this recipe will go in to my weekly rotation. i began preparing dinner at 6:50 and was enjoying my wonderful meal by 8pm.  thank you for this great recipe, i will try it this weekend with chicken legs.

This recipe was great! I used a bigger chicken, so I doubled the recipe, and it turned out great. I added carrots and potatoes to the pan, they were delicious! I cooked the chicken breast down, until the last 20 minutes. It was so tender it was falling off the bone! I will definitely use this recipe again.

Good chicken really moist and tender. I marniated the chicken over night. After rubbing chicken with the herbs and spices I wrapped it in saranwrap. I cooked it at 250 degrees for 5 hours uncovered. For first 3 hours I cooked breast side down and then last 2 hours I cooked it breast side up. Doing this made the chicken breast much more flavorful.

Not bad.  Skipped the cayenne.  My chicken didn't cook all the way through on the time given so next time I will follow the review suggesting to up the heat!

We make this about once a week and it is picked clean because it is so good.  The skin gets almost crispy as if fried but much more healthy.  You may try adding onions and then add a can of sweet peas during the last 20 minutes for a nice side without another dish to clean.  I love this and I dont even like peas :)

Made this two nights ago with a 4.5 lb bird and it was really good! I didn't have any paprika or cayenne pepper, so I substituted with chili powder and crushed red pepper and it was just as good (next time will try with the intended spices). I did brine my bird for about 4 1/2 hours with 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup salt and some black pepper. I also used a bit of dried rosemary with the oregano and basil, and generously seasoned the bird in and out. I stuffed the cavity with 1/2 an onion, 2 garlic cloves and 2 tblsp butter. I baked the bird breast side down at 500 degrees for 15 minutes, and then at 450 degrees for another 15 minutes -- baking temps. and time from the Simple Whole Roasted Chicken also on Allrecipes. I then added 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the bottom of the pan, used that with the pan drippings to baste the bird and lowered the oven temp. to 425 degrees. I continued baking for 45 minutes. The chicken was so juicy and moist, and the pan drippings were awesome! Definitely had a kick to it! As I let the bird stand, I transfered the pan drippings into a sauce pan and added 1 tblsp flour with 1/2 cup water and poured it little-by-little until I got the consistency I wanted. SoOo good!!! We had the left-overs last night and it was still tasty! Going to make chicken salad with the remains, and then use the left over carcass to make chicken stock - nothing goes to waste here!

This dish was delicious.  I would defiantly rubbed the seasonings into the chicken as much as possible.  Even season a day before so that the seasonings will actually get into the meat.

We couldn't find any 3# chickens, so I did 2 5#. I tripled the seasonings and that worked well, added and extra 30 minutes and it was perfect. My husband couldn't quit exclaiming over the appearance...truly a beautiful dish, and it tastes just as good as it looks!  Thank you!

Very moist and tender.  I did use canola oil instead of olive and made pockets under the skin and rubbed spices under since we don't eat the skin.  Will make again.

A good recipe. I combined this recipe with the Raisin Rice Stuffed Chicken (also from this site). I soaked the chicken in brine for an hour and a half. AFter rinsing and patting dry, I brushed oil and then rubbed the spices. We don't get paprika here, so substituted it with chili powder. I baked it for an hour and half. Very moist and tasty.

This chicken is so easy and so yummy. Due to previous reviews I remove the skin, double the olive oil and season,  and cook it breast down.  The rest I followed as is and love this recipe!!

Great quick chicken recipe. I've tried it twice, once with the step-down temp. cooking and once at 350 for 2 hours. I'll stick with the 2 hours at 350. I tried the step-down last night and only half of the chicken was cooked at the end of the 60 min.

I thought this recipe was fabulous.  I used a 5.5 lb bird instead of a 3 pounder and doubled the spices.  I did not increase the cooking time because 180 degrees really is too high as the meat continues to cook as it cools covered.  I also put it in breast side down and it was soooo tender. I had no problems with smoke either.  Great recipe and great technique.

I read the reviews and I had no problem with the temperature in my oven.  It is Rapid Roast right, and it saved me an additional 45 minutes of cooking.  From now on any dish I make with whole chicken as a base I will incorporate this recipe. Oh yeah if your oven starts smoking you probably need to clean it.  A dirty and crusty oven causes uneven cooking, which in not good for any dish, especially if your looking for that perfect result.

The best roast chicken! Because of previous reviews mentioning smoke with the high heat, I did turn the temp down just a bit. I loved how the chicken is seasoned!

Used 3.5 lb chicken and doubled the seasonings. I mixed the seasonings in a bowl and added EVOO. I then took a basting brush and brushed the chicken all over. I wanted to put some seasonings under the skin but forgot to. I cooked for 20 mins at 450*, 25 mins at 400*, then 15 mins at 375*. I had to reduce to 375* because of smoking. Overall I was very happy with the chicken and my husband thought it was great. Next time I'm going to try it with chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and make sure to put the seasoning under the skin.

The recipe sounds like it would taste great, but it did smoke quite a bit and although it was supposed to cook fast, it only caused the skin to get burned and the rest of the chicken had to be cooked on a lower temperature to even it out.

This is the best roast chicken I've ever made! I doubled the seasoning mixture because I had an 8 lb. chicken and I rubbed the olive oil and seasoning under the skin as well. After reading the "smokey" reviews, I decided not to try the high heat method and I cooked it breast side down, with a cup of chicken broth, and covered at 350 for 2 hours.  It came out sooo juicy and very flavorful! Perfect!!

Very good chicken, but it sure made a mess, spattering all over my oven.  Next time I will do it in a pan on the gas grill.

How easy & flavorful!  I recommend following the recipe to a "T" so as not to overseason, the seasoning works for a 3-4 lb. bird.  I will use this recipe often, thanks for sharin!  One thing I'm puzzled by though is how in the world do you get 8 servings out of a 3lb. bird?  That feeds 2, maybe 3 in my house...ha,ha,ha.

I love this chicken! I usually increase all the spices as other reviewers have said, and usually add lots of vegetables to the pan as well as stuff the cavity. Some of my favorite combos are carrots, celery, and fennel bulb. Also onions and lemon quarters in the cavity. Never had trouble with a smoking bird, and I've made it many times. I usually make rice and use some of the drippings to flavor it.  Yum!

Like others I doubled spices and stuffed cavity with half an onion and two cloves garlic. My son said it was the best roast chicken he's ever had. Flavorful and very tender. Definitely a keeper!

Very juicy! Definitely makes a difference roasting it at a high heat and then lowering the temperature.  The skin was crispy and very flavorful.

i also doubled the spices plus stuffed it with garlic cloves, rosemary and one sliced yellow onion....and it really was moist and tasty!  i put some carrots and potatoes around it to cook in the juices and they as well were a hit with the fam.

This is the only way I roast chicken now.  It comes out so tender and delicious.  I often cut some potatoes into small cubes, spread them around the pan and put a little salt and garlic powder on them to roast in the juices.  It is such a nice meal and so easy to do.

Followed the recipe, but added some lime juice over the whole thing. The chicken tasted good, not great.  Came out a little greasy. Didn't taste very flavorful.  I probably should have increased the spices like many others did.  Will probably go back to the family favorite - a citrus beer but chicken.

This recipe makes a bird with a crisp skin and moist, tasty meat.  I used kosher salt and ground chipotle pepper in place of the cayenne.

Good Taste.  I rubbed the spices under the skin instead of sprinkling on top to have the flavor without eating the skin.  Next time I will double the spice mixture.  The chicken was juicy but needed to cook a little longer.  For those with smoking oven problems, when I've had that problem in the past it was because something had been spilled in the oven previously that hadn't been cleaned.

i wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars. I didn't care for the spicing a whole lot, but the method for cooking was brilliant and made a yummy skin!  I'll use my old spice and oiling methods, but will definitely use this method from here on for roasting.  Thanks!

I always put the spices with some butter underneath the skin to ensure that the meat picks up the flavor as I did with this recipe. This is a brilliant way to cook chicken, I will never go back to my old method of 350 degrees!

I will never roast a chicken the "normal" way again.  I liked the seasoning on this chicken very much, though I wouldn't hesitate to change up the seasonings and keep the cooking method.  This chicken was so juicy and perfect, I didn't even have enough left over for soup.  My family picked it clean.  I made a 3 1/2 lb. bird, so it took an additional 15 minutes to get it to 180 degrees.  Thank you so much for the recipe - you just cut my chicken cooking time by more than half!

The chicken meat was very moist.  Unfortunately, it had little to no taste, and I rubbed the spices under the skin.  I'll need to tweak the recipe itself to make it palatable but it is a great way to bake a chicken.  Leftovers were good for enchiladas!

If you like a delicious crispy skin, this is the way to roast your chicken.  Moist flavorful meat.  Always looking for a new way to roast a chicken.  Very nice, will make this way again.

This is my 2nd roast chicken recipe I've ever tried and I really love it !!!! The skin was so crispy and the meat was very juicy, tender and full of flavour.... even my bf, who never wanted to eat skin, can't resist this time :-D I baked my potatoes (in the last 1 hour) on the same tin with chicken, toast it with olive oil, dried rosemary and salt..... The fat of the chicken made my potatoes came out very yummy and juicy :) Thank you so much for sharing !!! :) This is our fav chicken from now on :)

Very good...thanks for sharing.  As to those who had a problem with the chicken not being done within the time stated, either check your oven or check the weight of the chick. I found it to be dead on with a little twaeking because my bird was bigger.

This recipe turned out very well. I covered the chicken for the first 40 minutes because my mom cooks her birds the fast way and covers them. I uncovered for the last 25 minutes. At 1:05 it my thermometer told me it was done. It was crispy on the outside, and succulent and moist inside. I had placed a cut up lime inside the cavity and between that and the spice mixture, the chicken had a lot of flavor. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Easy but a little bit on the bland side.  I expected from the title that it would be spicier.  I may make it again anyway.

Absolutely wonderful! Quick and easy-moist! I, in exchange of cayenne pepper[don't like hot stuff]substituted Sure Shot Sid Gunpowder Seasoning. Thanks for this great recipe.

Pretty good chicken recipe!  The chicken came out tender and juicy. I used a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature.  The spice mixture is good and makes the skin very tasty, but I wish I could figure out how to get the spices under the skin.  One tip: loosely cover the chicken with aluminum foil to prevent splatter in the oven.

We added some garli garni from Gilroy to the mixture as well and took some of the suggestions to put some under the skin and to be liberal with the spices.  We have one of the George Foreman contact roasters, and it was seasoned so nicely without all of the added salt!  Definitely a keeper.

Didn't have a whole chicken so I used 4 chicken breasts and doubled all the spices.  We thought this was just o.k.  Didn't care for the taste of cayene pepper so would leave that out if I make again.

This is a perfect chicken recipe if you'd like a simple, delicious roasted chicken, and you don't get it in the oven 2 hours before you want to eat!  Done in an hour, and perfectly moist.  In increased the salt in the rub to 1/2 teaspoon, and I forgot to reserve rub for the inside of the chicken, so I sprinkled in more salt and pepper and threw in half an onion.  Easy to remember, I'll use this anytime I want a fast roasted chicken!

We make this often...using a whole chicken or pieces.  I am generous with the spices and oil.  I skip the cayenne pepper and use seasoning salt instead of regular salt.  The total cooking time is approx 45 minutes in my oven for a whole 4 1/2 -5 pound chicken...a little shorter time for chicken pieces.  It is easy and always tasty!

This is a great recipe for roasting a chicken fast:)  It did make the house a little smokey, but most likely because it's more a sign my oven needs a cleaning.  LOL  Thanks so much for a great recipe I will be making again and again:)

This was absolutely wonderful. My hubby is VERY picky, and he loved it. I omitted the cayenne cuz he doesn't like spicy. Next time, I will use a roasting rack to keep the bird out of all the grease (I kept the skin on).

This chicken turned out very tasty and juicy....the only thing I didn't like was that it made the house a little smokey.  Not enough to set off the smoke detectors, but enough to have to open the window.  Otherwise, I LOVED this chicken!

I just tried this for the first time tonight, and must say, it turned out great!  I followed the cooking time and used different spices, just olive oil and lemon pepper seasoning.
I will definately make this again, trying the spice combo listed.  Thanks!

This was an okay recipe. My family thought the recipe was a little bland. I even rubbed the spices under the skin of the chicken and let sit in the refrigerator for 4+ hours before baking...still thought the flavor was lacking. I will try this recipe again but will let marinate in spices overnight.

I found this recipe to be very good.  This was my first time doing a roast chicken, I had no cook time problems and it came out very juicy.  I did add a little more than the amount called for in spices and realized I shouldn't have, as it left the skin with a bit of an overwhelming flavor, but still delicious.  I would rate the chicken itself 4 stars, but am giving it 5 stars due to the minimum amount of cooking time and preparation put into it.

This recipe was great! We were dying for an easy slow-cooker recipe and this was the answer! We doubled the spices (cuz we like spicy) and rubbed it under the skin rather than on (cuz we don't like skin) and it was wonderful! Will make this one again!

We loved this recipe. I stuff a half a lemon and half an onion into the cavity of the chicken before baking. It turns out great everytime.

I was expecting lots more flavor from reading the other reviews.  Tender, but really not worth the effort--my normal recipe has much more flavor.

This chicken was so flavorful and easy to make!  It turned out juicy and moist.  Most of these ingredients are common enough that you will probably have them at home already.  The only thing was that the oil/juices was abundant at the end.. highly recommended!

This is our favorite chicken recipe... it comes out perfect every time. I double the spice mix, but everything else is exactly as it is. I start taking the birds temp after 30 minutes at the 400 degree setting and lots of times it’s already done. 
This is seriously the best chicken I’ve ever eaten and I serve it with mushroom risotto and a vegetable! My husband wants it once a week! Lol Thank you for this recipe.

I chose this recipe because it is "rapid roast."  Used Lawrey's and extra black pepper, rather than the spices listed, because I don't eat the skin. Stuffed chicken with fresh rosemary. ROASTED IN A CAST IRON SKILLET, and I believe that is a great way to make this meal. Will try the designated spices next time. My chicken was 5 pounds. Baked at 450 for 20 minutes, then at 400 for about 40. NO SMOKE!!! I have NO IDEA what people are talking about!  I cut up red potatoes into bite sized pieces and chunks of onion all mixed up with spices and olive oil. TAKE THE CHICKEN OUT OF THE FRIDGE AHEAD OF TIME, so you aren't baking a cold chicken, because it will take longer to cook! VERY MOIST! Thanks for this recipe. : )

Great for a quick/easy to throw together meal for the family. One note, cover it about 40 ish minutes in (or until browned to your liking) then continue cooking another 40. Some bits were pink on just the hour cooking.

Very moist. Very simple. Will follow Dove Russo's suggestion next time to double the spice mix and rub half of it under the skin for more flavour. Thanks for posting!

I didn't wash the chicken - just patted it dry.  Many recipes warn that it can spread bacteria.  Also, I doubled up on the spices.  Fabulous, moist and delicious!  I'm making chicken soup from the carcass today.

This was really good, and some of the spices were in the drippings, so I made pan gravy to go on the mashed potatoes. I also served glazed carrots on the side. I am typically a stovetop cook, so I appreciated the simplicity of this recipe and was really happy that it turned out as good as it did. I would have liked the skin a bit more crispy, but I’ll figure that out as I get better at roasting stuff. Thanks for the recipe.

Tried this to night. I spatchcocked the chicken, and put spices under skin and sprinkled on the inside.  This cut the cooking time by about half an hour.  
No smoke. Checken was very juicy. Liked the flavor but will add garlic powder. Was not too spicy.  I had doubled the seasonings.  Skin was not as crispy  as I had hoped.  Would give it 41/2 stars. Try it.

I added 1/4 tsp each onion powder and garlic powder. I have a rotisserie oven so rubbed chicken down with season mix and we had home made store rotisserie chicken! Yum . This is a delicious dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans. Leftovers were great to make chicken lot pie as seasoning was not too strong or barbeque flavor.

That was the best chicken I'd had in a long time. I loved all the spices an am going to continue using them. So easy to bake instead of frying as it frees me to do other things. My family enjoyed and will be making it again.

I like to roast chicken because I'm a lazy widower and my dog and I both enjoy chicken. I like the way high heat methods turn out . This one is really good and the "spice" can be adjusted easily by adding more cayenne (or rub with hot sauce+butter). I cut some birds in half so I can season each separately, I'm sure my four legged friend would not agree with the hot spice.

Excellent!   I also add 1/4 t  garlic powder to the spice mix for a single chicken. I make 2- 5.5lb ish  to 6lb whole chickens so I double the spice mix and also rub some of the spice under the skin. I bake at 350 degrees for about 2 hours. Comes out delicious but oven temps may vary so use a thermometer and check temps about 30 minutes before finish time

Very good, excellent comfort food! Can we please just review the recipes as written? For example,  please don't give this recipe a low rating because you "don't eat the skin".  How about rating a skinless chicken recipe instead?

Looked at the recipe and my jaw fell open. I haven't seen a 3 lb whole chicken in more than 25 years. Paid an exorbitant amount for the smallest gourmet chicken recently and it was 4 lbs.
Normally I find that chickens are now between 5 and 6 lbs. To create the expected results, should I double the ingredients for the flavors to come out as expected.
Thanks for answering an obvious question.

The recipe sounds reasonable however I would not waste my spices by marinating the skin of the chicken.  I would pull back the skin, drizzle the oil and spread the spices directly on the meat then drizzle a little oil on top of the skin and then cook in the oven.  My oven only goes to 400f.

Loved this. Did it in an Instant Pot. No olive oil. Spices all from recipe. About 1/2 to 3/4 cp stock in the bottom of the pot. Put the chicken on the steamer rack. 15 minutes on manual, high. Perfect. Used boneless, skinless breasts. Moist, and love this spice mix.

Really wouldn't consider this spicy.  There's a little pep to it, but not much - & I doubled the spices.  Good, not amazing.

Similar to what I make (via Mom and Jacques Pepin). 165*F is perfect. Don’t be afraid of red at the joints. The thigh must have clear juices. At 180* the Breast Meat is so dry it would choke a horse. 
Nice herb/spice mix!

I mostly followed this recipe. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I left it out. When I changed the temp to 450 F I added garlic butter that I let melt on top. I did cover it with the aluminum foil as recommended. The chicken not only looked great but it also turned out moist.the way I love it. Even the whitest parts were very moist. Thank you. :)

Made it,  triple the spices since the chicken is almost 9 lbs. Rubbed the spices in and out of the bird, put in the fridge for few hrs before I placed it the oven bag and baked till the legs move freely. It came so soft but the spices are not enough,  next time will try to bake it but without the oven bag.

Excellent! Out of habit, I tend to double the amount of seasoning to rub some under the skin. We don't care for any bird with just the seasoning on the outside.  The seasoning worked well and we had moist chicken, with a crisp skin.  Inserted a probe and remove chicken @ 165 F, let rest for 15-20 min. Perfect, easy, and delicious!

I had a 5 lb chicken and let it in the 400 degree oven 10 min longer.  Didn't need to and it turned out a little dry.  Will definately make it again.

I make this all the time and I have for years after finding this recipe. My chicken comes out perfect everytime. I think the only difference between the way I make it and the recipe is that I rub all of the seasonings on the outside as well as the inside of the chicken.   It says to sprinkle on the outside, I find rubbing it in is more effective. Very easy and tasty recipe.

This is my Favorite recipe!! I've tweaked it a bit over the times I've tried it! I've doubled the seasons, added onion celery and lemon/lime to the cavity for a more intense flavor and to keep chicken moist! I also cook it on 375 the entire time, about 1 hr 45-2 hrs! So good!

I doubled the spices and cooked it with the breast side down first, then when there was about 20 minutes left I cooked it breast side up.   It was juicy and tasted very good. I would make this again.

Excellent recipe although I used traditional heat and cooking time (350 for 20 minutes per #). I tripled the spice amounts and added 1/2 tsp celery seed, 3/4 tsp each garlic powder, onion powder and thyme. I started it breast down then turned it breast up for the last 30 minutes. Remember to rest it 15 minutes before carving.

I would suggest putting the chicken on top of slices of some good thick bread  before placing in the oven  The bread will get very brown and is  nice to eat on the side.   All the chicken juice runs into it.  You might want to place a quartered lemon in the cavity prior to cooking.

I've made this twice in one week. Each time I make it we have 0 leftovers. Its that good. I love that the chicken comes out juicy and flavorful, with crispy skin, all that a roast chicken should be. And it doesn't take forever to cook.  I mix up the spices depending on what I'm wanting.

This is a really good recipe. Here is what I did: doubled the spices, rubbed them all over the chicken including under the skin, and rubbed some butter over the chicken instead of the EVOO. I cooked the chicken breast side down but  flipped the bird the last 20 mins of roasting. I also added potatoes (garlic/oregano, salt+pepper) underneath and around the chicken in the last 40 mins of cooking time. 

I think next time I would add parsley and an onion to the cavity of the chicken. 

Really great recipe! Thanks for sharing

This recipe helped me realize how simple it is to roast my own chicken for less than $4 versus buying it for $8 pre cooked. I see more roast in my future.

We love the spices.  We have a container with the same mixture and use it on a variety of meats.  Great idea.

I loved the ease and speed of this recipe!  You do have to be careful that you follow the size of the chicken or it won't cook through.  The mistake I made was not rubbing the spices under the skin.  When the skin is pulled off, there go the spices (duh).  All in all, an excellent recipe.

I used a 6 lb. chicken,  so of course increased the spices, and did add some garlic powder.  Put 1/2 an onion and some celery sticks in the cavity.  Like some had noted, I spread butter on and under the skin along with the spices.  Used the 450 degrees for the first 20 minutes then 1 1/2 hours at 400 degrees.  Turned out great.

The roasting method is what I use for all of my bone-in chicken.
A simple honey-mustard glaze would work on this also,
just use equal parts honey and any mustard, drizzle on and spread with the back of a spoon 10-15 minutes before the bird is doneand use any leftover glaze as a dipping sauce.

made it by the recipe, thought the spice was good but doesn't carry thru the meat too well,  I thought the high temps. dried the meat out too much.

Followed the recipe, with one exception, I added 1/4 tsp of ground thyme to the rub mixture, placed 1/2 an onion, 1 large carrot coarsely chopped to the bottom of the roasting pan and placed a 1/2 lemon in the cavity.  Chicken was browned to perfection and full of flavor.

Great recipe. I had a 5.25lb. bird. I mixed the spices into the olive oil and doubled the amount. Then I rubbed that under the skin and on the skin. I cooked it at 500 degrees for 25 minutes, then down to 450 degrees for another 25 minutes, finally, I lowered the temp to 400 degrees and cooked until an internal temp of 160 degrees and let it rest to a temp of 165. Great yummy recipe. Oh I also stuffed the cavity with onions, garlic, carrots, celery and parsley before roasting. The pan drippings made an awesome white wine and shallot sauce too.

I just wanted to make a comment but I had to fill in the stars so I chose four because I have been doing chicken at high heat for an hour for ages! I do a stand up chicken - put it on one of those metal stands and roast it standing up. I find it cooks faster and more evenly. I do it at 400 or 425 for one hour, and it comes out so lovely and juicy. I'd never go back to roasting a chicken lying down at a lower heat!

Used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, baked at 450 for 20 minstrel and chicken came out moist and delicious and tasted like rotisserie chicken.   Love, love, love.

I use a similar technique for turkey - worked out pretty well and good spice rub flavor.  Next time may try to run under skin and cook breast-down. Fingerling potatoes in bottom were too small - they got all dried out.

I got a chance to try n test this recipe for  my family 's Sunday dinner.....I found that if you follow the recipe to the letter you can't go wrong.   The only  thing I did differently was to stuff the cavity with a sliced onion and some chicken stuffing and then when I needed to turn it down for the last 40 min. I added white wine to pour over the chicken......It had a great flavor , it was crispy and very tender and overall it was a tasty meal to throw together for a Sunday dinner ......this recipe will be added in my family's recipe book??????  this was a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I did not use olive oil -- no need for extra grease -- and I roast at 450 for about 55-60 minutes without lowering the heat.  I do turn the chicken over about halfway through so the skin is crispy all over.  It is easy and delicious.

I quit eating chicken skin, so the spices are a bit of a waste. And yes. The one star is only for the title. If you want an amazing, juicy chicken get over to Chef John's salted roast chicken. And I can't recommend this enough, make the sauce at least once. 

Lastly, 165 will be obtained during the cookdown on the counter, after about 15 minutes. Remember to keep those juices for Chef John's sauce.

We don't have a lot of things to experiment with flavors at my house, so as far as a simple recipe that also tastes great, I was happy with the outcome of this. We didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand, but it still tasted great.

I used a 5 pound bird and worked out great. The heat on the skin from the rub was on point. The Chicken came out juicer than I expected. The family loved it! I did add a couple ingredients of my own because I do love to experiment a little and try to put my own twist on things. I added fresh Ginger, fresh Garlic and a whole Lemon with holes poked in it, and put it all inside cavity to see how it turned out. The bird came out delicious but did not taste any of the ingredients that I put inside. This is a great meal for family specially if your trying put something together pretty quick and easy. Thanks

Followed the recipe with minor modifications.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular.  Also put the rub under the skin and on it.  Stuffed the cavity with an onion and a few cloves of garlic.  This was the best roasted chicken we've had in a long while.  The family loved it.  I added chicken broth to the drippings and made gravy.  Most delicious!

There aren't enough stars to give this delicious, moist, roast chicken! The only change I made was to use Cajun seasoning (Slap Ya Mama)instead of the salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne mixture. As someone else suggested, I also put in potato chunks brushed with olive oil and seasoned with granulated garlic for the last 30 minutes. The only complaint from anyone wass that they ate so much they couldn't eat more!

Baked 20 minutes on 450, then dropped the heat to 375 for 20 minutes per pound. I stuffed it with a whole onion and three sprigs of rosemary in addition to tearing back a bit of the skin and shoving some of the spice blend in between the skin and meat. I then poured in 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Best tasting roasted chicken I've ever made!

This is a great recipe! I add some lemon to the cavity, and rub the spice all over vs sprinkling.  Put it in a SMALL baking dish as directions state- it makes a big difference in the amount of juices you get and keeping the bird tender! The gravy it makes is delish!

This is a GREAT recipe for chicken! I have this already saved & it's my go-to every time I roast chicken. Smoke? I don't know how that happens to some - it's never been a problem here.. I have a small amount of trouble timing out a larger chicken; around here you can't FIND anything smaller than 4.5 lbs. or so if you're lucky. This chicken has ALWAYS come out perfectly when roasted as directed time-wise. 
I agree there is not much 'spice flavor' if you don't eat the skin; however, I find draining most of the the "fats" & using the juice for making gravy (I don't because I have no success w/homemade gravy!) - or an "au jus" type of thing as I do makes for an excellent taste for those who miss that spice flavor.......

Yum!  What a quick and easy way to make a chicken! After making it the first time, I made it again the following week and it still came out amazing.  So delicious.  I was definitely liberal with the seasoning and rubbed it all underneath the skin, then seasoned the stop if the skin with some salt.  The skin was nice and crispy and the chicken was so tender and juicy.  This had been added into the rotation of common dinners.

I doubled the spices as well, and glad I did- because the spices were yummy!! It wasn't the best roasted chicken I've had, but I think I overcooked it. I get paranoid about cooked meat, so I put it in an extra 10 minutes, and don't think it needed it. I'd stick to the time in the recipe!!!

This was very easy & quick to make. The flavor was good and chicken was moist with perfectly brown/crisp skin. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I think I will double the spices as other reviewers suggested as I would have preferred more flavor. I definitely love the roasting method. Thanks for sharing.

This is one of the best whole chickens I have ever made.  I doubled the spices to really coat it and it was delicious.  That initial high temp crisps the skin and ensures the moistness of the meat.  Very, very quick and easy.  Thanks

We made this on our gas grill and the result was FABULOUS!!  This method of cooking the chicken results in a wonderfully crispy and beautifully colored skin.  We have a remote thermometer that is great when making this type of recipe - I love that thing!  Thanks to Nancy for submitting this recipe.  We'll be doing this again and again!  UPDATE – 4/13/14:  We cooked this on the grill again, but this time I used the spice rub from Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style, also on this site.  Very good!

My chicken came out moist and the skin was perfect.  I was surprised how moist the chicken was even the wing which usually dries out on me.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I did get some smoking in my oven, but that was because it was dirty a clean oven shouldn't smoke.  Thanks Nancy for the recipe.  I will do this one again.

This has become my go-to recipe for roast chicken. I've made it several times and it's been flawless each time. The chicken is always moist, the skin is delicious, and it's so quick and easy. I throw a lemon inside the cavity to give it a subtle lemony flavor.

This was very good, although it did take considerably longer to cook and as others have said, the spices didn't totally permeate the meat. But it was very simple and we liked it, so thanks for sharing!

Followed recipe except doubled everything for 5 lb roaster.  Average result.  Next time will spice and let sit overnight as someone suggested and think that will make better - spices will permeate meat.

My husband says: Tastes so Good!!! So easy to make, no smoking the house or making a big mess in the kitchen. Had pretty much all the ingredients except the dried basil. Used thyme instead.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the advice of doubling the spices and placing some under the skin.  Moist and juicy with a nice kick of spices!  A definite repeat!

Nice seasoning, but wish the skin had been crispy. I threw in a veggie assortment and it made a very nice, one-pot meal. Will make again.

I took other reviewers suggestions and placed the spices under the skin.  I was extra generous on the spices and still thought this was bland.  I won't be making this again.

I used this recipe as a temperature and time guide to roast a chicken.  I didn't use the seasoning in this recipe.  Instead I mixed together Montreal Chicken and Rosemary Garlic seasoning then roasted it according to the recipe.  PERFECT!!!!  Crispy skin and tender fall off the bone moist meat.  This is the best way to roast a chicken.

The chicken is very moist and flavorful.  I marinated the chicken overnight as another reviewer suggested.  I also doubled the spices, stuffed cavity with garlic and onion.  I did not have a problem with the high temp as other readers mentioned.  However, the chicken did take at least 20 minutes longer to cook.

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site.  Simple, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I wouldn't cook a whole chicken any other way.  Thanks for submitting!

This was a very good chicken.  It wasn't really rapid roast though, but it turned out moist and good.  I rubbed the seasonings under the skin also to give it more flavor,.  I did 25 minutes at 450, 30 minutes at 400 and 30 minutes at 350, but I was also using a larger chicken.  Over all, I'd make this receip again.

This was excellent!  I doubled recipe and added cooking time, as our chicken was nearly 6lbs.  Roasted breast-side down for the first hour, then turned over for an add'l 45 minutes.  Couldn't find my oregano so I used thyme instead, and added a dash of garlic powder.  Delicious!  Drippings would have made great gravy, will do that next time.

Winner!  Winner!  Chicken Dinner!  The chicken was moist and the skin was flavorful.  Next time we make this, we are going to put the seasonings under the skin to season the meat a little better.  Thank you for this one!  We loved it!

After reading a lot of reviews, this is what I did. I had a 4.91 lb chicken and cooked it at 350 for 1hr 40min in an oven bag. Before I cooked it, I cut off all the skin, then in a small bowl mixed all the ingredients with the olive oil (I doubled everything). then I poured in on the chicken and rubbed it in with my hands.  My husband and I both LOVED this chicken.  It was even better the next day as leftovers.

Very moist and flavorful. I did mix spices into the olive oil and then rubbed all over chicken and under the skin. Roasted just as the recipe said..breast side down and it came out very juicy.

It was okay.  When I saw "Rapid Roast" in the title, I wondered how someone could cook a chicken fast and still get it done.  Whenever I roast a chicken, it takes 1 hour, so this recipe was not any faster or "rapid".  Rapid would be less than 30 min.

This was an excellent recipe.  I am a very amature cook and I managed excellent results.  I did add a tablespoon of ground red pepper for the rub to make it a bit more hot and cut up lemmons into slices to stuff inside the bird to get additional falvoring.

This was delicious!!!  I made it today for dinner and can't believe how fast it was.  My husband loved it.  I did not get the smoky oven that some other reviewers had mentioned and the chicken was moist and filled with flavor.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I really liked this recipe and most importantly my boyfriend did. CHANGES: I marinated it in the spices for 24 hours before baking it. Also I baked it at 350 for about 2 hours, basting it after the first hour.I followed other reviewers and doubled the spices (not the salt) and added 1/4 cup (about) of water to the pan. DELICIOUS!

Excellent! I followed the advice of throwing in red potatoes after the 20 minute mark. They were cooked to perfection! I also threw some garlic in the cavity at that point. Fabulous! Fell off the bone. Loved that I could throw this together in no time at all!

This recipe was very easy and delicious. The chicken turned out very moist and flavourful, although I added a couple of changes. To the spice mixture, I added garlic powder, and substituted the cayenne pepper for cajun powder. I also stuffed  a chopped onion into the cavity. When I reduced the temperature to 400, I added some chopped potatoes (drizzled with olive oil, rosemary and garlic) around the chicken, and they were ready when the chicken was. All around, an excellent roasted chicken recipe! Will use again in the future!

This is the quickest way to cook a whole chx. I did mine slightly different. I put my chicken on a beer can holder than placed in a heavy duty pie dish to catch the drippings. Half of the beer went into the pie dish and the other half stayed in the can and that's what I put in the beer can holder. I rubbed my chicken down with a mixture of oive oil and Dinosaur Bar-B-Que Cajun Foreplay spice rub, it is very much the same as the spices in this recipe. Came out great.

I, like many others had the problem with smoke. In fact my fire alarm went off :) So, needless to say, I will try cooking at a lower temp. for longer next time. I will however say that the spices were good when doubled.

Great! Great. My family loved this recipe!
 I did have the smoke! Next time, I will cook at 350 for 2 hours.

Loved this! My oven could probably use a cleaning so my house was smoky, but the taste is fab!! I had a big 5 lb plus chicken so I upped the seasonings & cooking time a bit. Everyone loved it. Cooked it breast down.

This is a great cooking method! I've never cooked a whole chicken before but bought one because it was on sale. I used a lemon-herb mixture instead of the one in the recipe. While there is a lot of smoke associated with cooking at such high heat, it wasn't bad, and all I had to do was use my stove fan. For those with cooking time difficulty, I would recommend a meat thermometer. I did have to turn the heat down to 350 and cook for a tiny bit longer than the time stated in the recipe but it wasn't a big deal. Would definitely make again!

This is a good spice mixture and made for a flavorful chicken. I took the skin off before applying the olive oil and roasted potatoes with it. It smoked a lot when I was making it. Smoke was pouring out of the chicken's cavity. But it didn't affect the taste.

Even if you don't season the chicken according to the recipe exactly it comes out awesome! I've cooked all my whole chickens this way for a over a year now and it turns out great every time. :)

Great recipe, the only thing I would have done different is add some more 'spicy' spices. I found that although the name says it's spicy, it could have used some more. But,otherwise quick and easy meal. I made two at once and used the leftover for chicken quesidillas.

I mixed the spices into the olive oil and rubbed it all over the chicken.  Just easier/faster that way I thought.  Great flavor and super easy!  If I ever read the manual on the oven, there's probably a way to time it to turn the heat down to make it even easier but that'll never happen :)

This was very good. I put in on a weber gril. It took about 1 1/2 hours I think to get the internal temp to 175 degrees. I took someone elses advice and doubled the seasoning and rubbed it under the skin also. Very good.

The chicken turned out nice and tasty, but I had to roast it for an additional 15-20 minutes.  The texture is perfect; it is moist and tender.  Yum.

This produces the most crispy outside and tender inside on baked chicken that I have ever tasted! This is great. I use a whole chicken or even thighs and legs and it is still great. I love this recipe, it is the only way I bake chicken now. Thanks!!

This chicken was okay.  The skin and seasoning was really good, I doubled it as most people suggested and rubbed the seasonings under and over the skin.  I had a 4 pound chicken, cooked it for the recommended time and the white meat was dry and flavorless.  My husband really liked it but I have a thing about dry chicken.  The legs, thighs and wings were really good though which is why I am giving it 4 stars. I also didn't experience any smoking as others reviews wrote.

This recipe is so good.  I had no problems with my oven smoking and it is not the cleanest oven.  Can't wait to rub it on some chicken breasts and grill them this summer.

This was a great roasted chicken recipe. I added more spices then called for as I didn't measure..just guessed since I had a larger chicken. Like many other reviewers, I rubbed the seasonings and olive oil under the skin in addition to the top. I think this really made the taste and it was very moist. My cooking time was quite a bit longer but I had stuffed half an onion in the cavity and as I stated previously; I had a larger bird. I also added garlic powder (personal preference) to the seasoning. Unlike some reviewers, I did not have a problem with my oven smoking. Not sure why so many have that issue. Thanks for a great roasted chicken recipe.

Update: Wow, this rub is awesome with pork roast. I include onion and garlic powder in my mix. Personal preference. I cook this in a large casserole dish and add potatoes and carrots (if I have them) during the last 45 minutes to hour of cook time. The potatoes soak up all the seasoning and flavor from the meat it's cooked with and it's all in one dish, which is awesome.

I've been roasting chickens for several years and they usually turn out OK but this high heat technique has produced the best roast chicken I've done yet.  I highly recommend trying it even though it does have a tendency to smoke up the house a bit.

The taste of this was wonderful. The seasonings were perfect. But I had to give only 3 stars because the technique just didn't work. As others noted, this creates an awful amount of smoke. I tried pouring off the grease every 20 minutes, but this didn't help enough. I would like to try the concept again, maybe starting at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and finishing at 350 degrees until done. Either way, I'll use the seasoning mix whenever I do roast my next chicken, regardless of the procedure.

Excellent recipe.  This was so easy to do, my husband made it the first time!  I also played around with it a bit, placing a clove of garlic in the cavity with a hint of garlic powder added to the rub.  I also tented it for the last 15 minutes to prevent over-browning.

I agree with Paloma. This recipe is good but it needs more spices and especially salt! I liked that it didn't take long to make. It is an easy recipe and I like easy.

My first roasted chicken and pretty good for a first try!  I took the advice of others and doubled the spices.  Since I used a 7.5 lb bird, I extended the cooking time by about 25 min.  I also rubbed the spices under the skin.  The flavor was good and I plan to use the leftovers for chicken salad tomorrow.

We cooked this in our large Dutch oven and filled the oven with potatoes, carrots, pieces of onion and garlic.  We also filled the cavity with spices and celery.  The vegetables were really delicious.

This is a great recipe! If you don't know what to do with a whole chicken try this recipe!! it's easy to prepare! My suggestion is to definitely try using more of all the spices! including salt! I also stuffed the chicken with a whole onion cut in half! But I definitely like how crispy the skin is! great recipe!

This cooking method was great. The chicken turned out moist and the skin was nice and crispy. I didn't use the spices from this recipe though, I used the Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style.

This was pretty good.  I stuffed the cavity with celery for additional flavor.  We do not eat the skin, so to avoid a pretty bird with no flavor, I made pockets between the skin and the meat and put the seasonings there.  It made a huge difference in the flavor of the meat.  I didn't put the paprika or the cayene pepper in it as I didn't have either, but I did put dried sliced garlic in the spices.  I think the only thing that could have made it better was a bit more salt, but the meat was well flavored after cooking.  I'd make this again while playing around with the spices.

I made this chicken for my husband, and he liked it a lot.  I used a 4 pound chicken, increased all the spices except the cayenne pepper, and increased the cooking time by about 15 minutes.  We like the flavor of the Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style recipe on this site a little better, but this recipe is a bit easier and much quicker to make.

The seasoning kept the chicken from being too bland, but I doubled the amount of seasoning and it still wasn't "spicy".

I also did not follow the instructions on cooking.  I used The Joy of Cooking's method which did smoke a little towards the end, but nothing like one reviewer said.

This was good, but not as wonderful as I had expected it too be. I felt it needed more flavor even though I doubled the spices. The skin did crisp up really nice though and it was a pretty quick cook for a whole chicken.

This is a great recipe and it's easy. I baked two 5-lb. chickens at the same time in a large roasting pan. I had to cook them for 1 hour and 30 minutes to reach the 180 degrees. The seasoning on the skin was very tasty.

This actually smelled better then it tasted. If I could, I would rate it a 3 1/2. Although the skin was tasty, the white meat was a bit bland;perhaps double the seasonings and rub more under the skin. I did add cut up potatoes and onions to the pan with some olive oil and salt and those were really delicious.  It also took almost 2 hours to cook!

Although it did cook relatively quickly (as far as roast chicken goes, that is), I wasn't a big fan of it.  I don't like skin on my chicken, and once you removed that spicy, crispy outershell, what was left was a slightly dry, bland interior.  I much prefer stuffing my chickens with aromatics and rubbing spices under the skin to make the meat flavorful, since that's the most important part, but I was feeling lazy last night and wanted a chicken, darn it, post haste!  It's a simple recipe for those who are just learning to roast chickens, but for me, I'll go with something more complicated next time.  On the other hand, the spicy potatoes I had in the pan were quite tasty. :)

This was ok, I actually liked my potatoes that I roasted in the pan and drizzled with olive oil, garlic and salt much better than the chicken.  The juices from the chicken made the potatoes taste wonderful!

this was really easy and quick.  i think it tastes a lot like those roast chicken you can get at grocery stores but way better.  i doubled the spices when i made it just because it looked like it wasnt enough to cover the chicken.

It's hard to find a recipe with the perfect cooking time and temperature to make a roast chicken juicy, but the skin crispy- this one worked!  Also, very easy to prepare and I had all of the ingredients, so I know i'll make this again.

I made this recipe following the directions almost to the letter, and it was wonderful.  The best roast chicken I've ever made, second only to chicken roasted all day in a slow-cooker...but a very close second!  I did cover the chicken for the first 40 minutes to prevent overbrowning.  The skin was crispy and beautifully browned, the meat was flavorful and juicy.  I saved the recipe and will definitely use it again!

This turned out awesome.  I quadrupled the spices and added a tsp of garlic powder.  I also used about 2 TBSP of olive oil.  I rubbed down the entire outside of the bird, the inside cavity, and under the skin on the breast meat.  It turned out so moist and yummy.  My bird was about 4.5 lb and it took about 30 min. extra to cook but I never did cover it.  Perfect.

We loved this chicken. I must admit, I didn't rapid roast it though. I started out at the recomended temp, but then I lowered the temp to 375F & covered the chicken w/ a foil tent about 40 minutes into the cooking. The skin was still crispy & the meat was juicy & flavorful.

I made this last night for dinner. I added a cover to it after 40 minutes for fear it looked like it was drying out. By the end it was so moist it fell off the bone. Very good. Thank you.

Excellent recipe.  I will roast chicken this way from now on.  I stuffed 1/2 a lemon and 1/2 an onion in the cavity.  I also rubbed the spices under the skin.  YUMMY!

Really good chicken recipe.  Too spicy for my baby, she got a rash, but the rest of us loved it.  Cooked fast and was nice and juicy.

This was absolutely great!!  So simple to make! I did add several garlic cloves and fresh lemon wedges to the chicken cavity before putting in the oven. The fresh seasonings made this entree delicious!

I thought that this chicken was really good!  I used the technique more than the spice combination and it turned out so moist!  You can use any spices that you like.  I used garlic granules, aleppo pepper, oregano, and basil.  My skin got a little burnt but I just peeled it off and the chicken underneath was great.  Maybe my oven was too hot or maybe it was the spices I used, but I'm not crazy about eating the skin anyway so it didn't really bother me.  Serve it with your favorite vegetables and this is a simple and tasty meal for your family.

We loved this recipe and we'll have it again!  It was very juicy and flavorful.  I put about 1/4 of a large onion inside and also added a few minutes to the cooking time since my bird was a bit bigger than what the recipe called for.

I need 10 stars! This is sooooo good, that I have actually made up a big batch of the seasoning and stored it in a little container to make this meal even quicker. I've been using 5 lb chickens and increasing the cooking time by about 15 minutes. Perfection. The skin is to die for.

We really liked this...although I must admit we didn't do the "rapid roast."  We had time and I would just as soon bake it at normal temp. for longer.  Having said that, the seasonings are lovely!  I think I got a little carried away with the chili powder, but that's just me!  I like kick!

Will make again!

This was one of the most moist chickens we have ever had!  We didn't find it spicy at all but it was really good and very easy!  Next time might try rubbing some of the spices under the skin.  Did add 1/2 an onion to the cavity for flavor and moistness.  Will definitely make again!

Just wonderful. I tried it first on our family, and decided it a worthy "company dish." I made this for my father and his lady-friend when they came to visit us, and it turned out perfectly.

For a first-timer, I was very pleased with how this meal tasted.  The only change I did was to add an onion to the cavity.  It took my bird more than an hour to finish (about 1 1/2 hrs), but I was also being cautious about the internal temperature because it was my first roast.  I would recommend this to all beginners, and I will be making this again and again

Thank you, thank you, thank you Nancy!  This recipe restored my faith in roast chicken (and my boyfriend's, who has endured multiple roast chicken fiascos before bravely vowing to give it one more try).  I followed the recipe except I used Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasonings in place of the cayenne and paprika.  I was so pleased with the results (super tasty and crispy skin!) and my boyfriend agreed that this was fantastic.  Thanks again!

This recipe really had potential. I do have to admit, the flavor was great. I left out the oregano and basil but replaced with garlic powder and Lawry's Seasoning. I threw about 4 cloves of garlic in the cavity. As for the cooking time, UGH, it took double the cooking time for mine. Nope, nothing is wrong with my oven ~ it's just this recipe, the chicken and my oven *didn't get along*, I suppose, LOL. The meat turned out slightly dry. If it wouldn't have turned out dry .... I would have given the recipe 4 stars. But, I feel that since the cooking time was off and the meat was dry ... well, that was a turn off for us. I'm glad so many people had better luck with this recipe than I did ~ because the flavor really WAS good! Thanks anyway! :o)

I have made this recipe so times that I  just had to reprint it because I couldn't read the paper anymore!  This redipe makes the skin of the chicken extra crispy and full of flavor.  The chichen is always so tender and juicy and the leftovers, when picked from the bone, go great in my chicken casseroles! Thank you!!!

This was a great, easy recipe, with a (relatively)short cooking time!  A great time saver for when you don't think far enough in advance to cook something for hours.
