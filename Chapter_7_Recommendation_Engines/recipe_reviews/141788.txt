I do not like to have to choose a rating when I change a recipe, but am forced to do so!  Due to the fat content, I made changes and used low fat sour cream and margarine.  It tasted pretty good.  Caraway is an interesting combo with turnip.

A simple twist to a favourite sidedish of mine. Will definitely add this to my recipe box.

I cut the turnips down to 3/4 lb and the caraway to 1 tsp and kept the other ingredients the same.  This was a nice change from mashed potatoes and the caraway and butter tasted great with the turnip.

We have used this recipe every Christmas for the last several years. It is fabulous and much better than plain old mashed turnip. We always called the yellow flesh variety Turnips but I guess they are actually rutabagas. I like to use a power blender when the turnip is woody.
We always get rave reviews from our guests.

I made the recipe with turnips, and it was OK--not as sweet as it would have been with rutabagas.
