Snaps for Phyllis! This turned out wonderful. I'm always looking for a way to cook eggplant that isn't deep fried or bitter. This is it. I even varied it a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients. Can tomatoes worked just fine as did dried herbs and no celery. Great recipe for my whole family!

good dish but not for the effort necessary. If I were to change anything, I would use more breadcrumbs and more Mozz (top fully covered)  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe. It was easy to make and I was suprised that everyone enjoyed it as much as they did. I cooked whole grain pasta and put them in the bottom of the dish before adding the garden medley on top then breadcrumbs and mozzerella covering the top as another suggested. it was great i served it with oven baked chicken breast and it was wonderful.

I have alot of salmon from a summer in Alaska and toss a filet of shredded salmon into this casserole when I make it - I love it!  I'll also substitute eggplant for yellow squash and potatoes.  It's a great and versatile recipe!

Super way to use all those fresh veggies in the fall.  My husband was wary but after his first bite he couldn't get enough.  Even warmed up in the microwave the next day it was very good

This was a great way to have eggplant without it being breaded and fried.  I did cut the oil back a bit and used a little pam, used half panko half regular bread crumbs and used low fat cheese. Really good, thanks!

The flavor was awesome!  I had many compliments.  I had a butternut squash to use and also added a hot pepper or two.  The issue I had is that the meal was extremely liquidly.  Next time may add tapioca or coat some of the veggies with flour.  Was asked by several for the recipe.

Do not skip the salting of the eggplant step.  I also salt zucchini too.  It removes the bitter flavor that turn many off to the veggies.

I have made this recipe 4 times now and it is to die for. It is so full of flavour and makes an absolutely lovely dinner dish. Only thing is... it takes me THREE HOURS every time ! It is a lot of chopping and dicing and mincing and slicing but well worth it indeed :)

Delicious! My husband is a definite meat-eater but can't get enough of this casserole. The only change I made was to add the mozzerella to the vegetables before putting the buttered breadcrumbs and baking. The cheese melts into the casserole better this way.

Delicious!  I left out breadcrumbs because I didn't have any and added some yellow squash.  I used Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle instead of the spice mix b/c it's very similar.

I have made this twice in less than a week.  I made this for a Church picnic on Sunday it was gone in a flash!  Now I am making it again tonight for my family.  It was an easy and awesome way to use up garden produce and keep ahead of everything!  LOL...
