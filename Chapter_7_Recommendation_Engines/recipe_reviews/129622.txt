These were OK...not outstanding. They turned out pretty, but not fudgy enough for my taste. They seemed more cakey.

I just wanted regular cream cheese brownies, so I followed this recipe exactly except that I omitted the instant coffee and cinnamon. I pulled them out of the oven after 36 minutes without checking them but I think they got overdone. I wish I'd checked them at 30 minutes. They are dry and somewhat cakey. Also, the ratio of cream cheese mixture to chocolate mixture was such that the cream cheese bit is more of an icing. I would recommend doubling the cream cheese mixture.

You have to like the taste of cinnamon in your brownies.  Also, the cook who doesn't make a lot of brownies might not be clear that it's all purpose flour instead of self rising or that the choc mix must be slightly cooled before adding to anything with eggs.  It does need to chill overnight to have the best flavor also.

I make other recipes I like better.  This one's not bad but not my favorite either.

I can not believe the mediocre reviews on these! I have made them several times and are to die for! I always go a little heavy on the coffee and omit the cinnamon. Plenty of cream cheese do not double. As with all brownies if you want the fudginess, remove them from the oven a few minutes before you think they are done.

For more traditional brownies I just do the first step and leave out the cappuccino topping, step 2. Just the brownies without the topping are amazing!
