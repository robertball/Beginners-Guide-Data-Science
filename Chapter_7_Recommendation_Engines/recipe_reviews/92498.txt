This bread was great! Tasted like a gingerbread cookie. I omitted the raisins since I'm not a big fan of them & replaced the oil with more applesauce. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/2 cup Splenda. Very moist & delicious. Thanks so much.

Very easy to make. I would, however, substitute some of the whole wheat flour for regular one, otherwise it was to earthy for my taste. Also I'd go easy on alspice - 1/2 tsp with seemes like an overkill: it overpowered other spices and gave this otherwise nice bread an unpleasant bitter note. Also my loaf took more like 45-50 minutes to cook through.

Very good,moist. Would also decrease oil to 1/4 cup and increase applesauce by 3/4cup. Used chunky applesauce. I made muffins instead. Makes about 12 med-large sized muffins. Baked for 20min at 350.

this was awsome.  Use cinnamon applesauce and didn't have allspice so I did the cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  My kids ate this for breakfst the next day.  Very moist and not overpowering in any way.

This was excellent thank you so much for sharing!  I did substitute Olive oil and used Watkins Pumpkin Pie Spice 1 tablespoon instead of the other spices.  I will make this one all the time. Moist, not too sweet and excellent texture! I highly recommend this Loaf.  I might make it will fresh pumpkin instead of the applesauce just for an experiment :)

Very moist...does have a bit of an earthy taste to it though.  I don't mind that, because it is pretty healthy.  I would make it next time without the allspice altogether and maybe sub the raisins for walnuts or just add walnuts in addition to
