I thought this recipe was okay- it needed something else.  If you like your food to be simple and bland, this is the recipe for you.  My mother in law would love this cause she doesn't season her food.

Nothing really special about it, other than the potato chips on top, which made it a little more interesting.

It sounded really bland, but it turned out not bad. My husband and daughter loved it, especially the potato chips on top. It needs some salt and pepper after cooking though. I'll make it again.
