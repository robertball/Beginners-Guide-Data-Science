Not bad, but carbonara should have a much more intense bacon taste.  Also, where is the garlic??  Here are my changes.  Use 3/4 of the pasta.  When cooking the onions add 2-3 cloves (or to taste) of crushed garlic and use a good olive oil, not vegetable oil.  Use a good smoked bacon and you might want to increase it by 25-50%.  Add salt, pepper, parsley, and crushed red pepper to egg mixture before you add to bacon, onions and mushrooms.  Speaking of...I used sliced baby bella mushrooms.  Okay...I think that is it.  Good luck.

This was a good recipe.  I used half and half instead of whipping cream to save a little on the calorie side. I also found two pounds of bacon to be too much.  One thing to improve upon would be when adding the egg mixture to the pan.  My eggs cooked and made the sauce not very smooth.  It would probably be better to add the sauce to the pan and turn off the heat or turn to low to prevent the eggs from hardening and forming clumps The hot pasta should also cook the eggs when mixing.  This will be something to fine tune when I make it again.

Perhaps when scaling the recipe down it altered the overall flavor of the dish, but whatever it was, it started a fight with my hubby over what real Pasta alla Carbonara is. The taste wasn't horrible it just wasn't uber yummy and not what Hubby had expected at all in the flavor department. I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe. BTW, The instructions are incomplete and ought to be review. If it weren't for other reviews by users, I wouldn't have known when to add the parsley and red pepper.

This is not a traditional carbonara, but it is a delicious pasta dish. I followed the recipe exactly, but quartered the ingredients. Be warned when reducing the recipe - remove the pan from the heat before stirring in the egg/cream mixture. The eggs in the mixture will coddle quickly. I'm sure this wouldn't be the case if making the full recipe amount, but the smaller amount heats up quickly. I used whole wheat spaghetti as my pasta. I enjoyed this even more as leftovers the following day. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I thought this was wonderful and the whole family agreed.  Boyfriend had three helpings!  I followed the recommendations to add the parsley and red pepper to the egg mixture before adding it to the bacon.  This will definitely become one of our regulars!

We enoyed this very much. All the ingrdients can be easily altered but I think the heavy cream/egg/parm turned out to be a little bland. Perhaps a sharper cheese? or make this pasta dish like an alfredo style by simmering heavy cream/parm/garlic.

I followed the review of user PEGT2865 and made the following changes:
Used 1 1/2 lbs of pasta; added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the onions; used olive oil; used 2 pkgs of bacon (1 pkg regular, 1 pkg turkey bacon); increased amount of mushrooms and finally, I added a can of sweet peas. The recipe turned out great!

This was very good.  Also VERY rich.  Every once in a while it's good to have a nice fattening meal.  I left the mushrooms out and added fresh ground pepper instead of the red pepper.  I also halved the recipe.  It makes a ton even when it's halved.  Definitely a keeper, though.

Very rich creamy and good. I used less eggs and bacon, because I didn't want the sauce too thick from all those eggs and fatty from all the bacon. This came out good.

My two children and I made this with no problems, so it must not be too hard to make.  (I'm a male who very rarely cooks!!)

We cut down to only 1 onion (per half recipe) and it worked out great.

The next time, I'm going to add some fresh peas!!

Not quite authentic, but right now, I have a condition that requires me to thoroughly cook my food, and this version is the closest I can have for now. Not as creamy as the real thing, but it's close enough to be tasty and satisfying. Because you cook the eggs this way, this version can cook them very quickly. I did not use as much bacon either, and it tasted fine.

This dish was good but not great. In the future I think I'll add peas to the mix. It also needs salt.

Only thing I did different was cut the recipe in half and added more liquid so it wasn't dry.  Came out pretty good.

I tweaked it a little bit (like adding garlic and using sausages instead of bacon, cause that's what I had) but then, who doesn't right? :D It was pretty easy to make, but took a bit too long... In the end it turned out delicious, so thank you for the recipe ;)
