2 stars, partly because it doesn't exactly tell you how much zucchini to use, but also because the incredibly soggy texture of the outcome.  Is it 3 little store-bought zucchini or 3 big zucchini from the garden?  I made a half batch and grated one good-sized garden variety, that yielded 2.5 cups or so grated,  which I squeezed as much excess liquid out as I could.  Once baked golden brown in the top, sides and bottom, I topped with some shredded cheddar and baked a few minutes to melt the cheese.  They smelled wonderful, but when I cut in, they were completely soggy underneath.  I tried to bake a little longer but it didn't help.  Maybe they're supposed to be that way, like a corn pudding as opposed to corn bread, you know?  I ate the browned edges and the flavors are yummy, but the super-soggy texture did not work for us, sorry.

I liked the basis of this recipe.  It did need some additional "flavor". I added some fresh finely minced garlic, 2 cloves & red Pepper flakes. I used a cheese biscuit mix (MC). I lightly sauteed 1/2 an onion & drained in on a paper towel. Sometimes, often, onions w/release liquid in the baking process & make things soggy. Dry parmesan usually helps but I added an additional egg & some extra sharp cheddar(1/3 cup in the mix & about the same on top after the last 5 minutes). I did not put in the pepperoni in. We have some vegi people at our Nature Center. Eggs are ok, but the meat stuff isn't. It turned out a hit anyway at my Nature Center & my husband's work.

Baked Zucchini Squares Haiku: "Sweat the zucchini, to avoid the sogginess. Skipped pepperoni." Halved this recipe as a side dish for 4 salmon cakes (Chef John's recipe), and prepared it in an 8" square dish, and my zucchini was large-ish. I let the grated zucchini and chopped onion drain in a dish towel-lined colander for a few hours, squeezing out excess moisture b4 mixing it into the other ingredients. Other than that part of the preparation (and not using pepperoni), I stuck to the recipe. It was a nice, light side dish, and honestly, tasted better the following morning re-heated for breakfast. I think making it again, I'd add a shake of crushed red pepper and some mushrooms (that I would lightly-sautee w/ the onions b/c the one thing we didn't care for in this was the raw onions.)

I was hoping this would be a good use for some of the zucchini I have, but I found it to lack flavor.  The pepperoni just didn't have the punch to make this a recipe worth repeating.  It was not soggy, as some reviewers have said, but it definitely needed something more.

This is a great way to use up zucchini from the garden.  Unfortunately mine were huge and I didn't realize how tough the peel was.  I should have peeled it before using in the recipe.  Next time it will be better.

Used 3  med zucchini. Would cut back next time cause it was way too moist. Maybe use more baking mix? Also put cheddar on top and used more cheese than called for. Taste was okay just didn't care for texture. Also had to bake at 375 F as nothing was happening at 350 F

I prepared this recipe last year, and it was delicious.  This recipe does not give accurate amounts of zucchini and I failed to note how much zucchini I used. 
I an making this recipe again and still do not know how much to use, so I am going to grate and use 1 to 1-1/2 cups. Last time instead of the dried herbs, I used the ALL herbs in my garden.  I minced fresh parsley, basil, rosemary, thyme, sage and oregano and used a total of 4 tablespoons of the mixed minced herbs.

I would cook the veggies a little bit to soften , I found that works.  Other than that it was excellent.

This turned out to be a crowd pleaser.....I left out the mozzarella , as I didn't have any on hand, but increased the amt of fresh Parmesan.  Instead of pepperoni I used chopped fried bacon. Yummy!

I have made it just as the recipe is written and it was amazing.  Great side for really any meal.  Sometimes I cook it with an additional 1/2 cup or more of Italian  breadcrumbs for a little more breadlike addition to an Italian meal.

Substituted thinly sliced ham for pepperoni, used onion/garlic seasoning and kids cleaned the baking dish out!  Will be making again, soon!

I agree with some of the others, it was a little "soggy" but the flavors were good!  I also tried to get most of the water out of zucchini and I used only 2 eggs. I also only used 2 medium zucchini.  If there was a way to make it not so soggy, I would LOVE this because the flavors are great!

The spices are too overbearing, so much that you can hardly even taste the pepperoni.
