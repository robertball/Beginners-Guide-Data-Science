Omitted the marshmallows (not a fan).  Also made this in other combos (strawberry jello with strawberries and/or bananas, lime jello with pineapple, peach jello with peaches, whatever we are in the mood that day.   Serve it in a pretty crystal bowl and voila!  Also a fun recipe to make with my little granddaughter.  So easy!  What I really like it that it is light and a bit acidic to balance against the traditional turkey etc. on T-Day.

Loved it!   Simple, quick and easy to make.  Huge hit.  Light and fluffy.  Didn't change a thing.

I thought this was a secret family recipe! ;0) This is known as Michael's Favorite Salad in my family, after my oldest brother. We didn't put marshmallows in it, though. I like to use pineapple tidbits and my version is to add fruit cocktail along with the Mandarin oranges.

Old family favorite from the 50's. Always a hit & goes well with any kind of meat. I leave out the marshmallows just so it is not too sweet. Also use sugar free gelatin. Really doesn't change the flavor. Your family & guests will love it!

When a local restaurant dropped a dish like this I came to allrecipes.  This fit the bill for "Orange fluff."  My jello actually seemed a little stronger and sweeter than I wanted, so I added a bit more cottage cheese.  No marshmallows this time.  It was light, simple, and delicious.  Thank you.

I made this recipe (doubled) for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Perfect amount of fruit and marshmallows. Also, this recipe was not overpowered by the gelatin flavor as some other recipes have been. All the flavors blended wonderfully!!

We have made this for our Thanksgiving table for over 40 years now. It's always a hit.  I do add a cup of chopped pecans, and/or a handful of coconut. Our family is very big, so I usually double or triple the recipe.

This is very similar to what my mother called dump salad.  It's my go to dish for get togethers because it's simple and makes such a big batch
