This recipe is excellent. I have 2 picky eaters who aren't so keen on fish, but the gobbled this one up. Thanks.

My family loved it.  I used a deep fryer to keep splattering at bay.  Chips didn't turn out as crisp as expected, but the fish was gooood.  I'm not sure how I could get the beer flavour stronger on the final result, because I could smell it in the batter mix and when frying, but it wasn't detectable by taste.

I would do this again, when I overcome my fear for deep-frying.

This recipe is very basic, bland and not a lot of flavor.  Would be best to let the beer sit out in an opened bottle and let go flat before making this recipe.

This is a great recipe!!  The batter is nice and light, and also very crispy, which is a bonus.  I have tried many many recipes, and the batter always seems to be too thick, heavy and soft.
HOWEVER, the flavour does appear to be quite bland, so to get around this I add a Tbs or so of Curry powder!  Does wonders! :)

I actually just took the batter recipe and made fried okra with it.  I had to add lots of extra flour to get the batter to stick to the okra and get thick, but it worked out.  As far as taste, I found it pretty bland, but my fiance said that that's what fried food is supposed to taste like.  I will probably use this batter recipe again if I need to fry something!

My family found that the batter was very bland, not sure what it needed to "spice" it up a bit....

Great recipe. The batter puffs up nice and big. Worked really well with boneless catfish.

I cut the recipe in half, and still had over half left for 1 1/4 lb. fish. And it was tasteless
