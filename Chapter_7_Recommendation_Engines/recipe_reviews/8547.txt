This is wonderful!  The sauce is divine!  I would double the sauce so you have enough to drizzle on a side of pasta.  I pounded the chicken breasts so they weren't so thick, used half & half to cut down on the fat (just let it cook a little longer so it thickens), and used seasoned bread crumbs for better flavor.  Also added 2-3 garlic cloves to the sauce.  I would stick with fresh basil for best  flavor - it really does make a difference.  Scrumptious!

This was a very tasty recipe.  I altered the sauce recipe slightly because I wanted to season a whole box of pasta with it.  I used a whole 14oz can of chicken broth, 1 cup of Parmesan, 1/2 cup fresh basil, and I kept the cream the same at 1 cup.  When I made this, I let the sauce boil for 5 minute or so, constantly stirring it so that it wouldn't burn, to thicken it up a bit.  This made the perfect amount for an entire box of penne pasta without being too thick or too runny.  It was incredibly tasty, and I'll definitely be making this again!

Me and my husband absolutely LOVED this recipé.  We loved the cream sauce the best.  My husband kept on raving about it and said to make it again very soon. I served this over egg noodles.  I didn't have chicken on hand and used pork cutlets and it was just as delicious.  I also added garlic and scallions to the pan while cooking the pork (chicken) and also added a clove of crushed garlic to the cream sauce.  (I substituted light heavy cream instead of regular heavy cream which didn't seem to make any difference in taste at all).  EXCELLENT !!!!!!!!!  (it made me look like a chef in the making)    :)

You don’t know me, but you’ve gotta believe me -this is good.  I mean REAL good.   I modified it a tad, starting with using the standard breading method of flour, egg and (seasoned) bread crumbs.  I browned the chicken in a mixture of butter and olive oil to reduce the burning point temperature.  Once I browned it thoroughly I cut into it and noticed it was still a little pink on the inside – no problem, I just threw it in a 325 degree oven while I prepared the sauce and cooked some pasta.  While I only made two chicken breasts, I hated to waste the better portion of an 8 oz. carton of chicken broth and half a carton of cream, so I thought what the heck, I’ll use it all!  I added the chicken broth to the pan first, reduced it drastically, then added the entire carton of cream and let it go until the sauce had reduced to a thick and velvety smoothness.  I added the Parmesan and pimiento just before serving and topped the chicken with a basil chiffonade rather than stirring it into the sauce.  The chicken was tender and moist, the coating dry, golden and crispy (rather than mushy and soggy), complemented by the luxurious, rich sauce.  The pimiento was a nice touch, subtly enhancing the sauce.  I’m glad I had the extra sauce - it was perfect for some nice pasta!  Since this is a dinner a little on the rich side, I chose to serve it with just a few pattypan squash, lightly seasoned with butter, salt and pepper.  At the risk of sounding corny, this was a GLORIOUS dinner.

Excellent recipe.  I skipped the basil and pimiento, and added some red pepper.  Also used 2% milk instead of heavy cream and thickened it with butter and flour.  I will make this again.

Wonderful recipe! To save preparation time, I used a packaged "shake and bake" style coating mixture and baked the chicken, then served it with the cream sauce. I added a few mushrooms to the sauce and served pasta on the side. My husband and daughter loved the flavor. Next time I might add artichoke pieces as well. Thanks.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would! Everyone loved this dish! The "sauce" is what takes ordinary fried chicken to the next level.  Fine dining! I dipped the chicken in a beaten egg instead of milk and used 2 tsp of dried basil, which was perfect. I can't wait to make again!! Thank you Emily!!

This is a great dish. I pounded the chicken breasts thin so they would not need to fry for long. I cut some fat out of the sauce by using 2% milk instead of heavy cream. To compensate for the loss in thickness, I started the sauce by melting some margarine and then mixing in some flour before slowly stirring in the broth and milk. Still a very tasty sauce.

This recipe is seriously crazy good!  Couple of things I did differently:  1) Used flour, then egg, then seasoned panko crumbs with additional garlic, onion powder and Italian seasoning for my "breading".  PLEASE NOTE:  It is crucial to refrigerate your chicken for 30 minutes or so after you "dip" it so that the "breading" sticks properly while cooking.  HINT ~ you may want to prepare the chicken in a combination of olive oil and butter as it has a lower burning point than straight butter.  After cooking the chicken I put it in the oven at 250 to keep warm while preparing the sauce, which I doubled per other reviews and am so glad I did.  Served with penne pasta to help soak up the wonderful sauce and fresh steamed broccoli to counter the richness of the dish but oh so delicious.  Thank you for the submission Emily, I have added this to my recipe collection at my family's request, not that it was ever in doubt!  :)

This was excellent!  My husband said it was like going out to a nice italian resturant.  I served it with pasta and there was plenty of sauce to serve over both.  Wonderful! I wish I could give it 10 stars! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Love this recipe.  Make it at least once a month. I don't like pimentos so I found substituting sun dried tomatoes an excellent choice.

My whole family loved this and my brothers are extremely picky! I used roasted red peppers instead of pimento peppers and it was a hit. A note is that you need to serve it right away.

We really did not enjoy this meal. Usually if my hubs doesn't care too much for a dish he'll still finish what's on his plate, but this meal was an exception. I think if I made this again I would either use dry basil like I usually do or cut the required amount in half. This was my first time cooking with fresh basil. That's what really overpowered the meal in my opinion. Also I didn't have any pimento peppers on hand so maybe that would have balanced the meal, but all the same I don't think I'll be making this dish again.

This is a great recipe, but I really hate it when someone takes credit for a recipe that isn't their own.  This came from Taste of Home, submitted by Judy Baker Craig.  Please be original and not take credit for someone else's recipe.

Our family has been making this for years.  Ever since we first saw it in a Taste of Home magazine.  It is wonderful and comes together very quickly.  We always double the sauce and eat it on the chicken as well as over rice.

Tried this recipe last night for dinner.   It was absolutely sensational!!  My husband literally raved about it and woke up this morning saying what a good dinner we had last night.  I used the thin cut chicken breasts to save cooking time but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written.  Don't make the mistake of thinking that you need to season your chicken before cooking it because the cheese, butter and basil seasons it just right.  Will definitely be making this one on a regular basis.  Can't wait to try that sauce on fish!

Had the sauce with fish (Tilapia) the following night.  Just as awesome!!

This was the best meal. My family of 4 truly enjoyed this dish. I only omitted the pimentos because I do not like them.  I doubled  the sauce recipe and added fresh chopped garlic and red pepper flakes. I cooked chicken tenderloins in 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Instead of milk, I used an egg to keep the coating on the chicken.  I will make this again and again.  I can't wait to have a dinner party.  I am sure to impress my guest with this dish.

I would give this 10 stars if I could...absolutely the best! Better than I can find in a restaurant, I would drive 50 miles out of the way and wait in line for this dish and it came out of my kitchen and I haven't even tried this with fresh basil yet...can't wait! This recipe is pretty easy too. I think my diet just went to hell with this one. Absolutely give this a try.

I loved this....hubby said 4 stars (I say 4.5) I doubled the amount of sauce to have enough to spoon over egg noodles, but didn't double the amount of basil and it was really good.  Have never used fresh basil before and love it.  Tastes really fresh.  Thanks for the post...a definate keeper.  This recipe is almost identical to the Basil Cream Chicken....they are both good.  Thanks for the post.

I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was out of this world.  The sauce was somewhat runny but seemed to soak into the chicken.  Next time I will thicken the sauce with 2 T butter & flour, use half & half instead of heavy whipping cream, and pound the chicken breasts somewhat to cut some of the cooking time.  Maybe try 2 tsp of dry basil instead of the fresh (to keep cost down).  Will update when I make these changes.  This a definite keeper.

This was fabulous! It was a big hit with my family!  Even my kids loved it, so I will make it again. I doubled the receipe and I changed a couple of things. I used 1/2 ck broth and 1/2 wine wine. I used sun dried tomatoes instead of the pimentos. I can't wait to make this again! Next time I will saute mushrooms in white wine and add it to the mixture and/or artichoke hearts to change it up a bit. BUT you don't have to add these things to make it better because it was great just the way it was. I strongly recommend this.

I really liked this recipe, I didn't use the pimento peppers as we don't care for them, I did use panko bread crumbs and instead of frying, I baked the chicken.  It was still crunchy and so good!

I confess I used 2% instead of heavy cream. The freshest basil I can get here is in those little refrigerated packages in the grocery store, and I'm sure that had a great impact on the final result. I also always use bouillon instead of broth because 1 jar of those cubes has so many and I don't have a lot of space for extra cans. This turned out good, but I felt like it was more work than value, and I am not shy about putting in work in the kitchen, I love cooking! The pan-fried chicken was a nice treat for us because I hardly ever do that. But ultimately I felt like it just needed tons more sauce, and maybe something else in the sauce other than just pimentos and basil and parm. I will probably make this again with some more customization. It was very good with egg noodles and as leftovers, too, I just threw the chicken & sauce in a tupperware together, it didn't seem to act up when microwaving the next day.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe. The sauce is so good. I doubled it and served over noodles. I did leave out the pimentos too. The next day, I used the leftover noodles and sauce, added some cheese, a little more heavy cream, a can of tuna, and a little shredded zucchini I had and it made the best tuna casserole! Even my kids loved both meals! This will be my go to recipe. :)

Excellent!! I thought the sauce was a little soupy the first time I tried it, so I made a few adjustments - instead of 1/2 c. chicken stock, I dissolved 1 T. of chicken bouillon granules in 1/4 c. white wine. I also use fat free cream intead of heavy cream and it turned out just fine. I use an entire bunch of fresh basil, probably 1/2 c. or more when chopped. Yum!! In addition, I slice each chicken breast into 3 or 4 strips, it makes for more even cooking, and I used Italian bread crumbs. Thanks for sharing, it's definitely a keeper.

I used chicken tenders, seasoned with salt and pepper, dipped in milk and Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Followed the recipe but added 1 shallot and 1 garlic clove chopped to the pan after frying and removing the chicken. Made 1 1/2 times the sauce. Cut the chicken tenders into smaller pieces after frying. Used less fresh basil added fresh parsley to make recipe 1/2 cup, family not to keen on strong basil flavor. Served over farfalle pasta. Will make this again. Delicious!.

This was very, very good.  The reason for my 4 star rating was because I swapped fresh garlic for pimento peppers.  I think this was key and with the pimento peppers instead of the garlic this would have lacked a lot of flavor.

I made some other substitutions to make this more friendly to my waistline:
-used fat free half-n-half in place of heavy cream
-I pounded the chicken thin and coated a pan with 2 tsp of olive oil before broiling the chicken instead of frying it
-I cooked some whole-grain pasta and let it finish cooking (the last 2 mins) in the sauce and then ate that alongside the chicken.

I'll make this over and over again using these modifications.  The change to the half-n-half and butter saved 166 calories and 21 grams of fat per serving!

The sauce turned out more runny than expected which worked out fine given I used Egg Noodles that needed to be coated.  I'd recommend cutting the chicken into strips prior to breading them.  This will help make the chicken cook more evenly while helping with portion control.  I'd also add the basil after the sauce is finished reducing.  Next time, I'm going to add a bit of fresh nutmeg, replace the heavy cream with skim milk with corn starch, and add a sauteed shallot & garlic clove to the sauce for a more healthful & hopefully more tasty version.  But I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars, as I had to make one adaptation due to ingredient "shortage" that might have made it not as good as it could have been. I would have given mine 5 stars, too, but I was cheating! I don't like to mess with a posted recipe, as it seems a bit out of order, but I didn't have fresh basil, and did have some homemade pesto, which is what I substituted. Otherwise followed exactly, and the whole fussy family just loved it. It's now definitely on the "serve to company" list. Thanks for a good (and easy) recipe! BTW, I never like to sub anything for heavy cream--it never works out quite the same. It's only once in while ;) Just bought a bunch of fresh basil to try this again as written. It's a keeper!

My favorite by far!!  I changed nothing.  Came out like a fine dining Italian Dish.  I served over extra wide eggnoodles (doubled sauce for noodles) with salad and toasted garlic bread.  My kids and hubby loved it!  Thanks!

We really enjoyed this.  The sauce is excellent, and really makes the dish.  I added a bit of sherry to the sauce, as recommended by another reviewer.  Also used Italian style bread crumbs, as that's what I had on hand.  We have left over sauce, which will be great over some pasta.  Will make this again.  Thanks.

Pretty good - I added a clove of garlic to the sauce and probably could have cooked the sauce a little longer to thicken it up a bit more. Served it over egg noodles and asparagus. Yum!

I love this and so does my husband and he is very picky.  I have used half and half instead of heavy cream because I usually have half and half and it is just as delicious.  I didn't have any fresh basil last night and had to use dried and it was still good.

Excellent recipe.  I did season my chicken with garlic powder, salt, and onion powder.  Next time, I will leave out the salt. Made it toooo salty.  Doubled the sauce.  At first I thought it wasn't going to thicken up, but I continued to stir it on medium heat and it thickened just fine.  I put the chicken back in the pan with the sauce and then served it over egg noodles.  The family really enjoyed it!

This recipe did not do it for me.  I would suggest frying the chicken in a non stick pan, as the bread crumbs on my chicken ended up sticking to the pan and making a mess of the cream sauce.  The sauce was too thick and ended up looking like a glob on top of the chicken.  It did taste really good however, but it looked awful!

Delicious!! Whole family LOVED this! Used half & half (didn't have heavy cream on hand) and freshly grated romano cheese. Poured almost all the sauce (there was alot!) over the chicken, covered and let sit about 10 minutes while finishing up with the rest of the meal. The chicken was soooo moist it practically melted in your mouth! And the sauce was just incredible! Will definitely make again and again!

My husband is a PICKY eater and when he says, "YUM! This is really good. We need to have this again!" I WILL be making it again! It is a little on the fattening side with the cream so I might try a lighter substitute for the cream next time. This is a KEEPER!

This was delicious!  Hubby took one bite and said "I really like this meal!"  I only made 2 chicken breasts as it was just the two of us, but made the full amount of sauce.  I recommend making double sauce, like other reviewers said, so you have some for pasta. I used my basil out of my herb garden - the smell was divine!  I will be making this again for sure!

Very Good!  I did make a few small changes to this recipe.  I started by seasoning my chicken with salt and pepper, then coated with beaten egg rather than milk and then coated with panko to which I added just a little parmesan cheese.   Just before de-glazing the pan with chicken broth, I sautéed some fresh garlic just until fragrant.  I think the key to this recipe is fresh basil and a good quality parmesan cheese. We enjoyed this and I would definitely make it again.

Slight deviation of cooking instructions.  I fried the chicken but it needed a little cooking after cutting one open, so I baked it with the sauce on top.  Didn't change any ingredients.  This is great!  It is easy and it is delicious.  Family really enjoyed the chicken.  And yes, the sauce would be awesome for pasta.  Next time I will make more like everyone said.

This was a easy and delicious meal.  I pounded the chicken to tenderize it.  Deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup white wine. Used low fat half and half instead of heavy cream, omitted the pimento because of preference.  Added a couple cloves fresh minced garlic.  Used 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil which really does make a difference. These were the only modifications.  Poured it over penne past and served with a crusty bread. DELISH!! Thank you Emily for sharing.  Will make again and again.

A wonderful deviation from the standard chicken dish, though I did change a few things:

Instead of milk, I dipped the chicken in one egg (beaten) and breadcrumbs. Then, instead of frying in butter, I baked the chicken in the oven (350 at 40 mins) for a healthier version of the dish; just sprayed a dish with Pam and laid the chicken in. The baking made the chicken nice and crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside. 

I made about a batch-and-a-half of the sauce because I wanted to use up all the cream I had in the fridge. So, I added about an EXTRA 1/2 cup of cream; EXTRA 1/4 broth; EXTRA 1/4 parm cheese; and EXTRA 1/4 basil to what's written in the recipe. I omitted the pimentos due to preference and kept the pepper amount the same. I also added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. The sauce was delicious! The chicken broth gave it a mild but savory flavor, and it was surprisingly light for a cream sauce. The only complaint? I couldn't really taste any basil. I served the sauce over the chicken and some leftover plain pasta, and topped the dish with some diced plum tomatoes for color and added flavor.

Yummy meal, and super easy to make; you can create the sauce in the last five minutes the chicken is baking. The boyfriend mentioned several times while eating that this was a great dish, so this is definitely a keeper recipe.

Best sauce I have ever made from this site.  I didn't use pimentos only becuase the kids wouldn't like it. Sauce was a little thin, so I thickened with a little cornstarch.  The chicken was good, but the sauce made it fantastic!  Thank you.  I will use over and over.

Loved this! Like many others I added garlic which really added to the flavor. I also included mushrooms and a bit of cayenne pepper for a little kick. Came out great - my family loved it too!

Double the sauce and add 1 tsp garlic powder. I used 8-10 chicken tenders & Italian bread crumbs. Serve over pasta noodles.

A big hit!  I followed the directions except used Panko bread crumbs and didn't have the pimento peppers so used a couple of Tablespoons of chopped sun dried tomatoes in oil (rinsed).  Don't leave out the fresh basil, it adds so much to the flavors.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious! Made exactly as stated except for the pimientos as our store does not carry them. I used capers instead. Husband and I both gobbled it up. YUM! Next time might thicken the sauce a bit with flour/water paste…. Served with green beans and rice. Thank you!

Very good. Changed a few things since I'm watching my calories. First I baked it in the oven. Then instead of heavy cream I used plain greek yogurt and a tablespoon of cornstarch. Delicious!

Excellent! I used light cream and doubled the recipe for the sauce.  I poured it over steamed brussel sprouts and bowtie noodles.  Fabulous!! I will definitely make it again.

I baked the chicken and used 2% milk rather than heavy cream.  I think the heavy cream is key to making a nice creamy sauce.  The sauce was thin and the milk curdled in the pan making a sauce that didn't look the greatest, but tasted wonderful none the less!  I'll definitely make this again.

Didn't have pimento's so I skipped that...also was running low on parm cheese...but still came out great! Added some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick to replace the pimetos...delish!

This is SO good!!! Everyone in our family enjoyed this.  I omitted the pimentos because my kids would turn their noses up if they saw them..but the sauce is outstanding!! If you can buy light sodium chicken broth, I would.  The parmesan adds alot of salt flavor..not too much.. you just don't need to add any in any other way.

I had left-over basil from another meal so I searched for basil recipes and found this one. I actually used sun-dried tomatoes instead of pimentos since that's all I had. I also did not have whipping cream so used milk with cornstarch which I've done before. I used dried grated Parmesan cheese (the kind you usually find in shakers at pizza places or chain Italian restaurants) which is all I had on hand. I served it over plain jasmine rice. My husband liked the dish a lot. The dried Parmesan kind of left the sauce a bit gritty for me. I think that next time I'll use FRESH Parmesan and grate it myself. Overall it had a wonderfully fresh taste and it's still a keeper (especially since hubby liked it!!).

This was AWESOME! I doubled the sauce to use over linguini. I used roasted garlic-flavored chicken broth and fresh parmesan, and the combo of those flavors with the cream and the fresh basil was absolutely perfect. After I breaded the chicken, I let it rest in the fridge for 10 or 15 minutes, and the coating stuck like a charm. Also, I added the chicken back into the sauce before serving and let it simmer for a few minutes, just to make sure it was warmed all the way through. An excellent meal, thanks!

LOVED this recipe!  My husband asked me to work it into my "rotation" of meals.  I omitted the pimentos since I don't like them.  To lighten the calories, I used fat-free half-and-half and added a little flour to the sauce--it was still great!  I love fresh basil, so I used a bit more than the recipe called for.  I will definitely make this again.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I have used purple basil, sweet basil, and lemon basil.  I like it best with the purple basil, it looks very extravagant.  If you like the peppery taste of basil, then this dish is for you.

This is really amazing and tastes like you spent hours making it.  I pounded the chicken breasts to make them more tender and cut the pimento in half (my husband is not a fan of pimentos) - the results were fabulous.  Sauce very good over broccoli too!

This was ok, but nothing to write home about. It was especially not good enough to merit all the fat! I might make it again with some half and half and cook the chicken not in butter... And possibly add in some garlic somewhere. As is is good, but not great.

Incredible! I adapted this recipe to be low carb, so i breaded the chicken in almond flour instead of bread crumbs. Otherwise I followed it exactly. It was amazing. My husband raved about the flavor in this dish and he is difficult to please. It tastes like a dish you would only find in a high dollar Italian restaurant. I can't wait to make it for my friends & family.

I have made this dish twice. Very easy to make!! The basil cream sauce is amazing. I made alterations to the sauce. I tripled the sauce recipe. If you follow the recipe you will not have enough sauce to pour on everything else. It is a very thin sauce also, so I added some flour to the chicken broth, mixed it and poured it in to thicken the sauce.

NOTE: I USE CHICKEN BROTH DO NOT USE CHICKEN STOCK AS IT WILL NOT BE AS FLAVOURFUL.

I did fry the chicken but as an easy way I used garlic shake and bake for the breading then I fryed it in a pan on the stove. made for easy cooking 

All I'm all I will make this meal again and it was a huge hit the two times that I did make it!!

This is the 2nd time I've made this. Delicious! I did season the bread crumbs a little with salt, garlic powder, onion powder & dried basil. Definitely use fresh basil in the sauce.

This recipe was amazing! I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing for about an hour beforehand and then breaded and fried per the directions. I've found chicken really needs to be marinated in something to stay moist. The only changes that I made other than that we're to add mushrooms to three pan before the chicken broth and some cherry tomatoes halved with the cream and basil. The tomatoes really added to the dish I think. I don't usually change recipes before I try them as written, but I needed to use my tomatoes up because they are growing like crazy and I am having a hard time staying ahead of them! My husband said this chicken is so moist and delicious, and he is not a chicken fan.

Excellent way to use up some whipping cream in my fridge. It was so easy, but had a "fancy" appeal. My husband couldn't get enough, and he thanked me for making such a delicious dinner. I believe he thinks I really worked hard on this, but little does he know just how quick and easy this is!

This was terrific! The sauce is delicious . I used 2% milk since I did not have cream and thickened it a bit with a little cornstarch. The addition of Basil is essential as it adds so much flavor and with the red pimentos, increases culinary appeal. I think this is a 'company-worthy' recipe. I have added it to my collection. Thanks.

I loved this and will definitely make it again. I found the sauce slightly floury, so next time I'll adjust to make it thinner, probably by increasing the chicken broth. Overall delicious, though, and a great use for my home grown basil.

very good flavor. I subsituted roasted red peppers for the pimento (close enough/what I had on hand) and found the sauce to be a bit thin so I added 1.5Tb  flour to the sauce

Wow, this was wonderful and relatively easy and quick for a weeknight dinner!   Definitely take other advice of others and and double the sauce.  I did season the chicken, and I served with rice.

I abslutely loved the basil cream sauce but didn't care for the breading on the chicken. I'll try unbreaded, seasoned chicken breasts next time!

Didn't have Pimento or Cream so used a "little" Red Pepper Flakes (for color) and Plain Yogurt... probably healthier this way!  Flavorful sauce that's thin but not watery.  Fresh basil a must!  Cooked breasts with Panko crumbs in butter.  Used 3 very large breasts that required longer cooking time so the breading was on the dark side but made excellent "brown bits" for the sauce.  Tender and juicy and soooo good smothered with the sauce!!!  A keeper!

Absolutely delish!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and they took longer than 10 mins. to cook, and despite the fact that I lost a lot of the coating while they were sauteeing, they were still yummy with the scrumpshilicious sauce over them!

This was great!  I used 5 chicken breasts, as this is what came in the package I bought.  I pounded them a little thinner, which is key to making them tender.  I doubled the milk & bread crumbs since I had more chicken than called for (skim milk works fine, by the way).  I doubled the sauce (used half-and-half instead of whipping cream to cut down on the fat) as suggested by others, and was glad I did!  I left off the pimentos, just as a personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good...I used italian seasoning since I didn't have fresh basil.  next time I woud use chicken tenders just to cut down on cooking time and i'll try it with fresh basil. I served it with brown rice but nexttime will try it with pasta with olive oil. It's a heavy dish so it's not one i'll be making all the time but it is definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  Unfortunately I did not have pimentos so I used sun dried tomatoes instead.  (Tomatoes and basil go together very well.)  It did not deter from this beautifully flavoured dish one bit.  I always double the recipe so we have seconds for lunch the next day.  Thank you!

This is honestly one of the best new recipes I've tried in ages.  To put it in perspective, I tried it for the first time 2 months ago, and we have had it EVERY week since - instant family favorite.

I only made a couple of small tweaks.  I low carb, so I just skip the breading all together, and it still turns out great.  Also, I use thighs rather than breasts, since that's what I always have on hand.  And then I skip the pimentos (just not a fan) and use an entire container of fresh basil, which is closer to 1/2 cup.  I know if I tried to save the extras, it'd just go to waste, so I throw it all in.  I still don't find the basil to be overpowering.

Finally, I want to add that I usually make spaghetti for my kids when I make this, b/c my youngest is going through a picky phase.  But my oldest really likes this, and she's discovered that stirring a bit of this sauce into her spaghetti makes for an amazing tomato cream sauce!  I tried a bite, and it truly was divine.  It's another way to use this very versatile sauce.

I'm learning how to cook, so this was ambitious for me! I made this for my husband--I made a little extra sauce and served it with pasta. The sauce tasted great on the pasta! One tip--pounding the chicken a bit to make it more even would help. It doesn't need to be scallopini-thin or anything, but the breading would have cooked more evenly if the chicken weren't thick on one side and thinner on the other.

The sauce on this was great.  I didn't have any pimentos and probably wouldn't use them anyway since I don't like them.  Also, my bread crumbs were rancid, didn't even know that could happen, so I used crushed corn flakes and that was pretty good.  Next time I might try to thicken the sauce since it was quite runny.

Made this last nite and it was a huge HIT! WE all loved it. I made just a couple of changes. I used Panko breading vs. bread crumbs & dried basil vs. fresh, but it was perfect! Will definitely make again - very soon :) Thanks for sharing!

awesome!!! everyone in my PICKY family loved this recipe. The only change I made was to double the sauce recipe. I wanted to be able to saturate my chicken in it. I had leftover and have been using it on some leftover pasta. It warms up really well and taste great on everything! I will make this again.

This was a nice twist on chicken primavera.  I didn't have the pimentos and didn't use breading (we need gluten-free and didn't have any GF bread crumbs).  It turned out wonderfully.

Oh the under rated pimiento.  That is what caught my eye about this recipe.  Delicious!  Made it for my Italian side of the family and they raved for something different.  The only modifications I made were, I used a dry 4 cheese blend instead of just parm because that's all I had and I added a little garlic to that sauce because we are garlic lovers.  I took other peoples advice and doubled the sauce and served it over a mini farfalle pasta.  No leftovers and I will be making this again for sure.

This was delicious. I was skeptical at first and wasn't too sure how it would turn out, but I served it to myself and two others and we all loved it.  It's actually pretty easy to make and I enjoyed the interaction of basil, cheese, pimento and cream over tender chicken.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Very impresive way to serve the humble chicken. I was short on time, so I used high-quality frozen breaded breast tenders that weren't cooked. A sprinkle of salt and garlic powder and into the oven they went for 25 minutes while I prepare the sauce. I thinly sliced a 1/2 white onion and cut the slices in half; the onions were sauteed until almost browned in 1 tablespoon of walnut oil in a nonstick pan. I then proceeded with adding the liquid as follows: 1/4 cup of white wine, 1/4 cup of chicken broth followed by the cream and pimentos. 2 cups of frozen artichoke hearts were added with the pimento peppers to the sauce. The fresh basil was picked fresh from my garden and made this dish even more special for me. Thank you Emily for such a classy recipe.

I have been making this chicken dish for years and it is my 10 yr old son's all time favorite meal!  The rest of my family really enjoys it too!  It is absolutely delicious!  A couple small additions....I sometimes add a little flour or corn starch to the sauce to thicken it some and I serve it over pasta.

This was fast, easy, and delicious! My husband is a very picky eater, but he loved it. The only thing I added was minced garlic to the sauce, otherwise I followed it as is. Will make again.

This is one of those times I wish we had half star ratings.  The idea of rolling the chicken breasts in bred crumbs, instead of flour, had not occurred to me.  The chicken ended up juicy and crunchy, I won't be using flour again!  However, the sauce it self was incredibly bland.  I added a ton of the herbs as well as garlic but that didn't add much punch to it.  Sauce was nice and smooth though.

This was really good and didn't require a lot of attention. instead of pan frying the chicken in butter, I did it in extra virgin olive oil and it came out beautifully.

This dish was pretty easy to make and very good! I used Parmesan shake and bake for the bread crumbs just because I had it. I also could not find pimento peppers so I used a red bell pepper. We eat a lot of chicken so I am always looking for different way to make it...I will make this again!

This was delicious. I used turkey tenderloin in place of the chicken, used seasoned bread crumbs, omitted the peppers, and doubled the sauce to pour over noodles as well. I also added a splash of white cooking wine to the chicken broth. I browned the turkey in the butter for about 5 minutes and baked for about 40 minutes at 350. It was good but slightly soggy. Next time, I will brown in 3 tablespoons olive oil and then bake. I also added fresh chopped garden cherry tomatoes and chopped scallion on top of the turkey after it was done cooking. Very yummy! I think this recipe would be quite good as it is written as well.

I made this last night for my family, and they LOVED it! I used regular whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream and though it wasn't very thick, it tasted delicious. My picky 5 year old even asked for seconds! Will definitely be a regular dinner in my house.

LOVE IT! I didn't add the peppers because I didn't have any, but it was still so yummy! I've made it twice now, the first time with the scratch chicken, and the second time, I just bought crispy chicken breasts and cooked it. Delicious either way! The fresh basil makes all the difference in the world. I never want to use dried basil again!

Very good- easy enough to prepare.  Cooking for only two, we used only one big breast, sliced it into medallions and served the sauce over Linguini noodles.  Served over the pasta, this was a pretty heavy meal but we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Next time, I will not dip the chicken in milk,(don’t like the milky taste) and will use lemon peel/ juice in both the coating and the sauce.  My parmesan cheese was very clumpy in spite of cooking for 20 minutes and I don’t know why.  Sauce was not too thick as other reviewers commented.  Very good recipe..

I LOVE this chicken!  I have made it several times but found that Italian bread crumbs are better, I pound the chicken breasts to 1/2 inch and I always double the sauce.  It is so good.  I serve it on angel hair nests.

I was very excited to find a recipe that featured pimentos and I liked the sauce.  It looked very elegant.  Would probably add some sour cream or flour to thicken it a little bit next time.  Next time, I think I will just bake the chicken and cut out the calories that come from the breading and frying.  Also suggest seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper.  I also thought that, as written, it made plenty of sauce.

This was very good!  I left out the pimentos, don't like them, added some grated parmesan to the bread crumbs and upped the parmesan to 3/4 cup for the sauce.  Delicious!

Sauce was a little thin, but the flavor was great!  I used sourdough bread to make the crumbs & cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  I made extra sauce (for 6 servings) and served over noodles.  Yummy!

My family loved this! The chicken breasts stayed very moist and I kept them warm in the oven at 300 degrees while i made the sauce.  I doubled the sauce and served it over macaroni.  I wasn't sure how the pimientos would taste but they added a delicious flavor.  We will make this again for sure.

Fabulous recipe.  I only made very slight modifications.  I cut the chicken breasts into thirds and then breaded and cooked them in butter. I used slightly more cream than recommended.  But if you thicken the sauce enough it comes out wonderfully.  I served it over penne pasta.  Yum!

Good Start, but next time I would use less butter and thicken the sauce

I just finished eating this.  Today was my mom's birthday and I wanted to make something special for her.  It turned out perfect.  The chicken alone was awesome, came out really tender.  I cooked the cream in the same pan I used for the chicken, giving it a dark look.  In addition, I also made instant angel hair noodles and green beans mixed with sauteed onions, stewed tomatoes and mushrooms.  It was delicious.  I give five stars for this recipe.  BTW, this was my first attempt cooking something like this.

We all loved this. We made it the first time like the recipe says over chicken and The sauce was so fantastic my husband started suggesting other things it could go over. So I made the suace again a week later and we put it over Salmon. It was fantastic and so easy.    I did do things a little different the second time to thicken it a bit.   I put the butter in the bottom of the sauce pan and sauted the peppers (I used red and yellow roasted peppers in a jar instead of pimentos-thats what I had)I added ground sea salt and ground pepper then I added the chicken broth and the fresh basil- I think I used a 1/2 a cup of fresh basil- twice what it call for-chopped small but not super small. I let it cook (boil) for a couple of minutes added the cream and put it on simmer. Then added the Parmesan cheese- let it simmer uncovered for a while to get creamer and thicker. Spooned it over the Salmon. Yumm!

Greg recipe - few ingredients, easy but great taste.  I cut the chicken up in bite size pieces and dipped them in the milk and bread crumbs.  Meanwhile I cooked an entire box of Barilla bow tie pasta (Farfalle).  I tripled the sauce recipe except for the basil and made a chicken/pasta dish that would feed a big crowd.  My kids really liked it and so did my husband and I.  I also used Italian bread crums because that is all I had.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Excellent!! This was better than you get at a fine restaurant!! I did make slight changes as per other reviewers suggestions, after the chicken was done and removed from the pan I added a bit of evoo and then sauted 3 cloves of chopped garlic, used white wine instead of chicken broth and used roasted peppers instead of pimentos. Also, grated my own parmesan. Using fresh basil definately makes a difference! This was a big hit...everyone loved it...even the picky ones! Thanks for such a great recipe!

One word......heavenly!  The only change I made was omitting the pimentos and that's because I don't care for them.  I served it with a side of roasted new potatoes and french green beans. Definetly a keeper.

This recipe is excellent! I didn't have fresh basil though so I used dried sweet basil instead but next time I will buy fresh. The only thing I would have changed would be to season the bread crumbs.

Excellent dish!  I wish I had actually measured the liquid ingredients since it came out very runny.  Or maybe it's because I didn't give it a chance to thicken.  Doesn't matter, this was wonderful!  Will make again and again.  The fresh basil is the key!  Next time I will use a better quality of cheese too.  Highly recommend!

I'm also giving this recipe five stars. I made it pretty much as directed, except I used Italian bread crumbs and did put the chicken in the oven for about 30 minutes after the initial time cooking in the butter. I didn't feel it was quite done, and the outside was pretty well browned after about 10 minutes in the skillet. I just transferred the chicken to an oven safe pan, and then made the sauce. The sauce thickened up very well for me, especially after adding the cheese. This sauce would make an excellent gravy for mashed potatoes.

WOW!!! This recipe just please the pickiest eaters, my family!
I added the garlic and since I did not have pimentos in hand I used pimento powder 2 tablespoons.  The sauce was so good over rice , when the rice was gone my husband grabbed bread a wiped the plate clean.  I will make this at least once a week.

Wonderful flavor.  I used half and half inplace of the cream and next time may cut it with half milk, it was really rich.  I used 1 tsp of dried basil.  For the chicken I cubed tenderloin strips instead of dipping them in crumbs I sprinkled the crumbs over them while cooking.  I used shake and bake crumbs (homemade recipe from this site that we love) so they were already seasoned perfectly.  Also added garlic with the chicken and next time I'll add mushrooms too.  Best served with good soft bread for dipping!

I rate this 5 stars because my 6 and 8 year old sons begged me (repeatedly) to make this again after the first bite. It is easy enough to prepare with kids and I served mine exactly as the recipe describes except I doubled the cream sauce. I served it in a deep dish pan over bowtie pasta. I layered the chicken (8 pieces) over the top of the pasta and then drizzled the sauce on top. It served my whole family with enough left over for tomorrow at lunch. I definitely recommend this. I added a few spices to the bread crumb mixture but that was the only substitution I made. It was wonderful and I will definitely make it again!!

Excellent!  I butterflied the chicken so that it wouldn't take long to cook.  I followed the recipe (except the pimentos).  Very easy.  Very good.  Next time, I'll butterfly and pound to flatten to see if we like it better that way.  It's definitely something to at least try.    8/4/09:  We had this again.  Instead of pouring the sauce over the chicken, I put the chicken back into the skillet with the sauce - to reheat the chicken a tad if needed.  Wonderful!  My daughter had two pieces and she is not a chicken fan.  This is great with mushrooms on the side!

This was VERY GOOD! My husband and I both loved it.  The only changes I made were to add some fresh garlic to the sauce, dipped the chicken in an egg instead of milk, added 1 tsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little, and made some noodles to serve it over. It was delicious! I also think that using fresh basil is a must. I grow my own basil (very easy to do!) so I just went and picked some off my plant. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is wihout a doubt one of my most favorite chicken main dishes.  For a speedy prep use chicken cutlets instead of the chicken breasts.  When using breasts I often bake them after browning (for about 45 minutes)to make sure they are cooked through.  Pimentos add a touch of color but are not crucial to this recipe.

The sauce was delicious, and I recommend that the cook saute some garlic in the butter prior to mixing the sauce.  With regard to the chicken, I mixed egg and milk together.  Seasoned salt adds a nice element of flavor to the chicken.

This recipe is excellent and impressive.  It looks really appetizing too.  It would be good for guests.  I did make a few changes:  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, I added a bit of salt and seasonings to the breadcrumbs.  I fried the chicken for about 7-10 minutes but found that it wasn't quite cooked yet so I then baked it at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes.  As soon as I was done making the sauce in the frying pan I poured this over the chicken that was already in the oven and continued to bake.  The fresh basil and pimiento really make this dish.  I served with egg noodles covered in the sauce and asparagus.  Gourmet!

5 stars for this recipe with a few modifications: I use eggwash instead of milk before the breading, and mix some grated parmesan in w/ the breading. Also, after the chicken is done, I melt butter in the same pan, saute a few cloves of garlic, then add flour to make a roux. Then whisk in the milk/cream (doesn't seem to matter much which you use) and I add some chicken stock as well. Also, the jarred roasted red peppers work fine in place of pimentos. I know I should rate the original recipe, but I have never followed it. Use these as ideas and then make them your own!

SO GOOD. I did make a few changes though, because I didn't want to go to the store. So, I used roasted red bell intead of the pimento and used whole milk and extra butter intead of the cream, also used a little cornstarch to tighten it. I served over multi colored farfalle and lemon brocolli on the side. Really and excellent dish.

YUMMY!  I made a couple of changes because we are snowed in...so I had to use what I had.  I used already breaded chicken breasts that I had in the freezer and fried them in the butter per-recipe.  I only had fat free half and half and dried basil...but it was terrific.  I will probably never use the heavy cream because of the fat...thanks for the recipe!!  will make again!

I thought this was just Ok.  Unfortunately I followed the advice of other reviewers, and used seasoned bread crumbs.  I thought the taste of the basil in the sauce was so delicate, that the seasoned bread crumbs way overpowered it.  The sauce itself was just Ok...not nearly as fabulous as I thought it was going to be.  I probably will not make this again.  UPDATE:  My mistake on the basil, I measured wrong (supposed to be tightly packed...) so I've decided to give this another try!  I'll keep everyone posted... :)

It may be my own personal taste, but i did not like the pimentos in it- it tasted too "jarred" in a recipe I expected to taste very fresh.  I wanted to like this recipe so much, but just was not impressed at all by the flavour. (I love basil!)

Definitely a keeper! I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, fat free half & half (instead of heavy cream) and a mixture of Parmesan, romano and asiago cheeses (instead of just parmesan). My husband loved it.

It was fine.  The recipe made loads of sauce.  If we were pasta eaters this would have been fine.  But next time I'll halve the sauce portion.

This was an "EXCELLENT" recipe.  I do have a couple of suggestions, but it is based on family preferences.  WE LOVE Mushrooms.  So I added fresh mushrooms, sliced thick, about 3 cups.  I also tripled the sauce recipe and served it with mini rigatoni pasta with a little sauce stirred into it. My family loved it and all copied the recipe.....THANKS Emily.

I was looking for a new chicken dish, and thought I'd try this one because of the many 5* ratings.
This dish had a good flavor, however, my company thought it was too heavy a dish-way too much fat/calories. The frying in butter, along with the whipping cream and cheese was a little too much. My friends and family are trying to watch their fat and cholesterol-this is not a dish for health-conscious company!

This is an awesome recipe. Be sure to use real parmesano reggiano, but you can cut the cream in half, if desired.

We LOVED this recipe, thanks so much for sharing.  I substituted the fat free half and half that I can now find at the grocery instead of whipping cream.  I thought that might "lighten" it up and it didn't effect the taste at all.  Cooked fresh pasta to seve it with, was yummy.

This was excellent however next time I make it I am going to lighten it up a bit. I think it can be made considerably more healthy without out taking to much flavor away.

This was excellent.  The only change I made was using jarred roasted red peppers instead of pimentos. That was what I had, and it made no difference.  We cleaned up every scrap.  I served it with pappardelle pasta and steamed broccoli.  Really really good!

Yummmmmmmm!!!!  This was excellent!!!  Followed a few other's suggestions- used egg instead of milk, added fresh garlic to the butter to cook the chicken, made my own marianade of spices for the breadcrumb mix, doubled the cream sauce recipe (I would add slightly less chicken broth next time to thicken the cream sauce), and served over egg noodles with fresh corn on the cob.  My super picky GF even liked it!!!

Yummy, but looks awful.  I followed the recipe except for using one reviewer's suggestion to use white wine.  She said she subbed wine for stock, so I used 1/:3 cup wine and 2/3 cup stock to make double the sauce.  Of course it curdled.  Threw it out and started over in a clean pan, omitted the wine - and it still curdled.  The taste was wonderful, but would be embarrassing to serve to guests.  For my husband and me, it was good but not spectacular.  Husband raved and I would have too, if I could get past the curdled look.  I did use half & half, so will give it another chance by using cream.

I made as someone suggested with a whole can of chicken broth and kept the creme at one cup.   It made plenty of sauce and was good but really thick,rich and salty.
Will make again with half in half and low sodium chicken broth

I loved it!  I forgot my list when I shopped, so I forgot the pimentos.  I found some Spanish olives in the fridge and cut the pimentos out of them, but there weren't enough.  I was worried that my sauce would be too bland, so I chopped up 3 garlic cloves and 1/2 of a beautiful farm-fresh tomato (without the seeds).  We always keep Italian bread crumbs and shredded cheese (parmesan, asiago, and romano) in the kitchen, so that is what I used.  My basil was fresh off the farm a couple of days ago.  I pounded my chicken breasts thin and cut them each into 4 pieces.  

Hubby walked into the kitchen and said it looked like I was cooking a gourmet meal.  His stamp of approval when he tasted it was that he DIDN'T tell me all the things I should have done to make it better.

I WILL make this again!

Excellent, probably used more butter, but wonderful taste. Served with wild rice. Like the white wine idea, will try that next time.

Pretty tasty! I made this last night for my husband and myself. It is something I would make again, but I would use a bit less basil. I only had the dehydrated stuff, but I used the equivalent of 1/4 c. fresh basil, and will use less next time. Also, my chicken was still a bit pink after 10 mins in the skillet, which made me nervous, so I stuck it in the oven for about 10 minutes at 425 and it cooked fine. I made the sauce in a pot since I had the chicken in the oven. It still turned out delicious.

Wasn't overly impressed with this one. I blackened the chicken a little, but the sauce didn't have a whole lot of flavor in it. It was good, but not great...

This was awesome! Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so tasty. You'll love it if you like roasted red pepper sauce, because pimentos taste very much like them. This dish will be in regular rotation at our house.

This was five stars easily.  I had to replace pimento peppers with red peppers and it was still one of the top recipes I've encountered on here.  Ate a huge piece of chicken this came out so good.

I made this tonight exactly to the recipe. It was delicious. The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is that it needed more seasoning. I will make it again with sauteed garlic and shallots added. I think that may be all it needs. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sauce so I could pour it over the egg noodles I served it with. Along with a mixed green salad and some garlic bread, this was wonderful!

I've done this a few times now.  Very, very good.  

I was out of sweet basil, so I substituted a mixture of Thai basil and cinnamon basil.  Thai basil you can probably get fresh in your grocery, but if you want cinnamon basil, you'll need to grow it yourself.  It's definitely worth the effort for this recipe alone.

Mostly stayed true to the recipe other than seasoning the bread crumbs. The basil-cream sauce elevates the pan fried chicken to an impressive dish. So many different ways to customize the sauce but liked the idea from others of subbing wine or sherry for the chicken broth. I’ll play with the sauce next go-round.

This was very good, fairly quick to make, but watch your cooking times on the chicken.  I used thicker breasts which took longer.  I made no changes to the recipe.  The sauce was fantastic.  If I can give you one piece of advice or change to make, it's to double the sauce.  You'll thank me later.

LOVED this recipe..although I made some changes to fit my dietary needs. I used almond milk instead of regular milk and gluten free bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. I did season the milk and bread crumbs. I did add shallots, fresh minced garlic, and red pepper flakes to the pan after the chicken was removed, and then added the liquid. Instead of using pimentos I used roasted red pepper & artichoke tapenade, which I highly recommend. Instead of heavy cream, I used organic soy cream. I then added some freshly grated pecorino cheese and LOTS of fresh basil and a little fresh parsley. This recipe is AMAZING!!!

This is an excellent main dish.  I made it according to the recipe.  My boyfriend enjoyed and went for seconds.  My only issue is that normal chicken breast don't cook in 10 minutes.  The 'cutlet' style chicken breast can cook in 10 minutes.  If you're making the typical 1.5 to 2 inch thick chicken breast - cook for 20 minutes!  

Otherwise, very tasty and happy to add this to my rotation.

I was looking for a way to use some of the Basil I have in my garden and came across this little gem. It was so easy, I really didn't have high expectations, but it is fantastic. I followed the directions, except I used a jar of roasted red peppers. As always when I am breading chicken, I flattened it slightly with my meat mallet, browned it on both sides, but threw it in the oven for 10 minutes to finish cooking (I think this makes for a more tender chicken, and I can finish the sauce on the stove while the chicken cooks in the oven). I served over Angel Hair Pasta, but next time will double the sauce if I am serving over pasta.

We LOVE basil so this was wonderful! I made just the sauce for leftover chicken. Cubed the leftover chicken into it and served over rice. It was a hit with the fam so I know I'll be making this often. Thanks Emily for sharing it!

We LOVED this recipe! Even my 12 year old who hates everything!  I didn't have any pimento, so I used a red pepper. I also added sliced mushrooms and onion and garlic for extra flavor. I have tried with with 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy whipping cream and it worked well, just have to simmer a little longer to get it thick. I also double the sauce and put it over egg noodles or fettuccine. This recipe has been put into our regular rotation.

Delicious!!  Made this last night and my husband told me no less than 4 times how much he enjoyed dinner.  The cream sauce is absolutely wonderful.  I didn't have pimento on hand so I substituted roasted red peppers and cut them up small.  The fresh basil adds such a fresh taste to the dish.  I made double the sauce so that we could put it on the side of couscous as well and it was terrific.  Will make this again and again!

I made this tonight for a stay in Valentine's dinner and it was great. I did make a few substitutions. I find that a lot if recipes on this site don't season the chicken beforehand and then the chicken is bland. I seasoned liberally with adobo and left for an hour and then cooked. I followed the recipe almost to the letter; I just added used seasoned bread crumbs for more flavor, more chicken broth than called for and i added two minced garlic cloves to the sauce. It was so good. Better than a restaurant with my changes. I strongly suggest seasoning the meat beforehand though. That's the only thing I dint like about American food: not enough seasoning!

This is one of my favourite recipes. I've made it several times. At first I thought it it might be a little bit too liquidy - because every time I've made it, it has turned out somewhat liquidy. However, this didn't pose a problem at all. Not only is this sauce good on chicken, but if you cut up chicken and put it in the sauce, it's fantastic on all of your favourite pastas. Would definitely recommend - this recipe is always a homerun.

As others did, I doubled the sauce, and made it lighter by using less cream, making a roux, and sauteeing the pounded breasts after dipping them in a bit of flour. Fresh Basil is the key IMHO!

Awesome.  I followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  I thought there was plenty of sauce without doubling the recipe.  
I did keep the oven warmed to 200 degrees and put the cooked chicken in there to keep it warm while I fried the rest and made the sauce.... Yum.  My kids even liked the chicken....though they refused to try the sauce.

I cook it at least every other week and it is a tradition in my family now.  I add sun-dried tomatoes instead of pimentos, not everyone likes pimentos or can't eat it.  It gives it a better italian taste.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used crushed crackers.  I makes it have a cruncher taste.

Yumm! Just mouth watering. I didn't have any pimento, still delicious. I served with roast potatoes, but pasta would be just as good.

This recipe was good, but not great. I used panko breadcrumbs and fresh cut basil from my garden. The sauce came out thinner than I thought it would and the result was somewhat bland. The flavor was good, but needed something to spice it up. We sprinkled it with salt and extra pepper after serving and that helped a lot.

This is an excellent recipe. I flour the chicken and add a beaten egg to the milk. This help the breading adhere to the chicken better. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. It turned out outstanding.

This was really good.  It requires A LOT of basil!  I had never cooked with fresh basil before, and I guess I didn't really store mine properly, so some of the basil leaves could not be used.  So, I used about 1/2 the amount of fresh basil that the recipe calls for and used dried basil for the rest.  I guess next time I'll buy my fresh basil the day I use it, or the day before I use it.  

I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, just to cut down on the fat and calories a little.  

Some people have commented on the pimentos.  I personally don't like pimentos by themselves, but I thought they added something to this dish...a little different flavor, color, and texture.  The taste of them is not very strong in this dish.  My boyfriend and I couldn't taste them.   

I served this with spaghetti, as some reviewers have suggested.  That was a great idea, and added a lot to the meal.

All I can say is that my husband adores this recipe and he's a picky eater. I had my doubts that the chicken would keep its coating since im not a great cook but it never fails to stay crisp and in tact! It always turns out great! We love it!

This is the best recipe I've gotten so far from AR! It's melt in your mouth good.. I usually double the amounts for the sauce and use it on tortellini as well as a side. Also I add a bit of italian cooking creme for texture and green onions for taste! It's definitely a regular in our house now... and usually by request! =)

My husband and I loved this. Like other reviewers, I doubled the recipe for the sauce. I did not have pimentos, but it tasted great without them. I only used about 1/8 cup of basil in the sauce. I needed more bread crumbs than what the recipe called for, more like 1 cup. I also added flour to the sauce to thicken it up.

This was an excellent, fast dish!  I did not have fresh basil so used 1 TBsp dried and it was just the right amount.  There are only 3 in our family so I just used 3 breasts but made all the sauce.  It is delicious on rice so if you are using more than 3 breasts, I would double the sauce.  Definitely a keeper!!

I mostly made as is...I didn't have fresh basis, only the dried stuff, and only about 1/2 tsp, and I forgot to add the parmasan to the sauce so i sprinkled it over. Served over elbow macaroni (because I had a ton of it) and it was very yummy!

Thank you EMILY DAGGETT !!!

Made according to the instructions, no exceptions.

DELICIOUS!  I will make this many times to come.

I did use my own fresh black-basil which I had frozen a few months ago.

Just made this earlier and it was an instant hit with my family!  The only thing that I did differently was I dipped the chicken in egg instead of milk and I omitted the pimentos simply because I didn't have any....still delicious!  My family can't wait until I make it again!!

Milk seemed unnecessary since I made with tilapia & the loins were moist from unthawing. Served with Company Couscous. Delicious & rich. David & I felt very French. Ha!

Totally Delicious! I replaced the pimentos with Anaheim peppers and it was great. Also I really do not suggest using this with chicken strips or small pieces. Definitely for whole Chicken breasts.

This meal was awesome. I pounded the chicken breasts to make them thinner, and doubled the sauce except the pimento and served with pasta. Everyone loved it! Easily could feed 6 people, we had quite a bit of leftover. If you are a wine drinker it went great with champagne. Good enough to serve company!!!

Everything a good recipe should be.  Easy, Quick, Delicious.  I will make it again and again.  If you love basil, you will really like this recipe. Pound the chicken so it cooks evenly. I used panko for the coating.  THe pimentos add great flavor to recipe as well.

This was a delicious and simple recipe. I left out the pimento since we're not big fans of that flavor. In hindsight I wish I had heeded the reviewers who recommended doubling the sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a yummy recipe.  I doubled the chicken stock, but not the cream (I used 1/2 and 1/2) and boiled and stirred for 5 min to have enough sauce.  I also added an egg to the milk before dipping in the crumbs.  I was afraid the parmesan flavor would be too strong for my husband, who is not a lover of parmesan, but he just loved the recipe...whew!  I'd recommend this delicious recipe.  My only problem was one of time management!  Getting it all put together at the end at the same time was a bit tricky...that's all on me, though.  Next time I'd get the pasta and vegetable ready and then do the chicken!

This dish was amazing... I made a couple small changes - I fried the chicken in the skillet but then finished it in the oven because I was making a huge batch. I also left out the peppers because I'm not a fan... instead I fried several slices of prosciutto until it was crisp and then crumbled it into the sauce just before serving. Everyone LOVED it... just might be my new 'go to' chicken dinner...

10/30//11 I'm preparing this dish for the Bishop of the archdiocese at a special luncheon. Not a big big tadoo , but I chose this dish as an entree because I liked the addition of the basil cream sauce,and the easy breading procedure. I'll let you know how he liked it,(assuming I prepared it well).

Enjoyed this so much.  Had to make a few changes, dried vs. fresh basil - 1/2 jar pimento's, so added a little garlic, but other than that, this recipe is great!  Will make it again when I have all the right ingredients!  Thanks for a new favorite!

This recipe really interested me, and it was well worth it-I did make double the cream--awesome!!I also like the reviews that used pork also, so now can make it with more than just one meat--and I might say when I opened the recipe you have the same last name I was born with!!!!

I hate frying, mixed melted butter with the crumbs and baked it at 350 for 20 minutes.  Came out like it was fried.  I will play with the sauce too. adding other herbs, olives, sun-dried tomatoes, peppers, capers, artichokes. avocados, spinach, blue cheese, swiss, cheddar, limburger, dump the bird and use pork chops, turkey, fish.  ........ 


The limburger was a joke, but who knows?????

Delicious - whole family loved!  Pound chicken.  Thighs and Breasts work great.  Added garlic and scallions while sautéing chicken which not only flavored the chicken, but made the whole house smell great :) ...  Used chopped red pepper instead of pimento and half and half instead of cream.  DOUBLE sauce!   After chicken is pan-fried, I put in oven to keep warm and to make sure it was cooked through while finishing cream sauce and cooking pasta.  Served chicken over pasta with sauce spooned over and sprinkled fresh tomatoes over all.  DELICIOUS!  :)

LOVE LOVE LOVE  I am like the other people who made this.  The sauce is GREAT.  I think the next time I make this I will cook the chicken either on the grill or pan fry it, without the breading.  It was good, but I think we will like this too.   I need leave out the peppers.

Awesome Recipe!  I added a 1/3 of sweet sherry to the sauce and let it reduce.  Everyone loved it.  I also used the shake and bake package mix and added the same amount of panko to the breading.  I'll be making this again!

Hands down one of the best meals we've ever had! Would go great over pasta! Added some crushed red peppers and garlic to the cream. Mmm.

Since we discovered this recipe a few months ago we've made it 5 times, great for entertaining (everyone loves it), simple and quick but very tasty and looks good.  We serve it with pasta with Parmesan and basil to match the flavors and brocolli or beans.

Amazing! Fresh basil is key to this recipe! I cut the chicken breasts in half in thickness, and salt and peppered both sides. I also used Italian style bread crumbs which gave it a nice flavor. To sauce, I added some fresh garlic to drippings and sauted a bit. Then deglazed the pan with a little cream sherry. This gave the sauce such a deeper flavor! Very good! Husband gave it a 5 star rating. Also loved how fast this meal comes together!!

This was fabulous!! I did not use the pimento but I did add 2 cloves of garlic to the chicken broth before I added the cream. I used 1 cup of chicken broth and thickened it with a little chicken broth and flour. Served it with Penne and it was wonderful.  I will definitely make this again.  Maybe even for company.

5 stars, this is really, really good! My only change was to cut the chicken into strips (husband likes that better) and when done cooking mix it all into bowtie pasta. This is a keeper!

Very yummy, flavorful sauce for the chicken.  We skipped breading and frying the chicken and simply used the Foreman grill to cut down on fat and calories.  That also made the recipe even easier to prepare.

This was incredible! I even made it a little healthier by only using half the butter to fry the chicken in and using 5% cream with a tablespoon of cornstarch in place of the whipping cream. I also added some mushrooms and red pepper to the skillet and cooked for a minute or two before adding the broth. I had no problems with the sauce thickening or being bland. I served mine plain and there was just enough sauce, but if you are planning to serve over pasta, definitely double it. To me, the keys to this recipe are the fresh basil (do not leave it out) and freshly grated, good quality parmesan cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

What an awesome change for chicken. I did use the heavy cream. Out of seven in our family, all but one loved it and that one is the super picky eater.

My husband loves this dish.   I frequently substitute low fat half and half for the whipping cream.  I also use frozen cubes of basil when the fresh is out of season.  This recipe is a hit at my home.  Generally served with rice pilaf and some garlic bread to soak up the extra sauce.   DELISH!

Soooooooo delicious!  Sauce was a little thin-next time  I may thicken it up so it will hold better to the pasta.  Served with penne.

Fresh basil is the way to go and truly makes this delicious cream sauce! I didn't have pimento peppers but will definitely have to try them the next time I make this!

This recipe was just ok. I didnt add pimento peppers because i didnt know what they were and couldnt find any in the store. If that is the recipe breaking ingredient i would be shocked. The parm cheese kept seperating from the cream mixture so it tasted gritty. It was also a little runny, i tried to thicken it up with cornstarch but it still just didnt do the trick. The chicken needed to be seasoned before being pan fried. I love basil and this was a big disappointment.

We're not a fan of pimentos...so we did omit those, but nothing else.  It was creamy, delicious and even my boys loved it!!  I used fresh basil and I think that's what really made it!

This is a "company worthy" meal that is easy enough to make for your family on a week night.  I made this exactly like the recipe, except, I boiled the chicken stock for about 4 minutes to reduce it.  I also simmered the sauce for about 5 minutes after adding the cream to allow the sauce to reduce additionally.  Fresh basil really adds to the flavor.  Thanks for a fabulous meal!

I used 1 roasted red bell pepper in place of the pimentos (which I would never have on hand) and that flavor was good, to us. I added garlic to the sauce because we love it. I debated adding onions too, and might next time. I used fat free half & half in place of the cream. The sauce was a bit thin, so I thickened it up with cornstarch/water paste. I ran out of parmesan and had to sub a bit of romano, which was just delicious for us anyway. We added more black pepper at the table--a lot more, but that's probably just us. All in all this was an easy and satisfying meal. Only problem was that I didn't flatten my chix breasts & they didn't cook all the way through, so we had to cut them up & microwave them to doneness. Served over linguine with "Onion Herb Bread" and "Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad", both from this site. Thanks for a keeper!

I just got done eating this recipe (and I do mean JUST) and couldn't wait to write this review. I am always nervous about cooking chicken on the stove top...I'm not very good at it, but this was so easy. I used italian bread crumbs and it went so great. I did not use the pimentos and it still was amazing. I can't say enough about how good this was!!! Thank you!!!!

This chicken was DELICIOUS! It was also quick and easy...3 for 3!! The only change I made was omitting the pimentos (don't like). At the suggestions of others, I doubled the sauce and served it over basmati rice (instead of pasta, but will try that, too)....excellent! My only recommendation is to thicken the sauce either by reducing it or adding corn starch. Mine was a little loose. Aside from that...perfection!!!

wow!  this was great.  the only thing i did differently was not bread the chicken as i'm trying to stick to low carb, so i just browned it and then made the sauce.  wonderful.  can't wait to make it again.  i think it would make a nice christmas entree with the green and red showing up so nicely.

Left out the pimentos and added a dash of fresh nutmeg.  I'll thicken the sauce with a roux next time, but this was magnificent! We're big fans of skin-on fried chicken, but this made the boneless/skinless breasts a real treat.  Great with pasta.

This is by far the best dinner I have cooked. I followed the recipe exactly as said and turned out really good. One thing I do have to say is that the chicken needed a little seasoning. So next time I will season it a bit. Also I have read that some, omit the pimientos and basil!! Well DONT it's what makes this recipe great! :0)

My girlfriend LOVED it, her 6 year old was scared of the pimento. As for myself, I thought the cream was excellent and the chicken needed a longer cook time

Made this yesterday just as recipe stated. Chicken was good, but sauce was way to runny & not much flavor...needless to say, won't make it again.

Really like this sauce, but it doesn't make enough ! There's barely enough for four breasts. Consider doubling the amount of sauce, especially if you're planning to serve this with pasta. I took others' advice, and used white wine (Riesling) instead of the chicken broth, and used 1/2 red pepper, thinly sliced, instead of the pimento pepper. Delicious !

Very Good!  I made some changes based on other reviews - I used 1 tsp. freeze dried garlic soaked in 1/4 C. Chicken Broth and added white wine for the remainder of the broth.  Didn't use pimentoes because I didn't have them and hubby isn't that fond of them.  Used a parmesan/romano blend.  We liked it and would make it again (with a few modifications) but we didn't feel it was "to die for" or that it rated 5 stars - I'm very picky about what gets 5 stars.  A big reason for the 4 stars was I couldn't really taste the basil and I used fresh, home grown basil picked just before preparing.  Don't know why it didn't give as much flavor as I expected.

Followed recipe to a T.  I found it very runny and bland, although my kids did like it, hence me giving it 3 stars.  Won't make it again.

This is a wonderful recipe for showing off. I used a fresh roma tomato from my garden instead of pimiento. I also added about a teaspoon of lemon juice with the chicken broth to brighten the flavor. The sauce turned out to be a perfect consistency.

WOW! Absolutely delicious and easy! Few modifications: I used an egg/milk wash before coating with italian bread crumbs. Used butter and EVOO to saute the chicken. I don't like pimentos so instead I used a can of diced tomatoes (very well drained). Added minced garlic to the pan drippings before adding the broth. I made more of the sauce so there would be extra to spoon over the egg noodles. Once the dish was complete, I topped with some shredded mozzarella cheese. I also recommend using thin cut chicken breasts because they cook a lot quicker. I would highly recommend all of these modifications. DIVINE!!

Very good recipe!  I had basil from my garden running over, so I had made pesto and freezed it.  So I used the pesto in this recipe where it called for basil and it was superb!  I also added a little sweet vermouth to replace some of the chicken broth.

This was excellent.  I did not have any peppers, but it still turned out great.  The parmesan and heavy cream gave it a rich flavor and consistency.  Works well with dried basil as well as fresh.

OUTSTANDING!! Tasty,simple & impressive! I did change it up a bit by dipping chicken in buttermilk and used sourdough bread crumbs. I used sundried tomato halves as I didn't have roasted pimentos in my pantry. This is a keeper!! Thank you for sharing! Delish!!

Restaurant quality - I would definitely serve this to guests in my home.  And the best part is that it is very easy!    I changed it just a bit - used fresh red bell peppers instead of pimentos since I don't like them and used crushed seasoned croutons instead of bread crumbs which made it much more flavorful.  I almost skipped out on the fresh basil and used dried, but I'm glad I didn't as it made the flavor absolutely wonderful.    One thing to note, the sauce turned out quite thick.  I might add some milk or extra chicken broth next time.  It tasted great, but was almost too thick to spread on the chicken.  I will also make double in the future to add to noodles.  This recipe is a keeper all the way around and I will definitely make it again!

Very tasty and easy. I did not have pimentos and substituted sauteed red pepper strips and mushrooms before adding the chicken back to the pan. Also used dried basil and it was very good. Fresh would be better though. Thanks for sharing.

Being the mom of 2 teenage girls who don't like anything the same I am on a constant mission to be able to fix only 1 meal for dinner.  I have not been very successful until now.  Both of my picky eaters loved this dish!!!  I wonder if they will eat it every night?

Wow...this is a quick and delicious way out of your everyday chicken.  Like many others, I did without the pimento peppers and it turned out so wonderful.  I seasoned my breadcrumbs and also the milk to dip the chicken in with a little garlic powder and salt and pepper.  Will certainly add this to the regular routine!

I substituted greek yogurt and some sour cream because I didn't have any heavy whipping cream, and it still came out fine, if a little thick.  Also, I had some mushrooms on hand that needed to be used, and tossed them into the sauce - they complimented the flavor quite well and I think I'll use them again the next time I make this.

I went from staring at some frozen chicken breasts to having a quality meal within an hour. Gotta love those kind of finds. I used half and half instead of the cream, and it was still delicious.

My family loved this. I used chicken tender cuts instead of the whole breast. Chicken was tender and sauce was good, Highly recommend quick and easy to prepare. made the whole dinner in about 30 min.   I pared it up with tomato basil pasta and  Sautéed garlic asparagus.  I did not have fresh basil, I used pineapple sage instead, it was still tasty.  There were happy plates all around.

Deeeeelish! I didn't have fresh basil or the olives so I left the olives out and used dried basil... and it was still good. Can't wait to try the recipe as written. Thanks for a great, easy, cheap dinner. I served it with elbow pasta.

THIS RECIPE WAS REALLY GOOD AND EASY TO MAKE. THE ONLY CHANGES I MADE WERE...I SAUTEED A FEW CLOVES OF GARLIC AND HALF OF A VIDALIA ONION BEFORE I ADDED THE BROTH. ALSO, I USED HALF AND HALF INSTEAD OF WHIPPING CREAM. I WAS OUT OF FRESH BASIL SO I SUBSITUTED WITH DRY BASIL. MY FAMILY LOVED IT SO IT'S A KEEPER!

My family really loved this recipe.  Followed some users advice and added some garlic to the butter.  Also added some white wine (w/the chicken broth) for some extra flavor.  Made a bit extra sauce and served w/farfalle pasta from Trader Joe's.    Made chicken w/fresh breadcrumbs (added ground Italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs)

Very good recipe. Easy to make and very tasty. Didn't use pimentos but that was the only change we made.

This was so good! I diced the chicken first and used sundried tomatoes instead of pimentos and I doubled the cream sauce b/c I was serving it with pasta. Only recommendation for changing is for me, I thought the cream sauce with the fried chicken and pasta was too heavy. I would serve it with grilled chicken next time, however if you are just doing the fried chicken this sauce is a great addition. Trust me, we all thought it was great, but I would just prefer that slight change next time. Definitely give this a try.

this was really good.  I used half and half instead of heavy, which worked out fine.  I'd use less Parmesan next time, I found it a little dominating.  I love finding ways to use fresh herbs.

I used thinly sliced chicken breast and dipped them in butter and then bread crumbs with grated parm. cheese, garlic powder and italian herbs then rolled them and baked them while I made the sauce.  I added garlic and used sliced roasted red peppers.  It was great!!!!  Next time I think I might add a little red pepper for some kick.  I will totally make this again.

So simple and so good.  I pounded the chicken breast to cook more evenly and quicker.  I served it over angel hair pasta.

This was very good, very quick, and very easy.  The recipe didn't call for it, but I always pound chicken breast to an even thickness.  It cooks more evenly and has a more delicate texture.  I had to use dried basil (1 tbsp.) and I added about 1/4 cup white wine with the chicken broth, cause I like that too!  Delicious weeknight meal.

turned out pretty good. i took the other reviewer's advice and pounded the chicken breasts. I also chilled breaded breasts for 10 min prior to cooking. Did not use pimentos. I added a clove of garlic, paprika, and some onion.

This recipe was not only easy and fast but it was delicious!!! The only things I did different were that I used homemade whole wheat crumbs, dipped the chicken in olive oil instead of milk, I sauteed garlic before I added the chicken stock, I used fat free half/ half, and I added some wheat flour to thicken a bit more. It was wonderful and my whole family absolutely loved it!!!!

This was terrific!  Even my picky 2 year old at it.  Tastes great on noodles or rice (I prefer brown rice).  Only suggestion would be to add a little garlic salt.  Thanks for this keeper recipe!

this was good. i used half and half instead of heavy cream to cut down on the fat. i also didn't have any fresh basil so i used some dry. it was a tiny bit bland but that's probably due to the dry basil.
also, my sauce seperated because i had it on too high of a heat! eep. it tasted fine just looked pretty gross, haha.

My husband and I loved this. I worked with what I had in hand - italian bread crumbs instead of regular, milk instead of cream, and a 1/2 tbsp or so of paprika instead of pimientos. I used fresh chopped basil from my garden and some really good fresh grated parmesan cheese. I was amazed by the wonderful flavor of this dish. We thought it was as good as any italian dish we've eaten in great restaurants. I served it with cheese/garlic tortellini, simple salad and fresh warmed italian bread and butter.

We all loved this!  I lessoned the basil a little, as my daughter isn't crazy about it. Don't forget to salt the chicken first.  Served over fettucine, I'll make this again! Excellent!

Very tasty. I used fresh basil from the garden and used a clove of garlic too. I don't think I let my cream get warm enough b/c my cheese all clumped up, but the flavor was still good. I salted my chicken and will not do that next time as there was enough salt in the sauce. Served over penne with peas added to the sauce. yum!

This is a rich meal, but very good; too bad it is so loaded with fat, or I'd make it more often.  First time I made it I substituted pimentos with a jar of roasted red peppers which turned out well.  The second time I didn't add either and I think I liked it even better.

The sauce is what really makes this great. It could be used over any kind of chicken. The "Butter Chicken" recipe from this site comes to mind.

Great recipe.  I only cooked 2 chicken breasts but kept the amount of sauce the same, so I would suggest doubling the sauce for 4 chicken breast as others suggested.  I didn't add any pimemtos and used dried basil added a little garlic.  I served it over linguine with a side of green beans and warm baguettes.  Delicious meal.  My husband loved it!

Great for leftovers too.  We loved the recipe, hubby thought it was fantastic.  I doubled the recipe and good thing....we wanted it again the next night.  To change it up a bit, I sliced some baby bella mushrooms and sauteed them in butter then added the leftover chicken(cut up) and sauce. I then poured it over noodles.  It was like a new meal!!

My friend gave me this recipe about five years ago.  I make it often and serve it over angel hair.  Make sure to scrape up the bits at the bottom of the pan when you add the cream.  Yummy!!!  It is so good and so creamy.  Excellent recipe.

Although when I got through with this it was 5 stars and a new favorite. We did have to make a roux and add it in to thicken the sauce. Flavor was fantastic.

Very tasty! I didn't have fresh ingredients, so used dried basil and Kraft grated parmesan cheese in the shaker. I thought it needed a little something so I added some garlic and butter. I served it over pasta as well. My family loved it!

I used egg to bread the chicken, and I don't know what a pimento pepper is so I used roasted peppers, but it came out great. I'm definitely making this again.

SO good! I used egg to dip the breasts in before breading them. My grocer was out of heavy whipping cream so I just used regular whipping cream. The sauce was runny because of this (no fault of the recipe!). I used Parmesean bread crumbs. Delish!

Yummy!  The only thing I changed was to use seasoned bread crumbs because that is all that I had.  Other than that, followed directions to a "T" and the chicken turned out so moist.  Served sauce over white rice.  (See photo) Will definetly make again.  Very easy and very quick to make.  Thanks so much Emily

Awesome!  Great use for some of that fresh summer basil and paired prefectly with home grown tomatoes.  I cut the breasts into strips, left out the pimientos, and cooked the sauce for a good 10-15 minutes (stirring frequently) in order to thicken.  Family loved it (kids without the sauce)--Can't wait to serve to company.

i love basil, so i was excited when i found this recipie. i made this last night for dinner, and it came out not bad, but nothing spectacular. it looked delicious, but tasted just normal. i thought it was missing something, i can't pin it down, but it needed something extra to make it better.

This was a very good recipe. I wanted to use up some chicken and thought I'd give it a whirl and it was just wonderful! I'll be making some more of the sauce by itself to put on noodles. Very good!

This recipe was pretty good, but the sauce ended up a little too thick by the time I added the parmesan cheese. I think next time I will add a little more cream. I served mine with pasta, too, and it was delicious.

I used fat free half & half in place of the cream to cut the calorie and fat content. I used only about half of the pimentos and dried basil. Next time I think I will get fresh basil so give it more flavor. Overall, it was a nice dish. My picky daughter even liked it.

I thought this was very good. Considering that i did't have all of the ingredients. I used a chicken boullion cube instead of broth. I used dried basil instead of fresh (I only used about 2 tablespoons, maybe less) I didn't use the pimento peppers or any other type of pepper.  I think next time i will go food shopping before i make this again:) Other than that i liked it and so did my husband. Will try to make again.

I'm thinking most of the problems this recipe had were because of my high altitude. I had to add some flour and corn starch (yuck) to the sauce to try to get it to thicken up. It was pretty good once it all worked out, but it was also a really big pain.

This recipe is very easy to make.  I didn't slice the chicken to be thin so the chicken was a little too dry after long fried.  I'll make it again though.

Delicious! Added an additional 1/2 cup heavy cream, parmesan cheese, and broth for the sauce and it was fantastic over whole grain pasta. Definitely a remake.

This is a simple recipe that produces an elegant result!  I only substituted sun dried tomatoes for the pimentos because the hubs won't eat pimentos.  Otherwise, I made it as written.  It was sooooo delicious!  I will be making it again.

Excellent dish. I made the sauce with a full cup of broth and served it over rice. The rice soaked up the thinner sauce and made for a really nice accompaniment. My kids inhaled it!

Wow, this was incredible! The family LOVED it. With the exception of the pimento peppers (did not have any), I made it exactly as written using fresh basil from our garden! It was easy to pull together. I served it with angel hair pasta. Hubby and son raved about it, want it "in the rotation".

Love this recipe! Made it by myself then made it for the family when I visited.  My family can be an awfully talkative group during dinner but they quieted right down once they started eating.
Couple additions consisted of angel hair pasta over raw spinach. (hot pasta wilted the spinach) and cherry tomatoes cut in half as a garnish.
Fyi... If you enjoy hot then throw some red pepper flakes on the finished product.  You also can substitute it for the regular pepper during the cooking process if everyone likes hot.  ENJOY!

Probably one of my favorite dishes for everyday use. Presentation was beautiful! I added my own spices and some lemon to the top of the dishes and thickened up the sauce with flour and more cheese. It was SO GOOD!

I double the sauce recipe but only use the original amount of pimento.  I also add 1 lb. of sliced mushrooms.  Serve with noodles and voila...... you have a huge hit on your hands.

So simple and SOOO delicious!!  I made it exactly as directed, but doubled the broth and cream for the sauce (used just one portion of basil and pimentos) and poured over egg noodles. My one suggestion is definitely use thinner chicken breasts, or pound them thinner. Will definitely be making this again!!

Love It, So Yummy!
I wanted to make it low carb so I fried the chicken breast with out the breading and then added the sauce to the top. I also added some chopped up artichoke hearts(non marinated) to the sauce for extra texture. 
I will definitely be making this again very very soon!

I made this sauce to go over salmon and it was great!  After I sauteed the salmon in butter and removed it from the pan, I added a bit of flour (I didn't want a thick, heavy sauce) and added half & half, salt & pepper, parmesan cheese and basil.  Next time I'll add wine!

This was super easy with everyday ingredients. I added a little extra Parmesan just to make the sauce a little thicker. I have used the sauce over and over again for other meats too!

Was looking for a recipe to use the fresh sweet basil in my garden - and this was it!  I used half & half because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't have any pimentos so I used finely chopped red sweet pepper.  I also made the chicken like I do for my regular fried chicken and seasoned the breadcrumbs with garlic powder, salt, black pepper and ground cayenne pepper.  (I triple dip my fried chicken - dredge in seasoned flour (salt & pepper), dip in beaten eggs, then dredge in the seasoned breadcrumbs, then into the pan it goes.)  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent- Made it with grouse, did two rounds. Would have been better if all meat was in one round of cooking because by the second round there were more bread crumbs that were getting extra brown in the pan and made the sauce a little to chunky.

This was such a flavorful chicken dish! My husband and I couldn’t get enough! The only substitution I made was I used jarred roasted red pepper instead of the pimiento.  The fresh basil taste was amazing!

My family said that this was hands down the best chicken I've ever made(and I make a lot of chicken).  I pounded the chicken breasts(which I'm sure helped with tenderness).  Only thing I changed was that I left out pimientos(because I didn't have any) and just added some cute teeny-tiny  cherry tomatoes for a pop of color.   Not only did it look super yummy...but it tasted super yummy too!  Will definitely be making this one again!

Excellent recipe!  My family loved it, especially the sauce.  We had some leftovers and they didn't stay in the frig long.  I used boneless pork cutlets instead of chicken, which required more breading because they were thicker. I also finished them off at 350 for 15 min in the oven after browning them in the pan, again due to thickness.  Other changes I made were minor.  I seasoned the pork with salt and pepper before breading, used Italian Herb Parmesan Panko breadcrumbs, added some minced garlic, and increased the sauce measurements so that we'd have extra for the pasta I served it with.

I like this dish, but my family absolutely loved it.  I used Italian panko crumbs on the chicken, and doubled the sauce recipe to have enough to flavor some linguine noodles as well.  It's a little "one note" for me, so next time I might put a few more herbs in the sauce.  But overall, its a tasty dish and we'll be making it again sometime.

Amazing dish! We loved this! The sauce was absolutely scrumptious. We used the basil that you buy in the produce aisle in a tube. A 1/2 tablespoon was the perfect amount. This will absolutely be something we make again and again. It would be perfect paired with zucchini pasta.

I thought it was great and the family did too. I served it on top of Orzo noodles and arugula.  The kids picked out the peppers and arugula. I used half and half and fat free half and half. I also coated it with Panko style bread crumbs which seemed to not work as well. It didn't look anything like the video. I also had really big pieces of chicken so I had to cook it longer and then the panco burned a bit.  I cooked it on a cast iron skillet. I then put it in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes just to make sure it was cooked. I hate overcooked chicken and I tend to undercook it sometimes.

Loved the recipe, the changes I made were I used smoked sun dryed  tomatoes Julianne sliced instead of pimentos for the cream sauce. I pounded the chicken breasts cooked them only a few minutes until they turned golden brown. Set them aside  until my guest arrived and baked them about 15 minutes before we were ready to eat. They were cooked all the way thru. This is one of our family's favorites.

Amazing light and light and creamy dish. Even my absurdly picky husband loves this dish! I have made it >15 times! I have used both fresh and dried basil and both come out great!

Made some minor changes based on what I had on hand. Coated chicken tenders in flour, salt, and pepper, used fat free cream, and a handful of halved cherry tomatoes instead of pimentos. Fantastic.

This is my wife's favorite meal we make it with green bean casserole and mashed red skinned potatoes with dill and garlic. I add some corn starch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! My husband and I loved it. It tasted like something that I would have gotten at a high end restaurant! I did make it with thighs and not breast because we don't care for white meat. I also froze half of this, I froze the chicken separate from the sauce and it was just as good as when I first made it! I will definitely be making this again!

This chicken and sauce were delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly because I don't think it should be rated with changes if you haven't made it before as it says.  Both my husband and I liked it  and it was a nice use for the fresh basil I have growing in my Aerogarden!  We had some sauce left over so I put it over pasta for lunch the next day.  it was terrific.  Yes. I will make it  again!

Our entire household absolutely loves this recipe! It is the one meal I know that we'll have no leftovers. I too doctored it a bit by adding garlic but seriously this is one of the best recipes I've found on allrecipes or Pinterest!!!!

Made this 2 times now & love the sauce. The only thing I found out is "make sure the chicken is defrosted completely". The 1st time I made it must not have been cause I never got any browned bits int he pan, there also was to much "juice" in the pan. The other night I made sure the breasts were defrosted completely, thought ok, I won't use the butter to fry in.  Wrong, you need it cause I had to add when cooking the chicken. We don't like pimento so use red pepper diced.  Here again I learned a lesson because it can cause to much liquid in the pan.  Don't add the pepper when still frying the chicken.  My peppers were defrosted ones, not fresh so again, to much juice.  I know the directions say to put in when the cream is added, but I wanted to make sure peppers were soften & cooked.  I will put peppers in with cream now also, & think I have the cooking of this recipe down now so the sauce is perfect instead of to thin.  This doesn't take long to cook & it is like a GOOD restaurant entree.

Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this! I did not have the pimento peppers and the sauce was still delicious. I served this over angel hair. My family devoured it including my 1 year old. Excellent!! Will definitely be making this Aguascalientes's it came together easily and tasted as though I spent hours making the sauce. Thank you!!

I made the recipe as written (except I used gluten free bread crumbs). The chicken will take longer to fry based on how thick your pieces are. It's best if they are thin and even, as the coating will begin to burn before the inner breast is cooked through. As for the sauce, it was rather ho-hum. Using plain cream makes it very heavy; perhaps use a quarter to half cup of milk instead of all cream. It reminded me of a plain alfredo sauce. The taste was not awful, but it needed another element to make it stand out, perhaps something salty or acidic. The basil was hard to taste through the cream; I'd probably double it.

Overall, not a bad meal. Can be made again if tweaked.

In a previous review I posted, I failed to mention what I did with the leftovers, which we had only because it's just my husband and I. Added capers & cut the chicken in small pieces. This recipe was delicious as written & even better after adding capers. Will definitely make this again.

The chicken was good, but it was just breading cooked.  The sauce, however, was horrible.  I did not like this boring recipe.

Like the reviewer, I added garlic to the recipe. I also added Himalayan sea salt and capers. It was very good. My husband said it was "restaurant quality". My 6 year old and I only ate the sauce with the pasta, and we both enjoyed it.

I have made this recipe so many times....for my husband and two teenage girls, for a whole crowd, and for a pot luck at work. Everyone raves about this and wants the recipe. The only thing I change(and it's not really a change) is that I double the sauce. It goes great with bow-tie pasta!!!

Put this on baked halibut instead of chicken. So delicious!! Skipped the pimentos and added a pinch of garlic salt and thickened with a little flour. Also threw some sauteed mushrooms on top after reading that someone else had. This dish could have been from a fancy restaurant! I'll definitely be making it again!

I very much enjoy this recipe. It's simple enough for a weeknight meal, but interesting and uses ingredients I don't tend to cook with every day. Helps me to keep the flavors I'm bringing to my table fresh. The fresh basil and pimentos are a great combination and go nicely with the rich, buttery chicken. Easy to put together a nice looking meal with some bread, pasta, and a veggie on the side. I'm adding this to my regular rotation as a simple way to prepare chicken that pleases everyone.

I left the pimento peppers out and used dried basil instead of fresh and doubled the amount of sauce because I made egg noodles to serve on the side. It tasted almost restaurant quality in my opinion. The chicken breasts I used were rather thick so they did take over 10 mins to cook and next time I think I'll use chicken breast tenderloins so they cook faster.

I love this recipe so much! It has become a favorite in our house. The sauce is so amazing. I always double the sauce so that it makes plenty to spoon over the chicken and egg noodles.

Love this with zucchini noodles. It's now a family favorite. Works well also if you just sauté the chicken without the breeding and serve with the sauce

Love this! Double the sauce to have some for a side of pasta! I never have pimentos on hand so I use diced roasted red peppers, or chopped Roma tomatoes. Soooo good! And I add garlic.

I  love this recipe. I do make a little extra cream. I also have substituted pimento for sundried tomatoes. The biggest best change is I add the chicken back into the skillet and simmer for 15 minutes or more. This lets the chicken become more juicy and flavorful.

It was fantastic. I made some rigatoni noodles to place the chicken and sauce on as well. I threw in some extra seasonings to the sauce like mrs. Dash. It turned out great

This is a second time making this and my husband really likes it.  The sauce does not thicken based on the cooking instructions for me, so I let it cook longer.  I only made two chicken breasts both times and we didn't use the sauce for anything else, so you would definately need to double or even triple the sauce for noodles in my opinion because there wasn't much left over.  We love fresh basil and have a garden of it whenever its the right season. We also love sun dried tomatoes and since I did not have pimentos, I substituted  sun dried tomatoes and again the second time because it was so good this first time.  This sauce could be versatile!  As a personal preference, I always use half panko bread crumbs and half grated fresh parmesan cheese and seasonings to bread chicken.  We enjoy the taste more and it seems to get less soggy.  The great thing about spooning the sauce over the chicken instead of cooking the chicken in it was the crispy chicken! Thank you for a wonderful sauce recipe!

I added 3 cloves minced garlic per a reviewer's hint. This dish was delicious! My picky 8 yr old loved it, even the cream sauce that she used to dip each bite of chicken into. I served over jasmine white rice but next time will do pasta.

We thought this was quite good.  I did make the mistake of not pounding out the breasts so the thicker ones took longer to cook while the small ones sat and waited quite a while.  Will probably try half and half next time to reduce fat.  This went well with pasta, on which we put the sauce.  Will make again.

The only thing I did different was to saute some chopped  scallions in the pan after I removed the cooked chicken breasts and then I added the cream and other stuff.  It seemed to give is some additional flavor.

Entire family loved this tasty dish - will definitely make again!  I sliced the chicken breast to half the thickness, added salt and pepper to each side, used half and half , added 1 clove of  minced garlic to the sauce, and omitted the pimentos since I did not have any on hand.  Drizzled sauce over pasta and chicken, sprinkled additional fresh basil on top!  Delizioso!

I had to cook the chicken 10 mins longer than advised. We don't have a food processor since we are in an apartment right now, so I coarsely chopped the pimento peppers. Overall, very good!

I made this last night , it was amazing and easy to make. I did use 6 tablespoons of butter not margarine.  My husband is not a fan of chicken breast because of the meat being dry. He raved about how good this meal was ,and stated how moist it was. And did I mention how easy it was to make ! Thank you for the wonderful dish. One more thing we had extra sauce so we froze it to put on salmon or a steak.

I prepared this on faith in the basil cream and happened to have boneless, skinless chicken breasts in the freezer. These are not my favorite part of the chicken.  I followed the recipe to the letter to avoid over cooking the chicken.  This turned out to be the best chicken I've had in my 75 years.  The breasts were tasty, moist and TENDER and the basil cream was just as delicious.  I chose steamed broccoli as a side and it enjoyed the flavor of the cream.

This is one of our favorite dishes! The only changes I made was to pound the breasts flat, added an egg to the milk and seasoned the breadcrumbs. Serve this over some pasta and you're in heaven.

I made this but added a  bunch of other ingredients - Asparagus, garlic, peppers and spinach.  I almost doubled the liquids based on other reviews - I thought it was too runny until i started to eat it and it seemed to stick with the pasta I paired with it (I turned it into a pasta dish more so than a chicken dish). 
I also added asiago cheese - delish!!  Will make again for sure!!

Everyone loved this dish. Most got seconds.  I substituted sliced cherry tomatoes for the pimentos and I used white wine to breakup brown on the pan. Came out great. Pretty easy and quick.

LOVE this sauce. I will definitely be making this recipe again and will make extra next time and will add more basil. I will also pound out the chicken or use cutlets as well. Didn't have the peppers and didn't miss them.

Loved it!  Used it on fish (flounder) instead of chicken and my husband really liked it.  Followed the directions but also used panko bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  Loved  the fresh basil flavor.

This turned out to be one of the easiest and tastiest dinners??I sprinkled the floured chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic  powder. I followed he recipe exactly from that point on. The flavor of the cream sauce is wonderful! I could see making the sauce for other uses

Wonderful recipe! I pan seared the chicken and threw it in the oven so I'd have the pan drippings and be able to cook the sauce right away.  Worked perfect! Served with spaghetti squash for our low carb version and it pairs perfectly with the squash. Very quick and tasty. Thank you for this great recipe!

Didn't have dry crumbs on hand, so I made soft bread crumbs and seasoned them with salt and pepper. Also doubled the ingredients for the sauce and added one large minced garlic clove. As directed I added the pimento while cooking the sauce and just a bit of the basil. The remaining basil I used as a garnish. Served this over angel hair pasta. Delicious! The fresh basil makes this dish.

Pretty easy and elegant. I sautéed garlic in oil and butter and then continued making the sauce in the same pan.

I made this as directed except I used oil to cook the chicken.  It was extremely easy and tasted splendid!  I served it over a bed of orzo with salad, asparagus and a slice of garlic bread.  My youngest thought it looked like a gourmet meal.  My oldest went back for seconds.  I'm growing basil now and can't wait to use it for this recipe.  I'm not sure why people were having trouble thickening the sauce.  Ours came out perfect.

Like another reviewer, all I had was half-and-half so I used that. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I'm moving this recipe from the 'Sounds Good' recipe box straight to "BF Approved' because I will be making it again!

This is really tasty! Unfortunately, the quality of any leftovers diminishes significantly. While the cream sauce was delicious when fresh, after cooling and reheating the sauce separated into chunky solids and puddles of oil, which oversaturated the chicken and made it all soggy. I would only make this again if I knew it would all get eaten that night.

An easy recipe that the whole family devoured.  The chicken breasts were large, so I had to cook longer and I used three instead of four.  I might use chicken tenderloin next time or just cut down beforehand.  I also discovered that I was out of bread crumbs, so I made my own with Saltines, Italian Seasoning and Garlic Powder.  None of this detracted from the taste.  I plated this dish over Jasmine rice.  Yummy!

Loved this recipe. The sauce came out very liquidy so I added some flour to thicken it up since I like my sauces thicker. worked perfectly and the sauce with chicken is super yummy!

Made as is. Just used 2 tbs of dried basil instead. More than enough sauce if served with mash potatoes, would probably double the sauce if serving with pasta. I did pound my chicken breast because I like thin meat.

A true restaurant quality recipe! I didn't change a thing, except sun dried tomatoes for the pimento. Leave it fattening w the heavy cream and butter, it's soooo good! I did use 2 tablespoons only and a nice splash of olive oil, but other than that this recipe will be breaking any diet rules pretty often in my house!! I made whole grain egg noodles to make myself feel better about the whole situation. Excellent! Thanks for posting!

This was great! Crushed some Ritz crackers in with Italian bread crumbs, all I had, and didn't have pimentos. Made 11/2 times sauce and could have used more . It was so good.

Easy to make with excellent taste!  I pounded out chicken to 1/2 inch or less so it would cook quickly (like a schnitzel).  I didn't have pimentos so just skipped them this time but would try them next time.  It will easily become a family favorite

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I was excited to try it.  The chicken turned out great...it was the sauce that I had trouble with.  The cream seemed to separate from the chicken broth. I followed the directions exactly and it curdled twice for me and was both curdled and runny on the plate.  A big fail in my books.

Yummy! Next time I'm going to make with pasta to soak up the leftover sauce.  I omitted the pimentos and the flavor was still very good.

The presentation on this was really good. The sauce drizzled over the battered chicken looks beautiful. Although for me the basil was a bit overpowering. It probably was because I didn't have fresh basil at hand so I substituted with dried which I think is more condensed so it ended up being too much. Other then that the sauce was very delicious.

We actually did like it a lot. We made a few changes to it though. We made some pasta for the chicken and sauce to go over, and it was great. We also agreed that we should've doubled the sauce because there was hardly enough for it even with the chicken alone and adding the pasta didn't help that issue. Again, we liked the flavors, however we just believe that those two modifications improved it immensely.

Used To Die for Pesto (1/2 cup) instead of fresh basil and red peppers instead of pimentos. Cooked for 15 min turning every 5 min.

Was good. But next time I'm using egg to cost the chicken because the bread crumbs didn't stay on the chicken.

It was okay, but it was quite blah, definitely needed salt which I did add along with pepper and Italian seasoning. Wouldn't make again.

This sauce was WONDERFUL, we did make the chicken a bit different (cooked to cripsy outside) but the sauce was so good we were using bread to clean the plate!

** i did add a bit of cayenne pepper to it to spice it up.

This was very good. Make a bit more of the sauce. Will diffinitly make again. It surprised me that it didn't have a very strong basil flavor. I was expecting a pesto type flavor. Still very good and will make again

This is one of our favorite meals.  I modify it a little..
An egg or egg white, salt, pepper and paprika in the milk bath prior to dredging in seasoned bread crumbs.  I use boneless thighs, because my husband loves them, and they stay really juicy and can easily be opened up to get everything cooked through easily with a nice, crispy crust.  I double the sauce, add crushed red pepper and a dash of white pepper instead of pimento and toss the sauce over a pound of pasta, and serve the chicken on top of that.

Fresh basil is a must.  I first tried this recipe over the summer when we had tons of basil coming out of the garden and I was trying ANYTHING to use it up.  Despite all my efforts, we still had an incredible amount of basil, so I froze a lot and just started using that stash.  When you throw a frozen chunk in the sauce and let it cook down, it's just as if I threw in fresh basil.  Love!

I added more Parmesan cheese and I used the shake and bake crispy chicken and dipped the chicken in egg rather than milk. tasted like a dish you would order at an Italian restaurant. I would give it a five star rating but my 14 year old son preferred the chicken without the sauce.

Excellent. My entire family loved this - which is  a truly rare occasion.  I did make changes, but minor ones.  I skipped the pimento peppers entirely as the kids would have just picked them out.  Instead of heavy cream, I substituted 2 Cups of lactose free 2% milk along with 2 T of cornstarch, and skipped the broth and just stirred a broth packet into the milk.  Made a wonderful rich thick cream sauce without all the fat.   My family was spooning the sauce over the green beans and over the rice I made with this.  Just a wonderful recipe and actually very easy to make.  Thanks Emily!!!

I have been making this recipe for several years, altering nothing, but doubling the sauce. I've served it with pasta or mashed potatoes, anything you can put the sauce over.  Hubs has asked me to make it TWICE in the past two weeks, and just requested it AGAIN. Fresh basil and the pimentoes make the dish.

It was fantastic, I love mushrooms and broccoli so I substituted the peppers for those two and it was an instant hit. I put the mushrooms in first after the broth boiled and when the basil hit the skillet oh my! I dropped the broccoli in last as I like to retain the snap when I bite into it. To top it off I used shaved Parmesan when served.

Super easy.  I pounded the chicken a little and that made it cook quickly.  I also added two cloves of crushed garlic.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Super yummy!  I will make again for sure!

This is by far one of my favorite chicken recipes!  I'v made it so many time for myself and guests that I can't keep count and I've always had rave reviews.  If your a big fan of anything basil as I am, give this recipe a try.  Especially if you're having company, It has a beautiful presentation and your guests will think you slaved like a dog in the kitchen.  I always make double the sauce and pair it with couscous and a steamed veggie.

Great recipe and outstanding flavor! The fresh basil makes it. It is so good. It was easy prep and quick cook time. My husband loved it. The only change I made was to add a it of corn starch. I love a a gravy like sauce. This is excellent and I will pass on to friends.

I love cream, I love Basil, but this was kind of blah.  I didn't mind it, but I didn't like the way the cream texture turned the breadcrumbs into a mushy mess.  We all ate it and it was OK, but I won't be making it again.

I love this recipe! It's really easy to make and my boys love the sauce.  I prefer beating milk and eggs together for a better coating. The breadcrumbs even stick better during sauteeing. I also like unsalted broth. Heavy cream can be substituted with half and half. A bit of flour adds some thickness to the sauce.

Absolutely delicious!  I did add some chopped garlic and use fresh red peppers, chopped.  A few pepper flakes would add a little more flavor. Will use some next time.

This is awesome! My wife and I loved it. Served over penne pasta and substituted sun dried tomatoes instead of pimento because I'm not a big fan of them. The measurement of the bread crumbs was a little off, I used 3/4 cup instead. A keeper for sure.

This is absolutely wonderful! One of the best  ever. Consider doubling the receipe if you want any leftovers! The only thing I will do different next time is to pound the Chicken breasts to get them thinner. Again, excellent.

I made this last night, modifying the breaking procedure as other reviewers recommended.  I also was short on grated Parmesan so I added an Italian blend of shredded cheeses.  Addition of garlic.  The result was phenomenal.  Absolutely loved it and will be making it again.

This was about the best chicken I have ever had. The sauce was incredible. I sauteed 3 chopped cloves of garlic and a few very fine slices of onion before cooking the chicken. Served with Roasted Garlic Zucchini and Tomatoes from this site. Topped it with chopped green onions.

I made this last night but like others here I made a few modifications.  I added a bit of olive oil to the pan for frying the chicken.  Then cooked the chicken just until done with a nice crust then put in the oven at 350 to finish cooking while I made the sauce.  I did make almost double the sauce for the noodles that I made as a side.  I added a dash of paprika and red pepper (not much as my family don't like spicy) I also used a half and half mix of Gruyere and freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  I grow my own basil, oregano, and thyme.  I added just a bit of thyme and fresh oregano to the sauce.  I also chopped up 1/4 of a large sweet onion and 3 crushed garlic cloves (we love garlic).  I sauteed the onions, garlic, and  pimentos in the pan first before adding the chicken broth.  I placed the noodles on the plate then the chicken breast then the sauce.  My family loved it.  My family doesn't usually get excited about chicken but I was told this was a keeper.

I'll make this again for a company meal. It was a little too rich for a weekday. The only change I made was to use fat free half and half. But it was very, very good.

This was great!  I will make it again next time I have guests.  I put it over orzo pasta, used Panko bread crumbs (double dipping in the milk and crumbs), doubled the sauce, and used mushrooms instead of pimento.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!!   The sauce is flavorful and not too heavy, even with the cream.  It is also pretty...keeping it in mind to serve over spinach noodles at the holidays.

This is a very good recipe! If your not a pimento person like me substitute chopped tomatoes which is super yummy and eye appealing for this dish...garlic is always a great addition too so add a bit of chopped garlic to the pan after you add the broth and it will soften up or just smash a clove or two that you can remove once the sauce is done for flavor only but no bits. Enjoy!

Eh, not a fan of this. It was extremely bland. The sauce didn't have much flavor. I found myself wishing I had made alfredo sauce (just add more cheese and garlic to sauce) or chicken cordon bleu (add wine, and also capture some REALLY great flavor from the chicken). I already have favorite recipes for both of these from this site. So, no need to make this bland sauce again and try to doctor it to match a 5* recipe that I already love.

This was great! We pounded out the chicken breasts some to ensure they would cook all the way through and used seasoned panko crumbs. We also added salt after plating which we found further enhanced the flavors. Next time we plan to double the black pepper in the sauce because we like heat. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Devine! In general I consider myself to be a mediocre dinner cook and this recipe was a bit intimidating at first; however I was pleasantly surprised at how simple it really was.  I was out of chicken broth and didn't have pimento so I used extra cream and 2 garlic cloves instead.  I also substitued the plain bread crumbs for the italian seasoned kind.  The chicken took longer to cook than the 10 minutes stated, so I finished cooking it in the oven once I got a nice brown cripsy crust.  This was by far my breakout I needed to prove that there's hope for me yet!

Just made this on Sunday.  I must admit, I didn't want to run to the store, so I did not have any pimentos and the only fresh herb I had on hand was Sage, so I substituted that.  Delicious!!  Will definitely make again.  My husband even drizzled some of the sauce on his potato and loved it!

Super easy and my husband and daughter raved about it! Next time I would make a little bit of angel hair pasta to put under the chicken because there was plenty of extra sauce and it's the best part. Also, I left out the pimentos and it was great without them.

When I made this I replaced the pimentos with chopped sun dried tomatoes! It was delicious! I also put it over egg noodles Andy served with bread and oil. The chicken breast took 30 minutes for each piece to cook because they were so thick so next time I will probably slice them in half before cooking, other than that it was amazing, I doubled the sauce so I could use it to dress the noodles.

The sauce for this was wonderful, especially on pasta.  The chicken was good, but I think I would prefer it on thinner chicken breasts than what I used.

What a tasty sauce! I doubled the sauce as others recommended, but used 1 c. milk and 1 c. cream.  It thickened up nicely, and I'm sure the Parmesan helped with that. I made steamed broccoli and a parmesan rice with it but next time I will make pasta and use the sauce on that, too. The sauce is very pretty and would be perfect served to guests. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I used fresh pimentos and my boyfriend LOVED the dish. I thought it could use a teeny bit more flavor but overall the dish was excellent. I'm definitely going to be pounding the chicken first next time.

This was delicious.  I liked this sauce better for chicken than the typical white sauce (using flour butter and milk).  I doubled the sauce recipe for the meal.  The only change I made was reducing the amount of basil and pepper (I wanted to keep it on bland side for kids), and and it was still flavorful.  Served with rice and steamed brocolli on the side and the sauce was great for pouring over that.

We made this without pimentos and added garlic and it was a winner.  My youngest is recently grain free so tonight I made it without bread crumbs and used coconut flour instead and it still tasted great.

My family loved this recipe.  I substituted cream of chicken for the whipping cream.  I omitted the pimento since I didn't have any.

This was really yummy! I didn't have quite enough Parmesan so I added some mozzarella. I also omitted the pimento peppers, instead I diced up some tomatoes, put them on top of the chicken and then spooned the sauce over top. Excellent! Will definitely consider doubling to use over top some side pasta next time.

This could have had a little more jazz for us, but it was still very good.  I used white wine instead of the chicken broth (as mentioned by another reviewer) and it gave it wonderful flavor.

Great recipe! Like other reviews suggest I dipped the chicken in flour, then egg, then seasoned bread crumbs. I cooked it in a mixture of butter and seasoned evoo. I too doubled the sauce, used fresh basil, and served it over the chicken and pasta. This ones a keeper for sure! Very good!!

The sauce is delicious! I cut up fresh jalapeño pepper and grilled it and used that instead of the pimento pepper. Put fresh parsley and used dried basil. Came out great!! I loved this dish and will make again.

My butter burned in the skillet on low heat which resulted in my cream sauce having black specks in it. I also thought the sauce was bland.

This was amazing. My husband LOVED this - said so 3 times since dinner tonight. I used the milk and breadcrumbs (seasoned whole wheat breadcrumbs) and BAKED the chicken instead of frying in the pan. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. Thanks!

A keeper. Served it for guest. They raved about it. I don't eat wheat so I used GF panko crumbs. I also used organic free range chicken strips and fried them in coconut oil.  Definitely make this again.

This is Delish!!!  I did bread the chicken differently (flour, egg, breadcrumbs) just to make sure the crumbs stuck - and they did!!  I also added mushrooms.  It was phenomenal :-).
I did make a stupid decision and I should know better!  After making the sauce I put the chicken back in the pan to coat it with the delicious sauce - stupid!  Even though my crust didn't come off, it lost it's crunchy goodness.  Oh well, it was great anyway.  thanks Emily

Made it low carb by substituting almond & flax meal for the bread crumbs.  Reduced the sodium by substituting water and Mrs Dash for the chicken broth. Still delish. Hmmmm.

Omg so good!  Skipped the pimentos and used a pre-spiced bread crumb, but kept it the same otherwise, and was blown away!  I've also used variations in other dishes.

Used dried basil instead of fresh, and was still good. Panko breadcrumbs much better than the usual flour-coated chicken breasts! Most similar sauces take a long time to thicken, but this one cooked up quickly.  Lots of sauce left over, will be great on leftover pasta.  Will definitely make again.

Amazingly delicious!  Those of you who are afraid of the heavy cream and are adding butter and half and half think again. Unlike the 1/2 & 1/2 heavy cream carries NO carbs 
and NO sugar. Stick with the yummy cream!

This is a favorite! I pound the chicken to about 1/4in, fry just to golden, then pop in the oven to finish cooking while I make the sauce. Always double the sauce! I deglaze the pan with white wine before adding the broth. I've made this with 1c cream, and also with 1/2c milk and 1/2c half and half, and it came out great both times. We don't like pimentos, so I often sub with a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes! Definitely use FRESH basil!

Loved this! A new way for me to prepare chicken, and I served with some angel hair pasta. Prepared exactly as written. Hubby doesn't like cream sauces and he liked it too. Will become a regular in our house.

Highly recommended! This is a wonderful recipe and I make it often. It's a simple and very tasty weeknight meal. I substitute the chicken breasts for chicken tenderloins and skip the pimentos. Thank you for sharing!

This is a great recipe. I sauteed some chopped onion and jalapeno and then added it to the cream sauce, added a little zip.

What a great sauce! I left out the pimentos, and added mushrooms that I cooked first in butter, salt & pepper, a little bit of lemon juice, and fresh Basil. So yummy!

This was really good. I added in a spinach green power blend and chopped it in the food processor in equal amounts to the basil to add in a nutrition punch for my friend battling cancer. She never eats her veggies but this is a great recipe for hiding in some spinach. Shhhh it's our little secret.

I cooked for 11 people and tripled the recipe.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before breaking them.  I added an extra 1/2 stick of butter after removing the chicken and took 1 medium sweet onion and sautéed it until onions are tender.  Then added the chicken soup and other ingredients as usual.  Instead of pimentos I used 1 large mild hatch green chile- from the can- chopped tiny. And 2 T. Of garlic.  I also cut sautéed mushrooms thin and in a separate pan in butter and garlic salt.  After the plates were set up I used the mushrooms on top of the chicken for decoration/ flavor!  So good!

My whole family loved this recipe! I doubled the sauce, using no salt butter, low-sodium broth and left out the pimentos. It was delicious!!!! We will definitely be making this again soon.

The basil was a bit too much for me personally, but everyone else thought it was great. The chicken was taking forever to cook so I cut it into little chunks and just mixed it with the sauce. Still tasted good.

Despite adding 4 cloves of small garlic and an onion to the sauce while cooking, the recipe as written turned out too bland. So I spiced it up by adding a half a tomato and two sprigs of fresh rosemary. After that, it was good, but this recipe takes a lot of additions to make it taste that way. My husband loved it and said he thought it came from an Italian restaurant.

We served it over zucchini noodles made to Alton Brown's specifications. They were the best part of the meal!

We didn't care for this. The sauce was okay, but the whole dish was just strange for us. I think it would be better if you just grill the chicken or even make real fried chicken and then make the sauce separately. Definitely didn't like the breading on the chicken cooked in the butter.

We have a family of 5, so to make it go further, I just cut the chicken into bite size pieces, breaded it and cooked it as the recipe suggests and then tossed it with the pasta! It was delicious!

This recipe was really good. I added garlic and red pepper flakes and the sauce was fantastic!  Think I'll try baking instead of frying next time bc I kept  having to add butter to the pan so the chicken would get done. I also want to add mushrooms as another reviewer recommended.

Fantastic.  Added grated onion when deglazing.  Used homemade seasoned breadcrumbs.  Did not use milk to dredge.  Instead I dipped in flour, then egg, and finally bread crumbs.  This recipe is really, really good!

This is very very good, delicious. Me and my girlfriend loved it, the sauce is very good and the breaded chicken goes well with it nicely. Will definitely be making this again and again, very good.
Medium heat was too hot to cook at on my stove so I turned it a bit lower than medium so you slow cook the chicken. Also be careful you pan isn't too hot when adding the broth as I made that mistake xD. I may also recommend putting the chicken on another pan or hotplate after finished to keep it nice and warm/hot, otherwise an awesome recipe.

One of my very favorite recipes. Do use fresh basil if possible. This is a restaurant quality dish that is sure to wow your guests. Even my husband who is not so much of a herb lover rates this dish 5 stars.

Fantastic!  Instead of pimento peppers, I stirred in some minced onion and garlic while deglazing the pan with the chicken broth.  Also, had a bottle of white wine open so I poured in a couple of tablespoons after the cream.  Got many rave reviews from the family!  Will definitely make this again!

I used the white wine as another did in place of the chicken broth, left out the pimentos and used light cream as well.  I also dipped into egg and then panko crumbs.  You really need to use the fresh basil.  It was delicious and we will have it again!

I loved this recipe!  The sauce has a wonderful flavor.  I used whole milk in place of the cream and added a bit of minced garlic.  I also coated the chicken with italian flavored bread crumbs.  I will definitely make this again!!

My husband really enjoyed this recipe but I found the sauce to be just ok. I've had better chicken dishes.  Unless I had all the ingredients on hand I wouldn't go out of my way to make this again.  The chicken tasted good but that was because I used my usual recipe for breaded chicken (dredge the chicken in flour and shake off excess, then dip into a beaten egg and coat with seasoned bread crumbs).

This recipe is delicious! The only thing I did was add salt to the chicken because it never said anything about salt. Bad idea. It came out a bit salty. Next time I will definitely do as directed and don't add salt. Oh and I added flour to the sauce only cause I thought it was a little to runny. Other that that did exactly as directed. Delicious!!!!

This is hands down one of my favorite recipes on here. Worthy of serving for guests. Added more cream for a bit more sauce. Kept chicken warm in 200 degree oven while cooking the sauce. Great easy side is boxed italian herb angel hair pasta. Served chicken over pasta and drizzled with sauce. YUM! Restaurant quality recipe! will make over and over.

I used half and half in place of heavy cream to reduce the calories in the recipe.  Next time I would pound the chicken breasts flat so they cook more quickly and evenly.

Made this for supper tonight and it was fantastic with some modifications. We didn't bread the chicken, just cooked with a little bit of evoo and lots of seasoning. Made a roux with flour and the leftover oil in the pan, then added broth, basil, tomatoes and garlic. Used half and half instead of heavy cream. Added lots k extra garlic and put in two big handfuls of fresh baby spinach before adding the chicken back in. It was so so good!!

I used garlic butter since i did not have any butter left. I think it added flavor to the chicken. I used flour to make the sauce thicker and added some salt to it as i found it was lacking some taste.

The taste is fantastic, but I wouldn't expect otherwise considering the fat content in this dish.  One thing to keep in mind is to serve the sauce IMMEDIATELY (make it as late as possible) because the longer it sits on the stove, it begins to somewhat evaporate and get rather clumpy.  If you keep that in mind, you will NOT be disappointed!

This was insanely good! Obviously the sauce is what made it extra special. I didn't add the pimentos because my family and I never eat them and I didn't have any on hand. Hubby said he will demand this twice a month. I made the recipe as is except I added some flour to the sauce to thicken it because it was way to soupy. Other then that it was perfect.

I THINK THIS IS A DELICIOUS SAUCE TO SERVE OVER CHICKEN, WHICH NEEDS A SAUCE BECAUSE CHICKEN WHITE MEAT CAN SOMETIMES BE DRY.  I USED CHICKEN CUTLETS BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE TENDER AND DON'T TAKE AS LONG TO COOK.  IT MADE ENOUGH SAUCE TO PUT OVER RICE OR NOODLES.  I JUST SERVED  MY HUSBAND AND I, AND IT ALLOWED ME TO HAVE PLENTY OF SAUCE TO HEAT UP FOR THE NEXT NIGHT.  THE SAUCE IS SO GOOD THAT THE SECOND TIME I MADE IT, I NEGLECTED TO BUY THE PIMENTO PEPPERS AND I MADE IT WITHOUT THEM AND IT WAS STILL A TASTY SAUCE.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS 5 STAR RECIPE.

Great flavor on this.  Using fresh basil really makes a difference.  I doubled the sauce and skipped the pimento peppers (family doesn't like them).  I've even made this with pork and it is always a hit.

My husband loved it, I thought it was OK. The chicken we used was a little thick so it was bland if you didn't smother it with the sauce. Next time I think I will add a little seasoning to the chicken before adding the breadcrumbs.

So delicious! I made some noodles to serve with it, and put the extra sauce on top. Also, I used Penzey's Spices Brady Street Cheese Sprinkle (about 1/3 cup) instead of the Parmesan cheese, and red peppers instead of pimento peppers. PERFECT!

Turned out pretty sweet.  I liked it a lot.  However I always seems to struggle with cooking things in butter as the butter starts to burn.  I may try EEVO next time, I also may add a little flour to the sauce next time to make it a bit thicker.  But the flavor was pretty good.

hmmm hmmm this was delicious!
i followed the recipe to a T however, i honestly not for 1 second considered using pimientos.
(i'll save those for my martinis;)
i sauteed red bell pepper instead.
AND i added crumbled up bacon!
hmm. hmmmm.
the bacon & fresh basil were the stars in this dinner!
tip: strain the drippings.
i actually could only use a tbspn or so. cuz the drippings were too burnt for my liking..

I usually don't take time to write a review, but this is just awesome. And just FYI, if you have a brown thumb like me, plant basil. Tastes great and even I can't kill it. ;)

This was very good!  We had it with brown rice and some veggies.  Since fresh basil is not available I used the Gourmet Garden basil in a squeeze tube, smells just like fresh!  Will be making this again for sure!

Very tasty.  but a few comments.  The breasts I bought were too large for the amount of milk and bread crumbs.  It took three times as much fat to brown both sides.  I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce.  The only change I made was to use italian bread crumbs and to finish it in the oven.

What a yummy surprise!!! Just when you think there are no more exciting ways to prepare chicken, you come up with this...I would definitely make it again. The only additions I made were to deglaze the pan with 1/2 a cup of Pinot Grigio added to the broth and 1 cup of roasted pine nuts. I will no longer shy away from creamy sauces when they are as good as this one was.

Wow, this recipe is amazing!  As good as the Olive Garden in my opinion.  The only change I made was to omit the pimentos and I used prepared pesto instead of basil.  The chicken was fantastic and the cream sauce wasn't too bland or too salty.  We had ours over angel hair pasta and that was a perfect pasta.  Can't wait to make again!

This was really good.  I made very few changes.  I sauteed garlic in the butter, breaded and then cooked the chicken for about ten minutes.  Pulled the chicken out and added the chicken broth (a little more then the recipe called for so I could have more sauce), basil, and black pepper. I added the chicken again and cooked it all the way through.  I wanted to use non fat Greek yogurt to cut back on fat and cholesterol, but it doesn't hold up when cooked so I added it to the sauce once it was removed from the heat.  I stirred that well and then spooned it over the chicken and whole wheat angel hair pasta. I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

So good!  Even my pickiest eater loved it!  B/c of my high cholesterol I substituted Fat Free evaporated milk and mixed in a little Fat Free half and half and the sauce tasted just as decadent as a true cream sauce.  Will definitely make this again.

Made this for my Roomie and he went Bonkers. Grilled chicken / 2% milk / lots of veggies - all easy ways of health'ing up this fabulous mail. I served it on a bed of egg'less noodle with a side of roasted Asparagus. Definitely putting this one in the rotation! #rayloves  #bookerRecipeBox

Excellent! I was so glad to find this! I made the following changes: used about 2 Tbsp. of butter, took out the browned bits (I didn't want those chunks in the sauce), and used regular whipping cream instead of heavy. Even with the changes it's delicious!! Thanks for posting this recipe!

Delicious! I agree, the sauce is fabulous. I didn't have pimentos so I substituted artichokes. I chopped them into small pieces and the flavor was amazing! I used fresh basil and I can't imagine the recipe without it. Basil adds such a distinctive flavor to this dish. Also, I didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used whole milk and it was just fine. I added a tad flour to thicken.. voila! Great dish!

This was simply D-Lish!  Everyone in my family loved it right down to the kids.  I omitted the pimentos but other wise stuck to the recipe.  I pounded the chicken breast to aid in cooking time and served over bow tie pasta (for the kids) with broccoli.  Will definitely make again and again!

Incredible!!! Before adding the cream, I sauteed 5 cloves of garlic (diced) in the pan. The chicken breasts from Trader Joe's were extra large so I divided them into cutlets otherwise I would have pounded them to an even thickness. I substituted red chili stuffed olives for the pimentos only because I didn't have them on hand. Worked out perfectly - a bit spicy but even my two year old kept eating it! I served it with steamed green beans and fresh bread. We had plenty of sauce left over; I didn't need to double the sauce. However, if I serve it over pasta I might consider doubling it.

This recipe has been a family favorite for nearly a decade!  I use thin-sliced chicken breasts to lessen cooking time and reduce risk of burning.  Double the sauce and let the cream reduce for a bit, or use cornstarch as the original Taste of Home recipe suggests.

Good recipe...I prepared bow-tie pasta and tossed it with the sauce.  I also browned the chicken as directed but then transferred to the oven to finish cooking so I could get the sauce going. Thanks!

Most balling out of control chicken dinner ever!  I added tonys and greek seasoning throughout while i was cooking.  I added jalapenos in the sauce at the end.  My wife said, "This is the best meal I have ever eaten and that you have cooked!!!"    ps: If you live in the south, add some crawfish to the sauce in the end!

This dish was great. Probably the best pan-fried chicken I've ever made, thanks to the crispy brown crust on the outside of the chicken. The cream sauce was awesome, even when using dried basil (my grocery store was out of fresh - weird - so I used 2 tsp dried). Will make again!

One of my favorite recipes ever...we always make this for company. Use Italian bread crumbs for the chicken...also, if you use chicken tenders or cut the breasts in half longways, it cooks more quickly. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

This was a good recipe and my family loved it and said it's a keeper!  I used 8 sliced mushrooms, 1 tsp. garlic powder and used fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  I had to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch due to the mushrooms, but it thicken really quickly.  I served it over linguine.  Next time I will use white wine instead of chicken broth and see if the flavor of the sauce is more pronounced.

The chicken itself sounded simple so I had to seasoned it myself with garlic and onion powder, salt, pepper and paprika. The sauce was easy to make, I used roasted red peppers instead of pimentos. The sauce was good but I didn't like how the sauce looked weird it had clumps and it wasn't as thick. Overall this dish was good, but not what I expected.

I didn't have the heavy cream so I used a cup of milk with 2 tbs of flour. I also didn't add the pimientos. It turned out great and I will make it on a regular basis. Thanks for something different.

This sauce has THE BEST FLAVOR!!! Fallowed the recipe exactly.  Now I am not a cooking expert but I do know how to simply read directions.  I don't know what went wrong but the sauce was super runny.  I figured just keep cooking and stirring and it will thicken... never did. Next I turned up the heat...  Still didn't thicken. So overall I would say deinately tastes great over chicken but over pasta I would've prefered it to be thicker.

This was a beautiful dish!!!  It wasn't too heavy nor light.  The basil cream sauce went great with the chicken. it also goes great with roasted tomatoes to balance the flavor.

This was really yummy! I made a few changes one on purpose, and one accidental! First, I purposely omitted the breadcrumbs and instead dredged the chicken breasts in milk and grated parmesan mixed with a little italian seasoning. Then fried up as the recipe states. Second, I accidently bought roasted red peppers instead of pimentos, but it was DELICIOUS and next time I will make this "accident" happen again! In the end, my kitchen smelled amazing, the husband raved, and the sauce was amazing over garlic steamed asparagus.

This recipe was OUTSTANDING :) so good! I did double the sauce using double of everything except I used 1 c. whipping cream w/ 1 cup lowfat milk. My chicken wasn't done in 10 mn. The breasts I used were large, so I baked them for an additonal 10 min. while I finished the sauce. This is great served w/ some egg noodles on the side & a veggie. **double the sauce, it's so good!**

This makes a delicious meal - for us - I cut the chicken up in chunks and made a lot of sauce so I could mix the chicken chunks with bow tie pasta and pour sauce over the whole thing.  I love using fresh basil and put more in plus garlic and onion.

THis recipe turned out amazing! Everyone I had over for dinner absolutel loved it. I had a few issues with it but I am thinking that might have been my fault. I didnt have grated parmesan so I used shredded instead which in the end made the sauce a little chunky because the parmesan didnt melt through, it was also a little runny for me at first but I added just a little bit of flour which took care of the problem, this might have been caused by the parmesan problem though. Overall, the dish turned out great!!

This was great, but made a few changes...  added a little red pepper to both the breading and the cream sauce... just needed a little kick. used about 3/4 cups of cheese and increased the chicken stock to 1.5 cups. served with farfalle pasta and broccli.. it was awesome... everyone loved it and I live in a house of picky eaters!

I really wanted to love this dish!  It is fairly simple and can be done on a weeknight without much fuss.  It smells delicious while it is cooking, but was a huge let down when prepared as directed.  The chicken was bland and though the sauce was beautiful, it wasn't enough to make up for the chicken.  I made it a second time because I thought I could make it better.  I tried seasoning the chicken and breadcrumbs and it still didn't live up to the amazing aroma created during cooking.  We'll be removing it from our recipe rotation - it just doesn't cut it!

Delicious sauce!! Hit with husband and preschooler!  Only modification was I used seasoned bread crumbs, just because that is what I had.  Definitely adding this to the permanent file, it was fast, easy, and delicious.

Really good, but I think it needed some garlic salt or regular salt. Also, it is a little time consuming. It took me longer than 15 minutes to cook the chicken and the sauce. The sauce had to be cooked a lot longer in order for it to thicken up a bit, but overall yummy!

I usually do not like to fry food because of the wasted oil.  But this recipe produces no waste!  The butter and juices used to fry the chicken become the cream sauce on top.

The cream sauce makes this recipe.  Without adding pasta to the intial dish, I has sauce leftover that worked wonderfully as a spread on sandwiches the next day.  Scrumptious!

yummy! I tried it for the first time but reading other reviews i decided to increase the amount of the sauce to put on some pasta and it was an instant hit with my friends =) awesome! The only thing is i would probably add a little salt to it to increase the flavours and bring it all out!

This was awesome!!  I doubled the sauce, and cut down on the chicken broth a little so that I could add some white wine.  Didn't have pimentos, but didn't miss them.

The cream base was definitely tasty, and I just tossed grilled chicken strips straight into the sauce before serving, but I was disappointed with how salty it turned out. I could've just added too much, but it was too salty. I'm going to try it again and not add any salt.

Super easy and good. I left out the pimentos and added a little of a cornstartch slurry to thicken the sauce. Other than that, as directed. Will be making often.

This was really good.  I had all the ingredients on hand except the pimento so I did not use.  I grow my own basil and have a lot to use up.  I also used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream for a healthier meal.  My kids really liked this one as well.  I served with brown rice and corn on the cob.  It's meals like these that are satisfying because you don't have to spend a lot of money on ingredients which saves money and they turn out so delicious.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe twice in the last few weeks. Once for my family and again for guest. It was a hit! I used fresh basil from the garden and added a little more than the recipe called for the second time around. Also made extra sauce the second time around due to everyone wanting to put it over thier rice and dip their bread in it. It really is a great recipe.

Very Tasty! I made a couple changes: I added mushrooms and scallions to the sauce as well as some extra cheese, pimentos, and salt. I also thickened the sauce with corn starch so it sticks better to pasta. Definitely a keeper: I'd order this in a restaurant.

One word: amazing! After making this for the first time today, it is already one of my favorites. The only thing I did differently was replace the pimento peppers with mushrooms. I accompanied this dish with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes & Asparagus Parmesan, both are recipes found on this site. It was a fabulous meal. Thanks so much for sharing!

Loved the sauce, and it was sooo easy!  Will make again and again.  I served w/ farfalle tossed in a little butter, milk and a sprinkling of parmesan and pepper.  Feels like a fancy restaurant meal, and would be great for guests.

great sauce, I didn't have any fresh basil on hand so I used 1 tablespoon of chopped basil (from supermarket refrigerated cabinet, just as good as fresh) also substituted 1/2 jar of roasted red capsicum (pepper) for the pimento. Have made this with full cream and also with light cream, fantastic either way

This was great even though I made it without the breading.  For a chicken in cream sauce I prefer the "Dijon-Tarragon Cream Chicken" on this site as it has a more robust flavor, but I love the cheese and basil on this one.

Made this tonight for myself, hubby and mom, and we all three agree it's a keeper.  I made it exactly as directed, and had plenty of sauce for drizzling over pasta, if I had wanted.  I served it with garlic smashed potatoes and fresh green beans.  I would be proud to serve this to anyone.  :)

I made this last month for a company dinner. I couldn't believe it would be as simple as it was, but needed something fast as I was in classes all morning, then had to come home and do up dinner for guests that night. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I chose to use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and to not bread them as I was trying for a similar taste to a frozen meal entree that I love. The fresh basil is heavenly! I'd never used pimentos in cooking, but they definitely are an important part of this dish. The sauce was perfect, not thin or runny. Everyone loved it and it looked as if I had worked furiously all day with just a few minutes of time! So great, it is being brought out again tonight for another guest dinner! Has definitely joined the family menu roster!

This was great and fairly easy. The only thing I did differently was to add 2 cloves of chopped garlic to the butter and sauted slightly before adding chicken. It was a nice change. My son-in-law said it looked like restaurant quality!

OMG!!! This was amazing! I made this for dinner tonight along with some mashed potatoes and fresh brocoli.  My hubby loved it.  I doubled the sauce to have enough for leftovers tomorrow.  The sauce was devine.  Thick and creamy.  I didn't substitute anything. Will definitely be making this again.  Also extremely easy to make even for the novice cook.

LOVED THIS!! and so easy!! I was really bummed because my fresh market was out of basil...but I had some dried at home.  Didnt expect a miracle with dried but followed recipe to a tea (except using thighs instead of breasts, boneless) and added 1 1/2 tsp of the dried basil.  It was wonderful!! I bet with fresh basil it will knock my socks off!! Also mine made plenty of sauce.. I added some bread to the meal to mop up the yummy sauce.  And the leftovers were great as well! Thanks for an easy, awesome recipe!! ****UPDATE 10/5/09***** I made this again, with fresh basil, but couldn't find pimentos this time, so i tried roasted red peppers.  It was AWESOME! I made it for friends and they raved about it.. and it's so EASY! TRY THIS RECIPE!!

I follwed the directions with the exception of the pimentos. The chicken came out great but the sauce was runny. I don't know where I went wronng? The taste was great just not the consistency. Next time I will incorporate the instructions for Chicken Cordon Bleu II, which I have made many many times, The consistency for this recipe is wonderful.

Loved it!  We only used two chicken breast but made the sauce for four - perfect amount.  I used italian bread crumbs and fresh basil from my garden.  Very tasty!  We will be sure to make this again.  Thanks Emily for a great, quick recipe!

I really liked this!  Sauce was a little thin for me but great flavor.  Very easy to make, everything in one pan!  Would make again.

This was a very big hit at my house and will definitely be made many more times.  This first time, I followed directions exactly.  I think next time I may try some variations.  I would like to try with no pimentos for a more enhanced basil flavor, and I would like to cook the sauce with the basil in it a little bit longer as I didn't get quite as much basil flavor out of the dish as I would have preferred.  The breaded chicken alone was so delicious in this dish.  All around a new family favorite.

I expected my kids to say "ew we aren't eating that" but to my suprise they dug in and said it was soooo good and asked if they could have the left overs for lunch the next day! I thought it was ok. Nice for company but quick enough for a week night meal. If I make again I might try a blend of cheeses as others recommended.

Followed the recipe exactly and loved it! My husband said it was good, he's not much into white sauces.  So, I think the next time, I'll try in on some of the breaded chicken patties you get at the store to save time.

This was excellent.  Only change I made was using fresh terragon in place of the basil only because the grocery was out of basil.  We will definitely be having this again!

Yum! I had never really cooked w/ pimientos before, so I almost left them out, but I am so glad I didn't! They really add a great flavor that I was not expecting. I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and double sauce, and it was scrumptious!!!

This makes a very tasty dish.  I served with rice and a vegie.  The cooking time for the chicken breasts is ridiculously short. No way you can cook in 10 minutes unless you use chicken tenders or pounded breasts.

So delicious!  Didn't make it with the pimentos and used a LOT of fresh basil and it was absolutely wonderful.  Added a little rosemary and dill to the bread crumbs for some more flavor.  Will be making this one again and again!!

Absolutely Fabulous! Everyone in my family loved this. Hubby worked late, and it reheated well too! I didn't have the pimento...but it wasn't missed. On the list to make again soon.

This is an excellent dish. My husband and I both loved it. I had cooked chicken breasts left over, so the next evening, I cut it into bite-size pieces, made extra sauce, thickened with corn starch, and served it over angel hair pasta. It was GREAT!

When I cooked this I had the pot too hot so the bread crumbs burned in an instant.  I would recommend using thinner strips of chicken and a lower fire

This recipe is FABULOUS!  My husband and I have made many dishes from this site and this is the first I just had to comment on.  We made it exactly as written, minus the pimientos.  Next time, we will double the sauce so we have plenty to pour on our angel hair pasta.  Yum!

This was really good. I made a couple changes- I used half & half instead of cream, and used some corn starch to thicken it up. I also used dried basil- I think it would taste better with fresh. I used hot pimento peppers, and I think sweet pimento peppers would be better because the spiciness cuts the flavor.

Good chicken recipe.  However, the cream sauce tasted a bit like cream of mushroom soup to me.....it's basically the same flavor.  Just add your basil and cheese on top and you got it.  I will make again.  Oh, and definitely follow others advice and double the sauce.

Very good! I made some modifications to suit my own taste of course. I decided to forgo the breading on the chicken and to tell you the truth the sauce can stand alone without the additional labor (and fat). I just used chicken breasts halved and cooked in a pan with olive oil. I also couldn't find pimentos, so used roasted red peppers instead.

Very good, raves from the family.  I did not use fresh basil...and had to use dried 1 TBSP.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious! Restaurant quality.   Doubled the amounts for the sauce and put it over pasta.  I was nervous about the flavor of the pimentos, but it was exactly the right ingredient.  Who ever came up with this really has a nack for cooking and how ingredients relate.  We loved it--Easy and DELICIOUS

Very simple to make, and very good.  I am not the best cook in the world, and usually destroy the most simple recipe.  But this was quick, easy, and made my guests think I actually new what I was doing in the kitchen.

Followed this recipe exactly and it was absolutely wonderful.  the pimentos and the Basil gave it such an incredible flavor.  Tastes like something you would get at a restaurant.  Next time I will pound my chicken thin as the breasts i had were extremely thick and I had to put them in the oven for a while to cook. (in order to prevent burning)  Served with asparagus and crescent rolls!

SO GOOD.  Will make again.  Made some minor changes to spice it up.  Added some chili powder to the seasoned bread crumb mixture.  Sauted 2 cloves garlic and 1 large jalepeno pepper (both chopped) in the pan before adding the chicken broth.  I then omitted the pimento and doubled the sauce to have with pasta.  Good enough to share.

I used seasoned bread crumbs and added some garlic salt.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it came out dee-lish!  Boyfriend wanted more sauce so I'll double up next time.

Wonderful! I used pork chops, they were so delicious. However, I was disappointed that the sauce was so thin. I thickened it up with flour and poured over noodles. The taste is great.

The best chicken dish i made in a long time. Husband and 3 kids loved it. Sauce was easy and delicious, i doubled it and put it over egg noodles. Chicken was so good, i used tenders because that is what i had and it was perfect. Will make often.

Very good! I used light cream instead of heavy cream and added some sauteed some mushrooms, onions and garlic to the sauce with the pimientos. I doubled the sauce and poured over chicken and bowties. Easy and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

5 stars and Thumbs Up!!  Great Recipe as is.  I added fresh garlic to the sauce for my families taste, but I add garlic to everything.  Can't wait to make for the inlaws.  Easy and great tasting!

Wow! This recipe was really something! I used egg instead of milk and also pounded the chicken flat. I sauteed a clove of garlic with the butter before adding the chicken. I also doubled the sauce recipe and added a clove of garlic to the sauce as well. The only other change I made was adding some white wine to the sauce and also about four white mushrooms sliced. I think they were positive additions. My boyfriend LOVED this and took the leftovers to work for lunch. He has never done that before. This recipe was restaurant quality. I served it over fresh egg noodles and with a side of green beans using the "zesty white wine green bean" recipe on this sight. ENJOY!!!

I guess I'm reviewer #176 to say that this is a restaurant quality dish!  I had a jar of roasted red peppers that I cut into strips as the pimentos.  This was especially easy to prepare on a weeknight after work, if you have all the ingredients.  The flavor of the dish is perfect and we laid it on a bed of speghetti which seems to "go" with the sauce.  I love the sauce so much that I would double it.  It's a cream sauce, you can't get enough of it.  I would even add a touch more fresh basil because the flavor is just so wonderful in this dish.  My husband told me I should give this 142 stars. Our 25 and 18 year old thought it was excellent also, and they are, um, "particular".  Thanks for another keeper!

I don't usually agree with the high reviews given to some of the dishes on this site. This is the exception, the cream sauce was amazing, and the chicken was tender and juicy. I followed the directions exactly except I didn't add pimentos (didnt have any). Great recipe, will be cooking it again.

I've never been a huge fan of chicken breasts, but this recipe really gave the chicken flavor! I served it over angel hair pasta and substituted the pimentos with green peppers. I also served sauteed zuchinnis as a side dish. All-in-all, a wonderful dish! Thanks for sharing!

I loved the flavor of this dish and served over farfalle (bowtie) pasta. It was a first using pimentos and I was very pleased! The flavor is very rich - so much so that I may try offsetting the richness with 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream.  Still a great choice!!!

Awesome!  This is a definite keeper for our family - so easy and quick to make, I followed the recipe exactly, but per some other reviewers, may add in some garlic and white wine next time!  This looks so gourmet served with some brown rice and a green veggie - perfect for guests!

This is awesome.  In order to make this slightly less unhealthy, I used half and half instead of whipping cream and also fat free milk. I did not notice any lack of flavor.  Basil is one of my favorite herbs so this is a win for me.

This was very tasty! I didn't expect it to be this good! It's real simple too! I didn't have pimentos, but I don't see how they would make it much better except for color. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and used Italian breadcrumbs. I served it over spaghetti. This recipe is a keeper!!

This was pretty good... I didn't have pimentos so I used a bag of sun-dried tomatoes and also half and half cream instead of heavy cream.  The taste of fresh basil was very good and I served this over farfalle.  Next time I will probably stick to the chicken milano recipes from this site

Delicious!!  My husband says the recipe is "restaurant quality".  I didn't have pimentos on hand so I used about 1/2 c of chopped sundried tomatoes (from a jar) and I doubled the sauce.  I also flattened the chicken breasts as others have, it really helps them cook quickly and evenly.

This has become my college kids most requested meal when they come home.  It is so simple, really, and yet tastes like fine dining.  I serve it with capellini and green beans.  So yummy.

Our family loved this recipe.  And best of all, it was very easy to make.  This is the kind of dish you might expect to be served at a restaruant.  Try impressing  dinner guests with this one.

This was fantastic! Next time I would pound the chicken so that it cooks more evenly. Be careful not to put the sauce on too high. I served it over a little bit of pasta. The longer it stands the thicker the sauce becomes. I couldn't find just pimientos so if you didn't know roasted red peppers are the same and i cut them very thin so not to over power the basil. I saw some people added garlic, I forgot until the last minute so I added a little bit of garlic powder and it was great.

FANTASTIC, a new house favorite, I cant say enough about how good this is. However, I also doubled the sauce and served over pasta, and after the chicken was done I cooked some green onions & garlic before adding broth, to thicken double (about) the cheese. enjoy.

I made this for my boyfriend a few nights ago and he can't stop talking about how good it was.  This is definitely a keeper for my collection!! I made the recipe as directed except I omitted the pimentos completely, used seasoned bread crumbs, added a little garlic pepper and salt to the cream mixture for added taste, and addded additonal parmesan cheese to make the sauce thicker.  I served the chicken over angel hair pasta and topped with the cream sauce and it looked as beautiful as it tasted and smelled, however, next time I will double the sauce so there is plenty to go with the pasta.  Add a nice green salad on the side and some garlic bread for a complete meal.

Very good.  I used thin pork cutlets instead of chicken and I didn't have the pimento peppers, other than that I followed the recipe. This is a keeper! Thanks

This had wonderful flavor. The factor that didn't make it a "5" was the lack of THICKNESS in the sauce. Will definately make again and thicken the sauce up a bit...maybe add a bit more cheese. Otherwise, delicious!

My husband loved this recipe and so did my 1 year old!  My husband said it's definitely one of the best things I've made and I've made plenty of stuff.  I did use just half of the pimiento and added corn starch as well.  I made mashed potatoes and rice a roni and made my husband choose which one he wanted.  He chose the mashed potatoes.  I also served it with broccoli, but I think I will serve it with asparagus next time.  Definitely a keeper.

I really enjoyed this dish, my picky husband ate the chicken w/o the sauce. I did use thin sliced chicken breasts, and kept the first batch warm in the oven while working on the second. I added a little more pepper and I used light cream. Next time I think I will use a little less cheese. Very good.

Oh my, was this ever yummy! I fried the chicken in canola oil, used only 2 TBSP butter, which I added when I warmed the cream, and used fat free cream. This cut some of the fat and cholesterol, but the chicken was STILL oh so yummy! I used seasoned bread crumbs and passed on the pimento, since none of my family cares for it. I served with potato panckes, which were GREAT with the cream basil sauce! The fresh basil was sweet and fragrant! Yum! Thank you Emily!

This was quick and good. The only thing I did differently is I left out the Pimento Peppers, seasoned the bread crumbs and used dried Basil. Other than that I followed the recipe to the T. My husband loved the texture. I'm going to have to try it with fresh Basil. I'm sure it will be a 5 with that.

I hedged between 4 and 5 stars, but gave it five to fair since I made some adjustments.  I used light cream instead of heavy, and I used dried basil since I didn't have fresh.  This was so good!  Can only imagine if I went by the exact recipe.  One hint~  Make sure your chicken breasts are completely thawed and not too thick.  I had a problem getting them evenly cooked because mine weren't thawed which kind of affected the recipe.  Stil, SO good!

This os one of the best basil recipies I have ever tried. I have used the sauce with both chicken and shrimp. Though I did cheat a little, I fried come chicken fat before I made the sauce to add that extra little flavor. 
It will make growing all of that basil so much more rewarding!

I had to thicken the sauce with 1 T cornstarch to 2 T water, but only added 1/2 that mixture and it was thick enough. My husband loved this and declared it a keeper, I thought it needed a little something but not sure what.
