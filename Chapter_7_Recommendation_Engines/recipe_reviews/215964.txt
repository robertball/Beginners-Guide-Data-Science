I gave this to my husband to make since we had peppers to use up.  He did a wonderful job! We both loved it.  Will make this instead of my old grn pepper recipe.  We had no Classico on hand, so we substituted another brand.

The stuffing was very tasty, which was good because that was all that we could eat!!!  I didn't know, and the recipe didn't say to par boil the peppers, so lesson learned.  Next time I will be cooking the peppers for about 10 minutes, then stuff and bake.

Great tasting filling and easy to make.   However, at 325 my peppers were still hard after 40 min.  My husband took 2 bites and then made himself a salad.  Next time I'll precook the peppers.

I thought these tasted great. They were easy to make. I used turkey meat instead of hamb meat, and I topped the bell peppers off with mozzarella cheese.

Wonderful! I cooked without the stewed tomatoes and Classico Tomato Sauce and it taste delicious! I shredded 1 carrot into the stuffing mix and used cooked rice. :D
