I loved the idea of the "Crab Louis" style of this and looked forward to this twist with the orzo. Unfortunately, I was let down. While this was edibible,  it certainly wasn't memorable. I tasted too much of the peppers and not enough of the dressing. Overall, the salad was rather nondescript, not exactly bursting with flavor, though it IS pretty and colorful.  I used fresh lump crab meat and, since it is expensive, regret that I used it in a dish that was "just okay."

I thought this was great.  We had lump crab from Trader Joes (the canned kind) and decided to use it for this salad.  The only difference I made was to add 1.5 tsp more of the chili powder and more lemon juice, about 1 T more.  You can adjust the dressing to your taste while keeping the mayo amount the same.  We loved this!  Made it twice.  Oh and on one occasion, we added a little bit of corn kernals.  Another great addition is to add some Old Bay Seasoning.  My husband preferred it this way.

A great idea but a little too "crabby" for my taste.  If you like a seafood "cocktail" kind of taste, this one's for you.  Might be better served over fresh greens, maybe with some cold boiled shrimp and sliced tomatoes on the side?

This is a tasty and refreshing salad.  Easy to prepare and delicious.  When I make this again, I will use slightly less green onion and I will add a pinch of Old Bay seasoning.  It is great as is, though!

Made with Heinen's cooked lobster meat because they didn't have crab.  Added Old Bay as reviewers suggested.  Used 2x the lemon juice called for and more hot sauce.  Very good!  Served with deviled eggs, pickled asparagus, my refrigerator pickles, and Franciscan Chardonnay.  Great summertime dinner.  345 calories per serving as I made it.

we added enough pasta to have a decent coverage with the sauce, we needed to add more pasta because we prefer a drier salad.  taste and texture were good.  we added some shopped celery the second time we made it just because we had some available.

this salad is fantastic. Since I'm not a fan of red/green peppers I omitted them from the salad but added diced avacado. I served it on a bed of lettuce...so good..I loved the little bit of kick in the dressing..It's definitely a keeper....

Usually I make recipe as written and then if I want, make my own changes.  However with this one, absolutely nothing will be altered.  Great recipe!

We enjoyed this bright and colorful summer salad, but while tasty there really wasn't anything that stood out.  Fresh, but forget-able.

Loved this recipe. Very easy. Tastes great. I only had imitation crab and it worked perfectly. Definitely adding this to the summer dinner rotation.

Delicious! We made this, almost exactly following the recipe. Rather than use real crab, we decided to opt for imitation because we personally like the flavor more. Also, we used Sriracha, about a full tablespoon, and omitted salt. Even my 3 year old, who hates fish, absolutely loves this!
