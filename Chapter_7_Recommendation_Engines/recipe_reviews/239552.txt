This was made according to recipe and it's simply delicious! In my opinion, if it's altered, it needs to be submitted under another name because it's a different recipe.

Oh my this is good! My second pie for Pi Day 2015. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and omitted the nuts, mine baked in 50 minutes at 350 degrees. Served with vanilla bean ice cream and a chocolate caramel drizzle with strawberries on the side.

This has been one of the traditional pies served at my family's Thanksgiving for years.  It's a simple recipe to modify as well.  I've added extra spices sometimes.  I've also made it with caramel bits instead of chocolate chips, cardamom, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt to finish off the top of it and my friends have gone crazy for it.

Yummy!  If you love chocolate chip cookies this pie is for you.   I added 1/4 tsp. salt to balance the sweetness.   It's a keeper!

Huge hit at my dinner party!  I added 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  I plan to make this again and again.  It comes together really easily.  Serve with vanilla ice cream.

Made this one and it was fantastic!  Just wondering if anyone has tried mixing all the ingredients and holding off baking it for an hour or two?  I'd like to serve it warm after dinner, but don't want to be rushing to get it mixed up and in the oven, just as I'm finishing the dinner prep.  Thanks.

My adult son and little grandson made this at Christmas time.  Probably not as good as it should have been, but not bad for first timers.

Baked mine at 350. Added a dash of cinnamon nutmeg and cardamom and voila what a good pie. Perfect amount of sweetness. Have it while warm with some delish home made whipped cream.

I omitted the nuts. After chilling this and topping with whipped cream, it is wonderful! I tasted this warm from the oven, and did not like it that way at all. It seems to thicken after cooling and the flavors are much better that way.

I make this recipe quite a bit as it is one of my husband's favorite. Sometimes I add butterscotch chips or switch out for dark chocolate chips.  Both are yummy as is the original recipe.

One of my family's favorite desserts.  Often requested by others as well.  I make it as is and sometimes modify depending on where it is going and the time of the year.  It is rich.  Yum!
