We have just finished this stew, I was going to take a picture but it didn't last long enough for that! I took other reviewers advice and added spices. I added about two tablespoons of rosemary, a tsp of garlic, tsp of parsley, salt and pepper, a teeeny sprinkle of thyme and a half teaspoon of italian seasoning.Thank you for the recipe :)

Oh also...I kinda started it wrong. I cooked the meat as said, and then I put it in water with four oxo cubes...then let it all soak for about an hr on low heat since I was cooking it on the stove. then I added my potatoes I used baby new potatoes so I didn't have to peel (ha!) then I mixed the tomato paste with some water and another oxo cube, then added it to the stew then finally added the can of beer.

Will defo...DEFO be making this again. Thank you again!

My family loves this recipe. I've found that some rosemary garlic seasoning really pulls it all together and gives it a great flavor.  The only other change I make is slow cooking it on the stove.  It makes the whole house smell great on a cold winter's day.

This was a great stew but as others said, needed some spicing. Only change was I added the tomatoe paste to the skillet used to brown the beef for 20 secs to get rid of the tinny taste and then added the beef broth and deglazed the skillet. Pour into crock pot.

I felt that the recipe didn't have enough liquids.  I added two cups broth.  I also reduced the stout to six ounces as I had some very strong tasting beer.  The result was a very mild and delicious broth with just the right amount of stout taste.  It was very good.

I made this in the slow cooker on high for 6 hours and it was delicious. Easy and simple the way Irish stew should be - no need for fancy ingrediants.  I follwed the recipe exactly except that I added 1 cup of fresh mushrooms when there was about 2 hours of cooking time left.

It was a great recipe but, the stout beer was way to stout for my family. Gave it a wangy taste that my kids didnt enjoy much at all.

Fabulous recipe.  I served this with garlic mashed potatoes lining the bowl (just like my local Irish pub serves it), and it was absolutely delicious.

It was good. I added salt, pepper, and seasoning salt to it, but that is just because we like salty food. I will definitely make again. My cousin wanted the recipe so he could hand it out to everyone. I served it with home-made sourdough bread, although wheat bread would be good. Would also be outstanding in bread bowls.

Really great stew, however transformed it more into a french stew by replacing the beer with red wine, and adding parsley. Also I took out veggies and meat at the end, placed it in a serving dish and then boiled down/thickened the remaining liquid to pour over the stew.  Delicious.

I made this recipe, using ingredients called for, except that I wasn't able to buy one bottle of Guinness. Had to buy the whole 6 pack. So I used a lager instead. It tasted horrible!!! I doctored it up with spices, even salsa. We did not care for this. I'll go back to making it with wine and red potatoes, spices. Major disappointment on St. Patrick's Day!!

I finely chopped a bit of bacon, browned it, and removed to brown the beef in the bacon drippings.  And I used about 3 TBS tomato paste.  I brought to a simmer on the stovetop and then cooked in 350-degree oven for about 2 hours.  My stew was very thick without the cornstarch, and I don't care for that texture in my soupts and stews, so I omitted.  It was so thick that I actually needed to add a splash more beef broth, and I also added a splash of Guinness (just to reinforce the flavor a bit) and some frozen peas when I removed from the heat.  Oh, and to make sure the stew wasn't bitter from the Guinness, I added about a TBS of minced raisins before putting in the oven.  It may not be traditional, but it's perfect for us  and very good on a cold rainy day.

This was pretty good, and a nice change from Corned Beef and Cabbage (which I personally can't stand) for St Patrick's Day. It really wasn't anything special though - it just tasted like beef stew to me. It really needs some seasoning though. Salt and pepper and probably something else too (can't think of what.) I'd make it again, and my (Irish-American) fiance liked it, so 4 stars.

This was pretty good, the stout soaked into the meat reaaaaal nicely.  Does need some kind of salt or spice, though.  I forgot to add the cornstarch and water at the end but it turned out nice and thick anyway.

This stew is delicious! We didn't have any Guinness on hand, so we just used extra beef broth. I followed the suggestion of many reviewers and added parsley, italian seasoning, and thyme. My husband is in love with this stew!

A pretty standard stew, but the tomato paste and beer add a nice twang.  Definitely needs salt and pepper.  Served mine in "Bread bowls" from this site on St. Patty's day and everyone loved it.  Bonus:  There are five beers left over to help you wash it down. Since it's in the sauce, it pairs well.

My three year old had three helpings of this! I used Newcastle ale since that's what we had in the house. I also opted to cook this on the stove top because I got caught up doing laundry in the morning and didn't get it started in time to make it in the slow cooker.

Very good and easy.  Followed recipe to the letter, except I only used 5 potatoes because I was running out of room in the crockpot.  Dipped with crusty bread.  My 3 year old son loved it!

just made a pot,very good and tasty!i used what i had on hand. i sub'd tomato sauce i just made for spaghetti a few days ago for tomato paste,probably a little short on beef as i ate some a day ago,was a organic grass fed chuck roast cow,i used a bottle of O.V. for the beer,my potatoes were probably medium sized,i guessed on the carrots,i used the biggest onion i had which was probably a good medium. the beer makes it! was great smelling while cooking. i brought to a boil and turned down to a simmer until i could pierce the vegetables with a fork then let sit flame off for a while and ate 2 bowls &  with 2 slices of whole wheat bread, delicious,my pot was pretty filled up so will last a few days i'm sure.i seared the beef 1st with flour coating then added it and finish cooking with the rest,trim as much fat as you can off the beef so you dont have a slick on the surface. turned out great,the liquid did'nt thicken up enuff but is good to drink like soup. also i used chicken broth as i did'nt have beef.

I made this for a St. Patricks Day luncheon at work and only change I made was adding cabbage.   I cooked it all night in my roaster and the next morning it was perfect!   Everyone at work raved about this recipe and I went home for the first time (non dessert wise) with an empty pan!   Thanks for sharing.

I made some changes though.

1) I didn't have any stout (apparently I got drunk last night.) but I did have a bottle of Red Hook Audible.  (Slightly hoppy lighter ale.)

2) I don't peel potatoes.  I like the peels, and it seems pointless/wasteful.  I cut them into thick slices.

3) I doubled the broth.(On accident.  Slightly hung over.)

4) I made a dark roux instead of using cornstarch.  This gave it a slight roasted nutty flavor.  I added this about an hour prior to finish.

5) I put a dash of liquid smoke in there. 

The stew came out awesome.  I cooked it for 6 hours on high in the crock pot.  The changes I made, like all changes, were due to preference and necessity.  Many times when I am looking for a recipe, I don't want to run to the store and so I make substitutions.  I think the spirit of the recipe remained intact, and this stew has a strong spirit indeed.

I made this for a St. Patty's Day party this weekend and it was great.  I used a bottle of Newcastle...just personal preference, as I don't like Guinness.  Definitely do not be afraid to add your own seasonings...it needs it.  After some salt, pepper, parsley, rosemary and a little garlic powder it tasted fantastic.  Thanks!

I made this last year for st. patty's day Wow one of the best stews i have ever made and had!!!! My friend is from Liverpool, England and would go to Ireland frequently, he said the meal tasted homely. I said is that good or bad because in America homely is bad. He laughed and said no it tastes like something my mum would make. :)

I'm not sure how this has so many good ratings. It had absolutely no flavor. I ended up taking it out of the slow cooker and putting it on the stove for an hour just so I could take my time adding spices to make it edible. I ended up adding a cup and a half of red wine also because there wasn't nearly enough broth for the amount of meat and vegetables there.

wonderful recipe! note to people who have yet to try this, looks can be deceiving because frankly this is likely to be one of the best stews you will eat. i added more vegetables than the recipe called for like corn, peas, carrots, and celery. i also added red pepper flakes and rosemary to spice it up a bit. the only thing i changed was the amount of beer in the recipe. i used about half less. will be making this again :) :) :)

Guinness from a bottle or can usually seems to have a bit of a metallic taste which comes through in the finished stew.  If I make this type of stew again, I will try using another beer, probably a Left Hand Milk Stout.

FANTASTIC recipe!!!  Was extremely tasty and the consistency was fabulous.  I did add some celery and mushrooms as well (just a personal preference) as well as a bit of salt & pepper.  Thank you so much for posting this wonderful recipe :)

So easy to make and delicious.  Did not need cornstarch to thicken. Did need to add spices to help with flavor.  Will make again.

This stew was just OK--nothing exceptional.  I brought it to a potluck and only half was eaten.  My husband also wasn't crazy about this stew.

I'm not sure what went wrong where, but I had the entire recipe cooking for over 12 hrs and the potatoes, and even some of the onions just WOULD NOT COOK. 
Maybe that was more my cookers fault, but still. Despite delicious gravy (Which I spiced up with garlic poweder, pepper, salt, seasoning salt, and cajun seasoning), I think I'll try for a casserole bake next time.

I made this stew for dinner tonight, and it was absolutely delicious! I had second thoughts as I was putting it together and realized there were no spices! I used tenderizer on the meat and a little salt and pepper but other than that I made as directed.  Tastes great! Only thing I'd change is possibly adding a little more broth, but it was a nice thick hearty stew.  And the meat was very tender.  Great recipe, thanks!

This was a great stew, very easy to prepare which what I was looking for on St.Patty's day morning. It was a big hit with the guys, meat was super tender. I thought it was lacking in flavor, it needed spicing up. Salt, pepper, herbs are definite simple but necessary additions to make this even better. I also added celery. Not greasy at all, not sure if other reviewers are using too much oil and/or are pouring the meat with the oil into the crockpot? I will make again but with more spices.

Awesome recipe.  This stew, for you Southerners, is fabulous with southern style cornbread.  Also, reserve some of the broth in which to dip or crumble the cornbread for a late evening snack.  The beer really makes the difference.

Very good stew!  I cooked mine 6 hrs in a crock pot on high.  I thought it was a tinsy bit mushy, but that could have just been the way I cooked it.  The meat was delicious and the guinness really added to the flavor.  I added about a 1/3 head of cabbage and some salt/pepper. Mine was almost a little bland.  I couldn't imagine eating it without a little seasoning.  Overall? Great!

I made this stew for St. Paddy's Day, and it went over very well...we had no left-overs, and even my 2 1/2 year old loved it. I will definitely make it again, although next time I will add salt and pepper.

This is the first time I ever made Irish stew, followed  the recipe exactly and it came out  great.  Had some Guinness so what better for an Irish Strew. Didn't have to add the corn starch, just needed a little more seasoning.  Used some McCormick  Montreal steak seasoning and parsley, salt and pepper. Will make again.

It was good but I found the tomato paste a little overwhelming. I added 2 tsps of Worcester sauce. Next time I will add more beef broth and a bit more of the Guinness.

I fixed this yesterday for my husband.  It filled my 6 quart slow cooker full.  It was so hearty and tasty.  I had  nearly 3 quarts left over and took some to a neighbor and put some in the freezer (for our college kid).  Both my husband and the neighbor loved it.  This is for sure a keeper and will be cooked several times over the cooler weather. One thing.. next time I am going to add some peas to it for extra veggies.

The stew was awesome. I found that I didn't need the cornstarch though, the thickness was perfect. I did add some oil from my preserved jalapeno picks that gave it a bit of bite and made it a family hit!

I used this recipe for the first time this year as I REALLY wanted Irish Stew.  A church here sells homemade Irish Stew and I just couldn't get there during their hours.  I didn't think I could ever make it as good as theirs.  But this recipe was IT!  The only thing I did different was use a 1 lb. bag of baby carrots to save time.

I found the recipe greasy.  Next time I'll make it the day before, refrigerate, remove hardened grease, then add the cornstarch when reheating.  I also added some salt and pepper, thyme, and worchestershire sauce.

Pretty good! I had every intention of making an "Irish" meal on St. Paddy's Day, but.... Unfortunately, I had no "steam" this week (I had a few VERY early mornings, and from what I know about myself, I am just NOT a morning person lol!). I FINALLY got around to prepping everything by Fri., so I made this last night. While my fiance & I both enjoyed this, I do think I prefer my stand-by stew recipe a little better. You know, just the basics - a little red wine, a LOT of herbs, potatoes, carrots, celery, peas, etc.  Having said that, we both enjoyed the tang from the beer (used Guinness stout) & found this to be very authentic. There are quite a few Irish stew recipes on here that "claim" authenticity, but unless Irish beer is one of the ingredients, I just don't feel it is. To be a little different, I omitted the potatoes from my stew & instead, served over mashed ones. I used more carrots & an EXTRA lg. onion & upped the amt. of meat slightly to compensate. I followed Mayelle's sugg. and add. 1 1/2 T (all I had left) dried rosemary, a t of dried parsley, 1/2 t Italian seasoning, a pinch of thyme, fresh ground pepper (to taste) & a t of garlic powder (I'm not sure if Mayelle add. fresh + powder or only 1 t fresh, so I add. both!). I did not salt since I add. ~ 1 t seasoned salt to my flour. Served w/ fresh baked crusty caraway rye bread (from my grocer's bakery) & stout to wash it all down...mmmm.... Thx. for sharing! :-)

This is an awesome recipe.  Took it to a work function and had none left over!  Only thing I added to the recipe was a few dashes of rosemary, thyme and pepper.  Delicious!

Really enjoyed this stew as part of our St. Patrick's Day/Spring Break in the Mountains celebration! Just might consider making it a tradition!

I rated this 3 stars because we ate it but no one loved it.  I followed the suggestion of Mayelle to give it more flavor, but 2 tablespoons of rosemary is way to much. Everything else blended nicely.  If I made this again I would cut the rosemary down.

All I can say is 'WOW'! I love being able to use my crockpot for times when we have potlucks at work. Today is St. Patrick's Day and another gal in the office always makes a fabulous corned beef with cabbage, potatoes & carrots - so, I always try to find something that fits the theme while being different. This was it - and, is it ever good! With all the food we had, I saw people going back for seconds and, to me, that's the ultimate compliment! The only thing I'll add next time is a touch of salt. Otherwise, it's very good!

This stew is very good! My family loved it! The Irish beer added great flavor, as did the tomato paste. My only problem with this stew is the high cal and fat. It's a very heavy stew and you can feel those 26.6 g of fat after eating it. But it is worth the taste!

I followed this recipe as is, with the exception of adding some parsley as I saw in other Iris Stew Recipes. The londer it cooks in the crokpot the more tender the beef and vegetabes (at least 10 hours). I served at a party. Everyone really enjoyed. It is better the next day! I added salt to mine as I think it needed a little flavor boost. I would make again for the holiday. It does taste a little different than a traditional American beef stew. oh - I did use Guinness Beer - it is Irish Stew after all!!

This was my first slow cooker recipe so, I was a little nervous.  It was so easy and the beer made a nice unique taste.  I ended up using only 5 potato's.  I would not have had enough room!

Totally authentic! Tastes just like the Irish Stew we ate at the Bleeding Horse in Dublin, Ireland. Added 1tsp of rosemary, 2tsp of Worcestershire Sauce and seasoned the beef with salt and pepper when coating it with the flour.  I also added an additional 1 cup of Beef Broth because it was too thick, as well as a Knorr Beef Stock tub.

I found that my slow cooker wouldn't hold all the veggies in the recipe. I used half the potato's & half the carrots. Everything else stayed the same. Absolutely amazing!!!! This dish is my new St. Patty's Day tradition!!!!!

First time trying a slow cook recipe, and it was so easy to do, and tasted amazing. Although I didn't use Guinness as it said. Instead I tried a bottle of Kona Brewing Company's Pipeline Porter, and it was still a huge hit.

It is still simmering but I can tell already that it will be a big hit tomorrow for our St. Patty lunch.  I didnt really measure out the veggies or the meat but I have a nice big pot and it tastes wonderful.  I used venison instead of beef - that might not be very Irish but that is okay because we are not Irish either :-)  Thanks for sharing.

Spectactular! I just made this for St. Patty's day and both my mom and husband loved it! I only made 2 changes: 1) I added two chopped parsnips 2) I didn't bother with the corn startch and water, as the stew thickened quite nicely without it.

This is delicious.  I tend to mess with the recipes just a little . . .I added a couple handfuls of dry beans/lentil mix, cabbage, fresh mushrooms and doubled the beer content.  I didn't have beef broth so I used a packet of beef seasoning with 2 cups of water.  The result was a very rich and well seasoned broth.  Will make again!

This was great. It is worth the extra few steps to brown the meat prior to crock potting.  Only changes I made was to saute the onion and garlic before searing the beef and used 4 potatoes instead of 6 as my crockpot was getting full. Lastly. I didn't have cornstarch so I substituted flour instead.  Definitely going to keep this one!

Great recipe.
Used pre-minced garlic. Cut back a little on the other garlics, slightly less amount of Worcheshire and added finally diced 1/4 cup celery and a few more ounces of Guiness.
Our guests (10 people) consumed the whole pot.

Delishish. The tomato paste adds a great subtle flavor. I cut down on the potatoes and increase the meet and veggies to make it healthier. (Paleo diet)

Quadrupled the recipe for a big tailgate party.  Prepared it the night before and waited to do the reduction until just before people arrived.  Worked out great.  Huge hit.  Pouring over the mashed potatoes is a great idea.

I love Irish stew & this is a great recipe. I followed it almost exactly, but did add some fresh thyme. I highly recommend -- use Yukon potatoes so they'll hold up in the stew. My husband loved it too.

Awful. You need to add a lot of seasoning if  you want this to be edible. You will probably also need to add more liquid and cook it much longer than the recipe says if you don't want undercooked potatoes and carrots. Don't believe all the good reviews, they must have all added crack to their recipes. This is the worst recipe I have ever prepared from this site and actually made me create an account to tell people the truth about this recipe. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that browning the beef with flour before throwing it in the slow cooker was a great idea.

Made as directed. Ended up cooking on low for a few extra hours- went out for day. Dish was watery and bland, added extra beef bouillon and cornstarch and end before serving.

This was very good as written. It was a bit of a pain browning the meat, don't think it added anything special and I won't bother next time. Definitely a keeper though!

My sweetie said no beer, and the kids said no tomato paste, so I am not sure this even counts as Irish Stew.  I also used chicken broth as the liquid, halved the recipe,  doubled the onions, and quadrupled the garlic.  After browning the meat, a boneless chuck recommended by the butcher, and  sauteeing all the veggies in butter, I boiled the stew on high for two hours and simmered on low for four more.  I will likely make it again, though I would like to try the beer/tomato paste broth.

This was excellent. I marinated the beef overnight in guinness and soy sauce. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, only adding more broth, and it worked out great. Highly recommended recipe!

I added an extra glass of water to the stew because the sauce was a bit too thick and I added Old Bay  all spice to the flour coating to give it a nice kick. I really enjoyed it.

Absolutely  delectable.  I made a couple of changes.  I prefer the meat to go in first, adds more flavor to stew.  I also added parsnips, white turnip and the stew packet mix for flavor.  You need to season to taste or else it's bland. Excellent easy comfort food.  I cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hours.  Loved it.

After a trip to Ireland with friends, we came home craving the authentic Irish stew we had there. I found this recipe and it was easy enough that I gave it a try. It's delicious! I always use grass-fed beef (so tender) and Guinness beer. Not quite the same as the real thing, but close enough for us!

Taking a tip from others here, I added a tbsp bouquet garni, 2 bay leaves, salt and pepper as well as some garlic powder. Will try worcestershire sauce next time because it was still a bit bland. Beef was super tender and veggies were perfect. Will def make this again.

This recipe was great. It tasted even better the next day. I used a citrus dark beer which gave it a little zing in the taste. Whole family loved it. Even the little ones.

This recipe needs seasoning!! I added salt and pepper and a bay leaf. I made a mistake of pouring another can of Guinness to add more liquid, it turned out too bitter for me. Next time I will try more beef broth. Good recipe, simple enough to give it another try but I will keep tweaking it.

Good recipe, but could use some changes.  Half as many potatoes, more liquid, and some spices.  I added a sprig each of fresh chopped rosemary and thyme.
Also, make sure you mix the beef broth and tomato paste in the same pan you browned the beef in.  Make sure to scrape off all the remnants of the browning and mix in with the broth, adds a lot of flavor to the stew.

My girlfriend loved it - the others complimented me on it. I, however was not blown away. Although it cooked on low for 8+ hrs - the meat was not as tender as I'd like. I added all sorts of spices to 'taste it up' - still lacking - can't give it a 5*. Don't know that I'd do it again.
