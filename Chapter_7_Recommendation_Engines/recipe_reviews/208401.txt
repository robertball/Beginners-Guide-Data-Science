This is very easy to make on the spur of the moment I had just bought some fresh artichokes and needed something to dip them in. Used super fresh eggs and added a little bit of lemon and zest to it. Awesome!!

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written. It was so salty it was inedible. I think it should say an 1/8 of a teaspoon not a 1/2 of sea salt. A huge waste of ingredients. I tried to add a second batch to cut the salt taste but it was still TOO salty.

fantastic! I didn't know making mayonnaise was so easy!! I used this for my Angel Eggs (i.e. deviled eggs) and everyone LOVED it!!! I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I used Rice Wine vinegar... I also used Himalayan Crystal Salt which is less "salty" than regular salt...

This is a great and easy recipe. I made this as an ingredient for potato salad and it turned out very good. The garlic was a little strong and I think I'll try making it with roasted garlic the next time. Cant get any easier than this for tasty mayo in a pinch.

It needed more emulsifier and WAY too much garlic. Included sour cream to taste and it worked like a charm to mellow the garlic and improve consistency. Orig. recipe reminds me when I ate with a Muslim family in Tianjin and they accompanied their meal with a clove of garlic held in one hand.

I made this recipe as written and it tasted like pure garlic. I will probably make again but with only 1 or 2 cloves of garlic.

I made this and the consistency of mayo it never got to. I feel like I wasted my eggs and my time. Definitely not enough emulsification

Thank you! This gives just the right proportions. I was making a sandwich where the lemon wouldn't agree so I left it out.

Creamy and satisfying.   I cut the salt down and tossed in a garlic clove, seeded Serrano pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice.

Followed the recipe to the letter but the dinner called for tarragon to be added to the mayo. Worth it either way. Yummy and it makes a LOT.

Too much garlic and consistency was like liquid. Bummed now that I wasted so much olive oil.
