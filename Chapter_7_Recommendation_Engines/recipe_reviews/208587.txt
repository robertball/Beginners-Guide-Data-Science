Really tasty and easy.  I have made this same recipe 3 times using different jello's and fruits. Strawberry jello with frozen strawberries and tropical jello with canned pineapples as well as the raspberry and they are all great.

I used a dense chocolate cake like texas sheet cake...OMG! I love chocolate so I just had to try it. I think it would look really fancy w/ some kindda raspberry chocolate sauce drizzle. I'll let u know how I make out.

OMG!  Sooo good!   Made it exactly as recipe called out and so good, I had seconds.  I took it to a Christmas Eve dinner and it was a hit!  I generally am not a jello fan, but my friend requested a jello mold when I asked what I could bring, so I found this recipe on the website, I will definitely make this again

This is so easy to make and was amazing. Everyone loved it and I've already been asked to make it again.
