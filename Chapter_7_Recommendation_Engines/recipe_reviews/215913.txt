LOVED IT!! A great hot mustard. Easy to prepare. Prepared as directed.  We like some heat with our jalapenos so I doubled them and left the seeds in.  I will add more honey next time so sweeten it more.

I liked this condiment a lot. I used yellow and brown mustard seeds and brown mustard powder. I gave the seeds a trip through my pestle and mortar before adding to the vinegar for a soak. It's hot and tangy. I served alongside french fries and a salad with fontina cheese and tomatoes. This worked as a salad dressing perfectly. It's a bit runny as a dip, but still delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

The mustard seed was a BIG mistake for me. Without the seed, I would have rated this 5 stars, but
they really ruin it for me. I would encourage anyone who likes spicy foods to 
try this recipe, but without the mustard seed.

Really liked the flavor of this mustard, but I must admit I’m not crazy about the mustard seeds getting stuck in my teeth (sorry).  The “hotness” is about the max for us (we’re middle of the road on spiciness), but it is “hot jalapeno mustard.”  Quick to make, and it’s nice having a freshly-made condiment that doesn’t come out of a mustard bottle or jar.
