I think I would assemble them this way, to make sure the flavors were evenly distributed:  Mix together the orange juice concentrate, vanilla extract and whiskey.  Add the other ingredients and stir until blended.

The first time I made these, I followed the recipe. Yuck-- the oj concentrate burned my mouth. Next time, I added fresh orange zest (a whole orange worth), a couple tablespoons fresh squeezed oj(juiced the orange I had just zested) and about 1/4 cup orange marmalade (actually, I had some x-mas marmalade with cranberries in it too). Tossed all into a food processor and omg! So good I did not want to share. Was able to shape immediately and roll in powdered sugar.

Good - something a little different from our usual. They did not freeze well for me, but that is probably my fault.  Everyone who tried one said they were great, but no one ate more than a couple.  I had lots of leftovers that had to be trashed after a big Christmas party followed by my unsuccessful freezing attempt.

We found this to be just too strong.  I loved the idea, just found that they didn't appeal to anyone - sorry!
