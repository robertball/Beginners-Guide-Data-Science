This tastes delicious and is a great alternative to white potato hash browns. Tasted great with an over easy egg and chicken turkey sausage.

I did make it, I did a small substitute also.  Since I am only allowed to eat green onion tops, I used that in place of onion.  I left out the bacon & added  chives & French thyme.  I had it with my breakfast of eggs & fruit.  Thank you, it was delicious & the leftover kept til the next day just fine.

If you follow the recipe it is really great.  I don't understand people making bad reviews after stating they didn't even follow the recipe and made substitutions.

Yeah, this was a flop for the entire family - the flavors were confused and too savory for a breakfast item.  We used prosciutto instead of bacon and dried Thyme and Parsley - otherwise followed the recipe.   Keep looking for the magic sweet potato recipe!

We really liked this! I'll definitely make it again. It was very easy.

I didn't add the bacon because I served it as a side dish.
