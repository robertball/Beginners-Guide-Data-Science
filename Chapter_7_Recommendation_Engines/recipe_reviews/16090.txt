Great dressing, but it only made enough for 3 large potatoes with 2 boiled eggs. (At first it seemed I had a little extra dressing left over, but the potatoes soon absorbed the dressing I mixed with them, so I added in the "extra" dressing so the potato salad would be creamy. You might want to double the recipe if you're making a large batch of potato salad.

I thought I was doomed to making mediocre potato salad for the rest of my life, until I found this recipe!  I added salt, poultry seasoning, black pepper, cayenne pepper and celery seed to the base dressing; and chopped eggs, celery and onions to the potatoes.

I made this for a get-together and everyone said they loved it.  I even had some people that said they didn't really like potato salad, but they really liked mine.  This amount makes a generous batch of dressing.  I doubled it and used 3/4 or more of a 5 lb bag of redskin potatoes and it was more than enough (my hubby would have preferred a tad less dressing).  Overall an A+.

I thought this was very easy and quite tasty I did find it worked better by putting the dressing on just before you serve it because it gets quite thick the longer it is in the fridge, I used dijon mustard because I was out of regular mustard, I am anxious to try it with regular mustard!! I also added eggs,celery and pickles thanx for sharing!!!!!!

A good base recipe.  I did delete the ketchup and added celery seed,, a pinch of dill and a little sugar.  The results were great!!

The dressing was yummy.  It reminded me of something my mom used to throw together when we were out of salad dressing.  The potato sald tasted fine right after mixing it all together but the next day was another story.  My usual potato salad tastes better the longer it sits.  If anything, this got worse.  The leftovers the next day almost tasted like there was NO dressing on them at all.

Great dressing!  I used thick, strained yogurt instead of sour cream...and 1.4 cup minced onion. It tasted so good I was eating it with a spoon!

Quick and easy! And good! I doubled the recipe and used almost a whole 5 lb. bag of potatoes and added eggs and onion and would've added celery if I'd had it! Will definently make again!

I made this dressing this morning to try out and used all mayo since I had no sour cream.  It's very good even w/o the sour cream and very easy to make.  I added some celery for added crunch.

This is really good and easy.  I added shallots instead of onion for a hint of sweetness and garlic.  My salad consists of potatoes, boiled eggs, and celery.  I will definately use again.

Something was missing from this, though I can't place my finger on what exactly. I added celery seed but still probably will not make again without some more adjustments.

Quick and tasty!  Nothing extraordinary, in my opinion, but if you want a good potato salad and not use many ingredients or time, then this is a good recipe to use!

Great!  I added some hard boiled eggs and some chopped veggies that I had on hand (green pepper and red onion) and it turned out really good...thanks for the recipe.

I liked this recipe, but the onions were a bit much.  Hubby didn't think it was sweet enough, but I can always modify it to our tastes.  Over all it was good.

I found this recipe very easy to make and it was simply delicious.  I recommend it to anyone who likes potato salad.  My only addition to the potato salad and dressing was some chopped celery.

A half recipe was perfect for me. I used FF sour cream and lowfat mayo and added a little Frank's Hot Sauce and cracked black pepper. I actually used this for a Bacon-Tomato Pasta Salad that worked out pretty well. I think this dressing would be a great "secret" sauce starter for homemade baked wedge potatoes.

If i could give this ten stars, i would! Made several potato salads from this site, but nothing compares to this one. Followed dressing exactly.  Then when added to potatoes, also added 2 hard boiled eggs and some sweet relish. Perfect. Will make this often.  Easy and delicious.  Thank you for recipe!

Excellent!  I can't thank you enough for sharing.  This is my new "go to" recipe for any type of potato, macaroni or pasta salad.  I added a the onion, which are listed as optional - I also added a seasoned pepper blend and a little dried dill and chives.  Other than that, I kept it as written and my family just loved it.

This was just awesome. I was almost done making my potatoe salad, and just realized that I only had about 1/2 cup of mayo left(not enough). I found this recipe and it was AWESOME. The only change I made was no onion, only because the salad already had some. This was so creamy yet a bit tangy. This will now be the only dressing I use for Potatoe Salad.

Easy and delicious. I love that it is not all Mayo and therefore even the family members who do not like mayo love the potato salad!!!

Wow!  This made really fantastic potato salad!  I omitted the ketchup and added celery salt and a sprinkle of paprika.  My husband LOVED it, saying it was the best potato salad I've ever made.  I will definitely make this again!

I have always used the basic mayonnaise and a bit of mustard in my potato salad dressing and wanted something different.  This really filled the bill. I will definitely use this recipe again!  Also checked out the variations here and guess what? No more boring potato salad in this house!

I've been making potato salad over 50 yrs. and this was the best. I made dressing exactly as stated adding 4 chopped green onions.  To approx. 3 lbs cooled potatoes I added 2 chopped hard boiled eggs, 2 tab. sweet pickle relish, 1 chopped celery stalk and salt and pepper(to hot potatoes as suggested by a reviewer). Everyone loved it and it was gone!

I doubled the amount of Worcestershire and used this as a sauce for salmon patties.  It worked very well.

This dressing was amazing and needed no alterations. I did add more things to my salad such as: chopped boiled eggs, green onions, diced yellow onion, and sprinkled the top with paprika. Everyone loved it, and this dressing is a keeper!!!

Make sure to put all the things you love in your potato salad so it will have lots of flavor.  This dressing really absorbed into the potatoes and the salad was dry and tasteless the next day.  Be sure to save some dressing to add the next day. I may try it again using a double batch.  Tasted the best after only marinating 4-6 hours.

Keeper!  I didn't put in all of the ketchup because I was a little worried it would take too much like the dressing for a shrimp/macaroni salad.  I doubled (and then some) the recipe to make enough for a 5lb bag of potatoes, 8 eggs, half a cup of small diced dill pickles.  I also added dried minced onion to the dressing because I didn't have any fresh on hand.  I let the potatoes cool before adding the dressing and made the day before so I'm sure it's going to soak up all the goodness overnight.

While the ingredients sound strange for a potato salad, I decided to try this.  Wow - what a great flavor!  I used red potatos with the skin on and added onions, celery seed and garlic powder.  Very tasty!

This is so easy and tastes fantastic!  I am on my third batch in 8 days!  I added green onion and hard boiled eggs.  Everyone loved it!  No one could believe it had ketchup in it. The leftovers the next day were just as good or better than the first day. Thank you for saving us from dry and boring potato salad...I will be making your recipe from now on.

This is delicious potato salad dressing. I doubled it to cover a decent-sized salad. I also traded onion powder for the real onion (I'm not a big fan of raw onion) and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

It's excellent!  I was doubtful about the ketchup, but I can't argue with the results--I took it to two potlucks, and the potato salads were a hit both times.  One was just the dressing over a variety of small potatoes (red, gold, white and the purple fingerlings), the other was over cubed russets with celery, pickles, and hard-boiled eggs.  The dressing worked beautifully over both.

It tasted pretty good but nothing special just how potato salad should taste.  But it sure made prep easy and quick

This made a really great potato salad, especially with a little red onion thrown in.  We added a little sweet relish as well and would probably be good with some dill too.

I wasn't sure I liked this at first. I added a teaspoon of sugar and some chopped pickle and found it much more enjoyable. This would go great with burgers. Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe. I did double the recipe with 2 hard boiled eggs and about 6 potatoes. I added onion salt to taste and black pepper. The minced onion is a must! Will make again and again.

I didn't change a thing in this recipe, made it exactly as written and it is delicious!  It is different than the ordinary run of the mill dressings, has great zip and tang. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it will be a regular in my dinner rotations!

This is my first time making potato salad and though it was easy and good, it was better after adding chopped celery, chives and 2 or 3 hard-boiled eggs. I did not have green onions so used yellow. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Oh, and it does only make dressing enough for 3 large potatoes. Will probably make this again but next time substitute plain yogurt in lieu of sour cream for a healthier version. Can't wait to try on macaroni salad with grape tomatoes.

Love this dressing. I have been looking for a good all round dressing and this is the one. I made it according to recipe even though I was not sure about the ketchup in it. It turned out great. Thanks!

I made this for my family, as a side for a barbecue dinner we were making.  We love potato salad, and usually I just use ranch dressing over the potatoes, making it an easy prep.  I had some time so I decided to make a dressing.  I found this recipe and we all loved it.  I did make a couple of additions...I added sugar and I did add the optional onions.  I used all mayo since I didn't have sour cream on hand, and I sprinkled the salad with smoked paprika.  It was good the day of and is good on the second day as well. I had enough for about 1.5 lbs of potatoes and 3 hard boiled eggs, I also added some chopped pickles to my salad.  I usually cut the potatoes on the large side and we don't like really "goopy" dressing, so this was just enough.

Something's missing. It was nice, but just lacked.... zing. Not offensive, but not impressive either. I added minced black olives 'cause my mom always put those in 'tader salad.

This was very easy! I did add a lil of my own favorite flavors.  I used spicy brown mustard instead of the yellow mustard,2 tblsp of Horseradish sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce and added 1/4 cup sugar.  It was delicous and left overs tasted just as good on day two!

I made a few modifications to this recipe and it is fantastic!!!  First of all I did not add salt as the other ingredients are already full of flavour.  I did add sugar, onion, sweet pepper and minced garlic and it was soooooooooooooooooo good.  Will definitely do this again.

My daughter liked it, so rating it to her taste.  It was not my favourite, I think I am too used to Dill in my Potato Salad, I left out the onion and think adding it may have helped flavour the potatoes more - or maybe my potatoes were too waxy to absorb the flavours.

Zesty and flavorful, not too sweet. Use sweet chili sauce over ketchup, red onion and grainy Dijon mustard. Definitely make ahead and let the sauce sit for flavors to develop, then mix with potatoes when ready to serve.

This is one of the best potato salad dressings I have tried!  I left out the onion (I included the onion in the salad though); I added the dressing to the potatoes, hard-boiled eggs, celery, onion, chopped dill pickles and cooked crumbled-up bacon. Wow!

Thanks to the potato salad dressing recipe I made the best potato salad in 32 yrs. of marriage!  I think the ketchup and worcestershire, which i was hesitant about, really add to the mix!  This is a keeper for sure.

This recipe helped make my first try at potato salad a hit for our Memorial Day cookout. It would have been nice to know that a double batch was needed for a 5# bag of potatoes, and if you like "plain" potato salad, this is fine, but I like mine with some kick, so I need to find some things to spice it up a bit.

overall the recipe was good but i made a few changes.  i left out the ketchup, added a tsp. of dill pickle juice and as i always do to potato salad added a few strips of bacon(crumbled).
