Although, I didn't follow the whole recipe ( I prefer a different kind of chicken salad) the marinade made the chicken tender, juicy, and delicious.

Loved this recipe.  I actually ended up tripling it almost to feed my crew.  However I did keep the sugar the same amount because we aren't too big on really sweet things as the main course.  Turned out wonderfully.

This was a nice salad.  I cooked the chicken in a wok - hot and fast.  I did add tomatoes to the salad - over all this had a great taste.  Thanks.

I'm rating this mostly for the marinade, which turned out great grilled chicken for salad. Made for two, so doubled ingredients. Hint: marinading chicken works better if you pound it flat instead of cutting into chunks (then slice it after). I used/added some other veggies for the salad. The salad needed a bit of some kind of dressing, so I used creamy balsamic from the fridge.

I was looking for a recipe that called for radishes as I had some I needed to use, so I chose this recipe for dinner recently.  I did make a few minor changes.  I cut the sugar in the marinade in half and used three slices of bacon for two salads.  I also added tomatoes as I had some fresh from the garden.  This was good and we both enjoyed it.  The only change I would make next time would be to omit the water in the marinade.  I think it may have kept my chicken from browning nicely.  Other than that a good recipe!
