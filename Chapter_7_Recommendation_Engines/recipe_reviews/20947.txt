I give this recipe 5 stars ONLY if the lemon juice is substituted for lime juice and a little chopped onion is added to make the "guacamole" layer taste like real guacamole.  It is very simple to make and tastes very good if done this way.  The lemon juice just makes it taste like lemon flavored avacado instead of guacamole so Do try that instead.

We've been making this for years-we call it Mt. Diablo Dip.  Its very versatile-you can add or subtract toppings and seasoning to suit your tastes.  I always doctor up the beans stirring in a little garlic powder and some extra salsa.

My guests LOVED this recipe. I did make a few changes as follows:
For the avocado, I made a guacalome recipe and put that in it's place.
I also added a drained can of Mexican Corn and black beans
I also added a layer of shredded lettuce to the top under the cheese.
It could have been a whole meal in itself! Wonderful! I'll keep this one handy! Thanks!

This one is a classic that never fails to please. I made mine in a pyrex baking dish that was about 10"x10" and I felt as though 16 oz of cheese was a bit too much (I'd already grated a pound so I put it all on), I think it really depends on how big the surface area your dish of choice is. Also, I would definitly suggest seeding your tomatoes before dicing them, it will prevent the dip from getting wet and it will keep a lot better. This is one of those recipes I can never stop myself from eating too much of.

Very good taco dip, I did change just a few things. I added lettuce to the top, and I used lime juice with the avacados. I took this to a party and it was the first to go!

I've been making this dip for years, it actually gets invited to parties before I do. I mix some salsa in with the refried beans before layering.

I have made this for years and people absolutely love it.  As for leaving out the avocados...no can do!  That makes it yummier.  My family's version adds 1/4 cup of Mayo to the Sour cream mix...it gives it a nice tangy flavor!!  Diced black olives make this extra yummy too.

I used store bought (fresh) guacamole instead of the avocados and it was delicious.  However, after being refrigerated for a few hours, there was quite a bit of juice that I had to drain off before serving.  Everyone loved it.

I've been making my Seven Layer Taco Dip this way for years and it is always a huge hit. I think it is less heavy than the versions with cream cheese.  I serve it in a 9-10 inch round, glass quiche dish and the presentation is pretty.  Yummy!!

I recently made this for a party, and it was a hit. I added some chopped fresh cilantro to the guacamole layer, as well as lime juice, and that gave it a nice flavor. I used grape tomatoes chopped in half rather than big tomatoes, just to cut down on the amount of liquid. Also cut the amount of cheese in half, and it was still plenty. Topped with pickled jalapeno slices for added flavor. Served it with white corn tortilla chips. We'll definitely make this one again - so easy and good and easy to customize for your own personal preferences.

This is an old classic, I only tweak it by buying store made guacamole, using 4 Roma tomatoes, chopped olives and only 8 oz. of shredded Mexican style cheese.  I end up serving it with a spoon on the side as well as those teeny little spreaders so people can do their own spreading.

I make this dip ALL the time.  I add a can of diced jalapenos instead of green onions.  Also if you like heat, use the HOT taco seasoning mix!

Great! Here were my adjustments:
added guacamole seasoning and onions to the avocadoes. Use plain greek yogurt instead of sourcream (lessen the fat :)). Also added a layer of lettuce on the sourcream. Mixed the diced tomatoes with fajita seasoning (didn't have any taco seasoning). yummy

Doesn't serve 56 but enough for a small gathering.  I use black beans a layer of fresh salsa and lime juice, add diced green chili's.  This is a party pleaser.

I've been making this same recipe for years.  I add fresh cilantro and just a squeeze of lime juice to the avocado.  No one ever asks me to leave this layer out!
Then I sprinkle the cheese over the sour cream layer and arrange the vegetables in rows along the top of the cheese.  This presentation draws the newbies in.  Once they taste it, they are converted!
Definitely tastes better well chilled.

I have made this dip many many times over...the only change I make - is in the avocado layer is add a bit of Cayanne Pepper for a little punch and I also seed the tomatoes before I chop them or they tend to be really runny and wet

This tasted pretty good. My brother made something very similar over the holidays. I though, made it much healthier and changed it a little to what I had in the house to use up. As I was reducing the ingredients I used a 9x9 pan. I used no fat low sodium mashed beans, for the sour cream I used a 5.3 oz container of non fat plain Greek yogurt which I mixed 1 Tblsp approximately of Penzeys taco seasoning (reducing that layer to a 1/3). I like olives, but others don't so I left them out. For the cheese layer, I only did about 1/2 cup of small chopped reduced fat cheddar and jack cheese blend I had in a block. Lastly, I replaced the green onion with about 3 tblsp. of very finely minced white sweet onion. Everything else I left the same. After tasting it, I thought it had a good flavor. However, I found my tweak of changing the onion, to what I had on hand, a bit crunchy. So, to save it, I popped it under the broiler on low for about 10-11 minutes. It was delish.

I loved this! unfortunately I couldn't use avocado with it, but it still tastes amazing. I also didn't use any peppers or olives but that's because I don't like those. Great recipe!

I have made this appetizer for a number of parties and now get requests to bring it for parties.  16 oz. of cheese is a little too much -- I only use an 8 oz. package.

This is always a hit whenever I make it. I use refried black beans instead of pinto beans and lime in the avocado instead of lemon. So delicious!!

This recipe was easy and a great inspiration. Due to limited time I used prepared guacamole and poco de gallo. Delicious!

Recipe tasted okay, I was a little concerned about the MSG in the recipe.  Homemade seasoning would have made it much better!
