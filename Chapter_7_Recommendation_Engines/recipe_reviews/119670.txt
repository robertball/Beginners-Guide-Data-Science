My mom makes a recipe that is almost exactly the same as this. The only difference in the dressing is that she uses dry mustard. For the salad itself, she adds red delicious apples-this salad is known as "Cashew Apple Salad" at our house. I often will use baby spinach in place of half the lettuce. Its a big hit wherever we take it.

LOVED this.  Take the dressing up a notch: use red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, and red onion.  Using bagged Romaine keeps it super-easy.  Lots of requests for the recipe.

This recipe is just plain fun!  Change it up a little with fresh blueberries, strawberries or orange slices!  Used toasted or candied pecans, sunflower seeds, or ramen noodles!  Toss on some chow mein noodles for crunch!  Grill chicken and lay on top for a summer dinner salad!  Play!

I made this with sesame seeds and half vegetable oil/half sesame oil, and it came out good as well. I did this because I couldn't find poppy seeds, but I'm sure it would have been even better! The sweet tangy dressing goes perfectly with the swiss and cashews

Love this recipe. My alterations are less sugar (1/2 cup-more if needed), less oil (1/3 cup), 1 tsp. dry mustard instead of prepared mustard, a heaping tsp. instant minced onion instead of grated- if I am in a hurry, and 1 tsp. salt. TOP WITH red onion slices that have been soaked in water to remove pungency.

We love this and my mother in law adored it!  I also add either dried cherries, cut up apples or mandarin oranges.  This is a delicious salad!

This is my favorite salad. The dressing is sweet, but it compliments the swiss and romaine perfectly.

YUM! Everything about this recipe was a success! The only thing I did was fry up some breaded chicken breasts and slice them for the top of the salad. But it would be tasty as-is, too.

A friend makes this salad, but now I live overseas and wanted to make it. So glad I found this recipe. I thought it seemed like the sugar and oil were a bit much, so I cut down to 1/2 c. sugar and 3/4 cup oil. It still made plenty of dressing and tasted great. All the prepared mustard where I live is more like dijon mustard, and it worked well in this dressing.

I actually found this in a Taste of HOme magazine.  Have made it twice and received rave reviews both times.  I used white wine vinegar add mandarin oranges. They make it more colorful and tasty.

This salad is so very yummy, but not one of those "healthy" salads I would say.  I use cheddar cheese sometimes too, some of my family doesn't like swiss. Either way, it is a hit when brought anywhere.

Fantastic and very easy.  I was concerned the swiss cheese wouldn't be a good combo with the dressing - but it is great!

Very good!  I used spinach and romaine.  Also substituted the swiss for Asiago.  That was what I had on hand.  The dressing was very enjoyable.

Marvelous salad!  If I could give it more stars, I would!  I used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 and used red leaf lettuce mixed with Romaine.  This one is a keeper!
