I opted for this recipe rather than the others because it called for less ingredients and more bananas, which makes them taste more like bananas and less doughy. I found that if the fritters were fried to just a golden brown, they were a little soft, so I let them fry a little longer to a medium brown. This made them crispier when they cooled down, and they were just as tasty. Thanks for this great recipe!

This recipe is delicious! I added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter before frying and it gave it a nice flavor. When frying, I recommend only a medium flame so that the outside slowly browns while the inside has time to cook. The center should still be soft, but not mushy. Also, I like eating these with some powedered sugar sprinkled on top. Overall, I recommend this recipe!

My dad makes this all the time but he doesn't mash the bananas with sugar, just slices them into the batter.  They are great snacks to munch on!

Got left over bananas? This recipe is perfect for them! I had 4 left over bananas and hate throwing them away. I was looking for another way to use them without the usual banana bread. I'm not a big fan of frying because of all the grease but this recipe was WONDERFUL! Ok, I found that I was out of Baking Powder and I added a few drops of vanilla extract and fried a little longer because I wanted them not as soggy. They came out wonderful! I added some powered sugar on the top to garnish also. It was a BIG hit at our house!

Super easy and all my friends asked for the recipe. My bananas were just starting to ripen (had little brown freckles) so I used brown sugar instead of white. The consistency was great and the brown sugar added extra sweetness.

This was very good. I only had a couple of bananas but it still had a nice banana flavor. I tried to make a couple of them bigger, but they were not done in the middle.  I did make a light glaze to go over it.

such a simple and tasty way to finish up your banana stash! you can add spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, etc) to slightly alter the taste each time. also, i like to dip mine in sweetened condensed milk! yum : ]

This recipe was so easy & delicious.  I added pecan chips & loved it.  I made it for breakfast but would even recommend it as dessert served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Weren't as tasty as I had expected. I personally preferred for mine to be golden brown and they only have to cook for around 30 sec.

We have made this recipe several times and it is a family favorite!  We cook them in coconut oil, and a 350' skillet is a must so they are crisp and tasty and not tough or chewy.

My grandsons really enjoyed this sweet treat, the only thing I did different was to dust the fritters with powder sugar.

I thought these were awful. My husband wouldn't even touch them.  I scaled down my recipe to use 4 bananas and I'm not sure what went wrong but these were nothing more than fried blobs of mushy goopy mashed banana.  I tried to cook a couple extra long but then they were just burned blobs of banana.  I've made tons of fritters in the past and have never had any turn out like this.  I'm really surprised since there were so many good reviews...they were nothing like traditional fritters. I might try this again but would hate to waste more time and ingredients...we were really looking forward to these but they were a big dissapointment. --- The only thing I can think of is that my bananas were too ripe?? I think I will try this with some barely ripe bananas and hopefully I can post a more positive review.

Depending on how ripe or over ripe the bananas are, adjust the amount of flour used, to obtain a very very thick batter. It helps to use 2 spoons to drop neat spoonfuls of batter into the hot oil. Traditionally, sharp pointy 'tails' on the fritters are not favored. For variation, i sometimes add a couple of tablespoons of shredded/ dessicated coconut into the batter.

i had 3 very ripe bananas & no eggs or milk. this was a perfect recipe to put them to use, i just halved this recipe. i did add some cinnamon & vanilla extract. i also fried them in coconut oil. they came out well. i bet they'd be awesome with blue bell homemade vanilla ice cream, but i was not hungry when i made these. after taking out the oil i did spread some of my raw cinna honey. they were good & worth making! next time i'll make sure i'm craving sweet food & have ice cream before making them again.

Yum!! These were excellent. I also found they were a little soft on the inside, which I wasn't expecting, so you have to be careful when frying and test them a few times first to get it right. I used overripe bananas that had been frozen. I'm sure it would work even better with fresh bananas, but it worked really well even with the frozen ones. Drizzle a little honey over them and you have yourself a serious treat!

These were delicious! I let the oil become quite hot before I dropped the fritters in, so it took significantly less time to cook. I used the wok, and skipped the rum flavoring since I didn't have any around. I also sprinkled confectioner's sugar over them when they were done. Yummy!

Good flavor, but flat and sticky.  Hard to fry because the fritters stuck to the bottom of the pan and the turning utensil, had to carefully free the sticky fritter from the bottom of the pan before flipping it, then had to free it from the turning utensil. 2/5 of our family liked this recipe.  If I were to try to improve this recipe, I would probably add more flour and maybe an egg, and it could maybe use some more baking powder.  Needs more leavening.

It was nothing that I would ever make again. The pictures are deceiving. These things turned out limp, and hard to chew.

I made a few minor adjustments to this recipe including using gluten free baking mix instead of regular flour.  I cut the recipe way down since I realized how many servings it is for!  There are only three in our household!  Lol. I used brown sugar instead of white and fried them in coconut oil.  Since I realized these were not what I consider traditional banana fritters I was happy with the outcome.  They are not fluffy so if that is what you are wanting, skip this recipe.  But, they have a nice banana flavor and even though you may think they are too dark let them fry to a deep brown on each side.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a change to their regular fritters!

I made mine and tried to take in to account what the others said. Mine went real flat and were not quite done in the middle. My best friend is a banana nut so I am going to try again for her tomorrow morning with our coffee. To night I downed the recipe to only 4 bananas but never fear I got a bag at the store today that were quite ripe for .50 so I will try again.

I thought these were great.  They were a hit with one child but the other kids didn't care for them, to my surprise. I think it's a great way to use up old bananas, and easy too!

I followed this recipe to the t, but had to make some changes after I fried the batter. I think the flour should be 2 5/8 cups, 5 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. After I made these changes, I tried the batter again, and it was great.

This had really good flavor. It was very similar to a dessert we had at an authetic Indonesian restaurant. But not all of the flour mixture cooked through in the middle. It didn't alter the flavor nonetheless it was my reason for not assigning the very top rating. I will make this again.
