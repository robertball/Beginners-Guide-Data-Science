Excellent recipe! Got rave reviews on this salad. However, I used only 1/2 the amount of vegetable oil and twice the amount of vinegar. Also added some oregano and used a 3 cheese blend instead of plain Romano cheese.

I reduced the recipe to make two servings. It was way too oily, way too salty and just aaaggghhhh. No way I will make this again. It needs something to cut away some of the saltiness like mandarin oranges etc.

Very tasty combination of ingredients! I'm going to try it with some chicken added for a main dish salad.

This salad has a strong, distinctive taste.  On the recommendation of another reviewer, I halved the oil but I didn't add anything else to replace the liquid- still had plenty to coat the salad.  Instead of blue cheese and romano, I used gorganzola and grated parmesean.  I worried it would be to salty but didn't find this to be true.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I liked the idea of this salad but I had to alter it for my elderly parents who won't eat anything remotely healthy unless it includes sugar, butter and/or  it's deep fried.  So I made a simple 3:1 fruity vinaigrette with orange-infused olive oil and white balsamic cranberry/pear vinegar.  Reduced amount of cheese to about  1/2 c gorgonzola and 1/2 c parmesan.  Lightly used the vinaigrette. Tossed with a bit of S&P.  Served with a bit of dried currants on top.  It was quite tasty.  Next time, will try Spanish Olive oil with the vinegar, lemon juice and garlic (yum!).

I got lots of good vibes from it and I added shredded carrots to it.
