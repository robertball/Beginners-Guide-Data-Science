Wonderful easy low fat/carb meal. I made some slight modifications.. I seasoned the fish on each side with lemon pepper seasoning and garlic powder instead of using lemon juice. I topped the salsa mixture on the fish and squeezed a quarter of an orange over it along with a drizzle of olive oil. Sprayed a baking dish with butter flavor cooking spray and Baked in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Amazingly moist and delish! The one star was only due to my modifications.

7.26.16   Nice salsa, and it gave a well-deserved kick of flavor to mild tilapia.  I think the salsa  would be more effective on cod or halibut, for example.  But this was super easy cooked in a grill pan on the stove, and we still enjoyed it!  Perfect weeknight meal.

First of all, I'm not terrific at frying fish. This was fine but I would season the fish much more next time. We liked the salsa with the fish. I had to sub in canned jalape√±o & estimate the right amount. But it was tasty with the fish& the steamed broccoli.
