I made this last night and it was delicious.  Used a prior reviewer's suggestion and made it in a round 2-qt casserole dish instead of a 9x13-inch pan, to avoid having a dry casserole (other than that I followed the recipe exactly).  Like previous reviewers have commented, it was just a tad on the dry side.  Wasn't so dry that my fiance and I didn't enjoy eating it (it was really tasty!), but could use about half a can more soup.  I used red onions which made for a colorful dish.  I will definitely be making this again - it's a keeper - but next time I'm going to add 1/2 can more soup to it.

Overall the receipe is very good. As indicated by others, it was dry. Considering using a whole bag of noodles, I did add another can of soup and 1/2 cup of milk. Next time I make this, I think I will add sour cream in addition to the extra can of soup and milk, the mixture really needs to be pretty soupy when baked, since the noodles soak up so much of the liquid. Where did the cayenne pepper substitute come from, I didn't see it in the receipe, although it would be a good addition. Thanks for the recipe.

Very Good!  I usually just "wing it" when it comes to making tuna casserole, but there is a first time for everything, and I actually followed a recipe this time!  As other reviewers stated, I too added some milk to make it more creamy.  I then added about a 1/4 cup of miracle whip as well for a little zip, then I did my usual doctoring with onion and garlic powders.  Instead of using potatoe chips on top I used crushed crackers that I pulsed a few times in the food processor with some melted garlic butter.  The end reult was a very yummy tuna casserole.

I ENJOYED THIS TUNA CASSEROLE. I PREPARED IT FOR MY MOTHER AND I AND IT WAS ENOUGH FOR AT LEAST 6 PEOPLE. AFTER READING THE REVIEWS ABOUT THE CASSEROLE BEING DRY AND BLAND, I MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. I USED A FAMILY SIZE CAN CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP, I PUT A LITTLE EXTRA SALT IN THE BOILING WATER THAT I COOKED THE NOODLES. I MELTED 1.5 STICKS OF BUTTER IN A SAUCEPAN AND SAUTED MY ONIONS BECAUSE I DID NOT THINK 20 MINUTES WOULD GET THEM AS TENDER AS I PREFER. OF COURSE, I ADDED THAT BUTTER TO THE MAKING OF THE CASSEROLE AS WELL. I INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF ONION CALLED FOR IN THE RECIPE TO HALF OF A LARGE ONION. I USED SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE AS WELL FOR ADDED FLAVOR. I INCORPORATED ALL THE CHEESE INTO THE CASSEROLE AND JUST USED CRUSHED POTATO CHIPS ON TOP. I DID NOT DRAIN THE TUNA, I USED THE JUICE AS WELL TO HELP WITH THE BLAND TASTE THAT WAS MENTIONED IN SEVERAL REVIEWS. I REDUCED THE OVEN TEMP TO 350 DEGREES AS WELL TO KEEP THE CASSEROLE FROM DRYING OUT AS MUCH. THE RESULT WAS EXCELENT!!!

I'm not a big fan of Tuna casserole but I gave this one a try, with a few modifications it came out a 5 star recipe.  My father in law told my mother in law to step aside and let me cook it from now on.  He told everyone it's the best F'n Tuna casserole he's ever had.... I guess that about sums it up : )  This is what i changed, I seasoned the mixture with johnnys, I did NOT add mushrooms, I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery, i sauteed the onions in a little bit of butter and also some celery, I added some canned corn in addition to the peas and more cheese to the mixture than it calls for.  Best I have ever had.

I have never been a tuna casserole fan but when I saw the name of this one, I though I HAD to give it a try! I am so glad that I did!! I used a 12oz pkg of regular shell noodles and instead of peas (I have never been a pea fan either), I used a  drained jar of diced pimentos.  This was indeed the Best tuna casserole I have ever had and my family agreed.  Wil be making again!!

It was good. I would suggest, however, that you mix all the cheese in the casserole as it dries out to quickly on the top.  Also, I used crushed herb flavored pretzels mixed with seasoned croutons instead of the potato chips and it was fabulous.

Not a big hit with my 2 year old nephew, but everyone else loved it!  I doubled the tuna, added another 1/2 bag of noodles, and added a can of Cheddar Cheese Soup.  I used buttered bread crumbs instead of the potato chip topping.  It tasted exactly like the frozen dinner Tuna Noodle Casserole that I love!

I am not a huge fan of tuna casserole. It is always so boring, but this recipe is a great start. With a few modifications, it came it fantastic! I used 8oz of noodles instead of 12, which helped keep the dish from drying out in the oven. My family really likes onion, so I used about half of a sweet yellow, roughly chopped. I also added 1/2c sour cream and 1/4 milk to the mix. I didn't have any chips so I just used cheese as a topping, but french fried onions would be great on top. Baked in a 2qt round casserole dish for about 25 minutes at 350. You don't have to bake at such a high temperature since everything is already cooked.  You only need to thaw the peas and warm the dish. With these alterations, the casserole came out moist and delicious. My husband ate about half of it in one sitting and it makes great leftovers too! We will be having this again!

This is by far the best tuna casserole I've had, and as easy as the classic.  I often substitute canned salmon for tuna, or use canned asparagus as the main veggie.  YUM!

This casserole is very good and quite possibly the best one of it's type that I've tasted so far!  It reminds me of the tuna casserole that my grandma and mom made when I was a child, but even better!!!  This is perfect for kids!!!  I omitted the mushrooms since I don't like them.  This goes well with a tall, cold glass of milk and oreos for dessert, or if time allows, a Jell-O salad (i.e. cherry cola Jell-O salad) & homemade brownies.  Yum! Yum!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because, while it was delicious, I had to make the suggested changes to make it work. I took advice from varying reviews, and added a little macaroni and cheese know-how, and ended up with a great casserole! There wasn't a dry noodle in the house. Here's what I did:  - Chopped up about 2/3 of a red onion and sauteed in the pan. When onions were nearly done cooking, I added about 6 sliced Baby Bella mushrooms and sauteed for a few minutes. - Meanwhile, I poured 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup in a pan. Filled each can with milk and added that as well. I brought the mixture to a boil, shut off the heat, and added about 2 1/2 to 3 cups of shredded cheese (extra to compensate for the milk). I stirred the cheese in until a cheese sauce was formed, adding salt and pepper along the way. - I then mixed the cheese sauce into the noodles, along with the tuna, onions, mushrooms and frozen veggies. Once everything was coated, I covered in flavored bread crumbs and baked. - The end result.... A+!!!!

This recipe is a good. It is fast and easy to fix. It might be a little bland and it does taste very similar to a Tuna Helper meal but has the homemade appeal instead. I used crushed corn flake cereal dredged in butter for the top since I had no potato chips on hand and it worked okay but I would definitely try the chips if I were to make it again. All in all, this is a good recipe with simple ingredients right out of the pantry. It is a recipe that will turn out just  average.

This is an exceptional tuna casserole...HINT: I mixed in one cup of sour cream before baking. This eliminated ANY dryness anyone else has experienced!!!  Try the sour cream. Makes it incredibly creamy!!

I always feel bad altering a recipe... I mean following it is what makes it a recipe! I was having a hankering for tuna casserole and needed a base recipe. This worked perfect, and I loved the suggestions everyone else had too. To make this "my family" friendly, I omitted the mushrooms, onions and peas (lol) and instead used 2 cups of frozen chopped broccoli. I also put in a cup of sour cream, cayenne pepper, garlic salt and used sharp white cheddar cheese. For the top I skipped the cheese and just used crushed croutons and it was so good!! I highly recommend this recipe, either as written or doctored up. Its a really simple, delicious one!

I made this for dinner last night and it was excellent. I read the reviews first and made the following changes: 1. sauteed the onion with a little minced garlic before adding, 2. used mixed veggies instead of peas (family preference), 3. baked in a round 2 qt casserole instead of a 9x13 dish, 4. whisked the 2 cans of soup with one can of milk before adding and seasoned the soup with salt and pepper, 5. mixed most of the cheese in and sprinkled just a little on top, 6. topped with crushed whole grain Ritz instead of potato chips (family preference), 7. used whole grain egg noodles (family preference), 8. baked at 375 for 15 minutes covered, then 425 for 10 minutes uncovered.  It was moist, creamy, and delicious.  It may have needed a little more veggies and tuna, but that's personal preference.

After clicking through different tuna casserole versions and reviews, I picked this one, and I've made it numerous times - putting a different spin each time based on what's in the fridge/pantry. ALWAYS turns out FABULOUS. I think that the real beauty of this recipe is it's openness to interpretation. (Say you're in the middle of a snowstorm, like we are right now, and you have the main ingredients and some others...) Tonight I had no egg noodles (used penne), no peas (used steamed broccoli florets) and happened to have on hand some fresh basil, chicken broth and cooking sherry, so I threw those in with the 2 cans condensed soup. I added Parmesan cheese and lemon juice and zest to the sauce. It came out less like a casserole in density, since it didn't stick tight together, but HOLY COW was it DELISH!!!! Definitely this version is going in the permanent rotation! THANKS for the great recipe! One other tip: I make the whole thing in one pot - saute the onion, carrot, celery and mushroom in a dutch oven on the stove top. Stir in the frozen peas (or brocc or whatever green veggie you prefer - asparagus would be yummy too!), stir in all the other ingredients and pop the whole thing in the oven with the lid on for the first 20 mins, off for 10. 

You can fit the volume of added healthy veggies and tuna if you're using the dutch oven rather than the 13x9 pan. Makes AWESOME leftovers for DAYS.

I did read over the reviews before trying this out myself and i am glad i saw that it does dry out a little bit. So the only thing i did extra was add a half can of cheddar cheese soup (or sour cream if cheddar cheese soup is not in pantry). and since i didn't have any potato chips or crackers, i improvised and used the canned french's fried onions. DELICIOUS!!!! Thanks for the recipe!

This is my second time making it. The first time, I gave it 3 stars because it was bland and dry. The second time, I tweaked it.  MUCH better.

First I added a clove of garlic, an extra can of soup AND some sour cream.   I also added some dill weed. Dill makes tuna and salmon taste SO much better. I have no idea why.   I also used green beans instead of peas because I hate peas.

This was a better than average tuna casserole, but is definitely not the best, mainly because it is so incredibly bland.  I halved the recipe since hubby doesn't eat tuna.  I knew going in that I would need more spice so I added 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of coarsely ground black pepper and a 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  Even with those additions and all of the salt in the soup, cheese and potato chips, I still had to add extra salt and pepper upon serving.  I also didn't think there were enough peas.  Next time I make this, I intend to double the peas, add 1.5 tsp. of garlic salt, more pepper, the cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes.  I also think it would work well to makes this with shredded chicken for the fish haters.  Good base recipe - it just needs more seasoning to be really good.

This was a very good dish, although, like many have said, it was rather dry. If I were rating this dish the first time that I made it-following the recipe exactly, I would have given it two stars, but I wanted to give it a chance since so many people liked it. The second time I made some changes so the 5-star rating is based on making it with my changes. I sauteed my onions in butter and fresh garlic and I added a cup of milk to the sauce before adding it to the noodles. I also really loved the potato chips on the top.

Not much to say other than this is a really good & really easy basic tuna casserole. Yeah, no gourmet nothing going on here but I don't look for gourmet when I'm craving tuna casserole!

Other reviewers said it was dry, so I added 1/2 cup of milk and another can of cream of mushroom blended together before mixing. I also used a can of peas drained instead of frozen.Turned out fantastic!! Glad I added the extra cream of mushroom.

this is a great old recipe that has been in my family for years, alot of other reviewers stated that it came out very dry, add about a cup of milk, or until the consistency looks right and that solves the problem. and another thing is, in order to avoid "hard cheese' on top, put the cheese on top first, then the potato chips, then the chips crisp and the cheese doesnt get too dried out.

I made this for a quick Sunday dinner. I thought the cheese was going to be too much but it blended perfectly into the casserole, and went perfectly with the crunchy potato chip topping. The only change I made was adding a quarter cup of sour cream I had sitting in the refrigerator that I wanted to use up. This is a moist and tasty recipe for anyone that loves tuna casserole. I put it in a 8x12 disposable aluminum and it baked up beautifully.

I normally despise tuna casserole. I LOVE this recipe. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms first. I added 1/2 soup can of milk. In every other way, I followed the recipe. This is CRAZY good!

I made the following changes: I sauteed the onion and some celery in garlic infused olive oil, added the mushrooms without draining them, topped it with Italian bread crumbs, added 3/4 of a soup can of milk and added fresh ground pepper. I also cooked it at 350 for 25 minutes instead of the higher temp.

It came out very moist and was very good. Next time I will try to add sour cream instead of milk, garlic and some herbs. This was very easy to make and one of the best tuna casseroles I've ever had.

I like this recipe, but I just gave it 4 stars. Cause I didn't follow it completely, and I add something more to taste by my own. It just came out very yummy. My whole family loved it.

This is a great recipe for tuna casserole and I saved it to my favorites! I made a few changes - first sautéed onions, celery, fresh mushrooms, and garlic. Thanks to the reviews, I lowered the temp to 375 and added about 1/4 cup of milk. Mine did not come out dry at all. It was delicious! I think that 425 temp is the culprit in the dry casseroles. Also, I did not use potato chips  - I realize that’s one of the ingredients that makes this recipe unique. I just didn’t have any so I used saltine crackers instead. However, next time I will make sure I have the potato chips!

Yum! We loved this, and it might become our "regular" tuna noodle casserole recipe. I made a couple of changes; we had peas on the side and I took out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them. I also used an extra can of soup because other reviewers said it was too dry.

This was very good, I did, however, add half a cup of sour cream, green beans instead of peas and carrots, and generous dashes of garlic salt and pepper.  The chopped onions were good, but not cooked enough, would probably sautee` them.  Very very good, easy, fast, and you can play around with it.

My husband had tuna casserole as a kid and mentioned it recently he'd like to eat some.  This was my first time making and eating tuna casserole and it was delicious thanks to this great recipe!  I followed some of the suggestions and added 1/4 cup water and 1/2 cup sour cream. I also sautéed the onions before I added it to the rest of the ingredients.  Husband loved it, will keep this recipe!

Amazing!!!!  I cooked everything as directed...added salt and pepper to the milk (2%), butter, flour mixture...and it was a raging success!!!  Will definitely make over and over again...and FYI if cooked correctly it will not be dry at all - rather perfect I'd say!!!  Yum!

The one from my 1960's heavenly child hood consists of tuna, egg noodles, cream of mushroom soup, salt and pepper, thinly sliced green olives with the pimento ( makes all the difference) and crushed potato chips on top.  This is still the best in my book.  I only add shredded cheese, mixing it throughout.  Yum

This was quite tasty. I took some other reviewers' advice and added some milk to make it a little more liquidy. Also added some salt, pepper and garlic salt; didn't use any extra mushrooms as my husband doesn't like them. Substituted about 1/2 a sleeve of crushed up Ritz crackers for the topping in lieu of the potato chips. If my 4 year old wasn't so averse to anything even remotely spicy, I would have added a little cayenne as another reviewer suggested. Otherwise, my only real recommendation would be to lower the temp and cook longer...20 minutes is not enough to get the insides warm but at that temp, I believe the topping would burn if left on too much longer. So next time I'll try 350 for 30-40 minutes instead.

Delicious!  I am impressed!  I used bow tie pasta.  I don't eat mushrooms so I eliminated them and substituted cream of chicken soup.  I halved this and baked in a 8x8 dish.  I also added 1/2 can of milk, which would be 1 can for the full recipe.  I believe the milk is an important addition, maybe even could have added a touch more.  I will make again and often.

This recipe was excellent! I did have to improvise a bit. I didnt have any cream of anything so I used mayo, milk and mustard and added a bit of cranberry sauce for a sweetener. No egg noodles on hand so I used ramen noodles (4 packages fed my entire family). I substituted the tuna with canned anchovies and black olives that made it taste great. I added creamed corn just to make it juicier and some leftover ham salad that I had in the fridge. The entire family was presently surprised and they are begging me to make it again. I may add some mashed potatoes next time to give it some texture and more flavor. Thanks so much for the recipe!! It was a hit all around!

Very delicious casserole.  Here's a tip-- use a pot instead of any size bowl and a cup of sour cream.  I used the biggest bowl I have in the house and it was barely enough to mix together.  I sauteed onions and garlic and mixed that in with a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom (woulda went mushroom all the way but that's all I had on hand.)  After reading some reviews I heard it got a bit dry in the oven so I added a cup of sour cream-- boy, am I glad I did!  Perfect consistency still after several reheats, even microwaved.  For the topping, I used Ritz Crackers in the food processor with a bit of butter and some Parmesan.  It was better the next day!!!

this was the best tuna casserole i have ever eaten let alone made.  i made the substitutions which were suggested and a couple of my own.  since i am overseas, i had to make my own condensed cream of mushroom soup which i found online. made a triple batch of cream of mushroom soup using 2 big cans of mushrooms.  substitututed 2 med roasted red peppers and .5 canned corn for peas. added 2/3 c. sour cream,  spiral noodles instead of egg noodles, colby jack, cayenne, crushed garlic, salt, pepper, and extra whole milk.  my husband who is "not a tuna guy" called it "fanastic" and the whole dish was scraped clean.  by the way, this was just the right amount for a hungry family of 5 adults and 1 preteen.

The chips are a good touch, but not good as a leftover as they get soggy.  Kind of short on flavor might add just a touch of Worcestershire to the sauce.

I found this recipe and my mom made it tonight for our family. She said it was the best tuna casserole she has ever had.One of my sisters who has never liked tuna casserole even said it was good. Everyone loved it. I didn't try it because it isn't very healthy but I wish I could have from all the compliments it got from our family. This will definitely be replacing our old tuna casserole recipe. Thanks for sharing:)

SO GOOD! I made this last minute for a  Lent dinner. I replaced the soup with Classico alfredo sauce, and added just a touch more sauce as I wanted it creamier! Topped with panko, will certainly make again!

Surprisingly good.  Used real mushrooms, added a bit of milk, sour cream, garlic salt, and onion powder.

yum.. after reading other reviews I added a cup of light mayonnaise and put all my cheese inside casserole.. my moisture was perfect.. If I had gone with only the 2 cans of soup it would have been too dry.. the next day it was a little dry due to the noodles further sucking up moisture.. I can only imagine how dry it would have been next day without additional mayo.. this is reason it was rated 4 stars.. added a little garlic salt and pepper.. it was very good.. thanks

This dish was delicious we used whole wheat noodles and I didn't have two cans of soup so I put a little skim milk in instead which I hope made it a little healthier.The dish didn't seem too dry for me but all in all my fiance and I enjoyed it very much.

Quick. Easy. Delicious! My family devoured this dish. I added an extra cup of peas and did not completely drain the noodles and it came out perfect, not dry at all.

Good recipe!  I made a few changes though and it turned out great. I added more mushrooms, more peas, more onions (red) about 1/2 cup,  omitted the cream of mush soup and instead used about 1 cup of milk, 2T butter, 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup of cream cheese.  I also added salt, pepper, onion powder and all seasoning to taste. I also used bread crumbs instead is chips.  Have fun creating!!

This recipe turned out wonderful! I do not often give 5 stars, but I couldn't find anything wrong with this recipe. 
I know that regular potato chips would of tasted just as good, but I put Lays Baked BBQ chips on top and that tasted superb! Great recipe, extremely simple, and it really is the best tuna casserole ever!

I too, found this a bit dry.  It looked dry when I mixed it up, so I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of milk and reduced the baking temp to375.  It could still have been a bit more moist for my taste, so I think, if I use this again, I'll reduce the amount of noodles to about 10 ounces.  I realize it will make less then, but there are only three of us so that would work fine.

Followed the recipe exactly, using Pringles as the chips on top.  Turned out delicious, but as others have said, a bit dry.  Will add more soup next time, but it was definitely yummy!  EDIT:  Added some splashes of milk this most recent time, and it turned out excellent!

Pretty tasty, I thought it was a little dry so I poured a little milk into the casserole dish.  Have made it twice, the first I followed the recipe to a T, the second time around I added the milk and omitted the potato chips and sprinkled the top with Italian bread crumbs instead.

I made a lower fat version of this recipe and was pleased with the result.  I used whole wheat, no yolk egg noodles, 98% fat free condensed cream of mushroom soup,and  reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese.  I mixed all of the cheese into the mixture prior to baking, along with about 10 oz. of water to prevent dryness.  I used panko bread crumbs as a topping.  It came out really well, and I feel alot less guilty about indulging in tuna casserole!

Great base recipe! I would highly recommend that when adding all your ingredients together, make sure that you mix the mushroom soup with a wire wisk in the bowl first, ALSO -- add a can full of milk! It turned out a very creamy recipe with the milk, and helps to avoid the dryness others were talking about. I also used Barilla Gemelli noodles instead of egg noodles. Other than that, excellent!

Jennifer's Best Tuna casserole was very good.  I added some salt and pepper as I do to everything.  My husband, who loves tuna casserole had three helpings.  I will make this again and again.

Needs some tweaking- cook at a lower temperature and covered.  I may use broccoli instead of peas next time.  Also add some pepper and garlic powder to the mix, and 3 cans of tuna instead of 2.  I did add sour cream, and I made it a bit healthier by using 2% cheese, low fat sour cream, and healthy request soup.

Something this good shouldn't be this easy! I never tried to make Tuna casserole before this recipe but one day I was just really craving some- luckily I stumbled upon this recipe. I do tripple the tuna as the suggested amount doesn't seem to be anywhere near enough. I also mix in a cup of mix and a 1/2 cup of sour cream to make it creamier. I keep meaning to add French's French Onions instead of potatoe chips but each time I have made it I just happen to not have any. Next time I do intend to try the french onions as they just seem to be perfect for a dish like this. But the kids love it AND so does the hubby (and he doesn't even eat Tuna). This recipe is a guaranteed winner!

This is a great dish when altered to suit your own taste. I'm giving it 4 stars since I made changes others suggested to keep it from being too dry.  I added an additional 1/2 cup of cheese and 1cup of sour cream. I substituted red peppers for the mushrooms since it already had mushroom soup. The red bell pepper looked nice with the peas. I used a 12 oz. pkg of frozen peas because that's the size I had on hand. I increased the onion and sautéed it in olive oil with the peppers before adding it to the mixture.  I also added garlic and dill because we like spicy food. Then I topped it with buttery cracker crumbs and cooked half of it for 20 minutes at 350. I froze the other half for dinner another.

My fiance was resistant to tuna casserole because he remembered his mom's dried out version.  I have to use the healthy request mushroom soup to avoid MSG, so I doctored this up with 1/4 t celery seed, 1/4 t garlic salt, 1/8 t salt, and 1/4 t black pepper.  I also used 3 cans of soup and 1/2 cup light sour cream.  The result was awesome!  It was full of flavor and very moist.  He actually asked me to make this again.

Baking this right now but can tell this will be the new tuna casserole recipe to use. I did make subs according to what I had in the pantry. Macaroni noodles (2 cups), Cream of Mush and Cream of Celery (1 can of each), 1/2 cup of sour cream, and a semi soft cheese that had more a sharp taste than regular cheddar. I also added spices my family likes: garlic powder, dash of seasoning salt, and pepper. As I dumped it all into my HUGE casserole dish (makes a lot which is always good) I tasted the remains and it was delicious. Oh, did not top with cheese as it has enough in the casserole and I crumbled Ritz crackers over top. Can't wait to chow down as baking it is just going to make it better!

Just made this for dinner. I made a few changes based on what I had in the house...I first sauteed the onion with some garlic and celery (I omitted the peas). I used 3 cans of tuna instead of 2, added a 1/2 cup of sour cream based on past reviews, and left the rest the same. It was definitely not dry, it was just right. Also, I didn't have potato chips, so I just used crushed Ritz crackers with a bit of butter, and it was just fine. Definitely a 5 star dinner!

Less is more. My normal recipe doesn't call for onions and definitely need to use French's French Fried Onions on top instead. It is very easy to throw together, especally for a week night and can feed quite a few otherwise.

I substituted fusilli pasta and added about half a can of milk but it still didn't come out as creamy as I'd like.  Next time I will decrease the pasta by about 3-4 ounces.

Liked how crunchy the topping came out.

I make this recipe a few times a month for my family and it's always a big hit!! THis recipe is so versatile, I have substituted the egg noodles for other pasta types (like bow tie) and have even substituted the tuna with two cups of cooked and chopped chicken breast or turkey breast. This recipe NEVER disappoints!!

This was a really good, creamy recipe. I did not add peas as the family doesn't care for them. I did look at reviews and added sour cream and milk. Will try adding french fried onions on top next time.

This really is the best tuna casserole! I had honestly sworn off tuna casserole after the last time I made it and it tasted so awful, I threw it out. I love this recipe, though. Only change I made is I used 1 can COMushroom and one can COCelery, only because I only had one COMushroom. also I added a little paprika and garlic powder along with salt and pepper to add some flavor. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

A good recipe which we felt needed a few alterations...
1) sauté the onions with a tsp of kosher salt, 2 tsp of fresh cracked pepper and tbsp of olive oil.  Once the onions are getting soft, add the mushrooms and cook until they start to soften.  
2) add 2 cloves of fresh chopped garlic to the onions and mushrooms.  cook for 1-2 minutes until they become fragrant. 
3) OPTIONAL: Add 1/4 cup of vodka to deglaze the pot.  Be careful if working with open flames.  I cook the vodka, onions and garlic for about another 1-2 minutes.  
4) Add 1 tsp of dried parsley
5) Add 1/2 cup of sour cream for added creaminess 
6) Optional: use cayenne pepper to season... a little goes a long way.  Be careful not to over season
8) Follow the rest of the recipe according to JAICARDs instructions.

Excellant! Especially using tips from previous reviewers to increase liquid (milk) and add sour cream and red pepper. WOW!

I should have followed this as written.  Because of the comments about it being too dry, I did add some sour cream and milk -- and I thought it turned out too creamy.  I added a can of pimentos, which added to the flavor and color.  To keep this easy clean up, I sauteed the onion in the same pot I cooked the noodles in while the noodles were draining in the colander, then mixed everything else in and put it in the oven.  We don't like toppings on our casserole, so just used the extra cheese on top with a little paprika.  Next time I'll leave out the sour cream and just add a small amount of milk.  I think sour cream can "bland out" the true flavors sometimes.

I tried this recipe tonight and was concerned on the dry comments so I added a can of diced tomatoes and cilantro.  Spiced it up a little and was delicious!

Finally!!! a tuna casserole my husband and I both love!  Used 3/4 of the bag of noodles and added 1/4 cup each of sour cream and milk to make it moist. Also added a bit of garlic powder, paprika and pepper.  It was great!

This is just o.k. I did double the peas and added a little milk to thin the sauce a bit since it seemed so dry in the bowl. Not worth the high fat and high sodium. I'll look for another recipe.

This recipe is a huge hit with my family (two kids and a hubby).  I've made a few tweaks that make it even better!  for one, I use fresh mushrooms.  I saute the mushrooms and onions in butter before adding them to the recipe.  I also followed other posters' advice to add some sour cream, extra soup and milk to make it creamier.  All in all, this is a fabulous recipe!

Yum Yum! Simple and delish recipe however, I did make a few moderations: Instead of 2 cans of cream of mushroom, I used only 1 and added 1/4 milk + 1/4 alfredo sauce. I also used French Fried Onions instead of chips and spinkled with a thin layer of grated parmesan & mozzarella instead of cheddar.

I followed the suggestion to add more cream of mushroom. I used one of the "Family-Sized" cans. Left out the mushrooms and potato chips. It came out great.

Delish! I made it gluten free by using gluten-free egg noodles (thank you amazon.com!) and gluten-free cream of mushroom soup. Because GF cream of mush is fairly thin, I only used one can. Turned out great, and totally passed muster with my family, since only have of us are GF, we are continually on the prowl for recipes that make EVERYONE happy. This is one of them :)

This would have been LOADS better if I'd sauteed the onion first or simply left it out.  I'll give it another try and see how it goes.  =)

Made some changes to this recipe... Didnt have canned tuna so I used canned chicken, frozen mixed veggies instead of peas, added 1/2 c of milk as suggested by others.  Also added onion & celery, black pepper & minced garlic.  For the cheese I used cheddar & muenster.  Didnt have chips so I used French's fried onions as suggested by other user.

My accidental modification:  I didn't read the recipe closely before I went to the store, so I only came home with one can (98% fat free) of mushroom soup.  After reading others' reviews, I simply added a can's worth of (regular) sour cream.  I also added about 1/3 cup of (n/f) milk, because others had said the casserole was dry.  Also, I substituted bread crumbs for the potato chips and threw a little parmesan on top.

It turned out really delicious!  It didn't taste low fat.  I think maybe it was even better for having the sour cream instead of the 2nd can of soup -- it helped keep the casserole from having that "canned food" flavor.  And it was firm but moist.  I love onions and don't mind the crunch from raw or nearly-raw onions, but if you don't care for that crunch I'd suggest sweating the onions before baking.

This was a delicious recipe, however, it needed more liquid so I added about a cup of milk and it was perfect. I also used crushed corn flakes mixed with butter for a crunchy topping. I also sauteed the onion, mushroom (fresh sliced baby bella), and some celery before adding the noodles.

I didn't care for this recipe. I found it tastless and really dry. It did need some milk or water and without a doubt some kind of spice with it. Also the chips could be coated with butter. I feel like next time I will add some milk, more cheese, just a little oil or butter, and salt and pepper at the least. Thanks for the submission though if I would have read other reviewers comments to begin with it would have turned out better.

Made as is, except halved the recipe and skipped the mushrooms as opening a can seemed like a waste when it only called for a 1/4.  It was good, but a little bland.  Will make again with some tweaking to add a little zing.

It was ok.  I added a half cup of milk and it was still too dry.  Next time I would use a full cup of milk and switch from Cream of Mushroom to Cream of Chicken or Celery.  I used bread crumbs instead of chips and wouldn't do that again either.

I liked this recipe, very traditional-I would however add 1 1/2 cups milk to the mushroom soup to avoid the dryness.  I also added the cheese after 1/2 hour of cooking and then finish off cooking with topped cheese and chips, ritz crackers, french onion crunch and then cook for the remaining time.  For those of us that rate very negatively I highly suggest that you keep your opinion to your self it is not a productive review.

It was good but I took the onion and mushrooms (I used raw) and sauted them in a small amount of butter till the onions caramelized. Less cheese suits my family better too. Still overall pretty good.

This is a terrific tuna casserole.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I once substituted canned salmon for the tuna and it was very well received.

This was pretty good, not too difficult or time consuming and made quite a bit... Served with large biscuits and fed 5 people with leftovers at a reasonable price!  I added about 1 cup of sour cream, a little adobo seasoning and stirred in some french fried onion with the noodle mixture.  Then on top I used cruched up white cheddar Pringles mixed with some more crunched up french fried onions, and the topping was the best part... next time I will double it!  YUM.  Will surely make again!

i made this a few weeks ago and my family was kinda "blah" about it, it was the first and only tuna casserole i have ever tried or made. so i didnt want to give up on the idea of a cheap and easy dinner with tuna(my family LOVES tuna so i gave it another go around but this time i changed a few things instead of using a whole 12oz bag of wide egg noodles i used 6 oz macaroni noodles, boiled them and used only 1 can of cream of mushroom and a splash of milk, 1/2 cup of frozen peas added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, didnt add mushrooms. and used very finely chopped onions as the recipe called for and only one can of tuna. topped it with crushed potato chips then another 1/2 cup shredded cheese and it was so good!! it wasnt dry and it was the perfect amount for my very hungery small family! will make this version again!!!

I used one can of cream of mushroom and one of cream of chicken. I used a round 2qt dish and added 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of sour cream. Came out a bit too runny so I will just add a 1/4 cup of each next time.

I made this with a few changes and I was very pleased.  I started with using whole grain noodles.  I sauteed the onion, fresh mushrooms, and some celery in some evoo and s & p.  I also added about 1/4 c of sour cream and 1/2 c milk to the mixture to add more moisture.  It came out very creamy and delicious.  My husband ate almost half the pan!!  I really like adding the celery as it added a bit more crunch to the noodles.  I also had some crunch on top using french onions and a little extra cheese.  Yummy, fast, and nutritious.

This is so good...I made half the recipe and it was plenty for two.  I added frozen mixed vegtables instead of the peas and elbow macaroni instead of the egg noodles.

Like many other reviewers, I have been making tuna casserole forever. My base ingredients have always been the same to this recipe, and probably a bit less fattening, but I have to say that this one tastes much better! The 2 cans of soup, white onion and cheese really make the difference. I love the egg noodles since they are so light versus twists or tube pasta. I had cream of chicken and mushroom on hand and I think that flavor combo was great. I did mix most of the cheese in and then just used a little on top with a tiny bit of finely crumbled fried onions. I never use those, but since the original recipe called for chips I figured this was the same idea. It was so yummy. 5 stars for me. I am making my second batch today for a reunion potluck. I found that last time putting the casserole in the frig for a couple hours and then cooking it let the flavors set a while. It was a hit for adults and little kids.

Everyone in my family that likes this kind of dish loved it. It's not for everyone. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup. Instead of the peas, I added 1 can of artichoke hearts that I quartered.

It was good.  My husband liked the crunchy potato chip top.  I had added a dash of cayenne pepper and he thought that was a nice touch.  Our frozen peas came with diced carrots too which made it colorful and tasty.  I thought this recipe was nice and hearty but I'm hoping I'll like it even better as leftovers.  Additionally, I'm not sure I like the raw onion taste... may put less of it next time or cook it a bit beforehand.

this is a 3 star recipe before alterations, and a 5 star after some changes!  I added 1 8oz. containter of light sour cream, and 1/2 cup milk to the recipe, and it was a perfect consistency.  Not too dry or wet.  The sour cream gives it a nice flavor so it's not as bland.  I also mixed the majority of cheese in with the casserole, it would not be enough with just 1 cup.  And then I added a little extra cheese on top.  i also cooked the onions beforehand in a pan so they were soft.  You might need to add a little salt and pepper to this as well.  I used Ritz crackers on top only because I didn't have potato chips, but I'm sure the chips would be excellent.  After these alterations the recipe was wonderful!  Next time I will try 1 cup cheddar and 1 cup shredded velveeta cheese, I think that may add a nice flavor as well.

This is such a delicious, flexible recipe! If you like more tuna, add more tuna!  If you don't like peas, leave them out! If all you have is dried onions, they work fine. I particularly liked the cheese in it as my old recipe didn't have it.  I don't use peas or mushrooms as my kids won't eat them.  I leave them on the side.

I usually add a half cup or so of milk to keep it from drying out since the noodles often absorb more liquid as it bakes.
 
And I have tried it topped with bread crumbs, chips, or plain cheese (depending on what I have) and it's always good.  My favorite is to leave out the onions and top it with French Fried Onions instead.  The flavor and texture are wonderful.

I had to modify things a little because I had some of this and a little of that and not enough of the other!  I hate when that happens!  I used 1 can of soup, and added 3/4 a can of water, Panko bread crumbs (no chips in the house!), and a bit extra of mushrooms because I had fresh ones I needed to get rid of.  I usually try so hard to do recipes by the book, but I have been craving this for a WEEK!  It came out really good though, despite my screwing around with amounts of things!

Didn't really like tuna casserole, but this got such good reviews I had to try it.  Wow, very good.  Nicely surprised both myself and husband.  Made a few changes based on taste and other reviewers--replaced peas with frozen chopped broccoli, omitted mushrooms. added 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup mayo

Excellent. I added cup of sour cream and a can of cream of chiicken soup.  I also use sage and onion stuffing mix for my crust ( after I brown it with butter on top of the stove). My family begs for it constantly.  It a great peace offering when I do something dumb.

This surprised me!  It was actually really good!!  My only suggestion is to use a little less onion.  I love onion but it was a bit much in this.  I also added 1/2 milk because there were so many complaints about it being dry. I used a 2qt casserole dish instead of the 9X13.  Will definitely try this again.

This was delicious.  I did add salt, pepper and about 2 cloves of garlic.  I used a can of condensed cheddar cheese soup and a can of cream of onion soup instead of mushroom to give it more flavor.  I left out the mushrooms and used whole wheat rotini instead of egg noodles.  I didn't have any chips so I used french fried onion rings for the topping.  Will be making this again and again.  Thank you!

This came out so delicious.  I modified it a bit because of the ingredients I had on hand and the other reviews I read.  The modifications were: sliced fresh mushrooms, an additional can of soup (I used cream of chicken) and a half cup of milk.

Very good base.  I would give it 5 stars w/ these suggestions for health and flavor:

Use plain greek yogurt instead of more soup to make it a bit moister.  I used 3/4 c.  

Make your own cr. of mushroom.  Extremely simple, quick (we're talking 5 minutes) and MUCH better for you and those you love.

Instead of potato chips, I crushed almonds in the food processor.  Great crunch, when toasted on top.  

Thanks for sharing!

Delicious recipe. I love to find dinners that I almost always have the ingredients to prepare. I too like other reviewers baked in a greased 2 QT round casserole dish. I improvised with what I had which was a combo of sharp cheddar, velveeta and sliced swiss on top. I also didn't have any potato chips. I used part seasoned bread crumbs and french fried onions. Added about 1/4 cup milk and miracle whip after another reviewers suggestions. Added about 1 tsp of garlic powder. Mine wasn't dry at all but I did add milk and miracle whip so that could have helped. Overall great recipe. I did like the slight crunch of the onions and the addition of the can of mushrooms. I think it's great to find a recipe that you can modify based on what you have in your kitchen. You can't beat the price of what this dish costs to make.

My grandmother has always made tuna casserole and it was one of my favorite dishes she made. I have never thought of putting cheese in it. But I tried it and it was good! My kids liked this version much better!
A trick to stop some of the dryness, add some milk to the soup. It will help keep the pasta moist.

Very good,  I made it as the recipe outlined, as I don't like making changes to a base recipe until I've tried it once. Great comfort food.

Very good, I will make agian. I added more onion because our family loves the flavor. Followed the recipe to the T other than that. Will add a bit of salt and pepper next time before baking but other than that it is a wonderful recipe.

Great!  Some modifications I made: I added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 sour cream; sauteed the onions and fresh mushrooms; and instead of potato chips, I used French's Fried Onion - so tasty!

This is almost exactly my mom's recipe! Her's is awesome. The only difference is doesn't use onions and she uses cream of celery which I also prefer (I love mushrooms but don't care for mushroom soup), and adds a couple tablespoons of jarred pimentos. It's a good one!

I modified this recipe to be for just me and my husband - I used half the amt of noodles, tuna, onions, and cheese. I used the full amt of peas  and mushrooms. I used 1 can of soup but added a scoop of sour cream and a big splash of milk. I didnt have chips for the top so I used crush corn flakes. Turned out wonderful and my husband and I both loved it! We actually had enough to left overs too.

I took the suggestions of others, plus my own tricks, before making this and it came out wonderful. I used one family size can, which is slightly more than the 2 regular sized  cans. I added half a can of milk and half a cup of mayo. Also I baked the casserole in a smaller, but much deeper, pan to ensure that it comes out creamy.

Wonderful. Even my picky in laws really liked it (my father in-law is a steak & potato guy), and that's saying a lot! I didn't have peas, so I added chopped baby carrots instead. I made a huge pan of this casserole by adding more tuna, another can of soup, using a pound of penne ('cause that's what I had on hand), and buttered Italian bread crumbs with freshly grated parmigiano reggiano on top. I love how versatile this recipe is. You can add  and substitute so easily. Even if you're kitchen-challenged you can make this and make it great!

HOLY TUNA CASSEROLE......I hated this meal as a kid...and was reluctant to make it again UNTIL I READ THIS RECIPE.....this is SO GOOD....Everyone licked their plates clean....I took out the peas, added more mushrooms and cheese....on top I used the potato chips as well as the fried onions....I added a sprinkle or 2 of garlic and onion powder....and used Penne Pasta only because I didn't have egg....they worked just fine...If you are skert of Tuna Casserole like I was....TRY this recipe....it will change your mind...Everyone ATE IT in the family....including the cat.. :)

This truly IS the best tuna casserole! I've never been big on warm tuna, but each time I've made this, I've had 2 helpings. I follow the recipe as written except for the potato chips, because I don't usually have them on hand. I use seasoned bread crumbs instead. The onion and cheese really make this recipe the best tuna casserole I've ever tasted.

The epitome of comfort food and very tasty. I made it as directed except sans peas (I didn't have any). I also used low-sodium potato chips and it turned out fine.

Better than tuna helper.  I adjusted the recipe after reading reviews on it being too dry.  I added 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of milk as well as 2 tsp powdered chicken soup base and some pepper for additional flavor.  I also increased the mushrooms to a full can and sauteed it with the onion with 2 cloves of garlic and margerine.  Awesome!  My 13 and 15 year old sons both enjoyed it.

To combat the dryness and to make it like my grandmother did, I added 1/2 cup Miracle Whip to the soup mix before adding the tuna,etc. Adds moisture and a light tang. Great!

Quick and easy dish to make.  Will substitute onion powder next time for the onions.  They were too "raw" in this casserole.  Nice to make one from scratch instead of the standard Tuna Helper! Thank you !

This was soooooooooo good! The only thing I had no choice but to leave out was the potato chips since I didn't have any in the house, but this dish was so delicious I don't think that little detail even mattered.I don't know about this "dryness" other people were complaining about so much, maybe they overcooked theirs or something, but this was perfect. It was a wonderful meal. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was pretty awesome. I only had one can of mushroom so subsituted with one cream of celery & one mushroom. It was still quite good considering you could really taste the celery. I also didn't put the can of mushrooms & used french fried onions on top. It was great and will use again.

My husband said that this tuna casserole was better than his mom's! I made a few changes, but nothing major. I halved most of the ingredients for just my husband and I and it still made plenty. I added some green onion and celery. Increased the peas a bit. Since other reviews said the casserole was somewhat dry, I added 1/2 soup can of milk and a big dollop of fat free Miracle Whip. I also added some dill which was a noticeable and very nice addition. It made the flavor more complex. This is a keeper!

This recipe was super easy and from start to finish took about a 1/2 hr. I did not add mushrooms, onions or peas since my family doesn't like one or the other. I added the tuna and the water that it was packed in and also added about 1/2 cup of milk.Cooked in an oblong crock and it wasn't dry at all!! Used crushed Ritz crackers on the top instead of chips and loved it.

This is missing a key ingredient in my opinion, that is milk. I think it could have been mistakenly omitted even... but I won't ever find out because what was supposed to be a easy meal became a headache and I won't try it again. The noodles were chewy because there was not enough liquid in this recipe to cook them.

This was pretty good.  I didn't have 2 cans of cream of mushroom, so I substituted a can of cream of chicken and it tasted fine.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Use a good cheddar, not a pre-grated bagged cheese.  I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken (both low sodium), and added a cup of whole milk.  I made a bowl of topping out of maui onion chips, and let people put it on as they pleased, rather than baking it on.  This is the real deal!

Fantastic recipe.  I've made it twice and eaten it all in a couple of days.  It's definitely one or those recipes that's better on day two because everything has time to marinate in all the flavors.

This meal was awesome and so easy. I made a double batch and froze the second one to pop into the oven another night. The second round was as good as the first even after being frozen.

I love the good ol' standard tuna casserole, and this is it!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I omitted the mushrooms.  I also added 1 C. sour cream to the soups to combat the dryness problem, and I cooked it in a square 2 1/2 quart casserole rather than the 9x13.  This was delicious and is a perfect standby in the dinner rotation.

This is pretty tasty as far as tuna casserole can be.  My 20 mo. old grandson loved it.  He won't usually eat peas, but he ate this up.  I left out the onion and used Mrs. Dash's onion seasoning.  I also used Amy's Organic Mushroom soup with is not condensed, to was not too dry at all.

My family really loved this. Because some of the other reviews said the onions were too much, I microwaved the chopped onions before adding them so they weren't as strong, and I added a 1/4 cup of milk and it turned out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very very simple and easy to make. All it requires is opening a few bags and a few cans and you have a good tasting casserole for supper... I did add a 1/2 cup of milk as suggested by other reviewers to keep it moist and it turned out really well...

Everyone loved it at my house! I did follow another reviewers advice and added some sour cream and milk, as well as a little garlic powder. I also used frozen mixed veggies instead of just the peas. It turned out great! Very flavorful and it fed quite a bit.

I halved the recipe with no problem except accidentally added too much cheese.  Didn't seem to affect the final taste much.  I used colby instead of cheddar and added a bit more soup per the other reviews.  I also found that it needed covered toward the end and more time to get the middle hot.  Would omit the onion next time.  Overall, though, great dish!

Halved the recipe - only me and my husband. It was too dry. The taste was good. I'll add something to make it more moist next time - milk or sour cream.

Yummy, just like my grandma used to make it.  I sauteed the onions, in a little butter,  until tender and then added all the ingredients except the noodles.  I also added a little milk to get the consistency I wanted.  I slowly added the noodles and quit adding when they were all coated and not too dry.  The potato chips covered with the cheese made this casserole!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Really good tuna casserole.  I made some changes (didn't have potato chips, used bread crumbs) and moistened by adding 1 can of cream of chedder cheese soup rather than the 2nd can of cream of mushroom.  Saute the onions in butter first so they will not have an overpowering taste that some reviewers complained about.  Will definately make again.

I've tried at least 2 or 3 different recipes for tuna casserole - none were nearly as good as this!  Following one of the reviewer suggestions, I used 3 cans of soup instead of 2, and added 1/2 c of skim milk.  This casserole is excellent!!

I love this!  I read the reviews about it being dry, so I added an extra can of soup and nearly a can full of milk.  I like my casseroles saucy!  It turned out cheesy and satisfying, very good :)  I love the crunchy chips on top.

I've made this many times but would suggest that if you add a 1/2 +/- cup of evaporated canned milk to the soup mix gives it a richer taste and  a more moist casserole...also I always add 1 cup of cheese into the casserole for added moisture.  (One cup of cheese on top) ... :o)

I thought this was only OK.  I halfed the recipe except for the veggies because I love veggies, I added 1/2 cup condensed fat free milk and used breadcrumb/butter muxture instead of chips along with using all reduced fat products.  Maybe it was the reduced fat part that did it? I think the addition of garlic even just garlic powder and salt and pepper would have added more flavor.

I love tuna and just haven't found a great casserole until now. I will definitely make this over and over again. The title of this recipe suits it well. The only thing i changed was the topping. I used crumbled Ritz crackers instead of potato chips.

I've been making almost the same recipe for years.  It's my husband's and my favorite standby when we really don't feel like cooking.  Couple things I do - I have oven safe cookware, so I use my large skillet put everything together in it and just put it in the oven.  I too only use one can of soup, but add a cup of milk.  Plus, I used Penzy's toasted onions instead of chopping my own.  Since I don't care for the peas, but my husband does, I leave them out and he gets them on the side. I save some of the cheese (use sharp cheddar for the best flavor) to put on top with the Fried onions instead of potato chips.  We have this at least once a month or more.

This was very good. I followed other reviews and I sauted the onion and fresh mushrooms first and I also added a third can of cream of mushroom soup. It turned out very yummy! (I used two cans of reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and 1 can regular garlic cream of mushroom soup.) Great recipie!

CANNED MUSHROOMS!!!  Never. That's like adding sliced pieces of rubber.  Saute FRESH mushrooms in a little olive oil or butter, then add.  Much, much, better.

Great starting point!  :)  I made mine starting with this recipe, but made a few changes.  I used 1 can of cream of celery & 1can cream of mushroom instead of the 2 cream of mushroom.  I also added 1/2 a container of pimentos, 1 can evaporated milk, mixed veggies, and I didn't have any potato chips, so I did 2tbsp of butter w/ 3/4 c italian bread crumbs.  I also didn't have any egg noodles so I used roughly 2 c (dry) elbow macaroni (cooked). :)  It was great! :)

Tasted pretty good, fast and easy, too! I followed the recipe exactly the first time, liked the taste, but thought the casserole was a little dry. Next time, i used a family size (26oz) condensed cream of mushroom soup, which was a little more than the recipe called for, i got the creamy texture that i love! even when i heated the leftovers up the next day, it was just as creamy. I didnt have regular potato chips the first time, so i used baked lays, the chips browned way too quickly, should use regular potato chips that are nice and greasy, i did that the 2nd time, and it came out perfectly, creamy casserole with a crunch!

I have been trying to find a tuna casserole recipe that everyone enjoys. I think this one is it. It is so quick and easy, and even the kids like it! Who cares if I have to tell the 4 year old it's chicken! LOL

Sautéd onion & garlic. Mushrooms, sautéed. 1/2 chicken bouillon cube, optional depending on total salt. Thyme, dill or marjoram. Red pepper flakes.  Dash nutmeg. Sherry.  Omit the canned soup and use sour cream, yogurt, or cream cheese instead of a flour roux. Spinach. Now, add the Tuna - mix with pasta. Top with Cheddar and Parmesan, crushed potato chips (applewood smoked bacon!) and grated Asiago cheese. 25 mins @350.

I used this as a jumping off point, then did my own thing.  So, as it's written I think it would be bland and dry, but the tweaks make it. I omitted mushrooms.

I mixed one can each of cream of chicken & cream of mushroom; I added a can of evaporated milk. Spices:  celery salt, paprika and garlic salt.  Heated all this up then added the shredded cheese; making a great cheese sauce.  
Poured it over 3 cans of well drained tuna, rinsed frozen peas and my onions - which I caramelized. Seriously, there is nothing better than caramelized onions.  
For the topping I crushed up potato chips and dried onions.
This makes enough for a family of 4 to eat for two days, easily.  Even with seconds.  It's creamy and flavorful!

It is the Best.  When I drained the tuna, I saved the juice in a measuring cup, added milk to make one cup liquid, and made a white sauce, stirring it into 2 tablespoons of melted butter and 2 tablespoons of flour, while the cassarole cooked.  I served the white sauce over the cassarole.  Very good.  Be sure to crush the potato chips fine - they can be sharp after baking.

Excellent! The whole family enjoyed! However, I did alternate the recipe just a bit by adding an extra cup milk, extra can Cream of Mushroom, extra can tuna, and much less cheese. Very good even though my family is not especially fond of tuna dishes,.

Good base recipe but I made so many changes to suit our taste. As written, I could see that it would end up dry. I incorporated all the cheese which included Gouda and extra sharp cheddar, then added bit of white cheddar on top. I used fresh mushrooms but canned peas and added diced garlic. The onion, garlic and mushrooms were sautéed in butter. When mixing all the ingredients, I used a family size can of soup, and still found it to be way too dry. I added 1/4 a cup of sour cream and splashes of milk. Instead of potato chips, I used regular panko breadcrumbs sautéed in butter with chives and red pepper flakes. I tasted the mixture and it was bland, so I added salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and Old Bay. Once I had the mixture in the 9x13 dish, it still looked too dry so I splashed it with a bit more milk. Finally, I added the white cheddar on top, then the panko, and baked it for about 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Delish! It's definitely a grown up version of tuna casserole with added flavor and texture.

I am revising my review  I have  just made this  recipee  accept  I  used sour cream  milk and an extra can of soup ..I cooked this  at 375 instead of 425 for  30 minutes  and not only did it taste good but it was far from dry..I believe alot think baking at higher temps makes the  food cook faster but  instead it dries out  the food  usually  . it is better  to cook something slower and have it come out tasting greate then   aim to cook faster also keep in mind  tuna  soaks in  moisture  and also mushrooms are  like a spong  soaks in flavors very easily.. So I recamend  lowering the temperature  to now higher than 400F

this was very good and easy to put together. i made this in a spring pan because its the only pan i had available that would fit into my counter top convection oven. i followed the advice of a reviewer and added 1 cup of sour cream, i also used the whole can of mushrooms and added pepper to the mixture. the sour cream definitely helped it from over drying. will make this often, thank you for the recipe :)

Good recipe, we like it very moist with good flavor. I added sour cream did not have cream of mushroom soup- subbed c/o/chicken and c/o/celery. Did not want to boil the noodles before hand so added extra water to the mix. Also added a can of mixed veggies to make recipe go further. Also added onion powder, galic powder and pepper.Nixed the mushrooms and did not have potato chips so I used the fried onion topping. Everyone loved it.

I was really hoping this would be great, given all the great reviews, but I found it to be horribly bland.  I tried adding salt, pepper, garlic, and paprika, but it was still bland.

Even my 2- and 3-years olds LOVE this dish.  Using a can of condensed cream of mushroom, and a can of condensed cheese soup is what makes this a very creamy and thick dish.

I added a can of water chestnuts to give it more crunch (sooo good). This dish is soooooo good. All of your food groups in one. Made it more than once, and it was a success. Sooo yummy and comforting.

Easy, fast, and delicious, but a little dry.  I halved the recipe and used corn chips.  Next time I'll use potato chips as called for (it could have used the little bit of extra salt) and add 1/2 to 1 soup can of water (or twice that for a full recipe).

This was just OK for me...I felt it really needed more dairy product (half and half, sour cream?) to bring it to the next deliciously creamy level.  I won't abandon it. but I will definitely make more modifications next time.

So good and easy.  Any frozen veggie or short pasta of your choice will work well.  I did add a little milk and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Definitely needs at least an additional 1/2 can of milk.

I gave this three stars as written. The original recipe was dry and a little bland for my taste, but certainly provided a great base recipe. The second time I made it, I added an extra half can of cream of celery soup, 1/2 c milk, some garlic powder and lemon pepper and it solved those problems.

Great recipe for well balanced, quick meal.  I added 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup mayo.  Black pepper and  garlic seasoning with Amish egg noodles.  The crushed potatoe chips made the topping!!  Will be making again soon.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it wasn't one of my favorites. I think it needed to be creamier and the onions were crunchy. I don't know, maybe I did something wrong or skipped something. We ate it, but probably wouldn't be a go to recipe for us.

Very easy and fast.  I made half the recipe and the four of us had leftovers.  I added half a can of milk (I only used one can of soup because I halved the recipe) as suggested by other reviewers.  I little bland, but the family ate it...which makes it a keeper for us.

I love making this to get rid of ingredients in my fridge!  I usually throw in whatever frozen or fresh veggies I have on hand, and cut out the mushroom since my family doesn't like them.  I usually add about a cup of skim milk to make it a little creamier and not quite as thick.  Definitely use lowfat cream of mushroom soup - you can't taste the difference between that and the full fat version, so you might as well save calories!

This is my FAVORITE tuna noodle casserole.  I usually omit the mushrooms, as my husband doesn't like them, and instead of crushed potato chips I use French's fried onions on top instead - it's SOOOO good!

I doubled the mushroom soup seemed a little dry. I ate two big bowels I think I need a nap... this is good the chips you can taste in every bite I used Tortilla chips all I had... Impressive recipe

This was my first time to make this recipe. I dont knoe why this recipe was rated so high...I followed the recipe exactly how it said to and my casserole turned out dry. This recipe is missing flavor. Even after I added spices it lacked some cheesiness or something. This recipes flavor didn't turn out how I was hoping it would have. I finally added a little chicken broth and extra cheese to my prepared serving size bowl to try & help with the dry texture.  But needless to say,  there is just no helping a bad recipe! I will not be making this flavorless dish again!

Added an extra can of cream of mushroom (this one had herbs in it).  Put Ritz crackers on top bc I didn't have potato chips.  Could definitely do without the onion...just too overpowering.

This recipe ROCKS! I'm like the definition of a beginner at cooking and it was still super easy for me to make and it's so delicious (I'm eating it as I write this!). I read the other reviews saying it could turn out dry so I put in extra soup and extra cheese actually in the casserole. Either way, it's very savory and I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers for the next few days!

I found it a little dry but I cut the recipe in half so I probably over cooked it. Cook it for less time if reducing the amounts

Have never made tuna casserole and picked this recipe because of the reviews. Awesome dish!!! Had to add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup because it was so dry and the extra soup payed off. Came out FANTASTIC! Making again tonight!

I'm not really a fan of Tuna Casserole but since I had the ingredients on hand I thought I'd make this. It surprised me, it was really that good! The only change I made to this recipe was adding 1 tsp. of garlic powder and some pepper to the mix before baking it.

Overall pretty good! Very tasty the next day as leftovers too. I agree that it turned out a bit dry. Next time I make it I'll add an extra can of soup and use a cup and a half of cheese inside the casserole and just a half cup as topping...but I'll definitely be making it again!

My husband grew up on tuna noodle casserole but this was a whole new grown up version. A definite rotation on our family meal.

This was actually surprisingly good. I only had one can of tuna, but also had a can of crab meat, so I mixed the two. Added a bit more onion and used some cheddar potato chips we had in the cupboard. Also used farfalle instead of the egg noodles It totally turned out good,...the husband loved it!

this is a really good tuna casserole, i added garlic powder to mixture for taste, added milk and nearly 3/4c of sour cream to make it more creamy so it wouldnt be so dry. i also added crispy onions to the top (will leave off next time), added extra cheese!! really good, served with cheese bread and peas on the side

This is an A+ recipe!! I did have to modify only because I didn't have all items. I used a jar of Alfredo Sauce instead of the cr mushroom soup. I seasoned it up a bit with some dry onion, garlic powder and black pepper. Topped it all off with crushed BBQ chips. I know it sounds odd to add BBQ chips but it came out PERFECT! Everyone ate till they were full, and even my one child who claims to not like Tuna Casserole LOVED this recipe!

This recipe is delicious! Based on other reviews, I added 2 tablespoons light mircle whip and that helped to keep it moist for left overs (I made the recipe to bring as my lunch to work). I also added diced carrots, celery, black olives and becuase I'm health conscious, I omitted the bread crumbs and cut the amount of cheese in half. Add italian seasoning and a tiny bit garlic powder and it will even taste great cold!

Overall this recipe was just "ok".  I read the reviews prior to making this and I added some milk but it was still a little dry.  I made it exactly as the recipe said except I left out the onions.  This wasn't much different than the boxed Tuna Helper!  I added sour cream to my plate and that made it alot better!  On the plus side my 2 year old loved it and asked for more which is not like her!!

This was so tasty.  My husband wasn't too excited when I told him what was for dinner, he said he'd eaten tuna and noodles everyway possible.  Well, guess who went back for seconds??? :)  I also used more mushrooms (b/c we love them), and green beans b/c I thought I had peas but didn't.

This was great!!  I did make a couple of changes.  I used canned peas and added the juice.  I added 1 cup of plain yogurt (as a substitute for sour cream) and threw in some velveeta chunks. SCRUMPTIOUS!!!

We love Tuna "hotdish" as we call it in Minnesota.  My recipe omits the onion and mushrooms.  To make it creamier, add another can of soup:  I use one cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken.  We prefer Albacore Tuna in large packet.  Add about 1/4 cup of milk and a teaspoon of "Better than chicken boullion"  mix it all up really well in a round casserole dish and skip the cheese on top of the chips.

I think it was way too bland, I changed the ingredients a bit (green onions and celery) to add more flavors but it did not make it...maybe I will keep changing the ingredients to get what I want...

A very good and tasty casserole.  It definitely requires more liquid so that the only crispiness is the cheese and chips on top.  I also added a little salt & pepper to the mix before I put it into a baking dish.

Absolutely delicious! I did add extra liquid (milk) but I don't consider this change to be a deal breaker. Some people would have complained if the recipe had called for more liquid.

Will definitely never put another box of tuna helper in my cart again, thank goodness!

I started off using this recipe but I didn't have frozen peas so I used 1 can of peas, some people in my house don't like mushroom so I didn't use them, and I used dried minced onion instead.

made this tonight and it was a winner!  I did take the advice of one of the reviewers and sauted the onions first.  Plus I used two cans of the condensed cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery, come cream cheese and a little dash of milk.  I also heated everything up in the micro before adding the noodles.    Everyone loved it!   Thanks Jaicard!

I love tuna casseroles.  Instead of cream of mushroom soup, I used Golden Mushroom soup, added a dollop of sour cream for a little zing, and French Fried Onions as the topping.  outstanding!!  This is by far my favorite cooking website!

A good, basic, easy to fix weeknight dinner!  And very kid friendly - the two year old and the four year old gobbled it up.  Next time I might add a little garlic powder or similar to give it a little kick.

This was very good. The only change I made was to add a jar of ready made Alfredo sauce. It made it creamy and helped with the dryness other reviewers mentioned.

I have never had tuna casserole before, I made this one, and the family loved it. I added what other people mentioned, some milk, sour cream, and mayo for the zip, and I personally love mushrooms so i used fresh sliced mushrooms that I sauteed, and I also sauteed the onions. I also used young sweet peas instead of regular peas, the kids like them better because you don't even know your eating them. I used PANKO bread crumbs with melted butter and garlic toasted over stove top for the toppings. Thank you all for the wonderful advice.

I was skeptical about this, as the recipe calls for no seasoning and sounds a bit bland.  It really was.  I'm going to make it one more time to try to add some kick to it, but overall I have no idea why this is so highly rated.

My family loved this and it was so easy! I had to make a few changes based on what I had available though, I used canned peas since I didn't have frozen and I used one can of cream of celery soup and one of cream of mushroom. I also subbed crumbled crackers instead of chips. I used up all my onion the night before so I just used some onion powder instead and I added Lemon Pepper just because I really like it! Wonderful recipe though!

Very good and so easy to make using whatever ingredients you have on hand.  For instance, I didn't have tuna or cream of mushroom soup, but I did have canned chicken and cream of chicken and herb soup, so I used that.  I added two soup cans of milk so it was in no way, shape or form, dry at all.  I didn't have potato chips either, but I did have mini tater tots, so on the top those went.  Picky son is gobbling it up as I type.  Don't forget to soften the onions before adding.  Thanks for a great idea!

Great recipe!  It made a lot for us but no problem as I put in smaller containers and froze to have for later lunches.   Would make again and probably add some milk like others did as it did seem a bit on dry side.

I accidently grabbed an 8oz package of egg noodles for this and I'm pretty happy I fell short on noodles... this was just right after adding about half a cans worth of milk plus a few tablespoons of sour cream I needed to use up. Anymore noodles and this would have been too dry like others mentioned. I used fresh mushrooms (not a fan of the canned ones) and added some garlic to mine. This was simple and easy to make, the only thing id change next time is id use all the cheese in the casserole, instead of using half on top with the chips. Thanks for sharing

Can't get better than this for tuna casserole.  I used frozen mixed vegetables because that's what I had and they actually gave a nice flavor mix!

I added red peppers, and used jalapeno chips instead of plain potato chips making it a spicy tuna casserole. Yummy!

This was a simple, tasty recipe.  I liked the fact that it was really easy to put together.  The potato chips add a yummy flavor.  The only thing I did different was add a little milk to the soup mixture because it seemed that it would be a bit too dry otherwise.

Very dry, I added milk and an extra mushroom soup. Still to dry for my taste. Also, onion was a little much. I added mustard for a little kick!

Normally, I love tuna; however, this recipe did not sit well with me when I made it.  At some point, I will try it again, but not for awhile.    I found each of the ingredients to be great by themselves, but for some reason, when I put them all together, it just didn't work for me.

Mmmm....I love tuna casserole.  I replace the potato chips with bread crumbs, and was pleased. I also add more cheddar cheese to the top below the bread crumbs!  This has become one of our staples :)

I added a can of milk because I substituted cream of potato for the mushroom soup. (The potato soup is thicker than mushroom soup.) I also added a 1/4 cup of mayo for extra creaminess. Turned out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

Added 1 cup milk and sustituted crackers for the chips.  Also added a liberal amount of salt and pepper.  Good consistency, but bland flavor.  A step up from tuna helper.  I will make this again, but will use evaporated milk, fresh sauteed mushrooms and more salt and pepper next time.

I normally don't really like to make tuna casserole with "cream of" soups but I had no milk in the house tonight so had to resort to the can!  I saw some reviews saying this was dry so I added in a 1/3 cup mayo and it was not dry at all.  i sauteed the onion in butter and added in some chopped red pepper as well.  I turned out very well.

This was my first time trying Tuna Casserole. I didn't like it, neither did my husband or my 2 year old. I think it just didn't appeal to out taste-buds. Everyone else who rated it, liked it. I tried it and it didn't work for me.

This casserole is the best of it's kind I've ever had!  I followed the recipe except omitting the canned mushroom and added about 1/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Also I sauteed the onions to downplay their flavor.  Very moist and cheesey, just the way it should be!

This casserole really surprised me, I honestly thought it'd just be "Okay" but it turned out great. I substituted one can of cream of mushroom for one can of cream of chicken and when I added the peas they were completely frozen so after the dish was baked they were perfect. The chips and cheese were great on top and my dad told me it reminded him of a pot pie, I'll make this again for sure.

This turned out good but I decided to change up the recipe some after reading people's comments. Instead of onions, I used shallots and sauteed both the shallots and (fresh) mushrooms in butter. I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. Also added half a soup can of milk and a few spoonfuls of sour cream as well as seasoned the mix with garlic pepper.  Instead of potato chips, I used french fried onions for the topping

This is so good. Definetly better than the traditional Tuna Helper version. I made recipe as is but didn't add peas (because my bf doesn't like them), added just a scoop of miracle whip (adds little zip), and a little milk (like previous posters). People were saying that it was dry but mine wasn't at all. I will make this again.

Used cream of celery soup, added onion powder and omitted diced onion, couple dollops of sour cream to avoid the dryness other reviewers mentioned, topped with bread crumbs & a few pats of butter. This is a very basic recipe that can have all kinds of variations and still be darn good :)

This was great. I did make it healthier though. I used yolk free egg noodles, reduced fat cheddar cheese, 98% fat free cream of mushroom, and baked ruffles. My husband loved it and I can't wait for the leftovers tonight!

This is exactly what I was craving for. I tried another tuna casserole on this site and it was a dry disaster. This was great with some minor modifications. Added a can of milk, left out the onion as a personal preference, added garlic powder and parsley, used penne because that's all I had and cooked in an 8x8 instead of 9x13.. Also, instead of using potato chips, I used bread crumbs and pour a little melted butter on it.

This was great! The peas were a bit excessive for my personal taste, but that's because I'm not fond of them to begin with. I ALMOST followed the recipe to a tee except that I didn't have mushrooms, so unfortunately, my casserole had none. I do love mushrooms, so I can't wait to try this when I have them!   Oh, and I also used crushed BARBECUE potato chips because it was the only thing I had on hand. I thought the flavor went very well with the casserole. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

After reading some of the reviews, i was nervous to try this for fear of bland, overly dry casserole. But, it was awesome! The cheese was a great addition! I baked the casserole for half the time and stirred it before adding the potato chips and remaining cheese. With other casseroles, you add the final layer at the last 5 minutes to prevent it being too crunchy. The boyfriend and I thought this was great21

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious!  I had some minimal modifications but I don't think they would have changed the flavor of the original dish too much.    1) I made half the recipe but it was still huge and could feed 6! 2)  I followed everyone's recommendation to add some milk 3) added chopped fresh mushrooms, celery, and carrots since we like veggies 4) I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic since I didn't have the plain mushroom handy. 5) misread the recipe and mixed the cheese in with everything instead of using it as the topping.    Eazy recipe and I highly recommend it!

yum yum, as others suggested I added some milk and sour cream to make it more soupy and 1 more can of tuna. I also chopped up some carrots and celery to add to it. It was very good everyone in the house including myself had seconds!

This was my first time making a Tuna Casserole and it came out EXCELLENT! I did add a cup of milk to ensure it came out moist. I did not have peas on hand, I had asparagus, so I used that. Very easy to make and very yummy for the whole family!

So I made this tonight....I followed others comments, I used an extra can of soup. Also, I only had one can of cream of Mush....after that I used one can of golden mush, and one can of cream of celery. I was heavy on the onion and dropped in a heavy tablespoon of Sour Cream to boot. I had no peas on hand so used frozen corn. Topped with sour cream and cheddar ruffles and more than one cup of cheese.....ohhh and one more change that I forgot about....I had no egg noodles on hand, so I used elbows instead

I really enjoyed it. However, I would suggest cooking 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup mixed with 2 cans of milk over the stove-top first. I also added  2 cans of drained peas , the 2 cans of drained tuna, the cheese, and a whole bag of chips to the soup mixture.  And of course, the onion and cooked noodles. Then, I baked as instructed. It was really good and not dry at all!

it is like one I call the 1940's bridge lunch, but that one used potato chips instead of noodles and also hadded hard boiled egs and pimento,   Growing up with it makes it  comfort food.  I now use unsalted potato chips.

This was really good!  I did make a few changes, though:  1/2 c less cheese (and I used reduced fat cheese), I used 3 oz of fresh crimini mushrooms, and I sauteed the mushrooms with the onion in canola oil until they started to carmelize.  I also didn't use the potato chip topping, just topped it with the cheese.

This was really good! I was just making this for myself, so I made the following changes bases on serving size and ingredients on hand: I used 1 of the small cans of tuna (3oz.), 3/4 can of cream of Chicken(had no mushroom), about 2 cups noodles cooked, and I eyeballed the cheese- about 1 big handfull.. I skipped the veggies, and replaced the onion AND chips with French's French fried onions. That was a great substitution that gave some crunch and flavor, without the overpowering of uncooked onions. Baked it in a small corning ware dish 15 mins, it was wonderful!

That's what I'm talkin' about--to me, it's not tuna casserole unless it has potato chips on top!  I like all the add-ins (onions, mushrooms) and if it's too dry, just add a little milk.  I like mine soupier.  Great classic recipe!

I didnt have egg noodles so I used small shell pasta. As I boiled the pasta I sautee the onions in a bit of butter and oil- and then followed through with the rest of the recipe. I buttered a deep pie dish and was able to fit it in there-

I sauted the onions first, and mixed all of the cheese into the casserole instead of adding some on top. Because of the reviews that said it was too dry, I added 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup sour cream, and a bit of pepper too. I used crushed ritz and melted butter for the topping istead of chips because I didn't have any.

yum!! i don't know why someone gave this one star, all i can think of is that she did something very, very wrong. :D this was quick and delish. i used colby cheese instead of cheddar, and 1 cup half and half instead of cream of mushroom soup. i also added 1 clove of minced garlic and 1/2 tsp of salt. it was great! although i think it could have used maybe 1/2 cup more peas [and this coming from someone who doesn't really care for peas].

This quickly became a family favorite. Everyones favorite part was the topping and it was a big contest to see who got plenty of topping with thier serving so now I make an extra tray of just topping so there is plenty to go around!

Made the recipe twice.  Changes I made:    1.  Added 1 cup of s. cream  2.  Sauteed onions, will be crunchy of you skip this step.    3.  Used fresh mushrooms and sauteed with onions  4.  Fresh Garlic added to sauteed veggies  5.  Ritz crackers instead of potato chips  6.  Dash of cayenne, dried thyme, pepper and salt    The dish would be pretty flavorless without the garlic and spices, especially since there is no pepper in the recipe.  My husband is a big fan of casseroles, and I have learned to live with them... there is another recipe for this casserole made from scratch and I think I might try that next time.

This is definitely one of the best tuna casseroles I have ever eaten. I am allergic to mushrooms, so I used two(2) cans of cream of broccoli soup as a substitute for the cream of mushroom soup. Turned out perfect. My family eats it up, every last bite... You can pretty much use any vegetables that you like, as well as less or more cheese. We like ours with extra crust, so we use two(2) cups of crinkle cut potato chips. We also like to use frozen corn instead of peas, we've also tried mixed veggies. Everytime it comes out perfect!!!  Thank you for this delish recipe.... =D

It was great, but I also made some modifications.  I added 1/2 cup extra cheese and put it under the chip topping.  I also added 1/4 cup of milk so it wasn't dry.  I cooked it in a casserole dish also.  With these modifications it was a 5*.

I noticed that many are complaining about the dryness of this dish. Ever since I was little my mom mad tuna casserole. She added milk to hers to keep it moist. I have used milk in mine ever since. When I saw this recipe, it looked really good. So I made it and added 1/2 to 3/4 cup milk and it turned out wonderful.

Great recipe!  The only change I made was to add 1 soup can of milk to avoid it being dry and 1 tsp each of garlic and onion powder.  It turned out creamy and delicious.

You have to cook the onions first! 20 mins in the oven is not enough time to cook raw onions. 
I saute them in olive oil for a minute, add fresh chopped mushrooms for a minute, then add the frozen peas and sauté until the onions are almost see-through. Then you mix veggies with noodles, tuna and soup in your casserole dish. I always top with Sea Salt & Vinegar chips (Miss Vickie's). Also, I only cook the noodles for half the regular time, otherwise they get soggy. I often forget the cheese and it's still great. 
Sautéed celery is also a delicious addition. 
You can add a pack of onion soup mix or use it as a topping instead of chips. 
Leftover kale chips have been a good topping as well, and a healthy addition. 
I forgot to cook the onions once and it was horrible. I don't know how so many people have been liking it like that.

I made the recipe for dinner tonight and my husband thought it was great.  He went back twice after the first plate.  I did take some suggestions from other reveiws and added milk.  I think I added around a cup.  I also added salt because I tasted the mixture and it was a little bland.  I used Campbells golden mushroom soup.  I also added around a teaspoon of curry powder. I like the tast because I have used it in chicken casserole dishes.  I did not have any mushrooms but didn't missed them.  I used a combination of crushed potato chips and townhouse crackers.  I covered with foil and baked since some reviews recommended it.  Overall I will definitely make this dish a definite future meal option.  Thanks for sharing.

Really good!  I left out the cheese to cut down on the fat content and it still tasted great with the addition of a little salt.  Thanks for sharing!

I had originally found this recipe on Iwon.com 6 years ago. It was Delicious.
It truly is the best tuna casserole I ever made. However, I substituted Baked Lays Potato Crisps for the potato chips. I am going to make it again this weekend.

Great recipe for a quick last minute meal!  I read more reviews after putting this in the oven and was worried because I hadn't added the extra milk as suggested.  It was fine, but will definately add 1 can of milk next time.  I did not have mushroom soup, so used 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of chicken, and used baby carrots instead of peas.  I also left out the mushrooms. (5 PICKY eaters!) This was an absolute hit!  4 out of 5 went back for seconds!  Definately a keeper!

wonderful recipe!  I use fresh mushrooms and omit the potato chips (un-necessary!) and it's always a hit!  Also reheats wonderfully for lunches and leftovers!  Oh, and I also add 1/2 cup of sour cream to thin it out a little, and add a little extra tang!

Having read the reviews, and seeing how dry it was just with the mushroom soup, I too added 1/2 cup of milk.  My kids, ages 13 and 16, didn't like the casserole at all, and my husband and I just felt it was "okay."  I won't be making it again.  I'm very surprised it's gotten such consistent rave reviews.

Very easy and tasty.  This is a great meal to make if you don't have a lot of time or energy.  I followed some of the variations the other reviewers gave;  I added some milk to thin it out and mixed half the cheese into it and put the last half on the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Also, instead of using potato chips, I used French's fried onions and it was good.  Will make this again.

This casserole is wonderful!!! I was making plain old pasta for lunch, saw this recipe, and decided to try it! It was very quick and easy. I added black olives and omitted the onions and it was wonderful!!! Thanks for the recipe Jennifer!!!

This Tuna Casserole recipe was well received by our family.  I cut the onion quite fine because I questioned whether it would cook in the casserole.  I used snap peas for a crunch and added some Cayenne pepper.  I only made a half recipe, however would make again with the full recipe for a larger group of 8 people.

The basic recipe is good but, I do doctor it a bit and make it better! I sauté the onions in butter then add garlic and fresh mushrooms. To the mushroom onion mixture I add Worcestershire sauce and a little A-1. I also add sour cream to the recipe to make it creamier. I like topping the dish with either Ruffles All Dressed or Tim’s Cascade Salt and Vinegar chips. Yum yum!

Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the amount of tuna and substituted one of the cans of mushroom soup for a can of condensed milk so that the casserole wasn't dry. Also used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar so it doesn't overpower the taste of the tuna.

Delicious. I too made a few. Changes. I did an extra can tuna, 3/4 cup milk, 1 cup pea, 1 cup super sweet corn, ghost pepper salt, and salt and vinegar chips instead of regular. It was fantastic!

Like some other reviewers, I agree that the raw onions were a bit harsh. So second time around I sauteed the onions and the problem was solved. I also added 1/4 cup of milk which helps to ensure that the dish doesn't dry out. Overall, this is a great dish when you don't want to employ any effort!

This was awesome! Made it in a 9x13 dish, added a cup of milk, cup of sour cream, Italian seasoned bread crumbs on the top (didn't have potato chips), salt, garlic powder, black pepper, sautéed onions and celery with one can of cream mushroom soup and the other was cream of celery. Huge hit. Will be making again and again.....

No mushrooms on hand, so I added a cup of assorted frozen veggies. Substituted with rotini noodles. Decided to bake it for 15 minutes in cast iron skillet. Cheese melted perfectly, kept everything moist. Great flavor!

I am not a fan of tuna casserole but I decided to try one last time.. I did saute the onion and mushrooms in butter and garlic.. I made a sauce with all of the cheese, butter, soup and evaporated milk. Added a little pepper and the tuna with the juices then peas.. I baked it at a lower temp..350° for 30.. It was amazing!! Will be making this again!

I just made this today and it was delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 2 1/2 cans of mushroom soup and did not drain the tuna.  My teenage girls loved it.  I will difinitely make it again.

With the Arctic blast moving in I didn't want to go to the store for the mushroom soup so I improvised. You'll need 1.5 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of half and half, (if you don't have half and half use 2 cups milk) 1/2 cup chicken broth or 2 tsp. chicken base to 1/2 C water, 3 Tablespoons regular flour, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 3 Tablespoons butter, 6 oz can of mushrooms (sliced), salt an pepper to taste. Combine butter and flour to make a roux, whisk into the chicken broth and milk mixture until all the lumps are gone. Slowly heat in adequate size saucepan by adding the remaining ingredients whisking as you go. Cook on med. heat, stirring as you cook until desired thickness. The rest of the above recipe I followed to the letter.  
*If the mixture is too thick add more milk or water. Too thin, add 1 Tablespoon flour to 1/4 C cool water, whisk and add to mixture.

I usually don't write reviews about recipes but I felt this one merited one. With a few modifications, this recipe can be a real hit. Super easy to make. I took notes from other peoples suggestions and sauteed the onions in a little bit of butter, added some garlic to the onions and threw the peas in there so they would absorb some of the flavor. I also added about 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip to the recipe. This made a huge difference.  I also added bread crumbs instead of potato chips. I didn't have to add milk to mine. If you add enough Miracle Whip, you will get the tangy flavor and it won't be dry My husband who is not crazy about Tuna, absolutely loved it and had thirds!

Followed some of the other reviewers and added 1/4 c. sour cream and cut down on the noodles 5-6 oz. instead of 12 oz. plus I added some dill weed.  Used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery.  It was creamy and delicious.  Haven't made tuna casserole in a long time but this will be a go to dish.  Thanks.

Really good, but I added a spoonful of sour cream and a half a cup of milk based on all the reviews that said it was too dry. It still could have been creamier at least for me, and I will probably use bread crumbs instead of the potato chips, as they made it a lot saltier! But I will make it again:)

Loved this recipe! It is my homes favorite ! I added 1/2 cup milk and some Kraft sliced cheese on the top with the chips and I sauteed half a sweet onion in butter. It came out absolutely delicious!

Excellent and super-easy, just like Grandma used to make. ! Put it with a side salad and you have a quick, mid-week dinner. 
The only changes I made were that I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them briefly with the onion. Also, I use gluten-free rice pasta instead of the egg noodles. I will definitely put this in my "make again" file.

I had a very similar recipe from a 1950's cook book, that I have not been able to find, so I was happy to find this one. This is a good stick to your bones casserole, & great for folks on a budget. I took advice from other reviews and used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup milk. I also mixed the 2 cups of cheese into the casserole.  Next time I may go with just 1 cup of cheese, because it was still a little on the dry side. Paprika sprinkled on top and mixed in may give it a nice kick. Overall, a very good recipe, I will definitely make this one again, I really enjoyed it, thanks for posting. Taking leftovers for lunch tomorrow :-)

I just made this for my family and our two friends. there were six of us and I was afraid there wouldnt be enough but there is plenty! I added more cheese than it called for and filled half of a can of the cream of mushroom with milk and added it to it. Everyone really liked it! Oh I also used the tuna in the pouches so it wouldnt have that metallic taste. The potato chips were an awesome addition. It wasnt dry at all.

This is a good recipe,however I have made lots of adjustments which I think make it better. I use cream of celery soup, a can of peas and carrots, half a jar of pimento's, 1/3 cup of milk and velvetta cheese which I cut into cubes and mix in the casserole. ( I also omit the onion and mushrooms)  I did try the original recipe, there was just not enough flavor and it was a little dry.

Definitely add extra milk, sour cream, etc because it does get really dry.  If your peas are not frozen, you only need to bake this for about 10-15 min to heat up the soup mixture.  It's good, but still missing something . . . more cheese?

I pretty much haves used the same Ingredients for years ... Except I use fresh baby Bella mushrooms and I add 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 VIPs half and half... Also I add I can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.... The cream of chicken meshes better with the cheese and I only add one cup of cheese total. I use Panka Bread crumbs  instead of chips and crackers... It is never dry... Even when reheated :) Creamy and delicious!

I thought it was ok, but my husband didn't like it at all.  I adjusted the recipe after reading several reviews. Added milk, more soup, sautéed the onions, seasoning.   I think the biggest problem was the amount of noodles. If I ever attempt this recipe again, I'll use 6 oz- 8 oz of noodles instead of 12.  Too many noodles and bland flavor per my husband.

This is the ultimate comfort food.  Definitely use 3 cans of soup, not 2.  I add pretty much as much cheese and chips as I want ;)  Only took 15 minutes for me. Good hot and cold, and tastes even better leftover!

Made this tonight as it was a snowny day up here in the Pocono Mts. Great comfort food recipe. Made some homemade crusty bread and tossed salad to go with it.
This is the best Tuna Casserole I have every made...The potato chips top it off!

It was a yummy dish. I used a little bit more cream of mushroom soup as advised by other reviewers. Instead of two 10.75oz cans I used one "family size" 26oz can. I found the casserole to be plenty moist and not dry at all. If I make this again I will probably ad a bit more cheese mixed in, and bake it at a lower temperature for a longer time. 
I normally use Italian bread crumbs as the topping for my tuna casserole, but went with the potato chips this time. My husband and I both agreed that we like the bread crumbs better. 
The only thing I really did not like, was the onions. I'm usually an onion fan, but with the short cook time in this recipe my onions did not cook at all, and they were still totally crunchy and very potent. In the future I will probably use onion powder.

This is really good. I did however, saute the onions first, used about 1 cup of milk in the mixture, and added cayenne. Delish!

I was looking for a new way to make Tuna Casserole and decided to try this one.  This was a hit with my family.  The only change I did was omit the mushrooms due to my kids not liking them.  Thank you for sharing this.   --Ruthy

I use whatever noodles I have in the house and whatever cheese as well.  I've had cheddar, mozzarella and Parmesan and it always turns out well. I mix all the cheese into the casserole and then top with bread crumbs.  I think mixing all the cheese in helps with it being dry a bit.

For a tuna casserole, its 5 stars, but for my tuna/pea- fearing family, I have to rate it a 4.  Made exactly as described except just sprinkled in a few peas.  Good.

I've made this several times. I've used the pimento cheese with jalapeno vs. any other cheese. It gives it an awesome kick! I use kettle cooked jalapeno chips and no yolk egg noodles and a smaller package vs. 12 oz.  I increase the mushrooms too. I also recommend a round casserole dish vs. flat 9x13 dish, don't want the dish too dry. Add Sriracha before cooking or add before eating. I like it spicy! Lady Di

I made this recipe tonight and read several of the reviews before making it.  I sauted the onions first, but left out mushroom(we are not a big fan of mushrooms) I cooked egg noodles, then I mixed 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery- each with a can of milk.  I added cheese in the soup mix.  Then combined the soup mix with the egg noodles, tuna, and peas.  I topped it with crushed ranch croutons and a little more cheese.  My hubby definitely loved loved loved it.

Hmmmm...made exactly as written.  Seriously disappointing.  Nothing to write home about.  In fact, I should have just asked my mom for her recipe...and then posted it here because that's THE best tuna casserole.

I think with a little tweaking this recipe would be good. I like onion but next time I will either omit it or sauté it first as that was my biggest complaint. I did not taste enough of the tuna, I think it needs more tuna and maybe the cheese layered; it almost tasted like a mushroom and noodle dish. I used the 2 qt pan like some suggested and I think that is a mistake because then you don't get some of the crunchy top in every bite because the dish is so deep.

I only rated this 4 stars..since like others I made some slight modifications to the original.  But it was delicious and so simple to make!!
I added some sour cream to alleviate the dryness others spoke of..and cooked it at a lower temperature for about 20 minutes and it came out creamy and far from dry.
I omitted the mushrooms but loved the suggestion to add some cayenne pepper ...what a great little kick it added!
I always use sharp/old cheddar cheese as I love the stronger flavour..and i added it all into the main ingredients ..not in the topping
I used a Ritz cracker topping .. but that was what i had on hand ..and it was equally yummy..although now i want to try some of the other suggestions.
Overall, it would definitely make it again..and perhaps this time I will mix things up and try some new ideas.

DELICIOUS--with a few tweaks as suggested by other reviewers.  I also usually just wing it when it comes to making this casserole but my husband and family have never been huge fans.  I used 2 cans of cr. of mush soup, 1 can of milk, 1 full can of mushrooms pieces and stems so they were smaller pieces, I sautéed the onion in a little butter and dumped the whole thing in with the mixture.  I went a little heavier on the peas because my family loves them.  I also added both cups of cheese into the mixture (as was suggested) and used an entire sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers mixed into a 1/4 cup of melted butter over the top instead of the potato chips...my youngest loves Ritz crackers and it also gave the casserole just a small amount of sweetness that was delicious.  I baked for almost 45 minutes to make sure it was cooked through and bubbly hot.  My boys loved it and my husband ate so much he was uncomfortable afterwards.  This is definitely a keeper and will be on our regular dinner rotation of favorites.

I cooked the onions in 2 T of butter first then added the tuna for a minute. I then added the whole can of mushrooms, peas and soups and heated through. Then added noodles, sprinkled chips and more than a cup of cheese.

Great Recipe guideline for Tuna Casserole.  I improvised like I usually do.  For the 2 cans of soup... I used 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom and 1 can of Campbell's Cream of Celery. By accident, I added the 2 cups of cheese into the mix, so I shredded about 3/4 a cup more for the top and crumbled up jalapeno flavor kettle chips for the top (we like spicy foods in this house!)... To avoid dryness I added about 3/4 of a soup can worth of milk!  I skipped the canned mushrooms...  Tented with Aluminum foil for 20 min then uncovered for 3-5 (depending on cheese browness) It Came out Fantastic!   The flavor was nicely layered and the topping was both crisp and flavorful! :)  Definitely saving this recipe as a great guideline for next time since this is great with a little more moisture and fun to improvise!   Thanks for posting this one!!

I was looking for a good recipe for a Tuna Casserole and I found it.  I did add a cup of milk and put french fried onions on top.  My grandchildren ate up.  So did the adults.  I will definitely make it again.

This was perfect for a quick weeknight meal. I used canned chicken instead of tuna b/c of my kids. Sauteed some fresh mushrooms and added 1/2 cup of milk and some sour cream, plus some salt, pepper and garlic powder. Great comfort food! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recently and it turned out great. I took another reviewers suggestion and added extra cream of mushroom soup. I bought a 26 oz family size can and it was perfect. I was out of regualr potato chips and substituted it with sour cream & onion potato chips and it tasted great.

This recipe is the best!  It is perfect as is, but there are some things that I do to take it over the top! I use Trader Joe's Organic Shells and White Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese instead of egg noodles and that resolves any problems that you may have with it turning out dry.  Also it makes it very cheesy!  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

absolutely wonderful!  Used edamame instead of peas since we are south beach dieting right now.  Also whole wheat noodles, 2% 4 cheese blend and about a 1/3 c. lite sour cream. Fantastic flavor.  We have not had tuna casserole for years.  thanks for sharing.

my husband loved this and it was so super easy and quick.  I used cheddar cheese soup in place of the cream of chicken but that was the only change I made.  It was all gone before the night was over.

I made it a little healthier by substituting plain yogurt for one of the cans of soup.  I also used breadcrumbs instead of chips.  It was awsome!

I have a Tuina Casserole recipe similar to this. 
I use Kraft Mac and Cheese, prepared as directed on the box. 
Mix tuna with Cream of Mushroom soup, add fresh frozen green pears, sometimes sliced black olives together. 
I use crumbled Barbeque flavored potato chips. 
Layer in a greased casserole dish, starting with the chips, mac and cheese, tuna, repeat until done, top with the chips so they get crunchy.

I made this recipe last evening, and my husband had 3 helpings. It was very delicious. I too eliminated the chopped onions and added a cup of sour cream (I think next time I will add more sour cream). We didn't think it needed extra mushrooms. I will make this again, and will most likely make the recipe sometime with chicken instead of tuna.
Thank you so much for this delicious recipe:-)

Tried this tonight and could not have been more pleased, very very good.  Other than leaving out the peas (not a fan) I made it as is and it came out great.  This is easily going to be one of my favorites.

Really yummy! A great way to hide the fishy tuna flavor. I added and omitted depending on what I had on hand. I added 1/2 celery, and 1/4 milk to make it a little more saucy. I omitted mushrooms because I was out, but they would probably be a great addition. Also didn't have potato chips so added french onions! Yummy. You can really add and subtract with this recipe and still keep the flavor.

LOVED THIS! I have made this many times over and over! Even the two year old loves it, I have adjusted it to whats on hand - with or without the can of mushrooms, and always is a hit and for about $6 bucks your got a pretty good family meal. Also I usualy use 1 can of drained peas becouse I never have frozen peas. But it keeps really well for lunchs the next day and smells great cooking.

Wonderful, easy meal big enough to feed a large gathering.  After reading other reviews about problems with dryness, I simply added enough milk to "make" the two cans of soup.  It came out really well!

Thanks, JAICARD, for sharing this recipe.

Eh, it wasn't as flavorfull as i thought it would be, but i did make the changes the other reviewers suggested like 3 cans of the soup and 1/2 cup milk. Also instead of chips i used crushed up crackers and mixed with some melted butter and italian seasoned bread crumbs. Also i thought i had peas but it wasn't so i had to omit that.. i think next time i might fry the onion in oil on a pan a little bit, i didn't like the little crunchy onion. But i thought the soup was gonna add more flavor, but it didn't. I was disappointed. Myae i'll try adding the cream like the other viewer suggested.

This was very good. I grill fresh Ahi Tuna then set it aside while I make everything else. I use fresh mushrooms and 1 whole onion sauted in a little oil in the same pot that noodles are going to be cooked in. Take them out to boil the noodles. I also added 3/4 cup of sour cream and a little milk. This was NOT at all dry doing it this way.

A great base recipe, but me being me. i had to add my twists to this dish.  I used spiral noodels instead, I omitted the fresh onions for french's fried onions, I also went with cream of celery soup..  After reading about how dry it was i added a 10oz can of evaporated milk.. added a dash of sea salt and pepper for taste... Came out excellent!

This was a very easy and quick dish to prepare. The flavor was wonderful with the added 1/2 tsp of celery salt and corn flakes instead of the potatoe chips to cut down on salt.
The family loved it and will make it again.

Great comfort food recipe!  I lighten up this dish by using fat-free mushroom and celery cream soups.  Add a soup can and a half (if using 2cans of cream soup) for creaminess.  You will not be disappointed!

It was good and easy to make, but a bit on the bland side, unless you happened to get a good bite of the topping. Keeps well and makes good leftovers, especially after the addition of salt and a generous amount of pepper.

This was pretty good, but I have to agree with others that it needed a little flavor boost so I added a little Mrs Dash plus about 1/4c of milk and a big spoonful of sour cream (later changed to mayo, better) due to the comments about it being dry.   I suggest sharp cheddar in casseroles, better flavor when baked.  I didn't have chips on hand so I topped it with some French's fried onions that needed to be used up and that was fabulous!  I'll definitely make it again and experiment, great potential for adjustments to personal taste... it's been a long time since I made a tuna casserole and I did enjoy it.  My 17yo liked it just fine too.

My BF (who loves tuna helper) really likes this recipe.  My son gobbled it up too.  I left out the peas, added a little milk, and used crushed ritz on top like others suggested.  It's a winner.

This is a great recipe. As always I made a few changes. I used alfredo sause instead of the mushroom soup because the soup contains MSG. I also added the whole can of mushrooms because the other half would just sit in my fridg. I also added doubled the onion because we love onions. I had onion cheese on hand so that is the cheese that I used to top the casserole with. 
We enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great base recipe. Had to use fozen mixed veggies instead of peas, since that's what I had on hand.  Added some milk, to keep moist.  Enjoyed this & will make again w/ other variations.

Good.  A little on the dry side.  Like other reviewers I would use more soup.  My family doesn't care for cooked, frozen vegetables so I omitted the peas and served with steamed broccoli on the side.  I would make this again.

We used french onions instead of chips, and mixed veggies instead of peas.  The mixed veggies gave it a sweetness that the kids appreciated.  They ate this up and we barely had any leftover.  I will make this again and again!

Blech! The only thing tasty about this was the potato chips. Bland, expect for a weird taste from the combination of mushroom soup, tuna, and peas.

Not the best in my opinion.  The raw onion was not a good addition, and overall it was bland.  I think I'd use French Fried Onions in the mix, and Italian flavored bread crumbs on top.

This dish was a hit! Very easy to put together. I used 1 1/2 of all ingredients.  The only thing I noticed was I put a whole bag of frozen peas in and it was a bit too much.  The whole family loved it!! I will definitely make this again.

My family loved this recipe! I also added 1/2 cup milk and 3/4 cup sour cream. I sauteed the mushrooms and onions separate and added garlic salt & cracked pepper for more flavor. I served it with a side of bread and salad. It was the perfect meal for a cold and rainy night!

This definitely reminded me of the tuna noodle casserole my mom used to make. I used one can of fat-free cream of mushroom soup and a can of cream of celery. I added about half a cup of water so the soup mixture wasn't so thick. I also used panko breadcrumbs instead of potato chips to cut down on the fat a bit. I wouldn't say it was dry, but it was still a bit "thick" from the soup. Next time I'll use a little more water or milk. But overall, very tasty recipe.

Yummy comfort food.  I added a can of milk and forgot to add the peas so served them on the side.  I used a 9X13 pan and definitely think that the can of milk just saved it from being too dry.  If you like old fashion tuna casserole, this recipe won't disappoint as long as you add more moisture.

I really liked this recipe.  I used shells instead of noodles and added chopped celery.  I didn't have any potato chips so I used French Onion Rings.  My husband raved over it and it was so simple to make.

Not very good!!  Onions were still crunchy and too overpowering in flavor.  I couldn't really taste anything but onion after the first couple of bites.  It was a little dry.  Maybe the onions should be minced, instead of chopped.  I think I'll try it without onions next time.

Very good!  My boyfriend acted shocked and said "this is good".  I made a few changes.  I added bell pepper along with peas.  I only used one can of soup and instead of mushroom, I used cream of celery.  And then I added 3/4 cup of milk.  Also, I used whole grain spaghetti and croutons on top.

We keep it simple - no onions, no peas, no extra mushrooms.  Just pasta, tuna, cheese, and soup.  It's fast and simple and we always have all these ingredients on hand.

Delicious! Even better the next day. I used whole wheat egg noodles and just a tip-- use the packets of tuna instead of a can. Less draining involved and I find they have better flavor! I used one large packet for this recipe. The chips were a nice touch. I think it would be fun to be creative and sub in different veggies, which I will do the next time around. Definitely a crowd pleaser!

This was very good.  I didn't have any onion, so I left it out.  And considering everyone else's reviews, I added a soup can full of milk to help the dryness.  It worked perfectly and everyone really enjoyed it!

Good recipe! After reading other reviews I added a cup of sour cream to make it not so dry, I also added a tsp of Garlic powder but I'm sure it would be good without the changes. It's always a good feeling when the Fiance and his sister tell me it's better then their mom's Tuna Casserole...Automatic keeper!

A pretty good casserole.Funnnily enough, the only fish lover in the house didn't enjoy it. On the other hand, the kids ate it without complaint. Next time I might switch out potato chips for breadcrumbs/butter/cheese - leftovers are rather soggy. I did mix all cheese in the casserole and had no problem with dryness.

my mom used to make this. Like others she used a 2 qt. casserole. She also added a 1/2 can of milk to the mushroom soup & heated it on the stove before mixing with the noodles. This did 2 things 1- adding the milk kept it from being dry & 2 - heating everything on the stove distribuated the cheese throughout the casserole better. She also didn't add any potato chips, but it was always super yummy.

I read some of the previous reviews and made some changes. I used one can of Campbells healthy request cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery soup. I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mixture. It definitely needs salt and pepper added. Otherwise it is a good, simple tuna casserole.

This was dry, and I didn't care for the potato chip topping.  Would consider making again with more soup/milk for liquid and finding an alternative topping.

Ok- I added a can of tuna to this recipe and also added another can of cream of mushroom soup based on other posters' advice.  It came out TOO soupy for my liking.  I have made this recipe before as written and it was great but dry.  So, I suggest maybe another half a can of soup like another person said if you don't like your casserole soupy.  BTW my fiance loved it and I'm giving it five stars cuz it IS good and is one of the more simple recipes for this dish.  Give it a whirl!

I've been craving tuna casserole for about a week now and decided to give this one a go.  Followed the recipe except didn't have any chips or crackers to put on the top so I just cooked the casserole until the cheese on top crusted over.  YUM!  I did add some salt, pepper and a little cayenne to taste.  Definitely a keeper comfort food type recipe.  Thanks OP

I wasn't sure what me family would think of Tuna Casserole.  I loved it as a kid.  So, I tried it and they LOVED it.  I only had one cream of mush and one cream of chicken.  And I added a little milk for extra moisture.  I will make this again.

This recipe is delicious!  I used albacore tuna since the ingredients didn't specify, and it tasted great.  I took the advice of previous posters and used a little extra soup (3 cans instead of 2) and it was very creamy and moist.  I'll definitely make this again!

Great Dish, I did make a few changes, I added a cup of milk to the recipe to make it not so dry, lowered the cooking temp to 350 degrees, baked for 20 minutes, then put the cheese on top and substitued French's fried onions on the top for the potatoe chips, baked for another 10 minutes. Turned out great, a keeper.

Very good.  Will definitely make again.  The only thing different that I did was substitute crushed Ritz style crackers for the potato chips, and also substituted one can of Cream of Celery soup for one of the cans of Cream of Mushroom.

As others have mentioned, this casserole is tasty but dry. You absolutely need to add some more moisture to this (in the form of more soup, some sour cream or milk). I added about a cup of sour cream and a few dashes of milk and it was perfect. I also substituted green onions for white onion and it was yummy.

Love the potato chips!! It's just a little bland, so you may need to add a few more of your flavors from your spice cabinet.

This casserole was a little bland for me. It's got all the basics of a good tuna casserole and I liked the crunchy potato chip topping. I omitted the onions.

Really easy to make. It is really good. I add a little more cream of  mushroom, and it was not dry at all. I might add some hot peppers next time to add some flavor. Overall, a great recipe.

This was my first time eating tuna casserole, let alone making it. I didn't know what to expect -- onion? Cream of mushroom soup? Cheddar cheese? All mixed together with canned tuna? It all sounded less-than-appealing to me. But boy, was I wrong. This has an undeniable hearty, homey, comfort food charm to it. I halved the ingredients because I didn't have many mouths to feed, but I did heed the advice of other reviewers and added an extra can of soup and half a can of tuna. I also used a medley of frozen peas, carrots, and corn instead of green peas. Yum!

Never cared much for tuna casserole until now.  This really turned out good.  I always use reviews written by others to see what they suggest.  I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom.  Put 1 can of milk in sauce pan and melted American and Velveeta cheese.  Cooked onion in 1 tbsp butter.  Used 1 can peas and carrots.  No mushrooms.  2 cans of albacore tuna and 1 can packed in water.  My husband and I both loved the results.

Delicious! I sometimes add a small can of corn instead of frozen peas, and it's just as good. Personally I don't find it dry as long as you don't overcook it. This recipe is my go-to for tuna casserole.

Pretty good casserole.  My subs were whole wheat shells, fresh (finely chopped) mushrooms, salt and pepper to taste, and crushed Goldfish crackers instead of chips.  The family loved it--very tasty.

Excellent update of an old-fashioned casserole!!  I omitted the peas (the hubster doesn't like them) and forgot the onion, but I don't think it made any difference.  The cheese and potato chips make this SO yummy!!  Definitely add some milk...I added a soup can full...and it was not dry at all.  Thanks for a wonderful (and quick and easy!) dinner.  It's on my keeper list!

This is the best tuna casserole I have ever made and I will make this again. I did add 1/4 cup of mayo and a 1/4 cup of milk to add a bit of creaminess to it. I didn't add cheese to the top only because I misread the directions and added it all at once with the mixture, I doubt I would have noticed the difference. I also used saltine crackers which was good but next time I will use chips just to try the difference.

I used frozen egg noodles and cream of chicken instead of mushroom. Didn't add onion or peas. I had to adjust the recipe so the kids would eat it but they loved it and I'm sure it's delicious if made as the recipe is listed. Will be trying this again as it is listed!

Good. I added milk like others suggested to make more creamy. I used whole wheat noodles for a healthy option. I used a 3oz can of fried onions to top instead of chips. It was good the next day too!

Great recipe =) Put it much less cheese to make it lighter and didn't top with cheese either, also added a bit of sweetcorn to the mix. Loved it!

This was the 1st time I made a tune casserole, it looked gross but was good, I hope there's better out there because it was a little too salty in my opinion, must have been the cream of mushroom soup, maybe next time I'll use sodium-reduced.. Oh and my 2yo hated it :(

I make this often, and it is well loved in my house. I sometimes dont add sliced mushrooms, or the potato chips because I dont have them on hand. I have also made it without onion, and it is STILL good! The cheese is a must have. I like to sprinkle quite a bit on top. I sometimes add about 1/4 cup of milk just to make it creamier, it does cook up quite thick. OH I also just use regular noodles. Whatever I happen to have. AND I use a cup of mixed frozen vegetables. It goes very well with it!

This was pretty good. I noticed that the finished product really needed a healthy dose of salt and pepper to make it really yummy. It also looked dry before I cooked it so I added 2 cups of milk, half a cup of water and half a cup of plain yogurt. It turned out the perfect consistency for us (I like  creamy sauce). We'd make it again with these modifications!

I made this casserole tonight for a meatless super/potluck hosted by our church for lent. I added extra noodles, an extra can of tuna, an extra can of soup, and about 1 cup of milk to the recipe as per other reviewers' suggestions. I used onion and garlic powders to season. It made a HUGE batch and there was NOTHING left. Everyone loved it! I will definitely be keeping this recipe to use again! Thanks!

This is a good basic recipe and I've been using something similar for years.  I leave out the can of mushrooms, cheese and peas.  Try adding a bit of chopped celery, finely chopped green olives and about 1/4 cup milk.

This was very yummy!  I made the following changes according to our personal tastes:  I omitted the mushrooms, used french fried onions instead of potato chips, and added a half a soup can of milk.  Next time I make this, I will either omit the chopped onion in the casserole or cook it prior to stirring it in.  It stayed crunchy, which I didn't really care for.  Other than that, very good!  :o)

I loved this! It was a more adult version of the tuna casserole I grew up on, but then there's the twist with the chips that the kids love! The only thing I added was about 1/2 cup of chicken broth to help with the slight dryness.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this (with a few changes of course!)! I double the milk, put all the cheese in the casserole, use a full can of mushrooms, use macaroni and season with salt, pepper, garlic seasoning, and onion seasoning. I also use lots of sour cream and onioin chips to really white-trash it up! So good!

This was a very good casserole we enjoyed it very much.  DH made this for dinner so it is very easy to make and he said he enjoyed making it. He did add fritos instead of chips which sounded a bit weird but turned out just fine. Thanks for the recipe.

I personally am not a fan of tuna casserole, so I made it for my husband and he loved it!  It was my first attempt at a tuna casserole and it was a hit.  He doesn't like mushrooms so I left them out and used cream of celery instead.  He also really loves cheese so I probably used close to 4 cups of cheese.  I left out the chips because I didn't have any.  My husband really, really loved it!

This was awesome, I used a cheddar cheese soup instead of the mushroom and added a little milk. I covered the casserole for 15 min then another 15 uncovered, wasn't dry at all. Thank you for this recipe

This was a big hit with the family.  They cleaned out the entire dish! That alone makes it a five star recipe. A keeper for sure. Did add additional liquid to keep it moist as others suggested.

Great recipe! I followed the suggestions of others and added Cheddar Cheese soup and a splash of milk. It still was slightly dry, but my husband and grandson deemed it a hit. The one thing that surprised me is that recipe made so much--I ended up with two casseroles, and froze one after baking it. I think the next time I make it, I'm going to try chicken instead of tuna. It's definitely in our permanent meal rotation.

Great "base" for easy tuna fish.  We always add an extra can of cream of CHICKEN and some sour cream for moisture, and French onions instead of potato chips.  If you don't like to "notice" your chopped onions then sautee them for a bit.  It's easy, tasty, and not that bad for you either!

One of my absolute favorite dishes now!! I always add a packet of onion soup mix, chopped onions, two cans of tuna, and a little mayo. It turns out perfect every time!! And like others said, it makes excellent leftovers the next day.

This was good!  I have never had tuna casserole before but this sounded good so I thought I'd try it.  Luckily I had just picked up weird sized 16 oz cans of Cr. of Mush, so I used two of those and at least a can of milk, a little at a time to get a creamy texture.  Then I made the following  changes:  Tripled the onion, added a handfuls more of  cheese, some more peas.  Other than that I followed the recipe and the results were really good!  EDIT:  Made this tonight with crumbled up Ritz crackers tossed with a small amount of melted butter.  SO MUCH BETTER!

Ok - I think this is a great Tuna Cassarole. It definately beats Tuna Helper. I just make sure and salt & pepper & garlic this dish. When i'm in the mood for tuna for dinner...this is the way to go.

Superbly easy and delicious recipe!  A few changes:  I filled the two cans of cream of mushroom with milk and added them in for fear the casserole would turn out dry.  I cooked the onions, as suggested, before adding it in to the casserole mix but with garlic to give it more flavor.  I substituted potato chips with ritz crackers.  I added frozen cut carrots along with the peas.  What a keeper!!

It's been decades since I've had tuna cassarole and this one renewed my interest. I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, small bow tie pasta, and extra milk. Not really interested in peas of extra mushrooms. I make it all the time now and wished I had thought about putting cheese in it a long time ago!

This was a great Tuna Casserole!! One change I made was to add Hoffman Super Sharp Cheddar to the top(sliced from the deli). It browned up nicely and gives a nice zing to the taste!!  The onion is a nice addition to this dish. Lastly, it was easy to make, I will have left overs for luch at work, and the cost is minimal.

Loved this recipe. Instead of 2 cans of soup, I used 1 can of soup, plus 1 and 1/2 cans of milk. I found it to be plenty moist this way. I also topped with bread crumbs since I didn't have chips. My husband went crazy for it and ate it for lunch all week too. Will definitely make this again.

This was super easy. Noone in this house will eat peas, including me. I subbed matchstick carrots. I sauteed them with the onion before adding it to the tuna mixture. The mixture was a little thick, so I added about 3/4 cup of milk. (I didn't measure, I just added a little at a time until it looked right.) I only had a bit of potato chips at the bottom of the bag, so I used half chips and half french fried onions. I really tried to stick to the recipe but these days, you've really got to use what you have on hand and improvise ingredients with what your family will eat. Otherwise, it's wasted time and ingredients. I'll update on how we liked it after dinner. EDITED: Good. My oldest inhaled it. I think I might use a little sour cream or plain yogurt next time, to give it a little twang. This definitely is a make-again dish. The carrots I added were a nice touch.

I substituted clams for tuna and used water chestnuts instead of pasta and edamame instead of the peas and milk instead of the cheese and after boiling for 20 hours, it didn't need to be baked.  The potato chips were yummy on the side straight out of the bag.  JUST KIDDING!  This was perfect as directed and is our new favourite!

I love this.  As a matter of fact, between my husband and I-he ate it once when I first served it.  I'll admit, he said it was one of the best tuna casseroles he's ever had, but I ate all of the leftovers. Not all at once- over 4 days. yum.

Tuna casserole has always been in my Top 3 of favorite dishes. My mom made it for us when we were kids. I had never even thought to try to do it myself. Until today. This recipe was EXCELLENT. Clear and concise directions with a wonderful result that both my wife and I would like to say THANK YOU for! We just added a special dish to look forward to from now on. Awesome.

This was great.  I added some garlic, celery salt and milk (to make it creamier).  I also added more mushrooms because we love them.  I topped it with LOTS of cheddar cheese and nothing else.  Superb!

Very good recipe. I gave it four stars, because I added a couple of things.  I added frozen corn, pepper, garlic, and about 1/2 cup of sour cream...I thought it just needed a little more moisture and a little zip.  Otherwise, great!

This recipe for tuna casserole is perfect as-is, at least for my family. I liked that the casserole wasn't too soupy/saucy. The combination of ingredients was just right. My kids were very suspicious when I mixed everything up, but both loved it. I may try some lower fat ingredients next time, just to see how substitutions work.

Thank you for this. I have been "just throwing it together" for so long, and things really DO come out much better with a starter recipe, I followed it to the letter w/ fresh mushrooms and frozen veggies, definitely a classic hit :)

This was really good. I did change it a bit though, I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup, so to make it creamier I used a can of evaporated milk and didnt add the mushrooms and it turned out GREAT. It was so creamy and cheesey and the kids loved it, I also didnt have potato chips for the top so I used crushed ritz crackers.  I will be making this a lot during lent. Thanks!!!!

I'm sorry. This was not what I had hoped it would be. Not even my boyfriend that really likes tuna could finish this meal. I do want to add that it probably had to do with the dish I used. It was to large so the casserole came out very dry. Sorry!

I like this recipe. I made a few adjustments... I used a lrg can of cream of mushroom soup and a small can of cream of chicken soup. I would also recommend using 2 cans of tuna. I also used crushed goldfish crackers because I did not have any chips. Very good.

Yeah, this recipe is tasty but can be a bit dry.  There's a really easy fix though-- just keep the tuna and/or mushroom water, and add it with the wet ingredients.  It's just enough extra to keep the moisture.

I rate this lower just because I had to add so many extras to make it so that it wasn't bland. I added 1/4 cup more onions, used fresh mushrooms and 2 cloves of garlic for starters... sauted them in butter, then added those to the mixture. Also added 1 tablespoon dill, a little dash of garlic powder, 1/4 cup milk, lots of pepper, omitted the cheddar cheese and instead used parmesan. Also, instead of potato chips I used crushed Italian-seasoned croutons. If I had stuck to the recipe it would have been flavorless, in my opinion.

This was great! And fast. I did add some garlic and a little bit of milk to make it a bit more moist. I've made it a few times and now I always substitute french cut green beans for the peas.  It's great when you don't know what to make for dinner and want something comforting! Love it!

This is so good and so easy to make.  Like others, I added 1/3 cup of extra liquid (half and half) and a little white wine.  I also used crackers as the crust instead of chips.

I haven't had a tuna casserole since I was 16! THIS was the one I was looking for. I did season before mixing everything up, added a splash of milk & the whole can of mushrooms (really for the texture & moisture content). Mine didn't come out dry at all, but it was GREAT and now it's GONE. Not even any left for me today!

This was a yummy casserole.  I cut it down to 3 servings and added a 1/2 pint of cream.  It made an 8X8 dish, plenty for about 6 servings. A fast and tastey meal I will definitely make again!

What a great casserole for a cold, snowy day! I read the other reviews and made a few changes. First, I halved the recipe, making a smaller casserole. Then I added onion powder, instead of the chopped onion, because I love the flavor of onion, but do not enjoy chopped onions. I also added a jar of pimento and milk, to make it creamy. I did not have potato chips, so I used Ritz crackers, crumbled on top and drizzled with a little butter. The green peas and pimento made this casserole look very festive. It would be a great casserole to bring to a holiday potluck dinner. Thanks for sharing this easy casserole with us, Jennifer!

This was very good. I made this recipe as written and now strongly agree (and strongly suggest) with some of the other reviewers about adding some milk for a creamy rather than a sticky consistency.

I made this last night and it was so easy and simple! I added 1 cup of milk to the recipe to make it creamier and I used frozen mixed veggies (peas, corn, carrots, lima beans, green beans). I also used lots of cheese! It was soooooo good! My husband not only went crzy for it but he had 3 servings! Amazing! This is a keeper!

This is a very good basic tuna casserole recipe, which is exactly what I've been looking for.  I didn't have any potato chips on hand, so I crushed some Ritz crackers and mixed with grated Parmesan cheese and drizzled with melted butter for the topping, then at the last 5 minutes threw some Durkee's french fried onions on top just because I had some left over.  It was absolutely beautiful and tasted wonderful.  Came out just a bit drier than I would have liked so next time I will go ahead and add a whole cup of milk to the soup.  Also added a small clove of garlic and a dash of salt.  Wonderful!!! Defintely will make again!!!

I gave this four starts because it is a pretty good base recipe, although I took the advice of others, and I used bread crumbs (garlic and herb) instead of potato chips.  I also added pretty much onion, and a good amount of milk.  This particular recipe dried out a lot without any milk.  I'd suggest adding maybe 1 cup or so.  Also, I added garlic salt and pepper, and a small jar of pimientos.  I made this last night with those revisions (and some extra cheese, and mix all the cheese in, don't put it on top, it gets hard and chewy), and most of it disappeared, very quickly, and I quickly packed the rest for lunch today.

We don't care for mushrooms so I substituted 2 cans of cream of celery soup and omitted the mushrooms . I also used dehydrated onion because I didn't have a fresh onion and it was delicious. A family favorite. Real comfort food.

This is a quick and easy recipe- I didn't have frozen peas, but I did have a bag of frozen mixed veggies and added that instead.  Also, I only had one can of Cream Of Mushroom Soup, so I threw in a can of Cream of Chicken Soup instead, and it added a nice flavor.  Also, the cheese on top dried out quickly-it should probably go underneath the chips.  All in all, a good, easy meal.

Great recipe, though I would not recommend putting cheese on top of the chips, it dries out very fast.  Maybe underneath the chips would be ok, or just mix more cheese directly in.  It did seem a tad dry, but not too bad, a little bit of milk would help that.  My husband really enjoyed it, as did I, and I usually hate anything with peas in it!!  Thanks!

I have fussy stepchildren but they "love" this casserole.  I substituted on can of salmon with one can of tuna and instead of potato chips I top with small can of fried onions.  Adds great flavor.

I used fresh mushrooms, fat-free soup, and omitted the crackers.  I tried to half the recipe, which worked pretty well, but i think i needed either a little less soup ror more noodles.  It probably would have been better with regular soup, but still good.

Other than the potato chip topping, yes, I made it according to recipe.  I could have used crushed corn flakes, but I was out.  I just used seasoned breadcrumbs. End result?  Brilliant!

But next time, I will add a lot of sautéed celery.  I have never thought of celery as a vegetable.  To me, it has always been more of an herb.  Just a thought to myself that I'm sharing.

I like finding strong base recipes like this on AllRecipes that I can adjust based on my family's tastes/needs.  When I found this recipe, I realized that with two growing teenagers,  12 oz. of noodles wouldn't quite work for us, same with the 10 oz. of tuna. Here's how I adapted and everyone loved it! 16 oz. egg noodles 3 cans tuna, 2 cans mushroom soup, 1 can cream of celery soup, 1/2 chopped onion, entire can of mushrooms.  While cooking the noodles, I sauteed the onion and mushrooms  in about 1/4 stick of butter. I poured this all into the noodle mixture to loosen up the noodles so they didn't stick. In a separate bowl, I combined all of the soups, about 3/4 can of  milk, 1/4 C sour cream and approx. 1 t. onion powder and 1-1/2 t. garlic powder. Mixed this all well to combine before adding to the noodles.  Then I added the tuna and mixed it altogether. When I put into a very large 9x13 (high sides) it fit well. I would recommend NOT to add cheese on top of the chips as that made all of the chips stick together, which tastes good, but hard to cut without a knife! And we were watching the Oscars while eating so no knives with us! Not a big deal! Delicious - BTW, I forgot to add the peas, but wound up cooking them separate and serving on the side and we just mixed in as we liked. This will be a keeper in our rotation and I will probably try different the next time, just for fun.

This was very good with some adjustments: 

- I used rotini noodles instead because I just like their texture better. They trap the creamy sauce better. 
- I used about a half cup chopped onion and sauteed them in butter 'til soft first (didn't want crunchy onions pieces in my casserole).
- I used the whole 4-ounce can of mushrooms because I mean, why not? 
- I added a little over a 1/2 cup of half and half to combat any dryness. (It was the PERFECT amount of creamy!) I also mixed in some dry boullion to the half and half before adding to the mix. It added some much-needed salt and seasoning flavor. 
- I didn't add the cheese and chips topping right away; I baked the casserole for 20 minutes first, THEN added the cheese and the fried onions (I used those instead of chips. They were still nice and crunchy but also added a lovely onion flavor) and baked for another 5 minutes. 
With all these changes it was probably the best tuna casserole I've ever made. Recommend! (With changes... haha)

Great recipe, but gave 4 vs 5 stars since it definitely needed some milk added to keep it from drying out when baking (up to 1 cup).  The onions and peas are optional -- it's just as good without if you don't have on hand.  I added about 1/4 t. black pepper and chose to top it with 2 sleeves of crushed Ritz crackers stirred into 6 T. melted butter vs the chips, but that's just personal preference.    It's a keeper, definitely going into the monthly rotation.

My family thought it was ok . Next time I'll caramelize the onions and use fresh sauteed mushrooms. See if that helps boost the flavor.

I usually read the reviews before I make something for the first time but not this time so...my casserole was dry. The only thing I did differently was add 2 cans of drained sliced mushrooms-probably should have left the liquid in them! It was still tasty but definitely needed more soup, sour cream, milk, or something added.

I made this recipe last week. My husband and I loved it. I made it without cheese as I'm not a huge fan of cheese with tuna, but I think it would still be great.  It's cheap to make and you get a huge amount for leftovers. Try it and enjoy!

I had a can of french’s Fried onions so I used those instead of the chips. I had a 14 oz can of mushrooms so I added an extra cream of fill in the blank. That was all, I made it work so I didn’t have to go to the store. It was delicious, family loved it!

I made this and it was really good but I would recommend sautéing the mushrooms and onions a bit before adding to main mixture and definitely add some more seasoning (seasoning salt and some oregano worked best).

This is crazy easy, but so delicious! My mom learned to cook in France in the 1950s, so of course never cooked with canned soup, but when I made this for the first time,  she couldn't stop raving about how it was the absolute most  fantastic tuna casserole she'd ever had. Then we both howled with laughter when I made her guess what it entailed. Just made it again, because she keeps talking about it.  I used Genova brand albacore tuna in oil/no salt, which is beautiful canned tuna, one can of regular mushroom soup, and one can of cream of celery (why I had that is anybody's guess). I didn't add any extra salt, except to the noodles during boiling, but did add lots of pepper - personal pref.  This is already a regular - THANKS!!!

This was really good. I took the other reviewers advice and made it in a 2qt casserole dish, it was a lot of filling but it fit. 
The things I will do differently next time: saute the onions a little bit before putting it in the mixture. I don't like chomping down on fresh onions (personal preference), I would also cook the mixture for a little bit in the oven before putting the topping on. I felt like the topping cooked and browned up nicely but the mixture underneath didn't get very warm. So those are a few things I would do differently next time. 
My casserole was not dry at all. I did add a dash of milk to each can of soup after I emptied it into the bowl to get all the goodness out of the bottom. I also didn't have potato chips so I used Bugels instead. 
Try this casserole it's so good and will be a staple. The crunchy salty cheesy goodness that becomes the topping is so good.

Good recipe! I sauteed my onions and mushrooms,used Campbells Golden cream of mushroom soup. 
I added a small can of corn instead of peas. I baked mine at 350 instead of 425. The picky family really liked it.

Looked at reviews and made these changes:
Used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of celery and a 1/2 cup of whole milk.
Sauteed 1/2 chopped onion in 1/2 stick of butter.
Used the sharp cheddar cheese.
Added light amount of pimentos.
Cooked at 375 for longer
Also:
Greased dish with butter.
Instead of chips, for last 5 minutes or so, I added French's onions .
Moist, but not soupy.  Very good!

Delish! I halved the recipe and had plenty for three adults. I omitted the mushrooms since I didn’t have any and used small shell pasta. Changed up Panko with a little butter and salt for the potato chip topping. Rave reviews from my guys. 10/10 comfort food.

I added an additional 5 ounce can of tuna, and used maybe 8 ounces of egg noodle instead of 12 ounces! I also used half the amount of mushrooms! I made these changes only because I like my pasta more creamy! Came out delicious!

This is great but you have to do your own add ins based on your favorite tastes. For example,  next time I will add more onion and not use canned mushrooms. I also added some sundried tomatoes after baking for extra flavor. I also used an extra can of mushroom soup. I liked it and it's a solid based recipe, just add in more of what you like.

I made as is but it was very dry. Wasn’t a big hit. I am going to modify the receipt and try again. I am going to use albacore tuna and thin the condensed soup by adding water. I may try adding velveeta cheese also.

yes I used cream of chicken soup as I didn't have any mushroom and added frozen peas and carrots as that is all I had. It was wonderful and our grandchildren loved it.

Very good!  I took others advice, and added 1 cup sour cream, sauteed the onions in butter, and seasoned with salt and pepper.

I used bow tie noodles, added half can of milk, and omitted canned mushrooms.  Honestly, It's kind of tasteless.  Definitely needs salt and pepper.  I would make it again.  It makes a ton.

I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 pan and left out onions (my 4 year old won't eat them) and it turned out really well!

I thought it was a good recipe, and my wife, who doesn't eat meat, liked it. I added extra tuna (another small can), but I thought it came out a little dry. The next time, I will add a cup of milk to the recipe.

Pretty good. This was my first time making a tuna casserole, so the fault may be entirely mine. The flavors are good and everything works well together, but it came out kinda dry.

It was delicious! I used mixed vegetables instead of peas, and I think next time I will substitute French's onions for the potato chips on top. But overall, the casserole was really good.

Made this last night and it was pretty good. I added a cup of sour cream per someone's review, but I wouldn't do that again. It really dilutes the cream of mushroom flavor. But it does need more liquid to keep it from getting dry, so I'd suggest another 1/2 can of soup and 1/2 cup sour cream to add creaminess.  I also doubled the peas (I love peas and rarely eat them). I'd up the onion next time too, like 1/2 of a large onion. If chopped finely, there's no need to saute beforehand, the crunch is nice in my opinion.  French fried onions on top really make this dish!

I’ve noticed everyone is saying how dry this is. The problem is this recipe doesn’t call for any milk. My recipe uses 3/4 can of milk per can of soup. It’s very creamy this way. I made it exactly as written & added the milk & it’s amazing.

Read a lot of reviews before I made this.   As stated by others this is a "whats in the pantry" recipe.  There were a few ingredients I didn't have... I substituted cream of chicken for CoM.  No mushrooms either.  I took the advice of others and First  minced & sautéed 1/2 medium onion & 1 large clove of garlic . Then added 1/4 cup dry white wine and reduce.   Once reduced, I added one (1) 10.5oz can of condensed cream of chicken soup, 1 can of whole milk, lowered heat and stirred in 1/2 cup of sour cream, 4oz of cream cheese and 2-3 cups shredded 4 cheese  blend.  The sauce tasted a bit bland so I added 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp lemon juice and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper; salt and pepper to taste.  I didn't have egg noodles so I used elbow noodles (cooked al dente); placed in oval casserole dish. Poured sauce over noodles added in peas and tuna, mix to distribute ingredients evenly and topped with crushed Italian Seasoned Croutons.  Baked at 425 for 25-30min . Superb dish and easy to make... The whole family enjoyed.  Will definitely be making this dish again.  Perhaps next time I may throw in some pimentos and sliced black olives for color and a more robust flavor.

I accidentally bought salt and vinegar chips instead of plain ones, but I used them anyway to make this casserole and my husband and I loved it! The flavor of the chips gave the recipe a bit of a tangy edge.

Great recipe! I made the following changes according to the comments I read through along with a couple of ideas of my own :


??used 3 cans tuna
??sauteed mushrooms then added onion, then added liquid ingredients and cheese 
??added one soup can of milk
??added half block of cream cheese
??added about 3 oz of shredded smoked gouda
??used 1/2 cup panko mixed with 1/2 cup crushed chips and reduced cheese topping by half
??baked at 350 for 20-25 min


At the lower temperature i just used a single oven resistant pan to cook my pasta, then the mushrooms and liquids, then mixed all the ingredients into the pan for the final baking step. 


These changes ensured a creamy saucy casserole which we prefer, and the lower temperature is more forgiving on the canned tuna. The second time we made this we added about 6 oz of baby spinach and it worked out great.

What a blast from the past. I made it with one can cream of mushroom + one can cream of chicken and added an extra 4 oz of tuna. Will definitely add more veggies/tuna next time.  Cooked down the onion with 2 cloves of garlic, S&P first then mixed the rest together with the peas, tuna and 1 cup of milk.  It also made sense for us to split it into two different dishes - one round pie pyrex and a second 8 x 8 in for easy storage. Stayed nice and moist under the layer of crispy chips and shredded cheese we added right before baking.

I will make this again.  I thought it was delicious.  I used fresh mushrooms that I sauteed a bit and added about a soup can of milk so it wouldn't be too dry.  I also added some salt.  It was done in 15 min. at 425 degrees F.

Actually, I’m not much of a cook, but this sounded so simple, I thought I’d try it. With the exception of one item, I followed the recipe exactly. As I prepared the ingredients, though, I realized I only had one can of Cream of Mushroom Soup. For the second can, I used Cream of Potato, and it was great. Some reviews said it was dry, but this one was delicious. It's a keeper!

I made this last night just as the recipie called for and I agree it was a little dry.  Today for leftovers I added an extra can of  soup and filled the can 1/2 with water and 1/2 with milk. It was perfect!!! Very creamy. Delicious. I will definitely make again using the soup, water and milk mixture for certain.

Good starter recipe. I sautéed' a clove of  garlic, 1/2 a jalapeno pepper  along with the onion in a little butter and that kicked up the flavor. then added little hot sauce cause we like a bite to it.  Left out the cheese to lower the fat content. Recipe could have used a little more liquid maybe add a 1/4 cup of milk next time..

My DH loves this casserole! I have made it several times.My husband is not a fan of onions. So to straddle flavor and his palette, I have used crispy fried onions instead of potato chips as a topping . It passed the taste test and he is happy!

This was tasty, but a little bland. I used tricolored veggie noodles so it was very colorful. But maybe that was it.   I also used extra sharp shredded cheese, which you could taste.  Instead of potato chips I used some plain Panko crumbs which was really good.   Overall, other than being a bit bland, all of us really enjoyed it and I will make again!   Update: Made this again and added a cup of sour cream and a soup can of milk to remedy the dryness.  Also added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to make more flavorful.  Both changes worked really well!

I would make this again. I looked at other reviews and added some of the ingredients that they recommended to keep it moist. My mother (she passed away this Feb) used to make tuna hot dish. My Mom was an excellent cook.  I hate to say it, but this turned out better than any of the ones she made.  I think she would have enjoyed it.

I should've read the reviews prior to making this and taken some of the suggestions - I thought this was quite dry, especially considering there were two cans of soup in here.  I would cut down on the noodles, only putting in maybe 8 oz instead of 12.  Just needs more moisture.  I also cut the cheese down since I thought 2 cups was a lot.

After reading many of the reviews, I decided the overwhelming "issue" was the casserole being too dry.  So, I added 1 soup can of half & half.  It was perfect.

Will definitely make this again.

I loved it -- and so did my daughter and husband, but I paid attention to the other reviewers, and made the following modifications:
- I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 4 oz of cream cheese, and 1 cup of chicken stock (unsalted), which I heated up on the stove top before mixing in. 
- I used Durkee's french fried onions as opposed to a regular onion (mostly because it was what I had on hand, but it turned out well) 
- I used fresh mushrooms versus canned
- I also cooked the noodles only til just tender (about 5 min).

I baked for 20 minutes at 350, and it was fully cooked, creamy and not dry in the least.

I added a little milk to give it  a more creamier texture, and extra tuna.  The kids loved it.

I followed others' suggestions and baked @ lower temp (350°) for 30 minutes in an oval Corningware dish covered in foil. I "customized" the recipe by adding half a can of French's/Durkee fried onions and a can of chopped, mild green chiles. I used no milk, a 12 oz can of water-packed Tuna, a can of mushroom soup, Light Miracle Whip (about a cup), a handful of Kraft 2% Mexican 4 cheese grated cheese (mixed it in),  and a can of LeSueur very young early sweet peas (drained). I also used a 12 oz. bag of the No Yolks dumplettes noodles. Topped casserole with crushed Cape Cod potato chips, and it turned out great. Had plenty of leftovers.. Really good & highly recommend!

Like many others, I did not follow the recipe exactly as written. However, it's still pretty good and I imagine that it probably tastes even better the next day. Very good base recipe you can make your own. I'm a fan. Used an extra can of soup and some milk, fresh mushrooms, rotini pasta, and French fried onions for the topping instead of chips. Also sautéed the onions and mushrooms first. Baked in a round 2-quart dish to keep it moist as someone here suggested. I would probably add more tuna next time and substitute something I place of the peas (meh). Like I said, great base recipe. Can't really go wrong unless you deviate from the recipe completely lol.

This is very good.
I made 3 changes: -A can of sweet peas (instead of frozen), -A large can of the cream of mushroom soup (instead of 2 small), & -1 pkg Fresh mushrooms, chopped (instead of canned)

I cooked the noodles & then everything else on the stove, in a big skillet: Butter-flavored cooking spray with the chopped onion & mushroom (~4 min), then added the soup, peas, tuna, cheese.  Mixed in the cooked noodles.  Tossed everything into the 9x13 baking dish.  Covered with cheese & the crushed (sour cream/onion) chips.  Baked 15 min, just to get the top crunchy.
This made a HUGE casserole.  Next time I'll make a half recipe.
Very good (& I only "tolerate" tuna).  Husband really liked it & my one year old was even picking peas off my plate (to eat, not throw :-) ).  I'll make this again (just less next time :-) )!

[Made this again.  Next time I'll use canned chicken instead of tuna.  More palatable to me.]

My husband and I LOVED this! We did make a few changes because we love seasoning so he added pepper, season salt, dill and lemon pepper and herb old bay seasoning for flavor.  He was concerned about it being dry so he add a couple tbs of butter and about 1/4 cup of milk.  Will definitely add a little more milk the next time. We didn't have potato chips so he did crushed ritz crackers on top.  It was phenomenal!! Will definitely make this again!

It was good! Loved the crunchy texture added by the crushed chips. I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars. Obviously this casserole, as others have said, will come out very dry unless you deviate from the recipe. Mine turned out great. Here's the changes I made: added 3/4 cup of milk, used Mozzarella cheese instead of Cheddar, and left out the chopped mushrooms. We also used carrot/pea frozen mixture instead of just peas (minor change). I think the Mozzarella cheese made the dish taste amazing, and the extra milk really helped the casserole come out creamy without being runny. I would not use cream, as it would be too heavy, but you could add an extra can of soup if you want. Personally I think the milk is perfect, but to each their own. It's a great recipe, but it needs a few tweaks to be delicious. With my changes I would give 5 stars, but I am giving the base recipe a 4, as I do not want readers to have their expectations of this recipe skewed. There are too many reviews that are 5 stars "with all my changes to make it better", and that's not a good way to rate a recipe - you are left searching through reviews for the changes that turn the recipe into something delicious. On its own without any alterations, this recipe will be good, but only 4 stars good. You really need to add some milk or extra soup to turn it into a 5 star dish.

I shouldn't have listened to the reviews stating the recipe as written was too dry. I added milk to the recipe and it became a pasta rather than casserole. This was the second time I made this and I forgot that it was very good as written. Casseroles are supposed to be dry. If you want a saucy pasta you should probably be looking for another recipe.

This recipe was delicous but I had a few issues with it. It's dry to counteract this I add half a cup of milk. Egg noodles will soak up liquid and cooking in the oven uncovered will evaporate much of the liquid. I cook the peas first otherwise they are crunchy which we do not like. I used a whole onion, yellow onion as it has more flavor and i sauteed in olive oil first until translucent and a little bit brown and you would be surprised how much flavor they add . No potato chips...nope , I cut in some fresh butter with some seasoned bread crumbs , cover the top of the casserole and then pile on the cheese. I not neatly level off the top of the casserole before adding the bread crumbs, the more uneven peaks, the more crunchy goodness. I used a whole 16 ounce bag of egg noodles.

Subbed green beans instead of the peas, and cracker crumbs with butter for the potato chips, based on ingredient availability. This was a hit with my eight-year-old, who announced before dinner that she 'didn't think she was a casserole type of person.' Excellent base for all sorts of delicious variations!

I made this last night for dinner.  As recommended I added an extra half can of soup (used celery) and combined all the cheese at once rather than adding a cup to the top.  I also added some cream and milk to ensure the casserole wasn't too dry.  It was tasty.  A good Friday night meal. ??

I made some changes to this recipe, I added a cup of 2% milk, no onions (forgot) and used the water from the tuna cans. I also added one can of cheese soup. It tasted amazing! However the cup of milk made it too watery so it's more like a soup instead of a casserole. I'll try less milk next time but this recipe is definitely delicious :D

This recipe turned out really good with a little tweaking. 
Instead of white or yellow onion I used 3/4 cup green onion, fresh sliced mushroom sauteed in 1 tbsp butter until golden brown, added one soup can milk and 3/4 cup starched water from the cooked noodles, 2 tsp Lawry's garlic salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper. 
It came out with a very nice wet to dry ratio and wonderful flavor. My son said "I wish I could come home to this every day."

A good classic base recipe. We used fresh mushrooms instead of canned (personal preference), and added a little bit of sour cream since others had said it was dry, and we were pleased with the results.

Made this for my family for the first time.  I bought tuna helper once and my kids would not touch it with a 10ft pole.  So I was taking a chance by making a tuna casserole dish.  Omg it was awesome.  My kids ate this thing up. I used 3 cans of tuna because 2 didn't seem enough and I used fresh mushrooms because I had it in the fridge.  This is going into my monthly recipe circle.

I love this recipe. It is my go to when making tuna casserole. I don't always have all the ingredients and it still comes out great. I have left out the peas, onion, mushrooms, and chips and it still tasted great. This is an easy recipe to modify.

This was good but had to be tweaked.  I added some milk and another can of cream of mushroom soup otherwise it would of been dry.  I also used fresh mushrooms as I don't like canned mushrooms at all.  I sauteed them a with the onion and also put fresh garlic.  I would make this again if I make tuna casserole again... my kids don't like tuna casserole.

This was delicious but, as noted by others, a bit dry.  Next time I will add milk or sour cream.  I didn't have chips for the top so I turned the broiler on for a few minutes at the end and it browned the cheese on top to a crisp, which was yummy.  Definitely a keeper though.

Wow! This was delicious!  The potato chips on top made it extra special. I left out the peas and only used one can of soup with milk added. It was perfect.  I will be making this dish on a regular basis! Thanks!!

I made this for the family and they loved it!  Even my husband (who swears he hates tuna) went back for seconds.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms when I made it, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Very tasty!

I really like this recipe.  Peas add a lot to it, in my opinion.  But the crushed potato chips - I think that'd be perfect for a family gobbling the whole dish up in one sitting.  I'm a family of one, never too thrilled about going through all sorts of things just to make a meal, so I like making casseroles like this, and I'll leave the toppings for each dinner I make out of it.  In my efforts to keep the calories and fat down, I usually leave the cheese out of the recipe - and I really don't notice it not being in there, because the overall flavor is what comes through the most.  I grew up always using lemon juice on a serving, and nowadays I buy limes, because they're alway one fifth the cost.  But lemon or lime, and maybe some Romano on a meal is just plain fantastic.  Also, if you're feeling a little daring, add a half teaspoon of hot madras curry powder to the recipe - or a full teaspoon of dill!  Tabasco always seems like a must have with this great dish too! Like my great Jewish friends would say, "try it - you'll LIKE IT!" :-)  This dish is what I call real comfort food.

I am definitely not a cook but this dish was oh so simple. I made smaller portions and adjusted the recipe accordingly. Oh so good! Thank you so much!

I love this recipe,but I do change it a bit.  I saute the mushrooms and onions in a little butter before adding it with the other ingredients.  I also add some milk or cream to the mixture to make it less dry.  I usually top the casserole with panko crumbs, since I never have potato chips in the house.  This is comfort food to me.  I feel a little guilty when I make it, since I usually eat much healthier food, but I only make it once a month.

Let me begin by saying that my husband is not a fan of tuna or mushrooms, and I hate peas...but we both loved this meal. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious. It's an inexpensive, easy meal. I'll definitely be making this again.

I am only leaving this review for others out there like me who often times don't have the exact ingredients called for in the recipe and need to make substitutions.  I had the basics; pasta, tuna, cheese and onion and wanted a recipe as a guideline and chose this one.  I used rigatoni noodles in place of egg; a can of mixed veggies in place of frozen peas; one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery; and crumbled Ritz crackers instead of potato chips. I also added a dash of garlic powder.  It turned out fabulous - my husband, Mr. Picky, had seconds, and my reluctant 3 year old finished it off on her own .  I'll be honest, I wasn't sure how it would be but it was great and I'm glad there are leftovers for tomorrow.  Thanks for posting this recipe and giving me the base.

Followed exactly minus the peas. I thought it was okay. My teenage boys didn't care for it at all. Could have used more tuna and maybe some extra soup and milk for a creamier casserole.

Very tasty, however, I did do a couple tweaks to it. I added the 2 cans of mushroom soup, and addded another can of cream of celery. It still was a little bit dry, so next time I may add some milk to it. I loved the taste, so I will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe!

So I made this recipe based off of what others said in their review but we used french's French onion instead of potato chips and it's great. I used 3 cans of the soup and 1/2 cup of milk and it's not dry at all :) just make sure to measure out the onion otherwise you'll get onion in each bite but other wise it was wonderful!!!!!!!

I used Hawaiian bbq chips, 8 oz. Of fresh sliced mushrooms I boiled with the noodles and Mexican cheese. It was great, and I had garlic bread with it.

This turned out ok but was really bland. It needs more seasoning and the onions were very overpowering. I would recommend sauteing them first or maybe using only half an onion. I did like the cheese/potato chip crust though!

Great, easy recipe! Added a little milk & sour cream since others said it was a little dry--will do this again next time. Unfortunately, I replaced the egg noodles with macaroni noodles....will NOT do this again! Also, think I will defrost the frozen peas first as my husband said it wasn't hot enough.

Good casserole.  I do not care for tuna, but this recipe calms the tuna taste down with the mushroom soup, noodles and cheese.  it was pretty good.

I thought the recipe itself was tasty, as is, but a little dry. I ended up putting in the whole jar of mushrooms and adding a little milk. I'm still not sure about the potato chips, but the rest of the family ate it up. Thank you for sharing!

9/14  ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/17219/best-tuna-casserole/ ... Ya know ... most of these tuna casserole recipes are very similar, & they're all fine.  I'm thinking a five star one is really dependent on how much you like tuna. (Duh. ;D).  Anyway, I halved this one.  'Short on egg noodles so cooked 2oz spaghetti a couple minutes then added 4oz egg noodles.  "They," the kids, really like that little difference.  Crazy, huh?!  Back to review: I added I guess what was 12oz tuna.  I accidentally bought chunk light & most of that is liquid, which I saved to add some to the dish & the rest to the cat's food.  :)  I used added some "tuna juice" & some milk - approximately a half soup can's worth.  Also added 1/8t cayenne, parsley, onion powder; half cup frozen corn; half cup shredded cheddar in it & another half cup on it.  Topped with bottomofthebag/crushed corn chips & cheezits.  The looks alone got the kids to try it.  (Crazy, the sequel :D).  A little sprinkling of parsley & paprika & wow, they ate it.  Wow. (Wow.)  Note4Me:  Bake in 2qt dish.  at 350.  Add another can o soup & milk/sour cream.  Kinda dry as is.  Maybe cheddar cheese soup. 9/14 K really liked topping with bottomofthebag cheezits & cornchips & the addition of corn.  'didn't say it was tuna.

This was an awesome dish! I added 1 stalk of celery and sauteed it with the onion and minced garlic. I also took the advice of other reviewers and used reduced fat sour cream and lactose free milk. Lastly, I used 3 cans of 5oz tuna. It was literally my fiancee's first time having tuna casserole and he LOVED it! Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this recipe - it makes for a great tuna noodle casserole.  It's one of those "clean out the pantry" recipes where you can use what you have on hand.  For instance, I used whole wheat egg noodles, 98% fat free mushroom soup, and a mixture of cheddar, colby jack and manchego cheeses because it's what was what I had.  I also sauteed the mushrooms and onion in butter before adding them, and dropped the frozen peas in with the noodles at the very end before draining.  As others also suggested, I used the empty mushroom soup can to measure out half a can sour cream and half a can milk, just to ensure it wasn't too dry (and it turned out perfectly).  I, too, just mixed in all of the cheeses, added some cracked black pepper and a dash of salt, and topped the casserole with buttered bread crumbs, as I didn't have potato chips.  Saved and will use again!!

I've made tuna casserole a million times but LOVED this recipe the most.  What makes it is the potato chips. I was pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed them.  Previously I only used bread crumbs.  
My alterations:
- I accidently bought 1 cream of mush and 1 cream of chicken. I decided to go with it, and it was AWESOME.
- Used less cheese on top 
- Accidently used the whole package of noodles so I just added a bit more milk, onion, 1 extra can of tuna, and peas to make sure it covered nicely.

Good base recipe!  I left out the mushrooms (family doesn't like them) and I used my homemade cream of soup mixture in place of the 2 cans cream of mushroom soup.  I also cut the tuna down to only 1 can, that was plenty for me.  Chicken substituted instead of tuna works really well, too.  I have made this recipe so many times, it is a family favorite for sure!  I forgot the potato chips the last time I made it and it was still good - and I guess I saved a few calories in the process :)  One other thing I do is, during the last minute of cooking the noodles, I add in the frozen peas to the pot to cook them a bit.  Before doing this, my daughter always complained of the icky texture of the peas and this seemed to solve the problem - it is now one of her favorite meals!

This was delicious. The recipe makes a rather enormous casserole, so make sure there are plenty to partake! I didn't have any potato chips, so I covered the top with Original GoldFish Crackers. How cute is that for a tuna casserole? :)

Delicious, if you love Tuna Casserole. We doubled the recipe (less doubling the cheese) and put it in a 9x13 topped with 1 roll of crushed Ritz, instead of Potato Chips. Everyone loved it but the 2yr old (I see a trend here with 2yr old critics).

This was so easy to put together! I even tweaked it a little, following suggestions from other reviewers. I added a soup can of milk and about 3/4 of a cup of sour cream. I even added more onions because 1/4 cup didn't seem like enough. It turned out nice and creamy, not soupy or dry, and the entire extended family loved it. One member of the fam said he doesn't care for tuna casserole, except occasionally, but this was definitely something he'd like more often. There wasn't anything left for the dog!

The recipe appeared to me to be a bit on the dry side so I added the juice from the tuna. also added a half can of jalapeño tomato sauce for some kick. Added all the cheese to the mixture and sprinkled Parmesan cheese over Doritos chips. It was a very good dish!

Good overall. Four stars because I made necessary changes. I used mostly the same core ingredients. I made a bigger batch, increasing to a 16oz package of egg noodles and three cans of tuna, and bumping everything else up too. I added chopped carrots. Since other reviewers said it was dry I added a cup of chicken broth and it ended up not being dry at all. I also substituted french fried onions for the potato chips on top. It was good but did need a bit of salt and pepper at the table. I'll definitely make this again, but my modified way.

Loved this!  I sautéd the onions in some coconut oil  along with a sprinkle of Webers beer can Chicken Seasoning while the noodles cooked.  I used Targets Market Pantry sweet peas instead of frozen peas and also used the Market Pantry Cream of Mushroom Soup Mix.  Also I used Mexican shredded cheese from Target as I had that on hand.  This recipe is a definite keeper!  The amount is great and will feed my husband and I for dinner all week and I won't have to cook!  Love this recipe and I highly recommend it's super tasty saucy cheesy goodness!
I read some of the other reviews and my creation was not at all dry, it was just the right amount of cheese and sauce and I thought it was absolutely perfect.

This recipe should add garlic, salt and pepper. Other than that I followed all most of the directions (except I used 2 stalks of chopped celery, 1 cup of mozzerela cheese and 1 cup of cheddar cheese inside the casserole then also 1 more cup of cheddar on the top-added 5 minutes before done) and it was good.

if ANYONE MAKES THIS AS IS, you will NEED MORE LIQUID! double it

 2. if you follow this recipe only use 6 oz of noodles and you still need to add 4-6 oz of any one: soup, milk or sour cream.

Moist, full of taste, and takes about 55mins to cook!  Did not use chips and baked with half a can of water to prevent the noodles from getting dry. Will be cooking again!  Next time I will had the chips for the crunch factor!

Wow very good everyone had seconds! Read past reviews used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery and used the liquid in the tuna cans. Omitted onions and mushrooms just used onion seasoning and a couple dashes of mrs dash original and used the frozen peas.  Used 4 cups dry egg noodles and  no cheese on top just the crushed chips. Enjoy!

It's good but I did add more tuna and after I put it into the baking dish I covered the voids with milk before putting the cheese and chips on top. It helped add moisture. I'll mix in some chopped jalapenos when I'm just making it for the wife and I.

MY very picky DH loved this and agreed wholeheartedly that it is THE BEST TUNA CASSEROLE. The best he's ever had!  I followed the recipe but did not have mushrooms, which I will make sure I will add fresh mushrooms next time. I added chopped celery for crunch, garlic powder, and about 1/4 c of the tuna water to add a bit more moisture and flavor to the casserole.

Loved this recipe!! Was craving Tuna Noodle Casserole like my Mom used to make. Made a few changes: chopped 2 stalks of celery and sautéed with the onions in a little butter just to soften them slightly before mixing with the noodle/tuna mixture and only used 1 cup of cheese in the mixture, I did not top the casserole with cheese, just crushed potato chips (personal preference, just too much cheese). This was fantastic and just like I remembered. Makes a good work lunch leftover too!!!

Great recipe. Love the recommendation for the cayenne pepper. My mom used to put bbq potato chips,  so I did it that way and Mmm... Perfect. I used a bit of half and half for extra creaminess.

Loved this recipe! I skipped the canned mushrooms and potato chips but rather added a bread crumb topping (melted butter mixed with bread crumbs sprinkled on top). So good! Will make again for sure! Straight up comfort food

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. It may have been a little bland, but to be honest, I have never had a tuna casserole that wasn't a little bland. lol I did add a little garlic powder and parsley and I used sharp cheddar, because that was what I had on hand. Next time, I will work on my seasonings to give it a little more flavor. All in all though, I liked it and will make it again. Thanks JAICARD!

I've had this more than once, and it's always good!  This time, though, I used a 12 oz. box of vege penne pasta because I didn't have egg noodles on-hand, nor did I have chips, so I substituted french fried onions.  Ummm, yeah....that redo didn't disappoint!  I also sprinkled some mozzarella on top with the cheddar too.  I will be making a note on my printed copy to stick with these changes!  Great recipe!!

Simple, great comfort food. I substituted rubbery, tasteless canned mushrooms for fresh mushrooms. I live in California where fresh vegetables are very easy to find. You may want to watch your oven at 425 degrees. I had a few burnt potato chips though my oven tends to be on the hotter side. Definitely will be a quick night favorite. Had two servings immediately, it was that satisfying.

This is one of the best recipes i have come across when it comes to tuna casserole! But there is ONE thing i would change. It is a little do dry for my taste, so i added a little more cream of mushroom with milk to make it a little more moist and it came out WONDERFUL! Just an idea ;)

Delicious! This is my favorite tuna casserole recipe. I make this weekly. My suggestion would be to sauté the onion to soften them up a bit. I also mix in extra cheese and top with extra cheese. My kids ask for seconds when I make this.

This is a great go to meal if you don't have too much time on your hands or if you are like me and just draw a blank some nights on what to make for dinner. This is great on those chilly rainy nights! The only thing that I did differently was I didn't add any sliced mushrooms ( hubby won't eat them but doesn't mind the mushroom soup) and I added in a touch of garlic. This was great!

I Love this !!  Great to start with the basic receipe, then experiment....I do "know" that it needs to be a very "wet" casserole when it enters the oven. I have used the Bread Crumbs, then tried the Potato Chips, and lately Fried Onion Rings..All are wonderful. I also add some milk, and sour cream.....Yummy !!..We all love to cook...We all love to "bring it up a notch".....Enjoy !!!

This recipe is very good, and I added the following ingredients as well.  I used 1 1/2 pounds 
DeCecco brand Cavatappi pasta (cooked al dente),  12 oz. tuna, along with 2 cans of a condensed mushroom soup, added 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup real mayo, 3 oz. crumbled herbed goat cheese, chunked sharp cheddar, chunked white cheddar, mixed it all together, along with adding frozen corn instead of peas.  I shredded the rest of the cheddar on top, added freshly grated parmesan, and crushed potato chips, kettle brand.  We are a family of 6 and everyone was pleased and went back for seconds.  I love this website and get many good ideas and helpful hints.  MALLORY

This is a great tuna casserole. I did some adjusting by adding more veggies, using low fat soup, breadcrumbs instead of chips and an extra can of tuna to increase the protein content.

I was looking for something that both my husband and kids would enjoy eating and came across this recipe.  Since I hadn't made a tuna casserole in years, I thought I'd try it out.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so made a basic bechamel sauce (3T butter and 3T flour with about 2 cups of milk and some chicken stock that I had on hand to add flavoring).  I increased the amount from the ~20oz of soup in the ingredients after reading several reviews recommending more liquid so that it doesn't bake too dry.  Otherwise, I kept the recipe exactly as is.  My family loved it!

Ok, this was delicious! I made just a couple minute changes.
First, in a little olive oil I sauteed onion, 2 cloves of garlic, a handful of chopped fresh parsley and 4 fresh mushrooms chopped. Meanwhile boiling the noodles. After the onions were tender, I added the peas to the same pan and heated through. When the noodles were done I placed them in a bowl with the remaining ingredients and because I had read a few reviews stating the casserole was dry, I added 1 Cup of milk and 1 Cup of sour cream. I also put the 2 Cups of Cheddar in the mixture. I mixed it well and added salt and pepper, and put it into the 9x13 and topped it with an additional cup of cheddar, some french fried onions, and a 1/4 Cup of shredded parmesan, that I had mixed. I baked it for the recommended time and it was FABULOUS! My family of six devoured it!

This was a good base. I caramelized the onions, then added the peas, tuna, and soup. Mixed it all up and then added the noodles and 1/2 the cheese.  Found it to be a little dry so I added a little milk. I also added some cooked bacon for extra flavor. Topped it with the rest of the cheese and Ritz crackers instead of chips. Turned out pretty delicious.

Kid friendlier version....leave out the onion and extra mushrooms. Add 1/2 cup milk to soup and some black pepper. I too use twice the tuna and only chunk white albacore. Layer noodles, tuna and peas with additional sliced up hard boiled eggs (I use 4 or 5). I warm the soup up first and then pour over layers. My son and husband prefer crushed Ritz crackers instead of chips. I don't add the cheese on top until the last 10 minutes and use about 1 1/2 cups (reduce oven to 375). Hint: spray inside casserole with Pam or equivalent for easy clean up and serving.

This was good, but the ingredient ratios are "off".  Too many noodles/not enough sauce as written.  Try about 3/4 of a 12 oz. bag of noodles, and ADD about 1/4 cup milk and half cup sour cream (or maybe an extra can of soup?).  Also added dill weed and a squirt of lemon juice to bring up the flavor.  Topped with buttered crushed corn flakes in lieu of chips (just what was in the pantry). Then just bake at about 350 for 35 minutes (so the top doesn't burn). Decent idea, but not quite accurate as written.

Added extra onion (my family loves them) and a can of cheddar soup to prevent the dryness, and it worked like a charm. I would give it 5 stars if I could take the calorie count down slightly. Still, great comfort food, and tastes even better the next day!

The search goes on....the cheese did not do it for me in this recipe.  Hubby ate it and said it was OK but we'll see what happens with the left-overs. I cut back on the noodles a bit so it wouldn't be dry, per other reviews, but still lacked flavor.

We love this recipe and it's on our list of casseroles we like to make on a regular basis.  Like some of the other reviewers, we also add sour cream and a little milk to the soup for the noodles to absorb.  And because the casserole itself is pretty bland, my husband had the good idea of using crushed Miss Vickie's Jalapeno Kettle Chips on top to give it some zing!

No onion (not a fan) and froz green beans instead of peas. My thing is I prefer to cheese the top and put the potato chips on top near the end of cooking. I also add black pepper and Lousisiana Hot Sauce for my personal zip.

This recipie turned out pretty good, with some adjustments. It is a great basic recipe! I added one can of cheddar cheese soup,  1 1/2 cup of peas, 3/4 cup milk, a few dashes of pepper and garlic powder. For the topping, I used butter crackers mixed with melted butter (I didn't have potato chips, and I've used the cracker/butter mix before). I also used more than 2 cups of cheese, as I have a cheese loving family. It turned out delicious, and wasn't dried out!

This was the best tuna casserole I've made yet, and my husband loved it! I pretty much followed the recipe with a few exceptions: used a round casserole dish, added an extra 1/4 cup chopped onions, added some heavy cream and milk, didn't drain the mushrooms for added flavor. We like spicy food so we added some sriracha rooster sauce too. Would make again, and tasted great reheated. I think a good tip is to use 1 can light tuna and 1 can white albacore tuna. The albacore chunks make it extra yummy!

I made this exactly except omitted the mushrooms, giving 4 stars because it is a bit dry. But, I heated the leftovers next day with some milk and topped with sour cream, and it was delicious! Would be 5 stars if moister, so will make again with some added milk.

Second time I have made this.  First time fed eight.  Second time, made in two casseroles, froze one and still had 7 large servings.  My husband loves it.  Next time I will add some artichoke hearts.  It is so easy to make.

This recipe is really great and easy to make.  I followed some of the other reviews and added an extra can of soup and a cup of sour cream.  For the top I also used half crushed potato chips (I used Lays) and then half french fried onions.  It turned out very creamy and then an extra bit of flavor on top.  Next time I may leave out the sliced mushrooms and only use an extra can of soup OR a cup of sour cream and see how that is, just to save on $$.

Great recipe. wife and i really enjoyed it kids not so much. after reading a few of the posts on this recipe being a little dry i added a half a can of milk (mushroom soup can). the dish came out terrific. not dry at all. also instead of using potato chips, i used French's french fried onions. as far as ingredients i used the whole can of mushrooms and i used a 3rd can of tuna. will make it again.

Outstanding recipe.  Lives up to its name.  I must confess I did follow the suggestion of several others and added 3/4 cup sour cream and used crushed french fried onions instead of potato chips.  Everything else including quantities remained the same.  Even my sister-in-law said it was the best tuna casserole she had ever eaten....high praise indeed.

Reading the  other raters info.  I added about 3/4 cup sour cream and it was perfect.  Very moist!  I also added the entire amount of cheese when mixing into the noodles.
My friends loved this comfort meal!

Changed it just a tiny bit, as have so many others (whom I thank for their suggestions) by cooking the onions in butter to sweat them out, adding 1.5 cups of milk, omitting the mushrooms, adding additional frozen peas, dotting the top of the potato chips and cheese with butter and cooking it at 375 for 30 minutes.  The cheese was bubbly, the potato chip topping was crispy, and the entire dish was creamy and comforting.

This is a great quick dinner.  It is adaptable to what you had on hand.  I added green peppers, cornflakes instead of chips, onion powder, fresh garlic, paprika and a can of milk along with the cheese, tuna, soup and pasta.  It was creamy and yummy.

I don't generally make this kind of casserole but tried it after all the good reviews.  I am glad I did :-).  I followed the recipe but halved it, and after reading the reviews the only thing I did was to add 1/4 cup of milk to counteract the reported dryness.  I also reduced the heat to 180C and cooked for about 30 minutes.  I was impressed with the end result and will definately make it again but will add my own touches.  The crunchy topping was ok but needs some fine tuning for my taste.  All-in-all a big thumbs up and really quick to prepare.

Overall very good.  I used cream of celery soup since my husband and I do not care for mushrooms.  I added a little milk just to make sure it didnt turn out dry.  The only thing I would add next time is a little more chips or any topping. What the recipe called for didnt seem like enough to make a crunchy topping, which is was hoping for.

This really was the best tuna casserole I've ever had. Made just a few modifications..I used rotini, we were out of egg noodles. I used a 26 oz can of cream of mushroom soup, and about 6 oz of sour cream, plus 1/2 cup of milk. I love onion, so I added slightly more, about 1/2 cup. I didn't have enough cheddar, so I used a combination of mozzerella and cheddar.  I don't buy potato chips, so I used panko crumbs instead. This was creamy and delicious, not at all dry. My family loved this, and I think I'll make it exactly the same way next time.

This is a great recipe, and easy! The only thing I would recommend is to go light on the onion. It overwhelmes the rest of the casserole if you use what the recipe calls for. 4+ stars!

I am usually not a big fan of Tuna Casserole, but my family is.  My husband found and made this recipe.  After reading other suggestions, we did add a little milk so it did not dry out.  I must say I was truly impressed.  I actually crave Tuna Casserole now.

Delicious! I did what previous reviews suggested, and also I replaced mushroom soup with cream of celery, really seems to revitalize the flavor of dishes that always call for cream of mushroom.

Very tasty, but a little on the dry side, love the crunchy chip-cheese topping.  I will make this again,with a few tweeks, more soup, milk, saute the onions, add some garlic.

Made a half recipe of this tonight for our dinner.  I grated my onion into the casserole because I didn't think it would get cooked enough and I did also add some milk to keep it moist.  I didn't have any chips, but I did have a half of a can of french fried onions to use up so I put those on top.  This was very tasty and I was able to put this on the table very quickly after work.  For the reviewer who said this was "too bland", don't be afraid to add a little pepper and some garlic powder to this.

I used a 16 oz package of noodles and added an extra can of mushroom soup as others suggested.  Instead of potato chips I used the fried onions.  Easy and better than the tuna helper we've been using.

Delish! I did make a few changes.  I did not use onions or mushrooms, only peas.  I added onion powder, salt and pepper.  I also added one can of milk and 1/4c. mayo to make it creamier and not dry.  Definelty will make again!

Overall great!!!!! I have very picky eaters at home and I used frozen mixed veggies, added half cup of milk and one serving spoonful of mayo. Definately helped keep it moist. Could have cooked the onions a bit longer or even sauteed them first. I will be adding this to my recipes.

As I was mixing everything together to transfer to the pan for baking, it looked very dry.  I decided to add a 16 oz. container of sour cream and this seemed to do the trick.  It was delicious and provided plenty of leftovers!  There wasn't quite enough chips on the top for my family's liking so the next time I made it I increased the chips to two cups.

Very good recipe!  But like other reviewers you could add another can of soup; more noodles & double the tuna.  Used a mix of albacore & plain canned tuna.  Picky kids love this recipe.

This was a delicious dish! I did tweak it however, noticing that others had wished that they added an extra can, I thought I would just go ahead and do it. Turned out quite great, and not dry at all, even when I accidently let it stay in an extra 5 mins. Whoops! Nice and crispy on top, creamy and delicious underneath! Try it one night, it was a huge hit!

Quick,easy,good stuff. Just a few suggestions -dice onions & sautee especially if you have young children. I also added a 1/2 can more soup, and salt & pepper to taste which was much needed IMO.

This was super tasty!  I used fresh mushrooms and cooked them with the onion before putting them in the casserole.  It solved the other reviewer issue with dryness.  I also used some grated parmesan cheese i had lying around the house.  Yummy!

I gave this 5 stars but I did make a few changes. I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. I also added 3/4 soup can of milk since a few reviewers stated theirs came out kind of dry.  I also added 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper.  I also sliced up 4 portabello musrhooms and added it to the mixture. I got a thumbs up from my picky 10 year old and my boyfriend adored it.

Gave it two stars only cause easy to make, but very bland.  Ended up throwing out most of it and I added salt & pepper.  Better Homes & Gardens cookbook (red flannel look cover) is thee best tuna recipe by far.

I think that the next time I make this recipe, I will put all of the cheese on top so that I can taste it.  I used lowfat Ritz crackers instead of chips.  I will also add a pinch of onion powder next time.  Nice, easy recipe.

This was great. Followed it mostly but omitted the onion and mushrooms, and used drained french-cut green beans instead of peas. Only had one can cream of mushroom soup on hand so I used it along with a can of cream of celery. Pleasantly surprised at how GREAT it tasted!! Added some garlic salt and a few good dashes of pepper. Mixed soup, salt/pepper, tuna, 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, 1 and 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup sour cream, and green beans in a mixing bowl. Added half to bottom of porcelain baking dish, added cooked noodles, then added the rest of the mix on top and slowly mixed in the dish. Added bread crumbs mixed with melted garlic butter on top. Bake 425 for about 11 min (my oven cooks really fast). Viola!! Super. Thanks!!

Loved! Loved! Loved! This one is a keeper. With a hubby and 3 boys, it's hard to please everyone. Trust me, nobody was excited about this dish until they tasted it. I followed advise from others and added a little milk and 1/4 cup sour cream. It turned out creamy and moist. I also crushed french fried onions along with the chips for the topping.

I really LOVED this tuna casserole! I have never really liked tuna casserole before, but I have been trying new crockpot and casserole recipes and figured "Why not?". I used whole grain spiral noodles, added more cream of mushroom soup, and substituted the chips for whole grain crackers (good carbs). The only thing I will do differently next time is cook the onions prior to mixing them into the casserole (they were a little overwhelming) and I will either 1/2 or totally omit the peas...and add more tuna. Otherwise I will be adding this one to my cookbook :)

Great casserole.  My family loves this - even though they thought they would hate it!  The only thing I did different, was add 1 c. mayonnaise to help the moisture.

This is excellent with some tweeking.  I made just half a recipe but used two cans of tuna (one was pretty skimpy) and added half a soup can of milk to the soup.  I skipped the mushrooms and used celery instead. Wish I had used more. My only complaint is the number of servings it says it will make.  Six? Forget it!  More like 10 or 12.  Half the recipe is more than enough for six very hungry eaters. Next time I"ll cut it in half again for my DH and me.

Seeing this old favorite sent me running to my recipe box (I still have an offline one!) to see if I had kept my mother's version. It's gone but I am sure she used at least 1/4 tsp of Worchestershire sauce as well which gives it some zip. A bit of hot sauce might be good too.

I needed a recipe because my favorite one is packed in boxes....not as good as the one I usually use.  Bland, but I didn't want to add anymore salt because of the 2 cans of soup.  I made the mistake of not tasting until it was on the table because how can you screw up Tuna Casserole, right?  Too late at that point to add anything else.  I will use my own recipe in the future.

This was so yummy. I made exactly as stated, only I didn't measure the potato chips, so I'm sure that a few more than 1 cup fell onto the top of my casserole. My fiance loved it, and kept saying that it was pretty. Which was kind of weird. (I guess the one his mom used to make him was not much to look at) A very good and EASY dinner.

this was a great comfort food! As usual, I made a few modifications. I used reduced fat cheddar cheese and low fat mushroom soup. I used whole wheat dilatini pasta instead of egg noodles. I added salt and pepper. I topped it with some of those French's fried onions instead of potato chips, simply because that is what I had on hand. Lastly I cut the recipe in half. I could get roughly 4 servings out of a half! It was very filling.

My boyfriend and I loved this! Only changed a few things: used onion powder instead of onion, crackers on top instead of potato chips, and dumped in the water from the tuna (heard from other posters that it might dry out.) What we got was a creamy and tasty tuna casserole that I will definitely make again.

Definitely a good "base" recipe.  But I used less noodles so it would be more moist.  I also used frozen peas and carrots.  And everything is better w/ a just a little mayo added.   Great comfort food for a cold and rainy day.

Normally I make a recipe exactly as written the first time but I had to make a few changes because of what I had on hand and family tastes. I used Colby and Jack cheese because that was what I had and I omitted the peas and mushrooms and added frozen corn and frozen green beans instead because of family preference. I crushed seasoned croutons (I make my own but store bought works too) and spread on top instead of chips because I only had BBQ chips and I thought that would just be gross. This was fantastic!! My husband proclaimed better than my other tuna & noodles recipe which was his mothers recipe! THAT is a compliment! Even the kids ate extra helpings and leftovers! This is definitely a keeper!

This was pretty good.  Like other reviewers, I found it rather dry, even after adding ~1/2 c. milk.  I also added some pimientos, which were a delicious flavor boost.  I loved the potato chip & cheese layer.

This is a great standard!  I did change it a little.  I added one can of corn and green beans each, used fresh mushroom, used green onions, added a teaspoon of salt, used two 10 oz. cans of Cream of Mushroom, added 3/4 cup of half and half and used bread crumbs in place of potato chips. I cooked it about 15 minutes longer with 10 minutes at the end covered to heat it throughout. My 4 year old son LOVED it and ate two bowls!  Will use again and again!

Wow! I'm not a big tuna and onion fan so I made up for the loss with some roasted red peppers, poblano peppers, and green onions in the topping. Absolutely delicious! I also added a can's worth of milk in addition to the two cans of soup, came out PERFECT.  I will definitely experiment more with this recipe!

Like others, I added about 1/3 cup of milk to keep it moist.  I left out the chips (it seemed like wasted calories) and the cheese (i just cant bring myself to mix fish and cheese).   A tasty budget-friendly meal.

I made this twice now.  The first time was just okay with the chips getting soggy once refrigerated.  But, the second time, I guess I followed the recipe correctly because it was good!  I added 4 oz of milk to get a more saucy servings as others have suggested.

My husband LOVED this dish, he said it was better than his mother's (which he has NEVER remotely said about anything before), We both thought it was a little bland, I'll just spice it up better next time, I did add about 1/4 cup milk as others suggested, I also only made half of the recipe.

This was great!! Upon the advice of other reviewers, I added a little milk and instead of using 2 small cans of cream of mushroom, I used one large 26 ounce can. I didn't use onions either; I opted to use onion powder instead. Didn't measure cheese or peas, I just added what I thought was sufficient. Also, I used crushed butter crackers for the topping. All my picky kids loved it. There wasn't any leftovers. Will make again very soon!!

This was pretty good, except for the fact that it needed more veggies. Next time around I will add a cup of carrots and some more peas. I also listened to the other reviews and added a cup of milk to mine which worked out well. It was not dried out at all. Also the one comment that my boyfriend said (and I have to agree with him) was that it needed some garlic, maybe two tablespoons, more veggies and it needed more onions. I will next time increase my version to a half an onion or one whole small one. But all and all he ate it and went back for seconds :)

I omitted the peas and mushrooms and used homemade cream of chicken soup instead. I also didn't drain the tuna.  Oops! I didn't follow the recipe very well did I. But it was scrumptious! The whole family gobbled it up.

I have made this several times now. Absolutely delicious!!! I have made the original recipe, and also tweeked it according to my family's taste or the lack of ingredients in the pantry. This recipe is very forgiving if you are missing peas or canned, sliced mushrooms, try chopped celery. A friend of mine hates anything with mushroom, so I will use cream of celery instead, etc... Also, I enjoy using the Sour Cream & Onion flavored potato chips to sprinkle on top. Next time I will use French's Cheddar Fried Onions. Yummmy!

I added 3/4 cup of milk and a spoonful of sour cream to combat the dryness others mentioned. My problem with the dish was that the onion didn't cook at all inside the mixture so biting into raw pieces was kind of unpleasant (and I normally love onions!) If I made it again, I would saute the onions first and either used canned peas (as opposed to frozen) or substitute for broccoli or asparagus. My boyfriend said "it tastes like Tuna Helper but took you three times as long to make it." I may try it again, but with the changes listed above.

I have a tried and true tuna casserole that I've been using for years.  I made this one based on one single review - she described this as an "adult version" of tuna casserole.  What an accurate description.  It's not overly cheesy, the veggies add a bit of class (as much as tuna casserole can be classy), and overall, it was a good weekday dinner.  The only change I made was using bread crumbs instead of potato chips on top.

My kids devoured this and they dont really like tuna casserole.  I added 4 cans of tuna for 20 oz total  and I used 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup and I added the 1/2cup of milk.  I also used bread crumbs instead of potato chips.  I also added some garlic powder and ground pepper.  Its DELICIOUS!!!

Great! Here is a better solution to those of you wanting more moisture: add a 1/2 can of milk or evaporated milk. My wife's recipe does this. Plus she adds lots of black pepper and pimentos finely chopped.

This recipe has become a staple in my menu planning.  I add an extra can of tuna for additional protein and 1 cup roughly diced carrots to boost the veggie factor.  I also omit the mushrooms as they are "gross", at least that's what I'm told.  I blanch the carrots in the noodle water just before draining them.  When I was short potato chips and in a pinch I used pancko bread crumbs with 1/4 cup cheese mixed in for some fat. I also used sour cream and onion potato chips which made it a little too salty.  All-in-all, a huge hit!

Needed milk.  It was a little dry, adding milk really helped. Also added just a bit more mushroom soup.

as suggested, i added about a half cup of sour cream to combat the dryness.  i also topped with buttered ritz crackers (i didn't have any potato chips).  the ritz crackers stepped it up a notch!!  this was a GREAT recipe!  my husband doesn't love tuna, but went back for seconds on this dish.  two thumbs up :)

this is a great casserole. I made a healthier version by using 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, whole wheat  bowtie pasta instead of egg noodles, frozen mixed veggies and lowfat cheese. I also used lowfat ritz crackers for the crust instead of potato chips. It was yummy!

I tried to be true to the recipe but did add some milk to it because I could tell when I was mixing everything together that it was going to be dry. I'm use to my mom's simple Tuna recipe - which is thick and creamy. I was not a fan of this and will not be making again. I'm always up for trying something new because you never know.

I definitely like this recipe. Even with the onions, my kids didn't complain. I did change a few things though. I used rotini pasta since I didn't have noodles on hand. Also subbed crackers instead of potato chips. I added milk from the review suggestions. Felt that it lacked something...maybe sour cream? I'm going to add that next time I make this. It was still very good though and very easy to make!

I added about a 1/2 cup of sour cream and about a quarter cup of milk. I used French's Onions instead of chips. The onions on top were burnt but my husband and girls still ate it all up in one night. No left overs. At my house that means 5 stars. This was the best I've ever made.

Comes out dry and bland.  Unless you like the raw onion taste, I suggest you saute the onions first too.

I have made this several times now, so easy and soo delicious!! A few things I do differently: *I don't add the onion or mushrooms.*I also add 1 cup of milk, and an extra can of cream of mushroom soup. * I add the chips AFTER baking, to each persons individual bowl.

Ugh...I'm sorry but I have no idea why this has such good reviews.  I usually make my own version and decided to follow a recipe this time - mistake.  If you're going to make it, please cook the onions before adding - otherwise they stay crunchy and I do not care for that.

Great classic tuna noodle hotdish (as we call it in Minnesota). I didn't quite have enough frozen peas so I added a stalk of celery. Only used a couple of tablespoons of onion. I also added the onion and celery to the boiling noodles for the last three minutes to soften. The potato chips are a MUST!

I baked this at 375 until the cheese was bubbling (about 30 minutes).  This was tasty but mine turned out a liitle dry even though I added 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup sour cream.  I added a little more milk at the end and that helped.  Next time I think I will make it with less noodles and see if that helps.

Yummy ...what a hit.  Made a few additions, some as previously suggested.  I did add an egg and about 1/2 cup milk and more cheese.  I also used green beans, corn, carrots, red bell pepper and diced jalapeno's for some "kick".  Will make over and over it was gone, gone, gone

GREAT!! My parents and kids loved it!  I added garlic powder, onion salt, and a few other spices.  I added a bit more cheese, some milk to make it creamier (about 1/2 cup), I used canned corn and canned peas, and I also used a bit of miracle whip to make it a bit tangier.  Oh, and I used corn chips on top!    My mom decided to put some soy sauce on it, and it was so good I decided to hve another helping just so I could have some with soy sauce :] (3 or 4 stars as written, but with adjustments a definite 5!!)

I love this recipe. Some things I do differently. I use 2 shredded boneless chicken breasts instead of tuna (guess that makes it a chicken casserole). 1 cup of milk, 2 beaten eggs a ful bag of egg noodles in a 2 qt dish. All my boys absolutly love it.

After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 cup of milk and also half a cup of sour cream.  I didn't potato chips, so I added the fried onions on top.  We really enjoyed this recipe and I will definitley make again.

I read the reviews about it being dry and added 1/2 cup milk to the recipe.  I also baked it for the first 10 minutes with tinfoil on top and it came out fine.  Next time I will omit the onion just as a personal preference.

Great potluck option! I sauteed the onions first, otherwise, they came out rather raw even after baking.

Very good but I think does need a little more liquid. I add about a cup of milk. Other than that this is the recipe I use for tuna casserole.

I subsituted potato chips for gold fish. I thought about using french fried onions as well but goldfish sounded good.   A bit dry, used another can of cream of mushroom and I love tuna so I threw in another can. I didn't feel like peas so I left them out for today.   The end result was yummy! Next time I wanna try a combo of cheese just to change it up a bit.

This was fabulous, my family went back for seconds and thirds. It was so easy to make, a wonderful recipe to make with children that are always wanting to help out with cooking supper. Me and my girls had a fun time making it as well as eating it. I will have to try it with the onions next time. My daughter does not like them, so we left them out this time. But I will definately be making again, maybe half with onions and half without. I do like the suggestion to sautee the onion first and will probably do that. Thank you for this recipe!

I did not like this. I think the onion needs to be sauteed first to make this more kid friendly.  The flavor was bland even though I added garlic salt and used sharp cheddar cheese and added sour cream.  Also, I think 425 is way too high and makes the casserole dry out .  350 for 30 minutes would be more appropriate.

Eh, not great. I've had much better. The onions didn't cook all the way and I just didn't love it. It was edible though. I wouldn't make again.

This was so yummy.  We picked the recipe because of the potato chip topping, thinking it was a neat idea.  The whole thing was amazing.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  It has gotten added to our regular rotation of meals.

This dish was very yummy and easy to make.  I did make a few alterations. I added extra cheese and milk to the noodle mixture along with corn and peas (instead of just peas) and added more cheese to the top of the mixture with bread crumbs instead of potato chips. The extra milk and cheese really helped with the "dryness" problem that everyone else has been talking about. I do want to try it with potato chips on top - i just didn't have them handy at the time. I was a little scared about adding the can of cream of mushroom soup to it because neither me nor my husband like mushrooms but fortunately we couldn't taste them at all! Overall it was a very tasty dish and i will make it again. :)

If you are looking for a CLASSIC tuna casserole recipe this is it!! Very good...BUT  after reading reviews I made a one change that I think is necessary.  It needs more liquid.  I used 3 cans of soup for mine, instead of 2 AND added about a cup of milk.  I can't imagine that it would be anything but bone dry otherwise!  Also, I mixed in the 2 cups of cheese and added a tiny bit more to the top under the recommended layer of potato chips.

Fantastic recipe! The only change I made - which I HIGHLY recommend - was substituting out the cream of mushroom soup. Instead, I used a corn & roasted pepper soup from Trader Joe's. Fabulous!!

Best tuna casserole I've ever tasted.  I added a little half and half to make it creamier and topped with French's onions since I didn't have potato chips. My kids do not care for tuna and they really enjoyed this. A definite keeper!!

This is a great casserole.  I've made it twice for different people and has been liked by all, young or old.  I added 1 cup sour cream to the recipe and mixed all the cheese into the noodles, but other than that, same same.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made a few changes of my own. Instead of egg noodles, I used whole wheat egg noodles! Fantastic. Also, I used one of those big cans of cream of mushroom so it was a little more than the recipe called for and it turned out perfect! Even my picky boyfriend enjoyed it. It made enough for us to have left overs like 3 times. And it was better every time! Good recipe!

Four stars but needs some changes. First, I would suggest dried onions because it does not cook long enough for fresh. Next, cook for 45 minutes on 350. My casserole wasn't warmed all the way through following the recipe. And last, like most other reviewers, I agree this casserole is a bit dry. I added 1/2 c milk but it did not do the trick. All in all, I think there are better tuna casserole recipes on this website.

this really was the best tuna casserole I've ever made from scratch.  It was perfect for the last minute meal I had to put together last night.  I can't wait to make it again and again with the different variations I've read about it.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so i had to use cream of chicken but it was still wonderful.  thanks for the recipe.

I haven't had tuna casserole in probably 15 years.  This was good.  I did read the reviews of others.  I used 16 ounce of egg noodles, 18 ounce tuna, used 40 ounce of cream soup, and added 1 cup of milk.  I believe next time, I will not add the chips to the top.   THANK U for sharing, It's a keeper.

Thanks for the great starting point! I admit I totally switched things around.... Since I only cooked for 2, I halved it. I used a 2 qt glass dish. I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can tuna, 1/3 box of cooked rotini. 1/4 c heavy cream. 2 Handfulls of cheddar. No chips on top, no peas. 2oz jarred sliced mushrooms.**DEFINATELY use red onion**  I found that broiling it toward the end made the top very tasty (make sure you top it with a layer of cheese before cooking). No fancy seasoning needed, just good, creamy and cheesy tuna noodle casserole!

I have made this over and over again. It reminds me of how my Mom used to make it, but even better! I like to use the french-fried onions on top instead of potato chips, and the frozen peas are a must! I would also recommend adding just a touch of milk to keep it super moist in the oven.

This was very good, but I did add about a half cup of sour cream and a little milk so it wouldn't be dry.  Also, I added some garlic-pepper seasoning and a little cayenne pepper.  I didn't have any potato chips, so I just used some plain dry bread crumbs.  I think it would've been even better with the potato chips though.

Crazy good, I knew only 3 or 4 people would eat it in the family (darn picky eaters), but I didn't have any leftovers. I didn't add any extra liquids, followed it to the recipe and it was just right.

I loved this recipe! I was craving classic tuna casserole, and this hit the mark. Taking heed of other reviewers' comments about dryness, I added a half-cup of sour cream. I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so I left them out but added about 1/3 cup more peas. Delish!

I followed others' suggestions and added half cup of milk and another can of soup. I also added another can of tuna because I didn't think there was enough. Next time I will add salt and pepper as well.

I've made this several times. Excellent tuna casserole. I add an extra can of tuna and season with some garlic, onion, and cayenne powders to taste. It does get dry around the edges in a rectangular dish, so add more soup or use a circular casserole dish.

This was awesome! My husband gave it a 9 1/2 out of 10. I used froz broc instead of peas & I used the low fat version of the Mushroom soup. I also used seasoned (bagged) croutons instead of chips, I will make this again for sure!

This is the first time I made tuna casserole.  It was amazing!  I used sour cream and onion rippled potato chips and it was delicious.  Only thing I would do differently next time is to make more!

I made this recipe exactly as written and have to agree with the others that it needs more moisture, more seasonings and more cheese.  Next time I will either up the soup or add milk, additionally will put 2 cups of cheese in the casserole add salt and pepper.  I think sticking with the potatoe chips is what actually saved this dish.  The additional salt and crunch was welcome in this somewhat bland dish.  I will make again however because it is easy and quick with the above mentioned alterations.

My husband wanted a tuna casserole like his mother used to make so he found this recipe and made it for me.  I was shocked at how good it was.  The only tuna casserole I've ever had was fishy and icky tasting.  This one was creamy and delicious.  He did add a couple of tablespoons of miracle whip for extra zing and used french fried onions instead of potato chips because that is what his mother always did.  We will definitely be making this one of our go to quick recipes.

Yum! I love tuna casserole and I've been searching for something I love as much as the stuff out of the box (ha). This was really delicious!   Here are my only changes: I used whole wheat egg noodles.I used 1 can of mushroom soup and 1 can of cheddar soup (I like my tuna casserole cheesy). I omitted the mushrooms and peas because I don't like them. Used the onion, though I added a little fresh garlic. Oh, and I used food processed cheddar french fried onions instead of chips, since I really don't like chips.   This is a great recipe and easily tweaked to suit the tastes of the people in the house. Thanks! It's a keeper!

I did not know that I liked Tuna Cassrole until I tried this recipe.  I've made it twice now.  Great on the budget also.  All ingredients, plus a salad still cost about 10 bucks.

What do you do when you have a few cans of tuna on hand and you're debating what to make for dinner? You make this recipe! It was very good, and we all enjoyed it very much. My minor alterations: One extra can of tuna; corn flakes instead of chips (covered with spray butter); and frozen peas and carrots instead of just peas. I will definitely make this again.

REALLY good and easy and adaptable. I used 1 can cr of mushroom, and 1 can cr of chicken, since that's what I had.  Added 1 can milk as others suggested.  I added 1 1/2 cans mushrooms, as we are mushroom lovers.  Mixed the cheese in rather than put half on top.   Also I had no egg noodles or potato chips, so I used shell noodles and buttered seasoned bread crumbs for the top (which made a nice crunchy crust). Added approx. 1 tsp salt, and 2 tsp pepper, and 1 tsp celery seed for flavor. I have been resisting making *any* tuna casseroles, since my mother made the most awful tuna casseroles for us as kids(lol).  My boyfriend sort of dared me to try one, and I'm glad I picked this recipe! I noticed a few reviewers did not like the onions, but we thought they added good flavor and texture.Really good and so easy.

My family and I absolutely LOVEEEE this recipe!! I've made it about 3 time snow. I read and followed the other user review's once, followed the recipes as is once, and then did my own alterations. The user reviews turned out to be very helpful with my own alterations. I omitted the mushrooms, we're not a big fan, and felt there was enough in the mushroom soup. I sauteed the onion in 2TBS of butter until tender then I mixed it with the peas and used 1 can mushroom soup, 1 can cheddar soup instead of the 2cns mushroom. I also mixed in 1/2 can milk and 1 cup of sour cream, it was very creamy not at all soupy, but with the perfect consistency. I also sprinkled in about 1 tbs of salt, 2tbs of pepper, and 2tbs of garlic powder. I sprinkle the cheese on before sprinkling on the lays original potato chips. This recipe gets a RAVE review from me and have been asked for the recipe from out company pinic! Thank you for sharing!

Great basic comfort food. Probably the only dish that calls for condensed soup that doesn't bother me. Made the recipe as is except for adding some extra chips cause thats my favorite part.

I thought this was really good! Two things I hate about baked casseroles is 1. they get dry 2. dont like crunchy raw veggies in my cooked dishes So I made a couple changes that I was happy with.  I sauteed onion, finely sliced celery and grated carrot, and mixed the cheese in so it wouldn't "peel right off" like another reviewer said happened to hers :) I also added another can of soup and a half can of skim...It was really quite good and will make it again as my usual tuna casserole, since my "usual" one I eat without baking because it gets dry :)

I give this recipe 4 stars only because of the changes I made. I don't like peas or mushrooms (although I like cream of mushroom soup for casseroles). So I used green beans and corn, I added 1/2C milk to make it creamier, I used 2 cups shredded cheese mixed in with the casserole and an extra cup to top it off, I also used a 2qt round dish to bake it in. It turned out quite delicious!

I had to go with a four because my daycare kids didn't touch it.:( I thought it was pretty good though. I added an extra can of soup and mixed in the cheese instead of putting it on top. My husband was disappointed we weren't having it for dinner. I'll make it again for my family, but not for work.

Very good tuna noodle (my picky kids loved it).  As per the suggestions in the reviews, I wanted to add an extra 1/2 can of soup...but did not have any on hand so I added about 3/4 cup of sour cream and it came out great.  I also tossed in a few chopped carrots for color.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good tuna casserole. I also added the sour cream with the soups as well as the pepper. Used vegetable crackers instead of potatoe chips or ritz crackers; it added some additional flavor. Tip; do not over cook, cheese on top will get hard and crunchy.

Very good.  Obviously tailor it to your tastes...I added lots of veggies including broccoli and green beans, a little milk, and I topped it with a tortilla/onion mix. 
But the original version is good too.

Only gave this 3 stars because it was just plain ole tuna casserole; guess I was thought the chips would add a special element.  It was good, but nothing that I haven't tasted before.

Overall, very tasty. However, I think that 425 is too high of an oven temperature... it got too hot and more burned on top than I would have liked to see it and despite adding in extra moisture (3 cans of soup!) as other reviewers recommended it was still a little on the dry side. I'll make it again because I love tuna casserole and I liked the fresh onions, but I would keep it covered and bake for 35-40, remove cover and bake an additional 5 minutes to toast the top. Also, did 1/2 topped with potato chips and 1/2 topped with French Fried Onions and both my boyfriend and I preferred the French Fried Onion topping much more.

This is such a great recipe. I usually add more tuna and cream of mushroom soup. The potato chips are not very good reheated, so I would sprinkle it one an individual portion instead of over all of it. It is even great without the chips. My fiance loves it when I make tuna casserole!

We found this recipe to be very tasty and overall great. The only changes I made were to use a teaspoon of onion soup mix instead of chopped fresh onion and I used a can of cream of celery soup in substitution for one of the cans of cream of mushroom. We will definetly have this dish again. Thankyou.

This dish was just okay. I followed the recipe but substituted the potato chips for french fried onions and covered while baking to keep it from drying out. I thought it needed something else as it seemed bland. Overall this dish was average, I would probably make it again but would "tweek" the recipe to make it more appealing to my family.

This is a very easy, tasty recipes: my kids and even my husband agree! But it looked too dry so I added half cup of soy milk. Came out great! Next time I may add some chopped celery. I like the crunch.

This was really good, but I didn't care for the potato chips, and the cheese got overdone on top.  I will make again but this time with out the chips and I will put foil on the top, or put the cheese on in the last 15 min.

This came out really tasty! Here's what I did differently. I had canned salmon (15oz) so I used that. Added about 1/2 cup of sour cream, forgot the onions and insteads of peas and mushrooms used about 1.5 cups of frozen mixed veggies. Since I used sharp cheddar and regular cream of mush. (instead of reduced sodium) I only added pepper. The only salt that I used was in the water for the pasta. It didn't need any added in the dish itself. Great comfort dish!

Not sure if I'll make this again.  It was pretty bland.  Don't get me wrong I did have it for lunch the next day, but it was missing something. If i ever try this again I'll follow everyone else's advise and add some seasoning to it.  I followed this recipe step by step.

Pretty good.  I added sour cream for a little bite and some fresh pepper.  I didn't have any chips so I used Fritos.  Not such a good idea, won't do that again.  Overall, it was ok.  My fish hating daughter even ate it!

Not the best. I followed the recipes to a "T" and it came out dry and flavorless. My suggestion to anyone who may try this is Add milk, Salt, Black pepper.  I think the recipe itself is a good template but needs some personal tweaking!

Simple to make and delicious. I used frozen mixed vegetables,used a smaller casserole dish to prevent drying per other reviews, and only left in oven for maybe 10 mins, just so cheese is melted. Will make again.

I really liked this recipe!  I didn't have all the ingredients . .. so I used . . .Cream of Chicken soup instead of the mushroom, frozen spinach instead of peas, no mushrooms, and I added a small amount of green olives to the portion that I would eat.  Mine wasn't dry at all!  Very good!

I'm using this as the basis for my tuna casserole dishes.  I noted the comments on dryness and went with a larger can of mushroom soup.  It's nice because it uses all pretty much stock ingredients, and with a casserole you can liberally substitute things.

I made this lastnight for my husband, who really doesn't care much for tuna.  He cleared his plate, twice, but wasn't raving about it.  It really is a great comfort food type of meal, but I'll admit something felt like it was missing.  After reading previous reviews, I knew to add milk, I added about 1 1/4 cans of milk.  Mine wasn't dry at all.  I also discarded about 1 1/2 cups of cooked noodles.  I used extra cheese in the casserole, and less on top (which I added in the last 10 minutes of baking).  I used green beans instead of peas, which may have contributed to it needing more salt and flavor.  I will definitely make this again, but will use more cheese, more salt and pepper, and will add miced garlic as well.  FYI, I'm having the leftovers as I write this -- they're almost better because the onions have now permeated the casserole.  If you plan on having some left for later don't top that area with potato chips when you bake it, add them after you reheat.

Well, I thought this dish was OK, although everyone else liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used whole wheat noodles.  I just thought it lacked something, maybe it was the noodles.  I'll make it again...just not right away.

I have not had tuna casserole in years and neither had my husband so I tried your recipe and we ate almost the whole casserole! It was soooo good. Great comfort food.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now, it really is the best tuna casserole recipe out there. It is creamy & cheesy & very easy to adjust to your tastes or throw additional ingredients in. I follow the recipe exactly & it is perfect. Thanks!

Very easy to put together~I used sour cream and chive crushed chips and mixed in a little extra into the casserole itself in addition to putting them ontop. I also reccomend seasoning it to taste before baking...I added salt, pepper, a little garlic, etc.

I make this all the time. I omit the sliced mushrooms because my son hates them and I replace the crushed potato chips with crushed Ritz crackers. I also saute a little onion and celery and add that as well. My family loves this.

Good recipe but I tweaked it some.  Used a big can of cream of mushroom soup (26 oz) with 3/4 cup of milk (would use 1 cup next time).  Added 2 TBSP of pimentos and topped with Durkee fried onions instead of chips.  Would really be good with small can of sliced water chestnuts.  Good basic recipe.

I made this thinking it would be enough for 2 adults and 3 teenage girls. I really didn't think they would eat very much of it with it having tuna AND peas. But they ate the entire pan. My husband and I had a small serving and it left us wanting to make a second pan. It was very delicious! Like the tuna casserole my mom made!

Just made this recipe for the first time. I read several of the reviews AFTER I made it. My husband and I were both pleased with the results. I did note several of the suggestions for changes/additions for the next time I fix it. We both agreed it's a keeper. Thank you for sharing, Jennifer.

This was very good. My husband and I both had two servings. Used chow mein noodles instead of potato chips and added a little bit of red pepper cut up into small pieces to give it some color and interest.  The chow mein noodles stay very crispy, gives a nice texture. I will definitely use this recipe again. Very easy.

I don't know why I forgot to rate this - but - I've been using this recipe for a long time.   My other half thinks it's the best tuna casserole he ever had.   I also found out that it freezes well.   At least that what he tells me.   I freeze it in small containers for lunches and then he takes it to work.

I like the fact that it's really easy to put together.   I use 1 can of cream of celery with 1 can of cream of mushroom.   I think it gives it a bit of a different flavor.

I also took others advice and add about 1/2 cup of milk.

Very good.

This is as far as you can go with a tuna casserole. We enjoyed it. The potato chips are a nice touch. But I think it's going to be hard to find a 5 star tuna casserole dish. You can only do so much with the ingredients.

THIS was AWESOME!!! My family loved it. Most Tuna Casseroles are so bland - this one definitely was not. I did a little changing - I used 1 can of early June Sweet Peas instead of frozen and I didn't even add the onion or mushrooms. Did everything else though I did use the pouches of albacore tuna in place of canned. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks Jennifer!

This was a good recipe, but seemed to lack something. I actually think the Tuna helper tastes better than this. I don't think I will make it again, because the Tuna helper is cheaper and tastes about the same.

My family did not like this at all.  5 year old grand
-daughter wouldn't eat it and she loves noodles.  I
didn't want to give up on it so I froze some that was
left {I don't like throwing out food} and reheated it
for her and she still wouldn't eat it.  Some day when
I am home alone I will force it dosn.  Sorry.

We regularly make this with out the potato chips, its healthier.  We also don't add any sliced mushrooms for pure taste/texture reasons. My fiancee is not so fond of the onion flavor but I like the extra zip it gives.

If you downsize the recipe remember that the numbers within the directions do not change, in specific watch number 3.

I made this using reduced fat/sodium cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup and I also substituted fresh mushrooms for the canned.  After reading the other reviews, I added about 3/4 c. milk to make it moister. I didn't like the way it tasted hot out of the oven, but leftovers the next day, and the next were tastier and the addition of peas really makes the difference, I think.  I forgot to add them in when I put the casserole in the oven, so I served them as a side dish.  This recipe didn't knock my socks off, but it was okay.  I liked the addition of potato chips for the topping.

This is a standard in my house.  My husband really loves it. I ususally do not add the potatoe chips and double the mushrooms.  I often cut the entire recipe in half (really only feeding 2 people) and add onion powder if I don't have an extra onion handy on a weeknight.

I also doubled up on the mushrooms (used brandywine sliced) and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Added just a tad more onions.  Next time will use less noodles than called for.  It was kind of dry.  Think I may use a casserole dish instead of a 9 x 13 pan.  Overall, the flavor was very good.  Just needed to be creamier!

This recipe looked great and tasted yummy! I substituted seasoned bread crumbs for the potato chips and cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom. I also added a little sour cream. This is the best tuna casserole recipe I've tried so far! I can't wait for my family to try it.

Good taste when it first came out of the oven, but still very dry & sticky (I only used 1/2 bag of noodles). Leftovers were awful. But fast and easy. If I make again I will add milk.

This was SO EASY!  My husband is not a big fan of tunafish, but he actually cleaned his plate.  I think the cheese and the potato chips makes a big difference.  Will Definitely Make Again!

I am not a big fan of tuna but this recipe was very good.  The cheese and onion add a lot of flavor.  I used Healthy Request soup and thought the dish could have been a bit saltier, so next time I will try regular cream of mushroom soup.  I added extra peas in place of the mushrooms.  Overall this is a great dish.

I forgot to add on my original review that I added half a cup of milk.  Next time I will add a full cup to make it even creamier.  This is a large recipe, by the way.  I will cut it in half from now on unless I am serving it to more than four people.

I really liked this recipe, and will definitely make it again.  I omitted the onions and mushrooms, and added a cup of frozen peas.  The recipe did not mention whether you were supposed to add the two cans of water to the soup, but I assumed that I was because it would have been way too sticky! I also just added cheese on top, and omitted the chips because I wanted to use this as left overs, and people had written that the chips got soggy.  Overall, a definite keeper! I think it was even better heated up!  Thanks! ~Scarlett

YUMMY! Comfort food for sure. I made it with salteens on top, with the cheddar cheese.  This recipe makes a huge amount, so I've got it stored up in the freezer for the winter weeks ahead.

We ate it (any time my husband will eat something multiple times it is a success) but it was tasteless.  Wasted expensive tuna ($5.00/can).  Should have been called  noodle casserole as that was pretty much all you could taste.  It was really, really dry, like shoe leather.  I used a Pyrex dish and it did not heat the dish all the way through even though I lowered the heat and left it in longer.  It was lukewarm with cold spots.  Pyrex also had some hot spots on the glass so won't use it again.  All in all, a disappointing dish (and container).  Just happy my husband ate it.

Definitely needed to add half a can of milk so it wouldn’t be dry. Since I’ve made it before I used 1/4 can of cream instead off of milk, just for some added creaminess this time. Mmmm

I loved this recipe, when I was stiring all the ingredients it seemed difficult so I added 1/2c or so of milk, smooth as silk I used frozen peas and carrots that I microwave for 6min.before adding,on top of the Sharp Cheddar cheese and chips I added green onion diced for good measure,after 15min at 424 I cooked it at 325 for 10 more & drizzled some melted butter on top. It's absolutely delicious ??!?? my family will love it ????

Baked it in an oval dish instead of a 9” x 12” pan, per others’ instructions, so it wouldn’t be dry - but it still was. It was also way too salty and the onions were hard even after baking it. Definitely won’t use that recipe again.

This made a lot! I scaled it down to 3 servings, and used 2 tuna ina pouch....one regular and 1 siracha thai chili, delish. I also did add a half cup of milk so it wouldn't be dry. Will make again, thanks for the post :)

I liked the sound of this recipe because it was different. Big mistake. This is the first time I made a recipe where my boyfriend  told me it was not good. The flavor was very bland, but it also had a weird taste that I think may have come from the mushroom soup. I understand that everyone's taste differs, so I guess this was the case. Maybe swapping out the mushroom soup for another sauce would save it, because all of the other ingredients were fine.

I used my mozzarella lactose free cheese and bought old Dutch salt and pepper chips. We only buy white albacore tuna so that's what we used. And we omitted the peas as none in our home eats them but me. I wasn't able to eat it because I am gluten intolerant and the egg noodles have gluten. But this was my sons request and all my picky eaters loved it! Great meal super easy to prepare and very short actual cooking time! Loved it thanks for the recipe.

My husband was asking for tuna casserole. I found I didn’t have all the ingredients. So, I faked it. Added  left over fried onion rings, and a little 1/2 and 1/2 as well as a 1/2 cup of mayo in place of the second can of soup (sounds odd, right?). The flavor was fabulous!

Actually a very good basic recipe. I sautéd celery & mushrooms in butter. Added a generous glug of Chardonnay, from the bottle that was being served at dinner. Also , lots & lots of freshly ground pepper. Lays potato chips for topping. Maybe next time, some hot sauce.

I just made this and I want to say that it is NOT anywhere CLOSE to being the best of anything. 

I thought it was really strange that the mushrooms and onions weren’t supposed to be cooked in a skillet beforehand. I was right. It was strange. The mushrooms were still raw and the onions were crunchy. That part was awful. 

I read reviews before making it and it needed so much tweaking to the recipe that it wasn’t even the same recipe anymore. I didn’t have an additional can of soup, since the recipe only called for two. So I saved the recipe by adding about 2 cups of chicken broth because that’s all I had on hand. 

I added an additional can of tuna, pepper, garlic powder, salt, more peas, and cayenne. It would have been good after all of that if I had followed my instincts and cooked the stupid vegetables first.

The only change I made was I omitted the mushrooms.  My sister doesn't like them.  Other than that,  everything stayed the same.  It was a big hit.  I asked her how it was and she said.  "You don't hear me talkin do you?"   Can't wait to make it for my church ladies!

I've been making this recipe for years. But this last time, I didn't realize I didn't have any shredded cheese. The only thing I had to work with on such as was Velveeta jalapeno Cheese sauce. I was a little apprehensive at first. But let me tell you, it was DELICIOUS! My picky 14 yr old even had seconds! I will be making it like that from now on.

12.28.19 Waaaaay too many noodles to the point where you could not even taste the tuna and the other ingredients. I scaled this down to 3 servings which called for 6 oz noodles (which I weighed) and 1/2 can of the mushroom soup.  This was so dry that I ended up using the entire can of soup which still wasn’t enough to give it some moisture.  If I were to make this again, I’d probably reduce the amount of noodles by 50%,  and add some milk and spices.  But think I’ll just be movin’ on; sorry, this just didn’t work for us.

This is a good recipe I will keep!  I did make a few changes though, I use a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken, I added probably 1/2 c more peas, I eyeballed it, but I added probably 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/2-1 t onion powder, 1/4t chili powder, 1/8 t red pepper flakes & kosher salt and pepper to taste.  Instead of using crushed potato chips on top, I used Panko, then drizzled a little (maybe 1 T) melted butter on top then sprikled a little kosher salt top after the cheese.  It turned out really good!

This is a quick, easy recipe and it’s yummy! Perfect for a busy weeknight family supper! I added 1/4c diced celery and I baked in a 2-qt oval casserole. It was not dry at all, and the cheesy, crunchy topping was so good. My  whole family enjoyed it. I will definitely keep this in my monthly rotation.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe. I'm allergic to mushrooms.
I sauteed onions and celery in grape seed oil.  Cream of Celery condensed soup was used instead of Cream of Mushroom soup. I seasoned the tuna with herbs and spices. Also, adding grape seed oil and a dab of cooking sherry. 
I used extra sharp cheddar cheese and seasoned bread crumbs.

I made lots of changes since I was repurposing leftovers.   I used 1/2 the amount of egg noodles, celery instead of peas, cream of chicken soup, no mushrooms, salt, pepper, and I added dill.  I topped it with sour cream and onion flavored chips.  I used a 9x13 pan and covered it with foil.  The texture and moistness were perfect!  Not dry at all and the celery added great crunch.  The flavor was still slightly bland.  I'll add more spices and seasoning to it next time.

I think the potato chips should be added during the last five minutes of baking to prevent scorching them otherwise this recipe is great. Tastes fantasic and is very easy to prepare.

I wasn’t too enthused when my husband requested Tuna  Casserole for dinner. It did not look appetizing either. I followed the recipe but I used fresh mushrooms and sautéed them in butter. I boiled the noodles and added better than bouillon roasted chicken base for added flavor. Drained noodles mixed a little butter in. I mixed all other ingredients together with most of the cheese. I added a little more than a 1/2 cup of sour cream and a half cup of milk. When I added in my sautéd mushrooms I kept butter it was sautéed in and the tuna was added without draining. I turned my oven on to 350 baked for 15 min covered with foil then added oyster and soup crackers and rest of cheese on top and baked for another 12 min

Really good and satisfying. The only change I made was to omit mushrooms as I had run out of them. Didn’t much matter as there were some mushrooms in the soup. Used crushed tortilla chips and liked the corn flavor they added. Also they were very low in salt. Had enough for a meal and two for the freezer.

This is a very good recipe.  I did change it a bit.  I added 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup and added a half a cup of milk and used crushed ritz crackers instead of potato chips.  I also used 2 large cans of tuna.

Made as is, this is a 3 or 4 star recipe.  If a person uses shells instead of egg noodles, cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom, cuts the amount of noodles in half, and adds a tsp of dill, a tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of pepper, and 1/4 tsp of cayenne, this is delicious and worthy of 5 stars.  I have made it several times and this is what I have found to work best.

This was  amazing. Hubby normally doesn’t like tuna casserole but enjoyed this ! For those complaining about it being too dry, rather than using another can of soup try using less noodles.

It was your standard tuna casserole. It wasn't bad but tasted like any other tuna casserole, just with potato chips on top. Very bland even after I mixed in pepper, garlic powder and chipotle chili pepper. I will just stick with my recipe and just put chips on it.

Quick and easy to make!  Grandkids loved it!
To make a better topping  for my picky family, I decided to use Panko bread crumbs. Instead of potato chips.
 I melted 3 Tbs Land o Lakes butter.  When melted I mixed it in 3 c of  Panko Bread crumps.  Then sprinkled it on top and popped in the oven!

We all loved it!  It was fabulous!

Some reviewers said it was dry so I added a 3rd can of soup along with some milk  and since someone said they added sour cream, I did, too.  Pretty much left everything else the same.  It did, in fact, come out nice and moist after 15 minutes.  This was, actually, my first tuna noodle casserole and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Will surely do this again.  Thanks for the post!

I made a few alterations.  My daughter hates mushrooms so I left those out.  She didn't even notice the cream of mushroom soup.  I also left out onions, substituting onion powder instead.  I chose shell pasta (that was all I had in the house).  It was delicious!  I would for sure make this again.

I did exactly what they called for. Except I added a can of cream of celery soup , doubled the recipe, and put a whole bad of crushed chips and about 2 cups of cheese on top. I crushed the chips while they were in the bad with a rolling pin. Added the cheese to the bag, shook it up. And topped the tuna casserole! Great recipe!

Five stars - with the following changes.  I used Gruyere instead of cheddar and sauteed the onion before mixing in.  I also used homemade condensed cream of mushroom soup from Pioneer Woman recipe, and eliminated the canned mushrooms.  Lastly I used fresh whole wheat bread crumbs instead of chips.  Based on other reviews warning of dryness, I baked at only 350 degrees for 30 minutes, and covered the dish with non-stick aluminum foil for the first 20 minutes.  Fabulous!  The whole family agreed this recipe will go on our "rotation".

Shredded block cheese. Omitted onions and mushrooms as my kids do not like.  Kids loved it. No leftovers.

How silly, it's a tuna casserole and yet it really was the best tasting one I've made in 30 some odd years of adulthood.

I made this tonight. The chips were an added bonus and accented the dish well. The only difference is I used Dorito chips instead of potato chips. Delicious! I never thought to use the chips like I do with King Ranch Chicken. Great idea!!

My husband loved this recipe, but for me it was just okay and could use improvement. I would eliminate the onion and use cheese crackers (like Cheez-Its), rather than potato chips. Also, I didn't have frozen peas, so I used canned and they worked just fine.

I substituted French's Fried Onions for the potato chips and folded 1/2 into the casserole.  My husband raved about it for 2 days.

Very tasty, not dry at all, however I did alter the recipe a bit.  I sautéed the onions with 1 clove of garlic then added the sliced mushrooms.  Added an additional can of mushroom soup, 1/4 cup of sour cream and a can of milk.  Substituted the peas for asparagus.  Baked covered with foil for 30 minutes at 375, then increased temperature to 425 for another 10 minutes.

Mine is a cautionary tale. Don't take all the commenters' suggestions at once! It was great, but made an extra side casserole. In order to avoid being dry, like other commenters said, I added an extra can of soup, 1/4 cream, and a half block of cream cheese. (For my own sake, I used canned sweet baby peas, like my Mom used to.) It was delicious! I just need to find an army to feed.

Great recipe didn't change really anyhing. To combat the dryness don't drain the tuna. Keep the juice as it allows the casserole to have just the right amount of moisture.

I have made this several times and I love it. Tuna casserole isn't something I want everyday but when I get a hankering for it , this is my go to recipe. I've used cheddar cheese potato chips when I had them available before and it adds an extra twist to the flavor.

I loved this recipe as I am generally a lover of pasta and white sauces and cheese.  I wasn't in the mood for peas, so I omitted them, then added a handful of chopped green onions.  I also put mozarella instead of cheddar because I already had it on hand grated. I knew this needed a kick, so I checked other websites and found that these spices make it game changer: 1 tsp dried basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp mustard, 1 Tablespoon worcestershire sauce. I had homemade  pureed broccoli soup on hand, so I added 5 cups of that. I covered them in crushed Bugles (popular in the 80's!) and baked half hour. A lot of changes, but this recipe was the base I needed. Thank you!

My husband and mother-in-law loved it. I am not a huge fan of mushrooms, and the soup I chose happened to be extra-mushroomy. I think I'll try a different soup base next time, no canned mushrooms, and half or all corn

I made it exactly as written but did not add peas, (I like them but my wife does 't). I also used fresh mushrooms rather than canned).
The casserole turned out magnificent. My wife and I both were very happy with the results. Would I recommend any changes to the recipe? No, follow it as written and enjoy your meal.

My picky family enjoyed this and my husband asked for seconds and said "yum, this is really good!"  I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cheese soup, and 1 can cream of celery.   That made it a little too saucy so I could have used 16 oz noodles instead of 12.   I enjoyed the raw flavor of the onion in the dish and with a 1/4 c it wasn't overpowering.  I did end up salting it a little.  Very yummy!!

I switched from tuna to salmon. I added another cup of cheese to the noodle mix (3 cups total) and substituted cream of chicken for cream of mushroom (I didn't have any on hand). I also added not onion to equal 1/2 cup. It turned out really good!

This is an excellent recipe that can be made to your tastes and/or ingredients on hand.  The changes I made:  Swiss and grated parmesan cheeses, asparagus, and crushed Takis (hot pepper and lime flavored), absolutely loved the finished product!

This recipe has a disproportionate amount of noodles. I would suggest 8-10 ounces of noodles. More onion, and maybe about a quarter to a half can of milk (if going for the whole 12 ounces).
Could also use some pepper.
Otherwise, not too bad.

So delicious! I followed the suggestions of others including adding a half a cup of 2% milk, and covered it with aluminum foil for half the bake time. Instead of regular potato chips, I used crushed kettle style chips, and added extra onion, peas and fresh mushrooms. I also used healthy request cream of mushroom soup to reduce the sodium and fat, (but still used regular finely shredded cheddar cheese).

Good Comfort food! I did do a couple of tweaks. I only use one can of cream of mushroom soup instead of two. I did it all on the stove top as I didn’t want to heat the kitchen (AZ summer). I also admitted the potato chips because of the added salt. So so good. A good easy go to dish no matter the time of the year.

I subbed different shaped pasta noodles and since I didn’t have cheddar I used a combo of processed cheese, Monterey Jack and added a quarter cup of nutritional yeast since it tastes like cheese and is really good for you.  SO yummy!  Husband requested this be a repeat dish.  Nuff said.  ??

Wow! I was pleasantly surprised by this dish... First off, I really dislike casseroles in general. And a TUNA casserole? Yuck! But to my surprise, this dish was AMAAAAAZING! 
It was Amazingly easy to make!
It was amazing for the small amount of dishes/pans I had to use.
And it was DELICIOUS! ...Who knew?!
**Quick note** The person who said to sauté the onions and add some extra liquids, is RIGHT!  Thank you for mentioning that and I wish I would’ve remembered the onion part, but I will next time. 
Anyway, I highly recommend this meal!

A simple and delicious recipe.  Keeps well in the fridge.  The chips adds a lovely crunch, however not so good on the leftovers.  So I would only add it to a portion that I can consume the same day as I cook it.  I would add a bit mire soup or some milk with the soup.  It wasn't dry but I think a little bit more sauce is good.

This is our favorite recipe for tuna casserole! We make it at least once a month and there is always leftovers. It's super budget friendly and very easy to make. I occasionally switch out cream of mushroom for cream of chicken, still turns out great. The only thing missing from this recipe is more seasoning, but that's up to preference. We also prefer using jalapeño flavored potato chips as it gives more flavor, I've found that kettle chips work best and stay crisper.

After reading the feedback, I followed the recipe and added evaporated milk, some fresh chives, and a bit of parmesan cheese.  I used a full can of sliced mushrooms.  No potato chips on hand so I used homemade garlic croutons, crushed.  Pretty awesome results!

I make this all the time with some changes. I use 1/2 bag of noodles to keep the casserole from drying out. I omit the peas and mushrooms but sauté celery with the onion. I season with garlic powder, celery salt, pepper, paprika, and lots of dill! I also incorporate the cheese into the casserole. I use crushed jalapeño chips on the top! My fiancé and kids request this almost once a week! I usually serve green beans on the side!

It's yummy!  I did substitute frozen mixed vegetables for the frozen peas and also made it in a 2 quart casserole dish rather than the 9 x 13" pan.  Thumbs up!

This is just like the casserole my mom made when I was little. 

However, I don't use condensed soup. Instead, I make my own cream of mushroom, and it's so easy! Melt a half a stick of butter in a sauce pan and whisk in 1/4 cup of flour.  Whisk for 3-5 min. then add a cup of beef broth (I just use water and bouillon) and a cup of milk.  Throw in a can of mushrooms and whisk until thick and creamy.   It 's exactly the same but with lower sodium! 

Also, I add the cayenne and garlic powder, and I try to use salt and vinegar potato chips.

The main changes I made were: used fresh, sauteed mushrooms instead of canned; doused my noodles in olive oil; and used some extra cheese & chips because why the heck not? It wasn't creamy but wasn't dry either. Personally I don't prefer a real goopy mix, but I could see how some extra cream of mushroom soup might be beneficial. Overall I got great reviews from the family.

The onions were crunchy (I would suggest cooking them before making it) and I really didn't care for that. Overall, it was kind of thick and dry.

This is a good traditional go to meal. Quick and easy. I usually add a little milk if it seems a bit sticky when mixing. Sometimes I omit the extra mushrooms only because my kids are not a huge fan of mushrooms but I love it with the added mushrooms!

I have made the same tuna casserole for a number of years , but wanted to try this one. I was pretty good a little dry. I added some milk and some Frank’s hot sauce. Loved the crunch on top.

I took some other reviewers' suggestions and used 3 cans of soup plus maybe 1/2 can of milk.  Also added a little garlic salt, 2/3 cup jalapeno sour cream - nice kick - and used French fried onion rings instead of potato chips.  My husband is already looking forward to leftovers, says it's the best.

I used 2/3 of a package of egg noodles and upped the evaporated milk to 3/4 cup.  It was still a bit dry, so I added a little more milk. This was fantastic! Hubby said the dish was definitely on the repeat list.

Just a few changes, I used Sorghum & Quinoa pasta, and sauted the onions and shrooms, and added some Cayenne for some kick. The dish turned out great, our finicky oldest child was trying to convince me to get him a pizza before the casserole was even ready to eat.  Before I knew it, he had consumed two bowls of TC.  It was easy and super quick to make!  We'll use that one again.

I don't know how anyone can say this is too dry. Maybe they are leaving it in for more than 20 minutes. I used 3 times as much fresh mushrooms, instead of canned. I added 2 stalks of sliced celery for some crunch. I served sliced green onions to sprinkle on top and it added a nice fresh flavor.  Way too much food for the two of us. Some in the fridge for later in the week and some in the freezer. We will definitely make this again when the leftovers are gone.

I actually thought this was a bit bland. After reading the reviews, I added at least a cup of milk and a couple of tablespoons of sour cream, and it was very moist. Even with extra onion (wish I had sautéed this first; don't love raw onion) and celery for crunch, it lacked something, maybe garlic salt?

Great recipe. I used rotini pasta, 3 cans of tuna drained, 2 cans of peas drained and 8 oz fresh mushrooms sliced thin. Used what I had - 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. I added 8 oz of sour cream and about 1/3 cup of milk. Crushed a sleeve of Ritz crackers and melted 1 stick of butter poured over the top. Cooked in a 9x13 pan. The recipe was delicious and creamy. Will be making this again.

I followed  most of the recipe.  I used a few handfuls of Chinese style fried chow mein noodles instead of egg noodles.  I sprinkled more noodles on top and covered them with the shredded cheese then  baked in a casserole  bowl at 350* for about 25 minutes.  It was yummy and nice and crunchy on top..

I made this tonight and liked it. My kids didn't really love it. We decided it would have been much better with Ritz cracker topping instead of the chips. The chips seemed kind of soggy and stale. Overall it was a good recipe, but I will definitely try it with crackers instead of chips next time!

Cooking for two so I cut all the ingredients in half. I didn’t have any of the canned mushrooms on hand, so I diced 1/3 cup roasted red pepper for a smoky flavor.  Added a touch of milk to help “rinse out” the cream of mushroom soup can.  Topped with crushed dill and sour cream potato chips.  Baked in a deep dish pottery pie plate. Oh my, this was a fantastic comfort dinner dish.

Last night I made this tuna casserole. I did make a few changes per other reviewers.  I sauted the onion with a bit of celery and garlic. I also used crackers instead of the chips as I didn't have chips. I also cooked it in a 21/2 corning casserole dish covered @ 425 and then uncovered @ 350 for about 10 minutes. All that being said, it was delicious! My husband of almost 50 years has liked everything I make with the exception of  the tuna casserole I made the first year of our marriage, and he liked it!

Very good recipe! I was worried about the casserole being dry, as others mentioned, but it turned out fine per the recipe. I made mine with elbow macaroni, as I had some cooked up already. My wife and I felt it tasted even better warmed up the second day!

My family enjoyed this recipe, but be warned it is a little bland, even with the changes I made. The changes were: I doubled the tuna, I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom AND added a can of cheddar cheese soup, I sautéed the onions in a little butter, and I added pepper. I also didn’t have potato chips, so I used panko. In the future, I’ll season it with Seasoned Salt and a little more pepper. Otherwise it was a hit, my family loved it.

Actually turned out pretty good through in some extra seasoning I like it definitely would make again. Accidentally put all two cups of cheese in and then put some more on top. So plentiful.

This is the BEST Tuna Casserole  I've ever had. Ever!
I used rehydrated onion instead of fresh (I was lazy), a 16oz bag of noodles instead of 10oz ( and unobservant), and French Fried Onions instead of potato chips (kids ate all the chips).

This worked out really well, my son loved it. Only downside is I didn't notice it made so much before I started, now we will be eating it for 2 more days! :)

Well, this review is based on some changes I made.  I used cream of chicken, and I don't like peas or mushrooms so I didn't use it.  It turned out ok.    My boyfriend who has been adamant about not liking and refusing to eat tuna casserole, actually tried this and liked it.  So I guess this will be a keeper.

4 stars because I made the following changes
1- cooked the noodles with garlic powder, salt and small pieces of two celery stalkers until soft
2-mixed the noodles with 1 can mushroom soup and one can of celery soup
3-sautéed 1medium diced onion and the peas in butter
4- mixed everything, and the tuna, heated, put in the oven 350f for 20 minutes with the remaining cheese on top. 
It was delicious. the best I ever had.

My friend made this, and it was the best tuna casserole I've ever had.
Her substitutions: used corn tortilla chips instead of potato chips for topping, and left out the frozen peas.
The cheese on top was sharp cheddar and that made it, use a good quality cheese.

So, I made this casserole twice. The first time I followed the recipe as posted. The results were underwhelming. 3 stars at best. Like other reviewers mentioned, it was very dry with only 2 cans of soup. Also, the onions and peas were still raw after only baking for 20 minutes. Plus, it was just blah. I made it again last night but made some changes. Here's what I added to the ingredient list: 

3 carrots, sliced
2 stalks of celery, sliced
2 tablespoons of minced fresh rosemary

I also used 3 cans of cream of  broccoli cheese soup.

Here's what I did:

As my pasta was boiling I added all my vegetables (including those peas) I let them cook for the last few minutes while the pasta cooked. I drained everything then added it back to the same pot. Then I added my 3 cans of soup & Rosemary. I skipped the chips and just added cheese to the top. Baked at the temp and for the time recommended and it was great!!

I used fried onions instead of chips on top, but I think I would try the chips next time.  Also, the soup I used was not condensed, but it still came out good.  I will definitely try this again with better ingredients on my part.

Made it tonight and it was just okay. Have had better. Seemed very dry and just seemed lacking "a punch", for want of a better word.  Followed directions with no changes.  Will not be making again.

The only change I made was using large egg shell noodles and adding a TBSP of sour cream to the mixture (mostly cause I wanted to use the rest of what I had so I could throw it out). Make sure the peas are ready so you can pour the hot noodles over the top. I also sauteed the onion for about 5 minutes then sauteed the mushroom for a few minutes. One mistake I made was topping with cheese then finishing with potato chips, should've been the other way around. The chips get a little burnt that way. The recipe turned out good though and is something I would make again.

Loved this dish!! This was my first time making a tuna casserole and I am so glad I found this recipe! I used 3 cans of tuna instead of 2, only one can of progresso creamy mushroom (18 oz), added 1/4 cup mayo, and went heavy on the cheese and chips. I also used gluten free chickpea noodles instead of egg noodles. Delicious!

Best tuna casserole I've had so far. Instead of the chips, I used bread crumbs instead, but 1 cup was WAY too much, just put enough to lightly cover the top. Definitely going to make this one again

First time making a casserole, enjoyed this recipe. Reading through the notes I took the advice of a few notes and changed the following. Used 2.5 cans of mushroom soup, a whole medium onion sautéed first, 2 cups of sharp cheese mixed in and another cup sprinkled on top. Panko crumbs instead of chips, whole can of mushrooms and 3 cans of tuna. I added salt, pepper and Paprika to taste and additional sprinkle of Paprika on top. Turned out to make a hardy, tasty and creamy dish.

I didn't have all the ingredients the recipe calls for when I made this, but luckily, this is an easy recipe to experiment with. I used rotini instead of egg noodles (I prefer rotini for casseroles), sour cream and onion chips instead of plain chips, 1 can of cream of chicken soup instesd of 2 cans cream of mushroom, and 1 cup of frozen, diced green pepper instead of frozen peas. The result was as delicious as you would expect from a tuna casserole! I think adding peas in addition to the green pepper would be perfect. To make up for the can of soup I didn't have, I added two heaping tablespoons of French onion dip. The result was creamy but not too creamy. Making it again, I'd probably use part cream of chicken and part cream of mushroom. When topping with cheese and crushed chips, make sure to put the cheese on top of the chips or the chips will get too brown during baking. I also added about 1.5 tsps of black pepper. You definitely don't need extra salt in this recipe with the chips and soups that go into it. Overall, a very quick, easy but delicious recipe!

Alot of reviews said it was dry.  So, instead of 425'c I set the oven at 350 for 30 min instead and it was not dry.  I also added a little cumin and garlic powder so it wasn't plain and covered it with tin foil.

Absolutely delicious. I do recommend adding a about 1/2-1 cup of milk to prevent dryness. I upped the amount of tuna and peas and substituted 1/2 of the cheddar for Monterey jack and it turned out fine.

I sauteed the onions first. Next time I will add a little less. I used two cans of cream of mushroom after reading other reviews. Also I reduced the temperature to 400 and used a round 3 qt dish.

Perfect base for trying different things. You can use this as a complete meal or play with the ingredients yourself. You could maybe add more soup for creamer casserole. You could add other things or even change the amount of the ingredients in this recipe. I think you could use this recipe to get creative and know it will still be good. In my electric oven I used the temp recommended for 20 minutes and it came out perfect and the crust on top was crispy and cheesy. Yum!

This is my first time ever to make tuna casserole. My husband has been requested for a long time. I searched and decided to try this recipe. My hubby loves it! He said it tasted like how he used to remember so it's a "plus" for me since I've never had it before. I didn't know what it's supposed to be so it's good to have such a good compliment! Thank you for posting this recipe. Btw, I replaced can mushroom with some sauté fresh mushroom! Love this crunchy top and I definitely keep this recipe!

Love tuna casserole! Only changes I make is I boil the rotini noodles in chicken broth. Gives it so much flavor. I'm not a big fan of peas so I use green beans. I'm so excited for dinner tonight!

I messed up the recipe by adding all of the shredded cheese into the casserole.  I had extra that I put on the top before baking and it turned out great.  I also used frozen broccoli instead of peas.  We ate the whole thing between two of us.  Of course that was over a number of days.

Used 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of mushroom, used a whole sweet onion chopped and cooked until soft with a can of mushrooms and some minced garlic.  Added more cheese (mixed in cheddar and a handfull of parm), covered top with French onions and some crushed kettles chips and more cheddar cheese.  Also used 3 cans white albacore tuna.  Added frozen peas and equal amount of frozen white shoe peg corn.   Also added maybe half a cup of sour cream.  Baked at 350 for maybe 25 minutes with foil cover, then turned up to 425 for last 10-15 with cover off.  Best ever.....

This was really good excluding the potato chips. My family did not like them on top. But they are very picky.  Will make again.

I have made this 2 times in the past year and my family loves it. My only changes were to replace the canned mushrooms with fresh sliced baby portobello mushrooms, double the amount of diced onions  and to put the remaining cup of cheese on top first, then the crushed chips (opposite of the video) because I want the chips to stay crunchy. ??

This is a good base recipe.  Since I was making it just for my husband and myself, I cut the recipe in half.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, so I substituted cream of celery soup and used a red onion which added some nice color to the dish.  I was concerned that it would be too dry, so I added about 1/2 cup of milk .  I also used french fried onions for the topping instead of potato chips.  I baked the casserole with a cover on it for all but the last 5 minutes.  It turned out  beautifully - a nicely browned and crunchy top with a creamy texture underneath.  It was very tasty!  Will definitely be making this again.

Our whole family loved this recipe. Here are the changes I made. I didn't use sliced mushrooms and I didn't used chips for the topping. I used Italian bread crumbs and I cooked the onion a little just to soften them. I highly recommend this recipe for a tasty dinner that is easy to prepare!

Really good with some changes I grilled the onions and 1/4 c red bell pepper , 1 stalk of celery  and 1 c diced zucchini in butter and added 1 more can of soup and 1/4 c milk and 4 oz can of dices green chiles.  I then put in oven at 375 for 40 min.  I put Frenches Jalapeño topping instead of the onion.  I omitted the peas and used spicy cheddar, can u tell we like spice.  Not too spicy for us  ...

I make tuna casserole like this all the time.  My mother taught me how to make it. Instead of using frozen peas, I use can peas and use the juice along with 1 can of milk when mixing all the wet ingredients. I top the casserole with either finely crushed saltines or townhouse type of butter crackers.

As is this recipe was just basic & on the dry side. I will saute up some mushrooms, sweet onions & orange bell peppers next time. I did not like the chips on top & will use French fried onions instead. As for the dryness I will probably add olive oil mayonnaise & milk if needed. I'm dissapointed that I used my sister-in-law's canned fresh caught tuna on this & am wishing I would have used it for a better recipe.
I am so frustrated with people who rate recipes 5 stars when they make all these changes. Please rate the recipe as is & then say how you improved it to your liking. It makes it hard to find a great recipe by its rating. I wish there were some rules on here.

Not too impressed with this recipe. I took the suggestion of adding one cup of sour cream. It made the dish creamy, but did nothing for the flavor. I also covered the dish to prevent drying out.  This is a bland dish, and I don't know what could be done to improve it. Maybe more onion, some salt and pepper or garlic might help. Also, it makes a lot. There's only two of us, and we have tons of leftovers.

My family liked this recipe,  especially the crunchy potato chip topping...I followed it totally as written. I liked it, too, but only gave it 4 stars as I thought it was a bit weak on flavor punch! Next time I will add additional seasoning such as a bit of garlic and black pepper...possibly lemon pepper and use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I also think a bit of diced celery and red bell pepper or roasted red pepper would up the flavor profile! I will make it again!

This was excellent! I substituted the cream of mushroom soup for cream of potato soup and left out the mushrooms because my man hates mushrooms and I used vegetable penne instead of the egg noodles. It was delicious!

Good recipe although I cut the cheese in half.  I would agree with other reviewers to add another can of soup and saute the onions first because the raw taste was a bit too much for my kid.

Great basic recipe. Just fiddled with it a bit. Needs moisture. Added some of the pasta water and milk.  Used smoked cheddar cheese, Lemon pepper  and red pepper flakes. Sautéed onions, mushrooms, garlic, RP flakes with butter and better than bouillon (chicken). Added white wine to deglaze. Yummy

good as is, but i tried it later with canned salmon instead of tuna, a can each of cream of celery soup and cheddar soups, lima beans instead of peas, and i mixed half mozarella half cheddar, left out the mushroom slices, and it was, imo, better.

I made this with 3 cans of soup like some people recommended, also in a round 2qt dish. What reviews I read didn't mention is that using a round dish means it'll need to cook a bit longer. Also only need about half the chips and cheese for topping. The casserole will barely fit in the dish too. But turns out great even so! I might add more tuna next time too.

This is really good and easy! I made a few changes:
1) I added a few sliced carrots
2) Instead of 1/2 can of sliced mushrooms, I used fresh ones
I added these with the frozen mushrooms in the pot with the noodles while the noodles cooked. 
3) Instead of chopped onion, I used onion powder (more because I forgot to cut one and add it!)

Next time, I also believe I will add a little more cheese and maybe use a different time of cheese. Sharp cheddar was good, but another type might be good as well! The melty, crusty cheese on top with the crunchiness of the chips is great!!

My husband doesn't like cheese and green peas, so I substituted green beans. It really does need the cheese to have the great flavor.

I started with the basic recipe, but made some changes. I sautéed the onion with garlic and fresh button mushrooms. To that I added 1 can of regular cream of mushroom soup, and one can of cream of cremini mushroom soup, dill weed, salt and pepper, garlic powder, some milk to thin it out and a touch of siracha for a little kick. Once cooked through, I added it to the egg noodles, peas, tuna, and cheese in the Casserole dish. For the finishing touch and for a bit more dill flavour, I crushed up dill pickle potato chips for the top. It came out flavourful and creamy. Will definitely make this again.

Good recipe, but made even more simple with raw pasta.  I added 2 soup-cans worth of water to the listed ingredients and just put the egg noodles in dry.  Fold gently to incorporate without breaking noodles.  I used a deeper casserole dish (vs. 9x13 pan), so about halfway through the baking time, I stirred again to ensure the "top" noodles got turned down into the liquid.  Added the crunchy topping stuff after stirring.  Noodles all thoroughly cooked with a perfect consistency at the end.

I will probably add in a bit of salt and less onion next time. Also I feel like I should have cooked it about 10 minutes longer.

I love this recipe, comfort food but not overly rich (it is a casserole however). I add extra peas, almost twice the recommended amount and this time I used wild garlic egg noodles - delicious!

The only things I did differently was use celery instead of mushrooms and cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. I also sautéed the onion and celery  in 2-3 tbsp of butter for a few mins until they softened up and I added the tuna juices instead of draining. Then I baked at 350° for 25-30 min. It was the best tuna casserole I've ever had and can't wait to make it again.

This really is the best tuna casserole.  I cut the recipe in half for me and my husband and will have leftovers for lunch.  I used dried minced onion instead of fresh, and mushroom soup with roasted garlic.  I think my noodles really added to it (Essenhaas  Amish noodles.)  They are so good.  I also mixed all of the cheese (1 cup for 1/2 recipe) into the casserole and instead of potato chips I use French fried onions.  Putting this recipe in my GO-TO file.   Husband loved this too.  Would also be good with canned salmon.

I read all the reviews too.  Substituted one mushroom soup for a celery soup.  Sauteed fresh mushrooms with garlic and a little cream cheese and reduced the noodles by half.  Awesome!

I used real ahi tuna steaks instead of canned tuna.  We precooked the tuna steak and then cut it up into small pieces.  I followed another person's advice and added about 1/3 cup of cream cheese to the sauce.  Also I increased the onion to a full onion, chopped it and then cooked it until tender.  I also substituted a bag of baby spinach (which I cooked in with the onions once they were tender) instead of using peas.  No one likes peas in our family.  This was big hit and we will make it again.

I fried onions garlic celery in a little butter then added cayenne & steak spice then mixed in soup & grated cheese then added noodles sprinkled with potatoe chips then drizzled melted butter on top & sprinkled a bit more cheese then baked at 375 for about 15-20 mins. And perfecto!!

I made half a recipe without the mushrooms and with solid albacore. It was great and I've never liked tuna casserole.  I used buttered panko instead of chips. Next time I'll make it just like this:)

Modifications I made: 
3 cans of tuna 
2 cans of mushroom soup + 1 can of celery soup
1/3 cup of milk 
Extra peas (not sure how much extra) 
Extra cheese on top and inside as well (brick AND cheddar) Probably about 2 extra cups total 
FOR THE TOPPING:
Ritz crackers (instead of chips) 
I added 2 tbsp of melted butter, garlic powder, basil and thyme. 

Overall great base recipe

This is a good base recipe. I subbed No Yolk noodles (which don't need to be pre-cooked) and frozen french green beans for the peas, and also fresh sliced mushrooms for the canned. I also threw in a can of condensed cheese soup along with the cream of mushroom and about a cup of water as well since the noodles were cooking in the casserole. Turned out really good!

I didn't add the potato chips nor the peas and it was fantastic!!! I have to say that I "did" have a little help with some cheddar powder that I found that is usually used for popcorn and I was surprised at how much cheesier it tasted! For those of you who want to make a quick and healthy meal, you have GOT to try this one! Goes well with Caesar salad.

This recipe is bland, boring, and designed for children.  Improved the potato chip idea with a recipe designed for adults. See following. 

Ingredients:
- 1lb bacon, fried crisp, with 1tbsp grease reserved.
- 2 (6oz) cans of yellowfin tuna, drained with juice reserved
- 2 (6oz) cans of albacore tuna, drained with juice reserved
- 1 large shallot chopped
- 1/2 medium sweet onion chopped
- 1pt heavy cream
- 2 cans (11oz) condensed cream of mushroom soup
- 3.5 cups frozen peas
- 1 cup + 1 cup cheddar cheese shredded 
- 1 cup Comte cheese shredded
- 2lbs orchiette pasta cooked al dente
- soy sauce, fish sauce, black pepper, old bay to taste
- 4oz potato chips, crushed to crumbs
- 3tbsp butter

Directions:
Fry onion and shallot in reserved bacon fat until tender and translucent. Add tuna, soy, fish sauce, and seasonings fry until well blended.

Chop already cooked and drained bacon, add to onion and shallot mix, and mix well. Let fry 2-3 minutes and add 1-2tbsp butter.

Mix soup, heavy cream, and tuna juice until well blended. Add soup mix to tuna/bacon/onion mix stirring well until blended. Let reduce over low heat, for 8-10mins. 

Pour tuna mix over cooked and drained orchiette. Stir well. Add 1 cup of cheddar and 1 cup of Comte and mix well until cheese is well distributed and melted thoroughly. Stir in peas. 

Butter the bottom and sides of a large, shallow baking dish. Pour pasta and tuna combination into baking dish. Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, then 2oz potato chip crum

I made this the night before my company came. I added the cheese and heated it up. The ladies loved it. It was so simple to make and tasted great. I will definitely make it again.

This turned out great.  Not dry. I usually made a recipe as written first before making a bunch of tweaks but after reading the reviews about it being dry, I used some suggestions and I'm glad I did.  I made it in a 2-qt round casserole - that was a really good idea. And I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery - another good idea.  I also had a different recipe that claimed to be the best tuna noodle casserole and in that recipe it said to add 1/2 can of evaporated milk and 1/4 cup of mayo.  So I added that because I figured it could only help with the dryness.  I will be reheating this at work today in a crockpot and I really hope it reheats well especially after adding those extras.  UPDATE: Yep, it reheated just fine.  I poured in a little milk just to be on the safe side and kept it on low to heat through.  Everyone loved it.  No leftovers! :)

Main change was to make it a chicken and noodle casserole, as I am allergic to ALL seafood(: and miss it!  I could only wish the chicken did indeed taste like tuna:) I pretty much followed the recipe but always add milk to the mix to keep it moist, and I added some mixed frozen veg instead of just peas. AND I do agree that a round casserole dish works better with this. Didn't use quite all the 12oz.'s of noodles either.  Still LOVE the chrunky potato chip topping! Thanks for an OLD time recipe!

This is the 3rd time within 5 mins I am trying to write a review for this dish. On my iPad keyboard the return key is marked DONE for some reason.     .For the ingredients I made the following changes:                                                                                                                                4 cups of shredded sharp cheddar.    3 cups of crushed potato chips.    No peas nor mushrooms.  I used 3 cups of broccoli flowerets which I cooked in boiling water for 2 mins prior to cooking noodles. Be sure to put cooked broccoli in cold water to stop cooking. Also sautéed 3 cloves of crushed garlic in 1 TB of butter.   I also added 1 cup of low fat sour cream to the soup mixture.  Don't cook the noodles until you have mixed the soup etc.    Soup, sour cream, broccoli, 2 cups of shredded cheddar, garlic. - tasted it and added salt & pepper.  Added tuna drained. Mixed it up very gently and then added cooked noodles.  Added crushed potato chips on top and then added grated cheddar.   This was superb!  I made this dish twice previously and thought it was very bland so made some changes.  Actually my recipe  was more like a fancy mac & cheese with tuna added.   Anyway hubby liked it any way I made it but I liked this "kicked up a notch" recipe.

My mom used to make this for my siblings and me when we were kids and my dad was working late.  The recipe is exactly like she used to make. I wanted to try something different within the recipe. . Instead of using canned tuna I used canned salmon. I also used two cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup and one can of condensed chicken gumbo.

This was good but it just tasted like every other tuna noodle casserole ive eaten. Nothing exceptional about this one. I added 4 cans of mushroom soup to avoid the dryness everyone is speaking of and turned out to be the perfect consistency.

My nephew said he loved it! With only one can of Cream of Mushroom on hand, I used Cheddar Cheese soup for the second one. I added a secret ingredient, too - 1 c. Grape-Nuts cereal, for fiber and flavor. It's a winner.

Very tasty! I used buttered panko crumbs (no chips on hand), fresh mushrooms instead of canned and a little half and half for moisture. Seasonings: salt,  pepper, cayenne, red chili flakes & garlic powder.

This ended up being a lot better than I expected, considering the ill-equipped kitchen I made it in. I used one can of nacho cheese soup and one of cream of mushroom, then topped it with crushed white cheddar Cheezits instead of potato chips. Also, not sure how much this helped, but after reading the reviews about it being dry, I did not drain the tuna before adding it and stirred in a little water as well. Didn't dry out while baking. My husband, our friend, and I pretty well destroyed that casserole for dinner. It was pretty quick and easy to throw together (or would have been if I had been in my own kitchen), so that combined with it tasting pretty darn good too really makes it a 5-star in my book. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I saw other reviews about it being dry and decided to mesh this recipe with another.  I used 8 oz elbow macaroni, only one can of soup, about 2-3 oz cream cheese and 1 cup of condensed milk which I whisked into melted butter/flour. I added the grated cheddar to the hot milk.  I added broiled cauliflower and steamed broccoli to make it healthier.  I couldn't believe how much I liked this!  I always thought tuna casserole was a disgusting thing thrown together by people who didn't know how to cook.  Guess I really went way off recipe here, though.

I made this last night and there wasn't even a spoonful leftover! 
I added 3/4 cup of milk. I also substituted a package of Birds Eye steamed veggies (broccoli, carrots and water chestnuts) instead of the peas, and threw in some hot sauce to give it some zing. YUMMY!

I made this and it turned out great. As others have suggested it is on the dry side. I added a half cup of milk and heavy cream. No potato chips on hand so I went with tortilla. It ended up great!

I thought it was perfect. It was very delicious I did not have cream of mushroom soup so I use cream of broccoli soup and that was just fine and I had a little sour cream because I love sour cream in my and instead of the chips on top I just did my usual melted butter mixed with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese a little bit and cover the top with that anyway all in all it was a superb recipe

I used cream of celery and cream of mushroom.  I used medium egg noodles to see if it would absorb less of the liquid.  I thought it turned out great. I did add about 1/3 cup of milk to it, to keep it from drying out while cooking.  My 21-month-old son loved it. Will be making it again and again. Love the chips on top instead of the crackers!

I must say that I did alter the recipe, as my fiancée is allergic to mushrooms.  
I used cream of celery soup (3) cans. I also used pepperjack cheese in the mixture in place of the cheddar cheese. I used Lipton Onion Soup Mix (11/2 packets) instead of chopped onions.  I also used 4 cans of tuna instead of 2. I must say that it turned out wonderfully delicious! !!

Rather bland and quite dry. Needs a lot of help. If I make anything close to it again I'll probable fold in a lot more cheese and add some condensed milk. Maybe even use macaroni instead of egg noodles.

Made lots of changes, took all suggestions that people made & next time will some of my own to make sure it's not dry.  Most helpful was cooking on lower oven temp. May take but worth it.

added corn since i didn't have mushrooms, used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, i used a couple handfuls of noodles instead of a whole bag, that seemed like overkill. it was good, next time i will add the crushed potato chips after it comes out of the oven. they got very soggy and its just a personal preference. i will make this again

I've made this recipe many times. At first, I followed the recipe exactly (minus the peas and onion, my bf doesn't like them). It was good (probably would have been better with onion, imo!). 

However,  I've changed things around my family's preference. I added corn instead of peas. I used 3 cans of soup (cream of celery, mushroom and chicken). I added spices (garlic, onion and seasoning salt) and used more tuna. I do 16 oz of noodles with 4 cans of tuna and it comes out moist, creamy and  tunalious. Also, I've tried all kinds of shredded cheeses in this and I think that sharp cheese works best -- adds the most flavor. 

Before I tried this recipe, I had never had tuna casserole, now I have it every other week so thanks for sharing this recipe with me!

I have made this recipe several times. It has always been good. This time I added the diced onions to the hot pasta water just as the noodles were about done, and drained them together. 
And I tried a Ritz Crackers & melted butter topping. 
I baked a small amount in an oven-proof bowl for an aunt who needed comfort food.

As others have noted, the onion is a little overpowering. I used panko bread crumbs instead of potato chips but, other than that pretty much stuck to the published recipe. Next time, I will saute the onion before adding it to  the noodles and remaining ingredients. Other than that, a very enjoyable dish.

I added about a cup of cream.   I did not mix cheese in.  I just added it to the top.  I crumbled ritz crackers with a tiny bit of butter and put it on top of the casserole and covered with cheese.  Cover the casserole loosely when cooking.  I added salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I also used fresh mushrooms and cooked the mushrooms and onions before I put them into the mixture.  All in all was very good.

I omitted the mushrooms.

I made this a few days ago and have been eating left overs for the last couple of days since. It is not bad but not great, I got food poisoning from it last night so it's safe to say I won't be eating the rest.

This was quick, but next time I will leave out the peas. They overpower it. Maybe cut them in half or exclude altogether.

Perhaps it was the kind of tuna I used, but it wasn't very tuna-y or flavorful. I used nearly a whole can extra of tuna even! I added red bell pepper, more onion, and a bit of sour cream as people said it was dry. I used crushed jalapeno chips on top which provided a majority of the flavor. Would use a different recipe next time!

The dish was ok until you get bites of raw onion. I followed the recipe with the exception of whisking  half a can of milk into the mushroom soup since some reviewers said it was dry. The potato chip crust was a little bland, it would've been better had I used sour cream and onion chips or another flavored chip. The chips didn't reheat too well which I assumed would be the case.

I made it as is, but would make the following adjustments: sauté the onion with a little garlic and olive oil. The raw onion was still crunchy and a bit overpowering. I would add 1/4 cup of milk as it was a little dry. I would cover it with foil and put it under the broiler on the last minute of cooking. Make sure you salt the water before dumping the noodles in or it will be bland.

Tasted great.  Took advice of other cooks and added I/2 cup of half and half. Before I added the noodles I added salt, garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper.  Used crushed crackers with garlic butter at the end. Delicious! Was not dry at all - cooked it at 400.

This recipe is a longtime family favourite. I didn't imagine I would find the recipe anywhere. Now what I did was I "adulated it."  I switched up the peas for chopped celery. I did everything else but added cayenne pepper and thyme. For the topping I used multigrain bagel crumbs with lots of fresh ground black pepper in it. Mmmmmmm!

My family loved this! I did follow the advice of other reviewers and added an extra half can of soup and a half can of milk. I also added sour cream. Even with all that I still felt it could use more liquid. I like casseroles to be very "saucy", but that's just my personal preference. Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe as written, except I used fresh mushrooms and I sauteed the onions and mushrooms for a few minutes before adding them to the casserole. I also used ritz crackers for the topping instead of chips.  It really was delicious! I think next time I'll either use less egg noodles or add additional liquid.

I made this and my husband and kids loved it!  Course I always substitute!  I swapped canned mushrooms for a cup of fresh mushrooms I sautéed in olive oil.  Then swapped peas ( no one in the family likes peas) for 3 cups of fresh spinach I threw in with the pasta the last three minutes it was boiling along with one cup of fresh shredded carrots.   Everything else the same, it was SO good!

I've made this for years with a few differences. Add 1/2 can milk per can of cream soup used. I also add little sour cream or mayo. Don't like peas? Use broccoli or frozen mixed vegetables. Mix some of the cheese in the casserole. Instead of crushed chips I like to top mine with stuffing mix right from the box (unprepared). This is good old fashioned comfort food.

I didn't make this version, but who would waste 2 cups of cheddar cheese on something that's marginally good at best?
 Just replace the cheddar and egg noodles with a box of macaroni n cheese and leave the rest of the recipe alone. It's quick, easy and good,  the way it's supposed to be.

Great comfort food! I added Old Bay seasoning, which really added to the taste. Also, used panko instead of potato chips.  Finally, adding 1/4 cup of milk gave it a little more moisture. An instant favorite for hubby and me.

A great dish when you're running low on time. I added some freshly squeezed lemon juice and milk, a touch of chipotle powder, and a little dill weed to the mix. I used wild albacore tuna  to increase the "meatiness" of the dish. We love it. I halved the recipe because there are only two of us.

I made this, with just a few substitutions, and it turned out wonderful. I eliminated the potato chips all together, and sauteed the onions with 8 oz fresh mushrooms, instead of using raw & canned. The flavor was fantastic, and I will be making it again.

Our family thought this was great! However, can't say I completely stuck to the recipe here. Word of advice, saute onions some first or they will be crunchy.  I had used a little under 1/4 cup of white onions, so it was fine & not too strong of flavor. Didn't have 2 cans of mush soup so used a cup of sour cream instead of another can.  Also, used 1/4 c up half & half, and 1/4 cup of almond milk poured over the ingredients once they were in the dish to keep it from being too dry.  I also used broccoli (steamed 10 minuted first, then diced up) since I didn't have peas.  Another change with cheese was to use about 1/4 c up English cheddar since I had some, and the kind of cheddar we used was sharp.  Added a little bit of parmesan (powder kind) to the bread crumbs (didn't have potato chips), & about 1 tablespoon & a half of melted butter to mixed the bread crumbs so they got a nice crunch & golden brown color to them.  Also sprinkled some pepper and cayenne to the mix before putting it in the oven.

I really like the simplicity of the recipe but I added a can of corn and green beans instead of peas. I also added a little over a 1/4 cup of milk and left out a cup of cooked pasta. There is enough sodium in the vegetables that it doesn't need anymore but if you add some pepper it really pulls the flavors together!!

Tried a slow cooker tuna noodle last month and it was so mushy and gross I had to redeem myself, so I tried this one. It was exactly what I was looking for! I added garlic powder, and a dash of turmeric (for health). I also added 1/2 a soup can of milk and used red onion. I ate mine on a bed of spinach (yum!!) and both of my eaters loved it. My non-eater (~3 years) tried more than one bite which was victory in my book!

Will def make this again. Husband and toddler gobbled it down. Will probably sauté the onions first though and I found they didn't soften and were too strong a flavour.

Fantastic but I did add a little milk and more onion. I left out the mushrooms but used a can of mushroom and a can of condensed Asparagus soup. Instead of the chips I melted butter in a pan tossed in Panko bread crumbs and browned them.  I also used Yellow fin solid white Tuna. 

I made this for my wife, I hate Tuna casserole but it was really good so I will make this again!

I  altered the heck out of this one to suit my fam. I used canned chicken instead of tuna to ensure my little ones would eat it well. I forgot the mushrooms  in the fridge and I added cream of chicken and mushroom soup. Its a nice "base" casserole recipe that is easy to alter. I'll use again.

I use this not just for tuna, but leftover chicken  and we use a variety of chips on top: potato, Sun Chips, tortilla chips, etc.  I also use whatever noodles I have left over, so my casserole could have macaroni, rigatoni, and once, some tortellini. 

Very easy and very yummy.

When I made this recipe the first time I added an extra can of soup and some sour cream.  It was very bland and, even with the extras, came out somewhat dry and the noodles had a sticky texture. Also the onions were nearly raw.  There was almost no cheese flavor as it seems to have been absorbed by the noodles

I tried a second time adding even more milk and sour cream and  l sautéed extra onions and crushed garlic.   Also added some dill, more sharp cheddar cheese., and an extra can of tuna.  That being said, it came out good but not something I'd make again.

4 stars with the following changes:  added 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of milk. I also added Ortega chilies and used Doritos because that's what I had on hand. Next time I would sauté the onions first.

I cooked this in a deep casserole dish. Followed concerns by others for dryness and added a cup of light sour cream, more mushrooms, mixed vegetables.  I only added cheese to the noodles and not on top. This tastes best the next day to me.

The onion was overpowering. I couldn't taste the tuna or the cheese. I'm making this again tonight and I will be adding sautéed onion as well as some diced celery, a sharper cheddar, the water from the tuna and about 1/2 a cup of milk.

I loved this. I had never made a tuna casserole or even tasted one but this was a guilty indulgence. I added more cheese in the mix, more onions, used canned peas instead. Turned out great!

Turned out okay glad I sauteed the onions first so they weren't too strong. Next time I'm going to add another cup of peas, 1 can less soup, and more cheese. It was creamer than I liked but in general not a bad recipe easy make after work.

I've never made a tuna casserole before.  Made tonight, and with the help of some reviews, I decided to make some adjustments.  I added 1/2 can of milk to the mixture and instead of canned mushrooms, I used 2 Roma/Italian  Tomatoes (diced) to add more colour.
I didn't measure out the amount of cheese or chips for the top. Also, I went with rippled chips to enhance the crunch. Baked in a casserole dish, for 15 minutes. Next time I will leave it in for a couple more minutes.
Okay, getting to the point, my eleven year old son and I loved it and now this will become a Mom favourite for him!!  Thank you :)

Great basic recipe.  I used it as a guide to create a lower fat-carb-calorie version by substituting spaghetti squash for noodles and fat free cottage cheese for the inside cheese.  Also,  I used low-fat American cheese and crushed fat-free croutons on top.  It was delish and my boyfriend agreed!  Next time I will load up on more veggies!

This was excellent! The only  changes I made were that I used Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic and also added about a teaspoon of garlic powder. I didn't put the cheese on top at all, just mixed it in. I also cut the recipe in half and I still have enough for leftovers several times. I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this for dinner last night and looking forward to left overs.  I made some changes so therefore didn't give it five stars.  The sour cream other reviewers suggested was the best!  Made it nice and creamy.  I used potato chip topping with cheese over them and they were so crispy and tasty!  Also used the round casserole dish.  Added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream and the consistency was really good.  Hubby loved it!  Sauted the onions in butter before I added them to the mix.  Really was good and I'm going to keep this recipe with my changes noted.

I found it to be not too bad. Before popping it into the oven, you'll know just how much more liquid you need to add. Keep in mind that all noodles are a bit different, and each absorb differently -- especially if you're using whole wheat, or gluten free 

The overall blend of ingredients does deliver a good comfort food.

At one time I did not have any potatoe chips, instead I used tater tots instead.  I simply cooked the tater tots as directed on the bag first, then I removed the tater tots from the oven, let them cool at room temperature.  Then I added to the tuna noodle cassarole,  and baked the tuna noodle cassarole accordingly.   They came out crunchy, and delcious.

I added some of the pasta water to add some moisture and used a mixture of cheddar jack cheese.  This was absolutely the tastiest thing I have had in a long time.  Will make it many more times.  Thank you to whomever came up with this recipe.

Not bad. Definitely needs more base than what is listed. I took the advice of another review and added some milk, but it wasn't enough. Next time I will be adding an additional can of soup. I also felt that the onions needed to be sauteed first, and I added onion and garlic powder and salt.

I've made this a bunch of times and we love it. Because we love fish we prefer using 2 cans of 15 ounce mackerel just to make sure we have enough (our dog loves mooching the mackerel too) instead of 2 cans of 6 ounce tuna.  I also double the peas because we like them and use a bit more cheese, and use No Yolk noodles.  But really you don't need to change the recipe at all because it is so good just as it is posted.

Made this tonight for my husband. I reduced serving size from 6 to 3 as I only had 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. I didn't have any chips for topping so I didn't bother with that, and I mixed the cheese in the mixture instead of just on top and added sour cream. I mixed everything together and put in the oven for 25 minutes at 350.

Very flavourful, I will definitely make this again! however I made a few changes, some based on other reviews. I added the half cup of milk and it was not dry at all! I used corn instead of peas because that's what I had here. I also used normal spaghetti noodles because once again thats all we had. Next time I will sauté the onions first so they aren't so strong in the casserole. I also left some chip crumbs off to the side to add as you wish when you are eating which was delicious! Overall a great recipe ! Yummy!

It made a quick and filling lunch. I used gluten free spiral noodles, added green onion, the bigger can of Mushroom Soup and omitted the mushrooms which I don't care for. Next time I make it, I will add a dash of black pepper and  a little bit of milk.

Not good. The onions don't cook all the way through, so they overpower the dish. Edible, but disappointing. I can't imagine kids eating this.

Everyone loved this recipe. I sautéed my onions with celery. Left out the peas. Added a bit of pepper. The salt was enough from the soup & ripple chips.

Followed the recipe however I did make the following changes: added an extra can of mushroom soup, sautéed the onions (1 small) and mushrooms (a whole can) in butter till cooked first, added a half a cup of sour cream, used macaroni noodles and seasoned with salt and pepper. Cooked at 350 for 25 min. I followed everything else in the recipe and it came out great. Thank you, for the time I enjoyed tuna casserole:)

Finally a really tasty but easy to make tuna casserole!  I made this while sick, doing  it four-handed with my husband ( not an experienced cook), left out the onion, used the aluminum foil tip, and it was great.

I thought it was a good base, but kind of bland.  What I did:

1)  Once the noodles are drained, put in large bowl and add about 1Tb salted butter and mix them up before adding the rest...
2)  Use one each of the following 10.5oz condensed soups: Cream of Mushroom, Cream of Celery, and Broccoli Cheddar
3)  I omit mushrooms (personal taste) and use 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas
4)  Add 1/3 of a can of milk to each soup can to coax out the stuff that sticks behind and pour into bowl (so add 1 cup of milk)
5)  Add 1 cup FINELY shredded cheddar
6)  Add 3 PACKETS (the stuff not in a can - 5oz each) of tuna in water and mix well in bowl.  Pour into large casserole dish (mine is 13"x9")
7)  Use a about 1/2 can of reduced fat Pringles (regular flavor) and finely crumble all over the top
8)  Top with the leftover cup of cheese and bake for about 30 minutes until the cheese is melted.  I let it sit in the warm (but off) oven until it's time to serve.  My family loves this dish!

I made this for my boyfriend and I.. I am a very picky eater and my boyfriend will eat almost anything.. But I did make a few changes, neither of us like mushrooms so I used cream of chicken instead, I left out the peas, and I diced my 1/4 onion.. All and all we both really loved the way it turned out and think it might be pretty good with some broccoli in it too (maybe next time).. I will make this again..

I made this casserole and my boyfriend absolutely loved it. I added about 1/3 cup of milk to each of the empty soup cans to "swirl" out the cans, it adds a bit of extra needed moisture to the dish. I will definitely be making this again!!

I made some changes to the recipe, I used more onion, which I sautéed with some minced garlic in olive oil before adding to the mix. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and about 2x as much as called for, as well as more peas than called for, as I try and sneak in veggies when I can. I added parsley, a few sprinkles of cayenne and fresh ground pepper as well. Also, I added some half and half so it would not be dry as other reviewers mentioned. Hubby loved it.

It had been years since I had tuna casserole or made one. A quick search turned up this recipe and it lived up to it's name. I made a half batch since I am only cooking for two. Himself loved it and so did I. I can see making this whenever I have enough leftover pasta or just because.

It was very good! My husband wasn't thrilled when I said I was making tuna casserole for dinner but he enjoyed it too.  I haven't made this dish in at least 30 years and this recipe with delicious and flavourful.... I did add 1/2 cup sour cream and about 1/4 cup of milk but otherwise followed the recipe and it was moist and bubbly.... I lowered my oven to 400 and baked it for 30 minutes, turned off oven and let it sit for 10 min.  The cheese had a nice crisp topping....  will make it again as it is budget friendly.

I made this with slight modifications but the way it turned out it was a 3-star rating for me except my husband liked it (ate a plate full for dinner and another plate full for lunch the next day) so i gave it 4 stars. 

I served it with home-made biscuits.

I looked for a tuna casserole recipe my departed mother made for us growing up.  This was the one I found that was the closest to her recipe.  I read the reviews and incorporated several of the suggestions.  I omitted the peas as I don't recall them in her casserole.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms and the onion, added black pepper and chopped Spanish green olives with pimento,  the juices from the canned tuna and perhaps 1/4 cup of Sauvignon Blanc.  Baked at 350 with the pot covered.  Moist, flavorful, cheesy, no complaints.  AWESOME.  Will make again. And Again.

We really enjoy this. I use cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom, and bread crumbs instead of the potato chips. Also, I don't bother with the onion or canned mushrooms. I have made this several times already.

Beware! I am admitting to changing this recipe based on reviews and watching the video which show a somewhat dry looking dish. 

I pretty much used this recipe as a base and made the following adjustments:
*Dill and tuna work well together so I decided to put salt and dill in my pasta water so the flavor enhanced the noodles a bit.
*used all 12 oz of egg noodles
*didn't realize I was out of onions (which NEVER happens) so I sprinkled the cooked noodles with onion powder quite liberally after draining them. Also added a small amount of butter and salt and pepper at that time.
*Used a family size can of mushroom soup and small can of cheddar cheese soup.
*omitted mushrooms...the mushroom soup had enough
*put most of the shredded cheddar cheese in the mixture and left just enough to sprinkle on top.
*added a dash of smoked paprika because I had some.
*my mixture was thick so I added some milk to loosen it up a bit.
*yes, I kept the peas and potato chips
*Baked at 350 for 30 minutes or more...until bubbly.
My family ages 37 to 14 months DEVOURED this! Not the healthiest dish, but delicious and we have leftovers for tomorrow. Will make it again this winter. Definitely a hearty winter dish.  Very rich and creamy!! We had it with a green side salad.

I made this today.  I doubled the tuna, sauteed onion, celery & bell pepper and used sour cream potato chips.  I also added a lil salt, pepper & garlic powder.  It's a great recipe better than the one I used to make. I haven't cooked this in about 20 years.   My daughter loved it.

Easy, and the kids liked it. But the onions need to be cooked. And it couldn't hurt to cook the peas too. I used 16 oz egg noodles and three cans of cream of mushroom. And I used ritz crackers instead of chips. Next time I'll increase the cheese too.

Good starter as most all are. I added Cayenne. Boiled noodles in a pot, added onions in last minute of boil, drained and added all other ingredients in same pot topped with cheese and chips and baked in oven. All in one pot. I guess I hate to wash extra stuff.

Next time, I will definitely add another can of soup.  As written, this recipe is pretty dry.  Add spices to taste or it will be bland.  It needs salt, pepper, hot sauce... Something!

I added  to the mixed casserole Hormel bacon bites and French's  friend onions.  I used Panko and French's fried onion on top instead of potatoe chips. Mmmmm.  I left it in a 9 x 13 and did not have it dry out on me.

I love, love, love this recipe! After making it as described for a few years, I have discovered the following makes it AWESOME! Cut the noodles to 8 oz. Use dried onion flakes instead of fresh chopped onions, and use sharp cheddar (i.e., Dubliner) cheese. Amazing!

I did everything, but the chips and cheese on top and added peas, carrots and broccoli. I didn't cover it and stuck it in for 30min at 400 degrees because I wanted to make sure the vegetables were cooked all the way.
It turned out amazing and the best thing... My toddler loved it!

Best tuna noodle casserole that I have made.  Even my pickiest loved it.  Only change I made was to use 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup and 1 can of Cream of Celery soup (since that was what I had on hand)...also sautéed the onion with one stick of butter and added the butter plus the onion to the mix.  Mixed all the cheese into the noodles and topped it with crushed potato chips only.  It was delish!

I made this but added a cup of sour cream for each can of soup. It made it much more creamy and moist. It's a hit with my husband, who always hated tuna casserole

I love it the only thing I did differently was leave out the mushrooms and added crushed garlic flavored croutons , I sprinkled them over the top with the additional cheese.  I also used regular large macaroni noodles...

I took the reviews that said it was dry in consideration and the reviews of peoples revisions. I liked the revision of some people that said they added sour cream, milk and butter. I also used someones revision of using the tuna juices for more flavor and extra moisture. I added about half a cup of sour cream, 1/3 cup of milk and a tbs of butter. My husband and i dont like onions so i put a little over a  tsp of onion powder. My husband doesn't like mushrooms and hates cream of mushroom soup, i did not add the mushrooms but still used cream of mushroom soup. I used a blend of cheddar and Monterey jack to mix in the casserole and topped it with mozzarella because that was the only cheese we had.I forgot to buy pees so those didn't make it in there either. I also added about a tsp of celery salt, a few dashes of salt and pepper. I baked it at 350 for 25 mins. My husband loved it, and i also thought it was better than my dads recipe (thats saying alot because he is the best homecook i know, but latly i have been taking his recipes and making them much better)

I loved it, and so did my roommate!  I added a few other veggies that I like and accidentally opened one can of super spicey tuna.  I was afraid the spice might not be so good, but it just added a zing to it!

This was a good recipe. Its was my first attempt. The casserole came out a bit mushroomy for my liking, but it was good overall with a little Chili paste condiment.

As written this is a good base recipe, but pretty bland. It needs some work. I sauteed some celery and the onion beforehand to ensure they cook down, i used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and i used 3 cans of soup, about 1/2 soup can of milk and 1/4 c or so of sour cream, a pinch of garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne and it was excellent. Add whatever seasonings you like otherwise it will be incredibly bland.

Yes it is a tad dry but OMG I haven't had this in years and it was just delicious! I had no mushrooms so no mushrooms, no onions so I used dried chopped, only used 3/4 pkg of the no yolk noodles.
Potato chips and cheese on top are awesome!!

This was amazing but I made major changes: I halved the recipe (except for the cheese: 1 cup mixed in & 1 cup on top). I sautéed the onion, peas and some minced garlic in 3/4 cup butter and used the melted butter in the recipe. I added a few heaping spoonfuls of miracle whip and a small squirt of mustard. Instead of tuna I used a can of chicken in buffalo sauce (didn't drain sauce). I added the rest of the ingredients except for the can of mushrooms and chip crumbs. I baked it at 350° for 20 minutes. Then I broiled the cheese on top until crispy and light brown. The buffalo flavor was subtle but there was definitely a zip of flavor that was delicious. The casserole was very rich and creamy and I'm definitely making it again using these changes!!

I love this dish! I did change it up a bit though. I used 2 cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic flavor. Also instead of green peas, I chopped up a half fresh Jalapeno to add some spice. For the cheese, I did one cup cheddar and one cup mozzarella to make it a little healthier. I did not use chips. This came out amazing! Next time, I am going to use the whole jalapeno and add cherry tomatoes and then also sauté the onions in olive oil beforehand.

I used whole wheat egg noodles and was great dish.   Also used saltines and scallions fried in butter for the topping and was pleased with results.  Definitely not dry or too salty.

Great! Used 36.5 ounces total (1-26 oz can and 1- 10.5 oz can) of Cream of Mushroom soup.  Omitted the extra can of mushrooms. Reduced noodles to about 8 ounces (half of a 16 oz bag). Added 1 cup of milk and 1/3 cup sour cream plus 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 dash each cayenne pepper and paprika.  Mixture was therefore soupy before baking but after baking the casserole was perfectly moist.

I did 1 box regular noodles, 1 can of soup, 1 cup chicken canned, 1 can corn, !/4 cup of onions, 3/4 a cup of cheese. I sprinkled cheese on top and then I used fried onions instead of potato chips. With the changes, it was good and wasnt even dry. It may have been because I was making less, but it was very good.

This is a very good recipe.  It was a really surprising, nice change, from the everyday meat and potato dinners I normally cook.  Everyone loved it, second helpings! with very minor changes to the recipe. Very good!  The minor change was garlic salad croutons (crushed) instead of potato chips and the addition of sweet canned corn. The change to croutons saved me a trip to the grocery store for potato chips.

Like everyone else, I needed a base recipe upon which to make my own changes. I add 1 C of sour cream, corn and black beans (along with peas), omit the onion and mushrooms (we don't like them) and add garlic and onion powder, cayenne, Johnny's and a diced jalapeno (we like it spicy!). Then for the top, I crumble Tims Jalapeno chips. YUMMYYYYY!!!!! I never liked tuna casserole in the past but this is one of my all time favorites now!

This casserole was good but I prefer something creamier so I usually make a sauce instead of canned soup - which I tried out as I was pressed for time! I sauteed the onions in a pan first before adding to the dish which was a nice subtle sweetness, and bypassed the crunchiness. I also used panko crumbs instead of chips which was still a nice topping and used cheese only in the mix and not on top. All in all, really quick and tasty.

Flavors were very good. I used a shallot as i didnt have much onion. I found the dish too dry. Would add some milk or half and half next time.

My first time making and trying tuna casserole - it was very good!  My husband liked it as well.  I added more onion and sauteed till almost caramelized before adding to the mixture. I also used fresh mushrooms vs canned and left out the peas since neither my husband nor I like them.  Per other's suggestions I added at least a cup of sour cream and also added a dash of Worcestershire Sauce and Thyme.  I combined everything in a warm pan before placing in the baking dish.  I used French's onions instead of chips, which were really good but imagine the chips would give it a nice crunch as well. Make sure and wait and put French's Onions on top at very end of baking, I put on for the full 15 - 20 min and they got a little too brown.  I will definitely start making this on a regular basis!

I've made this recipe a few times and after preparing it exactly as the recipe instructed the first time have made 4 changes.   The first is I cook the onions for about 3-4 minutes before adding them to the casserole, the second I add 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup, the third is I use spicy bread crumbs instead of the potato chips, and the fourth is I don't drain the tuna to add a little liquid to the casserole.  My sixteen year old hates any kind of fish but will actually eat this.  I would have given this recipe five stars but if prepared exactly as instructed its far too dry and too salty with the potato chips.

I made this recipe with alterations.  I used two 12 ounce cans of tuna. I did not think 6 ounces was enough. I used 3 cans of soup and a cup of milk.  I read reviews about adding the cheese to the casserole.  I used crushed chips on 3/4 of the casserole and left the other 1/4 without.  I personally like it without better.  I also used one can of Lesuer english peas instead of frozen.  It was a nice recipe.

Very quick to make. Difficult to mix. It is yummy as is but I feel like it needed a little more flavor or seasoning, maybe salt and pepper. Note I did not put mushrooms in it so that may be the culprit. I made mine in a crystal casserole dish and covered it and it was not so dry. Maybe adding more soup will make it better.

This tastes great! its so easy! I thought it was a touch dry in a 9x13 dish though, I recommend adding some more dairy, milk, cream, sour cream... to the bowl until it starts "talking" to you. You know that sound of stirring something goupy. Then bake as instructed

We did not enjoy this dish. 
It could be good if you precooked onions with fresh mushrooms. Added milk to the mix cause it was very dry and omit the peas.

I made this recently and it was great. I've never made or eaten tuna casserole before and I loved it. I didn't have chips, so I didn't use any. Also, I used a family size can of cream of mushroom soup (I think it was 25 oz.) so it would be creamy. I took the suggestion to add pimento and kept the peas, it was nice and colorful, and tasted great. Needed some salt and pepper, though. I didn't really measure the cheese, I estimated and probably used slightly more than the recipe and mixed it all in rather than on top. Also, the noodles were 16 oz. I think. I used the whole package and put it in a 9x13 pan. I cooked it on 350 but the frozen peas still seemed a little crunchy. That might have been my imagination, though. All in all, great recipe!

I would suggest sautéing the onion, we used a white onion but really any onion sautéed would be good. I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. I did add extra cheese and would either add sour cream or milk next time. I did the cheese on top first and then topped with thin potato chips which browned nicely. I was craving my moms tuna casserole and since she has been gone 28 years and I've only attempted this recipe once before this was spot on! Oh yes and I also used frozen peas and doubled them as well! For sure will rewrite this for my kids to have!

Not bad, but I'd add some milk to it.....it was too thick with the two cans of soup and nothing to make it creamier.

Made this tonight and it was delish.  I used rotini pasta because that's what I had.  Replaced the peas with 1 cup of frozen mixed veggies and added 1/2 a soup can of milk to keep it from getting too dry.  I had no mushrooms so had to skip those.  My family loved it!

I halved this recipe and it was enough for our family of 4. I followed the other reviewers advice and added a soup can of milk and a dollop of sour cream and a dollop of mayonnaise.  I used an entire bag of frozen mixed vegetables and cooked them with the noodles.  Everyone enjoyed this recipe.

I made this recipe tonight with some modifications.  With the small changes, it was fantastic!  First I used bow tie pasta and added about 2 T. of chopped garlic to the water toward the end of the cooking time.  I drained the pasta and garlic over the top of 2 cups of peas in a strainer.  I added one soup can of milk to the base mixture and put the cheese in to blend.  I then topped it with French's fried onions and some garlic salt with about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  I used a lasagna pan and lightly covered the pan with some foil during the cooking time.  It was a hit!

After reading reviews I took the advice of several and added an extra can of soup and some sour cream and it was very moist.  I used a mini penne pasta instead of the noodles.  I have a husband who will not eat peas or carrots so I substituted red and green peppers and I used fresh baby bella mushrooms.  I used Cape Cod kettle potato chips and it was very good.  It is a good recipe that can easily be 'tweeked' to suit anyone's personal taste.

This recipe was ok. I followed the directions exactly and thought it was REALLY dry. It definitely needs at least another can and some milk. Also wouldn't hurt to add some spices too like other reviewers suggest: pepper, cayenne, etc.

I make this in a round casserole dish and never have any dry out problems. I usually eyeball the cheese (which means more than what is called for) and use rippled chips. Never had a complaint and the leftovers get eaten!

Awesome...I only made one change.  I put in 4 extra ounces of cream of mushroom soup to make it really creamy!  Family love it!

This was very easy to make. My husband HATES tuna yet he enjoyed this. I used coconut milk instead of can of soup and flavored it with bouillon. I didn't use the potato chips I just used sheep cheese. My husband can't do cows milk so we have to use alternatives. It turned out pretty good :)

Lovely recipe. Made the following modifications to use what I already have on hand and to limit the saturated fat:
1. Organic Penne Ziti instead of egg noodles.
2. Fresh mushrooms and 1/2 sweet onion.  Lightly sautéed in 1/4 tbsp. butter for taste before mixing in with the pasta.
3. 1 can Recipe Starters creamy mushroom and 1/2 can three-cheese.
4. Skipped the peas.
5. Added a healthy splash of Worcestershire sauce and a pinch of onion powder and garlic salt.
6. Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs.
7. Baked in non-stick sauté pan (the type with a coarse bottom for searing).  The bottom is more evenly done and doesn't stick.
It is very creamy and moist.  Wow!

I used what was on hand, and it still turned out great. Read that it was dry so I added milk. Put in a whole bag of frozen peas and broccoli. Diced up some peppers for a kick, I only had one can of cream of mushroom so added two cans of cream of broccoli with it. Added seasoning and added to the dish. I used the reg dish. And then I melted butter with crackers instead of chips. I also had to cook mine longer. I took it out at 20 minutes but the broccoli and some of it was still coldish. Added another ten minutes but it probably could've gone for fifteen.

I'd give this a solid 4.5.  It was tasty and I looked forward to the leftovers.  I would make it again.  I might try it with bread crumbs instead of potato chips next time.

OMG! this was amazing! I was so skeptical of it but I always read other reviews to get an idea of what to do to tweet.  I took the suggestion to add an extra can of soup.  I put chicken, mushroom, and celery can soups and 2 1/2 cheese and instead of potato chips I used garlic croutons.  I crushed them in the blender and it was just DELIOUS!!! Also I didn't have the proper noodles the recipe called for but I spaghetti noodles and it worked.  I just broke them up smaller so it wont be so long. This is one of those recipes you do when you have food that you don't know what to do with. GREAT RECIPE!! Definitely make this again!

This is a very good recipe, however, first of all, my husband doesn't like peas, so I completely omitted them.  Also, instead of 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, I only used one, and then added a 8 oz. of sour cream in place of the 2nd can of soup. I definitely added the mushrooms, but I use fresh sliced mushrooms, if I have them on hand.  Don't skimp on the crushed potato chips.  This is what makes this dish flavorful & crunchy.  Even young children will enjoy the crispy potato chip crumbs.

Followed the recipe with zero changes. I thought this recipe was REALLY good.  Very simple, and I froze the leftovers and it heated up nicely, just leave potato chips off part of the casserole.

I have made this many times and here is my best way. I mix this recipe with the from scratch recipe so I use 1 can of whatever condensed soup I want that night and mix that with a celery, onion, butter and flour type gravy soup, I also use total about 2 1/4  cups of milk and half cup sour cream for an entire bag if noodles I put the final half cup milk in half way thru cooking. I use swiss cheese on my first layer as we are fans, we like spicy so on the adult portions we top with buffalo sauce, and finally we smoother it over honey cornbread for a heartier meal! Hope this helps! Enjoy

good bones, but I had to tweek it which is why I only rated it 3 stars.  The way it's written it would have been too dry for my taste.  I upped the sauce content to 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of celery and 1 small container of sour cream and also added about 1 cup of milk.  I also don't like onions raw so I cooked-sautee'd them with some minced garlic, prior to adding them in. I also don't like mushrooms so I omitted them.  I also added Salt and Pepper to taste.   like I said this recipe was a great starting point for me to customize for my taste.  I thought this recipe would be really good with kielbasa or ham instead of tuna, as well!

Found this to be very dry, even though I added an extra can of soup. Even made it in a deeper dish casserole pan like other reviewers said but it was still dry. Won't make it again.

My husband could not stop eating it - said he could eat the whole casserole it was so good. Mine was not dry at all. I lined the pan with tinfoil, forgot to add mushrooms, cut the noodles by an ounce or so, and used three 5 oz cans of tuna. It was awesome.

I made this dish as directed... was not really impressed.  If I do make it again, I will probably sauté the onions and mushrooms first, thaw the peas before mixing them in and had a bit more seasoning.

The cheese on top dried out and wasn't bubbly at all.  Next time I will probably just mix all the cheese in the mixture and shred the cheese on top after i take it out of the oven.  Other then that we loved it, even my 8 month old daughter loved it.  I will definitely be adding this to my favorites list.

This is a very good easy tuna casserole, but I'm giving it 3 stars because I think the measurements were way off and the prep time was more than stated.  Too many noodles!  I used 2-1/2 c.  Onion - I used 1/2 tsp onion powder to cut down on prep time.  Too much cheese - I used 1 cup.  1/2 cup peas.   One can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can milk.  I will make again with those adjustments.

I put all the cheese in with mixture, used frozen corn in place of peas, only had 1 can of cream of mushroom soup so used 1 can of cream of celery.  I made this in the morning, put all together except for potato chips, refrigerated till 1 hour before meal and added them last 15 minutes of baking time. Delicious!

My favorite tuna casserole recipe with one change.  Add the small (5 ounce) can of evaporated milk. No dry casserole, just creamy and good.

Oh yes best tuna casserole ever.  Didn't have chips so used French-fried onions crushed on top.  Excellent and heated up the next day very well.  Thank you!

This casserole is so delicious!  I made it as written, with the exception of the onion.  Since I already had the cheese grater out, I just grated the onion too.  I don't think I used as much as the recipe called for.  I didn't measure it.

Excellent! Added about 1/2 cup more cheese on the inside, used a full can mushroom instead of a half can, and used 2cups mixed veggies instead of 1 cup peas. Turned out excellent!!

As others suggested, I added a soup can of milk - I could tell that it would be very dry otherwise.  I didn't add the onion and added 1 cup cooked broccoli instead of peas.  It was ok, but bland - maybe use cheddar soup next time or french fried onions might be good - would remind me of the green bean casserole.

Made this on a whim to use up items I had in my pantry and fridge. I kicked it up a notch by substituting pepper jack cheese and old bay flavored potato chips because I didn't have the required ingredients. A well received zesty version of the recipe as evidenced by no leftovers.

I made this last night. It was very good. The things I would modify:

-either add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup OR substitute milk for the extra can.

-double the tuna

-double the onion. I didn't taste much of the onion even though I chopped it very finely.

Other than that, I found this recipe a great base recipe to work with. It had good flavor too!

Very good recipe.   It does require a bit of modification in my opinion.   The biggest element about this recipe as written is that it lacks moisture.  I pretty much make a double batch and the first time I made it I could see when mixing it all together that it was going to need something to make it moist.  I just added a couple cups of milk.  Even when I added milk the first time out it still came out a little dry.   Don't be afraid to use milk (or water) when using condensed soup as the binding agent. 
Also, mix it very very well.  I used a mixture of cheddar and italian mixed cheese.  Cheese is a preference thing.  there is no wrong cheese to use (within logical reason) so use it as it is or add your favorite kind.

Also, if you use a convection oven as I do, you need to convert the temp.  I run my over for this recipe at 375 and add some time to cook it through.  the first time I forgot to convert and 425 at 15 minutes had the potato chips and cheddar dark dark brown. so I converted to 375 for about 30 minutes.

Overall this is a great recipe.  Just add some milk and make sure you mix thoroughly.

I try not to review recipes unless I follow the recipe as stated, but I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I used medium shell noodles instead of the egg noodles, canned corn instead of the peas, onion powder instead of the onion, and I used sea salt and vinegar potato chips on top.  It was fantastic!

This tuna casserole was great! My recipe is similar but adding the cheese and the onion was inspired.  My differences are the use of macaroni instead of egg noodles, I like mine more moist so I added milk, used green onion for a mild flavor and topped it with BBQ chips. Thank you for the recipe.

My boyfriend, my daughter and I tried this recipe and loved it. I would not use the onions any more and I did without the potato chips and used all three cans of soup and added in a 5 ounce of tuna. Its perfect without the onions and use a third can of soup.

I was Searching for a good recipe to fill my husbands hunger for tuna casserole and THIS IS NOT IT! It is a good basis but needs a lot of fixing up!! definitely NOT "THE BEST" I would suggest Mozzarella/ cheddar mix cheese and double the amount (4 cups) add garlic and maybe some salt pepper to taste- the soup makes it thick but needs 3 cans or maybe add some milk or water to the soup before adding in with noodles- i MIGHT try this again because my husband likes tuna casserole but will definitely make some changes-it could only get better i don't think I've ever had worse!

This was awesome! My husband is not a fan of the traditional version of it, but he loved this one. The only thing that I changed was the potato chips for garlic-butter croutons, since it was what I had and it came out great. Thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe is amazing. I used breadcrumbs instead of potato chips. My boyfriend and I devoured the whole recipe in a day. My boyfriend's only complaint was that it could have used a little bit of spice.

This ended up being too dry.  Needs more of a sauce instead of just condensed soup.  Also, if you end up having leftovers the potato chips just turn into a soggy mess.

This is, in fact, the BEST tuna casserole I have tasted/made!  I will say that I didn't have 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, so I substituted Fage nonfat greek yogurt for one of the cans of soup.  It was GREAT, and I will make this recipe following that modification moving forward... lower sodium, less fat, great alternative.  Thanks for posting such an amazing recipe!

This was super quick, so that earns the 4 stars.  I thought this recipe was okay, but not the one I was looking for. I have to admit that I had to make substitutions.  Probably I should only rate what I actually follow!  I put a bit less onion in it and I didn't use the mushrooms.  And I had only one cup of the shredded cheddar so I added some American.  My grandkids and husband liked it and I liked it too, but it wasn't our favorite.  We did really like the topping -- so yummy!

I like many others am not a tuna casserole fan. Not until this recipe. I took advice from some of the other people who responded and sauteed the onion with garlic in butter , then substituted one of the cans of soup with cream of celery. Used canned mushrooms and added about 3/4 C of sour cream and the same amount of milk.  I didn't have potato chips so instead I crumbled "Club" crackers on top and this was absolutely delicious. I reduced the temp to 375 because I omitted the peas and pre-cooked the onion. It was moist and the crackers gave it the right amount of crunch. Yummmm

This was very tasty, but as other commented it was just a little on the dry side on the edges.  I will try adding a little milk and cook in a round dish next time.  This was even better as leftovers.

I heeded the advice of others and added one more can of cream of mushroom soup. I also used fresh mushrooms to add a little more moisture. I skipped the breadcrumbs on top cause frankly, I don't like them. It came our perfectly. It was nice and moist, very tuna tasting and the cheese got yummy and bubbly. My 2 year old, my 9mo AND my husband gobbled it up. WIN.

Delicious! My family loved it, although I used half a cup of white onion and fried onions for the top instead of the french fries because we like onions a lot. I used two 7-ounce cans of tuna as well. It was not dry at all, maybe because of the extra amount of ingredients I added.

Not too bad but thought the recipe was too dry. It has too many noodles or needs more sauce. Maybe add some milk and 1-2 more cans of cream of mushroom. Sour cream might also work. Going to experiment with this recipe. It has potential but it just was not creamy enough.

I had high hopes for this recipe due to the ratings.  I was unimpressed and my one child who will eat almost anything with a noodle in it, didn't even finish it.  I had read the reviews that complained of dryness and I added a can of evaporated milk which helped with that issue.  I did saute the onions in a bit of oil in order to soften them up but on a whole this was an uninspiring, bland recipe.  I just don't know what this recipe needs but it is lacking something.

The casserole was really good! I did change a few things, though. I added extra milk (not exactly sure how much because I just kinda winged it until I got a somewhat soupy consistency) and I also only used 1/2 cup of peas since no one in our household is big on them. I used low sodium canned soup too since I don't like a lot of sodium in my food.

Followed other reviews and added just a bit of milk to make it less dry. Was very tasty.

It was ok -- my friend and I made it as the recipe exactly as instructed and it was as most people said... very dry. I also found it to be rather bland. I would make it again but make the following changes: 
- I would add milk + sour cream.. I think it's really weird that the recipe doesn't call for this to begin with, I'm no culinary genius but whenever I use canned soup for anything I always make sure to add milk.
- I would not use as much onion. It was overwhelming. 
- It needed spices so much. If you follow the directions exactly it is sooo bland. The next day the flavors blended together more but.. still.. Personally I would try adding tarragon next time since I know tuna and tarragon go well together.

This was the bomb! Loved it, my wife and I couldn't stop eating it. We added an additional can of soup and fresh slice mushroom instead of can. The left over was just as good on the 2nd day. Keeper.

Next time I make this, I am going to cook the onions before adding them as they remain pretty much raw. I will also add a half a cup of milk. This recipe has the potential to be really good.

This was OK but next time I will use regular cream of mushroom soup instead of low sodium. It had very little flavor except for the onions (and the potato chips on top, of course. Otherwise a decent recipe.

Actually it was my husband that found this one - he was looking for a low fat tuna casserole; no butter or milk in this one. The only change we made was panko crumbs instead of the chips. It's quite good, moist and flavourfull.

I was looking for something quick that I didn't have to run to the store for and this worked well.  I had to change it up a bit. I didn't have egg noodles so I used Macaroni. It was dry and a did add some milk. I didn't have an onion so I used dried minced onion and added mrs.dash and minced garlic and extra cheese. We had three almost empty bags of flavored chips but when done you didn't taste flavor from chips. Didnt put in peas.  Served peas on the side. All together it was good. Oh and I had only one can of cream of mushroom so used a can of cream of chicken.  I would add milk for sure though to make it less dry.

I liked it, was hoping to love it, but I'm rating a 3 be-c noone else in my family liked it. Unfortunately my husband came in to the meal with a bias against tuna with pasta and I think that prevented him from trying to try and ejoy it. He loves my tuna salads on crackers or bread, but doesn't like any tuna pasta salads or hamburger helper type meals much. What he most liked was my cruncy topping made of a mix of potato chips, grated cheddar and french's fried onion bits. Unfortunately, I have more than half left with noone else who will want to eat leftovers, they could barely eat firsts! So i guess y'all know what I'll be eating again soon. 

I too changed mine up a bit and still it wasn't all that. Here is what I did, since we don't like mushrooms I only used 1 can cream of mush and 1 can cream of celery. I added about 1 1/2 cups peas and 1 cup corn be-c we love vegetables (okay, except mushrooms). I also added about 2 half cans of milk (1 from each of my differing cans) and added garlic salt and fresh ground pepper. Mine came out nice and creamy and I only added the cheesy crunch topping in the last 5 to 7 mins. of baking time so they would stay crunchy. Looked good but unfortunately not a winner and one I will not be making again. Thanks anyway as it was an easy meal to prepare.

Great recipe exactly as written!  This reminds me of the tuna casserole my mother made when I was growing up.  Especially because of the potato chips.  My husband loved it and I did too.

It was okay. I feel it needed something else. Maybe S/P or more liquid. Not very creamy, kind of dry. I won't be making it again. Well I made it again.  Not reading  the reviews until after I made it. This time I added some half and half and butter.  Not sure how it will turn out. Also added black pepper.

5 stars for a great base recipe. I modified it with what I had on hand and it turned out amazing. I sauteed the onions with garlic in a tad bit of butter first. I used 1 lb box of Barilla elbows and added about a cup each of frozen peas and corn. I used 2 cans of 25% less sodium cream of mush soup, and just added garlic powder, black pepper, chili powder and seasoned salt to taste and one 12 oz can of albacore tuna, juices and all since I had no milk to add. I put a small amount of cubed pepper jack cheese, along with shredded colby jack mixed with everything. On top I layered a thin layer of colby jack, a few strips of pepper jack, then thin layer of bread crumbs followed by another thin layer of shredded colby jack. I baked it same as the recipe called for. Everything was excellent.

I have tried this recipe and in experimentation after pre-reading how dry the original is, added 1/2 can of milk (washed out one of the cream of mushroom soup cans) and added it to the combination prior to baking. Hey, no leftovers, must have been good:)

I love this recipe.  It is a wonderful comfort food just as written.  Normally I follow some of the tips like sauteing the onion, celery and garlic for a bit before making the cheese sauce.  I also substitute a can of cream of celery soup for one of the mushroom soup cans.  In lieu of the potato chips I like to use the garlic and herb baked pita chips that I whiz up in my magic bullet.

Good base...I used velveeta shells and cheese...what I had. I sauteed up some celery and mushrooms and added that along with the cr. of mush. and peas and did the chips on top. Turned out great and not dry at all.

This has become one of my families favorite recipes.  The kids LOVE it!  I have found it delicious to saute some fresh mushrooms instead of using the canned.  It tastes so good this way.  Definitely a staple meal in our house.  We eat it every 2-3 weeks. I've made it for guests and they've all loved it.

I liked this.  I cooked the noodles a little longer than I planned, but then I added a full 4 oz of canned mushrooms with the fluid.  Mine wasn't dry at all.  I did use the 9 x 11 casserole pan.

I made an error in my March 1st review.  I meant to say that I use a 1/2 can of milk per can of cream soup.  I use this ratio when making most casseroles.

My family really enjoyed this.  The only major substitution I had to make was pimentos for the peas.  I also used shoestring potatoes and dried onions instead of chips and fresh onion.  It was not dry at all.  Nice comfort food.

This was pretty tasty. I made some alterations for our family's tastes-but those aren't really important. What I was disappointed in (which made it 3 stars) would be how soggy and unappealing the potato chips got the next day. It was super gross..I guess the only way to fix this would try to make the exact size you will use/eat.

It was not creamy enough for my taste. Either the amount of noodles is too much or milk needs to be added, I don't know, but I won't be making this version again. :(

Delicious, and will definitely make again. We always health things up in the house so I made the following changes. Extra can of low sodium tuna for protein, healthy request soup, no potato chips, and light cheddar.  Fantastic and tasty!

This my first review. Husband loved it (calling it almost a 10, very very picky kids (2,4 and 7) were willing to eat the chips (duh) and pasta plain with some butter. I tried to make it as close to wheat free as I could. Here are the revisions I made that worked for us. I only had one can of cream of mushroom (which was 98% fat free) so basically I halved the recipe. I deleted the peas, used corn penne pasta (from Trader Joes) that is gluten free, added 1/2 cup milk per other suggestions, added 1/2 can of mild green chiles and used crunched up Maui Onion Kettle Chips (also wheat/gluten free) on the top after I took the casserole out of the oven. We are not a gluten/wheat free family but considering going that route for better health. Also, if you are wheat free, please note that the cream of mushroom soup does have some wheat in it. I will look for a substitute for it. This is an easy recipe for sure!

I took the advice from another review and used a red onion opposed to a regular yellow onion. I also added some pepper, paprika and chili flakes to add some spice into the dish. I did not find this dish dry at all. Absolutely loved it and will make it again!

Good, but not special, taste is similar to "Tuna Helper" but more effortful IMO. I will probably stick to the box stuff since the results are similar.

Well I didn't have everything to make this tuna noodle casserole but it was still the bomb. I didn't have shredded cheese but I did have packages of sliced colby and Pepper Jack cheese, I had mixed veggies instead of peas and french fried onions instead of potato chips. So with all this in mind I made up the casserole as directed above replacing peas with mixed veggies. Since I had sliced cheese I did one lay of everything mixed together then did a layer alternating the two kinds of cheese then poured the rest of the mixture and layered alternating the different kinds of cheese. Then I ran the French Fried Onions thru the processor to make crumbles then baked. Oh my goodness!! The flavor was absolutely delish and there was a kick to my Tuna Noodle Casserole.

Very good - the kids liked it, and it was super easy and fast. I used shells since I didn't have egg noodles, and buttered saltines since I didn't have potato chips. I didn't have peas or mushrooms - which was fine since my kids don't like either. I used a 9x13, cooked at 350 for 15-20 minutes. Very flexible recipe. It's a keeper!

This was a good recipe and very easy to make. I took some advice from others and sauteed the onions first before adding it to the casserole to bake so it wouldn't be undercooked, I seasoned the mix with some salt and garlic salt so it wouldn't be plain, I added 1 can milk and about half cup of sour cream so it wouldn't be dry. I used panko bread crumbs.  I also baked this in a 9X12 disposable aluminum tray and it cooked with no troubles. Would make again.

I hate fish! There I said it. Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! But I was going to be a good example and eat it so my 3 year old would. Not fishy tasting at all. We used Smart Taste noodles, added a large jar of pimientos, and 1cup of crushed chips in the casserole. Also put the chips on top of the cheese, so they would stay crunchy. Could easily do this again.

Pretty good stuff. Maybe the best thing about it is fast prep time. I deviated from the instructions a bit an used canned peas rather than frozen. That proved to be a poor choice as they turned out a little mushy and flavorless. Stick to the recipe and you have a fast and tasty weeknight choice.

Just tried this recipe tonight.  I love the recipes on this site that help you have a foundation to begin with and then you can make it your own.  I like seasoning so I added seasoning: garlic powder, black pepper, ground coriander and small dose of cayenne pepper. I never, ever add as much onion as anyone suggests so I only added finely chopped, maybe the 1/4 cup. I also added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup plain yogurt to combat the dryness that other reported.  Very good and tasty.  Four stars since I had to add moisture.

When mixing the ingredients, I knew that it would be too dry. I added some milk before putting it into a round stoneware casserole dish. I added a bit of salt and pepper and instead of canned mushrooms, I rinsed some fresh ones and then drained the pasta over them before adding to the mixture. Good recipe.

It should ask to add salt and pepper, and 3 cans of mushroom soup...and personally I would sautee the onions in butter before adding them to the casserole, I am not a fan of onions and they really threw me off..

I like to saute the onions and mushrooms in a little butter before mixing. Do not use low fat or light cheese as it jus turns into a hard crust on top. Be sure not to overdo it on the chips either for the same reason. I love it and it's super easy.

I followed the advice of others and added more liquid (a can of water), also used wheat egg noodles. Was excellent - I really thought it was better the second day.

This was just okay.  Not bad but not great.  It was a little drier than I like and the onions should be sauteed first otherwise they stay pretty raw.

I am an amateur to casseroles and this one was pretty good. I took the advice I read from others about it being dry, so I added 1 1/2 cup of half and half. It was nice and creamy!!!! I also added less than half a tsp of salt and used bread crumbs (I didn't have potato chips). It was okay with the bread crumbs. I'll definitely do the chips next time. Great recipe, thanks!!!

I thought this was a nice spin on tuna casserole.  Even though I love onions, I think the next time I will omit them.  Otherwise, very good.

Made this for a 2nd time tonight. I usually avoid canned soups, but this one is the perfect comfort food. The only change I think I'd make is to add in a little bit of sour cream. This recipe has that little bit of "tang" that I'd like a little more of. I did sauté my onions first, but followed as written(I may have increased the pepper, but that is highly personal... Oh and dropped the peas, because they taste like gym socks smell, also personal). Delicious! This is my go to recipe.

Update from 1 star to 5 star, substituted peas for broccoli, added 2tbsp of butter, no mushrooms and used 1 can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken. Used 16oz of penned noodles, no topping. I basically added and deducted what i had on hand. Delicious. People said it was a dry dish however my soups were 2oz bigger and I did not drain the tuna, came out very moist.

This is a great base recipe, but I modified it as well. Added a cup of sour cream and 1/3 cup of milk. Also used fresh finely sliced mushrooms (about 1 cup), and a whole minced onion. Added garlic to the onion and sauteed it in olive oil before adding it to the mixture. I also added about 3/4 of a teaspoon of Cayenne pepper, and 1/2 a teaspoon celery salt. Salt and black pepper to taste. Didn't use the potato chips as stated, not necessary.

I did the modifications the second time around of making this, and my husband LOVES this recipe with the Cayenne pepper. It gives it a great kick.

I had nothing thawed and had to turn to the pantry tonight. My husband hates fish in all forms, so I thought I'd pull a fast one on him with this recipe. I added about 1/2 cup of milk, sauteed mushrooms and onions before adding to the mix, added a good shake of cayenne, added frozen mixed veggies instead of just peas, and used some nice, thick spaetzle in place of the egg noodles. It was so good my husband went back for thirds before he realized he was eating fish. Definitely a winner and a great pantry recipe.

I have never made tuna casserole before but per my husbands request decided to try this one and I'm so glad I did! Even our 2 year old daughters loved this.I used a 16 oz bag of egg noodles and therefore added almost a cup of sour cream to prevent drying out.  I also sauteed the onions with 1 lb sliced mushrooms before adding (we love mushrooms). Probably will make this the exact same way next time as it was easy and good.

Love the peas and mushrooms.  Instead of canned I used fresh, and I topped it with french fried onions instead of chips.  The best part was my kids ate it too, which is sometimes tricky

This is a lovely casserole with some modifications (which is why I dropped a star).  I took reviewer suggestions and upped the sauce by adding an extra can of soup (this one cream of chicken) and a full can of milk -- it made it the PERFECT creaminess, so I wouldn't dream of making it with any less.  I left out the peas and mushrooms since both of them are not my favorite, and I used extra onion but sauteed them first so they wouldn't overpower the dish, which they didn't.  Made it in a 2-qt casserole as suggested by others, and I waited until the very end before sprinkling the cheese on top of the chips -- just added it when the casserole was done and put it back in just long enough to let it melt, so the cheese didn't get crispy at all.  Comfort food at it's best!

Very good!  I took suggestions from others and added a little sour cream, milk and season-salt.  My friend did not like the onions.  I may saute' them next time prior to mixing them in, thus making them a little softer texture.  Great recipe.  Thanks JAICARD.

Very hearty.  I was really hungry so I used the whole bag of noodles, 3 cans of soup and 1.5 cans of milk (soy).  Turned out great.  I think I remember having it with celery before.  I'll add that next time.  Get your veggies in where you can.  Thanks.

Should have sauted the onion first. Didn't care for the taste of it going in casserole raw. The potato chips really didn't  anything. My daughter thought they were a odd combo with the noodles. will omit them next time

Good except for we're not mushroom soup people.  We'll try it again with cream of chicken or cheese soup.

I did not like this recipe neither did my son. It was bland at best I gave it one star solely on the fact that it was filling, next time I will save myself some time and just eat the noodles straight from the box.

I made mine with wheat penne pasta (because I had it on hand), and put French's fried onions on top instead of potato chips. It was awesome. Mine didn't come out dry, like some others have reported. I will definitely make it again.

this one is great.  i grew up on tuna noodle casserole. it was our family's guilty secret.  i have tried several from this site and this is just right.  i omit the mushrooms, use one can of low sodium/fat cream of mushroom and one can of low sodium/fat cream of chicken.  i also toss in just a bit of red chili powder and paprika and serve Siracha on the side.  YUM YUM.

Quick, easy, and very good. Next time I would add less noodles to make it creamier and to make a little less. We loved it!

Made this as per the recipe, except used fewer egg noodles and 2 C turkey instead of the tuna, because that's what I had.  I did add some milk before I put it in the oven, as it seemed a bit dry.  It was delicious and the 3 of us at almost the whole thing.  A throwback to the tuna casserole my Mom used to my when I was a kid.

Great recipe!    added monterrey jack cheese instead of cheddar.  I thought it was a little dry so next time I'll add 1/2 cup milk.  I'll make this again and again.

This was very good! I did make some changes I cut the recipe in ½, I used Asiago cheese it’s a sharp cheese, has a lot of favor, omitted the peas and used all the mushrooms.  I will make again, I gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe!

I love this recipe! I usually hate tuna casserole, but this one's not your average, run of the mill, weird tasting tuna casserole! I top mine with crushed Cheez-its and I also add a dollop or two of light sour cream. YUM!

Thanks fro sharing a great recipe! Due to requests I omitted the cheese and peas (they don't know what they are missing!). I used crushed Ritz crackers and used other reviewers suggestions by using more milk, adding some sour cream & garlic, and using half cream of mushroom soup & half cream of celery soup. I made this for a crowd and it was a hit!

As written, this is too dry.  I added another can of cream of mushroom soup along with a cup & 1/2 of milk.  I also added some salt & pepper.  It was a little bland tasting to me.  I'll stick to my other recipe for tuna casserole.  Thanks for sharing thou.

My husband has a Costco obsession, meaning that when we buy tuna (which he likes, too) we've got 20 or so cans of it.  It also means I have to find ways to use tuna in various meals that don't all taste like...tuna.  This was a definite winner.   I didn't have 2 cans of cream of mushroom, so I added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream and more milk.  I also used panko crumbs mixed with garlic butter as the crust instead of chips.  Still really good.

Excellent - very tasty and simple and exactly what I was looking for.  Did add 1/2 cup of milk to recipe to make it a bit more juicy.  Also, if you use a deeper casserole dish you will need to cook longer - more like 35-40 mins. or else it will be bubbly hot on the top and sides but stone cold in the center!

Great base recipe that you can modify to fit your tastes! I did end up adding about 4 oz. sour cream so this didn't end up dry. Topped with parmesan cheese instead of crushed chips because I didn't want the topping to be to greasy. Also, I shredded my own cheese -this is the way to go! Shredding your own is cheaper and the cheese doesn't have that nasty powder stuff on it t keep from sticking. This recipe is a keeper and I will make again.

We had not done a tuna casserole in a long time and the kids raved about it. I did not add enough tuna and will use 2 cans next time. It is even better the next day so make enough for your lunch tomorrow too!

This was really good and easy to make. I didn't think it was dry. I used baked potatoes chips but I didn't crush them enough so they got burned - had to scrap some off. Besides that I thought it was great.

3 stars = Good. Subbed green beans instead of mushrooms and totally forgot the peas, but oh well.  Used 1/2 the cheese, too, and put Grape Nuts on top instead. Easy.  Tasty.  Plenty of leftovers!

Wow! I have been looking for a (good) tuna noodle casserole for years. This is amazingly like the one of my Nana's that I remember so fondly! I did add a cup of sour cream and about 1/2 cup of chopped green olives so that it would be just as I remembered. I will be making this very often!

I'm preggo and had a MAJOR craving for tuna noodle casserole yesterday, so I found this recipe and made it asap---I needed a recipe that didn't call for cream of mushroom soup because there was no time to run out to get some - I needed the casserole ASAP!   It was really good - but I used 1/2 the butter that it called for and left off the topping and cheese to cut out some of the fat and calories.  The only other modification that I thought it needed was double the tune...but that could be my pregnant craving for tuna talking!

I would add a little more liquid next time, other than that, the flavor was great.  Added a few shakes of garlic powder over the top before going into the oven.

Excellent!!  I haven't had or made tuna casserole in years, but this was perfect!  The last 5 minutes of baking, I added french onions to the top, but I did not add onions to the original mixture.  Was great!!!  Will definately make again!

We really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I will do next time is add milk like others suggested, because it was a little dry. Other than that great recipe!

Not a bad meal when you're in a hurry. I did change it a little like some of the other reviewers. I used the canned young peas instead of frozen, used 1 can of the mushroom soup and 1 cup of sour cream. I used an 8X8 casserole dish, and it wasn't dry at all. No complaints, and there wasn't anything leftover!

Made this for I and my sweetie, she loves tuna... And this was a hit for us.. I did take the advice of other reviews and added and subtracted from the original. I went with the two cans of mushroom soup, and a can of cheddar cheese soup, about 1/4 milk and lil bit of mayonnaise about 1/4 cup or less. I took out the onions and used both croutons and some left over chips. The croutons definitely give it a bit more crunch, Next time I make this I will try waiting until the dish is almost done baking before adding the chips. I have found this one recipe that be adjusted to ones taste, and I don't think you can go wrong with it.

This recipe was good, just not what Im used to. My mother has her own recipe that she made while I was growing up and it had a totally different taste.  Here is my Moms recipe that I preferred over this one:  1 large bag of egg noodles 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom 2 cans of tuna 1/2 & 1/2  Milk Mrs. Dash Salt and pepper Garlic powder Potato chips  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Boil noodles for 8-10 minutes until al dente. Drain, and put cooked noodles back into stock pot.   Add 1/2 & 1/2, fill stock pot half way up the noodles. Add milk the rest of the way until just about covering the noodles.   Add seasoning and mix well (you can be generous with the seasoning). Cover stock pot and uncover when half way done to get the top of the noodles crispy. Bake for 1 and 1/2 hours.  When done, let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. Add crushed potato chips to the top of your individual serving.

This was a great recipe, my kids loved it! I did use the extra soup, but i used cream of celery and a half cup of buttermilk to keep it from becoming to dry. I also put most the cheese in the mix and just a little on top with a three cheese bread crumb. Thanks for the recipe idea!!!

I modified it slightly, as I feared it would be a little dry.  Added approx 1/2-2/3 c sour cream along with the soup, and I topped the casserole with 1/2 cup french fried onion rings and 1/2 cup potato chips instead of only chips.  We all gave it a "thumbs up!"

This is excellent comfort food! My husband raved about the recipe. The amount of tuna is perfect, not overwhelming like others. When I make this again I will probably add a little more cheese and soup to the mixture. So easy too, dump and bake!

I notice that the recipe has been changed to show 2 cans of mushroom soup and I heartily agree. With one can it was just too dry and I think that the second can will make all the difference. I see this becoming a staple recipe in our house...especially when we have the bottom of a chip bag to use up, lol. :) Even with it being dry, the pickiest eater in the house went back for seconds...my jaw almost hit the floor, as he Never does that. Thanks JAICARD! :)

Good, simple, quick and easy! I wanted to make a hearty meal for 5 hungry adults and made these changes: increased the cream of mushroom soup to 3 cans, increased the tuna to 3 cans, used a whole can of mushrooms, and used a little more than a cup of frozen peas and carrots. Baked at 375 for 25 minutes. It was very moist and very filling! Would definitely make it again!

Great baseline recipe.  I added 1/2 cup sour cream, increased the chopped onion to 1/2 cup, and used a mix of Cheddar and Monterrey Jack cheeses (probably 1 cup total).  Also, I used only one can of Cream of Celery soup and topped with French's fried onions.  Finally, I added about a tsp of celery seeds and salt.  Next time I'll add a little milk to increase the creaminess, but overall a great start.

this is awesome! however, i made some changes. i add the family size can of mushroom cream as i don't like dry tuna casserole. i omit the sliced mushrooms, i add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and pepper. i didn't have potato chips handy so i added bread crumbs instead with a little bit of french's fried onion. it came out delicious! my husband loves it!

I liked this, but I think the onions need to be cooked before adding them to the casserole.  Otherwise they are way too crunchy and overpower the dish.

This is good tuna casserole... for what it is. I'm not a fan of using processed stuff in my recipes, but I had some cans to use up.  I added 1/4 soup can of water and used bread crumbs instead of chips for topping. Also used other suggestions and baked in a smaller baking dish. Overall, very easy, very quick, and great tasting.

Although I wasn't too sure about the tuna, with a few modifications I made, as I didn't have some of the ingredients, the casserole came out really good!!! I added milk as otherwise it would have came out too dry. I also added 2 tbsp of sour cream, 1/4 tspn of cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup of canned whole kernel corn, and the onion that the recipe called for, I sauteed it prior to adding it to the mix and also added 2 tbsp of butter. I fried thin sliced potatoes as I didn't have any potato chips, and also added some Southwestern style browned hash browns on top, before adding the second cup of cheddar cheese. In the future, I would add some salt and pepper and see how it comes out.

This is an excellent, easy, cheap, family-friendly recipe! I made it for dinner last night and it went over very well. I was out of egg noodles, so I used 12 oz. of elbow macaroni instead.  I also skipped the mushrooms, because my family doesn't care for them. Other than that, I made it exactly as written. It was delicious! The topping is what made it so yummy, I think. The only problem I had was the amount of servings this recipe is supposed to make...we got more like 8-10 servings rather than 6. Thanks so much for sharing...this one is going in our regular rotation!!!

As written, this recipe is too dry and bland for my taste hence the 3 stars.  On my second go around I sauted the onion in a TSP of oil with a clove of garlice before adding to the mixture.  I also added a 1.5 cup of milk,  a few dashes of fresh ground black pepper and used buttered wheat bread crumbs instead of chips on top.  Much better results!

Good old fashioned tuna casserole. Not the healthiest (pretty high calorie content), but one of those things worth splurging for.

I did not find this dry as others did. It was a hit with the family. The only thing I will do differently next time is saute the unions.

Very mediocre, even with a little miracle whip and personal spices added. Would definitely avoid chip topping, doesn't save for leftovers well.

I'm not a big fan of tuna casserole and made this per my family's request.  We all loved it - even me.  I tweaked just a little: added less onion (for kids) but then used onion powder and garlic powder, used Italian bread crumbs instead of potato chips, and added a splash of milk (due to some reviews saying it was dry).  It came out great.

My family is quite skeptical about tuna casseroles, but this one put their fears to rest. The combination of the soups and cheese made a lovely casserole that didn't have that overwhelming tuna flavor that so often comes with a tuna casserole. Make the recipe just as is...it works!

Eh, it was fine. I followed some of the other instructions and added some extra milk, and I still thought it was a bit dry. Mostly it was too bland for me, I felt like there wasn't enough flavor in it.

I threw in some water chestnuts for texture. I liked the added crunch. I also left off the potato chips, as I didn't have any. I think I prefer the water chestnuts to the potato chips, though. Better for you...

Yummy! My whole family loved this recipe! I left out the can of mushrooms, since my husband is not a big fan of them. Added about a 1/4 cup of milk since other reviews state the recipe is dry. It turned out wonderful!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is my first time making a review... I absolutely love this recipe!  I make this recipe at least once a month!  You can use different types of pasta and add any kind of veggies your heart desires.  I usually add a bit more cheese!  Thanks for this amazing recipe!

This is almost the same as the recipe that my family has been using for years, and it's a good simple staple. My mother always used cream of mushroom soup, but I found that substituting cream of chicken for half (or even all) of it adds some good flavor; 1 large can of cream of chicken and 1 small can of cream of mushroom is my favorite combo, and adds a little extra moisture. Egg noodles are good, but other kinds of pasta work too (garden rotini is nice). I like crumbled sour cream and onion Pringles on mine (there's something about the texture that I like, even though I don't normally like Pringles), but my husband prefers Italian bread crumbs. Both are good. I've never included onion and cheese but I think I will next time because it sounds like a good addition.

I made half the recipe and it was perfect for an 8 x 8 casserole dish.  I sauteed the onion and added some celery as well.  I did add about 1/2 cup of milk to avoid dryness as others suggested.  I thought the potato chips on top were great-but the extra cheese on top was a little too much maybe.  Great casserole!

Really good base recipe - I made the following alterations:  added a can of baby shrimp, added a can of cheddar cheese soup, added a splash of milk, skipped the potato chips, and I used shell pasta rather than egg noodles.  Delish...I'm hoping my 3 year old will try it for lunch today!

Quite good. Very easy to pull together. My only change to the recipe was that I added frozen peas with carrots, not just peas. I will say that this recipe makes a lot of food, much more than what I would call 6 servings. I think if you cut it in half it would easily feed a family of four. As is, I have an enormous chunk left over. I would probably use less egg noodle as well, just for my own taste.

I followed the recipe exactly for the first time trying it.  My husband and I thought is was good but not great.  I thought it needed a little something else but I'm not sure what. The potato chips do give it a nice crunch though.  I will try this again using some of the tips posted on this site.

I went into this hesitantly because hubby is no fan of casseroles and my teenage son would run if he heard the word "tuna", so nobody knew 'what' was for dinner.  I placed it on the table, served it up, and it was hit with everyone and I know I'll make this again.

Great casserole! I even seriously botched the recipe and it still turned out great LOL. I didn't have enough onion, forgot the mushrooms, was going to go by someone elses review and add extra cream of mushroon soup but forgot to pick some up so used a cream of chicken i had in the cupboard and just as i had put it in the oven i realized i forgot to put the tuna in LOL! So stirred in the tuna and re-added the cheese and chip topping LMAO! Sooo off my game today :) Thanks for sharing!

This was well enjoyed by the tuna eaters. Made serving for 9 with 16oz bag pasta and 12x15 pan. Will put top cheese on at the end of baking next time -- too brown.

Really good!  Next time I will saute the onions before combining with the other ingredients.  Make sure to put the remaining cheese on before the potato chips.  Melts better and doesn't make the chips soggy.

It really is the best. But I use a whole pound of peas and carrots and two cans of soup. I like to use a can of mushroom soup and a can of cream of chicken. Sometimes extra cheese, because extra cheese is always good. Otherwise its perfect.

This was good, easy, comfort food - but I did have to make a few minor adjustments.  I had to add one can of cheese soup and a cup of milk, otherwise it would have been too dry.  I also added some season salt and garlic.  It probably could have used another small can of tuna...

This was very good. I didn't have any chips..so I skipped and I added a whole 4 oz can of mushrooms. It turned out great. Both kids who claim to 'hate' mushrooms didn't even notice they were in there and cleaned their plates. This will become a staple at our house. Thanks!

I used one can cream of mushroom and one can cream of celery. Ruffles potato chip, mushrooms, peas just as receipe states. Added fresh ground pepper. It was great!

I used one can of cream of mushroom and one cream of celery. I added milk, as it was looking dry, like others suggested. I used good tuna, good frozen peas, Lay's potatoe chips. No onions or mushrooms, but added onion powder and garlic salt.  I hated it. It was very fishy, my husband liked it, but thought the cheese was too hard on top (I didnt burn it). Our company added more cheese while eating it and salt and pepper. I guess I am too snobby for Tuna Casserole, my mother and grandmother never made it, now I see why...

This recipe was totally bland!  I did add an extra 1/2 c. of milk to the original recipe and baked for 15 minutes, so the casserole was nice and moist.  But to make this recipe truly wonderful, you MUST: saute those onions and mushrooms first, throw in a clove or two of garlic, and add at least 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper.  I couldn't even taste the tuna in this casserole, so I would add another can of tuna as well!  Casserole out of a box has more flavor than this recipe as is.

Great quick fix when you're tired of chicken.  I used dried onions instead of potato chips.

I thought this wasn't bad for a quick and easy dinner. But next time I am going to add less noodles and more veggies, because it was a little dry for my taste. But overall it's a great way to make a fast supper :)

Very good, but didn't use potato chips and cut back on cheese a little to save some fat cals. Will make again. Oh, and used shell pasta and added 1/2 cup milk.

I also have used small pasta such as elbows and shells for this recipe and yes I aways add a bit of milk and grate the onion instead of chopping it since the onion will not cook properly. I also prefer it without the canned mushrooms and add extra peas and use french fried onions on top.  Basic and Good recipe for a quick meal.

This was good, but I didn't like the onions or that it was dry.  The onions didn't get done in the time it cooked.  I did add 1 cup milk and about 3/4 cup sour cream, but it was not enough.  The taste was good and it made plenty.

Yep.  This the way mom made it and I love it.  The ingredients should be staples in the pantry and it is quick and easy to make.  Try it, You'll like it!  Just like me, you will probably tinker with the recipe to suit your taste, but it would be hard to improve this recipe.  Right mom?

It's hard for me to rate this because I didn't follow the recipe to a "T"...but it still came out alright, so I said, "why not? I mixed up all the ingredients and found that I was lacking in cream of mushroom soup - instead I substituted a can of creamed corn and found that it served the same purpose. With the addition of a 1/4 of milk, the casserole was creamy goodness. Not bad for an end of the week meal with the left-overs from the cupboard :)

This was okay. It was really easy and quick, but thanks to some other reviews, I added about 1 c. of milk. If I had't of done that, it would have been VERY dry.  It was a little bland.  I think with a little work, this could be a great recipe, but if you make it as is, it is just okay.

To the recipe, it was a little dry. Great flavor and easy to prepare. I will add sour cream next time. I omitted the peas and added a whole can of mushrooms. Love the potato chip and cheese topping.

I followed the recipe as written, but took the advice of other reviewers and baked it in a 2qrt casserole rather than a 9x13.  It was perfect.  I had been craving tuna casserole and this fit the bill perfectly.

I Was Pleasently Suprised With This Tuna Casserole. Was  Very Tasty.  I Did Take Some Advice From Other Reviews,  And I Added 1 1/2 cups of milk,  3 cups of cheese, 18 oz of White Albacore Tuna, Bow Ties Pasta, Mixed Vegtables. I Will Make This Again. It Made More Then I Had Thought. Nice Recipe And  Change.

Very good - easy, fast and tasty. I added a couple tablespoons of mayo the second time I made this - it helps with the consistency, I think. Sauteed the chopped onion with fresh mushrooms (not canned) before adding to the other ingredients.

EXCELLENT!  My super picky husband had 2 huge helpings!  Cooked it in a casserole dish rather than 9x13 pan as past reviewers suggested to avoid drying out. Added one extra can of soup to help with drying out issue, will add an additional can for a total of 4 cans next time.  It didn't turn out dry with 3 cans, but it could have been a tad creamier.  YUM!

L-O-V-E love it! Absolutely delish. Here's what I changed: shells instead of egg noodles, 3 cans of soup, whole can of mushrooms, 1 cup velveeta cubed (instead of 2 cups cheddar), and crispy french onions (instead of chips). I think the last two things really made the difference. Everyone loves it!

I've never had tuna casserole before so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought it was awful. It came out really, really dry and I even added a can of milk to the recipe. Sorry but this is just not good.

This is my 14 yr old sons favorite dish! I use a whole box of Spiral noodles and 3 cans of mushroom soup with 3 cans of tuna and bake it in a huge baking dish with extra cheese melted on top. If you've ever fed a teenager you'll understand. He usually has it gone by day 2 and eats it right out of the baking dish. I only get one bowl, he hogs it ALL! Hahaha, at least he doesn't complain!

This recipe was OK, but we still feel it is missing something.  It maybe needs more seasonings.  I will have to make it again and do some tweaking.

To keep the casserole from becoming dry add milk.  When ever Im makinig a casserole involving cream soups, I usually add about a half cans worth per can of soup used.  Just enough to help thin the soup but not make it runny.  My picky kids loved this receipe so I will be making it agian.

This was a super good recipe!  I did up the soup an extra 1/2 can and the moisture was fantastic!  Flakes of turkey instead of tuna make for a great alternative for "picky" kids who are resistant to tuna.

I made this following the directions with one exception. I did not add mushrooms based on my kids dislike of them.  Overall, we did enjoy this and it was very easy.  I meant to add an extra can of soup and forgot. It was a tad dry so the next time I make this I will add another can and it should be just perfect then!  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty yummy!  I appreciated how easy the recipe was to follow and it was fun to make with basic recipes.  Why can't all recipes be this easy with good results?  :)

Really very good. It tastes just like my mom makes, except without the added mystery of what else is in it! JK JK...like another reviewer suggested, I added an extra can of soup (Cheddar Cheese), and I think it would have been way to dry without it.

Great recipe.  I didn't find it too fry, but I did use a larger oval casserole dish vs a 9 x 13.  Next time I make it I am going to omit the potato chips, and use bread crumbs.  The potato chips fizzled and tasted stale by the time they came out of the oven.  I also cooked the onions separately until they were translucent, then added them to the casserole, to make sure they weren't crunchy.  The taste was good, and we enjoyed the dish.

yummy! easy! instead of using a separate bowl to mix the ingredients i mixed right in the casserole dish. less dishes to wash! i added a can of cream of celery soup since that's what i had in the pantry as well as french fried onions on the top instead of chips. 2 out of 3 kids liked it!

I changed the noodles to small shell pasta.  Added 1 cup sour cream to keep it from being dry and not taste so "fishy", and added 3 cloves garlic chopped fine.  Also doubled the chips... was DELICIOUS!!!

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I omitted the mushrooms and peas and forgot to add the onions.  I cut the recipe in half and used a can of cream of chicken.  Everything turned out great and the leftovers tasted just as good as the day before. Only a tad bit dry but still very good.

I read the reviews stating that this recipe can come out dry so I added about 1/2 C. soy milk(I'm lactose intolerant). I imagine just mild would be fine. Came out great in my 9x13 pan, nice and moist. It's a wonderful budget recipe.

I so appreciate comments others have made.  This recipe - as a base - is a very good one.  I created a hybrid from comments others have made and created a delicious casserole last evening.  I used an 18 oz bag of noodles, two cans of creme of mushroom soup, one can of cheddar cheese soup and a half cup milk.  Mixed with 3 - 6 oz cans of tuna, peas, shredded cheese, etc.  I topped it with crumled potato chips and a little of the shredded cheese and baked for 40 minutes because I used a deeper casserole dish.  All this to say that I cannot wait to have the leftovers today. It was a great base recipe and i hope to try the canned asparagus spears on another winter weekend in this hearty, satisfying dish.

Just your standard, basic tuna casserole. However, it IS pretty good and even better the next day warmed up. I sauteed my onions so they wouldn't be crunchy.

This was an average recipe. I had added garlic powder, cayanne pepper, fresh cracked pepper for added taste. Seemed it would be bland without it. I used a 26oz can of cream of mushroom and almost a cup of milk and it still was not creamy enough. It was all absorbed by the noodles. Next time I will use another can.

A recipe worthy of its name!  This was hands down the BEST tuna casserole I have ever made.  I only had one can of cream of mushroom so I substituted one can of cream of celery for the second can.  I didn't have canned mushrooms so I had to leave them out.  Delicious!!

This was great!!! My husband and my kids loved it. I left out the extra mushrooms though. I also just bought an individual bag of potato chips at the gas station, and it worked perfectly. Would for sure make this again.!!

Good however, the potato chips made it taste a bit greasy. Instead, I use crushed buttery basked crackers like Town Hose. Really tasty and a keeper!

This recipe is tasty and very versatile. 
I used one "Family sized" mushroom soup and added some milk. Also, I used fresh mushrooms and 1 can of spicy tuna. I also added about an additional 1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots. Turned out great!

My mom used to make this, so I decided to try this version.  My family really liked it, but I would recommend lessening the amount of cheese placed on top and maybe more in the casserole itself.  It had a tendency to just peel off and my children ended up just eating the cheese that was cooked on top!

This is not a recipe for young picky eaters. The onions was a bad idea. My kids rejected this in two bites also. I thought it was good, though. So for adults who like onions I would say it was good.

I did add a little extra milk to make it easier to stir although I wonder if you use the low fat soup, you might not need to.  This was your basic tuna noodle, quick, easy, and tasty.

I was looking for a recipe to "guide" me with the ingredients I had on hand.  What I came up was delicious, so I thank this recipe!!!  I only had one can of soup and since people were saying it turned out dry, I added some mayo and some mustard to the bowl.  I used rotini noodles and used someone's suggestion of the butter/breadcrumbs because I didn't have chips.  It was delicious.  Thanks again!

Very good tuna casserole.  Easy and quick to make and tastes great.  I replaced the potato chips w/ Ritz crackers and made it just a bit better.  Try it and you'll love it....especially w/ the Ritz!

Well, I have to say I was skeptical...baked canned tuna didn't sound good, but my boyfriend insisted we try it. It was ok. Now, I do change a few things. First I use a low sodium soup. Second, I use bread crumb with a little metled butter instead of potatoe  chips and last, I leave the veggies frozen until I bake it.

This was very good! I didn't find it to be too dry at all. My only complaint was that the onions were very crunchy even after baking the casserole. Next time I will saute them beforehand.

This recipe was quite good. It was definitely what I was looking for! I did add a 1/4 cup of sour cream and a packet of onion soup mix--omitting the fresh onion. One packet was too much, so next time I'll use half--but  we all loved the taste and the texture was create.  I also used sea shell pasta instead which made it a bit more hearty. Two thumbs up! Thanks!

This recipe was just okay for us. Not bad, but not the best. I thought I'd really like the potato chip topping but prefer the french fried onion topping I've tried before. However, we are eating the leftovers and the flavor seems to have improved some. Thanks.

a very easy recipe! I happened to have all the required ingredients today and managed to whip up the meal in 1/2 hour or so. Quite a large helping though... I wonder if it's possible to freeze it in batches, like those supermarket ready-mades...

I don't eat tuna but made this a few Friday's ago for lent.  I did not taste it, but my husband liked it.  He even took the rest to work with him the next day and got a lot of compliments.  The only thing I changed is that I did add milk and I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.

This was pretty good. I halved the recipe (as there are only two of us) and I added approx half a soup can (sorry, didn't really measure, just kind of dumped)of milk to the mixture to cut down on the dryness that others mentioned. This was about perfect. Next time though, I will saute the onions first as they are not in the oven long enough to cook, so they were still raw and crunchy.

A good basic recipe that needs additional seasoning like paprika or garlic powder. I might try this again but will add more to it so it doesn't taste so much like the mushroom soup.

I made this recipe for my husband the other night it was great even he did have very much to complain about it. I used crackers instead of potato chips because I didn't have any chips. Other than that I didn't change anything. A real comfort food that I remember from childhood.

Missing the tuna casserole my mom use to make I decided to try this one.  Reading some other reviews and remembering that my mom used a lot more soup then this recipe required I decided to add in the chedder cheese soup someone reccommended and I also used pilmentos as reccommended by someone else, and another can of tuna.  

I thought it was pretty boring tasting, not the flavorful comfort casserole I remember from my mom.  Although my husband said it was good I dreaded the leftovers the next day.  My daughter also would not eat it.  I will not be making this particular recipe again.

I had no egg noodles so I made it with shells and left out mushrooms (for my daughter).  Topped with white chedder Cheez-Its.  Used 1/2 the amount of cheese and it was low fat Cabot white cheddar and a little fresh grated parm.  We all loved it.  If it weren't for watching my calories I'd have eaten 3 times what I did!!

I thought I'd try a different tuna casserole recipe, since I've been using my mom's forever. I resisted all urges to add ingredients to this, made it as written. It was okay, kind of bland and boring (not that tuna casserole is all that exciting to begin with). I think even adding about a 1/4 cup of ranch dressing would give it the zip it needed.

This recipe DESPERATELY needs either another can of soup or a can of milk mixed in with the two cans of soup.  It was extremely dry.  Good flavor and super yummy topping but in need of more moisture.

VERY GOOD, except I agree with other reviewers, that the onion needs to be pre-cooked or it isn't done(soft). I liked that a 9 x 13 was used at a higher temp, so it didn't take as long as some casseroles. But be careful not to over-bake, it dries out easily/ fast!. Just bake until heated through. I opted to use frozen mixed veggies instead of just peas(just pre cooked a little in the noodle pan with a little butter AND I added a little milk to make it creamier. I didn't have the chips on hand, so I just crushed some "buttery" (Ritz type)crackers with the cheese to top. Will make again,  with my changes.

This was reminicent of Tuna Casserole my hubby had as a child. He said it had everything really good in it and had 2 helpings or more.
I didn't have the mushrooms so I omitted those. Hubby doesn't like peas so I increased the potato chips by 3x - added a mix of cheddar and mozz cheese since I ran out of cheddar. And I didn't pay any attention to how much onion I actually put in - I am sure it was nmore like 3/4 cup of white onion. But it smelled soooo good when cooked. It reheated awesome. I added this to my recipe box and will be maing thios once a week.

I thought this was pretty good! I took the advice of other users and added the can of milk. It didn't come out dry at all. I also added salt, pepper, and garlic salt to taste. If I didn't add the milk and seasoning, I think this would've been bland. I also added an extra can of tuna. Next time I might even use 4 cans. So if you're planning to try this recipe out, be sure to add your own seasoning and some milk or else it won't turn out good!!

This recipe is better than Tuna Helper, but still seems so bland.  Is canned tuna this hard to enhance?  I also added an extra can of tuna, can of cream of mushroom, 1/2 can of peas...still not the greatest I think a casserole can be.  Will try something else next time.

This wasn't horriable but also not great. I did as others suggested, added milk, and sauteed the onions and fresh mushrooms. It still seemed a little bland and needs a little more spice.  Celery might be good.  Will try again but play around with the ingredients.

This is a really good meal. I will put carrots, broccoli, peas, and corn in next time. I used pasta, but will use wide egg noodles next time.
It was very flavorful and even better the next day. My husband really liked it for lunch the next day. 
A great weeknight dinner.

I used whole wheat pasta, fat free cheese, light potato chips, light cream of mushroom, and no mushrooms.  My husband loved it and my 17 month old had 3 helpings.  I'd say this is going to be made again!

It was really tasty although next time I'll probably only use 1 cup of shredded cheese to sprinkle on top and I won't use the second cup of cheese to mix in with the casserole. That's just a lot of cheese.

This was very good--my picky husband, and even pickier kids loved it.  I think the crushed potato chips and melted cheese on top make it more appealing, especially to for the young ones.

I made this for my family tonight. It was delicious and the tuna taste was not overwhelming, which is important for my picky eaters. It was a hit and I will be making it again for sure:)

In the minority here, we really didn't care for this recipe. It was dry and bland. Sure, tuna casserole isn't supposed to be chock full of flavor, but we felt like something was missing with this recipe.

Great recipe! My family loved it and all took seconds!  I had no plain chips in the house, so I subbed Ritz crackers.  Still tasted great! Thanks!

Yummy :)  I made changes, like everyone else. I did not use cheese, but I added a can of milk and lots of salt and pepper.  I topped the casserole with crushed Cheese Nips instead of chips which was delicious!

I made this last weekend.Instead of the potato chips I used plain white crackers
crumbled to top the casserole off.I added a little garlic too.

My boyfriend loved it,so did I.I loved the peas and the cream of mushroom/celery also.

Thanks.

I made a few modifications for health reasons: used whole wheat macaroni instead of egg noodles, used half fat cream of mushroom soup, left out the potato chips and used the whole can of mushrooms. I also added 1/2 can of milk like others suggested. It turned out great. Will definately make it again.

This recipe was okay.  Just okay - I thought it was a bit too thick and lacked something - the taste was bland.  I added some milk to try to thin it out and create a more creamy consistency - added dill for more flavor, omitted the chips. Sorry but this recipe wasn't what I was looking for.

I made this for dinner the other night for company.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The only thing I did differently was put a full box of frozen peas in which is almost two cups and did not add the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like.  I had lots of compliments on this, and the best compliment was all the boys/men having 2nds and 3rds!

I usually dont like seafood of any kind, but thought that I would try out something different.  I was was surprised that I liked this recipe so much.  I took the comments into consideration and added a little milk and it turned out perfect.  I will make this again.

Having not grown up on traditional American classics, I found this recipe when my husband started begging me to make him a tuna casserole.  For the very first time in our marriage, he said he liked mine better than his mom's!!!!! "Best Tuna casserole" is appropriately named!

I liked this but I made it for 25 people and it was alittle dry with the amounts that allrecipes kicked the quantities up to. I believe I would add a milk of some sorts to give more moisture to it.

Only added 1/2 cup milk, and it turned out great!  This is the first time I've made tuna casserole and used a recipe.  I'd almost given up making it because it never got finished by my husband and me.  I hated throwing out half a casserole.  Never will that happen again!

Delicious!  I have nothing bad to say about this recipe.  I used one can of regular cream of mushroom and one can of cr/o/m w/roasted garlic.  I did add about 1/2 can of milk to make it looser.  My chips burned, but I also used a toaster oven to cook, and that is probably why.  If you do that, keep a lid on it.  I will make again for sure.

I am so glad I now have a tuna casserole recipe I really like!

Only changes I made were to use frozen peas and carrots instead of just the peas, and the chips on top were Cheddar and Sour Cream flavor.  This was delicious!  I was shocked that the 2 cans of soup was just right.  I feel it would have been too watery with milk added.  For a 2nd try I think I would add a little pepper!

Very tasty!  The crunchy potato chip topping really makes this dish something special.  The only changes I made: used canned peas instead of frozen b/c that's all I had on hand, also added a can of carrots..yum yum!  Big hit with my family!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing this one!

Very good.  My son 8 year old son loved it so much, he barely left any- and what he did leave he ate the next day at lunch.  Delish.  Will definately make again.

Very good casserole. I did add about half a soup can of milk because it seems like it needed to be thinned down a little. Everyone loved the potato chip and cheese topping.

This was a good recipe.  I'm not a HUGE fan of tuna (canned tuna), however, this was a quick and easy meal which yielded plenty of leftovers.

I made some changes to mine. I omitted the onion, and put all the cheese in the mix *that was an accident*, I used a family sized mushroom soup instead of the two cans and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. For the potato chips I used cheddar sour cream *mainly because those were the only ones opened when I made the recipe* Realizing I used all the cheese in the mixture I grabbed my mexican cheese blend from the fridge *bought for enchilidas the next night* It gave it a bit of a kick, really yummy!

This was pretty good, but not the best I have tasted. I doubt I will make this one again.

My kids love this dish.   I think it is ok.  I like that it is easy to make.  I have made some changes.  I omit the onion.  I put all of the cheese in the mixture.  I use broccoli instead of peas.  I add a dash of cayanne, pepper and garlic powder.  I also add a cup of milk.

It was all right...I did omit the potato chips, used fresh mushrooms, canned peas, and 1 can cream of celery instead of 2 cans cream of mushroom.  It tasted fine, but not exactly a new favorite.  Lacks flavor.

This was a quick, good casserole.  My husband loved it, but he didn't like the chips in top.  He says it would be better with melted cheese on top.

Nice change of pace from chicken.  Never made tuna casserole before.  I give the dish a 3, it tasted good, but not something I would normally eat, nor did my kids care for it.  My husband on the other hand gives it 4 stars.  He says it's very nostalgic because he used to eat this in his MRE (meal-ready-to-eat)at 6AM in the Marine Corp when he was out in the field.  But says this version tastes much better.  I will make again, but only when he requests it.

It was not as creamy as I was hoping it would be, but it still was pretty good. I would make this again, but maybe try adding some milk to it.

Very good.  Flavors were great.  Not cooking the onion before putting in the casserole leaves it some 'bite'.  Used fine bread crumbs instead of potato chips and was delicious.  Didn't have any mushrooms to add, but didn't miss them at all; the soup gives more than enough flavor.  However, it wasn't quite as good as a leftover.

I loved it.  My picky husband Liked it.  I also added celery and green pepper.  Instead of potato chips I used Italian style bread crumbs with ramano cheese in melted butter.

I made some easy variations to the recipe. I doulbed the mushrooms and added about 2/3 cup of reduced fat sour cream. It made it very creamy. It's the best tuna casserole I've ever made and the family loves it!
