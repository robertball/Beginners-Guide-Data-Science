I made this with a few changes because I personally can't handle the "heat" of chili powder, so I some adjustments by using Paprika, garlic powder, and cumin. It was awesome, little strong on the Worceshire flavor but most of my family really liked it. I gave it 5 stars because the only family member that didn't like it was one that doesn't like any kind of marinade or sauce on his steak with the exception of a little salt and pepper.
