My husband was talking about how he wanted an ice cream sandwich in the worst way. No money until payday but in searching this site for a comparable recipe, I came across this. I made this lighter using "light" whipped topping and sugar free CHEESECAKE instant pudding. I also used cinnamon graham cracker squares. My youngest child and I had the best time assembling these, sneaking little bites of the filling now and then......so we really only got 12 "sandwiches. This recipe was cake and though it wasn't a true "ice cream sandwich", my husband enjoyed it all the same, as did the rest of us. Great summer treat recipe.

Everyone seemed to like these.  I think if I were to make them again I'd add another small can of crushed pineapple for a stronger pineapple flavor.  I liked biting into the little chunks of frozen pineapple.  For 18 sandwiches, the filling is more like 3/4" thick.  I would suggest going with the thicker filling rather than making more sandwiches with the recommended amount of filling.  One taster suggested rolling the edges in coconut or toasted coconut for a more tropical flavor.  They are a little time consuming to fill, but if you're not going to eat them all at once, it's probably worth it to have a stock of them in your freezer ready to eat.

I converted this into a chilled pie by putting the filling into a graham crumb crust I made then chilling in the fridge. It was really good - you could probably freeze the pie as well and eat it frozen - very easy and yummy!

I wrote this recipe and wanted to mention it tolerates mandarin oranges in place of the pineapple really well.

These were tasty.  I ended up using all 3 packs of graham crackers in the box so I made a total of 24 sandwiches.  Unfortunately they were higher in calories than I thought they would be even using light Cool Whip and reduced fat graham crackers.  So everyone else gets to eat them but me.

I tried these and they are  great!  I will try a chocolate version with sugar-free pudding and mini-chocolate chips.  I did find that letting it chill a bit and was easier to spread and wrap.  I was not so crazy about pineapple but no problem.  a little extra vanilla and some cinnamon and a whole new flavor!

This is very good.  Made it exactly as printed.  I will make it again as soon as I can find a way to 1/2 the pudding.  It makes a lot of sandwiches.  I made only 18.  The balance of the mixture I plan to put into a pie shell.  Again thanks for posting this refreshing treat.

Great recipe, easy and fun to make. I had a bit of difficulty getting the consistency of the filling right so it was easy enough to spread, but not so melty that it dripped out of the cookies. I ended up blending the mixture then putting it back in the freezer for a day, then microwaving it the next day. I'm sure there was an easier way, but it all worked out in the end.  Oh and as other reviewers mentioned, the sandwiches dont really keep more then a week before the grams get soggy.
