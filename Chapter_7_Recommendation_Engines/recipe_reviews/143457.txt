I wanted a dressing to complete a salad that was being served with a Mexican meal.  I threw together romaine, black beans, corn, green onion, tomatoes and crushed corn chips.  The dressing was just what I was looking for to complete our meal.  If you like lime you'll like this dressing.  Its fresh and full of flavor.  I will try it again with the addition of grilled chicken and cheese for a main dish.  yummy!

Really good! I normally don't use dried cilantro, but I tried it in this and really liked it - sort of how I like fresh basil and dried basil as different herbs altogether. I also thought the sweet-to-sour was right on for this - and the serving size is perfect (I cut the recipe in half). We had this on a spinach and red lettuce salad with red and green peppers and jicama. Nice! Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe at the last minute when I was serving salad and realized I had no dressing (except an old bottle of whatever in the back of the fridge...)  I had a few limes that needed to be used and found this to inspire me.  

It is YUM!  My husband loved it and I found myself sticking my finger in the bowl and eating it straight... (yes mom, I know I was brought up better than that - sorry!)

If you love lime - you'll love this dressing.

My husband and daughter liked it. I thought it had too much cumin. I would cut the cumin in half next time. Thanks!

Exactly what I was looking for and hoped it would taste like. Reduced olive oil to 1/4c. Made this to dress Chicken Fiesta Salad from this site.  Amazing .....and thanks!

I thought this was just ok.  Made it for supper club to go on salad paired with a southwestern style chili.  To me it was inconsistent.  Either it was a little bland or a very strong honey taste.  I shook it well each time, but the ingredients didn't blend as well.

Excellent! Didn't have cilantro, so made without. Dressed some mesclun greens. The tang of the lime/honey with the bitterness of the greens was sublime.

This was a great complement to our Margarita Salmon dinner last night. I cut the cumin to one teaspoon and used fresh cilantro. I made a salad with fresh broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes and red onions. Poured the dressing over my salad and let sit in the refrigerator for an hour or so to marinate. Topped with a few shreds of white cheddar cheese...ummm...ummm...good.

Light and refreshing. Nice change from other dressings. I was a little unsure about the dried cilantro, I usually prefer fresh ingredients, but it worked well.

Nice dressing, wouldn't change a thing about it.  It tastes fresh and tart (but not too tart) and is great for a side salad when you're planning a Mexican-style meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an interesting change of pace.  I would cut back on the cumin though.  I used fresh cilantro and I served it on a salad of spinach, tomatoes, avocado, and cheddar cheese.

This recipe was really awesome.  Very tender and juicy.  I did not have tequila mix, but substituted with 1/4 cup of frozen limeade (as opposed to lemonade).

This is just what I was looking for. I thought the bitterness of the fresh squeezed lime juice, the spiciness of the cumin, blended well with the sweetness of the honey.  However I did cut back a little on the honey.  I used fresh cilantro & it was DELICIOUS !!! I used this dressing over a flank steak salad & both my husband & teenage daughter loved it!!! Thanks for sharing.

This dressing is amazing!  In fact, I had more salad solely so I could have more dressing.  I served with with mixed baby greens, heavy on the arugula. I didn't have much fresh lime juice, but I did have non-alcoholic margarita mix, so I used that to fill in.  I also used fresh cilantro.  This will definitely be a staple for us!

Loved This! As others mentioned a cut back slightly, only 1 tsp cumin, and I used just over 2 tsp fresh, chopped cilantro. Amazing! I may try to substitute agave nectar for the honey next time, though, as I think it may complement the taste/texture better. Thanks for this lovely recipe!

I was so excited about this recipe!  Made it using fresh cilantro and skimped a bit on the cumin based on reviews.  It was delicious in the jar but when I put it on mixed lettuce, Campari tomatoes, avocado, green onion and roasted corn, it seemed very bland.  Next time I will use less olive oil to lime juice, at least as much cumin, a jalepeno ....  ?

This was pretty nice, and different - just a random recipe I tried. I made it exactly as written (using bottled lime juice, not fresh-squeezed), and it was very easy. I didn't actually have this with Mexican meals (just with simple salads for lunch), but I'm sure it would have paired nicely.

Excellent, I did what one of the reviewers suggested and served over blanched broccoli florets, sliced fresh mushrooms, sliced red onion, and tomatoes.  Served with a green chili enchilada casserole and it was the perfect side.

I love this dressing!  I substituted fresh cilantro and it was absolutely delicious.  We poured it over a chicken and spinach salad for a fresh and light lunch.  Definitely a favorite in our house.

Love it!  I actually decided to try sweetener instead of honey to try to cut the carbs.  Both ways are awesome!

This was yummy yummy stuff. However, I would stay away from the dried cilantro as it just doesnt have the same flavor as the fresh stuff. I used fresh cilantro and marinated some sante fe style frozen veggies. We loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved the flavour.. but added 2 tsp balsamic vinager and 1/2 tsp garlic because it was a bit too sweet.
