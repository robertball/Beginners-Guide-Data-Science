Please note that the cooking time in the water bath is the square of the thickness.  Twice the thickness takes four times as long.  A 3/4" steak will be done in 40 to 60 minutes while a 1-1/2" steak will take 160 minutes to four hours.

I will try searing the meat first in the hope that searing will seal in more of the moisture.  I have been searing as the last step until now.

In any event my finding is that I can buy less expensive cuts and get very tender meats with my sous vide oven.

Perfect steaks -- every time!

For the first time I tried the sous vide cooking method with this recipe. I used 1 inch thick new-york strip loins, and maintained a constant temperature of 130 - 131 in my dutch oven.

I first seared the salt and pepper seasoned steaks in a pan with olive oil, then transferred them into a zip lock bag and immersed them for 2 hours and 15 minutes. I proceeded to sear and crust the steaks after the immersion time. 

While the steaks were a perfect medium rare, I felt they lacked the depth of flavour I was expecting. 

When it comes to steak, I could have pan fried these strip loins and let them rest for 10 minutes and achieved as good or better results than the 2.5 hours using this method. 

It was an interesting exercise, but not worth the time or effort in my opinion.

I tried this recipe, everyone loved it. My stovetop gets too hot so I got out my crock pot, put hot water in it got the seared put it in ziploc freezer bags and put it in the water, I didn't watch the temp very good and cooked it more than I would have liked to but it was great the meat was so tender and juicy.  Nezt time I will turn it down to warm after it gets up to 140 degrees.  Thank you for sharing this recipe

So I decided to make this recipe after seeing the video, turned out really good.  I warmed up water and put it in a pot, and after I grilled the meat (I used sirloin) I put three of them in a plastic bag and covered the warm water pot.  I left them in for close to 2 hours, grilled them and they turned out very juicy.  I didnt have mushrooms, but definitely would want to add them to this dish when I make them next time.

First of all, I have to say I was raised on a big commercial cattle ranch in Oklahoma.....have had steaks in Dallas, San Antone, KC, OKC, and everywhere in between.  Needless to say, I know a little about steaks. I tend to shy away from NY Strips because they tend to be a little tough, I prefer Rib Eye.  I followed this recipe exactly using my crockpot and these were the best NY Strips I have ever had.  The only thing I did different was for the final sear, I used my charcoal grill.  About a min, minute and a half per side, make sure you season them before the final sear.  I've never had those kind of Mushrooms (Wegmans carries them) but can't imagine having a steak in the future without them.  Overall, well worth the effort.  Once you put the steaks in the water, they don't need much tending.  To make it easy, experiment a few days in advance with your crockpot to maintain 131-135 degrees.  I put mine on warm and tilted the lid a bit....maintained 132ish.....thermometer is very important.  Don't get wound up over the time....it's not critical.....if it goes three hours, won't change anything.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I had a hard time keeping my water at 130 degrees so the meet was more cooked than I wanted. It browned so beautifully before and after the water bath. I used brown portabella mushrooms. The sauce was so good.  This was my first time doing sous vide.  The meal was awesome served with pesto zucchini .

There must be a thousand ways to cook a steak that will give equal or better results. The flavor was fine.  From all the hype, one would have expected a texture like prime rib. 
Nope.  It was just a steak.   Way too time consuming.   If i am going to spend that much time cooking a steak, it better be able to walk over and put itself on my plate!  Stick to your grills guys!  Thanks for the gravy John.

I've been sous vide cooking for a while now and absolutely love the technique. Perfect every time with almost no effort. We cook this way so often now that I bought a little sous vide "oven" from Costco that has a permanent place on our countertop. If you haven't cooked this way you owe it to yourself to try.

Very good, excellent sauce. I loved the idea of taking the juices from the Sous Vide bag and adding them back in; seems obvious but I don’t think I’ve seen that suggestion before and it definitely contributed to the taste. Only change is to try searing for only 1 minute per side at the end, as it was a bit overdone for me.

This recipe looks delicious! One thing I have been noticing about sous vide is you always end up with perfectly cooked meat. I'm looking into the right equipment to use for sous vide cooking method. Because I live in a small apartment, I was thinking the Paragon Induction Cooktop (http://bit.ly/Paragon1B). What do you find works best?

This was delicious! Though, if you like rarer steak I’d definitely lessen the cook time. I had two 1” steaks, weighing ~1.5lbs total, and cooked them for 2 hours @ 130F in a sous vide appliance. The cook ended up being medium, which was too done for our tastes. However, they were still delicious, so I’ll definitely be doing this method again; will just lessen the cook time. The mushroom sauce should not be dismissed! Yum!

This is an excellent way to cook a steak. I used an actual sous vide cooker and then finished it in a skillet. I rivals what I do on an outside grill and is easier than standing outside over a grill when it's 20 degrees. Thanks, Chef John!

Omg!!!! I never cook steak because  it never comes out right but this time they were perfect!!!!They were so tender and flavorful. I was so hungry and impatient that I took them out of the bag about 10 minutes early and they still came out great. Note that I wasn't  able to keep the heat at 130 F so most of the cook time it was at 140 and again it still came out great! It was worth the wait!!

This was a great experiment since I have been curious, but not ready to invest in a piece of equipment if it didn't work out.  I was able to maintain the temp of the water bath on my stove.  I used a large pot.  I have a simmer plate for my cooktop which  I believe helps distribute heat, even at a low temp.  I used 2 thermometers, a digital and just a regular one and it stayed very even.  My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that the meat was only warm after searing at the end.  It was a thick piece, but again, I consider this an experiment and would definitely do it again and adjust accordingly.

I made this for a birthday dinner. I have a new sous vide machine and was looking for a great recipe from a trusted source. I had the butcher cut up a whole beef tenderloin and used 6 steaks from the yield. I divided the steaks into 2 bags. The meat turned out perfectly medium rare. Unable to find clamshell mushrooms, I used sliced shiitake, which was successful. I served with risotto, steamed broccoli and a strawberry spinach salad. Thanks again, Chef John!  P.S. So glad my daughter thought to snap a pic! We were so excited to chow down on this, we almost forgot!

Made my own balsamic by using apple cider vinegar and sugar. Didn't use  mushrooms, but will try that next time. Added BBQ sauce to the sauce mixture and everyone said it was "incredible."

Excellent. I love Sous Vide cooking style. 

I made two 8 Oz Prime Beef Tenderloin and one Prime 12 Oz  New York Trip. 

I did mine Sous Vide in a cooler using remote BBQ thermometer and adding boiling water each time the temp dropped 1 degree. I cooked at 63 degrees Centigrade. I cooked them 2.5 hours. 

I seared mine in a super hot black iron frying pan with butter before serving. 

The Beef Filets came out  an incredible medium. The New York was at the bottom of medium well - a little too much. 

The steaks were fantastic. I'll be cooking like this again.
