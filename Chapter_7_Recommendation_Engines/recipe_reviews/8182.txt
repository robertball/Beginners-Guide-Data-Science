For dessert recipes that use ricotta, I have found that it's essential to have two things: 1)the very best quality ricotta, and 2)all excess moisture drained, using cheesecloth and a strainer. This will give your cannoli cream the texture you want. Just put cheesecloth, a few layers thick, into a strainer or colander, put your ricotta into it (make sure you have it in a bowl to catch the water), and let it drain for an hour or so in the fridge. You should get a nice, dense consistency to the ricotta.

This is a very impressive cake to serve to our friends who love the real cannoli!!   Everyone was quite impressed with the flavor and appearance.    I, too, found the filling to be a bit too runny so I sprinkled some white chocolate pudding (instant) into the mixture until it thickened to a spreadable consistancy.  This also gave it another dimension of flavor.  (I did the pudding "trick" the second time I made the cake.  The first time I increased the amount of cream cheese to 8oz which also helped--but the pudding "trick" works the best!!)   I'll definitely make this again and again.

This cake is absolutely wonderful. Everyone loves it and it makes a great presentation for special events. It is time consuming to put it together but it's not difficult and it's worth the effort. Although it's not a quick recipe, the directions are easy to follow.

good instructions.  recipe turned out just fine.  use metal utensils where requested.  do not stir in whites and flour, fold just until combined.  cake batter should look like yellow marshmallow cream.  try not to spend too much time spreading batter into jellyroll pan.  its ok if it is not perfect.  bake 10 mins and no more.  your dish towel should be more like pillow case material and not like a towel.  Brush the flavored sugar and liquor mixture lightly.  just enough to cover the cake.  you may have some juice left over.  not too tight on rolling it up.  i rolled mine up from the short side.  (end zone of a football field) ricotta should be full fat and not part skim.  you should strain the cheese by placing it in a small strainer then hover it over a bowl and cover the top with paper towel and place in fridge for as long as you can.  i prepped the cake with the cheese and left it in the fridge (rolled up) until the next day.  then added the whipped cream before serving.  (the cake takes up a lot of room in the fridge)  it was a fab desert.  thanks so much

I made this for a birthday at work.  It got oohs and ahhs!  In order to avoid the cake sticking problem other reviewers experienced; I didn't brush the liquor syrup on until AFTER the rolled cake had cooled and I unrolled it.  I also substituted cherry liquor for the orange liquor in the recipe, and almond extract for the vanilla.  I also did not experience my filling being too thin as others did.  This will be a regular on my "special event" dessert menu.

I would like to say that when I decided to made this cake, I was very excited.  I had a feeling that it would turn out perfect after reading all the great reviews about it.   But instead, I'm very disappointed.  After I wrapped the cake in the towel, and waited for it to cool for exactly 1 hour,  I gently unrolled it, and the middle of the cake stuck to the towel, which then made a hole in the cake.  I did use confectioners sugar before inverting it onto the towel, so I don't know what the problem was with the cake sticking.  And another thing was that the cannoli filling was not at all thick enough from sitting in the refrigerator by the time the cake had cooled for an hour.   It should have sat in the fridge for at least a couple of hours.  But, in the end, even when the cake did come out looking bad, I ripped the cake apart and put the pieces in dessert bowls, and poured the liquid cannoli filling on top.  It did taste good, so that's why i gave it one star.

I made this cake a week before Easter and froze it without the whipped cream frosting.  Instead of using cream cheese, I used 4 oz.(1/2c)of mascarpone cheese. I also chopped up 1/4c of shelled pistachio nuts and added them when I folded in the mini-chocolate chips to the filling.When I sweetened the whipped cream I also added 1/2 tsp of grated orange zest. I thawed the frozen cake the day before Easter in the Refrigerator and then frosted and garnished the cake on Easter morning. It sat in a cooled garage, covered for three hours before serving, and it was a big hit. My Son-in-Law said it was "absolutely delicious".  I will make this again, and maybe add drained, paper-towel dried, and chopped-up maraschino cherries to the filling also, then it will really taste like my Grandma's Cannoli filling. Thanks for the great recipe! P.S. They have asked me to make it again when Family comes into town at the end of April. I know this will be a crowd favorite for years to come!

I actually enjoyed the cake.  It was not easy to make, but I thought the end product looked great! I was disappointed when no one at the party seemed to enjoy it.  I followed the recipe very carefully, but I would recommend making sure that the crowd you serve it to enjoys cannolis or they might not be too impressed.

I used the filling and frosting from this recipe to make a standard cannoli cake. It was delicious! I made two regular round white cakes and filled it with the cannoli filling and topped with the the whipped cream. Perfect for those who are used to the more tradition cannoli cake and don't have time to make the jelly roll. My only suggestion would be to at least double the whipped cream frosting recipe. I actually tripled it since there is more surface to cover on a 9" round cake. I will definitely be making this again.

I wanted to make cannoli for a desert, but didn't have the molds, so I decided to try this instead. I also only had a toaster oven to work with at the time, so I made the cake in two 9" round tins. The cake is delicious, no matter how you make it. You will need more cream to frost a layer cake.

This is a fantastic recipe!!  I had a slice of a cannoli cake from an Italian restaurant that is 2 hours from my home.  I immediately knew I'd need to find a recipe for it because of the drive.  This is it!!!  I went to the local Italian market for ricotta.  One of the owners said to use Whole milk ricotta, not the part skim which is what they use for their cannolis.  Part skim is for lasagna.  I followed another reviewers tip to drain the ricotta cheese.  I think next time, I would roll it out on the short side, to get a better cake to filling ratio, or try rolling the cake around a rolling pin to cool (another tip from another recipe).  I also used regular size chocolate chips that I processed in a food processor. I liked the shavings of chocolate throughout.  I also used the heavy cream that is not ultra pasturized, from Trader Joes.  Very nice cake, and very satisfying!!!

This cake is fantastic!  I food-process the chocolate chips in the filling to give it a smoother consistency--not only does it give it a better flavor (you're not always biting into chunks of chocolate), but it also thickens the filling a bit which keeps it from running out the sides.

This was very good.  I used all ricotta cheese and omitted the cream cheese and chilled it to thicken. I sprinkled the roll with cinnamon for a little extra flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Making this desert is not child's play, but oh what a result!  I found that using more confectioners' sugar helps some with the cake sticking to the towel, but once it is frosted, even that is not an issue.  If you want something that is a)delicious, b) a little different, and c) will definitely make people RAVE about your baking, then THIS is the dessert to master!

This cake is easier to make than when you first look at the recipe.  I took it to a party
and everyone enjoyed it.  They were pleasantly surprised that it was too sweet, because it
looks so rich.  It make a nice presentation.

2 Things:  Spray jelly roll pan, then top with parchment paper, then spray the parchment paper.  Spraying the pan before the parchment paper goes down helps the paper stay in place, especially helps the corners.  (2)  For the frosting, the ingredients listed has 1 tablespoon white sugar, but there is nothing in the instructions as to where to use the white sugar??  I added it to my chopped pistachios before sprinkling on the cake.  It just sounded like the right thing to do!  Delicious cake roll!

Made this to take to a friends dinner party. Great cake - easy... but lots of steps.  Worth it.  Cannoli filling was way to runny, so I whipped cream very stiff then folded it into the mixture.  Made it perfect and firm enough to fill.   I also didnt add the whipped "icing"... instead I left the fold at the top (cake cooled stiff enough that it wouldnt unroll) and had some cannoli filling 'spilling' out the top... coated with chocolate chips and powdered sugar.  Looked like it came from the bakery and tasted even better!

I forgot to rate this a year & a half ago :(  

MY STARS!  I made this cake for my husband's birthday & it was amazing!  People couldn't get over how awesomely delicious it is.  It was better than an Epicurious super expensive cake the next birthday.  I remember I exactly followed the directions and couldn't have been more pleased.  Worth every bit of the not-complicated work.

Made this for my son's birthday. The only changes I made was to use orange juice instead of  the liqueur.   It was a big hit. I might add a little orange zest next time to see if enhances the flavor. Not sure it really needs it.

I Love the Filling for this cannoli roll. I have to admit I have never made the recipe as stated because years ago i was simply looking for a cannoli filling for my bakery and after looking at hundreds of recipes this one seemed like what I wanted. I use this filling between a simple vanilla cake or I have even added about a 1cup of it to a vanilla cake batter and make cannoli cake. It is the bomb.

The only way you could not LOVE this cake is if you just don't make it properly.  It sounds complicated, but is actually very easy if you follow the well-written instructions.  You will wow your friends and family with this recipe!  In Chicago we have a bakery that makes a famous cannoli cake, and EVERYONE that tasted this cake said it was better than the bakery's version.  My husband loves pistachios and cannoli, so I made this for his birthday and he swore it was the best cake he had ever eaten.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I took it to a family function (my family is very old fashioned Sicilian) and they loved it.  I used Orange Juice to substitute the orange liqueur and it came out great.  I will definitely keep this one!

What a DELICIOUS cake!     A hit at my son't 28th birthday party (he wanted something different!) .   If you follow the directions, it's really not hard (my first attempt at a jelly-roll style cake).    I felt like Emeril bakin' away!!  I WILL make this one again.  Thanks for sharing it!

I didnt have the right size pan so my cake turned out a little bigger than it should have and because of that, my filling wasnt as thick as I would have liked it. I follwed the advice of others and drained the ricotta on a cheese cloth in the regrig for over an hour and the consistency of the filling was perfect...Not runny at all. I used reg size choc chips and used a food processer to make them more fine. Next time I might ad a little extra to the filling. One thing missing in the directions was what to do with the TBSP of sugar at the end, so I added about 1 tbsp to the nuts and choc for the topping plus I added a big dash to my whipped cream topping because I prefer it a bit sweeter. The cake was good the night I served it But it was GREAT the second day!!! MUCH better! Next time I will definatly make at least two days in advance. It needs the time for the flavors to come together.

I was only looking for a cannoli filling recipe when I found this one- and it really delivered!  The addition of the cream cheese makes the filling more stable, which is perfect for the wedding cake I am putting it in.  As a professional baker, I can tell by looking at the recipe that it would be excellent, but my five stars is for the filling alone.  :)

This cake looks good. My suggestion would be to use drained fresh ricotta for the filling, and not bother mixing it with cream cheese.

I always read other reader's ratings prior to making a new recipe.  Adding more sugar, cinnamon and some lemon zest to the cream mixture was definitely needed.  I also drained the ricotta in cheesecloth and then pulsed it separately for a few minutes before adding the cream cheese, etc.  Yummy!!!

I made this for my husbands birthday.  He is a huge cannoli fan and picked this out himself for me to make.  It was a hit!!!  Everyone loved it and I found it very easy to make.  I anticipated that I may have a problem somewhere in the making of the cake.  Not one!!  Thank you...Hubby has a new favorite!!

I just love this recipe.  I had never made a "jelly roll type cake" before and found this very easy.  The filling is fantastic. I actually gave the recipe to a baker to have it recreated for our wedding cake.  (Unfortunately she must have lost it because this was not what we got...guess I should have done it myself!)

I made this the night before my mom's 60th birthday party (for the party).  It looked so good we called my mom over that night and ate it.  Shhh, don't tell the rest of the family. I did have to make something else to replace it. It really isn't hard at all and it is well worth it.

Did everything as written except made an actual cake instead of the roll and the cake was very dry.  For the filling I used mascarpone instead of bothering with draing the ricotta and it turned out perfectly, as good as Italian bakery's cannoli filling!  As far as the cake goes, I will keep searching for the perfect recipe.

Followed the recipe to the letter.  The filling was very runny.  I had to keep adding more and more confectioners sugar and doubled the cream cheese, before it was thick enough to stay in the cake. By then I'd lost the riccotta flavor.  I don't think I'll make this again.

Very good - pretty easy to make.  I would like it if it had a stronger flavor.  Substituted rum for orange flavor in icing.

When I think of a cannoli, I think of a rich and creamy filling.  That was not this.  It was ok, but the flavor was only lightly reminiscent of cannoli.  If you are a true cannoli fan, I would say to go for the real thing or you will be disappointed.

The cream was what I was after!  I used a white cake mix to save time.  Yes, it wasn't the best idea for a purist.  But my daughter's birthday was in the middle of the week. It was really good and I'd make it again but try the cake part next time. Thanks!!

This was a great cake, loved by my husband (who doesn't like cake) and me (who doesn't like cannolli).  We didn't have any orange liqueor in the house, so used fresh oj in it's place.  I also used freshly made ricotta.

i made the cake into a 6 inch pan. i changed the yield to 8 ppl and got 3 layers out of the cake mix. As for the filling and whipped cream, I did a serving of 10 ppl just to make sure i had enough.  It turned out really great and the customer loved it!

I rated this recipe right in the middle because I did not like it at all, but my brother and husband gobbled it down.  Maybe it's not fair of me since I don't like real cannolis, but I could not stomach this.  However, the guys said it was delicious and that the filling tasted just like a real cannoli filling.

not so impressed.... after putting all the stuff together for the cannoli cream i wasnt happy with the way it tasted, wasn't cannoli enough for me.  I ended up adding more vanilla and cin.  i also didnt have enough time to wait for the cannoli cream to thicken so i added 1 package of white chocolate instant pudding and that helped the flavor big time.  The cake are of it was more like an sponge cake but it had something missing... couldnt really figure out what.  I think next time (because despite the fact that my boyfriend and I weren't thrilled, everyone else in my family, who are harsh critics, loved it) I'm gonna make a vanilla cake and just slice it like they do at my favorite italian place I think also making twice the amount of liquour spread is a good idea its fantastic to see the liquour as you cut into the cake.

I have just finished making this cake for a family picnic tomorrow.  Although I have not tasted the cake totally assembled, all the parts tasted really good! LOL..  I have read the reviews and I think that the problem is the cream cheese.  I bought an 8 oz package and cut it on the mark that measured 4oz.  On a whim I got out my food scale and weighed it, it was not a full 4 ounces!  It was a little less than 3.5 oz.  I made sure that I had a full 4 oz before mixing and the consistancy was not runny at all. And I only had it in the fridge a short time.

Also, I left out the orange liqueur because there will be children eating this and even though it isn't much, I decided to omit it for that reason.

This cake is delicious.  I multiplied the filling by 1-1/2 so that I'd have more filling since that was the best part.  Took it to a family party and it went in no time.

The cake is super and came out fabulous-- I agree with the other lady- I couldn't get the filling to come out thick-- what am I doing wrong-- I followed the directions- the ricotta was thick when I started -- Should I refrigerate the filling longer than 1 hour?????
Would someone please email me and tell me what they would do-- I even added more 10x sugar- didn't help= 
Also I covered the cake with Raspberry jam to add more flavor-- it is in refrig now- can't wait to have some---

Easy to make, and a great size for birthday parties. I altered the recipe a little bit by using cinnamon, instead of adding the cannoli. Tastes just great with a custard cream filling too!

My first attempt at a jelly-roll style cake, and I was very pleased.  I found the cake very rich.  I served direct from the refrigerator, next time I would set out for 20 minutes before serving.

The cannoli cream is delicious and dead on, but when I combined it with the cake it lost its true taste.  Cake is like a sponge cake and soaked up some of the cream.  It's is still a delicious recipe, just not exactly what I expected from a cannoli cake.

I liked this cake and it looks very pretty, but maybe it was just the flavor of the cake itself that I didn't love. It was a little bland to me.

Brought this to a potluck, was one of the only deserts EVERYONE had a piece of, and it was the only one gone out of 6 desserts by the end of the night.  It's fairly light, and not overly sweet, so its great after a big meal.

The cannoli cake was a great dessert idea to serve.  However, when I made the cake, I had a few things to fix about the cannoli filling.

There really wasn't very much flavor in the filling.  The ricotta definitely needs to be pulsed in a food processor, or the filling will be clumpy.  I added about 1/2-1 tsp. of lemon juice, and it brought out a lot of the flavor.  I also added more cinnamon.  I also added some more sugar, because the cream wasn't very sweet.

I wouldn't serve this to someone who is expecting a cannoli.  It is reminiscent of the cannoli flavor, but not is quite a different dessert.

I took this cake to an Italian themed party.   Hardly anyone tried it.  It tasted ok, but don't think I'll make it again.

I was disappointed with the consistency of the filling.  I wanted it to be firm, like that of a pumpkin roll.  Although the flavor was good, I'll certainly play with the filling recipe next time.  The sponge cake was very nice and easy!

It turned out great! The only thing I would add is that I added another 1/8 cup of confectioners sugar and an 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar after adding the alcohol to the frosting and it gave it a much better consistency.

To much orange liquor and the cake was to soft/mushy with the filling.  We love cannoli's in our house!  This recipe was disapointing.

This recipe worked fine for me--lots of work.For the filling I did use the pudding to insure flavor and thickness.  I'm not much a riccota dessert fan.  Will use the cake recipe and try other fillings.

Delicious, but not your classic cannoli taste.  Still a wonderful presentation and worth the effort. Which honestly wasn’t difficult at all. Just follow the directions. The only thing I did different was adding less orange liquor in the whipped cream frosting. Very good!

No stars. I must have done something wrong because this was a disaster. The cake turned out fine. The filling was runny, and tasteless. I wasted time and money on this recipe.  I sure would like to know how all of the others made such a wonderful dessert.

This was really good but I will probably not make it again due to the length of time it takes to make, and all the dirty dishes it causes. I will, however, make the filling and the frosting again. It was so good. Might use a little less liquor in the frosting next time though, it was slightly overpowering.

This is delightful!  I strained my ricotta in cheesecloth, so the filling was the perfect texture.  I will definitely make this cake again.  Thank you Shirleyo for sharing your wonderful recipe!

I'm glad I made it because I got lots of compliments on constructing an impressive-looking dessert.  As far as taste - The filling was awesome, the frosting was awesome, the cake: not so much.  Nothing wrong with the recipe itself, I guess I'm just not a fan of sponge caked.
