This was SO good.  I added some sugar to the whipping cream to make it a little less sour. I also used a melon baller instead of the ice cream scoop to make tiny bite size balls.  Great dish!  Looks beautiful, tastes great, and a lovely gourmet-ish dish to impress the folks.

This recipe is great for whipping up ahead of time, then allowing guests to assemble it their way. I added a small splash of vanilla extract and sugar to the cream before whipping because I don't particularly like plain cream. Five star taste, and very easy to recreate.
