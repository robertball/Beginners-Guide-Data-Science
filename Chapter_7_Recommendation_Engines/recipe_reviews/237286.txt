I just made this chicken over some rice and holy moly, it is so good!!! I love spicy food, so I thought it was just perfect, and the honey really help add a layer of sweetness to the chicken that my taste buds thoroughly enjoyed. I cooked the chicken at 350 for about ten minutes and then 245 for another ten minutes and it was very juicy because I didn't want to risk it going dry.I also didn't add the italian season because it just seemed weird to add, but other than that, c'est magnifique!

My mouth watered when I read this recipe, for good reason! Delicious ... spicy, but could be mellowed by using half Sriracha (Chinese ketchup) & half "American" ketchup. Since I already had a 2# package of 4 small drumsticks & 4 small thighs, after skinning them, I coated each completely with the sauce (ample for the 8 pieces), and rolled all in Panko bread crumbs. Baked at 350-degrees for about an hour, they were soooo good! Thank you for coming up with this recipe, Sadaf.

11-30-15 ~ A spicy chicken that we both enjoyed zing from the sriracha.  Very simple to make, but loaded with flavor.  I added some diced onion to the mixture and would do so again, next time.  The first night we ate it hot with fruit, cucumbers and a salad.  The leftovers we had cold, sliced on a salad and really enjoyed it that way, also.

I knew from experience the proportion of honey to Sriracha would be too spicy for our family so I started at 1:1, added the other ingredients and tasted.  At that point I added more Sriracha to taste, perhaps 1 part honey to 1.5 parts Sriracha.  I also used BLSL thighs for better chicken flavor.  This is a great example of a recipe that anyone can make to taste.  Thank you, Sadaf!

I haven't tried this yet, but it gave me an awesome idea!  I found this recipe while I was looking for a sweet/spicy dipping sauce to serve with egg rolls.  How good would this be for wings??? Now I need a reason to have a party!

I was a little underwhelmed. Not too spicy + not too sweet = a little bland overall.

This was great!  Spicy but definitely not too spicy!  I'm going to play around with the honey to sriracha ratio next time simply because I think it would be good many ways!

I've made this recipe countless times. SUPER quick and easy, and I'm usually a slow cook. I usually make six servings since 3 full chicken breasts come in a pack and I halve them. We have enough for dinner and for lunch for a few days. I always skip the butter to keep it a little healthier, and it doesn't hurt a thing. It's always pretty spicy when I make it, and that's just how I like it. Also, if you want it on the sweeter side, add a little extra honey.

We really enjoyed this and definitely will make it again.  I didn't give the recipe 5 starts as I took the advice of other reviewers and toned down the heat.  I  replaced half of the sriracha with ketchup

Yes, spicy; but, really, what did you expect?!  :D  'Knowing it would be spicy, maybe too spicy, I just made the sauce & tried it - with & without the italian seasoning.  Both are good, but I like the one without the italian seasoning a little better.  The one without just has hot as the predominant flavor as compared to spicy with spices.  'With me?  :)  I'll use this as a dipping sauce for now.  What I did:  Melted 4t butter, added 1/4t onion powder, 1/2t granulated garlic, 1/4t black pepper ('Think reducing that to lessen heat instead of the siracha would be the way to go), no salt (the sauce is salty enough), 2T siracha & 1T honey.  Repeated with same amounts & added 1/4t italian seasoning.  'Glad I tried.  :)

My family loves this! I’ve made several times with doubling the recipe for 4 chicken breasts. I use 1/4 cup sriracha, 3tbs honey, and don’t change the amount of the other ingredients. I add a little minced garlic and ginger to boost the flavor level.  Cooked at 435 for about 30 minutes. If you like sriracha, you should give it a try.

I can't downgrade it because it's HOT. I liked the flavor, the heat was the issue.   This was my first time cooking with sriracha and holy cow it was HOT.  In TX, we know spice heat but this was too much for us, wiping off the excess sauce to make it edible.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I'll cut back on Sriracha, add more honey & a bit more butter. I baked just as it suggested and the chicken was moist.  Simple and quick dinner entre. Another plus is this spice didn't cause acid reflux for either of us.

I make this frequently.  Usually I will multiply the recipe and do 5-7 pounds of chicken at a time.  Works very well with boneless thighs as well.  Same recipe, but put it in a crockpot, and you will end up with a delicious curry.

My family ate this up! It's super quick to make. I didn't have honey so I used Agave. Either way, it was a good mix of sweet & spicy. My very picky teenage even ate it, had seconds and then stashed some away for the next day. My younger teen sprinkled more Italian Seasoning on her pieces and also raved about it. My son ate half the dish by himself. This recipe is a keeper.

Hubby & I really enjoy this - I've made it several times now.  We enjoy spicy food so this is right up our alley - we may even add a little more Siracha in the future.   I prefer making it with skinless chicken thighs.  If I use bone-in thighs, I cook it for 45 min at 375.  Thanks for sharing our new family favorite!

Made this last night! Wow it was amazing. I changed it up a bit instead of breast I used boneless skinless chicken thighs about 6 pcs then I just poured a little of beer on top of the dish just to mellow out the hotness baked it for 20 minutes. I also made steamed cabbage which also mellows out the hotness while eating I poured the juice over the rice and cabbage...yummy! Will definitely try this again!

Quick, easy, tasty.  I used whole chicken breasts and cooked them about 25 minutes.

I wrapped my chicken in bacon and made the sauce half and half honey and sriracha. It would have been really good with rice, but it was great with baked potatoes too. If I could change one thing it would be not to just let it cook in a flat pan. The watery juices tend to wash out the bottom of the chicken. This would be good grilled, or baked on a rack, raised a bit off the bottom of the pan.

Tastes OK but the sauce is watery and thin when I take the chicken from the oven.  It isn't thick as shown in the photos.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong?I am drying the chicken pieces well before baking them.

This was soooo good! I did mine with chicken wings instead of chicken breast. I ended up doubling the recipe and any drippings in the pan I put over a bed of rice. YUMMERS!

This was really good but I did change it up a bit. I used chicken tenderloins (thinner meat for more flavor) and cooked at 375 for about 25 minutes. Amazing!

Loved this, but did alter it.  My family, kids included, love spicy food, but this is very spicy.  I added more honey to make it 1:1 and added about ½-1 cup chicken stock to make more sauce, that way chicken would stay moist while cooking.  I cooked it at 375, for a bit longer to stay moist as well.  When it was done in the oven, I let the chicken rest for several minutes and cooked the sauce in a small saucepan to reduce it.  Everyone loved it and devoured every bite!

I just made this and it was pretty good but what stuck out like a sore thumb were the Italian seasonings. With the present ratio you cant taste honey at all so if you want it slightly sweet, you definitely need to add another tablespoon of honey.

The ratio of sriracha:honey is WAY off.  Based on other reviews, I decreased went 2:1 vs 3:1 as written and it was still too spicy and we enjoy spicy food.  Most of family did not like this.

It was wayyyyyy too hot for me and I even had to tone it down a lot with more honey and lemon juice. I think that if you love spicy food, you'd love this dish a lot. I like spicy food (not LOVE but like) and I was astonished at how spicy the sauce came out to be. And I omitted the Italian seasoning bc it just seemed out of place for my taste buds. Thanks for sharing!
