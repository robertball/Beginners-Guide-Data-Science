I really love this hot sauce but had to give it less than 5 stars because if I had made it precisely as instructed it wouldn't have been good. The first time I made this I nearly passed out because the vinegar was so overwhelming.  I just halved the vinegar and it worked wonderfully for me.  We make it all the time now and it's a staple in our kitchen.  We eat it with eggs and potatoes, tacos...  anything that needs a little kick.  We even add it to beans when we are making refried beans.  So good!

I agree with the other posts... this needed a little work. I think adding sugar, subtracting lots of vinegar, and throwing a habanero or two in will help quite a bit. I also added a bit of cilantro and lemon juice just for fun and it worked out pretty well.

Ive been looking for hot sauce recipes and really liked this but it was really hot! May seed some of the chilies next time. Used a veggie slicer on peppers and it saved alot of time.

Great Hot Sauce. Pretty hot. Hubby loves it. Followed other reviews and added only 1/4 cup vinegar and some sugar like a teaspoon or so

A nice tasting sauce with a bit of bite.  Add a few habaneros if you want to heat it up.  I also doubled the garlic and used 3/4 cup of vinegar which I could have cut back even more but I wanted to keep the consistency more liquidy than thick.  I would suggest staying away from sugar for any true hot sauce.

Well I used this as a "starter" recipe.  BUT.. I used 6 jalapeno's, 9 Red HOT Peppers AND 2 Habanero's.  Also a 1/3 cup vinegar and 3tbsp's of sugar.  Gave it a deceiving taste...sweet..then mega hot.  Darn Fine Hot Sauce

Nice basic recipe to build off of but to make it as it is makes a very boring bland sauce thats not very hot and way to much vinegar taste.  Will definately use this recipe as a base(starting point) but never again just as it is.

I agree with other reviews, too much vinegar; otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.  I used 1/4 cup white wine vinegar, and it seemed like just enough.  I left all the seeds in my peppers, and it was super hot.  I also added an extra garlic clove and about a Tbl of sugar.  This is a sauce that will get better over time, so I am looking forward to how it develops.  A great way to use up the jalapenos from my garden.

I love the way everyone puts a different spin on this. I use a large onion, 6 large cloves garlic, half tspn mexican oregano, a couple of bay leaves, half cup white wine vinager, juice of 1 lime and the jalapenos.   Doctors got me on a strict diet and I love spicy foods. I eat a lot of salads so for a spicy salad dressing that's not pure fat I mix 1 part of this with 2 parts balsamic vinager 1 part EVOO and a pinch of cumin....yumm

Very good, very easy to make. It's hot, but not too hot.  I tripled the recipe, but still used the one cup of vinegar. I used jalapenos from my garden, and deseeded about half of them. I strained the sauce before jarring it. I got 6/12 oz jars, and 2/ half pint jars from the tripled recipe. I canned it in a hot water bath for 10 minutes. I plan to make this every fall! This recipe is from The Jalapeno Cafe website. Try their popper recipe if you still have jalapenos :)

Love love love this recipe.  the sauce is simple yet has such wonderful flavor.  We made massive batches of it during the summer and gave away to friends.  one thing we added to the recipe if we ran out of jalapenos, was bell and banana peppers from our garden.  it gave it a great flavor.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for a couple of reasons. First, because it's so darn easy to make. Second, because anything THIS fiery couldn't be rated a bit less.

I used Jalapenos from my garden, a good mix of green and red peppers that we didn't gut at all.

My sauce ended up being an orange color. After reading most of the reviews, I opted to use half the amount of vinegar. Glad I did. I made a triple batch, put it in half pint jars, then in a hot water bath for 15 minutes and I'm excited to see how it tastes after letting it rest a bit.

Cooking it took our breath away. It was a sneeze/cough/sniffle fit while we were making it but a really exciting experiment. 

Our little tastes samples left our tongues on fire and we're looking forward to really putting this yummy, super hot sauce to the test on some of our much too macho friends.

This was fantastic!  We did use a variety of hot peppers from our garden, not just jalapenos.  We used fresh garlic cloves, only 1/2 tsp salt and about 1/2 cup vinegar.  We did end up adding 1/4 cup more because we had more peppers, than the recipe calls for, that needed using up and it became too thick.  Will look forward to making this again!

Though much too hot for me, my husband loved it!  I doubled the garlic and reduced the white vinegar to 3/4 cup.  Next time I'll reduce the vinegar to 1/2 cup.

AWESOME! I used 5 cloves of garlic and reduced the vinegar to 1/2 cup, as per other reviewers...so good! As I was cutting the peppers I was worried about how hot this was gonna end up being, but after all was said and done, it had the perfect amount of heat for me! I can't wait for my hubby to come home and try it, I just know he is gonna love it too! From now on, anytime I have an abundance of jalapenos, I will turn to this simple, yet delicious recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've made this twice, once as the recipe calls and another making some slight changes.  Both times they're very very good.  The second time I made it I added 1 packed tablespoon of brown sugar, 1 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp ancho chili powder.  I also cooked the 2 habaneros with the jalapenos which really helped the heat quite a bit.   I liked it better the second way.  The amount of vinegar is just right, since this stuff is supposed to be very very similar to tabasco sauce.

Great sauce! I reduced vinegar to 1/2 cup based on other reviews but then tasted it, and added about 1/4 cup more.  Perfect.  May have been ok with the full cup, but I stopped at 3/4 cup.  Can't wait to make taco's and try this out!

this is such a great base recipe for hot sauce!!  I didn't think the jalapenos would be hot enough for our taste, so I halved the recipe and used 6 jalapenos, 5 serrano peppers and 1 habanero pepper.  I kept the garlic at 3 cloves and added 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp mexican oregano.  After I blended it all, I left half of the sauce thicker with the pulp, and the other half I pushed through a strainer so it was just like the consistency of tobasco sauce - both ways are fabulous!!  next time I'll probably do half and half jalapenos and habaneros cause we like it HOT!  thanks so much for sharing this!!!

this is a good recipe.  my boyfriend & i made batch after batch of this stuff last summer & of course started experimenting with it.  we would add habaneros and cayennes & use beer instead of water.  freakin awesome.  we have so many peppers grow in the backyard in the summer, hot sauce is ideal to use them all :)

I have been looking for a recipe to make my red hot cracked Jalapeno's into a hot sauce, this is a perfect way of doing it. I followed the recipe except I used olive oil, in place of veg. oil, and used 1/4 cup of vinegar instead of 1 cup. mmmmm good if you can let your Jalapenos stay on the plant until they look real ugly and red makes for a better sweet kick.

Very good!  I modified only slightly: used 10 jalapenos & 4 serrano peppers because that is what I had; decreased the water to 1 1/2 cups; and added a dash of lime juice, bit of cilantro, and 1 tsp of sugar as suggested by the other reviewers.  Had this at my super bowl party and everyone loved it!

This hasn't been reviewed for a while but I use it a couple times a year and thought I would add my two cents: I use it as a base recipe. I roast whatever chilis I have ripe at that moment; mostly jalapenos and don't bother to peel them, during the simmering step I add a bit of dried mango or apricot. I make sure it simmers long enough to soften enough to get fully pureed later and I don't add enough that anyone can taste it but it "rounds out" the flavor and heat really nicely :)

Wonderful! I made a quadruple batch with a ton of peppers. Added 3 t. Sugar. We love it. Great on pizza and fish so far. Think it will be great on just about anything. Next yr. I will plant more jalapeños  so I can make more of this sauce. I did not seed the peppers, the sauce is hot and good.

Good base for a hot sauce. I used a little less vinegar though. As you can see from my photo I also used not only Jalapeños, but about 16 Habañeros, Serranos and other small peppers I found bagged together at a local farmer's market. I also added some pineapple at the end to give it a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing first impression. I call it my See-You-In-The-Emergency-Room Sauce.

Pretty good.  I used jalapenos from my garden that had already ripened to red and it made a nice orange color.  Flavor was good, but I think it might be good with a little mustard powder added as well.

Good sauce, but original recipe is a way too vinegary. I reduced amount of vinegar to less than 1/2 cup and added juice of one lime. IMHO it makes it a lot better. Adding one or two habaneros makes it a little bit hotter, but more interesting:)

This was awesome.  I did take one persons advised and used only half the amount of vinegar.  I chopped up an avocado and mixed in the  blender with some of the sauce.  It was delicious.  My brothers who like hot food loved this.

I made this with serrano peppers (about 1.5 lbs). I reduced the vinegar to 2/3 cups based on other reviews. The sauce was great! But I will add the full cup of vinegar next time - there will be a next time. :) Thanks Rayna!

Will try again.  Added sugar and cumin like another reviewer did and that was a bad decision! Next time I'll follow the directions closer but still this was a good base.  Gave our taco's a kick.

Serving size should be more specific (i.e. volume).  16 servings makes roughly 25 ounces.  I don't know how many people consider a serving size to be over an ounce when dealing with a sauce this hot.  Be careful when you're sauteing over the stove, fumes will be noxious.  I did like everyone else and cut vinegar by 1/4 cup (so 3/4 vinegar), and added a bit of sugar (1/3 cup).  I also added a habanero and 3 serranos, along with a dash of liquid smoke.  In retrospect I probably could have omitted the extra peppers and it would be perfect.  It's got a heat that sticks to you pretty good.  If you're real adventurous, add a few other varied peppers for a bit of extra kick.  Overall a good base, but certainly needs tweaking to individual taste.

This is a great starter recipe!  I just gave it a whirl with some miscellaneous peppers from the garden and it worked great.  I'm going to try some variations on it next time.

I agree with most other reviews about this recipe. The vinegar should be cut in half.
I made this recipe will all red jalapenos and used 1/2 cup of vinegar and it made a mighty fine hot sauce. Those are the only changes I made. 
I am looking forward to using it and to see how it will mature in a week or two.

I always plant 6 jalapeno plants in the spring since a 6 pack is only $1.25.  By the end of the summer I have so many peppers I never knew what to do with them.  I stumbled on this recipe and tried it for the first time.  I loved it and I like the extra vinegar taste.  I use this hot sauce on everything.  I even look for things to cook just so I can use this sauce.  So fresh tasting and purely jalapeno flavored.  I am already on my 3rd batch this year and this one I am only using red jalapenos that have been on the plant so long that they turned red.  I also have added some banana peppers to cut the heat a little on one batch which also worked out great.  One other trick I tried from another recipe was to add one fresh (uncooked) jalapeno at the very end of the cooking prior to blending it just to give it an extra bright green color and fresh taste.

This is my first year growing Hot peppers.  Nice and easy way to use up several peppers at one time.  I used red ripe Jalapeno's from my garden and the sauce turned out great.  This is a great base recipe, easily altered to one's own tastes.  Thanks for sharing.

Enjoyed recipie, and all the comments! I put a spin on this recipie based on what was in the Garden.

in 2-3 qt Pot;
I simmered 3 Carrots-chopped  (colour and sweet), 1 large beet-chopped (Color and sweet) with some water (eough to cover veggies-but no more), and 1 TBS Wondra (thickner-as needed), and some cracked malted barley (brew day-thickner). Pinch of Tumeric and Cumin (Preservative and color). Basically tried to create a thick sweet Bright color base. when I was happy, added 1 TBS Sea salt, 1/4 cup vinagar, 1 TBS lemon juice (acid caning process-Rule 2 TBS per quart).        -        

Sauted with oil; 2 cups de-seeded Jalapeno, chopped  (Red), with three schotch bonnette pepper-de seeded ( heat and bright color), and three large garlic bulbs. Sauted until moisture was starting to reduce, and smell enhanced.      -     

I would have added Cilantro but the wife got it first.  -  

Sanitized small mason jars, and filled Hot. Lids sealed when cooled.   -    

I could not stop eating the left over sauce from the PAN, and the colour was awsome!!.  

Please give us some more comments!

Good basic recipe.  I made this last year with about 200 thai peppers, boy was it hot.   this year I added a habanero, cayenne and the thai peppers..i also would recommend adding some red and green bell peppers to add some flavor.  great on tuna fish sandwhiches!

Like many others, I found this to be a great stating point.  I went half jalapeno half chile pepper fresh from my garden, and left most of the seeds in for heat.  Added juice from 1 lemon and about a table spoon of sugar.  It came out more like a Sriracha sauce, thicker and sweeter at first then the heat.  Hoping to get another big load of peppers before the end of sumer.  I will try it again with some more changes.

Love this recipe!!!  Picked the jalapenos this morning and used a whole Vidalia onion.  Fantastic!!!  Puts my favorite green Texas Pete to shame!!!  I did use 3/4 cup of vinegar based on some of the reviews but I think a cup would be just fine.  YUM!!!

My husband and I made this to use up jalapenos from my parents' garden, and we love it! It has a great heat to it, but not too much to block out the great pepper flavor of the sauce. We did reduce the vinegar like many have suggested, and added some fresno peppers. This is definitely one we will make again.

This recipe is perfect for me as I am the only one in the house who eats hot peppers.  I was tired of making salsa in the past because I tended to make too much and then throw it out due to getting old as with making anything with fresh ingredients.   I now make enough to put in a airtight container and by putting vinegar I know this will last for months.   I only altered the recipe by using half a cup of vinegar as others suggested.  I put this on everything-pizza, eggs, potatoes, main dishes, even chinese food as this avoids me adding more salt to my food. And if I am in the mood for salsa, I add some of this to a can of diced tomatoes and cilantro and a little bit of lime and viola-  I have instant salsa!

The original poster left out one big step (this is an Emeril Lagasse recipe, btw), which is why many people don't like all the vinegar. After you've finished the sauce, you're supposed to let it age in the fridge for 2 weeks. It's not going to taste right immediately after it's made.

I tweeked the recipe using 5 or more small tomatoes blanching them in the same water for 50 seconds, allowing to cool then pulling off the skins. also like other folks I cut the vinager in half,left out the oil & doubled the garlic. The tomatoes give it the sweetness and balances very well. It's a keeper if your growing peppers and tomatoes. Cheers!

I tried a double batch of this, following the ingredients list with addition of a few habaneros.  I removed most of the seeds.  I like some acidity and didn't tamper with the vinegar.  Great tasting sauce.  Hot enough, but lots of flavor.
The one variation I made was pulling out some caps and the bottle capper from my home brew kit.  Instead of putting this into jars, I used heat-sterilized 12 ounce beer bottles (not screw necks).  A double recipe doesn't quite fill a sixpack . . . though it does result in more fluid than the blender can hold.  I'd rather pour hotsauce than spoon it, so the beer bottles are great.  Plus it provides an excuse to go buy a sixpack of some new microbrew.

I read the other reviews and used 6 cloves of garlic (I wouldn't be afraid to use a couple more next time...) and limited the vinegar to about 1/2 cup.  I also added a teaspoon of sugar while the ingredients were boiling with the water.  I would definitely make this over and over!!!

I increased the serving quantity to 96 and after reading the online remarks about vinegar being over powering, I cut the vinegar suggestion in half and added one cup of sugar.  My whole family loved this easy to make hot sauce.

I gave this 4 stars since I changed the vinegar. I added 2 habanero pepper to the mix for a little more heat and I did follow the advice to cut the vinegar to 1/2 a cup.  THis was wonderful.  We will be making this in the future. Perfect on chicken wings.

Delicious sauce! Added some habanero peppers and lemon juice for added bite. This one is better than any bottled green sauce and I love that I can control the amount of salt (my biggest issue with bottled sauces). Thanks for the recipe!

I should give this 5 stars just because it made my husband cry LOL but he used serranos instead of jalapenos & he took a bite while the salsa was still warm.  He also cut wayy back on the vinegar. He used rice vinegar & only used 1/4 of a cup. He also used raw sugar in the recipe & he loved the flavor it added.

I wasn’t sure if I should make this because so many people changed it. Many said it needed sugar and they added other ingredients to it. So since I’ve never made a hot sauce before I wasn’t sure if it was going to be a good recipe.  But I decided to make it as is and I’m glad I did! I could taste the vinegar but with all the other flavours, I liked it. I hoped my husband (who’s a hot sauce fanatic) and guests would feel the same.  All 11 of them, and my husband loved it! They put it in their chili and on pork dumplings for an extra kick. I received so many compliments. Even as they were saying their goodbyes they were still complimenting me on the hot sauce. When they had all gone my husband said, “Well the sauce was a hit!”  Needless to say, I will be making it again! I can see it becoming a staple in our home. Thank you for the great recipe!

I've made this recipe a couple of times with peppers from the same two plants with wildly different results. I used a standard jalapeño and a mucho nacho jalapeño plant. The heat is directly related to your peppers and how you care for your plants! Stressed plants ( of any pepper variety) will produce hotter peppers. I got slack in my watering late in the season and subsequently the latest batch of sauce ( using an equal weight of peppers from each) is much hotter than the sauce I made early in the season with daily watering. This recipe is a rip on a big E recipe. The 1 cup of vinegar makes it RIGHT, but you must let it set for at least 2 weeks. Sure you can add sweetener  and reduce vinegar if you plan to use immediately. Hope you find this helpful if making for the first time. My biggest recommendation is to let it Rest! 2 weeks, it's worth it!

This stuff tastes great compared to store bought. I changed the recipe to make a smaller batch and changed the amount of a few things put into the sauce. I went with 10 med/large peppers. Seeded 5 of them. I only used a 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar (its what I had on hand and actually works very well). Everything else was pretty much the same. I did add a pinch of sugar.. not sure if that did anything. After tossing it in the blender for a few minutes I salted to taste and squeezed about a 1/3 of a lime to give it some tang. Not sure how some people strained this hot sauce.. when I was done it was perfect for consistency so if i put it on something it will not run off..  I like it.. good first run anyways.

I had a big bag of smallish jalapeños from the tail end of gardening season. I probably used close to 50. Per other reviews, I only used 1/2c of vinegar, added some extra garlic and sugar. When I cut the peppers, I removed most seeds. Excellent outcome!

I also agree with other reviewers, the vinegar is a touch strong. I added 2T of honey, extra garlic and onions, and threw in a leftover green Carolina Reaper. I also used cider vinegar in place of the white. I think it adds more depth of flavor.
It's got a fair amount of heat for a jalapeno base, but that is really dependent on the heat level of the peppers. Jalapenos seem to vary wildly, my garden peppers were pretty potent this year. Also, I think a couple of weeks will help the flavors develop.

I made 11 half pints of this really good basic hot sauce. I used a mix of peppers. It turned out fruity with a really nice back heat. I think I may try various spices the next time I make it.  I already tried it in a couple of recipes for dressing and it played well with others! Thank you for posting the recipe!!

I used ripe (red) jalapenos, and I removed most of the seeds.  Just the right amount of heat for me.  I also cut back on the vinegar to 1/2 cup.  My only complaint is that the recipe indicates the number of jalapenos; the problem is that the jalapenos from my garden vary in size, so total weight would have been helpful.

I made it with Rice Vinegar + White wine instead of Wine vinegar.
Turned out pretty good

My next attempt will be to add the garlic at the end to keep the flavor. May even try to roast the peppers on a grill.

My 9 year old son and I made this hot sauce using chili peppers and Thai basil from our garden. It is delicious! We used a variety of peppers, and wow, is it hot. We used only 1/4 cup vinegar and added a teaspoon of sugar, as suggested by other reviews. Definitely recommend.  Tongue still burning!

Glad I read comments first and reduced the vinegar to 1/4 cup. Did not add sugar. I removed ribs and seeds so it has yummy rich flavor without making you cry. Still has a small kick. I might add a habanero next time. Or leave a few ribs in. :)

UPDATE: 3rd time making this and I used Hatch chilis this time - holy cow it's good!

II used a bunch of habineros cayennes and red jalapeños added double the garlic cut the vinegar down to 3/4 cup and added a squirt of mustard to try to prevent separation

It's very good and very hot
I've made it 4 times changing little by little
Last time I made it out of just habineros and it's insane hot

Leave the seeds in!!!!

Made this with some of the leftover peppers from the garden: Carolina Reaper, Red Habanero, Scotch Bonnet.

Warning: If you use high calibre peppers, make this outdoors or in an extremely well ventilated area!  The watering eyes and difficulty breathing was hilarious (yeah, totes n00b here).

However, the hot sauce came out INCREDIBLE!  This year we're trying fermented (uncooked) hot sauces, but would do this again in a heartbeat.  It's brilliant, simple, and quite nummy

We listener to others and backed off the vinegar and added a little sugar. In the future, we will to add sugar and will add back in the vinegar...it came out a little sweet and a little thick, but very good. We had jalapeños and anaheims from the garden.

I love the idea making my own spicy sauce. I made my own changes: No need to saute, just blended the pepper; I doubled the amount of garlic; I kept the one cup of vinegar, it taste so fresh especially for the summer. Next time, I may add a little bit more onion. It taste the best than any spicy sauce I could find! Thank you.

I used fresh jalapenos and yellow onions from my garden.  It was superb!!  I added a medium size banana pepper and one habanero also from my garden.  Super fresh taste.  Stayed with the 1 cup vinegar and it was fine, probably becuase my vegies had a bit more flavour than store bought.

Amazing and simple... but just like most have said... it calls for a bit too much vinegar.... I reduced it almost in half and it is spot on... everything I used it this recipient I grew myself! Delicious .. I also added a teaspoon of sugar the second time around.. This will be my go to recipe.

After reading a few of the posted reviews, I made a few changes .... used 15 jalapenos and then tossed in 6 red chili peppers and another long hot one. Added just a little more than a splash of vinegar at the end. The end product was gooood ..... and hot ! ..... I swear it caused my denture to melt !

Quick and easy sauce to use as a base or to enjoy as is.  I used 'garden salsa' peppers that may have crossed with my habaneros, because it was HOT!

My husband and I loved this! We used 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar instead of one cup of white vinegar. We used red and green hot peppers from our tree. They turned  the sauce orange. It looked like Frank's hot sauce but tasted even better! It was a great way to use up the many  peppers we had. Now we can't get enough peppers because we love this stuff!

I was excited after seeing the reviews, but the recipe was a disappointment :( No flavour. Going to play around a little more and see if I can salvage it.

Cut the water/vineger to 1/4 cup each and added a 1/4 cup of lime juice. The reicipe came out too watery, so I boiled a couple of small diced potatos and added it to the Blendtec to thicken the sauce. Came out wonderful, no taste of the potatos! Thanks Rayna.

A good base recipe, but agree with other commentors and used about half as much vinegar and added 2 tbsp sugar. Seemed a good balance.  I also added the juice of 1 lime. I wanted a slightly chunkier sauce, more like sambal olek chili paste, so I cut water in half. That gave me the consistency I was looking for, but that's a personal preference. Finally, I went for a full on canning of these jars in a water bath canner so they would keep longer, so to compensate, I cut the time cooking the pepper/onion mix to 10 minutes.

When I made my version of this sauce I used these ingredients, plus 3 pablano peppers and about double the salt. My prep for this a bit different though because I'm not fond of the outer skins in my sauces. I foil wrapped the onion (sweet yellow) oil, & garlic together and roasted them on the grill, and grilled and bagged the peppers. When everything cooled to the touch, I peeled and stemmed the peppers, blended everything smooth and added the vinegar and salt to taste. Then canned it as I would pizza sauce. I am really happy with the roasted flavor, and the tanginess of the vinegar plus sweetness of the caramelized sweet onion.

I made this sauce and just loved it! My family likes hot and they really liked the heat. I also cut back the vinegar some. I made salsa in the summer and it called for vinegar and I will have to cut back on it also. Great Recipe and so easy!! Thank you for posting it.

This is great , yes , with some minor modifications . And why go to all the trouble of buying fresh jalapenos @ $3.29 a lb . , and then cooking everything ? We bought a 16 oz. jar of packed-in-water   jalapenos , dumped it all in the blender , threw in about a TBL of dried minced onion, maybe a half tsp of supermarket minced garlic , a quick glug of more water , maybe a quarter cup of vinegar ,  half a tsp salt , 2 tsp of sugar .... let it spin on high for a couple of minutes ......  GOOD!!!  This makes about 24 oz , perfect for that big empty cottage cheese container.  My sensitive wife and kids mix it with mayo for a killer BLT .      Make this. Yummy .

We made this with a combination of hot peppers, including three habaneros. My husband loved it - and hopefully the person we're gifting it to will as well! One word of caution - open ALL the doors and windows - and wear a respirator while it's cooking. That's what we had to resort to because we couldn't breath between the coughing and sneezing.

This hot sauce is really good.  I only made minor changes to modify it.  Followed recipe exactly as is, however added more garlic and onion.  Following others advice I also reduced the amount of vinegar, using only 1/2 cup.  This recipe makes a huge batch.

I have to agree, this is a great starter recipe for hot sauce.  You could probably use any pepper you wanted.  I added a little more onion, sugar as was suggested in the other posts, and a tad bit more vinegar (We like ours kinda vinegary).  I would have given this a 5 star but the overall time to prepare/cook seemed to be a little off--but I did de-seed the jalapenos first.  Mine came from garden to kitchen same day.  Great recipe.  Gonna bottle some up and give to friends.

I purchased a basket of jalapenos at a cheap price but didn't know exactly what to do with them.  Then I found this recipe.  My family has used this sauce on nachos, french fries, chicken and burgers.  We absolutely love it.  Great recipe.

Used jalapenos from the garden and nayonaise (soy mayo) and it turned out too hot.  I'll try hungarians or less jalapenos next time with less vinegar as well.  I'd make again for a good spicy sauce
