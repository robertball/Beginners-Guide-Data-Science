This chicken was excellent for us...and even the kids. I took all the seeds out of the jalapenos except for one so it wouldn't be too spicy.  Only problem: The bacon turned out soggy, so I broiled both top and bottom, but the sides were soggy. Maybe next time I'll try to cook the bacon a bit first OR maybe not even roll up the chicken and just put everything on top of the chicken, then broil...the bacon will be more evenly cooked. The combination of all the flavors was great. I definitely recommend it...don't be afraid of the jalapenos if you don't like it spicy...just take out most seeds.

I thought this was quite tasty.  I pounded the chicken pieces but after putting all the ingredients on the chicken, I couldn't get them to roll up so I just laid them out flat and baked the chicken that a way.  It still turned out well.  I did cook the bacon a little first in the microwave oven.

Excellent recipe!!!! Everyone enjoyed this chicken dish very much. My package of chicken only had 3 in it so I cut the recipe down to suit 3 instead of 4. After having a difficult time rolling up the first one without all the stuff inside falling out I flattened the other two with a meat mallett and that made it a little easier. I had a couple of holes from butterflieng and pounding the chicken but nothing fell out!! I rubbed the ranch dressing into the chicken then topped with cheese, pickled jalapeno slices, and the roma tomato slices. I then placed the flattened chicken ontop of the two pieces of bacon at one end of the bacon and kinda rolled it up and wrapped it at the same time!! It worked out quite well only a little but of the "stuffing" fell out. After placing the stuffed & wrapped chicken in a baking dish I sprinkled the rest of the ranch seasoning packet on top. I did remove the foil and placed the chicken on a broiler rack and upped the temp to 400 to crisp the bacon up. It turned out sooooo good. I wish I had made more than just 3. Thanks for the unique recipe.

I baked this the full hour, but never covered it, the bacon came out crispy without broiling, like others suggested. The chicken was moist, but the breasts were HUGE, like 12 to 16 ounces each. Very yummy. Being in the restaurant business for 20 years, I knew the bacon would be soggy if baked with a cover. Nice, simple recipe. thumbs up.

I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor profile of this recipe. It was also super-simple to put together. However, leaving these in the oven for the time states made my chicken BONE dry. I will try these again, but I'll be sure to start checking for doneness at least 15 minutes earlier than the recipe instructs.

We loved this recipe!  Very tasty blend of flavors! Followed some of the other reviewers advice and uncovered, drained bacon grease and then broiled for 5 mins to crisp the bacon.

This is easy and so good. My husband said this looks like something you would get at a restaurant. The only thing I did different was I made my own ranch seasoning. This was delicious and a great things to make for company.

My husband loves this dish.  I am not a fan of Ranch dressing, but I enjoyed it as well.  I cooked the bacon before baking the chicken and stuck everything in the middle of the chicken to save on the mess. Next time I think I will put some type of breading on the chicken to dress it up a bit...it looked a little bit boring without the bacon on top.

I'm nearly through with internet recipes! I chose this recipe for its simplicity and reviews. I used 3 large breasts because of the 1 hour cook time and stuffed as advertised with the addition of sautéed finely chopped mushrooms, red bell pepper and onion. I completely wrapped with bacon, I mean if your going to wrap it, wrap it good! I placed them in large casserole dish and wrapped tightly with foil ad patiently waited for what would appear to be a delicious meal. 

First observation, the bacon wasn't cooked all the way, it was limp and not appealing. One of the reviews a read said she browned the bacon a bit before wrapping, that's probably a great idea if you want your bacon to be brown and crispy like it should be. Not Good

Second observation: All the cheese had melted and drained out into the dish with the other juice's. Not Good

First taste and impression, dry dry dry!

One hour is to long to cook a stuffed breast, 35 minutes is fine if you remove the cover and broil 5-10 minutes before its done to crisp the bacon for a total time of 45 minutes. Just a thought before you take off and cook for an hour. I gave it 2 stars for ease of putting it together.

this was so awesome! enough to make it again a couple days later.. cut the recipe in half and used the suggestion of making pico de gallo instead of layering the jalapeno and tomato.. used a little less cheese.. pounded the chicken with a mallet like others.. ty so much for this simple recipe

I was missing a few ingredients so I improvised  with what we I had in my pantry and it came out delicious!  Here's my altered recipe:
1.  Pound the chicken flat and season the breasts with kosher salt, pepper and some garlic powder.  
2.  Add a tablespoon of cream cheese to the center of the cutlet and spread it on with a knife.
3.  Sprinkle a packet of onion soup mix on the cutlets 
4.   Add fresh or jarred jalepenos 
5.   Sprinkle some shredded cheese
6.  Roll it up tight and wrap two pieces of bacon around the breast
7.  Salt, pepper and a little more garlic powder
Baked at 350 in a glass Pyrex for an hour

As a new chef, I am always looking for simple and delicious recipes to make. I am a huge fan of spicy and this recipe really hit the spot; not too spicy but not at all bland. My boyfriend really loved it too. I ran into a few of the same problems other people had: the bacon was not done enough - despite having cooked it prior to putting it in the oven and not being able to roll the chicken but it was delicious all the same. I also added just a few slices of avocado to the inside and it was perfect. Great way to try something new.

Very tasty, and very easy. Depending on how spicy one's family enjoys things, japlepenos can be decreased, or just picked out like a few of mine did in the family!

This is excellant, I did partially cook the bacon. I also used half pepper jack cheese with the other cheese and left out the jalapeno's. Broiled at the end. MMM

I made this great chicken dish for my family and we really liked it. Next time I will cook it with added tomato and jalapeno. It was slightly bland. I used a mixture of cheddar, motzerella, and parmesan instead of the colby and it was great! I will be cooking this again soon.
