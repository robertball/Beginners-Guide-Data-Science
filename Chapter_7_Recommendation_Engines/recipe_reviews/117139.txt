This soup was wonderful on a cold, winter day with a basketful of crusty bread. I modified the recipe a bit to include more veggies. I added a can of whole kernel corn, celery, and zucchini, and I also added some cooked elbow noodles in during the last few minutes of cooking. Very delicious and healthful dish.

Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  The leftovers are even better than the first days.  Added extra veggies -- zucchini, carrots, red pepper.  It was colorful and really tasty.  Also, didn't have white beans so used pinto -- great taste and color as well.

I had some butterball cooked turkey sausage that I wanted to use up. I chopped it up and put it in with all of the ingredients. I did not have a leek on hand so I used a box of chopped spinach. I also did not have great northern beans and used white kidney beans instead.

It turned out very yummy and was perfect for the cold fall night we had!

Delicious!  Use the caraway and fennel seeds, but you can substitute other things.  We used bok choy instead of leek. This soup is delicious!

This soup was amazing!  I didn't add the beans and leeks because I didn't have any on hand.  For the leeks, I substituted fresh spinach.  It tasted wonderful!  My very picky husband is slurping his soup off of his spoon as we speak!  :-)  I will definitely cook this one again!

Delish!  I have to admit I was expecting a cream soup, but the Italian flavor lived up to my every expectation.  I used 8 oz. fresh mushrooms instead of canned which added about 20 minutes to the cook time, but well worth the wait.

My differences: I broke up hot extra lean turkey sausage to cook rather than cut when cooked; I used 14 oz of mushrooms, spinach rather than leek and tons of black and white pepper. Also, I added lots of hot sauce to my serving.  It was flavorful yet light!

Wonderful. I substituted turkey ham for the sausage and corriander for the carroway because that's what I had on hand. Also great for lunch the next day.

Fabulous.  My husband and I ate this for dinner with garlic breadsticks, and then we finished up the leftovers for lunch the following day. The only change I made was to add 2 very thinly sliced red potatoes. I am making it again this week.

Great soup....I used Italian chicken sausage and omitted the cream o soup....totally didnt miss it. I also used chopped onion and minced garlic and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Really liked the flavors of the caraway and fennel seed! Also added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and a bag of baby spinach.....very healthy and really tasty.

Outstanding soup.  Very filling and healthy served with a tossed salad and a piece of crusty bread.  Added 2 italian squash sliced and 3 carrots also sliced.  A definite new staple for my family of 5!

Excellent! I rarely strictly follow a recipe - I needed more vegetables.  I added carrots, minced garlic, celery, and yellow squash.  Don't skip the Caraway and Fennel!
