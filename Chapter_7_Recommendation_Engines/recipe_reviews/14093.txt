I have dried tomatoes for years, however I sprinkle them with a little organic sea salt before drying. When tomatoes are almost totally dry, they need to still be pliable, run them quickly through the food chopper, pack in a small container, cover with olive oil and freeze for up to 6 months.

The time will depend on your climate--I live in the desert and they don't take this long.  I also like to use mine in the winter by putting a few in a small dish, pour salad dressing over them to steep a bit while I prepare the salad and then toss it all into the salad at the last minute.  YUM!

If you have a convection oven - set it really low.  Then you don't need a food dehydrater.  My new Electrolux oven worked PERFECT for this and i could do a million at one time.

These couldn't be simpler to make. Mine took a little longer to dry, but it was very humid at the time. You may want to add salt or herbs to these before drying, depending on your intentions, but being able to have them salt-free is definitely a bonus!

This is how I make my sun dried tomatoes using a dehydrator.  Sometimes I'll blanch quickly so I can remove the skin first but not always.  After I freeze them, I take out what I think I can use within 2 or 3 weeks, put them in a jar, and cover them with avocado or olive oil.  I really live the buttery flavor of avocado oil the best though.  This is an easy recipe and SO rewarding during the long dreary winters when all you can think of is fresh tomatoes from the garden again.

Very good, fast & easy.  Can't be easier or a better way of saving some cherry tomatoes.  We have them coming like wildfire in the garden.  Used a dehydrator and did one layer to be sure, and added sea salt, as others suggested using salt.  Very good.  Will definitely load up the dehydrator on all 5 levels next time.  Froze them in a freezer bag.  Tried one after frozen and tastes great.  It was hot and humid here, and some of my golden cherry tomatoes were very large, and it took nearly the 12 hours.  The smaller regular sized sweet 100's were done a little quicker, but not by much, so I left most of them and they were all fine.
