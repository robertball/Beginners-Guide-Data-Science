I am a big fan of salads, not so much of green olives. I thought maybe I just haven't had a good dish with them in it, so I tried this recipe. I must say, I loved it. Its light, vibrant and plain delicious. I added some chopped bacon in it, because what doesn't taste good with bacon! It wasn't heavy with dressing and turned out good. Thank you for this recipe.
