I drained the beans. I'm not a salsa person, so substituted with can on diced tomatoes. For more liquid, added 1 cup beef broth. Also added diced onion and 2 garlic cloves. Sorry, couldn't help it..

I am hoping the changes I made were submitted before this web site crashed!  Briefly, I make enough for 8 people. I use 2 lbs of First Cut top round finely cubed and browned meat in 2 or 3 TBLSPS OF EXTRA VIRGN LIGHT OLIVE OIL, & I buy 2 packs of Mild Chili seasoning, & a large can of crushed tomatoes. Meanwhile I use two large cans of Bushes Best black beans, & 1 small can of Bushes Best Seasoned black beans, in a large pan with enough water to keep from sticking. Bring to a boil, add the meat, and reduce heat to medium low.  Simmer , stirring & adding water until all is tender. I add the crushed tomatoes in the last 20 minutes or so. Serve hot in bowls top with extra sharp yellow cheddar cheese. Enjoy!!

Added pepper and a bit of salt.   Made enough that for leftovers I can add corn chips or macaroni.

Fantastic!  I am not a chili fan, mainly because I donâ€™t like kidney beans, but my husband loves chili  and had been saying he wanted to make some, so I told him to find a recipe without kidney beans. He found this, and we are both hooked! We subbed in a can of chick peas for 1 can of black beans, and enjoyed with sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheddar cheese and chopped green onions, along with some fresh bread. Loved it!!  Hats off to Betsy for a great recipe - I now love chili!!
