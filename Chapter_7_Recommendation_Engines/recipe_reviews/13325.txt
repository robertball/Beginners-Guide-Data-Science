I love how this recipe turned out!  I did make quite a few changes right from the get-go, though.  

First, I used about twelve cups of florets, three celery stalks, two grated carrots, and one onion.  I cooked the veggies at medium heat for ten minutes, using a mixture of chicken broth and some leftover water from steaming vegetables earlier for dinner.  I didn't puree all of the vegetables.  I left about a cup and a half in their large chunks, since I like having something to chew.  I also tripled the roux, in order to have a creamier soup.  In the roux, I used a small can of evaporated milk, also for a creamier soup.  Once the soup was in the final stages of simmering, I added about half a cup of shredded mozzarella and a half a cup of grated parmesan.

It turned out wonderfully!  I don't recommend salt and pepper at the outset.  I would suggest that you allow the folks eating your soup to season for themselves.

Absolutely delicious, and low-fat too!  And it was so quick and easy to make.  I didn't have any celery, but otherwise followed the recipe, and it was great.  Everyone asked for more!  Thanks for sharing this.

This was a great basic recipe.  After I read others comments, It sounded like it was a little thin. So, I added a potato and added cornstarch to the skim milk and it was Great!!!  Really thick and creamy.  I also added just a little cheese to help also.  Very health too.

Yummy!  I didn't find this soup 'thin' as others have reviewed!  I followed it to a "T" and  I think it's just perfect.  It took me no time at all to make this soup.  Very easy and very good.  THX

Great soup, but I didn't think it was thick enough so I added 2 potatoes at the end and blended them in to give a nice thick and creamy texture

When I make this soup, I add 1/2 cup minute rice when adding the broccoli. I also omit the salt and add i cup of grated smoky cheese when adding the milk. This thickens the soup and gives it a nice flavor.

This recipe was very easy and very tasty.  However, it was on the thin side.  Next time I will add a potato to thicken it.

Very delicious and healthy soup.
I added the zest of a lemon.
Lemon goes great with broccoli and the lemon zest smells great. Also added a little fresh oregano and parsley.
I used a little less ff milk.
The soup came out  very good. I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  I didn’t want the thickness, carbs or calories of a heavy cheesy soup as I’m on the diet from hell.  I found this was a perfect solution for lunch.   Packed with nutrients and very few carbs.  Unlike others I didn’t find it to be too thin.  You can’t make this thinking you’re making the traditional cream of broccoli cheesy soup.  In my opinion it’s fabulous!  Only change I made was add one additional carrot and used 1% milk to lower the fat.  For those who still feel the soup is too thin for your taste add 1tbls of corn starch rather than the potato.  Potato has around 30grams of carbs where the corn starch only has 7.   Perfection in a bowl!

This is a really fresh-tasting, good for you soup! I used slightly less chicken broth and milk than called for, and added two small red-skin potatoes that I had left over. Then at the end I stirred in about 1/4 cup of finely shredded parmesan, and about 1/2 cup of finely shredded mozzarella. Quite good!

Excellent Soup! I told my husband what I was making and he looked very disappointed, but as soon as he tasted it he told me to make it again! I did add one scoop of cottage cheese to help thicken the soup. I also added some corn starch to the milk.  I noticed after dinner that the soup in the pot was extremely thick, so it would have also helped to let it sit a little longer.  I also added some celery salt, parsley, and garlic salt to give a little more flavor.

This soup is delicious!  I tweaked it a bit by adding more celery, an extra garlic clove and a handful of baby carrots, but essentially stayed with the original recipe.  It is easy and quick to make! 5 stars!

When I was on a diet, this soup was my go-to. I omitted the milk and replaced it with more chicken stock. Delicious, and fairly healthy. If you're concerned about salt content, whatever. do your thing.

I used this recipe as a guide, because I needed to make my soup bigger for a big family, and adjust it for taste and ingredients on hand.  My soup turned out so good all 5 of my older children ate it right up!  I prefer smaller pieces of carrot so I shredded them (I used about 4 small) and then began sauteeing them in 1/4 c. butter while I chopped the (green) onion, garlic, and celery.  After adding them, I poured in 4 c. potato water (reserved from the day before cause I hate wasting vegetable water!) and then added 1 TBSP chicken buillion.   Added 3 small potatoes diced small along with about 6 c. chopped broccoli (including stem) and let it simmer for 20 minutes.  I did not puree--just made sure everything was chopped tiny.  I used 3/4 c. cream, 2 c. half/half, 1 1/4 c 2% milk.  Heated that slowly and threw in a couple handfuls of shredded cheese.  I sprinkled seasoned salt and black pepper lightly over top then stirred it all up.  Even my pickiest eaters loved it.  I have found THE recipe I needed. Thanks!

Not very good. The soup is very thin, and lacking flavor. I tried adding rice to thicken it up, but the flavor wasn't worth much. Will not be trying this recipe again, especially with so many other good ones that I tried before. The low-calorie and ease led me to this...not worth it!

Definitely not bad! Real simple and healthy - but I added extra garlic, broccoli and spices, and it still wasn't the most flavourful soup. So I'm letting it sit overnight and see what it's like tomorrow.

Looking for a good low fat Brocoli Soup, this was great!!  I added a head of cauliflower and some instant potatos to thicken.   I am sure my husband will add a good amount of cheese and it will be wonderful.   I will eat as is to keep with my diet....:-)

This recipe didn't strike big with me or my husband.  Ours wasn't very flavorful and was very liquidy.  Adding a potato to the recipe didn't seem to thicken it much.  Topping it with mounds of cheese and lots of pepper helped, but I don't think we'll be making it again.

sauté onion, carrots, and Celery in 2 tablespoons of butter first for 5-7 minutes, then move on to step 2. heavy cream instead of milk makes it a little more creamy. very good and easy to make

Thanks, this is a great base recipe.  I used 2% milk and also added some thyme and other seasonings.

Very good for being so healthy! I added a potato, a little lemon zest, a pinch of dried oregano, a bay leaf, and some fresh parsley at the end. I also kept some of the veggies whole and pureed the rest so it'd be a little chunkier. Yum yum!

This soup is good but not sure it should qualify as "Cream" of broccoli soup.  It's a pretty thin consistency and doesn't seem very creamy.  If you're looking for a good low calorie broccoli soup then I think it's a good recipe.

The soup itself tasted very good and it was VERY easy to make, but it didn't get quite as thick as I would have liked.. even after added some shredded cheese and a cornstarch slurry.

This was an excellent base recipe. I did not have broth on hand so used bouillon cubes. I also added a second stalk of celery. To help thicken I added some cauliflower. By using skim milk I was able to keep the fat content low and still have a delicious soup.

This soup was fabulous. I added a diced medium potato and an extra cup of broccoli that I needed to use up. I also topped with some shredded sharp cheddar as a garnish. The soup was rich and flavorful. Thank you for a new favourite recipe! I'll be making this one often!

Very healthy and quick soup!  Like other reviewers, I prefer it a little thicker, so I will add roux or cornstarch next time.  I can see it tasting good with potato or rice added. Anyway, a great base to tinker with!

I doubled the garlic used only 1 cup of Almond milk, and used homemade stock. Frozen broccoli is what I had on hand and it was a bag of 5 cups. I found it to be on the runnier side. After blended I cooked on a low summer UNCOVERED for about 30 mins.. This seemed to help. If making again I'd make a roux before adding the liquid in. Otherwise it's a good, healthier quick soup. Garnish with cheese for extra goodness.. Bacon would be nice too.

a very simple recipe, easy to follow and the soup was very good. The texture could be a little thicker for my liking but that's a easy fix. I will definitely be making it again.

I'm sorry, but this was a horrible soup recipe.
Absolutely no consistency.
Watery on top with clumps on the bottom.
It probably needed some flour to thicken it up.

I will give this 4.5.  I added a smalled potato, diced, as per reviewers' suggestion.  It was delicious and the perfect thickness with this one small change.  I did serve it topped with a bit of shredded old cheddar.  I printed this one and put it in my keeper binder.  That doesn't happen often.

Delicious comfort soup.  I made a pot of this soup and have been taking this for lunch all week.  I didn't have celery on hand so I didn't add to the soup.  Still good. I like my soups chunky so I blended veggies just a bit.  I will make this again especially with the Autumn season around the corner.

This was very good.  I like to try the recipe as it's written the first time, but I added three things.  I added a T of cornstarch and one cubed red potato, skin and all, with the other veggies to thicken it.  I used fat free milk and chicken broth since it didn't say, and I'm trying to keep it light.  I also added a sprinkling of montreal steak shake for a little more flavor.  I topped it with fat-free mozarella, and it was great. My husband liked it too, so this is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to admit I changed this recipe quite a bit.  I sauteed garlic, onion & fresh rosemary before adding broth.  For the broccoli I used leftover broccoli from the Broccoli & Roasted Red Pepper recipe from this site.  I also added some garlic salt and cayenne pepper to give it a little bit of excitement. I used 1 cup whole milk and then I used about a cup of a mixture of cooked & pureed carrots, sweet potatoes, cauliflower & zucchini for the other thickener.  This packed even more veggies in the dish and lowered the fat content while creating a thicker soup.

I was really hoping for more with this recipe, but it turned out thin and bland. I had to doctor it with a bunch of spices, but even then I was unimpressed. Unfortunately it doesn't look like there's a good cream of broccoli soup that's not loaded with calories.

Basic ingredients are as I do except I saute the onion with some diced bacon first. Add this to other vegies when placing in the processor. Makes a little more added flavour.

Good recipe, I left out the celery and I sautedd my onions first in butter and then add them. I like to add a teaspoon of honey dijon mustard to the soup. I shred my carrots and steam them as well as the broccoli before adding.

Soup was too thin & I only added 1 1/2 cups milk. Will not make again.
