For LindaK, you're right, it's too much sugar for most people. Try just 1/4 cup of sugar for 1.5 cup of coconut milk. If you like it richer, thicker, creamier, you should use only 1 cup of coconut milk, then at the end add 1/2 cup of coconut cream, stir well, then remove from heat.
Important fact, the common bananas as we know it, are not right for this dessert. They're to soft, perfect eaten as daily fruit or for cake and muffin, but not for Asian dessert as this. In Thailand we have harder, shorter in length, bananas. They're firmer and heavier. Ideally you don't use the ripe ones for this recipe. They should be half way to 70% ripe.

I had half a can of coconut milk to use up, so halved this recipe.  Even so, it was too sweet and the bananas got very soft  though I did not cook the whole time stated.  I think it was just not to our liking, and will probably not make again.
