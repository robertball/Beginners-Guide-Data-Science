When the hubby's out of town I like to make something quick and easy that I know my 5 and 7 yr olds will eat with minimal complaints.  This was a hit!  I'm not a huge fan of peas myself, but they really work in this dish.  Surprisingly, I actually had leeks on hand, so I pretty much followed the recipe except that I used Barilla PLUS elbows and I added garlic salt instead of regular salt and pepper (per another reviewer).  Yea!  Quick and easy, this will definitely go in our rotation!

I went in a different direction with this because it just read like it needed something.  I cooked the rotini in chicken broth, used frozen peas and carrots that I added to the rotini for the last 5 minutes.  I had no leeks so I sauteed Vidalia onion, which I large diced, until golden.  I served this at room temperature, dressed with really good EVO and white wine vinegar.  I found this needed way more salt than I prefer to use and still needed something more to be really satisfying.  I do like the idea so I'll play with it a bit more.

I subbed Barilla orecchiette for the rotini because I had it on hand- and I really loved how it turned out!  I stuck to the spirit of the recipe, but I'd have to say that as-is the recipe is only mediocre and pretty bland (though the pasta itself was great).  I ended up adding garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, a citrus/black pepper blend, and about a cup of Italian cheese blend to make it a little more melty.  I also upped the basil.  After the changes were made it was great!

I thought this was very good. I didn't have leeks,  so I used red onion and added red pepper flakes.  Kids would love this too.

Can't quit figure this one out. I always have Barilla pastas on hand. This was lacking in the flavor department. I'm not quite sure what to add to give it the flavor it needs but I'll work on it.

I didnt have fresh basil so used dried instead and replaced leeks with onions. It was still delicious! Next time, I would add chickpeas and spinach for an extra heartyness!

Very good.  We both enjoyed it.  I caramelized the leeks just to add more flavor.  There are only two of us, and because we love vegetables, I kept all the ingredients the same except halved the pasta.  It was just right for us.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

We needed a quick lunch before an impromptu trip to the zoo. This was so simple, fast, and tasty! I did not have any leeks on hand, so I used 2 cloves of fresh, shaved garlic. I also swapped out 2 Tbsp of the olive oil for 2 Tbsp of organic coconut oil and I also exchanged the salt for coarse ground garlic salt. Finally, I topped it all with freshly cracked black pepper and shredded Parmesan cheese. Quick, delicious, and a hit with all four of my kids!
