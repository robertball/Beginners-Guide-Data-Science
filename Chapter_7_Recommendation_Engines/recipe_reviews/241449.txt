This is a wonderfully tasty recipe.  I have been doing something similar for a couple years now.  I air pop the popcorn and then pour melted coconut oil with a little Himalayan salt over it and mix.  Sometimes just to change it up I  will add a little ground mustard, turmeric, and black pepper.  We love this.  You need to come up with your own amounts as everyone has differing tastebuds.  Give the basic recipe a try and then change it up every once in a while.  Hint- a little lime is good added to the basic recipe with Himalayan salt! Granulated garlic is good also. I like to add any seasonings to the melted coconut oil to help them distribute through the popped corn. Get creative!

Very good! I've been doing this for a while. I also transfer the cooked popcorn in two batches to a big plastic bowl with a cover. Over each batch I drizzle a small amount of additional coconut oil, salt and then cover and shake it up to more evenly distribute. I just made some, and with the salt I also added some dried minced garlic, black pepper and nutritional yeast. Try whatever spices appeal to you, but in small amounts, because they can overpower.

I put the popcorn and oil in a big glass bowl with a plastic lid that has a vent and cook it in the microwave. So easy, tasty, and fun to watch.

Love this!! I wanted a "white cheddar" taste so I decided to add 1tbsp of grated parmeasan cheese and two pinches  of garlic powder along with three turns of pink himalayan sea salt to the whole batch after it was done. So so delicious!! love this recipe.

Thank You!!!!!
This is the best cooking tip for popcorn!
Who knew 30 seconds would make all the difference!
Works with any oil. I used induction 400 F with Canola Oil.
Your family secret should be shouted to all bing-watching snackers!
God bless to You and Your's.

This is the best popcorn I've ever had and I am a huge popcorn fan. I took a reviewer's advice and drizzled a little extra coconut oil on top. It's amazing how something so simple can be so delicious!

I have made popcorn in coconut oil for years. take it to another level and use baby white popcorn!  it is available online if you do not find it in your area. It is usually found in Amish or farming communities. it has very few hulls and much more flavor!

Made this on medium/high heat.  It had a beautiful toasted color and was quite crispy. Seasoned with S&P, minced coriander and lime juice.

So simple, and yet the coconut oil brings popcorn to another level! It's healthy fat, too.

This snack was easy to make and delicious with extra melted coconut oil and sea salt. My nine year old daughter actually added sugar to her bowl.
