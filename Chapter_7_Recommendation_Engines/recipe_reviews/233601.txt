These were my favorite of the ones I have tried so far though I would omit the soy sauce marinade because they seemed too salty with the bacon. Loved the dipping sauce with it though. I will definitely make again minus the soy. Thanks for sharing!

Instead of chili sauce I used 1/4 c sriracha. Nice kick!
