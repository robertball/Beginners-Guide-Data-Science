I almost passed by this recipe because we are not big fans of legs until I happened to see the cooks notes about this recipe making the most delicious chicken wings. We love wings. I still wasn't sure if I'd like this since we usually fry our wings prior to coating them in sauce. I liked this just fine and in fact, the leftovers hold up much better the next day. If you are looking for a healthier way of cooking hot wings then look no further.

Made nice tender chicken legs.  For fear of making it too hot, I used 6 oz of taco seasoning with a couple dashes of tobasco for the sauce.
