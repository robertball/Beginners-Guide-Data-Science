Really Good!Buti I may be partial being canadian myself! One trick which will make this a 6 star is to add about 1/2 dozen ribs and when the meat falls away remove the bone.
Also I've used maple flavoured beans baked beans, and left the sugar out.. OUTSTANDING! and how much more canadian can you get with the maple flavour eh?

This is an awesome chili, but beware because it is very hot! We love the texture that the carrots and celery contribute. We also serve this Canuck (Canadian) chili "Cincinnati Style" (over spaghetti) to take off some of the lasting heat the taste buds experience. The spaghetti and chili do not store well together though so fix a new batch of spaghetti to serve with this fun flavored chili recipe. If you're looking for a GOOD hot chili (not, I added a load of insanity sauce kind of hot) then THIS IS IT, EH!

This recipe is the "BOMB" I like it hot and this did not dissapoint me in the least bit.  All the ingredients where right own however I substituted white whine vinegar for the beer because I do not drink.  But I did notice that the vegetables where too crunchy so next time I think I may boil them (especially the carrots before I add them.  Other than that there was not nearly a thing wrong with it.  But when family visits I think I will make a mild version (without the extreme heat) for those who can't stand the heat.  I give this recipe ***** and a milky way

I like the idea of all the veggies and garlic and spice, but this turned out waaaay too sweet. I'd rather my chili be hearty, spicy, and hot.   Perhaps you could try this without the sugar and substitute in a plain bean for the baked beans.

Solid recipe, will make again.  Change the canned mushrooms for fresh ones of course, cut out the carrots, and make sure the BBQ sauce you use isn't too sweet; I think this is the reason some people are complaining about the sweetness of this.  (Just check the label of your sauce and be certain sugar/ gluctose isn't the #1 ingredient)

Also, for my purposes, I like things spicy and added another jalapeno, but even that didn't make it too spicy to eat for my other friends.  I think I'd go up to four or even five if you're a true lover of spicy chili.

Amazing!  Cooked as-is, though I wish I would have used fresh mushrooms as another reviewer suggested (canned is just a bit flaccid and slimy for my tastes).  A good amount of kick with sweet/smoky undertones -- though I imagine a lot of this comes from the barbecue sauce you use and the sweetness of the baked beans.  Carrots added an interesting texture that we didn't mind, and the celery wasn't nearly as noticeable as the carrots in the end.  Paired it with a dollop of sour cream, cheese on top, and the honey cornbread recipe from this site.  Looking forward to fighting for the leftovers!

This has been in our regular rotation for years. It's delicious as-is. But I've omitted the celery, carrots and mushrooms to accommodate my husband's pickiness. I have trouble finding seasoned pepper, so I substitute it with chili powder and cut the garlic from 3 tablespoons to 2. Sometimes I'll add an Anaheim pepper just for the heck of it. It's always yummy.

Did not care for this at all.  The vegetables made it more of a stew than a chili.  Had to add a lot of cheese and sour cream in order to eat it and we don't plan to eat the left overs.  A waste of ingredients for us.  Not quite spaghetti sauce, not quite chili, not quite stew...strange and unpleasant.

Not bad, but I thought it needed more seasoning.  I left the carrots out because they just don't belong in chili, in my opinion.

Made this chili and shared it with some family.  Everyone loved it and a couple asked me for the recipe.  I thought it would be weird  to have celery in a chili but it turned out well.  Everyone loved it including me.

I made this recently and I have to tell you, this is some good chili. I made two minor changes. I used fresh mushrooms and Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer. I forgot to add the sugar but glad I didn't. It was sweet enough for me and the others and it was complimented very nicely by the heat.

Great recipe, only thing I changed was that I used Habanero pepper instead of the jalapeno and did not use celery.  Great flavour, hearty, and would definitely make again!

I didn't use quite as much sugar as called for and it was still a bit sweet for me.  My son loved it.  My husband and I thought it was OK.  I did add pork also as suggested.  Might make it again.

Made this for the Super Bowl. The sweetness of the baked beans, bbq sauce and sugar counter the spicy jalapenos and red pepper nicely.

This was much better after it had sat overnight.  It's good, but not one of our keepers.  Be forewarned!  It takes a LOT of chopping!  My only changes where to use 1/2 beef and 1/2 spicy italian sausage and broth instead of beer (and that was only because I didn't realize we were out until it was too late).  FYI...I used Big Al's BBQ sauce recipe.

This is good chili.  Like some others I left out the carrots because they just don't belong in chili, unless of course it is a vegetarian one. I used 1 Tbsp. of pepper flakes and found it just right for me. I would suggest 1 tsp. to anyone trying this for the first time. Definitely add the BBQ sauce, it can vary the flavor depending on the one used. I used Bulls-eye 'Old West Hickory' which gave the chili just a hint of smoked hickory flavor.  Of course you have to use Molsen 'Canadian' beer. Great comfort food, great chili, give it a try.

This is my go-to chili recipe. I don't like beans, so I made it without any beans and nobody even noticed they were missing because of all the veggies. And I used Newcastle beer instead. It won second place at my work chili cook-off, and I'm entering it at my new job's cook-off next week to see how it'll do.

I made this about 2 months ago and it was fantastic!  I first tried a chili recipe that didn't involve cooking the beef first.  It turned out like mush.  This one though, it's great!  It reminds me of the Mango Habanero wings from BWW.  Quite spicy if you make it exactly like the recipe.  I think next time I'll add some ground sausage, less crushed red pepper, and more fresh pepper.

I love the sweet and spice that I get from the ingredients. And adding the maple beans as one reviewer said was a definate plus. I have a really picky family and a chef of a sister and she even said she actually likes it!! A for sure keeper!

I thought this was great!  I took the advice from the 2nd review down and added pork boneless ribs, it turned out great!  I didnt think it was very hot; next time I would add more jalapenos.

This recipe appealed to me right away because it included mushrooms,a favorite of mine. I also always make chili recipes without any chili powder or cumin,as my husband doesn't care for it & add it separately in "my batch".
As I was mixing the ingredients,I was surprised to find it included no chili powder and the results are flavorful & great! Just the right heat for our tastes,too. I get many requests and my picky mate even says I should compete in a Chili Cookoff,which are common,serious events here in Arizona.
This is only red chili recipe in my many files!

We love hot in our house so we loved this hearty chili. I did use 1 lb of pork & 1 lb of beef instead of all beef. One reviewer recommended adding a couple of spare ribs for added flavor so I did and loved it. I also didn't like the sugar so on the second go around I added no sugar and found it was sweet enough from the barbeque sause and baked beans. I used the whole bottle of beer and not the 1/4 cup called for in the recipe. What can I say? I'm from Ireland and couldn't waste a good pint.

Really good chili recipe!  The celery and carrots were a little too crunchy for my taste so next time I'll cook them with the ground beef and onions.  I also think next time I'll add some seasoning salt.  Overall a great hot chili!

I personally didn't like it but everyone that ate it RAVED about it.  For this reason, I am giving this a 4 (one point taken because I didn't like it but I made it so maybe I'm my own worst critic).  Everyone from work to friends of the family LOVED this chili.  I wished I had taken a pic of it but they ate it so quict.  Sorry.  I'm sure I'll be asked to do it again.

Unbelievable recipe.  I am ALWAYS asked for the recipe whenever I serve this.

If you don't like it hot, find another recipe!!

Yum!!! This is different, but so good. I omitted the celery and carrots because that didn't sound good to me. I also used one pound ground beef and one pound keilbosa...that was a good touch! Overall, worth the 5 stars! This is my new chilli recipe.

This was a very good recipe. I was a little nervous making this as it was the first use of our new slow cooker. I made some substitutions and ommisions. I removed the mushrooms altogether and substitued mixed beans for the baked beans. It turned out really well. We found this recipe to be a little hot and I think the next time I will avoid the jalapeno peppers altogether.

Consider the "atomic" part of the name of this recipe fair warning.  I used only about 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper instead of 1 tbsp. and it was still way too spicy for us.  I think this would have been good but I would say hold off on the crushed red pepper until it's done and then adjust it to your liking.  I loved all the vegetables in it and I may very well try it again without the crushed red pepper.

love it, love it, love it!...i've made this many times. 

this chili needs to be hot (the spicier the better), if you try to make it more mild the sweetness dosen't work. you need to contrast the sweet and spicy.

my only real change to the recipe is that i omit the baked beans and replace them with lentils, chickpeas, or black beans...mostly for personal taste but i do find that the baked beans can make it a little too sweet

Everyone loved it but my father in law (too spicy).  I had cut back a bit on the sugar, didn't use the hot sauce and cut back on the crushed peppers (2 tbsn).  I could have gone hotter, but my husband doesn't like too hot (like dad).  To make everyone happy we served with sour cream to temper the 'heat'.  It was really awesome...we used Keith's for beer, but anything domestic is fine.

We made this for the first time yesterday. It was very hot (which is good!) but a little on the sweet side for us. We did not add the carrots and just used light beer but otherwise followed the directions. Next time I will not add the sugar and see if that removes enough  of the sweetness. Good but we prefer our chili more on the spicy/salty side.

HOT HOT HOT! I absolutely love this recipe. I made it exactly how the recipe reads, with the exception of cooking it in a slow cooker, as mine was way to small.  I heat it on way-super-flame-almost-out low for about an hour and it was fine.  I'm not too sure about the celery (I don't like celery) and the carrots though. Next time I'll make it w/o and see how that goes.  I suggest drinking milk and eating bread with this.  I used a little more beer (Bud Light, as I have no clue when it comes to Canadian beer) and added 1 tbsp more chili flakes, 4 taco sauce packets from Taco Bell and Jack Daniel's BBQ Sauce.  VERY VERY good. Going to serve to my sister-in-law's firefighter husband and see how he likes it.

This recipe was very sweet, and instead of having a soupy and thick consistency, it was creamy.  Not very good overall.

I've made this chili many times, always with rave reviews!  I use 1 lb. of ground beef and 1 lb. of ground pork, add a can of corn, double the amount of beer and use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and fresh mushrooms.  I get requests to make this for Grey Cup every year!

I made this using a little less sugar with more bbq sauce and beer (Budweiser, since I didn't have any Canadian beer)... about a 1/3 cup more of each.  Instead of the kidney beans I used black beans (more to my liken) and it was great !!! A bit sweet and spicy.  Definitely different and my hubby loved it .... it's a keeper in our household.  Thanks Mike !!!!

I made this chili after I found it in the Allrecipes.com Slowcooker/Casserole cookbook.  I have to say I was disappointed, and embarassed for having served it to some guests.  I made the recipe exactly as printed, and it was unappealing. The flavor starts too sweet and "tomatoey" from the sugar and tomato paste.  It definitely needs some cumin to actually taste like chili!  The carrots make it taste more like a beef stew, as one of my guests put it  It was so think, I could easily have served it on a plate with a fork.  This recipe would probably be more appropriately used without the ground beef as a sweet/tangy/spicy BBQ sauce for grilling.

We love this recipe just the way it is (with one exception, I hate mushrooms.  So I leave them out).  I've made this a few times now and sometimes have to modify it based on ingredients that are in the house (Pinto beans, crushed tomatoes, Cuban black beans, and so on).  It's a great recipe to use up leftover pasta sauce, veggies, etc.  I've even thrown in some leftover broth.  Each time it's amazing (I guess my point is, don't be afraid to change a few things if need be).  It's even better on the reheat.

I love this chili because the meat is not the main focus of the dish.  So many chilis you find are two pounds of beef and a can or two of beans and an onion.  All the vegetables in this are wonderful!  It is so nice to look at, and the textures are great.  I always add extra celery and carrots, because that is what led me to make this recipe in the first place.  The baked beans and barbeque sauce make it unlike anything you have ever tasted.  I don't quite follow the seasoning though.  I use two teaspoons of cayenne pepper instead of the three tablespoons of crushed red.  I also use less garlic salt and only one jalapeno.  This chili is HOT!

I thought this chili was great!  I put in black beans, because I like them better.  My midwife told me to eat spicy things to get my body ready to be induced, and I ate this chili twice a day for 3 days.  It did the trick!  How weird is that?!

Yum!  I couldn't believe how good this was.  I did have to tweak it, however.  After I had everything mixed together I tasted it and it just didn't seem spicy enough for us, so I added a bit of cumin and a dash of salt and pepper.  I also put in about a tablespoon of Montreal Steak Seasoning.  This made it near perfect to me!  We topped it with Colby Jack cheese and crackers.  The only thing I would change next time is to forget the carrots.  I thought I'd give them a try even after reading previous reviews, but the others are right.. the carrots just don't seem to mesh well with the rest of the recipe.  This one is still a keeper, though!

This was okay chili. I didn't like the taste that the bbq sauce added and ended up having to season it to my taste, but it was a good guideline for making my own version.

I thought this was waaaaay too spicy, even for chilli.  I tried adding yogurt, mayonaise, sour creme... nothing did it.  I ended up throwing it out.  Horrible.  Maybe better if you didn't add so much red pepper.

This was TERRIBLE! I am humiliated that I served it to guests. Nobody liked it and I had to order pizza instead. This wasn't even that spicy or hot. It was too sweet. It was like a really bad stew. I knew I was taking a risk when the recipe called for carrots and barbeque sauce.  I made it because the reviews were good and I wanted to try something different.

I traditionally used condensed tomato soup for my chili and think it adds a more flavorful base. This recipe  was just ok for me and I think it was due to the tomato paste base. I did enjoy all the veggies.

This chili was amazing - I loved the baked beans and barbecue sauce. I added shredded chicken instead of beef, very good. It's a little too sweet to eat often though.

This is a great recipe for a cold day.  It has an amazing range of flavors and textures that all blend into an amazing finsihed chili.  I found that it was even better the second day.

I took out some of the veggies like the mushrooms and carrots and substituted chili beans for baked beans and left out the bbq sauce. It was fantastic!!

LOVE IT! I have made this several times for social gatherings and vary the heat level accordingly. It's always a hit! A wonderful blend of heat and sweetness. A go-to recipe for sure - will be making for Grey Cup this weekend :)

I made this years ago for a super bowl dinner and everyone loved it.  I have made it every super bowl since, as well as on a cold snowy day throughout the winters.  The balance of the hot spice and the sweet BBQ are a real treat.  I also used ground turkey now as we're making an effort to eat healthier.  I also try various different beans that I find at the supermarket, some with chili seasonings already included.  Adds even more depth to the is wonderful recipe!

I've made this four times in two months - everybody loves this chili and it's the best on this website (I've made quite a few chilis!

Couple of changes:  I add fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I used a few dashes of Franks Red Hot, Worschire Sauce, and liquid smoke.  I only use around 1 small jalapeno and I add a bit of cumin (probably around a tablespoon.  I left out the carrots because it seems weird in chili.  

As for the BBQ sauce, I always use Diana BBQ sauce - a Canadian staple that I'm not sure if you can get outside of Canada.  

Also this works well with less meat and more beans (or even vegetarian).  I usually sub one pound of ground meat for tofu, which I lightly pan fry before adding to the chili.  This could be easily made vegetarian by omitting the meat completely and adding more cans of beans.

My favorite chili recipe PERIOD!!!  The only changes I make are... fresh mushrooms instead of canned, I add Poblano's (3 of them), Jalapeno's (3 of them), and 2 packs of beef cubes.  This really is a great chili recipe!!  I also rip up a cheese stick into before eating, YUMMY!!

Was ok, but only used one jalapeno pepper, did not use any hot sauce, no carrots as suggested, and used bulls eye honey hickey BBQ sauce (which I do not recommend..too sweet this is what ruined it) Will try a regular BBQ sauce the next time..
