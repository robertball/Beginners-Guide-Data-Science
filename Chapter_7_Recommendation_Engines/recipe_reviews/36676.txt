I thought this recipe might be a touch bland so I sauteed the bell pepper and olives with an onion and a clove of garlic for about 10 minutes.  This is a great quick meal.  Goes well with the "Best Bruschetta Ever"

Very quick and easy, but a little too bland. Needs something to pull it all together. I lightly sauteed the vegetables in chicken broth, white wine and a little butter (not too much as you don't want to make this an unhealthy meal)to add a little liquid to the dish. Turned out pretty good. May try some sundried tomatoes next time.

This was too dry.  I added some olive oil, but it still seemed to need something to pull it all together.

not bad; it is definitely a base recipe that needs dressing up to be good

Great blend of flavors... but not a main course pasta, better as a side dish.

Great recipe! So easy, and really great for leftover lunch the next day. I would add some more feta to add more flavor, but other than that it's great. Also works well with whole wheat pasta.

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe, even after I added my favorites: minced garlic, crushed red pepper, and shredded parmesan.
