Very good.  Husband loved it.  I only used 1/4 cup of peach juice as that was what I drained from the peaches.  There was more than enough moisture.  Also, rather than mix brown sugar and pecans and sprinkle over top, I mixed in with yams and peaches.  Therefore there was no need to garnish top with peaches.  Peaches were visible all over.

Very good and easy. The yams and peaches are very complementary in flavor. Will make again.

I liked this recipe very much, a nice change from regular candied sweet potatoes. I used fresh sweet potatoes (in place of canned) and walnuts in place of pecans.

This was good.  It has a nice fresh taste. The problem was I made it for Thanksgiving and it missed the mark on the home/comfort style food that was all around.  Maybe on Christmas next year.

I made it except left out nuts as I'm allergic to them. Still turned out great.  Will make it again.
