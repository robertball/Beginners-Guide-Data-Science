YUM! Love how crispy brown these came out and how you can season them any way you want...I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne and Italian seasoning. These took no time to get together and they smelled delicious while baking. I do wish I would've cut mine a bit thicker, but I'll know for next time. I will def be mkaing these often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Hubby gave these 5 stars.  He is the potato lover in the family.   Nice and crunchy.   Mine took just over 45 minutes total - turning every 15 minutes.   Enjoy!

Because I was grilling a steak, and because I was feeling somewhat lethargic, I just made these on the grill. I mixed the herbs and pepper with the olive oil for approximately an hour hoping to infuse a little more flavor into the oil before adding in the slices of potato, whether that made any difference - who knows.   Also, to give myself a head start, I nuked the potato in the microwave for a few minutes to partially cook it before slicing it. I simply tossed the slices in the olive oil mixture before putting it on a well oiled grill.   It made a great side dish with the marinated steak.   Good call if I may say so myself.

Very much like french fries, I added lots of spices on mine, they would have been bland without them. Make sure to not slice too thin. Will make these more often now that I've tried them!

These are the best little crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside potatoes I've ever eaten.  Amazing!  My son and I even loved them so much we made them two nights in a row!  I can't wait to make these for the rest of my family.  I did three 15 minutes sessions and then put them on the rack for another 10 minutes.  Wonderful!  Thank you Chef John!

Chef John, these potatoes were so good. You are the bomb. :-) The potatoes I had were huge russets. I had to line two large baking sheets with foil to lay them all out flat. I didn't have the herbs suggested. I did 1/2 tsp. salt, and a 1/4 tsp. of pepper, cayenne pepper, Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder. I pretty much followed the seasoning suggestions of Christina. I might just cut back the amount of black and cayenne pepper I used next time. Mine did take the full hour and I cut them about 1/4". I will more likely make these again. They would go great with some fried fish.

A delicious little fry and easy to make!  I like that these are baked and not fried thus healthier.    I baked mine for just shy of 45 min and they turned out good but I think i will leave them in for just a tad longer next time bc I like them really crispy however if you like a more tender fry 45 min seemed about right.  30 min for me was not brown enough but that could be personal taste.  these have a hint if spice to them from the cayenne but its subtle however, if you are at all sensitive to spice I would just omit this and they will still be delish.  I did use the optiional step shown on the video and place my fries on a rack for the last 10-15 min.  liked the added crispness but as CJ said, not a necessary step.  This one will me in my regular rotation.

Very nice.  A bit time consuming to turn each time, but worth it.  I love crispy potatoes, and you can just keep baking these and turning them until you get the desired consistency.  A tad spicy for me, but that's easily resolved by lessening or changing spices.  I must say I've never heard of the name of these, but they are good.  Definitely slice a tad thick or you will end up with almost like potato chips if you aren't careful.  Thanks for the recipe!

I preferred to mix dry seasonings together, toss the cut potatoes in oil and then sprinkle the mixed seasonings on & toss again. I think the seasonings stuck better, that way.  Also, I used a cookie sheet without parchment paper and would do the same again. Timing was right on and they were VERY good and got thumbs up from everyone. Thank you, Chef John for helping my never ending search for new (to me) recipes that are above average!

This is my new "go to" potato recipe after I've tired of regular roasted potatoes, twice baked, mashed, etc.  I love the flavor of the herbs de provence and the SO said he liked these better then our favorite jojo potatoes at the bar; more flavorful and less greasy.  I didn't use the parchment paper and just put it directly on the baking sheet and this turned out fine, albeit messier.  I have tried two of Chef John's recipes thus far and intend to go down the list with them as they've both been five stars.

Chef John is my hero.  His recipes are giving me the courage to learn how to cook after a lifetime of carry-out.  I made these for my husband last week.  I then had to make them the next night, and the night after that.  So simple, versatile, and different from routine foods like baked potatoes.  Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John!

These were pretty good. I cut mine to 1/2 inch and the thickness was to my liking. They definitely need lots of salt and seasoning; I had to use more than the recommended amount. I also had to drizzle mine with olive oil after each turn because they were drying out.

I made these using one large russet potato, sliced 3/8” thick.  I seasoned as indicated but I had to skip the herbes de provence, as I didn’t have any.  I used a baking sheet lined with non-stick foil.  Even though I was leery about the oven time and temp, I proceeded as directed.  I only flipped my potatoes once and really don’t see the need to do it more than that.  After baking these for 45 minutes, they were nicely browned on both sides.  Well I was right about the time and temp.  My potatoes were crispy all right, and Hubs liked them that way, but I felt they had completely dried out and didn’t have any creamy center.  I can’t imagine what they would have been like if I had baked them for the full hour as instructed in the recipe.  If I were to make these again, I would lower the temperature to 400 and bake for about 30 minutes.  So 5 stars from Hubs and 3 stars from me = 4 stars.

I found this recipe originally from Chef John's Foodwishes blog a few months ago. The first time I made them, my husband asked me in a rather accusatory tone why I had never made them before--like I'd been hiding something from him for 15 years. I've made them several times since then. They are wonderful.

These were crispy and creamy. Baked for 45 min. I made as written and should have added a bit more cayenne. Easy and a great sub for French Fries.

Not sure what I did wrong, but these turned out tough and chewy instead of the hoped for crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Lots of spice is needed to make these flavorful, too.

Blanched the potatoes and then seasoned them with olive oil, cayenne pepper and french herb salt. It took about 45 minutes for these to cook. Worth the wait. Casual but satisfying. Make again!

It took a bit longer than suggested by Chef John but the results were excellent.  The cook on the cooling rack was definitely necessary.  Ketchup or Rémoulade sauce were perfect. Sadly, there were no leftovers...

Great recipe! Keep an eye on them after 30 minutes of baking. We enjoyed the change from a traditional fry.

Conflicted on what to give this recipe since I'm not sure if I maybe mis-read the directions. I didn't have the recommended seasonings so just threw in some spices I like, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. When I took them out at 30 minutes they looked done, but I've been burned before by potatoes that LOOK done but are still undercooked inside, so put them back in the oven against my better judgement. About ten minutes later I could smell that they were burning - half of them were almost black, and the rest only slightly softer than a brick. Had some with my meal anyway but tossed most of them in the compost. Definitely going to try again, but for only 30 minutes, and maybe a lower temperature.

We had a hard time with these. 30 minutes at 425 degrees was more than sufficient, and I can't believe one reviewer cooked at 450 degrees. Unless the slices are cut perfectly evenly, some will be cooked OK, others overly crispy (bordering on burnt). We didn't do the step with the rack -- there were too many slices to even contemplate that, and they were done, done, done by the time that step would have come into play.

I was really surprised at how good these were.  I've made 'oven fries' hundreds of times but these were easier and I'd have to say...better.  The only thing I did differently was to use a crinkle cut blade and I think that might have taken these over the edge for me (maybe the air can circulate under them more? I don't know) but they were fantastic and I'll definitely make them again!  Oh, I made a sour cream dip to go with them; essentially dried onion/garlic/salt/herbs and the 2 of us at the whole pan :)

Very good. I definitely didn't need to cook for the full hour, though. After 30 minutes and one turn, they were done. I will make these again, for sure, and try them with different seasonings.

Okay, so the first time I made this, I included the pinch of cayenne, but didn't have the herbs de providence. This time, instead of using parchment paper, I sprayed the sheets with some extra virgin olive oil and just used salt and pepper  to make steak fries instead. Still, I credit you with giving me the idea to keep it simple, and to be patient to let them brown up (while you check on them to be sure to flip them in time).  Thank you, anyway,  Chef John!

Turned out a bit tough. With all the turning, it seems the oil and spices didn't stick well, resulting in less flavor than I would've expected. A bit too much work for the payoff.

Wash the potatoes, before slicing them to @3/8" disks, then rinse in cold water to wash off the excess starch, and finally "dry potatoes" with paper towels blot Hong the potato until most of the water has been removed.  Season with olive oil & seasonings.  Bake according to recipe... When the potatoes are close to done, place each slice on a rack in your baking sheet, and bake another 5-10 minutes, until you can hear the scratch from the back of a fork while "scratching" them.  Total time cooked @45 minutes, turning them over  every 15 minutes.  Eat with ketchup. Serve as a side dish with steak, pork chops, chicken, burgers etc.

Found these simply amazing, can't have pepper so made my own seasoned salt mix.
For those of you that don't like to flip individually, I just used another lined cookie sheet and flipped them.

Chef John comes through again. Followed this recipe exactly except for oven temp. I heated a 450 degree oven. Using the rack to get that finished crisp is a real game changer. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe.

These are amazing crowd favourites and great to make while cooking the burgers on the BBQ.  Especially in Winter ;D  Spice them up every which way you want.  Avoid sugar base seasoning as it will burn before the potato does.  I personally use the convection setting of my oven @ 400 degrees.  This cooks them a little faster and crisper.

Nice and crispy, very delicious. Simple preparation and overall easy recipe. Just be sure to cut potatoes thick or like others have stated you will have chips instead. Thanks for a great recipe :)!

I fixed these potatoes last night, and they were very good! My daughter in law and I liked them, and they even got 2 thumbs up from my 2 year old granddaughter! I used spices (recommended by Christina). Thanks Chef John for the recipe. I served them with Baked Parm. Tilapia, (found on this website) and a Spinach Salad.

Love making my own potato chips and this is a good way to change things up. It's also a great base recipe to play with for seasonings!

These are very good, but you need to adjust the cooking time.  3/8 inch is a good size to cut the potatoes, but you should only cook them for about 15 minutes on each side, unless you like them super crispy.

I liked it.  I sliced the potatoes too thin and burned 1/2 my batch - but that was my mistake…  You can make them however you want which is kinda fun.  I'll make again and slice them thicker next time.

Kids LOVED these!  I ended up adding 1tsp sea salt & 1/2 tsp ground pepper.  My husband and son added more salt after but I thought they were perfect.  Very easy and VERY tasty!  Will definitely make again.

We made these to go with a brisket Saturday and my mother-in-law asked us to make them again Sunday for dinner (pulled pork).  A big hit to say the least.

WOW! Thanks Chef John! I brushed on some bacon fat instead of the olive oil and WOW... it gave these cottage fries a smokey and salty taste.. amazing!

We also made the same batch with garlic oil and these were just as great!!

Thanks!

Good, simple, oven potatoes. They came out pretty crispy even after only 30 minutes total. I think the temperature is a bit too high, but they were still tasty and I would make them again.

Watched recipe and made exactly as directed.  These weren't bad, but they weren't great either (sorry).  Cooked 15" one side, flipped and cooked 15" other side, placed on rack for final 15".  Husband didn't care at all for them - I thought they were okay, but a little on the greasy side.  Perhaps I used too much olive oil.

Loved these fries, turned out really good. Didn't have herbes de provence and since the video tells you what is in it I just used them from my spice rack except I didn't have the lavender. will be making them again!

I played around with the spices somewhat to go with what I enjoyed, but otherwise stuck to the directions.  They came out *delicious* and went along great with steak!

My son wanted to make homemade French fries for the first time & we chose this recipe. We didn't have some of the ingredients so we improvised. We used a little basil,  garlic powder, sea salt, coarse black pepper & olive oil. We loved it & they were all eaten up at dinner. A recipe keeper.

FANTASTIC!  Nice change from the same old fries and wedges.  Make sure to salt them well.  I added some dill to mine.

These were good but I'm not sure they seemed distinct from any other oven-fried potatoes to me. Though they do have more surface area to brown, which is a plus sometimes. I found flipping them every 15 minutes to be kind of a chore, but they do make a prettier presentation than other oven fries so they're certainly worth it for that. Note: I used a lot more herbes de provence because I don't get enough opportunities to use that blend. Thanks for sharing!
