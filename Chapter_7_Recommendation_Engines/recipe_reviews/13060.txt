I just made this soup today and it was delicious!

Here are a few changes I made:
I made the soup all in one pot. Instead of sauteeing everything in a skillet and then transferring, I sauteed the onions, potatoes, and zucchinis in a large pot, and then added the milk and water (with chicken soup flavoring) to the mixture. I used an immersion blender instead of a food processor.

I didn't have so many zucchinis, so instead I used 4 potatoes, 3 zucchinis, a different amount of water and milk (didn't measure), and instead of soy sauce, I used sherry and worchestershire sauce. I also didn't feel the need to add potato flakes.

Very yummy soup!...and easy to make too!  I doubled the potatoes and omitted the potato flakes.  Blending only half the soup adds texture and bits of vegetable for a hearty meal.

Very good flavor and so easy to make. I started by sauteeing 1/2 large yellow onion and 1 shallot (both chopped very small). Then I SHREDDED an absolutely huge garden zucchini (left skin on...the dark green skin pieces look fun in the ready soup). I also used 4 Idaho potatoes and no flakes. About 1/2 T of fresh thyme and purple basil (each) and the recipe amount of rosemary and white pepper (MUST use white pepper for the great flavor). 2% milk and low-sodium soysauce. Blended everything right in the pot and just love it!

I made this soup with vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (we had a vegetarian visitor) and it was fabulous, either hot or cold!
I will definitely make this one again!

Quite good!  I halved everything, used fresh herbs without measuring, didn't even use the potato flakes or dill weed. I used a bit of 2% milk, and added a little extra pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Only blend half the soup to keep some yummy chunks, grated cheddar on the top and loaf of french bread. Even the kids ate it!

Very good! I left out the potato flakes, soy saue, dill weed, rosemary, and white pepper. I used black pepper, salt, and a bit more basil instead. Very delicious and flavorful soup!

This soup has quickly become a family favorite. It disappears very quickly around here, even though I make a double recipe. It is delicate yet hearty. I use whole potatoes, not flakes. I also use two small hot peppers from my garden for a little extra zing. I made the soup tonight and couldn't figure out what was missing, though everyone still enjoyed it. I looked at the reviews and realized I forgot the soy sauce! I use organic tamari sauce which is fermented soy sauce. I just added it and gave it a taste. It is now perfectly delicious! Won't make that mistake again as I now consider this an essential ingredient. This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious, with the following modifications:
Instead of sauteeing everything in a skillet and then transferring, I sauteed the onions, potatoes, and zucchinis in a large pot, and then added the water (with chicken soup flavoring) to the mixture. When everything was cooked, I used an immersion blender instead of a food processor. I added milk after pureeing everything. Finally, instead of soy sauce I used sherry and Worchestershire sauce (per other reviewer's suggestion). I also didn't feel the need to add potato flakes.

It is my practice to always prepare a recipe AS WRITTEN when trying for the first time.  After finding this recipe and making this soup last summer, I judged it to be perfectly wonderful and in no need of tweaking.  Can't wait for my zucchini to ripen so I can make this soup again!

We loved this soup - and it was perfectly, if delicately, seasoned for me. The only thing I don't like about this recipe is the subjectivity of the sizes of onions, potatoes, and zucchini used. I had one of those gigantic baking potatoes, so I only used one. My zucchini were on the small side of medium, and my onions were largish. I always prefer measured ingredient amounts in recipes to make sure I'm using what the submitter intended. Regardless, I loved the way this soup turned out - so thanks for the recipe! :)

YUM!  Wonderful recipe on hot summer day.  To go with a meal I was preparing I omitted herbs (thyme, rosemary, basil, and dill weed) and instead used 1 tablespoon curry powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin.  This gave me a wonderful chilled curried zucchini soup!  Yummy the original way and with the curried variation.  I will make this many times in the future!

Excellent flavor.  I used about 12 c of zucchini.  Made this without the potato flakes.  Was very thick.  I am freezing it without the milk and will add that when I thaw it.

Very nice!  A smooth soup that is just a little different.  Don't pass this one up if you have a lot of summer zucchini.  It also freezes and thaws well.

Umm, yum!  Also doubled potatoes (used red ones, skin on) and omitted flakes.  Used herbes de provence, since that's all I had.  Great for dinner and great for lunch the next day!

I used sour cream instead of milk, because I just didn't have milk. I also added garlic, and I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth (I am vegetarian. I aslo did not have any of the herbs mentioned, but I did add oregano. This soup was delicious!

This was so good! I had zucchini soup at a cafe last week and wanted to try to duplicate that soup for home. This was a very good match! It was very easy and super flavorful. Don't be afraid to change the herbs and spices to match your taste. I added a little garlic salt and might saute garlic with the onions next time I make this. It will be a fun recipe to play with.

Wow! Awesome recipe. I added 1 tsp chili flakes to the broth mixture and they complimented the creamy flavor really well! I also subbed the potato flakes for extra potato. 
Mmmmm!

I normally follow a recipe verbatim the first time I make it, but this was an exception.  I used veggie broth since I'm a vegan.  I also threw in a couple of extra potatoes since I had them.  After the zucchini and potatoes had cooked, I used an immersion blender which worked great.  It turned into a nice, thick consistency.  Taste tested it and it was great.  Just slightly bland so I added the soy sauce as directed.  I completely skipped the milk (I was going to use rice milk) and potato flakes (those just seemed weird in an otherwise natural organic soup).  I think it's really good this way, and it saves you a few dollars in extra ingredients.

This recipe is RIGHT ON!! I've made it 3 times this week already. Each time I made little tweaks (although it is delicious the way it is). First I added celery in with the onion. Next I'm going to add in leaks. I did like the other reviewers and only used one pot. I also used regular black pepper and even red pepper flakes. I did add a little garlic then garnished with cheddar cheese (or parmesan) and served with crusty sour dough bread! In heaven! This was an instant favorite.

What a soup! The flavor is incredible, and the consistency perfect. My kids, who usually won't touch zucchini, wanted thirds. I used olive oil instead of margarine, and did all the sauteing in the pot rather than dirty a frying pan. My zucchinis were small so I used four potatoes. Shredded cheese makes the perfect garnish for this winner.

I made this soup yesterday and it was tasty. I didn't use the potato flakes so that is why I am thinking my soup was a little runny. Next time I will use more real potatoes. I added extra soy sauce to my bowl of soup, but my boyfriend thought that his was great just the way it was. Will make again for sure!

I absolutely love this soup! My mother gave me 2 monsterous zucchinis and I have been trying to figure out a way to use at least one of them up. This worked out great! I had to modify it a bit (only due to the fact that I used what I had on hand)..but it still turned out delicious! Instead of using 2 potatoes, I used some frozen califlower, switched whole milk to skim, and added a little curry to the finished product. Will definately be making again =) Thanks!

This was good--I served it chilled but I think it would be better warm with a nice crusty bread.  Also, I froze a portion of mine for a mere week and when I defrosted it, it was just NOT the same.  Anyone freeze it successfully?

This is an excellent soup that can be modified easily to fit each person's taste preferences.  I added heat with hot peppers & garlic cooked with the onion. I also simplified as others did using 1 dish & chopping up one large zucchini.  I also added salt & sour cream to finish with the fresh dill.  Will definitely make this again, probably with more changes for variety.

I made this with a few changes. I didnt have any potatoes so I added some carrots,cooked and blended. I also added a dash of ceyanne pepper. I loved it and it was the first cold soup my family has ever had, so it was slow going for them, but not a definate thumbs down. I will make this again , for me , at least.  With all of the zucchinis hanging around this summer, this is an excellent way to use them up, also i am dieting and this is an excellent meal all around for me.

I have been searching all over for a Zucchini soup that I like as well as give me Ideas for modifying a recipe I already have.  This one is the winner so far.  There was just something missing.  I think with our taste for spice, I will add a drop of Braggs and see what happens next time.  Keeper

Delicious, healthy soup!!!  I used skim milk with no problems.  Also, I omitted the potato flakes and added an extra potato.  Will make again many times!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I took the advice of other reviews and did not completely blend the soup which gave it some texture.  I also used 2% milk instead of whole milk to keep the fat down some. I think next time I will leave out the potato flakes because my soup got quite thick.  But overall, this is a great soup for a cold and rainy day.

I made this with some substitutions. Our use the eight zucchini but I also used six potatoes. I like everything to be fresh as much as possible. Are used chicken cooking stock for cups, fresh basil, as I had that in my house. Are used one cup of heavy whipping cream, instead of milk.  I puréed the onion potatoes and the zucchini one said had softened in the pot. I let it cool down before I did the puréeing and put it back into a big bowl so I can transfer it back into the pot. I did use some of the potato broth as well. Only about a cup.

had to deviate from the recipie as I lacked the herbs mentioned. I used 2 bigpinches of dried tarragon instead. Also I started the soup with some olive oil and 2 tbspns of proper butter. omitted potato flakes and used more potato (kipfler) less Zuchinni- 2 big ones; I also added 3 green capsicums. Black pepper and more than a tbspn of dark soy. it was delish- hot and cold. I must try the original version next time and be carefull with adding the soy as it ruined the lovely green colour.

Made this today exactly as stated, didn't change a thing except for not adding potato flakes which I don't have. I peeled my zucchinis because I find the peel sometimes has a bitter taste. I enjoyed this simple recipe. I think the milk is unnecessary as it doesn't really add much. I personally wouldn't double potatoes as some people did as the soup was already very hearty.

This was a tad bland. I'll need to tweak it next time. Also, it definitely works better in the blender than trying to use a stick blender.

I made this soup last night and just had it for lunch.  It was great.  I did not use the potato flakes, but doubled the potatoes, as some readers suggested.  It was not very spicy (which is fine with me), but if you like things with a bit of a kick, you will need to add some spice of your liking.  I will make it again.

Really good use for extra garden zucchini.  "8 zucchini" is very vague; I used one large garden zucchini, figuring that it approximated 8 of the small ones you find in stores.  I used 1% milk, added a couple of kung pao peppers to give it a kick, and made it all in the soup pot using an immersion blender. Much easier than dealing with extra dishes. I sprinkled some dry dill on top of the pot while cooking, not nearly 4 tablespoons full.  I think adding a spoonful of sour cream or plain yogurt on top of your bowl would be tasty, too.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner, exactly as the recipe instructed.  I found it to be rather one dimentional.  In an effort to perk it up a bit, I added some brandy and blue cheese crumbles.  It ended up being very satifying.  The best part was that the kids had no idea that they were eating zucchini soup!

This is a great recipe.  I have made it a few times and it always turns out really good.  Today I tried it a little different and it was the best yet.  I didnt puree it but left it chunky as others have recommended.  I used an envelope of the four cheese instant potatoes and then topped the soup with shredded cheddar cheese, crispy bacon and sliced green onions.  Sooo good!

My grandchildren loved this soup.  With all my summer zucchini, I will make lots and freeze.  I did change one ingredient - left out the soy sauce and replaced with several drops of Tabasco.  The # of drops depends on how spicy you like it.  I happen to like to a small amount.

Bland, not much taste. Also I did not like the color of this soup. I helped the flavor by adding 1/2 cup chardonnay, but my husband still thought it wasn't very good.  Won't keep this one.

This was really good. The flavors were great together. I used 4 potatoes instead of flakes just because I don't keep flakes and I had the fresh herbs on hand. Some fresh Italian parsley on top made it a pretty dish. Served it with hot crusty bread and it made a nice stand alone meal for a cool day (with seconds of course!). 
 I also used one pot for start to finish and pureed it with my stick blender in the pot so it was all easy as well as delicious. It is a keeper for us.

Not bad, but not great either.  A good use of garden zucchini.  It had a good taste, but I didn't like the texture.  I only preed half like other reviews said, but if I were to make again (I probably won't though) I would just dice the zucchini and potatoes VERY small and leave them like that.  I really like potato soup so I think I would like it better with more potatoes.  I wanted to put a dollop of sour cream in the middle but I didn't have any.

This is excellent. My zucchini crop is abundant this year with the amount of rain we've had here in eastern Texas. I've been using different recipes to put of some of my zucchini crop in the freezer. This is a real winner. My zucchini's are very large so I chopped up what I thought was the equivilent to the 8 called for in the recipe. I added 4 medium sized russet potatos instead of 2 and omitted the flakes. I also cooked it all up in one pot. The only additions I made were a some fresh chopped garlic during cooking and a little dash of salt and some black pepper in the end. Thanks for an excellent recipe.

looks good and tastes good! I tried it and in the end before I liquidised everything, I added 3 triangles of cream cheese...they give a completely different taste

I was rather suprised how lovely this soup tasted! I didnt add potato flakes and used fresh herbs instead of dried with a touch of mild curry powder, garlic granules and herb salt. Awesome, and my boyfriend who dosn't really like zucchini loved this soup! Excellent way to use up those plentiful zucchini's in the garden - Thanx

I am a huge zicchini fan so this was ok for me. But it was rather bland and tasting as if it was just boiled and blended zucchini. Needs a lot of creativity, if I make it again. I saw a zucchini soup recipe with the addition of curry on this site, and that may do the job. Also, I tasted it when it was still hot and that was better and more flavourful than the cold version.

I just made this and it is absolutely delicious. I didn't need the potatoe flakes as it is thick enough on its own. I also only pureed half the mixture for a chunkier soup.

This was pretty good, but I did not add the potato flakes and I had to really spice it up. It seemed a little too sweet without.

Delicious is the only way to describe this wonderful soup.  Easy to prepare in a short amount of time.  A wonderful new way to use an overabundance of zucchini in season.

I made this in my Instant-pot, cooking zuke-potato mix for 10 minutes on high pressure. It was a gorgeous spring green color when I used my stick mixer on it. Then I added  the 4 cups of vegetable brith, which was roasted and brown. Made the whole soup an unpleasant dirt color. I wish I would have tasted it as a puree.

So then I added in all the other stuff and let it warm up and mix. It was bland to me so added too much red pepper and a little lemon juice. Then added some salt. This all may be due to the roasted nature of the veggie broth. It just begged to be more dark and flavorful. I will try this again with plain broth, out of curiousity.

The concept is good! I’ll bet it’s great cold in the summer.

I made it! 
I did change a couple of steps.  I didn't puree it,  I used a potato masher as it cooked! Also I added some slices of smoked German sausage. I cant wait for dinner tonight, hopefully its a hit with everyone else :)

This is a great recipe. I prefer it with a quarter cup of sherry and a tsp of Worcester Sauce instead of the soy sauce. I also added carrots, a fennel bulb, and a green bell pepper. I used all fresh herbs as well instead of dry and added a bay leaf. I didn’t use the potato powder but instead used two additional potatoes. Will definitely make again.

Good and simple! I did it all in one giant wok instead. I thew in a whole garlic and a good bit of sliced ginger to blend up as well. While blending, I cooked up corn and mushroom to add to the soup. I also doubled all the spices.
Great way to use up all the extra zucchinis!

Replaced butter with olive oil and whole milk with coconut milk for a dairy-free version. Also added mild Italian sausage and bacon after the puree. My wife said to keep this recipe after her third or fourth bowl.

Utterly delicious. I left out potato flakes & used fresh herbs - probably in double/triple quantities. Yum. Even my father complimented it!  I'm super critical of soup recipes as soups are the only thing I am any good at cooking & this recipe is a keeper  for me.

Added 1/3 cup heavy cream that I needed to use up.  Also blended fresh dill into the soup rather than garnished.

I did not add the potato flakes. I used a hand potato masher instead of putting the cooked soup into a blender. This way the soup was blended but had more substance to it.

This was excellent! I made it in the dead of winter. I did not add soy sauce (sodium level a concern, even the low sodium kind).  I also used sodium-free chicken broth. To keep the carb level down, I added only 4 very small yellow potatoes, and that thickened the soup plenty. I used dry sherry for the soy sauce measure. Since I planned to give some away, they may wish to add more salt and/or pepper than  what I added (1 tsp low-sodium salt was what I added). Since my Half & Half was at the expiration date, I used that instead of milk; it added a nice richness to the taste. I will make this year round, again and again!

I used a couple quarters of frozen squash puree from last year's garden, so not sure it is an equivalent amount to "eight zucchini."  I added garlic cloves to the onions.  I didn't add the fresh dill or potato flakes or milk.  I did use 5 cups of chicken broth and a cup (maybe? I didn't measure) of half and half. I also started the butter, herbs, onions, garlic in one pan.  When that was decently cooked, I added the water and squash purees.and let it cook down.  Then I used an immersion blender.  Then I added half and half and soy sauce. Serving with toast.

Turned out great! I used smaller amount of potatoes because I had less zucchini and added 3 carrots. Used a little milk and a little cream, added drops of worcester sauce instead of soy. Also added a packaged herbs mix together with rosemary and added water a little at a time. I cooked everything in a large pot and mixed with a small blender allowing little delicious shunks!

This soup is really wonderful! This is the second time that I made it.   I used dried dill, omitted the potato flakes and I only had 2 fairly large zucchinis.  The first time I made it I left some of the chunks and only blended part of it.  This time I blended the whole thing.  It's really good both ways!  Thanks for sharing.

The soup was quite good. I actually did not think it would be that good, but it was. Subtle flavor from the herbs, but quite filling, flavorful and hearty. I separated some for my husband before adding the milk (He is lactose intolerant) and for the rest I added the milk. Also, I used fresh potatoes and skipped the soy sauce.  I also prepared it all in one pot, intead of using separate ones.

I omitted the thyme, soy sauce and potato flakes but doubled the potato cubes. I substituted the dried basil for fresh basil and the chicken broth for beef broth. It is delicious and I will make it again especially on cold winter days.

My variation: Add non-fat Greek yogurt instead of milk, 5-6 table spoons of pearl barley, and skip the potato flakes and soy sauce. Also for "garnish," skip the dill and do the following: saute chopped mushrooms, onions, and small meatballs (1/4 inch, 4-5 per bowl), and let people mix it themselves. We make it a whole dinner this way.

GREAT Recipe! Cooked all in one pot.  Instead of milk used plain yogurt, instead of potatoes, used a ripe avocado for half recipe with a splash of lemon, immersion blended and done!  
A great creamy green! Dill and soy splash on top! A fine spring lunch or dinner with "life changing crackers" http://www.mynewroots.org/site/2014/07/the-life-changing-crackers/
I also made zucchini muffins, so wanted to use up the remainders!

This recipe was so tasty, and seems to be quite flexible. I used 5 zucchinis, 1/2 a yellow onion, and one large russet potato because that's what we had, and it was still delicious. Will try it just as it's written next time and see how it goes. I also added about 3/4 tsp of salt at the end. My 17 month old and husband loved it, and they are not an easy crowd. This might just be a staple in our house now.

Had high hopes for this recipe as we love all kinds of squash and potato soups.  Followed recipe exactly except for omitting the potato flakes because I didn't have any.  It was completely tasteless so I added a healthy handful of grated mozzarella, a tablespoon or so of Tajin ( a mexican seasoning blend of chilis dried lime and salt), a hefty squeezing of sriracha, and salt to taste.  I blended the additions in with the immersion blender and added chopped cilantro to each bowl.  Pretty good.

Very good soup, lots of flavour.   I added a can of tomatoes and a tsp of lemon juice.   Family loved this recipe, will definitely keep and make again.  Next time I make this recipe I will add a cup of grated carrots.   Well recommended.

Used 4 cups of shredded zucchini, 2 medium potatoes, 1 cup skim milk.  Skipped the potato flakes. Topped it with cheddar cheese and croutons.  Yummy and healthy.

Great recipe! The little bit of soy sauce is a nice touch.  I like that you use potato flakes to thicken.  I've been doing that for years, with various cream-type soups. Any kind of soup that isn't quite as thick as you want it can be easily thickened by throwing in potato flakes, a little at a time. Also, I used my immersion blender to puree the soup.

This soup turned out amazing! I added extra soy sauce and added a little dill weed right into the soup pot as well as garnished with it. Served with buttered bread for dipping....awesome!

YUM!! Very good soup.  I changed up and did not add all the zuccini or spices and still was good and fast.  One year old ate it up. Very nutritious too
