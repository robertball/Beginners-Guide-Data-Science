I also used only 3 TEAspoons of curry, used only 2 cups of stock and served it over rice. Made this with chicken as well and it was very good.

This recipe is great if made with 3 TEAspoons of curry instead of TABLEspoons.

The yogurt curdles during the cooking process, the spices are too assertive, and the finished recipe is a liquid clumpy mess. Definitely not recommended.

Good recipe, a lot like what I had at an Indian restaurant recently and was trying to duplicate.
Traditional/authentic Indian food is very much spicier than what American tongues are used to.  This is a very authentic recipe.  If it's too hot for you, curry to taste.
I think it's wonderful!

It was OK.  The marinade really didn't do much to flavor the meat and the overall stew wasn't very flavorful (though it could have been the type of curry used--I made it at my sister's).  Folks seemed a little put off with the rice being IN the stew rather than the stew served over the rice--but this is easily done if desired.  I was really hoping this would be great (the recipe looks yummy) but it was just OK.

Although flavorful, 3 tablespoons of curry overwhelms the taste. This recipe is poorly written; it's not detailed enough. Also, adding 8 cups of broth at the end and simmering for only 5 minutes results in a soup, not a stew. I ended up thickening with cornstarch mixture. Recipe never says when to add slivered almonds, or that they should be toasted before adding. I would not make this again.

This recipe doesn't make sense. Either ingredients are missing or miss-proportioned or steps are incorrectly ordered. With enough alterations any recipe would be good but why bother trying to correct this tasteless ditty.

Made this for my bro's 60 birthday lunch today. I basically stuck to the recipe (which was poorly worded) but here's where I did things a little differently: 1) I cooked the spices with the onions for the last minute or so - learned that from an Indian roomie. 2) Started with 1 Tablesp curry and added more as I tasted. I think I got up to 2 Tablesp by the end of cooking. 3) I added the currents in the last 1/2 hour, and the almonts at the very end. 4) I had 2 cups of stock prepared, but didn't add any at all 'til the very end of cooking, and even then, barely a cup. Maybe I had very juicy lamb. Didn't need anymore. Will definitely make this one again as soon as I have a festivity!

I used tsps of curry powder (not tbsp), 1 cup of vegetable broth, and put rice on the side.  The currants made this dish delicious, otherwise it was just ok.

This was wonderful -- I served it to my family for dinner and they raved about it.  I brought it in to work the next day to share with co-workers, and many asked for the recipe.  This will definitely be made again!

This was great. I halved the recipe (and was unfortunately out of cayenne). I made my own broth by boiling lamb bones with other veggies the night before.  The meat came out tender and delicious. I love curry flavored meals and did not think there was too much spice in this recipe. It was wonderful.
