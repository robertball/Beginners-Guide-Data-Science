Great recipe. I didn't have red peppers to roast so I used yellow. I am sure that didn't affect the taste and the yellow and green were very pretty together. Will definately make again and even without salmon the sauce is going to be great on pasta.  Late note! I have used this sauce on shrimp that were sauteed prior to adding to the sauce and also on chicken cubes that were sauteed either is terrific. I am not rating the recipe based on changes that deviate from the original because it makes me angry to see that people say I love this recipe but I changed this or that.  If they changed it then they didn't use the recipe.

Like others, I think that two modifications take this from 4 to 5 stars.  First, the portions are too small-- this applies especially to the sauce.  Second, whisk some heavy cream in the sauce after it's been reduced and is taken off the stove.   Add a tablespoon or two per person.  The dish really is fantastic, and you  should expect rave reviews!

Wow...this is wonderful and like others have said, it looks and tastes like a restaurant dish. The only change I made (other than cooking the salmon on my George Forman grill) was to add about 1/4 cup of fat-free half and half. I'll be making this to serve with pasta even when I'm not serving salmon. Thanks so much!

I love this!  I find making the sauce a bit in advance improves the melding of the flavours.  Also add capers cause I like them and think they go well.  I usually use fresh spinach linguine for the contrast in colours.

I thought this recipe sounded interesting.  It's quite good.  I just bought a basil plant (and I'm very excited about it!) so I threw in a couple of leaves with the fresh cilantro, even though I thought it might have tasted wierd together.  It was good!  I also added a whole can of chicken broth instead of 1 cup, because I didn't want it to go to waste.  I used fresh coho salmon and whole wheat angel hair pasta.  Served with fresh steamed broccoli for a meal you can feel good about eating!

Let me just say- FANTASTIC! This dish is restaurant quality. And not too much work considering how delicious it turns out. I made a couple minor changes- it needs a bit of salt to tie all the wonderful flavors together and I also added about a 1/3 cup cream to the sauce to make it a little creamy. This dish is extremely healthy, even when you add a little cream. It is sure to please any salmon-loving guests! Five stars!!!

This recipe was awesome!  I added 1/3 cup of cream as suggested by another review to the sauce, along with some cayenne, and it turned out very flavorful.  I also served it with seasoned rice instead of the pasta, to me fish goes better with rice, and with the sauce as spicy as it sounded, I just figured the flavors would go better with rice.  I made it for my boyfriend and another couple and they said it was definitely on the "Make again!" list.

We loved this dish.  We didn't have a fresh jalapeno, so we used can diced green chiles instead.  It didnt have the heat you would expect from using a fresh pepper, but was great none the less.

I saw so many five stars and I liked the ingredients so I figured this would be a hit. I followed the recipe to a tee and was disappointed. It just didn't have much flavor. My husband who is really good with flavors said it didn't blend well with the salmon. He also said, and I quote, "that was unsatisfying".

This was delicious!!!! But I added 1/3 cup heavy cream as some reviewers suggested - first I brought the other ingredients to a boil, then I added the cream and simmered for about 5 minutes.  I didn't mix in the fish juices either because I was worried about the lemon curdling the cream.  I also added a pinch of salt and a dash of cayenne pepper.

I loved this, but I have to admit, I did not follow the directions, mainly cuz I was in a huge hurry!  I ended up doing the sauce more like a alfredo....I left out the chicken broth, used about 1 - 2 cups cream and about a 1 cup cheese.  I sauted garlic, peppers, jalapenos, and cilantro in sauce pan, then added the cream and cheese along with a few good turns of fresh pepper and some lemon juice until melted. poured it over the cooked angel hair pasta and added some salmon on top.  It was yum!!  I will have to try it the original way next time as I am usually one that really dislikes when people rate the recipe after they have made changes...Sorry ;)  And thank you for this wonderful recipe!

It was OK, but I don't think I will make again.  It actually turned out really bland, which was surprising with the peppers and cilantro.  It was a lot of trouble and didn't taste as good as just cooking the salmon on the grill.

Served this to my in-laws and husband for a special meal and it got rave reviews! I saved time by using a bought jar of roasted red peppers. The flavor is wonderful, and if you are a fan of spice, I recommend using more jalapeño as we didn't notice the spice much, but it suited my mother-in-law perfectly! Quick and easy but tastes gourmet - can't get better than that!

Not bad, but needs way more sauce than the recipe calls for.  I decreased the amount of jalepeno fearing it might be too spicy for my 8-yr old, but I think I should have left it alone.  A bit too bland.

Sauce was bland, but the salmon was juicy.  Maybe adding some spices to the sauce will make it better but as is, only 3 stars.

I LOVED this recipe!  I asked my husband if he wanted any, and he said he didn't because he didn't feel like eating salmon.  So, I made it for myself.  Once I was done, my husband says, "Mmmm, that smells good."  So, I offer him a bite.  He steals my plate and takes another bite.  I looked at him and said, "Well, do you want me to make you a plate?"  I already knew the answer, so I went off to make him a plate of his own before he ate all mine!  I used jarred jalapenos instead of fresh (didn't have any fresh ones on hand), about a 1/3 cup fresh cream, yellow bell peppers instead of red, and fettuccine pasta instead of angel hair (I don't care for angel hair pasta). I accidentally left out the lemon juice but it still turned out great w/out it.  I also used sashimi grade salmon (I live in Japan).  I think having a good piece of salmon is key, otherwise it makes this dish too fishy.  It turned out great, and I'll definitely be making this again!

This sauce is really good. I would recommend using the sauce in other pasta recipes as well. It overpowers the salmon a little, so if you are looking for a recipe to cook good salmon with, this is not it. Do make the sauce for something else though!!

Very delicious, my boyfriend is in love and requests this all the time! I usually add too much jalapeno, so just give the sauce a little taste and make sure its a good spice level for you. I'm also not a fan of cilantro so i use basil with out any harm to the yummyness!

This is one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  I did not have all of the ingredients, so I substituted 2 tbsp of pesto for cilantro and rice pasta for angel hair.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.

I will definitely make this for company!

Extraordinary! I had a recipe idea in mind but used the red pepper sauce from this recipe and it was perfect! I used whole wheat penne, and I flaked the salmon. At the end I tossed the penne with the sauce and salmon and added lots of baby spinach, halved cherry tomatoes, and a few sliced olives.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and then used again later the same week to spruce up some plain pasta (no salmon this time). I'm sure I will use it again!

Good!! I kept wanting to add some Greek yogurt or sour cream or *something* creamy to the sauce, but decided to follow the recipe. If I make this again I think I will add something because the sauce, while very flavorful, just seemed like it was missing something. I think the tang from yogurt or sour cream would be perfect. Anywho, this was quite tasty as written. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti. Thanks :)

This gets a 5 star for the sauce. I was going to use it for salmon but the vacuum seal had broken on my salmon so it was freezer burnt so I had it with chicken breast instead, which was amazing! I couldnt imagine it over salmon and will not pair it with it ever but will stick with chicken and try it will halibut.

I'm no professional cook, but my good friend is.  I chose this recipe when I had her to dinner and even she was impressed!  Because I don't eat meat or fowl, I chose to replace the chicken broth with vegetable broth, with a delicious result.  It's also easy and fast (30 minutes tops), with minimal prep work, to boot!

This is one of my husband and my favorite recipes.  It takes a while if you roast the red peppers from scratch, but it is so tasty and looks and tastes really fancy.

I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I made some changes and it still tasted great! I cubed and sauteed some chicken with lemon juice instead of using salmon, then added the puree to the chicken and cooked them together. Instead of cilantro I used scallions and capers. I also added some milk like another reviewer suggested, and additional parmesan. I really liked this recipe and it took very little time. Next time I will try the original recipe. I'm sure it'll turn out even better than my adaptation! However, I'm happy to add both recipes (original and mine) to my recipe box.

Nice and easy to prepare a quality dinner. I did use the suggestion in several comments to add some half & half (fat free) and at the last minute I added some crushed red pepper flakes, but the sauce tasted fine without - I just like hot and spicy.

My husband loved this!!!  I too added cream (fat free half and half that it) and served it with whole wheat psta.  Yummy!  I also doubled the sauce as others suggested, which is a must.  Might add a little more jalapeno next time, and though we are salt fans, this didn't need any extra salt! Thanks!

Not bad but not great. At the heart of this recipe is the sauce but I didn't like it combined with the salmon and angel hair pasta.

Great recipe...I was a little skeptical as I was making it, as it didnt taste like much on its own. However, once it thickened and was tossed with pasta and Salmon, it was AWESOME. I tweaked it a bit for our taste, such as adding a bit of salt and pepper, and a bit more garlic. NOTICE: The recipe makes enough sauce to barely cover salmon and lightly coat the pasta. If you like extra sauce, double the recipe! Im going to try to make a large batch and see if it will freeze well...

Fun to make.  We really liked it.  I would make it a little spicier next time.  Use more jalepenos.

As written this is not very good. It is very bland. I used homemade broth and real parmesan so it needed a lot of salt. But I did not add cream to the sauce, so mb that would help with the taste. Just disappointed

Wow! After reading a few other reviews, I doubled the sauce recipe, and added some cream to it. I also served it over white rice instead of the pasta, and it was a huge hit!

This was awesome!! I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it was perfect! I wanted something light and healthy and this fit the bill!! I didn't add any heavy cream (as others suggested) because I felt that would add unwanted fat and calories and I certainly didn't feel like it was missing anything! My whole family loved it!

very easy and quick to make, and absolutely delicious! make sure to: 1) don't skimp on the cheese too much; 2) add salt; 3) cook the salmon until it is JUST done and not any longer! i also added a dash of rosemary for a nice kick. bon appetit!

This was amazing! I used a little more parmesan cheese and a bit more roasted red peppers. I also used the advice of someone esle and added a teaspoon of heavy cream after the sauce is removed from the heat. Try this! You will not be sorry!

Wasn't too crazy about this recipe, neither was the hubby. All I tasted in the sauce was cilantro, and I love cilantro. Also there wasn't enough of the sauce, if you're going to make this definately double the sauce.

We grilled the salmon, and it was great! We also didn't have cilantro, so I used some parsley and ground coriander.

This was delicious!! I found this when looking for low calorie recipes with a lot of flavor and this did not disappoint! I even forgot the cheese when I made it and it still tasted great and didn't seem like anything was missing. My husband saved the extra sauce to put on sandwiches, etc.. he liked it that much! It really could go on anything.

This was outstanding!  Super easy to make, and my guests were shocked that there was zero oil or butter in the sauce (ok, well, I added a splash of half & half at the very end, but it didn't even need it - was SO creamy on its own!).  I doubled the sauce ingredients as I was using a full pound of pasta to serve a crowd.  I suggest pulsing the blender to leave some chunks of red pepper and stirring in the cilantro later, after the sauce has thickened on the stove.  My dinner guests loved it!

I, personally, liked the dish just the way it was. The salmon goes really well with the sauce--which, in itself is amazing. I don't know why anyone would add anything to the sauce. My only thing with the sauce (which in my opinion, makes the dish) is that when the sauce sits for a while, it thickens up. I am not sure if this is the cheese, the cornstarch, or both but the sauce is best used right when it is made. And the sauce is so amazing. I am not much for spicy peppers but the amount of jalapeno in this dish gives you the flavor of the pepper without too much of its heat. I loved it.

Sauce is a bit bland without the salmon. I doubled the sauce and added a 1/2 cup of fat free half and half as well. This dish is best suited for adults, me and my sister thought it was more of a 3.5 while my mother loved it. I put lemon pepper & pepper on the salmon before grilling it on my George Foreman. I thought the sauce lacked oomph .. salt or more jalapeño pepper maybe? The cilantro was very good and did not overpower the taste of the sauce.

GREAT SAUCE!!! I think I made the Spanish (from Spain) version; We were all very concerned about mixing parmesan and cilantro, so I eliminated the jalapenos, and substituted flat leaf parsley for the cilantro. I then realized I had run out of Parmeggiano Reggiano, and had to substitute Manchego Cheese. I did add 1/4 cup of cream and doubled the amount of garlic. I served it over green spinach linguini as another reviewer had suggested. Beautiful dish... The best part is that my SUPER PICKY 2 1/2 year old GOBBLED IT UP (I served the sauce over shells for him)

Yummm.  I made this for my in-laws and everyone just loved it.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions as well.  I didn't use the blender, just chopped everything very well, I also added some cream to the sauce as well.  I just used one jalepeno and could barely taste it.  If I hadn't been also serving to my kids (1 & 3) I would have tried a bit more.  Also used bow tie pasta.  Served with roasted asparagus and some good bread.  Delish!  I can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

I didn't entirely stick to the recipe - added more cheese, a little heavy cream, and I just diced the sauce ingredients finely instead of blending - but I'm still giving it 5 stars because it's rare that Husband takes a bite of something, and actually puts his fork down, smiling, because it tastes SO good. Awesome, Christine. Thanks a bunch!

This recipe was not that great.  It just tasted like the salmon didn't belong with the pasta.  It had a weird after taste.  I won't be making this again!

This recipe is what I love so much about this site;  I was looking for something new to do with salmon, and I was craving pasta.  Sooo......I searched for "Salmon Pasta" and found this recipe!    I did add a little heavy cream to the sauce.  Delish!

This is a restaurant quality recipe! The second time  I switched the pasta for garlic mashed potatoes, and added a little more parmesan and jalapeno. It's our favorite dish to serve for company since it takes so little time to prepare.

This is a great recipe! I was afraid the juices from the salmon would make the sauce too fishy, but it was very well camouflage by the other ingredients.  I am not very partial to cilantro and it is domineering, but still very tasty.  I will make it again but with a little more jalapeno.

This roasted red pepper sauce is fabulous!  I was afraid that the salmon would be a little bland, but the sauce made it delicious. The dish presented beautifully as well.

Wow, this is a keeper.  I read some of the other reviews and added a little heavy cream at the end but I'm not sure it was needed.  Next time I will follow the recipe exactly.  Very easy to make. Try it!

This recipe has good potential but not enough flavor. Needs at least double the sauce. If I make again I will probably triple the sauce and quadruple the jalapeños.

I hesitated a bit before choosing this recipe because I had a hard time imagining parmesan cheese with the more southwestern flavors of cilantro and jalapeno, however the sauce was excellent!  Only changes were to use whole wheat linguini and add a package of cooked frozen cauliflower, broccoli and carrots to up the veggies.  The salmon is basically steamed, yielding tender and moist fish.  All in all, a fabulous recipe - definite keeper!

I found the sauce to be a bit thin, but maybe it just didn't quite thicken properly.  And if I made it again I might just chop the red peppers and not blend them as I would have liked a more textured sauce.

Absolutely delicious, and the sauce is SO versatile.  I had everything on hand expect the cilantro, but I bet it would be even better with it.  To give it some color, I added some chopped spinach to the sauce as it cooked down.  Delicious!  This had just the right about of heat from the jalapenos.  I didn't bother to add 1/2 and 1/2 as some suggested.  As good as a cream sauce may have been, it doesn't need it.  The only change I might make next time is to broil the salmon to give it that nice firm flakiness.  Baking is left the color a little weak.

Made this on a whim to since I had all the ingredients on hand and wanted to try something different.  I roasted a pepper that needed to be used right away - sliced, cleaned and placed skin side up under the broiler for 12-15 minutes, until the skin began to blister and blacken.  I put the hot pepper in a glass dish, covered with another dish and left for 15 minutes, then peeled.  There may be better methods, but this was a no-fuss first attempt and worked great.  Added a splash of heavy cream at the end after removing from the heat.  Great recipe.

Tasty and easy dish! I made it for just two people so there was no need to double the sauce (but agree you should double if you have more than two people). I added cut asparagus when I put the sauce on the burner and it turned out perfect. Also used small linguini, extra jalapenos, broiled my own red peppers, added salt/white pepper to the pasta water, 1/4 cup NF half/half just before serving and included rosemary focaccia bread. My husband cleaned his plate (and so did I)!

This was wonderful.  Let me just say to please add the stated amount of cilantro.  I love cilantro so I thought more = better.  Not so...the taste was overpowering.  Next time I will go easy on it.  Loved the recipe.  Thank-you!

This was so delicious! I didn't add cream like some other users did, but I thought it was great as is. I'm on an anti-inflammatory diet so I made this with spaghetti squash instead of pasta. Will definitely be making this again, especially the sauce!

This turned out amazingly well. I used fresh red peppers that I grilled first, and grilled the salmon as well. The sauce had a nice zip to it, and a freshness that I do not normally find with other pasta sauces I have made.

Excellent!  I also used twice as much sauce.  I omitted the jalapenos since my kids don't like spicy food, and there was still plenty of flavor.  It was also fairly easy to make.  My mother-in-law stopped by and tried some and was impressed, too!  Thanks!

I love salmon, roasted red peppers and pasta, but the combination of the three just didn't do it for me.  Except for adding a splash of cream to the sauce, I followed the recipe as written.  I personally wouldn't serve this dish again.

Great flavor; you don't have to use a blender, just use sauteed red peppers chopped fine.  Can use lower heat for the salmon.

This was delicious. Like something from a restaurant. Very spicy! Next time I will only use half of the jalepeno. My husband suggested that it would taste good with chicken too, so next time we'll try that. I also substituted bow-tie pasta for the angelhair, and that worked beautifully but next time I'll cook 10-12 oz of that instead of 8 oz, as I didn't have very much to go around. One last tip: use freshly grated Parmesan cheese (not the stuff in the can) for cooking with, it makes a world of difference.

This was lovely!  Tasty and beautiful.  I served it up on black square plates (Target) and it was gorgeous.

I used wild-caught Alaska salmon and substituted "spaghettini" for angel hair, as I felt the robust flavors called for a slightly more "robust" pasta.

I wasn't wild about this dish. My boyfriend loved it though, so it may just be my individual tastes. The sauce just didn't seem to go with a pasta dish in my opinion. It was almost...Mexican. I added cream as well, maybe about 1/4 cup; maybe I would have liked it better if I had added more like some of the other reviewers did. Thanks for the recipe, though!

pretty good but it could have used some other flavors besides just the red pepper.  It was somehow overpowering and bland all at once.

I like red peppers. I found out I do not like them as a pasta sauce. Think about whether you would like that taste before you make this pasta. I hated it. I gave it three stars because my boyfriend liked it a lot.

This recipe was SO GOOD!! I made it for my boyfriend, and 3 of our friends and they all loved it. Only problem was it didn't make enough for the four of us and I changed the recipe to make enough for 6!

This was very tasty! You need to remember to not make more pasta than the 8 ounces, otherwise you don't have enough sauce.

SOOO good.  My husband and I agree it's restaurant quality.  I don't even care that much for salmon unless it's grilled, but I love this dish. The kick from the peppers is great.

This was very good.  I took a previous reviewer suggestions and nervously grilled the salmon on my George Foreman grill.  I served the salmon pasta with steamed green beans.  I will fixed this recipe over and over again.  I left out the cilantro.  Going to have to try it sometime with it.

JC says: "The cilantro, the jalepeno, the salmon, the pasta....I thought it was great! A nice, subtle, light summer dish."
My boyfriend and I agree that this was delicious and easy to make, and goes well with a nice spinach salad and a Guiness. Or two.

Wonderful! I used hot red pepper sauce instead of jalapenos and the heat in the sauce took out all of the biting salmon flavor I normally don't care for much.  Strong cilantro flavor which I liked.  Will definitely make again.

Tastes awesome. However, for a perfectionist who likes to roast his own peppers, it takes a little time. But this one is certainly going in my recipe box. In fact, when I need to stir this up quickly, I just might get the roasted peppers from my grocer!

A good dish with a unique, easy-to-make, healthy pasta sauce.  Don't be afraid to add a little more of the jalapeno for more of a kick.  Wasn't as spicy as I had hoped; cilantro seemed to dominate sauce.

It has just the right amount of spiciness(word?).  It was awesome, a great alternative to spaghetti and meatballs or broiled Salmon.

Thanks.

We found this recipe so flavorful, easy, and healthy as written we knew it was a keeper right away.  I've made several times since tweeking it to our tastes and we found we prefer quinoa to the paste, basil instead of cilantro, and a couple tablespoons of capers are a must.

This was really yummy! I made it to surprise my husband as a welcome home dinner. The salmon took closer to 20 minutes to cook, but it could because my oven dates back to I love lucy.  :)  Really yummy dish and it made my kitchen smell wonderful!  Made chocolate covered strawberries for dessert.  PERFECT.

I didn't have jalepenos so I used half a spanish pepper, which was way too hot so I 'had' to add some cream which really balanced out the sauce. It was SO good, we fought over the leftovers. I added some salmon spice and baked them uncovered. So, so good and so easy! Thank you!!!

I htought this recipe was great! Really easy to make and very tasty. The only chnages I made was that I marinated the salmon in Italian dressing before cooking it. I also added about a clove of garlic to the puree mix.

Great Recipe!  The Salmon came out Perfect!  I sprinkled the cilantro on top of the Salmon before cooking and I did add a pat of butter and a bit of cream to the sauce.  I also used a multi-grain pasta.  Will be using this recipe again!  Thanks!

Swa this in the recent reviews & I had a leftover piece of grilled salmon so I gave it a try. I cut the recipe in half only I used a full cup of chicken broth beacsue that's how much I had in the fridge. The salmon I used was sprinkled w/ jalapeno salt before grilling & it worked very well in this recipe. I just sprinkled it w/ some fresh lemon juice, chunked it up some & added it to the sauce to reheat. I topped the pasta w/ romano cheese...both the grands & myslef really enjoyed our lunch...thanks!

This had a great flavor. I didn't serve it with pasta or any starch (no, I'm not a "low-carber;" I just prefer to eat seafood with veggies), so I cut the amount of (vegetable) broth to 1/2 cup to make the sauce thicker and intensify the flavor. The deli was out of Parmesan, so I used freshly grated Romano--yum! I could barely taste the jalapeno, which for this dish was just right. I served it with Kristi's Corn Salad from this site, and it was a delicious combination.

I wasn't quite sure how the chillies were going to go with the salmon, but I have to say that I really enjoyed it. The sauce was delicious.

I also did the meal with couscous rather than pasta and it worked well too.

The only change I made was to serve the salmon with cous cous when some friends came over, and it went brilliantly too.

Awesome recipe!  Much like dishes I've had at Carrabba's or J.Alexander's.  I, like others, added some 1/2 & 1/2 to the sauce (maybe 1/3 cup).  Wonderful!

I love this recipe!  It is easy, healthy, and full of flavor.  Even my husband who doesn't really like fish loves it!

This was an excellent recipe.  I skipped cilantro (not a fan) but it turned out great.  Sauce should be doubled for 4 people though, this was just the right amount for 2 people.  Tasty!

I give it 12 stars!  I even used 1 cup of red bell pepper (not roasted), 2 whole garlic cloves (not minced), 1/4 cup of dried cilantro, and 4 teaspoons of sliced jalapenos (not minced) and it turned out great!

Was not overly thrilled with this dish. It was okay -- nothing special. I may try it with grilled chicken next time, or with grilled salmon, to see if I like it better.

Despite of good combination of ingredients and distinctive cooking method, the flavor of this dish just doesn't give a good impression as I thought it would be (I suppose I expected too much once everybody said that this dish is restaurant quality).  The texture of cooked salmon seems not done enough, and the dish overall, is flavorless and needs lots of salt.  However, the red pepper sauce is unique and can be used in other dish to complement the meal.

Very flavorful, though I did omit the cilantro because I realized too late that I was out.  I think next time I would add a corn starch slurry to the boiling sauce rather than mixing the cornstarch in.

The sauce is delicious!  I'm of Mexican descent and the cilantro and jalapenos, along with the roasted red peppers really made it a hit for me!  It's an explosion of flavors I love!  I'll definitely be making this again and plan on sharing it with my sister , as well.  Thank you!

I had this beautiful piece of fresh Atlantic salmon in my fridge and I was looking to create a pasta dish with it. This sauce is way too strong for the fish, taking away from it's flavor. It would have been better with some type of (white-)fish.

This is a great recipe and so easy to make.  The only changes I made was to add the capers as was suggested by another reviewer and I added a healthy dollop of lactose free sour cream to make the sauce creamier.  I would suggest this sauce if you are planning  to entertain as it can be made the day before and then reheated so there would be very little mess to clean up after the meal.  Douglas Craig

I had to omit the garlic and I added a little cornstarch/water at the end to thicken the sauce.  It was very good and it made a LOT.

Interesting. Not bad, but will not be saving this one as a must try. 

Very healthy alternative to smothering it in a sauce or cheese. 
I added some extra veggies to the puree and chose to use mushroom tortellini instead. Was a nice change from the usual, while keeping calories low.

I agree this sauce is bland & I even added little extra
jalapeno, dab of cream cheese &  bit of milk.    I also
agree this sauce does not complement salmon.  Will
not make this again..

Followed as directed. Very good, family enjoyed and made suggestions to make a few adjustments in ingredient amounts. Worthwhile to save for future dinner ideas.

Was really a great flavor.  Giving 4 stars because the recipe as-is needs salt.  Based on other reviews, I added salt and pepper to the salmon before cooking and also a dash to the sauce.  Didn't have jalapeño so I used a dash of cayenne instead.

I mixed things up a little...Blended 1 fresh red bell pepper, 1 full jalapeno w/ seeds, 10 cherry tomatos, cilantro and cornstarch.  Added to chicken broth and boiled down. Aslo add some garlic salt to taste (I did about 1 tsp) 

Grilled the salmon on the bbq (or could use left over salmon)

Added fresh grated parmesan cheese to sauce just long enough to melt

Served over angel hair pasta

Pretty good.  I loved the flavor of the sauce!  Used whole wheat angel hair.
