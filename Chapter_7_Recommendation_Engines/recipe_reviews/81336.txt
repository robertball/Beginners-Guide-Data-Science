Yummy... obviously you can add or subtract ingredients to your preference to this.. I thinly sliced plum tomatoes and layered on top before baking (just because it sounded good) LOL.  Nice change of pace from traditional pizza.

very good pizza!  I made 2 of them for a pary, and on one of them added less cheese since it seemed like a lot.  My guests preferred the one with less cheese.

I added red onion, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and red bell pepper to this recipe and it was WONDERFUL!!! I did make a homemade crust from the bread machine which helped also.

At last, someone else allergic to tomatoes! I was allergic to them too, for about 5 years in high school/college... thankfully I grew out of it. This is a great combination for pizza. For those who prefer more sauce, a simple white sauce can be made sauteing flour in melted butter to make a roux, then adding a couple cups of broth and stirring until thickened. Flavor with garlic, herbs or anything (even dijon mustard!).

This was a delicious recipe! I changed some of the toppings, but this was one of the best Pizza's I ever made. I also used a Rosemary & Herb dough, prepared from Fresh & Easy. And that really added to the flavor of the pizza. I will def be keeping this recipe! This is great for parties as well!

This was a great recipe. I added chicken that I had slow boiled in some garlic powder and italian seasoning and it was delicious. I will certainly make again. My only change was to use lots of minced garlic in a jar instead of the whole garlic cloves. I will certainly follow the recipe next time for the full effect.

Great taste and healthy. I miss the sauce as it seemed a littly dry to me. I recommend a side of marinara sauce for dipping.

Oh, I REALLY like this!  I'm not a big white pizza fan, but this pizza is wonderful.  I love the flavor of the garlic and the olives--sharp flavors and makes it hard to miss the red sauce (which I LOVE)!  I made French bread dough over the weekend for French bread, but didn't end up making it.  So I used that dough in this pizza.  I baked the dough for about 20 min at 350, then added toppings and baked per the recipe.  I didn't measure the olive oil, but I didn't put that much on.  You just need enough to brush it on, and it's perfect.  I also roasted the garlic over the weekend, so I didn't use any of the oil from my garlic.  Thanks for this recipe!  Loved it!  :o)

This makes a really good appetizer!  A little bit oily so you could consider using less olive oil.  The roasted garlic is fantastic so you don't want to skimp on it!

This is the best white pizza ever! I have made it twice, using my own pizza crust. The first time I roasted the garlic I just drizzled some oil over the garlic . The second time I read the directions and used 5 tablespoons. I think 2 would suffice. No matter, this recipe rocks! Thank you!

Very good....gourmet like.  I didn't add all the cheese.....sauteed some mushrooms & onions in olive oil and added this before sprinkling the green olives on it.  Great dish!  Easy but tastes like you spent a lot of time on it!

I love olives more than you can imagine, but this pizza actually had a few too many for me.  It has a good overall flavor.  If I made it again I would combine a little cream cheesed with the garlic infused oil, cut the amount of olives in half, and add some chopped chicken.

Great pizza! With an Italian cheese blend not much is needed to kick up this recipe. To cut down the cooking time further I purchased pre-roasted garlic cloves from my local Whole Foods.

We both loved this "adult pizza".  Used a Mama Mary's thin pizza crust available at Walmart.  I put the cheese on before the olives and added the garlic, a small amount of red onion and a few canned mushrooms.  Can't wait to have this again.  It was even better the next day for lunch.  Baked for 8-10 min at 400 degrees and it was perfect.

I didn't roast the garlic beforehand. I sliced and placed them on top of the pizza and baked it like that. Still tasty.

this was deeeelish! i also used marinara sause to dip.

Ok so for those of you like me who buy minced garlic and have never roasted a blub before... do NOT roast minced garlic. no bueno! I tried that and it burned to a crisp. luckily, i had a bulb on hand so i could have a do-over.

Best thing is to put in a muffin tin. :)

I was not really expecting much from this pizza but I was pleasantly surprised! It was filling and very tasty. I would make again. I did cut way back on the olive oil (about 2T) and that was plenty. Very yummy, will make again.

Didn't have enough garlic flavor for me, and it was a little too greasy.

Delicious.  Great mix of flavors.  next time though I plan on roasting 2 heads of garlic.
