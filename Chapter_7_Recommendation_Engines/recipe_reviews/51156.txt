We loved this recipe!  I made homemade green sauce (look for a recipe for salsa verde...it's really easy to make), and the trick to keeping the corn tortillas from falling apart is to dip them briefly in hot oil in a pan (drain them on paper towels on a plate after doing this).  It's tricky, but it makes the tortillas flexible enough to roll.  Will probably make more salsa verde to use on them next time, too.
Edited on 1/3/09:  Making the separate enchiladas became too much of a hassle, so now I make this as a casserole (layering the spinach, the cheese/sour cream, and the corn tortillas, ending with the sauce on top).  Much easier, and we make it more often now! Yum!

This recipe was AMAZING.  No Joke.  I made it for my family tonight (I'm 19), and everyone loved them.  I don't follow recipes too well though, I'm pretty sure I added a lot more cheese than called for.  I also ran out of green sauce for the top and was too lazy to go to the store so I made some more up with just regular salsa and made stripes on top and it looked great and tasted really well also.  Like the previous reviewer though, my tortillas fell apart a little so next time I may try frying them in oil a little before hand.  I really didn't mind them falling apart though because it tasted the same.  But yeah, I registered on this site just so I could write a review for this recipe.  That's how good it is....so go make it...now.

Ok, actually I'd give this 3 1/2 stars. I followed the recipe as written but since I couldn't find a mild green salsa, I increased the sour cream a bit to cut the heat.

The corn tortillas taste great but are a pain to work with. They unroll and tear. I tried putting them seam side down and that didn't work either. Whoever suggested making this as layered enchiladas was smart! 

I like spinach, but I did find these a bit too spinachy. If I make this again, I'd probably add chicken and/or beans and maybe some corn or mushrooms or something.

The sour cream/salsa mix is tasty. The monterrey jack cheese is also excellent.

Bottom line: I suggest adding more things to the filling and layering rather than rolling the tortillas.

So good, so easy. Perfect winter comfort food! I followed it almost as is except I stir fried 1 1/2 onion + 1/2 a red pepper + 1 cup of mushrooms with some cumin powder, salt, pep, paprika, garlic powder and chili powder. I also added half a finely diced jalapeno pepper to the salsa verde/sour cream mixture as the salsa I bought was mild and I like spice. After adding the sauce to the tortilla, I spooned some of the stir fried veggies, then I added the spinach + cheese and a bit more sauce. Cooked for the time stated. I can't wait to make these again! I'm a vegetarian and haven't enchiladas since I quit meat (1 yr ago!!!) because I didn't think veggie ones would compare, boy was I wrong! BTW I added much more salsa verde sauce then called for, almost double.

Made a few changes in that we used low fat yogurt instead of sour cream and added some shredded roasted chicken in with the spinach.  It was fantastic!  The flavors blend perfectly, the Salsa Verde and the yogurt made a delicious sauce.  We did not roll our enchiladas but stacked them instead in a round casserole dish and in the order of tortilla, sauce, spinach, chicken, cheese and repeat.  Then poured the remaining sauce on the top of the last tortilla and added the remaining cheese.  It's much faster to prepare that way and doesn't take away from the taste of the dish in anyway.  This recipe is a keeper, thanks for sharing it!

Yummy! This stuff is GOOD!  Also GREAT reviews from my fiance.  Followed the ingredients for the most part (except using a different type of tortilla) but got off a little on the propotions.   Didn't have bunches of spinach, only baby spinach in a bag.  Ended up using twelve ounces light sour cream, sixteen ounces Herdez Salsa Verde, two six-ounce bags of baby spinach, and two cups of shredded cheese.  Used multi-grain wraps (NOT whole wheat, which I find dry); love the multi-grain...they add texture but don't taste heavy or gummy; always use them for enchiladas.  Followed the directions except for the bright idea to wilt the sliced spinach in the microwave just to make it easier to handle.  Well, I ended up having to blot and squeeze and squeeze and blot.  You get the picture.  Another reviewer mentioned watery...so maybe a good thing in the end, as all of the water I squeezed out of the spinach would have cooked out into the dish.  We will fer sure make this again, maybe adding onions or shredded spiced chicken; using pepper jack cheese.

Excellent recipe, my husband and I both loved it! I've aded sauteed mushrooms and onions, as someone suggested, and it turned out great! This recipe also works great with chicken (I use rotisserie or simply boil a chicken breast), instead of spinach.

To follow up: the tortillas tend to fall apart when rolled. To eliminate this problem, heat up oil in a frying pan, and quickly dip tortillas in the hot oil before rolling them up.

We're trying to eat vegetarian and this recipe was a hit, from my pure Texan husband to my 4 year old and 2 year old twins.  Really tasty.  I served it with Mexican rice, beans, and guacamole.  Yummy, quick, easy, economical, and healthy.  This is definitely a keeper for us.

Excellent flavor, followed other reviewers' advice and added some more flavor to filling -- cumin, dried onion flakes, and a lot more garlic -- it was so easy and very good. I served it with Mexican rice, made in a rice cooker, it was the perfect combination. I'll be making this one again and again.

The green sauce was so delicious!  It had just the right tang to it.  I would have given it five stars, but my husband said that it had a little too much spinach for his taste (personally I disagree), but maybe next time I'll sautee some mushrooms in too or add more cheese.  Also, my corn tortillas fell apart a little -- not sure why, if I just packed them in too tight or what.

Made these for dinner tonight and they were wonderful!!  I made a few changes to lower the calories and fat as I am on a diet.  I made my own corn tortillas, used fat free sour cream, weight watchers mexican cheese and didn't have fresh spinach so I used frozen thawed and squeezed dry.  It changed the calories to only 140 each and the fat grams to 3 each!!  Will make these again!!

Very tasty with sooo many possibilities to play with. As with most other review, preheat the tortillas with spray Pam and a hot pan, or the hot-oil dip to soften and help prevent them from tearing. I usually am short on time so I prefer the casserole layers method. I also use a mix of cheeses-- queso, pepper-jack and sharp cheddar with my Monterey Jack--- We LOVE CHEESE. And most stores sell the pre-grated cheese blends, too. Shredded rotissarie chicken layers truly completes this meal for those non-vegan's out there. Even using the "non-traditional" flour tortillas, rolled up and sprayed with Pam, baked until browned and crisp is another way to enjoy this basic "verde" enchilada. This recipe gives a good base to develop so many savory variation... I encourge everyone to add there own "flair". I don't think I've made two enchiladaa verdes the same, but each has been wonderful

I admire your use of "light" sour cream, but an even better choice, if you can find it, is "crema," a thin Mexican sour cream you can make yourself by putting yogurt culture (a tablespoon of plain will do) into milk and letting it sit for a few hours.  Also, as one of the reviewers complains that the corn tortillas tear and are hard to work with, I suggest that you "prep" the tortiallas in the traditional Mexican way: dip each one at a time into hot oil (canola is OK, though Mexicans would use lard), but only for a second or two, using tongs to dip in and out.  Then let them drain a bit on a cookie sheet covered with paper towels.  Another thing I admire is your use of *corn* tortillas, since no self-respecting Mexican -- or Texican for that matter -- would use flour tortillas.  These were introduced into the Mexican diet only recently and nobody down there uses them for enchiladas.  The very idea is totally abhorrent!

Delicious, if not precisely what I was expecting. ^_^    I used 2 packages of frozen spinach since the bunches of spinach were pretty grody-looking at my grocery store, thawed and drained, and I could have stood to use more. Light sour cream, 2 cans mild green enchilada sauce, plus 1 can black beans and 3 shredded chicken breasts baked with black pepper, garlic powder and red pepper.     I made this casserole style. Coated the bottom with sour cream/sauce mixture, laid down a layer of corn tortillas, then spinach, chicken, beans, rest of sour cream/sauce mixture, cheese (Mexican-style shredded 4 cheese blend), then more tortillas, sauce and cheese.     My tortillas were a little mushy when it was done, but I think my spinach wasn't drained well and I might have used a little too much sauce. Honestly the soft texture didn't bother us because it gave it that casserole texture where everything is soft and mixed together, almost like quiche or a mashed potato casserole.     There was literally no spice whatsoever to my dish since all I had was mild green chile sauce, but the flavor was delicious and unique and wasn't lacking in interest, so we didn't miss the fact that it wasn't spicy.    My fiance noted that you wouldn't necessarily think to combine those ingredients in a Mexican casserole, but that it was surprisingly compatible and a serious stick-to-your-ribs dinner. Which was good since I forgot to make Mexican rice for a side dish like I'd planned. ^_^

This is a very good recipe!!! It tasted so good and my family loved it! I did have to do the lasanga style that some people mentioned in other comments, because it was easier than frying the tortilla so it could bend. Im under 18 and i still could make it in less than 10 minutes. (not including bake time). Overall I think it is a healthy, easy alternative to regular chicken enchiladas that satisfies like one.

Absolutely Wonderful!!!!   I added some Guacamole to the sour cream/Verde mixture for a little extra punch.  Also put tomatoes, mushrooms, black olives, and onion in the enchilada with the cheese and spinach and served with black beans.  Will definately make again!!!!

Hint to those having trouble with the corn tortillas breaking or tearing, before stuffing wrap 2 or 3 at a time in damp paper towels and microwave for about 15-20 seconds.  That will soften them (they will be hot, so let them sit for a minute before handling.)

I followed the recipe as directed. And used the suggestion of 1 of the reviewers: I dipped each of the tortillas in oil for less than 3 seconds & that prevented the tortillas from falling apart. I didn't even use toothpicks. I've made this recipe twice. The second time I made it, I didn't realize I had no sour cream anymore, so I used 2 tablespoons of mayo & the recipe was still delicious! Also, since I like salsa a lot, I added a bit more salsa on top of the enchiladas & oh, man, it was so good!

I haven't tried this, but sound delicious.  I had trouble with corn tortillas & used to use the oil fry method, but am now married to a Latin.  After all these years & the extra calories all you have to do is put them over a hot burner & turn them until their warm...flexible & easy to work with...no more broken tortillas....

For a not-so-authentic enchilada, it sure has an authentic taste!  I've made these several times now, once with green salsa and the other using green enchilada sauce.  Either way, they were delish.  I like to bake them about 30 minutes so the corn tortillas get crisp around the edge.  They can be difficult to roll since they're not dipped in oil, but I've learned not to wrap them so tight.

I was reading the reviews to see what others thought and I came across one that talked about how hard it was to roll the tortillas.  If you put them in the microwave for a couple of minutes, I ususally do it for four, they roll very easy and stay put.  Use can also dip them quickly in hot canola oil to make them easier to roll.

Definately cook your spinach first! I think that was the problem with the tortillas falling apart -- too much liquid!  Also, if you heat your totillas slightly in the microwave before rolling them they will be much easier to handle and not tear so easily.  I like the recipe, but will also add some other veggies to it next time - onions, mushrooms, beans and maybe corn.  I had never thought to use spinach in enchiladas before.

To those who had trouble with the tortillas tearing:  Most enchilada recipes call for either heating the sauce and then dipping each tortilla into the sauce before filling to soften and/or you heating some vegetable oil in a skillet and dip the corn tortillas into the hot oil (don't let it begin to fry) to soften also.  Or just use soft, flour tortillas.

The recipe itself was very tasty, but I can only give it 4 stars as written. 7 ounces of salsa is nowhere near enough. I'm also confused as to what a 10 ounce package of tortillas is supposed to be (what diameter? I'm assuming 6 tortillas since 6 servings, but this is not the most intuitive way of describing). I also didn't use nearly that much cheese nor do I think it necessary. I used baby spinach and instead of slice, I took handfuls and crumpled/tore to get a nice sized pile for each enchilada. I ended up using 'taco sized' whole wheat tortillas by Mission. Yes they were flour, I know I know. However, because they were simply rolled, I had no problems with breaking/tearing at all. Didn't have to warm them or anything. I also confess, I added some shredded chicken. I just needed to add some protein to the meal. I'm not entirely sure how much spinach/salsa/sour cream I ended up using inside the enchiladas, but to 1/2 cup sour cream I certainly added more than 3.5 oz of green salsa. I think I should have added more, too; the sauce was a good base to let the tortillas soak up, but was very mild. I also put a lot more than 3.5 oz on top. Just buy a 16oz jar or so and use what you like. I'll make it again with my changes, no question, so thank you for the recipe anyway!

Wow!  I would have given this 5 stars, but I changed a few things to suit my family's tastes.  That said, this is a fabulous one to play with!!  

I shredded rotisserie chicken and added chopped fresh cilantro, mushrooms, and thinly diced onions - YUM!!  Then, I doubled the salsa - mixing 2 (7oz) cans of Herdez Salsa Verde with 1 C sour cream - and mixed about 1/2 of that in with my chicken mixture.  Oh, I also added the shredded MJ cheese directly to the chicken mixture.

Divide the filling evenly among 10 whole grain (corn is too difficult to work with) tortillas and roll them up.  Spread remaining salsa mixture over the top of rolls and cook for 20 minutes at 350.  

I served with spanish rice and got rave reviews from my DH!!

These are awesome. In regards to a previous review, these are not too "spinachy". As far as handling corn tortillas, simply heat a griddle and cook tortillas approximately 15-20 seconds on each side and then place on a covered plate. This makes them soft and pliable. (If a recipe is changed dramatically, e.g., not using a primary ingredient such as green sauce in this particular recipe, everyone should be skeptical of rating).

I made this a few nights ago for my family, and no one could get enough of it.  I boiled chicken breasts and shredded them and added it to the tortillas and they came out very good. (My dad believes that a meal isn't complete without some sort of meat.)  I also doubled the amount of sour cream and salsa verde mixture.  This recipe is great as is, but is very easily changed to cater to your particular tastes.  I will definately be making this again!

I've made this dish a few times and it's turned out very well everytime.  Sometimes I use plain yogurt instead of sour cream to give this dish a tangy flavor and to lighten it up a bit. Also mushrooms go really well with the spinach and give some added flavor to the dish.

Spicy, and very tasty. I used cheddar instead of monterey jack, and it turned out well. The only thing I would recommend is to grease the baking dish. I didn't and even with the layer of enchilada sauce I ended up with everything stuck tight to the bottom, and falling apart when I tried to scoop it out.

These are yummy! You don't need to put the corn tortillas in hot oil in order to roll them. Just wrap in a barely damp paper towel and heat in the microwave till fairly warm. They will roll right up with no tearing.

I thought these tasted good but My Hubster said they were excellent.  I did have to take off a start bc I found some of the measurements and directions to be off.  The recipe calls for you to mix together half the salsa and sour cream but then it is not totally clear how you were to use it.  it says to fill the tortilla with some sour cream and salsa but does that mean the mixture or the reserved ingredients.  I decided to mix all the salsa and sour cream together and use it that way.  put a bit in the bottom, used some to fill the tortillas then poured the rest over top and that seemed to work.  Also it called for a bunch of spinach.  While I am sure "a bunch" ranges form grogery store to grocery store I found this to be WAY too much.  I would say half a bunch as my tortillas were filled up and I have tons of leftover shredded spinach.  Also if you put the rolled tortillas seam side down there is no need to secure with a toothpick so save the time and the trees.  since it was a hit with the MR I will be making again but with these changes.

This is really yummy.  I followed others' advice and sauteed onions, mushrooms, and frozen white corn.  I sprayed with non stick spray and layered corn tortillas, spread on some salsa/sour cream mix, spread some spinach, then the sauteed veggies and 1/2 of the cheese.  Made another layer of everything, ending with the cheese and baked.  Total winner, my two teenagers liked it and my husband said it was delicious.  Will certainly make again!

My husband and I loved it!  I just added sauteed mushrooms with the spinach to bulk them up some.  Also, used much more salsa to keep them saucy and an extra layer of sour cream with the salsa and cheese on top of the rolled enchiladas to keep them moist.  Delicious!!

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe, but it was so much better than I expected!  I used lowfat plain yogurt in place of sour cream.  I wanted something a little more substantial than spinach and cheese, so I also added white beans to the mix.  I used red salsa as that's what I had on hand - I thought that with the spinach might ruin it but it was great.   I will say - I didn't even try to feed this to my picky preschoolers.  They got quesadillas.

They key to not having the tortilla fall apart is to keep the tortilla at room temperature and gently roll..have been doing this recipe for years and never had to risk dipping the tortilla in HOT oil...

YES these were muy delicioso!!  Sure I tweaked the recipe based on what I had in (whisked a dollop of sour cream w/ red salsa to make a pretty pinkish sauce), BUT the concept came from this recipe, so 5 stars!  Tasted great, and even the non-spinach eaters devoured!! Thanks! :D

Kudos!  Great quick weeknight recipe.  I just added some pre-grilled chicken to the filling and the kids and BF loved it!  Thank you for the recipe!  I found putting a few corn tortillas between paper towels and nuking them in the microwave for about 20 seconds helped keep them intact to roll them up.

Yum! I have been making a similar version with chicken and without spinach for years and they are my family's favorite, but I have been trying for us all to eat more veggies and this is a winner! We don't really like cooked spinach but it was masked. I did add some shredded rotisserie chicken so I didn't have to hear too much grumbling. And for those that have a hard time with breaking tortillas, here is what I always do:  Heat the tortillas in the microwave. I have a "tortilla oven" that I found at a co. fair but is also available online...great, cheap investment! (Or heat in plastic package, turning and rotating frequently.) Older tortillas can be made pliable by soaking one tortilla in water before heating tortillas together in the tortilla oven or the package. The point is to get the tortillas steamy. Occasionally, I will also heat the sauce to a simmer before spreading on both sides of each tortilla. Might be over-kill but it is better than cracked tortillas.

I have made nearly this same recipe for years. I rated this recipe version 4 stars because you have to soften the tortillas first, otherwise, they fall apart. You can easily do this by either soaking them in some heated green sauce several at a time, then filling them with spinach and cheese; or, you can microwave half of the package in wax paper or paper towel for about 20/30 seconds prior to filling them.  I also add some extra cumin, garlic and black beans.  Delicious!!!

I made half of the pan with corn tortillas and half with flour, and while the corn had good flavor, the flour held up better. I also didn't have anywhere near enough sauce to have anything to pour over the top, so I had to improvise with a can of red enchilada sauce I had in the pantry. Next time, I'd double the sour cream/salsa mixture, since that sauce would have tasted better.

This recipe is fantastic! I used half the sour cream, and PC brand tomatillo salsa. If you're in Ontario, Canada, I would strongly recommend getting that salsa for this recipe. There's no easy way you could equal the flavour with a homemade salsa verde.

Decided to follow some of the other reviews and add mushrooms, onion and green pepper to stuff in the enchiladas.  Delicious!  Had no problems with the spinach though I stuffed baby spinach in whole.  Yummy!

This had better be good! That's what I thought when I was making this. It was yummy after all but trying to wrap the corn tortillas; oil or no oil is ridiculous! I agree with others who recommend layering instead.

The recipe is delicious just as it is and two tortillas per serving are quite filling.  I made a few minor tweaks:  non-fat sour cream, a light mexican cheese blend, fresh tomatillos and homemade enchilada sauce to cover.  I loved this recipe:  easy preparation, you can control the fat without sacrificing the flavor, and there are endless vegetable & chili variations to use.

This was so yummy! I'm sure it was partly due to the sales I bought (Frontera), but this was so simple to assemble & so tasty!!!!! Will add this to my regular rotation!

So good.  We get bunches of spinach from our local food coop on a regular basis and I needed something new to do with them.  My husband has requested that we use this recipe whenever we have spinach in the house.   I did follow a few suggestions of adding sauteed onion and using 2 cans of salsa.

This is a great basic recipe for a vegetable enchiladas. I added the following and it came out delicious! I used flour tortillas and popped them in the microwave wraped in paper towels for about 25 sec. I sauteed the spinach(frozen) in olive oil along with garlic, zucchini.  I added garlic salt, cumin, and garlic salt. I bought green enchilada sauce and drizzled a little in a pyrex baking dish. I put the monterey cheese and the veggie mix in a flour tortilla along with sauce then wrapped it and placed in dish. Put more cheese on the top and served with sour cream and avocado slices. They came out delicious! My husband loved them. Will make them again and again.

This was incredible!  Took the advise of JPeg and lightly fried the corn tortillas in oil,used Yogurt and Verde sauce as the bease,  then layered in lightly cooked tortillas in a 9" x 13" pan lmuch like a Lasagna type dish.  Added 2 shreaded chix breasts from an earlier meal into the layers.  Store bought verde sauce was delicious and added the right zing.  Thanks for making our Cinco de Mayo so special!

I was really worried how this would turn out - hardly any ingredients - but bang - what a combination!   Super easy to make, my daughter has made it for lunch 3 times in a row since we tried it for the first time for dinner.  Suggestion - layer the tortillas vs. rolling them - might be easier.

Nice place to start. I needed to beef it up more for my three boys who don't handle a meatless meal very well. I did add sauteed onion, peppers, mushrooms and fresh garlic to the mix as well as a few spices (cumin, coriander, oregano, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper). I used low carb wheat tortillas. This did need more salsa verde, at least double the amount. This turned out nicely though it wasn't very pretty. I'm kind of clumsy when it comes to enchilada making. Again, nice base recipe.

Very good. Take the corn tortillas and lightly fry in grapeseed oil for about 20 seconds. They will hold their shape when filling and wrapping, the oil is actually heart healthy, and has no taste. Added minced garlic to the salsa mix and some fresh Cilantro.

Great Recipe, I followed it exactly and They were divine! I like mine hot and spicy. One other thing, I have an electric oven and perhaps maybe it is not up to par so I cooked mine for 30 minutes at the same temp. Thank you Very very Much!

Saw the many opinions that this is too spicy.  Made the green salsa from BOYS1 on allrecipes (made it less spicey for the kids) and it was not spicy at all. Definitly cook the spinich first and squeeze dry.

I have never reviewed a recipe but I couldn't pass up the opportunity this time.  This was sooooo good.  My dad and husband are huge meat eaters and they LOVED it. I will definitely be making this again.  The only change I made was layering it to make it easier.  I will probably add mushrooms and onions to it next time but it was great with out changes too!

I have made this several times now and always add chicken. I also saute the spinach with garlic, olive oil & onion & season with salt & pepper before stuffing the enchiladas. 
I made this recipe Saturday evening, it was quick & turned out wonderful! The only thing I added was some shredded honey jalapeno rotisserie chicken I got from my local grocery store. I will say the flavor of the chicken added a wonderful touch to the dish. It tastes even better leftover - I have been eating it all week!

This was a good starter recipe, but I made a few changes because I had some different ingredients lying around.  I spread refried black beans on the inside of the tortillas before adding the other ingredients and used cheddar cheese instead and it ended up fantastic.  I will probably top with olives, tomatoes, onion and avocado next time!

I liked it fine, but the rest of the family hated it.  Also, the corn tortillas completely fell apart.  I had thought this might be a good recipe for guests, but it seems that the appeal is far from universal.

Great, great dish.  I initially made a batch jfollowing the recipe exactly.  Off the top I had problems with the corn tortialls breaking as I tried to roll them.  My husband was left to finish them and cook them but I forgot to tell him to pour the rest of the sauce over the enchiladas and sprinkle cheese.  He overcooked them. We still taste tested them and they had a great taste but we knew they were a bit spicy for our kids.

I then made another batch using flour tortillas and medium salsa instead of green salsa verde.  I also added black beans.  They turned our wonderful.  My only complaint is that the tortillas had a bit of a rubbery texture.  Maybe that's why the recipe called for corn tortillas????  I'd love to know how the rest of you were able to use the corn tortillas without them falling apart.  They didn't seem to roll for me and would just crack.

Next time I'm going to add tofu and mushrooms.  I can think of several additions to make this even more hearty.

I made this tonight and it turned out wonderfully!  Everyone was very impressed.  I changed two things about the recipe.  1.  I added pre-cooked shrimp to some of the enchiladas and 2.  I didn't really  measure the sour cream/salsa mixture.  However, it still turned out beautifully.  Not soggy or soupy at all and we didn't think it was too spicy.  I think the level of spiciness depends on which brand of green salsa you end up using.  Overall, I highly recommend this recipe.

I thought this was a good recipe for something different. I really enjoyed it but my husband thought they were too mild. We also had problems with the corn tortillas breaking when we rolled them so we popped them in the microwave for about a minute and they rolled great after that.

This was a wonderful simple dish. Definitely going into my favorite's folder. I added pieces of chicken in the enchiladas that I cooked in the pan with garlic powder, onion and herbs and some chili powder and it was yummy. However this recipe by itself is awesome!

This is a fantastic and super easy recipe with great flavor.  Surprised my family with a great tasting meatless meal.  Made the recipe exactly as noted and it was a hit.  Also seems pretty flexible so you change out a few different types of sauces.  Second time used a chipotle based salsa instead of verde and it was still great.

Delicious and SO easy to make. I would definitely make this again, even my friends loved it. The only problem was I ended up with way too much leftover spinach. Make sure to get a pretty small bunch unless you have something to do with all of the leftovers!

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I ended up layering it like a lasagna vs rolling the 12 corn tortillas since they are famously difficult to work with.  I left the spinach whole (16oz bag), used 1 c greek yogurt instead of sr cream and used Frontera Grills's tomatillo salsa which was nice and spicy.  

I'm only giving it 4 stars though because I was confused about the directions "stir together half of the sour cream and the green salsa." - but I didn't see where I was supposed to use the rest of the sour cream so I used a good 12 oz of the 16 oz of salsa with the full 8 oz of sour cream and poured the rest of the salsa (straight) on the bottom of the bottom before layering the tortillas.

I wasn't sure I would like these and I was pretty sure my husband wouldn't like them at all.  But I needed a quick dinner and my husband will eat whatever is put in front of him. We both loved them!  Not a drop left.  The only things I will do differently next time is make a little more "sauce" and put a little more cheese on the inside of the enchilada and a little less on top.  
Excellent meatless dish!

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I did add sautéed onion   into the corn tortilla rolls. I made extra salsa/sour cream mixture and poured it on top . Topped it all with shredded cheese. My family loved it! Will make again for sure!

Super easy and super great!   Made half with flour tortillas, and used 4 cheese combo.  Only problem is I'll need to make 2 pans next time

I would normally never do this, but I am going to review this recipe before I make it, just to add suggestions. I already know this is going to be amazing :) I can always come back & edit it later. I have made a recipe like this for years & we can never get enough of it. It is called Enchiladas Suizas & very similar. I would definitely suggest adding chicken to this. I would saute some chopped onions & different colored bell peppers with some garlic & cumin to mix in with the shredded chicken. I think I will use a blend of cheeses and increase the amount on top, just a personal preference as we love cheese.
I personally prefer flour tortillas. I dip the tortillas in a slightly heated green sauce before filling and rolling. It makes the corn tortillas much easier to deal with, and no matter which kind of tortillas you use, it adds flavor & not the greasiness you would get from dipping them in oil. It is messy, but well worth it. I dip mine & lay them out on wax or parchment paper to fill & then roll. You would need extra green sauce for this that is not mixed with sour cream. I'm heading to the store shortly to buy what I need for this. I can't wait for dinner tonight.

Great recipe. It has endless possibilities for anyone's taste preferences. I have been making enchiladas for years, so I added a few changes. I was taught by my Latin friend who learned it from her mom in Mexico that you are always suppose to cook the tortillas in a little bit of hot oil before filling them. The tortillas need to be soft before filling. I added shredded chicken, chopped zucchini, corn, and green chilies to my filling. I also added Mexican shredded cheese from Trader Joe's to the filling. My family really likes the cheese blend. It turned out great.

This was really great! I took others advice and liberally added cumin, garlic and onion powders, and cayenne pepper. I also added a chopped red onion and diced jalapeno as well as a bunch of chopped cilantro. I mixed everything together rather than adding it separately to the corn tortilla. I used a habenero jack cheese and mixed it with the veggies, salsa (i used a 16 oz jar), sour cream, and spices. It was super spicy and very tasty! Will make again!

I love this recipe, but I have made a few adjustments. I add red onions, green peppers, and green onions to have more tasty veggies! Also, I layer everything like a casserole, it takes more cheese and veggies, but it is soooo worth the tastiness!

Quick, easy and authentic. I used a tomatillo green salsa. This leans a little toward the tart side, but a little salt cuts this nicely. My only other thought would be to blanch or saute the spinach (go easy on the butter/oil) so you can fit more inside the tortillas.

Loved this recipe. To save time, I followed the advice of reviewers who layered the ingredients to make a casserole. I also added shredded chicken and black beans to my spinach and sour cream mixture. I cooked the shredded chicken by throwing a few boneless skinless chicken breasts in the crock pot with a little salsa and taco seasoning. It was ready to shred by the time I got home from work. We will be making this again!

A simple dish that makes a surprisingly impressive weeknight meal!  I used both monterey jack and pepperjack cheeses and baked these seam side down in the baking dish (instead of messing with toothpicks).  I did use flour tortillas per our preferences.  This was on the table in 35 minutes and only required three dishes, 2 baking pans and 1 bowl, to prepare.  It doesn't get much easier than that!

These are very yummy, but a little bit lacking. I add cumin and red pepper and extra verde salsa. I also saute onions and mushrooms and add it in with the spinach. With the extra additions, this is a five-star recipe.

Love at first bite! I love creamy spinach enchiladas, but rarely eat them due to fat/calories. I used Mission's extra thin corn tortillas (80 calories for 2!) and fat free sour cream and you would never know. Fresh corn & black beans are really good in it too. For the salsa I used Tomatillo Salsa Verde by Kimberly Binning- this salsa verde is AMAZING!!! Try it, especially for this enchilada recipe. So excited to eat the leftovers tomorrow!

This was amazing!!! I used queso fresco instead of Monterey Jack and made it the casserole way. I layered sour cream/salsa mix, cheese, tortillas, repeat. I baked it with extra green salsa on top and sprinkled on the remaining queso fresco 5 minutes before it was done. I didn't use the whole of the spinach because I was worried it would be soggy, but I wish I would have used all of it. The spinach was great. I will definitely make this again!

This is an easy, basic recipe that you can alter to your liking. My changes: added ranch style black beans and sauteed chopped purple onions to the inside of each enchilada, and about a teaspoon of cumin to the sour cream and salsa verde mixture. My grocery didn't have Monterey Jack, so I used a "Mexican Blend" of 4 cheeses. I also used flour tortillas out of personal preference. Instead of just putting salsa on top, I made more of the sour cream/salsa mixture and used that instead. Turned out really well...even my meat-and-potatoes boyfriend was raving and went back for seconds!

SUPER yum! I have a confession to make.... I didn't think these would be anything spectactular, but boy was I surprised! :) Not only were these easy to prepare (the most time-consuming part was chopping the spinach), they were OUT OF THIS WORLD DEEELICIOUS!!! My parents and enchilada-hating husband also liked these - a LOT! NOTE: Instead of using salsa verde, I purchased an 8 oz. pouch of Rick Bayless's green enchilada sauce. Another important point to mention is that I didn't find it necessary to dip my (white) corn tortillas in oil to soften. I just zapped the entire stack of them in my microwave for ~20 seconds and very gently filled each one to prevent tearing. I ended up using 1 c. of cheese INSIDE my enchiladas, the rest on top and just eyeballing the amount of salsa, sour cream and spinach in each one (NICEGIRL's directions were quite vague - I purchased a 10 oz. bag of pre-washed spinach leaves and prolly used less than half of it). Setting these babies under the broiler for a couple of minutes produced ooey-gooey yummy enchiladas! Served with Mexican rice, buttered corn, chips, guacamole and margaritas. I'm pleased to report that there were no complaints and empty plates to clean! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, NICEGIRL512. :-)

I layered it because I couldn't get the tortillas to roll.  I also added mushrooms (which I sauted in butter with the spinach.  And I used green enchilada sauce instead of salsa as well as colby jack cheese instead of monterey jack cheese.  And I added onion powder and garlic powder.  It was DELICIOUS!  My husband and brother and I all REALLY enjoyed it.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

I only had four large whole wheat flour tortillas so I decided to make a layered enchilada pie. I did use thawed frozen spinach that I squeezed and squeezed and squeezed to remove the liquid. I had half a container of riccota cheese so I decided to mix that with my green salsa inplace of the sour cream. I decided to throw in a can of cooked chicken with the spinach. I just layered instead of rolling up enchiladas. Turned out good, but needed some extra sseasoning.

Added: Mushrooms, a small onion, and a clove of garlic sauteed with the spinach.  Then a can of rinsed black beans, as well.  Used pepper jack instead of Monterey Jack, and used at least twice as much sauce as called for, with a few dashes of hot sauce until it met my heat needs.  Extra cheese on top, and voila!  I realize that wasn't the original recipe, but it was SO GOOD in the end.

I thought the spinach filling was missing something, so I added chopped leeks, chopped zucchini, and green onions.  I sauted the leeks, spinach and onions to bring out the flavours.  I used 2 jars of green salsa and took the other's advice and made this a layered casserole instead of individual enchiladas.

We thought it was terrific. One problem.  The corn tortillas broke when we tried to roll them. My granddaughter suggested that the next time  we should moisten the tortillias by wrapping them in a damp dish towel, or perhaps they were not fresh enough. Definitly it is easy, delicious and we will make them again soon.

Very easy recipe, but a little time consuming. Great results, and a meal you can make your own. Any newbies, take the advice and use EXTRA salsa. It makes a huge difference. Blend jalepenos with a little bit of salsa and throw it into the sauce mixture!! Gotta love the spice!!!

Good, I made fresh salsa verde and I added lots more spices, chopped onion, cilantro, & baby bella mushrooms. served with cuban black beans & rice to round off the meal.  On my way to being vegan, so will make this again with a cheese substitute such as a rice cheese.

Can't beat this one for taste and simplicity.   I did add minced onions, mashed up garbonzo beans and some cilantro to each enchilada.  Served with Chicken Mole.

This recipe is delicious. Placing the tortillas in the microwave with a small bowl of water and heating for 30-60 seconds allows the steam to soften the tortillas and make it easy to roll them. I do this with flour tortillas also for burritos.

Not my kind of recipe. I think it was the corn tortillas. It fell apart when serving. Maybe try it again but with flour tortillas. On the bland side, needs spices or chicken.

We love this recipe.  I do fry the tortillas in oil until bubbling (about a minute per side) before assembling to prevent them from becoming soggy.

Excellent! I used fat-free plain yogurt instead of sour cream, mixed the entire cup of yogurt with the salsa, and skipped putting it on the bottom of the dish. I grilled a chicken breast with cumin/garlic powder and then shredded that. Put yogurt/salsa mixture, spinach, chicken, and cheese in each tortilla. Delicious. My husband loves raw spinach, but doesn't always go for cooked spinach and he really enjoyed these. Will make again! Thanks :)

Yum!  This was even more delicious than I had hoped it would be.  I bought a medium salsa verde that was just right.  I used baby spinach and didn't slice it - just stacked it up.  I also used other reviewers suggestion to just layer the tortillas.  I tore them in half or in fourths to cover the baking dish, and made two layers of all ingredients.  I also used a Mexican blend of cheeses for simplicity's sake.  Fantastic recipe in every way!

I did as others suggested and made it a layered caserole plus added shredded chicken.  It was OK but needs some spice..like jalapenos or pepper jack cheese or something.

3.5 stars.  Don't get me wrong: this is an easy and delicious dish.  My problem is that the recipe is lacking in some details and I think some of the listed amounts are plain wrong.  For example, what constitutes a "bunch" of spinach leaves?  Also, I confirmed my suspicion that the entire 10 oz. pack of tortillas is way too much for a single 13x9 pan.   I had to double the amount of sauce listed.  Finally, the recipe should include a recommendation for preparing the corn tortillas.  To that end, I had great success warming the tortillas on a stainless steel pan.  For each tortilla, I sprayed oil on both sides, and then I warmed each side on the pan over medium heat for 15 seconds (30 seconds total for each tortilla).  This method accomplished two goals: 1) It made the tortillas pliable for the assembly. 2) It allowed the tortillas to firm up during baking so that the cheese and sauce wouldn't reduce them to mush.  Next time, I'm going to try this recipe with some washed, frozen spinach and red sauce.

This was very good. Having said that, I did make some modifications. I created my own spinach filling - see below:  Spinach Filling:  10 oz package frozen spinach 4 tablespoons butter 1/4 finely chopped onion 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/3 cup heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg Salt and pepper to taste To make spinach filling, cook spinach as directed on package. When the spinach is cooked, press to get all the liquid out. Melt butter in a skillet. Saute onion and garlic until soft. Add spinach and cook until all the butter is absorbed, about 4 to 5 minutes. Add heavy cream. Add nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste.   After that, I pretty much followed the recipe as written. I used tomatillo salsa which really gave it a very mild spice. The mix of salsa and sour cream was great - I had some left over and used it as a dip for chips. Also, I used homestyle (thick) corn tortillas and softened them in oil before pulling in the filling. All in all, a great recipe - will make again!

A very good, very tasty enchilada recipe.  I made a few substitutions (healthy/reduced calorie).  Used whole wheat tortillas, added fresh mushrooms, black beans, and chopped cilantro to the filling, and used fat-free sour cream.  After baking, I topped them with fresh salsa.  They came out great!

I made small changes based on what I already had around the house (red salsa and flour tortillas....which roll easily!!!) and it was a really quick and easy dinner on a busy night. I imagine it would also lend itself well to adding chicken. I had leftover black bean soup from last night so the pair was a hearty non meat meal.....and we are not even vegetarians. Between this and the hearty bean soup we were healthy and didn't even miss the meat!!

Super easy and tasty. I gave up trying to roll the tortillas after awhile and just layered them. If I made it again I would add black beans, rice, and mushrooms and eat it with a Lactaid chaser.

I made this tonight with a few variations.  I added a handful of frozen corn to each enchilada as well as some fried onions and refried beans.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 jars of Ortega Salsa Verde with one container of sour cream.  Fantastic!  Excellent vegetarian dish.  Will definitely make this again, and probably mix it up a little each time.  I also made homemade salsa to put on top and spanish rice II (from this website) on the side.  Yum! A hit with everyone!

I loved this recipe! It was soooo easy yet very tasty! Like others, I layered vs. rolled the tortillas and it was great. I used a spicy salsa verde and added some black beans. This is definitely a keeper and I will be making this often!

Absolutely delicious!   Like some other reviewers, I layered the whole thing to make it faster and I did not chop the spinach, just layered it on.  I also added some sliced green onions  and served them with black olives.    I had my doubts about this recipe, but I could not get over how something so easy could be so delicious!

My fiance and I both love these!  I add black beans and a little onion and use whole wheat wraps instead of the corn tortillas to make them healthier.  I also tried it with plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and it is still very good, you almost cant tell the difference!

Fantastic! I used only 4 tortillas to make just for me. I mixed that sour cream and Salsa verde and used it on the bottom of the pan, in the tortillas and on top. Imight add mushrooms next time, but really this is perfect. I did have to put some salsa in a frying pan and saute the tortillas in that to soften them up, but other than that, super easy and amazing taste! will definitely make again. Maybe add chicken to tempt my hubby to eat them.

These were good but I did miss some kind of meat (I'm such a carnivore). Chicken would be a great addition, if you're so compelled.  The green salsa/sour cream mix was awesome.  If you zap your corn tortillas in the microwave for about 10 secs. they roll nicely and don't tear.  I would not make these again without adding chicken but that's just me.  Recipe has wonderful flavor.

I made these layered, as others suggested, and as I usually do with enchiladas. I made some substantial changes though. I sauteed some sweet corn and oyster mushrooms in a tablespoon of oil, then added a bunch of red chard (instead of spinach) and cooked the chard through until the water cooked off. I then layered: small amount of sauce, corn tortillas, more of the sauce, the chard/corn/mushroom mixture, jack cheese, another layer of tortillas, then the rest of the cheese and sauce. I made more sauce than the recipe calls for - I had frozen tomatillos, and used those, plus 2 jalapenos, a clove of garlic, juice of one lime and about 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro in a food processor, then mixed with about 8oz of sour cream. The sauce was great! I also served with fresh pico de gallo and sour cream. Thanks for that idea.  Be careful, if you are making these for vegetarians! Make sure to buy sour cream without any gelatin. Usually organic sour cream will be safe, but check ingredients!

For something so simple, this was incredibly good!  Hardly any prep work if you buy pre-grated cheese!  I used a little more salsa than the recipe called for and a little less cheese, but still great.  Made in casserole form because corn tortillas are evil ;)  To those who said it was mushy, I use whole fresh baby spinach and really mash it down into the dish, it held up nicely.

These are made at least once a month.  So EASY and my family loves them.  A great way to get my kids to eat spinach.  The enchiladas also freeze very well. **update**Thanks to a reviewer below suggestion....I added to the sour cream mixture: onions & garlic I sauted in a little olive oil/butter.  Makes these even yummer!

I changed the recipe a slight bit.  Instead of green salsa I used a can of green chilies.   I really liked it a lot.   I thought I used enough spinach but it does really cook down.   Next time I will really pile the spinach on.   I wonder how this would work as a stack instead of rolled?

This was okay.  Didn't really care for it BUT my boyfriend loved it.  The plus side is that it's easy and fast to make.  I'll make it again for my boyfriend.

Good, quick, and easy. The first time I made this, I bought Mexican queso cheese for a special treat and I did not like it at all. It was gluey like American cheese. The second time I used Jack as called for and it was much better. Soften your tortilla in a pan with hot oil or in the microwave for a few seconds(my preference) before filling. For extra filling, I added mushrooms and onions, but wish I would have sauteed them first as they were still firm after baking.

Loved these!  Super easy, and healthy.  Unfortunately, I have to be off dairy while breastfeeding, so I plan to try these next time with tofu sour cream and soy cheese.... We'll see if they taste okay this way.

I wanted enchiladas but wanted easy and this was  it. Being in the triple digits easy is good. I used flour tortillas(small) because thats what i had and actually they were really good that way.I didn't measure so ithink i used more salsa but we like it spicy. Thanks

Very good recipe!

I used one 15 oz can of green enchilada sauce instead of the green salsa.  And, for some reason, I had to double the sour cream amount.

This was tasty but did NOT look pretty when it came out of the oven.  I had to double the sour cream and green salsa too because I didn't feel like I got enough to both fill and top the enchiladas.  I would have doubled the cheese too, but I didn't have enough on hand to do that.

These were good but a bit to spicy for me and my family.  I messed up a bit and forgot to add the extra sour cream into the tortillas so I just spread it on the top.  Also, I used 12 tortillas and 1/2 the amount of green salsa.  If I did it again I would buy a jar of mild or medium salsa vs. the can.

Quick and easy recipe!  Instead of only 7 oz of green salsa, I used a 15 oz can of green chile enchilada sauce.  I imagine it would have been too dry with less.

I added cubed cooked chicken and layered it like lasagna. While somewhat bland, the taste was good and creamy. I will make it again with hot peppers! Maybe jalapenos.

My 9 and 13 year olds loved this recipe. I added some garlic salt and cumin. I have made this with and without skim ricotta and I prefer it with some ricotta. I also decrease the green sauce unless it is very mild salsa.

used 16 oz bottle of herdaz green salsa and was too spicy (although it said mild) for the kids.  Layered in a round casserole sauce, tortillas, spinach, cheese etc.  Doug loved this

This was a family favorite. You can control the spiciness with the salsa you add. I added chicken, red peppers, and onions and substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I also took the suggestion of many and layered the ingredients like a lasagna to make things easier. Fantastic!

It's spinach-based and my five-year-old ate it--what more do I need to say?! Heated the corn tortillas in a pan for about a minute to make them pliable and it worked super. Even if they fall apart, you just end up with a casserole instead of enchiladas, which is fine!

We really enjoyed this, the only thing I did was add some leftover chicken I had on hand. DH was craving "green enchiladas" and these satisfied him. I will definitely make this again, maybe with more sauce.

Family favorite! I use Trader Joe's salsa verde (all 12 oz) and sub Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Sometimes I'll sauté some green bell peppers, onion and garlic for a little extra oomph. Pepper jack cheese also is a great option instead of the Monterey Jack. The recipe is great as is, without all the add ins, but I do think you need just a little more salsa than the 7 oz suggested.

I took the advice from another reviewer and did this casserole style. I added green peppers to get a few more veggies in per serving. The green salsa was too spicy, so I used half green and half regular.  It tasted terrific! It was a little soggy this way, but I can never get corn tortillas to fold without breaking. It was so much faster this way.

I love this recipe like everyone else except I make mine like lasagna...then you can get as creative as you like with your layers... you get just as much and as good a proportionate amount  of tortilla to filling ratio when you serve it like lasagna squares or rectangles or whatever chunk you serve.  Very easy and just as appealing.  I say forget the rolling but if I have to, I'll fry quickly/briefly in very hot oil or a hot dry comal and that heats and bonds the tortilla so it won't break up on you...the hot comal is the trick to doing soft tacos for same result...won't break when you fold it.  Deeeeelicious!!!!!

This recipe was one of those that sounded so strange I thought it was worth a try. I quickly barely wilted the spinach in some boiling water and I think that step was well worth it. For more substance I added a can of whole kernel corn drained. They were unusual but  really good. We had them with chicken breasts simmered in hot salsa. They would go well with just about any kind of meat.

Wonderful! This is very versatile. I use the basic recipe and layer everything in a pan to make a casserole. I add one can of black beans and one can of red enchilada sauce. I also use a10 oz. package of frozen spinach instead of fresh spinach.

Made this dish for over 20 friends, they all loved it! I made the "Salsa de Tomatillo" by SABRINATEE to accompany it. Absolutely fantastic, especially when paired with rice and beans.

I've made this a few times now but I add sautéed onions, hatch green chile, and bell peppers in it with a bit of fajita seasoning to give it a little kick.  It is so good!!

Made 3 small changes just for a little variation. In place of sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt . I combined all the yogurt and Salsa Verde and saved some to coat bottom and cover the top, I mixed the remaining yogurt and salsa mixture with 1 1/2 cups of shredded chicken, Monterey Jack  and the spinach .

Made this tonight and it was amazing. I changed a couple things. I used a reduced fat Mexican cheese blend instead of the jack. I also added 1lb of ground turkey seasoned with 2 tsp pepper, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1/2 tbsp cumin and 1/2 tbsp chili powder. It added a little extra spice to it, which we love. This one is definitely a keeper!!!

To make the tortillas more pliable, I wrap them in a damp paper towel first and put them in the microwave for about one minute on high.

These turned out amazing!I took others advice and sauteed onions/mushrooms. The only other change I made was combining salsa, verde enchilada sauce, and the sour cream together to get the sauce!

Easy and tasty, will make a few of changes. Will add more of the sour cream/salsa mixture and more cheese next time. Will add additional cilantro. Will try the suggestion of making it more like a casserole, layered instead of rolled.

Awesome! It tastes really good for such a simple recipe. I took the advice of some other reviewers and fried the tortillas for about 10s on each side before wrapping them, and I didn't have any issues with the tortillas falling apart while wrapping. The tortillas did get a little bit dried out during the baking, so you might want to ensure some of the sauce or cheese covers most of the top. I'm planning to try adding some other ingredients like mushroom and onion, but the simple version is a new favorite.

Too bland.  I layered the recipe like some suggested instead of rolling into enchilladas.  I added black beans to my spinach mixture, along with a little cumin and salt.  Apparently I didn't add enough salt because I found this to be very bland.  Will probably not make again as it wasn't enough of a concealment for the spinach for my kids' tastes.

I really liked this meal. I made homemade green salsa. And just a little tip, put the corn tortillas in a napkin and put it in the microwave for a bit. It helps soften the tortillas so they wont crack when you roll them and it makes it a lot more easier.

I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas; would this work with flour tortillas?

This tasted just like the spinach enchiladas I used to get at my favorite Mexican restaurant where we used to live... I'm in love!  I like to substitute plain greek yogurt for sour cream to be a bit healthier, so I did that here as well and it was excellent.  I didn't have toothpicks so I placed the tortillas seam side down and it worked fine.  I packed them into the dish though so that helped them from falling apart. My husband, who's a big meat fan, loved these as well.  I would like to try adding shrimp sometime, as I get a shrimp and spinach enchilada at another restaurant I like.  Oh, and the recipe is super easy and quick!

First time around I found them a little runny and flavorless. So second time, I used half the sour cream and added half package of room temp cream cheese, Cajun seasoning and garlic powder. Then topped cheese with jalapenos before baking. Much better. Can't wait to try it with mushrooms as suggested.

I made a few changes to the recipe I added shredded chicken, diced onions, and mushrooms.  This was perfect Great flavor.  The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because the tortillas wouldn't stay together they kept breaking. tried less ingredients in the wrap but still broke would try next with flour tortillas.  Great recipe! thanx for sharing

I used collard greens instead of spinach just because it's a lot more sturdy.  I blanched the collard greens so it is easier to wrap.  I did have to use double or even close to triple the amount of salsa verde and sour cream.  I like my food with lots of sauce.  It makes enough to feed 8 to 9 people with average. appetite.

The ingrediants does not match the steps. In step 2 it asks to mix 1/2 the sour cream. No where else in the recipe does it account for the other 1/2 cup? I mixed more salsa verde and sour cream and placed on top. It worked out okay. The family did love the flavor, but not cheesey enough. Next time I make these they will have additional cheese sprinkled on top of the enchiladas.

I only gave this four stars because I can't take the heat as much - it was wonderful though. I just added extra sour cream to cool it down for me when I plated it.

Awesome! I added black beans between the spinach and cheese and it was delicious. Also, a semi-easy tip for working with the corn tortillas...and yes, the flavor is absolutely worth it. Heat them individually on each side in a dry iron skillet until they are more pliable. My partner and I used an assembly line process where I heated the tortillas and he stuffed and rolled them. Placing them fold down eliminated the need for toothpicks. Will definitely add these to the recipe rotation.

Mmmm! When I make a sauce like this I usually add the 1c of sour cream to a 28oz. can of Las Palmas  green enchilada sauce and mix half the cheese with all the filling ingredients.  If I'm rolling the tortillas, to soften them I microwave them for about 30 sec. to cut a few calories, but the traditional way is to fry them 'till soft. If I layer them I don't need to soften them. Then I dip  the tortillas into the sauce, add the filling and roll, placing them seam side down in pan, or add another layer of dipped tortillas if layering, and cover with remaining sauce and cheese. To kick up the heat a notch I sometimes add a small can of Ortega diced green chilies or jalapenos to the filling.

Two of the biggest meat lovers I know (my boyfriend and our roommate) really liked this recipe, with a few tweaks: I doubled the salsa by using an entire jar of it, used flour tortillas, and put a lot more cheese on top. The extra cheese and salsa made it more bubbly and melty, which is how I think of enchiladas! Serve with Valentino sauce.

Wow! These Enchiladas came out very flavorful... I made them in my smoker grill, and that also added a lot of flavor... I used Shredded pepper jack cheese and a mix of shredded mexican cheeses...
I made the enchilada sauce / verde salsa at home using the tomatillo salsa verde recipe, and I probably would do the same thing again instead of getting readymade verde

and I wheat flour tortiallas instead

These rock. Super easy, fast and tasty. Of course, I doubled the sour cream because I love the sauce! Even my husband, who is a chef, loved these.

We really enjoyed these, even my husband who was skeptical at first, said that he was pleasantly surprised.  I fried my tortillas to make them easier to work with.  I had them in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes and then put them under the broiler to crisp up the cheese and give it a nice golden colour.  Will make these again for sure!

This was tasty but a little dry so I served them with extra sour cream and guacamole on the side. I made ahead and baked them the following day so next time I will prepare and bake the same day. I will also add sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic for a little more flavor. Such a great way to use up an abundance of spinach!

I actually have a question about this recipe.  I need to make a vegetarian enchilada for a group of 30 people.  Two questions:
Do you think adding chopped artichokes would be a good addition?>
If I use bagged spinach, how many bunches are in a bag?

Super delicious.  I used one 9 oz bag of fresh spinach, and probably not as much cheese as was called for, but it was great.

My daughter is a vegetarian and I am always looking for meals that the whole family can eat together. When I saw this one I thought GREAT! It was not very good when I made it - although I think I used too much of the sour cream salsa mix - in the recipe it didn't have an exact amount to put on each corn tortilla though - so that would be good if the amount could be specified. My finished product was soupy. My family didn't like it very much. My son said it seemed like a dip you could get at Chili's. I wouldn't make it again without specific quantities of the ingredients to be rolled in wach corn tortilla. My rating is a 3 based on that I think with the right amounts it could be a good dish and worth another try; and that other reviewers liked the resulting dish a lot.  Betine

Awesome recipe. I changed it a bit by sauteeing some garlic and onion in a bit of oil, then added a can of black beans, seasoned it with cumin, and then added frozen spinach.  I used 2 packages of spinach because my family loves it.  I layered it like a casserole.  Delish!

These were delicious! I covered the enchiladas with a small can of green enchilada sauce and they turned out perfect. I took the recommendation to mircowave the corn tortillas with a small glass of water, and that defintiely helped to soften them up. Definitely a repeat.

Great and easy!  I made this as a casserole instead of rolling each enchilada individually.  I doubled the sauce recipe, and added a small can of green chilies to make it spicier.  My husband doesn't think it's a meal unless there is meat, so I also added chicken.  Will make again!  UPDATED:  The leftovers didn't taste nearly as good as it was straight out of the oven.  I wouldn't make a lot of leftovers.

I modified this recipe because I did not have enough sour cream. I only had a half a cup.  I used the sour cream for the bottom of the dish like the recipe suggested but then drained, rinsed and pureed a 15 ounce can of white beans.  I used this to spread on the tortillas shell.  It turned out pretty good.

Hearing that some other reviewers considered the recipe bland, I did doctor it a bit, so can't give it 5 stars as-is.  I sauteed some onion and poblano pepper in olive oil and wilted the spinach slightly in the pan with salt & pepper.  Then I wrapped it up with cheese & a spoonful of the sauce in warm flour tortillas.  (No cracking worries with the flour ones!)  I did also double the sauce as some suggested.  My fiance and I both loved these!

Yum - two of my favorites, Mexican(ish) food and spinach. I used half a bag of spinach and added pinto beans. I stacked it as a casserole and it seriously took 15 minutes prep time as stated! That never happens! I will definitely add this to my rotation.

I made this but modified it a bit:  chopped and sauteed spinach with olive oil and garlic (1 tsp, add about 1/4 tsp of each chili pepper and cumin, added cilantro (4 cubes of Trades Joes frozen cubes) while sauteing.   I also made one with spinach only and one casserole adding about 4 chicken breast that I boiled (with salted water) and shredded.  Cooked in a 9x13 casserole pan. Both were delicious! I took to a pot luck luncheon and they were gobbled up.

I make this like a lasagna, spreading a little sauce on the bottom of the pan and then layering the tortillas and other ingredients a few times.  I use 12 tortillas total.  I also add a can of pinto beans.  YUM.

There was not much to this... it was a pretty fattenin, yet not filling, meal.  The corn tortillas did not roll for me, but broke apart, there was way too much cheese and sour cream, and not enough consistancy.

After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to make it in layers rather than individual enchiladas and added extra salsa.  I was glad I did both.  The tortillas absorbed the flavours and juices so it tasted like a vegetarian lasagna.  It's a straight-forward, tasty recipe, but I probably wouldn't make it again without doing more substitutions (yogurt instead of sour cream, light cheese) and some other vegetables.  Too much guilt...

A very simple and very tasty recipe! The only thing I changed was I microwaved the corn tortillas for 30 seconds before I filled them. I did this to keep them from cracking. But otherwise this recipe was delicious and my whole family loved it, even my little bro who usually hates spinach.

I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I added an onion and a can of pinto/black beans. I sauted the onion AND spinach in cumin, chili pepper, garlic powder. I layered the fillings in a medium/Large casserole dish and baked COVERED at 350 for 30 min. Great vegitarian option. Thanks!

I used the exact ingredients but assembled as a layered casserole - tortilla, sour cream/salsa mix, spinach, cheese; repeat.  Two of us loved it as is but two would have liked it better with some chicken added.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a great basic recipe for spinach enchiladas. I did make a few changes to fit my taste. I used flour tortilla shells because they fold better, heat them up for 20 sec before filling. I cooked the spinach for a minute and a half and squeezed the water out so that they wouldn't make the enchiladas to runny. I sauted a tablespoon of minced garlic in butter, then added 3/4 cup of onion and fresh mushrooms to the butter and continued cooking until the mushrooms were cooked. I boiled and shredded three chicken breasts. I sprayed the breast with butter, sprinkled salt, pepper, and crushed red peppers to taste. I doubled the sour cream mixture. Added a handful of black beans to the enchiladas as well. Rolled all ingredients up in tortilla shells and cooked as directed. Excellent turnout! My husband said that this was one of his favorite recipes and raved about it for days!

Nice start and idea for a quick meal! I changed the following: used yogurt not sour cream, 5 whole wheat tortillas not corn, doubled the spinach and nuked it for 1 minute then squeezed out all the water before putting it in the dish, and added more cheese. I added the following: browned a medium finely diced onion in olive oil with 4 cloves of minced garlic then added a chicken breast diced seasoned with salt and pepper to the pan to saute. Then I put all of the ingredients into a round casserole dish and layered it like lasagna (as others recommended). My 3 kids (3 and under) loved it as well as my husband and I. It's pretty healthy when you think about it so I am pleased to add this to my list of quick meals. Thanks so much for a great idea for a quick and easy meal!!!

Tip: spray corn tortillas on both sides with cooking spray, then heat in the oven at 300 for 4 minutes each side.  This somewhat helps the tortillas from falling apart.

Excellent recipe!  Just added sauteed mushrooms.  I didn't have a problem with the enchiladas unrolling.  Like another reviewer suggested, just nuke the tortillas a few seconds before hand to make them more flexible, and put the seam on the bottom.  Used flour tortillas and yogurt to cut calories, and they turned out great!

I made this ahead of time - and doubled the sauce.  I think letting it sit in the sauce for 2 hours before cooking was a bad idea, my tortillas were mush when it was cooked.  I added ground turkey to the filling.  I think further filings would be good as well (mushrooms, onions).  I will probably make this again with no wait before cooking and trying different fillers.

I was very surprised by how good this was! It was a huge hit! I've made spinach enchiladas before from more involved and complicated recipes, but this one is our favorite. I've made this twice, once with leftover chicken and once without. We really liked it with the chicken.

Easy, tasty and quick to make. Will definitely make again. The key is fresh tortillas (so they don't fall apart due to dryness) and good salsa verde. Mine was considered "mild" but had jalapenos in it so there was a nice kick to it.

This is my go to recipe for dinner parties. I've made this with both corn and flour tortillas.  Flour tortillas are much easier to work with and still taste great.  I've found that homemade corn tortillas are the easiest to work with.   The last time I made this I had to substitute mozzarella for the Monterrey jack, it's not often available where I live, and it still came out wonderfully.  Whenever we are invited to a pot luck, everyone asks me to bring these.  Fabulous!

Delicious! My 10 y/o loves the spinach enchiladas at a local Mexican restaurant and asked for these as his birthday dinner. I made very few changes. We doubled the salsa/sour cream, used floured tortillas, and added some ground cumin to the salsa/sour cream mix. We paired it with the Spanish Rice II recipe from this site and the entire meal was just wonderful. He's already asked for it again! Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was a great beginners recipe for enchiladas - it was simple and tasted decently.  However, these don't have the robust flavor of Tex-Mex.  I even used jalepenos in my enchiladas along with the spinach, and it wasn't up to par.  Definitely cut back on the amount of sour cream and a bit on the cheese, and increase the verde sauce. The tortillas fell apart very easily, but they tasted good out of the oven.  These would probably be better with a sauteed chicken inside to enhance the flavor.

We loved these! I tried them out on some guests and they too were very impressed. Not to mention, I took them to work the next day and everyone was so impressed simply with the smell and I ended up emailing the recipe to the entire staff of the elementary school. Definitely a winner!

These were pretty good.  I made a couple changes - whole wheat tortillas instead of corn, green enchilada sauce instead of salsa and I added mushrooms and onions.  Next time I will try it with the green salsa to make a thicker sauce and maybe add some chicken or maybe even articokes!  Also if you use canned mushrooms make sure to squeeze as much of the water out of them and if you put enough of the sauce on the bottom and sides of the pan they should not stick that much.

Very good, although corn tortillas tore even when heated thoroughly first.  Try flour tortillas next time.

This was surprisingly good. I really enjoyed it. I added 1/2 cup more sour cream, green salsa mixture and put about 1/4 cup green salsa on the top with green onions. I only added the extra because I had to use two pans and it looked like they were going to be a little dry. I had spinach left over so next time I will be sure to add more spinach. I did slightly fry the corn tortillas so they wouldn’t break. I think some garlic, onion chicken would work well with recipe if your a meatatarian. Thanks for the recipe. Glad I tried it!

Update: Made this with chicken and white tortillas. Yum!

A nice and easy version of enchiladas. I did fry the tortillas before rolling them with the spinach, cheese and sour cream mixture. A big hit, even with my 4  year old and 19 month old sons!

Loved it! I took a picture of mine when I noticed there wasn't one. The one review saying she joined allrecipes just to review the recipe really inspired me to make this. Mine didn't come out mushy, they were delicious and just right! One difference...I used a 4 cheese Mexican pre-shredded bag of cheese instead of Mont. Jack.  Excellent and healthy! :) Also another change...used Flour Tortillas.

We made this with flour tortillas, 2% cheese, and fat free sour cream. It had great flavor, but not enough spinach, an easy fix.

This recipe is fantastic.  I give it 5 stars because it is very easy to make and so good to eat.  I added about two cups of shredded roasted chicken breast and I used about a whole jar of green salsa (about 12 ounces).  Love it, thanks for the great recipe! :)

Great recipe. I used a very spicy green salsa, which was very good in the enchiladas. Will make again.

Wow is all I can say! These enchiladas were super easy and GREAT!!  They were probably one of the best things I've ever made and everyone loved them.  The only thing is that I used MORE sour cream and green enchilada sauce mixture than it called for.  I also did not need to use toothpics to hold them together - just place them seam side down in the pan.  Anyway, GREAT GREAT enchiladas!

This was so good! I also used the green salsa from Trader Joes, it's mild. My 3 & 6 yr olds loved it. it was pretty easy and is great if you want leftovers. I did warm the torillas to fold them too. Will use this in our weekly menu. Thanks.

This was really good and really easy.  I love that there's so few ingredients.  Like some other reviewers, I used more green salsa than the recipe called for (most of a 16 oz. jar).  I also used regular sour cream instead of light.  I will definitely make this again.

I agree with girlwtude. This was way to spicy for my family. I would also try it with regular mild salsa and not use the green salsa.

Very tasty for a meatless dish!  Although, I'm tempted to shred some rotisserie chicken next time and add it to the mixture.  Spicy, for sure (kid's wouldn't eat it), but so easy and delicious...will make it again!

I love these and everyone at my party ate them up.  I used Trader Joes jarred Salsa Verde because that is my favorite salsa.  It was so good and so easy to make.
