We followed the recipe exactly and these were incredible!  We served them with grilled mushrooms on top and will definitely make them again.

My only change was ground lean turkey because I am not a big fan of beef.  The burgers were amazing!!!!  We cut the recipe in half and only made 6 instead of 12, next time I will add a little more blue cheese.  My husband wanted to be the first to submit a photo, but that was too much pressure =)

Made these over the holiday weekend for throwing on the grill.  Although the sundried tomatoes were a little dominant, the flavors blended well and made for delicious, moist burgers.  Quote of the night:  'Red Robin would pay handsomely to have a burger this good on their menu.'

These are really good.... Be sure to dice the sundried tomatoes very small.  When you get a big bite of the tomato, it can be overwhelming.

Great! I added more cheese and soaked the dried tomatoes in hot water then squeezed dry and chopped. I used extra lean ground beef and they grilled up really nice with no flare ups.

This burger is very peppery...great flavor there.  We cut the sun dried tomatoes into 1/4 inch pieces.  This seemed too big, as they were a bit overwhelming.  Perhaps adding fewer tomatoes would do the trick.

Based on the other reviews, I increased the sundried tomatoes and added more hot sauce (we like the spicy). They turned out great. Very juicy and flavorful.

Delicious! The sun-dried tomatoes added great flavor.  I only made 1 pound and reduced everything by 2/3.  The meat is really, really wet.  Didn't have 2 hours to wait, so I threw it in the freezer for 20 minutes and then put it in the refrigerator for another 20 minutes.  Added season salt and some additional hot pepper sauce too.

I cut the blue cheese and other seasonings way down on this one for the bf--did 6 burgers but 1/4 the amount of seasonings.  He's not a big fan of blue cheese at all but said he was able to taste it a bit and he liked the burgers.  I couldn't taste the blue cheese, but he was happy and he ate 2.  Thanks for sharing.

These burgers were inhaled by my family.  The flavor was AWESOME.  So much the men-folk each ate two.  

I added the bread crumbs and an egg based on the other reviews, but I also added crumbled BACON in the meat mix.  The egg and bread crumbs didn't help the patties stay firm on the grill.  It could have been the ratio, or the bacon.  Next time I will try it with just the bacon and leave out the egg.  I put the (bagged - moist) sundried tomatoes in the food processor and crumbled the cheese very small.  Didn't have any problems with leakage like the others mentioned.

Everything is better with bacon!

This is the best burger I've ever had!  I used turkey burger (lower fat) and omitted the hot sauce (personal preference), and they were awesome!  I've also used Feta as opposed to Blue Cheese and it's just as good.

Love these burgers!  So tasty.  Some changes I made: used half ground pork, half ground beef.  Used an egg and bread crumbs.  For Blue cheese, I used blue goat cheese.

These really stood out when last we grilled burgers!  I increased the hot sauce to 1 tsp. and served extra in a dish.  I always use Louisiana hot sauce, it's not all about the heat - more flavor, I think.  I also used two jumbo eggs in the meat mixture to help bind it.  On the side I had sliced bleu cheese for the real fans.  All the burgers disappeared in nothing flat!  I'm pretty sure my brother had "double, double" burgers ... as in plural.  Thanks to KitchenKing for the super variation on the all American burger!

Huge hit at the BBQ! Several friends said "This is the best burger I've ever had".  I did it a little different though, I stuffed the blue cheese in between two thin patties and pinched the edges together.  I also cut back a little on the sun-dried tomatoes and added 2 eggs to the meat mixture to keep everything together.  Great recipe, thanks to whoever came up with it.  Like any of these though, recommend making it your own.  Will definitely make them again, probably at gun point ;)

I used the recipe on three different occasions, and each time it was a hit!  I strayed away from the actual recipe a bit by adding fresh green chile to the mix, this added an extra flavor that is fantastic.  Great recipe and easy to make!

These are outstandingly delicious - moist and flavourful! Never again will I crave restaurant burgers while I have a recipe like this one! Oh, and be sure to put the dried tomatoes into boiling water for 2 minutes first and blot with paper towels! This really makes a difference in the final outcome and you won't get the overwhelming dried tomato taste. I just made these a few days ago and I'm wanting more! Thanks for this recipe!

If I could give these 10 stars I would.  I made the recipe exactly as is, and I would make them again and again with no changes.  These burgers were AMAZING!!  We only added a little ketchup and mayo to the bun.  Needs nothing more!

Fantastic! I reduced ham. meat to 1 LB, reduced sun dried tomatoes to 1/4 cup, used .3 LB of crumbled blue cheese, and less than 1/4 cup chives. After mixing ingredients, we let it sit in fridge for about 4 hrs. It was wonderful....

Since we don't typically eat beef in our household, I used ground turkey instead and they were delicious.  I couldn't tell you how they do taste with beef, but I can say yum for turkey.  Looking forward to leftovers tonight.

These are delicious made exactly as the recipe says. The one thing I noted was the tendency to fall apart. Perhaps a little flour, an egg?

followed the recipe and the burgers fell apart and were very hard to eat. More sun-dried tomatoes than I like. Overall I'm sure there are better recipes out there.

We loved these burgers!  The combination of flavors was incredible!  I soaked the sun-dried tomatoes in hot water for about five minutes to plump them up, and then dried them.  I used about  triple the amount called for of feta in place of the blue cheese, and a tablespoon of dried chive in place of fresh.  I ate mine with slices of tomato, lettuce and a smidge of Miracle Whip and mustard.  I will make these again and again!

These were very good burgers!  I did scale the recipe back, using only 1 pound of ground turkey and swapped out the blue cheese for feta (hubbie doesn't like blue cheese)!  I did soak my sun dried tomatoes for a bit first before chopping them up - very yummy :)

As for flavor, these burgers are five stars.  Excellent.  If they would only hold together a little better.  I lost one of them through the grill grate because it disintegrated.  Wonderful flavor but might add just a bit of a binder next time.  They went perfectly with the Naan I made earlier.

AMAZING!!! 
I cut this recipe down by 1/3.  Followed it exactly, except for adding a little extra blue cheese as suggested by others.  It would have been just fine with the amount indicated by the recipe.  No additional toppings needed whatsoever.  SO juicy!  PERFECT!!!!

My sister, daughter and I LOVED these burgers!  I went with 90% lean, which turned out a fairly dry burger, so next time I will go with 85% to see if I can change the consistency a bit.  We will definitely make these again!

This was just barely OK the first night. Very ordinary. Most of the flavor was from the blue cheese. The leftover burgers were better, but still not something I think I would make again. There are better burger recipes out there.

I just broke my Lenten Meat fast with this dish.  I can't tell you how worth it it was.  I wouldn't change a thing but I think I used about twice the amount of bleu cheese called for.  Awesomely delectable

Awesome burger!  Add or diminish the sun-dried tomatoes based on your tastes.  This burger is bold enough to stand up to a Pinot Noir if you so choose. I mix ground chuck and ground sirloin (50/50) to achieve the perfect amount of taste and sizzle when grilling this or any burger.

Just okay. Tasted alright, didn't really like the chunky texture, or cleaning up sticky bits of sundried tomatoes on the grill.

The steak sauce was overwhelming and the blue cheese crumbles melted out, leaving little blue cheese taste. The cheese problem might be corrected by a fry pan, but I think I'd have to skip the steak sauce.

First burger to be fired on the grill this year did not disappoint.  Had no chives so I diced up some green onions.  Doubled the hot sauce and the steak sauce (bourbon steak sauce).  Very good, will make again!!!

I made these last weekend, and my husband put them on the grill.  They were delicious.  Flavor combination is wonderful.  The sun-dried tomatoes were a nice addition.  I used the kind packed in oil and herbs, but drained and squeezed out some of the remaining oil with paper towels.  Also, I was in a hurry, so I popped them in the freezer for 30 minutes instead of refrigerating for 2 hours.  Even my finicky teenaged daughter loved these.  We will definitely make again.

However, I made some modifications.  Instead of onion, I used scallions, I put it on focaccia bread with a sun dried tomato spread on the focaccia, rather than incorporate the sun dried tomatoes in the mix.  I made this for a large party for a Memorial Day B-BQ.  It is now demanded for all family B-BQ's

These were really good! I did change it up a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients and I was trying to make it healthy. Used lean ground chicken and added one egg white, fresh bread crumbs and skipped the Worcestershire sauce since I was out. Loved them!

Awesome burgers. Some mentioned the sun-dried tomatoes were too strong so I cut them very fine and had no problem. Used a little more blue cheese than called for, but that's for personal taste. These burgers don't need anything with them, served with some baked sweet potato fries, a real hit!

I made this on the grill twice, once with beef and once with venison, and they tasted great.  The burgers stayed together fine and that is not aways easy with venison.

Made these for a neighborhood cookout and they were absolutely phenomenal!  I diced the tomatoes pretty small per other suggestions and the flavors all worked perfect together.  Even my son who is a plain cheeseburger kind of guy loved it.  Will be making these a lot this summer.

I did halve the recipe as there are only the two of us, out they turned out delicious. I only put one less star as sadly I don't have a grill and had to pan-fry them resulting in them being a bit burnt. 
Definitely something I'll try again though.

Not bad at all! I just eyeballed the spices/condiments as I only used 2 lbs of beef. I like the subtle tastes of the sun dried tomatoes and blue cheese and how flavorful it makes the burger. Something different from a regular burger but yummy!

This is great!  Thanks so much for posting.
For those who rate the recipe less because they changed it:  If you don't make a recipe as it is stated, then don't bother to review, unless you repost it as your own "changed" recipe.
