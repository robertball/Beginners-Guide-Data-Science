I absolutely loved this!! I would definitely recommend this as a holiday or special dinner since it's so impression looking. I was a bit nervous because I used a 6# chicken instead of the 3# but I doubled the pastry recipe and cooked for 2 hours and it turned out great!!

I loved how this looked and tasted.  I am not great at making pie dough but used Chef John's Buttercrust Pastry Dough found on allrecipes site.  It came out perfectly.  I could not find a 3.5 lb chicken and could only get a 5 lb chicken which I cooked for 90 minutes.  Note it needs to sit for 30 minutes minimum out of the oven.

This was phenomenal. And not as hard as it looks. My very well-stocked grocery store only had puff pastry so I used that. I also had to use a much larger chicken, over 5 pounds. I just added about 20 minutes to cook time. The rectangular pastry dough was actually easier  to work with than the round pie dough in the video.  I placed the chicken on it diagonally and  didn't need to do any cutting and pasting, just a little stretching. (To prevent tearing  the dough, I cut both wings completely off and stuffed them  in with vegetables.) And I  just used a dry white wine for sauce and did not worry with the sel fleur where it was called for.  I tested it with a meat thermometer to ensure it was done.  Pressed Rosemary sprigs into the dough as well. Sorry for all the changes Chef John! But your  recipes are always wonderful. Thank You!

This is DELICIOUS! The chicken is tender and juicy and the skin under the dough is sticky not slimy. The breading is moist and flaky and sweet, just crunchy enough outside and perfectly soft inside. The gravy is soooo good, we are going to try dipping bread in it also. I will DEFINITELY make this again. also, I used a 5.5 pound chicken and just used 1.5 of the recipe and cook times, turned out perfectly!!
