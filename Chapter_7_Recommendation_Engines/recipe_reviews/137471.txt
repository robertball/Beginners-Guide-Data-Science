it is much easier to cut the pita bread before baking it, you get nice square litle chips!

Delicious! I had many rave reviews from my dinner guests. I used zatar, which has sumac in it, instead of the straight sumac. Will definitely make again!

This was great, thanks! Just like how my family makes it, I like the addition of olives, I normally dont use it.

have never made my own fattoush and this was good but I think there must be a misprint.  1 TBSP of salt?  seems like an awful lot. after 1 tsp, it was plenty.  Used red onions for color. didn't have fresh mint but tons of dried so added two tbsp. to the dressing. Made an emulsion in the food processor with the mint, sumac, salt, oil and lemon juice. I like a burst of lemon flavor (as opposed to just acerbic) so did grate some fresh rind of the lemon too.  a sprinkle of EVOO on the pita before popping into the oven.  thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe, great dressing.  When you think of all the junk that they add to salad dressings (preservatives, sugar, etc...) you'll only want to use this recipe!

Good! I left out the radishes and olives due to personal preference. I added a minced jalapeno and parsley, then combined everything except the lettuce until I was ready to eat so that it would not get soggy.  Thanks!

This recipe is very good and authentic. Perfectly balanced (although I didn't use all of the diced veggies: only the tomatoes, cucumber, and green onion). Instead of toasting my own pita bread I bought quality pita chips, spread them on a baking sheet, sprayed some cooking oil on them and broiled them in the oven for a few minutes (just until they browned a little). It gave them the crispy and somewhat fried taste/texture I'm used to with fatoosh. Thanks!

I make this often, we eat salad every day in my house so it's important to have a variety of recipes to keep up the trend. I add a little bit of fresh chopped parsley, roasted red pepper instead of fresh bell pepper and a bit of feta cheese. Yummy!

This was GREAT and a big hit with my lunch buddies!  One of my friends asked for the recipe.  I couldn't find sumac but I did find a nice Mediterranean spice blend that worked nicely.  This is a fresh, yummy light dressing that's perfect for summer eating!
