I made these exactly as per the recipe.  They are a thick and chewy cookie.  The dough was chock full of goodies and was hard to get mixed together but the end result was delicious!  I used my usual cookie scoop, rolled the scoops into balls and flattened slightly.  The cookies really didn't flatten much more in the oven.  I ended up with more than 3 dozen cookies.  All in all, this is a great recipe and needs no changes.  Thanks!

Delicious! I used coconut oil instead of butter, and macademia nuts instead of pecans. I then needed to adjust the baking time to 15 minutes, definitely worth it. My new favorite cookie!

This cookie is stuffed with goodies.  How can you go wrong?  They were very chewy so I increased the baking time because we prefer our cookies to have a little crunch, and it worked out fine.  Overall, a very nice cookie.

I am a huge coconut fan so when I saw these I had to make them! I wish I would have only used 1/2 a tsp of coconut extract, a fully one give them a little too much of a fake flavor for me. I added unsweetened coconut flakes and PB chips as well as white chocolate and semi sweet with walnuts. I also did 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 baking powder and they came out perfect and so good! thanks for sharing!

Very nice cookies, I made using all butter, doubled the vanilla instead of coconut flavoring (still used the shredded coconut), white chocolate chips only and a bit more pecans. They're going quickly, I'll likely make more! Thanks:)

We made these without the chocolate chips. I also toasted the coconut before hand.  Then added it to the mixture.  Love the favour and texture. No other changes. Baked for 11 minutes.  Came out perfect.

Best cookies ever!!! and I have tried many many recipes from AR in the past (which are really good)but this one beats them all in my humble opinion, the things is this recipe has less sugar than most recipes and for me that's a plus also they don't spread as others do, I like thick cookies... and it's versatile as well, I swapped half  organic ww pastry flour, organic coconut and all butter, and they still came out amazing! Thanks for sharing!

I did nearly exact but I didn't have crisco so I used all butter. I also had planned for white chocolate. They needed 15 min bake time with my air bake cookie sheet. Turned out delicious!

Absolutely divine. I have been baking chocolate chip cookies since I was 12 years old. Now I wonder why I never put coconut and pecans into the cookies!  I didn't have coconut extract so I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup organic coconut oil.  I also didn't have white chocolate chips so I used 1 and 1/2 cups semi-sweet chips.  I imagine the cookies are quite tasty if one follows the directions, but even with my modifications they were divine.

Super delicious! I used only chocolate chips, butter and vanilla extract. They are disappearing quickly! So good.

I’ve made these cookies several times and each time I marvel how delicious they are. I’ve use different variations of the recipe. I’ve used all butter and I’ve also used butter flavored shortening and butter combo. I really don’t think that it makes a difference either way what you do. If you had the cookies side-by-side You might be able to taste a slight difference with the different variations of shortening and butter. I’ve also left out the coconut extract and used a vanilla. Doesn’t matter what you do you can’t ruin these cookies and you will be so glad you made them!

This is just ok. Followed recipe, but it needs something.
