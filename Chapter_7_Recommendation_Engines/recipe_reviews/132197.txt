This recipe was great, but I adapted it a bit...I used one big pork tenderloin and had the butcher cut a slit through the center, and I just stuffed it--none of this pounding and rolling business!

I also browned the outside of the tenderloin and put it in my roaster oven for a few hours--worked beautifully!

Next time, more bleu cheese in the meat and less mustard in the sauce.  Otherwise, everything was great!

I tried this recipe twice. First time exactly. The pan burned crusty bits in oven and sauce tasted burned. Second time I browned pork in pan, finished 20 mins on grill over indirect heat. (could put on broiler pan in oven) Made sauce in pan. Great!  Also, I reduced black olive tapenade to 1/3 cup & increased blue cheese to 1/2 cup the 2nd time. More balanced flavor. (That was for one tenderloin.) Also, be careful not to get too much of the oil the tapenade is in when filling. Over all a very good & easy recipe.

Outstanding. Relatively easy and bursting with the flavors of olive (I used Kalamata) and Bleu Cheese.  I love this recipe.  Chose to serve with traditional artichoke.

Very nice and clean flavors, like something you'd get in a bistro in France. I served this with wilted arugula.

WOW this was amazing ... especially the sauce!  For the filling, I used blue cheese crumbles along with a tapenade which I made with some slightly spicy mixed olives.  As a side, I served orecchietti pasta ("little ears") which served as a vessel for all the sauce.  Definitely a keeper and already on the menu for our annual New Year's Eve dinner with friends.

This was such an easy recipe.  I used my Pampered Chef Covered Baker for this - perfect!  I didn't have Olive tapenade so I took a jar of sliced olives, a clove of garlic, a T of olive oil & some greek seasoning and put it in the magic bullet.  I spread that on the flattened tenderloin then added the crumbled blue cheese and cooked it for an hour on 350.  This was a small roast for just 2 people - it was amazing!

Loved the Pork with olive & blue cheese stuffing mixture, but didn't care for the sauce - too sweet. I substiuted a creamed leek sauce with remaining leeks that I sauted in a rue with light cream, salt & pepper and felt this complimented the flavours better.

Very good - and great directions! The sauce was a little on the sweet side for me - I would probably cut the honey in half if I made it again. I used Deb's Tapenade from this site. Yum. Thanks!

This is a great recipe! It's easy to make and simply delicious (seriously, we licked our plates clean...). I made the recipe as is (only added some minced black olives because I didn't have enough tapenade) and served it with Sp√§tzle and a salad on the side, it was really outstanding. My husband - who isn't a great fan of blue cheese - loved it too, but suggested next time we should try it with a good feta cheese and I think that would be great as well. Thank you very much for this fantastic recipe, Ryan!

Made this for the wife.  Big success.  Read the reviews and reduced the mustard in sauce to 3 tb and used the required honey.  Didn't have lemon juice so used lime.  Doubled blue cheese and made my own tapanade with klamada  olives, two cloves garlic, olive oil and capers.  Served with sauted broccoli/carrots and a chardonay. Will make again!

This was positively fantastic!  Worth the effort for sure.  I used a kalamata olive tapenade which was wonderful.

I made it without olive tapenade (just blue cheese with thyme) and it was very good. Next time I will definitely use tapenade. The sause was so good, but I used just 1 tbs honey. The sauce goes great with salmon too. Overall, this is a restaurant quality dish.

My husband really raved about this. I used a green olive tapenade. next time I will use more blue cheese and slightly less tapenade. The sauce was perfect, not too sweet at all. I will definitely make this again.

This is an incredible recipe.  Very flavorful and fairly simple to make.  Crescent rolls and corn on the cob made this a great meal.  I will be making this on a regular basis!

Fab! Of course I can't say anything less since olives and blue cheese are my favorites!  Next time I'll modify the sauce to save on fat... maybe a honey walnut glaze? Yum!

We might be the lone dissenter here, but we just thought this was ok.  No one liked the sauce very much.  I think it might have been the dijon mustard in the sauce that we didn't care for.  Thanks for sharing

I thought this was very flavorful, and the pork turned out so moist. My hubby thought it was a little too rich for him, so I might use goat cheese instead of blue next time to tone it down so I can make it more often. Yummy!

Update: Made it with goat cheese instead of blue and I have to say that not only did hubby like it, but I liked it even better to!!!

This was an extremely tasty way to serve pork tenderloin! I made this for a small dinner group of 6 and it was a hit! I will say that the next time I make this i will execute steps 1-3 and put it in the fridge until about 30 minutes before I am ready to finish it up and serve. I would not change a thing! Definite keeper! Thank you!!!

Heaven! I thought the mixture of flavors would be too potent, but it made the pork sing. I used onions instead of shallots, but followed exact for all other items. Will keep this on the "special night" recipe list! Served with smashed potato and covered the starch in the wonderful pork sauce. Great recipe!

Amazing!  My first attempt at this recipe and it turned out amazing.  I followed the suggestion to cut the honey in half and the sauce was perfect.  I also used goat cheese instead of blue cheese simply because that's what I had and it worked out perfectly.  I served it with asparagus spears and quinoa.  Everyone loved it.

If you're not a blue cheese fan, try this recipe with feta or domestic goat cheese in place of the blue cheese.  YUM!

Couldn't find olive tapenade in my town, so had to suffice with an olive pesto, but still received many compliments.

i can attest that the smell was wonderful, but being a pescatarian and allergic to wine, i didn't try it myself, just cooked it for a dinner party.

It's a keeper for sure!  Whole family loved this one, even my teen who professes to hate blue cheese.  Sauce was tangy, buttery with a little sweet edge.  I could drink that stuff.  I didn't have shallots, so I minced an onion.  Also used dried parsley instead of fresh (cause, that's what I had).  One note when rolling it; roll it starting from the narrow edge instead of the long edge so that you get a really nice spiral.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

My husband and I made this for dinner last night.  It was unseasonably hot here so we seared it outside on a gas burner and then roasted it in the barbecue pre-heated to 400. We went back to the gas burner to make the heavenly sauce.  We made the recipe exactly as written expect for the sauce.  Being red wine drinkers, we never have white wine on hand so we subbed in the red wine.  It was fantastic.  We will definitely make this again and again and are happy to know that we can easily make this while on our road travels too!  Thank you.

Made this last night for my family...they loved it (even my 8 & 10 yr olds)!  I took the advice of other reviewers: added more blue cheese & cut the honey in half; might just use 1 tsp next time as I don't care for overly sweet sauces.  My husband raved about it and asked me to make it regularly.  Pounding the tenderloin is a little labor intensive, but worth it.  I didn't have fresh thyme, so used about half the amount of dry & it was fine.  Completely forgot to add the butter?!  Wasn't intending on adding the full amount anyways...the sauce was still great/didn't miss it at all!!!  Delicious dinner, thanks Ryan!

I have never written a review before but this recipe was so amazing I had to sign up and tell everyone about it.  My hubby hates pork and when he had this he said "this is so good I want you to make it again."  I followed the recipe exactly and honestly it needs no changes.  Enjoy this.  You will make it again.

So easy. Made my own Tapenade. Excellent
dish - will make again. The sauce had a German flair to it. Next time I will make extra and before adding butter will save some to serve over Red cabbage. It was yummy.

A bit too bland for my taste but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. Very nice diversion from the usual.

Wow!  This was a big hit with my husband and daughter.  The only change I made was to use minced red onion because I didn't have any shallots, and I had to add about 5 more minutes to the cooking time of the pork in the oven.  Served this with saffron rice and grilled veggies.  It's a little bit of work to prepare, but so, so good and worth it!
