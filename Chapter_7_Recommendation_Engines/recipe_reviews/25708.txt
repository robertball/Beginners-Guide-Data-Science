I submitted this recipe several years ago, but I still make this all the time.  I no longer use so much butter, I half it, and I use half and half instead of heavy cream.  This is also great as a clam chowder, with a can of drained baby clams added to it.  Still great the  next day, great blended, and goes perfect with a good sourdough bread.  Quick and easy, still perfect for my house!

Fantastic recipe. I made the following changes: Used 5 cups of skin-on Red Potatoes, added 3 cloves of mashed garlic to the leeks, about 2 tsp of Cayenne and 1 tsp of onion powder. Also I substituted half and half for the heavy cream. After simmering, I used a hand blender to smooth it out. Very warm, flavorful and satisfying. Next time I'll reduce the butter to 3/4 cup and not salt the soup until the end. Between the butter and broth, it's plenty salty already.

This recipe was very helpful. I had to make some adjustments to the recipe as we are vegetarians, so veg stock instead of chicken and lots more leek and added garlic – just play around with it! For a healthier option, use pam to brown the leeks & garlic, and sub cream with fresh milk. Add herbs and spices you love to make it your dish, it’s super tasty!

This came out great.  I only used a half stick of butter and I substituted the heavy cream with evaporated skim milk and you would never know the difference.  I also used an immersion blender to puree everything  after the potatoes were soft because I prefer a creamy potato soup instead of a chunky one (Although I did separate out some of the leeks first to leave them whole). I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very delicious and simple. I used white pepper and substituted fat-free half and half for 1/2 of the heavy cream. I also pureed the soup after it cooled a little. I garnished it with gruyere cheese and Italian parsley. Update: I made again and decreased butter to 1/2 cup and used fat-free half&half. Also, garnished with crumbled bacon along with the gruyere cheese and parsley.

Love this.  I look for recipes that sound good, have high ratings, with as few ingredients as possible to make things easy.  This is a great one and very tasty.  Don't get hung up on needing Yukon Gold taters...new white are just as good.  Try using half and half instead of heavy cream if you don't like things so rich.

I LOVE this recipe.  I do make some changes:  I use half the butter and half and half instead of cream.  I add garlic and onion (I like spring onion) or shallot while cooking the leeks.  I don't usually put them in at the beginning but cut them while the leeks are cooking and add them as soon as I am done preparing them.  I add some white wine towards the end of the 15 minutes of cooking the leeks and let it cook off.  When I add the broth, I also add cayenne and ground mustard.  Finally, I use one sweet potato along with any other potatoes I have on hand.  I love the sweet flavor it adds.  I also use my potato masher at the end to mush it all a little bit for a creamier soup.

SO VERY GOOD! We used vegetable broth instead of chicken, added spinach and carrots.  Next time we'll use less butter and try half and half instead.  It's a flexible, delicious recipe!

Like others who tried this recipe, I reduced the butter, used 1/2 and 1/2 rather than cream and added celery. Deliciously comforting.  Thanks for the recipe!

It's bonfire night here in England (Guy Falkes night) and there was a firework display in the park next to my house.  So I made this up with my hubby's home grown veggies to eat outside whilst we watched the fireworks.  Wow!  It was absolutely fabulous.  The only change I made was to use 1/3 Double (Heavy) Cream and 2/3 semi skimmed milk.  But even so it was very creamy and incredibly tasty.  It went really well with my freshly baked crusty bread.  This is a definite keeper and I'll bet you I'll cook it again for the same night next year.  Thank you Julie.

I really like this soup.  I only use 2 tablespoons of butter and a splash of olive oil to saute the leeks.  I added some cayenne for spice which I think it needed.  This soup is sooo easy to make and the finished product is really good vs. the lack of effort that it takes.  Last & most importantly: Puree!! This soup is much better after a quick run in the processor.

I used Swanson Organic Vegetable Broth rather than chicken broth the first time I made this. It was delicious as is, but the second time I added a bay leaf, two additional cups of potato, and an extra leek. It was ultra fabulous!

This was very good.  I agree with the previous reviewers that this in no way needs all the fat that is included in the original recipe.  I used 2 tbsp of butter and 2% milk instead of cream.  I also used 4 leeks and new potatoes instead of Yukons.  I used my immersion blender after it was done cooking to smoothen it up some but still left some potato chunks.  Really delicious.

Great recipe, I made it for friends last night, everyone loved it.  I used half the amount of butter and used half n half instead of cream.  Also added one more leek and Nutmeg along with the salt and pepper because it just goes so well with potato and leek.  Yummy!

Loved it! I used 1/2 the butter as others suggested. I also added 3 chopped garlic cloves and used 3 leeks instead of 2. After the potatoes were cooked, I cooled the mixture down a bit a put into a blender to make a smooth version. I then put back into the pot--brought back up to temperature and then added only 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2. This was still a very rich soup. I served with warm Naan bread.

This soup was awesome.  My son doesn't request much but he absolutely loved this!  I reduced the butter to 3/4 c. - next time I'm going to try with 1/2 c., and instead of 2 c. heavy cream I used 1 c. heavy cream and about 3/4 of a can of 2% evaporated milk.  I also blended it a little with my immersion blender.  I added some shredded cheese on top and it was great!  Next timeI'll add some crumbled bacon as well.  Thanks for this tasty and easy recipe.

Delicious! I didn't peel my potatoes because I like the added color/texture. I added garlic to the leeks, and only used half the butter and cream called for. It is plenty rich with only half! I also partially blended it all up with an immersion blender leaving some potato chucks still whole. Definitely not a bland potato leek soup!

I only gave it 4 stars because I would have liked it to be thicker.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and went with half the butter, and half & half instead of heavy cream. I think next time I'll keep the butter the same (half of what the recipe calls for) but use the heavy cream.

 I served it in a sourdough bread bowl, and garnished with shaved smoked gouda, bacon crumbles and chopped chives. Excellent taste, everyone loved it! I'm just my own worst critic :)

Tried this recipe last night, the soup was delicious and very simple to make. One thing I did change was the amount of butter used, 1 cup was way too much. I used about 1/4 cup to saute the leeks and the soup still had a very buttery flavor to it. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing, will add to my recipe box and make again.

Excellent potato leek soup. I did follow other suggestions to use less butter to saute the leeks. And, I used reduced fat milk instead of cream or half 'n half. It did need some more thickening, so I used a little bit of potato flakes which tightened it up just great.

I added celery and used half and half, the starch from the potatoes will naturally thicken this soup so heavy cream is not necessary.

This was excellent!  I made a few adjustments; 1/2 cup of butter instead of a cup, I also substituted the heavy cream with 1/2 & 1/2 and I used white pepper instead of black.  I also added; 3 cloves crushed garlic, a touch of marjoram and thyme.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is easy, easy, easy and sooooo delicious.  I shared this recipe with my neighbors and they are still raving.  But it got an absolutely RAVE review from my husband, and he NEVER raves.  I made no alterations, except used 1/2 margarine and 1/2 butter to raise the cook temp a little without burning.  I also made this in a deep dish skillet, instead of a saucepan...it cooked faster and more evenly.

Pretty tasty soup. As is, it is a little bland, but I added about 1/4 vermouth and 1/2 tsp celery seed and it perked up. I also added an ear of roasted corn and a couple of celery ribs since we had some in the fridge.

This has become a favorite at my house.  I really didn't think I would be able to get my family to eat leeks, but the mellow flavor of this soup is perfect!  I used less butter and substituted fat-free half/half because we're really health-conscious, and it still tasted sinfully rich!

Great simple recipe.

I added a little garlic when my leeks were almost done and used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Also used whole milk. I added lots of pepper and pureed the whole thing in the blender.

Absolultly wonderful.  I added a dash of tabsco with the leeks (for a very very small hint of flavor) and used my immersion blender at the end, leaving a few little chunks of potato.  It reminds me of when I was in Ireland.

This is probably the best soup I've ever made. Four stars because the amount of butter listed in the recipe is insane. I cut it in half the first time I made this and it was too much still. Now I use about 3/4 of a stick. I only like enough to cook the leeks in, the soup is rich enough with the half and half (yes, no heavy cream either). I also add white pepper, a dash of cayenne, garlic powder and parsley. Yum.

Way less butter, like 2 tbsps, half and half cream, minced garlic. and a bit more cornstarch. Added a can of clams for some protein. And some fresh chopped chives on top. Freezes well too.

Next time I will halve the butter.  I didn't have cream so I used lowfat milk.  And I used russet potatoes.  I added a dash of cayenne and a couple shakes of ground thyme.  Then I used an immersion blender to make it thicker yet still have it chunky.  It was absolutely delicious.  Boyfriend raved. Will make again and again!
#2 - Well I made this again and halved the butter and accidentally bought fat free vegetable broth instead of chicken and used lowfat milk instead of cream.  It's just as delicous as the first time if not better.  Don't forget a dash of cayenne & a couple of shakes of rosemary!

I doubled this recipe but didn't double the butter and it was still delicious. I have a feeling you could cut back on the cream also. Otherwise, a delicious meal even picky non-soup lovers would love.

Excellent soup. I made it with one stick of butter instead of two and it was buttery enough. I also used whole milk instead of heavy cream. I pureed it but I think next time I will leave it chunky. My husband and I both had seconds.

Super super easy! I use half cream, half 1% milk just to help with the fat content. Same goes with the butter - I cut that down. Didn't miss the extra cals. It's still my boyfriends' fave!

The soup was fantastic, every last drop went at our Oktoberfest party.  Like others, I substituted 1/2 c margarine for butter, and 1 cup skim milk + 1 cup light cream for the heavy cream.  I also used vegetable broth (vegetarian), but put bacon, cheddar and parsley on the side (which was also popular!).

This is a winter staple at our house.  I use half the butter and add a little olive oil as needed.  I also had half of a large sweet onion, 4 carrots, and use 4 leeks.  I used about 4-5 large potatoes and 8 cups of veggie stock.  Lastly I use half & half instead of cream.

Quick.  Easy.  Tasty.  I am counting calories so I did only use 1/2 the butter and used 1% milk instead of heavy cream.  The flavor of the leeks comes through nicely.  It was delicious!

Very good!  I did double the leeks and used less butter, thickened with a rue and used water with 2 tbl chicken buillion in place of the chicken broth.  I also used about 1/2 cup heavy cream and some milk.  I will keep this recipe, Thanks!

Very good recipe!  I changed it a little.  I only did about 1/2 cup of butter. When I added the broth, I also added about 1 1/2 cups of addition hot water along with 1 chicken bouillon cube for extra favoring.  I changed the heavy cream to fat-free half&half, and I added a half a bag of fresh spinach to the soup when there was about 15 minutes of cooking time remaining. I finished the recipe by using a potato-smasher to crush the potatoes and spinach.  It came out fabulous!

Great recipe...my first time using leeks. I followed the recipe (with a few additions), and although I used the full amount of butter I will cut it in half next time. I added some minced garlic to it and once everything was soft I used my immersion blender to puree the whole thing. After I had blended it I added crumbled bacon to it. I served the soup with some shredded cheddar cheese on top. My 2.5 year old loved this soup as well as my picky husband, which says a lot. Even though we were full we kept eating it because it tasted so good!

Yummy!  I had 2 leeks and was looking for a good soup recipe, and definitely found a winner.  This soup is also dynamic and other veggies/herbs could easily be added to it.  Some changes I made, 1) instead of chicken broth I used 4 cups of water and 2 chicken boullion cubes 2) I used 1 cup of 2% milk to just make it slightly creamy 3) I only used 1/4 cup of butter for the leeks and added 3 crushed cloves of garlic as well 4) I added 1/4 cup of white wine when cooking the leeks and 5) I added about 1 tbsp of dried parsley to the soup, 1 tsp of ground white pepper, and 1 tsp of nutmeg (suggestion by my mother-in-law) and it actually added a nice smoothness as well.  Using a wooden fork, I mashed as many of the potato chunks in the soup as I could after cooking it (don't have a food processor yet!) which gave it a nice texture, and I garnished with grated cheese.  Will definitely make again with my changes!

I made this yesterday and liked the results.  I made a few minor changes to the original recipe however.  I did 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup evaporated milk & 1 cup half & half instead of the heavy cream, red potatoes with the skins on and added a bit of minced garlic (per another reviewer).  I still think that's sticking fairly close to the original recipe, but with less fat & calories.

I don't typically comment on recipes either way, as I know there are many different styles of cooking and many different tastes.  However, I feel strongly enough to comment on this one.  It was absolutely terrible.  Definitely use the recommendation of halving the butter, and add ham or bacon or ANYTHING else.  I will not be making this again; there are plenty of other soup recipes out there that will not clog my arteries and disappoint my taste buds.

It's close to being an excellent soup. Next time I'll cut way back on the butter and use milk instead of heavy cream as that it made it a bit too rich. With those substitutions, I'm expecting it to be excellent.

This was really great!  Kids didn't like it but that doesn't mean anything! :-)  We doubled the recipe since I had four big leeks and then only used 1 1/2 c butter, but we added a pound of crispy bacon pcs.  It was great.  We also pureed most of the broth and leeks because I wanted to hide the veggies from the kids.  Left potatoes in chunks though.  Used half and half instead of cream.  Really really good!!!  What a perfect recipe for a cool day!!

Perfect for my house as well! This is very, very yummy. If you are reading this don't hesitate. I used 3 leeks and no butter as I felt the cream was enough in the calorie department. Thanks! Smiles from Australia(:

This was so good! And reminded me of soup I've had in Ireland and not found at restaurants here in the states.  However, I made some modifications to the recipe both on purpose and by accident. 1) Used more leeks, added some cloves of garlic 2) only had 1/3 of the broth it called for, so I used water in place 3) forgot to add the cream until very near the end, just heated it up again and served. Also, I had some other root vegetables hanging around, so my version had 2 parsnips and a sweet potato in it. The leeks and butter really contribute most of the flavor, though, regardless of other ingredients. I've read online that potato leek soup can be frozen, so I will try freezing some of the leftovers for a tasty dinner later on.

Great recipe that even my 2 1/2 year old and 6 year old would eat.  I did tweak it a little.  I used a lot less butter, used 5% cream (1 cup) and 1 cup of milk instead of the 2 cups of heavy cream.  I also put in crumbled bacon and towards then end I lightly mashed the potatoes.  I also used sea salt for flavouring.  Very, very nice.

The taste was wonderful but I could not get past the amt. of butter! I took others advice and cut the butter down to 1/2 c. but it was still way too much. I forgot to buy heavy cream so ended up using milk (made me feel somewhat better about the butter) and a little extra cornstrach. It was still nice & thick. Maybe I will try pureeing some next time. Added a small amount of diced carrot for color and made a some bacon to crumble over the top. This was a hit for my boys and has been requested for future soups.

Not the best potato soup that I've had but it was ok. I'm curious how the picture of the potato soup came out white. After I added the chicken broth the soup turned brown. After adding the heavy cream it still didn't turn white. It looked more like gravy than potato soup.

This soup was easy and tasted very good, I will cut the butter a bit next time cause I think its too much but hope it wont cut the flavor. I served with some crusty bread(minus butter)and a small tomato salad. The true test is hubby went back for seconds so that says its good.

Good but a little bland and very, very rich. I think next time I might add a little less butter and maybe some chopped up italian sausage for flavor.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  Especially my husband, who in the past, was disappointed with other potato soup recipes that I had made.  I'm giving it four stars because I still feel like I need to add something else to it, I'll have to play with it a little.

Awesome soup! I had to set aside the sautéed leeks, garlic, and bacon (per reviews) overnight and that resulted in a nice melding of flavors when I finished the soup the next day. It may have cooked a little long, but mashing a couple of the potatoes against the side of the pan made a nice thick, tasty soup. Will definitely make this one again.

i just made this for dinner tonight and am getting ready to go heat up leftovers already! this was my first experience with leeks, and it was perfect. i did make a few changers, based on reviews.  i added two cloves of garlic, a couple of slices of bacon, and used one 12 oz. can evaporated milk and about 2T of fat-free sour cream to get that richness even though i didn't have heavy cream on hand.  i didn't puree anything, but i think next time (and there WILL be a next time!) i might try what another reviewer said and puree the leeks and maybe half of the potatoes. i served it in the italian bread bowls from this site and my husband raved.  MMMM!!!

This soup was absolutely PERFECT as far as potato leek soups go. The only changes I made were using half butter, half margarine; and using evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. Anyway, it was still very rich and creamy and delicious. My 2 year old daughter also loved it, though my picky husband and 4 yr. old son didn't care for it. Too bad for them...it was great!!

*Edit* 11 years after I first tried this recipe, I still make it on a regular basis. However, I now follow the recipe exactly as written, and it is rich, creamy, and delicious. My 3 kids (now 15, 13, and 10) think it tastes like mashed potatoes and gravy. In other words, YUM!

This soup is so good and so simple. It's definitely one of my go-to soup recipes. And while I think it's five stars as written, I have made one small adjustment - I sauté the leeks in half the butter called for, plus about a tablespoon of bacon fat. It adds a deeper flavor that is really yummy.

This was dee-lish!  I only used one stick of butter, 1 cup of heavy whipping cream , 1 cup of half and half and russet potatoes because that was all I had. I poured half the soup in a blender and it's consistency was very creamy. mmmmm.

With two cups of butter my soup was swimming.  What a disaster!  I made it for a church soup night.  All I could do was use paper towels to skim the butter off.  I think 2 Tbsp would have been the right amount.  It has good flavor.

I have used this recipe quite a few times now - very delicious! I always use margarine and milk instead of butter and cream and it tastes great. I also usually mash some of the potatoes before serving which makes it thicker and more consistent. Thanks

This was a fantastic recipe. I was cooking for two different friends (one who is a vegetarian and one who just underwent facial surgery), so I made some variations. I substituted vegetable broth (not stock) for chicken broth, and like other reviewers, I halved the butter and the cream.

I didn't have cornstarch, but didn't need it, since I was planning to puree it. I lightly pureed it with an immersion blender, but left chunks of potato for the veggie friend, and pureed it to a liquid soup for the surgery friend. I can't wait to give it to them both! 

This one's a keeper! I'm on a bit of a diet, so when I make this for myself, I'll probably use milk and less butter as well. Yum!!!

Wish I had seen the revision of this recipe before I made it.  I would never again use that amount of butter.  I also added corn to the soup...delicious.

Very easy and delicious. My kids destroyed this soup and my company asked to take the leftovers home. Be sure to stir when adding the cream, the directions may be deceptively simple for a new cook who doesn't know that cream will separate if poured directly into boiling liquids.

Turned out bland and goopy.  I had followed the recipe and even added some extra garlic.  Will try another recipe next time!

Like other reviewers, I halfed the butter, and put in half and half cream instead of 1 cup and all cream, and it was fantastic!  With half the fat of original recipe :)

So very tasty!

I like this recipe but I do halve the butter and leek and double the potatoes. I prefer some herbs, too, so I add a bay leaf and some oregano. I have lowered the fat by using a mix of half and half and 1% milk rather than cream, then adding some dehydrated potato flakes to bulk it up. It's every bit as good to me.

This is a wonderful recipe for those cold winter nights.  I substituted evaporated milk for the cream and you can't taste much difference.  Also added crumbled bacon.  After soup finished cooking and cooled somewhat I used an immersion blender to make it seem creamier.  So good

I use half the butter and half n half like others have suggested.  Someone also suggested shredded Guyere cheese and real crushed bacon as garnishes.  Brilliant!  My whole family loves this soup and it's now a Christmas day tradition.

This was amazing!!!  I used russet potatoes simply because that was all I had on hand.  And I sauteed some chopped pancetta with the leeks.  I also used MUCH less butter than called for, and used half-and-half rather than heavy cream.  The smell of leeks and pancetta cooking in butter was HEAVENLY!  I used an immersion blender to make it smooth.  This is one of the most delicious things I have ever made.  And super easy with ingredients that I almost always have on hand to boot.  Thank you!

This is a great soup to start with, but I did change it up a bit.  I used 2 full leeks, 5 cups of potatoes, 4 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of vegetable broth, and 2 cups of almond milk.  
I think next time I'll add some bacon or ham and some garlic.
Great tasting and easy to make!

It came out great! I will definitely be making this again. The changes I made were to use only 1/4 cup of butter to saute the leeks and I used 1 cup of half and half instead of the cream.

This was nothing special - and way too much butter, meaning way too salty as well.  Good starting place, but needs some messing with.

Best soup ever.  I did make a few alterations though - I doubled the leeks (can you really ever have enough?!), used vegetable broth as we abstain from non-seafood meat (DO NOT use vegetable stock - it doesn't taste nearly as good) and substituted half & half for the heavy cream.  Excellent!!  Also, this freezes beautifully.  I have to make double batches because I can't keep enough of this soup around the house.

this soup is outstanding! I've already made it twice this week (due to the large amount of leeks that my CSA sent me)! I made it with 1/2 and 1/2 and the first time I used butter and the second time I used Smart Balance...It tasted great both ways!

Way too much butter and fat!  I had a feeling that 1 cup of butter would just be too much, so I used 3/4 of a cup, and that was still way too much.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream, and vegetable broth instead of chicken; with those modifications it was still way too greasy to eat.  If I try making this again, I think next time I will only use a 1/4 of a cup of butter, or maybe even skip it all together, and cook the leeks in a bit of olive oil instead.

This was amazing!!! I used whole milk instead of heavy cream, 1/2 cup butter and added 1/2 tsp red pepper for some extra heat. I blended half the soup at the end then mixed it with the chunky soup.

I like to garnish this soup with fresh chives. I also use duck stock instead of chicken whenever I have it for a richer flavor.

I liked this recipe a lot, but I changed it up quite a bit.  I didn't use much butter at all, and made a big batch but only had two leeks, so it wasn't as strong a flavor.  I didn't use heavy cream, but rather nonfat milk powder.  At the very end, I squeezed a little lemon juice in to brighten it up and served it with grated gouda cheese, bacon bits, and green onions.  Delicious!

I halved the butter and added 1 garlic clove. Added a dash of tabasco sauce.  I used half heavy cream and half half/half.  Was delicious but next time I will use just half/half.  Best soup EVER!

Very good!!! I think I'll add more leeks next time and I will definitely use less chicken broth (the soup was rather thin), but this soup is definitely a keeper! It reheated well, too.

This was so simple and is SO VERY good!  When I got where you add the potatoes...I realized it did not say to add 4 but 4 cups...who does that?! which hung me up for a bit...no way I was going to put the potatoes in water in a measuring cup to find 4 cups...so I just eye balled it (about 4 medium potatoes).  This is an excellent recipe, thank you so very much Julie for sharing it!  BTW, I used half the butter and ALL the cream!

Very nice/comforting, but 1 cup butter is way too much: I used 1/2 cup butter, 4 leeks instead of 2, and used half-and-half instead of heavy cream... and it was still super rich! After it was cooked, I blended 1/4 of the soup in blender, then added it to the remianing soup, because we like chunks in it. The blended quarter thickened it overall nicely, and it became like a delicious thick chowder with chunks, YUM!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. I added a large clove of garlic, 2 Tbsp. cornstarch, 1/2 cup of non-hydrogenated margarine, 2 organic vegetable bouillons + 4 C water and used soy milk in place of the heavy cream. I also pureed half of the soup (it was SO creamy!) I served this with crusty Italian bread. It was delicious! Thank you Julie :)

Super easy and a family favorite! Cut butter in 1/2 and use 1/2 and 1/2 to reduce fat content - for variety add about 2 cups sharp cheddar!

Delicious soup. I only used 1/4 cup of butter and 1% milk instead of the heavy cream. Turned out great. We have this soup all the time, one of our favorites. So quick and easy. Thanks!

Like I saw in many reviews prior I cut the butter down to one stick, used half and half instead of cream, added some minced garlic, held off on adding any salt/pepper and salted to taste after it was blended together... perfect soup for a sore/agitated throat...  ;)

Tasty! I've only just started cooking even after living alone for more than a year.

For this recipe I cut the butter by a little less than half of what the recipe calls for. Also added some other herbs and instead of using cream, I used skim milk. It was really watery when it's supposed to be a creamy soup, so I threw everything into a blender and it came out really nice. The potatoes give it a creamy texture when blended so you don't need to add cream!

This is a wonderful soup for a cold day. I did use half the butter and added a few cloves of garlic and an extra leek.

Wow!  Very tasty recipe.  I used 1 cup 2% milk and 1 cup heavy cream.  Next time I'll just use the heavy cream.  It really does need it in my opinion.  I only had two small leeks so I'll make sure I get bigger ones or use 3 of the small ones next time.  Make sure to tast as you season so you don't use too much salt.  I was surprised how much fresh ground white pepper this needs.  The family loved it and it's a keeper for sure!

I loved this recipe! It was fabulous and the my husband and little boy loved it. I added celery, parsley, and corn to it. And it was really yummy. I also used 1/2 the called for amount of butter and used milk and only about 3/4 C of heavy cream. It was great.

Everybody in the house loved the soup.  I used fat-free half and half, 3/4 of the butter (will probably half next time) and added some minced garlic to the leeks.  We left some potatoes chunky and pureed some.  Will definitely add to my personal recipe box.

I cut the butter in half and mashed the potatoes right in the pot, as my husand doesn't like chunks of potatoes. It turned out pretty good. I froze the remaining soup. The next time we had it, I added 1 large can of Chunky New England Clam chowder and 2 cans of minced clams-juice and all. I liked it more this way plus an easy way to make New England Clam Chowder.

Quick and easy, particularly if you can find someone to prepare the potatoes while you're working on the leeks.  We added a little Tobasco and white pepper for flavor and topped the bowls with sour cream.  Used only 1/4 cup of butter and that was sufficient.  Enjoy!

My family absolutely loves this recipe. I add a few things to mine to thicken it up a bit. Saute' kielbasa with sweet onions and toss it in toward the end, and also add a bit of frozen or roasted corn. Yummy!

We always have oyster stew New Years Eve and I used this recipe for the base this year. I chopped up 2 pints of oysters with their liquor and added them to the soup. Served with crackers, it was a big hit with the revelers.Will do this again next year!

I also used half cream and half evaporated milk, as well as half butter and half low fat margarine to try and make it at least a little lighter. The other thing I strongly recommend, depending on what type of soup you want to serve, is to puree it in a blender or a food processor. It was absolute velvet. It went over hugely as a soup course. I will definitely keep this one!

This is the first leek & potato soup recipe I've made and I won't be looking for another one.  Not only is this easy to make, it's delicious.  I made my own chicken broth and reduced the fat by using a combination of Carnation 2% and regular milk.  I had red potatoes on hand so that's what I used and I kept the skin on for added vitamins.  To thicken it a bit, I added some shredded mozzarella after pouring it hot into bowls.

This soup was SO yummy! I read the reviews/update and used half the butter, half and half in lieu of the heavy cream, added garlic to the leeks while cooking and added some cayenne. First time cooking with leeks for me! I got them in my "farm fresh to you" delivery and searched for a recipe that sounded good. Yours was it! Whole family loved it. Thanks!

I used one cube of butter.  After cooking the chopped leeks I pureed them with the chicken broth called for in the recipe so it came out creamy and not lumpy except for the potatoes. Hubby wanted "chunks of meat" so I prepared lean loin pork roast and added the "chunks of meat" in the soup. Delicious! 100%

This is one of those awesome recipes that is perfect the way it was provided, or it can be doctored to suit one's personal taste! I added some thyme and rosemary, as well as shredded cheese.  So yum! If I am going to eat butter, bring it on! I expect the calories! Thanks for the fabulous dish!

I reduced the butter by 1/2 and added 3 cloves of crushed garlic during the cooking of the leeks. It was delicious and easy to make.  The next day I added some leftover seafood to it and it was a brand new soup.  Nice job!

Great base for my pot luck soup.  Took some advice and added less butter, but included cayenne pepper, onion powder, crushed garlic cloves. No ham so I rolled and sliced prosciutto and tossed it in. Had a little frozen roasted corn and red peppers in the freezer and added that too.  Used the evaporated milk also.

LOVED IT on this icy.... snowy... bright sunny Texas day!

Pot luck soup for a pot luck day!

Very simple for when I feel lazy. I usually add some garlic since I love it. At  the end of cooking I take out some potatoes and leek and using an immersion blender (aka stick blender) blend the soup then I add the veggies i took out and pulse a few times. I think that the taste with heavy cream is not very good so i always use half and half i would give it 3 1/2 stars if possible

Ive never had leeks before. I bought some because I found this recipe and wanted to try it because I love soup. I can eat it everyday in winter. This soup is delicious.  I didnt use heavy cream bcuz I didn't have any and I dont need the extra calories.. I used evaporated milk instead. I loved it. Leeks are wonderful.  Im goin to make it again.

Delicious! I made the same adjustments as everyone else; 1/2 cup of butter, half and half instead of heavy cream. I didn't have enough potatoes so I used parsnips and it was just as good, just needed to sit a bit longer. I also added celery. Instead of seasoning with salt (butter and stock provide enough of that) I used just pepper and garlic powder. This a great basic recipe, definitely will keep and make again. :)

I'm sure this recipe is amazing as is, and I've made it several times, except with vegan ingredients. It changes the recipe quite a bit, but I'd still like to give it 5 stars because it's a simple recipe, it's easy to make vegan, and I think my version is probably just as much a comfort food as the original recipe. Instead of 1 cup of butter, I use 2-3 tablespoons of coconut oil. I use veggie broth instead of chicken, and 1 can of coconut milk instead of 2 cups heavy cream. I also like to add 1 tsp chili powder, and 2 tsp cayenne powder to balance the sweetness of the coconut.

So I was looking for some comfort food WITHOUT A TON OF GUILT.  I made several modifications (so i can't truly rate the original recipe) but I absolutely loved the modified final product!  
-4 T. butter
-2 leeks
-4 cups redskin potatoes chopped
-5 cups chicken broth (I used bouillon)
-1 T. Corn startch
-1/2 cup half and half
-1 1/2 cups non-fat milk
-salt and pepper to taste

I only used 4 T. of butter in which I sautéed the leeks with the lid on (to keep them from drying out).  This only took about 6 minutes on med/low heat.  I added the broth and cornstarch as directed but used 4 cups of Redskin potatoes with the skins still on...  (So good!). Be sure to salt at this point so the potatoes absorb the salt and therefore, some more flavor.  I then boiled the broth and once the potatoes were soft, I mashed 1 1/2 cups of the potatoes and put them back into the soup to help thicken it.  I then added 1/2 cup of half and half and 1 1/2 cup non-fat milk and simmered them for about 20 minutes (be sure not to boil after dairy is added).  I even calculated the calorie and fat content and of the 10 cups produced, each cup is 162 calories and 7.4 grams of fat.

So good! I made without the salt (since my butter and chicken stock were salted), no cornstarch, and used 2% condensed milk in place of cream. 

As per some other reviewers, I also added a little pizzazz: 

+ dash of hot sauce, 1 clove chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp thyme, and pureed the soup once done. 

Also made a topping of: tomato sauce, roasted peppers, sundried tomato - pureed together, added on the finished soup as a decorative, tasty swirl on top, along with a bit of crumbled bacon.

YUMMY!!

I love this soup! The only things I do different from the recipe are add carrots,  mild cheddar,  and I make extra potatoes (2 cups) and blend them with about a cup of the chicken broth to thicken up the soup.  I just made a fresh batch and I can't wait to devour it!  :)

Such a great recipe! It's super creamy and delicious, and is a perfect lunch to take to work with some pumpernickel or sourdough. 

I made a few adjustments after trying it out the first time. I took advice from others: halved the amount of butter and substituted half&half for the cream. I also added about two sprigs of rosemary and two cloves of garlic roughly chopped. Also, after the potatoes were nice and tender, I blended the finished soup that it was creamy instead of chunky. A wonderful outcome that I'll certainly be making again.

This recipe was delicious. I used half the butter and half and half instead of cream. I used some kind of giant white onions (looked just like a leek, only a lot cheaper)instead of leeks. Added 3 cloves of chopped garlic during sauté. I also blended half of the soup to make it a little thicker and smooth. Very easy to make. Everyone, including kids, loved it. If you are using chicken broth, don't add any more salt.

Nice! I used coconut milk because I am diary intolerant, added more leeks, cut down significantly on the butter as did other reviewers, and added parsley during the puréeing process. A great dairy free creamy soup.

Love this recipe!  It's perfect just the way it is.  I have added a couple of carrots to enhance the flavor and it adds a sweeter touch.  My family loves this so I make it for just about every gathering so the kids can take some home.

I altered mine slightly and it didn't need the cream (so less fat, right).
I used about 8 leeks (chopped/sliced thin), about 5 cooked potatoes, and 48 oz of chicken broth. I cooked the leeks first in a little olive oil until soft then added the cooked and chopped potatoes. Once that cooked tighter for a about 5 minutes I added the chicken broth and let come to a boil. Next i used my immersion blender and pureed it. Add S/P and serve HOT.

Really good and I never cooked with leek before I tried this.

Hearty, flavorful soup -- and super easy to make. I used half the butter and substituted low-fat cream cheese for the heavy cream. I only had russet potatoes on hand, and it came out great.

I've made this twice now and it is FANTASTIC.  It's so easy and so filling.  I did as others suggested.  I added 4 cloves of crushed/coarse chopped garlic to the leeks.  I only used 1/2 cup of butter and used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup half and half.  When it's done I pureed it with a hand blender/immersion blender.  I am a big black pepper fan so I am pretty liberal with that too.  I also froze it in several containers and it freezes really well - comes out as delicious and smooth as when it's fresh.

This is a good base recipe. I added roughly 1/2 cup of butter after reading some of the reviews and it was more than enough. I will try 1/3 cup next time. I had about 1 cup of half and half and used that plus skim milk instead of the heavy cream. I added green onion to the leeks mainly just to use them up before they spoiled; same goes for a sweet potato I used to replace one potato. I also added chili powder, half of a jalapeno and bacon. I blended the soup after it boiled as well. For next time, I won't add as much spice because it hid the leek flavor. The soup wasn't very creamy but I didn't expect it to be given the half and half and skim milk. The bacon added a lot to the soup and I would use it again.

Made this today and it is really yummy.  I love dishes that only require a few ingredients and minimal prep to pull together.  I also used just 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter and used half n half instead of cream.  Also added garlic towards the end of cooking the leeks - because I add garlic to everything!  My family loves clams so now that I know this recipe is a keeper, can't wait to try it that way - as the original poster suggested.

Lots of bang for your buck on this one. Simple and delicious. However, I did cut down the amount of butter and cream, added a bouquet garni of sage, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf, Then sprinkled with bacon crumble as a garnish. Will make again!

Great recipe. I halved the butter and used 1 cup half/half cream and 1 cup skim milk. I also added 5 cloves garlic to the leeks, 1 cup shredded old cheddar and 6 slices crumbled bacon right before serving. Delicious!

Liked this recipe.  But only used enough butter to cook the leeks.  Added 3 cloves of garlic, minced and a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes.  This is a keeper.

I only use 1 stick of butter, and add soft-cooked bacon to the soup while it is cooking. This is a great recipe to use as a base and alter for your own needs. Drop the corn starch and use a wand blender to mash some of the potatoes for a heartier chowder.

Definitely use less butter than called for. 1 stick and doubling the amount of leeks was a good proportion and resulted in an excellent end result. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the heavy cream because that's what I had on hand.

I loved it. I also used some garlic when preparing the leeks, significantly reduced the butter, added nutmeg and used half& half vs cream. I doubled up since I had the ingredients and used my imersion blender. I'm already getting requests for more. Thank you for making me look like a great cook!

I only used 2T of butter and then made a roux after sautéing the leeks.  Milk worked just fine in place of cream - threw in a piece of leftover bacon I add as well.  Lightly crushed potatoes as we like it chunky and then served with shredded cheddar on top.  Delicious! Thanks so much for the recipe.  Note to self:  I didn't measure out potatoes as I only had 3 small ones left, so I cubed, used enough broth to cover potatoes, then added about a cup of milk.

I thought this recipe was good. I made this for my Mom after she had dental surgery. Per some of the recommendations, I only used half a cup of butter and substituted the cream for half and half. I also used red potatoes since that was what I had on hand. The soup was a bit bland at first, so I added a tablespoon of garlic, some parsley and just a little cayenne.

LOVE this soup!!  We make it with a vegetarian no-chicken broth and then I add a little bit of poultry seasoning.  I don't use heavy cream but will add rice milk or 2% milk.  It's delicious!!!

This was really good!  I made following changes:  used half the butter, used white baby potatoes with skin on, and used half and half v. heavy cream.  I also used an immersion blender at the end to thicken soup.  I topped with bacon crumbles and served with crusty bread.

This was very good.  I followed the recommendations and 1/2'd the butter and used half and half.  I also added a little dill and stirred in some gouda after it was off of the heat.  Delicious!

My husband absolutely loved this soup.  I made a few adjustments because I didn't have any leeks!  I added 1 cup of finely chopped carrots and 2 cups chopped cabbage. Also, I shredded the potatoes instead of dicing them which gave the soup a very nice texture.  At the very end I added 2 lbs of cooked ground beef.  The best soup I have ever made!

I LOVE this soup & have made it twice in the last 2months; first time with less butter using fat free half &half, second time (because it's the holidays), with half the butter but with full fat cream.  I did add generous sprinkling of nutmeg as recommended by another reviewer.  Both attempts were out of this world.  Thank you for the recipe!

great basic recipe for a great soup!  I pureed some of the soup for a creamier texture, cut down on the butter to a half cup, added a pinch of cayenne pepper and added garlic as another reviewer suggested.  this is going in the rotation for sure.

Made as directed but added a little crushed garlic with leeks, and then added cooked bacon (6 slices). Used white pepper and was very gentle with the salt. Great recipe, it is going in the binder as a favorite! Thanks!

I skipped all the dairy products except the butter and the soup was still excellent.  Tried a variation with left over ham from my freezer and it was good, but better without.

Very simple and easy. For first timers don't forget to rinse your leeks well in a strainer to get out all of the grit. I used Fat Free Half and Half and added  table spoons of Part Skim Ricotta, A dash of dried/crushed red pepper, and home made bacon bits (about 5 slices bacon) I like the potato chunks but would be good pureed as well.

I followed this recipe as written aside from substituting half & half (because that's what I had on hand) for the heavy cream. It's easy, delicious to anyone including picky eaters (the leeks cook down so much you don't even know they're in the soup) and also makes a great base for any kind of chowder. Maybe it was because my leeks were small, but the leek flavor wasn't "strong" to me. In fact, I will add at least one more leek next time. To me, this is the epitome of comfort food.

WOW - was looking for a recipe like this for ages!  I did not have heavy cream, so I substituted a can of condensed mushroom soup and 1 cup of milk (6 servings).  I then added a handful of chopped squid.  Following the recommended cooking time, I tossed everything in the blender.  Delicious!! Thanks for getting me started!!

Awesome, awesome soup. I, like others, halved the butter and substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream. I also added a can of clams! So good! It makes the best leftovers!

I received leeks in my green box and potato leek soup seemed like the obvious answer.  Over all, this recipe was very good and easy to make.  It does have way too much butter.  Next time I will probably cut it in half.

Super easy and very delicious! I just added a bit of Worchester sauce and did 1 3rd cream and 2 3rds skim milk as I didn't have enough cream. Still found it plenty rich, so will probably do the same next time.

This is the best soup I've ever had! Seriously. 

I made a few small changes, but your recipe has provided me with a base for the most amazing soup - I used vegetable stock instead of chicken so I could share with my vegetarian friend, used 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter instead of the full cup called for and added some fresh green beans that I got at the farmer's market. My goodness, this soup is like HEAVEN IN A BOWL!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! It's absolutely delish!

Good soup.  We reduced the butter to half cup - but if I had a bunch more leeks, maybe would use more - hard to say for sure.

I made this recently for 15 people.  It was delicious and so easy.  Everyone was so impressed with my soup and lots asked for the recipe.  I had changed the quantities to make a large batch and mine ended up being a little too thin for my preference so I just took a hand mixer right into the pot and mixed it up for a few minutes and it thickened it right up but still left nice chunks.

This soup was a big hit for Sunday dinner! I did cut the amount of butter in half and used half and half instead of heavy cream. The soup did improve a thousand times over when I decided to puree it in the blender. My brother, who doesn't even like soup, raved about this. Will definitely make again!

Fantastic! I used half and half and 1/2 cup butter. It Was extremely flavorful. We ate it with sourdough baguette bread. 

I even made chips from the potato skins (I felt inspired lol).

My family and I love this recipe, so much in fact I don't know if it's better the next day because there are NEVER any leftovers! I even goofed on my first attempt at this recipe, almost completely forgetting the cream, yet it still came out wonderful. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I know this recipe is high in fat, but it's delicious and simple to make. My boyfriend can't get enough of it, and begs me to make it. I took it to a potluck, and it was devoured. I usually double the recipe just to keep it around for a few days.

When it was time to add the heavy cream I also added some chunks of leftover ham I had from Easter.  It was fantastic!  I'll be making this again!

Great soup.  Simple flavors that work very well together.  I especially liked that this recipe did not use bacon as, in my opinion, it would over power the delicate flavor of the leeks.    I sprinkled it with chopped chives and served it alongside sliced and toasted baguette topped with melted Gruyere.  Needless to say, it was a huge hit!  My husband LOVED it and complained that I didn't make enough.    Note: I did cut the butter in half and used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Also, since I pureed the soup I didn't feel the need for cornstarch.  It was wonderful.  Thank you.

I upped the yield on this recipe by one-half (making twelve servings).  I also looked for a recipe that didn't call for bacon or ham; while either would be a welcome enhancement,  I simply had neither in the house.  I will be eating it all week at work.  I did make a few changes.  I more than tripled the amount of leeks, used three-quarters of the called -for butter (unsalted), and used half-and-half instead of the called-for cream.  I also added a tsp of salt and a half tsp of ground black pepper to the sauteeing leeks (remember that I was making twelve servings...) (I was amused by the number of times the recipe had you adding salt and pepper....).  I also ran my immersion blender through the completed soup.I had a quick taste before putting my tub of soup in the fridge (Vichyssoise, anyone?).  Was very tasty.  Seasoning was about right, I think.  Thanks for posting.

This soup was excellent.  I had never used leeks in anything before, and found out that I liked them.  I did use half and half just to cut the fat a little.  The second time I made this, I used white onions instead of the leeks.  Still very delicious.  Today I am making it again with the leeks.  This has now replaced my previous favorite potato soup.  Family loves it too!

This soup is amazing. The only things I do change is to cut the butter in half and use half and half cream. It is still delicious, and a little bit healthier. Every time I make this soup, everyone has loved it.

I went heavier on leeks, used about 2 T butter with little olive oil, 2 c half & half, and skipped cornstarch.  Blended majority.  Next time, leave more leeks whole, and use 1-2 T bouillon too.

Oh my goodness this soup is outrageously good.  I know, butter and all that cream is not the most healthy ingredients, but, oh man, it's awesome.  The only thing I changed was to add a little garlic (which I almost always do), and I also use the boat motor to make it a puree.  At the very end, I add a small pile of shredded cheese - Parmesan or Romano - and then a small little pile of bacon pieces on top of that.  (REAL bacon - not bacos.)  Every time I make it, I wonder why I don't make it more.  Then I remember the cream and butter.  But once in a while?  Awesome.

OMG Great Soup!  I added a tsp. of red pepper and threw in left over mash potatoes about 1/1/2 cups and 8 quartered baby reds with skins vs. the Yukon since I did not have those on hand.  All ingredients were organic except the red pepper.  This was so tasty and healthy it only served 4 vs. 8 with no bread just a simple green salad!

Good chicken stock made this soup awesome, instead of cream I used milk, it was soupier but tasted fantastic.  I also did not use cornstarch and I sauteed the leek with onion and garlic in olive oil before adding the chicken stock and potatoes.  Turned out fantastic, thank you!

This is the second time I have made this recipe. Followed as is (although this time I didn't have yukons on hand and had to sue red potatos). Both time equaled the same results - DELICIOUS! It turns out to be a creamy, filling soup, with lots of subtle flavors that make it a perfect chilly afternoon dish. I paired it with some homemade cheddar biscuits (liek red lobsters makes). Perfect as a meal all by itself!

Yum!  I diced red potatoes with the skin on, like another reviewer, and halved the butter as others suggested.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  I also added cooked chopped turkey bacon while the soup was simmering, which certainly didn't hurt the soup (but had more to do with me getting rid of a bunch of turkey bacon).  I stirred in celery salt, garlic powder, and a small drizzle of Sriracha hot chili sauce.  So while this isn't exactly low-calorie soup, it wasn't quite as high-fat as the original recipe would have made it!  Very comforting on a cold October night.

One of our family's favorites!!! Even our 1 year old loves it! I always make a huge batch-I use a whole 5 lb. bag of butter potatoes and 2 med. sized leeks.  After cooking the leeks in 1 cup of butter, I thicken with ~6 tbsp. flour mixed in ~2 cups of broth .  Then I added the rest of the 48 oz. can of chicken broth and potatoes.  Once they were soft after simmering a while, I blended with a hand-blender until smooth, mixed in about 2-3 cups of whole milk, and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Absolutely delicious every time and great to freeze for later!  Thanks so much Julie for the great recipe!

This is a great base recipe!  Trying to make it as healthy as possible, I cut down on my butter (using only 4 tbsp),  I used 2% evaporated milk instead of cream, and used half potatoes and half cauliflower.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder, rosemary, and thyme.  Finally, I blended it together to resemble a more creamy soup.  It's an awesome recipe to play around with- will make again!

Only changes that I made was to add some roasted garlic. My family loves smooth cream soups and so I use my stick blender to it before serving. My husband added some leftover crumbed brown sugar bacon to garnish on night. I think we may have to make a batch of this along with the soup each time! YUMMY!

fantastic soup. reading advice by other reviewers: i added fresh, chopped garlic cloves (around 4 large ones) with the leeks. i also threw in cayenne when the leeks were almost cooked. after adding the broth: i sprinkled in some oregano. cut the cream by half, and substituted with milk. also, i added a little extra broth! super easy, and so delish...!

I've made this twice and loved each time.  The only differance is that I thicken by adding 2 tbs flour to the leeks and butter before adding broth and use evaporated milk instead of heavy cream.  Thanks for sharing!

This is pretty good.  I used 1/2 the butter and milk instead of cream.  I added bacon and cheese.  I might make it again, couldn't really taste the leek. :/

I combined the fat-free half and half (not cream) with the cornstarch and added them after combining the potatoes and leeks. I let the soup boil for about 5 minutes, then pureed it with an immersion blender. I also added white pepper and a little nutmeg, as was suggested by other reviewers. It turned out excellent and there was none left!

i made this today...it was pretty good, especially with some crusty bread.  next time i make it, i will substitute some of the cream for milk and definitely use less butter.  this version was just a little too heavy.  otherwise, it was the perfect soup for a cold day.

This is a 3 star recipe the day of, but a 5 star recipe the day after.  It definitely needs time for the flavors to meld and become more complex.

I am allergic to dairy, so I use non-dairy creamer and non-dairy margarine in place of the cream and butter.  I am told that it is just as good as the original! (I make both at parties)  Love this recipe!!

I think this recipe was great as a jumping off point.  Like so many other people I only used half the butter called for and replaced the heavy cream with half-and-half and I don't think the soup suffered any for it.  I also added garlic, which is standard for me.  I think that the best addition was a heavy dose of white pepper and red chili flakes to contrast with the creamy taste and texture.  The next time I make it I think I will add another leek or two as well.

This is a very quick and easy recipe that tastes delicious.  I followed the recommendations for halving the butter and using half&half instead of heavy cream.  This is already a repeat recipe for me!

This soup is simple and fantastic. I got comps. from hubby on this.

The only thing I did different was to wait until the potatoes were tender to add the cream. I don't think you should boil the cream too long.

Such a wonderful recipe. To cut back on some of the calories I replaced the heavy cream with half & half.  It was wonderful.  I also cut the butter in half which caused no issues and was a great way to cut out some of the fat.  What a great meal to have as a comfort food!

Very bland! This needs more leeks as I couldn't taste them at all. I reduced the butter to only 2 tablespoons and added a stock cube (along with the liquid stock) to boost up the flavour. Needs plenty of salt & pepper.

This was wonderful!!! My husband is a very very picky eater and he loved it! I added minced garlic to the leeks and used 1/2 cup of butter and used whole milk instead of cream. Also, to add protein and make it a meal, I added crumbled Italian sausage. Delicious!

We enjoyed this very much. I did add 1 more leek than the recipe called for and it was delish! I didn't mash any of the potatos or blend any of it (as otrher reviewer's did) and felt that it had a great consitatancy. Thanks for the recipe.

I found this recipe to be very good.  Taking others advice, I cut down the butter to 1/2 cup.  Also, I added a can of corn.  Next time I think I will add more leeks and use even less butter.  The recipe made about 5 bowls worth.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

This was a delicious soup.  I added garlic when cooking the leeks and a few more leeks than called for.  I also blended the whole batch at the end for a creamy consistancy.  I served with crushed black pepper and a dash of parmesan

I made this soup tonight and followed the recipe to the tee but took one reviewers advice and used 2% milk. When I checked on it a few minutes later the milk had totally curdled. What went wrong? The flavor is really good but I don't think I can feed it to my famiy. :(

Okay...I saved it!! I put the soup in the blender and it turned out great! With some warm sourdough, my kids could'nt get enough!!

Made this for my daughter who is a fan of 'The Palm's' Potato leek soup and she ate the entire pot.  Also followed user's suggestion who added shallot and garlic as well as wine toward the end of cooking the leeks.  Oh - and also added some cayenne pepper (if you are looking for just a kick).  Pureed the soup in a  blender and it was really great!

Awesome soup! Mine did come out the same colour as in the photo - so to the reviewer who said hers was brown, I would suggest not letting your butter brown at the beginning.  Use medium heat and add the leeks once the butter has melted halfway - don't wait for all the butter to melt first.

I used 3 cups of half and half cream, 4 cups chicken broth, and a half cup of butter with the two leeks and it was perfect. Also added 1 tsp chopped garlic to leeks at the beginning.

I will be making this again!

Definitely followed others with 1/2 the butter, and used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup lighter dairy.  Super duper pureed to get all lumps out...delicious!  One of my daughters keeps asking me for it again too, so it's a winner.

Yum, yum!  I also halved the butter and cream, and used flour instead of corn starch.  Creamy, rich flavor.  I will use this recipe again!
P.S. - We had roasted cauliflower for dinner at the same time as this soup and my husband discovered that dipping his cauliflower in the soup was great too.  Next time I make this, I may very well add some roasted cauliflower after pureeing.

Great soup, not for the folks with clogged arteries!

To further add to the heart stopping goodness, add bacon!  It was a great addition.

My boyfriend had been bugging me to make potato leek soup, which I've never tried my hand at, although I love making soup from scratch. So on a particularly rainy day I decided to give it a go. The only alteration I made to the recipe was I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 to cut back on some of the fat and calorie content. It was still amazing, we had one family member over and between my boyfriend and her the pot was gone by the end of the night. Fantastic, I look forward to making this again when the weather turns. Amazing recipe!

So delicious.  I made a few changes too:  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and sauteed the leeks in one half cup of butter instead of the one - it turned out fine.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. I loved that it had chunks of potato which you usually don't have in potato soup. It always ends up being creamy.

This soup is awesome!  Taking the advice of others, I cut the calories and salt down by using 3/4 c butter, a 14oz can of evaporated milk and a half a container of heavy cream.  I also did not add the salt assuming that people could add it to their bowls.  In addition I added two sliced carrots for color and some smoked ham just because hubby likes to see meat somewhere, any where on the table.  Oh, and my grocery store did not have leeks so I used green onions.  Next time if I have to do that substitution again, I'll use more green onion.  I also cut about a quarter of the potato pieces into smaller pieces knowing they would cook into mush and make the soup even thicker.  This soup is definitely going in my recipe box to use at least once a month.  Yum!

Oh my... this recipe was scary-good. My 6 y/ old son- who will normally only eat PB & J's, and chicken nuggets, inhaled this soup! He LOVED it! He even ate the leaks (despite the well known kindergartner law that says that green things are yucky unless covered in sugar and or chocolate) 

Recommendations: The only thing I would change about the recipe is perhaps to cut the butter down to 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. I loved the rich flavor the butter and cream gave, but there was a teensy weensy bit too much butter for hubby and my daughter's liking. Although, they too raved over the soup. (we had no leftovers!)

This soup was very good.  To make is vegitarian I used vegitable stock instead of the chicken stock.  
I did make a few alterations.  I used 1.5 cups of margerine and .5 cups of oliive oil which I think made it richer, I too supstitued half and half instead of the cream and it was very creamy with the half and half.  I also added a half of onion and 3 cloves of garlic to the leeks while they were cooking and added the half and half to the mixture and then gave it a whir with my hand held blender then added the potatoes and soup.  Very good indeed and will be making this again.

I have made this recipe many times in the last few years. I have recently made some changes to make it with less fat for a healthier version.  I only use 1/2 cup butter, no cornstarch for thickening as the Yukon Gold Potatoes have a natural thickening  when boiling, and I use Fat Free Half and Half to substitute the heavy cream.  The added salt and pepper right before serving seems to bring all the flavors together nicely.

I did add thyme and used an emersion blender to make it creamy.  Those were the only changes.  I had chopped leftover ham on the side.  Really delicious!!  Will try the lower fat suggestions next time.

This turned out to be excellent. When I first made it, there was not much flavor, but as it sits the leeks really released their flavor.  I made this to accompany a sausage sauerkraut recipe that I found on this site. I normally make it with a German potato salad, but wanted a soup as it is Winter; it went great together.

I did not have cornstarch so I added 1/4 c of flour to the sauted leeks and then added the chicken broth. I also added leftover turkey with the potatoes and it came out fabulous! I will definitely make this again.

I change this somewhat, every time I make it -- I use whole milk, 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, and cook two chicken breasts in some chicken broth (or chicken bone broth) first and shred/add the chicken.  Also add kale, corn, carrots, and other veggies if I have them in my fridge.  Cook chopped onions/garlic with the leeks, use less than a half stick of butter.

I made this with a few changes from other reviewers. it would have been ok as it was, but I added about 2/3 cup carrots, I did and an onion, I doubled the recipe but I halved the butter to 1c and not 2. I also added about a tbsp of fresh parsley, a tsp of pepper to taste and about 2 tsp of salt and lastly I added about a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of thyme.  The boys like it but said it needs cheese, what can I say kids... All in all I think it turned out very well. one more thing, I used an immersion blender to make it creamy.

Made this for the first time on Sunday. I couldn’t find leeks in my grocery store so used green onion instead. I also used half & half ( had to use a little more cornstarch than it stated) instead of the heavy cream, I also used 11/2 sticks of butter instead of the full 2 it required. This soup was great!! My family loved it. The next night I pan fried some left over cabbage I had and poured the soup over it, which made it even better!! I will definitely keep this as my go to recipe!!

Sorry to say that even though I have never had to give a not so great review of anything on All Recipes, I cannot give this particular recipe a good review. Tasted like wallpaper paste and looked the same. I think the cornstarch is to blame. I've never used it in soup before and NEVER will again, no matter what is called for.  Sorry to say it was not good and my usual leek and potato soup is always superb. Won't be doing this one again.

I followed the recipe without any alterations. It had a delicate, but full bodied flavor, explicitly French! 
I may play with it a bit, trying more thyme next time I prepare.

This was an easy soup to make. I used about half of the butter and half and half instead of heavy cream, like others had suggested. The first night we added some bacon crumbles. Then we used the left overs for lunch and added some cubed chicken. I could see adding crab or lobster as well. I will make this again!

I used half and half instead of cream just to reduce fat content a bit. Also used cornstarch to thicken a bit as my mother in law has celiac. I like bold flavor so the amount of leeks in this recipe gives you a nice level of leek flavor. I liked this recipe, very easy.  Do not underestimate the value of thoroughly cleaning between the leek leaves....one gritty spoonful would ruin the whole pot. Yuck.  Take the time and be thorough.

Stop reading now if changes make you crazy...
Happened to have (almost) everything on hand to make this - but only one large leek from the farmer's market.  So I used a bit more of the darker green leaves, and put them into the pot with the butter about 10 - 12 minutes before adding the rest of the leek - I read that the greener leaves are stronger in taste and can be used if they're cooked down longer to make them tender.  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic once the leeks were mostly cooked.  I also only used about 1/2 stick of butter (so that would be around 1/4 cup), and did not add the cream until after the soup had cooked thoroughly.  Instead of 2 cups of cream, I used one cup (heavy),  about 1/2 cup light (all I had) and topped off with 2% milk.  I also pureed (stick blender), but not completely, so there were still some chunks of potato and chopped leek.  I added 2 cans of clams (as per the original poster's own review) in order to add some protein and serve as a meal.  Let everyone sprinkle cooked bacon on top of their servings and made homemade croutons out of some hamburger rolls that were slightly past their prime.  This was very good!  REHEATED for lunch next day - added more chicken broth to thin it, and added frozen grilled chicken to make it a meal.  SO GOOD!

The flavor from the leeks is so delicious. What a comforting soup! I could eat it all day!! One stick of butter is fine, and even cutting it down to the one cup of half and half I had in the fridge the second time I made this didn’t hurt the flavor one bit!!! Mash some of the potatoes after cooking to thicken it a little. So perfect.

It's disappointing... it smells good, but is so bland! Even when topped with parmesan... I used half the required butter, because the original amount seemed insane. Still with half, that much butter leaves an oily film on top of the soup, which I'm not a fan of. I've made the recipe twice, hoping to make it better, without no avail.

Delicious!  I followed to recipe pretty closely but reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 and 1/2 cream instead of heavy cream.  Being Italian, we grated some parmessan cheese on top prior to serving and this was the best!  Highly recommend and will definitely make again.

It turned out well and I followed the recipe exactly. I found the soup to be too watery. I will change to the following next time:
1. cut out most of the butter (not needed) 
2. Substitute olive oil for butter in the saute portion. 
3. More potatoes and less chicken broth
4. Add garlic and shallots to the saute
5. Add Parmesan or other cheese as a finisher

This is a simple, easy recipe that I used as a base for my chicken artichoke soup. I  used half the btter and substituted the heavy cream wit half and half to make it a lighter fare. I actually split the finished soup in two batches and used half as potato leek and the other half as chicken artichoke.  For the chicken artichoke sop,  I added artichokes hearts (in water) added cubed, chicken and topped it off with melted cheddar jack cheese.  Delicious.

I did not use yellow potatoes....not really a fan, so I used russet potatoes and I added alot (4 TBSP per 1½ batch of soup) of Toum (Lebanese garlic sauce for potatoes). When I was finished I added a topping mixture if chopped chives, crispy bacon and parmesean. I will most definitely make this again!! My family loved it and wants me to make it regularly. Thank you for the recipie.

Turned out great, delicious!  When finished I mashed the soup with a potato masher which made it more creamy.  Also added a small amount of Aleppo pepper for a little kick.

Very flavorful. Since it was my first trial with leeks, I give it a 4 because I think it can be better.  I had wild leeks gathered from local woods- probably 15 skinny stems made about 3/8 of a cup of sliced leeks for the soup and 30 leaves for salads.  With that amount, i used 3c broth and 1.5 c half and half. The leek flavor seems a little milder than I was looking for however it was very good.  My adjustments for next time will be to use less potatoes, broth, and cream or more leeks.

The only reason I didn’t give it a five is because I did something a little different. Instead of adding two cups of cream I boiled two whole medium  potatoes. I mashed the potatoes, added about two tablespoons of sour cream  and whipped them with a mixer.  I added the mixture into the broth with all the other ingredients. I only used about a cup of the cream but you can add accordingly to desired consistency. I also added cubed butternut squash with potatoes and simmered on low to keep the potatoes firm. We had a salad and French baguette. There was none left.  Cooked this way was definitely a five.

Made it as listed but used coconut cream instead of whipping cream. I think it could use half the butter and half the cooking time (my stove runs hot I guess). Delicious anyway!!

Absolutely outstanding! This was my first time making potato leek soup and it was not only delicious but really easy to make. I ended up freezing half the batch and the leftovers still rocked.

I added only 1 cube of butter instead of 2, and I also added garlic salt.  It tasted really good!

This soup is delicious. I used all butter, I used full fat coconut milk instead of cream, I added some fresh garlic to broth stage, and used tapioca starch instead of cornstarch. It came out amazing, my husband and I almost ate the whole pot!

This soup was great! I cut the leeks small because I prefer them that way. Topped with a little hard Parmesan, and served with sourdough toast.

I made this soup pretty much as written with a little garlic salt, parsley and Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute (which I add to everything!) I also added a little cooked crumbled bacon at the end. It was delicious!

I didn’t have everything so I used russet potatoes & whole milk, also use veggie broth not chicken. It turned out amazing!!! I didn’t really measure the potatoes I just added around 5 at first. I used my immersion blender to make smooth then added about 4 more potatoes to have some chunks. My whole family loved it!!! I also threw in a handful of parsley before serving.

I modified the recipe a tiny bit. 
- I used beef broth instead because it was all I had. 
- I omitted the cream. 
- I puréed the soup before serving because it’s how I know potato leek soup should be. 

So flavorful!  So rich even without the cream!

I would definitely make this again because it was easy and pretty tasty. I knew I should have trusted my instinct and added the cream AFTER simmering. I followed the directions and the cream separated while simmering like I thought it might. It had an unpleasant texture but really good flavor.

has a wonderful taste - but would definitely use the original cook's suggestion to halve the butter and use half and half.  the butter just floats on top.  other than that this was excellent!

My  husband and I both enjoyed this soup! Because it was just the two of us, I cut the recipe in half. To lighten it up a bit, I used half milk and half cream, instead of all cream. This made a great Sunday lunch on a cold winter day, and it was super easy to make. Will make again!

This soup turned out awesome, but you do need to make changes to it which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Cut butter in half and use half and half. I also added 3 cloves minced garlic, 2 shallots, teaspoon of cayenne pepper, teaspoon of celery salt, and a scoop of truffle carpaccio. Mmmmmmm!

I made this with russet potatoes & whole milks because they were on hand. I also used a quarter of the butter. I thought it would be too bland, I was right. I would have added another leak, garlic to the sauté and next time I think I would use another cup of broth and one cup of milk. Additionally, I would add some herbs. Maybe a little tarragon to compliment the chicken broth. But I was looking for a little more flavor and not too rich. Great base recipe though!

I took OP's advice and cut the butter in half. I meant to use half the cream but my hand just didn't stop pouring and it was absolutely lovely anyway.  Will make again and my mother-in-law wants the recipe.

I used Almond milk, instead of cream, to  reduce the dairy in it and I used more potatoes, to ensure a thicker consistency, it's EXCELLENT!

Great way to use up an abundance of potatoes. I agree with other reviewers on these points:
Half the butter; half and half cream is fine; it lacks a little in seasoning. I added garlic, a pinch of cayenne, onion powder, and generous white pepper. I also blended with an immersion blender.

Easy, delicious, and simple. All things, as a mom of two littles, that I like!
I made the recipe as is, but could have cut the butter in half. Added some bacon pieces and voila!

Great taste but there was so much butter it would not all soak in.  I would make it again but would cut the butter in half.  I also found it better tasting the next day.  The leeks were more enhanced.   Chopped bacon as a garnish was  a nice touch.

1. I used all three leeks that came in the bunch and just added another TBS of  Butter

2. I added more potatoes (total 4 cups) because it was the end of the bag

3. I added two more cups of chicken broth ( I use Better Than Bouillon)

The rest stayed the same and it's been a hit. My mom's church luncheon gals are all wanting the recipe! I'd add a photo, but it's gone! ;-)

I used no-sodium veggie broth cause it's what I had on hand, some chicken better-than bullion, added some garlic, garlic salt and onion powder at the end, and subbed in half and half for the cream and halved the butter like the creator recommended in her comments. Turned out FRICKIN AMAZING

This was a 5 star dinner! I followed the recipie almost exactly, although I found I needed to add quite a bit more corn starch to achieve the consistency I wanted. I served this soup in hollowed out, individual-sized, sourdough bread bowls and it was a huge hit! This soup is great fresh, but it’s even better reheated the next day after the flavours have had time to bloom.

I've made this soup at least once a month, usually twice, since I found it in the winter of last year. everyone Ive ever introduced it to, loves it and thinks Im a cooking god haha. If youre a british or non-american making it - leeks and potatoes are basically 2:1, minus around 10-15% on the potatoes.We don't have cups so that's how we've figured it. We also can't get heavy cream here, so we substitute with a butter and milk mix. You can find this substitution mix on the net. It turns out great every time. It's mine and my fiances best ever recipe on here. It's amazing.

Delicious soup!! I followed the recipe exactly (except for adding more leeks and potatoes, I wanted to use up what I had bought) and my whole family loved it!

Good flavor. I might cut out, or reduce, butter and sub in olive oil next time I make it.

What a great recipe!! I doubled it, mostly, all except the butter. I only used maybe half a stick of butter. Excellent flavor, I even added carrots at the end. I probably would not at them again though, as they added a little too much sweetness for my liking. Overall I will keep this recipe for ever and make it again because it is so good!

I made this following the recipe, except I used evaporated milk in  place of cream, plus 1 1/2 C. of sharpe cheddar shredded
.  It was wonderful, but too much for one person.  So I shared with two friends, and they both loved it and wanted the recipe!  I gave it too them and they love it.

My family loved the recipe! I added a cup of ham and a tub of sliced mushrooms. Next time I’ll double the ham, add 2-3 cloves of garlic and halve the butter. It’s a delicious and easy soup!

I make this every month.  Oh I add Lemon juice and nutmeg and parsley always- but vary between Red , Russet or Yellow Potatoes.  Great stuff.  Goes great with a  Spinach Quiche made with lots of Italian shredded Cheese and onions, with diced little red and orange sweet peppers coated over with Parmesan and  slices of Crimini mushrooms over the top. !~

I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1 cup, also used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, added three cloves of garlic to potato, leek, butter mixture, sprinkled with smoky paprika before serving. Serve with toasted sourdough.

I would use half the amount of butter next time. Otherwise, I let it just stay warm on the stove for a couple hours and it got really thick and hearty. Will make again.

This was still delicious and very simple. I don’t have much experience with leeks and so was having trouble trimming off what seemed to me to be the bad parts. But in the end it all tasted good. Very rich. Unfortunately, are used the storebrand “golden” potatoes. Next time I’ll use a popular brand of Yukon Gold. They did not have the waxy consistency I was expecting for and more approached a russet or Idaho.

I used half the butter but added a little olive oil. My grocery store didn’t have Yukon gold potatoes so I used baby yellow potatoes in a bag. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream. I added cooked chicken sausage and a little fresh thyme salt and pepper. It was outstandingly good. I opened a bottle of Bandol rose it paired perfectly. Can’t wait to see if the farmers market has leeks again this weekend and I’ll make it again.

Good soup.  Two suggestions... 1) Triple the amount of lentils; 2) I used sweetened heavy cream by mistake...  It was good and My daughter loved it (ha!) but i suggest not making the same mistake ;-).

Made this recipe as it is written. My husband and I LOVED this dish. It was our first time trying leeks too, so it was pretty fun. Next time we will cut back the butter, it was very buttery. He noticed before I did, once he said to cut back the butter, I noticed how much I agreed. I normally read the reviews first and I wish I did this time. Oh well! This one is going on the favorites list!

Deliciously creamy and hearty soup. I went with the suggestions of using half of the butter in the recipe. I used heavy cream and it was perfect. I opted to not use corn starch. Potatoes release starch when cooking and that was enough to thicken the soup. I also added some cubed turkey ham. This recipe makes a large amount. It certainly tasted even yummier the next day. It's a must with crusty french bread!

Destined to be come a favourite at our house.
The only change I made was to add a TBSP of minced garlic when I sauteed the leeks.

Big hit with the whole family. I did take advice from here and reduced the butter, added cayenne and did half cream half milk. Will definitely be making it again.

Leeks were too easy to over cook. Do not use russets as a substitute. They are too starchy.

This was a hit! I made a few changes:
1) I used bacon - chopped and cooked up the package
2) Didn't use any butter or cornstarch
3) Fried onion and garlic in the bacon grease before adding the leek

Followed everything else bang on - got told it was the best potato leek soup they had ever had and they already had favourites!

Delicious!

I doubled this and it was proportionate and delicious. I used Eastern potatoes with skin on after scrubbing it.  The only addition I made was to reduce butter to half stick for the double batch and about 1/2 cup of bacon fat that I also used when sauuteeing the leeks.  I left some chunks but the immersion blender was absolutely necessary for the texture.I put out toppings of : bacon bits, green onions, cheddar cheese, and sour cream.

I didn't use the cornstarch as it was plenty thick as it was. This soup is outstanding, absolutely perfect in every way. If you are health concious you could probably use half and half instead of heavy cream. I am making it again but I have to double the recipe if I want any left overs as everyone absolutely loved it as much as I did and there wasn't a drop left the first time I made it!

This soup was so yummy and comforting! I made as directed. After simmering for 30 minutes, I realized it wasn't going to thicken like I thought, so added some mashed potato flakes to get it to the consistency I liked. Topped with crumbled bacon and served with grilled cheese sandwiches. Yum!

Yum! Great texture and flavor. Followed other reviewers: half the butter, half & half instead of cream, 1tsp onion powder added, 3 cloves garlic, and I omitted the corn starch. Didn't make sense to me since it's all getting puréed anyway, the potatoes thicken it up just right. I would recommend an extra cup of potatoes if you want it thicker. Great recipe!

I never write reviews, but this soup was ridiculous!  And so easy!  
I added onion powder, crushed garlic and cayenne pepper (just a touch) as well as turkey bacon cut into tiny pieces.  So incredibly delish.

I make this soup all the time and my family loves it! I have made variations over time depending on what I have on hand. Sometimes I have cut back on the butter and also used half and half. I have even used Better Than Bullion's veggie stock in place of chicken stock. I like to keep cut leeks in the freezer for this recipe so all I have to do it chop the potatoes. I love using my immersion blender to blend the whole thing before serving. Delicious and pure comfort food!

Made changes based off of what I had on hand, but didn't change the overall product until AFTER tasting.  Used better than bullion and water instead of chicken broth and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup (enough to saute the leeks).  The finished soup bland and thin.  I added more cornstarch to thicken and used an immersion blender to mash half of the soup.  I also added some garlic powder and a LOT more pepper.  This was all based off of personal preference and made a huge difference to us.  I'm glad that I finally get to check 'use leeks' off of my cooking bucket list. Thanks for a great starter recipe!

Waaaaay too much butter.   Good start otherwise.  Next time I will use more leeks and probably try some garlic and rosemary.   I have to say, I didn't have any cream, but I did have half a tub of cool whip in the freezer, so I used it.  Never  would have thought of it before, but it was okay in an emergency.

It's great just as recipe calls for.  I did more of a 1/2 and 1/2, cut the butter in half and added a bit of truffle oil to make up for the rest of the butter.  Yummmo!

This was certainly the least appealing variation of potato leek soup I've ever had. The butter, even at a half portion that the recipe calls for, is far too much. The potato portion is way under what it should be, especially as the principle ingredient of the soup. The broth was ok, but then the cream portion was over the top as well. Also, I find russets a better choice for soups. Overall, I made a double batch and couldn't eat any of it, but probably couldo have salvaged it with a second batch of potatoes.

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to cut the amount of butter in half. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream and added some left over ham at the end. The whole family loved it. I think this recipe might have been a little too rich for me as written (reason my rating is four stars instead of 5).

I used only 1/2 c butter, added two cloves chopped garlic to the cooking leeks, then added 1/4 flour instead of corn starch, stirred then added the chicken broth, adding the cream just before the potatoes were cooked.  Sometimes cream will curdle before the cooking process is complete.  I also used 5 medium russets and added about a cup of chopped ham.  Once the potatoes were cooked, I used a masher to break up some of the potatoes.  I like chunky potato soup, so I didn't puree. or use a submersion blender.  This was a great recipe.  I didn't feel the leeks were overpowering, but perfect.

Used 2% evaporated skim milk, a bit more cornstarch  to thicken, as others recommended, 3, leeks, used infuser to smooth, leaving a few cubes  for presentation, the best soup ever, tried adding minced clams, did not like the chewiness of them, will not do that again, used white pepper, wonderful recipe

This is a wonderful winter soup. I read reviews and took the recommendations, half the butter, also I used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup milk to keep it light. I added a couple shakes of garlic powder, thyme and cayenne pepper and used the immersion blender to mixer to blend a portion of the soup. This is a really nice and versatile recipe, thanks for sharing.

I made this last weekend and loved it.
I changed it up by using half the butter and changed the heavy cream to half and half. I also added bacon ( my husband loved that part, me not so much)
I would like to try it with baby clams next time.

I used half the heavy cream and it turned out fantastic! It's a new favorite - can't wait to make a giant batch and keep some handy for winter warmup lunches.

Delicious! This will be my new go to potato leek soup. As suggested by other reviewers, I cut back the butter to one stick, and used whole milk instead of cream.  I don't peel my potatoes, just scrub well and chop.  I used a potato masher once they were soft to mush them up a bit but kept the soup chunky because I prefer it that way.

Wonderful! Followed YASI's modifications but 1/2 C butter, Yukon Gold potatoes, 1.5 t cayenne, and being lazy ran it through my Vitamix for a smooth texture. Next time I'll add some small chunks of potato.  My family loved it. I bet you can make without the cream and freeze and still maintain the texture. Reheat and add cream at the end.

I combined this potato leek soup recipe with  another one I found that has...wait for it...this is the KEY ingredient...FRESHLY minced ginger, carrots and a few spices. IT WAS AWESOME!!! Sautéed all the veggies (leeks, carrots, celery, onion, GARLIC, and peeled potatoes) together in a combination of olive oil and butter. Put in the spices (turmeric, white pepper, salt, cayenne pepper) then added chicken broth (or stock), let it simmer for 30-40 min. I then used my immersion blender to smooth it all out, then added half & half. Brought it all together on low heat for about 20-30 min and  served. It was better the next day! The ginger really gives it the "pop" I crave at this time of the year!

I make this only once a year because it's so fattening but so delicious. the only modifications I made the reviewers have it's cut the butter and half and two tablespoons of olive oil. In lieu of heavy cream and half and half. It tastes a lot like clam chowder without the clams.

I cut the butter in half and used half and half instead of cream to lower the fat content. I left out the cornstarch because of a corn allergy. It was still plenty rich and delicious.

So good. Best soup I think I ever made and so easy. A lot of butter and cream of course so next time I'll try using a little less to see if I can get it as delicious as my first attempt. Highly recommend it.

This soup came out great! I added garlic cloves and also a few extra potatoes. I might not use as much butter next time, and if you're using heavy cream, you could probably omit the corn starch. I pureed a cup of soup and added to make it creamier. It was delicious and i will definitely be making it again! Thank you for sharing!

My VERY picky  10 yr old G-Son, gave me a "thumbs-up"  with this recipe.  He even raised his fist above his head! Now THAT'S a major "LIKE"! So simple to make.  The next time I made this, I included some fresh carrot coins, and a small can of drained "Le Sueur" young sweet peas.  G-Son STOOD up to give his "thumbs-up"! Hum! Maybe I'll try adding some ham!  Oh...I just used regular milk. Thanks Julie!

I made this on a  rainy day.  The changes I made were to use vegetable broth, add 2 tsp of cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. of onion powder and 3 cloves of garlic.  Then I used half & half cream.  Oh and I used Russet potatoes and one yam.  Smells yummy!  It's just simmering.

This is my go-to soup recipe when the weather turns cold. It's easy and outstanding. I substitute the heavy cream with half-and-half, and I use 1/2 cup of butter instead of a full cup. I cannot recommend this recipe enough!

I make this soup for a treat during the winter. Yes, it's a bit fattening, but boy is it worth it! Grandparents, parents, kids and grandkids all seem to devour it. I make it just the way the recipe calls for it (heavy on the pepper).

I was skeptical about all the butter, but it was fine. I didn't have any idea how to use the leeks I'd gotten at the farmer's market and this was great. I threw in a bunch of extra vegetables, too and it make a wonderful chowder. I followed the directions until the potatoes. Once I had the hot leek/broth mixture I threw it in the crock pot over raw cubed potatoes. High for 1 one hour,  then low until you want to eat it.  I used the immersion blender once it was all cooked to make it smoother. Will make again.!

Excellent. 
Changes:  Too rich, substitute some milk for cream; Add a smashed garlic clove when sautéing leeks then remove; add bay leaf

This was excellent. Instead of using heavy cream I substituted equal parts half and half and 2% milk. I also added I cup of chopped asparagus ( I had some extra). Before serving I puréed all of it. Deeeelicious!

I used half of the amount of butter, 1 cup cream &  1 cup 2% milk,  and I added crushed garlic. I diced the potatoes and used 3 leeks. I kept everything else the same. We really enjoyed this soup and considered adding clams or fish next time.  Will definitely make it again, especially with the less fat options posted in the reviews.  Thanks for sharing this recipe :).

an amazing soup as per the recipe.  Also very good with slight alterations (5% cream, use a food processor to blend the leeks and potatoes into a cream soup).

This is my favorite soup!! I look forward to this Fall and Winter, when I can make it again (it is wayyy too hot right now in the middle of Summer!).  Like others, I use much less butter, and I just use almond milk instead of cream. It is SO tasty!! I am vegetarian (though still use butter...), so I also use "No Chicken" broth, or veggie broth. I have used both Yukon and regular russetts, and both are good. I also sometimes add corn, because I love corn in soup. Very flexible recipe.

My girls love leek and potato soup and I had promised to make it for them but it was so long since I had made it, that I had to look up a recipe. and this is the one which popped up for me when I did a search. I made it more or less using the ingredients listed but omitted the cornstarch and put in half the recommended amount of butter.  I also put in some extra potatoes for thickening.  My girls absolutely loved it and thought it was better than the first one I made.  When I make it the next time, I will put in less butter and perhaps half cream/half milk just to reduce the fat content a bit.  All in in all, a lovely soup.

So rich, with the butter and cream, sinful but so tasty. Not a heart healthy meal so 4 stars, but if you want comfort food and aren't concerned about your coronaries enjoy.

I made this last night and was impressed with how easy and good it is.  I went by the recipe except I used half cream and half 2% milk.  For those noting a lack of thickness to the soup, I would suggest a bit more cornstarch, although I did not have that problem.  I wish I had gone easier on the salt--the directions mention salt and pepper THREE TIMES!  Next time I will salt only while the leeks are cooking and at the end, and I'll use white pepper.  I also used a potato masher at the end, for smoothness.  I'd like to try adding white wine for some of the broth and maybe experiment with different spices.

I have made this recipe twice now.  It is really delicious.  The next time I think I will cut down on the cream and use half and half.  This is definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe just as it is listed.  The soup was good but the potatoes were breaking down and getting mushy. Golds are good as a mash but they break down easy. If I made this again I would use the red potato. I'm going to look for a different soup recipe. This one had two much cream and butter also. I won't make this again.

Great recipe, but I made a few changes... I only used 1/2 the amount of butter called for and substituted vegetable broth instead of chicken. Also, instead of heavy cream, I used 1 cup of half and half and one cup of almond milk. Lastly, added about a teaspoon of garlic powder. The soup was still plenty creamy and rich. I served the it in bread bowls. Will definitely make again!

Fantastically simple and tasty. Only used about half of the butter and added some garlic, a little pesto, and some basil. For higher elavation it might take 35-40mins depending on how many potatoes you used.

This was an awesome recipe.  I made it for a church function and received sooooo many compliments on the broth. I made it pretty close to the original recipe but did, on the recommendation of other reviewers, add organic minced garlic when I was sauteing the leeks.  I also kept some of the potatoes back and blanched them and added them later so they weren't mushy...lol.  This recipe was perfection! Thanks

This soup turned out great and was very easy to make.  I made several modifications though.  I used some olive oil in place of butter to sauté the leeks and potatoes, fat free half & half in place of cream, used 2 tbls flour instead of corn starch, and added a can of corn.  The corn starch will separate if boiled too long and thins when reheating so I prefer to use flour for thickening in soups.  Topped with bacon and cheese.  Very good!

Following most of the recipe, except half the butter as mentioned by other reviewers.  I also chopped up 6 slices of bacon and added that after the cream.  Family loved it, there is enough for tomorrow, and you know a good soup becomes a great soup overnight.

I didn't make changes on the initial run, but will drop a lot of the butter and use half-n-half going forward.  I'll also use more of the leek to increase the onion flavor, play with adding some garlic,  and maybe puree part of the soup to thicken it even more.  I could also see using mashed potatoes to help thicken it.

I made this and the family loved it. Once everything was cooked, I took out some of the potato chunks and set them aside. I puréed the rest of the soup and returned the potato to the pot. Served with some shredded cheddar! Although my kids normally don't like "chunks" in their soup - I found they were actually fishing for the potatoes!
* To make my life easier- I now use 1/4c of butter, and follow directions. I put 4c of potato in the soup and keep about 2c aside - which I add after I have blended the soup. I cook another 30mins and it's all done!

This was exactly what I was looking for in a Potato Leek soup recipe.  It was easy and turned out delicious!
For lack of cornstarch, I substituted all purpose flour, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and it turned out yummy.

I LOVED this soup. It was so simple and so delicious, BUT, if I wouldn't have blended it, it would have been disgusting because nothing wanted to combine. When I blended it, it turned into a rich, creamy, smooth, downright heavenly creation. All of our guests went crazy for it and they couldn't believe how simple the recipe was.

I make this all the time! I do add 1 chopped yellow onion and three cloves of garlic to the leek mixture. I also throw that mixture into my food processor to make the soup really creamy. I also add crispy crumbled bacon and chopped chives to it at the end. Yummy!

Great soup!  I've been slowly working leeks into my kltchen, and thought this recipe looked like a good thing.  It is!

Instead of cooking the leaks in butter, i used bacon grease.  
After simmering the potatoes for a bit, i went at the soup with a masher, leaving it chunky, but letting the potatoes thicken the soup a bit further.

Finally, once it was "done" i added 1/2 cup of fresh cut parsley and 8 oz of sliced white mushrooms, and let it sit with the lid on, stove off, for another twenty minutes.

Soup came out great!

I would probably make this again-- it was a simple recipe and uses up a lot of potatoes.  I used almost a half a stick of buttter rather than the full amount and the end result is absolutely buttery. I also added an onion since my leeks were a little puny. I thought the broth came out a little thin at the end, but blending it up a bit helped make it nice and thick. I served it with some shredded cheddar. I meant to put a dollop of sour cream over the top since I have it and need to use it u, but I forgot. Try that, it would probably be good!

My family and I loved this soup...super easy and quick to throw together.  I have never cooked with leeks before...very good flavor! 
The only changes I made was to use half the butter it calls for and substituted f/f evaporated milk mixed with low fat half & half to make 2 cups, in place of the heavy cream because I don't enjoy the heaviness of too much butter and heavy cream,however, these changes only affected the thickness of the soup, not the flavor.  I make recipes as written before I add other ingredients to my liking...my son loved it!!  Thanks for sharing :))

This is my college aged, Vegetarian daughter's favorite soup! I reduced the butter by half and also substituted Half & Half for the cream . I have never needed to add the cornstarch. To make it a bit more healthy, I add an extra leek, And thinly sliced carrots and celery, after sautéing the leeks a bit first, then I sautéed them all a few minutes longer. I use vegetable broth when my daughter is home. Sometimes I add garlic, too. And freshly ground pepper. Some of the family like grated sharp cheddar cheese on top. Thank you so much!

Chopped 4 strips of bacon and added to leeks & butter when cooking. Used only 1/2 cup of butter. Added in granulated garlic to leeks & bacon. Used 2 cups of unsweetened coconut milk instead of the heavy cream. Delicious!

Good recipe! The first time I made it I followed the recipe.  The second time I made it I increased the potatoes to 5 cups and doubled the amount of leek.   I am a big fan of chunky soups and this did the trick.  I also added on chicken bullion cube to give the chicken stock a little more flavor (but not make the soup taste like chicken).

Followed others' suggstions -- cut down butter to 1/2 cup and a touch of olive oil, and half of the cream with half milk.  Also added cayenne pepper. Still a bit rich, but man, this is one delicious soup! Was thinking it would be tasty with bacon bits sprinkled on before serving. Thanks for posting the recipe Julie. Will definitely make again!

Yum. I used red potatoes as I couldn't find yukons, and I started out by cooking up some bacon before sautéing the leeks (cut back on the butter and kept a bit of the bacon grease in there). Used a hand blender to smooth it out a bit as I don't know chunky soup as much. Very, very good. I froze it and have been eating if all week. Great with sour cream and shredded cheese on top!

This soup is absolutely fabulous. However, I agree with a few of the other reviews, you really really really don't need a whole cup of butter. I used probably less than 1/2 cup (per Melissajean's review) and the leeks sauteed up nice and tender without any problem. Now, if you LIKE a lot of butter, go for it. But it really doesn't need it. 

This soup is wonderful and the simplicity of it makes it even more special. I highly recommend it.

I changed the recipe to 1/4 stick butter, 3 sliced leeks, used half and half, a 7oz container or Fage 2% greek yogurt and vegetable stock. Incredible! I just couldn't do that much butter, my arteries constricted just thinking about it. Wonderful soup!!!

Delicious! Made small tweaks: used 1/2c butter and 1c cream and 1 can evaporated milk. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly then puréed with an immersion blender. Amazing like that, but made leftovers with shredded cheddar and a drizzle of truffle oil! Yum!!!!!! Will make again for sure!

Splendid, nice flavor.  Only change was white pepper. Not because the French use it in clear or pale dishes.  I think it is richer in flavor and adds even more to the soup.

My wife says it is the best she's ever had! And my five and six-year-olds ate it really fast.  I modified as follows: used purple potatoes, used half a cup of coconut oil instead of butter and blended it.  Next time I will try the half and half instead of heavy cream.

Prepared as written this made a nice thick and very rich soup. Just the way I love it.   Very easy and wonderful recipe. 

Next time though, I may halve the butter and use half-and-half for the cream. Or not.  Hard to improve on this.

Used three leeks - almost all of them except the very ends (green end). Used yukon  golds, 1 cup evaporated milk, 1 cup heavy whipping cream. Added a lot of salt. It was flavorful and bland enough for my kids. Think next time I'll add fresh garlic. Pretty good overall!

Love this recipe. I make it at least 2 times a month in the winter. Most of the time I leave out the cream and cornstarch and just put 1/2 of the soup in blender to thicken.

It was very greasy with the 1 cup butter. The taste itself was okay... simple flavors, not much to it. If I made adjustments like a lot of other reviewers, it would pretty much be a new recipe.

We all make adjustments to fit our taste.   For us I puree the soup after its been allowed to cool.  My family likes it moderately pureed.  On so doing you can cut way back on the cream making it tasty and healthy.  I just increase the broth to adjust liquid.   Use full milk and only half as is  indicated here.

This soup is very rich-- but VERY tasty! I substitute half and half for cream, and reduce the butter. To step it up, I add diced ham and scallions just before serving. Delicious!

Delicious, quick recipe.  Reduced butter to 1/2 cup and used milk rather than cream only because of the fat content...can only imagine what this soup would have been with full butter and cream  .. Yumm!

I make this whenever I need comfort food and it always does the trick. I do make a few changes though. I only use one (1) stick of butter and use whole milk instead of heavy creamy. Without these changes be prepared to nap after every bowl. Also, I like to take 4 cups out, blend it and return it to the pot for a more desired potato soup texture. Enjoy!

This is a great recipe to follow, simple and few ingredients. Helpful to read comments also to see how other people tweak it to their tastes. I only use half the butter, and also half milk and half cream instead of all cream. I also increase the wet ingredients, and the potatoes.  I use about a cup more broth and a cup extra milk with the recipes amount of cream split with milk/cream. I just sort of eyeball the potatoes. I've used regular russet potatoes if I don't have the gold on hand and it's fine.
I use white pepper and a dash of nutmeg to season the leeks while they are cooking in butter. Yum! My kids love it!

Good flavor but too much butter. I cut the butter in half and it was still too greasy for my taste.  Next time I will use 1/4 cup of butter.

Delicious!  Used half of the suggested amount of butter and half & half in place of the cream.  Also used garden vegetable broth in place of chicken because we are vegetarians.  Perfect!  Garnished with scallions and served with sourdough bread.

this was amazing.  I cut back on the butter and used skimmed milk instead but also pureed a portion of the soup so that it was nice and thick but still had bits of potato and leeks.  Garnished with bacon wedges & sour dough buns.  complete meal !!

Very, very good.  Used much less butter (maybe 1.5 T), and used flour instead of cornstarch (just because I don't have any at the moment).  Stirred it into the leeks before adding the broth. Used milk, but less.  So delicious and creamy, even without being pureed. Will make again soon!

I, too, used 1/2 the butter, 5 cups of spuds, & substituted Fat-Free Half & Half for the cream. The onion powder and white pepper were good ideas, as well. I found the flavor to be almost too delicate. I've heard the leek greens would be too strong to add to the soup. Has anyone tried to "steep" the greens in the broth to make it more flavorful? I'm open to suggestions.

Loved this soup!  Used all the butter suggested as well as celery and carrot.  One bay leaf.  Instead of cream, I used Carnation Evaporated milk and it gave it a wonderful flavour.  Did not thicken this soup with the cornstarch.  It was wonderful just as it was.  Thank you

definitely use one stick of butter and use half and half instead of heavy cream. the first thing I did was cook two pieces of bacon in the pot. I can pull the bacon chopped it up to put in the soup later. the bacon grease at a lot of flavor to the soup. I also sprinkled a little bit of granulated garlic before I added the liquid. just a great soup on a cool winter day.

I made it tonight. But I used Idaho potatoes and half the butter. I also added a bit of garlic powder and cubed cut spiral honey ham that I had left over from a party. My favorite soup ever.

I do not normally change out the ingredients but I used this recipe as a base to make the soup.  SO I can't rate the recipe above but I can say it was a helpful start and I appreciated how good it would be!

Really enjoyed this soup! We used half and half instead of heavy cream and did not put it in the blender. The first time we used leeks and the second time we just used onions - the leeks were definitely better.

Added 2 cloves of garlic, not sure if that really did anything. At any rate, this was delicious and easy. Also, last minute I added some ham, and I think that really helped round out the flavour. Oh also only added 1/2 cup butter, and used 1 cup whipping cream and 1 cup half and half.

This is the first time I've had potato leek soup and we all loved it! I followed the advice of earlier reviews as to using only a half cup of butter and I used half and half instead of heavy cream, added the minced garlic and some onion powder. It was perfect. Oh yes, I also used my mixer to break down the potato chunks a little more. The kids loved it as much as the adults.

I thought this soup was very delicious.  I always make the recipes exactly as the recipe states the first time, then I look at reviews and think about what changes I could make the next time.  I would definitely half the butter, you definitely don't need that much and I think I will go ahead and try the half and half.  Still, very good!

Fantastic!  A half a stick of butter was plenty, I thought.  We absolutely loved this simple soup.  It had so much flavor and we both had seconds.

My daughter and I made this wonderful soup.  It was the first time we cooked with leeks, and we really enjoyed the experience.  We served the soup with crumbled bacon, shredded cheese and parmesan croutons.  My family LOVED it and asked that I KEEP the recipe.  NO leftovers to taste test the next day. YUMMY, EASY, and GREAT for main course or served as a side.

I lightened this up after reading the other review... half of the butter and half'n half instead of heavy cream.  Smooth it out with a hand blender and you have a super elegant soup course.  The leek is so subtle but absolutely delicious.  I would make this ALL the time if I had more leeks.  Super Soup!

I love this recipe.  Best for us with maybe 1/3 the butter, and as Julie suggested using the chicken broth with the butter to saute the leeks.  I also add a good sized shallot, since this is a French one for me.  And I am a self professed garlic addict so at least one clove has to go in.  Also subbed the cream for 1 cup half and half and 1 cup whole milk.  Still want to try it with vegetable broth.  Also I add the milk/cream in near the very end.  And I puree the leeks and potatoes.  It goes fast here.

We added some crumbled bacon, a bit of garlic powder and a splash of sherry.  It was great!! You could substitute green onions or even regular onions if you don't have leeks.  We also used half and half as we didn't have quite enough heavy cream.

This is an EXCELLENT flavourful soup.  I also added carrots & celery chunks. When I make it again, I will definitely blend the leeks into a puree and add that to the soup.  By only slicing the leeks it is like trying to eat spaghetti in soup with a spoon.  Impossible and messy.

OMG this is a fabulous soup, especially with our changes!!! 1/2 the butter, "Better than Bouillon" veggie base. Yogurt instead of cream. Heaven. The yogurt really gives it a tang that accents the soup. So easy and SO Good!!!!!!

I thought it was good reminded me of soup at Olive Garden. I added half butter stick,  kale, turkey, sausage, and cayenne pepper. And half & half cream is all you need, delish!

Delicious!  We also cut the amount of butter in half, and it was still great.  I liked that it was a creamy gluten free soup without any tweaking by me.  It made a large batch, so we have another dinner in the freezer now.

This is a great recipe. I used slightly less leeks and vegetable broth instead of chicken and was pleasantly surprised at how deliciously the soup turned out. I grew up eating potato leek soup in the wintry months of MN and am so pleased to have found a comparable recipe suitable for my vegetarian lifestyle.

I made this with a homemade Chicken Broth, regular potatoes, and only 3/4 cup butter. We added fresh garlic and it came out AMAZING. It was our first time even cooking/eating the soup and now will become a staple in our household. I did not puree it yet but plan on it.

This soup is awesome just the way it is! Everyone who tryed it, wanted the recipe. Really great flavor. You could also use this soup as a base for several other types of soups such as: clam chowder or chili chicken chowder.... So Good!

I have made this soup twice now; the first time I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, and it was fabulous. Even my young children loved it. The second time, I tweaked it a little by cooking a bit of bacon with the leeks and also adding three cloves of garlic and a dash of celery salt. Still just as delicious, and this is going on our dinner rotation!

This soup is delicious!  Made a few modifications to make it a bit healthier.  Cut the butter down to 3/4c, used fat free chicken broth and fat free half and half instead of cream.  I also put it in the blender before serving, it was thick and creamy, I also added a little crisp crumbled bacon on top before serving.  My kids love it!

This made a fantastic soup! I used half the amount of butter as Julie suggested in the comments, a mixure of potato varieties (red, yukon gold, russet), didn't peel them, a combination of half-and-half, whipping cream and 2% milk, and added diced ham in the last 5 minutes of cooking as another reviewer suggested. I think this soup would be tasty without the ham but is sure didn't hurt. ;) Thank you for the recipe!

Yummoh!  I took other's advice and added some celery, didn't add salt, cut butter to 1/2 Cup, and used fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream.  My husband suggested adding some ground spicy Italian sausage.. which we did and the soup tasted just like the Zuppa Toscana at the Olive Garden! I will make this soup again!!

Loved it!  As the author states, it does taste great the next day (and beyond), so it made great leftovers.  I used milk instead of cream to cut some of the calories, and it still tasted great.

I love the flavors of leeks with potatoes.  I've made this recipe a few times and really like it more as sloppy potatoes than soup.  I use half the butter, make sure the leeks are really tender before adding other ingredients, double the potatoes, and a few other adjustments.  For convenience, I used a can of Cream of Celery soup and some water instead of the broth and cream.  I added some red pepper for a little heat because that appeals to my family.  Most important, I used a dutch oven and put the heat on low once I added the potatoes (Yukon or Red, I left the skins on) and soup so that it wouldn't burn.

I used red bliss potatoes, half heavy cream and half half and half, and used an immersion blender before adding the potatoes and this was delicious!  It was much thicker in the following days so it might be better to make it ahead of time but it was still delicious! Be sure to clean the leeks very thoroughly!

I made this soup tonight (with my own little tweeks) and it was AMAZING. My almost 2 year old and VERY picky husband LOVED it. OK... so as for my tweeks, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 rendered lard instead of 1 cup butter. I didnt add cornstarch. I subbed the heavy cream for 1 cup coconut milk (the beverage kind cause its all we had) and like 1/2 cup sour cream. I also added 2 slices of bacon (cut up into small pieces) when sauteing the leeks in the butter and lard. AMAZINGNESS... the perfect rainy day/feeling yucky soup. I am eating a second bowl as a snack right now!

So rich! I almost thought it was going to be too rich, but the taste never overwhelmed, only impressed. Definately a make today eat tomorrow kind of recipe. I want to add bacon next time for a bit more texture. Love the leeks.

I changed a couple things in this recipe. I replaced the chicken broth with vegetable broth because my roommate is vegetarian and couldn't eat it with the chicken broth in it. I also used garlic pepper instead of regular pepper for a bit more flavor with a bit of a kick. I am thinking about using this for the base of a creamy vegetable soup. I highly recommend this recipe it is very simple and easy to do.

DELICIOUS!  I made this for St. Patrick's Day lunch yesterday and it was a huge hit!  So good that the pot was clean and I'm making more today because we just couldn't get enough of it.  As my husband said, "Grandma McManus would have been proud!"  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

Due to medical issues, I can only have soup for the next month. Thanks to recipes like this, that's not a bad thing!

I left the butter and cream as is, but added a dash of basil and parsley, a pinch of white pepper and five strips of crumbled bacon into the soup. Mouth-watering delicious and SO easy. I will make this again and again!

Made this delicious and quick soup recipe for a weekend lunch and brought left overs to work. At least 3 people asked for a taste of the soup that was producing such a wonderful savory aroma in the kitchen! I referred several people to this site that day and this recipe is now a family favorite!

Had some locally grown leeks given to me and tried them using this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly except that i up'd the recipe to 12 servings and am I glad I did!  It made enough for leftovers and some to share with extended family.  Everyone raved about it! Easy and restaurant quality!

This was so yummy!  I used half & half instead of the heavy cream and it was still really rich.  Even my picky kids loved it and that says a lot!  I will be making this often!  Oh, and one more thing, I pureed about 2/3 of the leeks after cooking them.

We really liked this soup and its super easy (and quick) to make!! It does need quite a bit of salt in my opinion, but that's to be expected I think, might have been because I used low sodium broth. A great, go-to soup for a chilly fall/winter day!

I thought the soup was good, but not anything different from any other potato soup.  The leek flavor was weak, so I am thinking I will add more if I make it again.

This was a good base, but I did add a few spices to it as I found it a bit bland. I took another reviewers advice and used half and half. I will make this again.

This soup was delicious!  I have never had it before but my husband loves it and the leeks were on sale so I tried it!  I only used 1/2 cup of the butter only because it was all I had left and used one cup of half and half and one cup of low fat milk and it turned out great although maybe just a little thin.  Next time, I think I will add a few more potatoes and puree some to thicken it up just a touch.

Awesome recipe and very easy to prepare.  Rather than leaving chunks of potatoes I pureed everything and also added 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. Mmm! Perfect comfort food for a cold winter day.

This was my first time making (and eating) potato leek soup. I was reluctant to try it at first because I've never had leeks and I wasn't sure if I'd like a soup made with leeks. I was very pleasantly surprised! Thanks!

I changed this recipe a bit. I used 4 tbsp unsalted butter, used this to saute half of a yellow bell pepper, one yellow onion, a couple stalks of chopped green onion, 2 stalks celery and 2 tbsp minced garlic. I also diced 3 medium potatoes and dumped them right into the vegetables. Added the cornstarch directly to the saute mixture and then added 3 cups of chicken stock to this. Once boiling, I added 4 drops of hot sauce, freshly cracked black pepper and a tsp of salt. Added one cup half and half and allowed to simmer and thicken. Then I added 1/2 tsp. dried basil and 1/2 tsp. dried parsley, a couple dashes of paprika. I let it cook some more and when ready, topped each individual bowl with shredded pepper jack cheese. YUM!

I made this last night for a soup cookoff to raise money for United Way. My husband and 14 year old son said it was wonderful. I thought it was very delicious. I doubled the recipe but only used the butter for one batch. I would cut the butter to 1/2 cup for one batch. It is delicious. Served with sour cream, fresh chives and homemade rolls. Delicious.

We love this soup on a cold fall/winter day.  I also substitute the heavy cream with half and half and cut back on the butter by 1/2.  I use green onions as well as leeks as my family loves the onion flavor.  I serve it with a sliced french baguette and it's wonderful

The flavor was pretty good, but the soup was a little greasy with all the butter.  Next time, I will cut the butter in half at least.

Simple to prepare and absolutely delicious. I used only a half cup of butter and I threw in a little bit of sour cream that I had. I used half and half instead of heavy cream. I will certainly make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Yowzer this was good! I added 2 cans of corn to get more veggies. The flavor and richness of this soup is excellent! Great job.

I would like to thank you for posting this recipe. I used it for my grade 11 Commercial Cooking practical final. It was a big hit among the teachers. It was quite simple too. I will most definitely be getting a 90+ on the dish, thanks!

I used 3 large leeks from the local Farmer's Market, a 3lb bag of red potatoes, 1 cup half and half and 1 cup heavy cream, organic chicken broth and a little less than 1 cup butter along with the cornstarch and minimal salt and pepper and this soup is fabulous! I had never cooked with leeks before so I was nervous but it came out so yummy!

My changes to the recipe: Reduce butter to 1/2 cup (1 stick); reduce heavy cream to 1-1/2 cups of half and half; increase leeks to three; add 1/2 pound of hot Italian sausage (cooked and crumbled). Served with a fresh loaf of french bread. It was a very rich and carb-heavy meal, but good for an early autumn evening.

Very good recipe.  I used half a stick of butter like someone else suggested and it turned out well.  Also substituted cream with half-and-half.  I left out the starch and, instead, took out about half the potatoes and leeks when it was done, mashed it, and returned it to the pot before adding the half-and-half. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Perfect!  And if you use vegetable stock instead of chicken it is just as good!  (also I used flour as I don't really like corn starch)

The only reason I didn't give 5 is because I did have to make some slight changes, like only using 1 stick of butter and using half&half instead of heavy cream.  Even so, I can't imagine it being more creamy or buttery.  I made this for a party and everyone loved it.  I may even use a little less than 1 stick of butter next time.  I also added about 1/2 cup of white cooking wine.  It was delightfully simple to make also.

This soup was delicious! I made a few substitutions though. Like many others, I used fat free half and half instead of cream, halved the butter, and used the smaller white potatoes instead of Yukon Gold. I had no cornstarch and sis is allergic to corn anyway, so I whisked in equal parts flour instead. at first taste, it was bland, but I added garlic salt, rosemary, and ground white pepper to the mix and it was phenomenal. We're vegetarians so I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and after the soup simmered for 30 mins I ran half of it through the blender and then recombined it to make the soup more smooth. I will definitely make this again, but next time I will use one more leek and add another cup of broth because it was really thick. I love leeks and this soup was wonderful!

Restaurant quality soup. I'll cut down on the butter for sure next time. I added a shredded carrot in with the potatoes. I didnt use cornstarch as it was already thick. Used the immersion blender to make it smoother, but still left some texture to it. Dinner guests would be impressed.

Good recipe, very easy and straight forward.  I did add a little garlic to the leeks when they were cooking, I felt the soup was very think, so added a little milk to thin it down.  Will certainly be making again.

Great recipe, thanks for sharing. We had this tonight with meatloaf. I kind of made it as is, but added a few things...bacon of course. I cooked that first then cooked the leeks in a little bit of the bacon fat with a few pats of butter added. I boiled the potatoes and mashed them with the leeks, bacon, chicken broth, little white wine, and cream..and garlic powder.  Used my immersion blender to smooth it out. Great and easy recipe. Hardest part was cleaning the leeks...I sliced them and then cleaned them in a strainer and dried with paper towels.

I changed a few things, just as everyone else did. I reduce my butter to 3/4 cup, and next time will probably go 1/2. I also chopped 2 decent sized cloves of garlic and a mediu sized onion and put them in with the leeks and butter. I added no salt or pepper through the process and used veg broth instead of chicken. Instead of cornstarch I used 2 tbsp of flour, and I used 5 cups of potatoes, as well as added 2 large chopped carrots. I let it simmer for quite some time, really letting the flavours come together and then I decided to puree it. Because of the extra potatoes and carrots it was already so thick and creamy that I actually didn't add any cream at all and it was DELICIOUS! Will try garnishing with a few different things - Thanks!

Easy and delicious!  I have made this several times. It works well with evaporated milk if you are out of cream.  I also put much less than 1 cup of butter to reduce the fat.

FABULOUS! used 3 leeks instead of two( sold in a bunch and didnt know what to do with the left over leek) used6 red potatoes with skins on as another person suggested. i put in maybe 1/2 tsp salt and fresh ground black pepper. I also used 3/4 c butter but it was way too much for my taste will make with 1/4 c next time if not less and the 1/2 and1/2 cream like others said but next time i am going to try it with skim milk to make it less rich. Oh and also substituted veggie broth for chicken. will make again and again!

Very good. I might have cut the potatoes a little big so when I was done cooking the soup mashed up the potatoes in the soup with a potato masher and thought it tasted even better that way.

This recipe was wonderful.  The only thing I added was mixing the soup up after it was done cooking.  I made it nice and creamy.  I topped it with a bit of grated cheddar cheese.  MMM Good!  Thank you for this recipe!

This soup was awesome!!  I have a hard time with soups sometimes because I feel like they never have enough flavor but one was really good.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 & 1/2 instead.

I agree this was great.  I disagree withe the 8 servings.  This was just enough for my husband and I to have one large bowl each (about 4 cups). I made just a couple changes and additions.  I used olive oil to saute my leeks then added about 2 tbsp. margarine (non hydroginated) for some flavor.  I also used just under a cup of heavy cream and the rest milk. Add the best addition was about 1/2 cup white wine. This give it one more demension and it was lovely. I do mash my soup. I'm not a fan of this smooth. Personally, I like a little texture. I also use this for my clam chowder with the wine it's superb.

This was so delicious. The only changes I made were to add 5 cloves of minced garlic to sautee with the leeks, cut the butter in half and add about 1.5 more cups of broth to the soup. I will make this again and again, and will use it as a base for all of my cream soups/chowder etc. Next time, I will try using just milk to see if I can cut some of the fat. If I do that, I am sure I'll need to add more cornstarch to thicken up.

Best Potato and leek soup I've found. I cut down the butter to 3/4, changed the heavy cream to homogonized milk and added garlic and onion powder. Great when it's cold outside!

Wonderful, simple recipe! I used only 3 T of butter, 1% milk instead of cream, and multi-colored fingerling potatoes for color and variety. Will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks!

Yummy.  I thought I had heavy cream, but I was out.  Substitute whole milk, and crossed my fingers.  Mom loved it.  Boys loved it.  Husband dug it, and I think the only think that would have made it better was the heavy cream.  I cut way back on the butter as suggested and only using half.  It's a keeper.  Thanks

Great recipe!  I made some adjustments such as reducing butter to 1/2 C.  Instead of heavy cream I used 1 C. half/half and 1 C. milk, which made it not as creamy but maybe a little bit better for you. I also added 3 cloves minced garlic right after sauteing the leeks. Tasted fantastic!

I think this is a great recipe!  The leeks were very flavorful.  The bacon is best when the soup is first made.  I have yet to find a soup recipe where the bacon doesn't get soggy after a while.

Delicious! I added a clove of garlic, pressed, at the same time I added the potatoes, just because I'm a garlic lover. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written, and it was both easy and very tasty!

We look forward to fall to make this soup, when we get leeks as part of our share from a community-supported agriculture program with a local farm.  YUM!!  I often use a little less butter than the recipe calls for, and use an immersion blender at the end to blend in the potato chunks, and serve with sour dough bread for dipping.

Thanks to Julie for this great recipe.  I followed some others and used half & half instead of cream.  I also added garlic and Tabasco sauce.  Then I hit it lightly with the hand blender just before serving.

Very tasty! I too reduced the amount of butter to 1/2 c like other users and added a bit of garlic while cooking the leeks in butter. Didn't have any cream, so opted for milk and added a bit more cornstarch to make it a bit more thick. Pureed it with a stick blender before serving. My guests loved it! thank you :)

This was really great and easy to make.  I didn't have the Yukon potatoes, but following Julie's advice, I halved the butter and used half-and-half.  It was still wonderful, but I think next time I may use the heavy cream-I would've liked it just a little heavier.  I may also try making it with a roux vs. the cornstarch.  This is the sort of recipe that is great as is, but makes you want to experiment a little :)

Very much like Julia Child's "Potage Parmentier". Very hearty and  unbelievably easy. Thanks for sharing. UPDATE: Like Julie added, use 1/2 the butter called for and half/half instead of cream. As she also suggested, I'm adding baby clams next time. 2nd UPDATE: I made this again with half the butter and 2% milk. It's still very tasty.

Like many of the reviewers, I only used half the butter, and I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream. And it was still really rich!  I used russet potatoes, because it was what I had on hand. I think it really would've made a big difference to use yukon golds. Russets are flaky, while golds are creamy, which would go much better with the theme of the soup.

This was so delicious and hearty! I also decreased the amount of butter. Added a tablespoon of olive oil and added a dash of the following spices: parsley, basil and rosemary. Following another reviewer's advice, I also added two cloves of garlic (minced). Very tasty! Mixes well with ciabatta bread.

This is such a nice soup. Very simple and tasty. Didn't have cornstarch, and i halved the butter and cream, was still delicious. my boyfriend really liked the potato chunks (as opposed to pureed soups). perfect with fresh bread.

I made it with 3 leeks and 1/2 and 1/2 but didn't cut down on the butter.  What was I thinking?  Very, very rich.  I also added rosemary, hot sauce and other spices.  It was ok - but I don't think I'd make it again.

This soup is AMAZING! I've tried many Leek Potato Soup recipes and this one is definitely the best. I used half&half instead of heavy cream and put a couple cups into my magic bullet (blender/food processer) then added it back to the pot for a thicker texture.

I really enjoyed this soup! I think it is traditionally blended, but I liked it better with some bite. My fav part is the simplicity(even though I made a few changes). I added a clove of garlic and used half the butter and a smidge of bacon grease to saute the leeks. Also, since my husband thinks anything without meat in it is not worth eating (we're working on it :) ) I finely chopped and browned some canadian bacon to top his soup (tip: add a v small drizzle of EVOO and the CAbacon crisps right up)  Very satisfying and delicious!

This... was... sensational!! I cup back the butter to only 1/4 cup and used 1 cup half & half and 1 cup 2% milk. It was super rich and thick. Oh, and I also ran it through my food processor at the end for a nice finish. A real keeper! Thanks!!

My 15 year old picky daughter always begs me to make this.  Not a recipe for those on a diet, but wonderful on a chilly day.  I make this for church gatherings and have passed the recipe on to others.

I loved this soup.  I did change it up a little.  I omitted the cornstarch and cream.  I used only 1/2 the butter and when I added the broth, I grated in 1 clove of garlic.  After simmering, I stuck my stick blender in the pot and made it creamy, without the cream.   Delish!!

Great hearty soup.  Added a leek and about 4 bulbs of green garlic to the sauté.  All that butter is great for sautéing, but it's pretty excessive in the finished product.  I skimmed quite a bit off the top using paper towels.

An excellent, healthy soup.  I cut the butter in half and added parsley, cumin and Maggi seasoning.  Pureed with hand blender but left some bigger pieces.  Topped it all off with grated cheese and bacon.

I halved the butter as directed in the amended instructions, but still ended up with a buttery film on top. It tasted good, but I don't think that much butter was necessary.  So next time I will half it again.  I think I used half and half (I made this a couple of weeks ago and have forgotten!) and it was yummy and creamy, but you could probably cut fat by using 1/2 half and half and half milk.  I also added LOTS more leeks, and I didn't think it was too leeky.  I served it with cheese on top.  Creamy and yum!

Outstanding and simple.  I have never liked onions, but after trying this potatoe Leek soup I found that I absolutely love leeks.  They are velvety smooth and have a very subtle comforting flavor.  I cut back on the butter, used 1/2 and 1/2 and I added some corned beef, but this is perfect as is.

This soup is easy and delicious! I made a few changes by using only 1/2 stick of butter and light cream instead of heavy, also an extra leek. After cooking, I blended the soup so there wouldn't be such large chunks, but left it a little chunky. It turned out great!   I like to add a few dashes of Tabasco and it may be good with some real bacon bits. I might follow another review and make some into clam chowder. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This was a very tasty soup.  i have made this soup many times and it never ceases to amaze me.  I've had it as is and with additions like bacon, white wine and ham.  It's the only recipe I can't screw up.

Good soup...great base to add other things
I added some ham and green onions.  Instead of cornstarch I added powdered potatoes to thicken before I added the cream (half and half)  
I only used margarine instead of butter and only a fraction of the amount about 3 tbs
Next time i think cauliflower would make it even better!

I was hoping for leftovers for the next day, but it was all eaten on the day I made it. I used 1 stick of butter and non-fat half & half. Next time I will make a double batch so I can try it the next day.

This soup was a hit!  I will admit though that the butter should be cut in half, as I could taste the butter in the soup..and I used half and half this time...probably will reduce that to evaporated milk next time...I did add some garlic and half of an onion as well...overall the soup was rich, creamy, and very comforting!

This is a great soup.  I made the following changes:
- reduced butter to just 1/2 cup
- added Swiss chard when sauteeing leeks (because I had to use it up)
- used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream
- didn't salt the soup at all since butter and broth was salted 
I'll make again for sure!

Fantastic Recipe! The only change I made was I used whole milk instead of the cream and becel margerine instead of the butter. I wanted it a bit healthier and in the end I think the cream would have made it too rich.

Thanks for adding this recipe, I'll be enjoying this for years to come!

Very tasty!  I used minimal butter & evaporated skim milk instead of cream and it tasted wonderful.  My only word of caution - don't over blend it (I have an emulsifier), it can get a gummy texture.

This was amazing. I used regular potatoes. Once the leeks were sauteed, I threw everything in a crock pot on low for about three or four hours. The last hour I put in half and half. I used a potato masher to mash my potatoes, because I like my leeks intact and I had a bad experience blending potato leek soup in the past. This could easily be thrown in the crock pot for the entire day and enjoyed when you get home from work, just make sure you pour the cream in when you get home.

Delicious with (much) less cream and butter... this looked like a recipe for a heart attack, so I lowered the butter to 6 tablespoons and the cream to 1 cup of light cream, and cooked it. FYI, I used 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp pepper. Delicious!!

So comforting on a cold day.  This is delicious and I use evaporated milk for the heavy cream to reduce the fat.  I have also made this once using plain milk for a thinner consistency which was still pretty good. This was a great way to use up the leaks I had frozen from the vegetable garden last summer. Thanks.

I used half the butter and half-and-half instead of heavy cream. Then added  2 extra leeks and 4 pressed cloves of garlic. Definitely needs a fair helping of salt and pepper to taste. But fantastic result, love this soup. Excellent with a crusty, chewy baguette.

This soup is delicious!  We made a few changes:

We used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Instead of cornstarch, used the same amount of all-purpose flour.  Definitely needed some salt for taste at the end, but it was fantastic!

This was delicious and so easy to make.  I didn't have any heavy cream and just used low-fat half-n-half, which tasted  fine.  I think next time I will use other reviewers' recommendations of cutting the butter back by 1/2.  It did seem to have more than it really needed.

Not good.  I halved the butter and did 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  I also added a few more veggies and rosemary.  Nothing helped.  All it tasted like was grease and chicken... will not make this again.

My family loved this recipe. I served it with crumbled bacon, cheddar cheese, and chives. I will definitely make this again. It was the perfect meal for a cold and snowy night. Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice soup.  I used whole milk instead of the cream and mashed some of the soften potatoes.  I used white pepper, touch of cumin and some rosemary just because I like those flavors. It's a very good soup.  Oh, and I put some garlic in with the leeks and didn't really need all that butter.  A couple tbsps was just fine.

This recipe was not bad.  Made some changes too.  Added portobello mushrooms, 2 stalks of celery, parsley, onion powder, 3 slices of bacon, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream, etc.  Blended most of the soup at the end to give it a creamy texture but left some chunks to give it some heartiness.  I guess my disappointment was really due to I specifically wanting a leek soup recipe, not a combo.  I probably will not make again due to the fact that my husband complained it was not my original leek soup, UGH, for the love! ;)

ok I didn't used yukon potatoes. I also diced onion and garlic and threw it in with the leek...I found this recipe to be too creamy for my taste.  My mum LOVED it tho.  I will make it again but maybe put less cream or swap it for something else.

This recipe was superb! Very delicious, I made a few alterations, the soup was a bit chunky after adding the potatos, before i added the cream i blended the soup for a rich smooth texture (in batches). I also added ham and some garlic powder. Simply marvelous! will warm u up on any chillly day!

We eat a lot of soup and I thought this was delicious. We added mushroom and I used regular Russett potatoes I had on hand. Also used more leeks than called for.

I made this soup over weekend.  I cut the butter in half and used half and half as one of the other reviewers suggested, I also added carrots and cubed ham.  The soup turned out wonderful.  The whole family enjoyed the soup, especially my brother in law who says he normally hates potato soup!  He ate it right up and said it was the best soup he had ever tasted and asked if he could take some home with him!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great base recipe. I used homemade chicken stock (which already had sliced carrots, celery, & parsley), cut the butter in half, and used milk & half-n-half in place of the cream to cut fat. I added some garlic and tossed in some sliced cooked sausage, and voila! Perfection.

Everyone loved this recipe. Even the anti-onion eaters. Used 2% milk. Added minced garlic, onion powder, and sour cream with the milk. Blended it too. Try it you'll like it.

This was pretty good, however, you can easily cut out a ton of the fat and still have a very delicious soup! I used only 1/2 cup butter and half and half instead of heavy cream and it still came out very rich. Next time, I am using whole milk and only 1/3 cup butter. I also added one cup of sweet corn and a little thyme. The additions really helped round it out a bit more.

This was VERY DELICIOUS!!  Creamy and quite tasty.  The only variation i added, was melting 2 slices of cheese on the soup when it was finished cooking, and then stirring it in. I had always done that on my own potato soup. But, I loved it!! I highly recommend this recipe.

This was the greatest soup I have ever made.  The ingredients are so simple, but it's the proportions that are just right.  I ended up using a blender to get a smooth consistency for my soup and received rave reviews.  Thank you!!!

I used 1-1/2 cups butter and added one clove of garlic to leeks. Next time I will use two cloves. I used homemade chicken stock which I think helped give it a richer flavoer. I pureed the soup and it was a great consistency. Garnished with bacon bits. A big hit for my tiny dinner party.

FANTASTIC!  This soup earned rave reviews at my holiday table a few weeks ago.  I didn't have cornstarch, so I blended about 2/3 of it and added it back to the pot.  It  was even better the next day.  Thanks for the stellar recipe!

Do you think they really mean 1/4 cup of butter?  I tried cutting the butter to 1/2 cup, and I still have quite a skin of it on the top!  Oh, cabbage makes a great addition to this as well!  Yummy!

I actually made this soup last fall and am now just getting 'round to reviewing it as I'm looking over my cold-weather recipes.  I'm usually not particularly good at soup-making, but this wonderful soup has raised my reputation to new heights!  It is lovely!  I pureed the soup in a blender and reheated for a smoother texture, but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe.  Thanks to the submitter.  I shall be making this again and again and basking in the compliments!

Finally, a recipe everyone liked!  Including some trick-or-treaters that stopped by.  I made a few changes and will make a few more. I used half and half and evaporated milk but it was still too rich for me.  I added garlic but otherwise, no changes!  KUDOS!! Thanks so much for sharing Julie!
