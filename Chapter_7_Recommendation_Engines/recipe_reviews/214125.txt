Very good! Very gruesomely adorable idea! Cooking it up now for tomorrow night before trick or treat. I only give this a 4 star because flavor wise it need a little kick. I put 5 cheese tortellini for the "ears" instead of the orechiette pasta. I also changed the peas to black eye peas. Added a few more body parts too: Asparagus (arms), Broccoli (brains/heads with hair). The extra flavor I added was season salt, sea salt, pepper, and garlic powder all to taste. Over all, I LOVED this recipe!

Kids LOVED it.  Used a can of pasta sauce instead of tomato soup and added little sausages for "fingers."  Kids ate it all...so I cannot say how well it would go over with adults.  :-)
