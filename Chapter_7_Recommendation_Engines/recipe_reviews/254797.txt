They were good, but they were little denser than I thought. That is probably because I'm not used to cooking with oatmeal and flax seed powder.

A friend gave me some figs, so I thought this recipe would be a great way to make them.  I didn't have the flax, so I added extra oatmeal.  The first batch was bland and dense, so I added baking soda and walnuts to the second half.  This improved the recipe, so I would recommend changing the recipe to 2 teaspoons baking soda and a teaspoon of salt, as well as a cup of chopped walnuts.

PS - unsweetened applesauce is just fine in this recipe.

Good way to use my figs.  Next time Iâ€™ll add some nuts.
