this is great! This is good for summer parties and to impress your friends and family. I also put a c. of cherry vodka and serve half at a time. Try freezing the cherrys in a ice tray w pineapple juice and flot on top.  Bernie

I made this for a group on a hot summer day and everyone loved it.  I thought it was great and will make it again!  I used the maraschino cherry juice in place of the cherry juice - one less jug of juice to buy.
