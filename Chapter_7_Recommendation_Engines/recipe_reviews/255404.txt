First time making this recipe and I wasn't super impressed with the flavor. I made it exactly as written and it was much sweeter and not as spicy as I was anticipating. It was so nice and easy to make though and the consistency of the chicken was amazing! I will probably be making it again but I'll try and add some different spice to make it spicier. If you're looking for spicey chicken this really isn't it.
