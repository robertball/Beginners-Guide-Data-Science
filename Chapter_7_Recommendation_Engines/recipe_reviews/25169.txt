This is one of the best French dressings I've tried. Very thick and tangy. I would cut down on the oil just slightly. I tried a few variations: for the vinegar I used half rice vinegar and half balsamic. I also used brown sugar for more flavor and a thicker texture. No liquid smoke? Try a splash of worstershire.

This recipe is better than any french dressing that I have ever tasted.  It was so good that we served it on a salad after only being chilled for about 15 minutes.  I had not fresh chives so I used dry chives.  It worked great.  The pepper sauce gave it a "gently" spiced flavor, somewhat tangy!

Delicious! This could easily be a 5 star if the sugar were reduced. I scaled the servings down to half. I also believe that mixing this in a blender is a must. I used this on a steak salad for lunch today and it was a real treat. I will submit a picture. Thank you.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed hints from 2 reviews and substituted worcestershire sauce for the liquid smoke and pureed in a blender.  Everyone loved it.  Goodbye bottled dressing.

This was great! I have never cared for the bottled French dressing, so I didn't eat it. This was so good it is one of my new favorites. Thanks.

Fantastic dresing. Made it for Lodge dinner and 12 people asked where they could buy it. Used dried onions and chopped garlic to make a large batch with no problems

This is awesome!! Just like store bought! I usually cut down on the sugar, increase the vinegar, substitute worchestershire for liquid smoke and increase the hot sauce to taste. My boyfriend can go thru 1/4 bottle in a sitting so this is a real money saver!!!!

Really love this dressing Barb! Didn't have any chives so I used a bit of onion. The liquid smoke gave it a different and interesting flavor. When you realize how quick and easy it is to prepare salad dressings, you have to wonder why we buy the bottled junk! Thanks so much!

I scaled this down and still had left over. I used 3/4 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup miracle whip, 2 tbsp worchester, 1/2 cup sugar,  1 clove garlic, 2 tbsp of vegetable oil, 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, dried chives, tarragon, dill weed, salt, pepper and mesquite grill seasoning since I din't have liquid smoke.  It turned out wonderful I used it in replacement of ceasar dressing on a ceasar salad for 3 and  I am glad I have left over for more salads.

really, really sweet.  It was certainly the right 'color' for French Dressing, and it complimented the salad I served nicely.  Liquid smoke was nice addition.

Made as stated. This was good. I made this recipe so I could substitute Splenda for the sugar to save calories. Didn't notice any difference. I liked the chives and the smoky flavor. I used it in a chicken and rice recipe with great success. Would make again.

I did make a few changes.  I reduced the pepper sauce to 3-4 drops and the celery seed to 1/4 teaspoon.  I also used 1 teaspoon of crushed dried onion instead of the chives.  This is a wonderful dressing and I will be making this again.

A nice flavored dressing. I skipped the sugar as my ketchup tasted sweet enough, olive oil instead of vegetable oil and rice vinegar as that is what I had on hand.

My ex-wife has made a french dressing for years I thought was good but she never gave me the recipe.  I said I was going to make some earlier and she said she would do her's up. "No I am going to make it" I said. I made this and added about twice the amount of Tabasco. I used the habanero kind. We both loved it! Now she wants the recipe and is mad at me that I won't give it to her. Maybe someday =)  Thanks for sharing this.

This is amazing! I used both Worcestershire and the smoke, and adobo instead of celery seed and green onions- so much better than the bottle! Oh, I also added extra vinegar to tone down the sweetness. I am going to definitely use this again!
