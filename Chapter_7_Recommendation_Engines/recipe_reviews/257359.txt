The chase - the family loved it and it was voted a keeper.

I used a Vidalia onion because I didn't want strong onion flavors fighting with the pomegranate sauce.  

The next time, I will probably put two small limes instead of one big lime in the cavity, and put the onion in between.  I think I will cut them as well instead of piercing them with a fork.  

This chicken came out tender and juicy, and there were no left-overs.  I did cook the syrup longer than 10 minutes, but that wasn't a tragedy.  I ended up with a nice sauce to serve with the meat when all was said and done.

This was very tasty. I had to cook the pomegranate mixture longer than 10 minutes to reduce it to 3/4 cup.

Was absolutely delicious. Just added more brown sugar than recommended to sweeten the acidity of the pomegranate juice. I highly recommend this dish!
