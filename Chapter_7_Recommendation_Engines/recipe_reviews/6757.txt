Wonderful! I actually decided on this recipe since it called for baking powder instead of soda (which I didn't have) I halved the recipe since I cook for one and I definitely don't need a whole loaf lying around =) I did add about 2 T of melted butter to the batter as another reviewer suggested to make it a little more moist and just a dash more baking powder. It just came out a few minutes ago and it's very very yummy, just the right texture, not too heavy or dense! Will definitely make again. (Oh and sidenote....I noticed a Lot of complaints that this bread is too "dense and gummy" I'm wondering if everyone is remembering to use Very Over Ripe bananas? They should be completely brown and practically liquid themselves! If you use bananas that are not ripe enough it won't be a substitute for the liquid (i.e. milk, water) that most recipes have and the bread won't turn out right)

I was surprised at how delicious this bread is.  I made two types of bread - one claimed to be low fat, but had butter in it.  This one doesn't have any butter and was better than the other one!  I highly recommend this recipe.

This bread is good when it first comes out of the oven.  After that it is much too heavy and dry.

There isn't an option for anything below a one star. I tried two other recipes that same day, and they were great! This recipe was far too dense, dry and a waste of good bananas & nuts. It never did cook all the way either. Banana Bread I, was such a good recipe, try that instead.

I liked this recipe but I did tweak it. I added 3 tsp vanilla, 2 Tbs melted butter and a small dollop of sour cream and did half white half brown sugar.Came out rich, sweet and amazing. Highly recommended

Although this bread is hearty and delicious, I did find it somewhat dry.
I will make it again because it did receive great feedback from friends/family.

Heavy, dense, moist, not overly sweet. If I have bananas over-ripe I put em in the freezer with the skins on, then thaw em out later to use in this bread. The bananas will look terrible but they're perfectly fine to use.

My banana bread came out kind of chewy, but that might be a fault on my part, having never made it before.

Loved this recipie!! the only things though that I changed were that I added mini chocolate chips instead of the walnuts and I added just a splash of apple juice to make it moist. I also made a crumb topping for the top turned out soo good!!!!!

Turned out great! It was a little thick but I liked it that way. I did change a couple things though. I had read some comments saying it was a little dry so I only cooked it for 50min and will probably try 45min next time. Also I did not add the walnuts. This is a really good recipe.

I made this in 2 batches, one in muffin tins. I replaced 1/2 the sugar with Splenda, for lower calories. I dense, but really tasted great right out of the oven. I will make it again.

I love this banana bread. It is dense but full of taste. I added 1/3 cup of milk and 1/2 stick salted butter as some reviewers suggested. It is an excellent way to get rid of bananas that are ripening too fast to consume, which is usually the case here in Puerto Rico!

Chewy, rubbery, sticky and thick..I realize that it's a low fat loaf, but why sacrifice good ingredients to make gummy banana bread?  Add the oil or butter, it will make all the difference.

This is a great recipe. The bread is extremely good although a bit dry. It's a great quick way to get those over ripe bananas off the counter top and being enjoyed.

I also found that this a "starter recipe in that you can make a multitude of variations from this simple batter by adding fillers (ie: coconut, rum, any kind of nut including peanut butter, raisins, carrots, etc.). The possibilities are endless...have fun experimenting!

I have made this for some time as my family loves banana bread.(I got the recipe last year here) I make it for work now too. I even find myself freezing unused bananas to use later on and making 3 or 4 loaves at a time. Thank you for the terrific recipe. Better than the one bisquick has in their own cookbook!

made it twice.  Once as directed, once with modifications.  My modifications were 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening and 1 really good spoonful of vanilla and cinnamon.  Good as stated.  Better with what I doctored it with.  Sorry, just needs an added oomph and some oil to keep it from being really dry!

This is a fantastic recipe! Like a previous reviewer, I chose it because of it's lack of baking soda -- that it is a healthy option for a normally high-calorie dessert bread was a bonus! The directions are super easy to follow and very quick. The bread comes out dense and heavy, but that doesn't take away from the taste at all. I didn't have any of the problems with dryness that others had, but I suppose a dash of milk in with the mashed bananas would work well. The recipe is great as is, or with 1/4 or 1/2 cup of the flour replaced with quick cooking oats. Yum!

Excellent recipe.  I tend to add much more banana, and because we're baking I do add vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

This was good, but I've had banana bread that tasted better and was also low fat.  I probably won't make again.

Very good! I also chose this recipe because it called for baking powder instead of soda. Turned out very good! Next time I think I will throw in some chocolate chips for a treat!

I made this yesterday.  It reminds me of the bread my grandma use to make.  The only thing I changed were the nuts.  I used chopped pecans because that was all I had. I will make this again.  Thanks for a good recipe.

This recipe was great. I used two really ripe bananas and two that weren't so ripe, because that's what I had. I also substituted half a cup of ground flax seed for flour (so 1&1/2 c flour, 1/2c flax seed). The pan was a bit too large, so I only cooked it for 50 minutes. Turned out moist and dense!

This is a great low fat recipe. As with ALL banana breads you must use VERY over-ripe bananas. I didn't put the salt in though, and I used light brown sugar in place of the regular sugar, it was wonderful.

This recipe is a good 'jumping off' point to start your bread. I could tell from the ingredients that it was going to be a lot drier and heavier than most banana breads, and since you can't be afraid to experiment with a recipe to suit your taste, I modified the recipe in a few ways:

I added two more eggs, 1/3 cup of canola oil, 1/2 cup of milk, increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used turbinado sugar instead of white, and also added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract and 1 1/2 tsps. of banana extract (I only had three bananas.)

The resulting bread probably isn't as lowfat as the original recipe, but it's lighter, moister and sweeter - just the way we like it!

Yummy! I used whole wheat flour and added some chocolate chips. My kids (picky at ages 2, 4 and 5) gobbled it up. My husband loved it, too.

This looked like a great recipe. It was quick and easy to make and it smelled wonderful in the overn but honestly it was DRY and tasted horrible. The word for the texture would be "gumby". I was upset I wasted all the ingredients

only mediocre, sadly. Especially in comparison to the other banana nut breads out there. Added a teaspoon of vanilla, separated it into two 9 inch cake pans, baked for about 20 or 25 minutes. It was cooked through, but the texture was quite spongy (my main gripe), and the outside looked uncooked. Flavorwise, a little bland. I would sub in some brown sugar, maybe, to spice it up.

I made this recipe and made some adjustment and to my regret it was not a good loaf, however, the second time it was better, so some of the changes I made were the problem, however, the loaf was still not as moist as I like.

The recipe turned out okay, although I read the reviews before cooking and made some of the suggested tweaks to the recipe:

--added 1/2 c. milk, 1/2 stick salted butter, cinnamon
--omitted salt and nuts (I don't like nuts in my bread)

I actually used pastry/bread flour instead of all-purpose flour.  

The bread turned out moist and not too sweet, yet dense. I made 4 mini-loaves instead of one large loaf, and it still turned out fine.

I was looking for a recipe to use 4 bananas where most call for only 2 or 3 so I chose this one. Made it exactly as instructed and while it tasted OK, I really would not have known there was an extra banana in it. It was very moist but like other reviewers, I found the consistancy to be off somehow, almost rubbery or spongy. The kids liked it though and never noticed it wasn't my usual.

I used plantains instead of bananas and added cinnamon.  Both were good ideas...but this is still a very dense bread.  Heavy and chewy.

I'll still eat it all by myself, though!

This recipe is great to do your own moifications and make it your own.  I read one review saying that it was too dry so I added 1/2 cup of butter which allowed more moisture to the mix.  I also added in some cranberries, so have fun making this recipe your family's favorite.

Doubled this batch and it smelled and tasted great.  However, it was extremely rubbery and dense.  Could use less baking powder.

This bread had a great taste but was very dense and not very moist.

This was really easy tot make and deliciously moist, a big suprise since there was no butter! I left out the walnuts since I didn't have any, but it was lovely without them. I tried it spread with peanut butter but it overpowered the subtle banana flavour. Very yummy!

I added ground flax and sugar free chocolate chips. I also subbed sugar for stevia! It turned out amazing!

Swapped 4 tbsp white sugar for brown sugar. Added 1 tbsp vanilla and 2 tbsp butter flavored crisco. Baked at 350 for 45 mins in mid rack and left in oven residual heat for 20 mins to brown.

I used splenda and I did muffins. I think it cuts cooking time in half if you do muffins.

Love this recipe! Only changes I made were that I left out nuts and slathered the top in butter right after taking it out of the oven. Fantastic! Not sure why this says I made it 10 times, but I definitely will make it again.

I make banana bread on average twice a month. This week i forgot i had ran out of baking soda. And well i wish i had took the time to stop at the grocery store. The bread came out dense. Not as moist as i like it.

It was my first time to bake banana bread and I don’t think it can get any simpler than this. Makes for a dense treat so one slice is enough.

I made this recipe exactly as explained.  it worked fantastic!  the only thing I did different was use a 24-count muffin pan to make individual banana nut muffins.  if you're in a rush it only takes 25-30 minutes instead of nearly an hour to cook.  Thanks so much for a new favorite!

This is my favorite Banana Bread Recipe.  For a couple of diabetic friends I make it with 2/3 cups Splenda or Ideal (or 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup Splenda or Ideal).  My husband's friends think this is the best banana bread they ever ate and always hint for some when they go fishing.  To me, it comes out nicer in the 8 x 4 loaf pan as stated in the recipe.  I tried it once in a large loaf pan, same great taste, but the smaller pan cooks it differently and I like the way it turns out.

This recipe was very simple to make. Husband loved it. I thought it was pretty good, only problem I had with it was that it was too sweet. Next time I make it I will try using splenda. Other than that the recipe was great, it's a keeper!

Extremely heavy and dense, doesn't go down easily. Sometimes a recipe could use a smidge of fat to improve texture. I would only make this again if I was on the strictest of diets. I did like that it wasn't too sweet like most banana breads.

This is a very easy bread and I add in chocolate chips to make it even a little sweeter.  My husband and kids love it!
