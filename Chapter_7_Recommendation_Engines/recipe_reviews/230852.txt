My family loves pimento cheese, so, I am always looking for a new recipe to try.   I have never tried a recipe using sour cream, but, this was very good.  It tasted more like a cheese spread instead of traditional pimento cheese because you didn't get a strong mayonnaise taste.   I did add a little extra cheddar cheese.  It was very flavorful and I will make it again.

Served this with baguettes bakes in oven with olive oil, then sprinkled with herbs while hot. Topped with tomato jam.  This was a hit at Thanksgiving and will definitely make it again. I will take a picture the next time!
