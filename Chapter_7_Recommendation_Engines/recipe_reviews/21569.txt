This a great recipe and one I have had for years!  This can also be made without the msg and tastes the same.  It can also be made with low/no fat sour cream and mayonnaise and is still very good!  I have found over the years that using Hellmans Mayo give this dip a better flavor than Kraft.

This is almost the same recipe I use for what we call "Rye Boat".  Equal parts of sour cream and mayo, no MSG though (I don't even know why you'd add that!), garlic powder, white pepper, some Beaumonde if you have it, and the rest is the same.  Better if you make it a day ahead. Serve in a hollowed out loaf of round rye with the torn bread pieces for dipping.  (We always need some extra bread or crackers.)  The best part to eat is the "boat" when it's empty!

VERY GOOD and we didn't even refrigerate for the hour!  I scaled the recipe back to 10 servings.  Since the scale was unable to break down some items I basically eye balled the ingredients.  I didn't use the MSG or the dillweed (didn't have it).  I used crushed dried italian seasonings in its place. Will make again

A good base recipe, but I tweeked it a bit.
No need for the MSG. I added 3pkgs dried beef, 1 cup of miracle whip and added 2 tbsp Mrs. Dash for the seasonings..
Alowed to chill overnight and I used Thomas' plain & "everything" bagels...YUMMM

This is so good.  I have made this a hundred times now.  I have since started using a package of powdered ranch dressing mix for the seasonings, it turns out great.  I serve this with onion bagels or a multigrain bagel.  Everyone eats it up.

This is such good dip!  My husband loves it and makes it often, too.  Every time we take it anywhere, people rave.  We don't add MSG because that's ridiculous.  It tastes great without it and the dried beef adds plenty of salt.  And you can cut down on the dill a little and we use chopped dried onion.  With two packages of bagels, there's still a little dip left so maybe 2 1/2 packages would be better.  We usually do plain and wheat.

Our family and friends LOVE this recipe. I have made it for work food days and a Superbowl party. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I find the onion to completely overpower the dip.  And the longer it sits the more overpowering the onion gets.  So, my recommendations are to only use 1/2 an onion (minced, instead of chopped), twice the amount of dried beef, and omitting the MSG.  This is such a yummy dip for chunks of bagels!!!

This recipe is delicious!  I have made it numerous times, always following the recipe, and everyone asks me for the recipe.  I personally think it's a must to add the MSG, as it enhances all the flavors!  Very tasty!!!!!

The recipe I've been looking for! I had sampled this at a get together this summer and wanted the recipe ever since. The only things I did different is I omitted the msg and used dehydrated onions. I also had smoked beef freshly shaved at my local deli as it's MUCH better than prepackaged meat. This dip is excellent and a must try! I don't even like bagels, yet I love them with this dip.

I have made this dozens of times as have many other members of my family.  I agree that it isn't the same with out using Hellman's Mayo.  I always get the Budding brand beef.  I don't know if it is the same or not, but we use Accent Seasoning instead of the MSG. This is something I crave often.  I serve both Plain Bagels and Onion Bagels with it.  Love it!

I used dried beef in a jar and rinsed it as the directions on the jar said.  It worked great.  I serve it with onion bagels.

This recipe is ABSOLULTELY delicious!  I made it for a crowd of friends for an afternoon at a wine festival, and they are STILL talking about it months later. Such a great combination of flavors that go so well on pieces of plain bagel....and, so easy to prepare!

This recipe is very similar to a family recipe that we use on holidays. We don't use the refrigerated packages of beef because the flavor seems a bit washed out. Instead, we use the Hormel Dried Beef (in jars on the canned meat aisle near the tuna fish). We have also never used the MSG and it turns out perfect.

I have encountered this dip at several get togethers and never wrote down the recipe. I am surprized by the great flavor of this dip each time. I did not add the msg, but did substitute onion powder and garlic powder. I like this with a hearty wheat or rye cracker. You need something to dip that will carry the weight of the dip. I did not try the bread bowl, but will this Thanksgiving!

What a great way to use up beef jerkey! I started to make this and realized that I didn't have dill weed, so I substituted 2 Tbl of finely minced dill pickles; I also added only 1/4 cup of grated onion ...Thanks!

OMIT THE MSG & you've gpt yourself a 5 STAR+++ RECIPE!! WONDERFUL. If you feel you must use MSG (why would you anyway??) PLEASE do NOT use 2 full Tablespoons. That is just crazy!

We have made this so many times and i have never gotten a complaint.. you can also substitute dry minced onions in it. when the onions soften up it will make for a thicker dip.. we also add more dried beef.. careful on the dill a little goes a long way.. hope this helped and hope yall enjoy it as much as we did..

This was a tasty recipe, but next time I'll use less dill and the pre-packaged thin beef from the deli. I omitted the MSG,and served this dip with a combination of onion and plain bagels. It was good, but I had left overs.

This dip is so good. I took to a party with with cut up bagels and everyone could not get enough. I also did not use the msg and I didn't have an onion so I had to substitue onion powder. The only thing I added was a pinch of salt. I'm looking foward to another occasion when I can make this again!

This is a really good dip recipe - I will be making it again for Thanksgiving. I made a trial batch at first, halving the ingredients. I used a little MSG, plus the beef and it was waaaaaaaay too salty - unbearably so (and I am one who really likes salty stuff). So make sure you follow the instructions on the dried beef package and rinse the beef slices first - its much better this way, good flavor but not over the top salty. I also did not see a need to add that much MSG. I added some extra beef slices from the deli, chopped also. I served it was flatbread brushed with butter and garlic and toasted in the oven.

This dip was very tasty.  I used the garlic salt instead of MSG.

Been making this for years, yummy. I use no or low fat mayo and sour cream, only a dash of dill, plus garlic powder, either the onion or chopped green onions and never use the MSG. Use crackers to dip with also.

Yummy! Next time I would only add 3/4 to 1/2 the dill it was a little over powering for my liking. I will also add water chestnuts for a little crunch

Excellent!  Will make again - made exactly as directed but the night before and added the dill the next morning prior to the event I was taking it to.  Everyone loved it.

I love this recipe and so does everyone else! The dill is a little strong so I cut the dill in half and used a bunch of green onion rather than the white onion.

I tweaked this recipe just a bit. Instead of 2 cups mayo, I used 1 cup mayo + 1 package of cream cheese. Also, I didn't use an onion, but I will next time. Look for Buddig Beef at your local grocery store, it costs about fifty cents a package, and two or three packages wills suffice. Whether or not you add the MSG (sold under the name "Accent" if you can't find it) is up to you, but it is delicious either way.

I get so many requests for this dip I am almost tired of making it! Used dehydrated dill and parsley from last summer's garden and served it with Everything bagels. A definite winner.

The is a solid dip recipe, I had totally forgotten about.  I took it to a tailgate this weekend, and literally got rave reviews all afternoon!  People LOVED it!  I served the dip with Bagel Chips instead, only used half the Accent it called for (I know people say you can leave it out, but I truly believe it's the secret ingredient that gives it the kick!), and I doubled the amount of beef!

Great topping for a baked potato, as well.  No MSG and one "glass jar" of dried beef.  Note:  As one of seven kids, we ate so much creamed chipped beef (SOS) that almost all of our drinking glasses were from the dried beef...good memory!

Very good!  Also great if you leave out the beef and serve with Hawaiian Sweet Bread instead of bagels.
