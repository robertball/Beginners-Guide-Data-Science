These are a great low calorie, low sugar snack! My recommendation to help those who have trouble with the carrots crisping up would be to lay them out in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with paper towels, lightly salt the slices (I used a mandolin and sliced them diagonally), wait about 20-30 minutes, then place another layer of paper towels on top of the slices to soak up the moisture. Leave the paper towels on for about 10-15 minutes, then continue as directed with the recipe. This technique is helpful with all veggie chips, as vegetables contain high amounts of moisture. I made them twice, using salt and pepper, then again using a bit of brown sugar. I'm going to try soaking them in brandy with brown sugar and cinnamon next. Since carrots are naturally sweet, the sugar amount used should be negligible (about 1 tbs per 4 med carrots).

I must have missed something. I tried the vegetable peeler, as the instructions state; the strips were too thin and stuck together. I then tried the slice side of a grater, but it was way too dangerous for my fingers. I wound up slicing them in the food processor. After tossing with a sprinkle of oil and salt, I spread them in the pan and baked 6 minutes on the top rack then 6 minutes on the bottom rack. They were still raw. I alternated racks for the next 15 minutes and they never "toasted" (I even tried broiling them at the end). They taste like raw, soggy carrot peels. I'm so disappointed as I was hoping for a healthy alternative to potato chips.

With alot of roasted Vegetables, I  presoak them in salt water for at least an hour. drain well or blot dry and then proceed with  roast.  they will be more crisp. works great for carrots but also great for roasted rosemary potatoes.

My kids are chip addicts.  I spend my life trying to fulfill that craving while staying relatively healthy.  I tried the recipe as is, and they were delicious! But then, I expanded it to a spicy version (by adding 1/8 tsp black pepper and a pinch cayenne) and a sweet version (by adding 1/8 tsp cinnamon).

These were absolutely delicious. I cooked them just a bit longer to make mine more crunchy, but you have to be careful because they'll go from beautiful to burnt in no time. I also replaced the salt with garlic salt and parsley. Delicious!

Used sweet organic carrots and sliced thinly with a mandolin.  There’s a fine line between not being crisp enough and over browned (yeah, I had a few), so watch them closely.  On the positive side, even the over browned ones were incredibly sweet.  The carrot slices shrink substantially, so keep that in mind when you’re thinking about number of servings.  For us, this recipe would equate to 2 servings, not 4.  They may not be pretty, but trust me, you won’t be able to eat just one, they are surprisingly good.

I tried many iterations of this recipe because I really wanted it to work and it didn't. I used paper towels to remove moisture, tried thick and thin slices with my mandolin. It always came out awful. You have to be VERY light on the salt. The bigger issue was that  the carrots wouldn't crisp. If the carrots were thicker slices (Im talking 1/8 of an inch) they would just stay moist and bendy (even if baked for 4x the time in recipe). If they were thin, they would STILL either stay moist, or burn. Sometimes the ends would burn and the middle would stay moist and bendy. Also the texture was super rubbery.

These shriveled up to just about nothing. They either looked burnt or were soft. I am not sure where the crispiness is suppose to come in. I was soooooo hoping this was going to be good.

These.... didn't work well.  I had high hopes, but they just burned mostly. I used the method that Hanna Ramelot suggested and dried them out with paper towels. However, it must not have been enough, because they took way longer to start to crisp up in the oven than 12 minutes.  We left them in longer, and they started to burn (which is our fault).

Since they were still chewy, we stuck them in the microwave for about 4 minutes, which crisped them up well. 

I'll do it again, because we bought a mandolin just for cutting these carrots, but, drying them out is the key. I may just microwave them next time!

Awesome healthy snack! Tastes like sweet potato chips. They did seem to need an extra 3-5 mins to get them crisp though.

I have made  a note to only use large carrots.  The small carrots will only shrink to shoestring size pieces.  The flavor is great.  I will make again

Baking these right now. Going onto 24 mins now and still not crispy. Used the method of salting them and leaving them on paper towel for 30 mins, then covering with another layer of paper towel for 15 mins. Used another dry paper towel to squeeze them dry before adding oil, salt, and baking. Won't do this recipe again.

I tried these and they came out surprisingly good. You do have to watch them carefully so they don't over cook. Anyone getting softer results is probably peeling them too thick. I even tried a few entirely in the microwave on parchment paper and those came out good too.

These were a great appetizer for a dinner party I had. I had to cook them for 30 minutes, increasing the temperature to 400 after about 20 minutes in order for them to become crisp. I will make them again!

I think this recipe has potential, although it didn't work for me the first time. Some burnt while most were still too soggy. I will try the paper towel blotting suggestion and the putting in the microwave suggestion next time.

Loved them! really good option to replace potato chips if you are looking for a healthier and crunchy snack.

These did not turn out at all.  I had to double the cooking time indicated in the recipe just to get them crispy.  They shriveled up to match stick size.

After following the instructions, I ended up with partially burnt and partially soggy pieces. I noticed one reviewer basically created their own recipe off this. Sorry, I hate to give a one star, but this recipe was a waste of my time and carrots.

The pieces that turned out were good.  I put some to dehydrate to further dry and crisp. It was hard using peeler to get even-sized pieces.  Will definitely try again.
