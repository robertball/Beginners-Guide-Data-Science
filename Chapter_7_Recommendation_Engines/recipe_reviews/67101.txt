For those of you that have complained about the recipe, let me give you some advice. At no time should there be any butter floating as a glob that you have to "mop" up. You don't have your crock pot hot enough. Start it out on high if you plan on having this drink in a couple of hours. I let it usually simmer for 4-5 hrs and it is an after dinner drink. When the crock is steaming and the buter is glistening, then you have your batch correct. Don't add the rum to the pot if it is too much. Add it to the each mug to taste. If you alter this recipe with splenda or margarine and still rate this poorly, that is your problem. Best of luck to those who take another stab at it. I think you will be happier with the results...

This recipe is easy to make and serve. I served it with Thanksgiving dessert and received a ton of compliments. Since I do not keep whole cloves on hand, I just emptied out a teabag and put 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves in the empty teabag. I then put the teabag in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients. (I also added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon allspice to the teabag.) I love vanilla and added 1 teaspoon of that to the water mixture. These additions mingle well with the original recipe, especially if you love holidy spices like I do!

This was a HIT at my sisters Christmas party.  I did make the mistake of not having cinnamon sticks, so did a few good shakes of ground cinnamon.  BIG mistake.  I ended up with cinnamon floating at the top of the crock.  I just let it simmer, then poured it through a strainer to remove that residue and it was awesome.  Then I got some cinnamon sticks for when I make this again on Christmas Eve for the family.  It was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful holiday drink.  It is very sweet and stong, but a great after dinner drink.  I think it is a much easier recipe to prepare and forget about since it's cooked in the crock-pot.  It is our new Christmas tradition...all of the adults have a mug full, while the kids open and play with their new gifts.

Oh' My !!! .... This will forever be a traditional drink for the holidays in our family.  I was under the impression that this was made on the stove.  When I discovered that this was a slow cooker drink, I panicked with only 2 hours away from company arriving.  I decided to start out the batch on the stove and brought to a boil, then simmered for approx. 15 minutes.  I then placed the batch in the slow cooker and placed on high for 2.5 hours.  This was PERFECT !! ... I also agree, if anyone has butter floating on the top..... IT'S NOT READY ... Keep simmering until the butter is not floating on top.  KEEP THAT LID ON, and let it cook !! ... Thank You Linda Correia for this outstanding recipe !!

I was so excited to try this recipe.  The flavor was good, however, I have never had a drink with so much butter in it. I couldn't finish it and had to keep spooning butter off the top of the drink.  I really thought that I would like.  If you make this and are not used to having butter in your drinks, I would cut the butter down to half, if not more.

Awesome!!!!!! I did if for four of us for a Christmas meal I put together. Everyone was in awe of the incredible taste. Like eveyone says (who've tried it) - like drinking a liquid cinnamon bun. So good in fact, that I was asked to make more for another larger Christmas party on Boxing Day. Again, nothing but oohs and aahs.. This is now a Cristmas tradition for my Crock Pot.

UPDATE: For those of you who think there is too much butter, you really MUST stir it well before serving into each cup, then add the rum and top with whipping cream and freshly ground nutmeg. There is nothing better! The butter really gives it its rich taste. One more thing, use dark rum.  Made this for a party I had on Christmas Eve. Everyone raved. I doubled the recipe and added the rum to cups before topping it with this. The whipping cream and freshly ground nutmeg really made it. I think this has become a new traditional winter drink for us.

We enjoyed this very much on Christmas day.  It's very strong (at least for me!) so the whipped cream really made the drink for me!

This is SO GOOD! I made this for my New Years Day party and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe! However I had to make a few adjustments to what I had on hand. My crockpots were occupied so I had to make it on the stove. I melted the butter over med High heat added the brown sugar and 3 tsp ground cinnamon (I didn't have any sticks)and mixed well( like when making cookies) added the water, I used 2 tsp all spice( Didn't have cloves) added the pinch of salt. brought this to a full boil, then lowered the heat to low, covered and LEFT IT ALONE FOR 3 HRS. right before serving I turned the heat OFF added the rum( I used Captian  morgans spiced rum) served in mugs and topped with whipped cream! will make this many more times this winter and every winter!

Awesome sweet and buttery taste!  I only used 1 cup rum though, and it was plenty.  Super way to warm up on a snowy cold winter afternoon!  Absolutely delicious!

This was easy to make and it came out very well, except it was notably quite salty, much saltier than I'm used to hot buttered rum being. I think next time I'd leave out the extra salt or try unsalted butter.

Fantastic! I made this drink for a xmas party I threw at my house this year, a bunch of 20 somethings who typically drink beer and hard alcohol. It was a hit with everyone though, I will be making this from now on for all my holiday festivities. After reading the helpful hints I did put my crockpot on high heat for the first 30mins or so then let simmer on low for about 4 and half hours. It came out perfect with no "globs" of butter to be seen. I would recommend not serving  in a clear glass mug and maybe even preparing out of site of the drinker because I did get some comments about it basically looking like dirty water. But the whip cream covers it up and everyone still drank and loved it!

Very tasty but a little too buttery, even after 6 hours in the slow cooker. The leftovers went in the fridge in a jar, and a hard layer of butter re-formed at the top - once that was scraped off (and re-used in cookies), it was much better! Would use at least 1/3 less butter next time.

Very, very, very good holiday drink. I put everything but the rum in a crockpot on warm for 10-12 hours(really just let it sat on warm for the whole weekend) and then added rum to each serving/taste. Would make again.

Perfect for the holidays!  It was a little too strong.  Next time I make it I'll only add 1 to 1 1/4 C rum at the most.  The butter does form a disturbing layer on the top of the drink, but I just blotted the top of the drinks w/a paper towel before adding the whipped cream.  If you hold the paper towel there for a minute it will absorb most of it.  Will definately make again :)

Very tasty.  Followed directions exactly but halved it.  Not big on strong drinks and this was just right.  Very flavorful without being too overwhelming.  Was able to put in container and place in fridge and have over next few days.  Tasted like Christmas in a cup :o)

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and then again for Christmas and New Years. My family has not stopped talking about it all year. In fact I think it may be the most anticipated item on the menu this year! The real whip cream and nutmeg on top make this drink over the top special. Don't change a thing. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Delicious! Not strong tasting but I could feel the booze after my first mug :) Tastes like a spice cake or something, the whipped cream is an excellent touch.

OMG! This is the most amazing drink ever! I read through all the reviews and followed the directions. I did cook on high for one hour and then let it simmer for about 6 -7 hours before everyone was ready for their dessert. This will become a winter party favorite.

I haven't made this yet so this is not a review, just a question - could this be stored in the fridge for a week or two and just reheated? We would never use the whole recipe at once.

All I can say is WOW! Loved this! I made this for New Years Day in my crock pot and couldn't stop drinking this! It is very rich, which is what you'd expect from such a drink. I cooked mine on on high for about 2-2.5 hours and it was perfect. The butter was melted and simply glistened on the top.  The only changes I made was the cooking time/heat (as noted) and I added one extra whole clove and an extra cinnamon stick (b/c I had the short ones on hand). I also added Captain Morgan Spiced Rum which I would definitely use again.  Be careful not to add the rum until the last minute otherwise the alcohol will cook off. I did serve it with whipped cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg and it was delicious! I stored my leftovers in a pitcher in the fridge and warmed each glass in the microwave for about 30 seconds the next day and although the alcohol was weak by then, the flavor was all still there. I will definitely make this again for a winter party! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years now and it is such a hit I get in trouble if I don't make it! I love this recipe and will continue to use it for all my holiday gatherings! Thank you so much for posting such a treat of a recipe.

I made this over the holidays and it was a hit. I do think next time I will cut down on the brown sugar since it seemed a bit to sweet. I put the bottle rum on the side and let everyone add their desired amount. With a dollop of redi whip and a sprinkle of nutmeg this was the perfect holiday treat.

A super-yummy extra-indulgent treat!!  I used Spiced Rum, which I would highly recommend for a little added flavor.  Also, instead of whipped cream I put a small scoop of vanilla ice cream into each mug!

It tastes like a warm cinnamon roll. I used  less rum and it came out perfect. I thought 2 cups was a little much. So I used one instead and it was awesome. We made this last year and we will be making it this year too. A new family tradition to have it while having appetizers. :-)

I should have listened to the other reviews... It really is strong... Also VERY greasy even though I let it cook for almost 6 hours. The flavor was good until I added the rum, it ruined it for me. I could have over looked the grease if it wasn't so strong. Kinda disappointed....

This was pretty good, but a bit sweet.  My husband said that it left a coating on his tongue from the butter.  I think the next time I make it, I will only use 1-1 1/2 c brown sugar.

Awesome recipe! I made it for NYE & everyone loved it, quite a hit!  Easy too, just throw everything in a crockpot, forget about it and when its time to serve its ready to go.  Also good if refigerated & reheated (the entire batch of course).

THE BEST!  I had lots of requests for the recipe.  I add my rum individually in the mug instead of the crock pot.  That way everyone can have a glass - kids and adults.  Absolutely awesome.  I did add an extra quart of water to lessen the sweetness.

Very tasty.  I cheated and did it in a pan with ground spices (wanted something quick), and did only two servings.  At the proper temperature (and with my added vanilla ice cream) it was a very rich drink, and had no problems with floating butter.  Very much like a rum soaked cinnamon roll taste.

I was really disappointed. It was watery yet overly greasy without much other flavor. I couldn't taste the spices at all and definitely did get that "cinnamon bun" flavor that other reviewers mentioned. Was looking for a great hot holiday after dinner drink...I will keep on looking.

This tasted good but my sister inlaws and I had a hard time finishing them because you could see all the butter floating at the top of your glass.  I think I'll make hot chocolate or spiced cider next time.

WOW!  This was really incredible.  The great thing is that you get to smell it cooking all day.  I've never tasted such good hot buttered rum.  I rarely rate things 5, but this one deserves it.  It deserves a 10!

This was a super hit! I changed it just a bit. I used Splenda brown sugar and only a cup of it. I then sprinkled in just a touch of regular white Splenda. It was just right. I think if you used the entire two cups, regular brown sugar or not, it would be way too sweet. I will definitely make this again.

Perfect!  We usually start drinking it as soon as the butter and sugar is melted.  We used spiced rum - so good!

I followed this recipient to the letter, gave it plenty of time to cook in the crock pot. The overall taste was good, but it has far too much butter. After four hours, the butter separated and the result was a greasy, rummy batch that no one wanted to drink. I was in the middle of cooking a family dinner and although I checked on it throughout the day it was just a flop. I'm sorry to say we won't be trying this again.

Delicious and super easy to make.  I dialed down the recipe for just a couple servings, but still amazing.  Whipped cream on top is a must and if you can try bundling the cinnamon and cloves in some cheese cloth (it will make it much easier to remove later).

Perfect! Everybody loved it. I had to make a second batch! Very easy with the crockpot. I just put styrofoam cups, a marker to write the names on the cups and the can of whipped cream next to it. A new family tradition is born. Thank you Linda!!

Very good.  Next time I will cut down on the sugar by 1/2cup. We made this when it was -17 below outside and not a drop left.  Everyone loved it.  Thank you.

I made this for a BBQ this past wknd & it was a major hit! Considering we were outside most of the cool night, I had a feeling it would go over well.  I did use whip cream on top & I also sprinkled cinnamon & nutmeg on top of that ... it was delish.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  I left it on low for 6 hours & it cooked up great.  I would highly recommend cooking the recipe as directed.

This awesome! Used it twice over the holidays and everybody raved about it. It smells up the house wonderfully and you can go look at Christmas lights or whatever, comeback & it's ready to warm up all your guests. Very smooth, great nightcap.

Love love love!  I halved the recipe and used low fat (50%) generic butter.  Also used a couple sprinkles of cinnamon and allspice instead of cloves.  Great hot beverage for our tree trimming festivities!

I've made this for 2 Christmases now and it's delicious.  I add the rum individually as I found it too strong when I added the instructed amount.  It's good without the rum too for the non-drinkers!

Wooh man! This was VERY VERY strong for my taste! I added some more plain hot water to my serving. It tasted delicious after that. Next time I'll cut the rum down to  1 1/2 cups. I also melted the butter before putting it in my crock pot. I think it helped with it blending in. I didn't have it floating on top like some have said.

I wanted to test this recipe for my Christmas party and I'm glad I did.  I think this was good, but the brown sugar sweetness overpowered the nutty, buttery flavor that I was looking for.  Next time I try it, I will cut the brown sugar and substitute a little butterscotch schnapps for some of the rum.

Instead of doing this in the slow cooker, I just heated it up on the stove and then let it simmer on low. We didn't drink it all in one night, but it kept well for a few days. All you had to do was re-heat it. It was a tiny bit of an acquired taste for me, but now I love it.

I made this for new years eve and it turned out wonderfully.  I added the captains to each glass instead of in the crockpot so that it wouldn't turn out too strong.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it was great, there is butter in the drink obviously but it's not gross and slimey like some reviewers say.  I also liked how sweet it was, it was perfect for my family, I guess we have a sweet tooth.  I will make this again next year around the holidays.

WOW!  I just did a test run of this before I serve it on Christmas day.  I did a 1/2 recipe, except I only used 1/4 of rum.  I also used a stove top pan for speed and kept it just below a simmer for 2 hours.  I used spiced rum since it's all I had. I can't wait to put it in the crockpot tomorrow- YUM!!!

Had this for a Halloween Weenie Roast last night and it was wonderful.  Got rave reviews from all.  

I followed the recipe exactly.  It is sweet, and buttery...and all things cinnamon roll-ish.  Will serve again this weekend (by request) for a Knitting Party

I made this drink for our pumpkin carving party and it was VERY delicious.  I followed the directions exactly except I didn't put the nutmeg on top-I just skipped it altogether.  Be warned though, this tastes so good it can be quite lethal 2 drinks later when it sneaks up on you!

I made this the last two Christmas Eve's and it is absolutely delicious. It will continue to be part of our Christmas tradition. I double the recipe because everyone loves it and it goes fast. I haven't modified anything as it is perfect as-is. I top with whipped cream as described and also add a cinnamon stick as a garnish. Going to make this again this Christmas and everyone is looking forward to it.

Made this last year. Loved it, was the easiest to make with on hand ingredients. I like it as it seems the ingredients would be more what the colonials would have had available. I liked the idea of once made just turn it down to low and grab a cup whenever or pop some in a microwave for half a minute to reheat. Anxious for the weather to turn cooler so I can get it going again.

Made it just the way the recipe said.  It was so good.  My only (slight) problem was that if you didn't drink it fast, the butter tended to congeal at the top.

Every year my family requests this for our  Christmas Eve celebration. I keep the rum separate so everyone can make it their taste. I offer apple cider for those who don't want (or shouldn't have) the alcohol

Made this for an Ugly Sweater Party. It was a hit! Not a drop left! 2 quarts gone between 16 people. I followed someone else’s tip about not adding the rum and allowing people to make their drink as strong as they want it. Worked out great! Will be making this for every holiday party!

Added vanilla, and I made it with goat butter instead of cow (cow dairy household and family allergies). Tastes amazing. I also left the rum out, so that it could be added to taste, or enjoyed by underage drinkers who would like to partake (but wouldn't be able to due to booze).

I feel this would be the best example of what I imagine Harry Potter's Butter Beer tasted like. If you don't like the taste of rum...trust me, in this you will.

I didn't have any issues with this recipe.  It was perfect in every way and I never had any issues with butter floating at the top as other people have mentioned.  You'll just want to make sure you cook in your crock pot 4-5 hours.  If you do that, the butter will be a liquid instead of a solid because you are supposed to drink it hot after dinner.  We actually ate it with dessert last Christmas and my 85 year old Italian mother-in-law loved it, and she doesn't like anything I make.  I also used 1 cup of spiced rum and 1 cup of Don Q Cristal caribbean rum.  It was so smooth and there was no harsh alcohol taste.  It seriously was perfect.

Never made hot buttered rum before but I made this recipe twice this holiday season and it was a hit! I followed the ingredients and used dark brown sugar. Because I was on a time crunch both times, the first time I did this on the stovetop and brought the mixture to a boil, then put it on simmer for about an hour. The second time I did it in the crockpot on high for 2 hours and then kept it on warm the rest of the night. I agree that you should not see any butter floating on top, when the mix gets hot enough you won't see any butter and it'll be glistening instead. Recommend putting the rum in right before serving.

The flavor was close to a hot butter mix you used to buy in the stores. You need to make sure butter and brown   sugar is mixed well...

This is my first time making hot buttered rum, and maybe I'm just not a fan. I thought it was way too sweet and couldn't taste any butter. It tasted like hot sugar water.

UPDATE: (Since I can't delete or add to my last review).  I used spice rum and salted butter with no extra salt.  I also made it on the stove instead of the crock pot.  I added everything listed above the rum and brought to a boil til the butter melted then allowed to simmer til desired level of taste then added the rum per cup  and a splash of heavy cream as I didn't want to make or have whipped cream on hand or any vanilla ice cream.  Other then those slight changes I made this recipe.  Next time i may add a vanilla bean and possibly some whole all spice as well.  It does make the house smell great while it's cooking and this is tasty as stated but you do have to stir to keep butter mixed.

Another big hit at my house. I've served this every year for our Cookies and Cocoa party at Christmas time. The kids LOVE the "Fluffy Hot Cocoa" (see my review), but the adults come for the Colonial Hot Buttered Rum. My only problem is making enough, it goes FAST and each year, more people come to try "The Gopal's Buttered Rum".

This recipe MADE my party! Everyone loved it.(Esp. the men for some reason!) I added a bit of apple cider in the amount of the water that was called for. To keep it manageable for the night, I bought a hot beverage "pump" coffee urn from Sam's, filled it up with the prepared hot buttered part and then added the rum right into the container. It was like heaven in a glass and stayed hot all evening that way!! I will make this for every holiday party I have now. Heck, I might just have a party so I can make it again! lol

I just made this today for a Christmas Eve treat with my husband! I ended up leaving in the crock pot for about 8 hours on low because we waited for the kids to go to bed to enjoy it. It was wonderful and it tastes like Christmas in a glass. It sure took the pain out of wrapping presents. I made it exactly like the recipe... but there are a few things I would do differently next time. I used the spiced rum a few people recommended.. but I thought this was a little too much spice flavor next time I will use a gold rum for a lighter taste. I also got lazy and used cool whip. This was TOO SWEET! Next time I will be whipping my own cream. It was a keeper recipe.. Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this last year for a holiday party & everyone loved it--I'm so glad it's still here, I've been sick for 3 days & nothing sounds good--except for this!  Scaling it down to 4 servings & will share with my husband (of course) and praying for a good, deep sleep!  Thank you Linda for posting the recipe and the helpful comments as well.

Great recipe, especially on a cold day.  It really does taste like a liquid cinammon roll with a kick.  Follow the advice to get the crock pot very hot to ensure the butter melts.

i made this and it smelled delicous all day, but when the time came and we actually had some, it was kinda mediciny tasting and the butter as other have said, floated to the top and made my lips feel all weird. It was very unpleasing. And It Wasnt because my crock pot wasn't hot enough because i had it simmering for 12 hours. I will not make this again, i made it, me and my hubby took 2 sips, and threw it out and ended up have rum and coke instead.

Very good! I actually added the spices in ground form and no one complained...in fact, everyone asked for seconds! Thanks, this is a good one!

I made this on Halloween because we were going to be sitting outside around a fire and I wanted a warm cocktail.It was awesome.I followed it exactly and made a huge crockpot of it.At first I thought I made way too much and would have leftovers, but erverybody kept refilling their mugs and saying they loved it.Not for the calorie conscious though!

Made this for Christmas Day last year, it came out good but very strong! I will probably make again, but I will cut down on the liquor.

I used Splenda brown sugar (caution: read the label and only use half; it's concentrated!) and I also used Light apple juice from Walmart Supercenter. I used Reddi Whip extra creamy whipped cream from the can and sprinkled nutmeg on top. I love things that are sweet, but please notice that many of the reviews say "it was so sweet." Even though I used "light" apple juice and Splenda, I must agree, I would cut the brown sugar down to only 1 cup or 1-1/2 at the very most. Y'all this stuff is wonderful but TOO SWEET. I added a stick of unsalted butter (no margarine for me!) and I added 1/2 cup of Butter Schnapps for a smooth flavor. I will make again for an upcoming Christmas Carol Hayride, but I will cut the brown sugar. Everything else was good, and I loved using my slow cooker and making my house smell wonderful. Thanks for the post!

I thought that this recipe was a bit watered down tasting.  It was better heated up the next day.
