My husband LOVED this recipe and I liked it ok. Next time I will try it with a few changes. I think I will probably melt the margarine and the garlic together let the chicken "marinade" in that for a few minutes while I put the rest of the ingredients together. I felt the chicken was kind of bland inside this VERY flavorful coating, and this will probably help the chicken to have a little more flavor of its own.

I loved the idea of the oats on the outside. Very different texture -- very good! Overall a good recipe, but with a few changes, could probably be GREAT!

Made as recipe suggests, except used boneless/skinless chk breast cut into strips & cooked for 35 min at suggested temp.    Also, added about 1 tbsp honey to soy milk to help coating stick.  Delicious and easy recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I scaled it down to 2 servings for 2 chicken breasts and it was delicious.  I did only use 1 tsp of the main spices because I knew any more than that may overwhelm the dish - it was perfect.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

My family loved this recipe, even my son who picks EVERYTHING apart to investigate. This is a great way to make crunchy chicken without frying. Rather than using butter, I sprayed with olive oil.

My family just ate this chicken and we ALL loved it!  My 15 year old daughter was hesitant at first because she saw the oats on it, but tried it and went back for seconds.  My husband said he wasn't crazy about the way it 'sounded' when I read the recipe to him, but also went back for seconds.  I wouldn't change a thing.  The oats give it some texture but you don't taste an 'oat' taste at all.  Also smelled WONDERFUL while cooking!  This is a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I always thought eating healthy was bad tasting.  I have been trying to eat healthy and I have to say this is too good to be healthy.  I love this and passed this one along too.  Instead of butter I used "Can't believe it is butter" sprayed on both sides.  Delicious!

This was good- the oats weren't sticking well enough though, so it seemed like I was just coating chicken with spices. It came out moist and the chicken tasted really good, but I didn't care for the oatmeal coating much.  My kids enjoyed it though, so that's good!

I cooked it as something different on the spur of the moment.  My 8-year-old daughter and my wife were both skeptical (at best).    My daughter, after taking a bite, was the first to exclaim, "this is great!" and then made mention of the meal several other times tonight.  My wife and I were both pleasantly surprised at the vibrant taste, and what the oatmeal did to texture more than taste.    CHANGES WE MADE:  We decreased the amount cumin ever so slightly, used seasoned salt in place of the salt, and omitted the butter for health purposes.    This is an exceptional variation on boring baked chicken, and we'll have it again many times in the future.

We really wanted to like this recipe, but we just didn't.  The chicken was tender, but the crust just tasted funny.  I even ran the spices and oatmeal through the food processor like others suggested.  I *may* try this again, but I would change the seasoning.  The chili powder/cumin/paprika just didn't taste good to us.  Thanks anyway~

I ground up the oatmeal like many others suggested.  This needed salt.  I also added some curry and about 1/4 tsp of sugar before the bake (I tasted it before dredging the chicken through it). Since I only used skinless chicken thighs, I baked at 400 for 20 minutes on one side, flipped it and baked for another fifteen minutes.  Very moist and flavorful.

I wanted to make oven-fried chicken but was out of breadcrumbs. Saw this recipe and thought well it's probably nothing special but, hey, I DO have all the ingredients.  I was pleasantly surprised, it was really tasty!  Like some others, i put my oatmeal and spices in a blender and ground to flour consistency  To save 
on calories I skipped the butter drizzle and just 
sprayed with cooking spray. This was probably a mistake as I had some of the dry coating that never moistened and had to brush it off. But otherwise, pretty darn good. Will make again

Excellent recipe. This dish fits into our eating plan with the oats as a coating for the chicken. Very nicely spiced. I only have whole rolled oats so I put them through the food processor to chop them up a little. I also used skinless, boneless chicken breast halves. Then, instead of drizzling butter, I sprayed "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" butter flavor spray on it. I'm sure real butter would have been better, but we can't eat that, and the butter spray worked just fine. My husband is leery of trying new recipes but he went back for seconds, and ate the leftover piece heated and put on a salad for lunch the next day!

I made very few changes to this recipe.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into tenders (more surface area, yum!) and upped the garlic powder by at least double, because I love garlic!  This recipe was so amazingly delicious that I immediately shared the link with many of my friends who are turning to a healthier lifestyle!

I followed this recipe to the letter and Oh my! Who would've thought this would be so good. Mine didn't look as good as the pictures but it was very tasty. After I pulled it out of the oven and was putting finishing touches on some potatoes, people kept sneaking in the kitchen scraping oatmeal chunks off of the pan. Weird :D but I understand. I was doing the same after a while. I love the crunchies! lol What are you waiting for, cook it already!

Followed the recipe fairly close, but added 1 tsp onion powder and added olive oil to buttermilk, then drizzled olive oil on top, as well. I baked in a Crisco greased CAST IRON skillet, and baked 35 minutes. Used boneless breasts and thighs. Moist and flavorful -- thanks!

I really liked this recipe.  I changed a few things based on what I had in my cabinets and other reviewers.  I didn't have the spices listed in the original recipe so I used garlic powder, minced garlic, Italian seasoning, crushed red peppers, black pepper, and Tony Chachere's.  I used reduced fat milk (2%) and added honey to it.  I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut them into strips to decrease cooking time and because the breasts were fairly thick so I was worried about the penetration of the seasoning.  It smelled AWESOME!  I checked on it about 20 or so minutes later and it was DONE!  I'm glad I checked because I've read from others that it can sometimes come out dry.  By the way I also used some of the milk mixture to drizzle on each piece once on the baking sheet/pan before I baked therefore I didn't use the cooking spray or butter as suggested.  It came out a little spicy due to the red pepper flakes but other than that it was pretty darn tasty.  I will make again and take the suggestion of placing the oats in the food processor to see if that gives it a good all over coating.  I posted pictures as well.  Very pleased with this as it gives me another creative option for my usual baked chicken.  ENJOY!!

This was just okay for us. The chicken wasn't crispy like I expected, and the flavor was pleasant but not anything to get excited about. I doubt I would be bothered to make this again.

Very very good recipe. Very healthy ánd very very delicious, even with really cheap chicken. I used a pan with olive oil and cut chicken fillet into pieces, then replaced the milk with egg since I ran out of milk and added more spices, since we're a big fan of spices. Me and my boyfriend enjoyed this very much.

Really good.  I was surprised as ingredients seemed kind of weird for baked chicken.  Did not have cumin, but followed recipe, except added a sprinkle of hot red peppers to oatmeal & spices.  Used chicken thighs (boneless & skinless).  Very moist.

I REALLY wanted this to be good...I am on the quest for the ultimate oven baked crispy chicken...this just didn't work that well for me.  I tried to spice it up, I added honey to the milk to help outmeal stick to chicken, etc....I just can't get a cripsy oven bake with anything I try.

I made this tonight with chicken legs. My oldest son and husband really liked it. I thought it was ok, but legs are not really my fave. That could have been the problem. The outer flavor was good, and everyone liked the crunch. My youngest is picky, so I left his plain. I think I'll try his with little to no spice next time, but still use the oatmeal as a coating. Overall, a good, easy and inexpensive coating for chicken. Much healthier than frying. 

The spices were really good (I added 3/4 tsp onion powder). I think they'd make a great rub.

Ok so I was sooo excited about making this, I made sure I had all the ingredients...or so I thought.  I ended up having grits and not oats.  So I did what I do best and improvised.  I used Raisinbran Crunch.  Threw all the ingredients in the food processor and 40 min later voila!  A delicious dinner.  Hubby said best breading he's had!

This chicken is really amazing. I took mine out of the oven after 40 minutes on the dot and had a very moist, delicious dinner! I couldn't finish it all last night, so I popped the remaining half in the toast oven for ten minutes and had it for lunch! It was even better the next day! The only thing that I did differently was use Hungarian Hot Paprika (available at CostPlus... also an excellent addition to egg salad) instead of regular. I like my food to be very spicey :)   I'm going to make this ten jillion times. It's really awesome. Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

This is awesome! My whole family LOVED it - even my picky 12 yr old! The oats give a great crunch, and the cumin adds an excellent burst of flavor. I used marinated chicken (costco!) then rolled each breast. Came out soo juicy and tender. Definitely a keeper!  THANKS!

I eat a lot of healthy foods so I am not a stranger to alternative presentations of traditional dishes. I wasn't completely sold on this one, though my family agreed the flavor was quite good. I think next time I will try another reviewers suggestion and throw the coating into the food processor.

This is quite good.  I made small changes to add to the healthy factor.  I added some wheat germ and flax seed to the mix, used almond milk and olive oil instead of butter or margarine.  It came out very juicy and the spice factor is up to you.  I could have done with a bit more.

This is the best baked chicken I have tasted! It's that good! My husband and I end up fighting over the oatmeal coating. I find that the recipe needed more butter to coat the chicken evenly. I usually do the called-for amount of butter and some olive oil mixed together.  And I pour the mixture over the chicken. I love this recipe!

this recipe is like one that I make except I use crushed "honey bunches of oats" cereal instead of oatmeal. It makes it crunchier and if you have a sweet and salty crust..

As a very inexperienced cook I took on this simple recipe without any trouble at all! To keep it a little healthier I used soy milk and also used boneless chicken skinless breasts. It was delicious and the boyfriend made sure we saved the recipe so I can make it again (that never happens)!

Pulsed oats and spices in the food processor to grind the oats up some and thoroughly mix. This is a good base recipe that urns out a crispy coating and could be used with any spice or herb combo.

didn't turn out well for us. Despite a butter drizzle the oatmeal did not crisp up and was flabby and soggy. Chicken was really moist, but no flavor. Won't make this again.

I hate to be the odd man out here but I was not impressed with this recipe.  I had a hard time getting the oatmeal to stick to the chicken.  After I put it in the pan the chicken look dirty (due to the spices-chilli pepper and paprika)and not appetizing at all.  I'm glad others opinions were a little different.

I recently prepared this recipe for dinner and I honestly have to say, "It was great!"  After I mixed all the dry ingredients together, I used my hands and worked the oatmeal until it had the consistency as flour.  I rolled the pieces of chicken in the milk bath first, then rolled each piece in the oatmeal coating.  The coating held fine.  No problems whatsoever. The only thing I changed was not using the butter.  Instead I used a non-stick spray very gently covering the chicken and let it cook!  The chicken came out juicy and tasted great!  I didn't mind not having a crunchy taste to the chicken, that didn't matter.  The flavors, the spices were excellent!  I loved it!  I had to watch the time, as the coating began to turn slightly dark, so that told me check it to see if the juices ran clear and they did so otherwise no problems!  As it was cooking, the smell was making us hungry and we couldn't wait! I will make this again and try using Soy milk or coconut milk.  One reviewer mentioned honey...gotta try that next.  I truly liked the spices (could be a little hotter...add more chili powder).  I will be making this again.  My husband loved it!  This will be made again and I will add this to my recipe box...it's a keeper!  I had a taste for "Fried Chicken" and remembered I'm trying to cut down on fried foods, this was a wonderful alternative! Some of the suggestions got me thinking to "change up" when I prepare this again.  Thank you for the recipe! Five Stars!

I had some chicken that needing cooking before it went bad, and I wanted to try something new. After reading other reviews I marinaded my chicken for 2hrs in Lawrys Baja Chipotle marinade. Then realized I didnt have paprika or chili powder. So, I mixed oatmeal with garlic seasoning, and some creole seasoning. I didnt need the milk because the oatmeal stuck right to the marinade. I drizzled with butter and baked. Towards the end my oatmeal was soggy (maybe I used the wrong type of oats?) so I broiled it for 5 mins with made it crispy on top. I actually liked the texture and flavor that the oatmeal added. So, I will try this again when I get all the right ingredients. BTW, I am a single person so I cooked this in a toaster oven.

I love the idea...  But, it was a little dry tasting.  Based on others reviews, I tried to add juiciness by brining the chicken in salt water...  this could have been a poor execution on my part but I probably won't try this one again.

I really wanted to love this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  Smelled GREAT while cooking.  Chicken stayed very moist.  I liked the flavor of the coating in the few places that were crunchy - but the majority of it was mushy!  I don'y know what went wrong :(

This was a mess and I couldnt get the oatmeal to stick. However I did like the spices but I used different spices. Like Cajun Spice instead of Chilli powder. And garlic salt in stead of garlic powder and salt. I felt like I wasted ALOT of oatmeal.

I didn't care for this.  I thought the chicken lacked flavor - all of the flavor was in the crust.  And because it's cooked uncovered, mine dried out a little (not too bad, but not juicy!) The whole oats were a little strange - maybe grind them in a food processor?  My husband said it was good, but needed adjustments - and he never says anything negative about my cooking.  So.... guess this isn't a keeper for us.  Darn!

This was FANTASTIC!   I made one addition.  I added rice to the pan, and the proper amount of chicken broth ( whatever amount of water the rice calls for it to be made) This way it turned out to be a one pan dish.  The rice absorbed some of the flavor of the chicken.  Plus, the chicken broth keep the chicken moist.  I will definitely make this again.

The chicken was very moist and tasty. Next time we are going to make it with just thighs and legs, our preference, other than that we kept everything the same. The only downfall with this recipe is that it is quite messy. Lots of napkins, but worth it!

This was a very easy and much healthier alternative to frying.  We usually bake our chicken anyway, but the oats added a great texture.  The only thing I will probably do next time is blend the outs down to a flour rather than leave them whole.

I was getting ready to cook chicken strips when I found this recipe.  Ingredients are ones that are usually in your home.  It is easy to make and everyone really enjoyed it!!  Next time, I would let the chicken stay in the plastic bag and place in the refrigerator so they could soak up the spices.  We really liked this!!!

We love oatmeal and I've never thought of putting it on chicken so I tried this recipe.  It was somewhat of a disappointment.  It smelled awesome cooking but in the end it didn't taste like much.  I do think that it has good potential so I'll experiment more with it.  Perhaps adding some other spices and/or a different coating.

This was pretty good. It was enough to make 6 drumstikcs and 3 breasts. I also improvised and added some crushed Special K and potato chips to the breading. The flavor was good, but next time I will cut the amount of cumin in half. It was a little overpowering.

This is a tasty recipe, and quite healthy as well. The only thing I will be doing different next time we make this dish, is using an egg white instead of milk to help coat the chicken, I found that milk did not work that well. I recommend trying this one for sure!

Loved this recipe. It's wonderful for those who can't do flour. I didn't have paprika, but it was still good. I halved the chili powder as my family doesn't like too much spice, and I doubled the garlic because we love it! I also put all the dry ingredients in a blender and chopped it all up into a semi-fine powder. My husband loves lemon on his chicken, so instead of dipping the chicken in milk before coating it, I dipped it in lemon juice. Very nice tang. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the flavor!  I scaled back a little on the chili powder, and next time I will use boneless chicken breasts.  My boyfriend loved it.  Thank you!

I liked it because I was kind of shy in the cupboard but I had all these ingred.s, the only thing I did different was I used real garlic, I was out of powder, Marinated with it and butter like the earlier review and only thing I would change is a little less chili powder and not over do it on the coating because it is a little dry and if there's to much it doesn't blend together well.

I cooked this for my husband and I last night and it was GREAT!  I seriously thought I had dried out the chicken just because I didn't cover it.  And, when it was cooking smelled a bit like I had over-seasoned it with the chili powder and paprika -- BUT alas, it was the most moist, flavorful, and good-tasting chicken ever!  And, the oatmeal on it was delicious.  

I used the advice below to put lemon juice in with the melted butter (I use Smart Balance marg-great tasting!) and drizzle the mixture over the chicken just prior to putting it in to cook and came out wonderful.

**Instead of the whole chicken I used just 1 1/2 lbs. of boneless, skinned chicken breasts, keeping it at the same temp of 375 but reducing cooking time to 35 min.  Also, brought down the serving size for the recipe 3 servings.

Thanks, we will make it again for sure as my husband already has claimed the leftovers for today!  And all the ingredients are ok to eat on the Blood Type Diet as well!!  Thanks again to the recipe originator and to the folks who posted reviews!!  Diane  :)

I found the chili powder to be a tad overwhelming.  If I were to make this again, I would only add half the amount.  The oats didn't get crispy.  So, perhaps I would grind them up a bit before adding to the mix.  Overall flavor wasn't too bad, maybe a little blander than I had expected though.

It was pretty good.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was ok.   Nothing special unfortunately.

I think next time I will cut down the salt to half, and I will use Bisquick instead of Oatmeal, and coat the bottom of the pan with 2 tbs. melted butter for an "Oven Baked Fried Chicken". I didn't really like the texture of the oatmeal; otherwise, the spice mix is just perfect, and I would use it for a regular baked chicken if needed.
