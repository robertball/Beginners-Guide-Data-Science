Very good! Omitted the bell pepper and added 2 tsp or Cumin. Very good!

Made this exactly according to directions and it felt like something was missing -- added 1.5 cup of cooked rice and a total of 6 corn tortillas (cut into 1" squares) and it was much better. If you don't mind the calories, some sour cream would go great on top. A can of black beans might also go well.

We loved this.  Substituted broken corn tortillas crispy from the oven instead of putting the flour tortillas in because that was what I had.

Very good.  Brought this to an office luncheon and everyone enjoyed it.  Made it with corn tortillas and fresh mushrooms.

Not bad at all! I used frozen turkey leftovers that were a little dried out, and the dish came out moist and tasty! My 4 year old who hates turkey even ate some. :)

I just finished eating my 3rd helping of this. I did alter the recipe a bit to use up some leftover corn and mashed potatoes. I added about 1/2 cup whole kernel corn to the turkey mixture. After I had dumped the turkey mixture into a greased pan, I minced up about 1/8 cup jalapenos and about 1/8 cup onions. I added that to about 4 cups of mashed potatoes. I added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 teaspoon minced garlic to the potato mixture and stirred it all up and then spread it atop the turkey. I baked it according to the directions but I did keep it covered with foil for the first hour. I added the cheese and bake it for 5 more minutes. I plan on making this according to the given directions, but I just wanted to use up all my leftovers and it turned out great. Kind of like a Mexican shepard's pie. Hubby and daughter gave it a thumbs up.

Oops! I made a couple of mistakes when I used a large can of tomatoes (20 oz - just not paying attention) and left over gravy instead of the cream of chicken soup (to avoid the unnecessary salt). Those 2 choices added up to a thick stew rather than a casserole. The flavour was great although I will at least double the chili power if I do it again.

I used 24 oz chicken.  I used 1 3/4 cups of cheese instead of two cups.  I omitted the mushrooms and used extra green pepper and onion instead.  It was very good and filling.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good! I would suggest sauteeing the onions first because I personally don't care for crunchy onions. Also wish I would have added more cheese throughout and on top. Overall, very good..thx!

Delicious and just the right amount of "kick"! The only thing I did different was to use fresh mushrooms (I have a huge aversion to jarred mushrooms!) It was a big hit at my house. Thanks for the recipe!!

I read some of the reviews before making this, and chose to use corn tortillas for the bottom and top. I also sautéed the onion and fresh mushrooms before adding the rest of the ingredients to a bowl to mix it all together. 
We like chili powder so added a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon, and I put sour cream spat on a couple short rows just to try it out that way over the top layer of cheese. 
Otherwise made it exact and it was a great.  Easy to make as well.

OMG, this is a wonderful recipe.  I used what I had on hand, sub'ed canned tomatoes and green chile for the Rotel and I left off the cheese topping.  It turned out great.  I cooked this in a microwave oven for 20 mins. with the glass top on the casserole dish.  I will make this again for sure.

I cannot follow a recipe w/o tweaking it - even my own.  Fresh mushrooms, sauted in a little evoo and butter to add flavor and reduce moisture, make this even better.  And sometimes I drain the Rotel to reduce the liquid as well.

Left out the bell pepper and onion, and this still had great flavor! Found another great recipe that will be requested every time we have turkey.

Very bland - maybe use a jar of salsa? More chili powder? Cumin? Also, be sure to saute the onions. Made the recipe as is. In any case, my family voted - adios recipe (unfortunately).

I followed the recipe except for using some fresh sautéed mushrooms left from another meal, and I used a little extra cheese. We served with a dollop of sour cream and some salsa. This was very good, and even better when we reheated don’t fit a second meal! I’ve got more turkey in the freezer and will make again!

Odios indeed!  This was delicious and didn't taste like leftovers or turkey.  I used smoked turkey.  After a taste test, I doubled the Chili powder to suit our tastes.  Next time, I will substitute Poblano peppers or Hatch chiles for the bell pepper to add some more kick.  This was so good we hate to wait for the next holiday.  I wonder if we could sub chicken for turkey?

This was delicious! I rarely cook with canned soup, so I was hesitant to try, but my husband and I loved it. I did add fresh mushrooms instead of canned as well as a freshly chopped tomato because i had them on hand and needed to use them up. I will definitely make it again.

This was a great recipe! I didn't have cream of chicken soup or mushrooms. So I took about a stick of butter and melted it & Sauteed the garlic in it. Added flour to make a roux. Added half and half and water until it was a good consistency. I also used an extra can of tomatoes with green chiles.

As noted in a few of the other reviews, my first attempt at this casserole turned out a bit 'soupy'.  My wife and did love the flavors in the recipe.  We will add cooked rice and black beans to our next version.  Overall, I think this is a good recipe that we will be using again soon.

This was a great way to use up our Thanksgiving turkey in a different dish than the typical casserole. I did make a couple changes...I added 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice as suggested by another reviewer and also added some black beans. It was the perfect consistency. We ate it with sour cream and salsa and it was very tasty. I would definitely make this again!

This is a great dish to use up left over turkey after a holiday.  The best part is it is so different from my stuffed turkey meal that my family doesn't feel like they are eating leftovers.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream and my family really liked it.  It did come out a little more 'soupy' than I would have liked, but taste was great.  It was a little bit more firm and the taste was even better the second day.
