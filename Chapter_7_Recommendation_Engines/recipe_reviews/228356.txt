Michael has a recipe for Asopao?!!! I'd like to hear the story behind this recipe. Anyways... I made half of it. I didn't measure the amount of adobo I used (not sure how much "1 serving" is anyways, 1/4 teaspoon if I go by what the bottle says and that would have been too little in my opinion). I didn't change anything but if I had had gandules (pigeon peas), I would have probably added those instead of the petite peas. This is Puerto Rican comfort food. Very nice on a cold rainy night (like tonight). I added some sliced avocado on top. Good stuff!

When I'm cooking for myself, I love to make this a bit hotter with fresh habanero or jalapeno slices.

Filling and flavorful it was! I had a different meal plan for dinner today but got distracted and found this recipe instead when I browsed through the pictures. We love our traditional chicken and rice but wanted to try something different. I halved the recipe for my small family and made little adjustments due to availabilty; I only have pimentos itelf so i added a touch of that and to sub the salty/briny taste from the olives, I tossed a little bit of capers. Also used rotel tomatoes and green chiles, and just all red bell peppers. The broth is awesome. Thanks for the recipe and glad to see a picture to the recipe already.

Made tonight for the first time. I had never heard of it before. Wow...what  a delicious recipe! I cooked the rice separate and served it on the side.  The rich tomato broth was outstanding. The chicken was super tender and juicy. This recipe will be made many more times in our home!

This was an awesome one pot meal...I used a can of Goya Green Pigeon Peas since my local grocer did not carry the frozen petite peas. I wouldn't have used as many green olives though since I am not a fan of them. Other than that, I still give it two thumbs up and will surely make it again!

Wow, amazing dish. Even better tasting than I thought it'd be when I read it.  I substituted black olives because that's what I had, and made my own adobo from a recipe here on allrecipes. Served with fresh avocado, warm flour tortillas, and refried beans on the side. Will definitely make this again.

For those that could not find the Adobo Seasoning, it is a seasoning  mixture that contains a blend of spices and herbs (i.e. garlic, onion, salt, oregano, etc...) in specific portions that have been ground to a fine powder form.  I usually find it in the international section of the grocery store.  Though I have no doubt that using the can chipotle adobo sauce as a substitute made this very tasty, it also makes it a complete departure (and taste) from what the authentic flavor of this soup should be.

This recipe was AMAZING!! My whole family loved it! The aroma from cooking had me impatient for it to be ready so we could try it. The only thing I didn't add was the peas. This recipe is a keeper!

Very simple to make for a novice chef, turned out very tasty, even my 2 year old son ate it.  I left out the peas, substituted veggie broth, and put in cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes. A great comfort food dish.

I couldn't find adobo seasoning, so I sub'd chipotle peppers in adobo (4 de-seeded and finely chopped) and omitted the red pepper flakes.  Fabulous recipe!  I will make this again!

Excellent soup. Its a great start. All that is needed is to season to taste. I used Traci's Adobo Seasoning on the site since I didnt have any. I add some extra chili powder & red pepper to kick up the heat to were I like it. Also added some asparagus and mushroom. Its great how easy it is to add whatever you have laying around. I look forward to making it again during the winter and hopefully with some avocado next time

Always looking for authentic Puerto Rican food and this recipe doesnâ€™t disappoint. Great flavors! I finished off with adding a tablespoon more of adobo at the end with a dash of salt.

Loved this. Added 4tsp of chicken adobo. I also added shrimp for last 10-12 minutes.  

This was just like the shrimp and chicken asoapa that I loved in Puerto Rico.

Try adding a tsp if smoked paprika, chili powder and some cumin. This recipe is great for personalizing.

Absolutely delicious! It's a simple recipe with great flavor. The olives and cilantro make this dish spectacular. I added sofrito, as we Puerto Ricans add it to almost every main dish, and I also added some sazon. I omitted the peas as my teens don't like them. I will be making this often. Thanks for sharing!

This was AMAZING! I skipped the hot peppers so it wasn't spicy. I wasn't sure how much adobo to add, I ended up using about 1.5tbsp. We loved this recipe!

Made this last night with boneless skinless chicken thighs cut in half.  Awesome recipe.  My only change was I couldn't find adobo seasoning so I did what one other reviewer did and just used adobo sauce that came in a can of chipotle peppers.  It wasn't as hot as I expected so next time will increase crushed red pepper or add some cayenne.

Really easy to make, and delicious. I used black olives. Love the cilantro in it. I also seasoned the chicken with Penzy's Arizona Dreaming. Definitely making this one again.

I was looking for a great dish with chicken thighs, and this was an amazing dish to stubble upon.  I served it to a couple of friends for dinner.  It hit the spot on a chilly autumn day.  

Things I changed: I added a seeded diced jalapeno to give a bit more kick.  I have pre-measured packets of adobe seasoning.  I used three instead of one to give the chicken that beautiful red/orange color.  Last, do not cover the dish while it is simmering.  I did by habit, and I had to cook it for a bit longer to get the liquid to absorb.

I made this dish EXACTLY as written. Absolutely outstanding.  My wife of 25 years said it may have been the best thing Iâ€™ve ever made.  I let it simmer for about an hour and it thickened up nicely.  Thank you for sharing!!

I thought this was okay. I followed the recipe exactly, just used some low-sodium products and chicken breast instead. When I got to the end, I thought it was better just cutting the chicken into pieces for eating. Make sure to use a good sized pot. I hadn't thought to add green stuffed olives to rice. I liked that flavor. The recipe reminded me of chicken and rice in stewed tomatoes with olives, if I had to explain it. I have never had this type of dish before. It has a slight hot kick too. I am assuming from the red pepper flakes. It was filling tonight, but just really quite a bit more time consuming than I had originally expected from beginning to clean-up.

Flavorful and easy to make!  I used more chicken and cut them in smaller pieces used some of my favorite chicken seasonings.  Served it with fresh avocado, I didn't have cilantro on hand or else that would have been even better.  Will definitely make it again for my family!
