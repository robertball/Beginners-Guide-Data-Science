Excellent! Made as written and this turned out perfectly. The cream of soup and beef stew seasoning was globby going in and it worried me but it cooks down into the perfect consistency when it is done. I chose the slicing method. Be sure to let it rest for 10 minutes on a cutting board for easy slicing.
