While I liked this very much, I would make the following changes:  Use less sugar in the topping, and more in the fruit; increase the fruit, and/or omit the water, so it will be less soupy and have more concentrated fruit flavor.

This was good, peaches and blueberries are always a great combination. However, I had two small problems with the recipe. Firstly, I found the fruit layer a drop too tart. I usually cut the sugar in recipes, but here even I think it needs more sweetner. In addition, as a I try more and more cobblers I'm finding that there are two basic types - with the dough on top or the dough on bottom. It seems that when the dough is on top (like it is here) you tend to get a compote with cake floating on top, not a real cobbler. I think I'm going to keep looking for more dough on bottom recipes.

Very quick and easy.  I used frozen peaches from last summer and it turned out great!  The topping more cake like (like my grandmother's) vs. biscuit like (like my mother's).   The dish needs to be at least 8" sqaure and 2" deep - my dish was a bit shallow and a lot of the juices ran over.

Delicious, but way too soupy.  I had to eat it with a spoon!  Next time I'll add more fruit, less cornstarch/water mixture.  I'll also double the topping next time, as I had barely enough to cover the fruit.

Wonderful cobbler!  (Note that the crust is cake-like.)  The only change I made was to add 1/4 tsp. cinnamon as well as the 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the sugar coating.  Serving warm with vanilla ice cream is a must!  Thanks for the recipe!

I, too, added the blueberries at the end of the cooking-fruit-process so they would be more likely to stay whole and they did.  Nothing at all wrong with this recipe, but not GREAT.  I like great.  :-)  I did like the way the batter formed a sort of crunchy crust on top as it baked due to the coarse sugar sprinkling.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this for our 4th of july cook-out and everyone loved it, especially my teenage son. evey bit was gone that night. The peaches and blueberries really complemented each other. The topping was very good,I did add cinnamon to the batter and sprinled cinnamon/sugar over top. DELICIOUS!! my son has asked me to make it again.

This is a great recipe.  I made this recipe for the first time in February when peaches were out of season with 4 cups of blueberries and it was wonderful.  Well peaches are in season now so I had to try it mixed with the blueberries and it is still to die for.  Yum Yum!

Really fresh, full-of-flavor, fruit works best.  I add app. 1 tsp. of almond flavoring to the batter.  My husband loves it!

I enjoyed this very much. My peaches were not very soft and juicy so I decided putting them in a baked dish would be the best use. I had frozen blueberries too. Except for adding some cinnamon to the sugar topping I made this just as written. I have never been a big fan of cobblers because I think of them all as having that kind of doughy biscuit-like crust. I really loved this cakey crust. It changed my attitude about cobblers. My fruit was a slightly soupy and I think boiling down the fruit a bit more, or maybe a little less water, would have corrected this. My taste; I would add a little more sugar and less lemon juice to the fruit next time too. But then my peaches werenâ€™t super sweet either. It seems like something that needs to be adjusted to the fruit you have on hand. I will make this again. And an added thought, to avoid the soupiness and obtain a gooeier fruit base; Originally I used a 9 x 9 glass baking dish and the fruit seemed a little deep and the batter  kind of thick in spots. (I ended up adding more baking time to compensate too.) Next time I might spread the fruit and batter out more in a 7 x 11 glass baking dish that I have.

I have also had this recipe a while.  I add some salt to the topping as well as some cinnamon and nutmeg.I use part frozen peaches-part fresh along with pinches of cinnamon and nutmeg.    Also, add blueberries after thickened along with juice and butter.  That way the berries don't fall apart.  A 9 inch glass cake pan was just right for this recipe.

Oh, so, so yummy. I made it instead in smaller Corningware (bakeable) cups. The topping is beautiful - puffy, golden, light - and the fruit is delicious together with it: the combination was incredible - no overly sweet: just perfect.

This cobbler was very good and I would have given it 5 stars except it took me a LOT longer than 15 minutes to prepare it.  So long, in fact, that I probably won't make it again, and instead will go with a recipe that doesn't require heating the fruit before assembling the cobbler.  I also didn't care for the dark juice caused by the blueberries.  It gave the peaches an unattractive color.  Nevertheless, the cobbler was very good and I would recommend it for anyone who can peel and heat peaches faster than I can.

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!  I USED 2 CANS OF DRAINED CANNED PEACHES AND CUT THEM UP, AND FROZEN BLUEBERRIES.  I ADDED 2 TSP OF TAPIOCA AND A TSP OF CINNAMON TO THE FRUIT AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT!

This turned out so yummy!  The blueberries overpowered the taste of the peaches a little, though.  I think next time I would cook the brown sugar mixture longer without adding the fruit until just before it's done.  That way the fruit stays firmer and holds it's flavor better.  The cake part was perfect.

This was very tasty, but I am used to cobbler with a more pie crust-like topping.  Everyone that tried it agreed that it was delicious, but shouldn't be called a cobbler.  I just have to come up with a new name for it, because I will definitely make it again!

This was very yummy comfort food! The only things I did differently were swap out buttermilk for the milk, which required that I reduce the baking powder to 1/2 tsp and add 1/4 tsp of baking soda, and add a little extra cornstarch (about 2 more tsp). The cobbler smelled wonderful baking in the oven, and looked delicious and bubbly when I pulled it out. This one is definitely a keeper.

I can't believe ANYONE would adjust this recipe!  All I did was double the recipe and it was a SMASH HIT I took it to work and it was gone in about 5 minutes.  Everyone wanted leftovers so I had to promise to make it again soon!  The crust is PERFECT i like a sweetness to my crust but it wasn't overpoweringly sweet.  The fruit was AMAZING, again sweet but not overpoweringly sweet.  I would definately reccomend using fresh fruit only for the recipe as canned fruit is already too sweet.  5 Stars-I will NEVER make another cobbler recipe again this is it from now on!!

This was really good but I thought the crust was a little too sweet for me.  Next time I'll reduce that and it should be good to go.  For punch, I added 2 Tbs of orange liquor and 1 tsp of almond extract to the fruit filling and 1 tsp vanilla to the crust.  Yumm!!! Will definitely make again!

This tasted SO good - I made 1/2 a batch, and my husband and I polished it off in one sitting! YUM!

His only suggestion was that it could use more fruit/sauce - but I think I'll just add more peaches and blueberries next time.

I quite liked this recipe. The only change I made the second time was to add more fruit, as we like that proportion relative to the amount of biscuit (which is delicious) a little better.

Loved this!  Made the recipe as written, except sprinkled with sugar in the raw and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Baked for 35 minutes, let it cool just a bit, topped with whipped cream, and yum!  I wanted to get just a perfect picture, but it's a cobbler, and the filling is never perfect, but it tastes wonderful!

This was the best cobbler recipe I've tried in a long time. The cake was light with good flavor. I wanted equal amounts of fruit and cake, so I doubled the amount of fruit, sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice, but not the amount of water, as it would have made it too soupy. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Liked the consistency and flavor of the topping.  I would use 3 1/2 cups of peaches and 1/2 cup of blueberries the next time I make it.  Using so many blueberries took over the flavor of the peaches.  Otherwise, it was delicious!

I have never made a cobbler before and thought that this was fairly simple. It was a big hit at the dinner party. I liked the big taste to offer for fairly low amount of calories!

My husband who eats anything said it was ok, but not to make again.  Said it was stringy, but the cobbler topping was good.

This was good.  I used more fruit than what the recipe calls for.  It is definitely a more like a cake with fruit on the bottom than a cobbler, but still good.  You might could pour some pineapple or orange juice on top to moisten it.  Thanks for the good recipe!

This was really good. I had to use canned peaches since I didn't have fresh. I drained a 29 oz. can peaches and cut into bite size.(about 2 cups). Used 1 1/2 cup blueberries and added 3 cups sliced strawberries. Also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I doubled the sauce, except for the lemon juice, left that at 1 T. I also doubled the topping. I wanted everyone to have some of it. I put in a 10x13in. corning oblong casserole dish. I was serving 10 people. I got about 18 dollops on top.The topping was very soft and wet and didn't rise a lot but tasted good. I added some half n half for part of the milk since I use skim milk. I had enough topping left over, that I made a smaller 8x8 in dish, using a 29 oz can peaches and about 2 cups blackberries without the lemon juice. I liked that one better. It was hard to find coarse sugar, but the bakery in a grocery store was willing to sell me some that they use. It really adds a nice touch. Anyone know where else I can get it? I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg in the sugar. Served with vanilla ice cream and everyone enjoyed. Thanks Amy!

Really good!  We used orange juice in place of the lemon juice & for the topping we used a little less milk & cut in the cold butter rather mixing the soft butter, we dropped the crumbly topping over the fruit & baked.  When it baked up it was crisp & delicious on top!  We ate it warm right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream on top.

I added a little more flour to the crust to produce a more biscuit-y crust. I used 1/3 a cup instead of 1/2 a cup of sugar in the dough, too. For the fruit filling, I used 2 cups of peaches and 3 cups of berries. I added 1/4 cup plus 2 or 3 T. packed brown sugar. That way, the filling was perfect! Not too sweet and not too sour.

Good base for a cobbler...but I personally thought that it needed some additional spices...maybe some cinnamon. Loved the topping...perfect consistency. I didn't peel the peaches (I never do for baked dishes), but other than that I followed the recipe as written. Next time I'll add some additional spices to the mix...and it will be perfect.

Great recipe..except it said "sprinkled w/nutmeg and cinnamon", but couldn't see the cinnamon on the ingredient list..other than that.. would add more peaches since they cook down..just the right amount of sugar!! Didn't have fresh blueberries, used frozen. Use a 2 qt. square glass pyrex dish, otherwise I think it would go over the top.

This recipe was ok. It needed more sugar. I added a little more fruit and a little more butter but I should have added some more sugar. Otherwise, it's ok.

I love this recipe.  Rave reviews every time I made it.  It's so forgiving, too.  I was missing milk the last time and substituted some half and half and water, and realized after I poured the fruit in the casserole that I forgot to add the butter and lemon juice (I was rushing!) and it still turned out great.  It's also very easy to scale up, the proportions are a sliding guide, I add a lot more fruit and don't up the other stuff much and it's wonderful.

This is awesome!  I added a little bit more fruit (1 c more peaches and 1 c more berries), and it was wonderful.  The sugar on top gave it a nice crunch.  I took it to a dinner party and we almost finished it between four people!  I highly recommend it.

Delicious!  Added an extra peach, since 3 cups didn't look like enough fruit to me.  Also added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the fruit mix after taking off the stove.  I didn't have coarse sugar, so just used regular (about 1.5 tbsp) and it was fine.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.

Prep and cooking times are not right.  Giving 5 stars because this is soooo very delicious! Everyone in my family could not get enough.  I had so many peaches that I decided to double the recipe and bake in a 13x9 pan.  Almost too much for that size pan.  I made everything exactly as written other than adding a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the cobbler batter.  I didn't put the fresh ground nutmeg and sugar on top until the cobbler had been in the oven for about 10 minutes (I forgot).  

A problem I had was that I expected the batter to be a little thicker if was to be spooned in mounds over the hot fruit.  My cobbler batter was quite thin and so I simply poured it over the top (maybe I did something wrong).  Also, I found that the prep and cooking time were way off.  Even adjusting for doubling the batch, the prep time (removing skin from peaches, pitting, slicing, and the cooking time to thicken) was far more than double of what was indicated. Of course, the cooking time was extended for a double batch, but even so, it cooked for over an hour before it was done.

I've been making cobblers for 30 years and this is the best I've ever made!  The filling wasn't too thick as it sometimes is which tends to give a dry product.  This was just sweet enough.  Great recipe.

Good cobbler (maybe slump is a better name).   Substituted nectarines for peaches because they were on sale.  Enough sugar for our tastes.   Thanks - will probably make it again.

I really like this combination.  I made the fruit part the same but added a lattice topping just because I love cobbler that way! Thank you for the recipe!

I used olallieberries (like blackberries), because we had just picked a bunch.  Instead of the coarse sugar (I didn't have any.) I used cinnamon sugar on the top of the cobbler.  I wasn't sure I would like the cake like cobbler, but it was very good!  I would make this again.

The crispy, tender cobbler topping was perfect.  The fruit had just the right amount of sweetness--the flavor was enhanced, not overwhelmed. Delicious!

Yummy! The fresh fruit was key to this great cobbler, and the blackberries I added were good, too. I will definitely use this recipe again - especially when I want to impress someone with my baking skills! Vanilla ice cream was perfect as a sidecar.

This cobbler was the best cobbler ever! I added another tablespoon brown sugar, and a bit more cornstarch to the fruit mixture. I do not like nutmeg so I just sprinkled Turbinado sugar and cinnamon over the top before baking. Perfect! This will always be my co to cobbler recipe.

Wow! This was so easy and so good! I used mixed berries since we don't have peaches yet, but that cobbler/cake/crust came out perfect.

This was good!  Everything was perfect... Simmered the fruit, brown sugar and water sauce with 2T flour since I didn't have cornstarch and it thickened up just right in about 3-4 min.  Hubby liked it; I thought It could use maybe 3/4 cup sugar instead of only 1/2 as called for but maybe it was because I used peach/strawberry mix and strawberries tend to be a bit tart.. The only thing that would have made ours better was some ice cream or whipped cream!.. :)

Excellent recipe! I had about an extra cup of peaches and extra half cup of blueberries, so I used all of both. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Delicious flavor. Only glitch - it was very soupy.

I didn't make any changes and it turned out wonderful.  I will save this recipe and make it again.  I  brought it to a party and it was GONE.  I baked in a 8x8 glass Pyrex in my toaster oven for 35 minutes and it was perfect golden brown.

I used 4 medium sized peaches. It was late in the season and the peaches were very ripe. I also used 1 dry pint of blueberries. I reduced the amount of water in the peach/blueberry mixture from 1/2 C to 1/4 C.  Also, I increased the sugar in the peach/blueberry mixture to 1/2 C. Finally, I increased the cornstarch from 1 tablespoon to 4 tablespoons. Since you're cooking the fruit mixture in a saucepan before it goes into the oven, you can determine the amount of cornstarch needed. I cooked this for about 45 minutes and it came out great. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is delishous.  I have made it several times now.  I substituted gluten free flour for regular flour since I am gluten sensitive and it was great.  I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the cobbler and used a little less Sugar on the fruit because the ripe peaches made it sweet enough for me.

I used Splenda instead of sugar in the fruit mix...and I switched the amounts of the fruit - 3 cups fresh picked blueberries and 1 cup of fresh peaches. On the topping I used Demerara sugar with a little cinnamon and the nutmeg. Whipped cream on top instead of ice cream made it just right. Yes, it's a little soupy as others have said, but I didn't find that a problem as the biscuit/cake topping soaked it up well. If you have some 'soup' left why not pour it over a dish of ice cream to finish it off.

I read the reviews before making this and made a couple of adjustments. I used a few less blueberries and added about 1/2 c of raspberries because I had them and needed to use them. For the sauce I used no water because other reviewers said it was soupy. I also omitted the lemon juice and in place of water and lemon juice I used about 1/4 c (maybe less) limoncello. It was delicious. I mean to.die.for. So said my family. I will be making this every year during peach season.

Absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe using the peaches and blueberries I had on hand and only made one change which was I used turbinado sugar mixed with cinnamon for the biscuit topping. Simple and easy and really great tasting! Can't ask for more than that! Add ice cream, fresh whipping, or cool whip to take it over the edge! Thanks for a great recipe!

Good flavor but like others...don't use that much water and up the fruit. I used half the water and a little less cornstarch and it was still sort of soupy. I think just a teaspoon of starch and no water will give the perfect consistency. More peaches and blueberries just made it better too.

I doubled the topping and omitted the water as my peaches were ripe and had a lot of juice.  Added 1 more tsp of cornstarch to ensure it thickened up enough.  No nutmeg, but used cinnamon and sugar on top.

I made this peach and berry cobbler, today.  I read some of the reviews and did some changes.  I added 1 tsp. almond flavoring to the flour mixture.  Doubled the coarse sugar and substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg topping.  I used 2 peaches sliced, blueberries, dried cherries and dried cranberries I had on hand.  I left the brown sugar at 1/4c. and doubled the cornstarch.  I baked about 40 minutes.  Everyone loved this cobbler and it is a keeper.  I printed this recipe out and put in my binder along with a gold star in top right corner to KEEP.

The recipe is easy but I completely agree with some of the previous reviews.  The water in the fruit filling should be reduced and the sugar should be increased (and I, too, usually decrease sugar).  The next time, I will try 1/3 C water and at least 1/3 C brown sugar.  I think the topping is just fine with both a crispness and a bit of a chew to the dough.

My son and I loved this recipe.  The only changes I made were to reduce the water and corn starch by half and to add more fruit.  It was delicious with vanilla ice cream.

I made this according to the directions except I put the batter on the bottom of a greased dish and poured the fruit mixture on top. It was still a bit cake like but moist and delicious!

I made this recipe as written and it's fantastic!  I used 5 fresh peaches to equal 3 cups.

It was good both hot and cold. Pleasant surprise! I freeze blueberries at the height of the season and added them frozen and everything was totally yummy. The 'cake' topping was a nice touch.

I doubled the recipe knowing how delish this Peach/Blueberry Cobbler was the first time! Thanks for wonderful recipe, Amy. As you suggested I used lots of cinnamon for the topping with brown sugar. Depending on how juicy your fruit is, as mine were from the Okanagan orchards - you might want to use more cornstarch. Ovens all vary in temperatures; mine was done in under 30 mins in a 3qt glass dish, so best to test a few minutes before cooking time. The aroma is scrumptious. A definite vanilla ice cream topper!

This cobbler was the most delicious dessert I have ever had. I made it for my mom's birthday and it was gone in the blink of an eye. I followed the recipe to a T and it was unbelievable. The cake part came out wonderfully and was bursting with flavor while the peach/berry mix was soupy and amazing. Can't say enough about this dessert. I will be keeping this up my sleeve whenever a dessert is needed at a party.

I thought this was pretty good. I liked the cake-like topping. Sugar and nutmeg added a lot of flavor on top. I would make it again.

I Loved it! It was easy and delish! I usually love the biscuit portion so for this recipe I added so I could have more. I also addeda little cinnamon to the sugar and nutmeg. It came out perfectly and my hubby thinks i spent all day making it.

Very good recipe.  My husband LOVES this pie and he is not much of a pie lover.  I have made it for him 3 times so far within 2 weeks.  I followed the recipe step by step not changing a thing and i would recomend to do so.  IT was GREAT!

OK-not the best I've ever made.  Definitely edible, but the topping seemed a bit bland and the filling didn't set up as well as I would have liked. My peaches were very ripe and juicy, so maybe they made the filling too soggy.

Great taste!  Top was fluffier/cake-like than I expected, but that made it lighter and it absorbed the juices well.  Next time I'll add more peaches and use a bigger pan so it doesn't spill over.  : )

I thought the filling was great, but the cobbler top was too dense and sweet.

This was pretty good. I think a little less nutmeg next time and maybe a pinch of cinnamon. I'm not sure I really liked the peaches all that much, maybe because I used frozen. The blueberries made it delicious!

This came out so delicious! It was not too sweet like most bought cobblers. I am not a great baker but this was easy to bake. My peaches were very juicy and I should have added more cornstarch but that is the only thing I will change if I again have wonderful juicy peaches.  Thank you

This recipe is great!  I substituted the flour for Pamela's Pancake and Baking mix so that it would be gluten-free, used all the butter, but decreased the brown sugar.  It was excellent, and didn't upset my stomach!  Not too dry, not too soupy, it was just right with soy-vanilla ice cream.
