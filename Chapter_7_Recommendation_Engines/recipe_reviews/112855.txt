I'm not sure what went wrong with the other reviewers recipe, but I've made this twice and it was delicious.

The 2nd time I made it I didn't make the raspberry sauce, but followed the glaze recipe you can find here and used that. Next time I make it I will use the recipe sauce and mix it with some marscapone cheese and make little dollops of raspberry cheesy goodness to try on top of the cake.

This is a horrifying, sodden mass...it didn't rise and tasted horrible.
I followed the recipe exactly..and you could use this as a very effective door stop.
