Make it even better, as a Balkan and East European flavor, by creating a roux of paprika and vegetable oil.  Make it just like a flour based roux except use GOOD quality paprika and veg oil.  Heat the about 1 or 2 tablespoons of veg oil, when it's hot not burning, add a tablespoon or two or paprika and cook it a bit to let the paprika release it's flavorful oils.  As your cabbage stew is simmering and hot add the paprika roux.  If it sizzles in the stew when added, then that's a great sign.  Stir the roux into the stew and it's done!  The added flavor makes cabbage stew even BETTER.   I prefer sweet red or lightly hot paprika in this stew.  Smoked paprika is good too, but I prefer the straighter sweet style.   NOTE:  We make a a very similar cabbage stew in both vegetarian and with meat, usually pork.   We don't use a pressure cooker, just a smaller stock pot, bring all the ingredients to a rapid boil, then turn the heat down to a sturdy simmer until the cabbage is tender.  To me fresh cabbage stew smells great.  I've made it using sauerkraut cabbage, and that one is a bit smellier.  :)  I prefer the sweeter taste of fresh cabbage in this stew.

Very good! I don't have a pressure cooker and I'm not detoxing, I used a stainless steal pot instead. Sauteed all the vegetables and garlic first in olive oil, then added the broth, tomatoes, vinegar, lemon juice and sage. I had the soup on a light boil for about 15 minutes and then simmered on the stove for about an hour or two. Yum...

I made it, but put the ingredients into a stock pot, and brought to a boil. Reduced heat to simmer for an hour. and half., or so.   I loved it, but wife hated it.  She does NOT like cabbage, or garlic, or celery..  I wonder why she keeps me around here.

It was a cold, snowy day and I had all of the ingredients so I gave it a shot!  The only change that I made to this recipe was that I rinsed and drained a can of cannellini beans to make it a bit more filling.  Also, my cabbage was Chinese cabbage, since that's what was in my fridge.  My star rating is for how it tasted immediately after cooking it.  I found a little black pepper went a long way in improving the flavor.  This soup actually tasted even BETTER THE NEXT DAY, so I might give it a five star rating for the leftovers factor.

This is a great soup and very basic. For the person asking for amounts of sodium and potassium it is really up to the person making the soup to control that. There is "no sodium"  tomatoes available and anyone can google potassium levels of foods.  If you are on special diets you should know what you can or can't have already .  Thanks for the recipe. For those that don't. have a pressure cooker this just needs a big pan on the stove top to cook. It's not rocket science people.

I have made this a couple times and LOVE it!  I follow the recipe almost exactly - except I add a clove of garlic sometimes and I buy a bag of coleslaw mix because the cabbage is already shredded and is shredded finely so no big chunks of cabbage.

Haven’t made this yet, but wanted to answer the question “can it be made on the stove?” The answer is yes you can make this on the stove in a regular pot. Just cook it longer, until the veggies are the softness you like.  The pressure cooker just cuts down the cooking time. Hope this helps. This soup looks delicious, and we plan on making it soon, but may add some sausage to it to please my husband.

A decent soup, a little bland. But for love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, stop calling things "detox". There's no such thing as a detox soup, smoothing, or diet. That is utter nonsense and spreading lies to people dumb enough to believe it. The ONLY thing that can detox the body is the liver.

This is a very tasty vegetable soup that was my go to 5-6 meals during the week.  At 67 calories, you can afford to also have a couple of pieces of French bread or other crusty-type bread for a hearty meal.  My only change was leaving out the vinegar, as I don't care for the flavor.  Great recipe, thank you!

My first try at the Instant Pot! Thanks so much for giving me courage. No thyme or apple cider vinegar. Used more lemon juice. Not really interested in cleansing, so salt, a good teaspoon and some pepper. Watch the pepper, it intensifies. A bay leaf. I used the whole box of stock, 4 cups, chicken.
It was wonderful.

Healthy nutrient filled soup in no time. I added a whole diced tomato from the garden in place of canned. Cook time was spot on. Good simple detox soup.

If the vinegar and lemon juice make the soup too acidy, add a pinch or two of baking soda. Perfect remedy!!!

Don't have an Instant Pot so made it in a Dutch Oven.  Added a can of Chick Peas.  It needed extra liquid so added a can of V8 juice.  It seamed to need something else for flavoring at the end so I added about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Turned out great.

I used the suggestion of adding a paprika roux, that really warmed it up nicely. I used the full 2 tablespoons paprika stirred into hot oil in the bottom of the Instant Pot (set on saute) then added the other ingredients.  I used 1 T balsamic vinegar and 1 T apple cider vinegar, I thought the balsamic might add a nice flavor. Because I used low salt canned tomatoes and my own bone broth flavored with just a bay leaf, I really needed to add some salt to give this soup some zip - but that's the nice thing about homemade soup, you can control the salt levels. I'd make it again. Next time I might add some berebere - an Ethiopian spice mix.

I make some version of this about once a week. Sometimes I add cooked shredded beef or chicken at the end. If I'm not in a hurry, I sometimes toss in whole chicken pieces with it and let them flavor the soup, but then carefully remove bones and skin, cool and skim fat. I buy always use fresh cabbage, onion, carrots, celery, and garlic, and then add the veggies I have on hand, including frozen corn from summer if I have any left. I now make the paprika roux recommended by another reviewer, usually with smoked paprika, and then squeeze in about 2 Tb concentrated Italian tomato paste and saute that for a minute before adding onions, then garlic, then canned tomatoes and juice, then all other ingredients. Once it's cooked, I store some in 8 oz mason jars for quick portable, healthy lunches.

Followed the recipe. It was okay at first. I really didn’t like it by the third bowl. I think it was the apple cider vinegar that made it too acidic for my taste.

Everyone liked it.   I made it according to the recipe.  I think it had too much vinegar; will reduce it next time.

Did not like the sage flavor. Might try it with thyme one day.

I made this according to the recipe; only I added fresh thyme instead of sage due to personal preference, and added more chicken bone broth. It is great with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt in the bowl (in place of sour cream).  It's easy to control sodium levels; just get low or no sodium broth and tomatoes and add sea salt to your taste level.

I have made this recipe multiple times in my Instant Pot and is always excellent. I altered this recipe slightly by adding more chopped tomatoes and about an additional cup of vegetable broth. The idea of a paprika roux sounds great & am going to try that next.

Great as is, was nourishing when we weren’t feeling well.  I added red beans because I had just cooked some the day before & wanted to use them up. Went well with it. I may add some crumbled cooked turkey sausage next time. I think it would taste great in it.

(Instant pot users): To be fair I made quite a few modifications. But I really wanted to leave a suggestion for those using an IP. I noticed one IP reviewer ended up with mushy ingredients using the suggested times.  I was really suspicious about the suggested times in this recipe. So I approximated based on another IP soup recipe I like. To cook, I used manual pressure or (pressure cook mode on my IP) set at 3 min. Then I allowed natural pressure release for (I suggest) 15min before I quick released. I actually allowed about 20min of natural release before quick releasing and I thought the veges were a little too mushy (I had one cut up potato in my soup, and I thought it was too soft, which is why I suggest 15 min of natural pressure release.). I definitely agree with another reviewer that a bay leaf or two would have helped the flavor. Perhaps I’ll try the paprika roux next time, as someone else suggested. I definitely did not use the vinegar or lemon juice since I knew I didn’t want sour soup. I might try again.

I love this recipe for a base soup. I add mixed veggies mushrooms and potatoes before pressure cooking then add chopped kale after depressurizing and let sit in pot for 10-15 minutes until kale is wilted and bright green. Thank you for the measurement amounts and cooking time info.

I am new to instant pot so it is more than likely my fault this came out so mushy! All of my veggies are super soft..I prefer a crunch. I would make this again but not in the instant pot

Made this a few times now and here are my adjustments: I add a bay leaf, 3 additional cloves of garlic, 1.5 cups of veggie broth (totaling the entire carton), and 1 tsp of paprika to the ingredients. Copying other IP recipes, I sauté a little vegetable oil with the garlic, onions, sage, and paprika to bring out the flavors. Afterwards, I add the other ingredients, cook for 15 min, and NPR in 10 minutes. Great recipe, my boyfriend asks for this one!

Not a chance in the world that my wife would like this!  She didn't stop until she had finished her second bowl.  It was that good!  Followed it pretty closely although I don't measure anything.  I did add the smoked paprika roux as suggested by others.  Not sure how much difference it made but I will probably add it again.

I made this and it turned out great! I added cayenne pepper as it speeds up the metabolism as well as gave it a kick. I don’t own a instant pot, so I used a stainless pot like others suggested.

I admit it, I made a slight modification to the recipe. This household likes spice so the canned diced tomatoes were changed to Rotel Diced Tomatoes with Green Chilies. Really liked the slight kick they added. 

The recipe was simple and relatively fast. Cooked in 15 minutes. Just took almost 30 more to come to pressure and release.  Not the recipe’s fault... just the world of IP cooking.

All in all, I’d certainly make this recipe again.

Made it on the stove top,  used water instead of broth and added more seasoning (paprika, oregano, basil, red pepper),  excellent recipe. I sometimes double the recipe  and use rotel diced tomatoes to give it a little more kick. Red / Orange bell peppers are good in it too.

The paprika addition from the first review took this recipe to another level that would have made it five stars. The leftovers were just as good if not better.

Overall very good although it was missing something. I added cumin and was a good addition. When I make it again, I will add 1tsp of cumin.

I didn't use the apple cider vinager because I didn't have any.
The soup was delicious.   I did add a few noodles, not too many.
I added a little Italian seasoning and some extra garlic.   
Very good.

I made, but not the vegan version.  I browned fresh ground pork on saute mode.  Then did everything exactly as it said in the recipe.  Since it's just my husband and I, I figured I would have enough left to package up and freeze.  It didn't last that long!  Plan on making it again.

I will definitely make this again.  My husband and I had more than enough for the two of us so we shared with our neighbour  who was having a meatless Monday.  We loved it and so did they.  We followed the recipe except we added a large can of cannellini beans, a large can of tomatoes and used chicken broth. Another time we will add cooked bratwurst at the end. We served it with fresh tea biscuits. Quick, easy, nutricious,  and delicious.

Really wanted to like it but it's so unbelievably bitter!! I tried to salvage it with 2T sugar and a little salt but pretty bad and it was giving me heartburn. I'll see if it happens to taste any better today but if not, it's getting dumped.

I love cabbage and my family and husband are from the east European region.  I was thrilled with Tome  and his roux of paprika and veg. oil.  What a great addition.  Made the soup extra special and far tastier.  Sometimes I cut up hots and throw them in when I want a more substantial meal.  Yum!

I made no changes and would not make it again. I think the cider vinegar and lemon juice ruined it for me. I tried to add a tablespoon of sugar and that really didn't help. I'm going to see if any neighbors want it..

I will certainly make this again.   Doubled the recipe, and followed Tome T's  suggestion for adding the paprika roux.
Since I made so much, I split the soup and added some sliced smoked sausage  to one half for my husband.  With a side of garlic or dark bread, this makes a hearty meal.  Made in just a regular stock pot, and let it simmer for an hour or so.
Even better the next day!

I was skeptical at first really very little spices... but I always follow a recipe the first time and did... it was absolutely delish. .. would not change a thing. Both my husband and I loved it... so easy. I used my Ninja Foodie worked perfectly. I did add some Parm cheese for finish.

I made this all last winter and my children loved it as did I. The only change I made was to do 2 cups green cabbage and 1 cup purple cabbage and I also added 2 cups of diced potatoes. I know this takes the detox out of it but the soup was great.

This the same recipe my mom used when she was dieting. We would have it for out lunches. This is when I was 17 and am now 68. I always hated vegetable soup. But this I have to say was great. It would be fantastic even when not dieting. It is excellent.

Got this recipe a year ago when  looking for instant pot recipes. Loved it first try...only change was using chicken broth. But since I love paprika as a flavoring (and I only use Hungarian paprika....mostly half-hard...) it brought this to a fabulous level of flavor! Thank you for that wonderful upgrade.

Rarely use the pressure cooker. Always surprised by the results. I want to add some pre-cooked pork sausage next time. This is a really tasty recipe for a primarily healthy benefits goal recipe.

I used a regular pot to cook this soup. Also, I roasted some of the veggies before I added them to soup,along with adding mushrooms (roasted),marjoram,and some  zucchini,cauliflower and kale,(I like a lot of veggies). I increased the cooking time until all was tender. Another addition was a good squeeze of lemon juice and a dash of hot sauce. Yum!

Super easy and delicious, also liked the addition of the paprika roux suggested and sometimes we add ground turkey or sausage or beans to make it a bit heavier.  Very versatile and tasty as it is for a detox meal!

Not a huge cabbage fan, but my husband asked me to make cabbage soup.  I found this recipe and I took a few of the suggestions from the reviews.  First  I added cannellili beans and I sautéed all the veggies including the garlic & onion.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients/seasonings. (also I did not have vegetable broth, so substituted chicken broth)   I used a stainless stock pot since we don't own a pressure cooker.  When it was done I thought it was good, nothing special but once it sat overnight in the fridge it was great!!!

I added sriracha (about 2tbsp) to make it spicy. I did not include onion, forgot. I added more celery. The diced tomatoes w/canned juice adds a delicious touch. I highly recommend keeping that ingredient, even if you don't like tomatoes. Just buy the small diced ones in a can.

Quick and easy soup to make.  Didn't taste bad but I like cabbage, I think that is key for the soup. I didn't measure my cabbage just used a small head and the juice of a small lemon. I also subbed poultry seasoning for sage. I was out of sage.

This soup was delicious. I used chicken broth as I didn’t have vegetable broth. I cooked it on the stove by simmering about 4 hours. Next time I will only put in one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and more onion.   I will definitely make this again.

I don't have an Instant Pot, so like other reviewers, I cooked it on the stove top. I first sauteed the vegetables for about 10 min. then added the remaining ingredients. Let it light boil for about 15 min, then turned down heat and let simmer for 1 1/2 hrs. I didn't have vegetable stock so went with chicken broth (I'm not detoxing or vegan). Although it was good, I found it a little tart. I would cut down on the apple cider vinegar and lemon juice, and maybe add a little brown sugar.

This was easy and delish!  Made it for health, not detox.  Used chicken broth I had in freezer and substituted squash for the carrots as I had that in the freezer, too.  Left out vinegar and lemon juice and used bay leaf rather than sage.  Thought about adding black beans for protein but not this time.  Very easy and healthy!

Cooked the recipe as-is, and I thought it was fairly bland (as I kind of expected though). Without any meat or oil added it wasn’t filling either.

Simple and very tasty.
I was surprised the vinegar was not too strong, but it really wasn't.  Makes a wonderful, light meal.

This cooked perfectly in the Instant Pot. I was not a big fan of how sour the soup was. We had to add some red pepper and hot sauce to offset the sour taste. Also, I added some white kidney beans and (non-vegan) smoked sausage to make it heartier for my husband's lunch.

I added more cabbage and fire roasted diced tomatoes as well as the Juice from the leftover pico de gallo I had to give it a little spice. Plus some ground pepper flakes, about a teaspoon to add some flavor. Cooking it in the pressure cooker kept the vegetables and the cabbage at the right tenderness without getting the carrots or the Cabbage to come out mushy. Great recipe!

Do you only eat this soup for 3 days?  There are no instructions on how to detox.  I doubled the recipe, so that my husband and I could both detox, but am not sure how much to use per serving or how often.   Does it nullify the detox if you season with salt and pepper?

Delicious and easy to make! I used 8 cups of vegetable broth, half a head of cabbage, a pound of carrots, 10 stalks of celery, and a whole medium sized onion. I also used  a fresh tomato instead of canned. I also added in some thyme and a bay leaf while cooking. I cooked on the stovetop and boiled for about 20 minutes and then simmered for about 90 minutes. Great and cozy way to eat healthy in the winter! Will for sure make again!

Easy and customizable. I added a can of white beans and used  frozen carrot coins (lazy, but convenient!) and upped the vinegar a bit because I like it. Makes a big batch of soup in a short amount of untended time. Winner!

I boiled it about an hour and a half instead of putting it in a pressure cooker. I added parsley and used crushed tomatoes and it turned out amazing! You could add  salt, but you don't have to but I like salt. I can't wait to make it again and next time I think I'll try chicken bone broth instead of Veggie broth.

I have made this soup many times. I make it because  I like the flavor and it's filling.  I don't have an instant pot. I do have a pressure cooker I haven't cooked  the soup in it . Instead I use it to can the soup. I like so well, O don't want to run out. 
   Very good soup!

I do not have a modern pressure cooker, mine was probably made in the 1930's. In mine, place all ingredients in pot & lock the lid. Place on med.-high heat & wait for steam to come out of the stem. Place the weight (regulator) on stem & follow recipe directions.
For those that do not know, the "natural-release method" is taking cooker off heat & let the cooker depressurize on its own. 
To cook in Dutch Oven, on a low simmer, (with lid on) simmer until vegetables are tender.
I reduced the amount  of sage to 1 teaspoon.

I am not vegan, so I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Actually my husband and I made this for many years when we wanted to lose  a few pounds. I also added green beans to mine. And for those of you who don't have a pressure cooker, just let it simmer in the slow cooker or on the stove top until the vegetables are tender.

I made this, which is great especially in cold weather. Though, I made it for the infamous cabbage soup detox where you jugged unsweetened maple syrup/water and cayenne pepper. I did great, thinking, this is easy-peasy until day 3 and 9 bowls of cabbage soup. Personally, I haven't ate cabbage since.. I just overdid it for myself,  P.S. I did not use a pressure cooker
