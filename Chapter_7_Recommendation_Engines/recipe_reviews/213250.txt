Delicious and hearty!  I skipped the cream cheese and locatella cheese, as I had never heard of this one, subbing for it asiago and adding a little more parmesan.  Didn't do the roasted red peppers, but won't be skipping them next time as they probably would have added a great dimension.

The most time consuming, expensive, and disastrous recipe I have ever made in 50 years of cooking.  Way too much barley, recipe did not state whether to put the sauteed veggies into the casserole or not.  I put them  at the bottom  of the casserole and the creamed cheese mixture on  top.  My husband rated this a 4 out of 10.  He does not want any  more.  I have broken it into several pieces and placed in freezer bags.  Will add to my homemade soups a bit at a time.  The recipe ingredients looked so enticing.  What a dissappointment.  Used all the ingredients called for and followed the recipe.  My adivce is not to bother.

This 'recipe' is more of a cooking challenge than I have recently seen.  If I saw a cook book with the title "Meals with 28 Ingredients", I would not likely buy it.  Chicken and Barley blends and soups are usually wonderful but I won't try this one.  Thanks anyway for the effort.

Great recipe, but way too much prep for me.  I will cut down the veggies next time and just add whatever I have on hand or some frozen mixed veggies.

I didn't have mushrooms, zucchini and cream of chicke soup, or the roasted red pepper so I doubled the sour cream and added monterey jack cheese.  I also added chopped sundried tomatoes packed in oil.  I think this made the dish.  It is a great way to get in a lot of veggies.

Absolutely adore all the veggies in this dish!  Planning to experiment with seasonings and cheeses other than Italian next time.  Omitted barley and green beans.  Didn't saute veggies, garlic and onion before baking, and was glad I didn't.  Locatelli cheese is Romano cheese and can be purchased in plastic shaker form just like Parmesan cheese.

Thank you for this recipe! I love the use of multi veggies. If 28 ingredients is too many for some, they may just want to avoid it altogether but there is no need for them to rain on our hard-work ethic parade. If they want a quickie meal, they should grab a frozen, sodium-laden meal and avoid this recipe. Thanks again!

This had entirely too much garlic ... so much that it was "spicy hot".  Without that over-powering garlic, it really had no flavor.  Will NOT make this again.  Hate that I wasted so much time and money on it.
