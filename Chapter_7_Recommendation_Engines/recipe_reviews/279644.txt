I've been making meatless meatballs for years!  Instead of homemade breadcrumbs, I use Pepperidge Farms stuffing mix.  I place mine in a baking dish, spoon on the sauce and bake at 350* for 30 minutes.  We love 'em!

These are so good. The family loved them. The only change I made was to bake them in the sauce. I had other things going on the stove top and needed the space. I placed the cheese balls and sauce in a 2 qt. casserole dish and baked covered for 1 hour @ 350 degrees. Delicious!

I didnâ€™t have the pecorino cheese. Used Gouda and rather Parmesan.  Used more minced garlic.  My husband and I thought they were a bit bland.  Better two nights later as leftovers.  So I would recommend leaving them in your sauce, in the fridge for a day or two.  Otherwise, a real treat!
