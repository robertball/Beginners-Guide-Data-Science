I made this tonight for my family, and we all really liked it.  For those that said this dish is bland, you really need to put in all the spices that it calls for.  I went heavy on the garlic, and I used the entire packet of onion soup mix (by accident).  It didn't hurt the flavor at all (just gave us more sodium than we needed!)...oh well.  I used cream/chicken soup instead of mushroom, just because we prefer it.  I also threw in a couple dollops of sour cream and a splash of half & half, just because.  This dish was VERY tasty, and I will make it again.

The flavor was good; but I wouldn't call it "alfredoy". Instead of using 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup water, I used all milk. I also only used 1 Tbsp of italian seasoning. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. One thing I would suggest is to add and mix in the italian seasoning with the soup mixture before adding it to the chicken because otherwise all the seasoning sticks to the chicken and we didn't like that. Good-tasting recipe overall though.

This was not as fast as the recipe said, but really great!  I have family members with lactose problems - but they love alfredo.  This is a super substitue and we'll make it again!  Thanks Kim.

This was a very quick and easy recipe to make. We loved the taste, very different than the alfredo sauces I am used to.

I love this recipe! I just usually use half and half instead of milk and omit the water. It makes a very thick and creamy sauce. I have found that it thickens quickly so when I make the sauce i turn the burner on low and then I just keep adding half and half to thin out the sauce. Great recipe!

Hmmmm. This was just OK for me. If I make it again, I would use much less Italian seasoning, exchange chopped onions for the onion soup mix, and add more parmesan. I'll probably stick to a more traditional chicken parmesan recipe though. This just tasted a little "packaged".

Pretty non-spectacular but not horrible at all. I made it all as written and wasn't too happy with it, it was a tad bland. Added some lemon juice and red pepper flakes and it perked it right up. It works when you're in a time pinch.

This is not really Chicken Alfredo. The mushroom and onion soup mix is the same thing I use for pot roast. If you just want a good chicken casserole, call it something else and give it a try. It makes a fine meal. Fast, tasty and easy to customize to your own tastes. I like using legs and thighs on the bone, which requires a longer cook time, and I substituted 1 Tbsp of garlic powder instead of 3 cloves (to prevent burnt garlic) mixed in with the Italian seasoning. Came out really good.

Thanks for the great recipe! I also made some changes though....swtiched to Cream of Chicken soup, left out the water and used a whole cup of Smart Balance, Lactose Free, Fat Free with Omega 3's milk. Yummy!

Everyone seem to enjoy this recipe. I just did a few adjustments... I added 1/2 of a chopped onions with the garlic, used 1/2 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, no water just 1 cup of milk, doubled the parmesan cheese and also added a cup of white cheddar cheese. I also used mini penne pasta. I think next time I will use fresh herbs and lower sodium soup.

I am sorry, but we did not like this at all. We ate a little and threw the rest out. For the time it took, I could have made the wonderfull "Cajun Seafood Pasta" recipe. Maybe because it had soup in it and we are not a big fan of recipes with soup mixes and canned. More into all fresh  ingredients. Will not be making again.

I doubled the grated Parmesan cheese, substituted milk for water, used cream of chicken soup, and broccoli instead of peas. It was a quick and easy Alfredo recipe. The family enjoyed it but I wasn't to keen on the onion soup mix.

This was pretty good very quick and easy to make. Husband said well it tastes better than it looks! lol My kids also thought it was ok. I did makes some adjustments i used small penne pasta and i added a touch of crushed chilli.After frying the chicken i deglazed the pan with a couple of slashes of sherry and chicken stock that did definitely darken the colour of the sauce! But i would make it again!

I used leftover turkey and half and half cream instead of the milk and water.  Out of 5 people only two said it was good.  We found it very plain, it was ok but I won't be making it again.

I've searched for 2-3 years to find a suitable spaghetti sauce that wasn't tomato-based. I think I've found it. I substitued one pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs; cream of chicken soup; fat-free half-n-half; fancy shredded parmesan; and spaghetti noodles. I omitted the peas (not popular at my house). Next time I will use less Italian seasoning. Rich taste without all the calories. I would not be afraid to use a different meat, either.

I thought this was a very good meal.  I exchanged the higher fat ingrediants with fat free or low fat and it turned out wonderful.  My picky kids (10 and 6) even liked it.

Not a bad meal at all, but this didn't taste anything like chicken alfredo. It was worth the shot becasue it was quick and easy to put together. Thanks!

Pretty good, but I would go a little lighter on the mixture of onion soup mix with the mushroom soup.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS REALLY GOOD. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAD WAS I THOUGHT THE SAUCE WAS A LITTLE THIN AND I HAD TO THICKEN IT UP...BUT OTHER THAN THAT, VERY TASTY.
