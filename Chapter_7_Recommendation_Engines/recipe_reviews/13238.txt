I'm Italian and let me tell you this is a fabulous Pasta Fagioli recipe.  It is so easy and very tasty.  I made the following modifications as per some of the other ratings and it came out perfect.  Garlic increased from 3 to 4 cloves, used only 1 can of tomatoes (use crushed instead of stewed), increased broth to 4 cups, used 1/8 cup fresh chopped basil instead of dried, incrased pasta to 7 oz, added red pepper flakes for a little spice and topped it off with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  AWESOME.

This was actually really delicious.  It's ridiculously easy, which I thought was kind of funny - I was a little embarrassed how much work I didn't do and how well it turned out!  :o)  Only thing I did differently was use dried parsley and great northern beans rather than cannelini.  Also added another shake of dried basil and a little salt at the end.  Perfect!
*Update 2/15/08: I have made this countless times now and we love it.  I always use dried parsley rather than fresh now because it actually tastes better that way to us.  One of the best & probably under-rated recipes on this site!

I was looking for a simple pasta e fagioli recipe like my Italian boss makes and I've found it!  I doubled the recipe, except for the tomatoes, and used 2 cans of Italian diced tomatoes instead of stewed, like others suggested.  I drained and rinced my cannellini beans (I can't stand that "grit").  Also, I cooked dilatini pasta separately (in chicken stock) and added to each bowl, like my boss does, so it wouldn't get mushy...very yummy!!

This soup is delicious. I usually add some celery and carrot in with the garlic and onion if I have it. Also, I like to double this recipe and freeze half, in which case I'll take out the half I'm going to freeze before adding the pasta. Otherwise the pasta gets too mushy. Then just add the pasta in when you thaw and reheat it.

I made this last week for a quick late night dinner.  My dad always made Pasta e Fagioli when I was a kid, but he makes his with ground beef and I never really cared much for ground beef (sorry dad)!  This recipe was easy and tasted delicious!  I used ditalini and boiled it seperately from the rest of the soup and added it when it was still al dente.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes.  This soup is really perfect to use up some of your leftover tomato sauce.. just add the chicken stock   and the pasta and beans and you're good to go!  This is truly comfort food for me and I recommend trying this!  I will definitely be making this again!

Easy to make soup with great flavor. I used Italian style diced tomatoes instead of the Stewed because the smaller pieces are easier to eat than the larger chunks that you get with the stewed tomatoes.

Instead of 1 cup of onion, I used 1 medium onion. Also, added 2 carrots & 1 celery stalk chopped. Substituted stew tomatoes with canned diced tomatoes and precooked the pasta. Put in some diced ham,too. Great taste.

I have made this soup before, but I didnt find the recipe here, however it is almost exactly the same.  To make this a one dish meal, cook 1 lb of lean ground turkey in with the onion and garlic.  I also use 2 cans of cannellini beans.  To the herbs and spices, I add 1 tsp. of chopped fennel seeds.  It is a perfect dinner on a cold night.  I probably make this once every 2 weeks during the winter.

Excellent dish! I'm devouring a bowl as I write this. I'm sure it will taste even better tomorrow. Thanks to many helpful posts, here are my substitutions/changes: I added 1 lb. browned/drained ground beef (85/15%); substituted diced tom. and 2 tbsp. dried parsley; added a few shakes of salt; chopped 4-5 cloves of garlic (I just learned that chopping garlic helps it not to burn when cooked with onions); and used ditalini pasta because that's what my grandmother always uses in her soups. I love this dish and will be enjoying it for a few days! Also, I completely agree with many posts...don't add the pasta until you plate the meal.

This is a wonderful recipe, I make it at least once every winter! I also add either Italian or smoked sausage and brown it with the onion and garlic. I am not a huge fan of stewed tomatoes, so sometimes I replace them with diced tomatoes (Italian style)...either way is fine. One tip I've learned, if you're planning on having leftovers, definitely do not overcook your pasta! It will absorb a lot of the broth in the fridge, and will be way too soggy and mushy.

I'll gave it 4 stars because I made three changes, but this soup is delicious! I used 2 cans of beans and one can on diced tomatoes that i blended for a few seconds so they were smooth. (I don't like tomato chunks in soup). I also used 3 cups of water and one Vegan No Salt Added Vegetable boullion cube. Later I could taste and control the salt myself. I cooked the pasta separately (I have used Ditalini or small shells) while I simmered the soup covered for 10 minutes and then with the cover half off for 10 minutes. My apartment smelled great and my hubby who hates soup loved it. I put several ladels-full into the blender and blended, then put it back in the soup. Tasty, hearty, filling. As a vegetarian, I love this delicious protein filled soup! Makes enough for lunch the next day. Will make often! Thanks for a great recipe!

This soup was very easy and tasted great.   I made a few changes, mostly based on what I had in the cabinet.  I used one 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of two cans of stewed tomatoes; dried parsley instead of fresh; regular chicken broth; and dilatini pasta.  Even with the minor adjustments, it's still a great soup.  I'd make this again.

This is an excellent soup and easy to make.  The only problem I had was it didn't make enough.  I'd double it next time.

I tried the recipe as is but found the flavour to be pretty bland. After reading through other ratings I made the following changes:  
Subbed the stewed tomatoes with puréed.  Added about about another cup of broth.  Added 1/2 cup chopped carrots and 1/2 cup chopped celery.  I also made the pasta separately and added to each bowl then poured the soup over it. I find the pasta tends to absorb a lot of the liquid if you add it to the pot.

This was too tomato-y for what I would expect from pasta fagioli - it was more like a minestrone. Next time I'll omit a can of tomatoes and add another can of beans. Maybe add some sausage too.

This was wonderful.   It reminded me of the soup my Mom used to make when I was a kid.   I didn't make any changes at all and it turned out great.   After putting in your serving bowl, top with some parmesan cheese, a salad and some wonderful rolls and you have a great meal.

The flavor of the dish was very yummy. Unfortunately, I didn't have canned beans, so I used dried.  Even after soaking for 24 hours and cooking for over one hour, the beans were still pretty crunchy.  Not good.  I strongly recommend using only canned beans-unless you have a pressure cooker and know how to use it.  Next time I will do that and it will be very good!  This is a good recipe if you are on a low fat, low sodium diet.  I used homemade chick broth from this site, and low sodium tomatoes to further reduce the sodium.

This was very good. I did make a few small changes. I omitted the olive oil and water fried the onion and garlic. I used one pint bottle of home bottled tomatoes from my garden. I used 2 cups of peruano beans that I already had in my refrigerator. I omitted the pepper (I don't care for it.) and used dried parsley. The next time I make it, I will add more beans. (I LOVE beans!)

I substituted a 28-oz can of Cento All-in-One Crushed Tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes, and used Ditalini pasta instead of shells.

This recipe is so easy, so inexpensive, and so yummy.  I served it with garlic breadsticks that I made out of leftover hot dog buns & the whole family ate it up!  I garnished it with a little grated Romano that I had.  I also used ditalini pasta instead of seashell pasta, because that's what was in all the photos and is the kind of pasta I normally see this soup made with.  I served it for lunch and my husband asked me if I could make a double batch to have for dinner on the same day!

Love this one, Pasta Fagioli has always been my comfort food and with this easy recipe I can make it any time. I used wacky pasta instead of the shells. This soup was originally created to use up extra ingredients in an Italian kitchen so it would have many types of pasta in it. I have also had it with Italian sausage

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe.  It was good, but next time, I will double the beans to two cans, and only use about one cup of pasta.  I used about a cup and a fourth, and I think it was too much. I would also use diced tomatoes instead of stewed, because the chunks were too big.  I ended up cutting them up before I added them.  The soup seemed very watery at first, but it thickened after a while.  My pasta (ditalini) also had to cook for more than 10 minutes.  It was about 15 before it tasted al dente.  Everyone enjoyed it, and I'm going to make it again, but with the above changes.

I followed this recipe to a T and loved it.  The only problem I had with it was that by the time dinner was over, the remaining pot of soup was all dried up as the pasta had absorbed all of the liquid.  We added more broth and enjoyed the soup again the next night, delicious!

What an excllent soup.  I like it because it stays true to the
original "rustic" character of pasta e. fagioli in that it does not
add a lot of extraneous ingredients (meat, carrots, etc.).  It is
also very simple and quick to make.   I use garbanzo beans
instead of cannellini beans because I can never find the latter
at the store.  I've made this three times now and it gets better
every time.   I highly recommend it.

This recipe was great!  Just enough for two, I would double if I had guests.  I actually added crushed red peppers to the ingredient list and it was GREAT!  If you like a little zing, go for the red pepper, otherwise this is great as is! Thanks!

I grew up with this soup... love it.  The only change I make is when I'm sweating my onions and garlic I add a pinch of red pepper for a little heat.  This soup is so versatile sometimes I add sausage, carrots and celery sometimes not.. a great basic soup. The last time I made it, I took some to my work and now I get hounded to make it all the time..

This is  the hubby's favorite soup; the entire family even my picky one wanted seconds! I stole a few tips......     
use diced and/or crushed tomatoes,extra clove garlic, 2 cans chic broth, 4 tsp dried parsley,added 2 stalks of celery and 1 carrot.......could of used more pasta maybe 7 oz also could've used extra beans
cooked ditalini pasta separately and served by itself in a bowl then added soup.
Hubby said it was a keeper!

Love it!  The only major change I made was to add spinach, because Carrabba's makes theirs with spinach in it, if I recall correctly.  I just added the spinach in with the onions when they were cooking, and it worked great.  I tweaked the spices a little to taste.  I think I might try diced tomatoes in the future, as stewed tomatoes are too big of pieces and I have to break them up before or while eating.  Wonderful recipe though, so easy, cheap, *and* delicious!

Yum. I was glad to find this recipe since it didn't have a lot of extra's in it. My grandmother always made this very simply. I did use crushed tomatoes instead of stewed because I didn't want the chucks of tomatoes in the soup. Also I didn't really measure the broth just poured it in until it looked right. And I didn't have any shell pasta so I used elbow. Thanks for the recipe.

My family really enjoys this soup.  I have modified in the following manner:  I use crushed tomatoes instead of stewed.  I also add frozen chopped spinach instead of the parsley.  Before adding the pasta [I use ditalini] I use an immersion blender to blend the beans so the soup is a little thicker.  Add a salad,crusty French bread, and top with a little shredded Parm, and we're all set!

Very easy and very tasty.  The only thing I did differently was adding some leftover prosciutto that I'd lightly fried and I used crushed tomatoes that I had on hand.  Flavor is just great and plenty of leftovers for the 2 of us for hearty lunches.

I really liked the flavors of this soup.  I did add a pound of groung sausage (simply because we like meat) and used Northern beans because it's what I had.  I would have given this five stars, but when I went to get a bowl for lunch all the liquid had been absorbed.  It still tasted great, but I was looking forward to soup.  Next time I will add an extra can of broth since I only had two on hand.

I made this on Sunday after a very cold and rainy weekend.  It was delicious but I did make a few changes/additions which made it even better.  I added carrots, zuchinni and yellow squash since I had them on hand and I wanted to add some more veggies to this.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and used fresh basil instead of dry.  I topped it with some grated parmesean cheese.  I would have loved some foccacia bread with it but didn't have the time to make it.  It was really quite delicious and perfect for the miserable weather we had!

Excellent soup! I just made a couple small changes- I added 3 hot turkey sausage links (removed casing and crumbled and cooked meat before adding to soup) and zucchini. I also used dried parsley and red pepper flakes because I like some spice. I didn't add pasta, but sure it would be great with that too. Top with parm cheese. Thanks for an easy, very satisfying recipe.

WOW, this was amazingly good and easy.  I used 2 cans cannellini beans insted of one, fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden, and some zucchini which would have otherwise gone bad.  It was delicious.  Next time I'll try it with spinach instead of zucchini.

My daughter loves this recipe and always order this soup from Olive Garden and this recipe is almost as good.  She gave me a thumbs up.  Very easy to cook and the ingredients are so simple in fact I have them all in my pantry.  I did added celery and carrots to give more veggie and used 1 28 oz of whole peeled tomatoes and just smoosh it to get the juice more since that's what I have and it turned very well.  My daughter had 3 bowl and she normally eat like a bird.  This is a keeper..Thanks for posting this delicious pasta e fagioli...

This was amazing. I didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand and we needed something for dinner so I just whipped this up in no time and it was delicious! Everyone loved it. Some homemade bread really put the finishing touch on this! Will make again.

Yummy! I did as the others suggested and used two cans of Italian diced tomatoes, but that was the only thing I did differently. Very, very good! I will most definatly be making this again! Thanks so much!

Ridiculously easy.  Added carrots and celery.  I prefer a smoother soup so I'd probably blend the vegetables next time.  Will definitely making this again.

Really good, really easy.  I doubled the base recipe and used 1 pound of pasta.  it thickened up nicely and the pasta absorbed most of the liquid so it was less of a soup and more of a sauce.  I added salt and topped with parmesan cheese as well.  This tasted really good for using so many canned ingredients!

i made this tonight for dinner. i made a couple substitutions though: 

1.) i used egg noodles because that is what i had on hand 
2.) for the 2 cans of stewed tomatoes i used a can of petite diced 
tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano. 
3.) i added a can of kidney beans in addition to the white beans. i 
also added celery; about 3 stalks chopped. 
4.) i used fat free chicken broth. 

It was delicious and filling! Reminded me of the olive garden. i served it with some garlic artisan bread topped with swiss cheese! yummy!!!

Super and filling soup.  I added about 1/2-3/4 lb of mild italian sausage and  I used a tbs of italian seasoning instead of  basil leaves.  Also had macaroni on hand instead of shells....wow, what a combo.   Thank you for this post, we will keep it for life!

I have never made this before.  But it was easy and good.  I think it is a good base.  Maybe add some meat, some veggies and some kidney beans and it would be a 5 star

So easy and good! I used 2 cans (undrained) Italian diced tomatoes instead of the plain, added garlic salt to taste, and used less pepper. Also used jumbo shells instead of the small ones and it was a hit!

This is a fantastic soup!  It definitely does not serve 8 if you're serving as the main course.  I added diced carrots, red pepper, green onions and used 2 cans diced tomatoes.   I also substituted vegetable stock.

I'm giving this 4 stars as my husband enjoyed it but it seemed a little too tomatoey to me.  Maybe I'd like it better with only one can of stewed tomatoes & maybe an extra can of chicken broth.  Anyway, I had a little problem with the stewed tomatoes.  I bought a brand name (not just the store generic kind) & the chunks were huge.  They didn't break down in the cooking process, even though I simmered it longer than the recipe said.  I finally took a colander & put it over a large Corningware pot, drained the soup, picked out the stewed tomato chunks, chopped them up, & then put them back in the soup.  For the reviewer who was asking about the cannellini beans, I found a can that said they were white kidney beans.

This was great!  I did make a number of changes.  I used diced tomatoes with onion, garlic and basil and two 14.5 oz. cans of chicken broth.  In addition to the onion, I added a cup each of diced carrot and celery.  I rinsed and drained my cannellini beans and used dried parsley instead of fresh.  I also cut back just a bit (to 3 oz.) on the pasta.  This is a nicely flavored soup that’s relatively low in calories, but still quite filling.  My version yielded nine cups of soup.

Delicious. I used a full quart of chicken broth, diced tomatoes (undrained), 2 cans of beans (drained, but not rinsed), and less pasta, but used the seasonings called for (a touch more of each). The chicken broth and one of the cans of beans were both no-salt-added, so I did feel the need to add some salt to the soup. I let it simmer longer (about an hour) just because I wasn't ready to eat yet, and the flavours came together great. And of course I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top just before eating. Thanks for the recipe.

a very easy, simple but delicious soup. my family and i thank-you! i never change a thing to the recipe except for the pasta selection. i usually use mini stars, or mini bow ties. always cook the pasta separate and add to your bowl...never to the soup.

What a quick and easy recipe, proving that the best things in life are simple. Any small pasta will work - I used orzo and substituted navy beans, added diced celery, and a good dash of cayenne. A superb and hearty vegetarian recipe!

After making a few adjustments we loved this.  1) The stewed tomatoes I had were very large, so I took my immersion blender to it, and then diced up a few other tomatoes. 2) Added an extra clove of garlic.  Next time I think I'll add 2. 3) Drained and rinsed the beans.  I find the slimy juice they're in disgusting, not to mention very high in sodium and more likely to cause gas. 4) After tasting it and finding it a little bland I added red pepper flakes, oregano, more basil (this would be so much better with fresh basil) and some Mrs Dash italian seasoning blend.  5) Sprinkled grated Parmesan cheese on top before serving.  Husband said the smells from the kitchen were driving him crazy, and he went back for seconds.

LOVE this soup!  Definitely my go-to lunch for work.  I added a bit of red pepper flake to give it some heat.  Next time, I think I'll use  diced tomatoes, so they're more bite-sized.  Also, I think I'll use two cans of beans.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy & tasty!    I used canned pork & beans instead of the cannellini.    A great recipe that could be customized depending on what you have in your cupboard and by adding some additional vegetables, but also as is it is very flavorful!  Love it - thanks!

My husband and I love this soup! It goes together very easily, and tastes like you've been working on it all day! I always add a little more liquid than the recipe calls for; in leftovers the pasta seems to absorb quite a bit of the "juice." Try using canned tomatoes with "extras" in them, like diced tomatoes with onion and celery, for even more flavor. Some folks might want to add a bit of sea or kosher salt if you use the low-sodium broth.

This recipe is the great as is, but have tinkered a bit several times just to adjust a litte for personal taste. Used 2 tablespoons butter instead of oil; 1/2 box of dilatini pasta because seashells or larger pasta overwhelm the dish; 4 cloves minced garlic; only one can diced tomatoes, but in garlic/onion sauce;

This soup was fantastic!!! Even though I usually don't make changes with recipes, i did change some things to this soup. I  added chopped carrots with the onion.I added only one can of diced tomatoes (instead of the 2 cans of stewed tomatoes), drained the beans, added 2 cans of chicken broth, one 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and added diced ham. I also cooked the pasta separately then added in before serving. Toped with parm....delicious!!

I give it 4 stars because this soup was really yummy as far as the broth was concerned.  At first I found it a little too tomato-y so I cut it with a couple more cups of broth.  Everything else I kept the same except that I used dried parsely instead of fresh.  It did seem to be lacking something though.  I haven't had pasta e fagioli in many many years so I'm not sure what.  I was thinking some sort of meat and some extra veggies would have been great.  My 4 and 3 year olds liked it and the 3 year old had seconds so it will be a keeper.  Very economical too.  Good recipe.

I really enjoyed this soup, it was quite easy and delicious.  It was very filling with the amount of beans, next time I would probably use less.  I have just started cooking recently and everyone thought that I was a pro!

What a superb recipe, & even better the next day. I  substituted Rotel tomatoes ('mild' variety) because it was all we had on hand. The Rotel chilis added a distinctily un-Italian flavor, & my family loved it but, having eaten some great Pasta e Fagioli throughout Italy, I know that following this recipe pretty much as-is will be even better; except of course for adjusting the amount of beans & pasta for individual preference -- I did reduce the tomatoes and increase the beans. Thanks very much, Corwynn.

Hearty, healthy, and very satisfying! This is the second time I've made this soup and this time I added broccoli. It was more colorful, more nutritious, and more delicious. I'm a vegetarian so I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also added some italian seasoning for  more bang. Try it with some fresh grated parmesan cheese...you'll love it.

Yum!!! Wonderful and yet oh so easy.  I made a few minor changes, but for personal reasons, not because I thought the recipe needed improvement.  I cut back the oil to 1 tablespoon, used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian and tossed in some spinach, it just made it look so pretty. I also squished the stewed tomatoes, to make the peices smaller. I have enough soup for a weeks worth of lunches.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Amazing, a wholesome, healthy meat free option and the kids love it! Who could ask for more? The only things I added were a 1/2 tsp salt and 2 tablespoons butter to a doubled recipe for a big family. Delicious.

Oooo yummy! This is full of flavor. I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth and substituted a can of spicy tomatoes for the plain ones. This is definitely a keeper.

This was very good and pretty authentic! My husband likes thicker soups so I added a small can of tomato paste. I think the beans are also a little light compared to how my Italian grandma used to make it so I will add two cans next time.

pretty tasty- added about a tablespoon of tomato paste some oregano .  Only made 4 servings.  Parsley did not really add much.  Will be a good colder weather meal.

I made this with rotini (as shown in the picture) instead of shells and my wife loved it.  She said it was even better the second day.

We loved this soup!  Very easy to throw together but tastes like it took hours.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed, & I used ditalini pasta since I had it on hand.  I also added a couple extra garlic cloves, diced zucchini, & fresh spinach.  I was trying to clean out the refrigerator!  I almost forgot.  I added about a teaspoon of Tutto Calabria crushed hot chili peppers for some zing!  So delicious and so filling with toasted garlic bread.  And I love that this recipe is so healthy.  Thanks Corwynn!

Followed the recipe as is. I save the rind from parmigiano reggiano cheese and cooked it in the soup. Amazing! Used dittalini for the pasta.

Turned out well. I took the advice from others and added extra garlic, 4 cups chicken broth and dried plus fresh basil. Next time I will add less tomatoes as I used crushed and one can would have been enough doing it this way.

I used it as a template and made substitutions based on similar items I had in my pantry.  It was very flavorful and filling!
No onion or garlic because I have to avoid them.
Mexican style stewed tomatoes
Spicy black beans instead of the cannellini beans
Added a can of  corn
Used 1T Better-then-Bullion Chicken Flavor with 3 c. water instead of broth
Dried parsley instead of fresh
Orrechiette pasta instead of shells

Sprinkled shredded cheese on top for added yumminess.

I try to always make a recipe exactly as it is written the first time, which I did with this.  I will make some adjustments next time, as it seemed a little too bland for my taste.  Not sure what addition I will make.  Perhaps some chopped spinach or a bit of shredded, roasted chicken, or both.

I made it as given with the two exceptions of adding Italian Sausage with a little more broth to compensate(we like meat in ours) and dried instead of fresh parsley.  Very good, very fast and I'll be making it frequently.

I went slow-cooker on this and added thin-sliced celery, carrot, one small 1/4" sliced zucchini, mushrooms, and a little Italian Sausage I had left-over, (browned along with the onions and garlic) adding the less-cooked sea-shells, mushrooms and zucchini at the last 1/2 hour of cooking. OMG, GREAT!

Pretty darn good with little effort. I subbed veggie broth for my in-house Vegetarian and it was perfect and hardy. Only used half an onion and fire roasted tomatoes since this is what I had on hand. Definitely a redo!

I love this soup.  It was easy to make.  If you have large pasta noodles, prepare to add more broth as the pasta soaks up the broth very quickly.

It was very tasty. I did tweek it to fit my family's taste buds. So no beans where in the sauce. But they absolutely loved it!

Loved it - the broth was amazing!!!  I just about doubled the pasta and added a little water to make it a heartier meal.

I usually make any recipe once with NO modifications but it just didn't seem like enough pasta so I added a few ounces more. Mistake. Don't do it. It's just too crowded, too stew-like. Good taste though.

This is an excellent recipe. I've made it several times, using white cannellini beans, great northern and navy beans as well at different times, whatever I have on hand, soaking them overnight first. It can also be made with canned beans. I make in the slow cooker as well as a Dutch oven and either way works well. Once I even cooked it outside in the cast iron Dutch over  a fire. It gets better, like most soups, stews and chilis if kept overnight. This is highly nutritious,  a true comfort food and with cheese, has all food groups covered. Superb  with crusty Italian bread or garlic bread.

I've made this recipe several times.  The stewed tomatoes are over whelming, so I used crushed tomatoes instead.  Big difference..  I add a tinge more pasta for filler.   The taste is fantastic, otherwise.

This turned out delicious! I decided to use 2 cans of beans to balance with the amount of tomatoes, and also used about 12oz of ditalini instead of shells. I will definitely make this again!

Very good, easy recipe for lent!  I used only 1 can of "crushed" tomatoes.  I think 2 cans of tomatoes would've been too much, which seems to be the consensus in the reviews.

The Flavor was really good. I followed some of the advice on here and added more liquid. Boy I'm glad I did because the original amount was not enough and was soaked up. I also threw in some italian chicken sausage. I didn't have fresh herbs so I just used the dried versions and it still came out great. my almost two year old ate it up.

Yummy and easy! Practically everything was already in my pantry. I did change it up a bit, I used star-shaped pasta (and guessed the amount...) and I threw in some Mexican hot sauce because it needed a kick. It worked out really well! In the future I would use diced tomatoes, stewed ones are pretty big. Probably should have used more beans, the cans at my store are different measurements by only a few ounces.

Cooked carrots & celery with onion and added a boullion cube to the broth. The soup was delicious and even better the next day when the macaroni had absorbed a lot of the broth. Will make again & again. Thank you Corwyne Darkholme! This is now a favorite recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  I added about 8 ounces of Italian sausage and an additional cup of chicken broth.  I used gluten free pasta,  so cooked that separately and added the pasta to each bowl before lading in the soup.  I will make this delicious soup again.

Was very tasty the way it is written, although I probably added more pasta shells than the recipe called for. Definitely a keeper and one I will make again. 10/10 would recommend.

My grandfather made this for me growing up and it's been very difficult to find a version that tasted like his and had a similar consistency.  Until now.  The only change that I made was I used ditalini pasta instead of shells.  It's great as is.  For those that like it a little thicker, let it sit for 5-10 minutes before serving.

I'm eating it right now and it is a lovely, delicious soup. I made it exactly as described except I used ditalini pasta (which is actually the pasta shape pictured in the photo).  Into my menu repertoire it goes. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I made it, modifying the recipe slightly- adding spinach and cooking the pasta slightly before adding, crushed tomatoes vs stewed. I'll try escarole next time.
Turned out really good, slightly thicker than expected.
Made it again with kale- even better than before.

Wow... just wow... what a recipe! The flavors were on point. I'm always on the look out for simple recipes that yield complex flavors and this one surpassed my expectations! I made it almost exactly the way it states except I added a chicken bullion, chopped my stewed tomatoes and only used one can (per other suggestions). My kids LOVED it and even asked for seconds. I cant wait to make this one again!

I made this soup tonite and made the changes that Kent from WA did.  I also added some browned ground turkey since I have to have a little meat.  Came out delicious!! I did shake some red pepper flakes in it ..  maybe a bit too much -- it has more Zing than I prefer.  Came out great though and I would definitely make it again!! :)

My daughter LOVES the pasta e fagioli at a local restaurant. So, I had to try to duplicate it. This recipe was a hit!! It was even better the next day! I did sweat some celery and carrots along with the onions in the beginning. I also only added 1/2 the stewed tomatoes and substituted diced tomatoes for the other 1/2 (because that's all I had). In the end, I ended up taking the large stewed tomatoes out with some liquid, puréed them, and added them back to the soup. It gave the broth a bit more body and we didn't have to eat big hunks of tomato. Next time I'll probably go with just diced tomatoes. I might add a few more beans as well. We had to sub elbows for dilatini, but it worked out great!

Yum! Even better the next day! I'm not a huge bean fan, and pasta fagioli usually is too bean-y for me, but this was just right. I used a 28oz can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the stewed. Next time I will use 1 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes, as there were a bit too many tomatoes - still delicious though! I increased the garlic to 4 cloves, added a bay leaf, added a few dashes of red pepper flakes, and let it simmer a little longer than called for. I also cooked the pasta separate so it wouldn't absorb the liquid and get mushy.

Made this as written in an attempt to get rid of some canned tomatoes and beans we had on hand, turns out we both liked it.  To give the basic recipe some flexibility, husband would have liked sausage in it but I would have liked more vegetables to make it like a minestrone.

This is was very easy and delicious! I agree that it was very tomatoey and added an extra cup of chicken broth. I also used crushed tomatoes instead of the the stewed tomatoes as suggested. I used 1/2 cup of small shells because I thought a 1/4 pound of pasta was a lot. You can always add more pasta later if you boil it separtely, which is what my Italians friends do. I added a sprinkle of garlic salt at the end for extra flavor. I like more veggies so I added chopped carrots and some baby spinach I had in the fridge.  It came out perfect! You can always adjust the taste of this and add or adjust the seasonings to suit your taste. Yummy!

I too cut the tomatoes in half and cooked the pasta separately.  I added carrot and ham.  I simmered for about 4 hours for the flavors to blend and cook off the acid in the tomatoes.  After 2 hours, I pureed1/2 the soup to thicken it up.  Topped with Romano & fresh minced parsley.

I perused a number of recipes and I liked the simplicity of this one. I made all the adjustments suggested by Chris from Kent, WA, except for herbs, I added the following: 1 tsp. dried of Italian seasoning, Basil, Oregano and 2 tsp. parsley. I also put the diced tomatoes (with garlic, onion, basil) in a food processor and minced (I don't like the chunks)and added mild Italian sausage. I used great northern beans plus small can of chick peas(didn't have cannellini beans). Fabulous!! Absolutely loved this soup!! I will use this recipe as my base and switch up beans, pasta, with or without for a changes in flavor.

Good recipe. Just a few "must" changes. It should be a ham-based dish, so I used a hambone in water as the broth. Also replaced stewed tomatoes with diced tomatoes. For what it's worth, authentic old world food is typically made from items you would find on an italian farm. Pork is king. And stewed tomatoes weren't invented back then. Lol

This dish was absolutely easy to make and rendered such a rich a savory taste. I made a few alterations as per other reviewers. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes,  slightly more than 1/4 of ditalini pasta, and added about a cup of celery and carrots. Also, I did keep the pasta seperate as I didn't want it to get soggy. It came out Superb!!

Awesome quick recipe!  Subbed Ditalini for sea shell pasta and added 2-3 extra cups of broth  and extra basil & garlic, as soup simmered down over time (lots of people over soup was on crock pot for hours).   Wonderful, healthy & quick...thanks Corwynn!

So good, so easy and even better the next day - definitely add pasta as it's being eaten otherwise it gets mushy and soaks up all the juice.  I did end up adding extra garlic, an extra can of tomatoes (Italian seasoned diced) along with an 8 oz can of Italian style tomato sauce; seasoned with additional freshly ground black pepper just before serving.

This recipe was very good, however i did modify the ingredients some by adding a stalk of chopped celery and two thinly sliced carrots.  Added these to the onion and garlic and cooked until tender. I also added 2 cans of beans, instead of just 1.  I think I would also add little more broth, 4 cups, next time. I added 1 lb ground beef as well.  I did not add the parsley as I did not have any but I did add a little Thyme and red pepper flakes.   All in all the family loved it!

Great tasting and easy to make. Used ingredients according to recipe except I used 2 cups of veggie broth instead of 1-1/2 cups. Also used a little more Ditalini...about a third of a pound instead of a quarter pound. Used the two cans of diced tomatoes...did not cut back as some suggested. I found it wasn't thick enough. 
One important note...let the soup cool a good hour. Even if you cook the pasta separately (which you should), it's going to get mushy if you add it to boiling hot soup!

Thank you Corwynn for another terrific recipe.  I have spread your Bachelor's Stew far and wide so I had to try this beautiful soup.  I was not disappointed.  I followed all as directed except I added another can of chicken broth as an accessory to the extra pasta I put in.  All was gobbled up with great gusto!

I've made this recipe many times now and find it very tasty.  Followed recipe exactly except for dried herbs and different pasta.  I think the stewed tomatoes add so much more flavor than plain old diced tomatoes.  I also sometimes add some diced pre-cooked sausage to make it heartier.

This was the best soup I have ever made. I made a few additions, I added a tablespoon of red crushed peppers and a teaspoon of knorr chicken bouillon. I didn't have the canellini beans so I used white beans instead and it turned out great!

I'm from Holland, lived in the States for 18 years and I add a sliced chorizo, to give it a nice zesty flavour.

Yummy!
Made as described but used diced instead of stewed tomatoes.  
Leftovers had absorbed most of the liguids so I mixed in cheese, reheated and then melted more cheese on top (turns into a casserole).

Not too bad.  I added ground beef so it would be a little more like Olive Garden's soup.  I really liked this soup but there was a spice missing and I still haven't figured out what.  I think I'll keep trying this until I figure out what's missing.

Only change I made was replacing the Cannellini for Northern Beans cause that's what I had on hand.  Good soup.

Very good!  Soup is  healthy, filling, and the serving is large. I used diced tomatoes with jalepenos, which gave it a little kick.

This was delicious, but I made only one change because I thought I had 2 cans of diced tomatoes, instead I only had 1, so I added 1/2 a can of crushed tomatoes. I'll make again for sure with the 2 cans of diced tomatoes! Thanx for sharing this recipe.

This tasted great but looked awful!  I changed around some of the quantities (more garlic, more chicken broth and didn't use the bean liquid, doubled the cannellini beans)and added carrot and celery.  Next time I'd use less pasta - I know the pasta is the point of the soup but it was too much for my taste.

Easy, quick, tasty, filling and economical meal. This is perfect for a busy mom who doesn't have much time to cook. We had this with garlic bread. Will make again, thank you for a terrific recipe.

I liked this recipe alot, I did modify it a bit though.  I used regular white beans instead and added cooked ground sirloin to make it closer to a popular chain restaurant's version.  It turned out great, husband and I both liked it alot.

Used great northern beans (drained them first).  Didn't use onions.  Used 2 extra cloves garlic.  Used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

This was just a little bit too "tomato-ey" for me.  It took a bit longer to cook the pasta than stated, but that's a minor matter.

can freeze ahead of time by: putting onion and oil in one bag, everything else except pasta in another bag, pasta in last bag, freeze.

Excellent recipe!

I had to adjust this a lot because the flavor was boring.  I added a little red wine and tomato paste along with additional spices which in the end was great.  I will not follow this recipe sorry.

Great soup! I added an extra can of beans and also some oregano, and to thicken it up a little I used a handheld blender for a bit before adding the pasta. I really like this soup!!
