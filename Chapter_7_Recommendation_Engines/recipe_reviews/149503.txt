I liked this - it's SO rich and creamy!  But is was a little lacklustre for me as is.  It needed more flavor, color, some crunch and some contrast in textures.  To begin with, I used green onion rather than red, since that's what I had, but I don't think I would have particularly liked the bite of the red onion anyway (nor, probably, would anyone standing close to me).  I added the expected and predictable celery, but I also threw in some cooked, crumbled bacon. Really delicious.  I would have loved this on a sandwich but I didn't want to mess with this perfect, low-carb lunch.

This is a great recipe...Can also add baby shrimp, and serve on a crisp lettuce leaf.

Can't think of two things I enjoy more than  egg salad and avocados. Combined, this was so delicious and makes a great lunch or even appy. I didn't measure the mayo or use the sliced eggs as I was just making this for myself. Also added in a few seasonings as I would normally do for either egg salad for guac. Thank you so much!!

Was pretty good - only needed salt and pepper. I love egg salad and avocados.  Leftovers are not good so make just what you can eat right away.

Very tasty!  I went a little lighter on the mayo, and added some crumbled bacon and cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I will definitely make this again.

I love both avocado and egg so I was really looking forward to this.  I read all the reviews in advance and so knew that for our tastes I should add celery and bacon as others have suggested.  My problem with the recipe is that, in my opinion, the avocado/egg ratio is off.  I halved the recipe so started with 3 avocados and 3 chopped eggs.  The avocado completely overwhelmed the egg so I ended up adding 3 more chopped eggs to the 3 avocados.  That  was much more balanced.  Even with the addition of celery and bacon, we still felt this was on the bland side.  We added in another 1/2 cup of onion and also added several shakes of Louisiana hot sauce to the mayo and milk mixture.  Those changes resulted in something quite good, but the original proportions of the recipe were, for us, not the most appealing.

Great way to enjoy avacado.  I added a little salt to bring at the flavor a little better.

Not a strong avocado flavor.  With extra lemon juice, more of a tang, which was quite nice.

Fantastic!  I think people forget that they should "COOK," rather than just follow this blindly.  Just add spices to your taste and it will work just fine. YUM!

This was really good for lunch and a nice change from turkey sandwiches or tv dinners :) I didn't have red onion but I bet it would be really good with it.

This was fantastic!  I was looking for a quick snack and some way to use an avocado that was about to go bad and stumbled across this recipe.  I didn't have any red onions on hand, so I skipped those.  I also added a pinch of sea salt, some cracked black pepper, and a couple dashes of cayenne pepper.  YUM!

So amazing, I kept the mayo to a minimum, added salt and pepper and served on two pieces of whole wheat bread.

The avocado got a little yucky once it became leftovers, but was so very good. I suggest serving soon after it's made.

If I made this with the avocados that are available to me I would have at least 7  cups of avocado alone.  I realize a person needs to use common sense when making a recipe but an approxamite cup amount on the avocados would go a long way in assuring a better result.

I make my own recipe for avocado deviled eggs a lot so I know I would love this egg salad.

So delicious, I’m lost for words. I also added a pinch of some my favorite spices and a few splashes of Buffalo (mild) Hot sauce. Also, I prefer chopping the eggs into small pieces and combining vs. smushing. 
Would add a pic if everything wasn’t already eaten and gone ????! ????

Since I was making this for myself only I modified the recipe a bit.  I used only one avocado and two eggs, about a table spoon of mayo and maybe a 1/4 cup red onion.  I also added salt, pepper and chia seeds!  I love how chunky this recipe is!  It made a lovely sandwich!

Great recipe. I just added some some salt, pepper and tomatoes to give the salad a little more texture and flavour. Thank you for sharing your family recipe!

The recipe was much too bland as some of the other reviews stated. So I dressed it up by adding sweet pickle relish, chopped red onion cilantro, a dash of celery sea salt, and served it in whole wheat wraps with arugula and tomato. YUMMY!

Very bland, missing something and avacados will turn brown. Must eat quick. Will not make this again.
