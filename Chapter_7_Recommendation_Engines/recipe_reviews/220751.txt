I've made this dish twice now and it is one of my favorites!  The only changes I made were to add fresh garlic right after the capers and I used chicken stock instead of water.  I love capers so I may have added more :)  It is a quick, but quite gourmet week night dinner.  Even the kids loved it.  I did run into a problem when we discovered there was none left though!

I used Wondra to dredge the chicken instead of a-p flour (it's finer and less clumpy), then followed all the ingredients but changed the proportions because I used a lot more chicken than this (when I cook I cook big). It's forgiving-but careful about too many capers and and barely salt the chicken because the capers make everything super salty.  I added extra olive oil and butter to the saucepan and added ground garlic and a few flakes of red pepper to simmer awhile.  Didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried.  I served this over penne since I didn't have linquine or spaghetti.  While the pasta drained, I added about 1/3 cup of olive oil to the pasta pot, a half a stick of butter, more garlic granules and about a cup of chicken broth--heated to boiling and tossed the cooked pasta back into it. Put in serving dish, then placed the chicken and all the sauce from the pan over the pasta and topped the pasta and chicken with some grated parmesan cheese.  I have never made a piccata I liked as much as this one and my husband and I inhaled it.  YUM.

Easy & super yummy!  I added a little bit of Panko breadcrumbs to the flour to give it some crunch, and because I'm counting calories & fat, used less EVOO to brown the chicken in the pan and finished it off by baking in the oven after spraying the chicken with some olive oil Pam. (I wanted to have some flavor from the chicken in the pan before de-glazing & making the sauce!)  Also used Smart Balance Spread instead of butter. My wine was a light and fruity Pinot.  This was outstanding on whole wheat angel hair pasta and despite taking some healthy shortcuts, tasted like I was cheating on my healthy eating plan!  Thanks for sharing!  :-)

Simple and tasty!  I followed the recipe as is and used a sauvignon blanc/chardonnay that I had on hand and it was delicious.  If you are not as fond of lemon then cut back a bit on the lemon juice but I love it so I used the exact measurements.  This will be one of my go to recipes in the future.  It is great with any pasta.

I found this recipe on the front page today when I was completely at a loss for what to make for supper.  I had chicken defrosting at home, so I started the video showing the preparation.  It looked so easy, so I decided to give it a go.

Wow, we were surprised.  From such a simple base, add a rich-seeming sauce and this chicken was delightful.  A simple, tart flavour went very well with our rice and steamed vegetables.  My wife is counting calories, so she was initially concerned, but we dodged that bullet by drizzling the sauce over the chicken, rather than finishing it in the thickened sauce.

Very pleased with how easy and tasty this recipe was.

To the person who asked about putting the sauce over angel hair pasta...  Yes, I make double the sauce and put it on angel hair.  But first I saute some garlic in olive oil and put in the pasta and toss with some Parmesan.  It's great.

Once again, Chef, a winner recipe here.  The proportions are just perfect for us!  Yum!  We used this with one packet of Costco's boneless skinless breasts, and because it's just the two of us, we'll have enough left for a delicious sandwich tomorrow.  Thank you ever so much!  Love this stuff!  No changes!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was good. The one thing that I didn't like was how tart the sauce was. When I make this again, and I will, I might leave out the lemon juice or at least decrease it. A change that I did make was to season the flour instead of the chicken.  The kids enjoyed this dish and soaked up the extra sauce from their plate with good, crusty french bread.

Fabulous!  Just like the Veal Piccata recipe I got from a 5-star restaurant out east when I traveled for business.  Chef John, I love all your recipes - easy AND delicious!  For those who say too sharp or lemony, you just missed the whole point of a piccata.  If you don't like the lemon, don't make a piccata and complain.  By definition, it is supposed to be sharp and lemony (piccata=point of a spear).  Most small children would not care for this recipe as it is supposed to be prepared.  Generally it is for mature and educated palates, I would say.

Delicious dish.  The chicken was delicious even before I put on the sauce after frying it in olive oil :)

I made this last night for me and my three kids and they liked it a lot.  I am just making the transition from being a newbie cook to intermediate level and found this to be really easy and straightforward.  It helped that I got all the ingredients prepped first since I usually forget to add something. In fact I had one of my son's help get me organized.  I made this with a side of rice that I started just prior to starting cooking the chicken and it worked out great!

I have to wonder about people complaining that the dish is too tart and lemony. It's chicken PICCATA. Don't cook a PICCATA dish if you don't like tart and lemony. Simple. And to leave out the lemon altogether. Unbelievable.

I LOVED this recipe! I have tried 2 other recipes for Chicken Piccata in the last month that were much more difficult and took over an hour to prepare, so I was looking for something simpler. This recipe had fewer steps and took 20 minutes to throw together. I usually pound out my chicken when I get it home from the grocery store and Food Save it, so I had chicken ready to go. The only changes I made were to season the dredging flour (salt, pepper & dried lemon peel) and using half white wine and half chicken broth (for my picky husband who doesn't like the taste of wine in his food!) Absolutely delicious!
Thank you Chef John!

A gourmet recipe! I doubled the sauce ingredients. I usrd chicken broth instead of water and only used 3 T of lemon juice. I loved it! As I was cooking it - I thought that it screamed for the addition of cream. Next time, I'll add cream when making it.

Was very easy to make and delicious. If you are not a lemon fan it may be to strong for you. I served it with pearled couscous and would recommend pouring the sauce on the plate, not on the chicken as it soaks in a leaves the last bites less crunchy!

Watched the how-to video for tips and the chicken piccata turned out awesome!  I especially liked the tip about smashing half of the capers.  Other than adding a bit of chopped garlic (my personal preference), I followed the recipe exactly.  The ratio of the various ingredients are spot on.  Thanks Chef John!

This is a great quick and easy recipe.  If you have a chance, watch the video, it offers some great prep tips.  I made it as per the recipe with one exception.  I did not want to open a bottle of wine, so I deglazed the pan with chicken broth instead.  Delicious!

This is by far the best chicken piccata I've made.  I use chicken broth instead of water, and always dredge the breasts in flour, dip in egg and the coat with bread crumbs.  It's a lot of work, but worth the effort.  Panko bread crumbs work best.

So Good! Have made this many times. One large lemon yields the correct amount for four servings. My wine preference for this recipe is Pinot Grigio.

We have had this exactly as stated many times.  We watch Chef John lots and love all his recipes.  We make it with a simple salad and veggies and pour that wonderful sauce over the chicken.  We don't add all the starchy rice or potatoes and that is where the calories come from so we still get to use that yummy butter!  Thanks Chef John!

I followed the recipe, but want do it again. Way too lemony, no depth of flavor. Sauce didn't thicken, had to add flour. Waste of time.

This is a good recipe basic for a quick & rewarding meal. In a pinch I have used lemon pepper seasoning before dredging in flour when I didn't have the fresh lemon. Also sprinkled dried parsley flakes and parmesan on the chicken during the cooking of the second side...great little cheats for days when you don't have the fresh lemon & parsley. Also good variation is to add sliced frozen artichoke hearts (not marinated!) & mushrooms to change it up!

Loved it! Double the sauce, tho, and at least double the capers - maybe more.

Yummy!  This went together quick - instructions were easy to follow and dish turned out as expected.  I kept the finished chicken pieces warm in a 200 degree oven while cooking the remaining pieces.  The chicken was fork tender and sauce delish.

Very good and easy recipe. I used the juice of one lemon and it was plenty. You really need to get that chicken to brown, or your sauce will be all high notes, tart and bland. Caramelizing gives the sauce depth, and low notes and mellows all the acids. Make sure your oil is hot enough to brown. Not too hot, or it will brown too fast and you won't get the chicken cooked through. I've made it 3 times so far and tonight will the be the 4th! Almost halfway to ten!

Quite sharp! I expect a piccata to be piquant, but this seemed unpleasantly acid to me and my husband. My usual recipe uses 2 Tbsp. lemon and 3/4 cup chicken broth, otherwise is almost the same. I have loved that and will go back to my tried and true.

Chicken Piccata is my favorite dish...very grateful to have found this recipe...My wife always teases me about why do I ever use a recipe because I always change it, a recipe inspires me to creative thoughts...so here goes and I hope you enjoy: Chicken broth instead of water; fresh garlic; small jar of marinaded artichoke hearts; 4 slices of prosciutto sliced into bit size pieces; and upon serving lay out a bed of spinach then egg noodles; chicken and sauce then sprinkle with parmesan cheese...thanks for the inspiration

I have made this over and over.  The changes that I use are to sauté the chicken in lemon olive oil and I add lots of fresh garlic.  ( we like garlic ) Use the amount of capers that Chef John's recipe calls for.  That is one ingredient where more is not necessarily better.  Capers are quite salty. This is a fantastic recipe.

Delicious!  I would not call it "quick", but it is certainly worth the effort.  I have made it several times, and everyone raves about this dish.  Chicken breasts in my area are sometimes so thick that I either cook them longer or butterfly them to make them thinner.  Either way, the lemon, butter, wine, and caper sauce is the key to the flavors.  If you use more chicken than is in the recipe, don't forget to make extra sauce to go with it. I used a large electric skillet to have enough space for 6 pieces of chicken, then added about 50% more sauce. The lemon flavor stands out, so I have only used freshly squeezed lemon juice. I did substitute Italian seasoning for the fresh parsley. If some of your guests don't like lemons and capers, just don't return those pieces to the sauce mixture, and end up with lightly battered fried chicken.  With picky eaters, I have also made the sauce separately and let each person pour it on like gravy, if they wanted to try it.  I prefer to return the chicken to the sauce to soak in more flavor like the recipe says, but it is still quite good if the sauce is added later.

Extremely simple to make - but phenomenally good. Depending on how tart you like your sauce, I might recommend cutting the lemon juice a bit - but replace with extra wine. This will be a "go to" for me from now on. Restaurant quality taste that makes you look like a chef with skills.

This is really simple to make and delicious. I use this same recipe as a marinade for chicken on the grill and its phenomenal - I butterfly chicken before pounding it, skip the dredging, mix together the rest of the ingredients, toss chicken in for about an hour, and then grill for a few minutes on each side. The smoky flavor really goes well with this recipe. Now I can make it in the cold season and in the warm season!

I prepared this exactly as written, then served it with a thick spaghetti over which I drizzled the remaining pan juices.  My husband's review: "If I had paid $25 for that in a restaurant, I would have considered it worth every penny." This one's definitely going in the rotation.  Perfectly balanced flavours and moist, tender chicken.

I don't know what went wrong but it was too bitter. I think I may have used too much wine. It was actually better the next day but I wouldn't make this again. My 5yr nephew loved it so, maybe it's just me.

I liked it very much.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I was rather wary of the amount of lemon juice and added a bit less than the amount stated.  Delicious.  I cooked too much chicken and ate the rest for supper.  The sauce was even better second time round.  I can't understand anyone having trouble making it.  Everything did just what it was supposed to do.

Super easy and fast!  I used [homemade, salt-free] chicken stock instead of the water.  I also didn't mush up any of the capers because I find them strong enough.  I made this after watching Chef John's video.

Tried this last night and we loved it!  Next time more capers and a little less lemon juice but it was really good.  Did what another reviewer did to the pasta and it was a great idea.  Drained the pasta then put minced garlic, 1/3 cup olive oil, half stick of butter and cup of chicken broth in the pot.  Brought it to a boil, turned it off and added the pasta to it.  It was really good even without the chicken!

This is actually my FIRST review of a recipe!  This is perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I added a crushed clove of garlic to the sauce mixture right after the capers.  The lemon and caper combination made for excellent flavor!  My husband loved it and I actually made extra sauce after we finished dinner so there would be sauce for the remaining pieces of chicken (I made extra or leftovers).  Thanks Chef John!  Fabulous dinner, which I paired with Rice Pilaf and String Beans Almondine.  Perfect combos, I think!

I use just under 1/4 cup of lemon juice to keep this from being too tart & add garlic powder to the seasoned chicken but those are the only modifications. INCREDIBLE!!!! One of our fave family meals. Super easy & yum! Chef John has some amazing recipes on here!

This was delicious and so easy. I didn't have white wine so I used a splash of white wine vinegar in the chicken stock. I replaced the water with all chicken stock.  My hubby and I thought it was a bit tart but my daughter thought it was perfect. Probably due to the vinegar so if I substitute this again I will add a little sugar. Also a beautiful dish. Will impress your dinner guests!! I served it over angel hair pasta.  Try this recipe !! You won't regret it :)

This was delicious. We didn't have capers so I used chopped black olives. It was different but still gave it that tart and tangy twist. I also used champagne versus white wine.

This is with out a doubt one of my favourite chicken recipes. It hasn't even been a week that's gone by since I've discovered this recipe and I have already made it twice.

Very good and relatively easy.  I had to cook mine longer than 5 minutes per side and I thought it was a tad too lemony but still delicious.  I like to make a recipe exactly as stated and then make adjustments.  Still I think this is definitely 5 stars and now I can adjust to my own tastes.  I did need to add a little bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce but just a small amount.  Maybe I didn't flour my chicken enough to help that process.

This recipe is very easy and very tasty.  The chicken was so tender.  It actually took me longer to prepare than the recipe stated, but maybe that's just me.  I cut back on the lemon juice and added garlic, personal preferences.  My boyfriend loved it!

Made this tonight and it was so good!  I halved the lemon juice and added a jar of artichoke hearts with the capers.  Also, if you like sauce, definitely double the sauce ingredients.  We loved it!

Delicious and so easy. Definitely smash the capers as directed. Used chicken stock in place of water - else perfect as written.

I loved the flavor of this dish! It's sweet and tart, and went great over pasta. The only changes I made were to toss in some extra capers, and I did have to cook the sauce longer for it to thicken. One of my new favorites.

Better than you think if make it right! and if you're not a big fan of lemon, just cut down the amount of lemon juice you use a touch and it makes it top notch.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, I used a chardonney wine instead of a basic white. I didn't really like it but my dad did. I will make it again using chicken stock and maybe just a splash of wine next time and def only use a couple tsp of lemon juice.

I love Chef John’s recipes. I just still need to make it my own.  I made a couple tweaks, added minced garlic when I started to make sauce, also used more lemon juice and no water. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch to the lemon before adding.  Also half fume Blanc and half chicken stock.  I ended up with more lemony gravy which is great over vegetables.

This was very good but the sauce didn't thicken much. Next time I will add a little flour or something. The flavor was very good, but might use a little less lemon next time too.

Loved it & it was exactly what I was looking for!!  I needed to use more oil and I used thin cutlets.  I cooked them for 3 min on each side.  At the end the sauce wasn't as thick as I'd hoped so added just a small pinch of cornstarch.  Next time I'd also use a little less butter! Delish!!

I love Chef John's easy-to-follow recipes. I've made this a few times. You can substitute low sodium chicken broth for the wine and you can use half of the butter and thicken the sauce with corn starch mixed with water.  I served this tonight over whole wheat angel hair pasta and an arugula salad dressed with a little olive oil and lemon juice. It paired very nicely.

I made this for our "Family Sunday Night dinner" and everyone loved it!  I served it with fresh whole green beans, hot rolls, and mushroom rice and everyone gobbled it up.  My kids are college-age, so their palates are maybe more mature than young children's and they loved the sauce.  I had a hungry clan so I doubled everything and kept the first batch of chicken warm in the oven while cooking the 2nd batch.  I tripled the sauce and added 1 tsp. minced garlic based on earlier reviews.  I added a small amount (1-2 tsp) of a cornstarch/water blend to thicken the sauce a little bit since I cut back a tad on the butter.  Definitely a winner and I've been requested to make this again.  Thanks for the yummy recipe! I'm only sorry I forgot to take a picture---it looked that good!

Absolutely delicious and great presentation.... would make it again and again, and would serve it to guests.  I followed the recipe (I always do the first time and then make my adjustments - no adjustments here)  I used Toasted Head Chardonnay for the white wine.  Accompanied it with Basmati Rice and  chopped romain salad.

This is an amazing recipe!  Probably ranking on my top 10 list of favorites from this site.  It is quite easy to make and the flavor is, well, refreshing and different from any chicken recipe I have ever tasted.  It makes the taste buds really work overtime. Love, love, love!  My teenage daughter even loves it.

Made this 3 times already and it's delicious!  I love the lemon juice and capers.  It makes such a nice sauce.  Just made this again tonight and the sauce wouldn't thicken.  It was very good though!  Another review 2 years later and this remains a staple in my house.  Hubby loves it!

Way too much lemon juice in the sauce! The chicken was tasty but could use a little more seasoning. I added garlic after the capers and only used about 1/2 tsp capers. I also added Famous Dave's seasoning to the sauce. I would use 2 TBSP of lemon juice next time. The sauce was so bitter, I thought I'd have to throw it out. I was able to fix it by adding some sugar and then chicken stock and flour to thicken. Next time, use chicken stock instead of water. Everyone liked the dish after I fixed the sauce.

Very good! I changed a few things. First, I omitted salt as a seasoning because I used low-sodium chicken broth instead of water (more flavor). After I deglazed, I added 1 clove garlic and sautéed for 1 minute or so. I serve pasta with a spicy homemade tomato-herb sauce like I do when I serve my veal piccata which it's almost identical to this one. Once again, thank you Chef John for another awesome recipe

It's way too sour as is. I myself tone the sauce down with 1/2 cup of chicken broth which makes more liquid and can be thickened with a little cornstarch mixed with water. There will be enough sauce to serve over noodles.

Ooh, I really like this recipe! The only changes I made were to leave out the capers (not a huge fan) and the parsley (the parsley I bought was lifeless and tasteless). My sauce didn't get thick at all, not sure if I did something wrong, but it was still very tasty. I made brown rice and Roasted Garlic Cauliflower (from this site) to accompany the chicken.

I made this back in 11-2011 before it was published...Here is my review: My first time ever making chicken piccata. I saw the video by Chef John on AR homepage, and knew that was what I was making with my chicken breast tonight. Very easy and the only thing I'd do differently next time is cut down on the lemon, just a little squeeze would be enough. I did add some minced garlic...a nice addition. I made the new red potatoes with capers to go along with this....a perfect pair.

My First Review - It was that good and that easy.  I didn't have chicken breasts, used strips.  Didn't have flour, used breadcrumbs.  Didn't have white wine, used champagne.  Didn't have butter, used margarine, decreased the water in the recipe and thickened with the tiniest bit of cornstarch at the end.  Had thin spagetti that I served it with and it was so so so good!  And way easy too. Can't wait to make it with the proper ingredients!  Thanks Chef John!!

I just made this tonight and I absolutely loved it! It was very easy and delicious! Even my 7 year old who I thought would baulk at the capers ate her entire plate. The only thing I did differently (on accident I should add lol) was 1 tablespoon more olive oil and and extra tablespoon of capers) what I did differently on purpose was add the exact same seasonings that I seasoned the chicken with to the flour for extra taste. If you nomally enjoy chicken piccata then you will love this recipe- 5 stars for sure!

Lovely dish. Cut the lemon down by half and didn't add any salt at all because of the capers. Other than that made as written. Served it with green peas. Definitely a hit and goes into my rotation.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe ingredients. The only thing I do differently, is I split the chicken breast so I have thinner pieces. I still pound them.  I have made this dish so many times that I don't even need to look up the recipe.  My family and friends love it.  It's tender, juicy and full of flavor.  Sometimes I make a little extra sauce.

One of my favorites. I always order chicken piccata when we eat out just to see if it's better than this recipe and it's never. The only thing I do differently is double the sauce and mix it in with 'no yoke' flat noodles to serve.

I feel like a pro after making this recipe! I didn't use any water and instead added extra wine.  I only used the juice of 1/2 a large lemon based on reviews stating the lemon as overpowering and tossed in a Tbs of garlic.  I also doubled the capers (at least) and added a little more butter than called for.  Served with bowtie pasta and some steamed broccoli, it made my hubby very happy indeed.  So happy with this simple but impressive meal.  I will make it again for sure!

This is a good basic piccata recipe.  I did add mushrooms that I had cooked previously and I use chicken broth istead of water. My only suggestion is by crushing the capers, it does make the sauce pretty sour.  I had to add more chicken broth and flour to take away some of the sour taste.  I will make this again, but I will not crush the capers, I will just add them at the end.

This was easy to make, but it calls for way too much lemon juice. I couldn't taste the wine, butter, capers or chicken for that matter. This recipe only needs about a tablespoon of lemon juice, not 1/4 of a cup.

One word AMAZING!! The sauce was a tad too lemony (I didn't measure so my fault), so I added in 1tsp chopped wet garlic to it. It evened things out and gave it amazing flavor! Served it with plain spaghetti squash and sautéed asparagus, of course, drenched in this amazing sauce! Incredible, I would eat this for every meal if I could. Thanks chef!

I followed the recipe exactly, and give it 5 stars. After assembling all the measured ingredients before starting, it was simple to make, very tasty, and enough sauce to flavor a rice or pasta side. Paired with a simple salad, this chicken recipe is now on my regular rotation. One thing I did notice was that when I made this with a non-stick pan, it did change how the final dish turned out. With a stainless steel saute pan, I got a better fond for deglazing which I think made a superior sauce in the end.

I think I am addicted to this recipe, I have made it three times in two weeks. It is so good! I had never had Chicken Piccata before so I didn't have any expectation for what it would taste like. The first time I made this recipe exactly as written, the second time I added just a little less lemon juice. Nothing against the recipe or the chef, (we love Chef John's recipes) just personal taste.

Chef John you are my go to guy for recipes! I've made chicken piccata before but I think it is your addition of the cayenne pepper which took this recipe over the top. I added a bit more lemon juice since I had it and my husband said it was awesome. Thanks again.

I followed this recipe to the letter.  It was so easy and flavorful (use fresh lemon juice people!!) and was accompanied by spaghetti with pesto and some asparagus.  It needs no further embellishments as the lemony caper sauce speaks for itself.  Enjoy!,

Wonderful!  I did substitute the water with Kitchen Basics chicken broth to add a bit of savory to compliment the lemon.  I tossed the sauce in angel hair pasta with pan sauteed veggies, put the chicken on top and then garnished with fresh grated parmesean cheese.  Lots of compliments from my guests.

This was a quick and easy recipe. My husband raved and had seconds. I Like a strng lemony taste and this delivers.

I used chicken stock instead of wine, added some garlic, and added some cornstarch at the end to thicken it up, came out wonderful.

I love this recipe, exactly as it is!  This recipe is on my regular rotation for dinner recipes!  I make it at least every 2 weeks.  I learned a lot from this recipe, seasoning the chicken before frying is easy and I like using just enough flour.  The only thing I do to save time, I don't pound the chicken, I slice my boneless chicken breast horizontally in half, which makes four cutlets out of two, they cook up even and quicker, and my meat goes a little farther.  I started eating paleo recently and used almond flour instead of regular flour, it still was a winner! Thanks for this great recipe!

This was very good and simple to make.  I liked the video, the chef is easy going and makes it seem easy. I served it with angel hair pasta and green beans.

This is the way it's supposed to be done. The chicken must be tenderized or else it's just a tasty lump of meat. Also, reducing wine does not happen instantaneously be patient.

Awesome flavor. A few tips if this is your first time making it. Measure and set aside all ingredients before you start. Once going, you don't want to be measuring white wine etc.

Also, my chicken breasts took a good 8 minutes per side to cook and after setting on the plate I saw some pinkish juice, so I simmered in the sauce for about 10 minutes in the end. I did pound them to 1/2" also and still needed that time. 
I served on top of a family recipe of patting mashed potatoes into parties, dipping in egg and coating with crushed saltines. Frying these about 4 mn per side with olive oil. Serve with some asparagus and viola! Yum yum yum!

I've been making this for a long time.  I leave out the red and black pepper and sub. dried Basil.  The unsalted butter is silly too. I only have butter in my fridge.  This is a real favorite in our house.  If you don't have chicken breasts, thighs and legs work great too.

Great recipe.  It is now in our routine meal rotation.  I did make a bit more sauce than the recipe calls for just because I like extra sauce.

I found this to be greasy. I also think some measure on the cayenne would improve the recipe since so little goes a long way.

I made this for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it! I used chicken broth instead of water. I personally would have added garlic to this recipe. I did add a little garlic salt to the sauce but next time I think I will cook some garlic along with the capers.

Easy and delicious as written (for my taste at least). My husband thought it was a little much on the sour side, but not bad. He still thought the dish was good. Next time I'll leave out the lemon and see if that works. I served the chicken over pasta with some broccoli.

I love Chicken Piccata and have made it often.  This recipe follows mine, except for mashing down some of the capers.  That gave it additional flavor and using the wine to stir with the pan drippings was better than just adding the wine.  I use less butter as well.  This was perfect.  Once again, thanks  Chef John!

This was fantastic.  NOTE: anyone who isn't a lemon fan, Chicken Piccata is not for you.  Chicken Piccata IS lemony.  I thought lemon ratio was perfect.  Also, the sauce is NOT supposed to be gravy consistency. So do not base your decision to try this recipe on the critiques of those thickening the sauce more or reducing lemon juice.  Wish I'd measured the amount of cayenne (eyeballed what "looked" right) because it was JUST right.  Used chicken stock instead of wine b/c as much as I want to love wine in recipes, I'm always disappointed.  Served with roasted asparagus and Parmesan Garlic Orzo (from this site)

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I changed was I added chopped garlic (about three cloves) right after I added the capers, and I doubled the sauce, as I like to have enough sauce for the angel hair pasta I served with it.  Fancy enough for company, easy enough for a weeknight meal, and makes amazing leftovers for lunch the next day!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This worked out really well.  My boyfriend has been asking for a piccata for a long time and I've dragged my feet because it's not my favorite.  This was very simple and turned out really good.  I've heard about it for four days since we ate it so that's always a good sign!

Making it tonight! I will be tweaking it by dredging the chicken in flour then in egg like Rochester-Style Chicken French. I may add artichoke hearts too! Substituting water with chicken broth and definitely cutting down on the lemon. Omitting cayenne. Doesn't make sense to add it.

Takes much more than 25 minutes to make, but well worth the effort. The chicken also doesn't lose its flavor quickly, so leftovers are just as scrumptious.

I added garlic and two cups of chicken stock in place of the water so there was a good amount of sauce left. I also mixed in some Parmesan in the flour when I dredged the chicken.. This is an awesome dish!

Flavor delicious but there was not enough sauce for my family. When I do it again, I will double the liquid so they can have a bit of sauce over the rice or pasta.

So glad I tried this simple but elegant dish for dinner tonight. Chicken was delicious and had a bit of kick with the Cayenne Pepper...yum! Loved the tart lemon taste with the salty capers. I tried to double the sauce and made too much. We had it with a garlic and parmesan risotto and lemon garlic oven-baked broccoli. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Chef John!

This recipe was great! Very quick! I added flour to the capers and lemon juice mix to thicken it up! Overall, it was excellent for a person who cant cook. My fiancé and best friend loved it and was begging for more after their first plate!

It was a good recipe but I did make a couple changes. I used some lemon pepper seasoning and the Salt and pepper in the flour mix and put it all in a bag for easy clean up. I added fresh garlic after adding the capers and used chicken broth instead of water. I also used half fresh lemon and half lemon juice as well as very thin lemon slices. At the end I added a small amount of flour to thicken the sauce a bit. Thanks for the recipe!

Chef John's recipe is easier & just as delicious as my usual "go to" piccata recipe.  In fact, it's going to replace it.  Only change I made was using chicken stock instead of water.  Not too lemony, not too salty, it's perfect! Very tasty

Life Saver! Made this dish last night. Had all the ingredients and needed a "nice" dinner for my family. Only changes I made were, I mixed  all the seasonings in the flour mixture, (Cayenne, Salt, Pepper, Parsley). I also followed another reviewers suggestion and used chicken broth instead of the water and a lot more capers as I love capers. So delicious and SO easy!!! Thanks Chef John!

So easy to make! I used thinly sliced chicken breast to cut down on the cooking time. Served it with Herb Couscous and roasted asparagus. YUM!  The lemon butter sauce was a bit strong so if you're not too fond of lemon you can cut back a bit on the lemon juice. My Husband inhaled it! I even heard some lip smacking and a "yum" under his breath. Lol. I highly suggest making a little extra sauce, you won't regret it!

Mmwoah! Great lemony taste this was the perfect dish for tonight.  First time making it and I'll be making it again.  I love the flavors as the capers go so well with the lemon.  I'm wishing there were leftovers.  Sadly, there aren't.

I LOVED this recipe! This dish was a great way to use up the rest of the wine in the fridge (a sweet moscato). However, I did add minced garlic to the sauce and less lemon juice than the recipe called for (I just did it by personal taste). I found that it was necessary for me to add a little bit of flour, as the sauce wasn't thickening up to my liking. I served the chicken over whole wheat pasta with artichoke hearts (yum!). This was truly a delight to make and I will definitely be making it again!

This was perfect. Resist the urge to add garlic. I use Mouton Cadet bordeaux for the white wine (it's cheap and I love to cook with this one). I used frozen breasts and they were juicy and amazing. The spice rub before breading is essential. Don't season the bread crumbs and expect the flavor to translate from dredging alone. You need to rub the spices into the flesh. Just perfect.

Retired, on a fixed income and learning to cook "chef in training" - Found this recipe, thought it sounded good so I gave it a shot. I cook for the most picky and critical eaters anyone should have to feed, everyone loved it, said it was one of the best meals I've cooked - Had all of the ingredients except for the capers, followed the recipe as listed, Success. It was simple, cost effective with no mess and with the taste that I expected, will definitely make this again - Oh yea, for seniors on fixed income to be cost effective in still feeding 4 to 5 people, you can instead of pounding 4 chicken breasts out, take 2 thick chicken breasts and fillet each breast and cook as instructed. Thanks Chef John, I'll search the site for more recipes and keep trying to do different things, BRAVO! James

I make this recipe all the time.  It is excellent.  I rub paprika on the chicken breasts before dredging them in the flour - that is the only difference - other than that, I follow this recipe exactly.  My picky husband loves this!

Absolutely delicious! I basically tripled the chicken and quadruped the sauce because we had guests, and everyone raved about it! The only changes I made were to replace the cayenne with onion powder (we didn't want it spicy) and add garlic to the sauce

I thought it was very delicious and will definately make again. My husband isn't fond of capers and he even said it was a 5 star meal. sliced my chicken breasts thin and saved the time of pounding them and they were able to be cut with a fork tender.

This was incredible! I followed the recipe as it came. I loved the tartness and, of course, the capers. To give an idea of the deliciousness quotient, while I ate dinner and the skillet cooled (leftovers already stored), the cat jumped up and licked the pan clean, even though there was no chicken in it at all. This was seriously good! I had intended to divide it into more portions (weight watchers, don't you know?). I ate an entire chicken-breast half. And again the second day. This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this was a very tasty recipe.  I added minced garlic along with the capers.  I served it atop a mound of whole grain linguine that I tossed with a little butter and garlic....fantastic.  Also to watch the fat calories, I used Smart Balance instead of real butter...still very tasty.  Will definitely make this one again!

I just made this recipe today and it's quite possibly my favorite quick-prep-eat meal ever!  Great taste, easy to prepare, and cooks quickly.  The key really is to flatten out the chicken breasts.  They cook evenly and quickly.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I did add artichokes from a can but that's not necessary.  One note--when I first added the liquid I thought that it was too much, and not thick enough.  I let it cook down and sure enough, it turned into a very nice pan sauce that had thickened as it cooked down.  I added the butter right at the end and that made it even better.  Don't skip the butter.  It's not much considering the overall portion/quantity the recipe makes.  Can't wait to make this one again and again.  It's so easy you won't need the recipe next time you make it.

Made this tonight for dinner and it disappeared so fast!  Everyone loved it and my son even asked for more!  I will be adding this to my regular recipes.  It's easy to make but tastes like it's from a restaurant!  I did make one change because I didn't have white wine, I used chicken broth instead of the wine and water.  Yum!

Excellent!  Tried it last night and it was absolutely delicious.   I love the wine-lemon-caper flavor of.  Yes, the sauce was somewhat tart and thin - but that's how we like it!   Will do this again - what a great treat (and simple to make!)

I made this last night for the first time and it was delicious and so easy to make.  The only thing I changed was instead of water, I've added chicken broth and less lemon juice.  Overall, we loved it!  Definitely adding it to my recipes.  Thank you, Chef John!

Very good! I did not use white wine and water, used chic broth instead as wine gives me acid reflux.  My husband loved it and I emailed the recipe to a friend who is making it tonight.

Made this last night ...ohhhhhh so yummy!
We smacked our lips all the way through.
It helps to like lemon, butter and capers which are some of my favorite ingredients. 
I will make this a go-to for guests....go chef John!

Very good but a bit too much fat for my taste- I didn't precisely measure the olive oil that I used so that may have been part of the problem but next time I think I'll try cutting back to 2 tablespoonfuls of butter or even less. And on top of that I also took other reviewers advice to double the sauce amount but I only doubled the liquids & capers amounts and not the oil and butter- and it was still too greasy! I also switched chicken stock for the wine & water because I forgot to stop at the liquor store after leaving the grocery and I used dried parsley flakes because the parsley at the store was pretty gross but that part of the flavor profile was still fine. Also remember to go easy when you're salting your chicken because the capers (and stock, if you use that) will add plenty. Next time I'll be sure to use wine and try cutting back on the fats a little and if I do I'll try to remember to come back and update my review.

As others stated, the chicken has too much of a lemon flavor that needs to be toned down.  I used less lemon than stated and it was still way too strong and felt it was a wasted time and effort. Won't make this dish again.  My kids, who usually eat most things, didn't even want to take a bite of it.

This was a huge hit with Hubs!  He raved about it!  I added a big clove of garlic with the capers.  And I was concerned this might be too tart for me, so I cut the amount of lemon juice in half.  I may cut it a little further next time, but that’s just me.  I also thought the sauce was too thin so I added a cornstarch/water slurry.  I liked Chef John’s cooking times and temps.  I think reducing the temp to medium helped keep this chicken very moist.  I’ll be trying that with other chicken dishes.

This was so bitter! Adding both wine AND lemon juice was just too much.  Had to add more butter AND some sugar (about 1 tsp.) in order to "balance" the flavors.  And it never did "thicken".  Will likely not make this again.

This was easy to make and tasted great! Just like you get at a restaurant and one of DH's favorite meals I make. I make double the sauce so I have extra for a pasta side or to drizzle over some other starch and go a little lighter on the lemon juice as that is our preference. Wonderful recipe as written not needing any changes and presents beautifully.

My husband gave it a four but I gave it a six, so it averages out to five.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the cayenne (I was sure we had some but if it's in our spice cabinet, it did a great job of hiding from me.)  Definitely one to make again and again.  I always enjoy Chef John's videos, too. :-)  Thank you!

Easy and delicious recipe, and it does not need any tweaking whatsoever. I made only two chicken breasts with the 4-breast portion of sauce--mopped up the extra with ciabatta bread. Would definitely be great over pasta, though I'll increase the amount of sauce if I try that.

Awesome easy dinner.  Enjoyed watching the video to learn a few new tips including how to dredge the chicken and get the most flavor out of the capers. Will definitely do this one again.

Great!  I've tried a lot of piccata recipes, but this was really quick and just as good.  I made the mistake of adding more capers because I love them and thought I knew better.  In the future just trust Chef John :)  His recipe is perfectly balanced in my opinion.  There is not a ton of sauce, but it is very strong and just a drizzle over and around the chicken works perfect.  I served with well browned criminis and broccolini along with light, fresh bruschetta.  The earthy veggies and fresh tomatoes on the bruschetta were a great counterpoint, and then the bread was great for sopping up every last drip of sauce.  Excellent meal.

This is so easy and delicious. It has become a regular in our house. I literally only had to make it twice  looking at the recipe and I knew how to do it on my own without pulling up the recipe each time.  It's so flavorful and elegant enough for company. I have served with veggie rice, pasta, whipped potatoes, and on its own with asparagus or green beans. I also omit the wine and use low sodium chicken stock and unsalted butter so it doesn't overpower the capers.

Very delicious. I added a [drained] can of artichoke hearts right after the capers and browned them, then continued with the recipe as is. I thought this was a nice addition.

What a great dinner and it was so easy.  The only thing I would change is to double the sauce part as I served it over angel hair pasta.  It was yummy!

Good recipe. If you pound the chicken as suggested than cooking for 5 mins per side is too long. Chicken will be overcooked. 3 mins per side is plenty.

Made to recipe.  Very tasty. reminded me of the first time I ever had it in a restaurant.  I prefer it served with pasta and would recommend using 2-3 times as many capers.  Yummy!

Absolutely delicious! My family loved this - a great 'company' dish. I changed the recipe by dipping the chicken first in flour, then egg, then bread crumbs and frying. I didn't cook it all through so I put it in a 9 X 12" pan, covered it with the lemon sauce and putting it in the oven for 30 minutes (350 degrees). I served it with angel hair pasta. Definitely recommend it.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the fresh parsley.  I used 3.5 chicken breasts and cut them into pieces and pounded them out.  I needed more than 2 tablespoons of oil and I didn't have enough sauce for all of the chicken but what I did have was very tasty.  I probably would have used more capers.

Pretty easy and tasted delicious. Absolutely no critique of the recipe at all. The directions were pretty clear and accurate. While it is easy, because it is “quick” the steps are pretty hands on through the whole thing.

This is very good, and very easy to make. Looks pretty impressive. I love lemon, but would cut back the lemon a touch as well, and mix the spices into the flour before dredging next time.... there absolutely WILL be a next time... soon. Thanks for sharing

This is a top-shelf high-end restaurant quality recipe.  We love Chicken Piccata, and have enjoyed it from many fine restaurants.  This recipe hit the mark.  It wasn't difficult and we were able to put it together pretty quickly.  We had a three pounds of chicken tenderloins to cook, and they worked really well with this recipe.  I didn't have any white wine, so I used half red wine and half beef broth (didn't have chicken broth!).  I was a bit worried about the red wine and beef broth, but since you're cooking it down, it was absolutely fine.  The only differences we made were to add some garlic powder and oregano to the flour dredge, and we used an entire jar of capers because we love them.  Lastly, don't be afraid to use the reconstituted lemon juice ... I only had one lemon and had to supplement with the little yellow plastic juice stuff.  I'm getting wordy now, but this recipe was just absolutely fantastic and we will certainly make it again!

I have made this recipe over a dozen times.  It is delicious!!  My husband loves the sauce so much that he asked me to make more.  So I either double the recipe for the sauce or 1 &1/2 times it.   Perfect every time!!

I am not a cook as a matter of fact I don't even like to cook, but it was necessary and I was bored with our dinners. Oh my gosh, I will NEVER again order chicken piccata at a restaurant because this dish was so easy and amazing!!!!  My whole family loved this and it was all stuff we had on hand except capers which I went out and bought. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!

LOVED it. I made it a second time. Doubled everything and had enough for leftovers we will eat tonight. Used chicken broth instead of water,  doubled the capers then added garlic and forgot the parsley. YUM !!
I would add the photo but the plate is empty.  :)

My wife and I I cooked this exactly as specified.  We served it with couscous, oven-roasted mushrooms, a deep mushroom soup and a bright  salad.

The picata recipe was moist and tasty, though perhaps a trifle tart for many pallets.  I would give it four stars. An addition of more greens or pasta might help to soak up the acids.

Wonderful,  though,  just as is.

I substituted the water for chicken broth and added minced garlic when I added the capers. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes per other reviewers suggestions. This will become a regular meal at our house. Easy enough to make for family, but nice enough to serve for company. It paired well with whole grain rice and peas and carrots.

Like all Chef John recipes this came out terrific exactly as written.  The only thing you might want to I do is double the sauce recipe.   My family like to put the sauce on the chicken, the rice and the steamed broccoli!!!   Enjoy.

Made this tonight and my husband said it  was the best meal I've made in a while and it needs to become a regular. I used chicken stock instead of water, extra parsley,  added mushrooms to the sauce. and roasted minced garlic. Our side was golden mashed potatoes. Looking forward to leftovers!

Delicious!! I found that the sauce didn’t thicken very much on its own so I added a bit of the Wondra flour used for dredging. If you are planning on having the Picatta with pasta (we used angel hair), I recommend doubling the sauce so there is enough to spoon over. Yum!!

I made this with cod instead of chicken and it was delicious. My boys are wrestlers and need low fat, high protien meals. I just spray the pan with light canola oil cooking spray, season the cod - no flour. Saute the fish, remove, and make the sauce using ghee instead of butter. Our boys just eat the fish with the sauce drizzled on top and my husband and I add angel hair pasta. Everyone loved it!!!

Delicious!!!  Only thing I did different is to use chicken broth in place of water.  It reminded me of the chicken piccata from an Italian restaurant that I worked at decades ago but even better!

I loved it.  Hubby thought it was too tart.  The only omission I made was the cayenne because I missed it!  Oh, and I used Fava flour because I can't do wheat.  It was scrumptious and I will make it again but with less lemon.  I served it with pan-fried green beans.  Excellent!!

Easy recipe and very tasty.  I decided to not “lightly smash” the capers to release the brine because I like that to happen when I “bite down” on the intact caper!

Very flavorful!  My super picky daughter went back for seconds and told me it was her favorite thing I have ever made :)  I followed the recipe with no modifications.  Next time I will follow another users suggestion to double the sauce and serve over linguine noodles.

I love this simple recipe!  So simple and the ingredients were spot on. The ONLY thing I changed is that I added a splash of chicken broth in lieu of the water called for in the recipe, as suggested by other reviewers.  I hardly ever use canned chicken broth as I always make my own using the low sodium powder mixed with water.  And because I had prepared some broth to use in my spaghetti, it was readily available.  Thanks to reviewer Lorsonline, I served this dish with angel hair spaghetti.  And as suggested, after I drained my spaghetti, I added a little bit of olive oil, a couple of TBS of butter and a cup of chicken broth back to the pot, brought it to a boil and then put the spaghetti back in.  Delicious!  I will do this any time I make pasta!  Thanks Lorsonline!

Very easy. Prep is essentially. Have everything ready. Served over thin spaghetti and with a white wine although a buttery Chardonnay would be a nice compliment. Very elegent.

One of my family's favorite meals. Easy to make and taste restaurant quality. I add extra capers because we like capers but wouldn't change a thing other than that.

SUPER DELICIOUS! The sauce wasn't really "thick" (might have been my mistake, honestly) but it tasted incredible. Served the chicken with GF noodles with olive oil, mushrooms  and a little parmesan + green beans. Amazing dinner!

Hi, I usually avoid the dredging in flour to reduce the calories and the sauce is just as yummy but a bit thinner that way.  Also, I use at least double the capers recommended here.  Excellent go to meal and excellent with added canned or frozen artichokes and/or cherry tomatoes to increase your vegi intake - and you can skip the carb side and still have a satisfying meal!

My husband loved this dish! I’ve made it with and without the lemon. I’m not a big lemon fan so I felt it overpowered the other flavors and made it a bit tart. The recipe suffers nothing removing the lemon. I like it much better that way. This was very easy to make and I’ve done it at least half a dozen times already.

Good dish. I didn’t have the recommended fire roasted tomatoes and substituted salsa. It was OK but I will use the canned tomatoes if I make this again.

Pretty much followed the recipe as written. Adjusted it for 12 servings. Cubed the chicken and added onion, chopped garlic and mushrooms. The dish was going to a potluck so I used my electric skillet, lined the edges with rice topped with roasted veggies, piled the chicken into the center and poured the sauce over everything. It was a huge hit! Excellent.

I used white pepper in place of cayenne pepper and chicken stock instead of water. Other than those two changes, I made it according to the recipe. It was very good. Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe.  Quickly made.  (Make sure the chicken tenders are thin so they cook thoroughly).  This is really a tasty recipe.  Serve it with buttered noodle.

Liked this very much, and my young kids ate it all up.  I followed instructions as is with the only variation being that I used 1 Tbsp of dry Parsley because I didn't have fresh.  TIP: maybe it was my lemon or wine, but my sauce tasted a bit acidic, so I just sprinkled a tiny bit of Baking Soda to neutralize the acidity, and it worked.  I cooked this in a cast iron skillet, and the flavor was excellent.  Next time I may double the sauce to have a little extra to drizzle over, it seems my sauce thickened quickly.  Personally I like extra sauce & a bit more capers.  I paired this with buttered white rice, and a vegetable.

We added fresh garlic.  A suggestion is to double down on making the sauce if you plan on having a pasta with it.

I made this recipe and it was delicious! The only thing I did different I did not have any capers on hand so I salted to taste and the sauce had good balance! 

Kudos to Chef John!!

Pretty good flavor, a definite repeat dinner. I highly encourage watching the video, however, beware of Chef John's comment about "generously" adding cayenne. I went overboard the first time and it was too spicy and it over powered the other flavors. Otherwise it was excellent. For a side I made spaghetti olio (another Chef John recipe) and a salad with homemade vinaigrette.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! The lemon and wine mixed with capers and butter go so well with the crisp golden chicken. I always serve mine with linguine Alfredo and pour the lemon sauce over that as well. I’ve made this dish dozens of times and for other people who say it’s the best they’ve had.  This is hands down my favorite dish to make and the recipe is simple and easy to follow.

Dish turned out amazing! Double sauce ingredients and added diced canned artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and 4 cloves minced garlic along with the capers. Thickened it up with 3 tablespoons of corn starch/ water mixture at the end. I also cooked half the chicken in my air fryer  due to lack of pan space which turned out super juicy and yummy. Added some parsley on top as well. This will be our go to pasta dish. Thanks for the recipe!

FENOMENAL!!! this recipe didnt disappoint. I read the reviews and made some changes. Doubled the sauce, added garlic, put chicken stock instead of water and cut chicken in smaller pieces at the end and let it boil for 5 min inside the sauce. I honestly think this is one of the best chickens I have ever made :) Thanks a lot

Chef John, olives are a great substitute for capers if you have none. Loved it! Loved it so much I didn't even take a picture I ate it so quick!

I made this recipe exactly as written except that I added 3 cloves of garlic, crushed, subbed chicken stock for the water and I doubled the sauce so I could have extra for serving with angel hair pasta.  I love chicken picatta and I knew what to expect as far as the flavors.  My husband and daughter liked the recipe but near the end it was a bit much.  The lemon was very, very sharp so I think next time I would use about 1/3 less lemon juice and sub in some chicken stock in it's place.  I served it with honey and brown sugar glazed baby carrots as well as a baguette, which was necessary to deal with the extreme lemon in this dish.  I would definitely make it again, just a but milder.  Great recipe Chef John!

I made this for dinner and we really enjoyed it.  I had never used capers before so it was definitely something new for me.  I had this entrée at Olive Garden and like liked it so thought I would give it a try.  I made it exactly as written except for halving the recipe for just 2 of us.  My husband really like it also.  We like the tangy lemon flavor with the white wine and capers.  The cayenne pepper, lightly seasoned, was just right.   Tasted even better than the Olive Garden version.  Thanks chef John!  I will be making this again.

Delicious and easy dish. My first time making Chicken Piccata. I did not use wine, instead replaced it with Chicken broth. This will definitely be made again..

I made this for dinner the other night. I followed the recipe as written. I’m a very good cook usually but the sauce never thickened for me so had to doctor it a bit. Don’t think it had enough taste except for the lemon which I usually love  but this seemed a bit much. Don’t think I will make this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was good.  I felt like there was VERY little sauce though to add to pasta and drizzle on top.  It was a million times better and easier than the last recipe I tried for this though that is for sure.  Taste seemed right on for sure.

Made it twice and the first time was delicious but the 2nd time it was way too lemony. I would suggest using half as much at first then add more as needed.

Taste gets 5 stars because it was absolutely delicious and super easy to make but the sauce didn’t thicken like it should have. I had to add a little bit of flour to thicken it up.

We have been looking for a recipe that uses capers. This is a WINNER!  Very good, super easy.  Might have added a bit of extra lemon when we made it.  Next time might double the sauce.   Didn’t expect to like this as much as we did. Definitely will put in the rotation and cook for company.

Very tasty. I'm someone who likes a strong lemon flavor,  and recipes that provide max flavor to chicken breasts. I was only doing 2 breasts, but kept the amount of sauce as per the recipe, as suggested by other reviewers. That was perfect to have with the rice and veggies served with this dish. Simple and easy.

Made this recipe as is.  I don't consider myself a good cook at all, but this was easy with simple ingredients. I prepared the chicken breasts, browned them, and added the sauce ingredients on my lunch hour, put it in the fridge, then quickly finished it in the frying pan after work. We loved the dish!! Will definitely make this again and again, yum!

chef John never ceases to amaze me. As a professional chef, I'm always looking for new ideas. This is one of the best and easiest recipes i have ever tried.  Adjustment of the heat is a personal preference.  i am a big fan of using dry vermouth in place of white wine. It being a fortified wine stands up better and imparts a better flavor.  I served it over angel hair pasta.

Excellent! This much better than I have had in a restaurant by far. I added mushrooms for personal taste. It was so good. The cayenne gives it a perfect level of kick.

Very good just as written BUT why do recipes say seasoning is “to taste”? If I’m looking up a recipe then  I haven’t made it before and how the hell am I supposed to know how much seasoning to add in the start or middle of the recipe? I don’t know how the flavors will meld. ATTENTION COOKS! Don’t tell me “to taste” give me an idea of how much.

Oh my gosh, this is absolutely wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly (except i doubled the sauce ingredients because i had more chicken)and the techniques in the video.  Mine looked just like Chef John's  - wow! My husband and I had this served over brown rice. Yummy. Definitely making this again but in a deeper pan with lower heat because my range was a disaster!

This was so amazingly delicious! My hubby won't eat anything cooked with alcohol so I used white wine vinegar instead with excellent results. I also added sundried tomatoes at the very end and topped the chicken with a little goat cheese after I plated it. I will definitely be making this one again soon!

My husband said, “That sauce was soooo good!”  He was still thinking about the sauce... two hours after dinner!  As another reviewer said, I also cut calories from the sauce with less butter. Super fast and super tasty.

Great recipe! Thank you Chef John for sharing it. The only change I would make is dialing back the lemon juice. The capers add a lot of tartness already. And I put in a little more butter. Also, I used some really nice smoked paprika, didn't have cayanne.

Made without capers(didnt have any on hand). Wife thought it was a little "lemony", so may want to use a little less lemon juice (Used Realemon juice and Pinot Grigio white wine with 3/4 cup wine instead 1/2 cup). Overall great recipe and would make again.

Not a fan of capers, so I faked it by using freshly-picked thyme instead and then adding some frozen peas at the very end for the proper look. The sauce was very sour, but ended up being perfect when used sparingly, since chicken breasts have so little flavor on their own. I might try using a bit less lemon next time, and I feel like I need to try adding garlic along with the thyme. Quick and easy enough to become part of my regular repertoire, just needs those minor adjustments. No need to pound the chicken since "thin sliced chicken breast" at the store is already thin enough, and FYI one lemon gave just about exactly the right amount needed.

OMG - awesome. No changes made, it was perfect. Try it a few times with different amounts of cayenne to find what you prefer. Everyone loves this recipe.

This is my favorite dish to make! I personally use linguine for my pasta because my fiance isn't a angel hair fan (my fav) and it is actually very complimentary to the dish. I usually toss in some extra capers and I also throw in a whole clove or 2 of garlic during the saute process. I like to slice lemons very thin and use that as my lemon juice. If I feel it isn't lemony enough then I squeeze some fresh juice in too. It can be an overwhelming amount of lemon quickly though so I suggest adding it in slowly to taste. The last thing I do is use cooking white wine instead of table wine. I've tried it with both and the cooking wine really makes a difference. Lastly I like to wilt some escarole into the sauce towards the end, that's how I order it in my local Italian restaurant. I suggest making more of the sauce. I generally do 1 1/2 of the original sauce recipe. Its truly an amazing picatta recipe!

I made this recipe to the tee and I'll have to admit that it was too tart for me. I will make this again but I will make some changes so I can enjoy it more, such as, use less lemon juice.

Love it! Followed the advice of some reviewers and added fresh mashed garlic to the mashed capers. Everything else as in the original recipe. Came out delicious! It was a bit too lemony for my son, but perfect for me. After all, as others have said, it's a piccata so it should be quite lemony.

This was my first time making chicken piccata, and it was fairly easy. My husband and I agreed that next time we would reduce the amount of lemon to suit our tastes better. There WILL be a next time, as this takes dinner to an elegant place!

I think this is great. I've made it twice and it's quick and easy. My only substitution was to use chicken broth instead of water. The videos really help. It looks like a restaurant dish!

First time trying this out and it came out so good. Recipe wasn't too difficult at all. I did change a couple of small things. I added more capers because we love them. And instead of cayenne I used paprika since I have trouble with spice. It was still very flavorful with the switch. I used vinho verde for the wine. This will definitely be on regular rotation at my house.

Love this!   Alterations:  omitted the water, used kalamata olives (they, unlike capers, are a staple in my pantry), add fresh mushrooms to the sauce before reducing.    Serve with angel hair pasta.  The lemony, olive flavor is wonderful.   If you don't like lemons or olives/capers, skip this recipe.

I tried different version of piccata sauce and I always end up coming back to this recipe.  Still my husband's favorite and the easiest one to make.  I would like to thank you for posting this recipe.  We truly love it !
PROS:  THE BEST
CONS:  Too much lemon.  I use around half  what's recommended or pour small amount and taste according to your liking.

This is the most wonderful chicken piccata recipe I have tasted.  I  have been making it for years for my family and company.  Recently we had a Muslim join our family so I tried using chicken broth for the deglazing instead of wine.  It was still amazingly delicious.  I always try to cook enough to be able to enjoy leftovers the next day but there is rarely any left.  It gets eaten up no matter how much I make.

Followed recipe except added 50 percent more on the sauce ingredients.  I serve it over angel hair pasta and like a fair amount of sauce. Also, since I made the pasta, I reserved the water from the pasta to use  as the water for the sauce. One of my favorite meals.

This was one of the best chicken piccata recipes my family has tasted! It got rave reviews! I did use cornstarch instead of flour. I will definitely be making it again.

This is very good! I have made it for my Snapchat & Instagram family (ateyarich) I made it without the wine and lemon but let me tell you...with it...Awwwwwmazing flavor! I never knew cooking with white wine would make such a difference. It changed me! Forever a Wine Girl!

Best piccata I’ve had!  I did add a little heavy cream to mine at the end....only about 2tablespoons.  Great recipe chef j!  Thanks for talking about syracuse salt potatoes also-I’m from Syracuse and I was very happy reading your take from trying them!

Once again Chef John with a great recipe. This was so quick, although I did leave the salt pepper and cayenne on for a while before flouring the chicken. Very juicy.  Made it in a pan on the grill since it was a hot night.

Delicious!  The only wine I had was Moscato, but it tasted great! I followed recommendations to add garlic with the capers and use broth instead of water.  The sauce was amazing with the rice and broccoli I served with it, and I think it would be good on anything.  Even my 1-year-old scarfed it down.

The closest way to make piccata on this site in my opinion. It's easy and fantastic! Obviously be careful with the salt until you add the capers!

This is so good and easy that I made it one of my go-to dinner recipes.  I also add minced garlic after the capers, and I don't bother with buying unsalted butter.

My husband, daughter and her  boyfriend loved it!!!  Will definitely make it again.  I doubled the sauce and made a few changes.  For the water, I used the juices I had frozen from a rotisserie chicken and water.  I used 1/2 the amount of lemon, and sautéed garlic along with the capers.  It was amazing and could literally go on any kind of seafood.  Thank you!!!

I used more capers, more butter and no water. Boil up some angel hair and you're done. Just the latest in a long line of chicken piccata recipes I've made.

I've made this recipe twice now and I love it. The only different in mine is that I only had some brut champagne on hand, no white wine. No problem though, made an amazing dish still. The first time I used chicken broth instead of the water however I found the taste to be too... chickeny.. Lol. The 2nd time I used water and it was perfect!!! MAKE THIS DISH, YOU'LL LOVE IT!!

Love this recipe. I double the sauce though because I make some pasta to serve with it and there is enough to spoon over the pasta. I add garlic salt and pepper to the sauce as well. Enjoy!

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE FRESH LEMONS BEFORE YOU START!!  I was looking forward to this dish SO much ... and it actually was absolutely perfect UNTIL .... I always have lemons in house so I didn't check ... of course this time I had none.  I made the huge mistake of trying to substitute lemon juice from a bottle (YUCK!) I had to throw the sauce out .... but it was so spot on until I did that.  Will make it again next week.
BTW anyone have a clever reply for "meat and potatoes hubs" who made ugly face and asked exactly what a caper is?

I make this often and it's one of our favorites. The only thing I consistently do differently is Tony Chachere's in place of the salt/pepper/cayenne.

turned out great,  I had trouble getting the chicken breast pounded out, but they were huge.  Other than that it was great.  I'll make it again

I have made this a few times with good results. Tonight I made it again but didn’t have a lemon so I used the juice of a lime.
Great result - preferred it to lemon juice.

OK, I loved it. The kids and hubby, not as much. It was too lemony for them, so the next time I make it, I may cut down on the lemon. Delicious, easy to make, and will surely be making it again!

Chicken stock instead of water and some extra capers. A little corn starch at the end to help it thicken better because I serve it with pasta and like the sauce to cling to the angel hair pasta. So easy and so good!

Quick, easy, and tasty.  I didn't like the cayenne pepper with the lemon,  it left a strange after taste. This is one of my go to recipes.

Made it with chicken tenderloins,  was looking for a quick recipe for them. Delicious, very flavorful. Didn't have a lemon, so used fresh squeezed orange juice.

Love this meal. My daughters ask for this every week. I double the sauce and do not make any other changes. Make adjustments to the sauce if your sensitive to salt (capers, butter, pasta water).

My sister introduced me to this recipe. I fell in love!! It is delicious. We double the ingredients for the sauce. We like extra sauce. I also add some lemon juice in the sauce. 

If your looking for a side...we make a pasta side. Angel hair pasta. Cook as normal. Drain. Put back in pan/pot and add butter and olive oil to make noodles wet. Then add in chopped parsley and basil. We add quite a bit. But you can add as much or as little as you want. Then add some Parm cheese. Stir on low heat to get everything mixed and melted. I also like to add a little lemon juice to those noodles and a little lemon rind.  Then we serve the chicken on top the noodles with the delicious sauce on top it all. Love this recipe!! The noodles really compliment this dish. I recommend trying them!

I made the recipe as written except I used chicken broth instead of water. It was so simple and so good, my husband and I both had seconds. Got compliment on how good it was. I served it with buttered noodles and baby broccoli. This is definitely a keeper. It would be a great recipe for company too.

My second go at this one. Even better this time. Practice makes perfect. I added a tbs. of minced garlic after the capers and served it over linguine. This is going to be a favorite even though I make a huge mess in my small kitchen. So worth it.

I liked it a lot.  Because I love mushrooms, I did add in part of another Allrecipes recipe. I added mushrooms and some diced onions. I was low on lemon juice so I didn’t add quite what the recipe called for. In retrospect, had I added what the recipe called for, it might have been a tad too much. We liked it.

Took longer to cook the chicken than I had liked. The sauce didn't "thicken" like recipe said so luckily I had on hand some "heavy cream" and was able to add that in the wine / caper sauce to make a nice thicker sauce. Flavor was amazing.. capers and lemon make nice combination!

So yummy!  Just had to add a little flour combined with whipping cream (had it on hand, milk would probably be fine) to thicken the sauce.  Delicious!!

I keep starting this review and thinking I am hitting return I am actually clicking Done.  Sorry. I have made this recipe several times because I love how there is the slight Cayanne pepper bite. I have added sundried tomatos, artichokes, and mushrooms to this. Either all together or separately and it turns out wonderful. This recipe is easy to follow. Easy to make slight variations based on your own taste.

Simple to make with ingredients i usually have on hand. The sauce was tarter than I expected, so i added extra butter to try and tame it down. I pored the sauce and chicken over angel hair pasta and served it with a side of steamed asparagus. The whole family ate it all up.

Loved this chicken! It turned out incredible. Lemon chicken is one of my favorites and adding some capers, Chardonnay, and parsley kicked it up a notch. Loved the addition of cayenne pepper too. I’ll definitely be making this again and again.

I would love to make it again.  It tasted real good. I skipped the cayenne pepper and made enough with one chicken breast, split in half.  I've got to be careful with the pepper. I need to learn how to pound chicken better. I didn't have any fresh garlic and used minced garlic. Maybe garlic powder would be better.

Great recipe. I did not pound the breasts, so I let them cook a little longer to make sure they were well done. The capers  gave it a very nice mediterranean feel. I will definitely make it again.

Oh MAMA!!
My wife and I use to get this at an expensive restaurant over 20 years ago and they closed their doors a few years later.
We have tried different recipes but none have come this close.
This is every bit as good as the original!

12/17: slice chicken thin, no cayenne.   I used a whole lemon and it was a little too lemony, next time add half the lemon and add more later if needed.  Also used a little more chicken broth so that I would have more sauce.

Loved this recipe. I think the only thing I’ll change is to use a tad bit lemon juice.

Love chicken Piccata.  The only change I do now is I cook the chicken sous vide. I still finish in the pan then make the sauce like any chicken piccata. Its always a hit.

This was fairly easy and I am an infrequent and nervous cook.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  I didn't pound the chicken, as my chicken pieces were still a bit frozen.  I suggest flattening out the chicken as the recipe calls for, for quicker and even cooking.

I added a 10 oz. box of sliced mushrooms after heating the capers.  Then at the very end I sprinkled some flour to thicken the sauce.  I would suggest doubling the liquids and butter if you want a saucier dish.  I like that this recipe doesn't call for chicken stock, which reduces sodium content.

I have made this a couple of times and it is very delicious. I would watch the cooking time, however. Five minutes a side was too much, maybe because I used a cast iron pan...not sure. Flavor was great. I did not have parsley so I threw in some chopped scallions at the end. Also like it better with a little garlic (added with capers). I served it over a bed of spinach and my husband even liked the spinach! Success!

Super easy!   I served it with a garlic and butter rice, the one in a bag, heat for 90 seconds.  I double the sauce, of course.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely make it again, next time I will try it over angel hair

Terrific quick recipe but needed more broth at outset and needed to cook chicken more slowly to get well done, moist chicken and thick sauce.

This was amazing. I did not initially reduce the wine, lemon juice, and water enough so it took longer than 2-3 minutes to get the sauce to reduce and thicken. However, once it started thickening it was fast! Added the chicken, on low, tossed with thickened sauce and it was excellent!

This was very good! My mother says it's one of her favorite chicken recipes of all time, and that it wouldn't look odd served in a restaurant. I had a little trouble with the chicken cook-time, though; not sure if I didn't beat it down enough or what.

My customer (wife) absolutely loved this. She often claims she's tired of chicken, but she said it was the best she's had ever -- better than any restaurant. Maybe she meant "it was pretty good, for chicken", I don't know :).
I made two changes: a minor change is that I added a little chopped garlic, because what's a savory dish without garlic. The second change, bordering on heracy, is that I used chicken thighs instead of breasts because 1) that's all we had on hand and 2) (the real reason) we prefer thighs to breasts. 
Anyway, we did enjoy it and will definitely make it again.

made as written, very good and easy.  If you don't feel like pounding the chicken, take 2 fat breast-halves and slice them vertically into 2 thinner portions.

Made just as directed except added a clove of garlic (chopped).  Flavor was excellent and I don't think I'd change a thing.  Be careful how much cayenne you use if your audience doesn't like spicy.   It's not in your face hot, but I got a slow burn that lasted a bit even after I ate (I liked that, but not all may).  I found it a bit time consuming (more than the prep and cook time listed) and dirtied a lot of dishes, but the meal was delicious.  Thanks Chef John.  As always, I .....  EN-JOYED!

The recipe was great except they called for WAY too much lemon.  I used 2 tablespoon and it was still too much.  1 tablespoon would probably be perfect.  Other than that the flavor was good and the chicken turned out amazing! Will be making again with less lemon.

This was a good, quick recipe but you should adjust for the amount of lemon juice by adding 3-4 tsp of sugar to the sauce, plus a cup of chicken broth to reduce the acidity of the lemon. I added mushrooms to the sauce, and it was delicious over angel hair pasta.

This was really great! We tried to find a recipe to replace the Costco Chicken Piccata and I think we found something better (even though the Costco one is really good). We did make some changes but I think they were minor. This is what we changed:
   (1) doubled the sauce for the 4 servings, including the capers and butter
   (2) added 1 chopped garlic just after the capers
   (3) used chicken broth instead of water (might try water next time)
   (4) added an extra splash of broth to decrease the tartness after reducing (so the little one would be okay with it...and they were)
   (5) added a splash (or two) of heavy cream to make it more creamy because it wasn't as creamy as we wanted after reducing.
We ate this with zucchini noodles and it was deee-lish!

Made this on a weeknight for my husband and 2 yr old son and we all loved it! I had chicken breast tenders so I'm not sure how the proportions all worked out, but I added some crushed garlic to the sauce (right after the capers) and doubled the capers. I also increased the lemon juice to 1/3 cup. I read some other reviews and I'll try chicken broth instead of water, and will had a little Parmesan. Recipe is fantastic as is though!

Loved this recipe. I used low sodium chicken stock in place of the water. I also added artichoke at the end that my family absolutely loved.

I followed the recipe except used two large chicken breasts but all the sauce measurements. Good thing, or else there would not have been enough sauce. I also added about a cup of sliced mushrooms and sautéed them after finishing the chicken (before adding the capers). It was fabulous. As good as any chicken piccata I've had at any restaurant.

I have tried other recipes but I like the taste of Chef John's the best.  When I combine the taste and the ease of preparing this recipe, it is hands down my favorite.  I did not change the recipe as written ,with the exception of adding 3 mushrooms.  I will probably increase the sauce by 2 next time and freeze some.
Another prime example of why John is called "Chef John"!!

Instructions say "Cook until reduced by half" but the wine did not reduce.  Instructions say "Cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce."  Sauce never got thick; I poured liquid over the chicken.  Also, step 7 isn't clear.  Should I return the chicken breasts to the pan with the sauce in it, or to the empty pan?  The step ends with "Serve with sauce spooned over the top" which indicates to me that I should have put the chicken breasts into the empty pan; this instruction should be clearer.

Good, solid piccata recipe to replace my 25 year old hand written, semi-illegible one that I wrote watching Jeff Smith on PBS back in the day. Will make again.

Excellent quick and easy dinner! I did as recipe except after cooking the chicken, I added sliced mushrooms to the pan sauteed them and carried on as per recipe from there.  Oh, and I used chicken broth instead of wine and water.

This is delicious and easy.  I used 2 chicken breasts that I had split so they were thinner.

My only change was that when I seasoned the chicken I used garlic salt and freshly ground pepper.

A keeper and definitely one for company!

I made it pretty close to recipe, just added some garlic to it and used whole wheat flour for dredging and whole wheat pasta as well. I used a Chardonnay for my wine of choice. Sauce came out sweet and light. I doubled the sauce recipe to put some on pasta. Quite tasty!

I think Chef John is DA BOMB! I've been making things of his for years and all are good, but this recipe takes the cake. I made this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day, brought it over in a glass baking dish and served it with Mushroom Orzo and a Greek salad. The cayenne is a must. It aids in the bite of the caper and lemon beautifully. The only change I made was to add basil and green onions to the top for more green. My mom-in-law was absolutely tickled, no cooking for her and Chicken Piccata is one of her favorite dishes. (And mine now too) Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This is a very good base recipe. 
I did make some changes...
I used chicken broth instead of the white wine.
I dipped the chicken in a mixture of 4 eggs & 2-3 hefty squirts of dijon mustard & then dredged in bread crumbs seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper & then baked the chicken instead of frying them.
I sauteed 1/2 onion & a tablespoon of minced garlic in the butter & added sliced mushrooms.

My husband pronounced it a "keeper"!  It is so quick and easy and tastes like a dish from a restaurant, GiGi's, in Meridian, MS, that we used to enjoy so much.  It has quickly become a regular in my rotation.

It tasted good.... the "sauce" didn't thicken as recipe indicated, but I wasn't  stirring continuously, but frequently, as I had other fish to fry, as it were.  Don't know if that would've made the difference. Will try again with other versions.

This was just ok, rather bland.   I wouldn't bother to make it again.  That said, I'm so glad that I took another cook's suggestion of  using only half the lemon juice amount (1/8 cup).  1/4 cup would be entirely too much.

Love love love this recipe!! I am obsessed with the chicken piccata at California pizza kitchen and this recipe tasted just like it. I over did it with the cayenne pepper and it came out spicy but besides that the sauce was perfect. I'm definitely making this again and again.

I thought it was really good, used more capers (probably 2 Tbls) and also just bought extra thin sliced chicken to skip pounding part.  Definately make again!

This was delicious - so tasty and tender! We decided it was definitely a "company worthy" dish. The only change I made was to substitute chicken broth for the water, as another reviewer had suggested. Yum!

YUM! I followed the recipe with a few small changes to suit our tastes. I added a few cloves of minced garlic right before the capers (because we are garlic fanatics in this family) and instead of water I used chicken broth. When I added in the white wine I also threw in an 8 oz package of baby Bella sliced mushrooms for a little something extra. I served over angel hair pasta that I tossed with a bit of olive oil. The sauce is delicious and has a bold flavor for using so few ingredients. Thanks, Chef John!

This was good, I'd definitely make again.  I only used two chicken breasts but they were huge so it was like having four.  For some reason my sauce never thickened and I simmered for quite some time, but that was ok with me because I put my chicken over a little rice and the sauce flavored the rice really nicely.

So yummy!!!  I changed it a little using other people's reviews. I put chicken in egg and then in flour/panko mixture with cayenne, garlic salt, garlic powder and pepper. Then pan fried for about 3 min per side. Added garlic after heating up 2 tbsp capers. Added fresh mushrooms with a little butter and sautéed. I doubled sauce (except the lemon juice). Used chicken broth instead of water. Added a tbsp of butter to sauce after reduced. I also added a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce. Sautéed some fresh garlic and added to pasta before serving. Amazing!!!!!!

Delicious! A classic cooking technique, classic sauce, made easy. I increased the quantity (I'm feeding two teenage boys) by half and made a few small changes: I added a large clove of garlic, minced, with the capers, and used chicken broth in place of the water.  Wonderful lemony-buttery flavor, exactly as a piccata should have, and the chicken was very tender. Will add this to my rotation.

One word.  Amazing!  My father has cognitive defects and I help him cook a new recipe, of his choice, once a month to keep him engaged.  This was his best attempt so far and he was soooooo very proud of himself.  Thanks Chef John.

Delicious! I have made this twice and tweaked it both times. The first time I added extra capers and the second time I skipped the cayenne pepper. Both versions were tasty. We were not disappointed either time.

Absolutely delicious!  Every one in my family loved it- my  daughter said it was better than eating at a fancy Italian restaurant.  The only change I made was to add another 1/2 TBSP of capers and a little extra flour to thicken the sauce.

This was great!  I did add fresh garlic at the same time that I added the capers.  I also used chicken broth instead of water (as recommended by a previous reviewer).  My family enjoyed this--although they thought that it was a little spicy.  I may use less red pepper next time.

It was very good, definitely not too much lemon. It took a little longer for the sauce to thicken but that could just be my stove. I would recommend doubling the sauce though.

I don't even give this one star.  The sauce for this receipt was HORRIBLE!!!  I followed the direction step by step.  Way way to much lemon.  It was so bad that my husband and I could not eat it, and normally he will eat whatever I put in front of him.  In all the years that I have used this site this is the first time that I had a horrible experience.....

Another one of Chef John's winners. I've made this dish a dozen times and my family raves every time. I normally double up on the sauce as there is never enough of  such deliciousness.

We move capers so gave this a  . It came out great . The chicken finally came out juicy. 5 min each side was perfect and then I earned a Little more at the end . I didn't have white wine so I did without it and still tasted great !

Very easy and very tasty! I like to pour the sauce over the pasta and toss everything together. Lots of fresh cracked pepper and Parmesan cheese make this dish perfect

I had lemon Picada chicken about 25 years ago in a little restaurant in Daytona Beach Florida . It was the best lemon Picada I had ever had and I have been looking for a recipe that matched it for the last 25 years , I am happy to say this one was the closest and the best recipe that I have found yet ! Thank you Chef John for another spectacular recipe .

This was amazing! I used chicken stock to replace the white wine and the water and added one fresh minced garlic clove to the capers and oil. Served with mashed potatoes. Husband loved it too! Will make again and again!

I love chicken picatta! This is a wonderful recipe. But to those who suggest leaving out the lemon I suggest finding a different recipe. Its picatta! Leaving out the lemon completely changes the idea of the recipe all together! If you don't like what's on the ingredients list don't make it, and please don't alter it then rate it.

This is a great recipe.  My husband said it was a "keeper" and needs to be repeated.  I followed it exactly with one exception; the sauce did not thicken and I added a bit more flour at the end to make it happen.

Delicious!! My entire family loved this, kids included and I see this becoming one of my favorite dinners.  I used chicken stock instead of water and followed the rest of the recipe as written. Next time I make this I am going to add a clove of garlic along with the capers. I served the chicken and sauce over a bed of  angel hair pasta. Great recipe, thank you!!

This is a GREAT recipe with minor tweaks to the amounts of ingredients.  I have made this recipe twice.  The first time, I followed exactly and it was way too lemony/tart for our taste.  Today, I adjusted the amount of lemon juice.  I used about half of the amount listed in the recipe.  I also added extra capers (doubled the amount) because we really love capers.  
I served it with orzo topped with feta, kalamata olives, and a little of the pan sauce from the chicken.    My husband said the way it was tonight, he'd give it 5 stars!  Hope this helps!

I've only made this once and followed the recipe/video. My husband and kiddos liked it and asked for it again. It is tangy and tart but we liked it. 

I consider myself an advanced beginner cook. I thought the recipe was easy to follow and having a video helped me understand what the next steps were. My only advice is to flatten the meat as advised. I left 2 of my 4 pieces thicker than recommended and I had to cook it longer. We will make this again!

Fabulous flavor, just pay attention to the cayenne pepper.
I put a little too much on my chicken hence it was spicy.
I will definitely make this dish again.

Thank you, Chef John! I served your Piccata for Christmas Eve dinner with roasted rosemary garlic butter cream potatoes and roasted beets, and it was fabulous. The quality of the chicken breast makes a huge difference. I tried the boneless breasts from Omaha Steaks for the first time (a Christmas gift) and was very pleased--it was fork tender. I'll be making it again tonight!

Simple, super quick and delicious. This will be a go to recipe especially when I'm in a hurry. Tastes like something you would get at one of the "Name" Italian Restaurants.

Wow.  Delicious as well as quick and easy. Love one pan dishes. I followed the recipe exactly except that I tripled the capers. Served on a bed of arugula. Came out perfect.

I made chicken piccata for the first time and if came out very good! I love more salty- sour taste and made a mistake by adding twice more capers... Was a bit too much of a capers taste. Absolutely will make it again but will follow the recepie! Easy to make  and  delicious.

Great base recipe. I through a couple of teaspoons of minced garlic into the olive oil after the meat was removed (the caper mix) and would cut back only a little on the lemon juice. Keep scraping up the chicken brownings as the wine deglazes.  We added more capers at the end (family loves them). Make sure the chicken is pounded evenly as directed so that it cooks evenly. Really nice dish.

I have made this many times and it is a keeper. I sometimes add some artichoke hearts (non the marinated kind) for another layer of flavour. Thanks, Chef John!

This was so easy and quick.  The pinch of cayenne gave it just enough zip.   Don't skimp on the butter, it all came together for a yummy sauce.  I will definitely add this to my regular rotation of meals.

I love this recipe! The only change I made was to add some leftover mushrooms that I had.
I'm making this dish again tonight & I'm going to use someone's suggestion to use chicken broth instead of water.

This was the second chicken piccatta recipe I tried.  The first one was way too lemony.  I decided to try this recipe.  Since the first recipe was so lemony I decided to cut the lemon recommend in this recipe to 3 TBS.  I thought I could add more later if it needed it.  I also sauteed two garlic cloves in the butter.  Other than that I followed  the recipe exactly.  I used muscato white wine.  This turned out perfect.  the flavors melded wonderfully.  It was deliciously lemony without being over powering.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

I made this exactly as written, and served it over bow tie pasta,  with just a little butter, fresh lemon juice, parmesan cheese, and fresh parsley. Was simple, easy, and delicious! My new favorite.  Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

Searching for a chicken piccata recipe years ago lead me to Chef John's website. This is the only Piccata recipe I make now. It's perfect. To prepare it even quicker, buy chicken tenders. They are smaller, so you don't have to do the step of pounding the chicken breasts. It may be more tender that way, but it's faster with the tenders.

I've made this about a thousand times. I don't even need to look at the recipe anymore. Everyone loves it. Even my uber-picky husband. I sub chicken broth for water. This always turns out amazing. It is now my go-to pan chicken recipe.

Wow!  This was so easy and yummy!  Chef John gets it right again.  I had considerable sauce leftover for some reason. I would skip the water next time.

This has become a regular dish in my house for our at home "cheat meal".  We have it at least 2 or 3 times a month. Instead of pounding the chicken flat, I slice the breasts so they're thin enough to pan fry. I love the taste of capers, so I double the amount and the rest of the family likes it spicy, so I put extra cayenne pepper in the flour mixture.  

I also serve this over garlic parmesan pasta and double the sauce  recipe so there is enough to have with the pasta too.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Delicious and full of flavor.  Great directions and easy to follow.  The only issue I had was the sauce didn't thicken up so added a bit of cornstarch to help it along.  It has already been requested again, two days later.   Thank you for a recipe that is already a family favorite!

I've had chicken piccata many times before but this recipe was too lemony for my taste. I think next time I'd cut it in half.

Soooo good! The only variation I made from the recipe was adding a small amount of minced garlic. While my flouring technique still needs some practice (what a mess!), this dish is always delicious and everybody loves it.

This meal turned out pretty well. Slightly spicier than I expected as I used to much Cayanne pepper. My sauce was not as thick as I would like but it still tasted good.

I made less chicken but otherwise followed this recipe exactly.
I was told I better rate it a five!
I personally could have done with less lemon but i still devoured my entire plate.
This made it to the family favorites list thanks!

This is one of my favorite dishes to make.  it is also very easy.  I had used a different recipe that I misplaced and found this one.  My modifications were to not mush the capers, salted butter instead of unsalted and I used Sherry because that is all I had.  I also skipped the cayenne pepper since my original recipe didnt call for it.  It still came out delicious!  I recommend adding some lemon zest and thin lemon  slices and DOUBLING the sauce.  Even after I doubled the sauce I felt I could've used more sauce but also didn't want to dilute down the flavor.   This is excellent!

This was excellent. Even my husband who is absolutely opposed to capers liked it. I doubled the sauce and added 1 tsp minced garlic to it along with the capers. We served it over angel hair pasta. Since I'm a vegetarian, I used Morningstar Farms Chik Patties in place of the chicken and had my first chicken piccata in over a year.

My husband & I both liked this.  I adjusted the recipe to serve the two of us and substituted chicken broth for the white wine, used dried parsley and it served it over fettuccini and with steamed broccoli.  Very quick easy.  I'll make this again.

Definite hit!  I doubled the ingredients for the sauce and added cooked angel hair pasta to it before putting the chicken back in to warm.  Also, I used chicken stock instead of water, but made the rest according to recipe.  Yummy, will make again!

I followed the directions exactly and it came out delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I could put that sauce on anything and everything.

I11/6/2016 - I have made this recipe many, many times!  It is always great.  I did add some garlic at the same time I added the capers because well, garlic makes everything better!  I have also used this sauce when making it with Gardein chick’n scallopini.  My vegetarians love it.  So versatile you can put the sauce on egg noodles, boneless port cutlets or even just on some steamed vegetables.  Honestly it is one of my favorite go to recipes and I could eat it every week.

I will definitely makes this again.  The comments I received was that the flavor was just as good as a restaurant and we live in a town with many Italian restaurants.  Recipe is easy to follow and the ingredients are perfect. The only change I will make the next time is to double the sauce.  Better to have too much and not need than want more and not have enough!

Very easy and simply delicious. I like that this recipe only calls for a few ingredients and they work so well together for a light and refreshing dish. I did double the sauce and served my chicken on a bed of Farfalle pasta. It was perfect and I was very proud of it. I work at a popular Italian restaurant and this recipe was way better than the one we serve there, (not to mention way cheaper!) The only way I can see this dish not turning out is if you don't follow the recipe, it's too easy to not do correctly so I encourage all you new cooks to look at the photos to know what to expect, and if you like all the ingredients in the list I don't see why you wouldn't love this dish! Thanks Chef John, you are awesome!

I have made this twice.  First time followed directions exactly.  Was good but a little to lemony for me.  Made second time with a little less lemon and thought it was great.  Will make again.

My only change was using chicken stock instead of water & I threw in some extra capers. I used Pinot Grigio for my wine & it was so delicious & easy. It will definitely be part of my meal rotation.

Delicious and simple! Also pretty forgiving. Alterations: I used thighs instead of breasts because I love dark meat. I didn't really measure anything out, but I tried to stick to about twice as much wine as other liquids. When I went to poor in the wine I accidentally threw in the lemon juice, so I reduced both wine and juice but it still turned out great! This will absolutely be a regular meal from now on! But I may buy a splatter screen because it did splatter grease everywhere as the chicken browned.

Amazing! I decided to do 1/2 of the lemon asked in the recipe. I love chicken piccata, but I don't like too much lemon. I love thick sauce so I mixed flour & water in a separate jar and combines to wine sauce.

I have made this about 50 times now and it is ALWAYS a hit!! Only thing I change is that I double the sauce... This last time I put the noodles in the sauce with the chicken & let it simmer together for a few minutes, think I will definitely do that again as it came out perfectly saucy ;-) Great recipe!!!

This was a great recipe.   The only mistake I made was putting a bit to much cayenne on .  So some pieces were a bit hotter than the others. The flavor was wonderful. I will be making this again. 
 Thank you Chef John

I made this last night and it was delicious! I doubled the sauce and jarred the leftovers to add to pasta in a couple of days because I served mine with tomato, mozzarella, and basil perrogies and steamed whole green beans. I went a little light on the lemon juice due to reading the reviews about overcooking can cause bitterness and I also added a tsp of minced garlic after I removed the chicken, de-glazed the pan with the wine and replaced the water with chicken stock. Great recipe! Will make again.

I made this yesterday using chicken tenders, followed the recipe as written and it turned out just perfect! It's easy and takes very little time, if your chicken is on the thin side or pounded out first. I served it on a bed of brown rice that I made, using a recipe from this site. It was an oven method that turned out perfectly! I also followed that recipe as written.

Great recipe, very delicious.  You really don't need 3 tablespoons of butter at the end,  1.5 will suffice.  Also after the butter melts, best to add a little flour (2 or 3 pinches) to thicken up the sauce a little. 

Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe - finally found the right ratio of lemon, wine and butter here, and it tasted great! One change I made: I did not coat the chicken with flour. Instead, I cooked the chicken in olive oil to brown it slightly, set it aside and made the sauce per the recipe with one exception - I used low sodium chicken stock in place of the water in the sauce and the result was a nice, velvety sauce and the chicken was moist, tender and flavorful.

I butterflied the chicken breasts, breaded in Italian bread crumbs and browned in olive oil, then placed on parchment paper and put it in a 375 degree oven.  I doubled the wine, added a little fresh garlic, poured a little sauce over angel hair pasta and placed a piece of chicken on top and added a little more sauce on that. It's was amazing!!

I have made this with chicken breasts and with boneless-skinless thighs.  I prefer the thighs, just a nicer meat, less cooking time.  Family loves it.  I enjoy making it and try to put it in the recipe rotation at least once a month.

Pretty good. The lemon taste was a little strong. Next time I may try with just a little less lemon. My husband really liked it.

I make this every couple months and it always comes out great.  You can put it together really quickly after doing it a few times, and it always comes out great.  There is a lot of room for error, which is great for cooking-while-distracted. :)

Light lemony and quick! So delicious and moist and it looks like a restaurant meal! I served r with fresh spring asparagus in a garlic white wine sauce and garlic pasta to catch the sauce from the chicken. I'll definitely keep this on the rotation.

This recipe has become the dinner my children ask for on their birthday. I substituted chicken broth for the wine.

Just due to my schedule today, I needed something I could get started and finish working while it cooked - so I didn't pound the chicken, and after browning in the pan, I placed in a Pyrex dish, then after making the sauce, poured it on top, covered in foil, and let it bake in the oven.  It was ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR.  Also, I didn't have parsley, so I didn't include it.  Everything else I did exactly as recipe called for.

I think this is a great chicken piccata recipe. It turned out better when I cooked the chicken in a combination of olive oil and butter.

My husband use to make this dish using this recipe for the lighter version. He passed away two years ago so I want to continue making this dish. It was one of our keepers and easy enough so whenever the kids stopped over for dinner he would throw this dish together and serve over quinoa and sides of either a salad or grilled asparagus or broccoli.

Delish!  Definitely the best chicken piccata I have made in awhile.  I also substituted  chicken broth for the water and put the cooked chicken in the oven to stay warm while  making the sauce.

Oh my goodness this is delicious!  Just made it for the first time.  So easy, very flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I used black pepper instead of ceyanne pepper.  I wish I had made more!  
Served with French green beans and whole wheat pasta.  I put some of the extra sauce in the pasta.  Can't wait to make again!

Wow. This dish is awesome. I skipped the capers. The chicken is tender and lemony. This whole recipe is a little bit of work, but worth it. I paired it with jasmine rice.

Fantastic. Use fresh lemon juice and chicken stock in place of the water.  Doubled the sauce to add to fettuccine which I served with it  Do not omit the capers. Restaurant quality! Thank you Chef John!

Made this tonight and OMG! Added a touch of sour cream at the end, gave it the creaminess it needed, and added a little bread crumbs to the flour mixture (that I seasoned) and it was perfect. Over whole grain angel hair (sauce doubled) and a side of zuchinni, tasted like it was from a 4 star restaurant. Husband loved it and will definitely go on repeat!! Can't rave about it enough!

Very good!  Then again,  I've  never been disappointed in any of Chef John's recipe's.  A nice touch was the cayenne pepper.  I would never have thought about that with 'Lemon Piccata Chicken .'

My husband and I both loved this! I have ordered this several times out at restaurants and this recipe is easily just as good if not better than all I have tried before. This time I made it just as it said on the directions, except instead of pounding meat, I just used thinly sliced chicken breasts. I might try with artichokes next time and not use salt to season chicken. Love the flavor! :)

" Mmm, yummy.. " said my husband with the 1st bite. The kids agreed. It's a delicious chicken with a refreshing lemony flavor.
The only change I had to make was using chicken broth for the wine because of a diet restriction. Oh, and I also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, by habit.

Really good!  Makes you want keep eating even when you're full.  I increased the sauce 50% because we're saucy people.  I did add some minced garlic to the capers, and used chicken broth in place of water.   Also added some mushrooms, and a little corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit.  Served it on a bed of angel hair pasta tossed with a little olive oil and garlic salt. I put the pasta in the saute pan to mop up the last bits of sauce too.  Yum!

This is a favorite in my home, ad I do not cook without a recipe and easy access to the internet for clarification of definitions.  I skip the parsley, because it never seems to make a difference in any recipe. Other than that, I do exactly as instructed and it is a hit every time!

This is one of the very few recipes I have printed in a folder of favorites. What I do differently is I double the entire sauce, because the first time I made it I kept wishing I had more. (I  always put it over noodles or rice so maybe that's why) .. I really like bold flavor so I add a lot more capers, a little more lemon and I also add mushrooms. I  make this about about once a month. My husband and I Can't get enough!

I was tempted to make a few changes after reading reviews but I held back.  Glad I did. It was perfect as written.  I served it with lemon-pepper fettuccine tossed with minced garlic and olive oil. Delicious!

Fabulous, quick recipe! Just as the previous reviewer did, I added fresh garlic after the capers. I also added a drained can of artichoke halves  (in brine, not oil). Served over a bit of angel hair pasta with a side of fresh veggie...PERFECT!

I absolutely loved this; the kids thought it was "ok."  I agree that it's quite lemony as a piccata should be, but I toned it down a bit by adding the juice from the chicken that sat on a plate while I was making the sauce.  Will definitely make again.

We love this recipe and I've made it several times! Since we don't eat chicken, I made this using tilapia and with no other changes.  Delicious!

This is always a family favorite! For guests too. I serve this with parmesan broiled broccoli and rice. My college son asks me to bring him some every time we visit.

Yum! This recipe has become a standard in our family now. I have made it dozens of times with a variety of white wines. Creative guesswork on the ingredient amounts (when I was too lazy to run upstairs and grab my computer) has helped vary the flavor, as well.  I use a little more lemon juice and, at least, triple the amount of capers because we like it tart. This recipe also works well with any white fish. Bottom line: it's extremely difficult to ruin this recipe. It truly is super quick, easy and delicious.

Made this for a dinner party and it was excellent!  Served with a Parmesan risotto and green salad. It's a winner and much easier to make than I thought. The cayenne added just a bit of kick and my guests loved it.  Used more capers as we are big fans of them.

Came out amazing!!! Even my 6 year old twins loved the dish! I followed the recipe exactly, only took the advice of one reviewer and added in fresh crushed garlic after cooking the capers! I clearly need to double the sauce because the 4 servings listed did not make enough sauce to pour over the pasta. Other than that, definitely will be a staple in our household! Yum!

This recipe is a "keeper".  I added additional liquid, chicken broth, as well as a bit more lemon juice because I like lemon everything!  The fresh parsley gives this dish a great flavor and finish, as do the seasonings, but watch the cayenne, it  can add quite a kick if you are too heavy handed! Make sure you pound out your chicken breasts, thin is best for this dish!

What's not to like. Quick. Easy. Tasty.  Pounding the meat makes it so tender.  I like it better than veal, which I never eat these days. There are nice reductions and a final monter au beurre to make a lovely tangy sauce. Nice.

Very good!  Re: the sauce not thickening, it did take much longer than directed (probably about 10 minutes or longer) but it did thicken up enough.  It's a pan sauce, not a gravy - it's not supposed to be too thick.  I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. Quick, and easy to make. As with most of Chef johns recipes, you don't need to be a stickler and measure everything.... makes it even easier and more adaptable for your own pallet.

Will definitely make again. Bought already thinly pounded chicken. Used a seasoned flour, egg wash and parma. crumb coating. I kept these warm in a 200 degree oven. Followed the sauce recipe except added some thinly sliced shiitaka mushrooms I had when adding the wine along with the lemon rinds to get the extra flavor from the zest.  This added enough additional liquid, so I didn't add extra water.  Would double the sauce if making more than two servings. Loved the lemon flavor....hey that's what chicken piccata is all about. So fresh....so good!

I thought this dish was over-the-top fantastic for how simple it was! I love capers!! Also, the chicken came out so moist, tender, and flavorful. As a side note, it really helps to 1. press the chicken hard into the flour on all sides and 2. let the floured chicken rest for a few minutes then dust again. This helps ensure the chicken is well-coated to really retain moisture. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the lemon was a bit too overpowering. I know one reviewer said that's the point of piccata, but I don't think it was meant to be so lemony as to drown out the other flavors. I added two cloves of garlic as suggested by another reviewer, and I added powdered garlic and smokey paprika to the chicken seasoning, and I couldn't really taste the additions at all, nor the wine really (I just used white cooking wine). I'd rather taste more garlic and capers and wine, and less lemon, so next time I think I will cut the lemon juice in half. Also, I live at high altitude and it took a bit longer to reduce the liquid, so I will probably not add as much water either. Thanks, Chef John, for another restaurant-quality dish I can make myself! PS My 2-year-old gobbled this up! Even my older kids and husband said it was good, but they also voted for less lemon next time. Who says kids can't enjoy "refined" foods?

What a wonderful wonderful recipe. Only thing i did different was use chicken stock instead of water. Watch out for how much salt you add in this recipe because the capers are already salty. Also if you are a serious cook, you know that good butter usually comes salted as well, and the key to anything you make is to taste taste taste as you go. Served over angel hair, and your guests or family will never believe how easy this recipe is. Kudos to John for all of his hard work.

I love this recipe.  It is called the Quick one, but really not much different than the others....however they get a little fussier with a couple more ingredients, that are not needed.  Italian cooking is it's best in simple form as that is how it originated.   I did mix flour and water together and made a little paste to thicken up the sauce.  You can never get enough sauce!
Make this for company, you can make ahead and then just simmer in the sauce with capers until needed!

Chef John does it again! A company-worthy recipe that's also quick and easy for weeknights. I was in desperation mode tonight, trying to get something together after my 9 yr old son's basketball game. Quick Chicken Piccata recipe to the rescue! My son was too hungry to wait for the lemon/wine/butter so I just pan fried his. The final result was worth the wait (not that it took that long.) My daughters loved it, too.

Way too much lemon, sauce was tart and watery.   I doctored it up with 1/2 cup chicken stock, 1/2 chicken bouillon cube, little bit of honey, and cornstarch to thicken the sauce.   After doing all of that it was pretty good but this is not a recipe that I would repeat.

Used white whiskey instead of white wine. Turned it delicious. Will make again!

This was really good!  I feel it didn't really need the cayenne pepper, so I would leave that out next time.  To me, it overpowered the lemon and butter flavors.  Otherwise, fantastic!  Thanks for sharing it, Chef!

I loved this recipe. Instead of wine I used white vinegar. The capers make it very flavourful. I would make it again for the family. Thanks chef  john for the video.

I have probably made this recipe over 10 times now, it's my absolute go-to and I love it. When I don't have wine I use chicken broth instead, also I season the flour instead of the chicken, and I add breadcrumbs to the flour as well.

I've never cooked piccata, but like it at restaurants. Wife called it out for dinner, and game was on.... Chef John KILLS IT with this recipe! Absolutely da bomb! I served it on thinly-sliced zucchini exactly as the Chef wrote it, adding Pancko bread crumbs as one commentator recommended. Outstanding results, very easy to prepare.

Tried recipe with no changes - for x2 people. Rather than pound the filets between saran wrap (|no mallet), I sliced the breasts length-wise to get them less thick. Only thing I would change is to double the liquids for the sauce. Made very little - couldn't even simmer the white wine to reduce as there simlply wasn't enough. Very tasty dish - had it on garlic infused pasta bowties, Will definitely have again

Very good.   My sauce did not want to thicken, so I added a little bit of flour to make it happen.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was SO DELICIOUS and I made it without any mistakes! A milestone for me! My only change was to add a clove of minced garlic with the capers as some others did, because I love garlic. I was soo impressed with myself! I will DEFINITELY be making this again.

So delicious!! Almost as good as my favorite restaurant, but the reason it wasn't is that I used a cheap wine, I think. Definitely a do again, especially if you want a restaurant meal at home. Thanks, Chef John!!!

My hubby and I loved this recipe! Followed the instructions but instead of wine I used chicken broth and the chicken was soo flavorful and not too lemony at all. Served it over top of pasta that was mixed with butter and Parmesan cheese and it was just delicious! Will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

Tried this tonight and served it over fetticini.  Added grated parm. when thickening sauce and when served.  Also used fresh grated garlic after crushing capers.  The aroma was wonderful.  Did not find it too lemony.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.

We fix this twice a month. One chicken breast goes a long way for a main dish. With pasta, or couscous, or just plain rice it is a great warm dish any time of the year and quick. After you make it a few times it becomes second nature. A good dish to experiment with.

Came out great. I usually don't like breasts as they can come out dry but they were so moist.    I listened to some of the other reviews and added less lemon juice. The only problem I encountered  was the sauce didn't thicken. Wasn't an issue though.  Will definitely make again!

I used chicken thighs since they were already thawed. Delicious and tender! I didn't have capers on hand but it didn't need them. Thanks, Chef John!

Watched the video and then made this for dinner tonight following the recipe exactly.  WOW!  This was the best Chicken Piccata!  My husband normally will not eat capers but tonight he totally cleaned his plate!  I will definitely be repeating this again!  Very quick and easy to prepare.  Served over homemade noodles.  Would not change anything.

The sauce is delicious so the next time I make it I think I will double the sauce. Since I was just making a quick weeknight meal, I used chicken tenders instead of pounding out chicken breasts. I also added tomatoes, fresh garlic and chicken broth instead of water.

This was SO delicious!  A big hit with friends at a dinner party.  I left out the parsley, used lime juice/lemon juice blend & extra wine.

Wow! What a flavorful dish. This is the first time I cooked with wine, well, by putting it in the food, and capers too! Tasty little things they are. I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband loved it. This recipe is a keeper.

I saved time by slicing the chicken horizontally as I detest pounding meat. Instead of black pepper, I used lemon pepper. Awesome recipe!

I thought this was great!  It was too much lemon for my goulash,tacos and steak loving boys but I figured that would be the case. Too bad for them. More left overs for me! :-)

Try using corn starch instead of flour, or Wondra works well, too. It's lighter, clumps less, and combines easily with other dry ingredients. It's a great starter recipe that anyone can change to their liking.

This dish came out delish! Had to make it gluten free for company, used King Arthur's Glutenfree multipurpose flour, and even gluten free it was great! I made extra sauce with lots of extra capers just because I love them! I sliced a few lemon rings as let them simmer in the sauce for the last minute or two to add flavor and for presentation. Will make again...   And again and again! Thanks Chef John. Mmmmmmm.

I made this for dinner tonight. For anyone who doesn't like white wine just substitute chicken broth. If you don't like lemon, eliminate it. I made it without the lemon and wine and it turned out delicious. Love the capers!

This is one of my favorites! So delicious, quick and easy! I add a bit of Lemon Zest and more Capers and a little chicken broth as I serve it over Spaghetti, needing a little more sauce. Maybe the broth cuts the Lemon a bit?
Thank you Chef John!

I followed the recipe except I am not big on too much lemon juice and cut that in half. Probably could have used just a touch more. I thought it was a pretty decent recipe. My husband was not overly enthused but my 19 month old ate some so that says something! I am getting over a cold so my taste buds are a bit off so I have to make this again to see if I change the star rating.

Soooooo yummy!  I added 1 tb of sugar to the sauce to cut back on the acidity.  I halved the olive oil, and didn't have parsley, so I chopped up some spinach!  I love this this recipe and have made it a few times!

We really liked this recipe. It was tart as another reviewer stated but I liked the tartness. I thought the sauce would be thicker and was wondering if it wasn't because I used salted butter.  That is all I had.

I've made this 4 weeks in a row now. My family loves it!! I change the servings to 6 for the sauce ingredients.  I also use thin sliced chicken breasts from my local store.  Make sure you have some sourdough bread to sop up the sauce. A must!! Love it!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and enjoyed it quite a bit. I did, however, find the lemon juice really overpowering. I will make it again, but with less lemon juice & possibly substitute chicken stock for the water.  I served over angel hair pasta.

I doubled the recipe and served over spaghetti, adding grated Parmesan cheese with the parsley. My family loved it! I substituted chicken broth for the water, and added grated shallots just because we adore onions! Thank you for a fast and easy dish that leaves no leftovers!

This recipe was superb and easy enough.  This is one of my favorite dishes at Italian restaurants and this was right up there with those.  My hubby loved it and said it was"gourmet". My 8 year old said it was fabulous too. I left the cayenne pepper off of hers though to be in the safe side.  The sauce was very delicious and chicken was flavorful too. Winner winner chicken dinner!

This is one of those times I wish allrecipes had a 4.5 star rating. This was a really easy but really delicious recipe. The sauce has a great flavor, but it's strong. I made the mistake of pouring a lot of sauce over the chicken when serving, and it was too much. Part of that was due to the really strong lemon flavor -- and I can believe I'm typing this, because we all LOVE lemon. But it overpowered some of the other flavors so next time, I'll reduce the lemon just a little bit. But overall, just a really good recipe. Thanks!

I followed the recipe to a T. Way too much lemon juice and too much Italian seasoning for our taste. Next time if I try it will be 1 tsp of seasoning and probably 1/3 cup of lemon juice.

I made this exactly as written. Husband loved it!  The cayenne made it especially yummy!  Will be making it again for sure.  I made it for just my husband and me.  Not sure how children would like the intense flavors.

Goes together quickly but tastes like you spent much longer. 
Start some rice before you begin this recipe and they are ready to bring to the table together. 
The whole family enjoyed it!

I followed the recipe to the letter. This was quick, easy and delicious. Perfect weeknight meal and I'll do it again. I like the idea of adding a bit of fresh garlic with the capers but it was very good as is.

First time giving a review. My husband is a great cook and was raving about this recipe! Made as is and would not change a thing. Daughter loved it too, although next time I will go light on the cayenne, little spicy for her...think I added more than what was called for. Loved it!

I couldn't get the video to load so had to just follow the recipe instructions. Like others I couldn't get the sauce to thicken to a consistency I like. But I always keep corn starch on hand and was able to quickly create a thickening agent to add. I like a tart piccata so the flavor was perfect and yes - absolutely added garlic. It was very good, I will make it again. Dropped one star for needing modifications to recipe.

I agree with others that the full amount of lemon juice is too strong. I will at least half the lemon juice next time, if not cut out a little over half. It was, however, very good. I fixed with orzo and broccoli. I doubled the juice and that was the right amount of sauce for us.

Thanks Chef John for the great recipe.  I had it with Basic Microwave Risotto from this site.  One of the best meals I have had in a long time and I cook alot and get alot of recipes from Allrecipes.  I have to say if I see one that you submitted I always check that one our first.  And, this one is GREAT!

My family and I loved this chicken.  I didn't have parsley so I used fresh oregano and rosemary from the garden instead.  I served it over penne pasta.  I will make this again.

Very tasty and delicious I doubled it since I cooked for two people and we are big eaters in our house. To pass along a tip, I always use wondra flour when making any cutlet dishes or fish dishes that call for dredging them in flour.  It makes any cutlet very light and I find it to be very consistent

This is one of my favorite easy meals. I serve with rice. It is amazing just as it is. I make this at least once a month. Sometimes I do the flour most often I skip the flour. Either way it is great.

Chicken piccata is one of my favorite dishes to order going out to dinner.  This recipe was almost, with my cooking, as good as at my favorite restaurant;  The only thing I added was some thin slices of the lemon when added to the wine etc.

I loved this recipe and it was super easy and quick to make. Used chicken stock instead of wine since my hubby and I don't drink alcohol. My hubby didn't really care for that much lemon in the sauce (I loved it though) so next time I make it for us I'll cut back on the juice. Will add crushed garlic next time as well but overall, definitely a keeper!

My husband loves all the Chef John recipes, and this is no exception. I used skinless boneless chicken thighs we happened to have, and fresh cilantro in lieu of parsley, since that is also what we happened to have. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Delicious! So easy!

I have made this twice now and my family loved it. I loved how easy it was. I used Marcella wine instead as  I. Didn't have any white wine in hand. I also went light on the lemon juice. It came out wonderful.

Loved this recipe.  Was easy and delicious.  I actually didnt use the flour and only had an 1/8 bup of wine so i used that and upped a little water.  Was delicious!!!!

I used chicken stock instead of water, champagne instead of wine, and creole seasoning instead of cayenne pepper.  So yummy!

Chef John you have given me a keeper!  I did make a few changes in my own recipe which included bonless chicken thighs instead of breasts (jucier), I added fresh minced basil, about 4 tablespoons of fresh minced parsley, substituted chicken broth for the water, tempered (poured a little of the sauce in a cup, added flour, whisked and returned to broth) the sauce, used a whole bottle of capers, and instead of dredging with flour, i seasoned the flour inside a paper bag and coated my chicken that way.  The excess flour was used when I thickened the sauce.  Other than these changes, I loved it! I think I will use a little minced garlic as was suggested from another fellow Allreciper.

Nice flavour.  Easy to prepare.  However, could use a bit more bite, so next time I will add some garlic, and also more  capers and maybe a bit more cayenne pepper.  I had the large capers and crushed them in the pan, as the recipe says, but would advise perhaps first halving or chopping them.  Also, when creating the sauce, it does not thicken, but it was fine.  Guess you could add some flour (there will be some leftover when you coated the chicken) if you want to further thicken the sauce.

I already have it in my recipe box. I made it tonight  for the first time and we loved it. I added baby portabela mushrooms and sour cream and I used less lemon after reading some of the reviews. It was perfect. I made it over farfalle pasta. The chicken was so tender and the sauce was absolutely delicious. I will make it again. Thanks Chef John. I always follow your recipes.

I have made this twice now. Simple and wildly popular in my house. Served it with brown rice pilaf and sautéed spinach. I seasoned the chicken with a bit of creole seasoning. Great variation.

Followed the recipe as written and it was delicious and so easy. My husband said it is definitely a keeper!

By the way I will be making one of our favorite recipes from Chef John this weekend. Jinx Free Braised Lamb Shanks with cinnamon and balsamic vinegar. Such an awesome recipe! Can't wait!

This is a delicious, easy recipe.  The only things I did different were mixing the salt/pepper/cayenne in with the flour before dredging and using salted butter and dried parsley flakes.  It turned out great!  I served it with white rice and asparagus.  I loved the piquant flavor of this dish and so did my husband.  Will definitely be making this one again.

We made this recipe last night and loved it! I made a few changes:
1. I pounded the chicken a bit flatter than called for  - I basically went as flat as I could go without damaging it.
2. I seasoned the flour instead of the chicken and I dipped the chicken breasts in egg to keep the flour from falling off. 
3, I used less than half the butter called for when thickening, and I made up the volume difference with a bit more EVOO. My sauce still tasted wonderful!

For wine, I used a Rex Goliath Chardonnay and drank the remainder with dinner. Yum!

Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this tonight and my husband raved about it.  I was surprised because lemon and capers are not his favorite thing - but this recipe is wonderful.  There is just the right amount of lemon and capers.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I did not have fresh parsley.  I can't wait to try it again with fresh - but even with dried parsley, it was wonderful!   (I used a chardonnay.)  I served the chicken with Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic and Easy Baked Rice.  Great recipe, easy to do - and absolutely delicious!

Oh my! This was SOOO wwonderful!  It was easy to throw together but tasted like you spent a lot of time on it. The only change I made was to use chicken broth in place of the wine and water (I never cook with alcohol) and decreased the lemon juice some so it wasn't overpowering. Perfect and company worthy dish! I served over angel hair pasta. Delicious!

Omg if I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! Made it exactly as recipe says. Maybe next time I'd do a little less lemon juice and a little more wine. Or maybe not! It was the best chicken the husband and I have had in a while! Yum yum yum!

Loved the recipe overall but found it too lemony.  Next time instead of 1/4C of lemon I'll add 3T and see how that goes.  I also used chicken broth instead of water for a bit extra flavor and I used 1/2 cup as we like the extra sauce.  It cooked down beautifully.  Also, I'll also only season one side of the chicken with cayenne as seasoning both sides seemed to have a bit too much bite for my children.  The leftovers are delish!

I've already posted a review, but I had to report in.  Tonight I made it again as I needed a quick meal and had all the ingredients.  But I forgot to add the butter at the end.  It's better with butter, of course, but if that's what might be keeping you from trying it, never fear. It was still very good!  I served it with basmati rice and steamed green beans.

Excellent and easy.  Did not have to return the chicken to the pot at the end.  And to save time, I combined the butter, water, lemon juice and water together in the microwave together.

My new favorite!!! I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, riesling for my wine, and did not add the salt, capers add plenty of salt for me. Served that with angel hair pasta and can't think of anything I would do different next time. Maybe add garlic but not sure cause I'm so in love with the flavor of this. Definitely will make this again!

Followed the directions with the exception of making a little more sauce...adding a little more water and a little more flour didn't hurt the taste.  Also, I used brown rice flour since we're more conscious of gluten these days.  Perhaps it's the lack of gluten that allows this four to mix easily with no clumping.  Also used it to make gravy for the prime rib we had at Christmas and it was perfect!

Great quick and EASY recipe. I added a little bread crumbs to the flour while drudging as well as a pinch of minced garlic to the sauce. It was awesome!

Words cannot describe the deliciousness of this! 
True confessions: I doubled the chicken and TRIPLED the sauce (what can I say - I love lots of sauce.) AND I ate it with a SPOON so I would get every drop of that amazing sauce! Maybe it'll start a trend, huh?
Chef John does it again! Thank you for your 5 star recipes!

Easy to make and delicious!  The only ingredient I did not have on hand and had to purchase were the capers. A nice change from the usual.  I did not have a pounding device for my chicken, so I just sliced them in half length-wise, which worked out fabulously!  I wasn't a fan of the cayenne; it didn't add to the flavor, just gave it an underlying heat, which didn't add to the dish's overall success. I will most likely omit it next time.  I served it with orzo and it was delicious!  One of those dishes that people will think you slaved over, but you didn't :-)

I make this recipe really often, I would say at least one a month maybe twice.  First, be sure you are starting out with really high quality chicken.  I've made it with regular breasts from my local grocery and then with free range chicken breasts from a store in our area, New Seasons.  World of difference.  Good poultry is, in my opinion, worth a little extra money to get off to a great start.  I follow the recipe exactly as written, to the letter, and absolutely love it.  It's fresh and relatively simple and well worth repeating.

Followed it to the T and it was delicious! Only next time I'll add more capers as it really gave it great flavor (and leave out the wine and cayenne so picky kids will eat it.)

super fast and delicious.  Made it for guests.  I cut the breasts in half to make them thinner instead of pounding them.  Turned out great.  Definitely will make again.

Was super easy to make and turned out delicious. Didn't use any measurements, just followed the ingredients, substituting the water for chicken broth like someone else suggested. Definitely used more wine and broth (water) than suggested, and squeezed the juice from half a lemon which was MORE than enough, maybe a little too much. Also not a big fan of capers, so omitted those completely, added mushrooms and garlic instead. Also tossed in some angel hair pasta once the sauce and chicken were in the pan together. Came out better than expected :)

I always count on Chef John’s recipes to be among the best, but this one was a disappointment.  After reading the reviews, I agree that the lemon is a little too aggressive.  I cut the chicken breasts into medallions as I always do and that works out wonderfully.  I think the results would have been better if the water had been replaced by chicken broth.

Wow!  What flavor!  Don't forget to use the cayenne pepper also.  It adds such a unique flavor to the dish.  We will have this again often.  Only had one very large breast for two of us (DH and me), but it went well.  Served with rice and a salad.  Yummmm.

Hubs and I loved this dish. I've made it with other recipes and like this one best. I only changed water into chicken stock (never add water to a savory dish). Maybe this could help those who thought it was too much lemon. Upon further evaluation, I think the lemon should be reduced by half.

Too acidic as written. Would have been just fine with just a squeeze of juice from half a lemon. I saved it by adding a cup of chicken broth and another T of butter. . I'll try something else with my chicken next time.

This was easy and tasty. Except for the capers, I usually have these ingredients on hand so will definitely make again. I may add a little more pepper and cayenne next time. As good as any restaurant!

This was the best ever - both my husband and I loved it - he took the leftovers for lunch the next day! I followed the recipe exactly the first time, the second time I added mushrooms and lemon slices to the pan and used chicken broth instead of the wine (we don't keep white wine at home) and doubled the sauce! Not only is it going to be in my regular rotation, it's good enough to serve guests! Thank you so much for sharing! Just simple green beans and a salad round it out!

I rarely comment on recipes but this one is truly awesome!  Even my 'foodie' boyfriend was impressed.  Easy and quick to prepare.

Delicious! I made this once and added a small can of drained mushrooms(or fresh chopped mushrooms if you'd like) and jar of marinade artichoke hearts (drained) into the sauce before I add the chicken back to the pan.  I also cut the amount of lemon juice because it was a bit too powerful for our taste but add a little more capers. It is now a favorite in the house.

Simple, easy, and tasty. All ingredients are standard household items except for the lemons, too. I used this as a nicer weekday dinner than other no-fuss meals. I did not have any capers and saw no reason to get them. It turned out I was out of cayenne pepper, so I used a zesty lemon seasoning I had instead. Since it contained salt and pepper, I omitted the salt and pepper as well. I only had a chicken pack of three, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same. Yummy, and a very nice treat for a quick and easy weekday meal. Many thanks for submitting this recipe.

This was very very good....I made it awhile back with chix and tonight I'm swapping out the chix for pork tenderloin.  I just have to make sure I have at least 1 cup of white wine on hand....1/2 for the recipe and the other half for.....none other :o)

OMG, I just finished making this dish and it is out of this world. I always say to my husband "I can't cook at home like the restaurants" but this one tastes just like you had a chef in your kitchen. I will be making this one for all my friends and family. 
Thank you Chef John!!!

My favorite recipe right now! I often double the sauce and serve with mashed potatoes. So easy & taste fabulous. Only changes I made was to butterfly the breast instead of pound them & add extra capers.

As many reviewers have stated, the amount of lemon really overwhelms the dish. That said, I feel that the lemon can be adjusted to person taste. The sauce was quite runny, but I wonder if this is due to the high  altitude of the state I live in...?

This was delicious! I followed the recipe with the exception of the lemon juice. I reduced the amount and only used 3 Tbsp. as other reviewers suggested. It was perfect! This is one I will make again and again. Quick, tasty, filling and a refreshing change to basic chicken breast and pasta. I did serve it over thin spaghetti and a side of steamed veggies. Thanks for a great recipe Chef John!

Loved it. I'm gluten free. And this was so easy to adapt. I dredged in bob's red mill all purpose gluten free flour and served with rice instead of noodles for me. Served my family the noodles which I tossed with butter, garlic salt and pepper. I had three large chicken breasts...and when pounded they were very large so I cut them in half giving me 6 nice size breast pieces one for each person plus extra.  I added more cayenne pepper to my husband's chicken breast because he likes every thing spicy!...mine I sprinkled lightly with the cayenne and i loved the kick...the kids I left it off completely! Everyone (all 4 of us) devoured every bite and we had 2 1/2 chicken good size breast pieces left for sandwiches or too put on top of a salad tomorrow. I will definitely make this again. Served it with a wedge salad.

Tried this Saturday night.  Yum!!!  Changed one thing, added mushrooms, Baby Bella’s.  Sautéed them up in olive oil and butter, salt and pepper.  Removed them from the pan and then did the chicken.  Added the mushrooms back to the pan just before adding the chicken to warm.  Really added to the flavor of the whole dish.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

This is really great! I pounded my chicken a little thinner and because I used really big, thick breasts, I only used 2, then cut them in 1/2 to make 4 cutlets, but doubled the sauce to have extra for the pasta. If you are having trouble with this, watch the video of Chef John's. This has a video link under the picture, but here's a url: http://allrecipes.com/weblink/63560143/video-quick-chicken-piccata---allrecipescom/detail.aspx 
Follow Chef John's instructions and you won't go wrong!

I was dissapointed with this. As another reviewer had stated, my sauce did not thicken and the only flavor was LEMON! It was "meh" for me.

I agree with many of the reviewers, too much lemon flavor and it did not thicken up.  I was hoping it would be like the Chicken Piccata that Cheese Cake Factory has...the BEST.  I may try again, but would cut the lemon in half and add cornstarch to thicken.

This was perfect, Just used paprika instead of cayenne in the flour before dredging.

This was a hit with people who love intense tastes and simple food.  I made two changes:
- I kept the cooked chicken warm at 200 degrees while the sauce was cooking  That way, all had hot food - even those that did not want a lot of the sauce.
-I doubled the recipe for 4 and the left overs were great.
Total, easy hit just as is!

This was fantastic!  The only change I made was to substitute chicken broth for the water, and used more than the recipe calls for, since we like our sauce.  My entire family enjoyed this, including my very picky 12 year old daughter.  My husband commented that it was unlike anything he had ever tasted (in a good way!)  This is definitely a keeper!

This was good. Super easy. My sauce was a little watery (idk if it was suposed to be this way) but it went well over pasta. I also didnt dredge it in the flour, but still very good. Thanks!

Average as written but had to balance the acidity. I thought I would give this a try since I had some capers and wine to use...I was the only one that can tolerate the tangy sauce.  My family had to pass....

This is the first time I made this dish; my kids loved it! Instead of using cayenne pepper fearing that it would be too spicey, I used hot sauce...and I am glad I did.  The sauce gave it an extra kick with extra flavor.  This one is a winner.

This was so easy and so delicious. I made this for my family, I double the wine added some chicken broth because I wanted more sauce & a whole stick of butter. I bought capers that was stored in Balsamic vinegar.I will repeat this recipe again... I added chicken bullion to the sauce too along w/ some garlic & onion powder. I served this over angel hair pasta & roasted asparagus roasted & wrapped in procuitto bacon.

Love Love Love this recipe!!!!!   The only trouble I have is at the end I don't seem to have any sauce to spoon over the chicken and pasta.  Improvised and served pasta with white clam sauce on the side!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

This was amazing! My boyfriend ate so much I didn't think he could get out of his chair. I did use chicken broth instead of water and breaded the chicken cutlets with italian bread crumbs, but the rest of the recipe was exact! Will make MANY times again!

Made it exactly as the recipe says.  Unfortunately, I found out that no one in my family, including me, likes capers.  The chicken tasted fine, just not with the sauce on it.  Oh, well.  Can't like everything!  If you love capers or lemon, this is the one for you!

My husband was the one who found the recipe and decided to try it. I don't even like chicken breast and this turned out AMAZING!
We added a little bit sugar since the sauce was a tad too sour for us.

Brilliant.  ... yet another "must do again" from my wife.  Thanks for an elegant but "quick" main course!

This recipe is company good! I've used a white zinfandel when I didn't have a basic white wine.  It makes the sauce kind of pink but same fabulous flavor!  You have a real winner in this one, Chef John!
I generally double the sauce and thicken it with a teaspoon of cornstarch when I add the water.  People almost pick the plate up and lick it.......it's that good.  Also taste-test the sauce when I'm cooking it to get a balance between the tartness and see if it needs a tad of sugar to round it out.

It is recipes like theses that keep me coming to all recipes!  Simple, tasty and something that I have never made before.  I took other reviewers advice and added garlic, chicken broth and extra capers.
I will make this again.

Great Recipe! I am an amateur chef and decided to try my beginners luck with this recipe. It turned out great!  The chicken was moist and delicious. Next time I will use a little less lemon juice and cayenne pepper as the sauce was a bit tart/spicy for my liking. Even my picky boyfriend said it was delicious. Thanks for the great video Chef John!

Delicious. I was craving chicken piccata and in 30 minutes I was satisfied completely. I used 1/8 cup fresh lemon juice and it was quite "lemony" - 1/4 would be too much for my liking. 4 year old said it was the "best chicken I ever cooked". :-)

S'wunderful!  Made it tonight for my Italian-American husband and he loved it!  GREAT blast of flavor.  Served with a bottle of South African Sauvignon Blanc, a good crisp partner to this flavorful dish.  This will be a staple in our home....and a dish for guests!

This was decent. I served over pasta that I made a quick sauce for (lemon juice, wine, chicken broth, garlic, thickened with a bit of Wondra flour). My son was the only one who didn't love this, and we figured out that it's because he doesn't like capers.

The chicken was great but the sauce..just too much acid.  I followed this exactly and I just didn't like the taste.  Next time I make this I will probably add a lot less lemon juice and capers and maybe a little cream.

Really good recipe.  I have always added capers at the very end - just long enough to heat through.  Good either way.

Three stars as is.  Was a good base but a little too intense on the flavors.  I will make it again but reduce the amount of caper and the lemon to butter ratio.

Tried this recipe, with the only thing left out was the fresh parsley at the end... I just sprinkled some generic "Italian Seasoning".  I enjoyed the meal completely!  I had left overs and the next day it was even better.  The flavors were exactly like some of the better 'piccata' dishes I have had dinning out.  I will keep this handy for guests as I usually keep most of these ingrediants handy anyway.

This is an absolutely phenomenal recipe!  It was fast and delicious.  This will become a regular on my weekly dinner menu.
