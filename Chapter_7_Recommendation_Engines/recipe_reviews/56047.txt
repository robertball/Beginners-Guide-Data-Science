Here is one way to test for sweetness:  "Egg Test for Sorbet.  The best sorbets are made not by exact measurements, but rather by balancing the sweetness of a particular batch of fruit to assure the best flavor and consistency. Too much sugar will prevent the sorbet from freezing and will overwhelm the fruit; too little makes an unpleasantly tart, icy sorbet. To achieve the optimal balance, rinse a raw egg and carefully drop it, in its shell, into the fruit mixture. When the mixture is in balance, the egg will be partially floating, exposing a circle the size of a dime to a nickel above the surface." (Tip from food website.)

Refreshing and tasty! I made a simple syrup with a half cup water, half cup sugar, heating until dissolved, and opted for a true sorbet by omitting the cream - although it would make a very nice frozen dessert with it.  I always taste the fruit first, and since my berries were sweet I knew the reduced sugar would work in this.  I pureed the blueberries, raspberries and blackberries in my blender - maybe a food processor would grind the seeds better, but I definitely needed to strain the mixture to get the seeds out.  It was a little soft when done - perhaps because I used fresh instead of frozen fruit? - but I popped it in the freezer for about 20 minutes and ended up with the firmer texture I was looking for.  Will definitely make this again!

This is so good! I used 3/4 cup regular white sugar with the 1 cup water and a bag of frozen mixed fruit with the heavy cream and it was so good.  It froze perfectly in the freezer after I took it out of the ice cream maker.  Will make this a lot over the summer!!

Excellent!  I changed this a little -- I used strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, sugar instead of Splenda, and half & half.  It turned out great.  Next time, I will probably cut the sugar down to a 1/2 cup if I use strawberries again.

This is a very good combination of flavors. Being a Splenda user, I believed the 1 cup quantity was too much so I cut it back to 1/2 cup. For my taste, that seemed about right. The second time I made this, I used 1 cup vanilla yogurt and that is awesome! Thank you for this recipe, Pamela.

I made this sorbet with all blackberries since I had so many left over from baking a pie. I used organic sugar instead of Splenda and it came out awesome! I will use this recipe again. Thank you!

This recipe is great! The texture and the taste was wonderful. I LOVE rasberry sorbet so instead of blackberries and blueberries, I only used raspberries. Also I used regular white sugar. I also used heavy whipped cream, but for my next batch I am going to omit it for more of a sorbet taste.

This recipe is *very* sweet; unless you have an incredible sweet tooth, cut the Splenda down to about 3/4 cup, or add a couple tablespoons of lemon juice.

Made according to recipe, only adding 1 tbsp. of fresh lemon juice and subtracting one tbsp. of water from the cup of water. I felt the finished product was a little too sweet but my boys liked it as is. Next time, I'd like to cut the sweet in half and see how it turns out.

I used fresh blueberries, blackberries and strawberries and real sugar instead of Splenda. I did not use the cream. The flavour was very nice but all those seeds made it intolerably 'gritty'. I ended up putting the pureed mixture through a very fine sieve to strain out about 90% of the seeds but it was still a bit 'sand-like'... I think it's a personal preference whether you can handle that. Most of my family really enjoyed it though and it definitely looked beautiful garnished with a bit of mint and a few whole berries.

I used all blueberries. I didn't want my sorbet to freeze rock solid so I used half vodka and half water to make the sugar syrup. My berries were very sweet so I only wound up using half of the syrup. This was excellent served with a lemon tart.

EXCELLENT & BEAUTIFUL color sorbet.  I used fresh raspberries that I picked yesterday.  Also used 1 cup of regular sugar instead of the Splenda.  Then followed the rest of the directions.  In my opinion, this recipe wasn't too sweet for me with the full cup of sugar.  I will make this again & again.

Very good sorbet. I added the full cup of sugar, but with 2 teaspoons of lemon juice, but it was still too sweet.  I agree with the other reviews that 3/4 cup of sugar or less would be suficient. I will be making this again.

I used fresh blackberries from our garden and supplemented with a mix of frozen berries that I let thaw.  After pureeing, I strained it through a sieve.  This took some time but I'm glad I did it because most of the little seeds were removed.  Great berry flavor and a really nice texture.  Thanks for sharing a good recipe!

OMG this is sooo good! Me being me, I tweaked it to being full fat/sugar by exchanging spenda for sugar (and warming to make a sugar syrup) 1/2 cup more of berries and 1 whole cup of cream.  So perfect! You must try

This was a great base, but 1C sugar (or splenda) would be too much.  Per other reviews, I only used about 1/2C and thought it was perfect.  Just taste as you go!

I made this with 1/2 cup Splenda and 1 cup water, and left out the heavy cream. It was still way too sweet. If I make it again, I will leave the sugar out altogether.

This is an awesome recipe! I did make a couple changes though. I substituted all the berries for 3 1/2 cups blueberries and after reading some reviews I made a simple syrup out of 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup white sugar. I did add the heavy cream and I'm glad I did. It made the sorbet have a rich, smooth taste. I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious but MUCH too sweet!  Definetly reduce the sugar but otherwise, it was pretty tasty.  I did not have an ice cream machine so made a thick smoothie.  Very good!

This never set up.  I make ice cream and sorbet on a regular basis and never have a problem.  I got so frustrated, I left it on my porch.  I got an interesting berry wine, though.

I made this using a bag of mixed frozen fruit and berries without the cream, and I cut the sugar in half. It turned out great, like a really fruity awesome sorbet!

I agree the sweet factor is too high!!! I taste tested along the way and a cup would have been way too much! I used frozen strawberries and resberries and a few fresh blue beries and it was umm umm good! I used no cream as I am alergic it honestly it didn't need it.

I just made this berry sorbet!!!  OMG I used only 3/4 cup sugar and 1 cup of water which I warmed on the stove to dissolve the sugar and then cooled.  Mixed the berries with the sugar syrup and added my homemade yogurt instead of heavy cream. It's in the freezer getting nice and thick.  Will surprise my DH tonight. Will definitely make this all summer. I always have frozen berries in the freezer.

Great! I put 3/4c sugar, all strawberries and fat free 1/2 and 1/2.  IT was wonderful, but a little too sweet.  Next time put maybe 1/2 cup sugar.

I made the recipe for someone who had gastric surgery and is trying to eliminate sugar from his diet. I followed the recipe except for the heavy cream. I used someone’s suggestion of substituting vanilla yogurt. The person I made it for loved it and asked for the recipe. He did mention that when he makes it he will use half the sugar. Thank you for the recipe!

Did my own version with various bags of fruits and berries leftover in the freezer.  Didn't even need the splenda water .  A bag Pineapple did the trick.  Sugar and fat free.  :)

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly using Splenda. Wow! Super Delish! I was so inspired I bought an ice cream maker to incorporate more of these healthy desserts into our lifestyle. 
The second time I made it using my new toy, I used blueberry pomegranate juice in my fridge and eliminated he Splenda altogether. My family loved it. The Pom juice gave it more depth of flavor. I only changed the recipe because it didn't want it to spoil in my fridge. Thanks for a great recipe!!It will be many times more!!

This is a great recipe and you can use it with many fruits. I didn't use cream since I wanted a refreshing recipe and also cut down the Splenda to half a cup. It turned out to be a great sorbet! I used it with frozen mixed tropical fruits and was great too!
