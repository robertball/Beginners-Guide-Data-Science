I actually got this recipe from another website - and in the "tips" section, a person who had worked at this particular restaurant said that they were making the mexi-ranch dressing way too hard.  At the restaurant, if they would run out of the sauce, they would make it by hand by simply mixing equal parts ranch dressing and salsa, then adding a bit of chopped cilantro.  This is what I do and it is delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly otherwise and this is one of my family's favorite meals.  Also, if you want it to taste like the restaurant version, you MUST use liquid smoke.

This is a very good recipe,  but the mex sauce really doesn't need to be all that complicated.  Just do it like they do.. Just mix ranch dressing and your fav salsa together.  Really thats all they do ;-)

By far my favorite recipe I have ever found on the Internet. The first 2 or 3 times I made it I used regular Mayo and Sour Cream, but now that we are watching what we eat I used light mayo and no fat sour cream and I cannot tell the difference what-so-ever!

Because I BBQ the chicken, I don't add the liquid smoke, and I also substitute the tomato, peppers and onions with a heaping tablespoon of salsa. Other than that I keep the recipe as is and we LOVE it!

I would hate to be the restaurant near us that serves this dish because I haven't returned once to the restaurant to have this dish once I found this receipe!

I followed the recipe pretty close.  I didn't have any teriyaki sauce so I used Hoisin, soy, sugar and some stir fry sauce (only in place of the teriyaki).  Other than adding some chopped green onion, the rest prepared as suggested.  I marinated for 4 hours. The mexi-ranch dressing i added 3T. Pace picante sauce to original recipe.  Before broiling in baking dish I added fresh chopped tomato and green onion on top of the cheese.  For a side dish with it, I saute'd 1 small yellow onion and 2 cloves of galic in (smart balance) butter and extra virgin olive oil, added chopped sun-dried tomatoes and 3 HEAPING T. of the left over mexi-ranch dressing, 1 pint of half and half, and 1/2 c. fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Let that simmer until thickened and added some leftover bow-tie pasta i had.  s&p to taste.  I served the chicken and pasta side by side with no corn chips.  It was WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!  The chicken was juicy and tender.  The pasta was a perfect compliment.  Serve with a nice green salad.  I will make this again for sure.

This was very nice- it's the first time I've had tequilla lime anything and I thought it was great. Here what you should know: 1. Note about liquid smoke: there are two kinds. One is concentrated, and you only need a few drops ever. The other is a diluted, marinade version, where you should use 1/2-1 tsp as directed. 2. I used 1/4 cup of tequilla, and maybe a bit more lime than called for-will add more of both next time. I also left out the water, but the chicken wasn't as moist as some reviews state. I may add some water next time. I was really happy with the flavors- you can distinguish them all after the chicken is grilled and it's a nice change for minimum effort (I cheated and mixed ranch and salsa).

TAKE AT EASY WITH THE LIQUID SMOKE! I rarely use over a few drops with most my recipes that require it and it is always more than sufficient. I didn't buy into the 1 tsp bit of that this recipe calls for and even my reduced amount I gave the marinade was still too much. So that is the only key advice I can give. Oh and of course listen to the others who say just mix ranch dressing with your favorite salsa rather than complicating things with excess of ingredients in this recipe. This recipe has the potential with just a few corrections that are needed. . .

Very tasty!  We marinated the meat for about 4 hours and it was very flavorful.  However, I'd decrease the amount of liquid smoke because it dominated the flavors a little too much for my tastes.  Also, we omitted the tequila.  We followed the suggestions of others and just mixed salsa with ranch dressing to make the sauce.  We ended up dipping chips in the sauce for an appetizer while we waited for the chicken to cook!  We'll make this again!

This recipe is excellent. I double the lime juice and use 1-2T tequila.  Chicken is moist and delicious! To save time, instead of the minced tomato, green chile peppers and onion, I use salsa in the dressing.  I have made this a number of times and have never had leftovers!

This chicken is delicious!  It comes out so tender.  The sauce is really tasty, and goes very well with the chicken.  My only problem with it is that the liquid smoke taste is a little strong.  The second time I made this, I halved the liquid smoke and it turned out perfect.  I served it to guests, and they all loved it!  And it's so easy!

I have been making this recipe for a long time and it is still a family favorite! I suggest you use 4 times the tequila it calls for, it gives it more flavor--we call it Baja Chicken at our house instead of Tequila Lime Chicken, more kid friendly! I also just use Pace Picante Sauce or I will pick up the fresh salsa made in the grocery store and combine with the sour cream and mayo--it is much easier and tastes the same.  Fabulous recipe, I will continue to make it again and again!

I used Light Done Right Ranch dessing in place of the sour cream and the mayo and halved the liquid smoke. I also used low-fat cheese and liked this better than the first version. By getting rid of the mayo and sour cream it also took out a lot of the extra calories. I served it on Baked Tostito's. I made if for company and they loved it. Will definately make again.

This is my favorite chicken recipe. Takes a bit of prep work, but well worth the accolades you'll get from those who taste it! I have adjusted the sauce somewhat to suit my tastes: more cumin, tomato and hot sauce. I've even used ultra low fat mayo, and it still turns out great!

I followed this exactly except I left the ginger out because we hate it. The recipe also calls for corn chips which I usually associate with Frito's but all I had was white corn tortilla chips which my hubby thought would be good too since they are technically corn chips. The recipe calls for quite a bit of stuff which makes it look complicated but I had most of it on hand and it wasn't complicated whatsoever. The sauce was really good on there. I'd like to try it with Fritos next time to see if it adds anything. Great recipe...thanks!

I was missing a LOT of components for the marinade (including teriyaki sauce) so I improvised using 1/3 c soy, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1/2 tsp dried garlic, 1 tbsp tequila, 1/4 tsp salt, juice from 1/2 large lime & a couple of dashes of cumin.  Tasted delish.  We grilled the chicken since we didn't have liquid smoke and topped with salsa ranch dressing (out of the bottle - even easier) and colby/monterey slices to broil for 2 minutes in the oven.  Served over larger chips which worked out better b/c you could get a bigger bite of chips instead of chasing those little strips around :)  Next time I'll be sure to squeeze a bit of fresh lime on top before serving.  Will absolutely make it again!

I think this is by far the BEST recipe I've found on this website.  EVERYONE in my family LOVED it and I have 3 very picky teenagers and an 8 year old with simple tastes.  Since I've discovered this recipe several weeks ago, I've used it every time we've had guests to impress them and everyone has requested the recipe.  The ranch dressing is worth the prep. time.  If you want a lower cal recipe, you could slice up corn tortillas and spray them with Pam and broil them until golden and crisp.

I wanted to like this recipe...really I did.  I mean, Tequila Lime Chicken on the grill?  YUM!  However, I am going to buck the tide and say that it was a miserable failure here.  The teriyaki flavor overwhelmed all of the marinade (although I don't know what use 1/4 teaspoon of tequila was?).  The mexican dressing was odd...I couldn't put my finger on it, but it just didn't taste like the flavors melded.  Melting cheese on top helped pull it together a little bit, but really...a lot of calories for a disappointing meal.  Even the family member who eats anything and likes it asked me not to make it again.  Sorry.

I used the ranch dressing and salsa mixture as other reviewers suggested and it was delicious (plus it really simplified things!). For extra lime flavor, I squeezed fresh lime juice over the top just before serving and also garnished with a few slices of avocado. Yummy. My husband loves it!

This recipe is UNbelievable! With the exception of increasing the tequila in the marinade to 1T and using kefir instead of milk in the Mexi-Ranch sauce,  I followed the recipe to the letter (oh, I didn't add any additional salt either)... (haha, I guess I didn't exactly follow it to the letter then, did I? :P ) After grilling the chicken breasts on the Weber, rather than sticking them under the broiler with the chips & cheese, I served this as a salad, over romaine and topped with sliced sweet pepper, homemade salsa, and the Mexi-Ranch sauce... Holy DELICIOUS, Batman!!!

I attempted to use the marinade for fajitas. It came out totally tasteless. The water dilutes the marinade way too much. The point of 1/4 teaspoon of tequila is totally pointless. Maybe the rest of the recipe is better because all the other ingredients give it some flavor.

I use to work at a certain restaurant, lets call it Applebees, and if this recipe is referring to the FIESTA lime chicken, then the Mexi-Ranch is just salsa and ranch mixed together! Really, if we ran out of mexi-Ranch, we just mixed the ranch and salsa together! You have to get salsa that tastes like theirs though. I love this sauce and is why I started working there! lol In fact, they also have some good avacado-ranch and other good ranches on occasion, and its something you can do at home very simply! Good recipe, but is way too complicated!

WOW! This recipe tastes just like Applebes's Fiesta Lime Chicken. The other reviews are right, skip all the stuff to make the sauce and use ranch and salsa...very good. I didn't have ginger and didn't even miss it. Easy recipe too. Will make again.

I hesitated when I saw all the ingredients, but the reviews were stellar, so I thought, "why not?". First, it takes forever to get everything prepped. This is not a thirty-minute meal, not even taking away the marinate time. In the end, I really didn't think it was worth all the fuss. Good, but just okay, and all the work involved just took away from it even more.

This is wonderful!!!  I crunched up taco shells and put the chicken on top of it.  To save time I grilled the chicken on my little George Foreman grill.

I had been just searching for a recipe that used tequila because we had a bottle I knew we weren't going to ever put a dent in and I luckily stumbled on this delicious one! It's a bit spicy and we don't like spicy food but it's not too much if you skip the green chilli pepper. I also double the mexi ranch sauce so there's extra for the chips to be covered. I also mix the pepper jack cheese with some cheddar cheese and it comes out great!!

I am VERY happy to make the mex sauce with all the ingredients because I am allergic to ranch dip and pre-packaged seasonings (they usually contain MSG). Next time, less liquid smoke, less teriyaki sauce, more tequila-just my preference. I will definitely make this again!

YES!!! That was scrumptious! Used the ingredients EXACTLY as the recipe called for. Why temper with perfection? Only change I made was to cook the breasts on my George Forman Grill then put them under the broiler to melt the cheese. Worked great and cooked fast. Oh man was that good.

Fabulous recipe!  I used a miniature sized bottle of tequila instead of the 1/4 tsp. the recipe calls for.  I also used a lot more chilies in the sauce.  Very heavy and filling.  I served this with yellow rice and black beans - quite a success.

This recipe is my husband's favorite. I usually double the mexi-ranch, and crush tortilla chips under the rice. This recipe is even better than the restaurants!

My husband liked it, but I did not. I had to scrape everything off of the chicken to eat it, I thought the marinated chicken was good by itself.

This recipie dosn't taste like the restaurant version, but it is very good. I do think the sauce is what is off a little, maybe too much of a mayo taste.

AMAZING!!! While the chicken was marinating I mixed up 1/2 ranch and 1/2 salsa but added garlic salt, onion powder, cumin, chili powder and cilantro to make the Mexi-Ranch...very good!! After the chicken was done broiling I topped it with mexi-ranch, shredded cheese, and sauted peppers and onions, absolutely tasty!!! The chicken would be great just stand alone with this marinade.  My 5year old loved it!!! Thanks SO much...will definatly make again!!1

This was AMAZING! Just as good if not better than the "resturaunt style"! I did not have liquid smoke so I actually added a tsp of BBQ sauce and about 1/4 teaspoon of Cumin to have the smokiness that I really wanted. I also used Chicken Stock instead of Water, and I took the advice of other reviewers to just use the ranch & salsa for the Mexiranch.  AMAZING, THANK YOU!

We love this chicken recipe because it's very tasty and easy to make.  We don't make the sauce (attempting to cut some of the calories and fat) and just use the marinade portion, then grill the chicken and top with low-fat cheese and an avocado slice.

The marinade is excellent.  I also used a shortcut mixture of ranch and salsa instead of creating from scratch.

Really tasty! I made my own Mexi-ranch dressing with combining equal parts ranch and salsa. I also added a little Cayenne and some hot sauce to make it a little spicier. I cooked the chicken breasts on the George Foreman grill and then put them in the baking dish. I adde tortilla chips to the top of the chicken and also added some cilantro to the top. Delicious!

Yummy, flavorful, worth the extra time for preparation.  I increased the amount of lime to 1/4 Cup, decreased the water to 1/4 Cup, added olive oil (about 1/2 Cup) to the marinade.  I also reduced the liquid smoke to 1/2 tsp., reduced the teriyaki to less than 1/4 cup, and increased the garlic to about 3 tsps.  I marinaded the chicken overnight, it was outstanding.

The Mexi-Ranch dressing was fantastic also, it really makes the dish.  I increased the cumin, the onion, the parsley, green chiles and added a tad of garlic powder.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce but kept the cayenne pepper and chili powder.  I made this dressing a few hours before I served the chicken, I think the flavors need some time to blend.

Definitely a keeper, will make again and again.

I didn't have a lot of the ingredients so I had to take a lot of liberties with this, but it still turned out great.  I didn't have liquid smoke (which I now read most people don't like), tequila, parsley, tomato and most importantly, I had to use lemon juice instead of lime juice!  I also couldn't marinate it longer than 30 minutes.  I can't wait to make it the real way since it still turned out so tender and delicious!  I actually found it to be very easy to make (except I hate cleaning broiler pans) and quick (except for the marinating time). I will definitely make this again, only this time I think in a grill pan so it's easier to clean up!

I did several changes that were recommended from other reviewers.  I left out the water from the marinade, substituted Worcestershire sauce for the liquid smoke, and used more tequila than recommended.  I ended up making my own teriyaki sauce from a recipe on this site and the chicken itself tasted wonderful (not overpowering).  I marinated it for half a day and I didn't pound the chicken as others recommended.  It had plenty of flavor as is. My husband loved the mexi ranch dressing; I can't imagine it tasting anything like ranch with salsa as some have done before.  We made a simple Mexican rice dish found on this site as well and it complemented the chicken quite well.  My husband is looking forward to having it again soon.  Since it wasn't very time consuming and quite tasty I'll be more than happy to make it.

This recipe was a hit with me and my husband. I did change somethings based on previous reviews.
I omitted the water (very good advice from previous review), I used the juice and zest on one lime, I substituted worchestshire sauce in place of the liguid smoke, and fresh ginger slices instead of ground ginger. I seared them in my grill pan on both sides and then baked them slowly...when done and ready to serve I added the mexi ranch and cheese on top...and I also smash taco chips and put that on top of the cheese and broiled it til browned. It was great!

I have only used the marinade in this recipe, but it is the BEST marinade I have ever used! I shredded the chicken and used it in enchiladas and quesadillas. I didn't have liquid smoke so I used a splash of Worchestor sauce instead. I also left out the ginger. This smelled fantastic while I was cooking!

This recipe is great.  The longer the chicken marinates the better.  Make the mexi-ranch dressing the night before.  It will have much more flavor than made the day of.  Use 1/4 cup Tequila not 1/4 teaspoon.

Not sure why a recipe for a marinade would ask for 1 cup of water--It was too diluted. Would maybe try again without water, and maybe add tequilla or margarita mix.

This is a recipe definitely worth trying.  The chicken alone was absolutely delicious!  I did add one quarter cup of tequila; one quarter teaspoon is surely an error.  I also used light mayo and light sour cream for the dressing, and instead of corn chips, I used romaine lettuce and turned this into a big salad.  It was great on a hot summer evening and so filling with less calories.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this but left off the Mexi-Ranch dressing.  Added more lime and tequila, chopped green onion and cilantro and grilled.  Served with pico de gallo as a garnish with spanish rice and a cilantro salad and it was great.  I've done this twice, with and without cheese and both are keepers, just a matter of taste

Any dish that makes my husband declare "this is @#$%*& FANTASTIC!" has to get 5 stars! I increased the tequila to 1/4 cup and marinated the chicken overnight in a ziploc bag. Although the dressing was delicious, it liquified in the oven and slid right off the chicken, taking the glorious cheese topping with it! But the marinade made this so flavourful and moist, we will be making this again. Definitely!

I used 1/4 CUP of tequila as others indicated and then followed the recipe exactly.  WOW WOW WOW WOW  I left off the toppings for my 4 yr old, and she loved the marinated chicken.  Hubby & I went nutso over this recipe.  I made it with Mexican Rice II.  For leftovers, I sliced the chicken, used a bit of the mexi-ranch, cheese and rice rolled into a tortilla - it made really great rollups!  I've passed this recipe on to a couple other chicken lovers who had great results with this one, too.  THANKS!

I read every single review before attempting this recipe. #1- follow the recipe as is, when you all try to change things your way, you mess it up, no wonder some of you didn't care for it. #2- don't cheat and use ranch dressing with salsa from a jar. I really try to cook with fresh foods from scratch and it makes my skin crawl when people use stuff from jars or cans when you don't have to. I did marinate the chicken overnight. Also, I used Wasabi Mayo instead of regular, to give it an extra kick. Delish!! For you all on the West Coast, you can find this at Trader Joe's. Also, the tequila must be at least 1/4 cup, more if you like. Think about it, 1/4 tsp for four people??? This was super delicious and by all means use low fat versions of sour cream, mayo, etc... to cut back on calories because the calories alone per serving almost made me not make it. It's not too time consuming but definitely plan in advance for this one so you can marinate overnight. This was a huge hit at my dinner party-- I almost didn't want to share the recipe and said it was a family secret, but I couldn't lie. I served this with the hominy and cheese bake in this site. Enjoy.

Wow!  This was really impressive.  The long list of ingredients may put some people off, but it's really simple.  I made up several baggies of the spice mixture and put them in the pantry.

My boyfriend loved this recipe!!  I too, used ranch dressing and salsa and then spiced it up with some seasonings.  This was a great meal with some steamed broccoli and some mexican rice.

This was an excellent variation for grilled chicken. I didn't have any teriyaki sauce when I made the marinade, so I just used soy sauce instead. Like others, I added more tequila (about 2-3T). I also added about a tablespoon of honey to sweeten it up a bit. It turned out great. My husband is a huge Mexican food fan and he gave this recipe two thumbs up.

Because I needed more chicken I doubled the marinade (but not the liquid smoke) marinaded the chicken for 5 hours, and then grilled the chicken on the grill. This chicken was awesome just off of the grill! Instead of making the mexi-ranch dressing, I did what others had suggested and mixed 16 oz bottles of salsa and ranch dressing together. The children really loved this recipe! I think if I made it again I would eat my chicken right off of the grill. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a wonderful recipe that the whole family loved.  I grilled the chicken outside and then put it in the oven for a few minutes with the dressing and cheese.  I modified the dressing a little to use what I had on hand - sour cream, mayo, milk, picante sauce from a jar, garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, seasoned salt, & pepper.  This will be a regular item on our summer menu!

Thought this would be spicier - but it was still very good.  Didn't marinate the full 3 hours, but it still worked out well.  Served it will a salad and oven roasted potatoes.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!  Thanks!

I got this recipe quite a while ago, it was one of my catering meals. I made the sauce with 18 ingredients and all the clients wanted the recipe for it. I would never use the mayo with salsa. I served it on deep fried strips of corn tortillas with spanish rice  and refried beans. This was  one of my best sellers. I wouldn't change a thing.

I only use the the marinade part of the recipe and the family loves this chicken. The first time I made the marinade as is and we agreed it didn't have enough flavor for us, so now I don't add the water and I use both the zest and juice of 2-3 limes and upped the tequila to 3-4 TBS. yumm!

I made this last night and consider it one of the best recipes I've found on this site!  Don't cut the liquid smoke and maybe add a tad more.  I also added a full tsp of the tequila which I think added quite a bit of flavor and evened out the taste of the lime.  Otherwise I didn't alter this at all. I marinated it for four hours and had to broil my chicken in the oven since it started storming wildly...it was still the most tasty marinated meat I've had in a long time!  I did not make the ranch sauce from scratch but want to soon.  I can't wait to get it on the grill.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I did make some minor changes. I added more tequila. I had some season that is Chile and Lime which I added. Squeezed lemon on chicken, after I took it off the grill  Plus, I followed another person advise and took 1/4 mayo (best foods), 1/4 sour cream, salsa, 1 tbsp of half and half to make our cream sauce. The chicken was very flavorful. We made chicken tacos.

I've been using this as my recipe for tequila lime chicken for quite some time now. Its never let me down when it comes to rave reviews from my guests.  This last time I made it though, I ran out of salsa and with no time to make the long version I substituted a yummy jalapeno Greek yogurt dip from Costco, Wow, it was awesome. I'll be doing this from now on. It was really excellent. Gave it a nice little kick.

I used equal parts of Chi Chi's orginial Salsa and light ranch dressing for the sauce.  Works great!  You can change the flavor slightly by the using different brands of both.  This is on the rich side, I served with yellow rice.  Have made several times.

This kids LOVED this.  I had to make a few changes.  This was a last minute dinner, and I didn't have everything (like the teriyaki and sour cream)  Turned out really well, and I will CERTAINLY make it again.  Thank you Robbie Rice.

Awesome. I didn't have tequila, so I didn't add it. I messed up by putting the chile peppers in with the marinade rather than the sauce, but it still turned out amazing!

Loved this recipe but, I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and mixed ranch dressing & salsa together for the sauce.  I used 1/4 cup salsa and 1/4 cup ranch.  
It was great served with mexican rice.

Tasted fine, but for all the time and effort, I was expecting something more. The chicken was absolutely not done after 5 minutes of broiling each side in the oven ~ was way way pink. I turned the over to 400 and left it in for another 10 or 15 minutes. If this recipe could be done within 30 minutes or 1 hour, I'd make it again.

This has a lot of ingredients but somehow still ends up a little bland.  I think the next time I would try doubling or maybe tripling the sauce.  It was still worth making, just needs a little depth of flavor.

I was looking for a low fat low cal meal, and had a craving for Tequila Lime chicken. So, I just took all of the spices in this recipe and added them to the marinade of Tequila, lime, teriyaki, and liquid smoke and after marinating, baked them. My family and I agree, it was some of the tastiest chicken we have ever had! I have made this recipe as directed before and it is a five star no doubt. But even doing it this way, it was a five star! Thanks, Robbie!

I recommend NOT broiling the chicken, rather, baking it as you would regular baked chicken. I tried broiling it, and it wasn't done in the time allotted. In fact, my guests had to wait while the chicken baked at regular temperature.I agree with the ranch+salsa idea, that worked well.

Thumbs up from this family. Added a little more tequila and lime juice in the marinade. Good with rice and beans.

This recipe is one of my favorites!  It looks like a lot of work because it has many ingredients but it is actually a quick meal to make.  I always make more marinade than in calls for because it seems like there is not enough otherwise.

This recipe was pretty good.  In the end I thought the flavor would be more unique, but it tasted like enchilada sauce poured over chicken.  That was a ton of ingredients, but the only thing I really tasted was very similar to enchilada sauce.  May make again.

This is one of my (and my family's) absolute favorites!  I was so excited to find this recipe - I think it is even better than the restaurant version!  It may look intimidating with all of those ingredients, but it is so worth it - yum!

I have to say that this is incredible!!!!!  I made this for a dinner party nearly 2 years ago and my friends still comment that they think that I am the best cook!  I think that this is so much better than the restaurant version!  I didn't substitute anything on my initial attempt, but have since tried different types of chips.  I may try to use a salsa to quicken up the prep time, but I hesitate to mess with a perfect recipe!

This is fabulous! HOWEVER, if you are in a pinch for time (as I ALWAYS seem to be with kids and animals underfoot!), you could marinate the chicken in Lawrys 30 minute Tequila Lime Marinade. I use the Foreman Grill to cook quickly. I also mixed salsa and ranch dressing and that's nice because you can really change the flavor according to hotness or salsa ingredients (I'm considering trying Medium Peach Salsa).  This is a great way to use up the end of a bag of tortilla chips that you can't use to scoop anything else! :) Loved it...thanks for submitting!

Easier than it looks, given the huge ingredient list and pretty good! One recommendation I would make is to pound the chicken breasts down little or to perhaps split them in two, since the marinade did a great job on the thinner end of the meat, but not on the thicker end, and it had marinated all day, having gotten flipped once.

Awesome! The whole family ate it. I din't add the green chile peppers or the cumin, and it wasn't too spicy. To cut calories, I didn't use chips and I used low fat sour cream.  This would be wonderful with rice.

Love the marinade and the mexi ranch sauce.  Instead of serving with rice I made couscous with chicken broth, tomatoes and cumin and chili powder.  Chips took away from all the other great flavors.

I give this recipe 5 stars because the base for this recipe was great although I changed it a bit based on previous reviews and to make it easier.  To the marinade I added more tequila (1/4 cup vs. 1/4 tsp. - is that a misprint?) and a 1/2 tsp fresh cilantro.  I simplified the mayo/sour cream topping by mixing it with taco seasoning, 2 tbsp. fresh salsa, hot sauce, lime juice and 1/2 tsp fresh cilantro. Served it with black beans and spanish rice WOW was it awesome!!

Loved this chicken recipe.  I did add 1 tsp of tequila...1/4 tsp almost seems useless.  Also had to broil 5 to 6 mins per side.  A definite keeper!

Amazing twist to jazz up chicken breasts.  It does indeed taste like the restaurant version.  I didn't have the sour cream, so substituted with plain greek-style yogurt and it was still great!  A big hit with the family.  I will definitely do this one again.

Baked the chicken under the broiler. I should have sliced the breasts in half as they were apparently too thick and did not get done. Had to finish cooking them in micro wave which turned out okay but ruined the overall appearance somewhat. Overall  taste was still  good and home made sauce was yummy.

The only difference is I grabbed Cracker Barrel 'brand' white cheddar (on accident) and used Mexican white cheese instead of Jack. Oh, and used A whole shot (1oz) of tequila for the marinade. Exceptional meal when combined with refried beans and arroz rojo (Mexican red rice); and used blue corn tortilla chips for color. Made the Mexi-sauce per recipe and it was phenomenal.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was delicious as the recipe is written...my whole family loved it.  I served the chicken on a bed of shredded lettuce and the crumbled chips and topped with diced tomato, sliced green onion and diced avocade with a drizzle of left over sauce.  It was even beautiful!  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that despite the ingredients (green chilis, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, hot sauce -- made the Mexi sauce from scratch) there was NO heat/spice to the recipe at all. (I'm not familiar with the original restaurant version...is that spicy?) Next time I will definitely kick up all those ingredients.

Personnly did not care for the combo of the sauce and the cheese, too much dairy on the chicken and dominated the dish.  Next time I will use less of both or pass on the cheese.

I marinated the chicken overnight and it turned out perfect!  Everyone that had it loved it!  I will definitely make this recipe again.  It was quite easy once the ingredients were gathered and turned out amazing!  Loved it!

We really enjoyed this.  After grilling it, we cut it into small pieces for burritos.  It was a hit!

I used to work at said restaurant as well. This is a perfect duplication.  Skip all the ridiculous ingredients for the sauce. Stir together equal parts ranch dressing and salsa. Congratulations you just saved $20 and have an extra hour in your day. Fantastic recipe.

My boyfriend loved this recipe and I liked it. The sauce was pretty unique (I have not had the actual restaurant version, so it was at least unique to me), and the teriyaki, sour cream and mayo flavors came through the most. I'm sure the mexi-ranch tastes fine if you just combine ranch and salsa, but if you have the time, it really isn't that much extra work to make the sauce yourself. We used leftover tomatoes, onions, green chili peppers, garlic, hot sauce, lemon juice, and spices to make some salsa as a snack while we waited for the marinade to soak in.

Some additions/changes/notes:
-I added hot teriyaki sauce instead of regular. Even so, the dish hardly tasted spicy at all.
-Instead of corn chips, we used a bed of white tortilla chips. This seemed pretty unnecessary and was only useful to sop up any extra sauce or cheese that fell off of the chicken.
-People kept saying to use less liquid smoke, so I halved the amount and used 1/2 tsp. However, I'd use the amount suggested in the recipe next time. I couldn't really detect any smokiness in the chicken.
-I used the recommended amount of tequila in the marinade, not having read all of the reviews stating to up the amount substantially. I would add more next time.
-Marinated for 2 hours. 3 hours might've made this a bit more flavorful.
-I omitted the parsley as I didn't have any on hand.

All in all, I don't necessarily know if I would actually made this again, but it was fun to try it out.

This came out excellent. I followed the original recipe, and only substituted fresh parsley for the dried parsley, and served it over linguini noodles, instead of the chips. I will certainly make this again.

I made this recipe just how it called for and it was very good.I marinated the chicken over night which I think made it more tender and moist. The sauce had just the right spice and hotness to give it that kick. This recipe will be a keeper.

The idea behind this recipe is a good one and the recipe itself has a few issues that are significant enough for the 3 star rating. The primary issue is the marinade. Also, the addition of the more 'asian' ingredients was not what we were looking for. We used equal parts lime juice and tequila, added garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, olive oil, chopped red onion, chopped cilantro, smoked tabasco in place of the liquid smoke and NO water. 2 hours of marinating time was absolutely sufficient. The chicken was moist and flavorful and not mushy from too much time in an acidic marinade.  Contrary to all the suggestions to simplify the mexi-ranch dressing I followed that part of the recipe very closely. It was a great way to use spices that often expire before we can get them used up. It was also much more complex than the ranch/salsa combination.  I left out the tomato and peppers and used significantly more of the hot sauce - more like a Tablespoon or more.  I made this a day in advance and transferred it to a squeeze bottle.  I opted for 20 minutes in the oven at 425 for the chicken to allow me to spend time with my guests instead of over the stove.  For serving,  a piece of chicken on the crushed chips, a nice squiggle of the dressing from the squeeze bottle, a couple of spoonfuls of a mixture of black beans, corn, Ro-tel, red onion, orange bell pepper, cilantro, and cumin simmered together stovetop, and a sprinkle of shredded cheddar/jack cheese.

The flavor just didn't "wow" me and serving this on crushed corn chips didn't do much for me either.  Sorry, I really thought I would enjoy this much more than I did.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We really enjoyed this. I also followed the other reviews and used half ranch/ half salsa with cilantro for the dressing. My BF asked for more Tex Mex sauce next time. Thanks!

Huge hit with the family! Very good flavor, like some of the others, I simplified by combining ranch and salsa to make the dressing. It made this recipe easy and yummy! Will definitely be making this again.

5 Stars for the marinade! I marinated the chicken for a week and grilled it. Served over salad. Loved the flavor. Will try again following the rest of the steps.

We loved this! Any time I have meat to marinade, I always put it in a gallon ziplock bag so i can really mush all the flavors around while it sits, plus easy clean up! I did use our grill to cook the chicken and then broiled the sauce and the cheese on top. The mexi sauce is interesting as I have no doubt it is delicious made as stated but I really wanted to cut that corner since i have two little ones and not a whole lot of time to be super gourmet so I did as many others mentioned and mixed half ranch with a fresh cut pico from the store with great result. Used the left over pico as garnish on top of the chicken when it was out of the broil and it both looked and tasted fantastic! We served ours with rice and salad, the kids ate it all up! Thanks for the fab recipe!

we thought this was very good and I did not think the dressing was difficult or that time consuming to make. I also thought it was a lot better than just adding salsa to sour cream.( which I have done for other recipes).I plan to use this dressing on other things like taco salad and fish tacos.
I did only use a few drops of the liquid smoke. The chicken was very tender and tasty. Will make it again.

A 5-star rating from my DH and I with this recipe.  I mixed the marinade up in the morning and the chicken soaked all day.  Luckily, the weather cooperated and we grilled the chicken.  I decided to serve this over a salad, so I did not pop the chicken under the broiler before serving.  We added the cheese when it came off the grill and that worked for us.  The dressing is fantastic with this dish.  In fact, I will be making the dressing up just to have with salads.  I served this with lime tortilla strips rather than corn chips.  A definite do-again recipe for our household.  Served this with 'Balsamic Grilled Zucchini' from AR and we had one of the best meals that I've prepared in a while.  Thanks Robbie Rice, for sharing your recipe.  It is good stuff!

Loved it with a few changes....I did not have tequila or liquid smoke. I added honey to balance the teriyaki and lime.  I'm sure the original recipe will be just as yummy, if not more so!

The sauce for this is better than the chain restaurant one.  The corn chips were unnessasary for us although I realze that is part of the dish at the famous place.  I used Mozzarella as that is what I had on hand, but Cheddar as the recipe calls for would be better.

This is quite a bit of work but it turned out awesome and was worth the extra time. I will be adding this to the rotation as it was that good. And yes, it is very like a popular restaurants, Tequila Lime Chicken.

Not sure what restaurant this recipe is supposed to be like but it is awesome. Great flavor. Used Monterey Jack with jalapeño on one chick breast for myself. Even my 8 year old said it was good. 
Definitely don't leave out the tortilla chips!  I just crushed some on top!  Delish!!

Followed this recipe exactly as written, except substituted bourbon for tequila (no tequila in the house!)  Loved it!  Juicy chicken - be sure to marinade at least 2 hours.  Next time, I'll add lime zest.

I Like this one but I make some changes I use Cactus juice tequila and use at least 1 cup of it in the marinade. I also use fresh limes for my juice and match the same amount of tequila cut the Teriyaki in half, use fresh ginger also helps. I put everything in the food processor, fresh ginger, tequila, fresh limes I even leave some of the centers on the limes. Remove the pell it can turn bitter. Adding some sugar to taste can help if you like a sweeter tasting mix but don't over do it also can help. It also can cause the chicken to burn and smoke more, I have been told it will toughen up meats if left in overnight but never have had that problem. I make mine and soak it overnight. Grill them broil to reheat and serve. We prefer to use Mexican rice mix and refried beans instead of crushed chips to bed the chicken on. We still have chips but use them to eat the rice and beans, homemade Guacamole with. Any leftover marinade is used for extra chicken to make Nacho meat is marinated cooked then frozen for later on when we want zesty nachos. Reheat the leftover chicken/Pork in the slow cooker crockpot with everything and and build your own nacho plate for a late night or weekend when you don't want to heat the house up and want something lite to eat. I make it a couple a times a year and everyone loves it, I do it in stages so its not so much work. You can cheat and use salsa and ranch dressing mixed together or make your own. I prefer to make my own and let it sit a couple days.

This was FANTASTIC!   Here's how I did it.  Made the marinade per the recipe and let it go for about 5 hours, flipping every 90 mins roughly.  Then followed other's advice to just use ranch + good salsa (the stuff that is in the cooler, not the basic jar stuff) + chopped cilantro.  I used two big breasts, and about 1/4 cup ranch and 1/4 cup salsa, and perhaps 2 TB finely chopped fresh cilantro.  Then I heated my oven to 375 and put my cast iron grill pan in and got it good and hot.  Pulled it out and put it on a high burner.  Very lightly oil chicken so it doesn't stick, and then tossed chicken on for about 2 mins, do a cross turn for a min, then flip and repeat (remember, always start with the top/smooth part of the chicken breast since the breast will be put in the oven with the bottom side down and it gets pretty cooked - it's an aesthetic thing).  Anyways, I tossed back in oven for about 6 mins, then pulled out and turned oven to high broil - added ranch/salsa/cilantro mix to the top, then topped with cheese and tossed in, with oven cracked open(!) for about 3 mins till cheese was melted and bubbly.  Came out so juicy and delish.  I served with my secret black beans and the cilantro lime rice recipe from this site.  HOME RUN!

Easy and super delicious!  Tastes just like the restaurant version. I didn't have any liquid smoke.  I will add more lime juice next time.  Thank you for this recipe!  Excellent!

Everyone loved this! I made the marinade exactly, though I did the ranch/salsa combo for the topping sauce. I broiled mine because its dark and chilly around dinnertime right now and I'm not going to freeze over my gas grill with a flashlight. I am excited to try this on the outdoor grill though. I'll definitely make this again!

It was good but not great.  The mexi-ranch sauce overpowered the very delicate tequilla-lime flavors and the liquid smoke was too strong.  It was flavorful and the meat was very moist, just not quite what I was looking for.

This was good.  I used hot salsa instead of the chilis/tomatoes. If I did it again, I would keep the marinade mixture on the chicken for more like 4 hours.

I tried this recepie today and followed some of the suggestions of other reviewers.  I made the sauce by mixing ranch dressing, salsa, lime juice, and a bit of hot sauce.  The only issue that I had was that my chicken browned more than I would have liked while I broiled it (should have turned it down), so I ended up finishing off the cooking by baking it for 15 minutes at 350.  The fam said it was good, but the restaurant version is a lot better.

We really liked this recipe. I took the shortcut and used 1/2 Ranch dressing and 1/2 picante sauce and fresh cilantro. It was very good and much easier. The liquid smoke was very prevalent in the taste of the chicken and I would probably reduce that by 1/2 next time. I will definitely make this again.

This was really nice.  I marinated some chicken legs and thighs for about 2 1/2 hrs and had poked them with a meat tenderizer.  I made the salsa but after grilling the chicken, we just left it like that instead of baking with cheese and sauce because i had made twice baked potatoes which had plenty of cheese on them.  We dipped the chicken into the cold salsa and it was fantastic as is.  I think the only change I made was adding more garlic and doubling the marinade mixture.  It has great flavor and next time, i'd like to marinade longer to get that great flavor really penetrated. Also easy to make as the list looks pretty long, it's just grabbing things most of us have on hand and throwing it in!

We love this, in fact it's what I'm making for dinner tonight.  I got this recipe off another recipe site years ago and the only differences are to the dressing mix.  Mine calls for 1.5 t white vinger, all the dashes are 1/8 t, and a dash of garlic powder.  I also increase the tequila to at least 1/8 C.  I don't know that it tastes just like the restaurant's version, but we sure do like it all the same.

Very good.  I used the salsa-and-ranch-dressing shortcut and it was still good.  Still need to figure out what to serve with it; Spanish rice is good but not terribly interesting.

This turned out absolutely delicious!  My husband kept saying what a good cook I was!  The marinade lends a very light lime taste that perfectly compliments the southwest sour cream sauce.  There were no overwhelming flavors, just a perfect blend.  I left out the tequila and didn't miss it.  I paired it with a Lipton Chipotle rice package and it will become a weekly staple in our home!  Thanks!

This chicken dish was absolutely wonderful. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much. I had to sub a few things but nothing much. I didn't have tomatoes or the green chile peppers so I used crushed red peppers. Also, I used Hint of Lime Tostito chips and it added a little extra flavor. I give this recipe 5+ stars. Yummy Yum Yum

Recipe calls for a total cook time of 13 minutes; I used boneless 1/2 chicken breast and ounded them to make more even-I had to cook for at least 25 Minutes.  I also used 1/4 CUP tequila and marinated 3 hours-the chicken was not that flavourful.  The sauce, cheese and corn chips saved it though.I did wait and put cheese on in last 2 minutes.  In my opinion this dish was just ok.  It was fun to try-lots of ingredients, but easy!

It was good, but my husband wasn't overly enthused.  I think I might use a little less liquid smoke, it was almost overpowering.  I will make again though with a few minor changes.

Tasty. My 17 year old said it was the best chicken he's ever tasted. The sauce was more work than it was worth, and not nearly as much kick as I expected, but the marinade was great. I may use just the marinade again.

Well, I am going to go with the majority here and give this a 5 star rating.  The chicken alone, with the marinade was wonderful.  I served it plain to my picky son, and he loved it.  I did cheat and use salsa/ranch for the sauce, but I will make the sauce as written when I have all of the ingredients on hand.  I also used 1/4 cup tequila as others have suggested.  I served with smoked chipolte rice.  My husband and I loved it.   I will make this again for sure!
Thanks so much for the post!

My boys and I thought it was wonderful. Husband came home late from work and said he didn't care for it. I really don't know how that was possible because it was really so good. I did use 1/4 cup tequila.

Great recipe!  Because I didn't have enough limes on hand, I used a lemon/lime combination.  The chicken was very, very tender and had a zesty zing--also, incredibly easy to make.  My husband and I both liked it better without the topping.

This is a great recipe. This recipe is Todd Wilburs Recipe from his Top Secret Recipe book.
I saw this recipe some time ago in his book and posted on his site. I've been making this with great success for several years now.

My husband loves Applebee's version, so I decided to try this. It was excellent! I did take some of the other reviewer's suggestions/shortcuts on combining Ranch Dressing and Salsa to make the MexiRanch Dressing, and this also worked great! I then "doctored" it up a bit by adding the spices listed in the recipe. Great recipe, definitely will be a repeat!!

LOVED this!  My family and friends gobbled this up.  I halved the liquid smoke, though.  It was too strong otherwise.

I thought this was extremely yummy but my family just thought it was "ok". Even tho it is a good recipe, I probably won't make it again. It's a bit too much trouble for something that my family doesn't really care for.

If you have all the ingredients this is really easy to make - I didn't change any of the ingredients (oops - I did add more tequilla and lime juice) - but I did cook it differently.  I had a craving for a good, old-fashioned chicken breast with bone-in - skin-on.  (No healthy skinless, boneless thing!) and wanted to grill it to a wonderful crispiness.  I was tired of my BBQ marinades - so I used this instead.  It was delicious! I used the sour cream/mayo sauce on the side.  Didn't bother with the cheese - I will make this as submitter suggested but will also keep this for grilling.

There are so many ingredients in this that it took me almost a year to finally make myself buy what I didn't have and make it but now it's our new favorite! I just cooked dinner for 25 over New Years Eve and it was a hit. Very easy to make in large quantities or just for 2. Couldn't believe how juicy the chicken stays. You have to try it.

Thought this was "ok".  Marinated the chicken overnight.  Fried on the stove in olive oil/butter, then added salsa and taco seasoning to the mayo/sour cream, topped with cheese and broiled.  Won't make my top 20 list, but it was decent.

This is really a fantastic recipe. My husband loves this dish at the restaurant, and although the concept is the same, the flavor isn't quite. I would, however, recommend this recipe to everyone who isn't on a diet. Don't hesitate to make this recipe based on the long list of ingredients. The flavor is really worth the effort.

Although this recipe is yummy, it should not be called tequila lime chicken as there is nothing "tequila" or "lime" about it.  The topping makes the dish.

I didn't have any Tequila on hand and I didn't have the  full time for the chicken to marinade, but the dish turned out wonderful anyway. The meat had a very distinct taste and it wasn't to hot for me. I loved this and so did my picky Hubby.
