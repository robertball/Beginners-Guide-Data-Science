Oh. My Goodness. This is seriously like the Holy Grail of potatoes. My whole family INHALED these, then asked for seconds. So very delicious.

THE best mashed potatoes ever. I made them the day before Thanksgiving and then put them in the slow cooker on low setting about 3 hours before dinner. Delicious!

This recipe is great. However if you use all organic natural ingredients like I do you need to use THREE heads of garlic. The GMO garlic heads most people use are much larger because of genetic engineering than organic natural garlic. The rest of the recipe should stay the same. Other than using coconut oil instead of olive oil when you roast the garlic because we all know olive oil is ONLY a healthy oil when cold. NOT WHEN HEATED OR COOKED WITH. I also prefer my mashed potatoes with the skin left on (also healthier) so it makes the recipe much easier and healthier (Minus the crazy Carbs!)

I thought these were okay.  I was afraid that two heads of garlic would be over the top because I'm not a huge garlic fan, but even I would use two the next time I made it, as the garlic flavor was not very strong just using one head.  Made these for Christmas dinner and everyone seemed to like them.

These were good and rich.  I cut the sour cream in half because I didn't have a full cup.  I used baking potatoes with the skins on.  I made about 4 hours ahead of time and kept them warm in the crock pot with a little half and half in the bottom since my oven was full.

Soooo delicious! I'm definately making these again! I didn't have a full 5lb bag of potatoes....but close enough:) Also I had already started boiling potatoes in garlic water when I found this. I can't believe it didn't call for milk! I was skeptical....but I'm loving them!

Great potatoes! They were creamy and delicious. I struggled a bit with the garlic, trying to make it in advance the first time (it got all hard), but by the second round it worked great.  Tip: don't make the roasted garlic in advance! It turned out a really good, basic, tasty mashed potato, which was what I wanted. It wasn't a dish that really stood out, but that being said, most people took seconds.

I made it and chose to keep the skins on and that was a mistake.  Also make sure that potatoes are all the way cooked soft.  The time depends on the size of your chunks.  Great taste.

Very delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I did 5 servings and at the end I added real bacon pieces, because we love bacon. But this was so creamy. My husband and kids told me I’m not allowed to make any other kind of mashed potatoes.

I found them a smidge on the dry side but otherwise, delicious!  This got rave reviews from my daughter but I think I may add a bit of cream or half & half next time.

I had I initially forgotten to add the sour cream so I added a bit of buttermilk. Then when I realized what I'd done, I added the sour cream. It was the perfect t consistency. I also added some chopped fresh chives into the mashed potatoes. This recipe really is fantastic.

Excellent!  Very creamy, garlicky and delicious!  I made ahead of time and put in a casserole dish to warm on low ((200) while my meal was cooking.  Perfect and a great compliment to a rib eye roast along with lemon pepper green beans (recipe also found on this site).  Lovely meal.  Don't change a thing for these potatoes.  I will most definitely make again and again.  Enjoy!

I love these mashed potatoes because they have everything in them! And the recipe makes a ton of potatoes so I love that too. I only make them for holidays though because they're probably not very healthy, haha.

I made these for a lock in at my kids church and tripled the recipe- piled them into a large aluminum roasting pan.  I threw some Parmesan cheese on top of part and cheddar on top of the rest and put them in the oven on 180 or so until it was time to take them over.  Since I made so many I was expecting some left overs. No such luck. All gone :(

Followed this recipe exactly & it was DELICIOUS! Wouldn't change a thing! I can't belive how easy it was & how smooth the potatoes came out. They were perfection! I will always come back to this recipe.
