OK...these were kinda amazing!! I was home alone this evening...craving donuts...but it was too late to make them. I stumbled upon this recipe and I must admit, I was skeptical when I read it. Then, after reading the first few reviews I decided to give it a try. wow!! am I glad I did! They are AWESOME! they really taste like donuts. I did stray from the recipe slightly, cooking mine between 325 & 350 as they seemed to be cooking too fast on the outside at 375. I then put some white sugar in a bag and gave them a shake when they were done. Of course I couldn't stop at one...I've already eaten 3 and poured a big glass of milk. If you follow the directions, you will not be disappointed with this recipe!

These were good, and they were pretty easy.  I'm not sure why the recipe calls for cutting the bread into fourths.  Each "doughnut" was so small and didn't provide much jelly.  I'll try these again but I will, as a previous reviewer suggested, use a thicker bread, and I will leave them in bigger portions with a generous amount of jelly in the center.  Thanks for the fun recipe!

From the recipe submitter:  Try using a smaller amount of jam/jelly on each sandwich prior to cutting into 1/4's.  Day old or any type of bread works just fine. Also, instead of dipping the bread into the batter, try using a spoon to pour it over the 1/4's, and then turn to cover the other side.  Allow the excess the drip off before placing in hot oil.  Happy eating :)

I'm so glad to come across to this recipe. One sunday morning when I woke up from sleep and found nothing to serve for breakfast except bread and jam and I remember that I have printed this recipe so we had this for breakfast with coffee of course. Thank you for this super easy recipe.

I have an EXTREME love for donuts. Its something lovely that you could have for breakfast or as a super sweet late night snack. When i saw this recipe a few agos I knew I had to try it and today, with my loaf of white bread in hand, I decided to make them and MAN O MAN did they come out perfect. Its such a simple recipe that anyone and everyone really should try it.

I sadly didnt have any confectioners sugar, so I didnt get my cherry on top, but I made Orange, Watermelon, Guava and Raspberry donuts and each one is delicious. Definitely will be making them again.

This was really easy and fun for my boys to do. They had a blast making different kind of doughnuts. It was alright for me and my husband, we ate them, but nothing to rave about. I did make them for breakfast one morning and added cream cheese and jelly to the inside, so It was just basically a stuffed french toast, but it was good. I sprinkled mine with Cinn. and sugar.

This very super easy and great when there is nothing in the house but bread & jam.  Kids loved them -- husband not so much.  (he ate them cold)  Would make again in a pinch.

This recipe is great, but could use some tweaking. The batter wasn't very sweet, making the confectioner's sugar a necessary part of the recipe (otherwise they don't taste much like doughnuts). In the future I was add more sugar to the batter. Other than that, these are delicious- what a great, easy way to make jelly-filled doughnuts!

This recipe wasn't worth the effort.  I tried this as is... no go.  Then I took the advice of using a thicker bread.  It still wasn't worth it.  Won't be making these again.

Yummy!  My toddler and I loved these.  i did not have any jam or jelly so I made chocolate pudding and made them chocolate doughnuts.  Very good and you would never know they are made with sandwich bread.

This was the best little doughnut. It was so easy to make and really tasted like a doughnut. I made mine with a little peanut butter also and it was fabulous. I recommend it to anyone looking for a quick easy treat.

Yum! I used peach and apple pie filling in place of jelly and Hawaiian rolls in placed of bread slices.  Yum, again! I will fry for longer next time to get a crunchier donut, similar to a cinnamon twist.

I loved these, they were really tasty and so easy to make, if not a little messy... my only problem was with the icing sugar, i put it on when they were still hot and they just ended up going very soggy :(

My kids loved them. I hated throwing all those crust away, so the kids suggested making extra batter and frying those as well. They came out great! Also, I have one child with a fruit allergy, so we used peanut butter for his filling. His tasted great too. Will make these again!

This is EXCELLENT! It was a very quick and easy recipe.  Its almost like a stuft french toast.  After battering it I also breaded it in panko and it was delicious by giving it a nice cruncy texture.  Very good!

If you are looking for an easier way to make doughnuts than the mix and rice yeast method, this recipe is it!  My kids love it, and so did my husband.  I will definitely be making these again.

These were pretty good.  My 13 month old and 6 year old loved them, my husband and 3 year old thought they were okay.  I used store bought bread, but next time I will either use homemade day old bread or deli bread that's cut thicker.  Using the thin bread made them a little difficult to handle, and gave it more of a mushy taste.  Interesting recipe, thanks!

This is a super recipe for kids, my 11 year old son made these recently and everyone enjoyed. The flavor can be varied easily to accomodate every taste.
