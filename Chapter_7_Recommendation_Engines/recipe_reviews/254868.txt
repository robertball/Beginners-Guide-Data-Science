This was fast and easy! I broiled the fish with garlic pepper, cayenne pepper, and olive oil. I also used organic black beans I made ahead of time and keep in the freezer for quick meals and I used organic long grain rice instead of boxed. I picked from the last of my garden 3 Roma tomatoes, garlic, onion, small yellow bell pepper, and blended. I added cumin, vegetable bouillon and a pinch of cayenne with 4 cups water and 2 cups rice then a bag of frozen corn. Boiled for 15 minutes. Very easy my family loved it. It was not too spicy if you use only a little cayenne.

This dish was really tasty and fairly easy to make! I just made a few changes based on what I had on hand. 1) I seasoned fish with adobo, cumen, and a light dusting of salt and then baked it in the oven at 425* for about 15 minutes. 2) I added fresh onion and yellow pepper, which I just sauted in a skillet to add to the rice mix. I would make this again in a heart beat!
