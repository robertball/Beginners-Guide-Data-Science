This is delicious!  I served it with Tortilla chips (4-5 points depending brand) I also subbed chicken stock for vegetable stock since I had some on hand. The canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce are expensive and you only need 1 t.  Spin the rest in a blender, place teaspoonfuls on a wax paper covered pan, freeze and put portions in plastic bag. Freeze and use as needed.
