This is just chocolate flavored butter.  Neither good or healthy.

I appreciate that you posted this. I've never had anything to post, so thank you for your contribution. Sincerely. That said, I did not enjoy this at all. Texture was good but the ratio, or something made these terrible.

It smelled delicious. I could taste the raspberry, but for some odd reason it tasted really bitter. I made sure I added the right amount, and I did. This isnâ€™t really the recipes fault, but if I had to make it again I would add some more sugar substitute. It was really fun to make and thanks for the recipe!!!

I have made this several times. I think it is nice for a chocolate fix. This does not taste like fudge to me at all.  More like a cheesecake flavor but not the same texture. I omit the nuts and have used different flavorings.

I appreciate you sharing this recipe. This recipe is not very fudgy, it's creamier (aka messier, but worth it) and tastes more like a chocolate cheesecake after a few changes I made. I have made this twice and love it... but I agree with others it was quite bitter the first time. Adjustments I made are: I cut the butter to 1/2 cup, cream to 1 tbsp, cocoa to 5 tbsp. Added an extra tablespoon of sweetener (I used Whole Earth, which is a blend of erythritol, stevia, and monk fruit). I did not use walnuts (personal taste), and in place of raspberry extract (didn't have any) I substituted orange extract the first time and vanilla the second(in addition to the vanilla it already calls for). Both were good. I also had to heat it a little longer than 30 seconds in the microwave and used a square pan instead of the 3x9 cake pan.

I'm on a low carb diet, so I made it hoping to have something tasty once in a while.  It wasn't horrible, but it also didn't make me think it was a delicious treat.

Love the flavor and the versatility of using different extracts and nuts. This comes together quickly and satisfies the sweet craving for those following a keto or low-carb lifestyle.  I used Swerve sweetener. This doesn't have a firm fudge texture, but rather its softer like a block of cream cheese making it a little messy to eat. This makes large servings.  You could definitely cut it into 24 pieces and be satisfied because of the richness. Next time I'll try using coconut extract.
