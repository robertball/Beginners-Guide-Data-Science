These are cute.  I made them for a kids' Spring party.  I used two worms on each cupcake -- 1 across the middle, and 1 cut in half with each half sticking in opposite sides of the cupcake (looks like a worm going in under and coming out from under the other worm).  The kids thought they were "cool."  My cake mix yielded 18 cupcakes.  I barely used 1 cup of "dirt" crumbs.

I used this recipe with a vanilla/chocolate swirl cake mix and it was really, really good!  Everyone at the Halloween party commented on how cute the cake was and they especially LOVED the taste.  You can guarantee that this will be my signature Halloween dish.  Thank you!

So simple and so fun. Kids love these. I also like to sprinkle crushed up oreos on top to resemble dirt. Thanks!

Good recipe.  I made it for my son's Bambi/Woodland party at school and the kids loved them (I thought they were tasty too).  I did have a lot of the dirt topping left over though.

I love this recipe, it was a hit for my sons kindergarten class. The only thing I changed was I made vanilla frosting and used a little green food coloring, so to make the frosting bright green. I also added the fake plastic fangs to stick on the top. The kids loved it!

I did this for my nephews 7th birthdays party (at school), but before baking I put a 1/2 a candy worm in each cupcake. Then after they cooked and cooled I frosted them with green frosting (so each cup cake looked like an apple) then I put a worm on top of each one kind of like a worm crawling out of the apple. This made it more fun for the kids. It was Kind of like they were eating an apple with a worm in it.

Great Halloween material. We made a "scary" dessert table and I brought this cupcakes. The idea is cute and simple to make. They looked yummy, tasted yummy, I loved them. I didn't had cookie crumbs so I used sprinkles.
