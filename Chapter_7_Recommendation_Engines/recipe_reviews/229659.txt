What a shame that I was the only one home while this was cooking! The aroma was awesome, predicting what a great turkey dinner we were in for.  I had a small boneless breast, about 3 pounds, so I adjusted the method, measurements and cooking time to accommodate it, but other than rubbing the roast with some olive oil before sprinkling it with salt, pepper and a little chopped rosemary, I made no substitutions or omissions of ingredients.  I cooked it about 6-1/2 hours on low.  This was fragrant, immensely flavorful and so tender and moist.  The juices it gave off during cooking made for excellent gravy.  When I’m the first reviewer of a recipe, as I am here, and it turns out this good I couldn’t be more pleased to review it.  I served this with Ann’s Rice Pilaf, Chic Green Beans, recipes also from this site, and a tossed green salad.

Very nice recipe. I used chicken broth instead of white wine. The turkey breast was very juicy and tender.

I could only find a 3 lb boneless turkey breast.  It did not have a cavity (I guess since it's boneless), so I put the thyme and rosemary sprigs on the very bottom of the crockpot.  Then I placed 32 oz. peeled baby carrots, one bunch of chopped celery, and one medium chopped onion on top of the herbs.  I topped that with the pats of butter, but only 1/3 of a cup instead of half. I placed the turkey on top of that and sprinkled with a little bit of salt and pepper.  Then I poured in the wine and cooked it on low for 6 hours.  My crockpot tends to run hot or cook fast, or something of the sort.  I think I inadvertently poured a little more than half the bottle of wine in the crockpot.  It was delicious.  It smelled wonderful while cooking, the whole family enjoyed it, and the turkey was very moist.  I served this with some stuffing on the side.  This is an excellent meal, and I will definitely be making it again.  Thank you for posting!

Superb, husband loves it.  I use dried herbs instead of fresh.  Have had trouble getting hold of a decent sized turkey breast so have made with turkey steaks (adjusted cooking time) as well a huge butterflied breast I found for sale at the butchers (put the required ingredients inside then rolled and tied before putting into the slow cooker).

This was so easy and quick! Cooked a 7lb breast on high for about 5 hrs and it just fell apart. I did use half the wine and half chicken broth as another user suggested. Thank you for the awesome recipe it was so moist and juicy and a big hit with the family!

I use this all the time!  I also add baby carrots  and fresh sage.  Plus I never measure the wine nor the herbs.  My kids call it my drunken turkey, but it has the most delicious aroma when it is cooking and the meat is very moist.

This was outstanding and so easy. I didn't change a thing. The turkey was very moist and flavorful and the juices made a delicious gravy. Don't omit the wine. It's a must for the flavor.

Amazing and simple recipe!  I used sparkling white wine and chicken stock 50/50 and it turned out great! Second time I made this I just used chix broth and added orange zest to make a really unique turkey.  I use this as a base for any turkey recipe now, thank you!

Bland, bland, bland.  I prepared this exactly as stated, and it was just okay.  Lacked flavor, and it was DRY!  Dry in a slow cooker???  Who knew that was possible.  I made it for a dinner party, and I'm just thankful I made the "Awesome broccoli-cheese casserole", because it saved the whole dinner.

Made this almost according to the recipe. I substituted Turkey Stock for the wine as I wanted regular turkey gravy.  Made the dressing separate in the oven.  Will make again.

As my turkey breast was maybe 3 pounds,  and my crockpot may run hot, it was done in 4 hours tops.  I  did add carrots to the crock pot.  I also added some garlic powder and olive oil as well.  The turkey was a little dry but the liquid made a nice gravy.  It was worth trying but probably not try this recipe again.

Used dried herbs rather than fresh, and a can of chicken broth instead of the wine, since that's what I had on hand.  Came out delicious, and just as good the next day on a cold sandwich for lunch.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

The flavour in the Turkey was amazing.  I also added fresh dill, marjoram and sage to give added flavour.  I used about 3/4 of a bottle of wine and periodically basted the turkey with the herbs and wine (was at home on a Sunday when cooking this.) Would definitely make it again!

I admit I hate roasting a turkey so I was looking for an easier process and this worked out wonderfully.  The cooking time was much less than stated so I would check the temperature after a few hours. The wine flavor was stronger than I would have liked so next time I would use half wine, half chicken broth.

I used a 6 lb bone in Turkey breast and had to break the breast bones in order to fit in in my 6 quart slowcooker.  I added carrots and celery and a mix of dry herbs (mural of flavor from Penzey's) and instead of wine I used about a cup of dry white vermouth because that is what I had plus stock.  It makes the most amazing gravy.   You do have to strain out the solids and I don't eat the skin.   I make a roux to make the gravy, cut the meat off the bones and reheat everything together.

I made this to specifications with one difference.  I didn't have fresh herbs but it was still great!  I did take it out of the crock pot, cut the strings off and broiled it for like 5 minutes just because my old fashioned dad would have been weirded out by the lack of golden brown that is typical for oven turkey. But let me tell you, it was moist and juicy, they way turkey never was in my house growing up!

This is so good.  Let me start by saying I am not a huge turkey fan but a special diet we are on requires we eat lots of turkey breast.  I made this as written except left out the butter.  For the white wine I used dry sherry because I had it.  It was really good.  Fell off the bone and very flavorful.  Might be the only way I cook turkey from now on.  Easy, flavorful and healthy.

I had a very small turkey breast, just two pounds, so I adjusted the ingredients and the cooking time accordingly. Very quick to put together and very moist and tender but I found the celery overpowered the other flavours. I used a dry white wine and the turkey was done in just under three hours. I served this with oven fries and roasted cauliflower.

This recipe was amazing. I added about 6 potatoes and two sweet onions to it, and used cicken bullion instead of white wine since my mother can't have alcohol. Turkey stove top stuffing makes a wonderful side dish. This is definitely something I plan on making regularly.

Checked at 5 hours and it was overdone (5# turkey breast on high as stated in the recipe). May try again and check at 4 hours or 6+ hours on low.

This is a really great recipe. Even my son, a super picky eater, loved it and asked me to make it again! It is also very easy! The only change I made was adding half chicken broth / half white wine. Really delicious and the house smelt so good!!!

I used a three- pound turkey roast and cut back on the veggies accordingly, but not the wine or herbs.  I set the slow cooker to Low for 8 hours.  The turkey was delicious and moist.  We live at high altitude (7,000’) , so cooking time might be less at sea level; but 8 hours on Low worked here. I’ll be delighted to do this again.  Thank you so much!

Very disappointing, considering all the fresh herbs and the wine.

Oops!  I didn't realize that the recipe called for boneless turkey breast until the morning after.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The breast weighed 6lbs and was done in 4.5 hours. It should have been, considering it was essentially simmering in a flood of butter and wine. Too much of both I have a feeling the turkey was cooked after 4hrs because chunks of meat literally fell off the ribs back into the soup, which is maybe what I should have made. My husband wasn't thrilled. No good sandwiches but the house did smell good!
