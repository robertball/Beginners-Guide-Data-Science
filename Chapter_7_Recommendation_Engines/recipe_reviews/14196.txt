You really need a good quality balsamic vinegar with this dish.  I allowed the strawberries to saok in the sugar for a couple hours before serving.  Add the vinegar and pepper only just before serving or they will not add any flavor.

Very easy and delicious! This is one of those recipes that's really great and so simple yet tastes really good. It's surprisingly elegant and not to mention low fat! Definitely a "guilt free" treat.

This is v good.  It'd impress your guest, while being terribly easy to do.  I think one needs to soak  the berries with the sugar for longer than 10 mins, more like 45 mins if possible - I also added basil leaves, for fragrance.  The balsamic vinegar and pepper, served separately for your guest to add himself, gives the sweetness a subtle complexity.  Good accompaniment for a savory breakfast dish.

I made this salad for easter dinner, as we had a bunch of strawberries and didn't want them to go to waste - it was quite good. I must say, if you do make it, don't make it ahead of time and let it sit before you serve it, otherwise you lose the flavour of the balsamic vinegar. I noticed when I made it you could taste it, and it was a nice combination, but by the time we actually served dinner (an hour later), it just tasted like sweet strawberries. Give it a go, just serve it right away!

This recipe was great! I served it for Easter dinner along with 6 other dishes and lots of people said it was one of the best. Don't let other reviews scare you off from this awesome fruit dish. I thought it was great. The pepper and vinegar added a perfect touch to a sugary strawberry salad. I wasn't sure about how it would turn out when I looked at the recipe. But, I tried it and I'm glad I did. No wonder they put this recipe in the cookbook!

Tastes only slightly different from plain strawberries with sugar.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't totally different from my other strawberry experiences.

Superb.  Balsamic vinegar really does go with everything.  I thought the black pepper was going to be wierd, but it lent really well to the sweetness of the brown sugar and strawberries as well as the tartness contributed by the balsamic vinegar.  You have to try it to take my word for it.  I served it the first time with a dab of whipped cream.  The second time I added blueberries to the recipe, and the third time I served the latter a la mode.  I think this is a great topping for ice cream at a party, and can't wait to see how it is accepted by guests.

I liked this, mostly because it was so unusual.  But I'm not sure it was any better than strawberries simply sprinkled with sugar.

I would have never guessed this combo would be so good... it got rave reviews.  It also went very well with feta chicken (you can find that recipe here too) and a side of pasta with pesto sauce.  A sophisticated meal without the sophisticated preparation!

Can I give this more than five stars?????? Excellent. I can't believe how good this was. My kids (13 and 5) ate every bit of this and the 13-year-old took some in her lunch box today. So quick and easy. Probably will never make strawberries any other way again. THANK YOU!!!

I was expecting something special.  The flavor of the balsamic vinegar was lost in the sugared strawberries.  I won't be wasting good strawberries on this recipe again.

It's amazing how adding one "odd" ingredient to the mix can bump up traditional strawberries and sugar. This was beyond easy. I added a touch of agave nectar and white sugar in addition to the brown sugar and let sit for 30 minutes before adding the balsamic vinegar and refrigerating.  I topped the berries onto homemade crepes, spread some Nutella in there and added homemade whipped cream. It was delicious! Don't fear the vinegar! It gives it a teeny, tiny kick, but it's one of those flavors you wouldn't be able to pinpoint because the mixture is perfectly sweet. There are endless possibilities to accompany this dish. Thank you!

I really loved this. I cut back o the sugar by 1/2 T and added some fresh basil (as suggested by reviewer). Anytime pepper is called for, I call for a little more. ;) This was perfect and simple. Thank you!

Surprisingly excellent. I didn't have plain balsamic vinegar in my pantry, I thought it was raspberry...but nope it was pomegramate balsamic vinegar....well it worked out great. I was very skeptical about doing this. But the strawberries needed to be used up and what a excellent recipe. I wouldn't do anything different then I did with this recipe. Bravo, to the one that recommended ito me. YUM!!

I loved this simple, tasty recipe.  I used the Splenda Brown Sugar blend and it tasted awesome!  My family turned their noses up at the thought of black pepper pn strawberries so I probably will not use it next time but, I will put the peppermill on the table so my guests can add freshly ground pepper if they desire.  I have used different grades of balsamic vinegar and the cheaper version was too tart; stick to the good stuff.  I think next time I will add a dash of vanilla.  Definitely a keeper!

I sliced my strawberries (wish I had just halved them like in allrecipe sphoto) & then let them sit in the sugar for about an hour ...which was a bit too long I think for the sliced berries....they got a little mushy in their juices. So if I were using slices I wouldn't let them sit for that long but I think halves would hold up better. And then i waited untl serving beore sprinkling w/ balsamic as adviced by reviewers. Wsa a perfect side for an upscale 4th of July menu..thansk Edie Moon!

Interesting if your strawberries don't pop with flavor. Normally I like my strawberries "as is" but when they need something the addition of balsamic vinegar and pepper gives a nice kick.

Delicious!  The thought of balsamic vinegar and black pepper on the berries just doesn't sound "right".  I'm here to tell you - it not only works, but it is delicious!  Great way for a quick fruit to add with a meal.  Thanks Edie Moon for sharing.

Really, REALLY yummy. WinCo had strawberries for .98/lb. so I stocked up. When I did a recipe search, this came up. I actually had a little of this over lowfat frozen vanilla yogurt and it was off the charts incredible. So good. I agree with a previous reviewer that you need a good quality balsamic. I could see how the outcome could be less than desirable if you didn't. NOTE: I made this again and served it to my kids tonight for dessert over strawberry five minute ice cream. They flipped for it. Nothing left.

Woah!  First of all, I didn't think this would work at all.  Second, I don't usually really like strawberries because they are a little too tart for me.  THIS WAS AWESOME.  The perfect sweetness and tenderness.  Really amazing, you have got to try it!

Really good for a side dish to go with BBQ meat. Not very peppery at all-I was a little disappointed but the Balsamic added a nice contrast to the sweetness of the berries. A keeper for sure.

After I tried this my thought was, "There are lots of other ways I would rather eat strawberries."  Was curious and thought I'd try something different, but probably won't make again.

I needed to add a little more sugar, but otherwise it was just like sweetened strawberries.  I was a bit disappointed.  It is a nice idea, however, over some frozen vanilla yogurt or ice cream.

These berries were a fun change to just strawberries and sugar, but really I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  This is a nice start to a strawberry and spinach salad, though.

A very simple salad.  I have been eating this for years, but use Splenda in place of the brown sugar. A great way to get a yummy fruit serving in your day.

My cynic daughter who "Never eats vinegar" was amazed, as was I.  It makes the berries taste sweet as I remember them being growing up.  It will be a regular for us now. I am taking it to a cookout today. I doubled it and it may not make it.  I may have to make more.

This was really good!  I experimented with both regular and black cherry balsamic vinegars and liked both.  The only thing I think I might reduce is the pepper.  It was a little too much for my taste, but I think I'll start though by not grinding it as fine and see how that works.  Great recipe overall and so simple!

This was awesome! Really wasn't expecting the flavor to turn out the way it did. In the past I've been afraid to marry flavors together so know I'm trying to step outside of the box. Baby steps.

This is a wonderful recipe. I add a bit of water to mine to dilute the vinegar somewhat, and to give me something to help coat the berries in. Thanks for the recipe! (I like this better than the white sugar versions.)

I love recipes like this, when the ingredients make you think twice. I almost decided against it. That would have been a mistake. I actually went a little heavy on my measurements, the faint hint of freshed crushed pepper was such a wonderful twist. My husband couldn't place the flavors, but went back for thirds. He loved it and said it was better than plain sugar because the berries didn't get stickey. This will be a recipe to take to gatherings, its easy, tastes great and the ingredients will shock all who ask. Loved it.

Wow - Had no idea what to expect with this. It was so good! Usually use regular sugar with strawberies but I will always use brown sugar from now on. Used a little less balsamic - Really good! Thanks for the recipe.

12.30.17  I did cut back a bit on the amount of brown sugar and probably added more ground pepper (didn't measure), but that's personal taste preference.  So simple, so fast, and just never fails to please...LOVE balsamic strawberries. Served today with a dollop of Greek vanilla yogurt and a sprig of fresh mint.

I have made this recipes dozens, perhaps hundreds of times, but I use chocolate balsamic vinegar. I have also tried raspberry balsamic which is good, too.

I made a small amount of this salad last night and both Hubs and I liked it very much.  I used 9 oz. of fresh strawberries that I quartered and brought to room temperature.  I cut the brown sugar back to just about 1½ t. and added it about an hour before dinner.  Just before serving I tossed in a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar and a few grinds of black pepper.  I’m glad I cut back on the sugar because I think it would have been too sweet for us had I used the proper amount.  In hindsight, I probably skimped on the pepper and would add a bit more next time.  This was a nice change and we’ll be making it again!

This was an Amazing salad and I was asked by my family to add this to my regular rotation of salads. I agree with other reviewers that the strawberries needed to be marinated longer than 10 minutes. I tried this on its own as written & the second time I made it, I served it over romaine lettuce with slivered almonds on top. This was my family's favorite way to have this salad. I will definitely make this again & highly recommend this to all.

It was pretty good. On my second helping, I sprinkled a little bit of fresh feta cheese crumbles on top of it and it tasted great.

Amazing! I cut the berries into chunks, let them sit longer than 10 minutes (closer to 45). I added the balsamic right before serving. I put a small bed of arugula on each plate and topped with the berries. Delish! One son had a huge helping of seconds - despite eyeing it skeptically when he sat down to his plate.

Made this for dinner tonight. Because I had a late lunch I was not hungry for hearty dinner. This hit the spot! I had a l lb. container of "about to expire" strawberries in my fridge (on sale this week for $1!!!), so I decided to give this a whirl, scaling to 3 servings (as close to 1 lb. measurement as possible). My verdict??? Unusual? Yes. Different from plain 'ol strawberries with sugar. No (but yes to minus the stickiness). Having said that, when the craving strikes, I DO think I'll prepare my fresh strawberries this way. After all, I ate ALL 3 SERVINGS lol! If I'm preparing strawberries to serve with pound / angel food cake or "shortcake style," I think I'll stick with the white sugar version, but for everything else, I'll stick with this. I think this would be EXCELLENT served with fresh basil too (mmm...) or as a green salad prepared with fresh spinach, candied pecans and feta or goat cheese (thanks for the suggestion fellow reviewers!). One more thought.... The most helpful reviews are just that - helpful (so take heed!). Two things I gleaned from reading all the reviews: a) use the BEST balsamic you can find / afford (it DOES make a difference!) and b) add your vinegar / pepper mixture IMMEDIATELY before serving. I ate mine right away, so this was a non-issue for me. Thanks for sharing, Edie :-) What a great use for fresh summer produce!
