The flavor of this marinade is out of this world-in fact I now use just the marinade recipe with just regular chicken breasts for the grill. In the future with the kabobs I will keep some extra marinade and baste them while grilling. They seemed to get slightly dry. The taste was very good though! A+

Really good!  I love the Montreal chicken seasoning and what it does to grilled chicken. I doubled the sauce and in one bag, marinated the chicken, and in the other marinated zucchini, red onions, & red bell peppers, skewering them each on separate skewers due to different cooking time requirements.  I think I would use lemon juice rather than vinegar next time.  Added a skewer of pineapple chunks at the last minute; didn't marinate them but did brush some on as they grilled.  Delicious!

These were very good. We went camping with a group of friends and made these on our night to cook. My husband coundnt find the Chicken grill seasoning so we used the Montreal Steak, spicy, seasoning and they were great. Found some metal skewers at Big Lots for cheap, they work much better than the crummy,always-burn-regardless-of-how-long-you-soak wood ones. Great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! And amazingly easy! I've tried so many grilled chicken marinades using yogurt, lemon juice and a million other ingredients. This recipe only requires a few great ingredients and results in a delicious dish! I marinated the whole chicken breasts for 2 hours, cubed them and put them on skewers with zuchinni, mushroom, red onion and yellow peppers. It came out tender and delicious. My guests love it!

Pretty good, but could have used a bit more zip. Not sure what could be added.

This marinade ROCKS!! I made a double batch of the marinade, & reserved some for basting. We used red & green bell peppers, zucchini, & Vidalia onions. I marinated everything in a baggie overnight- TOO GOOD FOR WORDS!!!

I did the kabobs for a father's day meal, the marinade was fabulous! I did homemade rice pilaf and a green salad along side and it was perfect! Great recipe!

Very good.  I also added some garlic powder to the mix.  The vegetables turned out extremely delicious.  I do think next time that I will keep the chicken breasts whole and just skewer the vegetables because the veggies seem to cook faster. Either was this marinade is great.

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  I made this yesterday for our 4th of July Celebration and it was awesome! My entire family loved it! They raved about the intense flavor, tenderness of the meat, and the marinade! Instead of marinating the meat and veggies for 30 minutes, I marinated it for about 1-2 hours to ensure the meat would suck up the spices and flavor. I also used white cooking wine instead of the white wine vinegar. While grilling I made some additional marinade to brush the kabobs with which added to succulent taste.  Great recipe! Great flavor! Simply amazing!  This will definitely go in the recipe box :).
