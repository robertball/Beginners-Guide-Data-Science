Delicious! I chose this recipe because I thought the bread crumbs would be an interesting alternative to the usual (and overused) parmesan. It was. Since I didn't use the called-for cheese, this dish became all about the breadcrumbs. I actually used some very intensely flavored garlic herb flatbread cracker crumbs. The combination of crisp toasted crumbs with the sweet-sour bacon dressing and the fresh beans was absolutely addictive. I only used about 1/4 cup water and quickly stir fried at high heat. These cooked up perfectly in about seven minutes. I will make these often.

I made these for company, and they looked just lovely.  I personally loved them, most people seemed to enjoy but not rave about them, and my husband didn't like them at all.  :-) I loved them enough that I'll give them four stars, though!!

Good flavor, but too much pepper. Next time I will cut the pepper in half.

Excellent!  The balsamic vinegar gives it a nice flavor and sweetness.  I didn't have reg bacon, but sauteed the onions in bacon grease. Later I added a few crumbled pieces of micro bacon. The beans were no way near done at the cooking time suggested. I cooked them ~15 min more min, and they were still a little hard. Maybe because they were not fully submerged in water? The next time, I will either steam or boil the beans separately and add to the sauce.  I also used Ritz crackers that I added a little melted butter and garlic to and toasted briefly in a small frying pan. Topped the beans with that and parmesan cheese. Thanks for this recipe, Barbara!

Used only 5 slices of bacon, didn't use the bread crumbs or cheese and used minced garlic since that was what I had. Guessed at the amount of green beans (was pretty close). It did take about 20 minutes to get them done to how we like them and man, were they good! The vinegar gives these a little kick that is perfect. Will make these again!!!

These beans are absolutely delicious and would be a perfect holiday side dish.  I did not think shredded cheese would be good on green beans, but it works surprisingly well.

I've made this twice.  1st time on the stove as directed but the beans were large and took quite some time to cook and still weren't cooked to our liking.  2nd time I microwaved until barely tender crisp then put in the pan with the bacon and Mission Fig basalmic vinegar - no bread crumbs or cheese.  Awesome and done to perfection.  I'll make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor was delicious!  My only issue was with presentation.  The cheese and breadcrumbs was very clumpy.  I'll try this again soon because it was a very tasty way to prepare green beans.  But I think I'll layer it in a casserole dish and omit the stirring.  Overall, though, I'd say Try it!  You'll like it!

I ditched the casserole for this recipe for Thanksgiving, and now I will be using it year-round! I will probably use slightly less bacon next time to lighten it a tad (there was a pretty good amount of grease at the bottom after cooking was finished and it all cooled). I cut the cheese by half and used Parmesan, and I'm glad I did. The Italian blend at the amount called for would have really overpowered the green beans, in my opinion. But don't skip the balsamic vinegar! It smells very strong at first but cooks beautifully with the flavors of everything else! My husband was upset that I added it, because it stunk up the whole kitchen at first, but he raved about how excellent the final product was! With a few minor changes, this is a 5-star recipe, and definitely one I will come back to again and again!

This recipe is SO good!  I didn't use cheese or breadcrumbs because there was so much flavor, it didn't need it!  It was such a huge hit at thanksgiving, it was requested for Christmas too. Reminds me of a good German potato salad.

VERY GOOD! I've been asked to make these every time we have a family get together. I've never added the bread crumbs and cheese to the top. We like to eat them right from the pot. Soft and Salty, southern style.

This has to be one of the best, if not THE BEST green bean recipe that I have ever made. My husband is one of the hardest food critics that I cook for and he couldn't get enough of them. I made them last week and he is already requesting them again for Sunday dinner tomorrow.
