This is definitely a five star recipe; and it's really easy to prepare.  I did a couple things differently.  I saw no need to peel the zucchini, and as a result it was not mushy, but nice and crisp. The unpeeled zucchini also gave great color to the dish! I cooked the rice separately. I brought a 15 oz. can of Swanson's 97% chicken broth and added enough water to make two cups of liquid. To the 2 cups of boiling liquid I added a tsp. salt, and one cup of long grain rice and cooked the rice until it was just tender. After the vegetables finish cooking I combined them with the hot cooked rice. Then as a finishing touch, I added 3/4 cup of Monterey Jack(suggestion of a previous Reviewer).  I've cooked "Zucchini Saute" twice to raving reviews.  It's a very tasty dish!

Delicious!  I would recommend, however, doubling the rice and using a larger variety of vegetables in place of some of the zucchini.  I did so and it was magnificent.  :-)

Rather than add salt I used chicken broth in place of the water and it gave it a great flavor. Everyone loved it!

This recipe is so delicious and healthy. I skip the oil entirely and just saute the onions (and garlic!) in water, which makes this recipe pretty much fat free. I also double the rice so I can eat it as a main. Fantastic!

(Some changes I've tried: You can easily substitute the zucchini with cucumber, and Jen's "yogurt cheese dressing" (3 tbsp. yogurt, 1 tbsp. prepared mustard, 1 tbsp. grated parmesan cheese) is fantastic stirred throughout the dish. Yum!)

I made this the other night... it was yummy. I added some yellow squash to it for some color, and totally omitted the rice and water.  Turned out wonderful. Will make again.

The receipe was simple yet delicious.  It is inexpensive to make and clean up is easy with this one pot meal.  My husband and I will definately prepare this one again!  

(Note Variation: I did not have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes w/Italian herbs by Contadina that I had on hand).

This is an excellent base receipe.  I subsituted the 2 tomatoes for a can of diced tomatoes and chilies.  I also saute the onion with some fresh garlic.  It was terrific.  My family loved it.

Very easy and tasty!  I sauteed the veggies until they were a little on the carmelized side which made the dish have great flavor.  I didn't change the recipe at all and I loved it.  I just added salt and pepper to taste at the end.  I will def make this one again!

my picky son loved this.  I made half the recipe since we have only 3 total in my family.  used half a red onion, 1 zucchini(probably 1/2 a pound), 1 green pepper, 1 yellow pepper, 1 tomato.  i added some oregano and garlic powder as well.  it was quite simple, yet filling and delicious at the same time.  the almost 7 year old had seconds!  will make again.

This was great with some modifications.

I added broccli, yellow squash, and cucumber.  I also used canned tomoatoes (make sure you drain them first or it gets to watery).  I doubled the rice and used chicken broth instead of water.  Also stirred in monteray jack at the end.  Very good!

Very good and quick. I also left the skin on the zucchini and sliced them in half. Used seasoned chopped tomatoes....drained, but added some of the juice towards the end of cooking time. Also cooked the rice separate and added after veggies were cooked. Good stuff!!

I felt like this recipe was very bland even after I made some adjustments.  I substituted chicken broth for the water, added fresh minced garlic, oregano, and garlic salt and it was still pretty bland.  I followed the recipe exactly other than the seasonings.

This was good, and healthy, but I found it a bit bland. I added a bit more pepper and 1/3 cup store bought salsa and it gave it a nice kick! I will make this again.

I loved this recipe! I made it for my husband and I for a special dinner and then I ate the left overs the next day for lunch. I recomend putting some montery jack cheese on it and letting it melt! That is a great mix! I added a little extra rice then what it calls for to make it more of a meal.

I LOVE this recipe. The only thing I do use seasonings to make it more falvourful (usually seasoning salt, onion powder, and celery seed) and dress it with just a touch of Parmesan.

I found it to be very bland.  Next time I think I will use a can of seasoned diced tomatoes in place of the water used to cook the rice.  Maybe add some cashews and parsley.  Definitely needs some seasoning,

Was good, but could have used some seasonings. I added garlic, garlic salt and more salt and pepper. The peel on the zucchini would have kept it from getting mushy.

This was pretty good, but I added a lot more spices than just ground black pepper, because like that it would've been a bit bland.

I use brown rice and cook the zucchini before hand.  It takes too long otherwise.  Another thing that I do after it is done, it put a little chicken/beef stock in it.  Makes it taste even better.  YUM!!

Love this receipt.  So easy to make.   Takes a little longer then 30 minutes.  The end result is worth the wait.

This was excellent ! Very quick and easy to make. I used chicken broth instead of water, 5 min rice, and extra seasoning and didn't peel zucchini. My entire family loves it ! Will absolutely put this in our dinner rotation !

This is very tasty.  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onion and also used yellow squash in addition to the zucchini.  Since I wanted to use brown rice, I cooked it separately and added before serving.

Even though I didn't add the rice or use all the spices that was stated. Instead I use garlic salt and lemon pepper and I got great raves on how it tasted. Thanks for sharing it.

Used a red onion and added yellow squash and portobello mushrooms. Left out the tomato and rice. Used extra virgin olive oil and added a bit of fresh basil and garlic as well. Comes together very quickly.

My neighbor, who has a huge garden, brought me some fresh zucchini, cherry tomatoes, and a green bell pepper today and lo and behold, there was this recipe. I love that it includes a grain to round it out and everyone loved it.  My husband kept saying how great it was and even my 20 mo. old liked it.  Thank you! I forgot to peel half of the zucchini and didn't think it made much of a difference and next time I'll use five minute rice as my rice took too long, but otherwise yum.

Ug, this dish was awful.  Everything cooked up fine and it looked great.  But it was SO bland.  I even added some seasoning as I sauteed the vegetables and a bit more as the rice cooked.  Following the advice here, I'd skip the rice and add garlic.

I added crushed garlic (fresh) and this was a great way to fix the fresh veggies from our garden. I didn't think I liked zucchini before, but the tomatoes and onion added a bit of sweetness. I didn't bother with the rice or water, as I wanted a strictly vegetable dish. We will make this again for sure!

Delicious!  Although next time I think I'll just cook the rice seperately, as it wasn't quite done and the veggies were getting mushy, which didn't bother my fiance, b/c he likes mushy veggies.  I didn't have a fresh pepper, so I used jarred roasted red peppers, and it was an excellent substitution! yummy :o)

Very nice recipe Leah! Instead of the two tomatoes, I used salsa and a few more seasonings. Delish!

This recipe was very good. I left out the green pepper because I didn't have one at home. I did not peel the zucchini first because I was afraid it would get mushy. I also used a can of diced tomatoes because we didn't have any fresh. I used brown rice instead of white so I let it simmer longer and used about 3/4 cup of water. I made this last night to bring to work for lunch and it was perfect. The flavor is so fresh.

It's a great, quick, and healthy way to feed some hungry boys!  I pre-cut and package the onion, red bell pepper, and zuccihini. When I'm ready to cook, I slice up a tomato.  As there's always rice in the rice cooker, this is a simple meal to make! I love to serve it with some garlic chicken.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make even in my tiny little German kitchen. I added a little paprika because it's the only other spice I have and used sesame oil to saute the onions (and like others suggested I added garlic). I also put a little gouda on top and just a little helped bring out all the flavors. I also used 8 min. rice so my zucchini would not be overcooked and it wouldn't take as long. Overall, I will definitely make again as it's easy to make while I'm here in Germany and inexpensive, but healthy and filling. Thanks!

A little bland for my taste, but it was ok.  We added salsa to it, and that made it a little better.  It was very healthy, which kind of made up for the dull taste.

I recently made this for dinner and it was a great base dish!  Make sure you cut the zucchini into at least 1 inch slices and quarter those slices.  I think people may have had a problem with mushy veggies because of smaller cut sizes.  I added a dash or two of crushed red pepper flakes to add a little kick.  Still needs a little something, look forward to experimenting with it though!

I went to the Farmers Market today to pick up fresh vegetables specifically for this recipe. As it turned out, my boyfriend called to take me out to dinner.  But I decided to make this recipe for my mom who was grilling steak.  It was great!  I didn't add the rice because I just wanted vegetables and I did saute some fresh garlic with the onions. Despite my boyfriend coming to pick me up in a hour, I kept eating the Zucchini Saute!  Needless to say, I am not going to be very hungry for dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe Leah!

It was okay. I had doubled the recipe and after 25 minutes the liquid was still not absorbed, the rice was still firm and the zucchini was completely soggy, almost nonexistent. I had added fresh garlic cloves which gave it great flavor, I will try it again but will follow the original recipe. I also omitted the green pepper and tomatoes.

I added a bit of shredded cheese on top and let it melt while on my plate. It's a pleasant healthy recipe but I found myself wanting more rice. I'll double it next time.

I did change this recipe a bit before making it...we are trying to eat more healthily, so I used brown long-grain rice, which I sauteed before cooking entirely...I also added fresh ginger to the stir-fried ingredients...then I stir fried all of it together...very good!

A nice easy meal with bread on the side, or make as a side dish. I also doubled the rice and water in the dish and added some of my husband's favourite mixed herbs (he went back for seconds).

I added a lot more rice and used proportionate veggie broth instead of water.  I think by the time I was done adding rice, I used a full cup of rice, 2 cups of veggie broth.  It was wonderful served along side of pork chops last night.  Next time I'll read some reviews and try some of those suggestions because this obviously is a recipe that can be tinkered with. Thanks for posting!

We had this the other night. It was good, but rather bland. We had to add extra salt and pepper. I would eat again but I think I would cook it in chicken broth of some thing to give it more flavor.

I doubled the recipe,  used yellow bell peppers instead of green, and added soy (1 tbsp), garlic and ginger (1 tsp each). When it was done, I added 1 pound of steamed shrimp. Even my child who normally wouldn't touch zucchini with a 10-foot pole loved it and got seconds. This is definitely a keeper!

Made this dish for 150+people as one of many side dishes. I precooked rice, didn't peel zucc all the way, used chicken broth instead of water and added cajun seasoning. I am a big fan of anything vegetable and this was no exception. I scooped some of the rice/vegie  without the zucchini just for me for the next day. It was great  as a cold side with a few pieces of rotisserie chicken for lunch

I have made this three times, each time a little different while sticking to the basic recipe. The last time I added yellow bell pepper and cherry tomatoes for flavor and color along with some Italian spices and when adding the rice and liquid I added chicken breasts which had been cut into cubes. This cooked the chicken nicely and makes for a great main course dinner. I also added more rice than the recipe calls for as it also makes good leftovers. Finally, I reduced the liquid/rice ratio a bit as the vegetables had some remaining liquid so the final result was not so 'wet'. Delicious simple recipe which lends itself to many variations.

Used riced cauliflower instead of rice, added at the same time as the other veggies. I also added 1 yellow squash, and added garlic with the onion. Turned out great.

This is really good, but I would not have it under diabetic recipes. Rice especially white rice is known for making glucose levels soar.

Delicious! Instead of rice, I used 1/3c of quinoa. Added two yellow squash, chicken broth, and three cloves of garlic. I will most definitely make this little delight again, and again, and again!

Trying to find healthy and diabetic friendly meals that my entire family enjoys can be challenging from time to time. This was definitely a winner in a house of picky eaters. 
this should be put in the meal rotation for sure!!
