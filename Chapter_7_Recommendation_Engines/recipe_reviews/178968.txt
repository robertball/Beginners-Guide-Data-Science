I put a different spin on this, but what makes it yummo is the creamy sauce and the cornbread stuffing - I used Stove Top.  I didn't grate the veggies and I just used yellow squash and onions.  Added a little cheese to the stuffing mix you top with and my family loves it!

Had some extra squash 2 use & wanted something different.  Made recipe as written YUM!  Even my daughter who dislikes squash liked this enough to go back 4 seconds! Easy, tasty, & quick fits the bill @ my house. Thanks, it's a keeper.

Per other reviewers and other recipes of this i've tried,  finely diced the squash/zucchini vs. shredding.  I sauted them with diced onions and celery in place of the carrots. Once slightly tender, I mixed the veggies with the sour cream and soup.  I covered with one sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers and then used 2c of the blue bag of Pepperidge Farm crushed stuffing not the cornbread.  Delicious.  Needed a little S&P but very popular hit at our house.  A keeper for sure.  Thanks!!

I give it a 4 because I added to it or changed some things. I didn't have cheddar cheese, but I had Monterey Jack cheese, so I used that. I added a little more sour cream than called for, I added 1 onion to the squash mix, I used about 2 cups more zucchini, 1/2 cup of french fried onions to the 1/2 cup of dressing I sat aside. After I spread the squash mix on the dressing I layered about 8 oz. of Muenster cheese on top of that. I finished off with the french fried onions I had mixed with the 'sat aside' dressing. Next time I will add chopped basil from the garden. This is a good recipe and will get rid of a lot of that garden zucchini. It also tasted the same if not better the next day. Next I will try freezing it. Katherine

i love this recipe - so easy!  i diced the squash instead of shredding, also chopped an onion, and sauted the veggies until they started to soften, then added to the mixture. this allowed me to cook it for only 20 minutes just to heat it thru. even my picky kid ate two helpings!

My whole family asks for this.  I don't have the fat free ingredients, but used regular sour cream, and cream of chicken soup. As some don't like cheese, I eliminated that, but tastes just as great! And I have made it without the carrots when I didn't have any.  Still marvelous taste.

This recipe is my favorite for squash casserole and will only use this from now on.  The dry stuffing mix really makes this dish.  The only things that I did differently was added some garilc powder to the soup mixture, I sauted the squash and zuchinni until just tender (also added a chopped onion here) so that the bake time would be less.  Also added some french fried onions to the top too!  Definitely a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe, but I use herbed bread stuffing instead of corn bread stuffing, also must add onion!  Those who thought it was bland may want to try this.

I did not shred the squash.  I cubed it and added some caramelized chopped onions and red bell pepper.  I did end up adding 10 minutes to the cooking time since I did not shred the squash.  I also used seasoned stove top stuffing which made this recipe very tasty.

Loved it!!  I didn't have any bread crumbs in the house and decided to make a box of Jiffy corn muffins instead!!  Worked out perfectly!  All six muffins, crumbled made the 3 cups of bread crumbs I needed... of course, it was lacking the seasoned flavor of PF stuffing, so I added some random Italian seasonings.... eye-balled it, so I can't really tell you what or how much I put in there... sorry! I used one zucchini, one yellow summer squash, one "8-Ball" zucchini squash and one yellow zucchini; two chopped leaks and two large carrots. I also chose to not mix the cheese into the mix, but sprinkled it on top of the casserole and then the reserved muffin crumbs on top of the cheese!  Yuummmmy!!!  I'm going back for seconds!!  ;-)

Nice casserole but a little bland even though I added the onion suggested by several reviewers.  I thought the flavor of the stuffing mix covered up the flavor of the squash.  Probably would be a big hit with those who aren't that crazy about squash.

It was a little on the bland side, but still good. Next time I would use more cheese and/or sour cream. Very easy and quick to fix! Good starter recipe!

This recipe sounded so good I made this after I got home from work and it's very good, and easy to make.  I don't have a food processor but it was very easy to use a hand grater for the squash.  I plan to make this a favorite for get togethers with friends. The corn bread layer really gives it a flavorful crunch to the ingredients

This was a great recipie! I don't even like squash but I will make it again! The only thing I did differently was I boiled my zuccinni and yellow squash in chicken broth and water with salt and pepper till tender and mashed it up then added it to the recipie because my kids would not eat it if they saw the shredded squash, and it was awesome!

Excellent! My family loved it! I added minced garlic as that's what I had on hand and took the advice of some others, added cheddar cheese to the top. Awesome!

Made this as a side dish for a family meal. It was a hit. Great way to sneak some vegetables in for those who don't readily eat them.

This was a great alternative to other seasonal vegetables.  I wanted to make a casserole instead of a fried squash dish and this was a hit with my family, the meat lovers and the vegetarians in my family.   I've added this recipe to my holiday meals!  It was really good and easy to make.

Not impressed. Did as others suggested and diced the veggies instead of shredding but the veggies weren't done after 40 mins. Needs more cheese and needs to cook longer. Won't make this again.

Good and simple.  I used this recipe because I just needed to know the soup, sour cream, cheese ratio.  I had to use mozzerella to supplement the little bit of cheddar I had.  Very good.  Instead of the Stuffing, I used a whole sleeve of Ritz (soaked in that amount of butter) for the topping.  Yum.

It looked delicious and smelled delicious but all we could taste was the sage in the stuffing!  It might have been good with Ritz crackers instead.  As it is, we couldn't eat it!

everyone who ate this when i made it absolutely loved it!!!! i did add some stuff to the recipe though. i made 1 box of cornbread stuffing, 2 cans of cream of chix soup, 1 can cream of mushroom, 3/4 cup sour cream, 3 squash, 1 zucc, 1/2 cup of onion, and 1 cup cheese. the rest of the measurments were the same. but also instead of shredding the squash and zucc i chopped it up into little squares. sounds like alot but .... delicious!!!

I did not care for this recipe. If I were ever to make this again, I would not use the DRY stuffing on top, I would prepare a stuffing recipe first. Maybe some kind of salt free seasoning might have helped. I also loaded the filling with lots of sauteed onions, still didn't help :P

Veg it Up! To get more veggie power out of this great recipe, I shred the zucchini, chopped red pepper, carrots, onions and sauté all only slightly - and my family has always made it without the cheese - don't miss it at all. Excellent veggie side-dish!

This is a very good squash casserole recipe with one exception - the amount of butter.  After several bites, the butter became a little overwhelming and even made us all feel a little nauseas.  Next time I make it I will add 2 Tbs. of butter to the mixture rather than the 1/4 cup it called for and only use 1 Tbs. over the top of the cracker/cheese mixture.

When I make this dish, I saute the butter with onion, the carrot, squash, zucchini.  Then I add the sourcream and soup and stir well over low heat until combined.  Then I add the stuffing and mix thoroughly. I transfer to a baking dish and bake.  I don't like the cheese on top personally.  I think this is a really good dish, but this recipe doesn't put it together that well.

Changed the recipe a bit for more flavor.I added some buffalo wing flavored sour cream and a Ritz cracker crust and cooked the squash/zucchini before baking it.You have to drain out all the excess water though

Nobody really liked it (me either!)  I made a double batch of this and the pan I used allowed this to be about the same depth of a 9X13.  Maybe I should have baked it longer.  I won't be trying it again.
