I made individual bakes bries.  I bought the already made mini puffed pastry shells (freezer section), put about a Tablespoon of brie in each, then topped with about 1 teaspoon of the onion mixture and one piece of roasted garlic on each,  baked them on a cookie sheet for about 6 minutes at 350.  I bought a jar of the already peeled garlic, tossed them in a little olive oil and a pinch of salt then roasted them in a foil pocket at 400 for 20 minutes

Awesome recipe! I made it for a Christmas Eve dinner and everyone was quite impressed with it, though it was SO easy. I didn't bother with the apples, I didn't want a 'sweet' brie recipe.

Some 'brie-newbies' might wonder about what to do about the rind. All a personal preference thing. I personally think the texture is a little gross, so I don't eat it. Some will argue that the rind is where the best flavor is. What I did was cut the top rind from it and leave the rest, that way I could easily scoop the tasty inner cheese from it.

I made a very similar version of this recipe last night and took it to a ladies get-together. My recipe varied a bit although its hard to go wrong with these ingredients. I cut a 15 oz round of brie in half horizontally, topped with a few tablespoons of apricot preserves, then topped that with carmelized onions mixed with roasted chopped walnuts. Then I added the second half of the brie and used the same toppings (apricot, onion/walnuts). I didn't use as much butter when I carmelized the onions - only about 2 Tbs - and I cooked them very slowly for about 15 minutes before adding a spoonful of sugar and letting them cook covered for 10 more minutes and adding the walnuts. I also used thawed Phyllo dough (4 sheets brushed with butter) to wrap the brie. I served this with sliced baguette bread and crackers, with sliced Asian pears on the side. Yummm.. this was met with rave reviews!!

Made this for a neighborhood picnic yesterday.  Only change was phyllo for puff pastry because I had it on hand.  I got great reviews from all the neighbors!  The appples did not add anything to the flavor, so next time I will just use 2 onions (or more.)  The roasted garlic was a yummy addition, though!  Will make again, VERY easy!

Excellent baked Brie.  The Granny Smith apples give a nice tartness that softens the sweet roasted garlic.  The only changes that I made was that I used shallots instead of onions.  It provides a more delicate flavor that doesn't over-power the apples and garlic.  I also added the roasted garlic with the apple and shallot on top of the Brie instead of as a garnish.  This combination enhances the wonderful flavor of the Brie.  Try it; you won't be disappointed.

I made two different baked brie recipes and found that combining the two resulted in fireworks! I caramelized onions with butter, thyme, white wine and sugar. DELICIOUS! Next, I cut the brie wheel in half length-wise and put the caramelized onions in between. I put the two halves back together and then wrapped in puff pastry. I messed up by not making sure the puff pastry was sealed as the brie leaked out. Pinch those sides tight!

I made this for a party, and first nobody touched it.  Once someone cut into it, it disappeared fast!  The onion/apple combo is awesome.  I served with Wheat Thins.  Excellent!!!

I have made this multiple times now and it is an absolute hit with everyone! No need for any garnish and simplifies the recipe immensely.  Serve with good, whole wheat crackers.  The best!!!

This was OUTSTANDING!!  Made for NYE and it was a big hit!  Omitted the apples (had none!) and had to use crescent roll dough.  But I did cut the brie round in half horizontally and placed the onions and garlic on half, then topped with the other half. Wrapped tightly with the dough and baked for 20 mins.  Perfect!!  A great appy with crackers!  Would have loved to have served it with jalapeno jelly, but didn't have that either!  Thanks for a great post!

This turned out surprisingly delicious.  This was a trial run for Xmas.   I did just minor changes...chopped the onions, omitted the apples and I added garlic to the onions (next time I will decrease the butter...too much, imo).  I also added some salt, pepper, brown sugar and honey to the onion mixture.    I served with sliced apples and crackers.  Everyone loved!  I will be doing a savory one and a sweeter version for Xmas.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!! Didn't have time to add the roasted garlic, but otherwise did the recipe as is.  Fantastic! and oh so easy.  My only recommendation: w/ the puff pastry, while thawing get it unfolded.  If you wait until fully thawed it is too sticky to unfold.  Also, I got the brie wheel from Sams Club so it was double the size, i think just thicker and it worked perfect

The onion-apple combo was not my favorite although I thought it would be great (I love onions).  Still a good recipe though.

I love this recipe; it's fun, easy and delicious! I've made it for several parties and have never had any leftover. After the first couple of times, I decided that a whole onion was too big and have since been making it with a shallot instead. It's a great substitute if you have guests who aren't crazy about onion.  I second the earlier comment about making sure you give the puff pastry enough time to thaw, though; I ripped it while trying to unfold it the first time, and butter oozed out everywhere. But even that was still delicious!

Yum! I didn't have any apples on hand, so I omitted them. The creamy savory brie and the sweet carmelized onions were a perfect complement to each other. I think that the apples would have taken away from the dish by adding too many flavors. I added a pinch of sugar to the onions while they were cooking and cooked them for a good 40 minutes. There is a good article on this site detailing how to caramelize onions. Also added some minced garlic straight to the onions. So delicious!

Followed recipe. While the taste was good, the concept unique among baked bries but we found it to be on the dry side. It presented well. Really seemed to need a complimentary light tasting sauce.

I make this without the puff pastry (put brie in a baking dish and top with the onion/apple mixture) and it goes over very well! I also chop the onions and apples which make it easier to serve and eat. I add just a tablespoon or two of brown sugar to the mixture as well which is a nice addition.

I made this recipe for the first time and followed the directions exactly. I was mildly pleased. If I make again I will chop onions and apples. Slices were to large and overwhelmed everything else. I would only prepare 1/2 an onion and omit the garlic. (atleast in this form) I am a garlic lover but this was way to much.

This is a good recipe. I've made it with and without the puff pastry--delicious either way. (When I didn't have pastry, I scored the top of the brie to allow the toppings to seep into the cheese). I've also added slivered toasted almonds before. Beautiful combination of flavors!

The caramelized onions, baked garlic, baked brie and apple combination was amazing! I didn't have puff pastry, so I hollowed out a loaf of cheese bread and put everything inside: brie cut in half horizontally made the bottom layer, then caramalized onions cooked with tart homemade applesauce (didn't have any tart apples), baked garlic cloves, then covered with the top crust of the bread. Baked about 25 minutes. It was absolutely delicious and got rave reviews.

Great recipe!  The caramelized onion/apple mixture was tasty but I added salt and pepper to make it perfect.  I added the garlic to the onion mixture and use phyllo dough because that was all I had.  Make sure to use a flavorful apple--a tastless apple will add nothing to flavor while a really tasty apple will enhance the flavor.

This recipe was delicious and a very nice presentation. I didn't serve any starch on the side, as the puff pastry is already included. Lovely with a nice white wine.

I didn't bother caramelizing the onions, I just let the apples get very soft.  Also left out the roasted garlic.  This is an AMAZING recipe!!

Oh My.. This is SOOO GOOD! Here is what I did to make it "my own" Roast the garlic and serve NEXT to the brie. I carmalized the onion and apple and once it was done I removed the skillet from the heat and sprinkled with brown sugar.  Just let it sit there and melt in.  I then added some fresh rosemary just a little. place the onion/apple mix in the center of the dough and place the brie ontop of that.  fold and pinch.  I place seam side down and brushed with cream or butter.  bake and let it rest... YUMM7

I bummed this recipe off of a friend who got it from this site.  It is soooo good!  You can't go wrong.  The directions are simple, the ingredients are clear cut.  I made for a Thanksgiving appetizer, at a "gourmet chef's" house, and it was a huge hit!  Thanks!

I'm only giving this four stars because I changed the recipe somewhat, otherwise it'd be five!  The key to the deliciousness was a mushroom brie from Trader Joe's---the flavor fused perfectly with the other ingredients.  Also, I used individual puff pastries to make it easier to serve, left out the apples, and put one clove of roasted garlic inside of each instead of on top.  Amazing!  Can't wait to bring it to a party!

I had something like this at a local cafe and made my own version of it. I carmelized an onion with a handfull of chopped hazelnuts and mixed in a small jar of apricott preserves. I wrapped it in phyllo dough instead of puff pastry and served it with fruit and sliced baguette.

I loved the carmelized filling and the garlic technique.  This dish has a neutral flavor. (Although I did find it to be on the greasier side.) It is easy to do. I might add another apple next time.

I made this tonight, AMAZING! The apples with the onion are a great contrast to the cheese. The roasted garlic really isn't necessary as the onion adds more than enough flavor.

Wow!  It was a huge hit!  I cut into it so no one would have to be the first to cut it, and it was gone in a flash!  I used Pillsbury crescent rolls (now they have solid sheets, so you don't have to shmoosh the triangles together), and used egg white to glue the top and bottom together.

I was very surprised by how yummy this was.  I put minced garlic in with the onions instead of having garlic on top.  A big hit with the crowd.

I made this recently and it was delicious. I didn't have a granny Smith so I used a Fuji instead I also used a Pillsbury pie dough. Using the pie dough required a little longer cook time. I admit that this needs a little something salty so next time I may add bacon.

I cut the cheese wheel in half and put the mixture in the middle before wrapping it up. I added a little brown sugar in the onion mixture and used granny smith apples. I used an egg wash on the outside and inside to hold it together instead of butter. Took a little longer than 20 minutes to be melty enough.

Fantastic! Made for a party and it was devoured. I used a full wheel of Brie and skipped the puffed pastry. I also omitted the roasted garlic. The carmelized onions and apples are amazing. I served with praline pecans and fig spread.

I did this recipe. I didn't have enough garlic so I added my garlic to my caramelized Onion/Apple. What a success. When I got it out of the oven, I noticed the cheese wasn't completely melted. Well that was even better! Easier to slice, easier to eat. My friends were very pleased by it. 

I recommend this recipe!

I made this as an appetizer for a party we attended. It was a huge hit & I will be making it again for a dinner party next week.I used a Mandolin with medium blade to slice both my onion and apple. Caramelizing the combo seemed to take longer than I anticipated but once they did begin to brown it caramelized quickly. In addition to the garnish of roasted garlic cloves I also added, based upon another review, pralined pecans. Served with sliced French baguette. This recipe is a definite keeper!

Taste great and quick and easy.  I wrapped the cheese with smoked turkey meat and used gala apples. I will defiantly make this over and over. I might reserve some butter to put on the top after it browns next time.
