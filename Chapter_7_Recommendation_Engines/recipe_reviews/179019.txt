Absolutely delicious! However, to make a healthier version without the MSG, add a cup or so of roux thinned with milk instead of the soup. Delicious and nutritious :)

Good for a quick Cambell's based meal.  A little bland, but not bad.  It did taste like it was missing something, but not quite sure what.  I Did add some baby spinach that I had left over in the fridge but I don't think it added or detracted from the dish.

Very yummy recipe!  My boyfried isn't much of a shrimp fan, but he really enjoyed this meal.  Quick and easy too.

Not too shabby!! My hubby made this because it was so easy, and it was quick and tasty as well. I probably wouldn't make it for company but it's great for week nights after work.

Was a little bland - added fresh 1 tablespoon fresh dill weed, 1/2 tsp italian seasoning, and changed lemon juice to 2 tablespoons, this made a world of difference.  The dill weed with the extra lemon juice gave it more flavor.  Will definitely make this again!!!

This recipe is very healthy, but very bland. We tried adding extra lemon juice, salt, seasonings, and it didn't seem to fix it. I do appreciate how healthy it was, but it is definitely lacking something.

Very easy to make. I used tofu instead of shrimp, stir-fried it with the broccoli. I forgot the rice, but it made plenty for two people without it, like a creamy tofu soup with broccoli. The tofu soaked up the lemon and mushroom flavor very nicely (had to use Cream of Mushroom), and I would definitely make it again - it only took 10 minutes!

I read the previous reviews and so i decided to change a few things up. I minced up 3 garlic cloves and cooked with the broccoli, and added extra garlic powder. I didnt have a can of cream of broccoli soup so i went online and made some as i had so much broccoli i could use, it turned out good. during the last part of cooking i added Dill, italian seasoning, and a small amount of chili flakes oh, and i put extra lemon juice in it as well. I had no problem with it being bland. even my picky 2 yr old liked the sauce (tho he dont like shrimp). Thanks for sharing!

A tad bland. I ended up having to use cream of mushroom. Didn't have much flavor though. I added cheese to the brocilli to give it a little bit more flavor.

Instead of pepper I added old bay and what a world of difference that made. Lots of flavor!!

definitely great for a quick meal. 
-I used garlic salt instead of powder and instead of cooking the shrimp with the soup  I cooked it the same way as you would the broccoli about 2 or 3 minutes in each side.

This was pretty good and super simple. I waited until 9pm to start dinner so I needed something easy and quick. I didn't have cream of broccoli soup so I used cream of celery and used chicken broth instead of plain water. Not something I would make on a regular basis but great in a pinch for time.

Awesome!!!!  A very simple recipe to have posted on the frig! Since I'm Southern and live not far from Charleston, South Carolina, I had to serve it over white rice. Yummy!
