Delicious! I varied the recipe slightly - used left over roast ham, added freshly ground salt & black pepper between layers and added a glug of double cream to the milk, and finished by topping with red cheddar and Parmesan cheese! Cooked in a lidded casserole dish in oven 180*c 1hr 30 and removed lid to brown top 10mins. Husband and children Loved this - thankyou for this recipe!

I prepare this recipe as written, but I cook it in my rice cooker.  Easy, scrumptiously delicious, clean-up mess free, and can be set to be ready when you are if you have a preset option on your rice cooker.  My new go-to recipe for comfort food.  Thanks for sharing.  Works well with Polish sausage, ham or brats as well.
