The peppermint extract will cause the white chocolate to seize up - you need to use oil-based flavors especially for candy-makers. I read on another site that this needs to be made with good quality chocolate for the layers to adhere. I used a combination of Nestle's chips and a store brand (make sure it contains cocoa butter) and had no problems. Save some of the candy cane bits to sprinkle in top for color. You need to press them in. Very tasty, will make again.

A nice easy recipe that has lots of flavor.  I messed up a bit and used semi-sweet chocolate as it came in mint flavor.  I think it would better with the milk chocolate.  I used small candy canes which were a pain to unwrap, but I think when crushed they looked a bit more colorful than the big canes would.

Good ratios of ingredients. I used Ghirardelli milk and white choc chips, and it tastes almost identical to their peppermint bark squares (which I tasted at Disney and couldn't afford!)  Thanks for posting!

Great recipe! There weren't any regular candy canes at the store so I got a bunch of small ones, and it turned out very nicely! The only thing I'd change is the part where you put the white on the milk chocolate. If you let it set fully, the layers will break apart when making pieces. If you put the second layer on while the milk chocolate is still mostly liquid, they will set together.

I followed the recipe and melted the chocolate, it was perfect. I used Milk Chocolate Chipits. When I added the extract (Club House Pure Mint & Peppermint Extract), the chocolate clumped right up and I couldn't save it. I don't know what happened.

I made this at Christmas time and totally forgot to rate it. I normally do some sort of peppermint bark at Christmas and decided this year to do it this way. It was easy, set up great. It looked so pretty when I had all the pieces chucked and in little pretty gift bags. This recipe is soo easy. And it's totally hard to make a flop with this, unless you dropped it on the floor in the making process. LOL. But do give this easy, tasty and simple recipe a try.

I've made this four times this week and taken it to work only to come home with an empty tin . I didnt have a problem with the two layers sticking together when I broke it like some did . I did use ghardelli chocolate but be wear the white chocolate chip bag is only 11 ounces . I'll be making plenty more of this for every ocassion !! Update I sent this back home for a friends Christmas Party and they said its even better then the Gharadelli Peppermint Bark you can buy !! I'll be making another three pans when I get home for our Christmas potluck at work :) PS I had no problems with the layers staying together when I broke the bark and I didnt add peppermint to the white chocolate but to the milk chocolate as per the instructions .. LOVE LOVE LOVE !!!!

I made this with 1 bag of milk chocolate chips and a bag of andes mint chocolate chips for the bottom layer and for the top layer used 1 bag of white chocolate chips and a bag of andes mint peppermint chips. The top layer ended up being pink and it cooled really fast so I had to keep reheating it becasue I poured it into moulds. I used a small sauce pan to boil water and put a medium/large ceramic bowl over it to melt the chocolate in, it worked better than the microwave melting and the chocolate never got scalding hot so it cooled really quickly.  It was so minty that it didn't really even need the 36 smashed up mini candy canes, but it is awesome. Everyone is eating it!!!!

I made three batches of this to put in my Christmas cookie gift boxes.  *Everyone* raved about it.  I used Ghiradelli milk chocolate and Hershey's white chocolate.  Mine did not split between layers as some have described.  I cooled the layers completely at 50 degrees (my semi-heated garage - outside was MN winter).  This is so easy and quick, and popular! I am making this every year.

I tried this recipe, and I loved it!!! I accidentally bought semi-sweet chocolate chips, but they were still delicious! A tip for those who want it: when you're ready to break up your peppermint bark, put it in the freezer for 1-2 hours, then turn over your whole pan of bark do that it the bark is upside down and out of the pan. Take a butter knife and hit your peppermint bark with the handle end of the knife- it breaks so easily! Happy baking!

This was the best and most easy recipe in all the Bark Recipes. I love that you can use the microwave to melt.  The other Bark recipes felt complicated and too specific. I needed something simple for a group of high school girls to complete to bring to a school event.  Anything more complicated could have turned the kitchen into a nightmare.  Love this. And it tasted fantastic!

ABSOLUTE hit with our family and friends. I used Ghirardelli chocolates and 1t mint extract, only because I couldn't find peppermint. 1st batch came out great! No separation at all.  I will press the candycane topping down slightly next time.  I only have 3 more batches to go...these will be treats for our neighbors, co-workers and friends.

Melted milk choc in double boiler, didn't add peppermint extract as I'm not sure that mine is oil based and didn't want the chocolate to seize. So I put the candy canes in my Magic Bullet which chopped to various sizes. I put the chopped canes through a sieve, and sprinkled a layer of candy cane dust on the melted milk chocolate and mixed some candy cane slivers and dust into the white chocolate. I didn't allow the milk to set completely before spreading the white on top. Then I sprinkled the larger candy cane pieces on top of the white and set the pan outside to cool (Canadian winter here). Since I was putting it outside to set/chill I put a piece of parchment over top and accidentally pressed the cane into the chocolate a little bit too much. The parchment stuck but peeled away easily when the bark had chilled. I was a little disappointed that pressing the cane down into the chocolate wrecked the appearance of the bark but once it's broken into pieces it doesn't look that bad and it stays on the bark. Everyone loved it but I didn't make enough! Will definitely make 2 or 3 batches next time!

So mine was a spectacular fail. Lessons learned: let the chocolate layer set the full 30 minutes.  If it is not completely set by the time you pour on the white, it mixes and looks gray/brown. Use a higher quality white chocolate than the Toll House premier white. It does not melt well at all. It's very clumpy. So, mine looked like clumpy brown/gray mess. Still tasted great!  Also, buy the larger candy canes instead of the minis. It's a lot of unwrapping!

This is one of the only sweet treats I have made in several years and I didn't screw it up!  Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips, generic white chocolate chips, and generic extract.  Didn't separate like some said theirs did.  I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan. Thanks for the easy recipe!

started the white chocolate melting in microwave at 1/2 of full power for one minute, when this didn't have much results I movedit up to full power, but it started to burn at 40 seconds so I moved it back down to 1/2 power but by then it just wanted to clump up and turn brown, a total disaster!

It is wonderful.  I didn't change a thing.  I am fortunate enough to live where it is cold so I let it sit outside on the car to chill between adding layers.  I served it and had to write down the recipe immediately.

These were delicious and so pretty. Make sure to use PURE peppermint oil. Oil will mix with the chocolate, while any water based favoring will cause the chocolate to  clump and will render it unusable. Do not skip the peppermint extract though. The one time that I forgot to add it, the white chocolate would not stick to the milk chocolate, and when I broke it up, the layers came apart.  Enjoy this easy to make treat!

This is a keeper. First time I made it (and every time), it turned out great. Never had a problem with any separation of the chocolates. I had 3 friends ask for the recipe when i took it to a party. Easy to make and tasty! Chilled it outside since the weather was cold. I used red and green candy canes for more color and placed the candy in clear bags for gifts.

The flavor was good, but the white chocolate and the mile chocolate didn't stick together, and when we broke it to pieces quite a bit of it fell apart.

I made this for the first time yesterday.  The only thing I changed was that I chopped  the peppermint in my blender to make it fine.  I used Watkins  pure peppermint extract and really had only a few pieces separate as I was breaking it into pieces with a knife.

I made it and used a bit too much white chocolate, & couldn’t find regular candy canes, so I used mint chocolate candy canes. Was still really good and people liked it, but will definitely look harder for regular candy canes next time!

Great recipe and easy to make.  My wife is not a big fan of white chocolate so for the top I used half white and a mix of milk and dark chocolate. The top wasn't white but everyone thought it was crazy good.

I followed the directions closely. I began trying to break the bark, but it separated between layers. I put it back in the fridge for a couple of hours and it worked MUCH better! I highly recommend leaving it in the fridge for a few hours before breaking it up. It worked like a charm for me. Meanwhile, the flavor was delicious! Thanks for a great recipe that was easy enough for the kids to help.

My daughter needed a last minute treat for school and asked for peppermint bark.  Mine separated like some of the other comments, but since many of her friends wont' eat the white chocolate, that actually works out OK for us. Didn't have peppermint extract, but added some of the crushed candy canes and some crushed chocolate wafer cookies to the bottom layer.  Came out delicious and plenty minty.

Very good. We prefer a darker chocolate, so we used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate.

Tasted amazing, but man there's a LOT of it! Seriously, it filled a gallon sized Ziploc bag and it's nearly half an inch thick. I put the first layer in the fridge for 10 minutes instead of 30 so the layers wouldn't break apart later.

You need to use a pan that's larger than written or it comes out really thick. I had to get out the meat hammer to break it apart. Lost a few pieces to the floor. But it tastes fantastic!

Per other reviews, I skipped the peppermint extract as the one I had was not oil-based. It was still delicious and the peppermint candies added plenty of minty goodness. When I went to break the bark I encountered the splitting issue with the two colors of chocolate splitting apart. I saw a review saying to freeze the bark for an hour or two and then break apart, so I threw the pan in the freezer and came back about 2 hours later. It broke apart perfectly - great recommendation! My coworkers loved the bark, as did I.

Awesome recipe!  I've made this for several years now and it always turns out great.  I use Ghiradelli chocolate and Peppermint oil for baking (purchased on-line).  I don't let the first layer set up completely before I add the 2nd layer - otherwise follow the recipe to a T and it's better than any peppermint bark you can buy!

The flavour is definitely there. I followed the amount of the recipe to the letter and this was a thick (too thick) amount of chocolate. It too separated in a few places. I melted the chocolate in a glass bowl overtop a shallow pan of boiling water as the author's melting instructions seemed dangerous to myself and the chocolate. I would try another recipe in the future.

Fast, simple and extremely easy. I used dark chocolate instead of milk and didn't wait for it to set in the fridge before pouring the white chocolate over it.

How do you keep the white chocolate from melting the dark, turning it a weird pinkish-brown?  It still tastes amazing - I've made it the last two holiday seasons and everyone's loved it.

Simple recipe, easy to make. I skipped the peppermint extract - it still tasted fine but was a little less minty, of course. I'd recommend pressing down on the candy cane pieces you sprinkle on top; when I broke mine apart, most of the pieces fell off.

I love peppermint bark, but every time we buy some we run out right away so this is great! The one we buy has a white chocolate base.. It was really yummy. I think I might want to do half white and half milk when i make this. This looks delicious!:)
