Great wrap! I used a whole grain flour tortilla and roasted garlic hummus made from scratch, but other than that I stuck with the recipe. This is excellent as is but can be changed up based on what is in your fridge.  Next time I may try feta or parmesan.  romaine lettuce would be good also if you don't have spinach, but if you have fresh spinach definitely use it as it is so good for you.  thanks for sharing, these will be great for my lunches!

Very tasty and a great, easy lunch. I didn't have any hummus so I used a wedge of Laughing Cow light garlic and herb.  Since I used that, I left out the mozzarella.  I plan to make it again with the hummus and mozzarella next time.  Definitely lends itself to using whatever you have on hand.

This was great for a nice, light lunch! I used a reg. flour tortilla b/c that's what I had on hand and reg. mozz. b/c I don't care for the FF. Also, I didn't measure anything, just did it all to taste. Great flavor and I actually felt good eating it! The beauty of this wrap is that you can add/subract things according to your personal preference, and even change up the hummus flavors (I used roasted red pepper flavor). I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe is such a pleasant surprise. It's flexible and versatile yet simple and fantastic. Both times I've made my own hummus, once the classic chickpea, but this most recent time I was using red kidney bean hummus. Still a fantastic wrap. I've also played around with the cheeses, using fresh Parmesan in my wraps to save on calories, recently using colby jack because that's what I had in the house, I've done with white and sun-dried tomato flour tortillas as well as wheat tortillas. My teenager, who swears she doesn't like raw spinach, hummus or artichokes (or any of the ingredients except the tortillas ha!) has always enjoyed this wrap. I give her a whole one in her lunch, or half of one as an after school snack. This more recent batch, I was doing off the top of my head, using a sprinkle of cheese. In looking at the recipe (to write this review) I definitely didn't use 1/4 cup of cheese per wrap like I did the first time I made this and YES, still a fantastic wrap.

Great lunch recipe! Quick easy a little bland but tasty. I have food allergies so I used homemade humus and flour tortillas. Easy adaptable to what is on hand. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great combination of flavors. I normally don't like wraps but all of the ingredients in this wrap made it delicious. It's very easy to whip together.
