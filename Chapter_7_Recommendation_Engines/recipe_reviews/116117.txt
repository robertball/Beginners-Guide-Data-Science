Great recipe, 'as is,' no changes. I only want to add a note of information. If you're using the Honey Maid graham crackers that come in a box with three packets, one packet yields exactly 1 1/4 cups of crumbs. Should you not want to open another packet to make up the 1/4 cup difference, just use one less tablespoon of butter. The amount of sugar can be adjusted according to your taste and sweetness of the filling. Whether it fits in your pan depends on which you're using - deep, shallow, glass, non-stick or aluminum. Loved the crust -- simple, quick and delicious. Why buy one? Thanks! :)

This crust was absolutely perfect. It came out just how I wanted it to! I used it for a chocolate raspberry cheesecake and I loved it. 

 I put the graham crackers in a baggie and mashed them in there, using a measuring cup to scoop out the needed amounts. I also added a little more butter than was called for. The crust is a little hard to get on the sides of the pie plate (at least I thought so). I found that pressing it in with my palms was the best method. 

Also, I opted to chill the crust, rather than bake it, as it was going to be baked later. It turned out wonderful and delicious! This will probably be my crust for all cheesecakes and cream pies.

Great recipe. The crust was wonderful however I wouldn't make this for a pie that requires a long cooking time (over 40 minutes) The graham begins to burn.

If you have a coffee grinder clean it out and use it to grind the graham crackers.  About 1/2 a graham cracker at a time will give you wonderful crumbs.

I like this recipe for graham cracker crust because it calls for less butter and less sugar than others.  Too much butter and you may end up with pie that is not only difficult to get out of the pan and has a tendency to want to STAY there,  but also a crust that's too firm.  As for the sugar, you've got graham crackers which are already sweet, so not  a whole lot more sugar is required.  I baked mine, because I prefer the "toastiness" taste of the baked crust.  Seven minutes was more than enough - 8-10 minutes and I might have had a too dark crust.  There is more than enough for a 9" crust, so I saved some of the crumbs to sprinkle over the top of  the lemon icebox pie I used this crust for.  Good, reliable reference recipe.

This turned out perfect.  I was looking for one I didn't have to bake.  This is definately it.  I used my blender to make the crumbs.

Worked like a charm!  Very easy to make.  I just put some graham crackers in the food processor and then followed the directions.  Very good!

Excellent, simple, basic graham cracker crust. I used this for the Toll House Pie I recipe here and it was perfect. I didn't prebake as my pie had to bake anyway. So I just popped it in the fridge for 30 min before filling. OH! Fabulous!

Very easy recipe and very good! Another viewer said to use a coffee grinder, but I think that's more work and cleanup.  Just put the graham crackers in a food/freezer baggie and pound them down (I used a flat sided metal mallet. It's also a good way to release any anxieties! lol) and then add the sugar and melted butter to it and mix it in the bag. Transfer to the pie plate and press onto the bottom.

I have always stayed away from graham cracker crusts because mine are always soggy. This is the perfect ratio of butter to crumbs. It turned out ! One package of Honey Maid crackers plus two more whole rectangles makes 1 1/2 cups of crumbs if you are making your own.

This crust came out perfect.  I was using it for a pumpkin cheesecake for Thanksgiving, so the only thing I added was about 1/2 t of pumpkin pie spice.  It was absolutely wonderful.

Great go-to recipe.  thanks!  Just a suggestion to try: I mixed all ingredients together then refrigerated for about 20 minutes, and that made it easier to handle the crust and keep it "up" along the sides neatly

Super easy and tasty. I think it calls for too many graham crackers for one 9" pie crust, but if you like your crust to be thick, it's fine. I will hold off on some of the crumbs next time to have a slightly thinner crust. I'll never buy a premade crust with all of those illegible ingredients when it's so much easier and healthier to make my own!

This recipe is great! I have used it for both a key lime pie and a lemon icebox pie and it was awesome with both. I appreciate having an easy, go-to recipe for crust since I don't like to use store bought graham cracker crusts! I baked it for seven minutes and it was perfect. NOTE: this recipe is exactly like the one used by Emeril Lagasse for his "Creamy Lemon Icebox Pie" except that he uses 1/2 cup of sugar. Not sure if this helps anyone, but 1/3 cup is basically 5 Tablespoons of butter. Just use the measurements on the stick of butter and then you don't have to wash a measuring cup!

Great tasting, but this makes a ton!  It could probably fill 2 Pyrex pie pans.  Next time, I will cut the recipe by at least a third.

The proportions are wrong! They are so far off I can't give this more than 3 stars. I love to make homemade graham cracker crusts, but lost the recipe I had. It's easy with only 3 ingredients. If pressed thin enough this is plenty for a 9 inch pie crust. To make it good you will either have to reduce the butter to 1/4 cup or add 3 extra sheets of graham crackers. There is way too much butter to graham crackers. The sugar is really a personal preference. If you find it too sweet just reduce the sugar. I also find that if I use actual butter it's really hard to cut. I tend to go for tub margarine. It sets up, but isn't hard when chilled. Also a personal preference.

No changes needed this was perfect, I will never buy the pre-made one from the store.  I stuck it in the fridge to stiffen before filling instead of the oven.  Worked out great.

Very Sweet- I used this crust for a key lime pie and it countered the tartness nicely, but for a sweet pie, I'd recommend less sugar.  Measurement wise- one sleeve of graham crackers is perfect.

I thought it was a little too sweet and a little crumbly. I would add less sugar and more butter. I used one package of hytop graham crackers.

Tasted good, but it didn't stick together very well. It also called for too many graham cracker crumbs. I'm wondering if next time I should try brown sugar to help it stick together and pack better?

This recipe is very good! Unless you like the crust really thick, there will be some left over.. The second time I did this, I decided to only do a cup of crushed graham cracker and accidently added the same amount of everything else, but it was still very good! I made it with the double layer pumpkin cheesecake recipe on this site.. Delicious!

Is there a rule of thumb for when you should or should not bake it?  I made this to fill with the Peanut Butter Pie 2000 from this site (frozen pie) and the crust stuck to the bottom (I did not bake it.)  Fine for me and my husband since we don't care how it looks, only how it tastes!  UPDATE: Bake it if planning on making a frozen pie.

I decided to use this recipe for a first time Key Lome Pie Fudge with the Never Ever Fail Fudge recipe.  It worked like a charm.  It is perfect and delicious!

The store bought crusts always taste stale to me so I try to make my own.  This recipe is the perfect amount of sugar and butter which results in a light crust that isn't too dense to cut through.  I always bake mine because I like the flavor.  Thanks for this easy recipe!

Delicious! I used this recipe for cheesecake bars in an 8x8 pan. I chose to refrigerate the dough for 30 min and it worked like a charm. I greased the pan with lots of butter and flower. The result was an absolutely scrumptious and crispy crust that didn't stick to the pan. (FYI baked the cheesecake for about 22 minutes at 350.. any more time and the crust would've started burning)

This was a very easy crust to make, my family loved it. I used it for an unbaked pie, which was quite heavy and dense, it just barely held together with the thin sides ~ so next time I will add a quarter to the recipe and build up the sides of the pan a little thicker. The taste was GREAT!!!!

Oh, delicious!  I substituted brown sugar for white, and one package of Honey Maid honey graham crackers turned out to be just over 1 1/2 cups.  I chilled it while the banana pudding set, and I had made a fruit compote of chopped bananas, brown sugar, cinamon, and vanilla.  Banana compote, then pudding, then more graham cracker crumbs on top, and behold!  The easiest and tastiest banana cream pie!  To make the crumbs, I put the crackers into a large ziplok bag, bashed them a bit with my palm, then used a rolling pin on the bag.  Fast and easy.  I'm making this crust every time I make pudding from now on!

Love this recipe.  Just like my grandma's crust but she made hers thicker.  It a great, basic recipe you can add anything else as a variation like chopped peanuts, walnuts, etc. into the crust.

Nice and easy to make. I used Ginger Snap crumbs instead of graham cracker crumbs. Made the crumbs by whirling the good, old fashioned, crispy, boxed ginger snaps in the food processor. Five stars

Recipe is perfect as is!  I lazily didn't measure, but used 1 pkg. + 1 whole cracker & had plenty for my 9" pie plate (probably would've fit a 10" plate).  Baked for 8 mins.

Incredibly easy, and versatile.  I used gingersnap cookies instead of graham crackers and it turned out well.  I think I used too much butter, though, so don't use a heavy hand with that--I added more crumbs just to help it out.  All in all, worth it for a quick graham cracker pie crust.  I used it for a pudding cheesecake filling.  Thanks for the recipe.

The proportions in this recpe are just right. I made this with crushed chocolate teddy grahams for a peanut butter pie. The combination was spot on. Note, I placed the crackers in between parchment and crushed coarsely with a rolling pin, then finished them off in the blender

If you add more butter, it makes more of a cookie crust, if you add lest, the crust is lighter and better for berry pies. Works perfectly as a dairy-free options with vegan margarine.

This came out fairly crumbly for me. It didn't stay together very well when I served the pie. It tasted good, though.

I thought that taste was good but this made way too much for my 9 inch pie pan. I ended up throwing about 1/3 of it away (and the crust I used was thicker than I would have liked it - I just couldn't stand wasting more). I pack the crust down with the bottom of a juice glass to keep it from crumbling when I take slices out.

Great taste. There was plenty of crust too so it was easy to work with. This crumbled some when I was trying to remove a piece of pie but I think maybe I should have patted it down a bit firmer? So much better than store bought ready made crusts that it is worth the time to make this. Great recipe. Thanks!

Pretty good crust.  Used it in making Key Lime Pie VII.  Would like to make it next time using less sugar as the whole pie turned out pretty rich.

I was looking for a tasty crust for the Easy Sour Cream Cheesecake also on this site and this one fit the bill.  I did add more butter as the amount here was not enough to moisten the crumbs. I opted for the cinnamon grahams so I had to cut the sugar down quite a bit. It came out plenty sweet.  The crust was very tasty and sure beats the store-bought ones.

I used the graham cracker crumbs by honey maid that are already made...it was very gummy, sweet and very hard to cut because it came out hard...would not make again. I used 1 1/4 cups of the crumbs.

Amazingly simple.  Why buy a crust for around $3 when you can make this in about five minutes. Especially when it's just as good, if not better, than anythign from the shelf.

Could be my mistake, but I wasn't watching my measurements very closely and this ended up coming out very dry. If you are going to err on one side, I'd add some extra butter.

My mother made ice-cream pie every year for Christmas Eve... using this recipe for the crust -- save some of the crumbs for the pie topping. Once it is baked and/or cool, fill 1/2 of the crust with vanilla ice cream and let that chill. Then fill the rest of the crust with lime serbert and sprinkle the rest of the graham cracker crumbs on top of the pie. Chill -- it can stay in the freezer for several days, if it lasts that long. It was a family favorite tradition, but soon became an Easter and birthday tradition, too.

I baked this crust in a cheesecake and it turned out almost caramelly.  It's my new go-to.

This one tastes like heaven, but I'm sure I did something wrong while putting the paste into the pie plate because it crumbled all over, still it's great with coconut cream pie =)

This is a really great crust. The reason I'm giving it a four instead of a five is because when I baked it (to use for my coconut cream pie) it got puffy. I don't know if it was supposed to look that way, but I ended up putting it the fridge so that the crust could 'deflate'. It wasn't enough to cover my 8.5" diameter pie plate, but I could have always made another batch. At least the crust came out DELICIOUS.

This is a great, fool-proof recipe. Tossed the graham crackers into a blender to grind them. Mixed the ingredients directly in the pie pan. Mixed the butter in with my hands and pressed it in. I used this for a key lime pie and it holds up very nicely!

I made these with keebler graham crackers. 1 bag made exactly 1 1/2 cups crumbs. It was a little too sweet to my liking. I'll probably not add the sugar next time. It also was really hard to cut in the end.

This was definitely a good crust but you should definitely put the graham crackers through a food processor or blender and put some more butter in it. The crust was a little dry.

I live in Britain and "graham crackers" don't exist here, so instead I used crushed digestive biscuits for this recipe and it turned out wonderful!!!!! It was such a hit with the pumpkin cheesecake I made. Yummy!

Excellent recipe.  I sometimes add a little extra butter if the crackers are brand new or I leave in in the fridge longer before I fill it.
