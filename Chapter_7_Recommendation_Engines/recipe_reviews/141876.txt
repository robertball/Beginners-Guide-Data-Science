Very good. I used about half the vegetable oil and used jarred minced garlic instead of garlic powder and used about twice the amount.  I pounded the chicken down to 1/2 inch thick and let it marinate all day.  The molasses gave it a nice color and just enough sweetness.

I halved the recipe and marinated 5 large chicken breast to grill.  I didn't have lemon pepper seasoning so I used the juice of half a lemon and ground pepper.  Moist chicken!

This was easy and amazing!!!  I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder and apple cider vinegar instead of distilled white. My lemon seasoning was "Weber" grill seasoning.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as described.  Believe me when I tell you that the 8-hour marinading made the chicken breast so moist, tasty and tender.  My husband and I couldn't pick out any overpowering taste because it all blended together,  My nie-year old (who is quite picky about spicy foods) just gobbled it up!!!

loved, loved this marinade, one of the very best I have ever tried. I  did however alter it just a little. I used only fresh garlic (3 cloves) I am a true garlic freak. I used a tablespoon of onion powder and I used Apple Cider vinegar, definately made a difference. I also added 1 cup plus (taste test along the way) of brown sugar. My husband flipped over this recipe.  Good job Misti...

Great. I used it for baked chicken wings- only marinaded for an hour or so and used lite syrup instead of molasses but the flavor was still amazing! Will definitely use again.

Loved loved loved this marinade. My son, who hates molasses, ate everything. Kept going back to the fridge and ate all the leftovers. I think this would work well with pork chops. Have to try that next time. Only change I made was to cut back on the oil by half.

This marinade is delicious!  I let my chicken soak for 7 hours before grilling  it, and my dinner guests and husband raved about it!  I will use this marinade again.

I cut up some chicken into strips and marinated them for about 4 hours.  Then I stir fried them and used them in a chicken salad with oven french fries, cheese and salad fixings.  It was very tasty and I will definitely use this recipe again!!

I marinated the chicken for 24 hour, and the chicken turned out moist and tender, but it lacked flavor. I was expecting more. Probably wonâ€™t make again.

On the one hand, this marinade helped to keep the chicken very moist, even though I cooked it in the pan, which usually dries it out. But the flavor was very bland.

Great flavor.   I only was able to marinate them for about 2 hours and they still had pretty good flavor.  I used fresh garlic and white wine vinegar based on what I had on hand.  I will definitely try marinating them for 8 hours next time to get the full effect!  This may become a staple recipe for grilled chicken!

I too found this recipe as written quite bland.  I added worcestershire sauce, some seasoning salt, fresh garlic as well as the powder, & a bit more molasses.  MUCH more flavourful.

This marinade was a big hit with my picky eater!  She even mentioned at breakfast how good the chicken was from the night before!  I scaled down the recipe and used it on chicken tenders and they cooked up in a flash.  This will definitely be on my "go to" list.

Excellent, Made kabobs W/ a red pepper & onion. Then grilled.Of course make sure you marinade long enough, so that the chicken will be tender, at least 7 hours. Will make again.

LOVE this recipe. I used hibachi seasoning instead of the lemon seasoning and didn't use quite as much oil. I like this so much that I now make it and put it in a jar in the refrigerator so that I have it whenever I need it.

this was absolutely delicious with a few modifications to suit our tastes.. i reduced the oil to 2 T and the vinegar to 1/2 cup.. left out the molasses as we don't like sweet.. increased the soy to 3 T bc i was worried about other reviewers saying it was bland.. but then i realized how salty my lemon pepper was so i reduced the lemon pepper to 1 T.. i added the zest of half a lemon to compensate.. subbed 2 fresh garlic cloves for the garlic powder and left the onion powder the same.. used the marinade on 3 chicken quarters that we grilled.. saved the marinade, boiled it, and used it to baste.. i can't wait to make this again.. ty so much for the recipe

Misti's Chicken Marinade Haiku: "Why'd it taste so 'meh?' I expected more of this. Followed recipe." I scaled the ratio of ingredients (which I was faithful to) significantly for a single breast that I grilled for myself, which I let marinate for the recommendeed 8 hrs., yet upon serving it (over a salad, which I'm glad that I did), the taste just wasn't there. The chicken itself was moist, but the flavor in the marinade didn't come through strongly enough.

The chicken was super moist with great flavor.  I did not have lemon pepper so I substituted Mrs. Dash Chicken grilling blends for the lemon pepper.  After reading reviews I decided to also add 1/4 cup of pure maple syrup to the marinade mixture and let it marinade for a few hours.  My husband loved it as did I.

It isn't the best marinade but it is good, but to those people who said it was to bland like roybird, probably didn't whisk it well enough which is a very labor intensive thing to do, i finally gave up doing it manually when my arm was getting tired. I din't want all the vegatable oil it takes to make this recipe go to waste so i used a whisk attachment on an egg beater  and even that took a while to get all of the seasoning mixed in with evrything. It still had a better taste to it rather than a store bought marinade. It's probably better than what i tasted anyways because i din't have molasses and i dint have any great substitute for molasses like honey and syrup, so i just used boiled sugar water instead.

Delicious! I let my husband taste the chicken before dinner and he could not wait for dinner! 

At dinner, my 17 and 16 year old were impressed, as well. 

Excellent marinade recipe. I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again.

This marinade was great. My husband and kids loved the flavor. I cut the chicken breasts down the center because we like thinner pieces. I only marinaded the chicken for about 30 minutes and cooked it in a frying pan with a little of the juices. Turned out really well and gave the chicken a nice brownish hue. Would be great the next day in a chicken salad or quesadialla.

This was extremely tasty! What I did was cut up chicken breast and soaked it in the marinade for about 6 hours...I used white wine vinegar as a replacement and threw in some lemon juice along with original ingredients.. To cook I heated a skillet and boiled the meat in all the liquid and then used left-over marinade to pour on rice. A FAVORITE!

Very tasty! Unfortunately we only had an hour to marinade but it still left a great flavor on the bbq'd chicken. I used bonesless skinless thighs. Careful to watch on the bbq seeing as how much oil is used. Thanks!
