This is totally delicious.  More of a custard than pudding.  So easy to make with so few ingredients. Highly recommend this recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

To the person who said this was a custard and not a pudding, you are wrong, it's not a custard. Look up what a pudding and custard is. Also "tembleque" does not mean earthquake, that would be "templor de tierra". A "tembleque" is a wiggle, a jiggle or a shake. It's a verb that describes a "wiggly" movement.
 -From a Puerto Rican, living in PR.

I made this with a slight Indian twist and my family LOVED it. 
 In fact they said it was better than coconut ice cream!  
I added 2 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp rose water, and a pinch of ground cardamom to the coconut milk mixture. 
For the topping, in addition to ground cinnamon I added toasted crushed pistachios.

I'm not sure how this is supposed to taste... This was my first time, but it came out pretty swell. Not to sweet, not too light. It reminded me of a pudding.

While it tasted good, I didn't really enjoy it though because I'm depressed. In a way, everything tastes bland now. But thanks for the person who shared this recipe.

Fantastic, easy and vegan. I served it with small cubes of mango, pineapple and banana and I couldn't get enough! I used one big bowl as the mold and everyone enjoyed it, including company. I'll definitely be making this again!!

This is such a fantastic desert!  I had not eaten tembleque since I was a child, and this desert took me right to my childhood summers in Puerto Rico.  I was concerned while making it, because my mixture didn't seem to be thickening up; I have an electric stove and had the burner set to medium. It took me about ten minutes to get the mixture to thicken, but once it did, there was no question that it was ready.  I followed all of the measurements exactly. The hardest part of this recipe is waiting for it to form up before eating! :D

Made a double batch of this. Added 1 tsp of almond extract. Covered in in Hersey chocolate syrup(instead of cinnamon) and left shredded coconut on the side( let people add that if they want). Almond Joy pudding!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect! If you've never eaten tembleque before, you might find the texture takes some getting used to, but the flavor is incredible. Can't wait to make this delicious, inexpensive dessert again!

Delicious! I made it  with raspberries instead of cinnamon in cupcake tins and they looked really cute! More of an eggless flan than a pudding.

Doubled this for a work party.  Came out beautifully.  Made explicitly as directed  and have 0 complaints.

Light subtle taste.  Lightly sweet.  What I wish I had done differently is choose a more decorative mold.  I was worried that it would not come out cleanly if I used an ornate, decorative mold but this came out so cleanly and easily that I think it would've set up beautifully in any mold and been prettier and more impressive for my work party.  I served alongside a mango, pineapple, banana coconut fruit salad and the whole thing felt very light and tropical.

1 last thing to note;  covering it with saran wrap when it's hot caused condensation to form, so when I went to flip the tembleque out it had accumulated a little water that I poured off before flipping onto a plate.  So make sure you drain the water off of it before flipping out so it's not sitting in a sad puddle of water or allow to cool before covering with saran wrap and refrigerating.

Thank you for this recipe,  next time I might try the addition of a little bit of almond extract and see what that does for this already perfect as-is recipe.

I've made this many times. It's perfect for last-minute gatherings. It's inexpensive, GF (though not corn-free), and easy to adjust the recipe for the expected crowd. I have made this many times and will make it again.

Made it. Very simple and easy recipe to make. Made no adjustments to the original recipe and everyone I served it to loved it. This a simple recipe and you can build on it by adding strawberries, or any other creative ideas you may want to try.

Tembleque is a coconut custard not pudding and means earthquake not "wiggly". This was delicious and very Puerto Rican.

it was sweet enough, but we could taste the corn starch more than the coconut milk.
also, after a day in the refrigerator , the consistency was consistent with a thin cream of wheat.
