First things first and this injection was excellent.  Where the confusion came in for me is in the smoking directions. 4 hours on a smoker and then another 8 hours in the oven would be overkill. I understand why it is pulled off of the smoker and finished in the oven (smoke flavor) but I chose to do it all on the smoker. After I got the smoke I desired on it I wrapped it in foil until the last hour where I pulled it off to get the bark back on it.  265 for 6 hours was perfect. This is an excellent injection and one I will use again.
