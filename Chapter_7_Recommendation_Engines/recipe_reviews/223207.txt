Soooooo great on the milk and orange braised carnitas I made! An acidic, bright pop of tropical flavor!

Very nice on grilled grouper, but would be equally good on a grilled boneless chicken breast.  This also would be a nice topping on crostini, something a little different from the traditional tomato-basil combo.  The citrus really gives this a burst of freshness and the jalape√±o a little kick of heat.  Would make this one again.
