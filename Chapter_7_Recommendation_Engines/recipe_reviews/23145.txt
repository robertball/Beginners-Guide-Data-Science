Excellent recipe, i did make modifications to make it taste and look more like Chili's soup. Added: 1 tbs of chili powder, 1/4 teapoon of cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon of onion powder in place of whole onion xtra lb of chicken, used full 10oz can of enchilada sauce & 1/2 can of tomato paste (small can) and used 1/2 lb of light velvetta these changes it made it taste just like if not better than chili's version with much less fat/cal.

Could someone tell me what exactly you do with the masa harina powder? I don't feel like I am getting the results I should be with this soup. It turns out really thick, lumpy, and grainy and tastes like flour... that's why I think I am doing something wrong with the masa harina. You don't directly put the masa harina powder/water mixture in the soup do you? Thanks for any help!

Yummy. I think it is close to Chili's C. E. soup. I heated a tbsp olive oil and added 2 cloves of garlic and then added 3 small chicken breasts. I cooked the breasts in a pot on both sides until juices were clear. Then I removed the chicken and added the diced onions and cooked until translucent. I poured in 2 (14.5 oz each)cans of chicken broth and stirred. I mixed 1/4 cup of masa harina which is corn flour (Quaker company makes this also found on the aisle where the Latino food products are or near the regular white flour)with a 1/2 cup of water, stir it well to get out lumps and then I added it to the pot that has the chicken broth and onions. Then I mix another 1/4 cup of masa harina with just enough water to make it like a thick, wet paste, stir it until blended, it should not look dry or crumbly, but smooth and sort of thick. I added this mixture to the pot and stirred. Then I added 1 cup water, I made up a package of mc cormick enchilada sauce and added all of it to the pot (approx. 3 cups or more), 16 oz of velveeta cheese, salt, chili powder & cumin. Stirred. Brought to a boil, stirring often so the cheese did not stick as much and also used a non-stick pot. Added diced cooked chicken. Stirred. Reduce heat and I simmer until thick about 5 minutes. This gives the soup a thick/thin top texture, not as grainy from the masa harina. I topped it with pico de gallo and crushed tortilla chips (Tia Rosa Mega thins) and a little shredded cheese. Excellente!!

I used this as a basic recipe, but then also added ingredients listed in the Chicken Tortilla Soup I (by Star Pooley), also on this website.
Revisions using THIS recipe included:  using one whole large chopped onion (rather than 1/2), 3 garlic cloves (rather than 1), did not add the 3rd cup of water, used green enchilada sauce, used real jack cheese (rather than processed "cheese" and used it as a garnish only), did not add salt.  I also cut the chicken breasts up into bite-sized pieces and put them in one of those basket-vegetable steamers rather than cooking in oil.
From the OTHER Tortilla Soup recipe, I also added 1/4 tsp oregano, 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes, 1 c corn, 1 c white hominy, 1 can chopped green chilis, and 1 can black beans.  I used cilantro, grated jack cheese, and crumbled tortilla chips as a garnish.
I tossed it all in a crockpot to finish up and my hub and I wolfed on it tonight with a margarita.  It was good!  Thanks Letha and Star!

This is absolutely one of the best tasting soups I've ever tasted!  And I've always been a big soup lover and have made and eaten many kinds of soups!  The seasonings are perfect, and the texture is smooth and almost creamy.  I think that Masa Harina flour gives it that wonderful texture.  This recipe goes into my family recipe book to make sure we have it for years to come!  In fact, this is one of two soups I'm serving for a small holiday get-together w/ my parents, who are also soup-lovers.  Thanks for sharing this!!

Delicious.  The masa harina adds a wonderful texture.  I omitted the processed cheese and sprinkled a teaspoon of Pepper Jack cheese on each bowl.

I have been making this recipe for years.  Nearly everyone I give it to loves it. I sometimes use instant corn meal in place of the masa harina.  I wouldn't recommend the corn starch that another reviewer used- this recipe gets so much of its character from the masa harina that won't shine through with corn starch.  I like to use a small can of mexican style tomato sauce because it gives the same flavor but is less expensive than enchilada sauce.  This soup definitely gets much thicker the second or third day, so you may need to add water, and if keeping it on a simmer, make sure to stir often or you will have burnt cheese. (Even then, it's pretty good!!!)

What a great soup!  I boiled the chicken first and left out the oil and also the salt (I like alot of salt, but the cheese has plenty in it).  I did find that I had to stir it constantly to keep it from scorching.  I couldn't find anything labeled 'masa harina', so I asked at the grocery store and was directed to 'instant corn masa mix'.  It worked great!  Very tasty!  Economical too!

A potluck favorite at work.  I shred up a pre-roasted chicken and cut everything else up the night before. Then I bring it all to work and throw it in the crock pot.  When lunch time rolls around the office smells wonderful. I go home with an empty crock pot every time.

This is great! I used corn starch instead of masa harena to thicken. I also deleted one cup of water and added two cans of Rotel tomatoes. Delicious!

This smelled exactly like my favorite Mexican's restaurants enchilada sauce! Must be the enchilada sauce, cumin and chili powder. I may make enchilada sauce based on this in the future. This took forever to boil. In fact, I didn't have the time to wait for it to do so. Good flavor.

Not to our taste.  An earlier reviewer had said it tasted like chili's.  NO! I usually don't review recipes I don't like, but I don't want to make the mistake of making this again.

BAM!  This is the PERFECT chicken enchilada soup. Tastes just like a bowl you'd get from Chili's (major restaurant chain). The only changes I made were adding a small can of chopped green chile's and instead of using red enchilada sauce (which is full of grease) I chose to use a 10oz can of green chile enchilada sauce.  Omg, mega flavor.  I served it with some corn tortilla chips and my husband slurped it up like it was going out of style.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.  : )

Excellent!    I also did some tweaking to the recipe, just like everyone else.  I didn't have masa harina, so I googled what I could use as a substitute.  I ended up putting corn tortillas in my processor and mixed a cup of that mixture with the 2 cups of water.  It worked perfectly.  I also used half a pound of Velveeta instead of a pound, put a cup of frozen corn in (I love corn), then topped the soup with real cheese.  I used mozzarella.    I tasted it halfway through the cooking process and thought it was a little bland.  So I added half a package of taco seasoning and it rocked my socks off!!  I served it with corn chips, cheese and sour cream as toppers.  It was very very yummy.

This soup is very good.  I would suggest the red enchildia sauce and not the green for presentation sake.  The masa harina flour makes a big differance.  I wouldn't make it without it.

Excellent!  I did add Rotel but that was the only extra thing - that, I believe is what makes it taste like the soup from Chili's.  Very good!

I made this years ago!  It is a clone of Chili's chicken enchilada soup. It is pretty good. But, I remember it made quite a lot! But, at least it kicked my craving for that soup there. I think you would have had to of eaten the soup there to appreciate this recipes. At the restaurant it is close to $5 a cup. I believe theirs is topped with: tortilla strips, small diced tomatoes, cheese, and green onion to.

My boyfriend and I just LOVE this recipe. I normally add a can of diced chili's and some red pepper flakes to add a little more heat to it. And it's also good served with some corn chips in it.

With many changes this was good but I dont believe in rating a recipe 5 stars after I changed it. The way it was tasted too much like watered down cheese so I added cayenne, more chili powder, tomato sauce, more enchilada sauce and more cumin. I also thickened it with corn tortillas as in another recipe. With my changes it was very much like Chilis soup. I guess it was a good starter recipe.

I'm not the hugest fan of velveeta cheese, so I replace it with half the amount of mild cheddar cheese. The soup was good overall, but nothing to write home about. A little bit too heavy. You could possibly adjust that by adding more water initially.

This is an excellent version of Chili's enchilada soup.  I tried it with left over smoked turkey and it was fantastic.  Very filling and hearty.

I had a devil of a time finding masa harina.  In fact, my first attempt I ended up having to substitute it with corn meal.  Everybody at Sunday dinner loved it, with the exception of my sister and I who couldn't get over the graininess.  My second go-round was much more successful.  I found a wonderful little mexican supermarket that had the masa harina and presto chango!  Perfection!!

This soup is my new favorite! I couldn't keep my family out of the left overs and as soon as it was gone they were asking for more! Very filling. I think I'm going to try adding some corn and black olives next time to jazz it up a little more, other than that it's just fabulous!!

Absolutely delicious!!!  The only thing I did differently was instead of using processed cheese I just grated monterey jack cheese into the soup.

This was very good.  But I couldn't give it 5 stars because I had to add a can of black beans and some corn in it to give it a little more substance... but the flavor was excellent!

I made this and it turned out awesome!!! I used 1lb. of pepper jack cheese by velveeta and it gave it the kick I was looking for. I also added 1 can of black beans, 1 can of corn to make it more of a meal opposed to soup. I'll be making this for my boyfriend and friends for their hunting trip next week. Great recipe....Thanks

Recipe is excellent and it is from www.topsecretrecipies.com  It is the near exact replica of the Chili's Enchilada Soup...very excellent!

I use a reduced fat version of Velveeta...can't tell the difference!  Also very good with pork.

This was really good! My only problem is it seemed to take forever to make- it took me about 2 hours to get done. I liked the texture though, the taste.  I used multi-grain tortilla chips to crunch on top.

This is a very, very good soup! I had some at Chili's a couple of weeks ago and decided to search for a recipe to make it own my own. I am so glad I did because I have enough to last me and save some money. Thanks for this posting the recipe.

I've never found a recipe that came out tasting so much like a restaurant item before.  This is exactly like Chili's enchilada soup.  Here's what I did.  To make sure my chicken was nice and moist I cooked it in a bit of oil, seasoned with some garlic powder and onion powder and then added a cup of chicken broth, brought to a boil, reduced heat and simmered for about 20 minutes.  You should use a good quality or homemade enchilada sauce since it is so much part of the flavor of this recipe.  I like the McCormick seasoning packet and it makes just a little more than needed for this.  I reduced the amount of masa to 3/4 cup for a better texture and it was perfect.  I used about 12 oz. velveeta and then about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar.  The only other change I made was to double the chili powder (2 tsp.) and add in about 1/2 tsp. each of garlic and onion powder to the soup mixture.  Taste before you add the salt, it probably won't need a whole teaspoon depending on what type of chicken broth you used.  If I didn't know that I just made it, I would believe it was from Chili's.  We topped with a bit of shredded cheese and some crushed tortilla chips.  It's very filling and a small amount goes a long way.  Good to serve as a side dish to sandwiches.

This was pretty good and pretty easy to make.  I always keep cooked ckicken in my freezer so it took no time to throw this soup together.  I agree with others to cut down on the masa harina to 1/2 cup.  It turned out a pretty good consistency so I think 1 cup would make it way too thick.  I don't know why some are having problems finding masa harina.  I live in Iowa and our local Wal-Mart carries it.  Good tasting soup so thanks for sharing this recipe.

5 stars for both taste and it is so easy to prepare.  Even my young children loved this soup. This is very similar to the enchilada soup at the "Soup or Salad" resturaunts that I have been searching for.  I will definately be making this again!

Made this using 'hot' enchilada sauce and left out the chili powder.  Gave it a nice bite.  Served it with Carrot salad with pineapple and raisins.  Good contrast of flavors and textures and the carrot salad immedicately put out the 'burn'.

My family loved this soup! The only thing I did different was add 1 cup of fresh salsa to give it more color. I also cut corn tortillas into thin strips and baked them in the oven for a few minutes. Then sprinkled grated cheese and the chips on top.

This is such a good soup!!  I made it after having eaten this soup at Chili's and loving it!!  It definately tastes like their soup.  I used chicken from the deli that was already cooked and in the soup somehow burnt the chicken but other than that the soup was delicious!!

This soup was wonderful!  Instead of frying the chicken, I placed the chicken breasts on a cookie sheet, sprikled them with enchilada seasonoing, and baked for 20 minutes.  Then shredded and followed the recipie.  I made it for my friends and they are still raving about it.  This is definately one I'll make again and again!

Although tasty, this certainly wasn't the "prettiest" soup I've ever had. Brace yourself - this looks VERY unappetizing, but if you can get past that, it's not bad at all (and it really DOES taste like the chain's enchilada soup). As with most new recipes I try, I found it necessary to make a few changes. To use up some pantry items, I followed Traci's advice and added a can of (rinsed / drained) black beans and Mexicorn (also drained) and about a half cup of chunky salsa to my soup. Fearing that 1 lb. of cheese would be overkill, but half that amount wouldn't be enough, I added 12 oz. worth of (nacho) Velveeta. I also added an entire 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce instead of the 1 c. called for (why waste 2 oz. worth?). To speed prep, I subbed a rotisserie chicken (breast only, refrigerated to make chopping it easier). My final change was to cut the masa back to 3/4 c. I think my soup would have been too thick had I not done so. Tri-colored tortilla strips, fresh pico, a dollop of sour cream and chopped green onion were PERFECT garnishes (and all a MUST!). Margaritas were a great accompainment! Thanks for sharing, SILVANUS. :-)

After making this soup a few times we have found a few changes that suit our personal tastes. I season the chicken pretty well with Tony Chachere's before browning, use Chipotle chili powder in place of regular chili powder and then added in a can or two of Rotel tomatoes (don't drain them)in place of the 3rd cup of water.  We also decided to add in a handful of chopped cilantro, a small package of frozen corn and a can of black beans (drained and rinsed).  Because we found the consistency a bit thick for our tastes we now add in an extra can or two of chicken broth for a thinner soup.   We find the additions make the soup more flavorful and a bit more hearty.

Delicious!  I did thin it down a little with some additional broth, as it was VERY thick.  Overall, though, it was the best chicken enchilada/tortilla soup I've made.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious letha!!  This has now become my favorite soup from this site...and I've tried a lot. I boiled some chicken tenderloins rather than cooking them on the stove top and I didn't have the masa harina so I used yellow cornmeal.  Now, I read all of the reviews and no one had made this substitution, so I was a little nervous.  BUT, the outcome was terrific.  I used the new velvetta singles rather than the block kind and added a can of rotel for some extra umph.  With those few substitutions this soup turned out perfect.  Next time I will use the masa harina. My husband is not an enchilada fan so this was all mine! Many thanks for this submission.

Great recipe!  I added 1 cup of rice and a can of diced tomatoes to the recipe and garnished it with sour cream-definitley a keeper.

I tried this one on a lark...what a hit!!!!!  I liked it instantly and I must have had 5 requests for the recipe before the day was out.  I'd scaled the recipe for 25 so we had a little left over...Unlike a lot of soups that taste better the second day, this one didn't set to well with me after the first day.....but then again....nobody else had a problem with it and said it was just as good the second time.  A great keeper recipe.

I used to make a similar soup to this using canned cheddar cheese soup.It was my son's favorite. We have recently learned he is allergic to soy so I have been hunting for a new version of this soup without the soy. This soup not only filled that need it surpassed it! Love this soup just as written.

This was very good, and very rich and filling. I didn't have processed chesse, so I grated about 3\4 of a cup of chedder chesse I had. At the store I grabed green enchilada sauce instead of red, oh well, it was good. I forgot tomatoe paste, so I used about a TBSP. of chili sauce I had in the fridge. I thought this soup turned out pretty good. So did my husband.

Awesome!.. My family liked this even better than our usual Chicken Tortilla soup!...  I followed reviewers advice and CUT THE MASA HARINA DOWN (or it will be too thick) to 3/4 cup, used half the Velveeta cheese (Nacho).  Add a cup of CORN and a can of BLACK BEANS also 1/2 cup of SALSA... soooo good!  We put sour cream, crispy tortilla stips, shredded cheese, salsa and chopped cilantro on top!..

Very good soup. It was a little on the thick side.  Next time I will not use as much masa harina or add extra chicken broth.  I added some chopped jalapenos for some extra spice and a seeded, diced roma tomato.  Definitely will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

LOVE this soup. Only one addition... I had to throw in sliced up corn tortillas, and sometimes, when I want it extra spicy, I throw in a can of Rotel tomatoes.

Not spellbounding. It was good, and we happily ate it, but I expeceted something a little better for the rating it had. Mild and bland in some regards and very thick as writ. Would probably change a few things.

Good soup for a cold winter's night.  I had to substitute with corn chips and chicken boullion cubes.  It's a keeper in the Soup Department.

This recipe is so delicious!  I tweaked it by adding corn and Ro-tel tomatoes and substituting the chili powder for taco seasoning.  I served this with corn bread and my family loved it.  I liked it so much, my co-worker made it for her family and they loved it too.

This was really good and very easy.  I increased the chicken as some suggested but it was too much.  Next time, I'll use about 1 1/2 lbs of chicken.  I may just use  a roast chicken for the meat and cut out the extra step of cooking the chicken.  Also I decreased the Maseca to about 3/4 of a cup.  Perfect consistency.  I fried small strips of corn tortillas to garnish and I used pepper jack cheese and rotel mexican style for garnish as well.  Everyone loved it.

I really liked this soup a lot and the only reason I give it four instead of 5 is because the prep time/effort is too much. Also(and maybe I'm just the minority here), who in the h@#4 knows what masa harina is?! I had to freakin' google the stuff, then search for it in the Goya aisle of Giant Eagle to no avail before surrendering and just using plain old flour. Darn my cravings for Max & Erma's tortilla soup. It did come darn close though and that's why I'm pretty certain that I'll be making this bad boy again.

This does taste like the soup you can get at Chilis. I love that so I was thrilled with this recipe. I recommend bringing the soup to a boil slowly after you add the cheese, otherwise it won't blend quite as well and you'll be scraping the burnt bits off the bottom of your pot for a long time!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe the first day that I made it.  I thought it needed something, so I added a can of whole kernel corn. I also think it could be better with a can of Rotel tomatoes, but I was feeding a toddler and tried to keep it mild.  After refrigerating it overnight, it was much better the next day.  My 3 year old likes it.  You definitely need the masa harina.  I believe that is corn flour for the other reviewer who wasn't sure what it was.  I found it in the flour/cornmeal section of the grocery store.  It may also be found with the ethnic foods.  Will make again with a few modifications.

This was so flavorful and easy.  It only took 10 minutes max, to put together, and didn't have to dirty a lot of dishes.  The masa flour gives it a true restaurant taste.

My best friend and I have recently started doing "Once A Month Cooking" sessions. I added this recipe to our cooking day last month and it was a HUGE hit with both families. It is incredibly simple to make, tastes delicious and freezes beautifully. We doubled the recipe...next month we'll be making a quadruple batch!

I started recipe as written (except for using Quorn faux Chicken and vegetarian chicken broth).  I put it in my crock pot on low overnight.  When I tried it in the morning, it was super bland!  I tripled the spices, added 3/4 jar of black bean salsa, extra faux chicken broth and doubled the enchilida sauce.  Much better!  I decided to add rice and corn in addition to the cheese.  Topped with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream.  Delicious!!  Definitely not a soup.  More of a stew.  Very thick and filling.  I didn't have any issues mixing in the Masa.  I like the texture it added.

I absolutely love Chili's chicken enchilada soup, and was so excited to try this! It did not disappoint! Oh my gosh, this soup is excellent!!! I live in a small city where I couldn't find masa, so I tore up corn tortillas as suggested, and I don't see how it could have tasted any better! I will definitely be making this one again, and again, and again!!!

Really good start.  I added extra chili powder and cumin, it was a little bland. I also added black beans, corn and green peppers, made it more of a meal.

The only difference between this recipe and the Enchilada Soup III recipe is the addition of processed cheese instead grated cheddar. This recipe is better, because of that. However 1 lb is way too much. I only used 8 oz and then topped with real cheese. 
It is alot easier just to cook the chicken in the chicken broth.
I substitute the water for additional.
I thought it was a little bland and had to double the spices. And to give it a little more substance, I added corn and black beans.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only thing that I would do differently next time is that I would boil the chicken instead of sauteeing it, either that or I'd pound the chicken out evenly...mine didn't get evenly done and it made it tough to shred.  Also, make sure and put it away immediately after serving or you'll get a nasty film on the top!  This was a very hardy soup and it had the taste of enchiladas without the fat and calories (I used lowfat Velveeta and no oil).  I will definitely make this again.

I have been making this recipe for years and I love it. I usually add a little extra enchilada sauce and spices.

This was awesom!  I will defiantly  make this again.  I was not sure what kind of cheese to use so I used Velveta.  My husband did not think that it sounded very good but when he tasted it he really liked it!  This would also make a great dip if you shredded the chicken or shopped it really fine.

This was outstanding!  I took up some suggestions of previous reviews and added a can of petite diced tomatoes with jalapenos in place of the last cup of water as well as used a little more than 1/2 cup masa harina.  I also added a can of corn and a small can of hot diced jalepenos for some kick (maybe a little too much kick - it was really spicy!).  I used light velveeta as well, and no would would have been the wiser (other than a slight skin that formed on top while cooking which may happen with regular, too).  It was a little more prep work than I usually like, but it turned out great!  I think my boyfriend was pleasantly shocked at how yummy it was!  Surprisingly great consistancy and flavor!

This review, from a 12-yr-old critic, sums up the family feeling:  "I loved it. It was spicy, it was cheesy, it was awsome. It is now my favorite type of soup. I really love it."

The only changes I made were to cut the masa harina to 1/2 cup and to leave out the salt.

Love this soup!  It's a regular at our house.  I omit the chili powder but that's it.  You do have to watch it carefully once you add the cheese.  It can burn if you don't stir frequently. Great recipe!

This was perfect, exactly as I was looking for.  I garnished with crushed tortilla chips.  I also used half Hot Mexican velveeta cheese and half regular, it was spicy, but the kids could still handle it!  It was SOOOO good, I ALMOST wish winter wasn't almost over so I could enjoy this longer!

This soup is the best!! I used Velveeta mexican mild with mild enchilada sauce and it was quite spicy. The only thing I'll do differently next time is use more chicken, maybe 1 1/2 or 2 pounds. This soup is great reheated and served over blue corn tortilla chips.

So absolutely fabulous.  You've got to get the masa harina (a friend shipped it to me in New Jersey from Californa) -- it made all the difference!  Crush some tortilla chips on top -- it's awesome!!

Wonderful soup!  I added a little more onion and garlic. I only used 1/2 cup masa harina as my husband doesn't like thick soups.  I used 'hot' enchilada sauce, so skipped the chili powder.  Also added a can of crushed Mexican style stewed tomatoes.  Used pepper jack cheese, and poured the soup over tortilla chips in each bowl, like they do at one of our favorite restaurants.  YUM!

I was a little disappointed in the recipe the first day I made it.  I thought it needed a little something.  I'm vegetarian so I made a lot of substitutions...I used vegetable broth, added a can of black beans and a can of corn.  The next day, I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and that made the soup taste better.  I also added only about half of the processed cheese and half of shredded mexican style cheese.  I didn't really like the flavor of the processed cheese so I think I will be adding all real shredded cheese, maybe some pepperjack also.  After sitting for a while, the soup becomes very thick.  I served the soup with spicy cheese quesadillas and salsa.  The soup is very heavy so a little goes a long way.  Overall, this is a good and hearty soup and I will be making it again.

This soup is so good!  I believe the masa flour is the key ingredient (as in don't bother making it without it!) because that's what makes it taste like you're eating enchiladas in soup form.  My kids dipped tortilla chips into theirs.  I served it with crusty bread, but I don't think it was necessary - just a small salad would've been fine.

This recipe is spicy and filling....perfect for a cold, rainy day. It was very good! I soft fried some table top corn tortillas, cut them into small strips and stirred them in during the end of the cooking time. I also thought it needed a little color so I added two green onions sliced. I served it with a little grated cheese and a dollop of sour cream on top. I will make this recipe again!

This morning I woke up with a sore throat. Decided I needed to make chicken soup. I looked up recipes, but instead of chicken noodle, I found this recipe. I took some chicken out of the freezer and cooked it in my InstantPot. After that I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I changed was that I topped the final product with fresh pick de gallo. This was fabulous! I clicked on the heart above and certainly plan on making this many times over the next few Fall months. You should try this!

I made as written, but felt it was a little bland, even using medium enchilada sauce.  I was hoping for some heat with this, so I then added a drained can of original Rotel and about 2 tbsp. of chopped jalapenos and then is was excellent.

I add a little more cumin and chili powder than this calls for, and I cut back on the cheese a bit.  It's a favorite, and freezes well.

This is a delicious soup!  Followed the recipe with the exception I didn't have enough processed cheese so added some of the jarred processed cheese as well.  Not spicy at all, just flavorful.  Sure could add cayenne or hot sauce to warm it up if you choose but I kind of liked it just as it is! Will definitely make it again!

Appreciated the tips others gave.  I doubled the recipe and added 2 cans of black beans and some hot peppers for flavor.  I did not double the masa/water, so the consistency was good.  Another option to add flavor, is to use more enchilada sauce and less water.  Good hearty soup!

I didn't add the processed cheese but rather topped each bowl of soup with shredded cheese.  It was great!

I modify it a bit. I add green chili's and crushed tomatoes. In stead of masa harnia I use corn bread. I also spice it up a little more.

This was an instant hit. I didn't use the processed cheese but added Colby jack as we served it. This is definitely a make again recipe.

I liked this recipe a lot even though I had to go out and buy masa harina just for it. It froze well for me and reheats in the microwave at work, but after I made it, I realized that the enchilada sauce I made from another allrecipes recipe made it unsuitable for me friend with celiac disease (gluten intolerance) due to minimal flour used as thickening in the sauce.  Next time, I think I should be able to make the enchilada sauce gluten free too by using a little more of the masa harina and, if that works, I would give it a 5 star rating.

Overall great recipe. When it asks to add the remaining water, I used chicken broth.  I added rotel, black beans, green chilis, more cumin, more garlic.  I topped with sour cream and tortilla chips.  Next time I might use real monterrey jack, as opposed to processed cheese.

This tastes EXACTLY like that popular casual dining places Enchilada Soup!  The only difference I experienced was simply a slightly more textured soup which, may have been due to the fact that I used a heavy cast iron enameled pot.  It was still absolutely delicious and I will definitely be making it again!

I followed the complete recipe and tasted the soup while it simmered-I noticed that it lacked flavor and seemed TOO salty (from the velvetta and added salt) I added an entire 16OZ can of red enchilada sauce as well as a small can of diced chile peppers. It still tasted too salty and could only taste the cheese. The soup turned out more like a dip as it was really thick. I was really hoping to have a good experience with this recipe. Darn!

This was a really good recipe! It's about as close as you can get to Chili's, although I admit it's not exact. I worked there for a year about ten years ago and ate it every day, so maybe I'm biased, but the recipe is still really really good and probably is as close as humanly possible.

I made this for a potluck and people were asking me for the recipe.  I put in about 1/3 of the Velveeta block.  Next time I'll just use 3/4 of a cup of the masa harina.  Tasted great with the addition of the enchilada sauce I got from allrecipes too.

I think I used the wrong type of cheese. I didn't understand the directions at first and used cheddar instead of the "velveeta" block processed cheese. Might have changed the outcome drastically. Still, the soup was decent and went very well with beer.

Love this recipe; have made it several times with rave reviews every time.  I serve with tortilla chips and end up eating almost more like a dip than a soup!  I use masa flour; not sure if that's the same as masa harina.

On my 2nd batch I left out the masa harina...tooo grainy for me.  Though, my entire family loves this soup.  I too added black beans and frozen corn.  Thanks for the starter, this is something I will make twice a month!

This turned out great after a lot of tweeking:  use 1/2 cup of masa harina - a full cup is way too thick.  Also added six or seven slices of pickled jalapeno chopped, 8 ounces hot salsa blended thoroughly, and 1/2 packet of spicy taco seasoning mix.  Husband loved it.

I had chicken enchillada soup at a chain resturant that was delicious so I came on line looking for a recipe.  This was very good and I feel was much better than the on served in the resturant.  My husband raved about it and had to take it to his coworkers.

Yum, yum, yum! Everyone raved about the soup. I think it tastes better than the Chicken Enchilada soup served at Chili's. I topped with Lime flavored tostada chips, cheese and diced tomato.

This soup is very easy and good.  I added black beans, corn and rotel to the soup (an idea from another rater) then garnished with avocado, tomato, and cilantro which really made the soup yummy!

This soup was FANTASTIC!!  To make it a little more hearty I jazzed it up with a can of corn, a can of black beans, and a can of rotel.  I also baked thinly sliced strips of corn tortillas and used those for a topping along with some shredded cheese a dollop of sour cream and some cilantro to garnish.  It tasted just like it was made from a restuarant.  The whole family loved it!  I will definately be keeping this recipe, thank you so much for sharing it!!!

We LOVE this soup.  We have made it with both mild and hot enchilada sauce.  With the hot it was too spicy for our kids.  The mild had plenty of flavor for the adults and was perfect for the kids.

This soup was delicious. I used mild mexican Velveeta for cheese, it gave it a little kick.  It also reheated very well the next day.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, I plan to make it again soon.

This soup was great.  The only modifications I made was to add two small cans of diced chiles, and instead of the chili powder and cumin I used 1 1/2 tsp. of Mexican spices (gave it a nice bite).  Other than that, I loved the consistency, thickness, and taste.

This had a wonderful, authentic-tasting flavor, but i felt like i was just drinking some liquid.  Next time I will do what other reviewers did and add chilis, corn, and maybe some beans to give the soup some texture.  The masa harina is a must for that corn tortilla flavor!

This soup is delicious!  I added about 3/4 of a small can of diced green chilis for a little "bite" and it was perfect. Very easy to make and also very filling.

I have to give this 10 thumbs up...and we haven't even eaten yet!  My nephew was starving and couldn't wait, and his opinion on a 1 to 10...he gave me an 80!  I even confirmed he really MEANT 80...not an 8...and he said it's absolutely fantastic!
I used Red Enchilada Sauce (this site) and initially thought it was spicy, so I didn't use the cumin, chile powder, salt.  Then it seemed bland, so I used the whole Enchilada Sauce recipe, and still added a can of Mild RoTel.  Also used 1/2 lb Velveeta and 1/2 lb shredded cheddar.  Absolutely awesome!  Thank you, Letha!

I thought it was interesting but my husband felt it was bland.  If you like a mild mexican flavored soup you'll probably like this.

This soup is SO good!  The only change I made was to add some white wine to it.  I don't know how it would have tasted without it, but with it - oh, so yummy.  Thanks for a new favorite.

This is a delicious soup. I didn't know where to find the masa tarina in my area (South-Western Ontario), so my Latin American friend told me to use a corn flour called MASECA, found in the international section of some grocery stores. I also used the RED ENCHILADA SAUCE recipe found on this website, which suited it perfect. The only changes I made is that I used Monterey Jack cheese and next time I would add a little more cumin, as I could not taste it at all.

Made this recipe this weekend and it was excellent.  I'd recommend even more chicken (prolly 1.5-2 lbs), a whole can of enchilada sauce (10 oz?), and maybe only 1/2 lb processed cheese.  We also added a can of rotel tomatoes  green chilies and thought it could have used two since there's not much substance to this soup.  We cooked the chicken on the George Foreman grill so we didn't need the oil except a teeny bit for the onions and garlic.    

I'd like to hear if anybody has made this with light processed cheese.

What a great tasting soup!  I used hot enchilada sauce for extra spice.  I would add a little more broth next time and you really need to watch it so the bottom doesn't burn.  I am definitely adding it to the dinner rotation.

Absolutley AMAZING! My husband does not like canned enchilada sauce so I used a can of Rotel instead.  But that was the only thing I changed. It was perfect. Thanks.

This is a really good cheesy soup.  Even my kids ate it, and my mom had to have the recipe for a party she was going to.  It is simple, but very tasty.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and it came out great (although we did have a bit of burnt cheese, but you couldn't even taste it).  Everyone raved about it and even my picky eldest daughter gulped it down (she ate it like nachos, dipping chips in it!)  Thanks to letha for sharing this one!
