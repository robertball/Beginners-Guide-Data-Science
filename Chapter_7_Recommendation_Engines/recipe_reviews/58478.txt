Delicious, simple recipe - my husband loved it!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts to cut out the fat, so to compensate, I marinated the chicken in lemon juice for several hours and added a few tbs of water to the bottom of the pan so the mushrooms wouldn't dry out.  I also spread each chicken breast with about 1/4 tsp chicken base for extra flavor.  During the last 8-10 minutes I added some zucchini chunks and tossed with the mushrooms and onions.  The result - a complete meal right out of the oven!  Next time I think I'll try using fresh garlic cloves instead of the powder.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious, thank you so much! We eat chicken thighs at least once a week and this recipe is definietly going into the rotation. I did not change any of the ingredients, however I did alter the prep to make this dish more flavorful. First I season the bottom of the thighs. Then I place them skin side up in the dish and peel back the skin completely but  leaving it attached along one edge. Then I season the bare meat with the spices and lemon juice. Replace the skin into its original position, drizzle each piece with a little olive oil and massage into the skin with your fingers. Bake at 375 for 1 hour and you won't have to mess with turning or broiling - just walk away. Your skin will be nicely crispy and the chicken will be moist and tasty!

I have made this recipe with portobello mushrooms and also with white mushrooms,  Both ways were excellent and my family loves this recipe.  However, I only used one lemon as two large ones  overpowered the dish.

The chicken was good but the mushrooms (in my opinion) were ruined by being cooked in the chicken fat that drips out of the chicken. If I did it over I'd cook them separately.

I was somewhat disappointed in this overall. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it never picked up any real flavor from any of the ingredients, just kinda blah. Nobody in the family really cared for it. It may need some additional seasoning to perk it up. It was very easy however.

Truly enjoyable!  I used bone-in chicken breasts.  I marinated them for a couple of hours first with the lemon juice, minced garlic, and a couple of tablespoons of zesty Italian dressing I had left in a bottle.  I also removed the skin from the chicken, since I wanted to reduce the fat and several people said leaving it on made the mushrooms taste odd.  My husband isn't a big fan of portobellas, and he cleaned his plate!  The lemon is strong, so some may want to reduce the amount used--I loved it with the strong citrus flavor.

I tried to make this without the skin to save calories, but I don't think it was the same.  I found the chicken was flavorful, but not the veggies.  It was entirely edible, but unless I make it with the skin, I probably won't make it again.

I really enjoyed this chicken! It was really tangy from the lemon, but not too much. I was scared that it might get too dry, so I also sprayed some Italian Dressing on it (nice addition in my humble opinion). Served it with a nice Greek salad covered in a thin tzatziki sauce! Very good!

This recipe was awesome! I used bone-in chicken breasts, and put about 4 coarsly chopped garlic cloves in with the mushrooms and onions. It was simple and a big hit!

Delicious!  I had no mushrooms, so I used potatoes instead.  I cooked the chicken covered for 40 minutes and then uncovered for 20 more minutes.  Came perfect, maybe the best chicken I ever had!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with chicken thighs and drizzled just a little Italian dressing on top.  Very tender with lots of flavor!  Oh, and EASY!

I tried to add to this (real garlic & spices) to spice it up a bit as suggested and it was still blah.  The only thing I could suggest that might save it is to add a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Sorry, it was edible but I won't be making it again.

Great recipe. Everyone in my family loved it. The only thing I modified was the cooking time: I increased broil time to 10 min, and after that cooked chicken another 15 min at 400 F. The skin came out crispy, and the juice was completely absorbed by mushrooms and chicken. Tasty!

This is really good. I embellished the recipe just a bit by adding shallots, fresh thyme and marinating both the chicken and the mushrooms (separately)in a lemon based marinade for an hour or so. It was a great way to use up extra portabello mushrooms without fusing with a grill, which is my usual method of cooking them. Thanks for the inspiration.

i made this and it was delish... I also did another recipe that made this an absolute hit! I did everything as the recipe called for after the chicken was cooked instead of broiling it all together I took the onion and mushrooms and sauteed them in a pan for  5 min and added the juice from the pan. I than added a 1/4 cup of heavy cream and a half stick of butter than put the sauce of chicken and bowtie pasta!!!

It was far too lemoney for our taste. This is only the second time in 22 years that my husband has said "You don't need to make this recipe again". I was really looking forward to it, but it was a disappointment.

Too lemony!  I used skinless chicken breast but the mushrooms & onion didn't cook very well.  They looked like they were half raw with a boiled texture.  With my healthy modification I think I'll make it again only sautee the onion & mushrooms in a tad of olive oil first and only use 1 lemon.  Otherwise it was pretty healthy and tasty over steamed rice.

This recipe is excellent.  I used bone-in chicken breasts with skin on and they were delicious.  This is a very flavorful recipe, it preps and cooks in a snap!  I will marinate the vegatables next time.

This dish is very easy and very good!  Had a lot of flavor, but I did use rosemary and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Will use this recipe again for sure!
