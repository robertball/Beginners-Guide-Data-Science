Great recipe!  I did add more feta and also when finished add a little hot sauce for a zing.  Great to experiment with different combo's...excellent way to sneak in some spinach!  Would highly recommend.  These burgers do not taste like "turkey meat".

This one went over well with the whole family.  I will add more goat cheese when I cook it again.

This recipe was great. I've made it twice, once with goat cheese and once with feta. Added some oregano. Be sure to squeeze the spinach because the turkey is pretty moist. We did ours outside on the bbq and if you do, be sure to use some oil. My husband and I ate ours on pita, the kids still liked buns. Will become a regular on our menu.

Fantastic! I usually bury my burgers in condiments, but this didn't need a thing.

This was good and very easy to make.  I used goat cheese which has a very distinct taste... it was great in the burgers!

We loved these!  We used pita bread and added tomatoes, onions and sprouts.  Very nice change from the standard burger.

We thought these were a little dry and bland.  I served it on buns with roasted red pepper hummus and extra feta and that made it much much better.
