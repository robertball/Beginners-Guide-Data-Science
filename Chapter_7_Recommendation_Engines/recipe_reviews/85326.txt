The proportions are perfect in this recipe, provided you use GOOD vodka.  If you are above the age of 40, you have probably found a premium vodka you can enjoy straight, or over ice.  Use this one!    However, if you are in your early 20's and it's more of a challenge just to see how much of the cheapest liquor available you CAN possibly drink and still get up the next day, , then you will definitely want to adjust up the measures of Coffee Liqueur and Cream.  I was 20 once.  I remember.  I'm 45 now and I drink premium liquor at a much slower pace!

White Russian is possibly the best drink in the world. After making about two dozen I decided that the best proportion is 2 Tbsps vodka, 3 Tbsp Coffee Liqueur, 3 Tbsp cream(lightly beaten, or you can use shaker if you have one), 3 Tbsp milk + lots of ice And don't forget the straw!

I guess I will have to tell on myself here! I have gulped down more White Russians in my day than I probably should mention! I think they taste better with a double dose of the Kahlua, and are much tastier when half and half is used in place of milk. And just the other day when I discovered I had ran out of half and half, I topped one off with Irish Cream liqueur. It was the best one I had ever had!

Perfect for drinking while watching "The Big Lebowski."  However, I prefer mine with 1 oz vodka to 1 1/2 oz kahlua. Very tasty.

These are good with a half shot more kahlua than vodka, rather than equal parts as this recipe calls for.  Also, I always use milk, because I always have it on hand.

Try with vanilla flavored vodka. Amazing! I was also a bartender for a few months and have put a splash of coke in it. It makes the flavors kind of pop. Its really unexplainable but very good.

I got a margarita machine for Christmas and we used it to make this drink for our New Years Eve guests. Talk about a coffee milk shake!! YUM! I had a bad experience with Black Russians many moons ago so I no drink the coffee flavored liquors, but I did have a taste and OMG was it ever delish! BTW, fat free half and half works really well with this. Thank you!!

this is probably my favorite drink of all time.  Although i love the original way to make it.  i use vanilla vodka instead of just regular.  it gives it a little bit of a sweeter taste but doesn't ruin the O.G. white russian.

This drink is excellent.  I remember in my day I would fix it with a little peppermint schnaps.  It was my version of a Peppermint Patty.  It was delicious and decadent!

easy on the cream... the recipe should be two parts vodka, 1 part coffee liqueur, and a splash of heavy cream.  The recipe as is, is pretty much just a glass of milk.

Quite tasty!  Sipping this now over ice.  I did make mine with a squirt of chocolate syrup, and light Silk coconut milk, as that's what I had in the fridge.  Added a touch more Kahlua as well.

VERY GOOD! I've never tried using milk until now! I love it! In my 2nd one I added alittle extra Kahlua ONLY because I love that extra flavor. Follow it exactly and it is GREAT! Thanks!

A good standard recipe!  This is also good if you replace the coffee liqueur with Irish cream.

I use sweetened black coffee left over from my breakfast brew (made from fresh ground coffee of course) in place of the Kahlua with full fat or UHT milk rather than cream and good quality Vodka (Targovishte Special). Personally I go easy on the "Kahlua", heavy on the Vodka!
The Dude would approve.

I have been drinking White Russian's for 20 years. This was too strong for me. I guess I am a weakling :) I prefer 2-3 times more Kahulua for more flavor. It cuts the the strong Vodka taste.

I adore a good White Russian..I like it with milk instead of cream and a splash (literally a splash) of Coke on top...makes it taste like chocolate milk.  Awesome!

Godd drink. Another one of my favorites. But be careful how much Kaluha you put in. It can be a doozy! All around pretty good.

Mmm, smooth and delicious.  I doubled the cream as I'm not much of an alcohol drinker.  This classic certainly smooths out a rough day.  One and done and very happy.

I had forgotten how good these are. My preference is for 1 part each of vodka, Kahlua, and milk over ice. One of my guests found that a bit strong and preferred to double the milk.

This is my favourite drink. Best vodka I've used for it is Russian Standard vodka. Smooth and refreshing.

I really wanted to try this but didn't have the coffee liqueur. I used regular coffee with creamer in addition to the milk and it was the best!! Can't wait to try with the coffee liqueur!!

The vodka helps cut the sweetness of the Kahlua. But I only put in a splash of fat free half and half. Half a cup seemed like alot. I like the Frozen Mudslide better.

I always use skim milk with these, so that way I don't feel as bad about having a second one.  Serve it super cold, and you don't miss the cream.

Hmm...not bad. I had a white Russian once in my time and that was about 4 or 5 years ago and it was the premixed stuff you can buy and I hated it. I thought I'd give it another try tonight and it tastes good.  I used 1% milk.

Very good, though a littel strong! I only had skim milk, and whipping cream in the fridge, so I used a oz of whipping cream, and topped up the glass with milk. Very tasty
