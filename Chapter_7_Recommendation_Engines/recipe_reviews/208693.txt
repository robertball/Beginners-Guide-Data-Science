This one needs help. Four ingredients is not enough...and eight is only barely in a last ditch effort to add more flavor to an, interesting, but otherwise overpoweringly bland concoction. I like the use of avocado for a cream soup base, however, and will work on this. Also LOVE the history of the Haas avocado. This just isn't the best use of it, or is not taking it to the level we all KNOW it can reach.
