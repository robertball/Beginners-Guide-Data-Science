One of my family's most favorite fruit dip recipes. TIP: The flavor of this dip can be changed by using any kind of favor extract in place of the vanilla. My family really likes it when I use pure maple extract.

I have made this fruit dip for years using just cream cheese and fluff, but, never added the sour cream before.  It was very good and not overly sweet.  I added almond extract instead of vanilla.  This is also good using soft strawberry cream cheese in the tub.

Love the dip but found it a bit too sweet and a little gooey, overpowering the fruit.  However I will definitely be making it again, with maybe 1/2 the marshmallow Fluff.  I also used about a teaspoon of cinnamon, which got a lot of compliments at last night's party.  I will also try Almond extract next time.

Not sure what went wrong, but regardless of how much I used the electric mixer on this, I could not get it to be smooth. Lots of little cream cheese lumps left in. I may try this one again but let the whipped cream cheese sit out to soften before I start mixing.
