The best cookie of its kind.  Really needs 6 or 7 stars. About that kid friendly, it must mean kids eat the whole batch in one sitting. Especially my big "kid" who is 38. Boy can he eat them. Likes them before they are baked, also!

dough was easy to work with.  Cookies slid right off the tray.  8 minutes was perfect in my oven.  Makes a good size batch.  I found that if using unsalted butter, a bit of salt makes them not taste so bland.  I used unsalted and added about 1/4 tsp but could have used more.  Upped the vanilla a bit.  all in all a good basic sugar cookie recipe.  I liked the ones better that were thinner and crispier...those seemed to have a better buttery flavor.  thanks for the recipe.

Definitely remember the taste from when my great-grandmother baked these types of cookies. Tasted just like the cookies from The Depression and WWII eras when sugar was a luxury item! JUST enough sweet to be a nice treat! Great for dipping into milk or coffee. 

It was very sticky, no matter what I did. Least sticky just out of the fridge and a very light dusting of flour on both dough and rolling pin. So, recommend breaking it up into fourths when chilling. Take out of fridge, one quarter of dough at a time, when ready to roll out and cut OR breaking off, rolling into ball, then flatten out a little for baking.

Ok I hate giving bad reviews! This recipe did not work for me at all! The dough was easy to work with but the cookies never held their shape! I threw out the first batch an decided to add about a cup more flour an Thats what they needed! With adjustments they turned out Delicious!

it was a bit dry and when you were rolling it I had to put a lot of flour down in order to be able to get it back up. They were  a bit bland and dry

Love this recipe! I don't have to run out for anything, the ingredients are always here. They have a melt-in-your-mouth softness, and wonderful taste.

I have made these cookies several times, but I have frosted them with butter cream frosting. I have had rave reviews! The cookies disappear in record time :-)

These were a great, delicate sugar cookie that I decided to sprinkle with colored sugars before baking.  Very Good!

These cookies were great! Super soft and easy to make. I didn't have any vanilla left, so I used almond extract and sprinkled them with powdered sugar and they were super delicious!
