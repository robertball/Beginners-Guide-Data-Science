I made this for just myself so I cut it in half.  I thought it was very good.  I think I may have added a bit more cheese than called for but a little extra cheese never hurts!  I will make this again.

Great blend of flavors. The only thing I varied was using extra sharp cheddar.
The next time I make it I'm going to substitute Chili Paste for the Hot Sauce for a little more bite!
