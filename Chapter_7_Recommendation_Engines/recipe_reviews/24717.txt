Excellent Recipe. I didn't have any yeast extract spread, so I substituted nutritional yeast flakes (about 1/4 cup) and it had the same effect. Also, I'm not vegan, so I mashed the potatoes with milk and a little butter to add flavor, and topped with about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar/jack cheese to make a bubbly mess. Also, I added a bunch of frozen green beans to the mix to get more veggies in there.

My family (including two kids - 4 and 2) LOVED this, and my husband asked me when I was going to make it again.

I served it with oven roasted broccoli (broccoli, olive oil and a little salt put in the oven at 450 for about 15 minutes.) Yum, Yum.

Very good and simple.  I took the advice of others and cooked lentils/barley for 15 then added carrots and onions to the same pot.  Came out great.  Also added a bay leaf and oregeno to the lentil mixture and cheese between the mixture and mashed pots.  My husband had 3 helpings!  Note: if you have a family that likes large servings then double the recipe amounts.

This was really good!  I added garlic, and whirled the carrots, walnuts, onions, and garlic in the food processor (rather than chopping/shredding).  Added a little extra water and flour for more gravy.  We are definitely adding it to our regular rotation.

This recipe turned out surprisingly flavourful.  I did make a few alterations though.  First, I doubled it because it is soooo good and you'll want the leftovers.  Then, I added 2 tsp. of garlic to the veggie broth/lentil/barley mixture.  In addition on successive attempts, I added tofu on the bottom, then spinach and mushrooms on top, and then the lentil mixture with some frozen mixed veggies stirred in.  I omitted the nuts and doubled the mashed potatoes to make a yummy "crust".  But each to their own!  Thanks Ron for a great recipe that I will always treasure.

I couldn't get over how good this was. I couldn't get the yeast spread either, but I mixed a little warm water with dry yeast and then measured out the right amount. I also substituted 2 yams and 1 red potato for the topping. I also added a little water after the lental/ barley mixture had cooked for a bit. Thanks for wonderful veg dish.

Many of the suggestions for increasing the seasoning are great.  As for texture, standard Shepherd's Pie isn't exactly a festival of textures!  It's usually a way of using leftovers!  :-)    Marmite/Vegemite are sold in lots of supermarkets, or is available online at Amazon.  It's a great secret ingredient for vegetarians, when used in small amounts, adding a depth of flavor to stews and soups.  It can also be used as a substitute for anchovy paste in recipes calling for that.  This Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie filling could also be made using bulgur wheat instead of barley.  The combination of bulgur (or barley) with lentils makes a great pilaf and a satisfying "meaty" filling or base for shepherd's pie, moussaka, stuffing peppers, veggie-burgers, etc.

This recipe is terrible.  I followed the instructions almost exactly, the only thing i did differently was i used boullion instead of yeast extract.  I also added a cup of water into the barley/lentil mixture before putting it in the oven because I was worried it would have been too dry.  I was correct in doing so as all the water I added was absorbed. 

The coarseness of the lentils, barley walnuts in conjunction with the smoothness of the potato topping just doesn't work. It's chewey and completely throws me off of the rest of the dish.

The only reason I didn't give this 1 star is that at least the flavour was half decent and the dish was marginally edible if you are starving and there is nothing left in your house.

I am really surprised by the high reviews for this recipe. I tried it two nights ago, followed instructions exactly and ended up with a very dense, extremely plain tasting, unpleasant brown/white casserole. The brown layer was as dense as the mashed potatoes, and lacking in color and vegetables. I've been a vegetarian for a long time now, and I wonder how many great veggie recipes some of the readers here have tried. This one had a savory taste and thick texture, but there was just no variety of flavor, no creaminess, no color, blech. I tried it again the next night, thinking it might age well, but no change. Adding copious amounts of cheese, green onions and bacon bits on top helped it resemble a baked potato so we could finish it off.

This recipe has great potential with a little doctoring.  I added celery and wished afterwards that I had also put in some garlic and herbs.  It does require a lot of pots, but is pretty simple to put together.  More vegetable broth was needed.

This was good, but not as good as I had expected.  I added some mushrooms but I think that was a mistake - the texture seemed out of place with the  rest.  Also, I don't understand the need to cook the carrots, onions and walnuts separately, instead of just adding them to the lentils and barley after fifteen minutes.  That's what I did and everything cooked perfectly.  I don't really like cooked carrots, though, so next time I might try using zucchini instead.

A great recipes to play with. I made some changes as I was concerned about the lack of seasoning in the recipe. To the mashed potatoes I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, milk and butter. As for the carrot mixture- first I sauteed the onion in a little olive oil and then added 2 cloves of garlic until fragrant along with some salt.   Then I added 2 diced carrots and 1 diced parsnip the broth and a bay leaf, half way through cooking I added 1/2c of cremini mushrooms. To the lentils I used nutritional yeast instead of the the other. My prep and cook time took a little longer than the recipe suggested but it was well worth the wait. Delicious, I can't imagine not adding any addition spices to this recipe.

OMG so good! I was looking for a veggie shepherds pie recipe that tasted like my mom's (meat) version, and this is pretty close! I added in 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can whole corn in between the lentils and mashed potatoes to make it "New England Style." I fried up the onion first, then added the broth and lentils and barley, then added the chopped carrot in later. Also added in a bay leaf, some sage, and some thyme. So good, thanks!

So good with my own adaptations!  I made 2 cups of Not Chick'n bouillon, added 1 teaspoon of nutrional yeast, then cooked the lentils and barley in it until tender.  I sauteed the onions in olive oil with 3 cloves of minced garlic, added the walnuts to toast, sauteed the carrots until tender, added about 6 diced button mushrooms, then added about half a cup of frozen chopped spinach, and half a cup each of frozen peas and corn.  I then made a nutritional yeast gravy, and mixed it together with the lentil and barley and veggies.
I made the mashed potatoes, added a thin layer of cheddar cheese on top of the veggies, then added the mashed potatoes.  I then topped the potatoes with cheddar cheese, sprinkled parmesan on top of that, then sprinkled with paprika for added color and a light sprinkle of black pepper.
AWESOME!

Very good. I served with mushroom gravy, and next time will add some sage. I used 1 Tbs. nutritional yeast instead of yeast extract. I also added peas, used 4 carrots, and 5 potatoes. Hubby still wanted more potatoes.

I made this for a dinner I had for several friends and everyone liked it.  It presents well and is a good hearty vegetarian dish to serve.  I added some thyme and savory to the mixture.  Next time I'll probably also add green beans.  I added some light butter to the potatoes and next time would probably add some soy milk too.

This is a very good, filling vegetarian meal. I used baby red potatoes mashed with a little bit of butter, milk, garlic, and salt for the top. I also had to use considerably more vegetable broth for the lentils and barley. I will definitely make this again. For recipe users new to cooking with lentils, note that unless you soak them prior to cooking, they take 45 minutes to 1 hour to to cook.

Made this for dinner tonight with a few tweaks. Thankfully, I had the vegemite on hand having just made a trip home to Australia. I also added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, a tablespoon of tomato puree, 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup of frozen peas. Topped the potatoes with mozzarella and sharp cheddar. Turned out delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

This was good but dry. Perhaps it is from being at a higher altitude? Next time I will make sure to add milk to the potatoes and leave more liquid in the lentil mixture.

Super fantastic. Loved this - made it for thanksgiving and it turned out great. I nixed the walnuts and added a package of veggie ground round to the stew part for my meat-loving partner. I also added some poultry seasoning to the stew to make up for the lack of poultry on turkey day and it really made a difference! I also added frozen peas/corn. Finally, I used yams instead of potatoes on top. Out of this world, and soo healthy! This will be in our regular rotation. Thanks!!!

The mixture has a great texture.  I substituted buckwheat (kasha) for the barley and added frozen green beans, along with some vegetarian brown gravy mix.  Oh, and shredded cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes.  Absolutely delish!  I'm so glad I found this recipe.  Thx!

Love it!!! This could be my new favorite dinner... I can't stop picking at the leftovers. But it does need considerably more broth than is listed, I probably used closer to 5 cups of liquid and cooked the barley/lentil closer to 45 mins to get the texture I liked best. You can add whatever veggies you need to use up (celery, corn, & mushrooms are awesome). I did add spices I like: tarragon, rosemary, garlic & parsley. Thanks for such a yummy recipe!!!

We LOVE Marmite so we added some into the water while heating and some drizzled on top of the mashed potatoes. We also added two bay leaves, two pinches basil and oregano. The end result was fantastic. Thank you so much for sharing!

This is the best vegetarian sheperd's pie recipe. My family consists of vegetarians/non vegetarians and this is one of the few recipes that everyone can agree it's a favorite. The only changes I made was to omit the vegemite(didn't have any) and I add shredded cheddar cheese between the vegetable mixture and mashed potatoes before putting in the oven.  The leftovers are awesome as well. I may try adding chopped garlic to the vegetable mix next time. Let you know how it goes. Thanks Allrecipes for this recipe.

Even my non-vegetarian husband had seconds -- I call that a success!  

Mods:  Had to add extra veg broth to the barley/lentil mixture as the barley just wasn't getting soft.  Added worcestershire sauce to the carrot/onion mixture in place of the yeast extract.  Added a layer of corn in between to make it more like the meaty version I usually make for hubby.  

Next time I think I will put the walnuts through the food processor and maybe add some canned diced tomatoes to the veggie mix.

First attempt a bit bland and dry, but I see the potential.  Added green beans and garlic, as one reviewer recommended, and plan to add a can of tomatoes to both moisten and flavor better next time.

This is one of those dishes that you have to play around with a lot (too much) to get it right.  I followed the recipe and wasn't satisfied with several aspects of this dish - there wasn't even flavour/sauce, it was really dense, my barley/lentil mix was too chewy, the crunchiness of the walnuts just doesn't work, etc.  I made a veggie gravy to add more flavour and added cheese to the mixture but i'm still not willing to serve this for dinner.

Delicious!  Agreed that it needed some additional seasoning.  I added Thyme and Rosemary, and also cooked the onion/carrot/extra veggie mixture with olive oil, garlic, and salt first.  The potatoes needed a little butter or sour cream as well.  Very easy to do once you've tried it once, and I can definitely see how this works well for leftovers!

This is a great starter of a recipe.  I would never make it as is because it is too plain.  I added more vegetables and spices and it turned out quite tasty.

This was OK. I couldn't find the yeast extract anywhere so maybe that's the flavor it's missing. The texture was too chewy for me.

We really liked this, but felt that it could use a few more spices.  Even so, it was quite good and even better the next day.

I was shocked that my husband loved this. The yeast gave it nice depth of flavor, so don't leave that out. I used nutritional yeast, but will use marmite next time, as it is richer. Wish I'd discovered this during Lent, when I gave up meat!

This is a great beginning recipe but I did make several changes: used 2 cups of veggie broth for the lentils and barley then added 1 tbs/1 tbs of water/cornstarch to thicken left over broth into "gravy"; subbed beef bullion for Vegemite (couldn't find); sauteed half onion then added to lentil/barley mixture; sauteed fresh carrots and zucchini, canned peas and green beans (in same pan); microwaved my potatoes then mashed them with a little bit of half and half. I also made a simple gravy (2 tbs of melted butter, 2 tbs of flour, 2 cups of veggie broth, cooked until thick) for serving on the side. I layered everything (lentil/barley-veggies-potatoes) then put under the broiler to brown the potatoes. Oh, I also added the walnuts to the lentils and barley rather than the veggies...it just seemed to make more sense and added a nice texture. Overall a great recipe!!!

This was SO GOOD!!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I am trying to go vegetarian and this will help.  Even my carnivorous family liked it (including two teenage boys).  You need more veggie broth than this recipe calls for.  I used two cans.  I couldn't find any vegemite, so I used yeast mixed with water and that seemed fine.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the onion and carrots with the lentils and barley.  And, I put a thin layer of cheese between the potatoes and the veggie layer.  I used more potatoes than called for as well.  I just seasoned it with salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper and it was perfect.  That lets the flavors of the ingredients come out and it was really good!

This was an excellent recipe, thank you! The walnuts, lentils and barley created a very delicious hearty flavor. I added some frozen peas and would suggest an additional carrot. I didn't have the yeast spread so I used a packet of dried yeast (prepared as directed) and seemed to work fine. This is a great dish to customize with your own favorite veggies.

since the directions called for the use of 4 pots/pans (that's a lot of clean-up time for me) i doubled the recipe and added leftover veggies. i also added some thyme and extra potatoes. it was a hit with my family and will add it too my list of regulars.

Love, love, love this! I've made it for potlucks as well and non-vegetarian people have commented on how good it is. The only changes I make was using buckwheat (kasha) for the barley and gluten free flour for the flour to make it GF friendly.

My kids chowed this down.  I couldn't get over how good it was.  My son commented on how he didn't miss the meat.  The pearled barley gives this a meaty texture.  I didn't have veg. broth so I substituted 2 cups water w/ 1/4 cup Mccormick's French Herb rub for roasting meat (no animal product but the comb. of herbs gives the barley a very meaty taste).  Being in the US, vegemite is hard to find so I substituted nutritional yeast. Absolutely comforting and delicious.   Thanks as we will add this to our list of staple recipes also.

Next time I'll chop the nuts more finely to keep them more in the background. . I don't think the marmite was necessary. I also used evaporated milk and butter as I usually would in my mashed potatoes. This dish was fast and easy to prepare. I will definitely make this again.

Had trouble finding the yeast extract spread, so used Better than Bouillon and it worked fine, wonderful flavor and nice texture; changed the directions slightly as some others suggested: In a large saucepan over medium-low heat, combine broth, yeast extract, lentils, barley, bay leaf and oregano. Simmer 15 minutes, then add carrot, garlic, onion and walnuts. Cook until tender, about 15 more minutes. Combine flour and water, and stir into lentil/carrot mixture; simmer until thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Pour mixture into a 2 quart casserole dish. Spoon mashed potatoes over lentil mixture. Bake at 350ºF for 30 minutes.

Yum, Yum, Yum.  I'm a real meat eater but this dish just made it into our weekly rotation.  It is fabulous.  Like others, I added some butter to the mashed spuds to flavor it up and used home made chicken broth to really bump up the flavor.  I love this dish and would serve it to company without hesitation.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving,and it was great.Everyone enjoyed it and I cant wait to make it again. This is a great vegetarian dish for the cold winter months. I did make a few changes. I didn't use walnuts, I added quite a bit of extra broth to the lentils and barley mixture, I used shallots instead of onion, and I also added butter and milk to the mashed potatoes.

This was surprisingly good!  My husband (a definite meat lover) really loved it!  I used more broth (just kept adding more as needed). I added the onion and carrot to the barley/lentil pot because I hate doing dishes. I added about 3 cloves of coarsely chopped garlic, I also doubled the vegemite!  Came out perfect! So delicious -- thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  I made some modifications, though.  I use Better than Boullion instead of the Vegemite.  I use a can of Veg-All sometimes to make it quicker.  It also needs some spices, too.  I put a little rosemary and some roasted garlic in the potatoes. Also, make sure to add a good bit of salt because it really needs it.

Thanks for a great recipe!  I use celery instead of carrots and walnuts, and I sometimes mix in a little cheddar and butter with my mashed potatoes.  We have this dish about once a week, and everyone loves it!

This was really good. I doubled the recipe and it fed 5 for dinner plus leftovers for my hubby and I the next day - but we are pretty big eaters. I didn't add the salt because I thought it was salty enough without (the broth I used must have been quite salty). Also, I added a little bit of thyme and oregano and I thought this gave it a little something extra. I mashed the potatoes with some butter and milk to make them fluffy. Next time, I might add a little garlic and try cooking the lentils and carrots/walnuts/onions together as other reviewers suggested to dirty one less pot. But yeah, this was really good!

Really enjoyed this. I used miso instead of the vegemite and it turned out fine.  It's really delicious - but yeah, I'd double it next time I think considering it's only 186 calories per serving. Great vegan shepherd's pie, though!!

Yum yum!  I made with rice instead of barley because I was out.  Next time will try with the barley- definitely a keeper.  I love the flavor that the Marmite added (I never would have thought of that).  Thank you!

This is a winner!! It is a vegetarian comfort food. The only change that I made was to leave out the walnuts (not fond of walnuts). Other than that, follow the recipe and get ready for a delicious, warm, yummy meal that really hits the spot.

We would prefer more sauce, so I don't add the flour/water mixture.  A couple tablespoonsful of red wine and maybe one of either Worcestershire or soy sauce would add some depth of flavor.

Used the advice of previous reviewers. Cooked lentils for 15 minutes and added carrot mixture to the same pot.

Left out the walnuts (allergic), and added a touch more Vegemite (a personal favorite). Followed the recipe otherwise, and it turned out great!

This was pretty tasty!  My only mistake was using split peas instead of lentils-- they stayed too chewy for my taste.  The mashed potatoes on top were delicious!   There wasn't even much left over, and there are only two of us!   I also used regular yeast instead of marmite/vegemite (I don't believe they sell that in the U.S...?)  but might just leave it out all together next time.

I am SO happy with this recipe.  Turned out exactly as I hoped and I'd made no changes (except to add about 3/4 cup water to lentil mix before putting into oven so lentils would soften more). You don't miss the meat in the least and really it's no more work than regular Shepherd's Pie. Excellent!  Thank you!

I thought this was good.  My kids and husband loved it.  I will make extra mashed potatoes everytime so I can make this for the next day or to freeze.  I added an extra carrot and left over green beans to the mix and cheese on top. I also didn't have vegemite and used Veggie bullion but I am on the look out for Vegemite now.

Absolutely amazing.  Changes: celery instead of walnuts, yeast flakes instead of vegemite, used some potato water in the barley/lentil/veggie mix (with broth concentrate), cooked barley for 10 min before adding lentils (I don't recommend this!), and I took others suggestions to use 3 pans. I've officially decided I'm going to always make extra mashed potatoes so I can make this afterward (and only have to use 2 pots!).

This was a great meal!  I followed suggestions of others and added the carrot and onion to the lentil pot with 15 minutes left on the timer.  I skipped the flour and  yeast extract.  I added a little salt, one clove of garlic to the lentil mix, put a layer of corn between the lentils and potato, and broiled for the last 5 minutes of cook time for a crispy crust.  Leftovers were even better!

This ended up being a very bland recipe.  I've always been vegetarian and have never tried a meat shepherd's pie (or any other one) before, but even my husband who's had shepard's pie hated this one.  Needed more flavor...

I like it! 
My bf wanted to make some toast and we all agreed a steak would be nice alongside, but I really enjoyed this! Thank you!
I did have to add a dollop of butter to go with those spuds, but other than that (and the prepackaged potatos) this was a healthy and easy dish that I will make again!

Instead of two 'cups' of vegetable broth, use two 14-oz 'cans' and follow the recipe accordingly. (Substitute the word 'cans' for 'cups')

Otherwise it is dreadfully dry and the legumes barely cook.

This is an excellent recipe, I made it for "Veggie Monday" (once a week I try a new vegetarian recipe). My boyfriend, a meat 'n potatoes type, even liked it. The nuts add a nice texture. Only warning: if you cut this recipe in half, keep an eye on the lentils--I cut the liquid in half (because I was cooking half the amount of lentils) and they almost burned, I had to keep adding more broth and water.

Loved this, it was very tasty! I definitely followed the advice from multiple reviewers and added celery, onion, and carrots 15 minutes into cooking the lentils/barley. I ended up adding another cup of liquid (combination of water and veggie broth.) I substituted 1/4 cup of nutritional yeast plus a couple dashes of Tamari in place of the Vegemite. I also added some frozen peas and canned corn when the mixture was done cooking before transferring to the baking dish for some extra veggies. It turned out great! It was our meal for Pi Day.

Surprisingly good!  I was short on burners and time so I made a deconstructed version...  like other reviewers suggested, I cooked the carrot and onion in the same pot as the lentils.  I put the full amount of broth in up front and just added the veggies 15 minutes into the lentils and barley cooking.  When there was 8 minutes left i added a diced zucchini and near the end added a cup of frozen peas.  The "deconstructed" part was I served it over baked potatoes instead of making mashed and baking in the oven.  Saved a lot of time!  Whole family enjoyed it.  I would make this again.

This is pretty good. I use 1.5 mushroom stock cubes in place of the marmite. I double the carrots. I double the mashed potato top because my boys LOVE mashed potatoes. Also, the carrots & onions can be added to the lentils and barley about 15 minutes in. (this just saves washing an extra pot!)

I added an extra carrot and a stalk of celery to the carrot pot and another big potato to the mashed potatoes. It was very good. I will definitely make it again, possibly weekly for winter. The only thing I might change is soaking the lentils and barley ahead of time.

Delicious and easy to put together with simple ingredients. It has nice texture too.  I added peas as it's not shepherd's pie without them, in my book.  However they turned dark as I added them to the carrots at the end of cooking, I guess they picked up the color of the beans.  Next time I'll add them to the top of the casserole just before putting on the potatoes. Thanks for a great recipe that I'll be making often.

After reading other reviews i slightly tweaked the recipe and it turned out fabulously! I used one extra cup of veggie stock for the barley  marmite & lentils. I turned the heat up till it boiled then turned it down to medium low and cooked for 30 minutes then to save on pans I added the carrots (i did 2 not 1) walnuts and onion( I also included a shallot) directly to the lentils mixture plus about one cup veggie stock turned burner up to medium high and cooked for ten minutes then added 2 tsp corn starch mixed with 4 tsp cold water and cooked the whole mixture an extra 5 minutes  i dumped this mixture along with a drained can of peas into baking dish and topped with mashed potatoes. I seasoned my potatoes with margarine, salt, garlic powder and unsweetened almond milk. The overall dish was so like I remember it with meat. It was wonderful!!!!

I used red potatoes and left the skin. I also added a can of sweet corn. I didn't have lentils or barley (I know, it changed the taste to something different perhaps). However, we loved this dish. I made a 9X13 glass pan and my daughter and I ate the entire thing in two days! Delicious and yummy. Great for a cold day. My daughter is vegan so this was perfect for her. I mashed the potatoes using almond milk. I didn't use cheese at all. Again, it was delicious! Thank you!

Love it- make it frequently but now that I have made it lots I have made some changes. I add peas into the mix and sweet potatoes to the mash. I don't add the yeast never had it in my cupboard. Great recipe easy to work with.

Loved this dish as did my family.  It is now on our 2 weekly rotation.  However, made a number of changes:

-used 1/2 lentils to 1/2 dried millet ration
-Doubled recipe and then added:
-used 1 tablespoon of miso instead of the vegemite
-added 1/4 cup nutritional yeast, 3 cloves garlic, 1 cup of frozen corn and 1 cup of frozen kale, 1/2 cup creamed corn (put corned in high speed blender with a bit of stock), fresh savory, bay leaf, dried italian herbs
-omitted walnuts
-mixed mash potatoes with a bit of nut milk and nutritional yeast

Okay so maybe this is a completely difference recipe now, but I couldn't have got there without the original, so thanks!

This was very good! I made it as written except for the vegemite which I couldnt find. I did add a 1/2 cup of diced sauted mushrooms. I also had to use more water since my lentils soaked up a lot of it. My DH went back for 3 helpings. Definately a keeper! :)

mmmm, so yummy!! The vegemite really seems to make all the difference!! Howvever, I included a few modifications; substituted the walnuts for SUNFLOWER SEEDS- the texture went really well with the barley!! 
Also, way too little water in the recipe, added about another cup and a half. I also put cheese in between potato/ grain layers like others suggested. Will definately be making this again!!

This is now a staple recipe at my place.  Friends and co-workers like it, meat eaters included.  i've never made it without someone genuinely wanting the recipe, though i do it without walnuts because I don't like them and I use my favourite mashed potato recipe for the topping which includes cream cheese and butter if i'm feeling indulgent.
