An update...

After making this for years, and enjoying it, I started to get into vegetarian cooking and purchased Deborah Madison's "Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone". Imagine my surprise when I found this recipe, almost exactly as written, in that cookbook! However, the poster left out a step, which is to parboil the potatoes, already sliced (DM also recommend fingerling potatoes sliced in half, if available), for 10 minutes, before roasting with remaining veggies. At that point, you cover with foil, bake at 375 for 35 minutes, then uncover and bake another 15. Might help some of you crunchy potato people out.

Anyway, if you enjoyed this, I highly suggest the Madison cookbook mentioned. It is beyond phenomenal. I am not even a vegetarian, and it is by far my favorite cookbook.

And as a side note, please, never use dried cilantro or parsley as suggested by another reviewer. They have 0 flavor.

This recipe is great for those who love well-spiced (but not necessarily hot) recipes!  Even if you're not a cilantro fan, you'll still love this one.  Make sure to taste the herb sauce after adding 1/2 of the lemon to determine if more is needed.  I added 8 garlic cloves and it was great!

I love this dish! It's *always* a hit for company or potlucks. Even my mother -- who professes to hate cilantro -- loves it. I find it needs a longer baking time than the recipe says.

This was a fair amount of work, and I did it the easy way. Instead of fresh herbs, I used 2 tbsp. of dried cilantro and parsley. Since there was less to "process," I was able to mix up the sauce without using a blender, just using a garlic press and a fork to mix. I poured the sauce over the potato/veggie mixture and stirred it all up a bit. Instead of fresh tomatoes, I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced ones. I only had idaho potatoes, and they worked fine, but I had to cook the dish for quite a bit longer. I didn't have red pepper, so I used an orange one instead. I used pre-made lemon juice but probably only had the equiv. of half a lemon. I think the juice from the canned tomatoes evened out the liquid levels anyway. The end result was good. At first, we weren't totally impressed, but the second day after the sauce really had time to sink into the veggies, it was definitely better. Next time, I would add more cayenne and 1/2 a tbsp. less vinegar. Then I'd substitute the yellow pepper with zuchinni.

I made it this week and it was FABULOUS!!!  The only thing I might do differently is add a can of chopped, stewed tomatos with half the can of juice instead of the fresh tomatos since I really loved the sauce and want more!!

A decent side to complement a main dish, but don't be fooled, this recipe is no casserole--it's nothing more than roasted veggies with a herb-intensive marinade. I probably won't take the time to prepare and cook this recipe again.

I did not care for this.  I'm giving it two stars instead of one because it presents really nicely.  With some major overhaul of spices this could be a very nice dish.  It was very pretty. Followed the recipe exactly.  I LOVE Moroccan food and found this to be a very poor representation of what food from that region should taste like.

The sauce was very tasty, but the potatoes were not even close to tender, even after I added 15 minutes to the time. It might be a good idea to precook the potatoes before baking.

Delicious dish, I love the way the peppers added a sweetness to it.  The lemon was a bit overpowering, I think I will only use half as much next time.  It also took much longer to cook up than the recipe suggested.  I put mine in the oven for 30 minutes with the tin foil, then it took an additional 45 minutes for the potatoes to become tender.

I made this twice for Holiday meals and it was always a winner! You will have to cook the potatoes longer than it describes here - like about an hour. Also I did diced canned tomatoes instead of fresh and loooved the sauce!

A lot of chopping.  Next time I might half the recipe.  Overall, it was pretty good.  I'll make it again.

I'm sitting between, okay and liked it. While I had all the ingredients on hand and it was rather easy to put together. The herb mixture was not a sauce, as stated in the 3rd step of the directions. It was thick and pasty and rather then a sauce, so it made me go "ohh fudge, what did I do wrong?" which I didn't feel I did but feel that there was way to much cilantro and parsley, I followed threw with the rest of the recipe as directed. However, the over all dish wasn't quite appealing as it was dark and blah looking. The smell as it was baking was not pleasant at all, and really made everyone complain....However, the dish was okay, the flavor was different, not something I had ever tried. My girls said some things in the dish was nice and avoided other things in it. I used small red potatoes and just slice in half or quartered because of their size. But will say, less peppers, less cilantro & parsley...And the dish would be better.

This is definitely a ten.  It is a keeper and repeater.  It was really a big hit around here.  Looks great, too.  Great looking dish for a smorgasboard dinner.

Made a lot of mess with this one since the prep for it was a lot to handle in my small kitchen. I wasn't a fan of the sauce, however, it was nice and unique tasting so I that's why it gets 2 stars. I probably won't be making this again.

I made this with sweet potatoes, and it was so good and flavorful. I left out the celery because I don't like it cooked; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Making this with sweet potatoes really added another dimension of flavor and brought out the sweetness of the peppers. However, it took even longer to cook--almost 2 hrs. I tossed the potatoes in the dressing and let them bake while I was chopping the rest of the veggies, but that was only 20 min., so next time I'll give them more of a head start so the peppers and tomatoes won't get too soggy. I didn't think this dish was a lot of work--the sauce is made in a processor, and the veggies are chopped into big chunks; prep time was about 35 min.

This was great. I had to cook this a lot longer than the recipe said because my potatoes wouldn't get soft. I also added cubes of eggplant.

Very tasty.  I subbed balamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  I threw in some pre-cooked salad shrimp toward the last half of cooking time.

Very tasty. The sauce tasted a little bland before I mixed it with the vegetables, so I added another 14 teaspoon cayenne.  The result was too hot for my husband, and it was spicier after cooking, so I won't do that again.

Fantastic! Unfortunately I couldn't find fresh cilantro at the store this time around, but just added a  bit more parsley and some dried dill and basil, and it was still great. 

Also didn't add the celery, can never find it at the store, but I prefer it without anyway. 

Definitely a keeper. I'll remember to make this next time I need to impress someone.

This dish is absolutely delicious. I did alter the recipe by omitting the tomatoes and I actually forgot to add the celery, I also added basil, oregano and onion flakes to the sauce mixture.  I also added a pack of chicken sausage and a bag of shrimp. After my potatoes and sauce had been mixed in the pan I added some chicken stock afterwards I removed potato mixture and took the flavored stock and made a thickener using cornstarch then poured it over my dish and it taste absolutely delicious.

Had a bunch of potatoes to use up, so used more of those and had to cook it a lot longer than written.  Also added a small onion chopped up. Very tasty and filling.

We didn't care or the spice combination. I reduced the amount of oil it called for and I still found this  to be too greasy.

Excellent flavor. I did 10 cloves of garlic and added fresh torn kale over the top. I also tossed the tomatoes in the garlic cilantro sauce. It was just the right amount of heat with the cayenne pepper! I will make this one again for sure!

This recipe is delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe directed but used organic, dried parsley and cilantro as that was what I had on hand. I would definitely recommend  this one.

This recipe needs to be reviewed and revised. I made this for a dinner party. By the time it was actually finished, dinner was done. Everything was cut to specifications. I timed out the hour and 5 minutes as advised in the recipe but the potatoes were not cooked through. After another 45 minutes in the oven, the dish was completed only to be placed in the fridge for leftovers. Waste of time and waste of money. I'm eating it, but I'm hating it.

Made this tonight for my wife who's vegan.  She loved it and so did I.  As far as the ingredients, I made it almost just like the recipe.  There were however some changes I made during the preparation and baking.  Based on past experience, IMO there's no way @350 degrees all the 1/2" thick slices of potato are going to be fully baked and tender in the amount of  baking time this recipe calls for.  After slicing the potatoes I parboiled them for 5 minutes and honestly they could've used a bit more time.  Next time I'll try 8 minutes. I was a bit concerned that it would be on the sour/tart side due to the vinegar and lemon juice.  I changed it up a bit using 2 tbs red wine vinegar and 1 tbs balsamic vinegar versus the 3 tbs red wine vinegar to add a bit of sweetness.  That worked out well.  I also didn't make the dressing till all the veggies were cut and in the bowl.  Then I got out the food processor and made the dressing and got it tossed with the veggies and right in to the oven.  That kept all the flavor bright and fresh in the dressing. 

Even with the parboiling and baking for the allotted time, some of my potatoes weren't  quite done.  Also the celery needed more baking time too.  I just continued baking checking for doneness at 10 minute intervals till the celery and potatoes were done.  Didn't keep track of the extra baking time but was probably 30 to 35 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.  I did stir it around a bit while baking for the extra time.  I think par

This is very good.  I'm not sure the celery adds anything but the tomatoes are an important addition.  Nice and spicy, wonderful flavor.

This was wonderful! I made it as-is minus the celery. I have used this seasoning before on lamb skewers on bbq Sundays but I did not think to do the same for a vegetable dish.

It was ok. My potatoes were still a little hard after the recommended cooking time. I threw in some chickpeas for a little protein which was a nice addition.

Interesting flavor. I was a bit worried that it would be to strong because of the smell the liquid and herbs had (REALLY STRONG), but it came out very tasty.

I was disappointed with this dish. The recipe sounded great, but like a number of others, I found it too sour, even though I only used the juice of half a lemon. If I make it another time, I'll reduce the amount of vinegar too. And I'll use onion instead of the celery to sweeten it a little.  Having read in many reviews how long the potato takes to cook, I parboiled the slices for 5 minutes before starting and that worked very well.

I loved this recipe. It was flavorful and fun to make, but I really enjot cooking. I can see how this would not be a working persons favorite dish to make. It requires a lot of chopping and prep, but I thought it was well worth it. It took about 20 additional minutes for the potatoes to get tender and I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper and it was PLEANTY spicy.

This is a GREAT recipe! Made it for a dinner party with African Curry chicken and Ginger Pears for dessert - it was a huge hit. 
I now use this sauce for salad dressing and a topping for fish and chicken - it is so fresh tasting and flavorful.
The only change that I made was using 1/4 cinnamon instead of the cumin - I was out the first time I made this. I also don't put in the celery now- just because I don't like the texture of it cooked...Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I did not like this recipe.  It was not worth the work.  I gave it two stars because my friends did seem to enjoy it.  However, if they knew how much work was involved, I don't think they would have thought it was worth it either.
